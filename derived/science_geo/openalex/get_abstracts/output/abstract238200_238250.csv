https://openalex.org/W2144435948,"The identification of a novel mutation (E46K) in one of the KTKEGV-type repeats in the amino-terminal region of α-synuclein suggests that this region and, more specifically, Glu residues in the repeats may be important in regulating the ability of α-synuclein to polymerize into amyloid fibrils. It was demonstrated that the E46K mutation increased the propensity of α-synuclein to fibrillize, but this effect was less than that of the A53T mutation. The substitution of Glu46 for an Ala also increased the assembly of α-synuclein, but the polymers formed can have different ultrastructures, further indicating that this amino acid position has a significant effect on the assembly process. The effect of residue Glu83 in the sixth repeat of α-synuclein, which lies closest to the amino acid stretch critical for filament assembly, was also studied. Mutation of Glu83 to a Lys or Ala increased polymerization but perturbed some of the properties of mature amyloid. These results demonstrated that some of the Glu residues within the repeats can have significant effects on modulating the assembly of α-synuclein to form amyloid fibrils. The greater effect of the A53T mutation, even when compared with what may be predicted to be a more dramatic mutation such as E46K, underscores the importance of protein microenvironment in affecting protein structure. Moreover, the relative effects of the A53T and E46K mutations are consistent with the age of onset of disease. These findings support the notion that aberrant α-synuclein polymerization resulting in the formation of pathological inclusions can lead to disease.

Whereas the function of α-syn has not been not fully characterized, several studies suggest that it is involved in modulating synaptic transmission, the density of synaptic vesicles, and neuronal plasticity (5Withers G.S.

Another autosomal dominant mutation (A30P) in α-syn has been identified in a German kindred (15Kruger R. Kuhn W. Muller T. Woitalla D. Graeber M. Kosel S. Przuntek H. Epplen J.T. Schols L. Riess O.

Recently, a short trisomy containing the α-syn gene plus flanking regions on chromosome 4 and a novel E46K mutation in α-syn have been identified in separate kindreds in which individuals manifest classical PD or the related disorder, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) (16Singleton A.B.

It is now recognized that α-syn is the major building block of the filaments that form the proteinacious pathological inclusions characteristic of many disorders, including Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in PD, DLB, and Lewy body variant of Alzheimer's disease (19Spillantini M.G.

Approximately 10-nm-wide fibrils of α-syn also are the primary component of glial cytoplasmic inclusions in multiple system atrophy (24Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Cairns N.J. Lantos P.L.

The finding that soluble recombinant α-syn readily polymerizes into ∼10-nm filaments in vitro (35Giasson B.I. Uryu K. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol.

This finding also has provided important means to study this process in vitro. The polymerization of α-syn is nucleation-dependent (38Narhi L. Wood S.J. Steavenson S. Jiang Y. Wu G.M. Anafi D.

The central hydrophobic region (known as the NAC region) in α-syn is necessary for fibrillization (40Giasson B.I. Murray I.V. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2380-2386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 41Biere A.L. Wood S.J. Wypych J. Steavenson S. Jiang Y. Anafi D. Jacobsen F.W. Jarosinski M.A. Wu G.M. Louis J.C. Martin F. Narhi L.O. Citron M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34574-34579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Amino acid deletions or differences in this region explain why other syn family members (i.e. β- and γ-syn) do not fibrillize under physiological conditions (40Giasson B.I. Murray I.V. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2380-2386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 42Du H.N. Tang L. Luo X.Y. Li H.T. Hu J. Zhou J.W. Hu H.Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8870-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Other regions in α-syn also are important in modulating filament formation. The A53T mutation within the amino-terminal region has been consistently reported to increase the propensity of fibril formation (35Giasson B.I. Uryu K. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7619-7622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 36Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1318-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar, 38Narhi L. Wood S.J. Steavenson S. Jiang Y. Wu G.M. Anafi D. Kaufman S.A. Martin F. Sitney K. Denis P. Louis J.C. Wypych J. Biere A.L. Citron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9843-9846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Further support for the important role of the amino-terminal region of α-syn comes from fibrillogenesis experiments in which the number of repeats was modified. Deletion of repeats 1 and 2 in the amino terminus of α-syn accelerates filament formation, whereas duplication of these repeats inhibits this process (43Kessler J.C. Rochet J.C. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 672-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The recent identification of the new (E46K) amino-terminal mutation in α-syn (18Zarranz J.J. Alegre J. Gomez-Esteban J.C. Lezcano E. Ros R. Ampuero I. Vidal L. Hoenicka J. Rodriguez O. Atares B. Llorens V. Gomez T.E. del Ser T. Munoz D.G. de Yebenes J.G. Ann. Neurol. 2004; 55: 164-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar) in the fourth repeat of α-syn (Fig. 1) further suggests that the amino-terminal region may be important in modulating filament formation; however, the effect of this mutation had not been studied. Whereas our initial goal was to study the effect that this mutation had on the polymerization of α-syn, it was also noted that a Glu residue similar to Glu46 is present in five of the six degenerative repeats in α-syn. The only repeat that does not have such a residue (repeat 2) has Glu residues adjacent to each side of the repeat (see Fig. 1). The possibility that Glu residues in the repeats are important in modulating the ability of α-syn to polymerize was further investigated by generating the mutant E46A. The Ala mutation results in the loss of one negative charge, instead of a complete change in charge from negative to positive. The effects of the mutants E83A and E83K in the sixth repeat, closest to the amino acid stretch critical for polymerization, were also studied to assess the role of Glu residues. Expression and Purification of α-Syn—Human α-syn cDNA was cloned into the NdeI and HindIII restriction sites of the bacterial expression vector pRK172. The cDNAs coding for the mutant α-syn protein E46A, E46K, E83A, and E83K in the same vector were engineered by creating the corresponding nucleotide substitutions in the wild-type cDNA using complementary sets of synthetic single-stranded DNA containing the mutant sequence and the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. α-Syn proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Bacterial pellets harvested by centrifugation were re-suspended in high-salt buffer (0.75 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors, heated to 100 °C for 10 min, and centrifuged at 70,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatants were dialyzed into 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5 and applied onto a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) and separated by size exclusion. The fractions were assayed for the presence of the α-syn proteins by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue R-250 staining. Proteins were concentrated using Centriprep-10 units (Millipore); dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5; applied to a Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences); and eluted with a 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce) and bovine serum albumin as a standard. Filament Assembly and Centrifugal Sedimentation—α-Syn proteins were assembled into filaments by incubation at 37 °C in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.0, with continuous shaking. A fraction of each sample was set aside for K114 fluorometry and electron microscopy (EM) analysis. The remainder of each sample was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min, and SDS sample buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm dithiothreitol, 1% SDS, and 10% sucrose) was added to pellets and supernatants, which were heated to 100 °C for 15 min. α-Syn proteins in the supernatants and pellets were quantified by densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels or 125I quantitative Western blotting analysis (40Giasson B.I.

Trojanoswki J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Neuron. 2002; 34: 521-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). K114 Fluorometry—α-Syn can form amyloid fibrils (45Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2552-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), which can be quantified using the fluorescent amyloid binding dye K114 (46Crystal A.S. Giasson B.I. Crowe A. Kung M.P. Zhuang Z.P. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This dye derived from the structure of Congo Red is soluble in aqueous buffers, and it demonstrates a tremendous increase in fluorescence upon binding to amyloid fibrils (46Crystal A.S. Giasson B.I. Crowe A. Kung M.P. Zhuang Z.P. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This assay was conducted, as described previously (46Crystal A.S. Giasson B.I. Crowe A. Kung M.P. Zhuang Z.P. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), by incubating a fraction of each sample with K114 (50 μm) in 100 mm glycine, pH 8.5, and measuring fluorescence (λex = 380 nm, λem = 550 nm, cutoff = 530 nm) with a SpectraMax Gemini fluorometer and SoftMax Pro 4.0 software. CD Spectrometry—α-Syn proteins prepared at concentrations of 2.5 or 5 mg/ml in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, were analyzed by CD immediately upon or after incubation at 37 °C for 24, 48, or 96 h with constant shaking. Proteins were diluted to a final concentration of 5 μm into 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. After dilution, the protein was transferred into a 1-mm quartz cuvette, and the CD spectra between 190 and 260 nm were recorded using an Aviv model 202 spectrophotometer (Lakewood, NJ.) Attenuated Total Internal-Reflection Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) Spectroscopy—Monomeric α-syn samples were dialyzed against 30 mm HEPES buffer in D2O at pD = 7.4 (meter reading 7.0), adjusted to a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml, and drawn into a 15-μm flow cell with CaF2 windows. This technique, employing ordinary transmission mode spectroscopy, was the best way to characterize the protein in solution and avoid consequences of any changes in physical condition. 512 co-added interferograms were collected on a Digilab FTS-60A equipped with a wide band MCT detector. All spectra were collected at room temperature at 20 kHz with a resolution of 2 cm–1, undersampling ratio of 2, one level of zero-filling, and triangular apodization. The ratio of detector response to that obtained with protein-free buffer was calculated to yield the absorption spectrum. A flat baseline was subtracted from each spectrum, but no water vapor subtraction or smoothing operations were performed. Assembled α-syn samples were dialyzed against 5 mm HEPES buffer in D2O at pD = 7.4 and adjusted to a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml, and ∼3 μl of this solution were placed on a 2 × 10 × 52-mm germanium internal reflection crystal with 45° facets and evaporated to dryness at room temperature. 1024 co-added interferograms were collected before and after application of each sample and processed as described above to yield the absorption spectrum. This technique, involving drying of the sample and probing with an evanescent field, was necessary because the assembled protein did not readily pass through the flow cell and would not otherwise remain in place throughout the 10-min period required to collect the spectrum. The six spectra of monomeric α-syn were analyzed simultaneously using Irfit (47Silvestro L. Axelsen P.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), as were the six spectra of aggregated α-syn in a separate operation. Both sets of spectra are well fit by three components. Within each set, each component has the same frequency, half-width, and shape in each experimental spectrum, with only the amplitude of each component adjusted to fit the data. Negative Staining EM—Assembled α-syn filaments were absorbed onto 300 mesh carbon-coated copper grids, stained with 1% uranyl acetate, and visualized with a Joel 1010 transmission electron microscope (Peabody, MA). Images were captured with a Hamamatsu digital camera (Bridgewater, MA) using AMT software (Danvers, MA). For diameter determination, the width of 100–120 filaments was measured using Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Del Mar, CA). Calpain I Cleavage of α-Syn Proteins—Calpain I (Calbiochem) cleavage of purified recombinant human α-syn proteins was carried out using methods similar to those described previously (48Mishizen-Eberz A.J. Guttmann R.P. Giasson B.I. Day III, G.A. Hodara R. Ischiropoulos H. Lee V.M.-Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Lynch D.R. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 836-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Briefly, α-syn protein was incubated with calpain I in buffer containing 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 5 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C. Calpain cleavage was initiated by the addition of calcium (1 mm final concentration). Aliquots were removed from the reaction mixture and added to an equal volume of 2× Invitrogen SDS-stop buffer at various time points, heated in a boiling water bath, and stored at –20 °C. Western Blotting Analysis—Proteins were resolved on slab gels by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH) in buffer containing 48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, and 10% methanol. Membranes were blocked with a 1% solution of powdered skimmed milk dissolved in Tris buffered saline-Tween 20 (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20), incubated with anti-α-syn antibodies Syn 303, SNL-1, or Syn 102 (49Duda J.E.

After incubation with either goat anti-mouse or a goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, the blots were developed with Renaissance Enhanced Luminol Reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed onto X-Omat Blue XB-1 films (Eastman Kodak Co.). The effects of two α-syn mutations causal of disease (A53T and E46K) and three synthetic mutations (E46A, E83A, and A83K) were studied. The ability of these proteins to polymerize was compared with that of wild-type (WT) α-syn as assayed by sedimentation analysis and K114 fluorometry (Fig. 2, A and B). At the highest concentration (5 mg/ml) of α-syn proteins used for these analyses, all α-syn proteins readily formed polymers that could be sedimented at 100,000 × g. Whereas all mutant α-syn proteins tested formed amyloid structures as revealed by K114 fluorometry, the E83A and E83K mutants generated much less K114 fluorescence. Experiments using a low concentration of proteins (2.5 or 1 mg/ml) showed that the E46K mutant polymerized more readily than the WT protein but that the effect was not as dramatic as the change seen in the A53T mutant. As quantified by sedimentation assay, the synthetic mutants E46A, E83A, and E83K also showed an increased propensity to polymerize. To determine the conformational changes associated with the polymerization of α-syn proteins, CD and ATR-FTIR spectrometry were performed. CD spectrometry on monomeric α-syn proteins showed a minimum between 195 and 200 nm, indicating predominantly random coil or unstructured conformation (Fig. 3A). After incubation under assembly conditions, WT, A53T, E46K, and E83K α-syn proteins demonstrated CD spectra characterized by negative deflection at 215–225 nm and positive signal at 195–205, indicating that they had acquired predominantly β-pleated sheet conformation (Fig. 3B). Despite positive results in sedimentation assays (Fig. 2) and EM (see Fig. 5), the assembled proteins E46A and E83A yielded relatively low CD signal compared with the other mutants tested.Fig. 5EM analysis of α-syn filaments assembled in vitro. WT, E46A, E46K, E83A, and E83K α-syn proteins at 5 mg/ml were incubated under assembly conditions and analyzed by negative staining EM as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Scale bar, 200 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The infrared spectra of monomeric α-syn proteins exhibit a maximum at 1646.2 cm–1, with a predominant component comprising 60–70% of the signal that is centered at 1643.9 cm–1. This suggests that the proteins are unstructured under these conditions (Fig. 3C). Most of the remaining signal, ∼30%, is accounted for by a broad component centered at 1668.1 cm–1; however, conformational assignment of this component is not reliable. The five mutant proteins were indistinguishable from WT protein. The spectra for the aggregated α-syn proteins were quite distinct from those of monomeric proteins (Fig. 3D). The maximum was at 1627.9 cm–1, with the dominant component centered at 1625.0 cm–1 comprising 44–55% of the signal. The position of this component suggests that substantial amounts of β-sheet structure have formed in the course of aggregation. The component at 1643.9 cm–1 in monomeric proteins appears to have shifted slightly to 1641.4 cm–1 and decreased to between 7% and 24% of the signal. As with the monomeric proteins, ∼30% of the signal is accounted for by a high frequency component centered, in this case, at 1661.4 cm–1. Again, spectra from the five mutated proteins were similar to that of the WT protein. The difference between A53T and E46K α-syn and the other proteins is minimal and therefore difficult to interpret as a significant conformational change. In order to obtain more detailed information regarding the conformational changes accompanying the fibrillization of WT and E46K α-syn, samples prepared at 2.5 mg/ml were allowed to fibrillize for 0, 24, 48, or 96 h. At each time point, CD spectra were collected for WT and E46K α-syn. The changes in CD spectra over time indicated that E46K α-syn converts from random coil conformation to β-sheet more readily than the WT protein (Fig. 4, A and B). These changes can be more easily compared by plotting assembly time versus molar ellipticity at 200 nm. The signal at this wavelength is important for differentiating between random coil and β-sheet because they generate negati"

SIRT1, the closest mammalian ortholog of the yeast SIR2 (silent information regulator 2) gene, represses several transcription factors, including p53, NFκB and forkhead proteins. The p300 protein serves as a rate-limiting transcriptional cointegrator of diverse transcription factors either to activate or to repress transcription through modular subdomains. Herein, SIRT1 physically interacted with and repressed p300 transactivation, requiring the NAD-dependent deacetylase activity of SIRT1. SIRT1 repression involved the CRD1 transcriptional repression domain of p300. Two residues within the CRD1 domain (Lys-1020 and Lys-1024) were required for SIRT1 repression and served as substrates for SIRT1 deacetylation. These residues also serve as acceptor lysines for modification by the ubiquitin-like SUMO protein. The SUMO-specific protease SSP3 relieved SIRT1 repression of p300. SSP3 antagonism of SIRT1 required the SUMO-deconjugating function of SSP3. Thus, p300 serves as a deacetylase substrate for SIRT1 through a conserved SUMO consensus motif. Because p300 is a limiting transcriptional cofactor, deacetylation and repression of p300 by SIRT1 may serve an important integration point during metabolism and cellular differentiation.

The relative abundance of p300 is rate-limiting in coactivation and corepression of many transcription factors, thus p300 serves to integrate diverse signaling pathways involved in metabolism and cellular differentiation (1Chan H.M.

The bromo domain plays a role in protein-protein interactions. Association with chromatin through the bromo domain facilitates histone acetylation and activation of transcription on chromatin templates in vitro (20Dhalluin C. Carlson J. Zeng L. He C. Aggarwal A.

We therefore investigated the mechanism by which SIRT1 may directly regulate p300 function. Herein, SIRT1 physically associated with and repressed p300 transcriptional activity. Mutational analysis demonstrated that SIRT1 repression of p300 required residues Lys-1020 and Lys-1024 within the CRD1 transcriptional repression domain. We show that the lysine 1020 and lysine 1024 residues are in vitro substrates for mSIR2α, a SIRT1 homolog expressed in mouse. These lysine residues required for SIRT1 repression form a consensus site required for p300 sumoylation. SIRT1 repression of p300 was attenuated by the SUMO deconjugase SSP3, suggesting that p300 residues lysine 1020 and lysine 1024 are the sites of both sumoylation and SIRT1 repression. The results reveal a novel interplay between the NAD-dependent deacetylation function of SIRT1 and sumoylation in the regulation of p300 function. Cell Culture and Treatments—The HEK 293 and HEK 293T cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin, and 1% streptomycin. The cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Nicotinamide (Sigma) was dissolved freshly in water prior to use at a stock concentration of 400 mm and for cell culture was used at a final concentration of either 5 or 10 mm. Antibodies—The antibodies used for Western blotting and immunoprecipitation were as follows: mouse monoclonal anti-Gal4 (DBD) RK5C1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; 2.5 μg of antibody/500 μgof protein for immunoprecipitation), rabbit polyclonal anti-Gal4 (DBD) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:1,500 for Western blotting), rabbit polyclonal anti-acetylated lysine antibody (Cell Signaling Technology; 1:1,000 for Western blotting), rabbit polyclonal anti-Myc (A-14) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:800 for Western blotting), mouse monoclonal anti-Myc (9E10) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:2,000 for Western blotting), mouse monoclonal anti-SIRT1, clone 2G1/F7 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY; 1:1500 for Western blotting).

Luciferase Assays—HEK 293 and HEK 293T cells were seeded at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in a 24-well plate on the day prior to transfection. The following day the cells were transiently transfected with the appropriate combination of the reporter, expression vectors, and control vector with Superfect reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 or 48 h post-transfection luciferase assays were performed at room temperature using an Autolumat LB 953 (EG&G Berthold) as described previously (46Watanabe G. Howe A. Lee R.J. Albanese C. Shu I.W. Karnezis A.N. Zon L. Kyriakis J. Rundell K. Pestell R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12861-12866Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). For nicotinamide treatments, 4 h post-transfection the medium was changed with medium containing 5 mm nicotinamide, and cells were incubated for an additional 24 h before harvesting for luciferase assay. Luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency using a β-galactosidase reporter (RSVβ-gal) as an internal control. Experimental data are mean of at least two independent experiments with luciferase activity normalized for β-galactosidase activity, conducted in triplicate. In parallel, transfections were conducted with the expression vector for the Gal4 DNA binding domain alone (Gal4-DBD), and luciferase activity is shown relative to the Gal4-DBD alone set at 1. Where indicated, the -fold effect was also determined by comparison with the equivalent empty expression vector cassette. Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test, and significant differences were established as p < 0.05. Western Blots—Western blotting was performed as described previously (47Neumeister P. Pixley F.J. Xiong Y. Xie H. Wu K. Ashton A. Cammer M. Chan A. Symons M. Stanley E.R. Pestell R.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2005-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After transfer, the membrane was blocked in 3% skim milk overnight. For immunodetection of proteins the membrane was incubated with the appropriate primary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. The blotted membrane was then washed three times with 0.1% Tween 20 phosphate-buffered saline (PBST) and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (1:3,000). The membranes were washed three times with PBST, and immunoreactive proteins were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation Assays—Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were performed as described previously (48Wang C. Pattabiraman N. Zhou J.N. Fu M. Sakamaki T. Albanese C. Li Z. Wu K. Hulit J.

HEK 293T cells were plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells in 10-cm plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium the day before transfection. Cells were transfected with expression vectors and control vector using Superfect reagent (Qiagen) and cultured for 24 h. The cell monolayer was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and the collected cells lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with HDAC inhibitors (10 mm nicotinamide and 1 μm TSA), protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) (47Neumeister P.

Biol. 2004; 241: 207-216PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min. The protein concentration was measured by the Bio-Rad assay and the protein lysates diluted to 1 μg/μl in lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitation assays were then performed on 500–1,200 μg of total protein. Lysates were precleared by the addition of 30 μl of a 50% slurry of protein G-agarose beads/500 μg of protein, by rocking at 4 °C for 1 h. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation and immunoprecipitated with the anti-Gal4-DBD RK5C1 mouse monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz; 2.5 μg of antibody/500 μg of protein) by rocking at 4 °C for 1 h. To the immunoprecipitate was added, per 500 μg of protein, 30 μl of a 50% slurry of protein G-agarose beads and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rocking. The beads were washed three times with buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20. The immunoprecipitates were eluted by boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 4% SDS) and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis and Western blotting as described above. Deacetylation Assays of the p300 mCRD1 Peptide—Deacetylation assays were performed as described previously (39Vaziri H. Dessain S.K. Ng Eaton E. Imai S.I. Frye R.A. Pandita T.K. Guarente L.

Mouse SIR2α enzyme (mSIR2α) (Upstate Biotechnology) (2 μg) was added to a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 500 μm NAD and 50 μm p300 peptide with the sequence ERSTEL(AcK)TEI-(AcK)EEEDQPSTS (Bio-Synthesis, Texas). Reactions were incubated at 28 °C for 5 h. At 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 h time points reactions were assayed for production of either ADPR (adenosine diphosphate ribose), AADPR (acetyladenosine diphosphate ribose) and nicotinamide by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) or for peptide deacetylation by HPLC. For the production of ADPR, AADPR, and nicotinamide, the reaction mixture was separated on a Waters C-18 semipreparative column (4.2 × 300 mm) eluted (2.0 ml/min) with 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5.0. The order of elution is shown in Fig. 6A at 260 nm. For peptide HPLC, the chromatograms were obtained on a Vydac C-18 analytical column for peptide and nucleic acids, with a gradient elution (1.5 ml/min) of 15% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, to 40% acetonitrile at 30 min. Detection of peptide products was obtained at 215 nm. The HPLC system used was a Waters 600 pump with a 717 autosampler (temperature-controlled) and a 2487 UV-visible detector. Peptide peaks were identified further by MS analysis. LC/MS/MS Analysis—The reaction solution was loaded onto a Vydac 1.0 × 50-mm C-8 column (The Separations Group, Hesperia, CA).

However, due to the absence of a cell culture system to efficiently amplify HCV, it is not clear how SR-BI contributes to HCV entry. Here, we sought to determine how high density lipoproteins (HDLs), the natural ligand of SR-BI, affect HCV entry. By using the recently described infectious HCV pseudotyped particles (HCVpps) that display functional E1E2 glycoprotein complexes, we showed that HDLs are able to markedly enhance HCVpp entry. We did not find any evidence of HDL association with HCVpps, suggesting that HCVpps do not enter into target cells using HDL as a carrier to bind to its receptor. Interestingly, lipid-free apoA-I and apoA-II, the major HDL apolipoproteins, were unable to enhance HCVpp infectivity. In addition, drugs inhibiting HDL cholesteryl transfer (block lipid transport (BLT)-2 and BLT-4) reduced HDL enhancement of HCVpp entry, suggesting a role for lipid transfer in facilitating HCVpp entry. Importantly, silencing of SR-BI expression in target cells by RNA interference markedly reduced HDL-mediated enhancement of HCVpp entry. Finally, enhancement of HCVpp entry was also suppressed when the SR-BI binding region on HCV glycoprotein E2 was deleted. Altogether, these data indicate that HDL-mediated enhancement of HCVpp entry involves a complex interplay between SR-BI, HDL, and HCV envelope glycoproteins, and they highlight the active role of HDLs in HCV entry.

HCV infection causes acute hepatitis, which has a high probability of becoming chronic and in the long term can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (1Major M.E. Rehermann B. Feinstone S.M. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, Pa2001: 1127-1162Google Scholar). Because of the serious consequences of its infection in humans, much effort is being made to understand the basic mechanisms of HCV lifecycle. Because of the absence of an efficient cell culture system to replicate HCV, several laboratories have tried to develop surrogate models to study HCV entry (2Op De Beeck A. Dubuisson J. Hepatology. 2003; 37: 705-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). These models are based on the expression of HCV envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2, which form a noncovalent heterodimer. Several difficulties have been encountered in these approaches because HCV envelope glycoproteins are located in the endoplasmic reticulum (3Dubuisson J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 242: 135-148PubMed Google Scholar), and their folding and assembly is very sensitive to mutations or deletions affecting the endoplasmic reticulum retention domains (4Op De Beeck A. Cocquerel L. Dubuisson J. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 2589-2595Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Recently, infectious pseudotyped particles (HCVpps) that are assembled by displaying unmodified HCV envelope glycoproteins onto retroviral core particles have successfully been generated and now enable studies of HCV entry (5Bartosch B.

The cellular tropism of enveloped viruses is largely determined by selective interactions of viral envelope glycoproteins with specific cell-surface receptors. Several candidate receptors for HCV have recently been proposed. Molecules like the CD81 tetraspanin (7Pileri P. Uematsu Y. Campagnoli S. Galli G. Falugi F. Petracca R. Weiner A.J. Houghton M.

A. 2004; 101: 7270-7274Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), the contribution of SR-BI in HCV entry needs to be further characterized. SR-BI is a 509-amino acid glycoprotein with two cytoplasmic C- and N-terminal domains separated by a large extracellular domain. SR-BI is a physiologically relevant lipoprotein receptor (20Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 21Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M.H. Rigotti A. Iqbal S.N. Edelman E.R. Krieger M. Nature. 1997; 387: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar) responsible for selective uptake of cholesteryl ester from high density lipoproteins (HDLs). SR-BI mediated cholesteryl ester selective uptake is a two-step mechanism implying binding of lipoproteins to its extracellular domain followed by lipid exchange at the plasma membrane. SR-BI proteins are mainly expressed in the liver and steroidogenic tissues, where cholesterol-selective uptake supplies cholesterol for biliary secretion and steroid hormone synthesis (22Connelly M.A. Williams D.L. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2004; 15: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). HDLs also play a key role in removing excess of cholesterol from peripheral tissues via the second HDL receptor, the ATP binding cassette transporter A1 receptor, and transporting it to liver cells to be taken by SR-BI. Several studies indicate that HCV particles isolated from patients can be found in association with plasma lipoproteins like LDLs and HDLs (10Agnello V. Abel G. Elfahal M. Knight G.B. Zhang Q.-X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12766-12771Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 23Andre P. Komurian-Pradel F. Deforges S. Perret M. Berland J.L. Sodoyer M. Pol S. Brechot C. Paranhos-Baccala G. Lotteau V. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 6919-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear how lipoproteins and their respective receptors contribute to HCV entry. Therefore, we sought to clarify the role of lipoproteins in HCV entry by using the HCVpp model. We show that HDLs, but not LDLs nor lipid-free HDL apolipoproteins, are able to markedly enhance entry of HCVpps. Drugs inhibiting transfer of HDL cholesteryl ester also reduce HCVpp entry. In addition, our data show that enhancement of HCVpp entry is dependent on SR-BI expression and on the presence of the SR-BI binding region on HCV envelope glycoproteins. Altogether, these data reveal the active role of lipoproteins in HCV entry through a complex interplay between SR-BI, HDL, and HCV envelope glycoproteins. Drugs, Proteins, and Antibodies—Block lipid transport (BLT)-2 and BLT-4 (ChemBridge, Chicago, IL) were used as described previously (24Nieland T.J. Penman M. Dori L. Krieger M. Kirchhausen T. Proc.

Lipoproteins and Lipoprotein-depleted Serum (LPDS) Preparation— Human HDL2 (density 1.09–1.11 g/ml), HDL3 (density 1.13–1.18 g/ml), and LDL (density 1.050–1.063 g/ml) fractions from fresh human plasma and lipoprotein-depleted serum (LPDS, density >1.25 g/ml) from fetal bovine serum were isolated by KBr density gradient ultracentrifugation as described previously (27Hatch F.T. Adv. Lipid Res. 1968; 6: 1-68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lipoproteins and LPDS fractions were extensively dialyzed against 0.1× PBS, 150 mm NaCl and sterile-filtered. Cell Cultures—293T human embryo kidney cells (HEK293T) and Huh-7 human hepatoma (28Nakabayashi H. Taketa K. Miyano K. Yamane T. Sato J. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 3858-3863PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Production of HCVpps and Infection Assays—Pseudotyped particles were produced as described previously (5Bartosch B. Dubuisson J. Cosset F.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar), and plasmids were kindly provided by B. Bartosch and F. L. Cosset (INSERM U412, Lyon, France). Briefly, 293T cells were co-transfected with a murine leukemia virus Gag-Pol packaging construct, a murine leukemia virus-based transfer vector encoding luciferase (29Op De Beeck A. Voisset C. Bartosch B. Ciczora Y. Cocquerel L. Keck Z. Foung S. Cosset F.L. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2994-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and an envelope glycoprotein expressing vector, phCMV-E1E2 (5Bartosch B. Dubuisson J. Cosset F.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar), using a PEI Exgen 500-based protocol (Euromedex). For some experiments a deletion was made in the hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) present at the N terminus of HCV glycoprotein E2 (phCMV-ΔHVR1). For this construct the 106-bp fragment covering the N terminus of E2 deleted of the HVR1 region (amino acids 384–411) was supplied by Genaert (Regensburg, Germany) and subcloned into the phCMV-E2 plasmid (5Bartosch B. Dubuisson J. Cosset F.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). The phCMV-G and phCMV-RD114 (30Sandrin V. Boson B. Salmon P. Gay W. Ne ̀gre D. Le Grand R. Trono D. Cosset F.-L. Blood. 2002; 100: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) expression vectors encode the VSV-G protein and the feline endogenous virus RD114 glycoprotein, respectively. Pseudotyped particles harboring VSV-G or RD114 envelope glycoproteins onto murine leukemia virus cores were used as controls in most of our experiments. Supernatants containing the pseudotyped particles were harvested 48 h after transfection, filtered through 0.45-μm pore-sized membranes, and 25 μl of HCVpps, VSV-Gpps (dilution 1:15), and RD114pps (dilution 1:30) were used in infection assays. Pseudotyped particles were added to 20,000 Huh-7 cells seeded the day before in 24-well plates and incubated for 3–6 h at 37 °C in the indicated medium. Culture medium was then replaced by 4% LPDS, and luciferase assays were performed as indicated by the manufacturer 3 days later (Promega). Immunoprecipitation Assay—Immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described previously (31Dubuisson J. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 778-786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HDLs (30 μg/ml) preincubated in the presence or in absence of HCVpps at 37 °C were immunoprecipitated using anti-apoA-I antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were extensively washed with PBS, eluted in Laemmli buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-apoA-I, anti-Gag, anti-E1, and anti-E2 antibodies. GNA Pull Down—After 3 h of incubation in the presence or in absence of HDLs (30 μg/ml) at 37 °C, HCVpps were pulled down with lectin from Galanthus nivalis immobilized by cross-linking on agarose beads (Sigma). Particles produced in the absence of envelope proteins were used as a negative control. After 1 h of contact at 4 °C, the beads were extensively washed with PBS, and pulled down proteins were eluted with 1 m methyl-α-d-mannopyranoside. Eluted proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Gag, anti-E1, anti-E2, and anti-apoA-I antibodies. RNA Interference Assay—Small interfering RNA (siRNA) pseudotyped particles were generated by co-transfecting 293T cells with three plasmids using a PEI Exgen 500-based protocol (Euromedex); a human immunodeficiency virus-1 Gag-Pol packaging construct, a VSV-G envelop glycoprotein-expressing vector, and a bicistronic lentiviral vector, FG12 (32Qin X.F. An D.S. Chen I.S. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), allowing the expression of a green fluorescent marker protein to control the transduction efficiencies and the expression of the siRNA directed against human SR-BI mRNA (33Calvo D. Vega M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18929-18935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bicistronic lentiviral vectors containing the siRNA sequences (5′-GCAGCAGGUCCUUAAGAAC (siRNA-2) and 5′-GGACCCCCUUGUGAAUCUC (siRNA-23)) were kindly provided by D. Lavillette and F. L. Cosset (INSERM U412, Lyon, France). siRNA2 has been shown to reduce SR-BI expression, whereas siRNA23 did not and was, therefore, used as a negative control (34Lavillette D. Tarr A.W. Voisset C. Donot P. Bartosch B. Patel A.H. Dubuisson J. Ball J.K. Cosset F.L. Hepatology. 2005; 41: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Huh-7 cells were infected with siRNA pseudotyped particles, treated with trypsin 3 days later, plated in 24-well plates, and infected 24 h later by HCVpps or VSV-Gpps as described above. Sucrose Gradient Fractionation—HCVpps and LPDS-HDLs were analyzed by an overnight centrifugation in a 20–60% sucrose gradient at 35,000 rpm and 4 °C in a Beckman SW 41 rotor. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and concentrated by ultracentrifugation through a 20% sucrose cushion in a TLA 100 Beckman rotor (42,000 rpm, 2 h). Viral pellets were suspended in 130 μl of Laemmli buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Immunoblotting Analysis—Huh-7 cells lysates (lysis buffer Promega E153A) and viral pellets were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked for 1 h in PBS-I-M (PBS containing 0.1% IGEPAL and 5% nonfat dried milk) and then probed overnight with antibodies diluted in PBS-I-M. Antibody binding to protein was detected with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase using enhanced chemiluminescence as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). HDLs Enhance HCVpp Infectivity—Recent data are in favor of a potential role for SR-BI in HCV entry. Indeed, a soluble form of HCV envelope glycoprotein E2 has been shown to specifically interact with human SR-BI (8Scarselli E. Ansuini H. Cerino R. Roccasecca R.M. Acali S. Filocamo G. Traboni C. Nicosia A. Cortese R. Vitelli A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5017-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). In addition, antibodies directed against SR-BI strongly reduce the infectivity of HCV pseudotyped particles (17Bartosch B. Vitelli A. Granier C. Goujon C. Dubuisson J. Pascale S. Scarselli E. Cortese R. Nicosia A. Cosset F.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41624-41630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Because HDL is a natural ligand for SR-BI, we wondered whether this lipoprotein might have some inhibitory effect on HCVpp entry by competing with HCVpp binding. We, therefore, compared the infectivity of HCVpps in the presence or absence of HDL. LDL, the other major human plasma lipoprotein, was used as a control because SR-BI is not a receptor for LDL. Surprisingly, we observed a 3-fold increase in the efficiency of HCVpp entry in the presence of HDLs (Fig. 1A). This marked increase in HCVpps was specific of HDL, as no stimulating or enhancing effect was observed in the presence of LDL. In addition, HDL had no effect on VSV-G and RD114 pseudotyped particles infectivity (Fig. 1A and data not shown). Because these pseudotyped particles only differ in their envelope glycoproteins and, thus, in their receptor usage, these data indicate that HDL-mediated enhancement of infectivity is specific of the presence of HCV envelope glycoproteins on the pseudotyped particles. The active concentrations of HDLs used in our experiments (1–30 μg/ml) were usually lower than that in normal human serum (∼1 mg/ml); however, they are in agreement with those generally used to study HDL binding and cholesterol influx and efflux. In contrast to HCVpps, VSV-Gpps were less infectious in the presence of LDL. This suggests that LDLs might compete with VSV-G receptor or reduce its expression. Alternatively, LDLs might reduce VSV-Gpp fusogenic activity by modifying the lipid composition at the site of entry. Human HDLs represent a mixture of lipoproteins that differ in size, composition, and apolipoprotein content (35Lund-Katz S. Liu L. Thuahnai S.T. Phillips M.C. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8: 1044-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). HDLs can be fractionated into subclasses by different techniques according to their physicochemical properties. Based on their density, HDLs have been divided into two subfractions, HDL2 (1.063–1.125 g/ml) and HDL3 (1.125–1.21 g/ml). HDL2, which are larger than HDL3, preferentially bind to SR-BI and potentially display an increased cholesteryl ester uptake than HDL3 (36de Beer M.C. Durbin D.M. Cai L. Jonas A. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 309-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, both HDL2 and HDL3 subclasses enhanced HCVpp entry; however, the effect was stronger with HDL3. These data do not strictly correlate with the cholesteryl ester uptake capacity of HDL2 and HDL3, but one cannot exclude a possible interaction of HCVpps with HDLs at the cell surface involving a particular conformation of apoA-I or a specific size. Altogether, our data indicate that HDLs facilitate HCVpp entry. HDLs Do Not Increase the Level of Expression of SR-BI— Because SR-BI is a putative receptor for HCV, a potential hypothesis to explain the enhancer effect of HDLs on HCVpp infectivity is that HDL increases the level of expression of SR-BI. To evaluate the possible modulation of SR-BI expression by lipoproteins, we analyzed the level of expression of SR-BI in the presence or absence of HDL. As shown in the inset Fig. 1A, the level of expression of SR-BI was not modified by the presence of lipoproteins, indicating that HDL enhancer effect on HCVpp infectivity is not related to an increase of SR-BI protein level in target cells. HDLs Do Not Interact with HCVpps in Culture Medium—In the plasma of HCV-infected patients, HCV particles can be found in association with lipoproteins (10Agnello V. Abel G. Elfahal M. Knight G.B. Zhang Q.-X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12766-12771Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 23Andre P. Komurian-Pradel F. Deforges S. Perret M. Berland J.L. Sodoyer M. Pol S. Brechot C. Paranhos-Baccala G. Lotteau V. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 6919-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). We wanted, therefore, to determine whether HDLs might work as a carrier that would be used by HCVpps to bind to the SR-BI receptor. HCVpp preincubated or not with HDLs were analyzed by sedimentation through a sucrose gradient to determine whether HDLs would modify the sedimentation profile of HCVpps, which would be an indication that these viral particles interact with the lipoproteins. As shown in Fig. 2, HCVpps produced in lipoproteins depleted serum LPDS (Fig. 2A), or LPDS-HDL medium (Fig. 2B) had the same sedimentation profile. They were indeed detected in fractions 7 to 9 (around 40% sucrose), where their constitutive proteins were detected (i.e. E1, E2, Gag). The sedimentation profile of apoA-I protein, the major apolipoprotein of HDL, was similar in the presence or absence of HCVpps. Indeed, this protein was detected mainly in fractions 2–5 whether or not the HCVpps were present (Fig. 2C). These data show that HCVpp and HDL interaction in culture medium, if any, is not strong enough to allow the co-sedimentation of HDLs and HCVpps on a sucrose gradient. Co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays were also performed to evaluate the possible interaction of HCVpps with HDLs in a gentler way. Using anti-apoA-I antibodies, HDLs preincubated with HCVpps were immunoprecipitated, but no HCV envelope glycoproteins were coprecipitated with HDLs (data not shown). On the other hand, HCVpps preincubated with HDLs were pulled down with Galanthus nivalis, a lectin that is known to interact with E2 glycans (37Ralston R. Thudium K. Berger K. Kuo C. Gervase B. Hall J. Selby M. Kuo G. Houghton M. Choo Q.-L. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6753-6761Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas HCVpps were pulled down and specifically eluted, no apoA-I protein was detected (data not shown). In another approach to determine whether HDLs can be a carrier that targets HCVpps to their receptor, we analyzed HDL enhancement of infectivity by adding HDLs during or after adsorption of HCVpps to host cells at 4 °C. If HDLs are carriers to target HCVpps to their receptor, there should be no enhancement of infectivity if HDLs are added after HCVpp binding. Importantly, a 5-fold increase in HCVpp infectivity was observed when HDLs were added after binding of HCVpps to Huh-7 cells, whereas co-binding of HCVpps and HDLs only induced a 1.7-fold increase in HCVpp infectivity (Fig. 3). This indicates that HDL enhancement of infectivity occurs after HCVpp binding to their target cells. Altogether, these data indicate that HDLs and HCVpps do not interact before binding to the cell surface and that HDLs are not carriers that target HCVpps to their receptor. Lipid-free ApoA-I and ApoA-II Are Unable to Enhance HCVpp Entry—HDLs contain lipids and apolipoproteins. ApoA-I and apoA-II are the major protein components of these particles and are, therefore, SR-BI ligands. To determine whether ligand binding on SR-BI is sufficient to enhance the efficiency of HCVpp entry, we evaluated the effect of HDLs versus lipid-free apoA-I and apoA-II proteins. Although apoA-I and apoA-II are known to have a lower affinity for SR-BI compared with their lipoprotein complex form (38Liu T. Krieger M. Kan H.Y. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21576-21584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), they are nevertheless natural SR-BI ligands. In contrast to native HDL, apoA-I and apoA-II were unable to enhance HCVpp entry (Fig. 4). In addition, neither apoA-I nor apoA-II competed with HDLs for enhancement of HCVpp infectivity (data not shown). These data indicate that lipid-free apoA-I and apoA-II are unable to enhance HCVpp entry. Lipid Transfer Inhibitors Affect HDL-mediated Enhancement of HCVpp Infectivity—SR-BI is a lipoprotein receptor responsible for selective uptake of cholesteryl ester from HDLs (22Connelly M.A. Williams D.L. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2004; 15: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and inhibitors of lipid transfer mediated by SR-BI have recently been described (24Nieland T.J. Penman M. Dori L. Krieger M. Kirchhausen T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15422-15427Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In order to evaluate the implication of the cholesteryl ester transfer properties of SR-BI on HCVpp entry, we analyzed the effects of two drugs, BLT-2 and BLT-4 (24Nieland T.J. Penman M. Dori L. Krieger M. Kirchhausen T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15422-15427Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), on HDL-mediated enhancement of HCVpp infectivity. BLT-2 and BLT-4 have recently been discovered on the basis of their capacity to inhibit cholesteryl ester transfer via SR-BI (24Nieland T.J. Penman M. Dori L. Krieger M. Kirchhausen T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15422-15427Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In the absence of HDL, BLT-2 reduced HCVpp and VSV-Gpp infectivity (Fig"
https://openalex.org/W2094054841,"Inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) has been implicated in many human diseases including insulin resistance. However, how iNOS causes or exacerbates insulin resistance remains largely unknown. Protein S-nitrosylation is now recognized as a prototype of a redox-dependent, cGMP-independent signaling component that mediates a variety of actions of nitric oxide (NO). Here we describe the mechanism of inactivation of Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) in NO donor-treated cells and diabetic (db/db) mice. NO donors induced S-nitrosylation and inactivation of Akt/PKB in vitro and in intact cells. The inhibitory effects of NO donor were independent of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and cGMP. In contrast, the concomitant presence of oxidative stress accelerated S-nitrosylation and inactivation of Akt/PKB. In vitro denitrosylation with reducing agent reactivated recombinant and cellular Akt/PKB from NO donor-treated cells. Mutated Akt1/PKBα (C224S), in which cysteine 224 was substituted by serine, was resistant to NO donor-induced S-nitrosylation and inactivation, indicating that cysteine 224 is a major S-nitrosylation acceptor site. In addition, S-nitrosylation of Akt/PKB was increased in skeletal muscle of diabetic (db/db) mice compared with wild-type mice. These data suggest that S-nitrosylation-mediated inactivation may contribute to the pathogenesis of iNOS- and/or oxidative stress-involved insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2011073601,"Cationic antimicrobial peptides serve as the first chemical barrier between all organisms and microbes. One of their main targets is the cytoplasmic membrane of the microorganisms. However, it is not yet clear why some peptides are active against one particular bacterial strain but not against others. Recent studies have suggested that the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) outer membrane is the first protective layer that actually controls peptide binding and insertion into Gram-negative bacteria. In order to shed light on these interactions, we synthesized and investigated a 12-mer amphipathic alpha-helical antimicrobial peptide (K(5)L(7)) and its diastereomer (4D-K(5)L(7)) (containing four d-amino acids). Interestingly, although both peptides strongly bind LPS bilayers and depolarize bacterial cytoplasmic membranes, only the diastereomer kills Gram-negative bacteria. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared, CD, and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopies revealed that only the diastereomer penetrates the LPS layer. In contrast, K(5)L(7) binds cooperatively to the polysaccharide chain and the outer phosphate groups. As a result, the self-associated K(5)L(7) is unable to traverse through the tightly packed LPS molecules, revealed by epifluorescence studies with LPS giant unilamellar vesicles. The difference in the peptides' modes of binding is further demonstrated by the ability of the diastereomer to induce LPS miscellization, as shown by transmission electron microscopy. In addition to increasing our understanding of the molecular basis of the protection of bacteria by LPS, this study presents a potential strategy to overcome resistance by LPS, and it should help in the design of antimicrobial peptides for future therapeutic purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2078392705,"The cytosol of mammalian cells is a crowded environment containing soluble proteins and a network of cytoskeletal filaments. Gene delivery by synthetic vectors involves the endocytosis of DNA-polycation complexes, escape from endosomes, and diffusion of non-complexed DNA through the cytosol to reach the nucleus. We found previously that the translational diffusion of large DNAs (>250 bp) in cytoplasm was greatly slowed compared with that of smaller DNAs (Lukacs, G. L., Haggie, P., Seksek, O., Lechardeur, D., Freedman, N., and Verkman, A. S. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 1625–1629). To determine the mechanisms responsible for size-dependent DNA diffusion, we used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to measure the diffusion of single fluorophore-labeled DNAs in crowded solutions, cytosol extracts, actin network, and living cells. DNA diffusion (D) in solutions made crowded with Ficoll-70 (up to 40 weight percentage) or soluble cytosol extracts (up to 100 mg/ml) relative to diffusion of the same sized DNAs in saline (D/Do) was approximately independent of DNA size (20–4500 bp), quite different from the strong reduction in D/Do in the cytoplasm of living cells. However, the reduced D/Do with increasing DNA size was closely reproduced in solutions containing cross-linked actin filaments assembled with gelsolin, whereas soluble macromolecules of the same size and concentration did not reduce D/Do. In intact cells microinjected with fluorescent DNAs and studied by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy or photobleaching methods, D/Do was reduced by 5–150-fold (20–6000 bp); however, the size-dependent reduction in D/Do was abolished after actin cytoskeleton disruption.

Gene delivery by non-viral vectors is a complex and inefficient process that involves cellular internalization by endocytosis, escape from endosomes, DNA-polycation dissociation, and diffusion of non-complexed DNA in the cytoplasm to reach the nucleus (1Zuber G.

DNA diffusion in the cytoplasm and nuclear import are believed to be rate-limiting determinants of transgene delivery, extending the time that non-complexed DNA is exposed to cytosolic DNases. Remarkably, <0.1% of DNA microinjected into the cytosol is ultimately expressed (4Dowty M.E. Williams P. Zhang G. Hagstrom J.E. Wolff J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4572-4576Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 5Pollard H. Remy J.S. Loussouarn G. Demolombe S. Behr J.P. Escande D. J. Biol.

We measured previously the mobility of differently sized DNAs in cytoplasm by photobleaching cells after microinjection with fluorescently labeled DNAs (6Lukacs G.L. Haggie P. Seksek O. Lechardeur D. Freedman N. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1625-1629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). The principal finding was that DNA diffusion in cytoplasm (Dcyto) was modestly slowed compared with that in saline (Do) (Dcyto/Do ∼ 0.2) for small DNA fragments of <250 bp but was greatly reduced (Dcyto/Do < 0.05) for larger DNAs of >250 bp such as plasmid-sized DNAs. In contrast, the diffusion of dextrans and Ficolls, which are considered to be non-interacting macromolecules, was only mildly dependent on their size up to 500–1000 kDa (7Seksek O. Biwersi J. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), which is equivalent in molecular mass to a 750–1500-bp DNA fragment. Identification of the mechanism of reduced mobility of large DNAs in cytoplasm has important consequences regarding intrinsic limitations of non-viral gene delivery and in developing strategies to improve its efficacy. Several factors can in principle reduce the diffusion of a solute in cytoplasm versus saline, including fluid phase viscosity, binding, and crowding by mobile and immobile macromolecules (8Verkman A.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 27-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Systematic analysis of the diffusion of a small fluorescein-like molecule in cytoplasm indicated that reduced diffusion in cytoplasm (Dcyto/Do ∼ 0.25) resulted mainly from macromolecular crowding by the relatively high concentration of proteins in cytoplasm of ∼100–150 mg/ml (reviewed in Refs. 9Ellis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 597-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar and 10Ellis R.J. Minton A.P. Nature. 2003; 425: 27-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Fluid phase viscosity, defined as the effective viscosity sensed by a small molecule that does not undergo binding or other macromolecular interactions, has little influence on cytoplasmic diffusion (11Fushimi K. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 12Luby-Phelps K. Mujumdar S. Mujumdar R.B. Ernst L.A. Galbraith W. Waggoner A.S. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 236-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Binding can greatly reduce apparent diffusion, as was found for some enzymes that assemble into macromolecular complexes (13Haggie P.M. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40782-40788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As a densely charged polyanion, DNA binding to cytoplasmic components could be an important factor in reducing its diffusion in cytoplasm as was found in the nucleus, where DNA is nearly immobile probably because of binding to positively charged histones (6Lukacs G.L.

BioEssays. 1992; 14: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). DNA diffusion in heterogeneous polydisperse media is further complicated by conformation effects resulting in persistence length and other size-dependent phenomena. Although theoretical descriptions exist in the polymer field for DNA conformational mechanics and electric field-dependent convection in gels (15De Gennes P.G. Scaling Concepts in Polymer Physics. Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY1979Google Scholar), the basis of the strong size dependence of DNA diffusion in cytoplasm is not clear on theoretical grounds. The purpose of this investigation was to establish the mechanism of the reduced diffusion of DNA in cytoplasm with increasing DNA size. Several possibilities were considered, including DNA binding to cytosolic components, molecular crowding by mobile obstacles, and restricted diffusion due to fixed structures. We used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy of DNAs labeled with a single fluorescent probe to measure DNA mobility at the single molecule level in crowded solutions and living cells, as well as photobleaching recovery of multiply labeled DNAs in cells. Based on a series of in vitro and cell measurements, we conclude that macromolecular crowding by fixed obstacles, mainly the actin cytoskeleton, is the principal determinant of the size-dependent slowing of DNA diffusion in cytoplasm. Our results have important implications regarding limitations in gene transfer using non-viral vectors. Fluorescently Labeled DNAs—Linear double-stranded DNAs of different sizes containing a single rhodamine green molecule were generated by PCR using pcDNA 3.1 as the template. DNAs in sizes of 100, 250, 500, 1000, 3000, and 4500 bp were generated by using a common 5′-end rhodamine green-labeled primer (5′-ATCGCTATTACCATGGTGATGCGGTTTTGG-3′) and specific 3′-end primers for each size. The amplified single fluorophore-labeled DNAs were purified by ethanol precipitation and gel filtration and concentrated on Centricon 30 or 100 filters. Rhodamine green-labeled dextrans were prepared as described previously (16Dauty E. Verkman A.S. J. Mol. Recognit. 2004; 17: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The 20-mer (5′-TATTATCTAGACTCGAGTTA-3′) and the 50-mer (5′-AAATTGATGCGACAGTCAGACCCAGTGTATTAAATATAACAATAGTAATT-3′) primers containing a 5′-end rhodamine green label were synthesized by Invitrogen along with unlabeled complementary sequences for annealing to give double-stranded DNA. For photobleaching experiments, DNAs were fluorescently labeled with the bis-intercalating dye YOYO®-3 (Molecular Probes). One YOYO®-3 molecule per 100 bp DNA was found to be optimal for photobleaching studies. In Vitro Sample Preparation—Labeled DNAs and dextrans (10 kDa and 500 kDa) were dissolved at concentrations of 1–100 nm in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. In some experiments, the solutions contained Ficoll-70 (0–40 weight percentage), cytosol (0–100 mg/ml), actin (0–8 mg/ml), or actin/gelsolin (actin 8 mg/ml; gelsolin 0.04 mg/ml). Cytosol was prepared from mouse liver. After perfusion, livers were homogenized in buffer containing 320 mm sucrose, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), and several protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml pepstatin, leupeptin, aprotinin, and 50 μm Pefabloc®). The homogenate was centrifuged at 10000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 100000 × g for 1 h to separate membranes from the cytosol. All steps were done at 4 °C. Protein concentration was assayed with a BCA protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Cytosol was frozen and stored at –80 °C in the presence of 2 mm EDTA until use (17Pollard H. Toumaniantz G. Amos J.L. Avet-Loiseau H. Guihard G. Behr J.P. Escande D. J. Gene Med. 2001; 3: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Cytosol at 100 mg/ml was obtained from 60 mg/ml cytosol by evaporation. For actin-containing solutions, lyophilized rabbit skeletal muscle G-actin protein (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO) (in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.2 mm sodium ATP, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 5% sucrose, and 1% dextran) was mixed with DNAs in a total volume of 10 μl in a plastic tube. For actin/gelsolin-containing solutions, G-actin protein (in stock buffer) was mixed with lyophilized human plasma gelsolin (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO) in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, and 50 mm NaCl at a molar ratio of 400:1. Polymerization was initiated by adding KCl to 50 mm, MgCl2 to 2 mm, and ATP to 1 mm using a small volume of a concentrated stock solution, and the sample was mixed using a micropipette and allowed to stand for 20 min. For fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) 1The abbreviations used are: FCS, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy; D, DNA diffusion coefficient; Dcyto, D in cytoplasm; Do, D in saline. measurements, 5 μl of solutions were sandwiched between two glass coverslips and transferred to the microscope stage. Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy—FCS measurements were performed on a Nikon TE-200 inverted epifluorescence microscope equipped with laser diode excitation source (488 nm, 20 milliwatt; Coherent Inc.), neutral density filter wheel, 100× oil objective (Nikon S Fluor, NA 1.3), 510-nm dichroic mirror, and 535 ± 25 bandpass emission filter (Chroma). Fluorescence was collected by a 100-μm-diameter fiberoptic patch cord mounted on a three-axis micropositioner and detected by an avalanche photodiode (<50 counts per minute of dark noise; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Photon counts were correlated online using an ALV-5000 correlator card. Data recording times were 30–1500 s. Autocorrelation functions, G(τ), were binned and displayed on a quasi-logarithmic time scale. Correlation times, τc, were computed from G(τ) (18Rigler R. Mets U. Widengren J. Kask P. Eur. Biophys. J. 1993; 22: 169-175Crossref Scopus (879) Google Scholar) as shown in Equation 1,[G(τ)=N−1⋅[1+(τ/τc)]−1⋅[1+(τ/(κ2⋅τc))]−0.5(Eq. 1) where N is fluorophore number density in the detection volume, τ is time, and τc is the characteristic diffusion time for an ellipsoidal excitation volume (τc = z20/4D), and κ (set to 16) is the ratio of axial (zo) and equatorial (wo) radii of the focal volume. Diffusion coefficients were determined from fitted τc using a rhodamine green solution as standard (diffusion coefficient of 2.8 × 10–6 cm2/s; Ref. 18Rigler R. Mets U. Widengren J. Kask P. Eur. Biophys. J. 1993; 22: 169-175Crossref Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Generally, data from 10–40 individual G(τ) curves were averaged. Measurements were done at 23 °C in a temperature-controlled darkroom on a vibration isolation table. Photobleaching Experiments—Spot photobleaching measurements were carried out on an apparatus consisting of an argon ion laser (488 nm; Coherent Inc.), a high contrast acousto-optic modulator, and an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Diaphot, Nikon) equipped with an objective lens (20× dry, numerical aperture 0.75, or 60× oil immersion, numerical aperture 1.4; Nikon) and a 510-nm dichroic mirror (13Haggie P.M. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40782-40788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Emitted fluorescence was filtered by serial interference (530 ± 15 nm) and cut-on (>515 nm) filters and detected by a gated photomultiplier and 14-bit analog-to-digital converter. For most experiments, the laser beam power was set to 50–100 milliwatts, and the attenuation ratio (the ratio of bleach to probe beam intensity) was ∼5000 to give <30% bleach. Data from 10–15 individual recovery curves were averaged, each obtained from a different spot. Diffusion coefficients (in cm2/s) were determined from t½ values derived by non-linear regression (13Haggie P.M. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40782-40788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) using a fluorescein solution as standard (diffusion coefficient of 2.8 × 10–6 cm2/s; Ref. 18Rigler R. Mets U. Widengren J. Kask P. Eur. Biophys. J. 1993; 22: 169-175Crossref Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Microinjection—HeLa cells were cultured in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Solutions for microinjection consisted of calcium-free PBS containing 0.5–1 μg/μl rhodamine green-labeled DNA. Solutions were centrifuged (14000 × g for 10 min) to remove particulate matter. Microinjection was performed using an Eppendorf 5170 micromanipulator and 5242 microinjector. Glass needles were drawn from thin-walled filament capillaries (FHC, Brunswick, ME) with a vertical needle puller (Kopf, Tujunga, CA). Cells grown on 18-mm-diameter round glass coverslips were microinjected (generally ∼200 cells injected on each coverglass) at an injection pressure of 120 kilopascals over 1 s. Cell Experiments—In some experiments, the actin cytoskeleton was disrupted using cytochalasin D (5 μm) or latrunculin B (10 μm) added 15 min prior to and during experiments. For actin staining, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and stained with rhodamine phalloidin. Confocal fluorescence images were acquired using a Leitz upright fluorescence microscope equipped with a coaxial-confocal attachment and a 100× objective. Characterization of DNA Fragments Containing a Single Fluorescent Label—Linear double-stranded DNAs containing a single fluorescent label were prepared by PCR using a 5′-rhodamine green labeled primer and different 3′-end primers to amplify DNAs of specified sizes (Fig. 1A). The size, integrity, and purity of the linear DNAs after purification were confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining and by rhodamine green fluorescence (Fig. 1B). The rhodamine green chromophore was used as a fluorescent probe for FCS measurements because of its photostability and absence of significant photophysical phenomena (such as triplet state relaxation and flicker) under the conditions of our experiments and its suitable excitation spectrum for diode laser excitation. Diffusion coefficients of the rhodamine green-labeled DNAs were measured by FCS. Representative normalized autocorrelation curves, G(τ)/G(0), are shown in Fig. 1C. Data for all DNAs fitted well to the model in Equation 1 containing a single correlation time, τc (residence time in the illuminated region), indicating simple (non-anomalous) diffusion. Correlation times increased with DNA molecular size, with τc increasing from 0.7 ± 0.1 ms (mean ± S.D.) for 20-bp DNA to 28 ± 5 ms for 4.5-kb DNA. Control experiments were done for each DNA to confirm the validity of τc values, including showing independence of τc on 4-fold changes in illumination intensity and concentration and the absence of photobleaching over the duration of data acquisition. Fig. 1D summarizes deduced translational diffusion coefficients as a function of DNA molecular size on a log-log plot with an empirical linear fit, Do = 6.5 × 10–6 cm2/s· (base pair)–0.68 ± 0.04 (r2 = 0.999). The fitted slope is in agreement with the slope of 0.70 predicted from the theory of Yamakawa and Fujii (19Yamakawa H. Fujii M. J. Chem. Phys. 1976; 64: 5222-5228Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar) for helical worm-like molecular chains without excluded volume. An alternative model (20Tirado M. Garcia de la Torre J. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 2581-2587Crossref Scopus (351) Google Scholar) also fitted the data well; the dashed curve labeled model (Fig. 1D) was computed from the equation of Tirado and Garcia de la Torre, Do = (kBT/3ηπ L)(ln p + ν), where ν = 0.312 + 0.565/p – 0.1/p2 is a correction factor for end effect, p = L/d is the ratio of DNA length to diameter, kBT is the product of Boltzmann constant and temperature, and η is medium viscosity. The poorly fitting dashed line labeled sphere (Fig. 1D) is shown for comparison and was computed for spherical molecules of equivalent molecular weight to the DNAs. Macromolecular Crowding Effects on DNA Diffusion—DNA diffusion was measured in solutions made crowded with various soluble (mobile) and fixed (immobile) macromolecules to establish the determinants of size-dependent DNA diffusion. Diffusion coefficients for DNAs were measured first in saline solutions made crowded with the soluble “crowding agent” Ficoll-70 (0–40 weight percentage). As in many prior studies of molecular crowding effects (9Ellis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 597-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar, 21van den Berg B. Ellis R.J. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6927-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), Ficoll-70 was chosen as a non-interacting, compact synthetic polysaccharide that is highly soluble and produces solutions with relatively low macroscopic viscosity. Fig. 2A shows an exponential dependence of D on Ficoll-70 concentration, D = Do exp(–[C]/[C]exp), where [C]exp is the Ficoll-70 concentration (in weight percentage) at which Do is reduced by 63%. Interestingly, [C]exp was nearly identical for the very different size DNAs. Even though D/Do was reduced substantially (∼6-fold at 200 mg/ml Ficoll-70), D/Do did not depend on the DNA size (Fig. 2B), indicating that crowding by a mobile, non-interacting macromolecule cannot reproduce the reduced size-dependent DNA diffusion in cells. Similar FCS measurements of DNA diffusion were done using soluble cytosol extracts that are highly polydisperse and contain various proteins that might interact with and slow DNA diffusion. From photobleaching measurements of the diffusion of small molecules and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextrans, the effective concentration of obstacles (including mobile and immobile macromolecules) in cytosol is ∼100–120 mg/ml (7Seksek O. Biwersi J. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 22Kao H.P. Abney J.R. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 23Hou L. Lanni F. Luby-Phelps K. Biophys. J. 1990; 58: 31-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Fig. 2C shows normalized FCS data for the diffusion of 100-bp and 1-kb DNA in low (8 mg protein/ml) and high (100 mg protein/ml) concentrations of cytosol. Although the autocorrelation functions in cytosol generally showed relaxation phenomena at very early times that may be related to intrinsic cytosol fluorescence or triplet state phenomena, the data at longer times fitted well to the single component simple diffusion model with a single correlation time. Although cytosol reduced DNA diffusion coefficients in a concentration-dependent manner as expected, D/Do was not reduced with increasing DNA size (Fig. 2D) even at 100 mg/ml cytosol, where DNA diffusion was reduced by ∼5-fold. Thus, DNA interactions with soluble cytosolic macromolecules cannot account for the size-dependent DNA diffusion found in the cytoplasm in living cells. In addition to soluble proteins and macromolecules, the cell cytoplasm contains a network of cytoskeletal filaments, among which microfilamentous F-actin appears to be the most prominent (24Medalia O. Weber I. Frangakis A.S. Nicastro D. Gerisch G. Baumeister W. Science. 2002; 298: 1209-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). To test whether an actin network could account for the size-dependent DNA diffusion, an actin mesh was generated in vitro using purified actin at concentrations found in cells (5–12.5 mg/ml) (25Davies W.A. Stossel T.P. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 75: 941-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 26Hartwig J.H. Shevlin P. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1007-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) alone or together with the actin-binding protein gelsolin. D/Do was mildly reduced with DNA size at 1 mg/ml actin and substantially reduced at 8 mg/ml of actin alone or together with gelsolin (Fig. 3). For each actin concentration, DNA diffusion coefficients were at least 10–100-fold higher than the diffusion coefficients for polymerized actin filaments (<10–11 cm2/s; Ref. 27Tait J.F. Frieden C. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3666-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), making the actin mesh effectively immobile on the time scale of DNA diffusion. For comparison, the diffusion of rhodamine green-labeled dextrans (10 and 500 kDa) in 1 and 8 mg/ml actin networks is shown. Both dextrans (equivalent in molecular weight to 15-bp and 750-bp DNAs) diffused almost freely in the actin network, indicating little influence of the actin network on the diffusion of globular non-interacting macromolecules with 5–30 nm gyration radii (23Hou L. Lanni F. Luby-Phelps K. Biophys. J. 1990; 58: 31-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). DNA Diffusion in the Cytoplasm of Living Cells—FCS measurements in cells were conducted under the same conditions as in the in vitro experiments using a 100× objective lens, low laser illumination intensity (<0.2 milliwatt), and room temperature (to minimize nuclease-induced DNA degradation) (17Pollard H. Toumaniantz G. Amos J.L. Avet-Loiseau H. Guihard G. Behr J.P. Escande D. J. Gene Med. 2001; 3: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 28Lechardeur D. Sohn K.J. Haardt M. Joshi P.B. Monck M. Graham R.W. Beatty B. Squire J. O'Brodovich H. Lukacs G.L. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 482-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were microinjected with rhodamine green-labeled DNAs and kept at room temperature for 20 min prior to measurements. The laser spot was focused in an area of cytoplasm not directly adjacent to the nucleus or the cell membrane. In initial studies, FCS data were stable at ∼15–30 min after microinjection, but changes were seen at longer times or after 37 °C incubation, which may be related to nuclease-dependent generation of smaller degradation fragments. Representative FCS curves for 3-kb DNA are shown in Fig. 4A, and deduced D/Do values are summarized in Fig. 4B. For the larger DNAs (250–4500 bp), the fitting of correlation functions required a two-component model. The fit shows a fast correlation time, τc1 = 5–20 ms, which was independent of DNA size, and a slow correlation time, τc2, that depended on DNA size and cell maneuvers. The rapid correlation time component may be related to a small amount of degraded DNA, rhodamine green-related photophysics, and/or intramolecular DNA motion/local confinement effects in a heterogeneous environment. Other studies reported similar two-component models for the analysis of fluorescent macromolecule diffusion in cells (29Larson D.R. Ma Y.M. Vogt V.M. Webb W.W. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 30Schwille P. Korlach J. Webb W.W. Cytometry. 1999; 36: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 31Kim S.A. Heinze K.G. Waxham M.N. Schwille P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). As found previously in photobleaching measurements of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled DNAs (6Lukacs G.L. Haggie P. Seksek O. Lechardeur D. Freedman N. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1625-1629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), diffusion of DNA with a single rhodamine green as measured by FCS was remarkably reduced with increasing DNA size. To test the involvement of the actin cytoskeleton in the reduced DNA diffusion, FCS measurements were done in cells after actin skeletal disruption with cytochalasin D. Fig. 4B shows that actin skeletal disruption largely eliminated the size-dependent reduction in DNA diffusion, providing in vivo support for the conclusion from solution studies that the actin mesh is an important determinant of DNA diffusion. Fig. 4B also shows a curve labeled predicted that was computed from the product of the in vitro D/Do values in the cytosol (100 mg/ml) and the actin/gelsolin mesh. The “predicted” curve is in good agreement with D/Do measured experimentally in cells, consistent with the view of the cytoplasm as a crowded soluble phase surrounded by an entangled filament network. Because FCS is based on the analysis of fluorescence intensity fluctuations produced by the diffusion of molecules into and out of a defined excitation volume, the identification and quantification of a immobile population of molecules is not possible. Because of this limitation as well as the complexities in the interpretation of FCS data in living cells (see “Discussion”), photobleaching experiments were done to confirm the conclusion that the actin cytoskeleton is the main determinant of the reduced diffusion of DNA in cytoplasm. For these studies we used a novel labeling strategy to generate brightly fluorescent DNA fragments. DNAs (500 bp and 6000 bp) were labeled with the dimeric cyanine dye YOYO-3, which binds tightly to DNA (Kd∼100 nm) and undergoes a >100-fold fluorescence enhancement upon binding to DNA. Original fluorescence recovery curves after the photobleaching of 500- and 6000-bp YOYO-3-labeled DNAs in aqueous solution are shown in Fig. 5A. Recovery curves in microinjected HeLa cells are shown in Fig. 5B for untreated cells and after 30 min of cytochalasin D treatment. Compared with photobleaching data obtained in aqueous solution, the recoveries were slower in cytoplasm for both DNA fragments. As shown previously, the plasmid-sized DNA was largely immobile in the cytoplasm of microinjected HeLa cells, whereas the 500-bp DNA fragment was mobile. Cytochalasin D treatment of microinjected cells increased remarkably the percentage of plasmid-sized DNA that was mobile (from < 20% to >70%). Similar results were found using latrunculin B to disrupt the actin cytoskeleton (data not shown). In contrast, recovery curves were similar with or without cytochalasin D treatment for the smaller 500-bp DNA, supporting the conclusion that the actin cytoskeleton is the principal determinant of the slowed diffusion of plasmid-sized DNAs in cytoplasm. The goal of this work was to determine the mechanism of the reduced mobility of non-complexed DNAs in cytoplasm with increasing DNA size. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy was used to follow DNA diffusion in vitro and in living cells. We found that labeling with a single rhodamine green fluorophore was suitable for the investigation of DNA dynamics in complex and in crowded environments using FCS. The PCR-based labeling approach gave a uniform population of fluorescently labeled DNAs in near native form and is suitable for DNA labeling with a variety of fluorescent and other probes. The principal conclusion is that the actin mesh rather than cytoplasmic crowding by diffusible macromolecules provides the rate-limiting barrier for the cellular diffusion of large, non-complexed DNAs. The mechanism of size-dependent DNA diffusion in cytoplasm was investigated from measurements of DNA diffusion in artificial solutions containing a non-interacting crowding agent (Ficoll-70), concentrated soluble cytosolic extracts, and in vitro skeletal actin networks. Diffusion of DNA in solutions made crowded with Ficoll-70 could be reduced considerably compared with diffusion of the same sized DNA in saline. However, the DNA size-dependent reduction in D/Do could not be reproduced, indicating that molecular crowding by mobile obstacles cannot account for the observed reduction in D/Do in cells. Reduced D/Do with increasing DNA size also could not be reproduced in vitro in cytosol at a protein concentration similar to that in cells and in which DNA diffusion was slowed ∼5-fold compared with its diffusion in saline. Therefore, crowding effects and DNA interactions with soluble components of cell cytosol cannot account for the reduced D/Do. However, reduced D/Do with increasing DNA size could be reproduced in vitro in a polymerized actin/gelsolin mesh at a concentration found in cells (26Hartwig J.H. Shevlin P. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1007-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 32Niederman R. Amrein P.C. Hartwig J. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1400-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Diffusion of small DNAs (<250 bp) in the actin mesh was only mildly slowed with increasing size, whereas diffusion was slowed substantially in a size-dependent manner for DNAs >250 bp. In cells, the length of actin filaments has been estimated by electron microscopy to be 100–500 nm with an ∼100-nm spacing between actin filaments (32Niederman R. Amrein P.C. Hartwig J. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1400-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 33Stossel T.P. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 15s-21sCrossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It is interesting that the size-dependent transition found here occurs at DNA of ∼250 bp, which has an extended linear length of ∼85 nm. The intracellular diffusion coefficients of the larger DNAs (>500 bp) versus DNA size were fitted by a line (on a log-log plot) with slope of –1.8, which is consistent with the theory of de Gennes predicting D ∝ (DNA size)–2 for a single reptating chain in a medium containing fixed obstacles (15De Gennes P.G. Scaling Concepts in Polymer Physics. Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY1979Google Scholar). We thus propose that the entanglement of relatively large, flexible DNA fragments in the actin mesh is the primary mechanism responsible for the size-dependent reduction in DNA diffusion. D/Do in the presence of a combination of mobile obstacles and a polymerized actin/gelsolin mesh is, at first approximation, the product of D/Do for each mechanism. As such, DNA diffusion in cell cytoplasm was closely modeled as a product of D/Do measured in vitro in a cytosol extract at 100 mg/ml and a polymerized actin/gelsolin mesh. The mobile obstacles are responsible for a multiplicative factor giving comparable reduction in the diffusion of DNAs of all sizes, whereas the actin mesh is responsible for the size-dependent reduction in DNA diffusion. Our analysis thus provides a quantitative accounting for the observed DNA mobility in living cells with a predictive value in assessing the effects of altered protein concentration and skeletal density on DNA diffusion. Restricted diffusion of non-complexed DNA in cytoplasm is thought to be a key barrier to gene delivery in vivo, where DNA degradation competes with diffusion (1Zuber G. Dauty E. Nothisen M. Belguise P. Behr J.P. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2001; 52: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The release of non-complexed DNA into the cytoplasm was shown using the T7 polymerase expression system (34Gao X. Huang L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2867-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Because the lifetime of cytoplasmic DNA is relatively short (60–90 min) (28Lechardeur D. Sohn K.J. Haardt M. Joshi P.B. Monck M. Graham R.W. Beatty B. Squire J. O'Brodovich H. Lukacs G.L. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 482-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), the transport of DNA toward the nucleus should be as fast as possible for efficient transgene expression. The photobleaching studies here indicated that the diffusion of plasmid-sized DNA is very slow, with <20% of DNA being able to diffuse through the cytoplasm. However, disruption of the actin network increased both the mobile DNA fraction as well as its diffusivity. Viruses have evolved efficient DNA packaging and intracellular transport mechanisms to deliver their nucleic acids to the nucleus (35Smith A.E. Helenius A. Science. 2004; 304: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Because diffusion in the crowded cytoplasm is inefficient given the large size of most capsids, viruses often exploit the cytoskeleton and cellular motor proteins to move through the cell. As shown here for non-viral gene vectors, the actin cytoskeleton also poses a barrier against the inward movement of viruses that enter directly through the plasma membrane (36Pelkmans L. Puntener D. Helenius A. Science. 2002; 296: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). To overcome the skeletal barrier, some viruses such as SV40 activate tyrosine kinase-induced signaling cascades that lead to the local dissociation of filamentous actin. Because macromolecule-sized solutes with a gyration radius (RG) up to 30 nm are freely diffusible in the cytoplasm (7Seksek O. Biwersi J. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), strategies to increase DNA mobility, such as DNA compaction into spherical 30 nm-particles (37Dauty E. Remy J.S. Blessing T. Behr J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 9227-9234Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and active transport of the DNA toward the nucleus, are predicted to enhance the efficiency of transgene delivery (38Sebestyen M.G. Ludtke J.J. Bassik M.C. Zhang G. Budker V. Lukhtanov E.A. Hagstrom J.E. Wolff J.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 39Zanta M.A. Belguise-Valladier P. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). In summary, using the complementary fluorescence techniques of FCS and photobleaching, we have established a quantitative mechanism for the reduced translational diffusion of large, non-complexed DNAs in cell cytoplasm and identified the actin cytoskeleton as a new barrier for non-viral gene delivery. We thank Dr. Peter Haggie for helpful discussions and Dr. Yuanlin Song for advice in mouse liver preparation."

Increased ErbB2 activity is characteristic of several cancers and is responsible for many aspects of malignant cell behavior in these cancers. In this study we show that constitutively high levels of active, i.e. autophosphorylated, ErbB2 in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells and TA3/St mammary carcinoma cells are dependent on endogenous hyaluronan-CD44 interaction. Dependence on hyaluronan-CD44 interaction was demonstrated by the administration of hyaluronan oligomers, experimentally induced expression of soluble CD44, and small interfering RNA knockdown of CD44 expression. On the other hand, increasing hyaluronan production by overexpression of hyaluronan synthase 2 or emmprin causes elevated ErbB2 phosphorylation in MCF-7 mammary carcinoma cells, which normally exhibit low levels of ErbB2 activity. Furthermore, in HCT116 and TA3/St cells, inhibition of endogenous hyaluronan-CD44 interaction causes disassembly of a constitutive, lipid raft-associated, signaling complex containing phosphorylated ErbB2, CD44, ezrin, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and the chaperone molecules, Hsp90 and cdc37. Stimulation of hyaluronan production in MCF-7 cells induces assembly of this complex. We conclude that hyaluronan regulates ErbB2 activity and its interactions with other signaling factors in carcinoma cells. Hyaluronan is enriched in many types of human cancers, and manipulations of hyaluronan expression or interactions have a major influence on tumor progression in animal models.

We conclude that hyaluronan regulates ErbB2 activity and its interactions with other signaling factors in carcinoma cells. Hyaluronan is a multifunctional polysaccharide that is present in the extracellular and pericellular matrices of most tissues. Hyaluronan is enriched in matrices surrounding cells that are proliferating or migrating and influences cell behavior during embryonic development (1Toole B.P. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) and in cancer (2Toole B.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar). Like most extracellular matrix macromolecules, hyaluronan has important structural and signaling functions. The signaling functions of hyaluronan are mediated by cell surface receptors, especially CD44 and RHAMM (3Turley E.A. Noble P.W. Bourguignon L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4589-4592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar).

Likewise, biochemical studies have demonstrated that exogenously added hyaluronan promotes ErbB2 signaling in ovarian carcinoma cells via interactions between CD44, Grb2, Vav2, and ErbB2 (6Bourguignon L.Y.

In previous studies we have shown that interference with endogenous hyaluronan-CD44 interactions inhibits constitutive PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling in mammary carcinoma, colon carcinoma, and glioma cells (7Ghatak S.

Also, studies from several laboratories have shown that treatment of cells with exogenous hyaluronan (10Sohara Y. Ishiguro N. Machida K. Kurata H. Thant A.A. Senga T. Matsuda S. Kimata K. Iwata H.

Because ErbB2 activity is elevated in many malignant cancer cell types and because it regulates the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway (13Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5670) Google Scholar, 14Zhou B.P. Hung M.C. Semin. Oncol. 2003; 30: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we investigated whether hyaluronan constitutively regulates ErbB2 activity and influences the interactions of ErbB2 with other signaling components. Materials—Hyaluronan oligosaccharides (oligomers) (Anika Therapeutics, Inc., Woburn, MA) that were used in this study were a mixed fraction of average molecular weight ∼2.5 × 103 composed of 3–10 disaccharide units. No contaminants were detected in these oligomers by high pressure liquid chromatography or capillary electrophoresis. Assays for other glycosaminoglycans, protein, nucleic acids, and endotoxins were also negative (7Ghatak S. Misra S. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38013-38020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 15Zeng C. Toole B.P. Kinney S.D. Kuo J.W. Stamenkovic I. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Antibodies against total ErbB2 (extracellular domain), phosphorylated ErbB2, p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, ezrin, and Hsp90 were from Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY. Antibodies against human CD44 were from Calbiochem (catalog number 217594) or from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; antibody against p110α subunit of PI 3-kinase was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., and antibody against mouse CD44 (KM21) was from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Antibody against cdc37 was a gift from Dr. Nicholas Grammatikakis (16Grammatikakis N. Lin J.H. Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The secondary antibodies used were ECL anti-rabbit IgG (peroxidase-linked species-specific F(ab′)2 fragment from donkey) and ECL anti-mouse IgG (peroxidase-linked species-specific F(ab′)2 fragment from sheep) from Amersham Biosciences. Enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Unless specified, all other reagents were the highest grade from Sigma. Cell Culture—HCT 116 colon carcinoma cells were obtained from Dr. B. Vogelstein, Johns Hopkins Medical School. TA3/St mammary carcinoma cells were provided by Dr. H. F. Dvorak, Harvard Medical School, and maintained in our laboratory (17Yeo T.K. Nagy J.A. Yeo K.T. Dvorak H.F. Toole B.P. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 1733-1740PubMed Google Scholar). Stable transfectants of TA3/St cells, overexpressing soluble CD44, mutated soluble CD44, or vector only, were prepared as described previously (18Yu Q. Toole B.P. Stamenkovic I. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1985-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The soluble CD44 does not contain transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains (19Yu Q. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20603-20607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells were purchased from ATCC. All cell lines were routinely maintained in complete medium, i.e. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-high glucose (Invitrogen), containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units penicillin/ml, 100 μg streptomycin/ml, and an additional 1 mm glutamine (Invitrogen). The cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and passed every 3–4 days. Adenoviruses and Cell Transfection—Recombinant adenoviruses, driving expression of β-galactosidase, Has2, emmprin, or soluble CD44, were prepared as described previously (9Ward J.A. Huang L. Guo H. Ghatak S. Toole B.P. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 162: 1403-1409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 12Zoltan-Jones A. Huang L. Ghatak S. Toole B.P. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1229-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in six-well plates and allowed to grow under routine conditions until ∼70% confluent. The growth medium was then replaced with serum-free medium. The cells were infected with the adenovirus constructs at 200–300 multiplicity of infection per cell by incubation for 90 min with intermittent gentle rocking. The virus-containing medium was removed and replaced with 3 ml per well of complete serum-containing medium. The cultures were then incubated at 37 °C overnight and transferred to 150-mm dishes for a further 24-h incubation before processing for lysis, immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting. RNA Silencing—siRNA for human CD44 was designed from sequences of human CD44 obtained from the NCBI data base using programs available on-line (NCBI accession numbers AH003670, AY101193, U40373, M59040, and M24915). We chose the sequence, 5′-GAACGAAUCCUGAAGACAUCU-3′ (sense strand), after a BLAST search of the data base. The double-stranded siRNA was prepared by Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). The nonspecific control IX RNA (catalog number D-001206-09-05) was also purchased from Dharmacon. HCT116 cells were transfected with the siRNA in 2 ml of complete medium in six-well plates with cells at 70–90% confluence. Transfections were performed with 200 pmol siRNA using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 24 h, replated in 150-mm dishes, and allowed to grow for 48 h in complete medium. The cells were then harvested and processed for lysis, immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting. Cell Lysis, Immunoprecipitations, and Western Blotting—Cells were treated with versene solution (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 15 min and then collected as a pellet by centrifugation at 4 °C. After washing the cells twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, they were lysed in buffer containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EGTA, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Lysis was carried out by vortexing for three cycles of 15 s at high speed followed by cooling on ice. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C in an Eppendorf 5415R centrifuge. An aliquot was kept for protein determination; the rest was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until use. For immunoprecipitations, all operations were done at 4 °C unless otherwise mentioned. Cell lysates were diluted to 1 μg protein/μl using the lysis buffer above. Aliquots of 500 μl of lysate were mixed with 5 μl of antibody against ErbB2, p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, or CD44 and incubated for 2 h while rotating on a wheel. The immune complex was captured by adding 80 μl of 1:1 (v/v) protein A-Sepharose 4B suspension and incubated for another 1 h. The Sepharose 4B beads were collected by brief centrifugation followed by washing three times in ice-cold lysis buffer, three times with lithium chloride buffer (5 mm LiCl, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), and three times with buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Finally, the immune complexes were recovered from the beads in 500 μl of SDS-containing denaturing buffer and heated to 65 °C for 5 min. For SDS-PAGE, the denatured immunoprecipitates were loaded onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel at 15–30 μg of protein per lane in an Invitrogen minigel apparatus. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 followed by washing in the same Tris-Tween buffer. The membranes were probed with the appropriate antibody diluted in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% bovine serum albumin (for polyclonal antibodies) or 5% nonfat dry milk (for monoclonal antibodies) followed by treatment with peroxidase-linked ECL secondary antibodies and chemoluminescence reagents. Sizes of proteins were estimated from prestained molecular weight standards electrophoresed in the same blot as the samples. Immunoreactive bands were quantified by densitometry. Lipid-rich Microdomains—Separation of lipid raft fractions was carried out in a sucrose step gradient (22Claas C. Stipp C.S. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7974-7984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). HCT116 cells were grown to 90% confluence in complete medium and divided into three groups in 150-mm dishes: untreated, treated with 5 mm MBCD (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 37 °C, or treated with 100 μg/ml hyaluronan oligomers in complete medium for 24 h. Cells (∼2 × 107 cells) were harvested using ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted at 1000 × g at 4 °C. The cell pellet was then lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer, 1% v/v Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaF, 10 mm Na-PPi, 10 mm Na3VO4, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 mm MOPS, pH 6.5. The viscous lysate was then sheared 10 times using a gauge 26.5 needle. For the gradient, sucrose solutions (90, 35 and 5%) were prepared in the lysis buffer. One ml of lysate was mixed with an equal volume of 90% sucrose solution in an ultracentrifuge tube. This solution was overlaid with 2 ml of 35% sucrose and 1 ml of 5% sucrose solution. The gradient was centrifuged in a swinging bucket rotor for 16 h at 110,000 × g at 4 °C in a Sorvall Superspin 630 centrifuge. Fractions (300 μl) were collected from the bottom up using a minipump and then stored at –20 °C until use. Inhibition of Constitutive ErbB2 Phosphorylation by Antagonists of Endogenous Hyaluronan Interactions—HCT116 colon carcinoma cells and TA3/St mouse mammary carcinoma cells exhibit relatively high levels of constitutive ErbB2 phosphorylation, and so these cells were used to determine the effects of endogenous hyaluronan on constitutive ErbB2 phosphorylation. Small hyaluronan oligomers (6–20 monosaccharide in length) compete for multivalent binding of endogenous hyaluronan polymer to cell surface receptors such as CD44 (23Lesley J. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. Hyman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26967-26975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and consequently attenuate cell survival signaling (7Ghatak S. Misra S. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38013-38020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) (also see Fig. 2D). Therefore we incubated the HCT116 and TA3/St cells for 24 h with and without 100 μg/ml hyaluronan oligomers in complete serum-containing medium. After removing the media, the cells were washed and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer followed by immunoprecipitation with antibody that recognizes total ErbB2, i.e. active phosphorylated plus inactive non-phosphorylated ErbB2. Aliquots of the immunoprecipitates were then Western blotted with antibodies that recognize total ErbB2 or only phosphorylated ErbB2 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Typical blots are shown in Fig. 1A, where it can be seen that treatment of the tumor cells with hyaluronan oligomers causes inhibition of ErbB2 phosphorylation without significantly affecting total ErbB2 expression.Fig. 1Hyaluronan oligomers inhibit constitutive ErbB2 phosphorylation. HCT116 human colon carcinoma and TA3/St mouse mammary carcinoma cells were incubated for 24 h with 100 μg/ml hyaluronan oligomers (o-HA). The cell layer was lysed and immunoprecipitated with antibodies against total ErbB2 (A), CD44 (B), and the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase (C). Aliquots of the redissolved immunoprecipitates were subject to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using antibodies against phosphorylated ErbB2 (pErbB2) and total ErbB2 (ErbB2). IP, immunoprecipitate; WB, Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previously published evidence indicates that in some tumor cells ErbB2 interacts with the hyaluronan receptor, CD44, and that hyaluronan-CD44 interaction stimulates ErbB2 activation (6Bourguignon L.Y.

J. Clin. Neurosci. 2002; 9: 282-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus we determined whether antibody against CD44 co-immunoprecipitates ErbB2 from HCT116 and TA3/St cell lysates and whether hyaluronan oligomers affect the amount of phosphorylated ErbB2 in these immunoprecipitates. We found that phosphorylated ErbB2 was present in the CD44 immunoprecipitates from untreated cells, but as expected it was greatly diminished in the immunoprecipitates from hyaluronan oligomer-treated cells; no effect on total ErbB2 was observed (Fig. 1B). Because it is known that ErbB2/ErbB3 forms a complex with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase (26Hellyer N.J. Kim M.S. Koland J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42153-42161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), we also analyzed total and phosphorylated ErbB2 in immunoprecipitates obtained with antibody against the p85 subunit. Again we found that ErbB2 was co-immunoprecipitated with p85 and that treatment of the cells with hyaluronan oligomers suppressed the amount of ErbB2 phosphorylation in these immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1C). The immunoprecipitations with antibody against ErbB2 were repeated three times, and the effect of hyaluronan oligomers was quantitated by densitometry. It was found that the oligomers inhibit ErbB2 phosphorylation by ∼84% in the HCT116 cells and by ∼94% in the TA3/St cells (Fig. 2A). A similar analysis was performed with three sets of p85 immunoprecipitates. In similar fashion, ∼86% inhibition of ErbB2 phosphorylation was seen in hyaluronan oligomer-treated HCT116 cells and ∼90% inhibition in TA3/St cells (Fig. 2A). However, no significant effect on the amounts of p85 or total ErbB2 in these immunoprecipitates was observed. A plausible interpretation for the inhibition of ErbB2 phosphorylation by hyaluronan oligomers is that these oligomers inhibit endogenous hyaluronan-receptor binding and consequent signaling (7Ghatak S. Misra S. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38013-38020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). If this were the case, other antagonists of hyaluronan-receptor interactions should have a similar effect. Thus we determined the effect of experimentally induced expression of soluble CD44, which acts as competitive decoy for binding of endogenous hyaluronan (Fig. 2D). First we examined the effect of infection of HCT116 cells with an adenovirus driving expression of soluble CD44, using an adenovirus expressing β-galactosidase as a control (9Ward J.A. Huang L. Guo H. Ghatak S. Toole B.P. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 162: 1403-1409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Soluble CD44 caused ∼72% inhibition of ErbB2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). We also examined the levels of ErbB2 phosphorylation in TA3/St cells that were stably transfected with soluble CD44 or soluble CD44 mutated in the hyaluronan-binding domain as compared with vector-transfected cells (18Yu Q. Toole B.P. Stamenkovic I. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1985-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 27Peterson R.M. Yu Q. Stamenkovic I. Toole B.P. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 2159-2167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Soluble CD44 caused 54% inhibition, whereas the mutated soluble CD44 did not have a significant effect (Fig. 2B). Similar results were obtained when ErbB2 was co-immunoprecipitated with the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase (data not shown). Inhibition of Assembly of a Constitutive, ErbB2-containing Signaling Complex by Antagonists of Endogenous Hyaluronan Interactions—The data presented in Fig. 1B indicate that phosphorylated ErbB2 and CD44 are present as a complex and that phosphorylation of ErbB2 within this complex is dependent on hyaluronan. Therefore we blotted the ErbB2 immunoprecipitates obtained in the previous section with antibodies that recognize CD44 and found that CD44 co-immunoprecipitates with ErbB2 from lysates of both HCT116 and TA3/St cells. However, the amount of CD44 in the complex was greatly decreased after treatment of the tumor cells with hyaluronan oligomers (Fig. 3). Another important signaling factor that interacts with CD44 is ezrin (28Legg J.W. Lewis C.A. Parsons M. Ng T. Isacke C.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and so we probed the immunoprecipitates with antibody that recognizes ezrin and found that it is also present in the complex. As with CD44 and phosphorylated ErbB2, the levels of ezrin in the immunoprecipitates were diminished by treatment of the tumor cells with hyaluronan oligomers (Fig. 3). We found above that phosphorylated ErbB2 co-immunoprecipitates with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase and that treatment of the tumor cells with hyaluronan oligomers decreases the amount of phosphorylated ErbB2 in this complex (Figs. 1C and 2A). However, we found that the amount of p85 in the ErbB2 immunoprecipitates (and vice versa) is not affected by the oligomers (Fig. 3). We also examined the effect of hyaluronan oligomers on the level of p110α catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase in this complex because it is known to form a complex with CD44 via interaction with Gab-1 (11Bourguignon L.Y. Singleton P.A. Zhu H. Diedrich F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29420-29434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Unlike the p85 subunit, the amount of p110α subunit in the complex was decreased by treatment of the tumor cells with hyaluronan antagonists (Fig. 3). We then probed the p85 immunoprecipitates obtained as in the previous section with the antibodies against CD44, ezrin, and p110α and found the same pattern, i.e. these three components were present in the immunoprecipitates but the amounts present after hyaluronan oligomer treatment of the cells was decreased (data not shown). To ensure that ErbB2, CD44, ezrin and PI 3-kinase are specifically present in the immunoprecipitated complex, we probed for several other cell surface-associated molecules, i.e. emmprin (29Biswas C. Zhang Y. DeCastro R. Guo H. Nakamura T. Kataoka H. Nabeshima K. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 434-439PubMed Google Scholar), the Na+-H+ exchanger, NHE1 (30Bourguignon L.Y. Singleton P.A. Diedrich F. Stern R. Gilad E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26991-27007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), and transferrin receptor (31Hommelgaard A.M. Lerdrup M. van Deurs B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1557-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), but did not detect significant amounts in the immunoprecipitates. We also probed for the chaperone molecules Hsp90 and cdc37 because Hsp90 is required for ErbB2 activity (32Blagosklonny M.V. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 33Citri A. Kochupurakkal B.S. Yarden Y. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), and cdc37 is known to act cooperatively with Hsp90 in stabilizing several kinases (16Grammatikakis N. Lin J.H. Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 34Pratt W.B. Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 839-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We found that both of these chaperones are present in the complex but they are diminished in amount by treatment of the cells with hyaluronan oligomers (Fig. 3). The results obtained for ErbB2 immunoprecipitates from three experiments with HCT116 and TA3/St cells were quantitated, and the results are shown in Fig. 4. As can be seen from this figure, treatment of the cells with hyaluronan oligomers inhibits assembly of phosphorylated ErbB2, CD44, ezrin, Hsp90/cdc37, and the p110α subunit of PI 3-kinase into the complex. However, the total amount of ErbB2 and the amount of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase remain constant. Very similar results were obtained on analysis of p85 immunoprecipitates from these three experiments (data not shown). To obtain a semiquantitative estimate of what proportion of each component is present in the complex, we performed densitometry on Western blots of each component in the ErbB2 immunoprecipitate and in the supernatant after immunoprecipitation from HCT116 cells. We found that ∼80% of total ErbB2 appeared in the immunoprecipitate. About 30–50% of each of the other components was also co-immunoprecipitated along with ErbB2. Thus, this complex contains a major proportion of the cellular pool of each of these signaling components. Then we examined immunoprecipitates from lysates of HCT116 and TA3/St cells overexpressing soluble CD44 as described in the previous section (Fig. 2B). We found that this treatment also greatly diminishes the amounts of phosphorylated ErbB2, CD44, ezrin, Hsp90/cdc37, and p110α subunit of PI 3-kinase in the immunoprecipitates (Figs. 5 and 6). However, this treatment did not significantly change the total amounts of ErbB2 in the complex (Fig. 5). In the TA3/St cells, we found that overexpression of soluble CD44 mutated in the hyaluronan-binding site had no significant effect (Figs. 5 and 6).Fig. 6Antagonists of endogenous hyaluronan interactions inhibit assembly of a constitutive ErbB2-containing signaling complex. The experiment described in Fig. 5 was repeated three times and processed for immunoprecipitation with antibody against ErbB2, Western blotting with the various antibodies, and densitometry. HCT116 cells: bars 1, control RNA; bars 2, siRNA to CD44; bars 3, β-galactosidase adenovirus (as control); bars 4, soluble CD44 adenovirus. TA3/St cells: bars 5, vector-transfected; bars 6, mutated soluble CD44-transfected; bars 7, soluble CD44-transfected. The results obtained for Western blotting of phosphorylated ErbB2 are shown in Fig. 2, B and C. Similar results were obtained when immunoprecipitation was carried out with antibody against the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2068244483,"The monomeric GTPase RhoA, which is a key regulator of numerous cellular processes, is activated by a variety of G protein-coupled receptors, through either G12 or Gq family proteins. Here we report that p63RhoGEF, a recently identified RhoA-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, enhances the Rho-dependent gene transcription induced by agonist-stimulated Gq/11-coupled receptors (M3-cholinoceptor, histamine H1 receptor) or GTPase-deficient mutants of Gαq and Gα11. We further demonstrate that active Gαq or Gα11, but not Gα12 or Gα13, strongly enhances p63RhoGEF-induced RhoA activation by direct protein-protein interaction with p63RhoGEF at its C-terminal half. Moreover, the activation of p63RhoGEF by Gαq/11 occurs independently of and in competition to the activation of the canonical Gαq/11 effector phospholipase C β. Therefore, our results elucidate a new signaling pathway by which Gαq/11-coupled receptors specifically induce Rho signaling through a direct interaction of activated Gαq/11 subunits with p63RhoGEF.

The Rho GTPase family belongs to the Ras superfamily and comprises more than 20 distinct proteins. The best characterized members (RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42) were first identified in the early 1990s as regulators of actin cytoskeleton rearrangements. RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 induce stress fiber, lamellipodia, and filopodia formation, respectively (1Ridley A. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 1999; 22: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, it became evident that Rho family proteins play a pivotal role in a variety of cellular processes, including secretion, smooth muscle contraction, migration, neurite retraction, and gene transcription (2Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3875) Google Scholar, 3Jaffe A. Hall A. Adv. Cancer Res. 2002; 84: 57-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). As monomeric GTPases, Rho proteins cycle between an inactive GDP-bound and an active GTP-bound state. The activation step, i.e. the exchange of GDP by GTP, is catalyzed by a group of accessory proteins: the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; DH, Dbl homology; PH, pleckstrin homology; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GST·RBD, GST fusion protein containing the Rho binding domain of rhotekin; Lsc-RGS, RGS homology domain of Lsc; SRF, serum-response factor; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; LARG, leukemia-associated RhoGEF; PLC, phospholipase C; PKC, protein kinase C; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; M3R, M3-cholinoceptor; H1R, histamine H1 receptor; RGS, regulator of G protein signaling. About 60 different GEFs for Rho family members (RhoGEFs) are described so far. Most of them belong to the Dbl protein family, which share the typical tandem motif consisting of a Dbl homology (DH) and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (4Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar, 5Zheng Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Besides this tandem motif, RhoGEFs often contain one or more additional signal transduction domains, such as SH2, SH3, PDZ, and additional PH domains. Therefore, they often function as molecular bridges between different signal transduction pathways (4Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar, 5Zheng Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). It is well established that apart from receptor tyrosine kinases, a large variety of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those coupling to the G12/13 type of heterotrimeric G proteins, are upstream regulators of Rho proteins (6Sah V. Seasholtz T. Sagi S. Brown J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 459-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 7Seasholtz T. Majumdar M. Brown J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). A family of RhoA-specific GEFs, consisting of p115RhoGEF, PDZ-RhoGEF, and leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG), which mediates this activation process, has been identified (8Fukuhara S. Murga C.

A. 1998; 95: 12973-12976Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). All these proteins contain, in addition to the DH/PH tandem motif, a regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) homology domain for direct interaction with and activation by G12 type G proteins. Recently, clear evidence has been provided that Gαq and Gα11 as well as Gq/11-coupled receptors can induce potent RhoA activation (11Chikumi H. Vazquez-Prado J. Servitja J. Miyazaki H. Gutkind J. J.

This process is apparently independent of phospholipase C β (PLCβ) isozymes, the canonical Gαq/11 effectors, and their downstream signaling, i.e. Ca2+ mobilization and protein kinase C (PKC) activation (11Chikumi H. Vazquez-Prado J. Servitja J. Miyazaki H. Gutkind J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27130-27134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 13Vogt S. Grosse R. Schultz G.

Although the G12/13-activated LARG has been reported to additionally mediate Gαq-induced RhoA activation (13Vogt S. Grosse R. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28743-28749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 14Booden M. Siderovski D. Der C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4053-4061Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), a GEF specifically and selectively linking Gαq/11 proteins and Gq/11-coupled receptors to RhoA activation has not been identified so far. We and others (15Lutz S. Freichel-Blomquist A. Rümenapp U. Schmidt M. Jakobs K.H. Wieland T. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch.

It was therefore termed p63RhoGEF. The expression of p63RhoGEF in human heart and brain tissue was confirmed by both groups of investigators using Northern blot analysis and immunohistochemistry, and it was clearly demonstrated that p63RhoGEF activates specifically RhoA but not Rac1 or Cdc42. Sequence analysis revealed that this protein does not contain other distinct functional domains besides the typical DH/PH tandem motif. As we tried to identify regulatory mechanisms inducing a p63RhoGEF-mediated RhoA activation, we studied the influence of the stimulation of a variety of GPCRs on p63RhoGEF activity. The data presented herein will provide evidence that p63RhoGEF links specifically Gq/11-coupled receptors to RhoA by a direct interaction with GTP-liganded Gαq/11 proteins. This RhoGEF therefore represents a so far unknown Gαq effector molecule. Plasmids—The construction of plasmids encoding Myc-tagged p63RhoGEF and its deletion mutants in the pCMV-Tag3B vector was reported before (15Lutz S. Freichel-Blomquist A. Rümenapp U. Schmidt M. Jakobs K.H. Wieland T. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2004; 369: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The coding sequences of the M3-cholinoceptor (M3R) and the histamine H1 receptor (H1R) was subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). pCDNA3-EE-GqQL was from UMR cDNA Resource Center. pCis-Gαq, pCis-GαqRC, pCis-Gα11, pCis-Gα11QL, pCis-Gα12, pCis-Gα12QL, pCis-Gα13, pCis-Gα13QL, and pCis-PLCβ2 were kindly provided by Dr M. I. Simon, Pasadena, CA. Cell Culture and Transfection—Culture of HEK-293 cells and COS-7 cells and transfection of the cells (250 ng of total DNA/well on a 48-well plate for SRF activation and up to 2 μg of DNA/6-well plate for RhoA pull-down assays) were performed as described before (15Lutz S. Freichel-Blomquist A. Rümenapp U. Schmidt M. Jakobs K.H. Wieland T. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2004; 369: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Assays were performed 48 h after transfection in serum-starved cells. Preparation of RNA and Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA from HEK-293 and COS-7 cells was prepared with RNeasy Minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The RNA was transcribed into cDNA using oligo(dT) primers and a first strand synthesis kit (Roche Applied Science). PCR conditions for the amplification of p63RhoGEF cDNA fragments were as follows (50 μl): primer 0.4 μm each, dNTP 0.2 mm, 1× PCR buffer, Taq polymerase plus Q-Solution (Qiagen), and 2 μl of cDNA. 35 cycles (denaturation 95 °C, 30 s, annealing 56 °C, 30 s, elongation 72 °C, 90 s) followed by a final acquisition of 5 min at 72 °C were performed. Primer sequences were as follows: p63RhoGEF forward, 5′-GATGGTTGGATCATTCCAAACA-3′; p63RhoGEF reverse, 5′-GTTACAGCTCATCTTCATCCA-3′. The sequences of these primers are conserved in rat, mouse, and man. Assay of SRF Activation—HEK-293 cells or COS-7 cells seeded on 48-well plates were co-transfected with the indicated expression plasmids together with the pSRE.L-luciferase reporter plasmid and the pRL-TK control reporter vector. 48 h after transfection, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with passive lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activities were determined with the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) as described (15Lutz S. Freichel-Blomquist A. Rümenapp U. Schmidt M. Jakobs K.H. Wieland T. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2004; 369: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 17Mao J. Yuan H. Xie W. Simon M. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27118-27123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The activity of the experimental reporter was normalized against the activity of the control vector. Pull-down Assay of Activated RhoA—The cellular level of GTP-loaded RhoA was determined using a GST fusion protein containing the Rho binding domain of rhotekin (GST·RBD) (15Lutz S. Freichel-Blomquist A. Rümenapp U. Schmidt M. Jakobs K.H. Wieland T. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2004; 369: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18Ren X. Schwartz M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 264-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, subconfluent monolayers of HEK-293 cells were transfected with the indicated amounts of plasmid DNA or the corresponding empty vectors using Polyfect (Qiagen) and cultured for 48 h. Thereafter, the cells were lysed in a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, and the particular fraction was pelleted by centrifugation. 1 mg of the GTPase-containing supernatant was then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 40 μg of GST·RBD (expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli) bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. After three times washing of the beads, bound proteins were eluted with sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. RhoA was then detected by immunoblotting with a specific monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Coimmunoprecipitation of Gα-proteins with p63RhoGEF—HEK-293 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected at a confluence of 80% with 2 μg of the indicated cDNA constructs. 48 h after transfection, the cells were solubilized in 600 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 μm Pefabloc SC, 0.1% Triton X-100). After incubation on ice for 20 min and centrifugation (26,000 × g for 10 min), 2 μg of anti-c-Myc antibody (clone 9E10, Sigma) or polyclonal anti-EE-antiserum (1:150 dilution, Covance) were added to the clear supernatant (300 μg of protein) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After the addition of a 40-μl 1:1 (v/v) slurry of anti-mouse-IgG-agarose conjugate (Sigma) or protein-A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), the mixture was gently shaken for 4 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and bound proteins were eluted with 25 μl of sample buffer for 5 min at 95 °C. Precipitated proteins were loaded onto a 12% polyacrylamide gel. After SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by immunoblotting with anti-c-Myc (clone 9E10, Sigma) and anti-Gα antibodies (Gramsch Laboratories, Schwabhausen, Germany). Phospholipase C Assay—For measurement of PLC activity, transfected COS-7 cells seeded on 12-well plates were incubated with 1 of μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol (Amersham Biosciences) 48 h prior to the assay. Thereafter, the cells were washed once with Hanks' balanced salt solution followed by the addition of fresh Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 10 mm LiCl, and if indicated, 1 mm carbachol. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped, and the formed [3H]inositol phosphates were determined as described (19Schmidt M. Hüwe S. Fasselt B. Homann D. Rümenapp U. Sandmann J. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Statistics—Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test. A p value <0.05 was considered significant. Concentration-response curves were analyzed using iterative nonlinear regression analysis (GraphPAD Prism). Synergistic Activation of Rho-mediated Gene Transcription by p63RhoGEF and Stimulation of Gq/11-coupled Receptors—To study whether p63RhoGEF is activated by Gq/11-coupled receptors, we coexpressed p63RhoGEF together with the M3Rorthe H1R in HEK-293 cells, in which the mRNA encoding p63RhoGEF could be detected by reverse transcription-PCR (Fig. 1A, inset). Both GPCRs preferentially couple to Gq/11 proteins but can additionally activate other G proteins (20Kühn B. Schmid A. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1697-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 21Offermanns S. Wieland T. Homann D. Sandmann J. Bombien E. Spicher K. Schultz G. Jakobs K. Mol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 2474-2479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To monitor RhoA activation in intact cells, we measured transcription of a serum-response element (SRE)-controlled reporter gene (SRE.L-luciferase). Overexpression of p63RhoGEF caused a slight increase in luciferase expression, whereas agonist (carbachol, histamine) activation of the M3R or H1R increased transcriptional activity about 35-fold (Fig. 1A). The combined expression of p63RhoGEF and the respective GPCR led to a strong enhancement of agonist-induced luciferase expression (about 90-fold). As shown in Fig. 1B, the agonist-induced transcriptional activity of the M3R and the H1R was further enhanced by the additional expression of Gαq but not of Gα12. In addition, coexpression of Gαq but not Gα12 unmasked the known constitutive activity of the H1R (23Bakker R. Wieland K. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 387: R5-R7Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 24Bakker R. Schoonus S. Smit M. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). A similar effect was detected upon coexpression of the H1R with p63RhoGEF (Fig. 1A). Coexpression of RGS2, which acts as GTPase-activating protein (GAP) and therefore as an inhibitor of Gαq/11, but not Gα12/13 proteins (25Heximer S.P. Srinivasa P.S. Bernstein L.S. Bernard J.L.

Pharmacol. 1999; 360: 14-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), nearly eliminated the luciferase production induced by the activated M3R alone and largely suppressed the synergistic stimulation detected upon coexpression of p63RhoGEF (Fig. 1C). In contrast, the expression of the RGS domain of the mouse ortholog of p115RhoGEF Lsc (Lsc-RGS), which is a Gα12/13-specific GAP and thereby suppresses Gα12/13-mediated responses in HEK-293 cells (22Rümenapp U. Asmus M. Schablowski H. Wozniki M. Han L. Jakobs K. Fahimi-Vahid M. Michalek C. Wieland T. Schmidt M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2474-2479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), only slightly reduced (about 10–20%) the M3R-induced luciferase production. The transcriptional activity induced by the agonist-stimulated M3R coexpressed with p63RhoGEF was not affected by Lsc-RGS expression. The expression of both RGS proteins was verified by immunoblotting (not shown). Synergistic Activation of Rho-mediated Gene Transcription by p63RhoGEF and Gαq/11 but Not Gα12/13 Proteins—As the data obtained so far argued for an activation of p63RhoGEF by Gq/11 proteins, we studied the influence of various Gα subunits on p63RhoGEF-induced luciferase expression. Overexpression of wild-type Gαq or Gα11 only marginally (2–3-fold) increased luciferase production. Upon coexpression of p63RhoGEF, the transcriptional activity was increased by 20–40-fold (Fig. 2, A and B). As reported before (11Chikumi H. Vazquez-Prado J. Servitja J. Miyazaki H. Gutkind J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27130-27134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 17Mao J. Yuan H. Xie W. Simon M. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27118-27123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), overexpression of wild-type Gα12 and Gα13 induced strong increases in luciferase production, by 25- and 75-fold, respectively (Fig. 2C). Coexpression of p63RhoGEF with either Gα12 or Gα13 did not lead to further increases in transcriptional activity. The ineffectiveness of p63RhoGEF to enhance gene transcription by Gα12 and Gα13 was not due to a ceiling effect in the experimental setting. Expression of the GTPase-deficient mutants of Gαq (GαqRC) and Gα11 (Gα11QL) induced transcriptional activity in a range similar to that observed with Gα12 or Gα13 (compare Fig. 2, A and C). Upon coexpression of p63RhoGEF, the luciferase production induced by GαqRC and Gα11QL was enhanced in a synergistic manner reaching levels of more than 100-fold. In contrast, the strong transcriptional activity (more than 100-fold) induced by the GTPase-deficient mutants of Gα12 (Gα12QL) and Gα13 (Gα13QL) was not enhanced but was even slightly reduced by coexpression of p63RhoGEF (Fig. 2C). As reported before (15Lutz S. Freichel-Blomquist A. Rümenapp U. Schmidt M. Jakobs K.H. Wieland T. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2004; 369: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the p63RhoGEF-induced luciferase production, even when stimulated by GαqRC or Gα11QL, was largely suppressed by the RhoA–C-inactivating C3 ADP-ribosyl transferase (27Aktories K. Schmidt G. Just I. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Activated Gαq/11 Proteins Largely Stimulate p63RhoGEF-induced RhoA Activation—The measurements of Rho-dependent gene transcription indicated a stimulation of p63RhoGEF by activated Gαq/11 but not by activated Gα12/13 proteins. To substantiate this hypothesis, the amount of GTP-liganded RhoA was analyzed using the RhoA binding domain of rhotekin (GST·RBD) for pull-down of RhoA-GTP (18Ren X. Schwartz M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 264-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in lysates of transfected HEK-293 cells (15Lutz S. Freichel-Blomquist A. Rümenapp U. Schmidt M. Jakobs K.H. Wieland T. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2004; 369: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Under the conditions used (submaximally effective amounts of plasmid DNA encoding p63RhoGEF and Gα subunits), expression of either p63RhoGEF, GαqRC, or Gα11QL alone only slightly increased the amount of RhoA-GTP (Fig. 3). Combined expression of p63RhoGEF and GαqRC or Gα11QL induced a substantial increase in RhoA-GTP. In contrast, the combined overexpression of p63RhoGEF with either Gα12QL or Gα13QL did not induce a synergistic activation of RhoA. In accordance with the data observed in the SRF activation assay, coexpression of p63RhoGEF slightly inhibited the RhoA activation by the permanent active Gα12/13 mutants. Activated Gαq/11 Proteins Interact Directly with the C-terminal Half of p63RhoGEF—To investigate whether p63RhoGEF interacts with activated Gαq/11 proteins directly, we expressed various Gα-proteins and p63RhoGEF together in HEK-293 cells. Upon precipitation of the N-terminally Myc-tagged p63RhoGEF with anti-c-Myc antibodies, the immunoprecipitates were analyzed for coprecipitated Gα proteins. As shown in Fig. 4B, the GTPase-deficient mutants GαqRC or Gα11QL were coprecipitated by the anti-c-Myc antibody from cells transfected with the respective eukaryotic expression vectors. In contrast, Gαq was not detected in the p63RhoGEF immunoprecipitates from cells overexpressing wild-type Gαq. These data indicate that only activated Gαq and Gα11 apparently exhibit high affinity binding to p63RhoGEF and thus can be precipitated in a complex with p63RhoGEF. To verify this hypothesis, we overexpressed an EE-tagged version of GαqQL (EE-GαqQL) together with p63RhoGEF and precipitated EE-tagged proteins. As shown in Fig. 4C, p63RhoGEF was coprecipitated together with EE-GαqQL from lysates of cells coexpressing EE-GαqQL and p63RhoGEF. To identify the part of p63RhoGEF in which this interaction takes place, we performed similar experiments with two truncated mutants of p63RhoGEF, i.e. p63-DH (amino acids 138–379), which mainly consists of the DH domain, responsible for the guanine nucleotide exchange activity at RhoA (15Lutz S.

Portales-Casamar E. Mazurais D. Schmidt S. Leger I. Javre J. Robert P. Berrebi-Bertrand I. Bril I. Gout B. Debant A. Calmels T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 629-640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and p63-ΔN, consisting of the C-terminal half (amino acids 295–580) of p63RhoGEF with the PH domain but lacking the DH domain (Fig. 4A). The mutant p63-DH was precipitated to a similar extent as full-length p63RhoGEF (p63-FL) by the anti-c-Myc antibody but did not form a detectable complex with any of the Gαq/11 proteins. In contrast, similar to p63-FL, p63-ΔN coprecipitated GαqRC and Gα11QL but not wild-type Gαq (Fig. 4, B and D). No coprecipitation with any p63RhoGEF construct was observed with either wild-type Gα12 and Gα13 (not shown) or their GTPase-deficient mutants, Gα12QL and Gα13QL (Fig. 4D). The Recombinant Gαq/11 Binding Domain of p63RhoGEF Inhibits Gαq/11 and M3R-induced Rho-mediated Gene Transcription—As the N-terminally truncated mutant p63-ΔN specifically bound activated Gαq/11 proteins, we used the expression of this mutant to study the role of endogenous RhoGEFs in RhoA activation by Gα proteins and the M3R. In contrast to p63-FL, coexpression of p63-ΔN with GαqRC largely reduced the luciferase production induced by the GTPase-deficient Gαq mutant (Fig. 5A). On the other hand, p63-ΔN and p63-FL both weakly inhibited the transcriptional activity induced by Gα13. These data exclude a nonspecific inhibition of RhoA activation by p63-ΔN. Most important, expression of p63-ΔN, which by itself did not induce any transcriptional activity, potently suppressed (by up to 90%) the luciferase production induced by the carbachol-activated M3R (Fig. 5B). p63RhoGEF Competes with PLCβ for Activated Gαq/11 Proteins—The direct interaction of p63RhoGEF with Gαq/11 proteins finally prompted us to study whether p63RhoGEF and PLCβ isozymes, which also directly interact with Gαq/11 proteins (28Rhee S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar), may compete with each other for activation. For this, the effect of p63RhoGEF on Gαq- and M3R-induced luciferase production and PLC activation was examined in COS-7 cells, which are better suited to measure agonist-stimulated PLC activity in response to transient M3R expression than HEK-293 cells. Similar to HEK-293 cells, COS-7 cells express p63RhoGEF endogenously (Fig. 1A, inset). Also, in these cells, coexpression of p63RhoGEF largely enhanced the GαqRC-induced transcriptional activity, by about 10-fold (Fig. 6A). On the other hand, p63RhoGEF, which had no effect on basal PLC activity, significantly reduced the PLC stimulation induced by GαqRC by about 40% (Fig. 6B). An even stronger inhibition, of about 70%, by p63RhoGEF was observed on the M3R-induced PLC stimulation (Fig. 6D). Vice versa, the effect of an overexpression of PLCβ2onM3R-induced PLC activity and luciferase production was studied in COS-7 cells. Overexpression of PLCβ2 significantly increased the carbachol-induced inositol phosphate production from 4- to 5.5-fold (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 6C, the carbachol-induced luciferase production was reduced by about 50% in cells coexpressing PLCβ2 and p63RhoGEF. To further exclude a contribution of the PLC/PKC pathway on the regulation of p63RhoGEF, we additionally studied the influence of the PLC inhibitor U-73122 and the broad range PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide IX on GαqQL- and p63RhoGEF-induced transcriptional activity in COS-7 cells overexpressing PLCβ2. Neither U-73122 (2.5 μm) nor bisindolylmaleimide IX (0.5 μm) altered the transcriptional activity induced by p63RhoGEF, GαqQL, or their combination (data not shown). It is meanwhile well documented that activation of heterotrimeric G proteins of the Gq/11 subfamily induce Rho activation in a variety of cells and tissues (11Chikumi H. Vazquez-Prado J. Servitja J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31185-31190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence that this activation of Rho occurs independently of the PLC/PKC pathway. Most likely, so far unidentified GEFs are involved (11Chikumi H. Vazquez-Prado J. Servitja J. Miyazaki H. Gutkind J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27130-27134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 13Vogt S. Grosse R. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28743-28749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In this report, we presented several lines of evidence that p63RhoGEF, a novel member of the Dbl family of GEFs, might represent the specific GEF, or at least one of the GEFs, mediating this response. Firstly, p63RhoGEF largely enhanced the transcriptional activity of the primarily Gq/11-coupled M3R and H1R in a manner sensitive to RGS2, a negative regulator of Gq/11 activity (25Heximer S.P. Srinivasa P.S. Bernstein L.S. Bernard J.L. Linder M.E. Hepler J.R. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34253-34259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 26Wieland T. Chen C.K. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1999; 360: 14-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), but insensitive to the G12/13-specific Lsc-RGS (22Rümenapp U. Asmus M. Schablowski H. Wozniki M. Han L. Jakobs K. Fahimi-Vahid M. Michalek C. Wieland T. Schmidt M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2474-2479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Secondly, it largely enhanced the Rho-mediated gene transcription induced by the GTPase-deficient mutants of Gαq and Gα11 but not of Gα12 and Gα13. This increase in transcriptional activity was completely sensitive to the RhoA-inactivating C3 ADP-ribosyl transferase of Clostridium botulinum (27Aktories K. Schmidt G. Just I. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Thirdly, coexpression of p63RhoGEF and activated mutants of Gαq and Gα11 largely and synergistically increased the cellular amount of activated RhoA proteins. Finally, p63RhoGEF directly interacted with activated Gαq and Gα11 proteins. This interaction could be detected by means of coimmunoprecipitations as well as by functional inhibition of Gαq-induced gene transcription by the Gαq/11 binding domain of p63RhoGEF. Therefore, our data indicate that p63RhoGEF is the first known GEF that is specifically and so far exclusively regulated by activated Gα subunits of the Gq family. Furthermore, the GEF-deficient mutant p63-ΔN efficiently suppressed Rho-mediated gene transcription induced by the activated M3R and GαqRC, but not Gα13, indicating that p63RhoGEF is in fact specifically involved in RhoA activation by Gq type G proteins and Gq/11-coupled GPCRs, e.g. the M3R and H1R. Thus, p63-ΔN apparently binds to activated Gαq/11 proteins and thereby prevents binding and activation of endogenous p63RhoGEF (or another functionally related RhoGEF) required for RhoA activation by these Gα proteins and the Gq/11-coupled M3R. This hypothesis is on the one hand corroborated by the finding that agonist-induced gene transcription by these receptors was enhanced by coexpression of Gαq but not by Gα12. On the other hand, the stimulatory effect of the M3R was strongly, but not fully, blunted by either p63-ΔN or RGS2, which inactivates and traps activated Gαq/11 proteins (25Heximer S.P. Srinivasa P.S. Bernstein L.S. Bernard J.L. Linder M.E. Hepler J.R. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34253-34259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 30Anger T. Zhang W. Mende U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3906-3915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The rather small remaining part of the M3R action might therefore represent coupling to G12 type G proteins, which is in line with the known G protein coupling specificity of this GPCR (21Offermanns S. Wieland T. Homann D. Sandmann J. Bombien E. Spicher K. Schultz G. Jakobs K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 890-898PubMed Google Scholar, 22Rümenapp U. Asmus M. Schablowski H. Wozniki M. Han L. Jakobs K. Fahimi-Vahid M. Michalek C. Wieland T. Schmidt M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2474-2479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This interpretation is further corroborated by the small inhibitory effect (about 15%, Fig. 1C) of the Gα12/13-specific GAP Lsc-RGS (22Rümenapp U. Asmus M. Schablowski H. Wozniki M. Han L. Jakobs K. Fahimi-Vahid M. Michalek C. Wieland T. Schmidt M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2474-2479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Screening data bases of the human genome project and the mouse genome project revealed that p63RhoGEF, in contrast to other known RhoA-specific GEFs, has no close homolog. Besides the existence of a DH/PH tandem motif, p63RhoGEF is especially not related to the members of the p115RhoGEF family, which mediate the activation of RhoA by G12/13 proteins(8Fukuhara S. Murga C. Zohar M. Igishi T. Gutkind J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5868-5879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 9Fukuhara S. Chikumi H. Gutkind J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 10Mao J. Yuan H. Xie W. Wu D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12973-12976Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar,31Hart M. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W. Gilman A. Sternweis P. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we could not detect any interaction of p63RhoGEF with or activation by Gα12 family members. Moreover, p63RhoGEF does not contain the RGS homology domain, which is involved in the interaction of the p115 RhoGEF family members with activated Gα subunits. The activation of p63RhoGEF is apparently induced by a direct interaction of activated Gαq/11 proteins with the C-terminal half of the p63RhoGEF molecule, containing the PH domain. This interaction likely results in the relief of the described autoinhibition of the GEF activity (15Lutz S. Freichel-Blomquist A. Rümenapp U. Schmidt M. Jakobs K.H. Wieland T. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2004; 369: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 32Rümenapp U. Freichel-Blomquist A. Wittinghofer B. Jakobs K. Wieland T. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 721-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, our data indicate that the C-terminal Gαq/11 binding site of p63RhoGEF has to be quite distinct from the interaction site by which p115 family members interact with activated Gα subunits. With regard to this interaction site, it is noteworthy, however, that the p115RhoGEF family member, LARG, has been shown to interact with and be activated by Gαq (13Vogt S. Grosse R. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28743-28749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 14Booden M. Siderovski D. Der C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4053-4061Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Whether this interaction is mediated by the RGS homology domain of LARG is still a matter of debate. One report indicated a binding of activated Gαq to the RGS domain of LARG and a productive coupling of activated Gαq to RhoA via LARG (14Booden M. Siderovski D. Der C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4053-4061Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Another report showed that a LARG mutant lacking the DH domain but not the RGS homology domain interfered with Gαq-induced RhoA activation (13Vogt S. Grosse R. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28743-28749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). However, a third publication did not detect an interaction of activated Gαq with the RGS homology domain of LARG, which also failed to inhibit GαqQL-induced luciferase production (11Chikumi H. Vazquez-Prado J. Servitja J. Miyazaki H. Gutkind J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27130-27134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In contrast to the data on the interaction of Gαq with the LARG-RGS homology domain, the interaction of Gα12 family members with this domain and a productive coupling to RhoA were found by both groups (11Chikumi H. Vazquez-Prado J. Servitja J. Miyazaki H. Gutkind J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27130-27134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 14Booden M. Siderovski D. Der C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4053-4061Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Another line of evidence for p63RhoGEF to be a so far unknown effector molecule for Gq proteins resulted from the experiments analyzing the influence of the canonical Gαq effector molecule PLCβ (28Rhee S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar) on the activation of p63RhoGEF and vice versa. The overexpression of p63RhoGEF inhibited Gαq-stimulated PLC activity as well as the overexpression of PLCβ2 inhibited the Gαq-induced gene transcription. These data argue for a direct competition of p63RhoGEF and PLCβ isoforms for activated Gαq/11 proteins. In line with the inhibitory effect of PLCβ2 and in accordance with previous observations, which indicated the existence of a Gq/11-activated RhoGEF not regulated by PLC and the subsequent Ca2+ mobilization and PKC activation (11Chikumi H. Vazquez-Prado J. Servitja J. Miyazaki H. Gutkind J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27130-27134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), the M3R- and GαqQL-induced gene transcription was not influenced by the inhibition of PLC and PKC activity, by U73122 (33Bleasdale J. Bundy G. Bunting S. Fitzpatrick F. Huff R. Sun F. Pike J. Adv. Prostaglandin Thromboxane Leukotriene Res. 1989; 19: 590-593PubMed Google Scholar) and bisindolylmaleimide IX (34Davis P. Hill C. Lawton G. Nixon J. Wilkinson S. Hurst S. Keech E. Turner S. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), respectively. In summary, the data presented herein define a new signaling pathway for GPCRs, with p63RhoGEF serving as a direct Gαq/11 effector molecule. It directly links these GPCRs to RhoA- and RhoA-dependent cellular processes, apparently in competition with the canonical PLCβ/PKC pathway. We thank S. Alexa and A.

Although currently viewed as distinct factors, insulin resistance and CYP2E1 expression may be interrelated through the ability of CYP2E1-induced oxidant stress to impair hepatic insulin signaling. To test this possibility, the effects of in vitro and in vivo CYP2E1 overexpression on hepatocyte insulin signaling were examined. CYP2E1 overexpression in a hepatocyte cell line decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and IRS-2 in response to insulin. CYP2E1 overexpression was also associated with increased inhibitory serine 307 and 636/639 IRS-1 phosphorylation. In parallel, the effects of insulin on Akt activation, glycogen synthase kinase 3, and FoxO1a phosphorylation, and glucose secretion were all significantly decreased in CYP2E1 overexpressing cells. This inhibition of insulin signaling by CYP2E1 overexpression was partially c-Jun N-terminal kinase dependent. In the methionine- and choline-deficient diet mouse model of steatohepatitis with CYP2E1 overexpression, insulin-induced IRS-1, IRS-2, and Akt phosphorylation were similarly decreased. These findings indicate that increased hepatocyte CYP2E1 expression and the presence of steatohepatitis result in the down-regulation of insulin signaling, potentially contributing to the insulin resistance associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

The prominent association of insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes mellitus with NAFLD has suggested that these conditions may contribute to the pathogenesis of NAFLD by promoting the initial development of steatosis, and/or the subsequent progression to the state of liver injury and inflammation termed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (1Pagano G.

Gut. 2004; 53: 923-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, the function of insulin resistance in the development and progression of NAFLD remains to be established experimentally. An additional, and as yet unexamined, mechanism underlying the co-association of these two conditions could be that NAFLD-related changes in hepatic physiology act to promote insulin resistance. The liver is an important regulator of carbohydrate homeostasis that stores or releases glucose according to metabolic demands. This process is under the control of insulin through signal transduction pathways initiated by insulin binding to the hepatocyte insulin receptor. Following this ligand-receptor interaction, a class of molecules known as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) are recruited and activated by tyrosine phosphorylation (5Virkamaki A. Ueki K. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 6White M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E413-E422Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The critical role of IRS in insulin responsiveness has been demonstrated by studies in which deletion of IRS-1 or IRS-2 resulted in hepatic insulin resistance and symptoms mimicking diabetes including increased gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis (7Kido Y.

Tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS recruits additional signaling molecules containing Src homology-2 domains, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Grb2, and Shp2.

The principle downstream effector of insulin signaling is the protein kinase Akt, as demonstrated by the fact that animals lacking the Akt2 isoform develop insulin resistance secondary to loss of the effects of insulin on the liver (18Cho H. Mu J. Kim J.K. Thorvaldsen J.L. Chu Q. Crenshaw III, E.B. Kaestner K.H. Bartolomei M.S. Shulman G.I. Birnbaum M.J. Science. 2001; 292: 1728-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar). Upon activation, Akt phosphorylates and inactivates the inhibitory kinase of glycogen synthase, glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), and members of the forkhead box transcription factor family. These effects mediate an inhibition of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis (19Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M.

Increased expression of the prooxidant cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) isoform and elevated levels of lipid peroxidation occur in both the human disease and animal models of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (22Weltman M.D. Farrell G.C. Hall P. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Liddle C. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 23Leclercq I.A. Farrell G.C. Field J. Bell D.R. Gonzalez F.J. Robertson G.R. J. Clin.

CYP2E1 has enhanced NADPH oxidase activity resulting in increased production of the reactive oxygen species superoxide and hydrogen peroxide by redox cycling of endogenous and exogenous substrates (25Ekstrom G. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 1313-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). These facts led us to hypothesize that chronic oxidative stress generated through CYP2E1 induction may promote the development of hepatic insulin resistance in NAFLD. To test this hypothesis we examined the effects of in vitro hepatocyte CYP2E1 overexpression and the in vivo development of steatohepatitis associated with CYP2E1 overexpression on insulin signaling. Cells and Culture Conditions—Studies were performed in the rat hepatocyte line RALA255-10G cultured as described previously (26Liu H. Lo C.R. Jones B.E. Pradhan Z. Srinivasan A. Valentino K.L. Stockert R.J. Czaja M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40155-40162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This hepatocyte cell line is conditionally immortalized with a mutant SV40 virus expressing a temperature-sensitive T antigen (27Chou J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1013-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 4% fetal bovine serum (Gemini, Woodland, CA), and antibiotics (Invitrogen) at the permissive temperature of 33 °C in 60-mm dishes (Falcon, BD Biosciences). For experiments, cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 2% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, and 1 μm dexamethasone at the restrictive temperature of 37 °C for 3 days and then placed in serum-free medium containing dexamethasone for 18 h. Under these conditions, T antigen expression is suppressed, the cells are nontransformed, and they display a differentiated hepatocyte phenotype (27Chou J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1013-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). From wild-type (WT) RALA255-10G cells, clonal cell lines with increased CYP2E1 expression were established by stable transfection with a pCI-Neo expression vector containing the human CYP2E1 cDNA, as described previously (28Jones B.E. Liu H. Lo C.R. Koop D.R. Czaja M.J. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2002; 4: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Clones with increased CYP2E1 expression (S-CYP cells) were identified by both Western blotting for CYP2E1 protein levels, and chlorzoxazone assay for enzyme activity (28Jones B.E. Liu H. Lo C.R. Koop D.R. Czaja M.J. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2002; 4: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 29Schattenberg J.M. Wang Y. Rigoli R.M. Koop D.R. Czaja M.J. Hepatology. 2004; 39: 444-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A polyclonal cell line transfected with the pCI-Neo vector lacking any insert (VEC cells) was also established (29Schattenberg J.M. Wang Y. Rigoli R.M. Koop D.R. Czaja M.J. Hepatology. 2004; 39: 444-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). RALA hepatocytes were treated with 100 nm insulin (Sigma) for the times indicated, and 20 ng/ml recombinant rat tumor necrosis factor-α (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 30 min. Protein Isolation and Subcellular Fractionation—For the isolation of total protein, cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged, and resuspended in cell lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described previously (29Schattenberg J.M. Wang Y. Rigoli R.M. Koop D.R. Czaja M.J. Hepatology. 2004; 39: 444-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Subcellular fractionation of nuclear and cytosolic proteins was performed by hypotonic-hypertonic cell lysis. Cells were cultured in 100-mm tissue culture dishes as described above and lysed in hypotonic buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm sodium chloride, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate. Lysates were centrifuged at 800 × g at 4 °C to remove the cellular debris and subsequently centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 60 min. The resultant supernatant was the cytosolic fraction. The nuclei containing pellets were lysed for 30 min in hypertonic lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 400 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitations and Western Blotting—For immunoprecipitations, 500 μg of total cellular protein was incubated overnight with 0.5 μg of anti-IRS-1 or IRS-2 antibody and Protein A-agarose beads (Sigma). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in cold lysis buffer and agarose-bound protein was recovered in two times SDS loading buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol by boiling for 5 min. Western blotting was performed by denaturing 50 μg of protein at 100 °C for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 25% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were applied to 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and resolved at 100 V over 3 h. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) in transfer buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, 0.01% SDS, and 15% methanol using a Bio-Rad Trans-blot SD semidry transfer cell to which 150 mA were applied for 90 min. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm sodium chloride, and 0.5% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1 h.

Membranes were exposed to goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) at a dilution of 1:10,000 in 5% nonfat milk TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature. Signals were detected with a chemiluminescence detection system (Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Plus, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) and exposure to x-ray film. Akt Activity Assay—Akt activity was measured in cell lysates using an Akt assay kit (Cell Signaling) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Akt was precipitated from 250 μg of cellular protein with an anti-Akt monoclonal antibody covalently bound to agarose beads. After washing, kinase reactions were performed in the presence of 200 μm ATP and a GSK3 fusion protein as substrate. Samples were resolved on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and immunoblotting performed as described previously. Phosphorylated GSK3 fusion protein was detected with a phospho-GSK3 antibody directed against serine residues 9 and 21. As a control for the loading of equivalent amounts of protein among samples, levels of total GSK3 were examined with a phosphorylation-independent GSK3 antibody. RNA Isolation and Northern Blotting—RNA was extracted by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation as described previously (32Czaja M.J. Weiner F.R. Freedman J.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 147: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 100-mm tissue culture dishes as described above, harvested in phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged, and homogenized in 4 m guanidine thiocyanate. RNA was obtained by centrifugation in 5.7 m cesium chloride followed by repeated precipitations in ethanol. Steady-state RNA levels were determined by Northern blot analysis, as described previously (26Liu H. Lo C.R. Jones B.E. Pradhan Z. Srinivasan A. Valentino K.L. Stockert R.J. Czaja M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40155-40162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, 25 μg of total RNA were denaturated in 500 mm glyoxal, 45% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 10 mm phosphate buffer, resolved on a 1% agarose gel, transferred to GeneScreen membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and baked for 2 h at 80 °C. Membranes were prehybridized overnight, and then hybridized with [32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) labeled cDNA probes for rat phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) (33Beale E.G. Chrapkiewicz N.B. Scoble H.A. Metz R.J. Quick D.P. Noble R.L. Donelson J.E. Biemann K. Granner D.K. J. Biol.

Cell. 1980; 20: 95-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar) for 17 h at 42 °C. Membranes were washed and exposed to x-ray film as described previously (32Czaja M.J. Weiner F.R. Freedman J.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 147: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Measurement of Glucose Secretion—Cells were cultured in 35-mm dishes as described above. The medium was changed to glucose-free medium (Sigma) supplemented with 20 mm sodium lactate and 2 mm sodium pyruvate. Some cells were then treated for 3 h with 100 nm insulin after which glucose concentrations in the medium were determined using a commercial kit (Sigma). Results were normalized to total protein and expressed as the percentage decrease of glucose secretion in insulin-treated cells as compared with untreated controls. Adenovirus Infection—Replication-deficient adenoviruses expressing the Escherichia coli β-galactosidase gene (Ad5LacZ) (35Iimuro Y. Nishiura T. Hellerbrand C. Behrns K.E. Schoonhoven R. Grisham J.W. Brenner D.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 802-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), dominant negative JNK1 (AdJNK1dn), or dominant negative JNK2 (AdJNK2dn, kindly provided by J. D.

Adenoviruses were amplified in 293 cells, purified by banding twice on cesium chloride gradients, and titered by plaque assay. Cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 20 for 3 h at 37 °C 24 h prior to experiments, as described previously (26Liu H. Lo C.R. Jones B.E. Pradhan Z. Srinivasan A. Valentino K.L.

JNK Activity Assay—JNK activity was measured in cell lysates using a SAPK/JNK assay kit (Cell Signaling). An N-terminal c-Jun fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads was used to immobilize JNK from cell lysates containing 125 μg of total protein. After washing, the kinase reaction was performed in the presence of 100 μm ATP using the c-Jun fusion protein as substrate. Samples were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the amount of phosphorylated c-Jun detected with an antibody specific for c-Jun phosphorylated at serine residue 63. The equivalence of sample loading among reaction mixtures was assessed by immunoblotting with a rabbit phosphorylation-independent c-Jun antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Animal Model—All studies were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and followed the National Institutes of Health guidelines on the care and use of animals. C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were maintained in 12-h light/dark cycles with unlimited access to food and water. The mice were fed a methionine- and choline-deficient diet (MCD diet) or a corresponding control diet supplemented with 300 mg of dl-methionine and 200 mg of choline per 100 g (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Costa Mesa, CA). To accustom the animals to the high sucrose diet, all animals were initially placed on the control diet for 2 weeks. Animals were then randomly assigned to 4 additional weeks of either control diet or MCD diet. After 4 weeks, some of the animals were fasted overnight, anesthetized with ether, and given a portal vein injection of normal saline or 50 μmol of insulin/kg of body weight in normal saline. Liver tissue was excised 3 min following injection and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Portions of liver were sonicated in homogenization buffer containing 1 mm sodium bicarbonate, 0.5 mm calcium chloride, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described above, centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 2 h, and the resulting supernatant used for Western blotting. Statistical Analysis—All numerical results are expressed as mean ± S.E. and represent data from a minimum of three independent experiments. Calculations were made with Sigma Plot 2000 (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL). The intensities of signals on immunoblots were quantitated using a FluorChem densitometer (Alpha Innotech, San Leonardo, CA) and expressed numerically relative to the appropriate untreated control cell line. Statistical significance was determined by the Student's t test. CYP2E1 Overexpression in RALA Hepatocytes Decreases IRS Activation in Response to Insulin—IRS-1 and IRS-2 are adaptor proteins that mediate the activation of downstream effectors of insulin signaling. Upon insulin stimulation, these molecules are recruited to the insulin receptor, activated through tyrosine phosphorylation, and then down-regulated by inhibitory serine phosphorylation (5Virkamaki A. Ueki K. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 6White M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E413-E422Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To determine whether CYP2E1 overexpression decreased hepatocyte insulin signaling, we examined baseline and insulin-stimulated levels of IRS-1 and IRS-2 phosphorylation in cells with differential levels of CYP2E1 expression. Studies were performed in polyclonal cells transfected with an empty expression vector (VEC cells), and a RALA hepatocyte clone that overexpressed CYP2E1 following stable transfection with a CYP2E1 expression vector (S-CYP15 cells). Increased levels of CYP2E1 protein and catalytic activity have been previously demonstrated in S-CYP15 cells (28Jones B.E. Liu H. Lo C.R. Koop D.R. Czaja M.J. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2002; 4: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 29Schattenberg J.M. Wang Y. Rigoli R.M. Koop D.R. Czaja M.J. Hepatology. 2004; 39: 444-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). By Western blotting, constitutive IRS-1 protein expression was increased ∼4-fold in S-CYP15 cells as compared with VEC cells (Fig. 1A). The levels of IRS-1 were unaffected in either cell line by insulin for 30 min (Fig. 1A), although IRS-1 levels did decrease with longer insulin treatment (data not shown). IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was not detectable in untreated cells, but occurred within 5 min of insulin treatment in both cell types (Fig. 1A). The amount of insulin-induced IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation relative to the level of total IRS-1 was significantly greater in VEC cells than in S-CYP15 cells (Fig. 1B). Phosphorylation of the inhibitory serine 307 IRS-1 residue was absent in untreated VEC cells but present constitutively at high levels in S-CYP15 cells (Fig. 1A). After insulin treatment, levels of serine 307 phosphorylation increased in both cell types but remained 2-fold greater in S-CYP15 cells as compared with VEC cells after 30 min of insulin treatment (Fig. 1A). Findings were similar for a second inhibitory IRS-1 serine residue, serine 636/639. Levels of IRS-1 phosphorylation at serine 636/639 were elevated in untreated S-CYP15 cells, and further increased relative to VEC cells with insulin treatment (Fig. 1A). S-CYP15 cells therefore have decreased levels of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to insulin in association with constitutive and insulin-induced increases in inhibitory IRS-1 serine phosphorylation. Insulin signaling in the liver is transduced almost equally by IRS-1 and IRS-2 (7Kido Y. Burks D.J. Withers D. Bruning J.C. Kahn C.R. White M.F. Accili D. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 9Valverde A.M. Burks D.J. Fabregat I. Fisher T.L. Carretero J. White M.F. Benito M. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2239-2248Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To determine whether CYP2E1 overexpression also affected IRS-2 activation, levels of total and tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-2 were examined in the two cell lines. Constitutive levels of IRS-2 were equivalent in the two cell types and decreased with insulin treatment (Fig. 1A). A 6-fold increase in IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation resulted from insulin treatment of VEC cells (Fig. 1A). In contrast, levels of insulin-induced IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation in S-CYP15 cells were only 25% of those in VEC cells (Fig. 1A). Thus, CYP2E1 overexpression is associated with decreased insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of both IRS-1 and IRS-2. Alterations in IRS Phosphorylation Correlate with CYP2E1 Expression in Additional RALA Hepatocyte Clones—To ensure that the differences in total and phosphorylated IRS-1 and IRS-2 in S-CYP15 cells were secondary to increased CYP2E1 expression and not nonspecific clonal variation, insulin-induced IRS phosphorylation was examined in two additional S-CYP clones. The clone S-CYP29 has increased CYP2E1 protein and catalytic activity similar to S-CYP15 cells (29Schattenberg J.M. Wang Y. Rigoli R.M. Koop D.R. Czaja M.J. Hepatology. 2004; 39: 444-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In contrast, S-CYP43 cells fail to overexpress CYP2E1 despite transfection with the CYP2E1 expression plasmid, as previously determined by Western blotting and enzyme activity assays (29Schattenberg J.M. Wang Y. Rigoli R.M. Koop D.R. Czaja M.J. Hepatology. 2004; 39: 444-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The S-CYP29 clone had a 2-fold increase in IRS-1 protein levels similar to the increase in S-CYP15 cells, whereas IRS-1 levels in S-CYP43 cells were equivalent to those in VEC cells (Fig. 2)."

Their biosynthesis is essential for mycobacterial growth and represents an attractive target for developing new antituberculous drugs. We have previously shown that the pks13 gene encodes condensase, the enzyme that performs the final condensation step of mycolic acid biosynthesis and is flanked by two genes, fadD32 and accD4. To determine the functions of the gene products we generated two mutants of C. glutamicum with an insertion/deletion within either fadD32 or accD4. The two mutant strains were deficient in mycolic acid production and exhibited the colony morphology that typifies the mycolate-less mutants of corynebacteria. Application of multiple analytical approaches to the analysis of the mutants demonstrated the accumulation of a tetradecylmalonic acid in the ΔfadD32::km mutant and its absence from the ΔaccD4::km strain. The parental corynebacterial phenotype was restored upon the transfer of the wild-type fadD32 and accD4 genes in the mutants. These data demonstrated that both FadD32 and AccD4-containing acyl-CoA carboxylase are required for the production of mycolic acids. They also prove that the proteins catalyze, respectively, the activation of one fatty acid substrate and the carboxylation of the other substrate, solving the long-debated question of the mechanism involved in the condensation reaction. We used comparative genomics and applied a combination of molecular biology and proteomic technologies to the analysis of proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with AccD4. This resulted in the identification of AccA3 and AccD5 as subunits of the acyl-CoA carboxylase. Finally, we used conditionally replicative plasmids to show that both the fadD32 and accD4 genes are essential for the survival of M. smegmatis. Thus, in addition to Pks13, FadD32 and AccD4 are promising targets for the development of new antimicrobial drugs against pathogenic species of mycobacteria and related microorganisms.

Mycolic acids, long-chain 2-alkyl, 3-hydroxy fatty acids, are the hallmark of Corynebacterineae, a suprageneric actinomycete group that includes corynebacteria, mycobacteria, nocardia, rhodococci, and other related microorganisms. In mycobacteria, these fatty acids, called eumycolic acids, possess a very long chain (C60–C90) and may contain various oxygen functions, cyclopropyl rings, and methyl branches, in addition to the 3-hydroxyl group (1Daffé M.

In contrast, mycolic acids found in other genera consist of homologous mixtures of saturated and unsaturated acids and contain shorter chains, e.g. C40–C50 in nocardomycolic acids and C22–C36 in corynomycolic acids (5Collins M.D. Goodfellow M.

Mycolic acids represent the major lipid constituents of the singular cell envelope of Corynebacterineae and are found either as esters of trehalose or esterifying the terminal penta-arabinofuranosyl units of arabinogalactan, a polysaccharide that forms (with peptidoglycan and mycolic acids) the cell wall skeleton of the cell envelope of the Corynebacterineae members (1Daffé M.

Both types of mycolate-containing components have been shown to play a crucial role in the structure and functions of the cell envelope.

Trehalose mycolates have been implicated in numerous biological functions, notably in mycobacterial virulence, in which the structure of the mycolates has been shown to be important for the initial replication and persistence of pathogenic mycobacterial species in their hosts (10Glickman M.S.

C.2000: 173-190Google Scholar), the biosynthesis pathway leading to mycolic acids is far from being completely understood. Nevertheless, it is currently admitted that, in mycobacteria, the biosynthesis of the very long-chain C60–C90 mycolic acids involves two fatty acid synthases, namely, fatty acid synthase I and fatty acid synthase II (2Asselineau C. Asselineau J. Lanéelle G. Lanéelle M.-A. Prog. Lipid Res. 2002; 41: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 4Barry III, C.E. Lee R.E. Mdluli K. Sampson A.E. Schroeder B.G. Slayden R.A.

ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2000: 173-190Google Scholar). In contrast, only fatty acid synthase I, a synthase necessary for the production of C16, 18, would be sufficient in bacterial species that synthesize shorter mycolic acids. In mycobacteria, fatty acid synthase I has been shown to be a bimodal system capable of elongating C16, 18 fatty acids to yield C22–26 saturated fatty acids that may be either incorporated directly into mycolates as the two-branched chain or used as substrates of the fatty acid synthase II system to form C48–C64 fatty acids, also called the meromycolate chain. The finding that isoniazid strongly and specifically inhibits InhA, an enoyl-ACP-reductase that belongs to fatty acid synthase II (15Banerjee A. Dubnau E. Quémard A. Balasubramanian V. Um K.S.

Academic Press, London1980: 189-239Google Scholar), the mycolic motif (Fig. 1), the enzymes involved in the formation of this motif represent good potential targets for the development of new and specific drugs against Corynebacterineae. Two mechanisms have been proposed for the synthesis of the C32 corynomycolic acid (17Gastambide-Odier M. Lederer E. Biochem. Z. 1960; 333: 285-295PubMed Google Scholar): (i) a “Claisen-like” condensation, in which a palmitoyl thioester is condensed with either another palmitoyl CoA or a palmitaldehyde to give a 2-alkyl, 3-oxo ester; and (ii) a “malonic” condensation, similar to the reaction catalyzed by β-ketoacyl synthase, in which a palmitoyl CoA is condensed with a tetradecylmalonyl-CoA, followed by decarboxylation. In both cases, an enzyme, the condensase, is required for the condensation of the two fatty acyl substrates to yield 2-alkyl, 3-keto ester that subsequently has to be reduced to produce the C32 corynomycolic acid. We have recently identified Pks13 as the condensase (18Portevin D. de Sousa-D'Auria C. Houssin C. Grimaldi C. Chami M. Daffé M. Guilhot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). This enzyme contains the required enzymatic domains for the condensation reaction, and the gene encoding this protein has been found in all members of the Corynebacterineae group analyzed. In Corynebacterium glutamicum, the inactivation of the pks13 gene completely abolishes the production of corynomycolates and, as a consequence, alters the structure of the cell envelope of the mutant strain (18Portevin D. de Sousa-D'Auria C. Houssin C. Grimaldi C. Chami M. Daffé M. Guilhot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In mycobacteria, we demonstrated that the pks13 gene is essential for the mycobacterial growth (18Portevin D. de Sousa-D'Auria C. Houssin C. Grimaldi C. Chami M. Daffé M. Guilhot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The remaining important question, addressed in the present work, is which of the two condensation mechanisms (Claisen-like or malonic reaction) is used by Corynebacterineae to synthesize the mycolic acid motif. Interestingly, two genes that may encode proteins involved in the activation of the two substrates of the condensase flank the pks13 gene in all Corynebacterineae examined (18Portevin D. de Sousa-D'Auria C. Houssin C. Grimaldi C. Chami M. Daffé M. Guilhot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). One of these genes, fadD32, predicted to encode an acyl-CoA synthase, was recently shown to be an acyl-AMP ligase (19Trivedi O.A. Arora P. Sridharan V. Tickoo R. Mohanty D. Gokhale R.S. Nature. 2004; 428: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The other, accD4, is predicted to encode a subunit of an acyl-CoA carboxylase, a class of enzyme catalyzing the formation of carboxylated acyl-CoA. The present study was undertaken in order to determine the roles of the candidate enzymes in mycolic acid biosynthesis and to evaluate their importance for the physiology of corynebacteria and mycobacteria.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and Culture Conditions—C. glutamicum (ATCC13032 RES167) (20Dusch N. Puhler A. Kalinowski J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 1530-1539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was cultured on Brain Heart Infusion medium (Difco). M. smegmatis mc2155 was grown on Middlebrook 7H9 medium (Difco) supplemented with 0.05% Tween 80 to prevent aggregation. Escherichia coli DH5α (21Woodcock D.M. Crowther P.J. Doherty J. Jefferson S.

Ampicillin, kanamycin (Km), 1The abbreviations used are: Km, kanamycin; Hyg, hygromycin; Suc, sucrose; GC, gas chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; cfu, colony-forming unit(s). hygromycin (Hyg), chloramphenicol, and sucrose (Suc) were added when required at final concentrations of 100 μg/ml, 40 μg/ml (for M. smegmatis) or 25 μg/ml (for C. glutamicum and E. coli), 50 μg/ml, 15 μg/ml, or 30 μg/ml (for C. glutamicum and E. coli, respectively), and 5% (w/v), respectively.Computer Analysis—M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv and M. leprae DNA sequences were obtained from the Pasteur Institute web site (www.pasteur.fr). Research of FadD32 and AccD4 orthologs on M. smegmatis, C. diphtheriae, C. glutamicum, and C. efficiens genomes was performed at the National Center for Biotechnology Information web site (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) using the BLAST program. Multiple sequence alignments were performed using Clustal W (22Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55217) Google Scholar) at the Pasteur Institute web site. The sequence of AccD4 was compared with the α and β subunits of the carboxyltransferase of E. coli (encoded by gene accA and accD) using the Needleman-Wunsh program on the Pasteur Institute web site.The Mascot search engine (Matrix Science, London, UK) was used for protein identification with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) by searching in nonredundant NCBInr TrEMBL and Swiss-Prot databases. Because most of the M. smegmatis protein sequences were not found in these databases, eight M. smegmatis proteins corresponding to the candidate subunits for being an acyl-CoA carboxylase (namely, the orthologs of AccA1, AccA2, AccA3, AccD1, AccD2, AccD3, AccD4, and AccD5 from M. tuberculosis) were added to the databases. The identification resulting from a Mascot search was confirmed by manual interpretation of corresponding MS/MS data.Construction of the C. glutamicum ΔfadD32::km and ΔaccD4::km Mutants and Complementation Plasmids—The C. glutamicum ΔfadD32::km and ΔaccD4::km mutants were produced using a strategy described previously (18Portevin D. de Sousa-D'Auria C.

Two DNA fragments (each of 0.8 kb in length) overlapping the fadD32 gene at its 5′ and 3′ extremities were amplified by PCR from C. glutamicum total DNA using primers Faddel1 + Faddel5 and Faddel3 + Faddel4 (Table I). These two fragments were inserted flanking a kanamycin resistance cassette (km) from plasmid pCGL243 (23Reyes O. Guyonvarch A. Bonamy C. Salti V. David F. Leblon G. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 107: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) into the vector pMCS5 (MoBiTec, Göttingen, Germany) to give pMCSΔfad. The same strategy was used to produce a plasmid in which two DNA fragments (each of 0.7 kb in length) overlapping the 5′ and 3′ extremities of the accD4 gene of C. glutamicum were cloned flanking the km resistance cassette. These two PCR fragments were obtained using primers Accdel1 + Accdel2 and Accdel3 + Accdel4 (Table I), and the plasmid was named pMCSΔacc. The two plasmids were transferred into C. glutamicum by electroporation, and transformants were selected on plates containing Km. Transformants in which allelic replacement had occurred between the wild-type chromosomal fadD32 or accD4 genes and the mutated plasmid-borne alleles were identified on the basis of their rough colony morphology and characterized by PCR using primers Fad2, Fad4, Fad5, pks2, k7, and k10 for the mutant within the fadD32 gene and AccI, AccII, AccIII, Acc5, k7, and k10 for the insertion within accD4 (Table I). Two mutant strains, C. glutamicum ΔfadD32::km and ΔaccD4::km (named CGL2034 and CGL2030, respectively), were retained for further studies.Table IPrimers used for the construction of the C. glutamicum and M. smegmatis mutant strains and the complementation plasmidsPrimerSequence (5′→3′)C. glutamicumAccdel1ATCAAGATCTACTCCGATGGCAccdel2CGTTCACTACCGCGGTCTTTGGCAccdel3CGATCATGCCGCGGTAACGTCCAccdel4TGAACCGCTCGAGGTCCTTGCAcc1GCATCGATGGTCGCCCAGAcc2GAACGAGTTCAGAGCTTCAccNcoGCTGACGGACCATGGGTAACACFaddel1ATTGCGGGAGATCTGGCTGCTCFaddel3TCCGCTCCGCGGTTGGCACTGCFaddel4AGGCTCGCCCTCGAGAAGGCGCFaddel5TTTATCCCCGCGGCCTTCAGCFad2TCTGACCACCTTCCGTGAAGCFad3AATGATGAGATCTGTGATGCTCCGFad4GCTGATGTTTCTACAGATCTTTCCPks2CCAGGGCAGTTGCTTCAATGPks6ACGGAGATCTATCTGGATAATTCPks5GGCCTCAACATGTCACAGAGCpKKBamGACGGATCCGGCCAATGCTTCTGGpKKNcoGCCATGGTTTAAACCTCCTTATCGM. smegmatisF32aGACTAGTCAGATCACGCTGCACGAGGTGF32bGGAATTCCTTGATGTCGGTGAGGTAGCF32cGCATGCGGACGACGGTCAAGF32dGGTACCAGCACGGCTCTGACACAGF32fACTAGTTCAGTCGGTGGCATCCGGGAF32eGGTAACGTCGGTGGCATCCGGGAAGTAcc4aCGCACGTTCAACGTCGAGATCAcc4bCACGTCGAAGTGGTTGATCCTCAcc4cGCTGGCGTTCAACTGGAATGTCAcc4dCTGCAGACGAACAAGACCACCGCTGAACAcc4fACTAGTCTACAGCGGCAGCAGACCGTGH1AGCACCAGCGGTTCGCCGTH2TGCACGACTTCGAGGTGTTCGmyc-PAGATCCGAACAAAAGCTGATCTCGGAGGAGGATCTGCTGCAmyc-PBGCAGATCCTCCTCCGAGATCAGCTTTTGTTCGmyc-KAGATCCGAACAAAAGCTGATCTCGGAGGAGGATCTGGGTACmyc-KBCCAGATCCTCCTCCGAGATCAGCTTTTGTTCG Open table in a new tab To complement the ΔfadD32::km mutation, a 2.3-kb DNA fragment carrying the fadD32 gene plus the 370 bp upstream of the putative start codon of this gene was amplified by PCR using primers Fad3 + Fad4 (Table I) and C. glutamicum genomic DNA. The amplified DNA fragment was inserted between the BglII and SmaI sites of pCGL482, which contains a replicon functional in C. glutamicum (24Peyret J.-L. Bayan N. Joliff G. Gulik-Krzywicki T. Mathieu L. Shechter E. Leblon G. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), to give pCGL2319.Because the intergenic region between accD4 and the upstream gene, pks13, is just 21 bp, these two genes may be part of the same operon. Because the promotor driving the expression of accD4 is not located just upstream the gene and is not yet characterized, we chose to clone the accD4 gene under the control of another promotor functional in C. glutamicum in order to complement the ΔaccD4::km mutation. A 1.6-kb DNA fragment was amplified by PCR using primers AccNco and pks6 (Table I) from the C. glutamicum genomic DNA. The primer AccNco was designed to introduce a NcoI restriction site overlapping the putative start codon of accD4. The PCR fragment was digested with enzymes NcoI and BglII. A second DNA fragment containing the well-characterized ptrc promotor, which was previously shown to be functional in C. glutamicum (25Brosius J. Biotechnology. 1988; 10: 205-225PubMed Google Scholar), was generated using primers pKKBam and pKKNco (Table I) and pKK388-1 plasmid (Clontech) as template DNA. This second PCR fragment was digested with NcoI and BamHI. The two PCR fragments were then inserted simultaneously between the BamHI and BglII restriction sites of plasmid pCGL482 to give plasmid pCGL2316. The two plasmids, pCGL2319 and pCGL2316, were used for electrotransformation of the C. glutamicum ΔfadD32::km and ΔaccD4::km mutants, respectively. Transformants were selected on chloramphenicol-containing plates.Construction of the M. smegmatis Conditional Mutant Strains—The M. smegmatis conditional mutant strains were produced using the strategy described previously (18Portevin D. de Sousa-D'Auria C. Houssin C. Grimaldi C. Chami M. Daffé M. Guilhot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Briefly, two DNA fragments, overlapping the accD4 and the fadD32 genes, were amplified by PCR from M. smegmatis total DNA using primers Acc4a + Acc4b and F32a + F32b, respectively. The fragment overlapping the fadD32 gene was digested with SpeI and EcoRV and inserted into the corresponding sites of plasmid pJQ200 (26Quandt J. Hymes M.F. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 127: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar) to give pDP59. A hygromycin resistance cassette (hyg) was inserted between the two BamHI sites of pDP65 (located within the fadD32 gene) to yield pDP60. The fragment overlapping the accD4 gene was first inserted into the pGEM-T vector using the pGEM-T vector system I kit (Promega). The hyg cassette was inserted into the unique XhoI site within the cloned accD4 gene to give plasmid pDP62. A DNA fragment containing the disrupted accD4::hyg allele was inserted between the SmaI and SpeI sites of pJQ200 to yield pDP63.Plasmids pDP60 and pDP63 were transferred into M. smegmatis by electroporation, and transformants were selected on Hyg-containing plates. Transformants in which pDP60 or pDP63 had been integrated by single crossover between the wild-type and mutated copies of fadD32 or accD4 were characterized by PCR using primers F32c, F32d, F32f, H1, and H2 for fadD32 and primers Acc4c, Acc4d, Acc4f, H1, and H2 for accD4. For each construct, one clone giving the pattern corresponding to insertion of the plasmid by single homologous recombination event was retained for further analysis. These strains, obtained with the integration of pDP60 and pDP63, were renamed PMM58 and PMM59, respectively.To produce the complementation plasmids, the fadD32 and accD4 genes were amplified by PCR from M. smegmatis total DNA using primers F32d + F32f and Acc4d + Acc4f, respectively (Table I). The PCR fragments were inserted into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) to give plasmids pDP65 and pDP64 containing the fadD32 and accD4 genes, respectively. The fadD32 gene was recovered from plasmid pDP65 on a KpnI/SpeI restriction fragment and inserted between the corresponding sites of plasmid pMIP12. The resulting plasmid, named pDP66, contained the fadD32 gene under the control of the pBlaF* mycobacterial promotor (27Le Dantec C. Winter N. Gicquel B. Vincent V. Picardeau M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2157-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A cassette containing the pBlaF* promotor, the fadD32 gene, and a transcription terminator was obtained on a PacI/AseI restriction fragment and inserted into thermosensitive mycobacterial plasmid pDP24 derived from pCG63 (28Guilhot C. Gicquel B. Martin C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 98: 181-186Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar) by deletion of a useless AhdI fragment. This new plasmid was named pDP69. A similar strategy was used with the accD4 gene. A PstI/SpeI fragment carrying the accD4 gene without promotor was inserted into the PstI and SpeI sites of pMIP12 to give pDP67. A PacI/AseI cassette from pDP67, containing the accD4 gene now under the control of the pBlaF* promotor, was then transferred into the pDP24 thermosensitive vector to give pDP70.Plasmids pDP69 and pDP70 were transferred by electroporation into PMM58 and PMM59, respectively. Transformants were selected on plates containing Km and Hyg. The second crossover events at the chromosomal fadD32 and accD4 loci were selected by plating a liquid culture of PMM58:pDP69 and PMM59:pDP70 cultured at 30 °C on plates containing Km, Hyg, and Suc, which were then incubated at 30 °C. Colonies were screened by PCR using primers F32c, F32d, F32f, H1, and H2 for fadD32 and Acc4c, Acc4d, Acc4f, H1, and H2 for accD4. Two strains, named PMM61:pDP69, in which the wild-type chromosomal copy of fadD32 was replaced by the mutated fadD32::hyg allele, and PMM60:pDP70, in which the wild-type chromosomal copy of accD4 was replaced by the mutated accD4::hyg allele, were selected for phenotypic analysis.Construction of Plasmids for Immunoprecipitation—To perform the immunoprecipitation experiments in M. smegmatis, two new plasmids containing either the fadD32 gene or the accD4 gene fused to the myc tag were constructed. Briefly, two double-stranded oligonucleotides were produced by annealing either myc-PA with myc-PB or myc-KA with myc-KB in 40 μl containing 45 μm of each single-stranded"
https://openalex.org/W1982576150,"Inherited prion diseases are linked to mutations in the prion protein (PrP) gene, which favor conversion of PrP into a conformationally altered, pathogenic isoform. The cellular mechanism by which this process causes neurological dysfunction is unknown. It has been proposed that neuronal death can be triggered by accumulation of PrP in the cytosol because of impairment of proteasomal degradation of misfolded PrP molecules retrotranslocated from the endoplasmic reticulum (Ma, J., Wollmann, R., and Lindquist, S. (2002) Science 298, 1781–1785). To test whether this neurotoxic mechanism is operative in inherited prion diseases, we evaluated the effect of proteasome inhibitors on the viability of transfected N2a cells and primary neurons expressing mouse PrP homologues of the D178N and nine octapeptide mutations. We found that the inhibitors caused accumulation of an unglycosylated, aggregated form of PrP exclusively in transfected N2a expressing PrP from the cytomegalovirus promoter. This form contained an uncleaved signal peptide, indicating that it represented polypeptide chains that had failed to translocate into the ER lumen during synthesis, rather than retrogradely translocated PrP. Quantification of N2a viability in the presence of proteasome inhibitors demonstrated that accumulation of this form was not toxic. No evidence of cytosolic PrP was found in cerebellar granule neurons from transgenic mice expressing wild-type or mutant PrPs from the endogenous promoter, nor were these neurons more susceptible to proteasome inhibitor toxicity than neurons from PrP knock-out mice. Our analysis fails to confirm the previous observation that mislocation of PrP in the cytosol is neurotoxic, and argues against the hypothesis that perturbation of PrP metabolism through the proteasomal pathway plays a pathogenic role in prion diseases.

Prion diseases are neurodegenerative disorders caused by the conformational conversion of the cellular prion protein (PrPC), 1The abbreviations used are: PrPC, cellular isoform of the prion protein; CGN, cerebellar granule neurons; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; CMV, cytomegalovirus; endo H, endoglycosidase H; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERAD, endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation; FBS, fetal bovine serum; MTT, (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PrP, prion protein; PrPSc, scrapie isoform of the prion protein; SP, signal peptide; Tg, transgenic; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl. a cell surface glycoprotein of uncertain function, into PrPSc, an insoluble and protease-resistant isoform, which propagates itself by imposing its abnormal conformation onto PrPC molecules (1Collinge J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 519-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). This conformational conversion is thought to occur spontaneously in PrP molecules carrying mutations associated with inherited prion diseases, including Gerstmann-Sträussler-Sheinker syndrome (GSS), fatal familial insomnia (FFI), and familial forms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). However, the precise mechanism of this conversion process and the nature of the cellular pathways that are activated leading to neuronal death remain obscure (2Chiesa R. Harris D.A. Neurobiol. Dis. 2001; 8: 743-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Although PrPSc is commonly assumed to be the primary cause of neurodegeneration in prion diseases, the evidence that some inherited prion disorders are not transmissible and can arise in the presence of low or undetectable levels of PrPSc has led to the hypothesis that other abnormal species of PrP could be the actual proximate cause of neurodegeneration (2Chiesa R. Harris D.A. Neurobiol. Dis. 2001; 8: 743-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 3Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. DeFea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B.

Virol. 2003; 77: 7611-7622Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Research on inherited prion diseases has focused on how PrP is synthesized and metabolized by the cell, and how pathogenic mutations alter this process. Pulse-chase labeling experiments indicated that mutant PrP molecules misfold very soon after synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (6Daude N. Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11604-11612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that they are recognized as abnormal by the ER quality control machinery, and diverted to ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Consistent with this hypothesis, it was observed that several mutant PrPs were present at low levels on the cell surface, and localized in intracellular compartments, including the ER and cytoplasm (7Petersen R.B.

It was also found that the proteasome inhibitor ALLN (Ac-Leu-Leu-NorLeu-al) affected the metabolism and cellular localization of PrP molecules carrying the amber mutation Y145stop, and the Q217R substitution linked to GSS (11Zanusso G.

More recently, it was observed that the same peptide aldehyde inhibitor, as well as MG132 (Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-al), caused accumulation of unglycosylated, insoluble PrP in the cytosol of transfected cells expressing the wild-type form of the protein, arguing that a fraction of PrP molecules was normally diverted to ERAD (13Yedidia Y. Horonchik L. Tzaban S. Yanai A. Taraboulos A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5383-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 14Ma J. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Based on these observations, it was hypothesized that neurodegeneration in genetically inherited and sporadic prion diseases may ensue from abnormal accumulation of toxic PrP species in the cytoplasm of neurons because of alteration of proteasome activity, as it may naturally occur with stress and aging. Several pieces of evidence were provided to support the contention that mislocalization of PrP in the cytoplasm was selectively toxic to neurons. First, it was shown that overexpression of wild-type PrP rendered neuroblastoma N2a cells, but not non-neuronal cells, more susceptible to apoptosis induced by proteasome inhibitors; secondly, artificial expression of PrP in the cytoplasm, using a PrP construct lacking the N-terminal signal sequence, was found to be highly toxic to N2a cells but not to fibroblast-derived cells; finally, transgenic (Tg) mice expressing cytosolic PrP were found to develop a neurological dysfunction characterized by selective degeneration of the granule neurons in the cerebellum (4Ma J. Wollmann R. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The physiopathological relevance of ERAD in prion disease, however, was questioned by the observation that neither wild-type, nor mutant PrPs were a major substrate for retrotranslocation and proteasomal degradation in several cell types, including Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, and primary cerebellar granule neurons (16Drisaldi B. Stewart R.S. Adles C. Stewart L.R. Quaglio E. Biasini E. Fioriti L. Chiesa R. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21732-21743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The proteasome inhibitors, in fact, failed to cause accumulation of PrP in the cytoplasm of untransfected cells and primary neurons from Tg mice that expressed PrP from the endogenous promoter. Conversely, in transfected CHO and PC12 cells expressing PrP from the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, the proteasome inhibitors induced accumulation of an unglycosylated form of PrP that resided on the cytoplasmic face of the ER. However, this form contained an uncleaved signal peptide, indicating that it originated from abortive translocation rather than retrograde transport from the ER lumen, probably because of saturation of the translocation machinery under conditions of elevated expression typical of transfected cells (16Drisaldi B. Stewart R.S. Adles C. Stewart L.R. Quaglio E. Biasini E. Fioriti L. Chiesa R. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21732-21743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In fact, this phenomenon was exacerbated by pharmacological inhibition of the proteasome, because it was found that the inhibitors induced strong transcription of CMV-driven cDNAs (16Drisaldi B. Stewart R.S. Adles C. Stewart L.R. Quaglio E. Biasini E. Fioriti L. Chiesa R. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21732-21743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 17Biasini E. Fioriti L. Ceglia I. Invernizzi R. Bertoli A. Chiesa R. Forloni G. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although these data indicated that PrP was not a major substrate for ERAD, the possibility remained that under physiological conditions, low, undetectable amounts of PrP were delivered into the cytosol of neurons by either retrotranslocation or abortive translocation, and accumulate to toxic level if not efficiently degraded by the proteasome. If this mechanism played a primary pathogenic role in inherited prion diseases, then mutant PrPs should be diverted to proteasomal degradation more frequently than the wild-type protein. Consequently, neurons expressing mutant PrP molecules should accumulate higher level of PrP in the cytosol under condition of proteasome impairment, and be more vulnerable to proteasome inhibitors than cells expressing wild-type PrP; conversely, cells that express low level of PrP, or do not express PrP at all, should be relatively protected from the toxic effect of the inhibitors. Consistent with the prediction that pathogenic mutations should increase the amount of PrP in the cytosol, it was observed that mouse PrP molecules carrying a substitution at codon 177, homologous to the D178N mutation linked to FFI, were spontaneously delivered to the cytoplasm of transiently transfected COS cells more frequently than wild-type PrP (14Ma J. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14955-14960Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). However, in one published experiment in which D178N PrP was expressed in primary human neurons by cDNA microinjection, no effect on cell viability was observed when ERAD was pharmacologically inhibited (18Roucou X. Guo Q. Zhang Y. Goodyer C.G. LeBlanc A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40877-40881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In this study we have systematically assessed the effect of proteasome inhibitors on the viability of N2a cells that express endogenous PrP or overexpress wild-type or mutant PrP molecules carrying the D177N substitution or a nine-octapeptide insertion (PG14) under the control of the CMV promoter. Additionally, we have analyzed the cellular localization of wild-type, D177N, and PG14 PrP in primary cerebellar granule neurons from Tg mice expressing the protein from its natural promoter, and compared their viability in the presence of proteasome inhibitors to that of neurons from PrP knock-out mice. Our analysis fails to confirm observations made by other laboratories, and argues against the hypothesis that cytosolic PrP plays a primary pathogenic role in inherited prion diseases. Mice—Production of transgenic mice expressing wild-type and PG14 mouse PrPs tagged with an epitope for the monoclonal antibody 3F4 has been reported previously (19Chiesa R. Piccardo P. Ghetti B. Harris D.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1339-1351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In this study, we used transgenic mice of the Tg(WT-E1+/+) line that express 4× the endogenous PrP level, referred throughout the text as Tg(WT), as well as Tg(PG14-A3+/–) mice expressing PG14 PrP at the endogenous level. Tg(D177N) mice expressing 3F4-tagged mouse PrP carrying the D177N/M128 or D177N/V128 mutation under the control of the mouse PrP promoter were generated as described previously (19Chiesa R. Piccardo P. Ghetti B. Harris D.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1339-1351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). (Detailed characterization of these mice will be presented elsewhere.) For this study, we used Tg(D177N/M128+/–) and Tg(D177N/V128+/–) mouse lines that express transgenic PrP at the endogenous level. All these transgenic lines were originally generated on a C57BL/6J X CBA/J hybrid and were subsequently bred with the Zürich I line of Prnp0/0 mice (C57BL/6J X 129 background) (20Bueler H. Fischer M. Lang Y. Bluethmann H. Lipp H.P. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Aguet M. Weissmann C. Nature. 1992; 356: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar), resulting in animals that express Tg PrP but not endogenous mouse PrP. The Prnp0/0 mice used in this study were non-transgenic littermates of Tg(D177N) and Tg(PG14) animals. Cell Culture—Cerebellar granule neurons were prepared according to the procedure of Miller and Johnson (21Miller T.M. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7487-7495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the exception that cerebella were from mice at postnatal day 6. Briefly, cerebella were dissected, sliced into ∼1-mm pieces and incubated in HBSS (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 0.3 mg/ml trypsin (Sigma) at 37 °C for 15 min. Trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, and the tissue was mechanically dissociated by passing through a flame-polished Pasteur pipette. Cells were plated at 350–400,000 cells/cm2 on poly-l-lysine (0.1 mg/ml)-coated plates. Cells were maintained in Basal Medium Eagle (BME, Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma), penicillin/streptomycin, and KCl 25 mm (K25 + S), at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. To reduce the number of non-neuronal cells, aphidicolin (3.3 μg/ml, Sigma) was added to the medium 36 h after plating. Non-neuronal contamination of the cultures was assessed as described, and found to be less than 3% (21Miller T.M. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7487-7495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). N2a cells (ATCC CCL-131) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and minimal essential medium α 1:1 supplemented with 10% FBS, non-essential amino acids and penicillin/streptomycin, and maintained in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. cDNAs encoding wild-type, PG14, and D177N/M128 moPrPs derived from the Prn-pa allele and containing the 3F4 epitope tag (22Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1633-1637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) were cloned into the pCDNA3 expression plasmid (Invitrogen). N2a cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two days after transfection, cells were split in complete medium supplemented with the antibiotic G418 (750 μg/ml, Clontech). Resistant clones were isolated after 2 weeks of exposure to G418, expanded, and tested for moPrP expression by immunoblotting using the 3F4 monoclonal antibody. Treatment of the Cultures and Quantification of Cell Viability— Cerebellar granule neurons were exposed to proteasome inhibitors 6 days after plating. N2a cells were plated at 20,000 cell/cm2 and treated with the inhibitors for the indicated times. Cell viability was assessed by measuring the level of cellular reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) to formazan (23Chiesa R. Fioriti L. Tagliavini F. Salmona M. Forloni G. Lehmann S. Grassi J. Techniques in Prion Research. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel2004: 176-197Crossref Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with 0.4 mg/ml MTT, dissolved in 0.04 n HCl in 2-propyl alcohol, and analyzed spectrophotometrically at 540 nm with an automatic microplate reader (Labsystems Multiskan MS). Antibodies—Monoclonal antibody 3F4 (24Kascsak R.J. Rubenstein R. Merz P.A. Tonna-DeMasi M. Fersko R. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used at dilutions 1:5,000 for Western blotting and 1:500 for immunofluorescence staining. Polyclonal antibody P45–66, raised against a synthetic peptide encompassing residues 45–66 of mouse PrP (25Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24589-24597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), was used at 1:2,500 for Western blot. An antibody (anti-SP) that selectively recognizes forms of murine PrP containing an uncleaved signal peptide was used at 1:500 for Western blot (26Stewart R.S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45960-45968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Anti-giantin (Covance) and anti-trap (Upstate Biotechnologies) antibodies were used, respectively, at 1:1,000 and 1:500 for immunofluorescence staining. Biochemical Analysis—To assay detergent insolubility, cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 containing protease inhibitors (pepstatin and leupeptin, 1 μg/ml; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm; and EDTA, 2 mm). After a brief centrifugation to remove debris, lysates corresponding to 300 μg of protein were centrifuged at 186,000 × g for 40 min in a Beckman Optima Max-E ultracentrifuge. Proteins in the pellet and supernatant were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore). Membranes were incubated with 5% nonfat dry milk in 100 mm Tris pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (TTBS). Membranes were then incubated with anti-PrP antibody overnight at 4 °C or 1 h at room temperature, rinsed three times with TTBS and incubated 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (diluted 1:5,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoreactivity was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence—Cells grown on poly-l-lysine-coated chamber slides (Nunc) or glass coverslips were washed with PBS, fixed for 1 h at 4 °C with 4% paraformaldehyde and 5% sucrose in PBS, and permeabilized for 1 min at room temperature with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS. After washing with PBS, cells were blocked with 2% FBS and 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS, and then incubated with the primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or Alexa 546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc.) diluted 1:500 in blocking solution. For surface staining of PrP, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with anti-PrP antibody diluted in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.). After washing with PBS, cells were reacted with the secondary antibody, washed with PBS and fixed. The microscope slides were mounted with 30% glycerol in PBS, or Floursave (Calbiochem) and viewed on an Olympus FV500 laser confocal scanning system. Transfected N2a Synthesize a Signal Peptide-bearing Form of Cytoplasmic PrP That Is Not Toxic—To investigate the potential neurotoxicity of cytoplasmic accumulation of mutant PrP, we generated stably transfected clones of N2a cells overexpressing D177N or PG14 PrP, and compared their viability in the presence of proteasome inhibitors to that of untransfected or transfected N2a expressing wild-type PrP. In preliminary experiments we investigated the effect of proteasome inhibitors on the metabolism and biochemical properties of PrP. Western blot analysis of N2a cells treated with MG132 for 24 h showed that the inhibitor caused a dramatic change in the distribution of PrP glycoforms, with a striking increase of a low molecular mass band resembling unglycosylated PrP, which at the highest concentration of inhibitor was the only species detected (Fig. 1A, top panel, lanes 2 and 3). This molecular species was induced also by treatment with epoxomicin and ALLN (Fig. 3C and data not shown); however, it was observed only in transfected cells. In untransfected N2a expressing low levels of endogenous PrP this band was not induced, and the inhibitors caused a striking reduction of all PrP glycoforms (Fig. 1A, top panel, lanes 4–6). In transfected cells the effect of proteasome inhibitors on induction of the low molecular mass species was highly variable. In some experiments, the low molecular mass band was the primary PrP species detected (Fig. 1A, top panel, lane 3), while in other experiments there was accumulation of an additional PrP band of higher molecular mass (Figs. 1B and 3, A and C, see description below). The lower molecular species that accumulated upon proteasome inhibition had an apparent mass of ∼27 kDa, and was ∼2 kDa larger than the mature, unglycosylated form (Fig. 1A, top panel, compare lanes 2 and 3 with lane 1). Its electrophoretic mobility did not change after digestion with either endo H or PNGase F (not shown), indicating that it did not represent an altered glycoform of PrP.Fig. 3Proteasome inhibitors cytotoxicity is independent of accumulation of untranslocated PrP. Stably transfected N2a cells expressing wild-type PrP were incubated with 50 μm MG132 (A) or 5 μm epoxomicin (C) for 4 h (lanes 2 and 4) or 24 h (lane 3), or were exposed to the vehicle alone for 24 h (lane 1). At the end of the incubation, cells were lysed immediately (lanes 1, 2, and 3) or were transferred to inhibitor-free medium for 20 h (lane 4), and PrP in each sample was analyzed by Western blot with the antibody 3F4. Cell viability was evaluated by MTT assay of sister cultures (B and D). Each bar represents the mean ± S.E. of 8–12 determinations from two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether the 27-kDa band corresponded to the untranslocated form of PrP induced by the proteasome inhibitors in transfected CHO and PC12 cells (16Drisaldi B. Stewart R.S. Adles C. Stewart L.R. Quaglio E. Biasini E. Fioriti L. Chiesa R. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21732-21743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), Western blots of N2a lysates were reacted with an antibody (anti-SP), which selectively recognizes the PrP signal peptide (26Stewart R.S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45960-45968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We found that the 27-kDa band was labeled by this antibody (Fig. 1A, lower panel, lanes 2 and 3), indicating that the main form of PrP that accumulated in N2a cells upon treatment with MG132 corresponded to untranslocated polypeptide chains. We noticed that sometimes the anti-SP antibody recognized a doublet of bands. However, this was not a consistent finding even within the same experiment, and was probably caused by post-lysis degradation of signal peptide-bearing PrP. It has been shown that cytoplasmic PrP that accumulates in the presence of proteasome inhibitors is detergent-insoluble and partially protease-resistant (13Yedidia Y. Horonchik L. Tzaban S. Yanai A. Taraboulos A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5383-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 14Ma J. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14955-14960Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Based on this and other pieces of evidence, it was claimed that retrotranslocated PrP is converted to a PrPSc-like isoform in the cytosol through a self-sustained process (27Ma J. Lindquist S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 28Ma J. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 289: 1785-1788Crossref Scopus (268) Google Scholar). To test whether this putative scrapie-like isoform represented untranslocated PrP, we subjected the cell lysates to ultracentrifugation at 186,000 × g, and analyzed the proteins in the supernatants and pellets by Western blot with the 3F4 and anti-SP antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1B (top panel), the majority of wild-type PrP expressed by untreated cells was recovered in the supernatant fraction (lane 1). After treatment with MG132, virtually all the unglycosylated 27-kDa species induced by the inhibitor was found in the insoluble fractions (lanes 4 and 6). This species was selectively labeled by the anti-SP antibody (lower panel, lanes 4 and 6), confirming that it corresponded to untranslocated PrP. The proteasome inhibitors induced also accumulation of a PrP band of higher molecular mass. This form corresponded to an immature PrP glycoform that had been translocated into the ER, but not transited beyond the mid-Golgi, based on its lack of reactivity with the anti-SP antibody, and its sensitivity to endo H digestion (not shown). Analysis of detergent insolubility revealed that this immature PrP glycoform was also partially aggregated (Fig. 1B, lanes 3–6). As previously found for D177N PrP expressed in CHO cells (22Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1633-1637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), this mutant protein was partially insoluble when expressed in N2a cells (Fig. 1B, top panel, lanes 7 and 8). MG132 induced strong accumulation of insoluble PrP species identical to those observed in N2a cells expressing wild-type PrP (lanes 9–12). In some cases, high molecular mass bands were also visible in the pellet fraction (Fig. 1B, top panel, lane 10), probably corresponding to SDS-resistant PrP aggregates, or untranslocated PrP that has been ubiquitinated prior to proteasomal degradation. Analogous results were observed when we analyzed the effect of proteasome inhibitors on N2a cells expressing PG14 PrP, with the difference that because of the nine-octapeptide insertion, the insoluble, signal-peptide bearing form of PrP that accumulated after treatment with the inhibitors had an apparent molecular mass of ∼33 kDa (not shown) (16Drisaldi B. Stewart R.S. Adles C. Stewart L.R. Quaglio E. Biasini E. Fioriti L. Chiesa R. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21732-21743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To test whether accumulation of untranslocated PrP was cytotoxic, we compared the viability in the presence of proteasome inhibitors of untransfected and transfected N2a expressing either wild-type or mutant PrPs. For these experiments, we used stably transfected cells overexpressing untagged (one clone) or 3F4-tagged (two independent clones) wild-type PrP, as well as two independent clones of each mutant, selected for having similar expression levels. Consistent with our previous findings (29Chiesa R. Harris D."
https://openalex.org/W1999955117,"The 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinases (RSK1–3) are important mediators of growth factor stimulation of cellular proliferation, survival, and differentiation and are activated via coordinated phosphorylation by ERK and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1). Here we performed the functional characterization of a predicted new human RSK homologue, RSK4. We showed that RSK4 is a predominantly cytosolic protein with very low expression and several characteristics of the RSK family kinases, including the presence of two functional kinase domains and a C-terminal docking site for ERK. Surprisingly, however, in all cell types analyzed, endogenous RSK4 was maximally (constitutively) activated under serum-starved conditions where other RSKs are inactive due to their requirement for growth factor stimulation. Constitutive activation appeared to result from constitutive phosphorylation of Ser232, Ser372, and Ser389, and the low basal ERK activity in serum-starved cells appeared to be sufficient for induction of ∼50% of the constitutive RSK4 activity. Finally experiments in mouse embryonic stem cells with targeted deletion of the PDK1 gene suggested that PDK1 was not required for phosphorylation of Ser232, a key regulatory site in the activation loop of the N-terminal kinase domain, that in other RSKs is phosphorylated by PDK1. The unusual regulation and growth factor-independent kinase activity indicate that RSK4 is functionally distinct from other RSKs and may help explain recent findings suggesting that RSK4 can participate in non-growth factor signaling as for instance p53-induced growth arrest.

Surprisingly, however, in all cell types analyzed, endogenous RSK4 was maximally (constitutively) activated under serum-starved conditions where other RSKs are inactive due to their requirement for growth factor stimulation. Constitutive activation appeared to result from constitutive phosphorylation of Ser232, Ser372, and Ser389, and the low basal ERK activity in serum-starved cells appeared to be sufficient for induction of ∼50% of the constitutive RSK4 activity. Finally experiments in mouse embryonic stem cells with targeted deletion of the PDK1 gene suggested that PDK1 was not required for phosphorylation of Ser232, a key regulatory site in the activation loop of the N-terminal kinase domain, that in other RSKs is phosphorylated by PDK1. The unusual regulation and growth factor-independent kinase activity indicate that RSK4 is functionally distinct from other RSKs and may help explain recent findings suggesting that RSK4 can participate in non-growth factor signaling as for instance p53-induced growth arrest.

RSKs contain two functional protein kinase domains, and in mammals three widely expressed homologues (RSK1, RSK2, and RSK3) have been identified. Many studies suggest that RSKs are central mediators of ERK in regulation of cellular division, survival, and differentiation via phosphorylation of numerous intracellular proteins. For instance, RSK mediates ERK-induced G2/M phase progression in meiosis I (4.Gross S.D. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. J. Biol.

RSK is related to the mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinases (MSK1 and MSK2), which also contain two kinase domains. MSK, however, is activated by the ERK family as well as by p38 family MAP kinases and thereby functions in signal transduction of growth factors as well as of cellular stress stimuli like UV/radioactive irradiation and proinflammatory cytokines (22.Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 23.Pierrat B. da Silva Correia J. Mary J.-L. Tomas-Zuber M. Lesslauer W. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1212-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) whose activity is regulated by the C-terminal kinase domain and a linker region between the two kinase domains (Fig. 1). The activation mechanism of RSK is complex and involves sequential phosphorylation of four regulatory sites (28.Dalby K.N. Morrice N. Caudwell F.B. Avruch J. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1496-1505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), which are Ser232, Ser372, Ser389, and Thr581, using RSK4 numbering.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2893-2898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), phosphorylates Ser372 in the linker and Thr581 in the activation loop of C-terminal kinase (28.Dalby K.N.

Biochem. 1993; 212: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Thr581 activates C-terminal kinase, which thereafter autophosphorylates RSK at Ser389, located in a so-called hydrophobic motif in the linker (32.Vik T.A. Ryder J.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser389 in the hydrophobic motif generates a transient docking site that recruits as well as stimulates the activity of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) (25.Frodin M. Jensen C.J. Merienne K. Gammeltoft S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2924-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), which then phosphorylates Ser232 in the activation loop of the NTK of RSK (33.Jensen C.J. Buch M.-B. Krag T.O.

Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 810-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). After dissociation of PDK1 from RSK, the Ser386-phosphorylated hydrophobic motif interacts with a binding pocket within the NTK domain and thereby activates the NTK in synergy with phospho-Ser232 (35.Frodin M. Antal T.L. Dummler B.A. Jensen C.J. Deak M. Gammeltoft S. Biondi R.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5396-5407Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Ser372 enhances the activity of the NTK by a yet unknown mechanism (28.Dalby K.N. Morrice N. Caudwell F.B. Avruch J. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1496-1505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 33.Jensen C.J. Buch M.-B. Krag T.O. Hemmings B.A. Gammeltoft S. Frodin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27168-27176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Apart from these four activating sites, Thr368 is phosphorylated by ERK, but the site has not been found to regulate kinase activity (28.Dalby K.N. Morrice N. Caudwell F.B. Avruch J. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1496-1505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Moreover Ser742 appears to be phosphorylated by the activated NTK (28.Dalby K.N. Morrice N. Caudwell F.B. Avruch J. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1496-1505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 36.Roux P.P. Richards S.A. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4796-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), which results in decreased affinity of RSK for ERK, serving as an intramolecular feedback inhibitory mechanism that operates in RSK1 and RSK2 but not in RSK3 (36.Roux P.P. Richards S.A. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4796-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The activation mechanism of MSK is thought to be very similar to that of RSK except for two features (22.Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 23.Pierrat B. da Silva Correia J. Mary J.-L. Tomas-Zuber M. Lesslauer W. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 5892-5899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). First, the MAP kinase docking site can interact with both ERK and p38 MAP kinase, explaining why MSK is activated by two MAP kinase pathways. Second, the activation loop of the NTK is not phosphorylated by PDK1 but probably via autophosphorylation. Recently a search for the mental retardation gene in a complex disease locus at Xq21 resulted in the discovery of a gene encoding a new RSK/MSK homologue (40.Yntema H.G. van den Helm B. Kissing J. van Duijnhoven G. Poppelaars F. Chelly J. Moraine C. Fryns J.P. Hamel B.C. Heilbronner H. Pander H.J. Brunner H.G. Ropers H.H. Cremers F.P. van Bokhoven H. Genomics. 1999; 62: 332-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), which contains all the structural hallmarks of this kinase family (Fig. 1). Due to highest amino acid sequence identity to RSKs, the kinase was named RSK4 (gene symbol RPS6KA6), but no functional studies were performed to confirm the relationship. Although RSK4 was found to be deleted in several patients with alterations in Xq21, a definitive link to mental retardation could not be established. At present, the only characterization performed with RSK4 is the demonstration of RSK4 mRNA expression in various human (40.Yntema H.G. van den Helm B. Kissing J. van Duijnhoven G. Poppelaars F. Chelly J. Moraine C. Fryns J.P. Hamel B.C. Heilbronner H. Pander H.J. Brunner H.G. Ropers H.H. Cremers F.P. van Bokhoven H. Genomics. 1999; 62: 332-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and fetal mouse (41.Kohn M. Hameister H. Vogel M. Kehrer-Sawatzki H. Gene Expr. Patterns. 2003; 3: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) tissues. Very recently, a short interfering RNA screen targeting 7,914 human genes identified five genes, including RSK4, whose transcripts were required for growth arrest induced by the p53 tumor suppressor protein (42.Berns K. Hijmans E.M. Mullenders J. Brummelkamp T.R. Velds A. Heimerikx M. Kerkhoven R.M. Madiredjo M. Nijkamp W. Weigelt B. Agami R. Ge W. Cavet G. Linsley P.S. Beijersbergen R.L. Bernards R. Nature. 2004; 428: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that RSK4 has a function in growth inhibition and opens the possibility that RSK4 is a tumor suppressor protein. Moreover an expression screen with mouse mRNAs in X. laevis embryos showed that RSK4 expression can disrupt mesoderm formation induced by the fibroblast growth factor-Ras-ERK signaling pathway (43.Myers A.P. Corson L.B. Rossant J. Baker J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4255-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). RSK4 was therefore proposed to be an inhibitor rather than a mediator of growth factor signal transduction. However, the two recent studies provided no characterization of the RSK4 protein, its kinase activity, or regulation. Since RSK1–3 are activated by growth factors it is currently enigmatic how RSK4 can be an inhibitor of growth factor signal transduction and a mediator of p53, which is a transcription factor. In this study, we characterized RSK4 and demonstrated that RSK4 is distinct from other RSKs by being constitutively activated in serum-starved cells in the absence of growth factor. Our data suggested that constitutive activity was due to constitutive phosphorylation of Ser232, Ser372, and Ser389 induced in part by very low basal levels of ERK activity and in part by less well defined mechanisms that may include enhanced autophosphorylation ability of RSK4 compared with other RSKs. The constitutive, growth factor-independent activity of RSK4 may help explain how RSK4 can participate in non-growth factor signaling, such as p53-induced growth arrest. Antibodies to RSK4 (sc-17178) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA).

For GST fusion protein pull-down assays, glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) was used. Agarose bead-antibody complexes were precipitated by centrifugation, washed five times with lysis buffer, drained, and dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 62 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue). For kinase assays, the final two washes were with 1.5× kinase assay buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Kinase Assays—Agarose beads with immunoprecipitated kinase were drained with a syringe and resuspended in 20 μl of 1.5× kinase assay buffer. The kinase reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μl (final concentrations) of ATP (100 μm, 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) and 800 μm S6 peptide (RSK assays) or 166 μm cross-tide (MSK assays). After 10 min at 30 °C (the reaction was linear with time), 20 μl of the supernatant was removed with a Hamilton syringe (leaving behind precipitated kinase) and spotted onto phosphocellulose paper (Whatman p81) that was washed four to five times with 150 mm orthophosphoric acid. [32P]phosphate incorporated into protein substrate was quantified on a STORM™ PhosphorImager using ImageQuant™ software (Amersham Biosciences). Due to the low activity, a reaction blank (an assay performed without antibody during immunoprecipitation) was performed for all the conditions in endogenous RSK4 and MSK1 assays and subtracted from the respective kinase assay values. In Vitro Activation of RSK—Endogenous RSK4 or RSK2, immunopurified from ∼3 × 106 serum-starved embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells per assay point, were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 50 μm MgATP in the absence or presence of 50 ng of active ERK2 (Upstate Biotechnology) and 50 ng of active PDK1 (35.Frodin M. Antal T.L. Dummler B.A. Jensen C.J. Deak M. Gammeltoft S. Biondi R.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5396-5407Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) in 20 μl of 1.5× kinase assay buffer. Thereafter the kinase activity of RSK4 and RSK2 was determined as described under “Kinase Assays” except that in the present assay the blank reaction contained ERK2 and PDK1. Immunocytochemistry—Subconfluent cells cultured on gelatin-coated glass coverslips were transfected with pMT2-HA-RSK4. One day after transfection, cells were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 15 min followed by permeabilization with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 5 min and blocking in 10% horse serum for 20 min. Cells were then incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with rabbit anti-HA antibody diluted 1:500 in PBS. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated for 45 min at 37 °C with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (F0511, Sigma) diluted 1:300 in PBS. Coverslips were then washed with PBS, mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA), and analyzed in a laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica). Cell Fractionation—HEK293F cells were harvested in cold PBS, pelleted, and resuspended in hypotonic RSB buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 6.2), 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, inhibitors as for lysis buffer above). The cell suspension was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C and then homogenized by 20 strokes in a tight fitting homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 375 × g (2 min), and the pellet was washed twice with RSB buffer and then resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 250 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, inhibitors as for lysis buffer above) to generate the nuclear fraction. The supernatant was centrifuged for 60 min at 150,000 × g. The resulting pellet was washed once in RSB buffer and then resuspended in lysis buffer to generate the membrane fraction, whereas the supernatant of this centrifugation represented the cytosolic fraction. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Immunoblotting—Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (33.Jensen C.J. Buch"
https://openalex.org/W2169759160,"Candida albicans is the most common cause of fungal bloodstream infections. To invade the deep tissues, blood-borne organisms must cross the endothelial cell lining of the vasculature. We have found previously that C. albicans hyphae, but not blastospores, invade endothelial cells in vitro by inducing their own endocytosis. Therefore, we set out to identify the endothelial cell receptor that mediates the endocytosis of C. albicans. We determined that endocytosis of C. albicans was not mediated by bridging molecules in the serum and that it was partially dependent on the presence of extracellular calcium. Using an affinity purification procedure, we discovered that endothelial cell N-cadherin bound to C. albicans hyphae but not blastospores. N-cadherin also co-localized with C. albicans hyphae that were being endocytosed by endothelial cells. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing human N-cadherin endocytosed significantly more C. albicans hyphae than did CHO cells expressing either human VE-cadherin or no human cadherins. The expression of N-cadherin by the CHO cells resulted in enhanced endocytosis of hyphae, but not blastospores, indicating the selectivity of the N-cadherin-mediated endocytosis. Down-regulation of endothelial cell N-cadherin expression with small interfering RNA significantly inhibited the endocytosis of C. albicans hyphae. Therefore, a novel function of N-cadherin is that it serves as an endothelial cell receptor, which mediates the endocytosis of C. albicans.

Hematogenously disseminated candidiasis is a serious fungal infection that occurs in hospitalized patients. Candida albicans causes ∼60% of all cases of these infections, whereas the remainder are due to other species of Candida (1Rangel-Frausto M.S. Wiblin T. Blumberg H.M. Saiman L. Patterson J.

In susceptible hosts, the organisms enter the bloodstream either via an indwelling vascular catheter or by translocation across the gastrointestinal mucosa. Once inside the bloodstream, the organisms disseminate to virtually all of the organs in the body. To escape from the intravascular compartment and invade the deep tissues, the organisms must cross the endothelial cell lining of the blood vessels. Thus, the endothelial cell is one of the first host cells that C. albicans encounters as it establishes a hematogenously disseminated infection. We have been investigating the interactions of C. albicans with endothelial cells in vitro with the long-range goal of developing methods to prevent blood-borne organisms from traversing the vascular endothelium and invading the deep tissues. C. albicans must first adhere to endothelial cells to cross the endothelial cell lining of the vasculature. Several different C. albicans adhesins that mediate the binding of this organism to endothelial cells in vitro have been identified. They include Als1p, Als3p, Als5p, hydrophobic cell wall proteins, and a α5β3 integrin-like receptor (3Fu Y. Ibrahim A.S. Sheppard D.C. Chen Y.C. French S.W. Cutler J.E. Filler S.G. Edwards J.E. Mol.

The α5β3 integrin-like receptor probably binds to vitronectin or other Arg-Gly-Asp-containing proteins on the endothelial cell surface (6Santoni G. Spreghini E. Lucciarini R. Amantini C. Piccoli M. Microb. Pathog. 2001; 31: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, the endothelial cell targets for the other candidal adhesins are unknown. C. albicans adherence to endothelial cells is followed by invasion of the organism into these cells. We have found that endothelial cell adherence and invasion are distinct processes. For example, although C. albicans blastospores adhere avidly to endothelial cells, they invade these cells poorly (8Phan Q.T. Belanger P.H. Filler S.G. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3485-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In contrast, C. albicans hyphae both adhere to and invade endothelial cells. C. albicans hyphae invade endothelial cells in vitro by inducing their own endocytosis (9Filler S.G. Swerdloff J.N. Hobbs C. Luckett P.M. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 976-983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Rotrosen D. Edwards Jr., J.E. Gibson T.R. Moore J.C. Cohen A.H. Green I. J. Infect. Dis. 1985; 152: 1264-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The endocytosis of C. albicans hyphae by endothelial cells is independent of fungal viability and requires functional endothelial cell microfilaments and microtubules (8Phan Q.T. Belanger P.H. Filler S.G. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3485-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 9Filler S.G. Swerdloff J.N. Hobbs C. Luckett P.M. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 976-983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the endocytic process is governed in part by the tyrosine phosphorylation of endothelial cell proteins (11Belanger P.H. Johnston D. Fratti R.A. Zhang M. Filler S.G. Cell. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Importantly, the endothelial cell receptor(s) that are bound by C. albicans and that mediate the endocytosis of the organism have not been identified previously. In the current study, we discovered that N-cadherin is an endothelial cell receptor for C. albicans hyphae. Fungal Strains and Culture—C. albicans strains SC5314 and its ura3Δ/ura3Δ derivative, CAI-4 (12Fonzi W.A. Irwin M.Y. Genetics. 1993; 134: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were generous gifts from William Fonzi (Georgetown School of Medicine, Washington, D. C.), strain 36082 was from the American Type Culture Collection), and strain, 15153 was obtained from the clinical laboratory at the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. All of these strains are clinical isolates and have been shown previously to be endocytosed by and cause injury to vascular endothelial cells in vitro (9Filler S.G. Swerdloff J.N. Hobbs C. Luckett P.M. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 976-983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Belanger P.H. Johnston D. Fratti R.A. Zhang M. Filler S.G. Cell.

Immun. 1995; 63: 1993-1998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The tpk2Δ/tpk2Δ mutant and a TPK2-reconstituted strain (tpk2Δ/tpk2Δ::TPK2), which were constructed from strain CAI-4 (14Sonneborn A. Bockmuhl D.P. Gerads M. Kurpanek K. Sanglard D. Ernst J.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 386-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), were kindly provided by Joachim Ernst (Heinrich-Heine-Universität, Düsseldorf, Germany). URA3 was restored to its native locus in CAI-4 and the tpk2Δ/tpk2Δ and tpk2Δ/tpk2Δ::TPK2 strains as described previously (15Park H. Myers C.L. Sheppard D.C. Phan Q.T. Sanchez A.A. Edwards Jr., J.E. Filler S.G. Cell. Microbiol. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). For all of the experiments, the organisms were grown overnight at room temperature on a rotating drum in yeast nitrogen base broth (Difco) supplemented with 2% glucose (w/v) (9Filler S.G. Swerdloff J.N. Hobbs C. Luckett P.M. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 976-983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting blastospores were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 1The abbreviations used are: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ and Mg2+; PBS++, PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HBSS, Hank's balanced salt solution; siRNA, small interfering RNA. without Ca2+ and Mg2+, and enumerated with a hemacytometer. To obtain hyphal-phase organisms, C. albicans blastospores were suspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Irvine Scientific) at a final concentration of 3 × 106 cells/ml and incubated on a rotary shaker at 37 °C for 120 min. Because the hyphae of the tpk2Δ/tpk2Δ mutant elongated slightly more slowly than the hyphae of the other strains, this mutant was incubated in RPMI 1640 medium for 150 min. After this incubation, the hyphae of the tpk2Δ/tpk2Δ strain were similar in length to those of the other strains. In some experiments, the hyphae were coated with serum proteins by incubating them for 30 min at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% pooled human serum (Gemini Bioproducts). To control for the stimulatory effects of the serum on hyphal growth, the hyphae were first killed by exposure to 100% methanol for 2 min (8Phan Q.T. Belanger P.H. Filler S.G. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3485-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and then rinsed extensively in PBS before being incubated in serum. Control hyphae were killed and then incubated in RPMI 1640 medium without serum in parallel. The organisms were then rinsed in PBS and counted for use in the experiments. We have found previously that methanol-killed hyphae are endocytosed by endothelial cells similarly to live hyphae (8Phan Q.T. Belanger P.H. Filler S.G. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3485-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Endothelial Cells and Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) Cells—Endothelial cells were isolated from the veins of human umbilical cords following the method of Jaffe et al. (16Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (6019) Google Scholar). They were maintained in M-199 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini BioProducts, Inc.), 10% defined bovine calf serum (Gemini Bio-Products, Inc.), and 2 mm l-glutamine with penicillin and streptomycin (Irvine Scientific) as described previously (9Filler S.G. Swerdloff J.N. Hobbs C. Luckett P.M. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 976-983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CHO K-1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in Ham's F-12K medium (American Type Culture Collection) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Both cell types were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Measurement of Endocytosis of C. albicans by Endothelial Cells and CHO Cells—The number of organisms endocytosed by endothelial cells or CHO cells was determined using a minor modification of our previously described differential fluorescence assay (7Sheppard D.C.

Endothelial cells or CHO cells were grown to confluency on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips in a 24-well tissue culture plate (BD Biosciences). The cells were rinsed once with warm Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS, Irvine Scientific) and infected with 105 cells of C. albicans in RPMI 1640 medium for 45 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Next, the cells were rinsed twice with 0.5 ml of HBSS in a standardized manner and then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde. The adherent but non-endocytosed organisms were labeled with polyclonal rabbit anti-C. albicans antibodies (Biodesign International) that had been conjugated with green fluorescing Alexa 568 (Molecular Probes). The endothelial cells or CHO cells then were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS, after which both the endocytosed and non-endocytosed organisms were labeled with polyclonal anti-C. albicans antibodies conjugated with red fluorescing Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes). The coverslips were viewed by epifluorescence, and at least 100 organisms/slide were examined. The number of cell-associated organisms (endocytosed plus adherent organisms) was determined by counting the number of organisms that were labeled with green fluorescencing Alexa 488. The number of endocytosed organisms was determined by subtracting the number of organisms labeled with red fluorescencing Alexa 568 from the number of cell-associated organisms. The results were expressed as the number of endocytosed or cell-associated organisms per high-powered field. An organism was considered to be endocytosed if any portion of it was internalized. All of the experiments were performed in triplicate at least three times. Preparation of Endothelial Cell Membrane Proteins—Endothelial cell membrane proteins were prepared using the method of Isberg and Leong (19Isberg R.R. Leong J.M. Cell. 1990; 60: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Confluent endothelial cells in 100-mm diameter tissue culture dishes were rinsed twice with warm PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ (PBS++) and then incubated with Ez-Link Sulfo-NHS-LS Biotin (0.5 mg/ml, Pierce) in PBS++ for 12 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The cells then were rinsed extensively with cold PBS++ and scraped from the tissue culture dishes. The endothelial cells were collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and then lysed by incubation for 20 min on ice in PBS++ containing 5.8% octyl-glucopyranoside (w/v) (Sigma) with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). The cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for1hat 4 °C. The concentration of the endothelial cell proteins in the resulting supernatant was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Isolation of Endothelial Cell Surface Proteins that Bind to C. albicans—An affinity purification method using intact C. albicans cells was employed to isolate endothelial cell proteins that bind to C. albicans. Live C. albicans blastospores (8 × 108 cells) or an equivalent volume of hyphae (2 × 108 cells) were incubated for 1 h on ice with 50–250 μg of biotin-labeled endothelial cell surface proteins in buffer A (PBS++ containing 1.5% octyl-glucopyranoside and protease inhibitors). The unbound endothelial cell proteins were removed by three rinses with buffer A. The endothelial cell proteins that remained bound to the organisms were eluted with 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, in buffer A without Ca2+ and Mg2+. The proteins were separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred to Immobilon-P nylon membranes (Millipore). After blocking the membranes overnight in Tris-buffered saline containing 10% casein, the membranes were immunoblotted with an anti-biotin monoclonal antibody (clone BN-32, Sigma), a polyclonal rabbit pan-cadherin antibody (Sigma), an anti-N-cadherin monoclonal antibody (clone 32, Transduction Laboratories), or an anti-VE-cadherin monoclonal antibody (clone 75, Transduction Laboratories). The membranes then were incubated with an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and the bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). To determine the identity of an endothelial cell protein that bound to C. albicans hyphae, 3.25 mg of endothelial cell membrane proteins were incubated with 9 × 109 hyphae and then eluted with EDTA as described above. The eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, after which the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue and the band containing the 130-kDa protein was excised and microsequenced using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (Emory University Microchemical Facility, Atlanta, GA). Cadherin Localization by Indirect Immunofluorescence—Endothelial cells were grown to confluency on 12-mm diameter glass coverslips and then infected with 2 × 105 hyphae of C. albicans SC5314 in RPMI 1640 medium. After a 45-min incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the cells were washed once with HBSS to remove unbound organisms and then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde. The cells were washed with PBS++ containing 1% bovine serum albumin and then blocked and permeabilized for 30 min in 5% goat serum containing 1% Triton X-100. The cells were incubated with either an anti-N-cadherin monoclonal antibody (clone 32) or the anti-VE-cadherin monoclonal antibody, rinsed, and then incubated with a goat anti-mouse antiserum conjugated with Alexa 488 (Molecular Probe). To detect F-actin, the cells were incubated with Alexa 568 phalloidin (Molecular Probes) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were also incubated with the anti-C. albicans antiserum that had been conjugated with Alexa 633 (Molecular Probes) to visualize the organisms. After being rinsed in PBS, the coverslips were mounted using antifade medium and viewed by confocal microscopy. The final confocal images were produced by combining optical sections taken through the z axis. Plasmid Construction—RNA was extracted from endothelial cells using RNAwiz (Ambion, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions and then reverse-transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Ambion, Inc.). The resulting cDNA was used as a template to amplify N-cadherin and VE-cadherin by PCR. The primers for N-cadherin were 5′-TCCATGTGCCGGATAGCG-3′ and 5′-AGTTCAGTCATCACCTCCACCATACA-3′, and the primers for VE-cadherin were 5′-CTGTTCCTCCTGGAAGAT-3′ and 5′-CCTCGGCCGCCTAATA-3′. The amplified cDNAs were cloned into pGEMTeasy (Promega) and sequence-verified. They were excised next with NotI and cloned into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen). Transfection and Sorting of CHO Cells—CHO cells at 60–80% confluency in 25-cm2 flasks were transfected with 0.5–1.0 μg of DNA using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's protocol. 48 h after transfection, stably transfected cells were selected by adding G418 (A. G. Scientific, Inc.) to the medium to final concentration 600 μg/ml. CHO cells with high surface expression of N-cadherin and VE-cadherin were selected using fluorescent-activated cell sorting (20Robinson E.E. Zazzali K.M. Corbett S.A. Foty R.A. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). CHO cells transfected with pcDNA3.1, N-cadherin, or VE-cadherin were grown to confluency in 75-cm2 flasks and then detached with 0.1% trypsin in 0.5 mm CaCl2. The cells were rinsed twice with HBSS and blocked on ice with 1% goat serum in HBSS. N-cadherin and VE-cadherin were detected using monoclonal antibodies directed against the extracellular domains of N-cadherin (clone GC34, Sigma) and VE-cadherin, respectively. The cells were labeled next with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Sigma), rinsed, and then sorted using a FACSCaliber flow cytometer equipped with a cell sorter (BD Biosciences). The sorted cells were grown to confluency, and the percentage of cell expressing N-cadherin or VE-cadherin was determined by flow cytometry. The sorting procedure was repeated 3–4 times until at least 75% transfectants expressed either N-cadherin or VE-cadherin. Down-regulation of Endothelial Cell N-cadherin Expression by Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—Endothelial cells were grown to 60% confluency in six-well tissue culture plates in tissue culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 10% bovine calf serum without antibiotics. These cells were transfected with 2 μg of either N-cadherin siRNA duplex oligonucleotides (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or random fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled siRNA duplex control oligonucleotides (Qiagen) using Lipofectamine 2000 in 500 μl of serum-free medium according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h, the cells were detached with trypsin-EDTA (Irvine Scientific) and seeded onto fibronectin-coated glass coverslips in a 24-well tissue culture plate. The next day, the endocytosis of C. albicans hyphae by the transfected endothelial cells was measured as described above. To verify that N-cadherin siRNA down-regulated endothelial cell N-cadherin expression, the transfected endothelial cells from one of the glass coverslips were lysed in 30 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer. The cellular proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, after which N-cadherin was detected by immunoblotting as outlined previously. Each immunoblot was then stripped and probed with a rabbit polyclonal anti-β-actin antiserum (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) to confirm equality of protein loading. Statistical Analysis—Differences were evaluated using analysis of variance, and p values ≤ 0.05 were considered significant. Endocytosis of C. albicans Requires Extracellular Calcium— Many host cell receptors that mediate the uptake of microorganisms by normally non-phagocytic host cells require calcium for their function (19Isberg R.R. Leong J.M. Cell. 1990; 60: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 21Mengaud J. Ohayon H. Gounon P. Mege R.M. Cossart P.

Krause K.H. Cell. Microbiol. 1999; 1: 101-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used the calcium chelator, EGTA, to investigate the role of extracellular calcium in the endocytosis of C. albicans by endothelial cells (Fig. 1). Adding EGTA alone to the medium reduced the endocytosis of C. albicans hyphae by 60% compared with control endothelial cells that were not exposed to this chelator. EGTA had no effect on the number of cell-associated organisms, indicating that the reduction in endocytosis was not due to inhibition of C. albicans adherence. The addition of calcium plus EGTA to the endothelial cells restored their capacity to endocytose hyphae to control levels and actually caused a slight but statistically significant increase in the number of cell-associated organisms. Magnesium did not reverse the inhibitory effect of EGTA on endocytosis, demonstrating that this effect was specifically due to the chelation of calcium. These results suggest that the interaction of C. albicans hyphae with its endothelial cell receptor is calcium-dependent. Endocytosis of C. albicans by Endothelial Cells Does Not Require Serum Proteins—When C. albicans interacts with endothelial cells in vivo, the organisms are almost certainly coated with serum proteins. It is known that some microorganisms such as Staphylococcus aureus utilize serum components as bridging molecules to induce their own uptake by endothelial cells (22Sinha B. Francois P.P. Nusse O. Foti M. Hartford O.M. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Lew D.P. Herrmann M. Krause K.H. Cell. Microbiol. 1999; 1: 101-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). To test whether serum proteins influence the endocytosis of C. albicans, we incubated C. albicans hyphae in the presence and absence of serum and then measured the uptake of the organisms by endothelial cells. Serum is a potent stimulator of C. albicans hyphal formation and elongation (23Feng Q. Summers E. Guo B. Fink G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6339-6346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we killed the hyphae prior to incubating them in serum to control for the effects of serum on the organism. In the absence of serum, the number of killed organisms, which were endocytosed by and cell-associated with endothelial cells, was similar to that of live organisms (Fig. 2A), a finding we have reported previously (8Phan Q.T. Belanger P.H. Filler S.G. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3485-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Incubation of killed hyphae in serum prior to adding them to the endothelial cells resulted in a 40% decrease in the number of endocytosed organisms, although it had no effect on the number of cell-associated organisms. These data indicate that serum proteins actually inhibit endocytosis rather than facilitate this process. Thus, they are unlikely to act as bridging molecules between the organism and the endothelial cell. Detection of Endothelial Cell Surface Proteins that Bind to C. albicans Blastospores and Hyphae—Based on these above results, we hypothesized that the endocytosis of C. albicans is mediated by the direct interaction of an endothelial cell receptor with a ligand expressed on the surface of hyphae and that this interaction is calcium-dependent. Therefore, we used the affinity purification procedure developed by Isberg and Leong (19Isberg R.R. Leong J.M. Cell. 1990; 60: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar) to identify endothelial cell proteins that bound C. albicans hyphae in a calcium-dependent manner. We found that C. albicans blastospores bound only to an endothelial cell protein with a molecular mass of ∼105 kDa (Fig. 2B). In contrast, C. albicans hyphae bound to a 135-kDa protein as well as the 105-kDa protein. Of note, the killed hyphae bound to the same endothelial cell proteins as did live hyphae (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, preincubating killed organisms in serum did not affect the binding of endothelial cell proteins to these cells. These results support our previous finding that serum proteins do not act as bridging molecules between the organism and the endothelial cell. Endothelial Cell N-cadherin Binds to C. albicans—We scaled up the affinity purification procedure to obtain sufficient protein for sequencing. We found several potential matches with members of the cadherin family. Therefore, to verify that an endothelial cell cadherin bound to C. albicans hyphae, we probed blots containing endothelial cell proteins that bound to C. albicans with a pan-cadherin antiserum directed against the conserved C-terminal region of the classical cadherins. This antiserum recognized the 135-kDa endothelial cell protein that was bound specifically by hyphae (Fig. 3). N-cadherin and VE-cadherin are the only cadherins with molecular masses in the range of 135 kDa that are known to be expressed by endothelial cells (24Heimark R.L. Degner M. Schwartz S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1745-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 25Salomon D. Ayalon O. Patel-King R. Hynes R.O. Geiger B. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 7-17PubMed Google Scholar, 26Navarro P. Ruco L. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1475-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether monoclonal antibodies directed against either of these cadherins recognized an endothelial cell protein that was bound by C. albicans hyphae. A monoclonal antibody directed against N-cadherin recognized the 135-kDa endothelial cell protein bound by hyphae. (Fig. 3). However, an anti-VE-cadherin monoclonal antibody did not recognize any endothelial cell protein that bound to C. albicans, although this antibody did recognize VE-cadherin in the total membrane protein preparation (data not shown). We next used indirect immunofluorescence to verify that N-cadherin on intact endothelial cells bound to C. albicans hyphae that were being endocytosed. Parallel sets of endothelial cells were stained for VE-cadherin for comparison. As reported by others (25Salomon D. Ayalon O. Patel-King R. Hynes R.O. Geiger B. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 7-17PubMed Google Scholar, 26Navarro P. Ruco L. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1475-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), N-cadherin was expressed diffusely over the entire surface of uninfected endothelial cells (Fig."

To define the polyamine transport pathways in eukaryotic cells we have cloned a gene, LmPOT1, that encodes a polyamine transporter from the protozoan pathogen, Leishmania major. Sequence analysis of LmPOT1 predicted an unusual 803-residue polytopic protein with 9-12 transmembrane domains. Expression of LmPOT1 cRNA in Xenopus laevis oocytes revealed LmPOT1 to be a high affinity transporter for both putrescine and spermidine, whereas expression of LmPOT1 in Trypanosoma brucei stimulated putrescine uptake that was sensitive to inhibition by pentamidine and proton ionophores. Immunoblot analysis established that LmPOT1 was expressed predominantly in the insect vector form of L. major, and immunofluorescence demonstrated that LmPOT1 was localized predominantly to the parasite plasma membrane. To our knowledge this is the first molecular identification and characterization of a cell surface polyamine transporter in eukaryotic cells.

Polyamines are ubiquitous aliphatic polycations that play vital roles in key cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and macromolecular biosynthesis (1Thomas T. Thomas T.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 244-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). The polyamine content of cells originates from both de novo synthesis (2Hayashi S. Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 27-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) as well transport of exogenous polyamines (3Kashiwagi K. Shibuya S. Tomitori H. Kuraishi A. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6318-6323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Extensive molecular, biochemical, and structural studies have been performed on the polyamine biosynthetic pathway in a multitude of organisms ranging from simple prokaryotes to human (4Wallace H.M. Fraser A.V. Hughes A. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). In contrast, there is essentially no information at the molecular level on the mechanisms by which polyamines are translocated across the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells. Three polyamine permease genes have been identified in Escherichia coli, two of which encode members of the ATP binding cassette superfamily, whereas the third, PotE, codes for a protein in the amino acid/polyamine/organocation (APC) 1The abbreviations used are: APC, amino acid/polyamine/organocation; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ORF, open reading frame; TM, transmembrane domain. superfamily (3Kashiwagi K.

J. 1999; 344: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). However, the only eukaryotic polyamine transporters that have been identified to date at the molecular level are those from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and these are intracellular transporters that localize to the yeast vacuole (7Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Asakawa T. Kakinuma Y. Michael A.J. Igarashi K. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 8Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Sakata K. Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3265-3267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These yeast vacuolar transporters are members of the major facilitator superfamily and share very limited homology with their prokaryotic counterparts. Because polyamine uptake is enhanced in tumor cells, and extracellular polyamines can bypass the cellular effects of polyamine anti-metabolites (9Seiler N. Curr. Drug Targets. 2003; 4: 565-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), the therapeutically germane nature of cell surface polyamine transporters has stimulated considerable interest in their identification and characterization. The polyamine pathway has been successfully targeted with drugs in protozoan parasites. d,l-α-Difluoromethylornithine, an irreversible inactivator of ornithine decarboxylase, the first enzyme in the polyamine biosynthesis pathway, can eliminate Trypanosoma brucei infections in both mice (10McCann P.P. Bacchi C.J. Clarkson Jr., A.B. Seed J.R. Nathan H.C. Amole B.O. Hutner S.H. Sjoerdsma A. Med. Biol. 1981; 59: 434-440PubMed Google Scholar) and humans with late stage African sleeping sickness (11Van Voorhis W.C. Drugs. 1990; 40: 176-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Another compound, 5′-{[(Z)-4-amino-2-butenyl]methylamino}-5-deoxyadenosine (MDL73811), a potent inhibitor of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, is effective in eradicating T. brucei infections in mice (12Bacchi C.J.

Polyamine anti-metabolites such as d,l-α-difluoromethylornithine are also active against a variety of other parasite genera, including Plasmodium, Giardia, and Leishmania (13Gillin F.D. Reiner D.S. McCann P.P. J. Protozool. 1984; 31: 161-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 14Bitonti A.J. McCann P.P. Sjoerdsma A. Exp.

Protozool. 1986; 33: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Leishmania, the etiologic agent of a spectrum of devastating and often lethal diseases, is a genus of protozoan parasite that is phylogenetically similar to T. brucei. The parasite is digenetic, existing as the extracellular promastigote in the phlebotomine sandfly vector and as the amastigote sequestered within the phagolysosome of macrophages of the infected mammalian host. Leishmania have been particularly valuable in investigations characterizing the polyamine biosynthesis pathway of parasites. All of the genes of the polyamine pathway, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (ADOMETDC), and spermidine synthase (SPDSYN), have been cloned from Leishmania donovani, and the creation of Δodc, Δadometdc, and Δspdsyn knock-out lines by targeted gene replacement has demonstrated the essential role of each of these genes in L. donovani proliferation and illuminated significant dissimilarities between the polyamine pathways of Leishmania and the mammalian host (16Roberts S.C.

Despite the plethora of molecular and biochemical studies on the polyamine pathway in L. donovani and other parasites (16Roberts S.C. Jiang Y. Jardim A. Carter N.S. Heby O. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem.

Leishmania promastigotes and amastigotes are both capable of scavenging exogenous polyamines (19Kandpal M. Tekwani B.L. Life Sci. 1997; 60: 1793-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Basselin M. Coombs G.H. Barrett M.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 109: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and biochemical studies in intact parasites have distinguished two transporters, one specific for putrescine and one for spermidine (20Basselin M. Coombs G.H. Barrett M.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 109: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that pentamidine, a diamidine drug used in the treatment of leishmaniasis, might enter the parasite via a polyamine transporter (21Basselin M. Lawrence F. Robert-Gero M. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 631-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus far, investigations into the pathways by which parasites, and for that matter any eukaryote, transport polyamines from the extracellular environment, have defied molecular analysis. We now report the molecular identification and characterization of LmPOT1, a polyamine transporter from Leishmania major. LmPOT1 is a member of the APC superfamily and recognizes both putrescine and spermidine with relatively high affinity. LmPOT1 does not appear to transport amino acids and is inhibited by proton uncouplers, suggesting that the permease may be a proton symporter, and by pentamidine, an antileishmanial drug. Moreover, LmPOT1 localizes predominantly to the leishmanial plasma membrane. To our knowledge, LmPOT1 is the first cell surface polyamine transporter to be recognized in eukaryotic cells. Chemicals and Reagents—[2,3-3H(N)]putrescine (31 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA), [1,4-14C]Putrescine (110 mCi/mmol), [14C]spermidine (23.8 mCi/mmol), and [14C]spermine (113 mCi/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, [2,3,4,5-3H]agmatine (60 Ci/mmol) and [14C]arginine (55 mCi/mmol) were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). [3H]Pentamidine isothionate (98 Ci/mmol) was a gift from Dr. Michael Barrett (Glasgow University). Oligonucleotides were acquired from Invitrogen, and restriction endonucleases were from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). The Xenopus laevis oocyte pOG-1 (21Basselin M. Lawrence F. Robert-Gero M. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 631-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and T. brucei pHD309 (22Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7057-7070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar) expression vectors were furnished by Drs. Susan Amara and George Cross, respectively. X. laevis were obtained from Xenopus Express (Plant City, FL), and rabbit antibodies against LmPOT1 using a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 71-89 of LmPOT1 as immunogen were raised at Bio-synthesis Inc. (Lewisville, TX). All other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. Parasite Cell Culture—L. major (Friedlin VI) promastigotes were grown at 26 °C in M199 medium supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Amastigotes were obtained by infection of J774.1 macrophages that were acquired from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Macrophages were cultured at 37 °C in RPMI1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and infected with stationary phase L. major promastigotes at a ratio of 20 parasites per macrophage. After overnight infection, macrophages were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2 mm EDTA to remove residual promastigotes, and fresh growth medium was added for an additional 48 h. The macrophage monolayer was then washed 3 times with PBS-EDTA buffer and detached by scraping, and the cells were lysed by repeated passage through a 30-gauge needle. Amastigotes were then purified by Percoll density gradient centrifugation using standard protocols (24Chang K.P. Science. 1980; 209: 1240-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). T. brucei 927 procyclic forms were grown at 26 °C in SDM-79 medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Cloning of LmPOT1—The LmPOT1 open reading frame2 (ORF) was initially identified in the L. major genome sequencing data base (accession number AY727900) using several mammalian amino acid transporters as query sequences. The LmPOT1 ORF was amplified using the PCR from L. major genomic DNA with the Advantage® HF 2 PCR kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and the PCR product ligated into both the PCR® 2.1-TOPO® (Invitrogen) and pHD309 (23Wirtz E. Hartmann C. Clayton C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3887-3894Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) vectors. For insertion into PCR® 2.1-TOPO®, the sense primer was 5′-CTGAAAAAGCTTCACATGACGATGAT CGCGCTC-3′, and the antisense primer was 5′-GCGGGGTCTAGACTAGCGCCGTACCGC-3′ (restriction sites are underlined, and the initiation and termination codons are in boldface). The LmPOT1 ORF was then excised and ligated into pOG-1 to create pOG-1-LmPOT1. To insert LmPOT1 into pHD309, the sense primer was 5′-CTGAAAAAGCTTCACATGACGATGATCGCGCTC-3′, and the antisense primer was 5′-GCGGGGAAGCTTGGGCTAGCGCCGTACCGC-3′ (HindIII sites and underlined, and start and termination codons are in boldface). The resultant plasmid was designated pHD309-LmPOT1. The fidelity of the PCR-amplified LmPOT1 inserts was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. T. brucei Transfection—Procyclic T. brucei were transfected with 5-10 μg of NotI-linearized pHD309-LmPOT1 in Cytomix buffer (25van den Hoff M.J. Moorman A.F. Lamers W.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser electroporator set at 1350 V and 25 microfarads. After electroporation, cells were diluted into 5 ml of T. brucei growth medium, and transfectants were selected in 50 μg/ml hygromycin. The resultant transfectant was designated TUB::HD309-LmPOT1 according to standard genetic nomenclature for T. brucei. A control line, TUB::HD309, transfected with pHD309 alone, was also generated. LmPOT1 Expression in Xenopus Oocytes—X. laevis oocytes were isolated and collagenase-treated as described (26Colman A. Hames B.D. Higgins J. Transcription and Translation: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Arlington, VA1984: 49-69Google Scholar). pOG-1-LmPOT1 was linearized with XbaI, and capped cRNA was synthesized using the mMessage mMachine™ T7 kit (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). Stage V-VI oocytes were injected with 20 ng of cRNA 1 day after harvest and incubated for 3 days at 16 °C in ND-96 buffer (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) supplemented with 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, and 3% fetal bovine serum. Uptake of [3H]putrescine, [3H]spermidine, [3H]pentamidine, and [3H]agmatine was measured at room temperature in LmPOT1 cRNA-injected and H2O-injected control oocytes. After incubation with radiolabel, oocytes were washed 3 times with ice-cold ND-96 and lysed with 200 μl of 1% Triton X-100, and radiolabels were quantitated by liquid scintillation. Transport Assays in T. brucei—T. brucei procyclic forms were harvested in mid-log phase and washed 3 times in PBS supplemented with 10 mm glucose (PBS-glucose). 1 × 107 cells in 100 μl were added to an equal volume of PBS-glucose containing radiolabeled ligand and inhibitors, as indicated. Uptake experiments were terminated by a modified oil-stop technique (27Hasne M.P. Barrett M.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) in which parasites were centrifuged through a 100-μl dibutyl phthalate cushion. The cell pellets were flash-frozen in liquid N2, and incorporated radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation. Western Blot Analysis—L. major promastigotes and amastigotes were washed twice in PBS and lysed in hypertonic buffer consisting of 96 mm HEPES, 500 mm sucrose, 400 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. Parasite proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as described (28Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44923) Google Scholar). Membranes were probed with the LmPOT1 antibody that had been purified over an agarose column to which the peptide immunogen was affixed. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies to chicken tubulin (ICN, Irvine, CA) were used as a positive control. The primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Pierce). Immunofluorescence—L. major promastigotes were affixed to coverslips with 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Parasites were then washed 3 times in PBS and kept intact or permeabilized for 5 min in 0.2% Triton X-100, 50 mm glycine. After 3 additional washes with PBS, parasites were incubated with affinity-purified LmPOT1 antibody (1 μg/ml) in PBS containing 1% rabbit serum and 1% goat serum at room temperature with gentle shaking for 1 h. After rinsing the coverslips in PBS, LmPOT1 antibodies were detected with anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor-568 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Coverslips were rinsed three times in wash buffer and mounted onto slides, and images were obtained using the Applied Precision Deltavision® image restoration system. Deconvolution was performed using the iterative constrained algorithm of Agard et al. (29Agard D.A. Hiraoka Y. Shaw P. Sedat J.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 30: 353-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), and additional image processing was accomplished on an SGI Octane work station located in the OHSU Core Imaging Facility in the Molecular Microbiology and Immunology Department. Isolation of LmPOT1—Because amino acids and some organocation transporters are members of the APC superfamily (30Jack D.L. Paulsen I.T. Saier M.H. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1797-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and their ligands share obvious structural similarities with polyamines, a search was initiated for novel APC transporters by screening the L. major data base with several mammalian amino acid transporters as query sequences. The data base from the L. major genome project encompassed a multiplicity of APC transporter genes, one of which, LmPOT1, predicted an unusual primary structure (see below). LmPOT1 was then cloned by PCR from genomic DNA using primers from the annotated sequence. Southern blot analysis of L. major genomic DNA revealed LmPOT1 to be a single copy gene in the L. major genome (data not shown), consistent with the deposited sequence surrounding the LmPOT1 locus on L. major chromosome 14. Translation of the LmPOT1 sequence revealed a 2409-bp ORF that encoded an 803-amino acid APC superfamily member (Fig. 1A). The sequence of the LmPOT1 clone was identical to its data base counterpart. Of the 10 distinct transporter families within the APC superfamily, LmPOT1 encompassed much of the evolutionarily conserved signature sequence (boldface and underlined in Fig. 1A) of the L-type amino acid transporter family (30Jack D.L. Paulsen I.T. Saier M.H. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1797-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). A putative calmodulin binding motif is also detected within LmPOT1 (italics in Fig. 1A). Various topological algorithms, e.g. PHD2.1 (31Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), SOSUI (32Hirokawa T. Boon-Chieng S. Mitaku S. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 378-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar), Hidden Markov (33Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9159) Google Scholar, 34Sonnhammer E.L. von Heijne G. Krogh A. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1998; 6: 175-182PubMed Google Scholar), predicted a polytopic protein between 9 or 12 transmembrane domains (TMs) flanked by 90-100 and 200-300 amino acid hydrophilic NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal extensions, respectively (TMs predicted by PHD 2.1 are depicted in Fig. 1A). Pair-wise alignments between LmPOT1 and members of the APC superfamily from phylogenetically divergent organisms revealed significant homology over the region encompassed by the TMs with amino acid identifies ranging from 20 to 30%. No homology was detected to the hydrophilic extensions. Each of these extensions was in turn used as a query sequence to screen the NCBI data base. This analysis revealed only one homolog, a gene in Trypanosoma cruzi (gi44490054), a parasite evolutionarily related to Leishmania. LmPOT1 also exhibited limited homology with the known bacterial and yeast polyamine transporters. Pairwise alignments of LmPOT1 with the E. coli putrescine transporter PotE (35Kashiwagi K. Suzuki T. Suzuki F. Furuchi T. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20922-20927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the S. cerevisiae vacuolar polyamine transporter TPO2 (7Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Asakawa T. Kakinuma Y. Michael A.J. Igarashi K. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) revealed amino acid identities of 10.8 and 11.7%, respectively. Of note, LmPOT1 exhibited significant homology with a region of PotE that has been implicated in putrescine recognition (36Kashiwagi K. Kuraishi A. Tomitori H. Igarashi A. Nishimura K. Shirahata A. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36007-36012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), including two conserved residues critical for ligand binding (Fig. 1B). Functional Expression of LmPOT1 in X. laevis Oocytes—To determine LmPOT1 ligand specificity, LmPOT1 cRNA was expressed in stage V-VI Xenopus oocytes, a heterologous expression system that exhibits negligible endogenous transport capabilities for many ligands. Oocytes injected with LmPOT1 cRNA transported 10 μm [14C]putrescine and 10 μm [14C]spermidine ∼10-fold more effectively than water-injected control oocytes (Fig. 2A). In contrast, no significant increases in [14C]spermine, [14C]arginine, [3H]agmatine, or [3H]pentamidine uptake were detected in oocytes expressing LmPOT1 cRNA compared with controls (data not shown). To determine the kinetic parameters for LmPOT1, polyamine transport was measured over a range of ligand concentrations (Fig. 2B). LmPOT1 exhibited saturable kinetics with both polyamine ligands, and apparent Km values of 6.7 ± 1.4 and 14.3 ± 0.9 μm and Vmax values of 0.11 ± 0.01 and 0.064 ± 0.004 nmol/h/oocyte were calculated for putrescine and spermidine, respectively. Functional Expression of LmPOT1 in T. brucei—To confirm the biochemical properties of LmPOT1 in a second heterologous system, the LmPOT1 ORF was cloned into the tubulin locus of T. brucei, a protozoan parasite related to Leishmania that exhibits very low rates of endogenous putrescine uptake. A control parasite line transfected with the empty vector was also created. Western blotting of extracts from the TUB::HD309-LmPOT1 and TUB::HD309 transfectants using the LmPOT1 antisera revealed the presence of two polypeptides unique to the parasites in which LmPOT1 was integrated into the tubulin locus (Fig. 3A). These bands corresponded to masses of ∼90 and ∼180 kDa, roughly equivalent to what would be expected for LmPOT1 monomers and dimers, respectively. The TUB::HD309-LmPOT1 transfectant exhibited a robust uptake capability for putrescine over the TUB::HD309 control parasites in which putrescine uptake was negligible even after 3 min (Fig. 3B, inset). Putrescine transport into TUB::HD309-LmPOT1 cells was shown to be saturable, with an apparent Km value of 10.2 ± 3.2 μm and a Vmax value of 0.061 ± 0.002 nmol/min/108 cells (Fig. 3B). To assess ligand specificity of LmPOT1, [3H]putrescine uptake into TUB::HD309-LmPOT1 parasites was measured in the presence of a 250-fold excess of a variety of structurally related compounds. As expected, excess putrescine abolished uptake of the radiolabel, whereas spermidine and spermine inhibited [3H]putrescine uptake by 39 and 64%, respectively (Fig. 4). A battery of charged and polar amino acids did not appreciably interfere with polyamine incorporation into the T. brucei transfectant. Interestingly, pentamidine, a diamidine that is used in the treatment of both African trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis, obliterated [3H]putrescine uptake, whereas agmatine, the decarboxylated product of arginine, inhibited putrescine incorporation by 85% (Fig. 4A). However, TUB::HD309-LmPOT1 cells did not exhibit augmented transport capability of radioactive pentamidine or agmatine compared with TUB::HD309 control parasites (data not shown). Because the transport of many ligands into Leishmania is mediated by ion symporters, the effects of ionophores on putrescine uptake into the TUB::HD309-LmPOT1 cells were evaluated (Fig. 4B). Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), both proton ionophores, monensin, a Na+ ionophore, and A23187, a Ca2+ ionophore, all significantly inhibited putrescine uptake into the TUB::HD309-LmPOT1 transfectants in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas valinomycin, a K+ ionophore, had no significant inhibitory effect (Fig. 4B). LmPOT1 was also assessed as a function of extracellular pH ranging from 5 to 9 and found to be optimal ∼pH 7.0 (data not shown). The Na+ dependence of LmPOT1 was also examined in the TUB::HD309-LmPOT1 transfectant. Surprisingly, replacement of NaCl with isotonic sucrose actually increased the ability of TUB::HD309-LmPOT1 parasites to take up putrescine, whereas substitution of NaCl with either choline chloride or LiCl diminished putrescine uptake 63 and 79%, respectively (Fig. 5A). Taken together, the data suggest that Na+, choline, and Li+ actually interfere with putrescine transport. This conjecture was tested by measuring putrescine uptake into TUB::HD309-LmPOT1 T. brucei under isoosmolar assay conditions in which NaCl and sucrose were varied. The data demonstrated that putrescine uptake into TUB::HD309-LmPOT1 cells was indirectly proportional to the NaCl concentration (Fig. 5B). LmPOT1 Localization and Expression—To verify the location and stage-specific expression of LmPOT1, antibodies directed against an LmPOT1 peptide were raised in rabbits. These antibodies recognized a band of Mr ∼90 in an L. major promastigote extract but failed to generate any signal with an amastigote lysate (Fig. 6A). The expected size of LmPOT1 is ∼90 kDa. The presence of a signal at 180 kDa is observed intermittently in some blots (see Fig. 3A), possibly implying that LmPOT1 may exist as a dimer (data not shown). The localization of LmPOT1 was then determined by deconvolution microscopy. Immunofluorescence analysis of LmPOT1 stained with Alexa fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies revealed the presence of the polyamine transporter on the cell surface and flagellum of both permeabilized and non-permeabilized L. major promastigote (Fig. 6B). No LmPOT1 protein could be detected in L. major amastigotes. This study reports the first identification and functional characterization of a gene encoding a surface membrane polyamine transporter in eukaryotes. The study of eukaryotic polyamine transporters in eukaryotes has previously proven refractory to molecular dissection because of the low level of homology among the previously characterized prokaryotic and yeast vacuolar protein transport proteins. LmPOT1 was identified from a L. major genome data base screen using APC members as query sequences. The original presumption that polyamine transporters might be members of the APC family (the basis for the original data base screen for LmPOT1) reflected the observations that known prokaryotic and yeast vacuolar transporters are major facilitator superfamily members. LmPOT1 was originally selected among several APC genes in the L. major data base because of its unusual length and its hydrophilic NH2- and COOH-terminal extensions. Of the 175 APC members from phylogenetically diverse organisms that were examined by Jack et al. (30Jack D.L. Paulsen I.T. Saier M.H. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1797-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), only one, SSy1 Sce from S. cerevisiae, is larger than LmPOT1, and the vast majority contain 400-600 amino acids. Secondary structure algorithms predicted 9-12 TMs for LmPOT1, consistent with expected topologies for other APC superfamily members, especially L-type amino acid transporters (30Jack D.L. Paulsen I.T. Saier M.H. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1797-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Essentially all of the sequence conservation between LmPOT1 and APC permeases is found within the TMs. The hydrophilic termini of LmPOT1 did not exhibit significant homology to any deposited sequences in the eukaryotic or prokaryotic databases, except a putative homolog in T. cruzi. The level of LmPOT1 homology to amino acid permeases was also significantly greater than that exhibited between LmPOT1 and the E. coli PotE or S. cerevisiae TPO4 vacuolar polyamine transporters. Interestingly, however, a pairwise alignment between LmPOT1 and PotE indicated that LmPOT1 accommodated two of the three residues, Trp201 and Glu207, that have been experimentally demonstrated to be involved in the interaction of PotE with putrescine (36Kashiwagi K. Kuraishi A. Tomitori H. Igarashi A. Nishimura K. Shirahata A. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36007-36012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). LmPOT1 also contains a hydrophobic residue (Met333), whose counterpart in PotE (Val249) is necessary for optimal transport function (37Minchin R.F. McCoubrie J.E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Functional analysis of LmPOT1 in X. laevis oocytes revealed LmPOT1 to be a high affinity transporter for both putrescine and spermidine, with a calculated Km value for putrescine similar to that obtained with intact Leishmania mexicana and L. donovani (20Basselin M. Coombs G.H. Barrett M.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 109: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). LmPOT1 did not mediate the uptake of spermine, a polyamine that is not synthesized by Leishmania (18Jiang Y. Roberts S.C. Jardim A. Carter N.S. Shih S. Ariyanayagam M. Fairlamb A.H. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3781-3788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), as well as arginine, agmatine, or pentamidine. The ability of LmPOT1 to transport putrescine was confirmed in TUB::HD309-LmPOT1 T. brucei procyclic forms, which exhibit negligible endogenous putrescine transport capability, and the Km values for putrescine transport into oocytes and T. brucei were alike. Inhibition studies of putrescine uptake into the TUB::HD309-LmPOT1 transformant implied a narrow ligand specificity of LmPOT1 for polyamines, since an assortment of amino acids at a 250-fold molar excess did not diminish [3H]putrescine uptake. Agmatine, the decarboxylation product of arginine, did inhibit [3H]putrescine uptake, however, and a 250-fold surfeit of pentamidine, a drug used for the treatment of both leishmaniasis and African trypanosomiasis obliterated [3H]putrescine uptake by TUB::HD309-LmPOT1 parasites, although the drug itself is not transported through LmPOT1. These data parallel results with intact Leishmania in which polyamine transport is potently inhibited by pentamidine yet pentamidine uptake is not affected by excess polyamines (20Basselin M. Coombs G.H. Barrett M.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 109: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 38Basselin M. Denise H. Coombs G.H. Barrett M.P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 3731-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Although pentamidine transport has not been meticulously investigated in Leishmania (21Basselin M. Lawrence F. Robert-Gero M. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 631-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 38Basselin M. Denise H. Coombs G.H. Barrett M.P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 3731-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), at least three biochemically distinct pentamidine transporters have been identified in T. brucei (39De Koning H.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 586-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The ability of LmPOT1 to mediate the transport of polyamines into oocytes and T. brucei implies that the polypeptide is targeted to the cell surface in the two heterologous expression systems. This parallels direct observations in Leishmania promastigotes, where LmPOT1 expression appears to be restricted to the parasite cell surface and flagellar compartments. Interestingly, the protein was not detected in amastigotes, an intracellular milieu that is likely rich in polyamines. The stage specificity of LmPOT1 expression might not be surprising in view of the observation that LmPOT1 activity is reduced at pH ∼ 5.0, the reported pH of the phagolysosome (40Burchmore R.J. Barrett M.P. Int. J. Parasitol. 2001; 31: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) in which the amastigote resides. This would suggest that additional polyamine transporters must be available to the amastigote, a hypothesis that is substantiated by biochemical studies with L. mexicana and L. donovani amastigotes (20Basselin M. Coombs G.H. Barrett M.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 109: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Putrescine transport via LmPOT1 was inhibited in a dosedependent fashion by the proton ionophores FCCP and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. Because Leishmania promastigotes maintain a large proton electrochemical gradient across their cell surface with a resting potential ∼-100 mV (41Glaser T.A. Utz G.L. Mukkada A.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 51: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), it can be reasonably inferred that this genus often takes advantage of this proton gradient to steer nutrient uptake into the parasite. Examples of proton-driven leishmanial transporters include the myo-inositol, adenosine-pyrimidine nucleoside, and inosine-guanosine transporters from L. donovani (42Klamo E.M. Drew M.E. Landfear S.M. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14937-14943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 43Stein A. Vaseduvan G. Carter N.S. Ullman B. Landfear S.M. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35127-35134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Whether LmPOT1 is a proton/polyamine co-transporter remains to be elucidated but can be conjectured from the pharmacologic evidence. In contrast, many mammalian active transporters are Na+-dependent (44Balcar V.J. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2002; 25: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 45Kanai Y. Hediger M.A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 479: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 46Okuda T. Haga T. Neurochem. Res. 2003; 28: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The ability of LmPOT1 to take up putrescine in Na+-free medium, however, establishes that LmPOT1-mediated transport is Na+-independent. Although Na+ is not required as a ligand for putrescine transport by LmPOT1, the cation is likely an important element in the maintenance of the membrane potential. Thus, inhibition of LmPOT1-mediated transport by monensin could be ascribed to a disruption of the Na+ gradient across the plasma membrane. Interestingly, Na+ as well as Li+ and choline+ appeared to exert an inhibitory effect upon LmPOT1 (Fig. 5). Inhibition of polyamine transport by Na+,Li+, and choline+ has also been observed with mammalian cells (47Poulin R. Lessard M. Zhao C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1695-1704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Ca2+ is also known to affect polyamine transport into eukaryotes, although the effects are disparate. Ca2+ stimulates polyamine uptake in human fibroblasts (48Khan N.A. Quemener V. Seiler N. Moulinoux J.P. Pathobiology. 1990; 58: 172-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and breast cancer cells (47Poulin R. Lessard M. Zhao C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1695-1704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), whereas the divalent cation inhibits polyamine transport into embryonic mesenchymal cells (49Gawel-Thompson K. Greene R.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 136: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and Neurospora crassa (50Davis R.H. Ristow J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 267: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Because the calcium ionophore A23687 inhibited putrescine uptake into TUB::HD309-LmPOT1 T. brucei, it is possible that putrescine transport via LmPOT1 is Ca2+-dependent. This notion is reinforced by the prediction of a putative calmodulin binding motif within the LmPOT1 sequence (see Fig. 1). The overall contribution of LmPOT1 to polyamine transport in Leishmania remains to be elucidated. To determine whether LmPOT1 is an essential protein and whether other polyamine transporters exist in the parasite is being addressed by targeted gene replacement strategies in which each LmPOT1 copy will be replaced with a drug resistance cassette. Although one might conjecture that polyamine uptake into Leishmania is not an essential process, the homolog in T. cruzi, if functionally validated, may very well have an essential function. T. cruzi lack both arginase and ornithine decarboxylase activities and are, therefore, auxotrophic for polyamines (51Bacchi C.J. Yarlett N. Mini Rev. Med. Chem. 2002; 2: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 52Hunter K.J. Le Quesne S.A. Fairlamb A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, polyamine transport from the external milieu is an obligate nutritional function for T. cruzi. The availability of LmPOT1 and expression systems for functional validation of polyamine uptake capability and genetic studies on APC proteins from phylogentically diverse organisms and polyamine transporters from yeast vacuoles and prokaryotes provides a cornerstone for structure-function studies that should enable a dissection of the functional determinants that are critical to the permeation mechanism and ligand recognition and for validating LmPOT1 as a drug target. We thank Michael Barrett, University of Glasgow, for the generous gift of radiolabeled pentamidine and Dr. Nicola Carter and Dr. Sigrid Roberts for the critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2065354104,"The two recently identified protein acyl transferases (PATs), Akr1p and Erf2p/Erf4p, point toward the DHHC protein family as a likely PAT family. The DHHC protein family, defined by the novel, zinc finger-like DHHC cysteine-rich domain (DHHC-CRD), is a diverse collection of polytopic membrane proteins extending through all eukaryotes. To define the PAT domains that are oriented to the cytoplasm and are thus available to effect the cytoplasmically limited palmitoyl modification, we have determined the transmembrane topology of the yeast PAT Akr1p. Portions of the yeast protein invertase (Suc2p) were inserted in-frame at 10 different hydrophilic sites within the Akr1 polypeptide. Three of the Akr1-Suc2-Akr1 insertion proteins were found to be extensively glycosylated, indicating that the invertase segment inserted at these Akr1p sites is luminally oriented. The remaining seven insertion proteins were not glycosylated, consistent with a cytoplasmic orientation for these sites. The results support a model in which the Akr1 polypeptide crosses the bilayer six times with the bulk of its hydrophilic domains disposed toward the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic domains include both the relatively large, ankyrin repeat-containing N-terminal domain and the DHHC-CRD, which maps to a cytosolic loop segment. Functionality of the different Akr1-Suc2-Akr1 proteins also was examined. Insertions at only 4 of the 10 sites were found to disrupt Akr1p function. Interestingly, these four sites all map cytoplasmically, suggesting key roles for these cytoplasmic domains in Akr1 PAT function.

Many proteins, particularly many signaling proteins, rely on covalent lipid modifications, either prenylation, myristoylation, or palmitoylation, for membrane attachment. Being limited to the cytoplasmic compartment, these lipid modifications serve to tether proteins to the cytoplasmic surface of cellular membranes. The enzymes that mediate myristoylation and prenylation, i.e. the myristoyl and prenyl transferases, are soluble cytoplasmic proteins. In contrast, the palmitoyl transferases, i.e. the protein acyl transferases (PATs), 1The abbreviations used are: PAT, protein acyl transferase; CRD, cysteine-rich domain; TMD, transmembrane domain; HA, hemagglutinin; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; GST, glutathione S-transferase.1The abbreviations used are: PAT, protein acyl transferase; CRD, cysteine-rich domain; TMD, transmembrane domain; HA, hemagglutinin; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; GST, glutathione S-transferase. the first examples having been identified only recently, are predicted to be polytopic membrane proteins (1Roth A.F.

To gain insight into the PAT domains that are available cytoplasmically to mediate this lipid modification, we have determined the transmembrane topology of the prototypical PAT, the yeast protein Akr1p. The first PATs were identified through recent work in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Akr1p was identified as the PAT for the two plasma membrane-localized, type I casein kinases, Yck1p and Yck2p, whereas Erf2p and Erf4p were found to collaborate for the palmitoylation of the yeast Ras proteins, Ras1p and Ras2p (1Roth A.F.

Chem. 2002; 277: 41268-41273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The two yeast PATs are substrate-specific. Although Ras2p is mislocalized from the plasma membrane in erf2Δ or in erf4Δ cells, the plasma membrane localization of Yck2p remains unperturbed. Likewise, in akr1Δ cells, Yck1p and Yck2p mislocalize, whereas Ras2p plasma membrane localization remains unaffected (1Roth A.F. Feng Y. Chen L. Davis N.G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Akr1p localizes to the Golgi (1Roth A.F. Feng Y. Chen L. Davis N.G. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 49352-49359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation of Yck1p and Yck2p is fully dependent on Akr1p in vivo, being abolished in an akr1Δ cell context. Furthermore, when purified to apparent homogeneity, Akr1p alone promotes the in vitro transfer of the palmitoyl moiety from palmitoyl-CoA to the Yck2 substrate protein, indicating that no accessory subunits are required for Akr1 PAT activity (1Roth A.F. Feng Y. Chen L. Davis N.G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In contrast, Erf2p and Erf4p appear to collaborate for Ras2p palmitoylation, both in vivo and in vitro (2Lobo S. Greentree W.K. Linder M.E. Deschenes R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41268-41273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 4Bartels D.J. Mitchell D.A. Dong X. Deschenes R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6775-6787Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), suggesting that these two proteins may be co-subunits of the Ras PAT. As the 86-kDa Akr1p is notably larger than either the 41-kDa Erf2p or the 27-kDa Erf4p, Akr1p may represent an evolutionary melding of the two functions into a single polypeptide. Although the two PATs do not share extensive sequence homology, Akr1p and Erf2p are both predicted to be polytopic membrane proteins, and both contain the 51-residue-long novel zinc finger-like sequence, the DHHC cysteine-rich domain (DHHC-CRD). The DHHC-CRD sequence defines a diverse protein family extending through all eukaryotes; yeast has seven DHHC proteins, whereas 23 have been identified from the human genome. Aside from the DHHC-CRD, DHHC proteins share little sequence homology. Nonetheless, all are predicted to be polytopic membrane proteins, and all have the DHHC-CRD sequence analogously positioned between predicted transmembrane domains (TMDs). Beyond the two PATs, Akr1p and Erf2p, little is known regarding the biochemical function of other DHHC family members. An intriguing possibility is that these proteins may all be PATs. As mutation of conserved DHHC-CRD residues abolishes PAT activity for both Akr1p and Erf2p (1Roth A.F. Feng Y. Chen L. Davis N.G. J.

The substantial diversity embodied within this family perhaps accommodates the diverse range of substrate proteins that are known to be palmitoylated (6Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys.

Consistent with a general DHHC protein role in protein palmitoylation, a recent study of the rat GODZ indicates a role for this protein in the palmitoylation of the γ2 subunit of the pentameric GABAA receptor (12Keller C.A. Yuan X. Panzanelli P. Martin M.L. Alldred M. Sassoe-Pognetto M. Luscher B. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5881-5891Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In addition to its DHHC-CRD, which has been implicated in catalysis, Akr1p also has a domain for protein-protein interaction, a stretch of six ankyrin repeats that localize to its N-terminal hydrophilic domain. The two known Akr1p substrates, the type I casein kinases Yck1p and Yck2p, presumably, are presented to Akr1p from the cytoplasm. When Yck palmitoylation is blocked, either through cis-mutation of their C-terminal, palmitoyl-accepting Cys-Cys dipeptides or through trans-mutation of the Akr1 PAT (i.e. akr1Δ), the kinases, rather than tethering to the plasma membrane, instead are left to distribute diffusely throughout the cytoplasm. To identify the Akr1p domains potentially available for substrate interaction and catalysis, we have determined, with the analysis below, a transmembrane topology for Akr1p. The yeast strains used in this work (Table I) are isogenic to LRB759 (MATα ura3–52 leu2 his3) (13Panek H.R. Stepp J.D. Engle H.M. Marks K.M. Tan P.K. Lemmon S.K. Robinson L.C.

Open table in a new tab AKR1-SUC2-AKR1 Constructs—The starting point for the AKR1-SUC2-AKR1 constructs was a GAL1P-AKR1(3xHA/FLAG/His) plasmid pND1436, which expresses from upstream GAL1 regulatory sequences, Akr1p C-terminally tagged by three iterations of the HA epitope, a single FLAG epitope, and then finally, at the C terminus, 6 histidine residues (1Roth A.F. Feng Y. Chen L. Davis N.G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The vector backbone for pND1436 is the yeast, single copy CEN/ARS/URA3 vector plasmid pRS316 (15Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Insertion of the invertase-encoding SUC2 sequences into AKR1 utilized a strategy of in vivo gap repair in which the GAL1P-AKR1(3xHA/FLAG/His) plasmid, linearized at the insertion site, was recircularized through in vivo homologous recombination with a chimeric DNA fragment consisting of the SUC2 sequences, flanked by 51 bp of upstream and downstream AKR1 homology. The first step in this process was to introduce, by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (16Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4557) Google Scholar), unique SmaI restriction sites at the desired insertion sites within the AKR1 coding sequence of pND1436. Ten sites, sites A–J (see Fig. 3A), were chosen, with the 6-bp CCCGGG SmaI site being inserted between codons Met1 and Val2 (site A), Cys209 and Arg210 (site B), Tyr294 and Ser295 (site C), His343 and Ile344 (site D), Arg374 and Met375 (site E), Thr411 and Phe412 (site F), Val453 and Arg454 (site G), Lys550 and Asn551 (site H), and Lys614 and Ser615 (site I). Insertion site J is located just C-terminally of the 3xHA/FLAG/His tri-tag sequence. The AKR-SUC2-AKR1 chimeric DNA fragments for gap repair of the SmaI-linearized plasmids were generated by PCR. The upstream PCR primer consisted of the 51 bp of the AKR1 sequence immediately upstream of the insertion point followed at the 3′ end by 19 bp of the SUC2 sequence that serves as the primer for the invertase segment. Likewise, the downstream primer had the 51 bp of the AKR1 sequence immediately downstream of the insertion point followed by the 19 bp of the SUC2 sequence, serving as the downstream primer of the invertase segment to be inserted. The PCR template was the SUC2-containing plasmid pSL883 (17Clark K.L. Davis N.G. Wiest D.K. Hwang-Shum J.J. Sprague Jr., G.F. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1988; 53: 611-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR product together with the appropriate SmaI-linearized plasmid were co-introduced into LRB759 yeast cells, and Ura+ transformants were selected. Plasmids isolated from the yeast transformants were amplified in Escherichia coli, and the fidelity of the gap repair was assessed by restriction analysis. Two series of AKR1-SUC2-AKR1 constructs were made. The first series inserted a 46-residue-long invertase segment, invertase residues Gln88–Tyr133. This invertase segment, like the one used by Gilstrung and Ljungdahl (18Gilstring C.F. Ljungdahl P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31488-31495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), includes the three NX(S/T) sites at residues 97–99, 111–113, and 118–120, which are known to be used for N-linked glycosylation in secreted invertase (19Reddy V.A. Johnson R.S. Biemann K. Williams R.S. Ziegler F.D. Trimble R.B. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6978-6985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second series utilized the entire mature form of secreted invertase from Thr32 (located just to the C-terminal side of the invertase signal peptide cleavage site) to the C-terminal invertase residue Lys532. Other Plasmids—For the N-terminal AKR1 deletions (Δ2–21, Δ2–70, and Δ2–295), an upstream BamHI site, introduced by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (16Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4557) Google Scholar) between codons 1 and 2, was ligated to downstream BamHI sites, introduced at codons 21, 70, and 295. Similarly, the two C-terminal AKR1 deletions (Δ614–764 and Δ733–764) involved ligation of a downstream XhoI site, located just prior to the termination codon, to upstream XhoI sites that had been introduced at codons 614 and 733. The deletion constructs were carried on the pRS316 vector plasmid with expression controlled by upstream AKR1 regulatory sequences. For GAL1P-STE2(3xHA), three HA epitope iterations replace the 6 C-terminal residues of the Ste2p C-terminal regulatory tail domain. For AKR1-GST(3xHA), the Schistosoma japonicum glutathione S-transferase (from pGEX-2T; Amersham Biosciences) is fused in-frame to the Akr1p C terminus, just prior to three iterations of the HA epitope. Wild-type yeast cells (LRB759), transformed by plasmids for GAL1P-driven protein expression, were cultured overnight to log phase in YPR (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% raffinose). The addition of galactose to 2% initiated a 2-h period of protein expression, which was terminated by the subsequent addition of glucose to 3%. Following a final 20-min growth interval, 4 × 107 cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.18 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (1 m sorbitol, 25 mm Tris/Cl, pH 8.0), trichloroacetic acid was added to 17%, and the cells were frozen at –80 °C until the time of their processing to protein extracts. For some experiments, tunicamycin was added at 20 μg/ml, 30 min prior to the addition of galactose. To prepare protein extracts, the frozen cell suspensions were thawed on ice, and a 0.2-ml volume of 0.3-μm glass beads (Sigma) was added followed by 10 min of vigorous vortexing. Two hundred and fifty microliters of 5% trichloroacetic acid were then added, and the cell lysate was decanted away from the rapidly settling beads into a fresh tube. The beads were subsequently washed with one 0.3-ml aliquot of 5% trichloroacetic acid, and the additional lysate recovered was combined with the initial lysate. Following 20 min on ice, the precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation (10 min, 13,000 rpm, 4 °C). The protein pellet was washed with 1 ml of acetone at room temperature, and then, following desiccation, 100 μl of sample buffer (5% SDS, 8 m urea, 40 mm Tris/Cl, pH 6.8, 0.1 mm EDTA) containing 1% β-mercaptoethanol was added, and the pellets were dissolved with a 10-min, 37 °C incubation interspersed with vigorous vortexing. Six microliters of each sample was then subjected to SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and finally, development with the anti-HA mAb conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Roche Applied Science). The different SUC2 insertion alleles and several N- and C-terminal AKR1 deletion alleles were tested for their ability to restore 37 °C growth to akr1Δ cells. The different mutant alleles were introduced into NDY1405 on the single copy URA3 yeast vector plasmid pRS316 under the expression control of natural AKR1 upstream regulatory sequences. Suspensions of the NDY1405 transformants were diluted and spot-titered on uracil-lacking, minimal medium plates that were incubated either at 25 or at 37 °C. A modification of the Drisdel and Green protocol (20Drisdel R.C. Green W.N. BioTechniques. 2004; 36: 276-285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an in vitro exchange of protein acyl modifications for a biotinylated compound, was used to assess Yck2p palmitoylation in the different akr1 mutant cell contexts. Our modification is a proteomic adaptation that biotinylates and purifies palmitoylated proteins from complex protein extracts. 2A. Roth, B. Sun, A. Bailey, J. Kuchar, W. Green, B. Phinney, J. Yates, and N. Davis, manuscript in preparation. In brief, total protein prepared from the different akr1 mutant cells expressing N-terminally His/FLAG/HA tri-tagged Yck2p from the GAL1 promoter were subjected to the Drisdel and Green acyl-biotin exchange reactions (20Drisdel R.C. Green W.N. BioTechniques. 2004; 36: 276-285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First, free thiols were blocked with N-ethylmaleimide; second, thioesters (i.e. cysteinyl-acyl linkages) were cleaved with 1 m hydroxylamine; and finally, thiols, newly exposed by the hydroxylamine treatment, were modified with a thiol-specific biotinylation reagent. Biotin-HPDP (Pierce), which disulfide-bonds to thiols, was substituted for the biotin-BMCC (Pierce) used by Drisdel and Green (20Drisdel R.C. Green W.N. BioTechniques. 2004; 36: 276-285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following biotinylation, epitope-tagged Yck2p was immune-precipitated with M2 anti-FLAG mAb-agarose and subjected to SDS-PAGE by Western analysis either with avidin-HRP (Pierce, Rockford, IL) to detect Yck2p biotinylation or with anti-HA-HRP to detect total recovery of the His/FLAG/HA-tagged Yck2 protein. NDY1405 cells were doubly transformed by the AKR1–3xHA/FLAG/His-CEN/ARS/LEU2 and the AKR1-GST/3xHA-CEN/ARS/URA3 plasmid constructs or by just one of the two AKR1 plasmids plus the complementarily marked empty vector plasmid, either pRS316 or pRS315 (15Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two plasmids were maintained in the cells during the course of the experiment by growth in minimal yeast medium, unsupplemented by uracil or leucine. Lysates were prepared under the native conditions previously used to purify active Akr1p (1Roth A.F. Feng Y. Chen L. Davis N.G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were broken by mortar and pestle grinding in liquid nitrogen, and then total yeast membranes were isolated and solubilized by Triton X-100. Finally, FLAG-tagged Akr1p was immune-precipitated with M2 anti-FLAG mAb-agarose (Sigma). Wash buffer was supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml bovine liver lipids (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) to maintain bilayer-like conditions as described previously (1Roth A.F. Feng Y. Chen L. Davis N.G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Finally, purified proteins were eluted in sample buffer and subjected to anti-HA Western blotting. Akr1p Hydropathy Analysis—Akr1p hydropathy analysis finds numerous sequences with hydrophobicity sufficient for service as TMDs (Fig. 1). In addition to the five strongly hydrophobic peaks, there are three sequences of marginal hydrophobicity, at residues 182–201, 554–568, and 661–680, that could potentially serve as TMDs, particularly within the context of a polytopic membrane protein. A further uncertainty relates to the broad bifurcated peak, corresponding to residues 324–361, a 38-residue stretch of uncharged residues with the somewhat polar sequence SHINP, centrally embedded at residues 342–346. Does the 324–361 correspond to one or two TMDs? Thus, sequence information alone predicts anywhere from 5–9 TMDs. Analysis of Akr1-Suc2-Akr1 Constructs—As an experimental approach to the topology problem, we have opted to examine the usage of Asn-X-Ser/Thr (NX(S/T)) N-linked glycosylation sites introduced into the different Akr1p hydrophilic domains, the glycosylation sites being donated from segments of the secreted and heavily glycosylated yeast protein invertase (Suc2p). NX(S/T) sites introduced into the luminally oriented domains of Akr1p would be expected to be glycosylated, whereas those introduced into cytoplasmic domains should be unavailable to the luminally localized glycosyl transferases and thus should remain unglycosylated. Prior to embarking on this analysis, we first examined the usage of the four NX(S/T) sequences that are naturally present in the Akr1p sequence (Fig. 1). A C-terminally, epitope-tagged Akr1p was expressed from the GAL1 promoter in the presence or absence of tunicamycin, a drug that blocks N-linked glycosylation (Fig. 2). The tagged AKR1 is apparently functional; the tagged AKR1 complements akr1Δ, restoring 37 °C growth to the temperature-sensitive akr1Δ cells (data not shown). As a control, we have also examined the glycosylation of the α-factor pheromone receptor Ste2p, a protein having three NX(S/T) sites that is known to receive N-linked glycosylation (21Reneke J.E. Blumer K.J. Courchesne W.E. Thorner J. Cell. 1988; 55: 221-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Indeed, tunicamycin treatment does substantially alter gel mobility for Ste2p (Fig. 2). In contrast, Akr1p gel mobility is unaltered by tunicamycin, indicating that the four Akr1 NX(S/T) sites likely are not used for glycosylation. To assess Akr1p topology, we made a series of Akr1-Suc2-Akr1 constructs that inserted a 46-residue-long segment of invertase, containing three NX(S/T) sites known to be utilized for glycosylation (19Reddy V.A. Johnson R.S. Biemann K. Williams R.S. Ziegler F.D. Trimble R.B. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6978-6985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), at seven different positions within the AKR1 open reading frame (Fig. 3A, positions A, C, D, E, F, G, and H). This strategy had been successfully employed by Gilstring and Ljundahl (18Gilstring C.F. Ljungdahl P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31488-31495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) to assess topology of the yeast general amino acid permease Gap1p. Gel mobility of the seven Akr1-Suc2-Akr1 insertion proteins was compared (Fig. 3B). Our expectation, based on the published Gap1p analysis (18Gilstring C.F. Ljungdahl P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31488-31495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), was to see up-shifted gel mobilities for those constructs for which the inserted invertase sequences were luminally oriented. Surprisingly, no substantial mobility differences were seen among the seven Akr1-Suc2-Akr1 proteins; all migrated to essentially the same position, the position of the unglycosylated Akr1-Suc2-Akr1 protein (Fig. 3B). For Akr1-Suc2-Akr1-(D) and -(F), a minor subpopulation of the protein was found to diffusely migrate with retarded mobility (Fig. 3B). This rather subtle effect likely reflects a low level of heterogeneous glycosylation as this more slowly migrating protein smear is abolished with expression of the insertion proteins in tunicamycin-treated cells (data not shown). Nonetheless, this minor glycosylation effect is far more subtle than the striking glycosylation shifts seen for analogous Gap1-Suc2-Gap1 insertion constructs (18Gilstring C.F. Ljungdahl P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31488-31495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Perhaps for the Akr1p structure, luminal segments are less well exposed and are thus less available to glycosyl transferases; indeed, glycosylation site usage is known to correlate with site availability during protein folding (22Holst B. Bruun A.W. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Winther J.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3538-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that luminally oriented NX(S/T) sites of the Akr1-Suc2-Akr1 proteins are, in fact, glycosylated but simply with smaller, and thus less easily detectable, oligosaccharide moieties than those attached to Gap1p. Indeed, the elaboration of the N-linked core oligosaccharide varies tremendously for yeast glycoproteins; secreted proteins and proteins of the yeast cell wall generally have highly elaborated oligosaccharides with up to 100 mannose moieties added per oligosaccharide, whereas the glycosyl modifications of Golgi and vacuolar constituents generally are much less elaborate (23Munro S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In hopes of magnifying the glycosylation effect, a second series of Akr1-Suc2-Akr1 constructs with virtually the entire invertase coding sequence inserted was generated. The 511-residue-long invertase portion used corresponds to mature invertase in its entirety (minus the N-terminal signal peptide) with its 10 N-linked glycosylation sites. This invertase segment was inserted at 10 Akr1p sites: the seven positions utilized for the smaller, 46-residue Suc2 inserts plus three additional sites (Fig. 3A, site"
https://openalex.org/W2003974455,"Although many proteins require the binding of a ligand to be functional, the role of ligand binding during folding is scarcely investigated. Here, we have reported the influence of the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) cofactor on the global stability and folding kinetics of Azotobacter vinelandii holoflavodoxin. Earlier studies have revealed that A. vinelandii apoflavodoxin kinetically folds according to the four-state mechanism: I1 ⇔ unfolded apoflavodoxin ⇔ I2 ⇔ native apoflavodoxin. I1an off-pathway molten globule-like is intermediate that populates during denaturant-induced equilibrium unfolding; I2 is a high energy on-pathway folding intermediate that never populates to a significant extent. Here, we have presented extensive denaturant-induced equilibrium unfolding data of holoflavodoxin, holoflavodoxin with excess FMN, and apoflavodoxin as well as kinetic folding and unfolding data of holoflavodoxin. All folding data are excellently described by a five-state mechanism: I1 + FMN ⇔ unfolded apoflavodoxin + FMN ⇔ I2 + FMN ⇔ native apoflavodoxin + FMN⇔ holoflavodoxin. The last step in flavodoxin folding is thus the binding of FMN to native apoflavodoxin. I1,I2, and unfolded apoflavodoxin do not interact to a significantextent with FMN. The autonomous formation of native apoflavodoxin is essential during holoflavodoxin folding. Excess FMN does not accelerate holoflavodoxin folding, and FMN does not act as a nucleation site for folding. The stability of holoflavodoxin is so high that even under strongly denaturing conditions FMN needs to be released first before global unfolding of the protein can occur.

The stability of holoflavodoxin is so high that even under strongly denaturing conditions FMN needs to be released first before global unfolding of the protein can occur. Both in vivo and in vitro the folding of a protein is a complex process. Current knowledge about this process largely stems from in vitro studies of small proteins (<20 kDa). The general picture that has emerged is that the topology of the native state is a key factor in determining the rate with which a protein folds (1Baker D. Nature. 2000; 405: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). In addition, many proteins form one or more metastable intermediates while folding. Some of these intermediates are interpreted to be productive species that accelerate the folding process, whereas others appear to be misfolded conformations (2Baldwin R.L. Folding Des. 1996; 1: R1-R8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The role an intermediate has in kinetic folding also depends to some extent on the experimental conditions used (3Bieri O. Wildegger G. Bachmann A. Wagner C. Kiefhaber T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12460-12470Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Many proteins require the binding of a non-covalently bound ligand to be functional. The ligand, or cofactor, can vary from a simple metal ion to a large organic molecule. The influences of cofactor binding on the structure of the protein are manifold. For example, apocytochrome c is largely unstructured; it only folds upon incorporation of its heme cofactor (4Fisher W.R. Taniuchi H. Anfinsen C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3188-3195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, apoflavodoxin is structurally identical to holoflavodoxin, except for increased dynamics in the region where the flavin cofactor binds (5Steensma E. Nijman M.J.M. Bollen Y.J.M. de Jager P.A. van den Berg W.A.M. van Dongen W.M.A.M. van Mierlo C.P.M. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 6Steensma E. van Mierlo C.P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 653-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The quaternary structure of a protein also can depend on the binding of a cofactor. For example, inactive monomeric apolipoamide dehydrogenase forms active dimers after incorporation of FAD (7van Berkel W.J.H. Benen J.A.E. Snoek M.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although many proteins require the binding of a non-covalently bound ligand to be functional, the role of ligand binding during folding is scarcely investigated. In principle, a ligand could bind to an unfolded protein and reduce the conformational freedom of the polypeptide, thereby reducing the conformational space sampled during protein folding. Such ligands might potentially speed up the folding process by acting as a nucleation site. In some cases, ligands indeed remain bound to the unfolded protein (8Bertini I. Cowan J.A. Luchinat C. Natarajan K. Piccioli M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9332-9339Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 9Robinson C.R. Liu Y. Thomson J.A. Sturtevant J.M. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16141-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, in other cases, ligands may not interact with non-native protein states and only become incorporated in the protein during the final stages of protein folding. In vivo, chaperones may also play a role in the incorporation of a ligand. As kinetic folding studies of proteins in the presence of their ligands are sparse, the kinetic role of ligand binding during protein folding remains unclear. Flavoproteins offer a good opportunity to study the role of ligand binding during protein folding. The flavin cofactor is generally non-covalently bound and can be reversibly removed (10Hefti M.H. Vervoort J. van Berkel W.J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4227-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of the holoprotein from its constituents can be studied because of changes in spectroscopic properties that accompany flavin binding. Here, the influence of the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) 1The abbreviations used are: FMN, flavin mononucleotide; GuHCl, guanidinium chloride. cofactor on the folding of the 179-residue Azotobacter vinelandii flavodoxin was investigated. Flavodoxins are monomeric proteins (Fig. 1) that function as low potential one-electron carriers in many microorganisms. Both the denaturant-induced equilibrium unfolding and the kinetic folding of A. vinelandii apoflavodoxin, i.e. flavodoxin in the absence of its cofactor, have recently been studied in great detail (11van Mierlo C.P.M. van Dongen W.M.A.M.

Apoflavodoxin is structurally identical to holoflavodoxin except for increased dynamics in the flavin binding region (5Steensma E. Nijman M.J.M. Bollen Y.J.M. de Jager P.A. van den Berg W.A.M. van Dongen W.M.A.M. van Mierlo C.P.M. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 6Steensma E. van Mierlo C.P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 653-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Apoflavodoxin kinetic folding can be described by the model shown in Equation 1 (13Bollen Y.J.M. Sa ́nchez I.E. van Mierlo C.P.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10475-10489Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar)[I1⇄U⇄I2⇄N](Eq. 1) where U and N are unfolded and native apoflavodoxin, respectively, and I1 and I2 are folding intermediates. During denaturant-induced equilibrium unfolding apoflavodoxin populates the relatively stable folding intermediate I1, which has molten globule-like characteristics. During kinetic A. vinelandii apoflavodoxin folding intermediate I1 acts as a trap. Intermediate I1 is off the direct folding route between unfolded and native apoflavodoxin and has to unfold before native apoflavodoxin can be formed. Some folding apoflavodoxin molecules manage to circumvent this trap and fold via a direct and rapid route to the native state, on which the second folding intermediate I2 is located. This second intermediate is highly unstable and never populates to a significant extent and is thus not observed during denaturant-induced equilibrium unfolding of apoflavodoxin. All folding apoflavodoxin molecules pass through this high energy intermediate before reaching the native state. In this study we reported on (i) the kinetics of FMN binding to native A. vinelandii apoflavodoxin, (ii) the kinetics of FMN binding during A. vinelandii holoflavodoxin folding, (iii) the release of FMN during A. vinelandii holoflavodoxin unfolding, and (iv) the influence of FMN binding on the global stability of A. vinelandii holoflavodoxin. By doing so, the role of FMN during A. vinelandii flavodoxin folding was deciphered. Materials—Guanidinium chloride (GuHCl, ultrapure) and potassium pyrophosphate were from Sigma. In holoflavodoxin equilibrium unfolding experiments, FMN purchased from Sigma was used without further purification. In all other experiments FMN obtained during the preparation of apoflavodoxin (see below) and purified by reverse-phase HPLC was used. Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant A. vinelandii C69A holoflavodoxin was obtained and purified as described previously (5Steensma E. Nijman M.J.M. Bollen Y.J.M. de Jager P.A. van den Berg W.A.M. van Dongen W.M.A.M. van Mierlo C.P.M. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 11van Mierlo C.P.M. van Dongen W.M.A.M. Vergeldt F. van Berkel W.J.H. Steensma E. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2331-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The holoflavodoxin concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient of 11.3 mm–1 cm–1 at 452 nm (15Klugkist J. Voorberg J. Haaker H. Veeger C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 155: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Apoflavodoxin was subsequently prepared by trichloroacetic acid precipitation (11van Mierlo C.P.M. van Dongen W.M.A.M. Vergeldt F. van Berkel W.J.H. Steensma E. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2331-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 16Edmondson D.E. Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) followed by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 prep grade column (Amersham Biosciences) to remove apoflavodoxin molecules in an oligomeric state (13Bollen Y.J.M. Sa ́nchez I.E. van Mierlo C.P.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10475-10489Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The apoflavodoxin concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 29 mm–1 cm–1 (17Barman B.G. Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4746-4754Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Dissociation Constant of the Apoflavodoxin-FMN complex—The dissociation constant of the apoflavodoxin-FMN complex was determined using the quenching of FMN fluorescence upon binding to the apoprotein (18Mayhew S.G. Wassink J.H. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 66: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A solution of 1.5 ml containing 210 nm FMN (based on the extinction coefficient at 445 nm of 12.2 mm–1 cm–1 (19Lostao A. Gomez-Moreno C. Mayhew S.G. Sancho J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14334-14344Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar)) in 100 mm potassium pyrophosphate, pH 6.0, was titrated with aliquots of 4.1 μm apoflavodoxin in the same buffer. After each addition of protein, the system was allowed to equilibrate for 5 min in the dark. Subsequently, the FMN fluorescence intensity was determined using a Cary eclipse fluorimeter equipped with a peltier accessory operating at 25 °C (Varian, Palo Alto, CA). Excitation was at 445 nm with a slit of 5 nm; emission was recorded at 525 nm with a slit of 10 nm. The dissociation constant of the apoflavodoxin-FMN complex was determined by fitting the fluorescence emission to Equation 2, a slightly modified equation compared with the one described in Ref. 19Lostao A. Gomez-Moreno C. Mayhew S.G. Sancho J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14334-14344Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar,[F=dFend+Fδ(dCF−(CA+KD+dCF)−(CA+KD+dCF)2−4CAdCF2)](Eq. 2) where F is the observed fluorescence intensity after each addition, d the dilution factor (initial volume/total volume), Fend the remaining fluorescence intensity after the titration (resulting from both fluorescence of holoflavodoxin and traces of flavin impurities that are unable to bind to apoflavodoxin), Fδ the difference in molar emission intensity between holoflavodoxin and free FMN, CF the initial concentration of FMN, CA the total protein concentration (i.e. apo + holo), and KD the dissociation constant of the apoflavodoxin-FMN complex. The fit resulted in values for CA that indicate an apoflavodoxin stock solution of 4.4 μm instead of 4.1 μm. As a consequence, an extinction coefficient for A. vinelandii apoflavodoxin at 280 nm of 27 mm–1 cm–1 was used in the rest of this study instead of the value of 29 mm–1 cm–1 reported elsewhere (17Barman B.G. Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4746-4754Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). FMN Binding Kinetics—Kinetic FMN binding experiments were performed on a BioLogic (Claix, France) SFM-4 stopped-flow apparatus. Solutions were thermostated at 25 °C using a circulating water bath. FMN and apoflavodoxin, both in 100 mm potassium pyrophosphate, pH 6.0, were mixed in different ratios. Pseudo-first-order kinetics were obtained by assuring at least a 10-fold excess of apoflavodoxin relative to FMN. The final FMN concentration was 0.10 μm in all cases, except for the two highest protein concentrations (i.e. 10 and 12.5 μm apoflavodoxin) where an FMN concentration of 1.0 μm was used. Binding of FMN to apoflavodoxin was monitored via the accompanying quenching of the FMN fluorescence. The excitation wavelength was 446 nm using an 8-nm slit, and emission was recorded above 475 nm using a cutoff filter. Exponential equations were fitted to the kinetic traces using ProFit (Quantumsoft, Zürich, Switzerland). Denaturant-induced Equilibrium Unfolding of Holoflavodoxin— Three GuHCl-induced equilibrium unfolding experiments were done: one with apoflavodoxin, one with holoflavodoxin, and one with holoflavodoxin in the presence of 100 μm excess FMN. Unfolding was monitored by circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence spectroscopy. Before measurements, all samples were equilibrated for at least 12 h at 25 °C in the dark. The protein concentration was 4.0 μm in all cases. Steady-state far-UV CD measurements were performed on a Jasco J715 spectropolarimeter (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a PTC-348WI peltier temperature control system. The cell chamber was purged with dry nitrogen gas at a flow rate of 5 liters/min. Calibration was performed with a solution of ammonium d10-camphorsulfonate in nanopure water, the concentration (0.06% w/v) of which was checked spectrophotometrically. GuHCl unfolding samples were measured in a 1-mm quartz cuvette (Starna, Hainault, England) at 222 and 255 nm, and the corresponding signal was averaged over 3 min/wavelength at a temperature of 25 °C. The ellipticity at 255 nm was subtracted from the 222 nm ellipticity as a baseline value. Before and after each measurement series, 222 and 255 nm ellipticity values (θ) of a buffer solution (i.e. 100 mm potassium pyrophosphate, pH 6.0) were recorded. The average net buffer ellipticity (i.e. <θ222-θ255>) was subtracted from all sample ellipticities to allow quantitative comparison of ellipticity values that result from different experiments. Tryptophan fluorescence intensity was determined in a 1-ml quartz cuvette (excitation path length 1 cm) using a Cary eclipse fluorimeter equipped with a peltier accessory operating at 25 °C (Varian). Excitation was at 280 nm with a slit of 5 nm; emission was measured for 5 s at 350 nm with a slit of 2.5 nm. In the presence of 100 μm excess FMN, fluorescence emission was recorded using a 0.5-ml quartz cuvette that was positioned with its long side (1-cm length) perpendicular to the excitation beam, resulting in an excitation path length of 2 mm. Unfolding of holoflavodoxin in the absence of excess FMN was also followed by recording the FMN fluorescence at 525 nm with a slit of 2.5 nm for a period of 5 s. A four-state model for equilibrium unfolding (holoflavodoxin ⇔ native apoflavodoxin+FMN ⇔ I1+FMN ⇔ unfolded apoflavodoxin+FMN; see “Results and Discussion”) was fitted globally to the unfolding data of apoflavodoxin, holoflavodoxin, and holoflavodoxin with 100 μm excess FMN using ProFit. Each GuHCl-induced equilibrium unfolding curve as observed by fluorescence or CD spectroscopy is described by Equation 3[Yobs=∑j(αj+βj[D])[j]](Eq. 3) where αj is the molar spectroscopic property of species j in a specific unfolding curve in the absence of denaturant, βj describes the dependence of the molar spectroscopic property on the concentration denaturant, [D]. The observed spectroscopic signal Y (i.e. fluorescence or CD intensity) is the summation of contributions of all components, j (i.e. holoflavodoxin, native apoflavodoxin, I1, and unfolded flavodoxin). The fractional population [j] of species j in a specific unfolding experiment and at a specific denaturant concentration is determined by the global fit of the four-state model described above. The spectroscopic properties of a particular protein species in different experiments are identical. However, the spectroscopic properties detected of a particular species differ slightly between different experiments. This effect is due to the concentration of free FMN that differs between the experiments. For example, FMN absorbs light, and as a result the fluorescence emission of unfolded apoflavodoxin in the presence of FMN in an unfolding experiment is slightly less compared with that of an unfolding experiment in which no FMN is present. As a consequence, the spectroscopic parameters were treated as local parameters in the fitting routine (see below for exceptions). To properly weigh each data point in the global fitting procedure, all unfolding curves were recorded with the same number of data points and each data point was weighted according to the corresponding standard error. Native apoflavodoxin hardly populates in holoflavodoxin unfolding experiments. Consequently, in these holoflavodoxin unfolding experiments the spectroscopic properties of native apoflavodoxin (i.e. the αand β-values in Equation 3) could not be determined. However, the latter spectroscopic parameters could be accurately determined in the apoflavodoxin unfolding experiment. We assumed that these parameters do not depend on the presence of holoflavodoxin or of free FMN. In the global fit of all unfolding data the α-values, as well as the β-values, of native apoflavodoxin were set to be equal. Their fitted values were mainly determined by the apoflavodoxin unfolding experiment. The denaturant concentration dependence of the spectroscopic properties of a specific species (i.e. the β-values in Equation 3) can be determined accurately only when the species populates for 100% over a significant range of denaturant concentrations. However, the equilibrium folding intermediate I1 does not populate for 100%, and thus the denaturant dependence of its CD and fluorescence intensity (i.e. β-values) cannot be determined. Therefore, the β-values of I1 are fixed to 0 (13Bollen Y.J.M. Sa ́nchez I.E. van Mierlo C.P.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10475-10489Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Denaturant Dependence of Holoflavodoxin Folding Kinetics—Folding kinetics of holoflavodoxin were measured by monitoring the FMN binding to folding apoflavodoxin molecules at 25 °C. Unfolded apoflavodoxin in 3.0 m GuHCl and a solution of FMN, both in 100 mm potassium pyrophosphate, pH 6.0, were mixed in a BioLogic SFM-4 stopped-flow machine to a final FMN concentration of 10 μm, a final protein concentration of 1.0 μm, and GuHCl concentrations ranging between 0.3 and 1.2 m. To determine the fluorescence intensity of unbound FMN in this denaturant range, blank experiments were performed without apoflavodoxin. Binding of FMN to apoflavodoxin was monitored via the accompanying quenching of FMN fluorescence. The excitation wavelength was 446 nm using an 8-nm slit and recording emission above 475 nm using a cutoff filter. Kinetic traces were fitted to exponential equations using ProFit. The influence of Xaa-Pro peptide bond isomerization on the observed holoflavodoxin folding kinetics was examined by repeating the experiment described above with freshly unfolded apoflavodoxin, which has all Xaa-Pro peptide bonds in the native trans conformation. This was achieved by using a double-jump stopped-flow experiment in which native apoflavodoxin was first unfolded for a period of 600 ms in 3.0 m GuHCl. The resulting freshly unfolded apoflavodoxin solution was subsequently immediately mixed with 100 mm potassium pyrophosphate, pH 6.0, containing FMN to final concentrations of 10 μm FMN, 1.0 μm apoflavodoxin, and 0.5 m GuHCl. Denaturant Dependence of Holoflavodoxin Unfolding Kinetics—The denaturant dependence of the unfolding kinetics of holoflavodoxin was measured by mixing holoflavodoxin and GuHCl solutions, both in 100 mm potassium pyrophosphate, pH 6.0, in a BioLogic SFM-4 stoppedflow machine to a final protein concentration of 1.0 μm and final GuHCl concentrations that range between 3.5 and 5.7 m. Unfolding of holoflavodoxin was monitored by the release of FMN, which results in a strong increase of the FMN fluorescence intensity. The samples were excited at 446 nm using an 8-nm slit, and emission was recorded above 475 nm using a cutoff filter. Dissociation Constant of the A. vinelandii ApoflavodoxinFMN Complex—The FMN dissociation constant of A. vinelandii holoflavodoxin in 100 mm potassium pyrophosphate at pH 6.0 is determined by a procedure in which aliquots of apoflavodoxin are titrated to an FMN solution (see “Experimental Procedures”). In this procedure, use is made of the quenching of FMN fluorescence upon its binding to apoflavodoxin (19Lostao A. Gomez-Moreno C. Mayhew S.G. Sancho J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14334-14344Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 20Mayhew S.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 235: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The corresponding binding curve is shown in Fig. 2, and the fitted dissociation constant turns out to be (3.4 ± 0.6) 10–10m. This value is identical within error to the reported value of (4.4 ± 0.9) 10–10m for A. vinelandii apoflavodoxin in 50 mm sodium phosphate at pH 7.0 (21Pueyo J.J. Curley G.P. Mayhew S.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 855-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Model Used to Describe Denaturant-induced A. vinelandii Holoflavodoxin Unfolding—The GuHCl-induced equilibrium unfolding of A. vinelandii apoflavodoxin is a three-state process and involves the population of an intermediate as shown in Equation 4[Apo⇄I1⇄U](Eq. 4) with Apo being native apoflavodoxin, I1 the folding intermediate with molten globule-like characteristics (11van Mierlo C.P.M. van Dongen W.M.A.M. Vergeldt F. van Berkel W.J.H. Steensma E. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2331-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 13Bollen Y.J.M. Sa ́nchez I.E. van Mierlo C.P.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10475-10489Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and U the unfolded protein. The kinetic apoflavodoxin folding intermediate I2 (Equation 1) is not incorporated in Equation 4 as it is shown not to populate to a detectable level during denaturant-induced equilibrium unfolding of apoflavodoxin (13Bollen Y.J.M. Sa ́nchez I.E. van Mierlo C.P.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10475-10489Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Consequently, if FMN would only bind to native apoflavodoxin, holoflavodoxin denaturant-induced equilibrium unfolding would be expected to be a four-state process as shown in Equation 5[Holo⇄Apo+FMN⇄I1+FMN⇄U+FMN](Eq. 5) with Holo being holoflavodoxin. Equation 5 involves three equilibrium constants as shown in Equation 6[K1=[Holo]/[Apo][FMN] K2=[Apo]/[I1] K3=[I1]/[U]](Eq. 6) in which K1 is the inverse of the dissociation constant KD of the apoflavodoxin-FMN complex determined above. The denaturant concentration dependence of these equilibrium constants is given by Equation 7[Ki(D)=Ki(0)exp(mi[D]/RT)](Eq. 7) in which [D] represents the denaturant concentration, Ki(0) is the equilibrium constant (i.e. K1, K2, or K3 of Equation 6) in the absence of denaturant, mi is a constant of proportionality that describes the denaturant dependence of the equilibrium constant Ki, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. Each equilibrium constant in Equation 6 is related to a free energy difference ΔG as shown in Equation 8.[ΔGi=−RTln(Ki)=−RTln(Ki(0))−mi[D]](Eq. 8) The concentration of free FMN in solution affects the ratio between apo- and holoflavodoxin concentrations according to Equation 6. Consequently, the apparent stability of holoflavodoxin against unfolding, ΔGappunf, depends on the concentration of free FMN, as is expressed in Equation 9 (22Creighton T.E. Proteins, Stuctures, and Molecular Properties. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1993: 338-340Google Scholar)[ΔGunfapp=ΔGapo−RTln(1+[FMN]KD)](Eq. 9) in which ΔGapo is the global stability of native apoflavodoxin. Upon denaturant-induced unfolding of a fraction of the holoflavodoxin molecules, FMN is released and this affects the apparent stability of the remaining holoflavodoxin molecules according to Equation 9. Ignoring the latter phenomenon in the analysis of equilibrium unfolding data of a ligand-binding protein will result in wrong stability values. Denaturant-induced Unfolding Shows That A. vinelandii Holoflavodoxin Unfolds according to a Four-state Process— Because holoflavodoxin equilibrium unfolding is expected to be a four-state process (Equation 5), it is not likely that the stabilities and corresponding m-values of all the species involved can be extracted from a single equilibrium unfolding experiment. To determine these parameters, unfolding curves of apoflavodoxin, holoflavodoxin, and holoflavodoxin with 100 μm FMN (i.e. a 25-fold excess of FMN relative to holoflavodoxin) were determined. This excess of FMN ensures a virtually constant FMN concentration during denaturant-induced holoflavodoxin unfolding and contributes 7.43 kcal/mol to the holoflavodoxin stability in the absence of denaturant (Equation 9). The GuHCl-induced equilibrium unfolding data were obtained by using tryptophan fluorescence (Fig. 3, A and B), FMN fluorescence (Fig. 3C), and CD spectroscopy (Fig. 3D). All unfolding curves were analyzed globally employing the four-state unfolding model discussed (Equation 5; also see “Experimental Procedures”). The dissociation constant (K1)–1 (Equation 6) is fixed at zero molar denaturant to 3.4 10–10m as determined above. In the case of holoflavodoxin unfolding without excess FMN, the free FMN concentration is set to equal the total protein concentration (i.e. 4 μm) minus the actual concentration of holoflavodoxin. In case of holoflavodoxin unfolding with excess FMN, the free FMN concentration is fixed to 100 μm. In our analysis both unfolded flavodoxin and the flavodoxin folding intermediate I1 did not interact to a significant extent with FMN as is experimentally supported below. Thus, the stabilities of native apoflavodoxin and of its folding intermediate I1, both relative to unfolded apoflavodoxin, do not change between the three flavodoxin equilibrium unfolding experiments. Identical fluorimeter settings are used to record the unfolding curves of apoflavodoxin and of holoflavodoxin without excess FMN. These settings need to be altered in case of holoflavodoxin unfolding with excess FMN because of the high optical density of FMN at 280 nm. Therefore, the fluorescence intensity values of holoflavodoxin with excess FMN cannot be directly compared with those of apoflavodoxin and holoflavodoxin in Fig. 3A. All four flavodoxin unfolding curves determined by fluorescence spectroscopy are well described by the four-state unfolding model (Equation 5) as the global fit results show (Fig. 3, A–C). Native holoflavodoxin without excess FMN is less fluorescent than native apoflavodoxin (Fig. 3A) as the tryptophan fluorescence in holoflavodoxin is quenched due to the bound FMN molecule. Upon unfolding of apo- and holoflavodoxin, virtually identical fluorescence intensity values at 350 nm were obtained (Fig. 3, A and B). The"

Because dynamic cellular asymmetries such as those seen in cell migration critically depend on a cooperation between the microtubule and actin cytoskeletal filament systems, we investigated whether Dcx, a microtubule-associated protein, is engaged in cytoskeletal cross-talk. We now demonstrate that Dcx co-sediments with actin filaments (F-actin), and using light and electron microscopy and spin down assays, we show that Dcx induces bundling and cross-linking of microtubules and F-actin in vitro. It has recently been shown that binding of Dcx to microtubules is negatively regulated by phosphorylation of the Dcx at Ser-47 or Ser-297. Although the phosphomimetic green fluorescent protein (GFP)-DcxS47E transfected into COS-7 cells had a reduced affinity for microtubules, we found that pseudophosphorylation was not sufficient to cause Dcx to bind to F-actin. When cells were co-transfected with neurabin II, a protein that binds F-actin as well as Dcx, GFP-Dcx and to an even greater extent GFP-DcxS47E became predominantly associated with filamentous actin. Thus Dcx phosphorylation and neurabin II combinatorially enhance Dcx binding to F-actin.

Both microtubule and actin filament networks were classically thought to fulfill distinct mechanical cellular functions such as bipolar spindle formation for microtubules and muscle contraction for actin filaments. However, a number of proteins have been discovered that mediate interactions between microtubules and actin filaments occurring in processes in which dynamic cellular asymmetries are established and maintained, including cell migration, growth cone guidance, cell division, and wound healing (1Rodriguez O.C.

The cytoskeleton of neurons receives increasing attention as a model system to study regulatory and structural interactions between microtubules and actin filaments, because neurons have a unique morphology and migrate during development. Several human neuronal diseases are the result of neuronal migration defects.

Krowarsch D. Feng Y. Devedjiev Y. Dauter Z. Walsh C.A. Otlewski J. Bushweller J.H. Derewenda Z.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).

Recent cryo-electron microscopic studies have shown that DCX binds between the protofilaments from which microtubules are built and such a location of DCX binding sites is ideal for microtubule stabilization (12Moores C.A.

Of particular importance for the present study is the observation that the binding of Dcx to microtubules is negatively regulated by phosphorylation of serine residues 47 and 297, which are phosphorylated by protein kinase A, MAP 1The abbreviations used are: MAP, microtubule-associated protein; RT, room temperature; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate./microtubule affinity regulatory kinase, and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) (13Schaar B.T.

Dcx does not bind to all microtubules of a migrating neuron but is highly enriched in the leading process and in the growth cones of differentiating neurons (9Francis F. Koulakoff A. Boucher D.

Cortex. 2003; 13: 620-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Localized Dcx binding to microtubules is regulated by site-specific phosphorylation by kinases that are present in these regions (13Schaar B.T. Kinoshita K. McConnell S.K. Neuron. 2004; 41: 203-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). It has recently been found that Dcx phosphorylated by c-Jun N-terminal kinase is concentrated in the actin-rich region of growth cones (15Gdalyahu A. Ghosh I. Levy T. Sapir T. Sapoznik S. Fishler Y. Azoulai D. Reiner O. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In addition to phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, other regulatory mechanisms mediating DCX function can be envisaged. For example, we have shown that the F-actin-binding protein neurabin II (also known as spinophilin) interacts with Dcx (18Tsukada M. Prokscha A. Oldekamp J. Eichele G. Mech. Dev. 2003; 120: 1033-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) raising the possibility that a Dcx-neurabin II protein complex could bridge microtubules and actin filaments. This would be reminiscent of the microtubule actin cross-linking factor, a member of the plakin protein family (19Leung C.L. Sun D. Zheng M. Knowles D.R. Liem R.K.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1275-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 20Sun D. Leung C.L. Liem R.K.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 114: 161-172Google Scholar, 21Leung C.L. Green K.J. Liem R.K.H. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 37-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). We have embarked on in vitro binding studies to investigate the idea that neurabin II and Dcx cooperate to link microtubules and actin filaments and thereby contribute to neuronal migration. Sedimentation assays unexpectedly revealed that Dcx binds to F-actin. Fluorescence and electron microscopy was used to demonstrate that Dcx bundles and cross-links microtubules and actin filaments. Using transient transfection assays in mammalian cells, we studied the regulation of Dcx binding to F-actin. We found that pseudophosphorylation mutant DcxS47E not only exhibited reduced binding to microtubules but in the presence of neurabin II, showed a marked increase of binding to F-actin. Taken together, our studies suggest that Dcx is both a microtubule- and F-actin-associated protein, that Dcx promotes association between the two cytoskeletons in vitro, and that the distribution of Dcx between microtubules and F-actin can be regulated by neurabin II in Dcx-phosphorylation-dependent manner. DNA Constructs and Recombinant Protein—The Dcx coding region was subcloned into pEGFP-C3 (Clontech) and pQE31 (Qiagen). PCR was utilized to isolate full-length neurabin II from mouse cDNA and was cloned into pCMV-Tag 2A. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Stratagene QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit. Recombinant His-Dcx was expressed in Escherichia coli XL1-Blue and purified with nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen). Standard buffer conditions were used for purification of His-Dcx except that purified proteins were eluted in PEM buffer (80 mm Na-PIPES, pH 6.9, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) containing 250 mm imidazole or in general actin buffer (5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm CaCl2) containing 250 mm imidazole. Proteins were stored at 4 °C, and the concentration of purified His-Dcx was determined using a Bradford protein assay (Ref. 22Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar, Bio-Rad). In Vitro Co-sedimentation Assays—F-actin co-sedimentation assays were performed with the non-muscle actin-binding protein spin-down biochem kit (Cytoskeleton, Inc.). For this, His-Dcx eluted from nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads in general actin buffer containing 250 mm imidazole was used. The protein solution was adjusted to 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100 and was centrifuged for 1 h at 150,000 × g at 4 °C to remove aggregated protein. An aliquot of the supernatant was incubated with 0.4 mg/ml F-actin for 30 min at room temperature (RT). After centrifugation for 90 min at 150,000 × g at RT, supernatant and pellet fractions were separated and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by protein staining with Coomassie Blue. To measure the binding affinity of Dcx for actin, a constant amount of actin filaments (2.1 μm) was incubated with various amounts of Dcx (0.2–8 μm) in a co-sedimentation assay. Coomassie Blue-stained gels were digitally photographed (Nikon Coolpix 995), and bands were quantified using NIH Image software. Low Speed Pelleting Assays—Various amounts of His-Dcx eluted in general actin buffer containing 250 mm imidazole were added to preassembled actin filaments (4.2 μm) in 50-μl reaction mixtures that were then incubated for 20 min at RT. After centrifugation for 3 min at 13,000 × g at RT, the supernatant and pellet were separated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and protein was detected by Coomassie Blue staining. Under these centrifugation conditions, actin filaments remain in the supernatant, whereas F-actin bundles are found in the pellet (23Goode B.L. Wong J.J. Butty A.-C. Peter M. McCormack A.L. Yates J.R. Drubin D.G. Barnes G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 83-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). For F-actin and microtubule low speed pelleting assays, polymerized actin (4.2 μm) and/or taxol-stabilized microtubules (4.7 μm) were incubated with His-Dcx for 20 min at RT in 50-μl reaction mixtures (in PEM containing 1 mm ATP, 1 mm GTP, and 20 μm taxol). After centrifugation for 3 min at 2000 × g at RT, the supernatant and pellet were separated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Actin bundles remained in the supernatant under these centrifugation conditions, whereas microtubule bundles were found in the pellet. Actin/Microtubule Polymerization/Bundling Assays—10 μg of rhodamine non-muscle actin (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) was thawed and reconstituted in 20 μl of general actin buffer (5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm CaCl2) by incubation for 30 min on ice. 0.1 volume of actin polymerization buffer (500 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP) was added to the monomeric actin and incubated for 1 h at RT. This yielded an F-actin stock solution of 11.5 μm. Microtubules were prepared by polymerizing fluorescein-labeled tubulin (Cytoskeleton, Inc.). 20 μg of fluorescein-labeled tubulin was thawed and reconstituted in 12 μl of general tubulin buffer (PEM buffer plus 1 mm GTP and 5% glycerol) by incubating for 2–3 min at 37 °C. The addition of 1 μl of Me2SO and incubation for additional 20–30 min at 37 °C induced microtubule polymerization. The addition of 2.3 μl of 200 μm taxol yielded stable microtubules equivalent to a 23.5 μm tubulin monomer. Microtubules and actin filaments were examined by fluorescence microscopy after 1/50 dilution in either PEM containing 1 mm GTP and 20 μm taxol for microtubules or in general actin buffer for actin filaments. Bundling assays were carried out by mixing polymerized actin and/or taxol-stabilized microtubules and His-Dcx for 2–10 min at RT. For co-incubation of microtubules and F-actin, both filaments were diluted in PEM containing 1 mm GTP and 20 μm taxol. The samples were spotted on a slide and examined under the Leica DMR fluorescence microscope. Electron Microscopy—Samples were prepared as described for actin/microtubule polymerization/bundling assays except that native tubulin and actin (from bovine brain and human platelet non-muscle) were used. A 1/20 dilution of sample solution yielded a final concentration of 575 nm for actin monomer, 1175 nm for tubulin monomer, and 1500 nm for His-Dcx. The samples were adsorbed to carbon film and then negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate. The carbon films were applied to grids and examined using a Philips 301 electron microscope. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 cells (ECACC, UK) were cultured under standard condition as described by Sweeney et al. (24Sweeney K.J. Prokscha A. Eichele G. Mech. Dev. 2001; 101: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For transient co-transfection, 25,000 cells were plated on glass coverslips (12-mm diameter, Marienfeld) in 4-well culture dishes (NUNC). On the next day, the cells were transfected with Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and incubated at 37 °C for 1 day prior to immunofluorescence analysis. Immunofluorescence Staining and Quantitative Image Analysis— Immunofluorescence staining of cells on the coverslips was carried out as described by Rivas and Hatten (25Rivas R.J. Hatten M.E. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 981-989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A guinea pig polyclonal anti-Dcx antibody (Chemicon International) was used at 1:100 dilution. A mouse monoclonal anti-tubulin antibody (Sigma) was used at 1:1000 dilution. Neurabin II was detected with a mouse monoclonal anti-neurabin II antibody at 1:1 dilution. Specimens were examined with a ZEISS Axiovert 200M fluorescence microscope. Images in Fig. 4C were collected using a Axiovision deconvolution imaging system. To quantify Dcx binding to microtubules, the pixel intensity of Dcx signals in GFP-Dcxtransfected cells was determined using the Linescan feature in Meta-Morph image software. The peak intensity of Dcx fluorescence in a small area defined by transecting lines passing through microtubules was determined (see Fig. 4B illustration). 14 cells expressing GFP-DcxWT and 13 cells expressing GFP-DcxS47E were chosen for this measurement, and cells were selected that had similar overall fluorescence intensity. Each cell contained on average 10 Dcx signal peaks. The mean value of average pixel intensities for 14 (or 13) cells was evaluated statistically by the two-sided Student's t test. The mean difference can be considered to be significant when p < 0.05. Dcx Binds to and Bundles Actin Filaments—To investigate interactions of Dcx with the cytoskeleton, we first asked whether Dcx directly binds to F-actin. Co-sedimentation assays with purified His-tagged Dcx (Fig. 1A) and actin filaments showed that Dcx co-sedimented with F-actin (Fig. 1B). To determine the stoichiometry of binding at saturation, we incubated a constant amount of actin filaments (2.1 μm) with increasing amounts of Dcx (0.2–8 μm) in a co-sedimentation assay. The molar ratio at saturation between Dcx and the actin monomer was close to 1 (data not shown), and the Kd value was ∼400 nm. Next, we have carried out in vitro actin/microtubule bundling assays by fluorescence microscopy to explore the effect of Dcx on fluorochrome-labeled microtubules and F-actin. When purified His-tagged Dcx (Fig. 1A) was added to preassembled microtubules (the final concentration was 470 nm), Dcx induced, within minutes, the formation of long microtubule bundles (Fig. 1C, +Dcx 600 nm), consistent with previous reports (6Sapir T. Horesh D. Caspi M. Atlas R. Burgess H.A. Wolf S.G. Francis F. Chelly J. Elbaum M. Pietrokovski S. Reiner O. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9 (Correction (2000) Hum. Mol. Genet. 9, 1461): 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 10Gleeson J.G. Lin P.T. Flanagan L.A. Walsh C.A. Neuron. 1999; 23: 257-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar, 11Horesh D. Sapir T. Francis F. Wolf S.G. Caspi M. Elbaum M. Chelly J. Reiner O. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1599-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, Dcx was also capable of bundling actin filaments (final actin concentration was 230 nm, Fig. 1C). Actin filaments were significantly longer and brighter than in the absence of Dcx even when the Dcx concentration was as low as 60 nm (Fig. 1C). When BSA at a concentration of 1 μm was added to either type of filament, no bundling activity was observed (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these results suggest that Dcx binds to F-actin and assembles it into bundles. This conclusion is further supported by a low speed pelleting assay (23Goode B.L. Wong J.J. Butty A.-C. Peter M. McCormack A.L. Yates J.R. Drubin D.G. Barnes G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 83-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and an ultrastructural analysis by electron microscopy. In the case of the low speed pelleting assay, various amounts of Dcx were added to preassembled actin filaments (4.2 μm). Neither F-actin (Fig. 2A) nor Dcx alone (data not shown) pelleted after centrifugation at 13,000 × g. However, addition of increasing amounts of Dcx increased the amount of F-actin present in the pellet (Fig. 2A). This titration experiment further supports the possibility that Dcx assembles F-actin into bundles, which sediment at a low g force. For ultrastructural analysis, purified actin was polymerized and recombinant His-Dcx was added. An aliquot of the incubation mixture was negatively stained with uranyl acetate and viewed under the electron microscope. We observed that adding Dcx to F-actin induced the formation of long actin filament bundles (Fig. 2B), which are likely to correspond to the bundles seen by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1C). Of note, Dcx also bundled microtubules (Fig. 2B, right panels, 10 and 11). Dcx Cross-links Actin and Microtubules—The finding that the microtubule-associated protein Dcx binds to and assembles actin filaments into bundles raises the possibility that Dcx is capable of cross-linking microtubules and F-actin. When Dcx was added to a mixture of F-actin and microtubules, F-actin bundles co-localized with microtubule bundles (Fig. 3A, +Dcx 600 nm). The addition of bovine serum albumin induced neither bundling of filaments nor co-localization of the filaments. Purified α-actinin, a well characterized actin-bundling protein (26Blanchard A. Ohanian V. Critchley D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1989; 10: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), induced the formation of actin filaments aggregates, but there was, as expected, no bundling of microtubules. Next, we examined the structure of the Dcx-F-actin-microtubule complexes at the ultrastructural level using electron microscopy. In the absence of Dcx, microtubules and actin filaments appeared as individual filaments, which did not interact with each other (Fig. 3B). However, in the presence of Dcx, microtubule bundles were formed and actin filaments were often seen in close proximity to these bundles (Fig. 3B, arrows). It is likely that these large bundles contain microtubules and actin filaments, i.e. Dcx cross-links microtubules and F-actin, because individual microtubules and actin filaments were depleted from the area surrounding the large bundles. To further investigate this possibility, the molar ratio of actin to tubulin was changed from 1:2 to 2:1, 6:1, and 18:1, respectively, so that an excess amount of F-actin was present in the reaction mixture. The concentration of Dcx was kept constant. As is clearly shown in Fig. 3C with a molar ratio of 18:1, single microtubules were decorated with numerous actin filaments. This suggests that Dcx cross-links actin filaments and microtubules. The effects of Dcx on F-actin and microtubules were further analyzed by low speed pelleting assays. After incubating F-actin and/or microtubules with or without Dcx, the reaction mixtures were centrifuged for 3 min at 2000 × g. Under this centrifugation condition, small amounts of sedimented tubulin were observed in reactions that contained microtubules alone or microtubules and F-actin (Fig. 3D, lanes 2 and 10). Dcx-induced microtubule bundles are heavier than single microtubules and were thus abundant in the pellet fraction (Fig. 3D, lane 4). As expected, neither F-actin alone nor Dcx-induced F-actin bundles sedimented at this speed (Fig. 3D, lanes 6 and 8). However, in the presence of Dcx, massive amounts of actin filaments and microtubules co-sedimented (Fig. 3D, lane 12), which is consistent with the structure of the Dcx-F-actin-microtubule complexes observed by microscopy (Fig. 3A–C). Taken together, experiments using a broad spectrum of in vitro methods all support the notion that Dcx can interact with F-actin and, furthermore, cross-links microtubules and F-actin. GFP-DcxS47E Associates with F-actin in the Presence of Neurabin II in COS-7 Cells—We next investigated whether the interaction between Dcx and F-actin can be demonstrated in mammalian cells. Cultured murine hippocampal neurons highly expressed Dcx with Dcx staining being most prominent in close proximity to F-actin especially in the actin-rich growth cones (9Francis F. Koulakoff A. Boucher D. Chafey P. Schaar B. Vinet M.-C. Friocourt G. McDonnell N. Reiner O. Kahn A. McConnell S.K. Berwald-Netter Y. Denoulet P. Chelly J.

Cortex. 2003; 13: 620-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Thus in the distal portion of neurites Dcx has the opportunity to directly interact with F-actin. Others have shown that the interaction of microtubules and Dcx is negatively regulated by phosphorylation of serines 47 and/or 297 (see Introduction). We examined whether phosphorylation of Dcx would affect binding of Dcx to F-actin. Hence we generated pseudophosphorylation mutations by introducing a glutamic acid residue (E) at serine 47 or serine 297 in a GFP-tagged Dcx fusion protein. COS-7 cells were transfected either with GFP-Dcx, GFP-DcxS47E, or GFP-DcxS297E. On the next day, cells were fixed and stained for tubulin whose distribution was compared with that of wild-type or mutant GFP-Dcx. Fig. 4A, 1–3, shows that GFP-Dcx co-localized with microtubules, as had previously been reported (11Horesh D. Sapir T. Francis F. Wolf S.G. Caspi M. Elbaum M. Chelly J. Reiner O. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1599-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), but there was no co-localization with actin filaments (Fig. 4A, 4–6). Cells transfected with GFP-DcxS47E (Fig. 4A, 7–9) often showed a quantitative reduction of microtubule localization of GFP-DcxS47E (compare Fig. 4A, 1 and 3 with 7 and 9). This is consistent with previous reports that demonstrate this effect for DcxS297D (14Tanaka T. Serneo F.F. Tseng H-C. Kulkarni A.B. Tsai L-H. Gleeson J.G. Neuron. 2004; 41: 215-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Importantly, GFP-DcxS47E does not co-localize with actin that is revealed by phalloidin staining (Fig. 4A, 10–12). To quantify difference in microtubule binding between GFP-DcxWT and GFP-DcxS47E, we have compared average pixel intensities associated with microtubule in cells transfected with GFP-DcxWT or GFP-DcxS47E. As illustrated in Fig. 4B (right), we have determined the peak intensity of Dcx fluorescence in a small area defined by transecting lines passing through microtubules (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in the histogram of Fig. 4B, the average pixel intensity of DcxWT (left, black bar) was significantly higher than that of DcxS47E (right, black bar). By contrast, there was no significant difference in background signal intensity between the two proteins (white bars). Thus the visual impression of a signal reduction as a result of pseudophosphorylation of Dcx is confirmed by a more quantitative analysis. This and previous studies (13Schaar B.T. Kinoshita K. McConnell S.K. Neuron. 2004; 41: 203-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 14Tanaka T. Serneo F.F. Tseng H-C. Kulkarni A.B. Tsai L-H. Gleeson J.G. Neuron. 2004; 41: 215-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) indicate that phosphorylation negatively regulates Dcx binding to microtubules, but evidently it does not result in actin binding. One possibility is that for Dcx to bind to actin in a cell requires an additional protein. We have previously shown that neurabin II, an F-actin-binding protein (27Satoh A. Nakanishi H. Obaishi H. Wada M. Takahashi K. Satoh K. Hirao K. Nishioka H. Hata Y. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3470-3475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), also interacts with Dcx (18Tsukada M. Prokscha A. Oldekamp J. Eichele G. Mech. Dev. 2003; 120: 1033-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This prompted us to examine whether neurabin II regulates the affinity of Dcx to microtubules. We first co-transfected cells with GFP-Dcx and FLAG-neurabin II and found that GFP-Dcx (Fig. 4C, 1) partially co-localized with neurabin II (Fig. 4C, 2, superimposed image is shown in 3) and thus with actin filaments (Fig. 4C, 4–6). In addition, we also observed in some cells co-localization of GFP-Dcx with whirls of microtubules (Fig. 4C, 7–9). Thus in the presence of neurabin II, Dcx is to some extent associated with F-actin. Next, we co-transfected cells with pseudophosphorylated GFP-DcxS47E and FLAG-neurabin II and found a strong co-localization of GFP-DcxS47E and F-actin-associated FLAG-neurabin II (Fig. 4C 10–12). Consistent with these data, GFP-DcxS47E showed actin-like distribution (Fig. 4C, 13–15). The overlap of GFP-DcxS47E fluorescence and actin signal was more striking than that seen with GFP-DcxWT and actin (Fig. 4C, compare 6 with 15). In addition, we observed almost no co-localization of GFP-DcxS47E and microtubules (Fig. 4C, 16–18). The GFP-DcxS297E mutation also preferentially associated with F-actin in presence of neurabin II (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that Dcx can associate not only with microtubules but also with F-actin. From previous work it is known that binding of Dcx to microtubules is negatively regulated by phosphorylation (13Schaar B.T. Kinoshita K. McConnell S.K. Neuron. 2004; 41: 203-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 14Tanaka T. Serneo F.F. Tseng H-C. Kulkarni A.B. Tsai L-H. Gleeson J.G. Neuron. 2004; 41: 215-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Here we have extended this observation by showing that neurabin II drives pseudophosphorylated Dcx into a complex with F-actin. Recent studies have shown that microtubules and actin cytoskeleton interact with each other to orchestrate cell migration and growth cone movement in neurons (28Salmon W.C. Adams M.C. Waterman-Storer C.M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 29Schaefer A.W. Kabir N. Forscher P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Several types of proteins have been isolated that mediate structural interactions between microtubules and actin (1Rodriguez O.C. Schaefer A.W. Mandato C.A. Forscher P. Bement W.M. Waterman-Storer C.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed for the first time that the microtubule-associated protein Dcx can bind to and bundle F-actin and moreover cross-links microtubules with F-actin. Current models of the mechanism of action of DCX are based on its interaction with microtubules and with other DCX-interacting proteins. Interaction of DCX with μ1A subunit of the AP-1 adaptor complex involved in clathrin-dependent protein sorting suggests a role for DCX in protein transport in migrating neurons (16Friocourt G. Chafey P. Billuart P. Koulakoff A. Vinet M.-C. Schaar B.T. McConnell S.K. Francis F. Chelly J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 18: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). DCX associated with phospho-FIGQY in the cytoplasmic domain of neurofascin, a human L1 cell-adhesion molecule could function as an adaptor between neurofascin and microtubules (30Kizhatil K. Wu Y.-X. Sen A. Bennett V. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7498-7598Crossref Google Scholar). Of particular relevance for the present study is the notion that DCX stabilizes and bundles microtubules in the leading process of migrating neurons and promotes microtubule growth (8Kim M.H. Cierpicki T. Derewenda U. Krowarsch D. Feng Y. Devedjiev Y. Dauter Z. Walsh C.A. Otlewski J. Bushweller J.H. Derewenda Z.S. Nat. Struct.

Dcx as an F-actin-binding and -bundling protein sheds light on novel functions of Dcx. Recent studies have shown that in the cell body of migrating cells microtubules preferentially cross-link to and grow along focal adhesion-associated actin bundles (28Salmon W.C. Adams M.C. Waterman-Storer C.M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and that in neuronal growth cones filopodial F-actin bundles guide the assembly and transport of microtubules (29Schaefer A.W. Kabir N. Forscher P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Dynamic unbundled microtubules polymerize into the periphery along filopodia in the direction of growth cone extension (29Schaefer A.W. Kabir N. Forscher P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In the distal portion of neurites where Dcx is prominently localized, Dcx could promote microtubule growth into the actin-rich periphery by cross-linking to and growing along F-actin bundles. Our ultrastructural analysis of the Dcx/F-actin/microtubule complexes showed that microtubules bind to F-actin in parallel, which is consistent with the finding that microtubules grow along F-actin bundles. Using transient transfection in mammalian cells, we have shown that pseudophosphorylation mutant DcxS47E reduces the binding of Dcx to microtubules and, in addition, increases binding to F-actin in the presence of neurabin II. Neurabin II, a previously isolated Dcx-binding protein (18Tsukada M. Prokscha A. Oldekamp J. Eichele G. Mech. Dev. 2003; 120: 1033-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) that also binds to F-actin (27Satoh A. Nakanishi H. Obaishi H. Wada M. Takahashi K. Satoh K. Hirao K. Nishioka H. Hata Y. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3470-3475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) could thus localize Dcx in close proximity of F-actin and enhance the binding of phosphorylated Dcx to F-actin. Dcx and neurabin II are strongly co-expressed in many regions of the developing brain including those containing migrating neurons and in the neurites of primary cultures of hippocampal neurons (18Tsukada M. Prokscha A. Oldekamp J. Eichele G. Mech. Dev. 2003; 120: 1033-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, the distribution of Dcx between microtubules and F-actin could be regulated by site-specific phosphorylation and neurabin II in migrating neurons of the developing cortex. The ability of Dcx 1) to bind to and bundle F-actin and 2) to shuttle between microtubules and actin is reminiscent of MAP2c and MAP1B, two other neuron-specific microtubule-associated proteins. Microtubule binding of MAP2c is repressed by phosphorylation and MAP2c is found to be associated with the actin cytoskeleton after phosphorylation (32Ozer R.S. Halpain S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3573-3587Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The fact that MAP2c is released from microtubules by phosphorylation (32Ozer R.S. Halpain S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3573-3587Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) correlates well with the recent finding that binding of Dcx to microtubules is negatively regulated by phosphorylation of serine residues 47 and 297, a reaction mediated by protein kinase A, MAP/microtubule affinity regulatory kinase, and Cdk5 (13Schaar B.T. Kinoshita K. McConnell S.K. Neuron. 2004; 41: 203-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 14Tanaka T. Serneo F.F. Tseng H-C. Kulkarni A.B. Tsai L-H. Gleeson J.G. Neuron. 2004; 41: 215-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Our data now suggest an additional regulatory mechanism through neurabin II. Many intracellular signaling pathways are activated by guidance cues and induce cytoskeletal reorganization in growth cones and leading processes (33Gordon-Weeks P.R. J. Neurobiol. 2004; 58: 70-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 34Wong K. Park H.T. Wu J.Y. Rao Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This cytoskeletal dynamic is essential for growth cone turning during pathfinding and for deciding in which direction a cell migrates (33Gordon-Weeks P.R. J. Neurobiol. 2004; 58: 70-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 34Wong K. Park H.T. Wu J.Y. Rao Y. Curr. Opin. Genet.

The existence of multiple regulatory mechanisms such as phosphorylation by several different kinases (13Schaar B.T. Kinoshita K. McConnell S.K. Neuron. 2004; 41: 203-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 14Tanaka T. Serneo F.F. Tseng H-C. Kulkarni A.B. Tsai L-H. Gleeson J.G.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and neurabin II would contribute to the ability of Dcx to respond to a wide range of guidance cues during cortical development. Although it remains to be demonstrated that Dcx shuttles between microtubules and F-actin in growth cones and leading processes of living neurons, our in vitro and transient transfection data reveal Dcx as a promising candidate to play a major role in a cross-talk between the two types of cytoskeleton. It should be emphasized that serine residue 47 is not only critical for phosphoregulation (13Schaar B.T. Kinoshita K. McConnell S.K. Neuron. 2004; 41: 203-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and for regulation through neurabin II but when mutated to arginine causes X-linked lissencephaly (3Gleeson J.G.

Cell. 1998; 92: 63-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). This fact strongly suggests that the disturbance of a regulated cross-talk between the microtubules and the actin cytoskeleton is causative to this disease.

We previously identified DGKθ as one of nine mammalian DGK isoforms and reported on its regulation by interaction with RhoA and by translocation to the plasma membrane in response to noradrenaline. Here, we have investigated how the localization of DGKθ, fused to green fluorescent protein, is controlled upon activation of G protein-coupled receptors in A431 cells. Extracellular ATP, bradykinin, or thrombin induced DGKθ translocation from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane within 2–6 min. This translocation, independent of DGK activity, was preceded by protein kinase C (PKC) translocation and was blocked by PKC inhibitors. Conversely, activation of PKC by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate induced DGKθ translocation. Membrane-permeable DAG (dioctanoylglycerol) also induced DGKθ translocation but in a PKC (staurosporin)-independent fashion. Mutations in the cysteine-rich domains of DGKθ abrogated its hormone- and DAG-induced translocation, suggesting that these domains are essential for DAG binding and DGKθ recruitment to the membrane. We show that DGKθ interacts selectively with and is phosphorylated by PKCϵ and -η and that peptide agonist-induced selective activation of PKCϵ directly leads to DGKθ translocation. Our data are consistent with the concept that hormone-induced PKC activation regulates the intracellular localization of DGKθ, which may be important in the negative regulation of PKCϵ and/or PKCη activity.

Science. 2001; 294: 1942-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar), although it is not always clear whether the PA in these pathways is generated by DGK or phospholipase D. Nine mammalian DGK isotypes have been identified and are classified into five subtypes according to their distinct structural features (reviewed in Refs. 1van Blitterswijk W.J. Houssa B. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 2Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol.

Sakane F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Their structural diversity together with their different tissue/cell distribution and subcellular localization, suggests that each DGK isoform may regulate distinct DAG signaling events. We previously identified the type V isotype, DGKθ, which contains three (instead of two) cysteine-rich domains (CRDs; potential DAG binding sites), a proline-rich region, and a pleckstrin homology domain with an overlapping Ras-associating domain (28Houssa B. Schaap D. van der Wal J. Goto K. Kondo H. Yamakawa A. Shibata M. Takenawa T. van Blitterswijk W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10422-10428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). DGKθ is a cytosolic protein, whose activity is regulated negatively by interaction with RhoA (29Houssa B. de Widt J. Kranenburg O. Moolenaar W.H. van Blitterswijk W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6820-6822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and positively by translocation to the nucleus in response to thrombin stimulation in IIC9 cells (30Bregoli L. Baldassare J.J. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23288-23295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and to the plasma membrane in response to noradrenaline in rat mesenteric small arteries (31Walker A.J. Draeger A. Houssa B. van Blitterswijk W.J. Ohanian V. Ohanian J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The molecular details leading to DGKθ translocation following receptor activation have not been elucidated; however, two possible mechanisms could be suggested. First, similar to PKC, DAG, generated by PLC in the plasma membrane or the nucleus, may potentially recruit DGK through binding to its CRDs (32Houssa B. van Blitterswijk W.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 677-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Indeed, the CRDs of DGKγ and possibly DGKβ interact with the DAG substitute, phorbol ester (12-O-tetradec-anoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)) (33Shindo M. Irie K. Ohigashi H. Kuriyama M. Saito N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 34Shindo M. Irie K. Masuda A. Ohigashi H. Shirai Y. Miyasaka K. Saito N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18448-18454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an undefined DGK activity translocated to artificially enhanced DAG in membranes of some cell systems (reviewed in Ref. 1van Blitterswijk W.J. Houssa B. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Second, receptor-stimulated activation of PKC and/or other protein kinases may, directly or indirectly, modulate the phosphorylation status of DGKθ, thereby changing its conformation and so controlling its translocation and/or activation (1van Blitterswijk W.J. Houssa B. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). DGK isotypes are phosphorylated in vivo by PKC (35Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M.

Activation of DGK by PKC would represent the induction of a negative feedback loop for PKC (7Luo B. Prescott S.M. Topham M.K. J.

Prescott S.M. Topham M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39542-39547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Nothing is known, in this respect, about the DGKθ isotype. We have used confocal microscopy and live imaging of A431 cells to study the intracellular localization and agonist-induced plasma membrane translocation of GFP-tagged DGKθ. In the same A431 cells and using the same agonists, we have also studied the kinetics of translocation of the five isoforms of PKC (α, β2, δ, ϵ, and η) present in these cells. In response to a variety of stimuli, all PKCs translocated to the plasma membrane, but they did so with very different kinetics. We provide evidence, in vitro and in vivo, for a major role for PKCϵ and/or PKCη activation in the regulation of DGKθ translocation to the plasma membrane. Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Geneticin (G418) were from Invitrogen. [γ-32P]ATP was from Amersham Biosciences. Ro31-8220, H-89, wortmannin, and LY294002 were from Calbiochem. DNA ladder (1 kbp) was from Invitrogen. Human recombinant PKC isotypes and all other chemicals, including TPA, 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol (DiC8), dioleoylglycerol, phosphatidylserine, deoxycholate, staurosporine, forskolin, 8-bromo-cAMP, bradykinin, thrombin, adenosine, and the nucleotides ATP, ADP, UTP, and UDP were obtained from Sigma. Cell Culture—COS-7 and A431 cells were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 units/ml), and 2 mm l-glutamine (complete medium). For experiments, cells (2 × 105) were plated in 60-mm dishes. After 24 h, exponentially growing cells were transfected with cDNA constructs using Fugene (Roche Applied Science) and analyzed 24–48 h after transfection. Transfected A431 cells were selected in complete medium containing the neomycin analogue G418 at a concentration of 250 μg/ml. Cells were used for analysis 2–4 weeks after selection. cDNA Constructs—Fusion proteins between GFP and DGKθ were generated by using appropriate primers and subcloning the amplified DNA into the EcoRI site of the pEGFP-N3 eukaryotic expression vector (Clontech). Human PKCα, -δ, and -ϵ were inserted into the Kpn-1 of pEGFP-N3, whereas PKCβ2 and -η cDNA were inserted into the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites, respectively. Full-length cDNAs of human PKCα, -β2, and -δ isoforms were kindly provided by Stephen M. Prescott (Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT), human PKCϵ and -η were provided by Peter J.

For construction of the GFP tag at the N terminus, DGKθ or DGKα cDNAs were subcloned in the EcoRI or KpnI restriction site of pEGFP-C2 (Clontech), respectively.

Amplified PCR sequences and the correct orientation of the constructs were verified by sequencing and restriction endonuclease mapping. Site-directed mutagenesis of DGKθ in the fifth Cys of each of the three cysteine-rich domains (CRD1, -2, and -3) was performed with the mutagenesis kit from Stratagene using the following primers with DGKθ-GFP in pEGFP-N3 as template: for CRD1(C99G), sense (5′-ATG TCT CAT GAG AAG GGC CTG AAG CAC GTG AGG-3′) and antisense (5′-CCT CAC GTG CTT CAG GCC CTT CTC ATG AGA CAT-3′); for CRD2(C159G), sense (5′-CAC CTC CAC CCA GAC GGT GTG CCC TTC GCC-3′) and antisense (5′-GGC GAA GGG CAC ACC GTC TGG GTG GAG GTG-3′); and for CRD3(C225G), 5′-sense (CAG GCG CAC TCC CTC GGC TCC GCG GCA CTG G-3′) and antisense (5′-C CAG TGC CGC GGA GCC GAG GGA GTG CGC CTG-3′) (bases changed are underlined). Constructs were verified by sequencing. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from exponentially growing A431 cells using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For RT-PCR, cDNA synthesis was performed with 3 μg of total RNA in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 3 μg of random p(N6) primers (Roche Applied Science), 0.5 mm dNTPs (Roche Applied Science), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1× first strand buffer (Invitrogen), and 200 units of Superscript II-RT (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by heating to 70 °C for 20 min. A 5% fraction of the resulting single-stranded cDNA sample was then amplified for 30 cycles with PCR using Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) in a final volume of 50 μl. For amplification of human P2Y receptor and human PKC isoform sequences, the primer pairs used are described elsewhere (46Oshevski S. Le Bousse-Kerdiles M.C. Clay D. Levashova Z. Debili N. Vitral N.

Dermatol. 2003; 120: 440-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The PCR conditions for each cycle were as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min, followed by a final incubation at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were electrophoresed on a 2% (w/v) agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The primers for the PKCβ1 and -θ isoforms yielded no signal in A431 but were positive when using Jurkat T cell cDNA. The reliability of the set of PKCγ primers was verified by amplifying the corresponding fragment of PKCγ using 100 pg of vector encoding human PKCγ as a template. DGKθ-GST Preparation—GST fusion proteins of DGKθ and Cdc42 were produced in COS-7 cells. To this end, cells were transfected with PMT2SM vector encoding DGKθ-GST or GST-Cdc42 for 48 h. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and purification of the GST fusion proteins was achieved on GSH-agarose beads (Sigma). The concentration and quality of the purified proteins, bound to or eluted from the beads, were determined electrophoretically by the intensity of the Coomassie Blue-stained protein bands versus bovine serum albumin standard. GST Pull-down Assay—Cytosols from COS-7 cells transfected with pcDNA3 vector encoding human PKCα, -β2, -δ, -ϵ, -η, -ζ, or -λ were incubated with beads containing 5–10 μg of DGKθ-GST fusion protein for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed five times with buffer A containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 140 mm NaCl. Washed beads were then boiled in Laemmli buffer, and the proteins were analyzed by Western blotting (see below). Subcellular Fractionation—In order to visualize endogenous DGKθ translocation, confluent A431 cells were maintained as controls or were treated with TPA or bradykinin for 15 min. Cells (three 15-cm culture dishes per point) were collected by scraping in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and disrupted by sonication. Nuclei and large debris were removed by centrifugation (Eppendorf centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 5 min), and the supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g (1 h, at 4 °C) to recover membrane pellets. Membranes were solubilized in 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in buffer A, and equal protein samples were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-DGKθ polyclonal antibody 104, subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody to DGKθ (BD Biosciences). Western Blotting—Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation and subjected to 7% SDS-PAGE. Nitrocellulose blots were incubated with anti-DGKθ mouse or anti-PKCα, -β, -δ, -ϵ, -η, -ζ, or -λ mouse monoclonal or anti-GFP rabbit polyclonal antibodies (BD Biosciences). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (DAKO) and enhanced with the chemiluminescence kit from Amersham Biosciences. DGK Enzymatic Assays—DGK activity was measured essentially as described previously (28Houssa B. Schaap D. van der Wal J. Goto K. Kondo H. Yamakawa A. Shibata M. Takenawa T. van Blitterswijk W.J. J.

Lipids were extracted in chloroform/methanol (1:1), and after phase separation, lipids in the organic phase were separated by silica TLC, using the developing system chloroform/methanol/ammonia/water (45:35:2.5:7.5, v/v/v/v). [γ-32P]PA was quantified by phosphorimaging. Cell Imaging—Stably transfected A431 cells expressing GFP-tagged DGKθ or PKC were grown on sterile glass coverslips for at least 48 h. Before live cell imaging, cells were incubated for 2 h with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (supplemented with 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4) and placed inside a prewarmed (37 °C) chamber. Images were taken at 37 °C on a Leica inverted confocal laser microscope. GFP fluorescence was excited with an argon laser emitting at 488 nm, and images were acquired with a ×63 numerical aperture 1.4 oil immersion lens and Leica software. DGKθ Phosphorylation in Vitro—The ability of PKC to phosphorylate DGKθ was tested in vitro using DGKθ-FLAG substrate, immunopurified from transfected COS-7 cells (45Los A.P. van Baal J. De Widt J. Divecha N. van Blitterswijk W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1636: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibodies (Sigma) were immobilized on protein G-Sepharose and then incubated with COS-7 cytosol containing DGKθ-FLAG for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated DGKθ-FLAG was washed five times in wash buffer and eluted with FLAG peptide (2 μg/ml) in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Equal amounts of DGKθ-FLAG were then incubated in the absence or presence of recombinant PKC in buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP (15 μCi), 100 μm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.05% Triton X-100 and resuspended phosphatidylserine (200 μg/ml) and 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (20 μg/ml) in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, for 20 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding hot Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were separated by 7% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and analyzed by autoradiography. PKCϵ Translocation by Transduction of Transactivator of Transcription (TAT)-ψϵRACK—We used the PKCϵ-specific agonist peptide HDAPIGYD (pseudo-ϵRACK; ψϵRACK), which is derived from the regulatory V1 region of PKCϵ (amino acid residues 85–92) and was previously shown to selectively activate the translocation of PKCϵ (48Dorn II, G.W. Souroujon M.C. Liron T. Chen C.H. Gray M.O. Zhou H.Z. Csukai M. Wu G. Lorenz J.N. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To introduce this peptide into cells, it was coupled NH2-terminally to the peptide YARAAARQARAG, which is an optimized version of the protein transduction domain of the TAT protein of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) (50Ho A. Schwarze S.R. Mermelstein S.J. Waksman G. Dowdy S.F. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 474-477PubMed Google Scholar). The entire conjugated peptide, denominated TAT-ψϵRACK, was synthesized and purified in house. It was added to cells at a concentration of 5 μm to induce PKCϵ-GFP translocation effectively within 3 min. Endogenous Expression of DGKθ—Western blotting analysis revealed that DGKθ is expressed in diverse cell types (Fig. 1), such as epithelial-like cell lines (A431, Mel-Juso, HeLa, U2-OS, MCF-7, and Madin-Darby caning kidney cells), fibroblast-like cell lines (COS-7, human embryonic kidney (HEK293), and Chinese hamster ovary cells), neuronal N1E-115 cells, and Jurkat-J6 lymphocytes. No DGKθ expression was found in murine erythroleukemia cells. Properties of GFP Fusion Constructs of DGKθ—In order to investigate the localization of DGKθ, we generated two fusion proteins of DGKθ with GFP. The GFP tag was located either at the N (GFP-DGKθ) or C terminus (DGKθ-GFP) of the kinase. Western blotting analysis of COS-7 cells transfected with the GFP constructs demonstrated that both DGKθ-GFP and GFP-DGKθ had the expected molecular mass of 140 kDa and showed no degradation products (Fig. 2A). Both GFP-tagged DGKθ proteins were catalytically active to a similar extent (Fig. 2B) and similar to the native enzyme. The following experiments were performed mainly with DGKθ carrying the GFP tag at the C terminus. Hormone-induced Translocation of DGKθ-GFP to the Plasma Membrane—In order to investigate whether DGKθ undergoes translocation after receptor stimulation, human A431 cells were stably transfected with DGKθ-GFP. These cells appeared morphologically similar to the wild-type cells and grew with a similar cell cycle time. Confocal microscopic analysis revealed that, in living untreated control cells, DGKθ-GFP was predominantly located in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the majority of cells also showed a small, but significant, amount of DGKθ-GFP in the nucleus. The level of expression in the nucleus varied in the cell population. This variation was independent of the cell cycle (data not shown). Interestingly, application of extracellular ATP (100 μm) induced translocation of DGKθ from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane within 2–6 min (Fig. 3). After 15 min, the kinase slowly returned to the cytoplasm, but this relocation remained incomplete for at least 30 min. Extracellular ATP has been shown to be a potent agonist of both ionotropic P2X and G protein-coupled P2Y receptors (51Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). To discriminate among these classes of receptors, we tested the efficacy of UTP and UDP, selective agonists for P2Y receptors, for their ability to stimulate DGKθ translocation. Both UTP and UDP evoked a translocation of DGKθ-GFP toward the plasma membrane with a similar time course as seen for ATP (Fig. 3) (Supplemental Material, Video 1). In contrast, ADP, adenosine, or the P2X1- and P2X3-selective agonist, α,β-methylene-ATP, had no effect (data not shown). These data strongly suggest the involvement of P2Y purinergic receptors. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis demonstrated the expression of P2Y1 (weakly), P2Y4, P2Y6, and P2Y11 receptor subtypes in A431 cells (Supplemental Fig. A). Next, we found that stimulation of nonpurinergic G protein-coupled receptors, such as for bradykinin and thrombin (THR), also induce translocation of DGKθ-GFP to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3). On the other hand, stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinases with their respective ligands, EGF (100 nm), insulin (1 μm), or insulin-like growth factor-1 (1 μm), failed to induce translocation of DGKθ-GFP (data not shown). Whereas our studies have concentrated on DGKθ-"
https://openalex.org/W1974583731,"The purpose of this study was to gain information on the functional consequences of the supramolecular organization of the photosynthetic apparatus in the bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Isolated complexes of the reaction center (RC) with its core antenna ring (light-harvesting complex 1 (LH1)) were studied in their dimeric (native) form or as monomers with respect to excitation transfer and distribution of the quinone pool. Similar issues were examined in chromatophore membranes. The relationship between the fluorescence yield and the amount of closed centers is indicative of a very efficient excitation transfer between the two monomers in isolated dimeric complexes. A similar dependence was observed in chromatophores, suggesting that excitation transfer in vivo from a closed RC ·LH1 unit is also essentially directed to its partner in the dimer. The isolated complexes were found to retain 25–30% of the endogenous quinone acceptor pool, and the distribution of this pool among the complexes suggests a cooperative character for the association of quinones with the protein complexes. In chromatophores, the decrease in the amount of photoreducible quinones when inhibiting a fraction of the centers implies a confinement of the quinone pool over small domains, including one to six reaction centers. We suggest that the crowding of membrane proteins may not be the sole reason for quinone confinement and that a quinone-rich region is formed around the RC ·LH1 complexes.

We suggest that the crowding of membrane proteins may not be the sole reason for quinone confinement and that a quinone-rich region is formed around the RC ·LH1 complexes. Bioenergetic electron transfer chains encompass membrane protein complexes endowed with redox cofactors arranged in a well defined structure and soluble carriers, which shuttle electrons between them. As the atomic structures of most of the protein complexes are now available, there is a growing interest in the supramolecular arrangement of these complexes and its functional role. A related question is the possible channeling and confinement of the diffusing carriers. Quinones belong to this class of molecular shuttles and are found in all respiratory and photosynthetic chains. These hydrophobic molecules are solubilized in the lipid core of the membrane and carry electrons and protons from a reducing protein complex (e.g. photosynthetic reaction center or Complex I in respiratory chains) to an oxidizing complex (cytochromes bc1 and b6f or a quinol oxidase). They are present in large stoichiometric excess with respect to the electron transfer complexes (quinone pool). Their shuttling function must somehow cope with the dense crowding of membrane proteins, many of which are not electron transfer partners (e.g. light-harvesting complexes and ATPase). In previous work (1Lavergne J. Joliot P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 129-134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 2Joliot P. Lavergne J. Béal D. Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 1992; 1101: 13-22Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the problem of quinone diffusion in thylakoids was analyzed, and it was concluded that, on the relevant time scale for physiological electron transfer, this diffusion is contained within a small range. One piece of evidence came from a study of the apparent equilibrium constant between the quinone pool and its reducing Photosystem II partner QA 1The abbreviations used are: QA, primary quinone acceptor; RC, reaction center; LH, light harvesting complex; Q, ubiquinone; TMPD, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine; P, primary donor; QB, secondary quinone acceptor. (a quinone bound to the reaction center) during the photoreduction process. The accumulation of reduced QA develops earlier and more progressively than expected for a freely equilibrating system. These results suggest that quinone diffusion is restricted to domains with a broadly distributed quinone/RC stoichiometry. The progressive accumulation of Q –A is due to the successive total reduction of domains, scanning this stoichiometric distribution from small to large values of quinone/RC. The size of the quinone domains was independently estimated by measuring the decrease in the reducible pool upon inhibition of a fraction of the RCs; it turned out that, on average, only about three to four centers share a common quinone pool. The structural model proposed (3Lavergne J. Bouchaud J.P. Joliot P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 13-22Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar) to account for these data was based on the assumption of a random spatial distribution of the membrane proteins. The relative membrane area occupied by these complexes is above the “percolation threshold,” so the proteins are expected to delimit closed membrane regions of variable shape and size. Each of these membrane cells constitutes a quinone domain where rapid diffusion and equilibration occur. An important consequence of the quinone confinement in chloroplasts is that long-range electron transfer from grana stacks (rich in Photosystem II) to stroma lamellae (rich in Photosystem I) must predominantly be ascribed to the diffusion of plastocyanin, a soluble carrier enclosed in the luminal space, shuttling between the cytochrome b6f complex and Photosystem I. These results were confirmed and extended by several groups (4Hsu B.-D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1140: 30-36Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 5Hemelrijk P.W. van Gorkom H.J. Biochim. Biophys.

The current understanding of the supramolecular organization may be outlined as follows (see Refs. 9Verméglio A. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 279-295Google Scholar, 10Papiz M.Z. Hawthornthwaite A.M. Prince S.M. McDermott G. Freer A.A. Isaacs N.W. Cogdell R.J.

Res. 2004; 81: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar for reviews). The main protein components are the RC, the antennas LH1 (core) and LH2 (peripheral), and the cytochrome bc1 complex. The F0,F1-ATPase is also present, although in a much smaller amount (13Feniouk B.A. Cherepanov D.A. Junge W. Mulkidjanian A.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1506: 189-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Both LH1 and LH2 tend to form ring structures (14Hu X. Schulten K. Biophys.

Biol. 1998; 282: 833-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In some bacteria such as Blastochloris viridis and Rhodospirillum rubrum, LH1 forms a closed ring around the RC (16Scheuring S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 2063-2068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In R. sphaeroides, evidence for a different organization has been obtained by various approaches. Functional studies led to the proposal of a “supercomplex” structure of the electron transfer proteins, associating two RCs, one bc1 complex, and one cytochrome c2 (which, although a soluble protein, would be somehow sequestered in the supercomplex) (19Joliot P. Verméglio A. Joliot A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 336-345Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 20Lavergne J. Joliot P. Verméglio A. Biochim. Biophys.

Evidence for a dimeric association of the RC ·LH1 complexes was gained from imaging and biochemical techniques. In a mutant devoid of LH2, a regular two-dimensional arrangement of the proteins can form in vivo, which led to obtaining electron microscopy images at 25-Å resolution (22Jungas C. Ranck J.L. Rigaud J.L. Joliot P. Verméglio A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The results revealed a dimeric structure of the RC ·LH1 complexes. The bc1 complex was not discernible in these images, although Jungas et al. (22Jungas C. Ranck J.L. Rigaud J.L. Joliot P. Verméglio A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) believed it was present. This point was re-examined by Siebert et al. (23Siebert C.A. Qian P. Fotiadis D. Engel A. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 690-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), who concluded that the bc1 complex was absent from this tubular membrane fraction. LH1 did not form closed rings around the RCs, but did form an open “C” (hence an “S” shape for the dimer). The open ring would comprise ∼12 αβ-heterodimers, instead of 16 for the closed structure. Biochemical evidence demonstrating the purification of dimeric RC ·LH1 complexes by mild detergent solubilization and sucrose density gradient was obtained independently (24Francia F. Wang J. Venturoli G. Melandri B.A. Barz W.P. Oesterhelt D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6834-6845Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In this procedure, two bands ascribed to monomeric and dimeric states of the complex were observed. Recently, electron microscopy images similar to those obtained by Jungas et al. (22Jungas C. Ranck J.L. Rigaud J.L. Joliot P. Verméglio A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) were reported for the same material (23Siebert C.A. Qian P. Fotiadis D. Engel A. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 690-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and in two-dimensional crystals reconstituted with purified RC ·LH1 complexes (25Scheuring S.

In the latter work, monomers were shown to dimerize upon reconstitution, supporting the view that the native structure in the membrane is dimeric. In a recent atomic force microscopy study of native membranes, images showing arrays of RC ·LH1 dimers were obtained (26Bahatyrova S. Frese R.N. Siebert C.A. Olsen J.D.

A small polypeptide, PufX, appears to play a key role in determining the structural organization. In its absence, the RC ·LH1 complexes adopt a monomeric conformation with a closed LH1 ring of 16 αβ-heterodimers (23Siebert C.A. Qian P. Fotiadis D. Engel A. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A.

This work analyzes the photoreduction of the quinone pool, with a focus on the accessibility and stoichiometric distribution of the quinones with respect to the RCs. The outcome is strikingly similar to what was found for chloroplasts, indicating that, on a time scale of a few hundreds of milliseconds, quinones are confined within domains of small average size and that the local Q/RC ratio is broadly distributed. Besides chromatophores, we examine the quinone content and distribution in purified RC ·LH1 complexes. Dimeric and monomeric preparations of such complexes have been characterized biochemically (24Francia F. Wang J. Venturoli G. Melandri B.A. Barz W.P. Oesterhelt D.

We show that the complexes retain quite a large fraction (≈25–30%) of the quinone pool present in chromatophores. Beyond the specific interest of investigating functional features in this material, comparison with the results obtained in membranes provides useful insights, particularly with regard to the excitation transfer domain. In the accompanying article (29Comayras F. Jungas C. Lavergne J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11214-11223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we report on similar approaches used to analyze the role of the PufX protein. Bacterial Strains—We used the Ga strain of R. sphaeroides from photosynthetic or respiratory cultures. Photosynthetic growth was carried out in anaerobiosis under light. Respiratory growth was carried out under dark semi-aerobic conditions. In both cases, modified Hutner's medium (30Clayton R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1960; 37: 575-580Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar) was used. Unless specified otherwise, experiments were performed with material from photosynthetic cultures. Isolation of Photosynthetic Membranes—Freshly harvested cells were collected by low speed centrifugation at 8000 × g, washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)bezenesulfonyl fluoride (Interchim), and subjected to three cycles with French press at 16,000 p.s.i. The resulting unbroken cells and debris were removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The photosynthetic membranes were then pelleted at 200,000 × g for 90 min and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)bezenesulfonyl fluoride. For the preparation of RC ·LH1 complexes (see below), the membranes were treated with 3 m NaBr, followed by two washes with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) to remove membrane-attached proteins. In all experiments, the membranes were suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Isolation and Purification of Complexes—The photosynthetic membranes were solubilized with 1% β-dodecyl maltoside (Calbiochem) for 10 min at 4 °C and then ultracentrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min to remove the insoluble material. The solubilized complexes were laid on a continuous density sucrose gradient (generated by the freeze-thawing technique) (31Dainese P. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8136-8142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.5 m sucrose, 50 mm sodium cholate, and 0.06% β-dodecyl maltoside and ultracentrifuged at 200,000 × g for 15 h at 4 °C. Three pigment-containing bands were thus separated and ascribed (from top to bottom) to LH2 and monomeric and dimeric RC ·LH1 complexes. The latter fractions were carefully removed using a syringe. To eliminate some LH2 contamination, they were applied to a Mono Q anion exchange fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 5 mm sodium cholate, and 0.03% β-dodecyl maltoside. After washing with 5 ml of buffer, the complexes were eluted with a 30-ml linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl at a rate of 0.5 ml/min. The relative amount of dimeric versus monomeric complexes was increased by the presence of cholate in the above procedure. Similarly, cholate considerably slowed down the irreversible dissociation of dimers to monomers occurring in aging preparations. These observations are consistent with the view that dimeric complexes pre-exist in the native membrane, whereas monomeric complexes result from a degradation process. Absorption and Fluorescence Changes—We used a Joliot-type spectrophotometer (32Joliot P. Béal D. Frilley B. J. Chim. Phys. 1980; 77: 209-216Crossref Google Scholar, 33Joliot P. Joliot A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 765: 210-218Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar) as described previously (34Lavergne J. Matthews C. Ginet N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4542-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this apparatus, the measuring light consists of microsecond flashes from a xenon flash lamp passed through a monochromator and split between measurement and reference pathways. The absorption changes are thus sampled at discrete times chosen by the experimenter. The actinic illumination was either a xenon flash (2 μs at half-height) filtered through a Kodak Wratten 89B filter or a continuous beam from an array of 60 light-emitting diodes (TSHA4401, Vishay Telefunken) with an emission peak around 875 nm. The relative yield of bacteriochlorophyll fluorescence was measured in the same apparatus. Fluorescence was excited by weak probe flashes at 450 nm and filtered through a Kodak Wratten 89B filter. For measurements of the Fm/F0 ratio, the signal was corrected from the offset caused by the scattered excitation light and fluorescence from the filter. Acceptor Pool Photoreduction Measurements—We used reduced TMPD as an electron donor for the RC. Irrespective of the small amount of the endogenous donor (cytochrome c2) contained in our chromatophores, TMPD (with Em = 270 mV) acted as the terminal donor. The accumulation of the photo-oxidized TMPD was followed from the absorption increase at 603 nm. The reduction rate of P+ was proportional to the TMPD concentration; at 10 mm, the half-time was 130–150 μs. We found that the autoxidation of TMPD could be blocked by adding high concentrations of cyanide (25 mm KCN). This inhibits the cytochrome oxidase present in the membrane preparation, which otherwise reacts very efficiently with TMPD; it also maintains a relatively reducing poise that prevents the direct autoxidation of TMPD. Under such conditions, the redox potential of our samples was stable around 100 mV at pH 8. As described below, we measured a midpoint potential of 50 mV for the quinone pool, which implies that the pool was >98% oxidized under our standard conditions. An important requirement in our experiments was to block quinol reoxidation as much as possible. Myxothiazol (1 μm) and antimycin A (5 μm) were added to inhibit the bc1 complex. Propyl gallate (5 mm) was added to block the quinol oxidase present in the membranes. The uncouplers valinomycin (2 μm) and nigericin (2 μm) were added to prevent any buildup of membrane potential or ΔpH. Under such conditions, we could check that the major electron leak out of the reduced Q pool was the back-transfer to the oxidized TMPD, which occurred at a typical rate of 10 electrons/RC/s. This was inferred from the good match between the extent of TMPD re-reduction for variable dark times after a first illumination and the extent of quinol reoxidation revealed by a second illumination. The scheme in Fig. 1 summarizes the electron transfer pathways discussed above. Redox Titrations—Titrations of QA and the Q pool were performed in our spectrophotometer using the home-built electrochemical cell derived from Ref. 35Moss D.A. Nabedryk E. Breton J. Mäntele W. Eur.

This is a thin cuvette (optical path of ≈0.1 mm) fitted with a measuring platinum electrode, a gold grid (InterNet Inc.) as the working electrode (modified by 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (Sigma) to prevent adsorption of the proteins), and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode in 3 m KCl. The redox potential is imposed by a potentiostat. For titrating QA, the medium contained the following redox mediators (each at 50 μm): phenazine ethosulfate (+55 mV), resorufin (–51 mV), Nile blue (–120 mV), and methyl viologen (–440 mV) in addition to 2 mm TMPD (+270 mV). The relative amount of oxidized QA at each potential was determined from the extent of a flash-induced absorption change (P+ and/or carotenoid shift) at 50 μs, before any significant interference of the redox dyes could take place (e.g. the lifetime of P+ was ∼700 μs). For titrations of the Q pool, only two mediators/electron donors were used: TMPD (2 mm) and methylene blue (50 μm; +11 mV). The extent of the photoreducible pool was measured as described above (using the same inhibitors) from the photo-oxidation of the donor(s) at 589 nm (an isosbestic wavelength for both dyes). The potentiostat was switched off during the photoreduction measurements. Mathematical Simulations—These were carried out using Mathcad 2001i (professional edition, Matsoft). In Section I under Supplemental “Experimental Procedures,” we describe the theoretical treatment for the problem of excitonic connectivity in dimers. Section II deals with Poisson or cooperative quinone distribution and simulations of the photoreduction process. Excitonic Connectivity in RC ·LH1 Complexes—In photosynthetic systems, the yield of the (bacterio)chlorophyll fluorescence is modulated by the state of the RC. When the center is in a “closed” state, where normal photochemical charge separation and stabilization cannot occur, it is a less efficient trap for excitons, 2We use the term “exciton” to denote the migration of the excited state, irrespective of its degree of quantum de-localization over several coupled pigments. which have an increased probability of decaying through fluorescence emission from the antenna. If several RCs share a common antenna structure, the excitons “reflected” by a closed center become available for trapping by neighboring open centers, thus increasing their photochemical cross-section. A simple diagnosis for this phenomenon is obtained from the dependence of the fluorescence yield on the fraction of closed centers (37Joliot P. Joliot A. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1964; 258: 4622-4625Google Scholar, 38Paillotin G. J. Theor. Biol. 1976; 58: 219-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 39Paillotin G. J. Theor.

Phys. 2004; 6: 4825-4831Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar): if each center is fed by an individual antenna, a linear relationship is expected, whereas the fluorescence yield rises more slowly than the fraction of closed RCs when the antenna connects several centers. Fig. 2A shows how the fluorescence yield depends on the amount of closed centers in the P+Q –B state for complexes from the monomeric or dimeric fractions. This state was induced by a saturating flash, and the subsequent decays of P+ (from the 603 nm absorption change) and of the fluorescence yield were recorded during the recombination to the open state in the seconds time range. Each data point in Fig. 2 is a couple of fluorescence and P+ values sampled at the same time. The fluorescence is plotted as the normalized quantity Φ = (F – F0)/(Fm – F0), where F0 and Fm are the basal and maximum fluorescence levels, respectively. As expected, the relationship obtained for monomers is linear, confirming the assignment of this fraction and its dispersed state. In contrast, the curved dependence observed in dimers is indicative of connectivity between both partners. This relationship provides quantitative information as to the efficiency of the excitation energy exchange between the two monomers. There is general agreement that the migration within a given LH1 (or LH2) ring is very fast (44Sundström V. van Grondelle R. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 349-372Google Scholar, 45Sundström V. Pullerits T. van Grondelle R. J. Phys. Chem.

Then, the relevant (i.e. possibly rate-limiting) kinetic parameters pertain to the trapping by the open or closed RC of the excitation from its surrounding C ring and to the excitation exchange between the two C rings. The modeling of this problem, as described in Section I under Supplemental “Experimental Procedures,” shows that the parameters for RC trapping intervene through the experimentally accessible ratio R = Fm/F0 of the maximum (all RCs closed) to basal (open RCs) fluorescence yield. The theoretical expression relating the normalized variable fluorescence yield Φ = (F – F0)/(Fm – F0) as a function of the fraction of closed centers (c) is as follows (Equation 1). Φ=c2+c(1−c)1+ρ1+ρR(Eq. 1) The parameter ρ quantifies the transfer efficiency between the two units of the dimer. When ρ approaches 1, this intradimer transfer is fast with respect to the exciton decay, and the limiting function for “perfect” dimer connectivity is as follows (Equation 2). Φ=c2+2c(1−c)1+R(Eq. 2) Using the experimental value of R (≈4.0), it turns out that the data points are in good agreement with the theoretical curve for perfect connectivity (ρ = 1) (Fig. 2A, solid line). As illustrated by the lines drawn for various values of ρ, the condition for approaching Equation 2 is not very stringent: ρ ≥ 0.7 suffices to account for the experimental dependence within experimental accuracy. Then, assuming that the trapping rate by open RCs is (60 ps)–1 (48Sebban P. Moya I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 722: 436-442Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 49Sundström V. van Grondelle R. Bergström H. Akesson E. Gillbro T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 851: 431-446Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar), this implies that the rate of excitation transfer between the two LH1 C rings is faster than (25 ps)–1. It is also interesting to note that the curvature found for the Φ(c) relationship in dimeric particles is too pronounced to be consistent with significantly smaller values of R (for instance, R = 3, even with perfect connectivity, would not be consistent with the data). Excitonic Connectivity in Chromatophores—A similar approach was applied in membranes, except that the data were obtained by monitoring the P+Q –A recombination process in the presence of stigmatellin, which inhibits the electron transfer to QB. This was preferable because a small residual amount of electron donor (cytochrome c2) present in the preparation could interfere significantly with the slow P+Q –B recombination, whereas the competition was less of a problem with the faster P+Q –A recombination. Nevertheless, particular care was taken to eliminate"
https://openalex.org/W2120072474,"The present study showed that delta opioid receptor (δOR) ligands Tyr-Ticpsi [CH2-NH]Cha-Phe-OH (TICP) and ICI174864 behaved as inverse agonists in the cyclase pathway but induced agonist responses in the ERK cascade. Unlike ligands that behaved as agonists in both pathways, and whose stimulation of ERK was marked but transient (10 min), ERK activation by ICI174864 and TICP was moderate and sustained, lasting for more than 1 h in the case of TICP. Biochemical experiments showed that duration of ERK activation by agonists and “dual efficacy ligands” was inversely correlated with their ability to trigger receptor phosphorylation and degradation. Thus, although TICP stabilized δORs in a conformation that did not incorporate 32P, was not a substrate for tyrosine kinase Src, and was not down-regulated following prolonged exposure to the drug, the conformation stabilized by d-Pen-2,5-enkephalin (DPDPE) incorporated 32P, was phosphorylated by Src, and suffered degradation within the first 2 h of treatment. Inhibition of endocytosis by sucrose prolonged ERK activation by DPDPE increasing the decay half-life of the response to values that resembled those of dual efficacy ligands (from a 2-min decay t½ increased to 12 min). Src inhibitor PP2 also prolonged ERK stimulation by DPDPE. It did so by maintaining a sustained activation of the kinase at ∼20% of maximum following an initial rapid reduction in the response. These results show that specific kinetics of ERK activation by agonists and dual efficacy ligands are determined, at least in part, by the differential ability of the two types of drugs to trigger mechanisms regulating δOR responsiveness.

Occupation of G protein-coupled receptors by agonist ligands has two distinct consequences, the generation of an intracellular signal and the concomitant activation of a series of regulatory mechanisms that modulate receptor responsiveness over time. The chain of regulatory events triggered by agonist occupation of the receptor has been extensively characterized and has led to an established model of desensitization in which phosphorylation of the receptor by G protein-coupled receptor kinases is the first step in the process (1Benovic J.L.

Despite the overwhelming evidence supporting this tightly knit model of activation and desensitization, there are also increasing observations indicating that activation and regulatory phenomena can be dissociated. For example, antagonist ligands for cholecystokinin (8Roettger B.F. Ghanekar D. Rao R. Toledo C. Yingling J. Pinon D. Miller L.J. Mol.

Ligands that stabilize G protein-coupled receptors in a conformation that prevents activation of the G protein are classified as inverse agonists and are commonly thought to induce an inactive conformation of the receptor (12Chidiac P.

More recently, some of these drugs have been described as “proteans” or “dual efficacy ligands,” referring to their ability to display both agonist and inverse agonist behavior (11Azzi M.

For example, we have recently shown that ICI118551 and propranolol, two ligands of the β2AR, display dual efficacy, because they behave as inverse agonists in the cyclase pathway but produce agonist responses in the ERK cascade (11Azzi M.

The observation that some “inverse agonists” may produce agonist responses indicates that the conformation they stabilize is not inactive, but rather a signaling state that is distinct from the one stabilized by classic agonists. If receptor states stabilized by agonists and dual efficacy ligands are distinct, then one would expect that the responses that they elicit would also be regulated in a distinct manner. The present study focused on this question, assessing whether agonistic responses generated by dual efficacy ligands for the δOR are regulated as agonist responses induced by its classic agonists. Results show that ERK activation by dual efficacy ligands like TICP and ICI174864 was considerably longer, although more modest than the response induced by agonists such as SNC-80 and DPDPE. Differences in time course were associated with the distinct ability of dual efficacy ligands to stabilize δORs in an ERK-stimulating conformation that eluded regulatory steps typically triggered by highly efficacious agonists.

Wild type and inhibitory mutant forms of c-Src (K295R/Y527F) were a gift from Dr. Bouvier's laboratory (Université de Montréal). Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293s cells were transfected using the calcium-phosphate precipitation method and clones stably expressing full-length or truncated receptors were selected using 400 μg/ml G418. Cell lines stably expressing full-length δORs and wild type c-Src were similarly selected, following Lipofectamine transfection (Invitrogen). The dominant inhibitory form of c-Src (K295R/Y527F) was transiently transfected (0.25–3 μg of DNA) onto cell lines expressing the full-length δOR using polyethyleneimine as described previously (21Boussif O. Lezoualc'h F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5594) Google Scholar). Cells were grown and maintained in complete DMEM containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1000 units/ml penicillin, 1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 1.5 μg/ml fungizone in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Phosphorylation and Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged Receptors—For 32P incorporation assays, cells were incubated for 2 h in phosphate-free DMEM, after which [32P]orthophosphoric acid was added at a final concentration of 1 mCi/ml, and incubation was allowed to proceed for an additional hour. At this time, DPDPE (1 μm), TICP (1 μm), or vehicle (0.01% Me2SO) were added to the incubation medium for 30 min. Cells were then recovered, and membranes were prepared as indicated below and finally suspended in solubilization buffer (0.5% n-dodecyl-maltoside (w/v), 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 140 mm NaCl, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm 1,10-phenantroline). Following agitation at 4 °C for 60 min, the solubilized fraction was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 60 min, and the receptor was immunoprecipitated from the supernatant fraction using anti-FLAG M2 antibody resin. 40 μl of antibody-coupled resin equilibrated in solubilization buffer and supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (w/v) were used to purify the receptor overnight at 4 °C under gentle agitation. The next morning the resin was pelleted, washed twice with 500 μl of solubilization buffer and four times with 500 μl of modified solubilization buffer (containing 0.1% instead of 0.5% n-dodecyl-maltoside (w/v)). The receptor was then eluted by incubating the resin for 10 min at 4 °C with 100 μl of modified solubilization buffer containing 175 μg of FLAG peptide/ml. This elution was repeated three times, and the eluates were combined and concentrated by membrane filtration over Microcon-30 concentrators (Millipore). SDS sample buffer was then added, and samples were used for SDS-PAGE. A similar immunoprecipitation procedure was used to assess Tyr phosphorylation of δORs. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli using a 4% stacking gel and 10% separating gel. Proteins resolved in SDS-PAGE were then transferred (50 mA, 16 h, Bio-Rad Mini-Trans Blot apparatus) from the gels onto nitrocellulose (Amersham Biosciences). In the case of 32P incorporation studies, membranes were first exposed for autoradiography (BIOMAX films, Eastman Kodak Co.). When assessing Tyr phosphorylation of δORs, membranes were probed overnight at 4 °C with monoclonal antibodies raised against phosphorylated Tyr (1:500, PY99, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). In both cases antisera directed against the FLAG M2 antibody (1:1000, Sigma) were used to detect the total amount of receptor protein present in each sample. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antimouse secondary antibodies (1:4000, Sigma) and chemiluminescence detection reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were used to reveal the blotted proteins, and relative intensities of the labeled bands were analyzed by densitometric scanning using MCID (Imaging Research Inc). Receptor phosphorylation was expressed as the ratio between phosphorylation and FLAG signals to normalize to the amount of receptor protein present in each sample. For detection of ERK1/2 activation, cells were grown in 6-well plates and serum-starved overnight. The day of the experiment they were cultured for 2 h in serum-free medium and then exposed to different ligands. Following treatment, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and whole cell extracts were prepared by lysis in SDS sample buffer. Samples were sonicated and then boiled for 5 min before loading for SDS-PAGE. Phospho-ERK1/2 detection was done by probing membranes with antiphospho-ERK1/2 antibody (1:1,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Total ERK protein was determined after stripping by using 1:20,000 dilution anti-ERK1/2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Secondary antimouse (1:5,000, Sigma) and antirabbit (1: 40,000, Amersham Biosciences) horseradish-conjugated antibodies were used to visualize proteins by chemiluminescence. ERK1/2 phosphorylation was normalized according to protein contents by expressing results as the ratio between pERK1/2 and total ERK1/2. To assess Src activation, cells were grown in 100-mm Petri dishes and prepared for the experiment as described for ERK1/2. Following treatment with different ligands cells were washed, harvested, and solubilized in precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% deoxycholate acid, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4) at 4 °C for 90 min. After centrifugation of non-solubilized debris at 12,000 × g for 20 min samples were concentrated, suspended in SDS sample buffer, and separated in SDS-PAGE. Anti-phospho-Src (Y416) monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) at a dilution of 1:1000 was used to determine the presence of activated Src and total amount of protein loaded was detected by probing with antibody anti-Src (1:250, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). cAMP Accumulation Assays—Cells were labeled overnight (16 h) with 1 μCi/ml of [3H]adenine in complete DMEM medium. The day of the experiment radioactive medium was replaced with fresh DMEM, cells were mechanically detached and thoroughly washed (three times) with phosphate-buffered saline (4 °C), and viability was assessed using trypan blue (mortality was never higher than 5%). 5 × 105 cells were then incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in 300 μl of assay mixture containing phosphate-buffered saline, 25 μm forskolin, 2.5 μm isobutylmethylxanthine, and different drugs at the indicated concentrations. At the end of the incubation period, the assay was terminated by adding 600 μl of ice-cold solution containing 5% trichloroacetic acid, 5 mm ATP, and 5 mm cAMP. [3H]ATP and [3H]cAMP were separated by sequential chromatography on Dowex exchange resin and aluminum oxide columns. Results were expressed as the ratio of [3H]cAMP/[3H]ATP plus [3H]cAMP. [35S]GTPγS binding assays were carried out on whole cell membrane preparations as described previously (20Pineyro G. Azzi M. De Lean A. Schiller P. Bouvier M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 816-827PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were suspended in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 10 μg/ml benzamidine) and homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer (Ultra-Turrax T-25, Janke and Kunkel) using three bursts of 5 s at maximum setting. Homogenates were centrifuged at 700 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 20 min. Pellets were washed twice in lysis buffer and were immediately resuspended in [35S]GTPγS assay buffer (50 mm Hepes, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 3 μm GDP, pH 7.4) to yield 10 μg of protein/tube. [35S]GTPγS was used at 50 nm, and nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 100 μm GTP. The test compound SNC-80 was introduced at a final concentration of 100 nm and incubation was allowed to proceed for one hour at RT. The reaction was terminated by rapid filtration onto Whatman GF/C glass filters pre-soaked in water. Filters were washed twice with ice-cold wash buffer (pH 7) containing 50 mm Tris, 5 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm NaCl, and the radioactivity retained was determined by liquid scintillation. Data Analysis—Statistical analysis and curve fitting were done using Prism 2.01 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Comparison of the Effects of δOR Ligands in cAMP and ERK Signaling Cascades—It has been previously shown that certain ligands for β2ARs display dual efficacy, inducing inverse agonist responses in the cAMP signaling pathway, but producing agonist effects in the ERK cascade (11Azzi M. Charest P.G. Angers S. Rousseau G. Kohout T. Bouvier M. Pineyro G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11406-11411Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). To determine whether this type of dual behavior was specific to Gs-coupled receptors or could be extended to receptors coupled to Gi/o proteins, different ligands for the δOR were compared in adenylyl cyclase and ERK signaling pathways. In the cAMP pathway ligands produced effects that spanned the complete spectrum of efficacy ranging from agonism to inverse agonism. At maximally effective concentrations (1 μm) SNC-80 and DPDPE were highly efficacious agonists, morphine, TIPP, and naloxone were partial agonists, while ICI174864 and TICP displayed typical inverse agonist responses. Fig. 1A shows these different ligands ranked according to magnitude and vectorial aspects of their efficacies (SNC-80 ≥ DPDPE > MOR ≥ TIPP ≥ Nx > ICI174864 > TICP). In contrast with the diversity of responses observed in cAMP accumulation assays all drugs tested in the ERK cascade behaved as agonists, except for naloxone that was neutral. Indeed, ERK phosphorylation was induced not only by drugs that behaved as agonists in the cyclase cascade but also by TICP and ICI174864, which had produced inverse agonist responses when tested in this pathway. Moreover, when ranked according to the magnitude of their effect on ERK phosphorylation, TICP, the most efficacious inverse agonist in the cyclase pathway was now more effective than partial agonists TIPP and morphine in activating ERK (SNC-80 > DPDPE > TICP ≥ TIPP ≥ ICI174864 ≥ MOR > Nx). Dual efficacy ligands for the β2AR produce ERK activation via βarrestin recruitment and independently of G protein activity (11Azzi M. Charest P.G. Angers S. Rousseau G. Kohout T. Bouvier M. Pineyro G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11406-11411Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). To determine whether this was also the case for Gi/o-coupled receptors, cells were treated overnight with PTX, and ERK activity was assessed the following day. Without modifying basal activity of the kinase (pERK/ERKtotal ratio in controls: 0.6 ± 0.1; following PTX: 0.6 ± 0.1), PTX abolished ERK stimulation by classic agonist DPDPE and by dual efficacy ligand TICP (Fig. 1C). These results indicate not only that ERK stimulation by DPDPE and TICP requires Gi/o protein activity but also that simple inactivation of spontaneous Gi/o signaling cannot account for ERK stimulation. Neither TICP, ICI174864, nor classic agonists were able to evoke ERK activation in non-transfected cells (not shown), confirming that ligand-induced stimulation of ERK signaling was specifically mediated by the δOR. δOR Ligands Differ in Their Kinetics of ERK Activation—To determine whether the time course of ERK activation by classic agonists differed from that of dual efficacy ligands, cells were exposed to a maximally effective concentration (1 μm) of each drug, and ERK phosphorylation was measured following increasing periods of time. Two main types of kinetic profiles could be recognized. One was characteristic of highly efficacious ligands like SNC-80 and DPDPE, which produced quick and pronounced ERK activation that peaked within 5 min (Fig. 2A), decaying right away with a calculated half-life (t½) of ∼2 min (Fig. 2, B and C). The other type of response, induced by partial agonists and dual efficacy ligands was less pronounced but more sustained, decaying with a t½ that ranged between 11 and 14 min (Fig. 2, B and C). Among ligands inducing sustained responses, the effect of TICP could be distinguished from the rest of the drugs in the same category, because its effect was more pronounced and particularly more sustained (p < 0.001 two-way ANOVA; Fig. 2, A and B). The Time Course of ERK Activation by Highly Efficacious Agonists and Dual Efficacy Ligands Is Correlated with Desensitization Parameters—One of the primary checkpoints that controls drug effects over time is the receptor itself. In particular, δOR signaling efficacy is regulated by phosphorylation of C-terminal Ser/Thr residues (22El Kouhen O.M. Wang G. Solberg J. Erickson L.J. Law P.Y. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36659-36664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 23Law P.Y. Kouhen O.M. Solberg J. Wang W. Erickson L.J. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32057-32065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To determine whether differences in the time course of ERK activation could be related to the distinct ability of different ligands to trigger phosphorylation of δORs cells were exposed for 30 min to DPDPE or TICP (1 μm) in the presence of [32P]orthophosphoric acid. Receptors were immunopurified, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes that were first exposed for autoradiography and then used for Western blot analysis using an anti-FLAG M2 antibody. Immunoblots revealed two broad bands at ≅55 and ≅46 kDa, corresponding to mature and immature monomeric forms of the receptor, respectively (24Petaja-Repo U.E. Hogue M. Laperriere A. Bhalla S. Walker P. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4416-4423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Autoradiograms showed that 30-min incubation with DPDPE increased 32P incorporation by the ≅55-kDa species, but this effect was absent for TICP. Thus, at a time when the ERK response for the agonist was no longer present, δORs were heavily phosphorylated. In contrast, ERK activation by the dual efficacy ligand was still at its maximum, and no phosphorylation of the receptor could be detected. Phosphorylation is an initial step in the process of desensitization, but if exposure to an agonist is allowed to proceed long enough, δORs will start to be targeted for degradation (7Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11130-11140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Hence, to confirm whether the different time course of ERK activation by DPDPE and TICP also correlated with later events in the process of desensitization, cells were treated for 2 h either with the agonist or the dual efficacy drug. Following treatment the total amount of δOR protein present in membrane preparations was assessed by immunoblot (Fig. 3B). Although incubation with TICP caused no detectable change in the mature receptor species (≅55 kDa), there was a decrease of the corresponding immunoreactive band following treatment with DPDPE. These results confirm that differences in the time course of ERK activation by DPDPE and TICP is inversely correlated with the ability of each ligand to trigger different events within the process of desensitization. If indeed differences in time course of ERK activation by agonists and dual efficacy ligands were due to their distinct ability to trigger regulatory mechanisms of receptor responsiveness, interfering with these mechanisms should transform ERK activation by the agonist, into the more prolonged type of response observed for the dual efficacy ligand. To test this assumption the time course of ERK activation by DPDPE was assessed in presence of sucrose, which is an inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Although sucrose did not turn ERK activation into a stable response, it prolonged the effect of DPDPE by increasing the decay t½ of activation from 2 to 12 min (p < 0.001 for interaction; two-way ANOVA; Fig. 4), a value that falls within the 11- to 15-min range observed for dual efficacy ligands. Another means to modify mechanisms regulating δOR responsiveness is to mutate amino acids that are implicated in the process. For δORs, Ser/Thr residues located in the C-terminal domain of the receptor are the principal target for G protein-coupled receptor kinases, and their phosphorylation is an essential step in the desensitization of full-length δORs (22El Kouhen O.M. Wang G. Solberg J. Erickson L.J. Law P.Y. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36659-36664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 23Law P.Y. Kouhen O.M. Solberg J. Wang W.

To explore the contribution of these residues to the kinetics of ERK activation by DPDPE, experiments were repeated using a receptor truncated at its C terminus (δOR344T). This approach also yielded results in which the DPDPE response decayed more slowly than in the full-length receptor (t½ of 6 min; two-way ANOVA; p < 0.01 for interaction; Fig. 4). However, the effect of truncation was far less noticeable than that observed with sucrose on the full-length δOR. Moreover, the addition of sucrose further prolonged the decay t½ for DPDPE in truncated receptors (t½ of 38 min; two-way ANOVA; p < 0.02 for interact"
https://openalex.org/W2052743815,"It has been shown recently that polypeptide toxins that modulate the gating properties of voltage-sensitive cation channels are able to bind to phospholipid membranes, leading to the suggestion that these toxins are able to access a channel-binding site that remains membrane-restricted (Lee, S.-Y., and MacKinnon, R. (2004) Nature 430, 232–235). We therefore examined the ability of anthopleurin B (ApB), a sea anemone toxin that selectively modifies inactivation kinetics of NaV1.x channels, and ProTx-II, a spider toxin that modifies activation kinetics of the same channels, to bind to liposomes. Whereas ProTx-II can be quantitatively depleted from solution upon incubation with phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine liposomes, ApB displays no discernible phospholipid binding activity. We therefore examined the activities of structurally unrelated site 3 and site 4 toxins derived from Leiurus and Centruroides venoms, respectively, in the same assay. Like ApB, the site 3 toxin LqqV shows no lipid binding activity, whereas the site 4 toxin Centruroides toxin II, like ProTx-II, is completely bound. We conclude that toxins that modify inactivation kinetics via binding to NaV1.x site 3 lack the ability to bind phospholipids, whereas site 4 toxins, which modify activation, have this activity. This inherent difference suggests that the conformation of domain II more closely resembles that of the KVAP channel than does the conformation of domain IV.

The pores of such channels have been mapped by analysis of their interactions with conotoxins (NaV) and a variety of polypeptides from scorpion venoms, such as charybdotoxin and agitoxins (1Aiyer J.

More recently, regions of these channels involved in gating have been identified by using gating modifier toxins derived from scorpion (5Rogers J.C. Qu Y. Tanada T.N. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15950-15962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), sea anemone (6Benzinger G.R. Kyle J.W. Blumenthal K.M. Hanck D.A. J. Biol.

Most interestingly, gating modifier toxins appear to interact with the same channel region, designated the S3-S4 linker, irrespective of the type of channel being studied (10Li-Smerin Y. Swartz K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8585-8589Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar).Gating modifier toxins can also be important probes for the accessibility of defined regions of a given channel. Very recently, the MacKinnon laboratory has employed a novel spider toxin, VSTX, to probe the accessibility of defined regions of the voltage sensor of the archaebacterial KVAP channel (9Jiang Y. Ruta V. Chen J. Lee A. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2003; 423: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The resulting data were interpreted in the context of a channel three-dimensional structure (11Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Ruta V. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2003; 423 (2003): 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar) in which the KVAP S3-S4 linker was located either near the cytoplasmic surface or buried within the bilayer, depending on whether the channel was in the resting or activated state (9Jiang Y. Ruta V. Chen J. Lee A. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2003; 423: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The observation that VSTX possessed phospholipid binding activity (12Lee S.-Y. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2004; 430: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) provided a potential explanation for the ability of this toxin to modify channels via interaction with sequences that were never exposed at the extracellular surface.To understand the extent to which this model could be generalized, we examined two other gating modifier polypeptides, anthopleurin B (ApB) and Protx-II (PT-II). ApB is a 49-amino acid residue polypeptide toxin that functions to delay channel inactivation upon binding to site 3 of NaVs (13Sheets M.F. Hanck D.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 617-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), where it competes with a number of scorpion α-toxins that have functionally identical effects. Site 3 has been mapped by mutant cycle analysis to the S3-S4 linker of NaV domain IV (5Rogers J.C. Qu Y. Tanada T.N. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15950-15962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 6Benzinger G.R. Kyle J.W. Blumenthal K.M. Hanck D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 80-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). ProTx-II (PT-II) is a recently discovered 30-amino acid residue polypeptide that conforms to the inhibitory cysteine knot motif and functions as a gating modulator to inhibit NaV activation (14Middleton R.E. Warren V.A. Kraus R.L. Hwang J.C. Liu C.J. Dai G. Brochu R.M. Kohler M.G. Gao Y.D. Garsky V.M. Bogusky M.J. Mehl J.T. Cohen C.J. Smith M.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14734-14747Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Although the binding site of PT-II is not as well characterized as that of ApB, preliminary evidence suggests that it is located in or near the S3-S4 linker of channel domain II (15Kraus R.L. Warren V.A. Smith M.M. Middleton R.E. Blumenthal K.M. Cohen C.J. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 85Google Scholar). This binding site is either similar or identical to the one characterized previously for site 4 or β-scorpion toxins (16Cestele S. Qu Y. Rogers J.C. Rochat H. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A.

Physiol. 2001; 118: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) that modulate channel activation kinetics.We have demonstrated previously that hydrophobic residues that are exposed on the surface of ApB are essential to its activity (18Dias-Kadambi B.L.

We show here that two structurally distinct site 3 toxins, ApB and Leiurus toxin V (LqqV), are both incapable of phospholipid binding. In contrast, the two structurally distinct site 4 toxins, PT-II and Centruroides toxin II (CssII), are phospholipid binders. Moreover, both ApB and PT-II are capable of fully modifying NaV1.5 maintained under hyperpolarized conditions. We interpret these results as meaning that domains II and IV of the sodium channel may differ in their overall conformations, with the S3-S4 linker being relatively more accessible in domain IV than in domain II.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProduction of Recombinant Toxins—Plasmid DNA encoding a synthetic gene for ProTx-II fused to the coding sequence for glutathione S-transferase was obtained from Dr. Charles Cohen. The PT-II coding sequence was subcloned into pET32a vector (Invitrogen) between the BamHI and EagI restriction sites using standard molecular biology protocols. Deletion mutagenesis was employed to remove nucleotides encoding an 11-amino acid N-terminal extension, leaving two extra N-terminal amino acids derived from a StuI restriction site, and the construct was verified by sequencing. A fusion protein containing the N-terminal thioredoxin and C-terminal PT-II was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells by induction in mid-log phase with 0.25 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested and suspended in a lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm each of leupeptin and pepstatin, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of RNase and DNase, and 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme, pH 7.3. Following lysis in a French press, the pellet obtained was extracted with 6 m guanidine HCl, and the solubilized protein was purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin equilibrated with 4 m guanidine HCl. Following elution from the resin with 1 m imidazole and 4 m guanidine HCl, fusion protein was dialyzed against 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer and cleaved overnight at room temperature with enterokinase (Novagen/EMD Biosciences) at 1 unit/150 μg of fusion protein. Recombinant ProTx-II (rPT-II) was purified from the crude digest mixture by RP-HPLC on a C4 column with a 35–75% buffer B gradient over 40 min (buffer B: 75% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and was shown to have a molecular weight of 3985, identical to the calculated molecular weight for PT-II bearing the N-terminal Ala-Ser extension encoded in pJS10. Recombinant ApB, encoded by pJL5, was expressed and purified as described elsewhere (20Seibert A.L. Hanck D.A. Liu J.R. Blumenthal K.M.

Chem. 1992; 267: 13958-13963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Venom Fractionation—Venom from the scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus quinquestriatus was purchased from Sigma. Venom from the scorpion Centruroides suffusus suffusus was a generous gift from Dr. Lourival Possani, Instituto de Biotecnologia in Cuernavaca, Mexico. Both venom samples were fractionated by RP-HPLC, and polypeptide compositions of effluent fractions were characterized by MALDI-TOF analysis.Cell Culture and Electrophysiology—Stably transfected HEK-293 cells expressing NaV1.5 channels were used for whole-cell voltage clamp studies. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 200 μg/ml G-418. All cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. Single cell recordings of currents through NaV1.5 channels were made at room temperature using an Axopatch 200B amplifier with a Digidata 1322A analogue to digital converter and pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments). Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (World Precision Instruments) and fire-polished to a final resistance of 2–4 megaohms when filled with recording solution. The following solutions were used for sodium current measurements: bath solution, 10 mm NaCl, 130 mm CsCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with CsOH; and pipette solution, 95 mm CsF, 30 mm CsCl, 5 mm NaCl, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, with CsOH. During recordings to confirm modification, cells were held hyperpolarized at –130 mV and then stepped to –30 mV for 10 ms every 1 s. Toxins were introduced into the bath using a gravity perfusion system. To generate I-V curves, cells were stepped in 5-mV increments from –80 to +20 mV every 30 ms. Cells were initially stepped from a holding potential of –130 to –90 mV at the start of the protocol. In order to assess state dependence of binding, cells were held hyperpolarized at –130 mV during toxin perfusion. Immediately following perfusion, a modification protocol was carried out from –130 to –30 mV to ascertain whether the channels had been modified in the absence of prior depolarization.GUV Binding Assay—Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) were prepared by solvent evaporation using a 3:1 molar ratio of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine in phosphate-buffered saline buffer as described by Moscho et al. (22Moscho A. Orwar O. Chiu D.T. Modi B.P. Zare R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11443-11447Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Toxin or venom samples were incubated with vesicles for 1 h at 37 °C after which the mixture was centrifuged at 16,000 × g, and residual protein in the supernatant was quantified by RP-HPLC on a C4 column. In cases where the toxin or venom components were depleted from the supernatant, we verified that the protein remained bound to the liposomes by analyzing the pellet.RESULTSIt has been shown recently that VSTX1, a voltage-sensor toxin that inhibits activation kinetics of the archaebacterial channel KVAP, binds liposomes. Based on this, and its slow rate of channel modification, Lee and MacKinnon (12Lee S.-Y. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2004; 430: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) have proposed that gating modifier toxins are able to access their target channel after first partitioning into the lipid membrane. Consistent with these results, scanning mutagenesis of SGTx1, a selective KV2.1 channel inhibitor, has identified a hydrophobic face that is important for binding (23Wang J.M. Roh S.H. Kim S. Lee C.W. Kim J.I. Swartz K.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 455-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This hydrophobic protrusion, referred to as a “dimple,” is also present in other gating modifier toxins. Therefore, we investigated whether a similar membrane-access mechanism might be common to gating modifier toxins targeting other channels. For this purpose, we initially employed ApB, a well characterized site 3 toxin from sea anemone that inhibits inactivation of NaV channels (6Benzinger G.R. Kyle J.W. Blumenthal K.M. Hanck D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 80-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 2A). We have shown previously (18Dias-Kadambi B.L. Combs K.A. Drum C.L. Hanck D.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9422-9428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) that mutagenesis of surface-exposed hydrophobic residues of ApB greatly decreases its binding affinity. Incubation of ApB with GUVs for 1 h at 37 °C followed by centrifugation results in complete recovery of the toxin in the supernatant as demonstrated by HPLC analysis, thus indicating that ApB lacks the ability to bind phospholipids (Fig. 1A).Fig. 1A, ApB is incapable of binding phospholipids. 1–2 μg of ApB was incubated with phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine (3:1) GUVs for 1 h at 37 °C; the liposomes were then pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was analyzed by RP-HPLC. Solid line, ApB control; dashed line, supernatant after incubation with GUVs. B, rPT-II binds GUVs. The experiment was done precisely as described in the legend to A but using 1μg rPT-II rather than ApB. Solid line, rPT-II control; dashed line, supernatant after incubation with GUVs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)This unexpected result led us to examine the recently characterized polypeptide gating modifier, ProTx-II, purified from venom of the tarantula Thrixopelma pruriens (14Middleton R.E. Warren V.A. Kraus R.L. Hwang J.C. Liu C.J. Dai G. Brochu R.M. Kohler M.G. Gao Y.D. Garsky V.M. Bogusky M.J. Mehl J.T. Cohen C.J. Smith M.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14734-14747Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). ProTx-II has been demonstrated to inhibit activation of NaV and CaV channels by shifting their voltage dependence toward more depolarized potentials (14Middleton R.E. Warren V.A. Kraus R.L. Hwang J.C. Liu C.J. Dai G. Brochu R.M. Kohler M.G. Gao Y.D. Garsky V.M. Bogusky M.J. Mehl J.T. Cohen C.J. Smith M.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14734-14747Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). On the basis of this activity, ProTx-II is assumed to be a site 4 β-toxin, and data have been presented consistent with the conclusion that ProTx-II binds to the S3-S4 region of NaV domain II (15Kraus R.L. Warren V.A. Smith M.M. Middleton R.E. Blumenthal K.M. Cohen C.J. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 85Google Scholar). We have produced recombinant ProTx-II (rPT-II) by using a bacterial expression system. As shown in Fig. 2B, the activity of the recombinant peptide is identical to that of the natural material, inhibiting NaV1.5 activation and inducing a voltage-dependent depolarizing shift of the I-V curve of the channel (14Middleton R.E. Warren V.A. Kraus R.L. Hwang J.C. Liu C.J. Dai G. Brochu R.M. Kohler M.G. Gao Y.D. Garsky V.M. Bogusky M.J. Mehl J.T. Cohen C.J. Smith M.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14734-14747Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Incubation of rPT-II with GUVs for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by centrifugation, results in a quantitative depletion of toxin from solution (Fig. 1B). Chromatographic analysis verifies that the toxin is completely recovered in the liposomal pellet. As a positive control in these experiments, we used GsMTx4, a gating modifier of mechanosensor channels isolated from the spider Grammostola spatulata, that has been shown by fluorescence analysis to bind phospholipids (24Suchyna T.M. Tape S.E. Koeppe R.E. Andersen O.S. Sachs F. Gottlieb P.A. Nature. 2004; 430: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). We observe that this toxin is also completely removed from the solution phase following incubation with GUVs (data not shown). These results raise the possibility of a fundamental difference between channel access mechanisms for site 3 and site 4 toxins.In order to further evaluate this possibility, we sought to examine additional, structurally unrelated probes of each site. Venom from the scorpion L. quinquestriatus quinquestriatus is known to contain site 3 toxins that inhibit sodium channel inactivation (25Ray R. Morrow C.S. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7307-7313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the most extensively characterized toxin being designated LqqV. Binding of LqqV has been shown to be competitive with that of anemone toxins like ApB (26Catterall W.A. Beress L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7393-7396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The venom of a different scorpion C. suffusus suffusus is known to contain a family of β-toxins that are homologous to the α-toxins, but bind to a distinct site (site 4) to modify channel activation (16Cestele S.

HPLC analysis revealed the presence of multiple components (Fig. 3A), a subset of which were selectively depleted upon incubation with GUVs. Analysis of individual peaks by MALDI-TOF reveals species of molecular weights identical to the α-toxins LqqI, LqqIII, and LqqV that are not removed upon incubation with GUVs (Table I). Whole-cell voltage clamp analysis reveals that the putative LqqV polypeptide eluting close to 21 min delays inactivation of NaV1.5 (Fig. 4A). Together with the identified molecular weights, the functional data confirm that this material is authentic LqqV and demonstrates that a second, structurally unrelated, site 3 α-toxin is unable to bind GUVs. In contrast, the L. quinquestriatus quinquestriatus venom components that elute later in the gradient are partially to completely depleted by GUVs and are recovered in the post-liposomal pellet (Fig. 3A). MALDI-TOF analysis of this material allowed us to identify the site 4 β-toxin, LqqIT-1′, which elutes in this region (Table I).Fig. 3A, depletion of L. quinquestriatus quinquestriatus venom constituents by phospholipids. Crude L. quinquestriatus quinquestriatus venom was fractionated by RP-HPLC on a C4 column without additional treatment (solid line) or after incubation with GUVs and centrifugation (dashed line).

Data shown are representative of those obtained from three cells. B, modification of NaV1.5 currents by Centruroides toxin. The HPLC peak denoted by the asterisk in Fig. 3B and found to contain a polypeptide of Mr 7546, identical to the calculated Mr of CssII, was analyzed for its ability to modify NaV1.5 currents as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The inhibition of current, coupled with a rightward shift in the I-V curve (closed symbols), confirms the presence of a site 4 toxin in this peak. Data shown are representative of those obtained from three cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)C. suffusus suffusus venom also contains components that are completely depleted from solution in the presence of phospholipids (Fig. 3B). Upon analysis using mass spectroscopy, we were able to identify a well characterized site 4 toxin, CssII, that elutes close to 16 min and is depleted by phospholipids (Table I). After HPLC purification of this polypeptide, we were able to demonstrate its ability to inhibit activation of NaV1.5 and simultaneously shift the voltage dependence of channel activation by 5–7 mV in the depolarizing direction (Fig. 4B), as demonstrated previously for CssII (16Cestele S. Qu Y. Rogers J.C. Rochat H. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 919-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that two structurally unrelated α-toxins, ApB and LqqV, both of which bind to the S3-S4 linker of channel domain IV, are unable to bind phospholipids. Similarly, two structurally unique β-toxins, rPT-II and CssII, are readily bound by phospholipids.The ability of these toxins to bind phospholipids in a site-dependent manner could have important implications for models of channel architecture and voltage-dependent gating, provided that their binding is independent of channel state. To assess state dependence, we analyzed the ability of both rPT-II and ApB to modify channel activation and inactivation kinetics, respectively, using the protocol described under “Experimental Procedures.” Modification of channels by ApB results in the presence of substantial current in the time window of 7–8 ms after depolarization, whereas modification of NaV1.5 by rPT-II inhibits activation and shifts the activation curve in the depolarizing direction (Fig. 2, A and B). After obtaining I-V curves in the absence of toxins, cells expressing NaV1.5 were held hyperpolarized during toxin wash-in and were then subjected to depolarizing pulses to –30 mV. As shown in Fig. 5A, wash-in of 100 nm ApB under these conditions results in complete modification of currents at the first depolarizing pulse, indicating that the S3-S4 loop of channel domain IV is completely accessible under resting conditions. When the same experiment is done with cells maintained at –30 mV, a potential yielding full channel activation, modification is slower and incomplete (data not shown). This is most likely because of the well known enhanced dissociation rate of site 3 toxins from depolarized channels (25Ray R. Morrow C.S. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7307-7313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the same experiment is done with rPT-II, the channel is 75% modified at the first stimulating pulse. The extent of modification does not change with subsequent depolarizing pulses, indicating that the binding site of this toxin is either available to externally added polypeptides in the resting channel or that the ability of such toxins to bind lipids allows them to access their binding site following binding to or insertion into the phospholipid bilayer (Fig. 5B). This degree of inhibition is consistent with that reported previously for ProTx-II (14Middleton R.E. Warren V.A. Kraus R.L. Hwang J.C. Liu C.J. Dai G. Brochu R.M. Kohler M.G. Gao Y.D. Garsky V.M.

Cells were held hyperpolarized at –130 mV during perfusion with 100 nm ApB and then stimulated to –30 mV, and current was recorded as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The complete modification of INa detected in the first depolarizing pulse is indicative of complete modification of the closed channel. Data are representative of those obtained from five cells. B, modification of NaV1.5 currents by PT-II occurs in the closed state.

These divergent transcriptional properties are conferred through recruitment of auxiliary proteins, denoted coactivators and corepressors. Repression plays a particularly critical role in the functions of the nuclear receptors, a large family of ligand-regulated transcription factors involved in metazoan development, differentiation, reproduction, and homeostasis. The SMRT corepressor interacts directly with nuclear receptors and serves, in turn, as a platform for the assembly of a larger corepressor complex. We report here that SMRT is expressed in cells by alternative mRNA splicing to yield two distinct variants or isoforms. We designate these isoforms SMRTα and SMRTτ and demonstrate that these isoforms have significantly different affinities for different nuclear receptors. These isoforms are evolutionarily conserved and are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Our results suggest that differential mRNA splicing serves to customize corepressor function in different cells, allowing the transcriptional properties of nuclear receptors to be adapted to different contexts.

This bimodal transcriptional regulation is accomplished through a hormone-regulated exchange of a corepressor complex, found on the nuclear receptor in the absence of hormone, for a coactivator complex recruited in the presence of hormone agonist (14Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Corepressor and coactivator protein complexes regulate transcription through direct interaction with the basal transcription machinery and through modification of chromatin structure (15Privalsky M.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2004; 66: 315-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Both activation and repression are essential for correct receptor function. For example, RAR-mediated repression is required for appropriate anterior/posterior segregation in vertebrates, and disruption leads to aberrant head formation during murine development (16Koide T. Downes M. Chandraratna R.A. Blumberg B. Umesono K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2111-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). TR-mediated repression is required for correct Xenopus larval development, and abrogation of repression leads to premature metamorphosis (17Sachs L.M. Jones P.L. Havis E. Rouse N. Demeneix B.A. Shi Y.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8527-8538Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Aberrations in the regulation of repression can result in human disease. For example, resistance to thyroid hormone syndrome, an inherited endocrine disorder, has been mapped to mutations in TRs that disrupt the hormone-driven release of corepressor (18Matsushita A.

SMRT (silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors) and its paralog, N-CoR (nuclear receptor corepressor), are central mediators of transcriptional repression by TRs, RARs, and RXRs (29Horlein A.J.

A series of at least four “repression domains” within the N-terminal portion of SMRT and N-CoR (denoted RD1 to RD4) serve as docking surfaces for these additional corepressor subunits, whereas a series of more C-terminal receptor interaction domains (denoted S1 and S2 in SMRT and N1 to N3 in N-CoR) mediate contacts with the nuclear receptors (see Fig. 1A) (38Nagy L.

In the presence of hormone agonist, a conformational change in the C-terminal helix 12 of the nuclear receptors occludes this corepressor docking surface, causing release of SMRT or N-CoR, release of the remainder of the corepressor complex, and derepression of target gene expression (43Farboud B.

This repositioning of helix 12 by agonist simultaneously forms a new surface that recruits coactivators, thereby conferring transcriptional activation (43Farboud B. Hauksdottir H. Wu Y.

Biol. 2004; 89 –90: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Many nuclear receptors bind to DNA as protein dimers, and it is believed that two CoRNR motifs within a single SMRT or N-CoR are employed in tethering these corepressors to the two receptors that compose the dimer (41Cohen R.N.

Brzostek S. Cohen R.N. Hollenberg A.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Previous work has suggested that RAR preferentially interacts with the S2 domain, RXR preferentially interacts with the S1 domain, and TR can interact with both the S1 and S2 domains (31Sande S. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 813-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 38Nagy L. Kao H.Y. Love J.D. Li C. Banayo E. Gooch J.T. Krishna V. Chatterjee K. Evans R.M. Schwabe J.W.

Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5724-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Many nuclear receptors are expressed as a series of interrelated isotypes or isoforms. For example, two genetic loci in vertebrates encode TRs (denoted TRα and TRβ); three genetic loci encode RARs (denoted RARα, RARβ, and RARγ); and three genetic loci encode RXRs (denoted RXRα, RXRβ, and RXRγ) (51Evans R.M.

Alternative mRNA splicing and promoter utilization result in further diversification of the receptors that are produced from a given locus (56Zelent A. Mendelsohn C. Kastner P. Krust A. Garnier J.M. Ruffenach F. Leroy P. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 57Leroy P. Krust A. Zelent A. Mendelsohn C. Garnier J.M. Kastner P. Dierich A. Chambon P.

Rev. 1993; 14: 184-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). These various nuclear receptor isotypes are expressed in tissue- and development-specific patterns, display distinct interactions with corepressors and coactivators, and exhibit distinct transcriptional properties (50Wong C.W. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5724-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 61Li H. Leo C. Schroen D.J. Chen J.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 2025-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). N-CoR and SMRT can similarly be considered isotypes of one another, thereby paralleling the multiple isotypes found in their nuclear receptor partners. We report here a further extension of this concept by demonstrating that SMRT is itself expressed by alternative mRNA splicing to generate at least two distinct isoforms (denoted SMRTα and SMRTτ) that are expressed at different levels in different tissues (see Fig. 1A). SMRTα contains 47 amino acids in its C-terminal domain that are absent from SMRTτ (30Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1694) Google Scholar, 31Sande S. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 813-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The SMRTα-specific 47 amino acids map only 5 residues away from the S1 CoRNR box. As a consequence, although both SMRT isoforms interact nearly equally with RARα, they differ significantly in the ability to interact with and mediate repression by different isoforms of TR. We conclude that the receptor interaction properties of SMRT can be modified by alternative mRNA splicing and that, as a result, the repression properties of different nuclear receptors are likely to differ in different cell and tissue contexts. These observations also help reconcile apparent discrepancies in the literature as to the relative affinity of TRs for N-CoR versus SMRT (17Sachs L.M. Jones P.L. Havis E. Rouse N.

Plasmids—PCR was used to introduce BamHI and XhoI restriction sites at the ends of DNA fragments representing the S1 domain (amino acids 2313–2517), the S2 domain (amino acids 2077–2312), or both the S1 and S2 domains (amino acids 2077–2517) of SMRTα (GenBank™/EBI accession number AF113003) or the corresponding fragments of SMRTτ. These PCR products were cloned into the corresponding BamHI and XhoI sites in pGEX-KG (64Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). For expression in vitro or in transfected mammalian cells, these receptor interaction subdomains of SMRT were transferred from the pGEX plasmids into a modified version of pSG5 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) containing an N-terminal Myc epitope tag. The mammalian expression plasmids pSG5-TRα1, pSG5-TRβ1, and pSG5-Gal4DBD-TRβ1HBD (where DBD is DNA-binding domain and HBD is hormone-binding domain; amino acids 177–461) were described previously (65Yang Z. Privalsky M.L. Mol.

Farboud B. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Protein Expression and Purification—Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of the various SMRT receptor interaction domains were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21, purified by binding to glutathione-agarose (43Farboud B. Hauksdottir H. Wu Y. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2844-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 64Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar), and recovered by elution in two changes of 20 mm glutathione and 100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by SDS-PAGE (67Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), Coomassie Blue staining (68Wong C. Sridhara S. Bardwell J.C. Jakob U. BioTechniques. 2000; 28: 426-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and scanning using an Alpha Innotech FluorChem 8900 densitometer running AlphaEaseFC Version 4.0.1 software (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). Ovalbumin was analyzed in parallel as a protein concentration standard. Native TRα1, TRβ1, RARα, and RXRα were expressed in Sf9 insect cells using a recombinant baculovirus system and were prepared as described previously (69Chen H.W. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5970-5980Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Computational DNA Sequence Analysis—BLAST alignments of SMRTα and SMRTτ sequences were performed using the software on the National Center for Biotechnology Information web site (available at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) (70Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar) and the public domain expressed sequence tag (EST) and human genomic sequence data bases. Pairwise sequence alignments were performed using the Align algorithm in Biology Workbench Version 3.2 at the San Diego Supercomputer Center (available at workbench.sdsc.edu/) (71Myers E.W. Miller W.

Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 63-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar). Protein-Protein and Protein-DNA Interaction Assays—The ability of various SMRT isoforms and subdomains to bind to nuclear receptors in the presence of DNA was assayed in vitro by a electrophoretic mobility shift/supershift assay as described previously (62Yoh S.M. Privalsky M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16857-16867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, TR homodimers, RAR homodimers, RXR homodimers, or the corresponding heterodimers were formed on 32P-radiolabeled DNA probes and incubated with a range of purified GST or GST-SMRT protein concentrations. The resulting protein·DNA complexes were resolved by native gel electrophoresis and visualized using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager. The ability of the SMRT constructs to retard (“supershift”) the mobility of the nuclear receptor·DNA complexes was quantified using the PhosphorImager. Apparent dissociation constants were calculated using Prism Version 4.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) to fit the equation Y = Bmax·X/(Kapp + X); Bmax was constrained to be the same for both SMRTα and SMRTτ in all cases. Relative affinities are expressed as the ratio of SMRTτ Kapp to SMRTα Kapp. Subcellular Localization of SMRTα and SMRTτ—Green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions of full-length SMRTα and SMRTτ were generated by ligation of the appropriate corepressor coding regions into a pCMV-GFP vector. 2Jonas, B. A., and Privalsky, M. L. (2004) J. Biol. Chem.279, 54676–54686. These constructs were introduced into CV-1 cells (1.0 × 105/well in a 6-well plate) using the Effectene transfection reagent (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were fixed 48 h after transfection in acetone/methanol (1:1) for 10 min. The cells (on glass coverslips) were then stained with 50 ng/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to visualize nuclei, mounted on slides using 25 μl of Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and sealed with fingernail polish. The slides were visualized using a Nikon Microphot epifluorescence microscope. Digital images were captured with a Nikon Cool Pix 4500 digital camera. Dominant-negative Derepression Assay—CV-1 cells (3 × 105/well) were plated in 24-well culture plates and incubated overnight in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The medium was then replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum (hormone-depleted); a total of 250 ng of plasmid DNA was introduced per well using the Effectene transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. The DNA mixture included 50 ng of the appropriate luciferase reporter plasmid, 50 ng of either plasmid pSG5-TRβ1 or pSG5-Gal4DBD-TRβ1HBD, 50 ng of pCH110-β-galactosidase vector (employed as an internal transfection control), and 0–100 ng of pSG5Myc-SMRTα(S1/S2) or pSG5Myc-SMRTτ(S1/S2). Total plasmid DNA was adjusted by addition of an empty pSG5 vector so as to be equal in all samples. After an additional 24-h incubation at 37 °C, the cells were harvested, lysed, and analyzed for luciferase activity using the Promega luciferase assay system and for β-galactosidase activity as described previously (43Farboud B. Hauksdottir H. Wu Y. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2844-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Duplicate transfections were immunoblotted with anti-Myc antibody (Gamma1 Laboratories, Lexington, KY). The immunoblot was visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody and ChemiGlow chemiluminescence substrate (Alpha Innotech Corp.). Images of the immunoblot were captured using an Alpha Innotech FluorChem 8900 densitometer and quantified using AlphaEaseFC software. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Organs were harvested from 6-week-old male C57/BL6 mice and quick-frozen on dry ice before brief storage at –80 °C. Mouse organs were homogenized in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) using a T 8 ULTRA-TURRAX homogenizer (IKA Works, Inc., Wilmington, NC); total RNA was prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primers, 4 μg of total RNA, and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) as described previously (74Sarge K.D. Park-Sarge O.K. Kirby J.D. Mayo K.E. Morimoto R.I. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 50: 1334-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). cDNAs corresponding to SMRTα and SMRTτ were selectively amplified by PCR using a common SMRTα/τ-Up primer (5′-caccggaacaggccttatgacc-3′) and a common SMRTα/τ-Down primer (5′-ggttgtaggggaatggcgtgg-3′). PCR was carried out for the number of cycles given in each figure legend using the following cycling parameters: 94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. SMRTα and SMRTτ mRNAs generated products of 442 and 301 bp, respectively, which were resolved on a 2% agarose gel (0.5× Tris borate/EDTA running buffer, 100 V for 75 min), visualized by ethidium bromide staining, and quantified using an Alpha Innotech FluorChem 8900 densitometer and AlphaEaseFC software. The identity of each PCR product was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Glyceral-dehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA (GenBank™/EBI accession number NM_008084) was amplified using the same cycle parameters described for SMRT and oligonucleotides GAPDH-Up (5′-gctgaacgggaagctcactgg-3′) and GAPDH-Down (5′-gcctgcttcaccaccttctt-gatg-3′), producing a 125-bp product. Both the SMRT and GAPDH primers span introns such that genomic DNA would produce significantly larger DNA products; however, no evidence of genomic DNA contamination was observed. Two Distinct Forms of SMRT That Differ in Their C-terminal Receptor Interaction Domains Are Expressed—Inspection of the known SMRT cDNA sequences revealed an interesting heterogeneity in the C-terminal corepressor domain, defined by the inclusion or exclusion of a 47-codon sequence immediately flanking the S1 receptor interaction domain (Fig. 1, A and B) (30Chen J.D.

https://openalex.org/W2168864322,"Previous work from our laboratory (Zinser, E., Paltauf, F., and Daum, G. (1993) J. Bacteriol. 175, 2853–2858) demonstrated steryl ester hydrolase activity in the plasma membrane of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we show that the gene product of YEH2/ YLR020c, which is homologous to several known mammalian steryl ester hydrolases, is the enzyme catalyzing this reaction. Deletion of yeast YEH2 led to complete loss of plasma membrane steryl ester hydrolase activity whereas overexpression of the gene resulted in a significant elevation of the activity. Purification of enzymatically active Yeh2p close to homogeneity unambiguously identified this protein as a steryl ester hydrolase and thus as the first enzyme of this kind characterized in S. cerevisiae. In addition to evidence obtained in vitro experiments in vivo contributed to the characterization of this novel enzyme. Sterol analysis of yeh2Δ unveiled a slightly elevated level of zymosterol suggesting that the esterified form of this sterol precursor is a preferred substrate of Yeh2p. However, in strains bearing hybrid proteins with strongly enhanced Yeh2p activity decreased levels of all steryl esters were observed. Thus, it appears that Yeh2p activity is not restricted to distinct steryl esters but rather has broad substrate specificity. The fact that in a yeh2Δ deletion strain bulk steryl ester mobilization occurred at a similar rate as in wild type suggested that Yeh2p is not the only steryl ester hydrolase but that other enzymes with overlapping function exist in the yeast.

The fact that in a yeh2Δ deletion strain bulk steryl ester mobilization occurred at a similar rate as in wild type suggested that Yeh2p is not the only steryl ester hydrolase but that other enzymes with overlapping function exist in the yeast. Most eukaryotic cells contain and synthesize sterols, which are essential lipid components of membranes. Besides their role in maintaining membrane permeability and fluidity, effects of sterols on aerobic metabolism (1.Smith S.J. Parks L.W. Yeast. 1993; 9: 1177-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 2.Smith S.J. Parks L.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1345: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), completion of the cell cycle (3.Dahl C. Biemann H.P. Dahl J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4012-4016Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) as well as on sterol uptake (4.Lorenz R.T. Rodriguez R.J. Lewis T.A. Parks L.W. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 981-985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and sterol transport (5.Tuller G. Daum G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) have been described. Considering the different functions of sterols it is obvious that sterol homeostasis, including sterol biosynthesis, uptake, transport, storage, utilization, and efflux, has to be a strictly regulated process. Specific sterols present in different eukaryotic cells vary, ergosterol being the major sterol in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Besides other regulatory mechanisms esterification of sterols and hydrolysis of steryl esters (STE) 1The abbreviations used are: STE, steryl esters; CEL, carboxyl ester lipase; LAL, lysosomal acid lipase; HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; TAG, triacylglycerols; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TEV, tobacco etch virus; PAM, plasma membrane-associated membrane; YEH, yeast steryl ester hydrolase; ORF, open reading frame; GC, gas chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; MD, mean deviation. play an important role in cellular sterol homeostasis. These processes do not only allow cells to store chemical energy, which can be used in times of deprivation, but also provide an additional means to balance the concentrations of free sterols and fatty acids, which are essential and critical for cell structure and function. In mammalian cells esterification of sterols is catalyzed either by lecithin:cholesteryl acyltransferase (reviewed in Refs. 6.Peelman F. Vandekerckhove J. Rosseneu M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 7.Santamarina-Fojo S. Lambert G. Hoeg J.M. Brewer Jr., H.B. Curr. Opin.

Acta. 2000; 1529: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) or by the two acyl-CoA:cholesteryl acyltransferases ACAT1 and ACAT2 (reviewed in Ref. 9.Buhman K.F. Accad M. Farese Jr., R.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 142-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Cholesteryl ester hydrolysis occurs by a number of mammalian enzymes many of which have already been identified, among them carboxyl ester lipase (CEL), lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) (reviewed in Ref. 10.Hui D.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1303: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11.Fowler S.D. Brown W.J. Lipases. Elsevier, New York1984: 329-364Google Scholar, 12.Hui D.Y. Howles P.N. J.

Great efforts have been made to clarify the relationship between the different proteins, especially with respect to their tissue distribution and their similarities in structure and function. CEL, a protein, which is synthesized primarily in pancreatic acinar cells and lactating mammary glands of higher mammals, is involved in dietary fat and cholesterol absorption. At the same time, a possible role of CEL in plasma lipoprotein metabolism and atherosclerosis has been discussed. LAL is a key enzyme in the intracellular degradation of triacylglycerols (TAG) and cholesteryl esters derived from plasma lipoproteins. Lack of this acidic lipase activity in humans causes two distinct phenotypes, Wolman disease and cholesteryl ester storage disease. Until recently, hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) has been regarded as an adipose tissue-specific enzyme entirely focused on the hormone-stimulated lipolysis of TAG in this tissue. Ongoing research, however, revealed that HSL plays a number of additional roles in lipid metabolism, including that of a neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase. Finally, it has to be mentioned that similar to HSL, also CEL and LAL are not restricted to cholesteryl ester utilization but rather show broad substrate specificity. In the yeast S. cerevisiae, sterols that are not immediately needed as membrane components can be esterified in the endoplasmic reticulum by the STE synthases Are1p and Are2p (15.Yang H. Bard M.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Together with TAG, STE are stored in lipid particles and form the hydrophobic core of this compartment (reviewed in Ref. 19.Zweytick D. Athenstaedt K. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Little is known, however, about pathways and mechanisms of STE hydrolysis in yeast. Whereas Taketani et al. (20.Taketani S. Osumi T. Katsuki H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 525: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) detected the highest specific activity of STE hydrolase of S. cerevisiae in mitochondria, Zinser et al. (17.Zinser E. Paltauf F. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2853-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) reported localization of the highest specific activity of this enzyme in the plasma membrane and secretory vesicles. It has to be considered, however, that similar to mammalian STE hydrolases enzymes with overlapping function may also occur in the yeast differing from each other with respect to their subcellular location and/or their substrate specificity. To identify protein(s) involved in yeast STE hydrolysis we decided to screen the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome for ORF-containing sequences which are homologous to known mammalian STE hydrolases from various organisms. Plasma membrane preparations of yeast strains lacking candidate gene products were subjected to activity assays in vitro with the aim to discover mutants with reduced or without STE hydrolase activity in this subcellular fraction. This approach identified the gene product of YEH2/YLR020c 2The nomenclature of the ORF YLR020c as YEH2 was chosen in agreement with the SGD data base (www.yeastgenome.org/). as a yeast plasma membrane located STE hydrolase through experiments in vivo and in vitro using a yeh2Δ deletion mutant and various strains harboring modified Yeh2p with high STE hydrolase activity. Yeast Strains, Culture Conditions, and Isolation of Subcellular Fractions—The wild-type yeast strain S. cerevisiae BY4742 (MATα, his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, lys2Δ0, ura3Δ0) and the corresponding deletion mutant ylr020cΔ::kanMX (EUROFAN collection, Frankfurt, Germany) were used throughout this study. Cells were grown in rich medium containing 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose (YPD) or 2% galactose (YPGal), or in minimal medium containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base and 2% glucose (MMGal) or 2% galactose (MMGal) supplemented with the appropriate amino acids for 16 h (YPD), 22 h (YPGal), or 44 h (MMGal). For isolation of mitochondria yeast cells were grown on YPLac (2% lactate) (21.Daum G. Böhni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subcellular fractions were prepared by published procedures (22.Serrano R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 23.Leber R. Zinser E. Zellnig G. Paltauf F.

Protein was quantified by the method of Lowry et al. (25.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Phenotypic Analysis—The following drugs and reagents were added to MMGal containing 2% agar immediately before pouring into Petri dishes: 0.1–4 μg/ml cycloheximide (stock in ethanol), 5–20 μg/ml fluconazole (Diflucan IV, Pfizer), 0.25–6 μg/ml nystatin (stock in N,N-dimethylformamide), 0.25–1.5 M sorbitol, 0.25–2% Brij58, 1–8% ethanol, and 0.4–4.9 mm hydrogen peroxide. Solid media were incubated for 3–4 days at 30 °C. Temperature sensitivity was tested by cultivating yeast strains on YPD, MMGal, or YPGal agar plates at 37 °C. Data Base Search and Computational Analysis—Sequence alignments were performed with polypeptide sequences of known STE hydrolases from higher eukaryotic organisms like mouse, rat, and human using a BLAST search. A cut-off value of E = 0.01 to 0.05 was defined (26.Pearson W.R. Wood T. Zhang Z. Miller W. Genomics. 1997; 46: 24-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Molecular data about proteins were obtained from the Incyte Proteome BioKnowledge Library, the Saccharomyces Genome Data base (SGD), the Comprehensive Yeast Genome Data base, the S. cerevisiae Gene DB, the Protein families data base of alignments and HMMs (PFAM), and Swiss Prot. Transmembrane regions were predicted either by TMHMM (v2.0) (PFAM) (27.Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9373) Google Scholar, 28.Sonnhammer, E. L. L., von Heijne, G., and Krogh, A. (1998) Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology, Menlo Park, CAGoogle Scholar) or using applications available at EMBOSS (SGD). Lipid Analysis—Lipids from yeast cells grown on YPD or MMGal were extracted as described by Folch et al. (29.Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the quantification of neutral lipids extracts were applied to Silica Gel 60 plates with the aid of a sample applicator (Linomat IV; CAMAG, Muttenz, Switzerland), and chromatograms were developed in an ascending manner by using the solvent system light petroleum/diethyl ether/acetic acid (25: 25:1; per vol.) for the first third of the distance. Then, plates were dried briefly and further developed to the top of the plate using the solvent system light petroleum/diethyl ether (49:1; v/v). Quantification of ergosterol and ergosteryl esters was carried out by densitometric scanning at 275 nm using a Shimadzu dual-wavelength chromatoscanner CS-930 with ergosterol as a standard. TAG was visualized by postchromatographic staining with a chromatogram immersion device (CAMAG). Plates were dipped for 6 s into a developing reagent consisting of 0.63 g of MnCl2·4H2O, 60 ml of H2O, 60 ml of methanol, and 4 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid, briefly dried, and heated at 100 °C for 30 min. Quantification of TAG was carried out by densitometric scanning at 400 nm with triolein as a standard. For gas liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) of sterols (30.Quail M.A. Kelly S.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 53: 123-131PubMed Google Scholar) either whole cells (corresponding to 20 ml of cells with an OD600 of 1) or 500 μg of homogenate protein were incubated for 2 h at 90 °C together with 0.6 ml of methanol, 0.4 ml of 0.5% pyrogallol dissolved in methanol, 0.4 ml of 60% aqueous KOH, and 10 μg of cholesterol dissolved in ethanol as an internal standard. Lipids were extracted three times with n-heptane and combined extracts were taken to dryness under a stream of nitrogen. Then, lipids were dissolved in 10 μl of pyridine and after adding 10 μlof N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (Sigma) samples were diluted with ethyl acetate to an appropriate concentration. GC/MS analysis of silylated sterol adducts was performed on a Hewlett-Packard HP 5890 Series II gas chromatograph (Palo Alto, CA), equipped with an HP 5972 mass selective detector, and HP 5-MS column (cross-linked 5% phenyl methyl siloxane; dimensions 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm film thickness). Aliquots of 1 μl were injected in the splitless mode at 270 °C injection temperature with helium as carrier gas at a flow rate of 0.9 ml/min in constant flow mode. The following temperature program was used: 1 min at 100 °C, 10 °C/min to 250 °C, and 3 °C/min to 310 °C. Mass spectra were acquired in scan mode (scan range 200–550 amu) with 3.27 scans per second. Sterols were identified based on their mass fragmentation pattern. Enzyme Analysis in Vitro and Mobilization of Steryl Esters in Vivo— STE hydrolase activity was determined as described by Taketani et al. (20.Taketani S. Osumi T. Katsuki H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 525: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and Zinser et al. (17.Zinser E. Paltauf F. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2853-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). For standard substrate preparation 165 μl of cholesteryl oleate (1 mg/ml in CHCl3/MeOH; 2:1, v/v), 50 μl of cholesteryl [1-14C]oleate (100 μCi/ml) and 150 μl of Triton X-100 (100 mg/ml in acetone) were mixed and taken to complete dryness. The remnant was suspended in 2.5 ml of Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. STE hydrolase activity was estimated in a total volume of 0.5 ml containing 0.25 ml of the aqueous suspension of radiolabeled cholesteryl oleate (see above) and 0.3–1 mg of protein. The reaction was linear with time for at least 10 min. Assays were stopped by adding 4 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), lipids were extracted (29.Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and neutral lipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography using the solvent system light petroleum/diethyl ether/acetic acid (35:15:1; per vol.). Bands corresponding to free fatty acids and STE were scraped off the thin-layer plates, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. For the analysis of enzyme kinetics, rates of metabolic conversion were determined at different substrate concentrations. Variable amounts of cholesteryl oleate (1 mg/ml in CHCl3/MeOH; 2:1, v/v) together with 5 μl of cholesteryl [1-14C]oleate (100 μCi/ml) and 45 μl of Triton X-100 (100 mg/ml in acetone) were used as substrate in a final volume of 0.25 ml of Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. Substrate specificity of Yeh2p was tested by using either 15 μgofTAG labeled with [14C]palmitic acid, or 125 nmol phospholipids labeled with [14C]oleate as substrate under the same assay conditions as described above. Wild-type levels of fatty acids released from these substrates were compared with a strain overexpressing Yeh2p. For the biosynthesis of radioactively labeled substrate, 100 ml of synthetic medium containing either 20 μCi of [14C]palmitic acid or [14C]oleate (0.4μmol, respectively), were inoculated with 200 μl of a wild-type preculture grown for 48 h. After 24 h of cultivation, cells were harvested, and lipids were extracted as described above. Lipids were separated by thin layer chromatography using light petroleum/diethyl ether/acetic acid (35:15:1; per volume) as a solvent. Bands of TAG or phospholipids were scraped off the plate and extracted from the silica gel with chloroform/methanol (2:1; v/v) and chloroform/methanol (1:4; v/v), respectively. Quantification of TAG was performed as described above, and phospholipids were quantified by the method of Broekhuyse (31.Broekhuyse R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 152: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Mobilization of STE in vivo was tested as described by Leber et al. (32.Leber R. Zinser E. Hrastnik C. Paltauf F. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1234: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In brief, yeast cells were pregrown in YPD medium for 16 h and transferred to sterol-free medium (MMGluc). Terbinafine dissolved in ethanol was added at a final concentration of 30 μg/ml. The optical density was measured with a Hitachi U-1100 UV/VIS Spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 600 nm, and aliquots of the cultures were withdrawn at different time points. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with H2O, and prepared for lipid analysis. Cloning and Tagging of YEH2—YEH2 was cloned into the vector pGP316 by homologous recombination. For this purpose a PCR fragment of the ORF extended 3′ and 5′ by 60 bp homologous to pGP316 together with the linearized vector were transformed (33.Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2116) Google Scholar) into the wild-type strain S. cerevisiae BY4742. Positive transformants were selected by uracil auxotrophy. YEH2 was tagged in the genome of wild-type BY4742 by transformation (33.Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2116) Google Scholar) with PCR products from the template plasmids pFA6a-GFP(S65T)-kanMX6 (C-terminal GFP tag), pFA6a-kanMX6-PGAL1 (insertion of a gal-promotor), pFA6a-His3MX6-PGAL1 (insertion of a gal-promotor) (34.Longtine M.S.

For all primers used see Table I. The different constructs and the respective recombinant strains used in this study are referred to as Yeh2p-GFP/YEH2-GFP, His-Yeh2p/His-YEH2 and Yeh2p-protA/YEH2-protA. The correctness of insertions was tested either by resistance of strains to geneticin or by marker-dependent growth. Additionally, identity of all strains was confirmed by colony PCR.Table IPrimers used for different YEH2 constructsSequence 5′→3′pGP316+YEH2 (fw)TACCTCTATACTTTAACGTCAAGGAGAAAAAACCCCGGATCCCCCGGGCTGCAGGAATTCATGGTAAATAAGGTGGTTGATGAGGTpGP316+YEH2 (rev)GACATGGGAGATCCCGGATCATTACTTATCTAGGTCGACGGTACCGGGCCCCCCCTCGAGCCTCACCTTGCATTAGGAAACCTC-terminal GFP tag (fw)ATAGAATTGGTAAGCCAATGATAGAAAATTTGAGGTTTCCTAATGCAAGGCGGATCCCCGGGTTAATTAAC-terminal GFP tag (rev)TTATGGCATATTATATTTTACAAAGAAACCACAAAGAAAAAACTTTTACCGAATTCGAGCTCGTTTAAACN-terminal His tag + gal-prom (fw)GGGAAATACTCAACTATCATTGGGATCCCCGTGGCACCTTTACGATAAGCGAATTCGAGCTCGTTTAAACN-terminal His tag + gal-prom (rev)CGCTCACCAACCGCTGAACCTCATCAACCACCTTATTTACATGATGATGATGATGATGCATTTTGAGATCCGGGTTTT(6× Histidine introduced)gal-prom (fw)see N-terminal His tag + Gal-prom (fw)gal-prom (rev)AGAATTATTGCGCTCACCAACCGCTGAACCTCATCAACCACCTTATTTACCATTTTGAGATCCGGGTTTTC-terminal protein A (fw)ATAGAATTGGTAAGCCAATGATAGAAAATTTGAGGTTTCCTAATGCAAGGGGAGCAGGGGCGGGTGCC-terminal protein A (rev)TTATGGCATATTATATTTTACAAAGAAACCACAAAGAAAAAACTTTTACCCCCCTCGAGGTCGACGGTATCG Open table in a new tab Purification of Yeh2p—For solubilization of the protein A-tagged Yeh2p, plasma membrane preparations of the strain YEH2-protA were incubated with 5 mm sucrose monolaurate and 10% glycerol at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was saved and the solubilization step was repeated twice with the resuspended pellets. To remove low molecular weight components the combined supernatants were subjected to ultrafiltration (Microcon YM-50; Millipore). The retentate was diluted with TST (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated with an IgG Sepharose 6 Fast Flow suspension (Amersham Biosciences), which had been pre-equilibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions, in a 1-ml column (Mobicol; MoBiTec) for 2 h at 4 °C. Then, beads were washed 12 times with 1–2 bed volume(s) of TST and three times with 1–2 bed volume(s) of AcTEV (Tobacco Etch Virus) buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA). Fusion protein cleavage was performed in AcTEV buffer in the presence of AcTEV™ protease (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 30 °C as suggested by the manufacturer. The major portion of the eluate was used for enzyme analysis, and a small aliquot was precipitated with 50% trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (36.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Microscopy—For fluorescence microscopic analysis aliquots of strains YEH2-GFP grown in YPGal or His-YEH2 grown in MMGal were concentrated by centrifugation. GFP fusion proteins were visualized on a Zeiss Axiovert 35 microscope using a 100-fold oil immersion objective at a detection range between 450 and 490 nm. Lipid particles were stained with Nile Red (Sigma) by standard procedures and visualized at a range from 510 to 560 nm. Images were taken with a CCD camera. Electron Microscopy—Yeast cells grown on MMGal were sedimented by centrifugation, rinsed in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) and fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5 mm CaCl2 and 5 mm MgCl2, for 3 h at room temperature and 3 h on ice. Then, cells were washed twice with 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) and postfixed in 4% KMnO4, prepared in H2O distilled for 90 min. After rinsing the pellet four times, cells were treated with 0.5% sodium metaperiodate for 15 min at room temperature, washed once more with H2O distilled, and dispersed in a 2% agarose solution (1:1). The solidified agar containing the cells was cut into small cubes of about 1 mm3 and placed for en bloc staining into 2% uranyl acetate in H2O distilled overnight on ice. Blocks were washed with H2O distilled and dehydrated through a graded series of acetone, 10 min each, followed by three washes with 100% acetone for 15 min, each. Samples were incubated in 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2 mixtures of acetone/Spurr resin for 2 h, respectively. The last incubation step was performed overnight to allow slow evaporation of acetone. After removal of the Spurr resin, agar cubes were incubated in fresh 100% Spurr resin for another 2 h. Then, samples were placed into gelatin capsules containing fresh Spurr resin (100%) and capsules were placed in a polymerization oven at 70 °C for 48 h. Using a diamond knife (Diatome) 75-nm ultrathin sections were cut on a Leica UltracutE ultramicrotome and collected onto 75 mesh copper palladium grids with a support film of pioloform. Sections were stained in 1% uranyl acetate in H2O distilled for 20 min, washed and stained once more in lead citrate (37.Reynolds E.S. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (17824) Google Scholar). Images were produced on a Tecnai G2 12 (FEI Company) equipped with a CCD camera (Gatan Bioscan) at 100 kV. In search of STE hydrolase(s) of the yeast S. cerevisiae bioinformatic analysis identified, among several other candidate genes, the ORF YLR020c/YEH2 as a gene potentially encoding such an enzyme. Yeh2p has not been characterized by function before. This polypeptide shows similarity to human gastric lipase and lysosomal acid lipase A as well as to S. cerevisiae Tgl1p and contains an α/β hydrolase-associated lipase region in amino acid positions 146–212 (Fig. 1). Depending on the data base used for the in silicio analysis Yeh2p is predicted to harbor one or two transmembrane spanning region(s) at amino acid positions 12–31 (or 11–35) and 361–389, respectively. The assumption that Yeh2p is a membrane protein was confirmed by fluorescence microscopic inspection showing that a Yeh2p-GFP fusion protein was localized to the yeast plasma membrane (Fig. 2). Moreover, enzymatic analysis with isolated subcellular fractions demonstrated highest specific STE hydrolase activity in purified plasma membrane (Table II) thus confirming previous results from our laboratory (17.Zinser E. Paltauf F. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2853-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In summary, bioinformatic, cell biological, and biochemical evidence strongly suggested that Yeh2p is a plasma membrane-located yeast STE hydrolase.Fig. 2Yeh2p-GFP is localized to yeast plasma membrane.

ASAP1 (Arf-GAP containing SH3, ankyrin repeats, and PH domain) is a phospholipid-dependent Arf GTPase-activating protein (Arf-GAP) that binds to protein-tyrosine kinases Src and focal adhesion kinase. Using affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry (MS), we identified the adaptor protein CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) as a candidate binding partner of ASAP1. Both co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down experiments confirmed that CD2AP stably interacts with ASAP1 through its N-terminal SH3 domains. Using a mislocalization strategy, we show that sequestration of endogenous ASAP1 to mitochondria with a CD2AP SH3-mito fusion protein (the three N-terminal SH3 domains of CD2AP fused to Listeria monocytogenes ActA mitochondria-targeting sequence) inhibited REF52 cell spreading and migration in response to fibronectin stimulation. Using an alternative strategy we show that suppressing ASAP1 expression with small interfering RNA duplexes also significantly retarded cell spreading and inhibited cell migration. Furthermore, abrogation of ASAP1 function using either small interfering RNAs or mislocalization approaches caused an increase of GTP loading on Arf1 and loss of paxillin from adhesions. These results taken together with our previous observations that overexpression of ASAP1 inhibits cell spreading and alters paxillin localization to adhesions (Liu, Y., Loijens, J. C., Martin, K. H., Karginov, A. V., and Parsons, J. T. (2002) Mol. Biol. Cell. 13, 2147–2156) suggest that the recruitment of certain adhesion components such as paxillin requires dynamic GTP/GDP turnover of Arf1 GTPase.

Cell. 13, 2147–2156) suggest that the recruitment of certain adhesion components such as paxillin requires dynamic GTP/GDP turnover of Arf1 GTPase. Cell migration is a cyclic process comprising of four basic steps: adhesion, attachment, translocation, and retraction of the rear (1Webb D.J. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 2Ridley A.J. Schwartz M.A. Burridge K. Firtel R.A. Ginsberg M.H. Borisy G. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.R. Science. 2003; 302: 1704-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (3765) Google Scholar). Among the many events that are regulated during the migratory cycle, coordinated regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, formation, turnover and maturation of adhesion structures, coordinated translocation of intracellular vesicles have been studied as key events in the process. Of increasing importance is elucidating how membrane internalized from the cell surface is trafficked to the leading edge of migrating cells to fulfill the requirement of surface area increase as a result of cell front extension (3Bretscher M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 601-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). An understanding of the coordination between membrane traffic, cell adhesion, and actin re-organization has been facilitated by the identification and characterization of ADP-ribosylation factors (Arfs), 1The abbreviations used are: Arf, ADP-ribosylation factor; ASAP1, Arf-GAP containing SH3, ankyrin repeats and pleckstrin homology domain; CD2AP, CD2-associated protein; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PH, pleckstrin homology; REF, rat embryo fibroblasts; SH3, Src homology 3; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGF, epidermal growth factor.1The abbreviations used are: Arf, ADP-ribosylation factor; ASAP1, Arf-GAP containing SH3, ankyrin repeats and pleckstrin homology domain; CD2AP, CD2-associated protein; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PH, pleckstrin homology; REF, rat embryo fibroblasts; SH3, Src homology 3; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGF, epidermal growth factor. a family of small GTP-binding proteins. The Arf family members were originally identified as co-factors for cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP ribosylation of Gs (4Kahn R.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7906-7911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primary physiological function of Arfs, however, is to regulate endocytosis and vesicle trafficking by controlling the interaction of coat proteins with intracellular organelle membranes (5Donaldson J.G. Cassel D. Kahn R.A. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6408-6412Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 6Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E.

More recently, Arfs have also been implicated in the regulation of cytoskeletal remodeling (8D'Souza-Schorey C. Boshans R.L. McDonough M. Stahl P.D. Van Aelst L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5445-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 9Norman J.C. Jones D. Barry S.T. Holt M.R. Cockcroft S. Critchley D.R. J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 41573-41576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), although the mechanisms by which they act are poorly understood. Arf1, the prototypic member of this family, is reported to mediate the recruitment of paxillin to focal adhesions and to facilitate Rho-stimulated stress fiber formation in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (9Norman J.C. Jones D. Barry S.T. Holt M.R. Cockcroft S. Critchley D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1981-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Arf6, the least conserved member of the Arf family, cycles between plasma membrane and endocytic compartments, depending on its nucleotide status (12Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Both the constitutively active and the dominant negative forms of Arf6 cause pronounced cell morphology changes when overexpressed in cells (8D'Souza-Schorey C. Boshans R.L. McDonough M. Stahl P.D. Van Aelst L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5445-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 10Song J. Khachikian Z. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2257-2267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that Arf6 functions primarily through the activation of lipid-modifying enzymes such as phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase and the modulation of actin cytoskeleton (11Donaldson J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41573-41576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 13Honda A. Nogami M. Yokozeki T. Yamazaki M. Nakamura H. Watanabe H. Kawamoto K. Nakayama K. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Kanaho Y. Cell. 1999; 99: 521-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Arf6 also plays a role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis by recruiting Nm23-H1, a nucleoside diphosphate kinase, which provides a source of GTP for dynamin-dependent fission of coated vesicles (14Palacios F. Schweitzer J.K. Boshans R.L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The dual functions of Arf GTPases in both vesicle trafficking and actin cytoskeletal remodeling point to these proteins being candidates for the coordinators that regulate critical steps during cell migration.Evidence for Arfs as regulators of adhesion also comes from the identification of proteins with Arf-GAP homology that bind to focal adhesion components. Paxillin kinase linker, also known as GIT (G protein-coupled receptor interacting target) 2/CAT (cool-associated, tyrosine-phosphorylated) 2, binds directly to the LD4 domain of paxillin and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor p21-activated kinase-interacting exchange factor and thus mediates the association of paxillin with a complex composed of p21-activated kinase, Nck, and p21-activated kinase-interacting exchange factor (15Turner C.E. Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Riedy M.C. Nikolopoulos S.N. McDonald A.R. Bagrodia S. Thomas S. Leventhal P.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). A paxillin kinase linker-related Arf-GAP, GIT1, binds to paxillin and FAK and its overexpression causes a loss of paxillin from focal adhesions (16Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Loo T.H. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6354-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The inhibition of paxillin localization to adhesions is also observed upon overexpressing another distantly related Arf-GAP ASAP1 (Arf-GAP containing SH3 domain, ankyrin repeats, and PH domain) (17Liu Y. Loijens J.C. Martin K.H. Karginov A.V. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2147-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). ASAP1 is found in perinuclear regions, membrane ruffles, and focal adhesions (17Liu Y. Loijens J.C. Martin K.H. Karginov A.V. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2147-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 18Brown M.T. Andrade J. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. Cooper J.A. Randazzo P.A. Mol. Cell.

Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2147-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and overexpression of ASAP1 inhibits cell spreading and platelet-derived growth factor-induced dorsal ruffles (17Liu Y.

An ASAP1-related protein PAPα (Pyk2 C terminus associated protein α)/KIAA0400 interacts with the FAK-related protein-tyrosine kinase Pyk2 (20Andreev J. Simon J.P. Sabatini D.D. Kam J. Plowman G. Randazzo P.A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2338-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and paxillin (21Kondo A. Hashimoto S. Yano H. Nagayama K. Mazaki Y. Sabe H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PAPα inhibits paxillin recruitment to focal contacts (21Kondo A. Hashimoto S. Yano H. Nagayama K. Mazaki Y. Sabe H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), a phenotype common to overexpression of GIT1 and ASAP1. The phenotypes caused by these Arf-GAPs are likely because of the down-regulation of Arfs activity. However, the multidomain nature of ASAP1-type Arf-GAPs suggests that they may possess other functions in addition to modulating Arf activity in vivo.Here we show a requirement for ASAP1, a focal adhesion-enriched Arf-GAP, in integrin signaling. We identified CD2AP/CMS (Cas ligand with multiple SH3 domains), an SH3 domain-containing adaptor protein that interacts with ASAP1 via its N-terminal SH3 domains. Using a mislocalization strategy, we show that sequestration of endogenous ASAP1 to mitochondria with a CD2AP SH3-mito fusion protein (the three N-terminal SH3 domains of CD2AP fused to Listeria monocytogenes ActA mitochondria-targeting sequence) (22Bear J.E. Loureiro J.J. Libova I. Fassler R. Wehland J. Gertler F.B. Cell. 2000; 101: 717-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) inhibited REF52 cell spreading and migration in response to fibronectin stimulation. Using an alternative strategy we show that suppressing ASAP1 expression with siRNAs also significantly retarded cell spreading and inhibited cell migration. Furthermore, abrogation of ASAP1 function with either siRNAs or mislocalization approaches resulted in an increase of GTP loading on Arf1 and loss of paxillin from adhesions. These results taken together with our previous observations that overexpression of ASAP1 inhibits cell spreading and disturbs paxillin localization to adhesions (17Liu Y. Loijens J.C. Martin K.H. Karginov A.V. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2147-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) indicate that the recruitment of certain adhesion components, such as paxillin, requires dynamic turnover of Arf1 GTPase. In addition, under conditions in which paxillin recruitment to cell adhesions was compromised, tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin was not substantially affected. These seemingly contradictory observations raise the possibility that the regulation of Arf1 GTPase by ASAP1 plays an important role in the stabilization of paxillin in newly formed adhesions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA Constructs—The mouse ASAP1 mammalian expression construct pFlagASAP1 was a gift from Paul A. Randazzo (National Institutes of Health). This construct was generated by subcloning an N-terminal FLAG tag and the mouse ASAP1 cDNA into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) (18Brown M.T. Andrade J. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. Cooper J.A. Randazzo P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7038-7051Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The mouse CD2AP sequence was generously provided by Andrey S. Shaw (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). To generate FLAG-tagged full-length SH3ABC and ΔSH3 variants of CD2AP, standard PCR was carried out. The PCR products were digested with BamHI and NotI and subcloned into pFlag2AB (23Devarajan P. Stabach P.R. De Matteis M.A. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10711-10716Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The glutathione S-transferase (GST)-CD2AP SH3 constructs were generated by sub-cloning the corresponding BamHI/NotI fragments into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The Listeria ActA mitochondria-targeting sequence (mito) (22Bear J.E. Loureiro J.J. Libova I. Fassler R. Wehland J. Gertler F.B. Cell. 2000; 101: 717-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) was provided by Frank B. Gertler (MIT). Amino acids 361–610 of ActA were amplified with PCR and subcloned into the XbaI and BclI sites of pEGFP-C1 (BD Biosciences) to create GFP-mito. To make the GFP-SH3ABC-mito construct, the three N-terminal SH3 domains of CD2AP were amplified and inserted into the XhoI and BamHI sites of GFP-mito. The hemagglutinin-tagged Arf1 variants (wild type, Q71L, and T31N) and the GST-GGA expression vector were provided by James E. Casanova (University of Virginia).Identification of ASAP1 Binding Partners by Affinity Chromatography—HEK293 cells were grown to 80% confluence and transfected with FLAG-tagged ASAP1. 24 h after transfection, cells were lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.05 units/ml of aprotinin, 1 mm sodium vanadate). Affinity purification, sequencing, and MS analysis of ASAP1-binding proteins were performed as described previously (24Weed S.A. Karginov A.V. Schafer D.A. Weaver A.M. Kinley A.W. Cooper J.A. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar).In Vitro Binding Assays and GST-GGA Pull-down Assays—GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 Escherichia coli and purified using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Equal amounts of GST fusion proteins or GST alone (5 μg) were incubated with 500 μl of 1 mg/ml cell lysates in modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (RIPA) (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.05 units/ml of aprotinin, 1 mm sodium vanadate) at 4 °C for 1.5 h. The beads were washed twice with modified RIPA buffer and once with Tris-buffered saline. Associated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using an anti-ASAP1 polyclonal antibody. To measure intracellular levels of Arf1-GTP, GST-GGA pull-down assays were performed as described previously (25Santy L.C. Casanova J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 599-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar).Antibodies and Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—The anti-ASAP1 rabbit polyclonal antibody was a generous gift from Paul A. Randazzo (National Institutes of Health). The anti-ASAP1 mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) was purchased from BD Biosciences. Anti-CD2AP rabbit polyclonal antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz. Anti-FLAG mAb M5 was purchased from Sigma. Anti-paxillin mAb, anti-FAK mAb, and anti-GFP mAb were purchased from BD Biosciences. Anti-paxillin phospho-Tyr31 and phospho-Tyr118 were purchased from BioSource Inc. Erk1 mAb was a gift from M. J. Weber (University of Virginia). Anti-hemagglutinin and anti-Arf1 polyclonal antibodies were provided by James E. Casanova (University of Virginia). Voltage-dependent anion channel polyclonal antibody was a product from Oncogene Research Products.To immunoprecipitate endogenous ASAP1, 5 μg of anti-ASAP1 mAb was incubated with 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 50 μl of anti-mouse IgG-coupled agarose beads (Sigma) at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed 3 times with cold PBS and incubated with 750 μg of clarified cell lysates at 4 °C for 2 h. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with 1.0 ml of lysis buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and Western blotted with anti-CD2AP antibody. Antibody binding was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit IgG followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). To immunoprecipitate endogenous CD2AP, a similar procedure was followed except that polyclonal anti-CD2AP antibody was coupled onto 50 μl of Protein A-conjugated-Sepharose beads (Sigma). To immunoprecipitate FLAG-tagged CD2AP variants, 20 μl of M2-agarose (Sigma) was incubated with 500 μg of clarified cell lysates in lysis buffer at 4 °C for 2 h and the immune complexes were subsequently subjected to the washing steps as described above.Cell Culture, Transfection, and Immunofluorescence Microscopy— HEK293 and REF52 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 10 μg/ml penicillin, and 0.25 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). For transient transfection experiments, cells were grown to ∼70% confluence in 100-mm dishes and transfected with 4 μg of DNA using Poly-Fect™ (Qiagen). Twenty-four hours after transfection, REF52 cells were trypsinized and replated on fibronectin in DMEM, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and immunostained as described previously (26Weed S.A. Du Y. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2433-2443PubMed Google Scholar).Mitochondria Staining, Fractionation, and Cell Spreading Assay—To visualize the subcellular localization of mitochondria, prewarmed DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum containing 125 nm Mito-Tracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes) was added onto REF52 cells previously plated on fibronectin. After 40 min incubation at 37 °C, the medium was removed and the cells were washed and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde as described above. The mitochondria and the GFP fusion proteins carrying mito-targeting sequence were detected with fluorescence microscopy. The mitochondria fractions from whole cell lysates were prepared using the procedure of Eskes et al. (27Eskes R. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar) with a modified mitochondria homogenization buffer (0.2 m mannitol, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 50 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA supplemented with proteases inhibitors). For cell spreading assays, REF52 cells were trypsinized and re-plated on fibronectin for the indicated times 24 h after transfection. The quantitation of cell spreading was performed as described previously (17Liu Y. Loijens J.C. Martin K.H. Karginov A.V. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2147-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 28Richardson A. Parsons T. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar).Cell Migration Assays—Cell migration was assessed using modified Transwell chambers (8 μm pores, BD Biosciences) as described previously (29Slack J.K. Catling A.D. Eblen S.T. Weber M.J. Parsons J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27177-27184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To assess fibronectin-stimulated haptotaxis, the underside of the membrane was coated with 1.5 μg/ml fibronectin suspended in PBS in the lower chamber and PBS was placed in the upper chamber. After incubating the chambers overnight at 4 °C, the fibronectin solution was removed and DMEM was added to each chamber. For EGF-mediated chemotaxis, DMEM supplemented with 10 ng/ml EGF was added to the lower chamber and unsupplemented DMEM was added to the upper chamber. REF52 cells (1 × 105) were suspended in the upper chamber and allowed to migrate for 6 h at 37 °C. Nonmigrating cells were removed with a cotton swab. Cells migrating through the membrane were washed twice with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min, and counted under a Zeiss Axiovert 135TV inverted microscope. Nontransfected cells were stained with crystal violet prior to counting to aid in visualization.Preparation of siRNAs and Transfection—Target specific siRNA duplexes with symmetric 3′ dTdT overhangs were synthesized by Dharmacon. Two siRNA sequences were selected from position 902–920 (5′-CAGCUAACUGCACUCCGAG-3′) and position 1642–1660 (5′-UGAUAUUAUGGAAGCAAAU-3′) of mouse ASAP1b (GenBank™ accession number AF075462). Both siRNA duplexes reduced ASAP1 expression to a similar extent and induced similar cellular phenotypes. Transient transfection of REF52 cells with siRNAs was performed using a calcium phosphate protocol (30Wigler M. Pellicer A. Silverstein S. Axel R. Cell. 1978; 14: 725-731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar).Statistical Analysis—Each experimental group was analyzed using single factor analysis of variance. p values were obtained by performing two-tailed Student's t test using Microsoft Excel software. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05.RESULTSIdentification of Arf-GAP ASAP1 Binding Partners—To better understand the role of ASAP1 in cellular processes regulating dynamic actin organization, we exploited affinity chromatography and MS to identify proteins that interact with full-length ASAP1 (Fig. 1). Using FLAG-tagged ASAP1 coupled to agarose beads, several proteins were identified as ASAP1 binding partners. MS analysis revealed sequence matches with known binding partners for ASAP1 such as FAK, as well as a novel binding protein, an 80-kDa adaptor protein CD2AP/CMS, hereafter referred to as CD2AP (Fig. 1B). Peptides identified by MS represent 42% coverage of full-length CD2AP. To further validate this interaction, FLAG-ASAP1 was immunoprecipitated from extracts of HEK293 cells and ASAP1 was recovered by elution with two sequential applications of FLAG peptide followed by elution with 1% SDS. The individual fractions were analyzed with SDS-PAGE and Western blotting along with lysate control (Fig. 1C). As shown in Fig. 1C, the profile of CD2AP elution paralleled that of FLAG-tagged ASAP1, indicating CD2AP stably associates with ASAP1.CD2AP Associates with ASAP1 in Vivo—To demonstrate that CD2AP and ASAP1 form stable complexes within the cell, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Endogenous ASAP1 was immunoprecipitated from HEK293 cell lysates using an ASAP1-specific antibody. Endogenous CD2AP was readily detected in ASAP1 immune complexes as revealed by blotting with a CD2AP-specific antibody (Fig. 2A, lane 2). The association of ASAP1 with both FAK (17Liu Y. Loijens J.C. Martin K.H. Karginov A.V. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2147-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and CD2AP raises the possibility that localization of ASAP1 within the cell is spatially controlled by its binding partners. As shown in Fig. 2B, when endogenous ASAP1 was immunoprecipitated from HEK293 cell lysates, both FAK and CD2AP were found in the immune complexes. However, in a reciprocal experiment, only ASAP1, not FAK was detected in CD2AP immunoprecipitation complexes (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that intracellular ASAP1 is present in at least two pools, one associated with FAK, the other with CD2AP.Fig. 2Co-immunoprecipitation (IP) of CD2AP and ASAP1.A, endogenous ASAP1 was immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of HEK293 whole cell lysate using an anti-ASAP1 antibody. The presence of endogenous CD2AP in the immune complexes was assessed using a rabbit anti-CD2AP antibody. The blot was stripped and the efficiency of ASAP1 immunoprecipitation was determined by blotting with anti-ASAP1 antibody. In lane 1, 25 μg of whole cell lysates were analyzed for protein expression. B, endogenous ASAP1 was immunoprecipitated as in A and the presence of endogenous CD2AP and FAK in the immune complexes was determined using CD2AP-specific and FAK-specific antibodies, respectively. C, endogenous CD2AP was immunoprecipitated from extracts of HEK293 cells using an anti-CD2AP antibody.

To map the ASAP1-binding site on CD2AP, three FLAG-tagged CD2AP variants encompassing the full-length, the N-terminal region, or the C-terminal moiety of CD2AP were expressed in HEK293 cells, immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, and assayed for the presence of ASAP1. As shown in Fig. 3A, endogenous ASAP1 bound to the full-length and the N-terminal variants of CD2AP in approximately equal amounts (lanes 3 and 6), whereas the C-terminal variant of CD2AP failed to associate with ASAP1 (lane 9). These data show that CD2AP interacts with ASAP1 through its N-terminal SH3 domains.Fig. 3The N-terminal SH3 domains of CD2AP interact with ASAP1.A, FLAG-tagged full-length CD2AP and N-terminal SH3ABC variant and the C-terminal ΔSH3 variant (Fig. 1A), were transfected into HEK293 cells. The exogenously expressed CD2AP variants were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads. Bound proteins were recovered with protein sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. The presence of endogenous ASAP1 in the immune complexes was analyzed using ASAP1-specific antibody (IP, lanes 3, 6, and 9). Aliquots (25 μg) of cell lysate (L, lanes 1, 4, and 7) and flow-through (FL, lanes 2, 5, and 8) were analyzed to assess the efficiency of the immunoprecipitation. B, to map the targeting site of ASAP1, variants of CD2AP-SH3 domains (SH3A, lane 3; SH3B, lane 4; SH3C, lane 5; SH3ABC, lane 6) were fused to GST. The GST fusion proteins were incubated with 500 μg of HEK293 cell lysates as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The associated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using an anti-ASAP1 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The N-terminal region of CD2AP contains three SH3 domains (Fig. 1A, designated as SH3A, -B, and -C, respectively).

Both lectins bind, cross-link, and precipitate with carbohydrates possessing multiple terminal nonreducing Man residues. The present study investigates the binding and cross-linking interactions of ConA and DGL with a series of synthetic divalent carbohydrates that possess spacer groups with increasing flexibility and length between terminal α-mannopyranoside residues. Isothermal titration microcalorimetry was used to determine the thermodynamics of binding of the two lectins to the divalent analogs, and kinetic light scattering and electron microscopy studies were used to characterize the cross-linking interactions of the lectins with the carbohydrates. The results demonstrated that divalent analogs with flexible spacer groups between the two terminal Man residues possess higher affinities for the two lectins as compared with those with inflexible spacer groups. Furthermore, despite their high degree of homology, ConA and DGL exhibit differences in their kinetics of cross-linking and precipitation with the divalent analogs. Electron microscopy shows the loss of organized cross-linked lattices of the two lectins with analogs possessing increased distance between the terminal Man residues. The loss of lattice patterns with the analogs is distinct for each lectin.

The loss of lattice patterns with the analogs is distinct for each lectin. These results have important implications for the interactions of lectins with multivalent carbohydrate receptors in biological systems. Lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins that are widely conserved in nature, such as those in animals, plants, and microorganisms (1Varki A. Cummings R. Esko J. Freeze H. Hart G. Marth J. Essentials of Glycobiology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1999Google Scholar). The biological activities of many animal lectins have been determined, including receptor-mediated endocytosis of glycoproteins, cellular recognition and adhesion (cf. Ref. 2Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 237-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar), regulation of inflammation (3Liu F.-T. Clin.

A common feature of lectins is their multivalent binding properties (6Rini J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 7Loris R. Hamelryck T. Bouckaert J. Wyns L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1383: 9-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). As a consequence, lectin binding to cells leads to cross-linking and aggregation of glycoprotein and glycolipid receptors. In many cases, these interactions are associated with signal transduction effects, including the arrest of bulk transport in ganglion cell axons (8Edmonds B.T. Koenig E. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1990; 17: 106-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), molecular sorting of glycoproteins in the secretory pathways of cells (9Chung K.-N. Walter P. Aponte G.W. Moore H.-P.

Thus, the carbohydrate cross-linking properties of lectins are a key feature of their biological activities. The cross-linking properties of a variety of plant and animal lectins with multivalent carbohydrates and glycoproteins have recently been reviewed (15Dam T.K. Brewer C.F. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 362: 455-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Studies show that a number of lectins form homogeneous cross-linked complexes with branched chain oligosaccharides and glycoproteins. For example, quantitative precipitation experiments with the Man/Glc-specific lectin concanavalin A (ConA) 1The abbreviations used are: ConA, concanavalin A; DGL, Dioclea grandiflora lectin; αMDM, methyl α-d-mannopyranoside; ITC, isothermal titration microcalorimetry; EM, electron microscopy. in the presence of binary mixtures of a series of bivalent N-linked oligomannose glycopeptides indicate that each glycopeptide forms its own unique cross-linked complex with the lectin (16Bhattacharyya L. Khan M.I. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8762-8767Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Subsequent x-ray crystallographic studies have demonstrated different lattice structures of crystalline cross-linked complexes of the soybean agglutinin with four different divalent carbohydrates (17Olsen L.R. Dessen A. Gupta D. Sabesan S. Sacchettini J.C. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15073-15080Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The different lattice structures are due to differences in the structures of the cross-linking carbohydrates (17Olsen L.R. Dessen A. Gupta D. Sabesan S. Sacchettini J.C. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15073-15080Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The ability to form unique cross-linked complexes with glycoconjugates and to separate different counter-receptors into homogeneous cross-linked aggregates has recently been implicated in the apoptotic activity of galectin-1, a member of the β-galactosidase-specific animal lectin family (18Pace K.E. Lee C. Stewart P.L. Baum L.G. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3801-3811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, galectin-3, another member of the galectin family, has been shown to form disorganized, heterogeneous cross-linked complexes with multivalent carbohydrates (19Ahmad N. Gabius H.-J. André S. Kaltner H. Sabesan S. Roy R. Liu B. Macaluso F. Brewer C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10841-10847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The biological properties of galectin-3, including its anti-apoptotic activities (20Liu F.-T. Patterson R.J. Wang J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) and ability to antagonize the growth inhibitory activity of galectin-1 in neuroblastoma cells (21Kopitz J. von Reitzenstein C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 35917-35923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), may relate to its ability to randomly cross-link glycoconjugates and prevent separation of different receptors. Hence, the ability of lectins to form organized or disorganized cross-linked complexes with multivalent glycoconjugate receptors, such as galectin-1 and -3, respectively, may relate to their biological activities. In the present study, we investigated the effects of varying the flexibility and distance between terminal Man residues in divalent carbohydrate analogs on their binding thermodynamics and cross-linking interactions with ConA and the lectin from Dioclea grandiflora (DGL). Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), kinetic light scattering, and electron microscopy (EM) studies were used to characterize these interactions. The results demonstrated that the thermodynamics of binding and cross-linking properties of the two lectins are sensitive to the flexibility and spacing between the carbohydrate epitopes of the analogs. ConA was purchased from Sigma and/or prepared from jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis) seeds (Sigma) according to the method of Agrawal and Goldstein (22Agrawal B.B.L. Goldstein I.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 147: 262-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The concentration of ConA was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using A1%,1 cm = 13.7 and 12.4 at pH 7.2 and 5.2, respectively (23Goldstein I.J. Poretz R.D. Liener I.E. Sharon N. Goldstein I.J. The Lectins. Academic Press, Inc., New York1986: 35-244Google Scholar), and expressed in terms of monomer (Mr = 25,600). DGL was isolated from D. grandiflora seeds obtained from northeastern Brazil (Albano Ferreira Martin Ltd., São Paulo, Brazil) as described previously (24Moreira R.A. Barros A.C.H. Stewart J.C. Pusztai A. Planta. 1983; 158: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The concentration of DGL was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using A1%,1 cm = 12.0 at pH 7.2 and expressed in terms of monomer (Mr = 25,000) (24Moreira R.A. Barros A.C.H. Stewart J.C. Pusztai A. Planta. 1983; 158: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). αMDM was purchased from Sigma. The synthesis of carbohydrate analogs 1, 2, 3, and 4 has been reported previously (25Roy R. Das S.K. Dominique R. Trono M.C. Mateo F.H. Gonzalez F.S. Pure Appl. Chem. 1999; 71: 565-571Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar), as have analogs 9–13 (26Page D. Roy R. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Synthesis of 5–8 will be reported elsewhere. The concentrations of carbohydrates were determined by modification of the Dubois phenolsulfuric acid method (27Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (41132) Google Scholar, 28Saha S.K. Brewer C.F. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 254: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) using appropriate monosaccharides as standards. Structures of these analogs are shown in Figs. 1 and 2.Fig. 2Structures of bivalent mannosides 5–13.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Isothermal Titration Microcalorimetry—ITC experiments were performed using an MCS ITC instrument from Microcal, Inc. (Northampton, MA). Injections of 4 ml of carbohydrate solution were added from a computer-controlled 250- or 100-μl microsyringe at an interval of 4 min into the sample solution of lectin (cell volume = 1.34 ml) with stirring at 350 revolutions/min. An example of an ITC experiment is shown in Fig. 3 for bivalent analog 11 with ConA at 27 °C. Control experiments performed by making identical injections of saccharide into a cell containing buffer without protein showed insignificant heats of dilution. The concentrations of lectins were 0.1–0.19 mm, and the sugars were 1.0–6.0 mm, respectively. Titrations were done at pH 5.0–5.2 and at NaCl concentrations from 0.05 to 0.15 m. The experimental data were fitted to a theoretical titration curve using software supplied by Microcal, with ΔH (enthalpy change in kcal/mol), Ka (association constant in m–1), and n (number of binding sites/monomer) as adjustable parameters. The quantity c = Ka Mt(0), where Mt(0) is the initial macromolecule concentration, is of importance in titration microcalorimetry (29Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandt J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2446) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed with c values 1 < c < 200. The instrument was calibrated using the calibration kit containing ribonuclease A (RNase A) and cytidine 2′-monophosphate (2′-CMP) supplied by the manufacturer microcal. Thermodynamic parameters were calculated from the equation ΔG =ΔH – TΔS =–RT ln Ka, where ΔG, ΔH, and ΔS are the changes in free energy, enthalpy, and entropy of binding, respectively, T is the absolute temperature, and R = 1.98 cal mol–1 K–1. Kinetics of Precipitation—Measured volumes of lectin and saccharide solution at stoichiometric concentration (2:1) were mixed in a 1-ml quartz cuvette, and the time-dependent development of turbidity was measured at 420 nm (30Bhattacharyya L. Fant J. Lonn H. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7523-7530Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The buffer was Hepes (0.1 m Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MnCl2, pH 7.2). All experiments were done at room temperature. Absorbances were monitored continuously until they remained constant for 30 min. After each experiment, a portion of the precipitate was treated with 100 mm αMDM to check whether or not the precipitation was due to the binding of the saccharides. Electron Microscopy—Negative stain electron microscopy of the precipitates was performed by placing the samples on 300-mesh carboncoated Parlodion grids that had been freshly glow-discharged for 2 min, touched to filter paper and floated on a drop of 1% phosphotungstic acid, pH 7.0, and blotted immediately. The samples were observed at 80 kV in a JEOL 1200EX electron microscope. Thermodynamics of Binding of ConA and DGL to Analogs 1–13—At pH 5.0 and low salt concentrations, both ConA and DGL are dimers and do not precipitate with analogs 1–13. Hence, ITC studies were performed under these conditions. ITC data for ConA binding to 1–13 at 300 K are shown in Table I. Ka values for 1–4 are very similar and nearly twice as great as that of the monosaccharide αMDM. Ka values for 5–13 are nearly 4–6 times greater than that of αMDM. The –ΔH values for ConA binding to 1–13 are greater than that of αMDM, with values for 1–4 generally lower than those of 6–13. The n values for ConA binding to 1–13 are between 0.68 and 0.52, as compared with 1.0 for αMDM.Table IThermodynamic binding parameters for ConA with bivalent sugars at pH 5.0, 27 °CKacErrors in Ka range from 1 to 7%.-ΔGdErrors in ΔG are < 1%.-ΔHeErrors in ΔH are 1-4%.-TΔSfErrors in TΔS are 1-7%.ngErrors in n are <2%.M-1 × 10-4kcal / molkcal / molkcal / molsites / monomerαMDMaαMDM, methyl α-d-mannopyranoside.1.25.68.42.81.012.36.011.25.20.6222.56.014.18.10.523bData taken from Ref. 32.2.25.912.76.70.594bData taken from Ref. 32.2.56.011.45.40.6754.36.310.34.00.6864.76.413.47.00.6174.96.414.78.30.578bData taken from Ref. 32.5.36.515.28.70.549bData taken from Ref. 32.4.76.417.010.60.5210bData taken from Ref. 32.5.46.516.610.10.52116.76.615.48.80.5812bData taken from Ref. 32.6.86.614.37.70.60135.36.515.99.40.57a αMDM, methyl α-d-mannopyranoside.b Data taken from Ref. 32Dam T.K.

Analog 11 showed the slowest precipitation kinetics, with 9, 12, and 10 showing increasing rates of precipitation. Fig. 5b shows the time-dependent light-scattering profile of 90 μm DGL with 45 μm each of 9–12 at pH 7.2, room temperature. The kinetic precipitation profile of 10 is slowest, with 9 somewhat faster. Analogs 11 and 12 precipitate much faster with DGL as compared with 9 and 10. Analogs 5–8 also showed unique kinetics of precipitation with the two lectins under the above conditions (data not shown). Electron Micrographs of the Precipitates of ConA and DGL with 1–13—Negative stain electron micrographs of the precipitates of ConA and DGL with 1, 2, and 3 are shown in Fig. 6. Patterns are observed for all three precipitates of ConA, whereas patterns are observed for the precipitates of DGL with 1 and 3 but not for 2. ConA and DGL precipitates with 4 failed to show patterns. Fig. 7 shows negative stain electron micrographs of the precipitates of ConA with 5, 6, and 7 and DGL with 5 and 6. The precipitates of ConA with 5–7 all show observable lattice patterns, whereas the precipitates of DGL with 5 and 6 also show lattice patterns. The precipitates of DGL with 7 failed to show a pattern. The precipitates of ConA and DGL with 8 also failed to show a pattern. Fig. 8 shows negative stain electron micrographs of the precipitates of ConA with 9, 10, and 11, and the precipitates of DGL with 9–13. Although the precipitates of ConA with 9, 10, and 11 showed lattice patterns, the precipitates of ConA with 12 and 13 failed to show patterns. All of the precipitates of DGL with 9–13 showed lattice patterns. ConA and DGL are highly homologous lectins with 81% similarities in amino acid sequences and identical quaternary structures and subunit composition (cf. Ref. 31Rozwarski D.A. Swami B.M. Brewer C.F.

Roy R. Das S.K. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14223-14230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The results for αMDM show n values for both lectins close to 1.0, demonstrating that the monosaccharide binds as a monovalent ligand to both proteins. The ΔH values of –8.4 and –8.2 kcal/mol for ConA and DGL, respectively, are similar, as are the Ka values of 1.2 × 104m–1 and 0.46 × 104m–1, respectively. Analogs 1–13 show enhanced affinities relative to αMDM for ConA and DGL and different ΔH and n values. Previous ITC studies have shown that the value of n is inversely proportional to the functional valency of carbohydrate ligands for lectins (32Dam T.K. Roy R. Das S.K. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14223-14230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Values of n of 0.5 have been observed for higher affinity carbohydrate ligands binding to ConA and DGL, with values between 0.5 and 0.8 for lower affinity bivalent ligands due to incomplete binding of the second epitope (32Dam T.K. Roy R. Das S.K. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14223-14230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The n values for ConA and DGL in Tables I and II, respectively, are consistent with lower affinity divalent carbohydrates binding to both lectins. The greater –ΔH values for 1–13 binding to both lectins, relative to αMDM, are also consistent with divalent binding of the analogs (32Dam T.K. Roy R. Das S.K. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14223-14230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the enhanced Ka values of both lectins for 1–13 appear to cluster into two groups for each lectin. Analogs 1–4 show approximate 2-fold enhanced affinities for ConA, and 3–4-fold enhanced affinities for DGL, relative to αMDM. On the other hand, analogs 5–13 show enhanced affinities of 4–6-fold for ConA, and 5–20-fold for DGL, relative to αMDM (the exception is 9, which possesses ∼3-fold higher affinity). Thus, 1–4 possess smaller enhanced affinities for both lectins as compared with 5–13. The most obvious structural differences between these two groups of bivalent analogs is the flexibility of the linker regions between the outer two Man residues in each molecule. Analogs 1–4 possess relatively ridged linkers consisting of one or two acetylenic groups with or without a phenyl group, whereas 5–8 and 10–13 possess relatively flexible methylene groups. 9 is absent a methylene group between the two aryl glycoside moieties, which may be part of the reason for its relatively modest enhanced affinity for DGL in that group. Thus, the degree of flexibility of the spacer groups of the analogs appears to modulate their enhanced affinities for ConA and DGL. Kinetics of Precipitation of ConA and DGL with Analogs 1–13—At pH 7.0 and high salt concentration, ConA and DGL are tetramers and precipitate with analogs 1–13. The kinetics of precipitation of both lectins with the analogs is shown in the time-dependent light-scattering profiles in Figs. 4 and 5. Because the concentrations of the two lectins and the concentrations of the analogs are the same, a comparison of the precipitation rate profiles of different analogs with the two lectins can be made. Differences in the precipitation rates are due to several factors, including the affinities of the analogs, the rates of formation of soluble cross-linked complexes, and the solubility constants of their cross-linked lattices. Fig. 4a shows the kinetics of cross-linking and precipitation of ConA with analogs 1–4. Analog 1 shows the slowest rate of precipitation with ConA followed by 4, 3, and 2, respectively. Analog 3, however, shows a greater degree of precipitation with ConA than 2. Thus, the effects of different spacer groups of the analogs are observed in their kinetics and extent of precipitation with ConA. Fig. 4b shows the time-dependent light-scattering profiles of DGL with 1–4. Although analog 1 is the slowest to precipitate with DGL, similar to ConA, the order of kinetics and extent of precipitation of DGL with 2–4 is different from that with ConA. Analogs 3 and 4 show the fastest and largest degree of precipitation of DGL, whereas 2 and 3 are fastest with ConA. Thus, the different spacer groups of analogs 1–4 exhibit different kinetics and extents of precipitation with ConA and DGL, even though the structures of the two proteins are very similar (31Rozwarski D.A. Swami B.M. Brewer C.F. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32818-32825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows the time-dependent light-scattering profiles of ConA and DGL with analogs 9–12, respectively. Similar to 1–4, analogs 9–12 show differential kinetics and the extent of precipitation with ConA and DGL. Furthermore, the relative kinetics and extent of precipitation of the analogs differs for the two lectins. These results are similar to those of analogs 1–4 with the two lectins. These results demonstrate that differences in the structures of the two lectins affect their kinetics of cross-linking interactions with 1–4 and 9–12 (Figs. 4 and 5). Electron Microscopy of the Cross-linked Lattices of ConA and DGL with 1–13—We have previously used negative stain EM to observe the presence of organized lattices in cross-linked complexes of lectins with multivalent carbohydrates (cf. Ref. 15Dam T.K. Brewer C.F. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 362: 455-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the present study, differences in the spacer groups in 1–13 are observed to affect the structures of their cross-linked complexes with ConA and DGL (15Dam T.K. Brewer C.F. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 362: 455-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For example, ConA shows EM patterns for precipitates with 1–3, 5–7, and 9–11. No patterns are observed for the precipitates of 4, 8, 12, and 13. The lack of patterns observed for these precipitates correlates with the increased distance and flexibility separating the Man residues in the analogs, which, in turn, prevents the formation of organized cross-linked complexes. DGL also shows a pattern of structures for its precipitates with 1–13. EM patterns for precipitates are observed with 1, 3, 5, 6, and 9–13. No patterns are observed for 2, 4, 7, and 8. With the exception of 2, the lack of patterns observed with 4, 7, and 8 correlate with the increased distance and flexibility between the Man residues in the molecules, a finding similar to that for ConA. Although the structures and binding specificities of ConA and DGL are very similar, both lectins show differences in their patterns of lattice structures with 1–13. DGL shows patterns with 12 and 13, unlike ConA, which shows no patterns with these two analogs. ConA shows a pattern for precipitates with 2, whereas DGL shows no pattern. ConA also shows a pattern for precipitates with 7, whereas DGL shows no pattern. Thus, two highly homologous lectins show differences in the observed patterns of their precipitates with 1–13. The detailed lattice structures of the cross-linked complexes of the two lectins with the analogs in Figs. 6 and 7 will await x-ray fiber diffraction and image reconstruction of the EMs (cf. Ref. 38Cheng W. Bullitt E. Bhattacharrya L. Brewer C.F. Makowski L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35016-35022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) or x-crystallographic analysis of crystals of the respective cross-linked complexes (cf.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15073-15080Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) The results demonstrated that bivalent Man analogs with flexible spacer groups exhibit higher affinities for ConA and DGL than analogs with rigid spacer groups. ConA and DGL also showed differences in their kinetics of precipitation with the bivalent analogs and differences in the EM patterns of their precipitates with 1–13. The present findings indicated that the spacing and flexibility of carbohydrate epitopes in divalent carbohydrates affects their thermodynamics of binding, kinetics of precipitation, and structures of their cross-linked complexes with different lectins. These results have important implications for the interaction of lectins with multivalent carbohydrate receptors in biological systems (39Brewer C.F. Miceli M.C. Baum L.G. Curr. Opin. Struct.

https://openalex.org/W1964378827,"The effects of inhibition or constitutive activation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) on glycogen synthase (GS) activity, abundance, and glycogen deposition in L6 rat skeletal muscle cells were investigated. GS protein expression increased ∼5-fold during differentiation of L6 cells (comparing cells at the end of day 5 with those at the beginning of day 3). However, exposure of undifferentiated myoblasts (day 3) to 50 μm SB-415286, a GSK3 inhibitor, led to a significant elevation in GS protein that was not accompanied by changes in the abundance of GLUT4, another late differentiation marker. In contrast, stable expression of a constitutively active form of GSK3β (GSK3S9A) led to a significant reduction (∼80%) in GS protein that was antagonized by SB-415286. Inhibition of GSK3 or expression of the constitutively active GSK3S9A did not result in any detectable changes in GS mRNA abundance. However, the increase in GS protein in undifferentiated myoblasts or that seen following incubation of cells expressing GSK3S9A with GSK3 inhibitors was blocked by cycloheximide suggesting that GSK3 influences GS abundance possibly via control of mRNA translation. Consistent with the reduction in GS protein, cells expressing GSK3S9A were severely glycogen depleted as judged using a specific glycogen-staining antibody. Inhibiting GSK3 in wild-type or GSK3S9A-expressing cells using SB-415286 resulted in an attendant activation of GS, but not that of glucose transport. However, GS activation alone was insufficient for stimulating glycogen deposition. Only when muscle cells were incubated simultaneously with insulin and SB-415286 or with lithium (which stimulates GS and glucose transport) was an increase in glycogen accretion observed. Our findings suggest that GSK3 activity is an important determinant of GS protein expression and that while glycogen deposition in muscle cells is inherently dependent upon the activity/expression of GS, glucose transport is a key rate-determining step in this process.

Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) 1The abbreviations used are: GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase-3; FBS, fetal bovine serum; GS, glycogen synthase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcriptase; β-Gal, β-galactosidase; PI, phosphatidylinositol; EV, empty vector.1The abbreviations used are: GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase-3; FBS, fetal bovine serum; GS, glycogen synthase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcriptase; β-Gal, β-galactosidase; PI, phosphatidylinositol; EV, empty vector. is a serine/threonine kinase that has been implicated in the control of numerous cellular responses including, for example, gene transcription, mRNA translation, intracellular signaling, and, of course, as its namesake suggests glycogen synthesis (for reviews see Refs. 1Jope R.S. Johnson G.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar and 2Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar)). The kinase is expressed in mammalian cells as two highly homologous isoforms, GSK3α and GSK3β, although a splice variant of the β-form has also recently been described (3Mukai F. Ishiguro K. Sano Y. Fujita S.C. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Although up to 40 putative substrates have been identified for GSK3, one of the best studied in vivo targets is glycogen synthase (GS) (1Jope R.S. Johnson G.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar, 2Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). GS is regulated acutely by phosphorylation of at least nine different residues, four of which (sites 3a, 3b, 3c (collectively termed site 3), and site 4) are target sites for GSK3. Phosphorylation of GS by GSK3 requires that the enzyme be phosphorylated at a site four amino acids C-terminal to site 4 by a priming kinase (4Frame S. Cohen P. Biondi R.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1321-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). The primed phosphorylated residue on GS is thought to interact with a positively charged arginine residue (Arg96) located within the catalytic domain of GSK3 that allows docking and subsequent phosphorylation of GS on sites 3 and 4 by the kinase. Since GSK3 is constitutively active in unstimulated cells, GS is maintained in a phosphorylated and inactive state. However, in response to cell stimulation with insulin, GSK3 is itself inactivated by phosphorylation of an N-terminal serine residue (Ser21 in GSK3α and Ser9 in GSK3β) by a PI 3-kinase- and protein kinase B (PKB)-dependent mechanism (5Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4324) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the phosphorylated Ser21/9 residue folds back and interacts with the positively charged Arg96 residue creating a primed pseudosubstrate that occupies the positively charged pocket preventing the interaction of GSK3 with its normal physiological substrates (4Frame S. Cohen P. Biondi R.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1321-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Under these circumstances, the inability of the kinase to engage its substrate alleviates the inhibitory input of GSK3 on GS, and the latter can then be dephosphorylated (and activated) by the glycogen-associated form of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1G).Following insulin treatment the greatest decrease in bound phosphate on GS occurs at site 3 (6Parker P.J. Caudwell F.B. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 130: 227-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) suggesting that, in addition to control by allosteric regulators, the activation status of GSK3 is likely to be a major determinant of GS activity. If this proposition is correct, impaired inactivation or an increase in GSK3 activity/expression will have a profound effect on glycogen deposition and hence post-prandial glucose disposal in tissues such as skeletal muscle. Indeed, evidence exists in the literature showing that GSK3 expression is increased in adipose tissue of insulin-resistant mice (7Eldar-Finkelman H. Schreyer S.A. Shinohara M.M. LeBoeuf R.C. Krebs E.G. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1662-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) as well as in skeletal muscle of Type II diabetics where an inverse correlation with GS activity has also been reported (8Nikoulina S.E. Ciaraldi T.P. Mudaliar S. Mohideen P. Carter L. Henry R.R. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In the present study we have attempted to further define the role of GSK3 with respect to regulation of muscle GS and glycogen deposition by assessing the effects of manipulating GSK3 activity, through use of either selective GSK3 inhibitors or expression of a constitutively active form of GSK3β in which the N-terminal Ser9 residue has been mutated to an alanine (GSK3S9A), in L6 skeletal muscle cells. The expressed GSK3S9A is resistant to inactivation by insulin, but retains sensitivity to GSK3 inhibitors that act in an ATP-competitive manner. We show here that chronic inhibition of GSK3 in L6 myoblasts, which normally express a nominal amount of GS compared with differentiated myotubes, leads to an increase in GS protein abundance. Consistent with this finding we show that muscle cells expressing the active GSK3S9A mutant exhibit a marked reduction in GS protein, GS activity, and are substantially depleted in intramyocellular glycogen content. Exposing muscle cells expressing GSK3S9A to insulin does not prevent the loss in GS expression/activity whereas these effects were antagonized if cells were incubated with SB-415286 and SB-216763, two structurally unrelated maleimides that inhibit GSK3 (9Coghlan M.P. Culbert A.A. Cross D.A.E. Holder J.C. Yates J.W. Pearce N.J. Rausch O.L. Murphy G.J. Carter P.S. Roxbee Cox L. Mills D. Brown M.J. Haigh D. Ward R.W. Smith D.G. Murray K.J. Reith A.D. Chem. Biol. 2000; 24: 1-11Google Scholar). Our studies also reveal that whereas inhibition of GSK3 using these inhibitors promotes activation of GS to a level comparable to that seen in response to insulin that, unless accompanied by an increase in glucose transport, it alone is insufficient for stimulating glycogen accretion in muscle cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—α-Minimal essential medium (α-MEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), antimycotic/antibiotic were from Invitrogen, Life Technologies. Sterile-EDTA, insulin, UDP-glucose, cycloheximide, actinomycin D, lithium, and wortmannin were from Sigma-Aldrich. All primary and secondary antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA) except antibodies against glycogen synthase (Chemicon International, Hampshire, UK), GSK3α (Division Signal Transduction Therapy, Dundee), GSK3β (Transduction Labs/BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and the α1-subunit of the Na/K-ATPase (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa). Primers were synthesized by MWG Biotech (Milton Keynes, UK) and the Oligonucleotide Synthesis Laboratory (University of Dundee, UK). SB-415286 and SB-216763 were from Tocris (Bristol, UK).Cell Culture—L6 muscle cells were cultured as described previously (10Hajduch E. Alessi D.R. Hemmings B.A. Hundal H.S. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) in α-MEM containing 2% (v/v) FBS and 1% (v/v) antimycotic/antibiotic solution (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 250 ng/ml amphotericin B) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were cultured in 10-cm dishes for lysate preparation and serum-starved for 5 h prior to addition of appropriate reagents for times and at concentrations indicated in figure legends. For cell studies involving amino acid deprivation, L6 cells were incubated in Earl's Balanced Salt Solution (EBSS; 123 mm NaCl, 26 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 5 mm glucose, pH 7.4) containing a physiological mix of amino acids for 1 h followed by an additional 4 h either in the presence of absence of amino acids (11Hyde R. Christie G.R. Litherland G.J. Hajduch E. Taylor P.M. Hundal H.S. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).L6 Lysate Preparation—L6 myoblasts were serum-starved as described above. Culture plates were washed three times with 0.9% (w/v) ice-cold saline. 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.27 m sucrose, 1mm sodium orthovanadate pH 10, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Na β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 μm microcystin-LR, and protease inhibitors) was added. Cells were scraped and homogenized by passage through a 26-gauge syringe needle prior to centrifugation (13,000 × g, 3 °C for 5 min) and storage at -20 °C.Stable Transfection of L6 Muscle Cells with Constitutively Active GSK-3β—L6 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.) with pSG5 vector, which encodes resistance to G418 sulfate (10Hajduch E. Alessi D.R. Hemmings B.A. Hundal H.S. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). cDNA encoding Myc-tagged GSK-3β in which serine 9 was mutated to an alanine was subcloned into the pSG5 vector (the construct was a gift from Michel Goedert, Cambridge, UK). Phosphorylation of serine 9 on GSK-3β is considered important for its inactivation by insulin and thus mutation of this site to an alanine (S9A) renders the kinase resistant to inactivation by insulin and constitutively active. Control cells were transfected with the expression vector lacking the GSK-3βS9A cDNA. L6 cells transfected with GSK3S9A were cultured as described earlier, but with the addition of 0.8 mg/ml of G418 sulfate to the media at all stages to select for transformed cells.Preparation of Adenoviruses and Infection of L6 Cells—An adenovirus expressing GSK3α was generated using the AdEasy System as described previously (12Lochhead P.A. Coghlan M. Rice S.Q. Sutherland C. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 937-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) using plasmids that were a kind gift from Dr. B. Vogelstein (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Baltimore, MD). The virally expressed GSK3α protein had an N-terminal deletion lacking serine 21 (rendering the expressed protein constitutively active) and the vector was bi-cistronic, also containing the gene encoding GFP. Control cells were infected with an adenovirus expressing β-galactosidase (β-Gal), which was a gift from Dr. Chris Newgard (University of Texas). The GSK3 and β-Gal adenoviruses were functionally titrated to assess the amount required for optimal infection efficiency in L6 cells (as determined by GFP imaging and X-galactosidase staining, respectively). L6 myoblasts were infected with equivalent quantities of adenovirus in serum-free medium (α-MEM) containing 5 mm d-glucose for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were maintained in α-MEM containing 2% (v/v) FBS and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C prior to being serum-deprived for 5 h in the absence or presence of GSK3 inhibitors for times and at concentrations indicated in figure legends.Glycogen Synthase Assay—Lysates from wild-type cells or those expressing GSK3S9A were prepared as described above. Glycogen synthase activity was assayed as described previously (13MacAulay K. Hajduch E. Blair A.S. Coghlan M.P. Smith S.A. Hundal H.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 3829-3838Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Assay buffer (67 mm Tris pH 7.5, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 89 mm UDP-glucose, 6.7 mm EDTA, 13 mg/ml glycogen, 1 μCi/assay uridine diphospho-d-[6-3H]glucose) was added to 45 μl of lysate in the absence or presence of 20 mm glucose-6-phosphate. After a 30 min incubation at 37 °C the reaction was stopped by spotting the reaction mix onto 31ETCHR Whatman filter paper and washed three times in 66% (v/v) ethanol for 20 min. Filters were washed in acetone and air-dried before incorporation of glucose from uridine diphospho-d-[6-3H]glucose into glycogen was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Glycogen synthase activity was expressed as a ratio of activity in the absence divided by that in the presence of its allosteric activator, glucose-6-phosphate.Immunoblotting—50 μg of cell lysate protein were subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously (10Hajduch E. Alessi D.R. Hemmings B.A. Hundal H.S. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and blocked using Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and 5% (w/v) milk. Membranes were probed with antibodies to GS (Chemicon), GLUT4 (Santa Cruz), p38 MAPK (Upstate), the α1-subunit of the Na/K-ATPase (Developmental Biology Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa), GSK-3β (Transduction Labs), c-Myc (Sigma), SNAT2 (11Hyde R. Christie G.R. Litherland G.J. Hajduch E. Taylor P.M. Hundal H.S. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and phosphorylated forms of GSK3α/β (New England Biolabs) all used at a dilution of 1:1000. Nitrocellulose membranes were washed three times in TBS/0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 for 15 min prior to incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-anti rabbit IgG (1:1000) or HRP-anti mouse IgG (1:1000) as appropriate. Protein signals were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence by exposure to Kodak autoradiographic film.Glycogen Staining and Immunofluorescence—L6 cells transfected with either empty pSG5 vector or pSG5 vector encoding constitutively active GSK3β cDNA (S9A) were grown on coverslips until confluent. Pretreated cells were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, rehydrated with 2% (v/v) fish skin gelatin, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 prior to incubation with 5% (v/v) donkey serum (Jackson Laboratories) to prevent nonspecific binding of secondary antibody and incubated overnight at 4 °C with an anti-glycogen antibody (1:50 in PBS containing 1% (v/v) donkey serum, (14Hudson E.R.

Cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 1:100 Alexa Fluor 594 conjugated donkey antimouse antibody (Molecular Probes, Netherlands) in PBS containing 1% (v/v) donkey serum prior to visualization using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope.Immunoprecipitation—100 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads were washed three times in PBS (150 mm NaCl, 2.68 mm KCl, 12 mm NaH2PO4, 1.77 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) and incubated with either c-Myc (1:1000) or GSK-3β (5 μg), for 4 h at 4 °C on an orbital platform shaker. Bead/antibody mix were washed three times in PBS and incubated with 500 μg of lysate overnight at 4 °C prior to washing, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting.GSK3 Assay—Wild-type cells or those expressing GSK3S9A were deprived of serum for4hin α-MEM and washed twice with warm HBS. Cells were subsequently incubated at 37 °C in HBS/25 mm d-glucose in the absence and presence of 100 nm wortmannin for 1 h and exposed to 100 nm insulin or vehicle for the last 15 min of this incubation prior to cell lysis. Cells were extracted from 10-cm dishes using ice-cold lysis buffer. GSK3 was immunoprecipitated from 100 μg of cell lysate using isoform-specific antibodies to GSK3α or GSK3β or an anti-Myc antibody and incubated with or without 25 milliunits/ml PP2A1 prior to assaying kinase activity using phospho-GS peptide-1 as substrate.Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR—Oligonucleotide primer pairs were synthesized (MWG Biotech AG, Ebersberg, Germany) to match bp 729–752 (GS sense, 5′-ATAGACAAAGAGGCCGGGGAGAGG-3′) and bp 1133–1156 (GS antisense, 5′-TTGGCAGGCATGATGAAAAACACT-3′) of GS sequence and bp 826–846 (β-actin sense, 5′-AGAGCCAATCCACACAGA-3′) and bp 10993–1113 (β-actin antisense, 5′-ACTATCGGCAATGAGCGGTTC-3′) of rat muscle β-actin sequence. Total RNA was isolated from L6 myoblasts and GSK3S9A cells using TRIzol® reagent as per manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, Life Technologies). RT-PCR was performed using the One-Step RT-PCR kit (Novagen, San Diego, CA). The reaction mix (1 μg of RNA, 2.5 mm dNTP, 25 mm Mn, 5× reaction buffer, 20 units of RNase inhibitor, 250 pm sense primer of GS and of β-actin, 250 pm antisense primer of GS and of β-actin to a final volume of 50 μl with RNase-free water) was subjected to a manual hot start (60 °C for 3–5 min), 5 units of rTth polymerase were added, and reverse transcription performed at 60 °C for 30 min. The following conditions were used for PCR amplification: PCR activation was initiated by 2 min at 94 °C, denaturing occurred at 94 °C for 1 min and annealing and extension at 60 °C for 90 s, denaturing and annealing/extension was repeated for 24 cycles, final extension was performed for 7 min at 60 °C. Products were resolved on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel in TBE (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm Na2EDTA) with 10 μg of ethidium bromide and visualized using a UV transilluminator.RNA Extraction and RT for Real-Time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from L6 myoblasts and GSK3S9A cells using TRIzol® reagent as per manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, Life Technologies). Samples were further purified using RNeasy Mini kits (Qiagen). RT was performed using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). The reaction mix (500 ng of RNA and 5× reaction mixture to a final volume of 20 μl with RNase/DNase free water) was subjected to the following RT conditions: 5 min at 25 °C, 30 min at 42 °C and 5 min at 85 °C.Real-Time PCR—Oligonucleotide primer pairs were designed by Beacon Designer to match bp 485–505 (GS sense, 5′-TGGTTCCTGGGTGAGTTCCTG-3′) and bp 607–627 (GS antisense, 5′-GTGGCGTGAGTGGTGAAGATG-3′) of muscle glycogen synthase (GS) sequence and bp 5584–5603 (18 S sense, 5′-GTAACCCGTTGAACCCCATT-3′) and bp 5715–5734 (18 S antisense, 5′-CCATCCAATCGGTAGTAGCG-3′) of mouse 18 S sequence and synthesized by the Oligonucleotide Synthesis Laboratory. 18 S rRNA was used as a reference for normalization as described previously (15Talbot S.G. charoenrat P. Sarkaria I.S. Ghossein R. Reddy P. Ngai I. Cordeiro C.N. Wong R.J. Kris M.G. Rusch V.W. Singh B. Ann. Surg. Oncol. 2004; 11: 530-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Real-time PCR was performed using a Bio-Rad icycler (Bio-Rad) with SYBR green fluorophore. 1 μl of previously reverse-transcribed cDNA template was mixed with 10 μl of IQSYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), 400 nm of sense primer of GS and of 18 S, 400 nm of antisense primer of GS and of 18 S, to a final volume of 20 μl with RNase/DNase-free water.Protocols for each primer set were optimized using 7 serial 10× dilutions of template cDNA. The following PCR protocol was used: 95 °C for 3 min, 95 °C for 20 s and 61 °C for 45 s repeated for 40 cycles, 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 10 s with a 0.5 °C increase in temperature each cycle for 80 cycles and 25 °C for 5.5 min. All reactions were carried out to n = 3.Statistical Analyses—For multiple comparisons statistical analysis was performed using one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a Newman Keuls post-test. Data analysis was performed using Graph-Pad Prism software and considered statistically significant at p values <0.05.RESULTSGS Expression in L6 Myoblasts and Myotubes and the Effects of GSK3 Inhibition—Preconfluent L6 myoblasts rapidly divide and align in culture and upon confluence, spontaneously fuse to form multinucleated myotubes. During this process of differentiation, muscle cells exhibit increased insulin binding (16Beguinot F. Kahn C.R. Moses A.C. Smith R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15892-15898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and GLUT4 expression (17Mitsumoto L. Burdett E. Grant A. Klip A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) indicative of a transition to an increased insulin-responsive state. To test whether GS expression also increases during myogenesis we immunoblotted lysates prepared from preconfluent (early day 3) and confluent (late day 5) L6 muscle cells with anti-GS antibodies. Fig. 1A shows that GS expression was ∼5-fold greater in lysates prepared from cells harvested at the end of day 5 compared with those lysed at the beginning of day 3 of the differentiation process. Consistent with previous observations (17Mitsumoto L. Burdett E. Grant A. Klip A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), analysis of GLUT4 abundance in the same cell lysates revealed a near 4-fold increase in GLUT4 expression in lysates from confluent (day 5) cells. The observed increase in GS and GLUT4 are likely to be a differentiation-linked phenomenon given that no parallel changes in the expression of the α1-Na/K-ATPase subunit, a component of the plasma membrane Na pump (18Hundal H.S. Marette A. Mitsumoto Y. Ramlal T. Blostein R. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5040-5043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that helps maintain the transmembrane gradients for Na and K, were observed (Fig. 1A).Unlike GS, we have shown previously that expression of GSK3α or GSK3β does not alter significantly during differentiation of L6 cells (13MacAulay K. Hajduch E. Blair A.S. Coghlan M.P. Smith S.A. Hundal H.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 3829-3838Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, on the basis that preconfluent myoblasts are less sensitive and responsive to insulin than those at a later stage of differentiation, GSK3 activity is likely to be higher during the early stages of the myogenic growth program. If this proposition is correct then it is plausible that high cellular GSK3 activity may act to suppress GS expression during early differentiation. To test this proposition we incubated preconfluent (early day 3) L6 myoblasts in the absence and presence of SB-415286 (an ATP competitive GSK3 inhibitor). Previous studies from our lab have shown that this inhibitor causes a profound inhibition of GSK3 as reflected by complete loss in GSK3-mediated phosphorylation of site 3 on GS (13MacAulay K. Hajduch E. Blair A.S. Coghlan M.P. Smith S.A. Hundal H.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 3829-3838Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows that a 24-h incubation with the inhibitor led to a significant increase in the expression of GS protein in L6 myoblasts. Under these circumstances we did not observe any increases in the abundance of GLUT4 (a late differentiation marker, Fig. 1A) or of the α1-Na/K-ATPase subunit. Inhibition of GSK3 was associated with the appearance of a GS protein that displayed a distinct shift in gel mobility to a faster migrating band, this finding is fully consistent with reduced phosphorylation of GS on sites 3 and 4 that would be expected as a result of GSK3 inhibition. Increased GS abundance was not observed when myoblasts were incubated with SB-415286 for periods less than 4 h (Fig. 1B) suggesting that GSK3 may regulate cellular GS abundance via transcriptional or translational control. Analysis of GS mRNA however, revealed no detectable increase in GS gene transcription in SB-415286 treated cells (Fig. 1C).GSK3S9A Overexpression in L6 Cells—To further help define the role of GSK3 in the regulation of GS and its contribution to glycogen deposition in L6 muscle cells we generated muscle cells stably expressing a constitutively active (S9A) GSK3β mutant harboring a C-terminal c-Myc tag. Cells expressing the empty vector (EV) were used as control. Immunoblotting of GSK3β immunoprecipitates with a c-Myc antibody confirmed the expression of the GSK3S9A (Fig. 2A), which was further verified by performing the reciprocal analysis (i.e. screening c-Myc immunoprecipitates with an anti-GSK3β antibody). The total expression levels of GSK3β in myoblasts (day 3 and day 5) were compared between cells transfected with the EV or the GSK3S9A using a GSK3β antibody. No significant differences in GSK3β abundance was observed in myoblasts transfected with the EV after 2 and 5 days of differentiation. However, myoblasts expressing the S9A construct displayed a modest, but significant overexpression of GSK3β expression at day 3, which was increased by over 2-fold by day 5 of differentiation (Fig. 2B). Over this period, stable transfection of GSK3S9A had no impact on the cellular expression of GSK3α in L6 cells.Fig. 2GSK-3α/β expression in L6 cells expressing constitutively active GSK3S9A.A, L6 cells were stably transfected with Myc-tagged GSK3S9A (S9A), which was immunoprecipitated using antibodies to either c-Myc or GSK3β, the immunoprecipitate was subsequently immunoblotted with the reciprocal antibody. L6 cells transfected with the empty pSG5 expression vector (EV) were used as a control. B, cells expressing EV or S9A were lysed on day 3 or day 5 of differentiation and lysates immunoblotted with isoform-specific antibodies to GSK3α or GSK3β or p38 MAPK (used as a gel loading control). Immunoblots are representative of three experiments. Immunoreactive signals were quantified using an imaging densitometer and data presented as a bar graph. Values are the mean + S.E. for three experiments. Asterisks indicate a significant change from the corresponding value obtained using cells transfected with EV (p < 0.01).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)GSK3 Activity in Muscle Cells Overexpressing GSK3S9A— Having established that GSK3S9A was significantly overexpressed in day 5 L6-myoblasts we"

We showed previously that cobinamide, a cobalamin (vitamin B12) precursor, binds NO with high affinity, and we now evaluated the potential of cobinamide as a NO scavenger in biologic systems. We found that cobinamide reversed NO-stimulated fluid secretion in Drosophila Malpighian tubules, both when applied in the form of a NO donor and when produced intracellularly by nitricoxide synthase. Moreover, feeding flies cobinamide markedly attenuated subsequent NO-induced increases in tubular fluid secretion. Cobinamide was taken up efficiently by cultured rodent cells and prevented NO-induced phosphorylation of the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein VASP both when NO was provided to the cells and when NO was generated intracellularly. Cobinamide appeared to act via scavenging NO because it reduced nitrite and nitrate concentrations in both the fly and mammalian cell systems, and it did not interfere with cGMP-induced phosphorylation of VASP. In rodent and human cells, cobinamide exhibited toxicity at concentrations ≥50 μm with toxicity completely prevented by providing equimolar amounts of cobalamin. Combining cobalamin with cobinamide had no effect on the ability of cobinamide to scavenge NO. Cobinamide did not inhibit the in vitro activity of either of the two mammalian cobalamin-dependent enzymes, methionine synthase or methylmalonyl-coenzyme A mutase; however, it did inhibit the in vivo activities of the enzymes in the absence, but not presence, of cobalamin, suggesting that cobinamide toxicity was secondary to interference with cobalamin metabolism. As part of these studies, we developed a facile method for producing and purifying cobinamide. We conclude that cobinamide is an effective intra- and extracellular NO scavenger whose modest toxicity can be eliminated by cobalamin.

Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 298-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Studies of NO functions have been aided by pharmacologic agents that raise or lower NO levels (4Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar). A number of disease states including sepsis and hepatic failure are characterized by abnormally high NO production, and removing the excess NO could have salutary effects (5Shah V. Lyford G. Gores G. Farrugia G. Gastroenterology. 2004; 126: 903-913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 6Komeno M. Akimoto A. Fujita T. Aramaki T. Aoki M. Shimada T. Ohashi F. J. Vet.

One approach to lower NO concentrations is to reduce NO synthesis. Four nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms are present in mammals: neuronal NOS (nNOS or NOS I), inducible NOS (iNOS or NOS II), endothelial NOS (eNOS or NOS III), and a recently described mitochondrial NOS (mtNOS) (8Nedvetsky P.I.

Chem. 2002; 277: 38079-38086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). nNOS and eNOS are constitutively expressed in many tissues and produce pico to nanomolar concentrations of NO in response to increased intracellular calcium (10Clancy R.M. Abramson S.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1995; 210: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). iNOS is expressed in a variety of cell types, and its level can be induced many-fold by endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) and tumor necrosis factor-α, with iNOS producing almost 1,000 times higher NO, i.e. nano to micromolar, concentrations than nNOS and eNOS (7Pfeilschifter J.

Less is known about mtNOS, but it accounts for 50% of cellular NO production in rat liver, and low micromolar NO concentrations have been found in rat heart mitochondria (9Elfering S.L. Sarkela T.M. Giulivi C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38079-38086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 14Saavedra-Molina A. Ramirez-Emiliano J. Clemente-Guerrero M. Perez-Vazquez V. Aguilera-Aguirre L. Gonzalez-Hernandez J.C. Amino Acids. 2003; 24: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A large number of NOS inhibitors have been generated, most of which are arginine analogs including isothiourea derivatives, and because of the multiple biochemical roles of arginine, these agents can have affects other than NOS inhibition (15Garvey E.P. Oplinger J.A. Tanoury G.J. Sherman P.A. Fowler M. Marshall S. Harmon M.F. Paith J.E. Furfine E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26669-26676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16El Mabrouk M.

Nutr. 2002; 21: 111-117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Another approach to reduce NO levels is to use a NO scavenger. For example, the heme moiety of hemoglobin binds NO with great avidity, but heme and free extracellular hemoglobin can be highly toxic, particularly in whole animals (18Kim H.W. Greenburg A.G. Shock. 2002; 17: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, other NO scavengers have been considered including dithiocarbamate derivatives that chelate iron and thus bind NO, but these too can have adverse effects (19Menezes J. Hierholzer C. Watkins S.C. Lyons V. Peitzman A.B. Billiar T.R. Tweardy D.J. Harbrecht B.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G144-G151PubMed Google Scholar, 20Nadler E.P. Dickinson E.C. Beer-Stolz D. Alber S.M. Watkins S.C. Pratt D.W. Ford H.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G173-G181PubMed Google Scholar). Cobalamin (vitamin B12) is structurally similar to heme and also binds NO, but with considerably less efficiency than heme (21Greenberg S.S. Xie J. Zatarain J.M. Kapusta D.R. Miller M.J.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 273: 257-265PubMed Google Scholar). We found recently that the cobalamin precursor cobinamide, which lacks the dimethylbenzimidazole ribonucleotide tail of cobalamin (Fig. 1), has a more than 100 times greater affinity for NO than cobalamin; moreover, each cobinamide molecule can potentially neutralize two NO molecules compared with only one NO molecule for cobalamin (22Sharma V.S. Pilz R.B. Boss G.B. Magde D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8900-8908Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We now present studies demonstrating the use of cobinamide as a NO scavenger, both in a Drosophila model and in cultured mammalian cells. Cobinamide became toxic to cells at concentrations considerably higher than would be needed to neutralize NO produced in vivo, and the toxicity was reversed fully by cobalamin; cobalamin did not affect NO scavenging by cobinamide, and thus the combination of these two corrinoids could be a very effective method to scavenge NO. Production and Analysis of Cobinamide—Approximately 200 mg of hydroxocobalamin (OH-Cbl, Sigma) was dissolved in 1 ml of concentrated HCl and heated at 65 °C for 8 min to hydrolyze the phosphoester bond linking the dimethylbenzimidazole ribonucleotide moiety to the corrin ring (Fig. 1 and Ref. 23Hayward G.C. Hill H.A.O. Pratt J.M. Vanston N.J. Williams A.R.W. J. Chem. Soc. 1965; : 6485-6493Crossref Google Scholar). The solution was cooled on ice and applied to a l-ml C18 solid phase extraction column (Fisher Scientific). The HCl and unreacted OH-Cbl were removed by batch elution in water and 10% acetone, respectively, and the diaquocobinamide (cobinamide) product was eluted in 20% acetone and concentrated under reduced pressure in a SpeedVac (Savant Industries). Purity of the cobinamide was confirmed both spectrophotometrically by comparison with published spectra (22Sharma V.S. Pilz R.B. Boss G.B. Magde D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8900-8908Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 24Baldwin D.A. Betterton E.A. Pratt J.M. J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 1983; : 217-223Crossref Google Scholar, 25Ford S.H. Nichols A. Shambee M. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1991; 41: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a C18 reversed phase column eluted isocratically in 100 mm NaH2PO4, pH 4.0, and 15% methanol (v/v) (25Ford S.H. Nichols A. Shambee M. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1991; 41: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 26Boss G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2936-2941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the column effluent was monitored at multiple wavelengths by a diode array detector. The yield was generally >80%, or ∼160 mg of cobinamide was produced per batch. When stored at –20 °C, the cobinamide was spectroscopically and biologically stable for at least 1 month. Assessment of Malpighian Tubule Secretion in Drosophila melanogaster—An elegant in vitro method has been devised to measure fluid transport by the Malpighian tubules of D. melanogaster; tubular secretion is stimulated markedly by NO donors and LPS, the latter via induction of the Drosophila NOS gene (27Broderick K.E. MacPherson M.R. Regulski M. Tully T. Dow J.A. Davies S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C1207-C1218Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 28Dow J.T. Davies S.A. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 687-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Briefly, two pairs of Malpighian tubules, each with a ureter, were dissected from 10 wild type Oregon R adult flies anesthetized on ice. The tubules were mounted in liquid paraffin with the distal end of one tubule bathed in a 10-μl droplet of Schneider's Insect medium. Fluid secretion rates were determined at room temperature by measuring the size of drops formed at the end of the ureter every 10 min. Basal fluid secretion rates were measured for three 10-min intervals prior to adding 10 μm Deta-NONOate (Cayman Chemical Co.) or 1 μm LPS (Sigma) to the droplet of Schneider's medium; after three more 10-min intervals, 10 μm cobinamide, with or without 10 μm OH-Cbl, was added to some of the tubules for a further 30 min. Each data point represents the mean from at least 20 pairs of tubules analyzed on three separate occasions. In some experiments, flies were grown for 48 h on food supplemented with 250 μm cobinamide prior to measuring the rates of tubular secretion. The supplemented food was generated by liquifying standard fly food paste by heating to ∼40 °C and after adding cobinamide, allowing the food to cool to room temperature. Malpighian tubules were dissected from the flies, and rates of tubular secretion were measured in the absence and presence of 1 μm LPS as described above. Measurement of Cobinamide Uptake into Mammalian Cells—To study cobinamide uptake into mammalian cells, we radioactively labeled cobinamide with 14C by adding 2 molar equivalents of [14C]KCN (54 mCi/mmol, Moravek Biochemicals) to form [14C]dicyanocobinamide ([57Co]cobalamin is no longer commercially available). The binding affinity of cyanide for cobinamide is extremely high (Koverall –1022m–1) (29Pratt J.M. Inorganic Chemistry of Vitamin B12. Academic Press, London1972: 144Google Scholar), but to be sure no [14C]KCN remained, we lowered the pH to 6 to form HCN (pKa of KCN is 9.2) and then bubbled argon through the solution to remove any [14C]HCN. The specific activity of the [14C]dicyanocobinamide product was 104 mCi/mmol (using a molar extinction coefficient of 2.8 × 104 at 348 nm) (25Ford S.H. Nichols A. Shambee M. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1991; 41: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In the uptake studies, ∼1 × 106 baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagles' medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) were grown to subconfluence in 6-well cluster dishes. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min with [14C]dicyanocobinamide at concentrations ranging from 100 nm to 100 μm. At the end of the incubation, the cells were washed rapidly four times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested with a rubber policeman, and collected by centrifugation for 15 s at 10,000 × g. The cell pellet was dissolved in 500 μl of 0.1 n NaOH, and radioactivity in sample aliquots was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Cobinamide uptake was linear between 2 and 15 min of incubation and from 0.5 to 2 × 106 cells; counts obtained in 0-time samples were <10% of those obtained in the 2-min samples. Assessment of VASP Phosphorylation—Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) is expressed in a wide variety of cells (30Reinhard M. Jarchau T. Walter U. Trends Biochem.

Approximately 1 × 106 rat C6 glioma or CS-54 vascular smooth muscle cells in 12-well cluster dishes were transfected with 50 ng of an expression vector for VSV epitope-tagged VASP as described previously; C6 cells additionally received 25 ng of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (G-kinase) Iα expression vector (31Zhuang S.

Measurement of Nitrite and Nitrate—NO has a very short half-life and is oxidized rapidly to nitrite and nitrate under physiological conditions. Hence, one of the most common methods for assessing NO production is to measure nitrite and nitrate concentrations, which is generally done using the Griess reagent (33Danishpajooh I.O. Gudi T.

We measured nitrite and nitrate concentrations in both the Drosophila Malpighian tubule secretion system and in the C6 and CS-54 cells. In the Drosophila system, 20 tubules were incubated in 100 μl of Schneider's medium, and the tubules were stimulated for 60 min with either 10 μm Deta-NONOate or 10 μm LPS, in the absence or presence of 10 μm cobinamide. The C6 and CS-54 cells were incubated for 30 min with 15 μm PAPA-NONOate and 300 nm A23187, respectively, in the absence or presence of 15 μm cobinamide. In all cases, the medium was collected at the end of the incubation period, and nitrite and nitrate in the medium were measured using a nitric oxide quantitation kit from Active Motif, which is an enhanced Griess reagent-based method. Because Deta-NONOate and PAPA-NONOate will continue to release NO even after the end of the incubation with the tubules and cells, all subsequent steps were performed at room temperature immediately after harvesting the medium. Assessment of Cobinamide Cytotoxicity—The effect of varying concentrations of cobinamide on the growth of BHK, CS-54, and C6 cells, and human foreskin fibroblasts and human umbilical venous endothelial cells was assessed by counting the number of cells daily for 3 days using a model ZM Coulter Counter (Coulter Electronics). All of the cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS, except the umbilical endothelial cells, which were grown in M199 medium containing endothelial cell growth supplement and 20% FBS (35Kim S.

Cells were plated in 6-well culture dishes at initial densities of 1.5–3 × 105 cells/well. Measurement of the Activity of Methionine Synthase and Methylmalonyl-CoA Mutase in Vitro—BHK cells were extracted as described previously at a density of ∼50 × 106/ml in a buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and a protease inhibitor mixture (34Idriss S.D.

Methionine synthase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activities were measured in the extracts in the absence and presence of 1–200 μm cobinamide. Methionine synthase activity was measured at 37 °C according to the method of Weissbach et al. (36Weissbach H. Peterkofsky A. Redfield B.G. Dickerman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3318-3324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except the [14C]methyltetrahydrofolate substrate was separated from the [14C]methionine product by thin layer chromatography on cellulose acetate plates developed in butanol:acetic acid:water (4:1:5); the RF values for substrate and product were 0.26 and 0.44, respectively. For methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, the extracts were preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C with 5 μm deoxyadenosylcobalamin to convert apoenzyme to holoenzyme, followed by a 10-fold dilution in extract buffer. Enzyme activity was measured at 30 °C according to the method of Kikuchi et al. (37Kikuchi M. Hanamizu H. Narisawa K. Tada K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1989; 184: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), with the methylmalonyl-CoA substrate separated from the succinyl-CoA product by HPLC on a C18 reverse phase column eluted in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 4.0, containing 15% methanol; amounts of substrate and product were determined by comparison with known standards. Both assays were linear with time from 5 to 15 min and with a protein concentration from 0.1 to 0.5 mg/ml. Assessment of the Activity of Methionine Synthase and Methylmalonyl-CoA Mutase in Vivo—The activities of methionine synthase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase were assessed in intact BHK cells by following incorporation of [14C]formate into purine nucleotides and [14C]propionic acid into protein, respectively; both of these assays have been used previously as surrogate measurements of the in vivo activities of the enzymes (33Danishpajooh I.O.

Briefly, about 1 × 106 BHK cells were incubated in 6-well cluster dishes with 10 μCi of [14C]formate for 90 min or 20 μCi of [14C]propionic acid for 16 h; cobinamide, at concentrations of 1–200 μm, was added 6.5 h before the formate label (for a total incubation time of 8 h) and simultaneously with the propionate label. At the end of the incubation, the cells incubated with [14C]formate were extracted in 0.4 n perchloric acid, heated to 100 °C for 70 min to convert purine nucleotides to bases, and applied to Dowex 50 cation exchange columns to separate the purine bases from unincorporated [14C]formate (39Boss G.R. Erbe R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4242-4247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells incubated with [14C]propionic acid were extracted in ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, heated to 80 °C for 30 min to solubilize precipitated nucleic acids, and after recooling to 4 °C, precipitated protein was collected on glass microfiber filters (39Boss G.R. Erbe R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4242-4247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both assays were linear with time and cell number from 0.5 to 2 × 106 cells/ml. Production and Analysis of Cobinamide—The standard method for producing diaquocobinamide starts with dicyanocobinamide, removing the cyanide by acid treatment, and exposure to strong light (23Hayward G.C. Hill H.A.O. Pratt J.M. Vanston N.J. Williams A.R.W. J. Chem. Soc. 1965; : 6485-6493Crossref Google Scholar). As mentioned earlier, cobinamide has a very high binding affinity for cyanide, and hence it is difficult to remove cyanide completely from the cobinamide preparations. Moreover, exposure to light over a prolonged period can potentially alter the corrin ring. Because we were interested in producing cyanide-free cobinamide for use in biological systems, we started with OH-Cbl as the initial substrate. The dimethylbenzimidazole ribonucleotide tail was removed by brief acid treatment, and the diaquocobinamide was purified by batch elution over a small sample preparation column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Beginning with about 200 mg of OH-Cbl, we obtained ∼150–170 mg of high purity cobinamide. Fig. 2 shows the absorbance spectrum of a typical cobinamide preparation at pH 3 having a major peak of 348 nm and smaller relatively equal peaks at 494 and 520 nm (23Hayward G.C. Hill H.A.O. Pratt J.M. Vanston N.J. Williams A.R.W. J. Chem. Soc. 1965; : 6485-6493Crossref Google Scholar, 24Baldwin D.A. Betterton E.A. Pratt J.M. J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 1983; : 217-223Crossref Google Scholar); in preparations containing contaminants, the 494 and 520 nm peaks tend to either merge together into one broad peak, or the 520 peak became predominant, and a broad band at 455 nm became evident (25Ford S.H. Nichols A. Shambee M. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1991; 41: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Further evidence for high purity of the preparations was that at pH 12 the A344/A356 ratio was 1.06, well within the range of 1.05–1.11 reported previously for pure dihydroxocobinamide (25Ford S.H. Nichols A. Shambee M. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1991; 41: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and HPLC analyses of the cobinamide product yielded a single peak when monitored at multiple wavelengths between 300 and 600 nm (40Ford S.H. Nichols A. Gallery J.M. J. Chromatogr. 1991; 536: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Efficacy of Cobinamide as a NO Scavenger in a Drosophila Fluid Secretion Model—It has become clear that Drosophila is an excellent model for human disease and drug discovery (41Tickoo S. Russell S. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2002; 2: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 42O'Kane C.J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 14: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The Malpighian tubules of D. melanogaster are the organs for fluid transport and osmoregulation in the insect, corresponding to vertebrate kidneys. Rates of tubular secretion can be measured in vitro after extracting tubules from flies; NO stimulates secretion via activation of soluble guanylate cyclase, thereby increasing the intracellular cGMP concentration and activating the cGMP/G-kinase transduction pathway (27Broderick K.E. MacPherson M.R. Regulski M. Tully T. Dow J.A. Davies S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C1207-C1218Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 28Dow J.T. Davies S.A. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 687-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We studied the effect of cobinamide on tubular fluid secretion stimulated both by a NO donor and by LPS, an inducer of the Drosophila NOS gene. In addition, to simulate conditions in a whole animal, we administered cobinamide to the flies via their food and then measured the effect of LPS on rates of tubular fluid secretion. In the experiments with a NO donor, we treated tubules with 10 μm Deta-NONOate, which caused a rapid and sustained increase in the rate of fluid secretion (Fig. 3A; Deta-NONOate was added to all tubules after a 30-min basal period, as indicated by the arrowhead). Adding 10 μm cobinamide to Deta-NONOate-treated tubules reduced the rate of fluid secretion significantly, almost returning to the basal unstimulated level (Fig. 3A; cobinamide was added at 60 min to some of the tubules as indicated by the arrow and the filled circles). Adding cobinamide alone to the tubules was without effect (data not shown). To increase endogenous NO production by the tubules, we used LPS and observed a marked stimulation of tubular secretion (Fig. 3B; LPS was added at 30 min as indicated by the arrowhead). As in the experiments with Deta-NONOate, cobinamide rapidly reduced tubular secretion, returning rates near to the basal state (Fig. 3B; cobinamide was added at 60 min to some of the tubules as indicated by the arrow and the filled circles). Thus, cobinamide scavenges both extracellularly administered and intracellularly produced NO in a Drosophila whole organ system. As part of these studies, we measured the amount of NO released by Deta-NONOate or produced by LPS-treated tubules by incubating tubules for 60 min in Schneider's medium and measuring the sum of nitrite and nitrate in the medium. In the absence of the two drugs, no nitrite or nitrate could be detected in the medium, implying that the basa"

To define the GAG motifs that interact with proteins, we assessed the ability of 15 totally synthetic HS mimetics to interact with 10 functionally diverse proteins that bind heparin/HS. The HS mimetics consisted of cyclitol-based pseudo-sugars coupled by linkers of variable chain length, flexibility, orientation, and hydrophobicity, with variations in sulfation also being introduced into some molecules. Three of the proteins tested, namely hepatocyte growth factor, eotaxin, and elastase, failed to interact with any of the sulfated linked cyclitols. In contrast, each of the remaining seven proteins tested exhibited a unique reactivity pattern with the panel of HS mimetics, with tetrameric cyclitols linked by different length alkyl chains being particularly informative. Thus, compounds with short alkyl spacers (2–3 carbon atoms) effectively blocked the interaction of fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1) and lipoprotein lipase with heparin/HS, whereas longer chain spacers (7–10 carbon atoms) were required for optimal inhibition of FGF-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor binding. This effect was most pronounced with the chemokine, interleukin-8, where alkyl-linked tetrameric cyclitols were essentially inactive unless a spacer of >7 carbon atoms was used. The heparin-inhibitable enzymes heparanase and cathepsin G also displayed characteristic inhibition patterns, cathepsin G interacting promiscuously with most of the sulfated cyclitols but heparanase activity being inhibited most effectively by HS mimetics that structurally resemble a sulfated pentasaccharide. These data indicate that a simple panel of HS mimetics can be used to probe the HS binding specificity of proteins, with the position of anionic groups in the HS mimetics being critical.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). The polysaccharide is composed of alternating glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine units, which, during biosynthesis, are subjected to a range of modifications such as O-sulfation at various positions, N-deacetylation, and N-sulfation of N-acetylglucosamine residues as well as C-5 epimerization of glucuronic acid to iduronic acid. Theoretically up to 48 different disaccharides could occur in HS due to these modifications, although so far only 23 have been identified (2Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, as a result of the presence of these different disaccharides, HS chains exhibit remarkable structural heterogeneity. Such diversity is further enhanced by the considerable variation in chain length of the glycosaminoglycan. Heparin, a glycosaminoglycan with a much more restricted cellular distribution than HS, is structurally closely related to HS but has ∼80% of its disaccharide units epimerized or sulfated compared with only ∼10% of disaccharides being modified in HS (6Capila I. Linhardt R.J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2002; 41: 391-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar). The modified disaccharides in HS, however, are concentrated in “hot spots” along the molecular backbone and separated by flexible spacers of low sulfation, rather than being evenly distributed throughout the polysaccharide chain (2Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar, 3Gallagher J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar).Both heparin and HS are known to interact with a wide range of functionally diverse proteins, such as growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, proteases, lipases, and cell adhesion molecules (2Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar, 3Gallagher J.T. J. Clin.

Furthermore, there is increasing evidence to suggest that these proteins bind to unique structural motifs on the HS chains, with different tissues and cell types controlling their ability to interact with various HS-binding proteins by varying their repertoire of sugar sequences. In fact, genetic studies in Drosophila and mice (3Gallagher J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 9Forsberg E. Kjellen L. J. Clin.

Acta. 2002; 1573: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 11Nakato H. Kimata K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) have demonstrated unequivocally that a lack of specific HS modifications can impair development, whereas mice deficient in HS die at the gastrula stage (12Lin X. Wei G. Shi Z. Dryer L. Esko J.D. Wells D.E. Matzuk M.M. Dev. Biol. 2000; 224: 299-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). At the physiological level, it appears that HS can regulate the function of HS-binding proteins in a number of ways, with some well characterized examples being listed below. First, depots of growth factors and cytokines can exist in the ECM bound to HS (13Taipale J. Keski-Oja J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 14Schonherr E. Hausser H.J. Dev. Immunol. 2000; 7: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). These can be liberated by ECM-degrading enzymes, such as heparanase, and be made available for important physiological processes such as wound healing and angiogenesis (15Parish C.R. Freeman C. Hulett M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1471: M99-108PubMed Google Scholar, 16Vlodavsky I. Friedmann Y. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Second, cell surface HS can interact with both HS-binding growth factors and growth factor receptors and, thereby, greatly facilitate signal transduction via such receptors (3Gallagher J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 11Nakato H. Kimata K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 17Rapraeger A.C.

Biol. 1999; 9: 1343-1346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Third, chemokines and cytokines can form stable gradients within tissues by associating with HS chains in the ECM, an interaction that aids leukocyte entry into inflammatory sites (19Gotte M. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 575-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Finally, the activity of a range of enzymes can be modulated by heparin and HS, with the classic example being the ability of heparin to potentiate antithrombin III-mediated inhibition of thrombin (2Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar, 6Capila I. Linhardt R.J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2002; 41: 391-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar). Similarly, heparin, and to a lesser extent HS, can both directly and indirectly inhibit the proteolytic activity of neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G (20Baici A. Diczhazi C. Neszmelyi A. Moczar E. Hornebeck W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 1545-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 21Ermolieff J. Boudier C. Laine A. Meyer B. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29502-29508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ying Q.L. Kemme M. Saunders D. Simon S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L533-L541PubMed Google Scholar).Because data are emerging that suggest different HS-binding proteins tend to interact with unique structural motifs within HS, the possibility now exists for the design and synthesis of HS mimetics, which selectively block undesirable protein-HS interactions (23Shriver Z. Liu D. Sasisekharan R. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In fact, we have recently developed an HS-mimetic, called PI-88, that exhibits anti-angiogenic, anti-metastatic, and anti-restenotic activities and that is currently undergoing Phase II clinical trials in cancer patients. This drug, which is composed primarily of sulfated phosphomannopentaose and phosphomannotetraose oligosaccharide units, is believed to exert its biological effects by blocking the enzymatic activity of the ECM-degrading enzyme, heparanase, and by interfering with the action of HS-binding growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1), FGF-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (24Parish C.R. Freeman C. Brown K.J. Francis D.J. Cowden W.B. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3433-3441PubMed Google Scholar, 25Francis D.J. Parish C.R. McGarry M. Santiago F.S. Lowe H.C. Brown K.J. Bingley J.A. Hayward I.P.

Rev. 2004; 22: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). PI-88, however, interferes with a relatively broad range of protein-HS interactions, because it represents a modified natural product containing a mixture of differentially sulfated oligosaccharides. To obtain homogeneous and structurally well defined HS mimetics, a family of totally synthetic molecules, namely sulfated linked cyclitols, was prepared. This study compares the ability of 15 different sulfated linked cyclitols to interact with 10 functionally diverse proteins. It was found that each protein examined exhibited a unique reactivity pattern with the panel of sulfated cyclitols, confirming the view that many HS-binding proteins preferentially bind to unique structural motifs in HS. This study also highlights the selective therapeutic potential of HS mimetics and demonstrates that a relatively simple panel of mimetics can provide considerable information regarding the HS binding specificity of proteins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—PI-88, provided by Progen Industries Ltd. (Brisbane, Australia), was prepared as described previously (24Parish C.R. Freeman C. Brown K.J. Francis D.J. Cowden W.B. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3433-3441PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ferro V. Fewings K.

It consists predominantly of sulfated phosphomannopentaose and phosphomannotetraose with its components having molecular masses in the range ∼1400 to ∼3100 Da. Bovine lung heparin (mean molecular mass ∼12.5 kDa) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Porcine mucosal HS (ORG 553) was a generous gift from Organon Int. Bv (Oss, The Netherlands). FGF-1, FGF-2, VEGF165, interleukin-8 (IL-8), and eotaxin were supplied by R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MA. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was a generous gift of Dr. Oyvind Hjertner, Institute of Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Medisinsk Teknisk Senter, Trondheim, Norway. Human platelet heparanase was purified according to the method of Freeman and Parish (28Freeman C. Parish C.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1341-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Bovine lipoprotein lipase (LpL), human leukocyte elastase, and human leukocyte cathepsin G were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.Surface Plasmon Resonance—Binding studies were performed, as previously reported (25Francis D.J. Parish C.R. McGarry M. Santiago F.S. Lowe H.C. Brown K.J. Bingley J.A. Hayward I.P. Cowden W.B. Campbell J.H. Campbell G.R. Chesterman C.N. Khachigian L.M. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: e70-e77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), on a BIAcore 2000 surface plasmon resonancebased biosensor (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden) using either biotinylated bovine lung heparin or biotinylated porcine mucosal HS immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip (BIAcore). Briefly, the carboxymethylated surface of the sensor chip was first activated with a mixture of N-hydroxysuccinimide and N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, NeutrAvidin was then covalently attached to the chip surface, and any residual activated ester groups were blocked by ethanolamine hydrochloride. Biotinylated heparin or biotinylated HS was then bound to the immobilized NeutrAvidin, with the flow cells finally being washed with 4 m NaCl. The different heparin/HS-binding proteins (25–68 nm) were injected into the flow cells of the biosensor, with binding and dissociation each being monitored for 3–10 min. Data points were collected continuously during the binding and dissociation phases, and analysis was based on the response once saturation binding had been reached. Between each cycle, the sensor surface was regenerated with 4 m NaCl. Simultaneous measurements were obtained from the four flow cells with flow cells 1 and 3 containing NeutrAvidin alone (to establish background binding), flow cell 2 containing immobilized biotinylated heparin, and flow cell 4 containing immobilized biotinylated HS. Flow cells 1 and 3 were used as blank reference cells, with the background binding to NeutrAvidin in flow cell 1 and 3 being subtracted from the responses in flow cells 2 and 4. The sensorgrams were analyzed with the aid of the BIAevaluation software version 3.0.2 (BIAcore). Baselines were adjusted to zero for all curves and background sensorgrams subtracted from experimental sensorgrams to produce curves of specific binding.Enzyme Assays—Heparanase activity was assayed as described previously (29Freeman C. Parish C.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Cathepsin G activity was determined in 96-well U-bottomed plastic microplates by incubating human leukocyte cathepsin G (40 μl/well, 100 ng/well of enzyme), in the presence or absence of inhibitors, with the fluorogenic substrate N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-amidomethylcoumarin (Sigma-Aldrich) in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.6, containing 50 mm NaCl and 0.1% (v:v) Brij 35. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 40 μl/well of 250 mm acetic acid, and fluorescence was determined using a Cytofluor II fluorescence plate reader (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) employing an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. Because plastic microplates inhibited elastase enzymic activity, elastase assays were performed in 0.5-ml polycarbonate tubes with reaction mixtures, upon reaction completion, being transferred to 96-well plastic microplates for reading by the fluorescence plate reader. Human leukocyte elastase (40 μl/tube, 20 ng/tube of enzyme) was incubated, in the presence or absence of inhibitors, with the fluorogenic substrate MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-amidomethylcoumarin (ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl and 0.1% (v:v) Brij 35. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, the reaction was then stopped by the addition of 40 μl/well of 250 mm acetic acid, and the mixture was transferred to a 96-well microplate, with fluorescence being determined as for cathepsin G.RESULTSSynthesis and Structural Properties of HS Mimetics—A series of HS mimetics was synthesized, these being composed of cyclitol subunits, which represent pseudo-sugars in which the pyranosyl-ring oxygen has been replaced by a methylene unit. Such compounds are highly stable and “immune” from glycosidic cleavage. The synthesis and physicochemical properties of these compounds will be described in detail elsewhere. 2M. G. Banwell, A. J. Edwards, V. Ferro, C. Freeman, L. Liu, and C. R. Parish, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, the synthesis involved the biotransformation of iodobenzene using the genetically engineered microorganism Escherichia coli JM109 (pDTG601), which overexpresses toluene dioxygenase, to yield the corresponding iodinated cis-1,2-dihydrocatechol as starting material (30Banwell M.G. Edwards A.J. Harfoot G.J. Jolliffe K.A. McLeod M.D. McRae K.J. Stewart S.G. Vogtle M. Pure Appl. Chem. 2003; 75: 223-229Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 31Johnson R.A. Org. React. 2004; 63: 117-264Google Scholar). A suitably protected epoxy derivative of this starting material was then reacted with the relevant 1,ω-diaminoalkane or -arene to give, after appropriate deprotection and de-iodination, the polyhydroxylated precursor to compounds of the general type 1 (Fig. 1). cis-Dihydroxylation of the double bond within the tetrameric cyclitols formed as just described gave, after deprotection, the precursors to compounds of the form 1a (Fig. 1). Exhaustive sulfation of each member of these two series of polyhydroxylated tetramers with pyridine-SO3 followed by work up with sodium bicarbonate then afforded the target compounds 1 or 1a, which represent two families of related compounds (Fig. 1). In one family, each pseudo-sugar unit contains three sulfation sites (1, Fig. 1), whereas with the other family five sulfation sites were incorporated within each unit (1a, Fig. 1). A less sulfated pentameric cyclitol was also generated by employing a triamino-linker (14, Fig. 1). In the case of the sulfated tetrameric cyclitols a range of linkers was used, namely alkyl chain linkers varying in length from 2 to 10 carbon atoms (2–10, 6a, and 10a, Fig. 1), p-xylyl and m-xylyl linkers (11 and 12, Fig. 1), and a sulfated propylene linker (13, Fig. 1). Compounds 6a and 10a represent more highly sulfated tetrameric cyclitols (1a) linked by 6-carbon and 10-carbon alkyl chains, respectively. Thus, a total of 15 cyclitol-based HS mimetics were employed in this study, the key structural features of these compounds being the presence of highly sulfated regions separated by spacers of variable length, flexibility, orientation, and hydrophobicity.Ability of Heparin and PI-88 to Interact with Several Heparin/HS Binding Proteins—The binding properties of 10 heparin/HS-interacting proteins were investigated in this study (Table I). The proteins examined consisted of four heparin/HS binding growth factors (FGF-1, FGF-2, VEGF165, and HGF), two chemokines (IL-8 and eotaxin), one HS-binding enzyme (LpL), and three heparin-inhibitable enzymes (heparanase, cathepsin G, and elastase). The ability of the different HS mimetics to inhibit the binding of the growth factors, chemokines, and LpL to heparin/HS was quantified using an optical biosensor with the biosensor chips carrying immobilized heparin or HS. In each case concentrations of the binding proteins were used, which exhibited ∼60–90% maximal binding as detected by the biosensor. In the case of the heparin-inhibitable enzymes standard enzyme assays were established for each enzyme, and the ability of the different compounds to inhibit enzymatic activity was quantified.Table IGeneral properties of heparin/HS-interacting proteins used in this studyProtein classProteinIC50aConcentration of heparin or PI-88 required to inhibit protein binding or enzymic activity by 50%.

Enzyme assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”b Bovine lung heparin (12.5 kDa).c Phosphomannopentaose sulfate. Open table in a new tab In initial studies bovine lung heparin and the sulfated oligosaccharide, PI-88, were assessed for their inhibitory activity with IC50 values being presented in Table I. The biosensor data presented in Table I are those obtained using immobilized heparin, but comparable results were observed when immobilized HS was used, although due to there usually being fewer protein binding sites on HS (relative to heparin) the sensorgram response was considerably lower with immobilized HS. The one exception to this rule was eotaxin, which interacted strongly with immobilized heparin but failed to bind to immobilized HS. PI-88 exhibited substantial inhibitory activity against seven of the heparin/HS-interacting proteins tested, namely FGF-1, FGF-2, VEGF165, HGF, LpL, heparanase, and cathepsin G. On the other hand, PI-88 was essentially inactive against the two chemokines (IL-8 and eotaxin) and elastase.Of the seven heparin/HS-binding proteins whose activity was blocked by PI-88, heparin was usually a more effective inhibitor than PI-88. Thus, in terms of IC50, PI-88 was ∼2 (FGF-1)-, 7 (FGF-2)-, 6 (HGF)-, 15 (LpL)-, 8 (heparanase)-, and 6 (cathepsin G)-fold less active than heparin (Table I). The one exception was VEGF165 where PI-88 and heparin were equally effective. These differences are probably due to heparin being a polydisperse linear polysaccharide with a mean molecular mass of ∼12.5 kDa and, therefore, potentially having multiple protein binding sites, whereas the much smaller PI-88 (∼1.4–3.1 kDa) can probably only accommodate 1–2 heparin/HS-binding proteins per molecule. The fact that, in most cases, the IC50 for heparin was substantially lower than the protein concentration used in the biosensor binding assays highlights this point, with LpL being an extreme example, i.e. 50 nm LpL was used in the binding assay but the heparin IC50 was only 2 nm.Ability of Sulfated Cyclitols to Block Protein-HS Interactions on the Optical Biosensor—The next series of experiments utilized the optical biosensor to assess the ability of the 15 above-mentioned sulfated cyclitols to inhibit the binding of the four growth factors (FGF-1, FGF-2, VEGF165, and HGF), two chemokines (IL-8 and eotaxin), and LpL to immobilized heparin. When appropriate the different compounds were compared with PI-88 for their inhibitory activity. As with the data presented in Table I, comparable results were obtained with immobilized heparin and HS, but only the heparin data is presented here.In the case of FGF-1 and FGF-2 binding to immobilized heparin, all 15 sulfated cyclitols exhibited some inhibitory activity. However, a comparison of the percentage inhibition of binding when equimolar concentrations of the inhibitor and growth factor were used is very informative (Fig. 2). In the case of the less sulfated tetrameric cyclitols containing alkyl chain spacers (compounds 2–10), inhibition of FGF-1 binding was most effective and approaching that of PI-88 with the shorter (2–3 carbon atom) alkyl spacers, whereas the converse was true with FGF-2, compounds with alkyl spacers >5 carbon atoms being the most effective (Fig. 2, A and B). Interestingly, the more highly sulfated alkyl chain-linked tetrameric cyclitols (compounds 6a and 10a) were somewhat less effective at inhibiting FGF-2 binding than their less sulfated counterparts (compounds 6 and 10). Alkyl chain length was even more critical in determining the inhibitory activity of the sulfated tetracyclitols for the VEGF165-heparin interaction (Fig. 2C). Compound 2 was essentially inactive, with increasing alkyl chain length from 3–7 carbon atoms steadily increasing inhibitory activity to the level of PI-88. Also, unlike FGF-2, increasing the extent of sulfation of the cyclitol units did not change inhibitory activity, i.e. compare compounds 6a and 10a with 6 and 10. Sulfated tetracyclitols containing a p-xylyl or m-xylyl linker (compounds 11 and 12) or the sulfated pentameric cyclitol (compound 14) were essentially as effective as PI-88 at blocking FGF-1, FGF-2, and VEGF165 binding (Fig. 1D). However, compound 13, a sulfated tetracyclitol linked by a sulfated propylene moiety, was unable to block VEGF165 binding despite being quite an effective inhibitor of the interaction of FGF-1 and FGF-2 with heparin/HS (Fig. 1D). Thus, incorporating a sulfate group in the 3-carbon atom alkyl spacer did not result in inhibitory activity against VEGF165, i.e. both compounds 3 and 13 had little or no VEGF-specific inhibitory activity. Finally, unlike the other heparin/HS-binding growth factors, the binding of HGF (20 nm) to immobilized heparin was not significantly affected by any of the 15 sulfated cyclitols tested. Thus, even when using sulfated cyclitol concentrations as high as 0.5–1.0 μm negligible inhibitory activity was observed (data not shown), despite PI-88 having an IC50 for HGF of 30 nm (Table I).Fig. 2Ability of a range of sulfated linked cyclitols to inhibit the binding of FGF-1, FGF-2, and VEGF to immobilized heparin. Data obtained using an optical biosensor and presented as percentage inhibition of growth factor binding relative to control binding in the absence of an inhibitor. In each case equimolar concentrations of growth factor and inhibitor were used, i.e. 25 nm for FGF-1, 34 nm for FGF-2, and 25 nm for VEGF. The heparan sulfate mimetic, PI-88, was included as a positive control. Inhibitory activity of the alkyl-linked cyclitols is depicted in panels A–C, and that of other linked cyclitols is depicted in panel D.

https://openalex.org/W2019752233,"In the bacterium R. sphaeroides, the polypeptide PufX is indispensable for photosynthetic growth. Its deletion is known to have important consequences on the organization of the photosynthetic apparatus. In the wild-type strain, complexes between the reaction center (RC) and the antenna (light-harvesting complex 1 (LH1)) are associated in dimers, and LH1 does not fully encircle the RC. In the absence of PufX, the complexes become monomeric, and the LH1 ring closes around the RC. We analyzed the functional consequences of PufX deletion. Some effects can be ascribed to the monomerization of the RC·LH1 complexes: the number of RCs that share a common antenna for excitation transfer or a common quinone pool become smaller. We examined the kinetic effects of the closed LH1 ring on quinone turnover: diffusion across LH1 entails a delay of ∼1 ms, and the barrier appears to be located directly against the quinone-binding (secondary quinone acceptor (QB)) pocket. The diffusion of ubiquinol from the RC to the cytochrome bc1 complex is ∼2-fold slower in the mutant, suggesting an increased distance between the two complexes. The properties of the QB pocket (binding of inhibitors, stabilization of QB–, and rate of QB-H2 formation) appear to be modified in the mutant. Another specificity of PufX– is the accumulation of closed centers in the Q –A (where QA is the primary quinone acceptor) state as the secondary acceptor pool becomes reduced, which is probably the origin of photosynthetic incompetence. We suggest that this is related to the QB pocket alterations. The malfunction of the reaction center is probably due to a faulty association with LH1 that is prevented in the PufX-containing structure.

Lavergne J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11203-11213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we examined some functional consequences of the supramolecular arrangement of the photosynthetic apparatus in the purple non-sulfur bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Two main issues were addressed concerning the excitation transfer between the RC 1The abbreviations used are: RC, reaction center; LH, light-harvesting complex; QB, secondary quinone acceptor; WT, wild type; Q, ubiquinone; P, primary donor; QA, primary quinone acceptor; TMPD, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine.·LH1 complexes and the localization of the quinone pool. In both cases, the dimeric association of the RC·LH1 complexes was shown to play an important role. However, the dimeric arrangement of the RC·LH1 complexes is not a general feature in photosynthetic bacteria. For instance, monomeric RC·LH1 complexes from Rhodospirillum rubrum were resolved by electron microscopy from two-dimensional crystals (2Jamieson S.J. Wang P. Qian P. Kirkland J.Y. Conroy M.J.

The three-dimensional structure obtained from x-ray crystallography of complexes from Rhodopseudomonas palustris is also monomeric (6Roszak A.W. Howard T.D. Southall J. Gardiner A.T. Law C.J. Isaacs N.W. Cogdell R.J. Science. 2003; 302: 1969-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). There are also atomic force microscopy data that confirm the dimeric arrangement in R. sphaeroides (7Bahatyrova S. Frese R.N. Siebert C.A. Olsen J.D. Van Der Werf K.O. van Grondelle R. Niederman R.A.

Another important structural feature of the RC·LH1 complexes that differs in the various cases described so far is the open/closed character of the LH1 ring surrounding the RC. LH1 is an oligomeric ring-shaped structure whose building block is a heterodimer of two subunits named α and β (each a transmembrane helix) and binds two bacteriochlorophylls and one carotenoid. In R. sphaeroides, LH1 does not form a closed ring, but an open C-shaped structure. Several αβ-heterodimers with the associated bacteriochlorophylls are missing with respect to a complete closed ring. From biochemical evidence, the number of αβ-heterodimers/RC has been estimated in the range of 10–13 (4Jungas C. Ranck J.L. Rigaud J.L. Joliot P. Verméglio A.

Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 89-92Google Scholar), whereas the “complete” ring is expected to contain 16 heterodimers, as in R. rubrum. From electron microscopy images, a figure of 12 was estimated (4Jungas C. Ranck J.L. Rigaud J.L. Joliot P. Verméglio A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 5Scheuring S. Francia F. Busselez J. Melandri B.A. Rigaud J.L. Levy D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3620-3626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). An open ring has also been obtained in the crystallographic structure of R. palustris (6Roszak A.W. Howard T.D. Southall J. Gardiner A.T. Law C.J. Isaacs N.W. Cogdell R.J. Science. 2003; 302: 1969-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), which includes 15 αβ-heterodimers. The other known structures display closed LH1 rings. In such a case, it is not obvious how the quinone acceptors can efficiently shuttle between their reducing (QB) site on the RC and their oxidizing site on the bc1 complex. To understand the structural causes and functional consequences of the particular supramolecular arrangement found in R. sphaeroides, it is very useful to examine the effects of the deletion of PufX. This small polypeptide, coded in the puf operon (which also contains the genes for the RC and LH1 subunits), appears to play an important role in controlling the supramolecular structure. It is found at a 1:1 ratio with the RC in purified RC·LH1 complexes (14Francia F. Wang J. Venturoli G. Melandri B.A. Barz W.P. Oesterhelt D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6834-6845Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The sequence is indicative of a single transmembrane α-helix with hydrophilic C- and N-terminal loops; a study based on gradual clipping investigated the functional roles of each loop (15Francia F. Wang J. Zischka H. Venturoli G. Oesterhelt D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1877-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The available evidence indicates that the deletion of PufX suppresses the formation of RC·LH1 dimers and that about four additional αβ-units are incorporated to form a closed ring (5Scheuring S.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 690-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Such mutants have lost the ability to grow photosynthetically under anaerobic reducing conditions. Photosynthetic growth is recovered, however, when oxidants such as trimethylamine N-oxide and Me2SO are added to the medium (17Barz W.P. Francia F. Venturoli G. Melandri B.A. Verméglio A.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15248-15258Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). When examined on a single turnover basis, the electron transfer kinetics appear normal. However, a dramatic slowing down of the cyclic flow is observed under steady-state illumination under anaerobic conditions (17Barz W.P. Francia F. Venturoli G. Melandri B.A. Verméglio A.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15248-15258Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It was suggested that the closed LH1 ring around the RC obstructs the shuttling of quinol/quinone between the RC and bc1 complexes. In this work, we compare the functional behavior of membranes from a PufX– mutant and from the WT. The consequences of the monomeric structure appear to be a greater confinement of the quinone pool and more restricted excitation transfer. Special attention is given to the question of quinone exchange on the RC and diffusion to the bc1 complex. We show that the closed LH1 ring results in a rather moderate (∼2-fold) slowing of these processes, indicating that it does not constitute a tight barrier to quinones. However, we found that the PufX deletion results in modified properties of the quinone-binding (QB) pocket of the RC, which may account for the blocking of the RC under reducing conditions. We propose that the main role of PufX is to prevent an incorrect interaction of the RC with LH1, which is responsible for this malfunction. We used the same materials and procedures as described in the preceding article (1Comayras F. Jungas C. Lavergne J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11203-11213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), except those specified below. The strain denoted as WT was R. sphaeroides Ga. The PUFΔX/g strain, with PufX deleted (denoted here as PufX–), was a kind gift of Prof. D. Oesterhelt. Its construction has been described (17Barz W.P. Francia F. Venturoli G. Melandri B.A. Verméglio A. Oesterhelt D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15235-15247Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It was grown under semi-aerobic conditions in Hutner's medium containing kanamycin (25 μg/ml). As reported previously, this strain was unable to grow under photosynthetic conditions (anaerobiosis + light). This strain contains both the LH1 and LH2 antenna complexes. RC·LH1 complexes were isolated as described in the preceding article (1Comayras F. Jungas C. Lavergne J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11203-11213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous work (14Francia F. Wang J. Venturoli G. Melandri B.A. Barz W.P. Oesterhelt D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6834-6845Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the dimer band found in the sucrose gradient with the WT was totally absent in preparations from the PufX– strain. A single RC·LH1 band was observed, and these complexes displayed the characteristic monomer behavior as described in the previous article with respect to excitonic connectivity or sharing of the quinone pool. A difference with respect to monomers prepared from WT membranes was the amount of endogenous quinone retained in the complexes, which was larger (typically 14 Q molecules/RC) than in WT complexes (typically 7 Q molecules/RC), in line with the larger quinone pool found in membranes from this mutant compared with those from the WT (grown under the same conditions). For monitoring absorption changes at subzero temperatures (see Fig. 6), we used our Joliot-type spectrophotometer equipped with the low temperature attachment as described (19Joliot P. Joliot A. Verméglio A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 374-384Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The cuvette accommodates a thin sample layer (≈0.25 mm) between a glass slide and a reflecting metal sheet on a Peltier element. The transmission is measured from the reflected light. The membrane samples used were 10-fold more concentrated than those used in the setup for room temperature experiments, where the optical path was 15 mm. Due to the small optical path, absorption changes can be detected in frozen aqueous samples without addition of glycerol or antifreeze. The temperature is measured with a thermocouple in close thermal contact with the sample. Excitation Transfer—Fig. 1 shows a plot of the normalized variable bacteriochlorophyll fluorescence yield (Φ) as a function of the amount of closed centers (c). The curvature of such a plot is indicative of the degree of “connectivity” of the RC·LH1 complexes, i.e. the probability that the excitation visiting a complex with a closed RC can be made available for other RCs (20Joliot P. Joliot A. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1964; 258: 4622-4625Google Scholar, 21Paillotin G. J. Theor. Biol. 1972; 36: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The data were obtained during the P+Q –A recombination following a saturating flash to stigmatellin-inhibited membranes. The relative fluorescence yield and the amount of P+ (603 nm absorption change) were recorded at discrete times, and each data point is a couple of these values. The Φ(c) relationship obtained with PufX– membranes (Fig. 1, closed circles) displays a smaller curvature than that obtained with WT membranes (open circles and plus signs for membranes from photosynthetic and semi-aerobic cultures, respectively). These curves can be characterized (22Lavergne J. Trissl H.-W. Biophys. J. 1995; 65: 2474-2492Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (225) Google Scholar) by a parameter (J) obtained by a fit with the following function (Equation 1). Φ=c1+J−Jc(Eq. 1) This relation is appropriate for a large and reasonably homogeneous array of RC·antenna complexes. As previously shown (see Ref. 1Comayras F. Jungas C. Lavergne J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11203-11213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar and the associated Supplemental “Experimental Procedures”), it may also be used in a broader context as a phenomenological fitting function. The parameter J expresses the degree of connectivity of RC·LH1 units: the trapping section of an open RC is enhanced by a factor of J + 1 when the neighboring centers become closed. 2In a more general way, the enhancement factor is the derivative dΦ/dc for c = 1 (the slope of Φ(c) at the top right corner of the plot), which can be estimated experimentally, irrespective of any particular model. The allowed interval for J ranges from 0 for isolated units to Jlake = Fm/F0 – 1 (where Fm and F0 are the fluorescence yields for closed and open RCs, respectively) for unrestricted excitonic diffusion (“lake model”). J depends both on the efficiency of antenna connectivity and on the trapping properties of the RC, notably the quenching efficiency of the closed RC. The fit of the PufX– data (Fig. 1, solid line) corresponds to J = 0.32, which may be compared with a value of 0.81 for the WT. This indicates that the RC·LH1 monomers in the PufX– membrane are midway between the situation of completely isolated units and the connectivity observed in the WT, which was determined as essentially due to efficient transfers between the two partners within an RC·LH1 dimer. A likely interpretation is that there is a distribution of the distances between monomers, so some of them behave as isolated units, whereas others are close enough to allow excitation transfer. Photoreduction of the Quinone Pool—Fig. 2 shows the photoreduction kinetics of TMPD (603 nm absorption change) during continuous illumination of PufX– (closed circles) and WT (open circles) membranes. The reaction medium included the set of inhibitors and uncouplers indicated in the preceding article (1Comayras F. Jungas C. Lavergne J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11203-11213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In particular, the bc1 inhibitors myxothiazol and antimycin A were used for blocking quinol oxidation. As explained previously (1Comayras F. Jungas C. Lavergne J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11203-11213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the photo-oxidation of TMPD under such conditions is a mirror image of the photoreduction of the acceptor pool, and we will use these terms as equivalents. The TMPD concentration was 10 mm, allowing reduction of P+ in the 100-μs range; as documented below, this reaction is not rate-limiting in these experiments. The vertical scale indicates the number of electrons transferred per RC, using for calibration the absorption change induced by one saturating flash. The major difference in Fig. 2 between the PufX– and WT kinetics is the overall size of the acceptor pool. It is ∼92 electrons/RC (46 quinones) in the mutant, which is ∼2-fold larger than in the WT. These figures were found to be somewhat variable depending on preparations, but the enlargement of the pool in the mutant was always obvious. Typical figures are 40–60 quinones/RC in PufX– membranes and 25–30 and 15–25 quinones/RC in WT membranes from semi-aerobic and photosynthetic cultures, respectively. The experiments in Fig. 2, which were run at moderate illumination intensity, reveal no obvious slowing of the kinetics in the mutant (in the region where both kinetics can be compared) that could be ascribed to the closed LH1 ring. The experiments described below investigate this issue in a more quantitative manner. Fig. 3 shows a magnification of the initial part of the photoreduction kinetics under high illumination intensity. The kinetics in the PufX– membrane are clearly slower than those in the WT membrane, especially beyond the first 2 electrons (dashed lines). The initial slope (e.g. for the first electron) corresponds (WT curve) to ∼1 electron/700 μs. This is ∼4-fold slower than P+ reduction by TMPD. This initial rate is thus still essentially limited by the photochemical reaction, depending on the light intensity and its collection and trapping efficiencies. The initial rate for the PufX– curve is slower, probably because of the lower LH2 content. Beyond this initial part of the kinetics, a roughly linear section can be identified, as shown by the dashed lines. The slope of this line can be taken as the quasi steady-state rate of quinone reduction in the presence of the oxidized pool. It is representative of the full turnover of the quinone cycle on the QB pocket, including the transfer of 2 electrons and 2 protons, the release of the reduced quinol, and the binding of a fresh oxidized quinone. Fig. 4A shows plots of this rate as a function of the illumination intensity for WT and mutant membranes. Clearly, the rate-limiting step for quinone turnover is 2–3-fold slower in the mutant. To analyze these data, we made the assumption that the turnover of the centers involves sequentially a photochemical reaction, with rate constant αI (where I is the light intensity and α is an efficiency constant), and a dark recovery reaction, with rate constant kr. The intensity dependence of the turnover rate should then be as in Equation 2. v=kr1+krlαI(Eq. 2) The lines in Fig. 4 are best fits of the data using Equation 2. The accessible intensity range was not sufficient to reach the saturated rate kr in the WT membranes, but this may be deduced from the fits, which give kr ≈ 0.57 (PufX– mutant) and 1.29 (WT) electrons per ms and per RC. Therefore, the full turnover of one quinone (2 electrons) on the RC corresponds to time constants (2/kr) of 3.5 and 1.6 ms for the mutant and WT membranes, respectively. This is slower than the electron transfer reactions on the donor side (135 μs) and acceptor side (<100 μs) (23Wraight C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 548: 309-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 24Verméglio A. Trumpower B.L. Function of Quinones in Energy Conserving Systems.

Fig. 4B shows the results of similar experiments run with isolated RC·LH1 complexes. When applied to WT membranes, the isolation procedure described in the preceding article (1Comayras F. Jungas C. Lavergne J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11203-11213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) yielded a major fraction of dimeric complexes and a small amount of monomeric complexes. With PufX– membranes, the RC·LH1 complexes were strictly monomeric, in agreement with Ref. 14Francia F. Wang J. Venturoli G. Melandri B.A. Barz W.P. Oesterhelt D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6834-6845Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar. Both types of complexes retained a 25–30% fraction of the native Q pool. As may be seen, the saturation curves obtained for the dimeric complexes from the WT and for the monomeric complexes from PufX– are similar to those of the corresponding membranes. With RC·LH1 monomers from the WT, we obtained different results depending on the preparation procedure. Fresh WT monomers collected directly from the sucrose gradient had the same maximum rate as the dimers. Further purification on a chromatography column or aging resulted in complexes with a slower turnover, similar to the PufX– complexes. (For the latter, there was no difference between “fresh” and “purified” preparations.) In a preliminary report (27Comayras F. Jungas C. Lavergne J. van der Est A. Bruce D. Photosynthesis: Fundamental Aspects to Global Perspectives. Allen Press, Inc., Lawrence, KS2005Google Scholar), we declared that PufX– and WT monomers behave similarly, but we have now realized that this does not apply to fresh preparations. When first tackling these experiments, we considered it likely that the closed LH1 ring in the PufX– mutant would delimit two quinone pool domains. An internal pool within the ring could react directly with the RC at a fast rate, whereas the quinones from the outside would appear as a slower pool (as illustrated below in Fig. 11A). The results of Figs. 3 and 4 do not support the first proposition since a slower rate-limiting step was observed in the PufX– mutant from the very first quinone turnovers (excluding the initial reduction of the QB bound in the dark). On the other hand, the photoreduction kinetics in the PufX– membranes (see Fig. 2) slow down markedly in the final part, which might be a sign of a kinetic barrier due to the closed ring. The experiment in Fig. 5 was devised to test this possibility. The idea is to compare the kinetics during a continuous illumination pulse (curve 1) or after a dark interruption of several hundred milliseconds (400 ms for curve 2 and 700 ms for curve 3) inserted after reducing a large fraction (about two-thirds) of the total pool. If the slower rate observed during this later part of the photoreduction kinetics were limited by oxidized quinone crossing the LH1 barrier, whereas the “internal pool” would be reduced, then the dark period would allow this diffusional process to continue, reconstituting an oxidized proximal pool. This would predict significantly faster kinetics when resuming the illumination compared with the uninterrupted control. The data of Fig. 5 do not support this prediction. The traces observed when resuming the illumination can be superimposed (open symbols) on curve 1 after a suitable horizontal translation. Fig. 5B shows a zoom of curve 1 and the translated curves 2 and 3. A small fast phase is actually observed (arrow) with an amplitude of ∼2 electrons. It corresponds to the binding of an oxidized QB in the RC pocket during the dark period.Fig. 5Effect of a break in the photoreduction kinetics. A, the photoreduction kinetics were monitored in PufX– membranes without (curve 1) or with an interruption of the illumination pulse at 250 ms for 400 ms (curve 2) or 700 ms (curve 3). Curves 2 and 3 were translated horizontally (▵ and ⋄) for comparison with curve 1 (•). B, a magnification on the relevant region showing the translated kinetics is presented. The first data point of curves 2′ and 3′ is located immediately before the resumption of the illumination. A fast phase is resolved before the kinetics become superimposed with curve 1, as indicated by the arrow. Its extent is ∼2 electrons. (The S.E. is smaller than the size of the symbols in B.)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The preceding results show that the only kinetic barrier resulting from the PufX deletion appears to be located directly at the opening of the QB pocket and that there is no proximal pool, besides QB itself, with privileged access to the RC. This suggests that the LH1 ring is in close contact with this region of the RC. Moreover, this barrier exerts a significant but moderate effect, slowing the turnover rate by slightly >2-fold. This is far from the dramatic blocking suggested by previous reports (17Barz W.P. Francia F. Venturoli G. Melandri B.A. Verméglio A. Oesterhelt D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15235-15247Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 18Barz W.P. Verméglio A. Francia F. Venturoli G. Melandri B.A. Oesterhelt D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15248-15258Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), but it makes the photosynthetic competence of other bacteria with a native closed LH1 ring easier to understand. We wondered whether lowering the temperature would lock the LH1 subunits more tightly and inhibit the quinone turnover in the PufX– mutant. This was not really the case, as illustrated in Fig. 6, which shows photoreduction kinetics run at –22 °C. As described elsewhere (28Ginet N. Comayras F. Lavergne J. van der Est A. Bruce D. Photosynthesis: Fundamental Aspects to Global Perspectives. Allen Press, Inc., Lawrence, KS2005Google Scholar), in this experiment, the bulk medium was frozen, but it appears that a liquid water phase was still in contact with the donor side of the RC, allowing submillisecond reduction of P+ by TMPD over many turnovers. Briefly stated, this view is substantiated by the following observations. Fig. 6 (inset) shows the kinetics of P+ reduction by TMPD following a single turnover flash on both sides (–5 and –10 °C) of the freezing transition of bulk medium. The freezing temperature was around –7 °C when cooling because of a supercooled state of the medium, (Thawing occurred around 0 °C.) The bulk freezing was accompanied by a 5-fold acceleration of the reaction, which presumably reflects an increase in the TMPD concentration in the liquid phase. The reaction rate was still proportional to the concentration of added"

How the bound cofactor (6R)-tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B) participates in Arg hydroxylation is a topic of interest.

The overall reaction involves two separate steps with the first being the NADPH- and O2-dependent hydroxylation of Arg to form Nω-hydroxyl-l-arginine (NOHA) as an enzyme-bound intermediate (Scheme 1). Bound NOHA is then oxidized to citrulline and NO in a second NADPH- and O2-dependent reaction. Both reactions occur within a heme-containing oxygenase domain dimer of NOS (NOSoxy) that receives electrons from two attached flavoprotein domains (3Adak S. Ghosh S. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. J.

The timing of radical formation and the associated visible spectral changes in the iNOSoxy reactions suggested that H4B donates an electron to a heme-dioxy intermediate (FeIIIO2− or FeIIO2) that forms once the ferrous heme of NOS binds molecular oxygen. Reduction of the FeIIIO2− intermediate by H4B is thought to enable the formation of heme-based oxidants that react with Arg or NOHA (14Rusche K.M. Spiering M.M.

In related studies, we demonstrated that 5-methyl-substituted H4B (5MeH4B) could also provide an electron to the FeIIIO2− intermediate and does so 3-fold faster than H4B in iNOSoxy (17Wei C.C.

Three concepts arose from our kinetic studies of the iNOSoxy Arg hydroxylation reaction: (i) formation of the pterin radical is kinetically coupled to reduction of the FeIIIO2− intermediate and to the rate of Arg hydroxylation; (ii) the rate of pterin electron transfer is directly proportional to the stability of the resultant pterin radical; and (iii) a sufficiently fast rate of pterin electron transfer must be maintained for iNOSoxy to couple its FeIIIO2− formation to Arg hydroxylation (18Wang Z.Q.

Chem. 2004; 279: 32243-32251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the kinetic relationships between H4B radical formation, processing of the FeIIIO2− intermediate, and product formation in these NOSs are largely unresolved. Because this knowledge is needed to understand eNOS and nNOS catalysis, we measured and compared the kinetics of heme transitions, pterin radical formation, and Arg hydroxylation in single turnover reactions catalyzed by human eNOSoxy and rat nNOSoxy enzymes that contained H4B or 5MeH4B. Chemicals—[U-14C]Arg was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. H4B and 5MeH4B were obtained from Dr. Schirck's laboratory (Jona, Switzerland). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma or Fisher. Stock solutions of H4B at 10 mm were prepared fresh in water containing 30 mm dithiothreitol, whereas 5MeH4B stock solutions were prepared fresh in 40 mm EPPS, pH 7.5. Protein Expression and Purification—The H4B-free rat nNOSoxy was prepared as described previously (16Adak S. Wang Q. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33554-33561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The plasmid for human eNOSoxy was a kind gift of Anders Aberg at Astra Zeneca. The expression and purification of human eNOSoxy in the presence and absence of H4B was performed as described elsewhere (46Rosenfeld R.J. Garcin E.D. Panda K. Andersson G. Aberg A. Wallace A.V.

The enzyme concentration was determined from the 444 nm absorbance of the ferrous CO complex by using an extinction coefficient of 76 mm–1 cm–1. The concentrated protein was stored in a buffer containing 50 mm EPPS, pH 7.5, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.25 m NaCl. Full-length eNOS and nNOS were purified as described elsewhere (16Adak S. Wang Q. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33554-33561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). UV-visible Spectrometry—Conventional spectra were obtained using a Cary 100 BIO instrument (Varian, Inc) equipped with temperature control and automatic stirring. Kinetic Experiments—Ferrous NOSoxy proteins were prepared as described previously (23Wei C.C. Wang Z.Q. Stuehr D.J. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 354: 320-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Solutions containing concentrated NOSoxy, H4B (or 5MeH4B), and Arg in a buffer (40 mm EPPS, pH 7.5, 0.125 m NaCl) were preincubated for at least 1 h at 4 °C prior to making the sample anaerobic and performing the dithionite titration. To initiate the reaction, the anaerobic ferrous hemeprotein solution was mixed with an O2-containing buffer at 10 °C. The reactions were then monitored using rapid scanning stopped-flow spectroscopy, rapid quench with HPLC product analysis, and rapid freeze with EPR measurements as described previously (12Wei C.C. Wang Z.Q. Wang Q. Meade A.L. Hemann C. Hille R. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 315-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). For rapid quench experiments, the reaction was initiated by mixing an anaerobic solution of 2–5 μm ferrous hemeprotein containing 10 μm [C14]Arg and H4B (5MeH4B) with an equal volume of air-saturated buffer (40 mm EPPS, pH 7.5, 0.125 m NaCl) that contained 1 mm Arg to ensure a single turnover condition with respect to the radiolabeled substrate (24Iwanaga T. Yamazaki T. Kominami S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16629-16635Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The mixture was then aged in the instrument for various times followed by rapid quenching with 1 n HCl solution containing 1 mm citrulline and 1 mm NOHA. Each reacted sample was collected into a vial from the sample loop, and 5 μl of isopropane was added. The resulting solution was vigorously vortexed for 30 min to release the substrate. The work up and amino acid determination was the same as reported previously (12Wei C.C. Wang Z.Q. Wang Q. Meade A.L. Hemann C. Hille R. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 315-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). For the EPR measurements, an anaerobic buffer solution containing substrate, pterin, and ∼400 μm ferrous NOS protein was rapidly mixed at 10 °C with an equal amount of O2-saturated buffer (O2 concentration ∼2.2 mm at 0 °C (10Hurshman A.R. Krebs C. Edmondson D.E. Huynh B.H. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15689-15696Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar)). The mixture was aged for various times, and then ejected into a rapid freezing solution (12Wei C.C. Wang Z.Q. Wang Q. Meade A.L. Hemann C. Hille R. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 315-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) housed in a bath apparatus from Update Instruments, Inc. (Madison, WI). The samples were then kept at liquid nitrogen temperature until measurement. EPR spectra of the frozen samples were recorded in a Bruker ER300 spectrometer equipped with an ER 035 NMR gauss meter and a Hewlett-Packard 5352B microwave power controller. Temperature was controlled using Oxford Instruments ESR 900 continuous flow liquid helium cryostat and ITC4 temperature controller. All spectra were recorded at 150 K using a microwave power of 2 milliwatts, a frequency of 9.5 GHz, a modulation amplitude of 10 G, and a modulation frequency of 100 kHz. Determining the Redox State of H4B after Arg Hydroxylation—This step was performed as described previously (13Wei C.C. Wang Z.Q. Hemann C. Hille R. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46668-46673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μm NOSoxy was incubated with 1 mm H4B (or 5MeH4B) and 10 mm Arg followed by rapid filtration to remove unbound H4B. Additional Arg was then added to the filtrate to compensate for its loss. The NOSoxy sample was then made anaerobic, reduced with dithionite, and mixed with O2-saturated buffer to initiate the reaction. The mixture was allowed to fully react for 1–2 min, aliquots were transferred to the analytical alkaline and acidic iodine/iodide oxidation solutions, and the content of H4B and its oxidation products were determined by HPLC with fluorescence detection. Data Analysis—At least two different batches of each NOSoxy protein were used for the rapid kinetic measurements. Light absorbance spectra of heme species obtained from stopped-flow spectrometry were analyzed using the global analysis software SPECFIT/32 version 3.0 (Spectrum Software Associates, Marlborough, MA). In all cases, the fitting of absorbance cross-sections at specific wavelengths was also performed to check the accuracy. Radical formation and decay rates were determined by fitting using OriginPro 7.5 software (OriginLab Cooperation, Northampton, MA) as described previously (12Wei C.C. Wang Z.Q. Wang Q. Meade A.L. Hemann C. Hille R. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 315-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We first used UV-visible spectroscopy to confirm 5MeH4B binding in our nNOSoxy and eNOSoxy enzymes. In the absence of 5MeH4B and Arg, both proteins had a heme Soret absorbance peak near 420 nm, consistent with previous results (14Rusche K.M. Spiering M.M. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15503-15512Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 16Adak S. Wang Q. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 421-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Adding 5MeH4B at concentrations between 200 μm and 1 mm caused the Soret peak to shift to 400 nm, consistent with 5MeH4B binding (17Wei C.C. Wang Z.Q. Arvai A.S. Hemann C. Hille R. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1969-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The addition of 0.2 mm Arg to these samples caused a further shift in the Soret peak to 390 nm (data not shown). This demonstrated that 5MeH4B and/or Arg were able to stabilize the ferric heme in a high spin state, which is essential for catalytic activity. Using full-length NOS enzymes, we also found that 5MeH4B supported NO synthesis from Arg by eNOS and nNOS as determined by the spectrophotometric oxyhemoglobin assay (activities were 16.7 ± 1.6 and 55 ± 3.1 NO min–1, respectively). These specific activities were equivalent to the activities supported by H4B. We next ran single catalytic turnover reactions using eNOSoxy and nNOSoxy samples that contained Arg plus H4B (or 5MeH4B). The enzymes were reduced to their ferrous forms with dithionite under anaerobic conditions and then were rapidly mixed at 10 °C with an O2-containing buffer to initiate the reaction. We monitored the reactions by rapid scanning UV-visible spectroscopy to follow the kinetics of heme transitions, by rapid freezing EPR spectroscopy to follow the kinetics of biopterin radical buildup and decay, and by rapid quenching and HPLC to follow the kinetics of Arg hydroxylation. Our optical data for the eNOSoxy/H4B single turnover reaction are shown in Fig. 1. Global analysis indicated a best fit to an A to B to C kinetic model, such as we had observed previously in single turnover reactions of iNOSoxy and nNOSoxy (12Wei C.C. Wang Z.Q. Wang Q. Meade A.L.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2332-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The spectra of the three species as determined by the global analysis are shown in Fig. 1A. The calculated spectra matched well with spectral traces that were collected at specific points during the eNOSoxy single turnover reaction (Fig. 1B). The Soret peak positions are listed in Table I. The analysis identifies a beginning ferrous eNOSoxy species with Soret peak at 413 nm, a transient FeIIIO2− intermediate with Soret peak at 429 nm, and the ending ferric enzyme species with Soret peak at 391 nm. The spectrum of our eNOSoxy FeIIIO2− intermediate is similar to that in recent reports (20Berka V. Wu G. Yeh H.C. Palmer G. Tsai A.L. J. Biol.

Fig. 1C shows the change in concentration for each of the three species during the single turnover reaction. The rates of FeIIIO2− formation and decay as determined by the global analysis were 55.6 and 6.7 s–1, respectively (Table II).

Open table in a new tab We next ran single turnover reactions using eNOSoxy that contained 5MeH4B in place of H4B. The optical spectra of the three heme species discerned from global analysis are shown in Fig. 2A. In general, the spectra match those obtained using H4B, except for some modest shifting in the Soret positions (Table I). The calculated spectra match the actual absorbance traces that were collected at specific time points during the reaction, except for the FeIIIO2− intermediate (Fig. 2B), whose Soret position in the collected trace (427 nm) is shifted 3 nm relative to the Soret peak in the global analysis spectrum (430 nm). However, it was estimated that the spectrum collected at 38.8 ms (Fig. 2B) represents a mixture of 53% FeIIIO2−, 26% ferrous, and 21% ferric species. When deconvolution was done to take this into account, it eliminated the apparent blue shift in the collected spectrum such that the Soret peak of the FeIIIO2− species now matched the peak observed in the global analysis spectrum (data not shown). The Soret peak positions for the three eNOSoxy species in the 5MeH4B reaction (Table I), as well as their visible spectral features (Figs. 1A and 2A, insets), were similar to the spectra obtained for the same three species in the H4B-bound eNOSoxy reaction. This implies that 5MeH4B does not significantly alter the electronic properties of these heme species relative to H4B. Fig. 2C shows the change in concentration for all three heme species during the Arg hydroxylation reaction catalyzed by 5MeH4B-bound eNOSoxy, as determined by global analysis. The rate of FeIIIO2− formation was similar to that observed in the reaction of H4B-containing eNOSoxy (60.5 s–1versus 55.6 s–1 respectively, Table II). However, the rate of FeIIIO2− conversion to ferric enzyme was ∼3-fold faster in the 5MeH4B-bound eNOSoxy reaction (Table II). The absorbance at 430 nm versus time of the reaction is shown in Fig. 2D. A fit of this data to the A → B → C kinetic model is shown in Fig. 2D and confirms that the rate of FeIIIO2− disappearance was increased in the 5MeH4B-containing eNOSoxy reaction (k = 26 s–1). We then performed identical experiments using H4B- or 5MeH4B-bound nNOSoxy. The optical spectra and appearance/disappearance kinetics of the three heme species obtained in our present study with the H4B-bound enzyme were very similar to data we reported previously (26Boggs S. Huang L. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2332-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and are summarized in Tables I and II. When 5MeH4B replaced H4B in nNOSoxy, it caused a modest shift in the Soret peaks of the ferrous and FeIIIO2− species relative to those observed in the H4B reaction (Table I) and also increased the rate of FeIIIO2− conversion to ferric nNOSoxy from 24.2 to 56.3 s–1 (Table II). We next studied the kinetics of biopterin radical formation and decay in the Arg single turnover reactions catalyzed by eNOSoxy and nNOSoxy. Biopterin radical signals that built up during the reactions catalyzed by H4B- or 5MeH4B-bound eNOSoxy are shown in Fig. 3. Similar biopterin radical signals built up in the reactions catalyzed by nNOSoxy (data not shown) and in iNOSoxy (17Wei C.C. Wang Z.Q. Arvai A.S. Hemann C. Hille R. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1969-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The biopterin radicals were centered at g = 2.0 and had a peak to trough width of ∼40 G. There was an additional hyperfine structure present in the radical signals from the 5MeH4B-bound eNOSoxy (Fig. 3) and nNOSoxy (data not shown) reactions. These EPR spectral characteristics are highly similar to the H4B and 5MeH4B radicals that were found to form in iNOSoxy during Arg single turnover reactions run under identical conditions (17Wei C.C.

Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13287-13303Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Lowering the EPR measurement temperature to 4 K did not alter the line shape of the biopterin radical signals, and doubling the 5MeH4B concentration in the reactions did not increase the intensity of radical signal accumulation (data not shown). We detected no EPR signals in control reactions that contained biopterin-free NOSoxy enzymes run under identical conditions. Together, these data confirm that bound H4B and 5MeH4B are oxidized to their radicals in eNOSoxy and nNOSoxy during the Arg single turnover reaction, which is consistent with previous results (17Wei C.C.

It has been suggested that loss of function in parkin causes accumulation and aggregation of its substrates, leading to death of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson disease. Using the yeast two-hybrid screen, we isolated a RING finger protein that interacted with the N terminus of parkin in a Drosophila cDNA library. Interaction between human parkin and the mammalian RING finger protein homologue Nrdp1/FLRF, a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase that ubiquitinates ErbB3 and ErbB4, was validated by in vitro binding assay, co-immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence co-localization. Significantly, pulse-chase experiments showed that cotransfection of Nrdp1 and parkin reduced the half-life of parkin from 5 to 2.5 h. Consistent with these findings, we further observed that degradation of CDCrel-1, a parkin substrate, was facilitated by overexpression of parkin protein. However, co-transfection of Nrdp1 with parkin reversed the effects of parkin on CDCrel-1 degradation. We conclude that Nrdp1 is a parkin modifier that accelerates degradation of parkin, resulting in a reduction of parkin activity. Parkin is a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase.

PD patients experience slowness of movement, rigidity, tremor, difficulty with balance, and variable manifestation of dementia.

Autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism (AR-JP) was mapped to the long arm of chromosome 6 (6q25.2-q27) and is linked strongly to the markers D6S305 and D6S253 (18Matsumine H. Saito M.

Parkin is one of the largest genes in the human genome. It spans more than 1.5 megabases and has 12 exons and huge introns. A 4.5-kilobase transcript is expressed in many human tissues and is abundant in the brain. The parkin gene encodes a protein of 465 amino acids with a molecular mass of about 52 kDa (20Kitada T. Asakawa S. Hattori N. Matsumine H. Yamamura Y. Minoshima S. Yokochi M. Mizuno Y. Shimizu N. Nature. 1998; 392: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (4231) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence of parkin showed similarity to ubiquitin at the N terminus. The C terminus of parkin contains two RING finger motifs and in between RING finger domain. Further studies demonstrate that parkin possesses E3 ligase activity (28Shimura H. Hattori N. Kubo S. Mizuno Y. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Iwai K. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Suzuki T. Nat.

In PD patients, it is presumed that the ability of parkin to ubiquitinate these substrates is diminished because of mutations or deletions in the gene, leading to their accumulation and aggregation that result in the death of nigral neurons. To identify additional potential factors that are involved in PD, we used the yeast two-hybrid screen. We report here that parkin interacts with a RING finger domain protein FLRF/Nrdp1 (37Abdullah J.M. Li X. Nachtman R.G. Jurecic R. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2001; 27: 320-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). FLRF/Nrdp1 is also an ubiquitin E3 ligase that ubiquitinates neuregulin receptors ErbB3 and ErbB4 (38Qiu X.B. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14843-14848Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 39Diamonti A.J. Guy P.M. Ivanof C. Wong K. Sweeney C. Carraway III, K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2866-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that FLRF/Nrdp1 promotes degradation of parkin protein and stabilizes a parkin substrate CDCrel-1. Our findings suggest that parkin and Nrdp1/FLRF may form a complex that regulate activities of E3 ligases and thereby the metabolisms of their substrates. The Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The N terminus of the Drosophila parkin (dparkin) cDNA was amplified by PCR and cloned into pGKBT7 to encode a hybrid protein containing the DNA-binding domain of Gal4. Expression of the chimeras in yeast was determined by Western blot analysis. Yeast cells of the AH109 reporter strain were sequentially transformed with the dparkin/pGKBT7 construct and then with a Drosophila expression library containing cDNAs fused to sequence of the GAL4 trans-activation domain in pACT2 vector (Clontech). Transformants were selected on S.D.-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp selection medium. Positive clones were tested for β-galactosidase and α-galactosidase activities. Expression Vectors and Antibodies—For mammalian expression, hparkin is cloned into pcDNA 3.1 with a Myc tag at its N terminus, whereas N-terminal HA-tagged Nrdp1 was generated in pcDNA 3.0. Nrdp1-FLAG and Nrdp1-CT-FLAG were obtained from Dr. Alfred Goldberg, Harvard Medical School. FLAG-tagged CDCrel-1 was from Dr. W. S. Trimble, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) or GST-Nrdp1 was produced from constructs in pGEX-4T-1 vector. Anti-HA antibody 12CA5 is from Roche Applied Science. Anti-tubulin antibody is from Oncogene. Anti-FLAG M2 antibody and fluorescence-conjugated anti-Myc and anti-FLAG antibodies are from Sigma. Anti-Myc 9E10 is from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-parkin antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). In Vitro Interactions—For in vitro binding assay, Myc-hparkin, HA-Nrdp1, and luciferase peptides labeled with [35S]methionine were generated using the Promega TnT kit and mixed and rocked in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and the proteinase inhibitors). Myc or HA antibody was employed to precipitate either Myc-hparkin or HA-Nrdp1, and the co-immunoprecipitated Nrdp1 or hparkin was separated by SDS-PAGE and then analyzed by a PhosphorImager. In a separate experiment, bacterially expressed GST-Nrdp1 was produced and purified. Glutathione-Sepharose beads bound to GST-fusion proteins were washed with binding buffer and rocked with aliquots of in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled hparkin proteins for 1 h at 4 °C in binding buffer. The beads were washed with binding buffer and then boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The proteins binding to GST-Nrdp1 beads were resolved on SDS-PAGE and detected by a PhosphorImager. Domains of hparkin that bind to Nrdp1 were mapped with hparkin C-terminal or N-terminal TnT-translated peptides. Western Blot Analysis, Pulse-Chase, and Co-immunoprecipitation— Epitope-tagged cDNAs (HA-Nrdp1 or Nrdp1-FLAG (38Qiu X.B. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14843-14848Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and Myc-hparkin or FLAG-CDCrel-1) were co-transfected into C33A cells. Western blot analysis was carried out by using anti-Myc 9E10, anti-HA 12CA5, anti-FLAG M2, or anti-parkin antibodies. For co-immunoprecipitation, extracts were first reacted with antibody to the epitope of hparkin (9E10) or of Nrdp1 (HA, 12CA5) and after the complexes were washed HA-Nrdp1 or Myc-hparkin protein was detected in immunoprecipitates by Western blot analysis with 12CA5 or 9E10 antibodies. For pulsechase analysis, two methods were used. (a) Cells were chased with 12 μg/ml of cycloheximide. CDCrel-1 was analyzed by Western blot using anti-FLAG M2 antibody. (b) Cells were labeled with [35S]methionine and chased up to 16 h. Myc-hparkin or FLAG-CDCrel-1 was immunoprecipitated by using anti-Myc 9E10 or anti-FLAG M2 antibodies. Precipitated proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and quantitated by a PhosphorImager. For quantification, three independent experiments were performed. Immunofluorescence Co-localization—Human C33A cells were cultured on glass cover slips and co-transfected with Myc-hparkin and Nrdp1-FLAG. After 48 h, cells were fixed in 4% of paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized in 0.1% of Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min, and blocked with 3% milk and 3% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h. The cells were incubated with primary antibodies against either Myc or FLAG that had been fluorescence-conjugated (Sigma). In a separate experiment, transfected PC12 cells were treated with 50 ng/ml of nerve growth factor for 7 days, fixed, and stained with anti-Myc and anti-FLAG antibodies or anti-parkin antibody. The localization of proteins was visualized by a fluorescence microscopy. To identify potential parkin substrates or modifiers, we employed the yeast two-hybrid screen. The N terminus of Drosophila parkin cDNA (1–576 bps) was cloned into pGKBT7 vector (Matchmaker III from Clontech) and verified by sequencing and Western blot analysis (data not shown). After sequential transformation of the pGBKT7 dparkin bait and the Drosophila pACT2 cDNA library, three clones that activated all three GAL4-responsive markers His3, Mel1, and LacZ reporter genes in AH109 were isolated. Sequence analysis revealed that one of these proteins is the homologue of mammalian Nrdp1/FLRF, a RING finger E3 ligase (37Abdullah J.M. Li X. Nachtman R.G. Jurecic R. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2001; 27: 320-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) that ubiquitinates neuregulin receptors ErbB3 and ErbB4 (38Qiu X.B. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14843-14848Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 39Diamonti A.J. Guy P.M. Ivanof C. Wong K. Sweeney C. Carraway III, K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2866-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The Drosophila protein, here referred to as dNrdp1, interacted specifically with dparkin in a yeast two-hybrid mating assay. dNrdp1 has an open reading frame of 951 base pairs, encoding a 317 amino acid protein. Nrdp1s between human and Drosophila share a high 57% identity and 78% similarity, indicating a structural and possibly functional conservation (37Abdullah J.M. Li X. Nachtman R.G. Jurecic R. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2001; 27: 320-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To validate whether the interaction also occurs with the human proteins, in vitro binding assays were carried out. [35S]Methionine-labeled HA-Nrdp1, Myc-hparkin, and the luciferase control were generated using coupled in vitro transcription/translation TnT kit. In vitro immunoprecipitation analysis was performed from binding mixtures of hparkin and Nrdp1 or controls. Co-precipitated proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed using a PhosphorImager. The Nrdp1 band was clearly observed from hparkin precipitates, whereas hparkin was pulled down by HA-Nrdp1 (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained when FLAG was tagged to the Nrdp1 C terminus (data not shown). An in vitro interaction between hparkin and Nrdp1 was also demonstrated by mixing equivalent aliquots of the [35S]-labeled hparkin with purified GST or GST-Nrdp1 fusion protein (Fig. 1B). GST or GST-Nrdp1 fusion proteins were adsorbed to glutathione-agarose beads. In vitro translated hparkin was specifically retained on the beads by the GST-Nrdp1 fusion protein but not parental GST peptide, indicating specific binding between hparkin and Nrdp1 (Fig. 1B). Further experiment by in vitro binding assays mapped the binding between hparkin and Nrdp1 to the hparkin N terminus (hp-NT) (Fig. 1B), consistent with the results from the yeast two-hybrid assays. To investigate interactions between parkin and Nrdp1 in vivo, Myc-hparkin and HA-Nrdp1 were co-transfected into C33A cells for co-immunoprecipitation analysis. To minimize degradation of parkin by Nrdp1, we used N-terminal-tagged HA-Nrdp1 (38Qiu X.B. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14843-14848Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Anti-HA (12CA5) antibody was used to precipitate Nrdp1 protein from C33A cell lysates. Co-immunoprecipitated hparkin was detected from cells co-transfected with Myc-hparkin and HA-Nrdp1 but not from control cells that were co-transfected with Myc-hparkin and a HA-vector (Fig. 2B). In a separate experiment, we employed anti-Myc 9E10 antibody to co-immunoprecipitate Myc-hparkin and HA-Nrdp1. The negative control cells transfected with Myc-vector and HA-Nrdp1 showed no detectable HA-Nrdp1 protein pulled down, whereas a clear band of HA-Nrdp1 was detected from the anti-Myc precipitates in cells co-transfected with HA-Nrdp1 and Myc-hparkin, demonstrating interactions between these two proteins endogenously (Fig. 2A). To further characterize interactions between parkin and Nrdp1, C33A and PC12 cells were cultured on glass cover slips and co-transfected with Myc-hparkin and Nrdp1-FLAG. Immunofluorescence analysis was carried out with fluorescence-conjugated anti-Myc and anti-FLAG antibodies or anti-parkin antibody and then a fluorescence-labeled secondary antibody in cells treated or untreated with nerve growth factor. The co-localization of hparkin and Nrdp1 was visualized in cell bodies as well as neuronal processes (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Parkin and Nrdp1 are co-localized. Cells were cultured on glass coverslips and co-transfected with Myc-parkin and Nrdp1-FLAG. Immunolocalization was carried out by anti-parkin and anti-FLAG primary antibodies and then fluorescein isothiocyanate and Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (A) or a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) and a Cy3-conjugated anti-Myc 9E10 antibody (B). Cellular localization of Nrdp1 and parkin was analyzed by a fluorescence microscope. PC12 cells were induced by nerve growth factor for 7 days.

A. 2002; 99: 2866-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), next we tested whether Nrdp1 or parkin affects their stability or activity. We performed a pulse-chase experiment. C33A cells that were co-transfected with plasmids were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 3 h. [35S]-labeled proteins were then chased for 0, 1.5, 3, 5, or up to 16 h in cells co-transfected with Myc-hparkin and Nrdp1-FLAG, Nrdp1-CT-FLAG or a control. Myc-hparkin was immunoprecipitated using 9E10 antibody and analyzed on SDS-PAGE gels and then a PhosphorImager (Fig. 4A). Expression of Myc-parkin was quantitated (Fig. 4B). Our results show that the half-life of hparkin is about 5 h in the absence of Nrdp1 in C33A cells consistent with the previous reports (31Zhang Y. Gao J. Chung K.K. Huang H. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13354-13359Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of Nrdp1 reduces parkin half-life to 2.5 h (Fig. 4B), indicating that Nrdp1 accelerates parkin degradation. However, in contrast to the previous report (38Qiu X.B. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14843-14848Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), the C terminus of Nrdp1 does not have dominant effects on degradation of parkin. Significantly, we also demonstrated by pulse-chase assays that accelerated degradation of hparkin downstream substrate CDCrel-1 was abrogated with Nrdp1 overexpression (Fig. 5). In this experiment, plasmids of FLAG-CDCrel-1, Myc-hparkin, and Nrdp1-FLAG were transfected in C33A cells individually or in combination. Cells were labeled with [35S]methionine and then chased up to 16 h. FLAG-CDCrel-1 was immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibody M2, resolved on SDS-PAGE gels, and then quantitated in a PhosphorImager (Fig. 5, A and B). In the absence of exogenous parkin expression, the half-life of CDCrel-1 is ∼8 h, whereas overexpression of parkin accelerated CDCrel-1 turnover with a half-life of 5 h. However, CDCrel-1 was re-stabilized when both hparkin and Nrdp1 were co-transfected (Fig. 5, A and B), indicating that Nrdp1 affected CDCrel-1 turnover not directly but rather via modulating parkin activity. Similar results were obtained in C33A cells when cycloheximide was used in co-transfected C33A cells (Fig. 5, C and D). We conclude that Nrdp1 not only affects hparkin stability but also activity on its downstream substrates.Fig. 5Interaction between Nrdp1 and parkin reduces parkin activity on CDCrel-1. C33A cells were co-transfected with Nrdp1-FLAG, Myc-hparkin, and FLAG-CDCrel-1 constructs or controls. A and B, cells were labeled with [35S]methionine for 3 h and then chased up to 16 h. Immunoprecipitation was carried out with M2 antibody. Precipitated FLAG-CDCrel-1 was resolved on SDS-PAGE (B) and quantitated by PhosphorImager (A). C and D, transfected cells were treated with 12 μm cycloheximide (CHX) for 0–16 h. CDCrel-1 expression was analyzed by Western blot (D) using FLAG antibody M2 and quantitated (C).

The down-regulation of parkin expression in Drosophila that overexpresses synuclein or Pael-R results in more significant reduction in the number of dopaminergic neurons. On the other hand, up-regulation of parkin expression in Drosophila alleviated phenotypic abnormalities caused by overexpression of either synuclein or Pael-R (45Yang Y. Nishimura I. Imai Y. Takahashi R. Lu B. Neuron. 2003; 37: 911-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). These results suggest that functional studies of parkin and its substrates/regulators in Drosophila may provide important insides on the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease. In this report, we demonstrate that a Drosophila ubiquitin E3 ligase not only interacts with parkin but also affects parkin stability and activity. It would be interesting and useful to generate Drosophila models with either overexpressed Nrdp1 or suppressed expression of Nrdp1. Regulation on parkin expression as well as on biological functions of parkin by Nrdp1 can then be investigated by crossing these animals with Drosophila models for parkin, synuclein, and Pael-R. One of the most important questions about our findings is whether Nrdp1 plays a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease. We have demonstrated that overexpression of Nrdp1 reduces the parkin half-life from 5 to 2.5 h. It is reasonable to presume that increased Nrdp1 activity in brain would significantly reduce the level of parkin protein, resulting in accumulation of parkin substrates (Fig. 6). Although there is no direct evidence that the Nrdp1 locus on chromosome 12q13 (37Abdullah J.M. Li X. Nachtman R.G. Jurecic R. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2001; 27: 320-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) is linked to familiar PDs, our results in this report and the fact that significant reduction of parkin results in more death of dopaminergic neurons in Drosophila with overexpression of α-synuclein or Pael-R (45Yang Y. Nishimura I. Imai Y. Takahashi R. Lu B. Neuron. 2003; 37: 911-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) raise a possibility that Nrdp1 may modify phenotypes of Parkinson disease by reducing the level of parkin protein. It is also possible that Nrdp1 is directly involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. Parkin contains two RING domains and is a ubiquitin E3 ligase. Parkin ubiquitinates its substrates and facilitates their degradation. It is widely suggested that loss of function in parkin causes accumulation and aggregation of these substrates, resulting in death of dopaminergic neurons. However, recent studies in mice with parkin knock-out demonstrated that absence of parkin protein has no effects on stability of its substrates, namely CDCrel-1, Pael-R, and synuclein (43Goldberg M.S. Fleming S.M. Palacino J.J. Cepeda C. Lam H.A. Bhatnagar A. Meloni E.G. Wu N. Ackerson L.C. Klapstein G.J. Gajendiran M. Roth B.L. Chesselet M.F. Maidment N.T. Levine M.S. Shen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43628-43635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, overexpression of parkin reduced severity of phenotypes caused by overexpression of synuclein and Pael-R by unknown mechanisms other than by simply reduction of its substrate proteins (45Yang Y. Nishimura I. Imai Y. Takahashi R. Lu B. Neuron. 2003; 37: 911-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Furthermore, no or few Lewy bodies or Lewy neurites were observed in PD patients with parkin mutations although AR-JP patients with mutations in the parkin show a severe loss of DA neurons. All these results indicate that besides promoting degradation of its substrates, parkin may have other cellular functions in cell death. Under this assumption, we hypothesize that regulation of parkin and Nrdp1 complexes may play significant roles in the pathogenesis of PD by modulating signal pathways including the epidermal growth factor pathway (ErbB receptors) (Fig. 6). Therefore, it would be imperative to examine expression levels as well as distribution of both parkin and Nrdp1 proteins in PD and control brains.

https://openalex.org/W2160002562,"Chloroplasts contain a novel type of signal recognition particle (cpSRP) that consists of two proteins, cpSRP54 and cpSRP43. cpSRP is involved in the post-translational targeting of the nuclear encoded light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding proteins (LHCPs) to the thylakoid membrane by forming a soluble cpSRP·LHCP transit complex in the stroma. Despite high sequence homology between chloroplast and cytosolic SRP54 proteins, the 54-kDa subunit of cpSRP is unique in its ability to bind cpSRP43. In this report, we identified a 10-amino acid long segment of cpSRP54 that forms the cpSRP43-binding site. This segment is located at position 530–539 close to the C terminus of cpSRP54. In addition, we demonstrate that arginine at position 537 is essential for binding cpSRP43 and that mutation of arginine 536 drastically reduced cpSRP43 binding. Mutations within the cpSRP43-binding site of cpSRP54 that reduced or completely abolished cpSRP complex formation also did inhibit transit complex formation and integration of LHCP into the thylakoid membrane, reflecting the importance of these residues for LHCP targeting. Alignment studies revealed that the cpSRP43-binding site is conserved in chloroplast SRP54 proteins and is not present in any SRP54 subunit of cytosolic SRPs."
https://openalex.org/W1995620315,"α-Methylacyl-CoA racemase (Amacr) catalyzes the racemization of α-methyl-branched CoA esters. Sequence comparisons have shown that this enzyme is a member of the family III CoA transferases. The mammalian Amacr is involved in bile acid synthesis and branched-chain fatty acid degradation. In human, mutated variants of Amacr have been shown to be associated with disease states. Amino acid sequence alignment of Amacrs and its homologues from various species revealed 26 conserved protic residues, assumed to be potential candidates as catalytic residues. Amacr from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MCR) was taken as a representative of the racemases. To determine their importance for efficient catalysis, each of these 26 protic residues of MCR was mutated into an alanine, respectively, and the mutated variants were overexpressed in Escherichia coli. It was found that four variants (R91A, H126A, D156A, and E241A) were properly folded but had much decreased catalytic efficiency. Apparently, Arg91, His126, Asp156, and Glu241 are important catalytic residues of MCR. The importance of these residues for catalysis can be rationalized by the 1.8 Å resolution crystal structure of MCR, which shows that the catalytic site is at the interface between the large and small domain of two different subunits of the dimeric enzyme. This crystal structure is the first structure of a complete enzyme of the bile acid synthesis pathway. It shows that MCR has unique structural features, not seen in the structures of the sequence related formyl-CoA transferases, suggesting that the family III CoA transferases can be subdivided in at least two classes, being racemases and CoA transferases. α-Methylacyl-CoA racemase (Amacr) catalyzes the racemization of α-methyl-branched CoA esters.

Amacr is a cofactor-independent racemase, which interconverts the R and S-chirality of the 2-methyl carbon atom of a 2-methyl-thioester molecule. Currently there is no structural information on this class of enzymes. Detailed structural enzymological studies of other cofactor independent racemases and epimerases have been reported, for example on mandelate racemase (23.Hasson M.S. Schlichting I. Moulai J. Taylor K. Barrett W. Kenyon G.L. Babbitt P.C. Gerlt J.A. Petsko G.A. Ringe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2002; 319: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and d-ribulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase (26.Jelakovic S. Kopriva S. Suss K.H. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), which are all proposed to work via the initial abstraction of a proton from the chiral carbon atom. Each of these enzymes catalyze an overall 1,1-proton transfer reaction and have two catalytic protic residues, which are required for (i) the initial proton abstraction from the substrate and for (ii) the subsequent proton donation to the intermediate. The protic residues in these examples are a lysine/histidine pair, two lysines, two cysteines, and two aspartates in, respectively, mandelate racemase, l-Ala-d/l-Glu epimerase, aspartate racemase, and the ribulose epimerase. Interconversion of the α-methyl group and the α-hydrogen atom in the Amacr-catalyzed racemization is also presumed to occur via a two-base mechanism involving two protic residues (1.Schmitz W. Fingerhut R. Conzelmann E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To test this presumption, we mapped here the conserved protic amino acid residues in Amacr and related proteins by a multiple amino acid sequence alignment. Subsequently, an Amacr homologue from the eubacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis, referred to as MCR, was taken as a model protein. M. tuberculosis is the causative organism of tuberculosis. This disease is widespread, causing the death of approximately 2 million human beings every year (27.Snider D.E.J. Raviglione M. Kochi A. Bloom B.R. Tuberculosis, Pathogenesis, Protection and Control. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 2-11Google Scholar, 28.Rouhi A.M. Chem. Eng. News. 1999; 77: 52-69Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Further understanding at the atomic detail of its metabolism will contribute much toward discovering specific drugs for curing this disease. In this respect it is noteworthy that it has been shown that MCR plays a critical role in the β-oxidation of methylbranched alkanes in Mycobacterium (29.Sakai Y. Takahashi H. Wakasa Y. Kotani T. Yurimoto H. Miyachi N. Van Veldhoven P.P. Kato N. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 7214-7220Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). MCR has a high sequence identity with mouse, rat, and human Amacr of 41, 44, and 43%, respectively. Preliminary studies (30.Bhaumik P. Kursula P. Ratas V. Conzelmann E. Hiltunen J.K. Schmitz W. Wierenga R.K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) indeed show that MCR releases [3H]H2O with similar efficiency as mouse (2.Kotti T.J. Savolainen K. Helander H.M. Yagi A.

Fingerhut R. Conzelmann E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and human (31.Schmitz W. Albers C. Fingerhut R. Conzelmann E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) Amacr, when incubated in the presence of 10 μm [2-3H]pristanoyl-CoA. In the biochemical studies reported here conserved protic amino acid residues in MCR were mutated in turn to alanine and the mutated variants were overexpressed and characterized in vitro. Four protic residues, which are important for efficient racemization, were identified. Complementary to these studies the structure determination of MCR at 1.8 Å resolution is reported. This is the first structure of a complete enzyme of the bile acid synthesis pathway. The importance of the four protic residues for binding and catalysis can be rationalized from this structure. Sequence Comparisons—We took as a working hypothesis that the racemization is conducted via acid-base transfer reaction(s), catalyzed by protic residues in Amacrs. Sequence alignments were used to select potential protic catalytic residues. Altogether 28 sequences were collected from the Swiss-Prot data base using Blast and Fasta algorithms and aligned using the Clustal X program (32.Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35495) Google Scholar). This set includes active bacterial and mammalian Amacr sequences, as well as Amacr-related sequences. The obtained sequence alignment suggested the positions of conserved protic amino acid residues (histidine, lysine, arginine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, tyrosine, serine, and cysteine) (see supplemental Fig. 1). These residues were regarded as potential catalytic residues and selected for mutagenesis. Cloning and Expression—The MCR gene (from M. tuberculosis) was cloned into expression vector pET3α (Novagen, Madison, WI) and used as a template for PCR reactions for generating the mutants with MCR-specific primers (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) using a QuickChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The primers were designed so that the desired conserved protic residue would be changed to alanine (see supplemental Table I). Also the two variants corresponding to the known disease causing missense mutations were made. The plasmids, containing the MCR and mutated variants, were transformed into supercompetent E. coli cells, supplied with the mutagenesis kit. Bacteria were grown, plasmid DNAs were extracted, and introduced mutations were verified with automated sequencing with ABI PRISM 5700 (Amersham Biosciences). Extracted plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS cells and the mutated MCRs were overexpressed in Luria Broth medium containing 50 mg/liter ampicillin and 34 mg/liter chloramphenicol with 2% isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction, as described previously for the wild-type MCR (30.Bhaumik P.

Activity Measurements—The interconversion of α-methylacyl-CoA by MCR and rat Amacr was measured with (S)-2-methylmyristoyl-CoA as substrate, with the gas-liquid chromatography method as described previously (1.Schmitz W. Fingerhut R. Conzelmann E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The enzyme assay for measuring enzyme activities of wild-type MCR and its variants was done by measuring the release of 3H from [2-3H]pristanoyl-CoA (20 μm, 6.45 Ci/mol) as described (1.Schmitz W. Fingerhut R. Conzelmann E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, the appropriately diluted enzyme sources were incubated with the labeled racemic substrate in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% octylglycoside and 10 μg BSA at 37 °C for 30 min. The reactions were terminated with 450 μl of 1% trichloroacetic acid, and [3H]H2O was separated from unreacted substrate on reverse-phase silica gel (RP-18) and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. For the determination of Vmax and Km the substrate concentration was 56.0, 75.6, 164.5, and 200 μm respectively. The activity is expressed in units (μmol/min) per mg of protein. Western Blot Analysis—For the determination of the presence of wild-type MCR and its variants in the supernatants of lysed induced E. coli cells, samples of each supernatant were applied on SDS gels. Western blots were made using as primary antibody rabbit anti-mouse Amacr antibody, which cross-reacts with MCR. Racemase activities of the unpurified MCR mutants were obtained by activity measurements at a substrate concentration of 20 μm, using diluted supernatants as enzyme source. The observed enzyme activities were normalized with respect to the amount of racemase in the supernatant by scanning of the Western blot gels and by quantification of the bands using the software package Quantity One (Bio-Rad). Purification and CD Spectroscopy—The overexpressed wild-type and mutated MCRs were purified from E. coli extracts as discussed (30.Bhaumik P. Kursula P. Ratas V. Conzelmann E. Hiltunen J.K.

The resulting samples were further applied onto a size exclusion Superdex 200® HR 10/30 column (in equilibrium with 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.8, containing 1 mm reduced dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm NaN3; the measuring buffer), and the fractions containing MCR were pooled and concentrated. Absorption at 280 nm was used for adjustment of the protein concentrations of the samples for CD spectroscopy, which was carried out using a Jasco J710 spectropolarimeter at 22 °C. The far-UV spectra of the proteins (0.1 mg ml–1) were measured from 200 to 250 nm in measuring buffer, with the following instrument settings: response, 2 s; sensitivity, 100 millidegrees; speed, 50 nm/min; average of 30 scans. The molar ellepticities were calculated with Jasco software. Crystallization and Data Collection—Well diffracting crystals of the wild-type MCR were grown at 22 °C by the hanging-drop, vapor-diffusion method (reservoir 1.52 m ammonium phosphate and 10 mm BaCl2 at pH 7.0) in drops of 2-μl volume containing 1:1 (v/v) mixture of reservoir and protein solution (6 mg ml–1 in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH = 8.8). These well diffracting crystals, which were only the minor crystal form in the initial crystallization experiments (30.Bhaumik P. Kursula P. Ratas V. Conzelmann E. Hiltunen J.K. Schmitz W. Wierenga R.K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), belong to a monoclinic space group, C2, with cell dimensions of a = 180.1 Å, b = 79.8 Å, c = 117.6 Å and β = 92.03°. Assuming four subunits (two dimers) per asymmetric unit, we obtained a VM value of 2.6 Å3/Da, corresponding to a solvent content of 55% (33.Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7922) Google Scholar). The heavy atom derivatives of methyl mercuricacetate (MMA, C3H6HgO2) and monosodium salt of p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid (PCMPS, C6H4ClHgO3SNa) were obtained by soaking native protein crystals in a solution of heavy atom compounds in mother liquor at a concentration of 1.0 mm for 30–40 min. All the data sets were collected under cryogenic conditions using a synchrotron radiation source (EMBL-outstation at DESY, Hamburg, Germany). Crystals were transferred from the crystallization drop to the cryoprotectant solution (mother liquor containing also 24% glycerol) using nylon loops and immediately flash-frozen in a cold nitrogen gas stream at 100 K just before data collection. For the data collection of the heavy atom derivatised crystals, the crystals were frozen using the same cryoprotectant solution, containing also 1.0 mm heavy atom derivative. The data collection was performed by the oscillation method using a CCD detector. The native data set was collected using beamline X11 (λ = 0.8122 Å) and the derivative data sets were collected using beamline X13 (λ = 0.8042 Å). The data sets were processed using program packages DENZO (34.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38572) Google Scholar), XDS (35.Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3233) Google Scholar), and CCP4 (36.Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19769) Google Scholar). Structure Determination and Structure Refinement—The initial phases were obtained with the MIRAS method. The program SOLVE (37.Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar) was used for finding and refining the heavy atom positions. 7 and 8 sites were used in the MIRAS calculations for the MMA and PCMPS data sets, respectively. The mean figure of merit of the refined phases was 0.50 at 2.5 Å resolution. Extensive fragments of each dimer were built in this map by the automatic model building procedures of RESOLVE (38.Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). By superimposing these fragments on each other the matrices relating the four subunits were obtained and 4-fold averaging plus phase extension till 1.8 Å was carried out with DM (39.Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. Daresbury Laboratory, Daresbury, UK1994: 34-38Google Scholar). Then the improved electron density map at 1.8 Å resolution was used for automated model building with RESOLVE. The program could build about 60% of the side chains of all four subunits. Then iterative cycles of model refinement with REFMAC5 (40.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar) and model building in electron density maps using program O (41.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) were carried out. Initially very tight NCS restraints were used for the refinement, but slowly the restraints were released as the model was getting more complete and at the end of the refinement only loose NCS restraints were used. The overall anisotropy was modeled with TLS parameters, using only two TLS groups, being the two dimers of the asymmetric unit. PROCHECK (42.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) was used to monitor the stereochemistry of the model. In the final model six residues (1.Schmitz W. Fingerhut R. Conzelmann E. Eur. J.

All other residues are well defined in the map. There are no structural differences between the four monomers; for example the r.m.s difference for the 354 common Cα atoms of the A-subunit of one of the dimers with each of the three other monomers is 0.2 Å. There are 1457 waters, 1 phosphate ion, and 15 glycerol molecules in the model.

Expression of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), an immunosuppressive cytokine, has been associated in vivo with Aβ accumulation in transgenic mice and recently with Aβ clearance by activated microglia, suggesting its deleterious and beneficial effects in neuronal cells. In this study, we demonstrated that TGF-β1 stimulated the production of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) in a time- and dose-dependent manner in a human monocytic THP-1 cell line. Notably, we found that Aβ1–42 consistently inhibited the TGF-β1-induced production of MMP-2, the endogenous gene containing Smad response elements, whereas the reverse peptide, Aβ42–1, evidenced little effect. Additionally, Aβ1–42 reduced TGF-β1-induced increase in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). This inhibitory effect of Aβ1–42 was also seen in human astroglial T98G cell line. Furthermore, Aβ1–42 significantly induced the expression of Smad7, which appears in turn to mediate the Aβ suppression of the TGF-β1-induced MMP-2 production. Indeed, Smad7 overexpression mimicked the inhibitory effect of Aβ1–42 on TGF-β1-induced MMP-2 production. Importantly, Aβ1–42 markedly suppressed the transactivation of the transfected reporter construct, p3TP-Lux, which contains TGF-β1-inducible Smad response elements. This was concomitant with a decreased MMP-2 production in TGF-β1-treated cells. Inhibition of cellular Smad7 levels via the small interference RNA method significantly ameliorated the Aβ1–42-mediated suppression of TGF-β1-inducible transcription reporter activity, thereby restoring MMP-2 induction, whereas Smad7 transfection down-regulated TGF-β1-inducible transcription reporter activity. Collectively, these data suggest that Aβ1–42 may play an important role in the negative regulation of TGF-β1-induced MMP-2 production via Smad7 expression.

The increased production of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, a 39–42 residue of the proteolytic product of amyloid precursor protein, and fibrillar Aβ deposition in dense senile plaques have been correlated with the progression of cognitive dysfunction in AD (1Selkoe D.J. Schenk D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 545-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Immunoreactivity to numerous inflammatory mediators has been detected in sections of AD brains including pro-inflammatory cytokines, acute phase proteins, and several proteins involved in the classical complement pathway (2Lanzrein A.S. Johnston C.M. Perry V.H. Jobst K.A. King E.M. Smith A.D. Alzheimer Dis. Assoc. Disord. 1998; 12: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 3Tenner A.J. Neurobiol. Aging. 2001; 22: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In AD brains, the co-localization of a broad variety of these inflammation-related proteins and clusters of reactive microglia and astrocytes with Aβ deposits is consistent with the notion that chronic inflammation plays a significant role in the progression to enhanced neurodegeneration (2Lanzrein A.S.

Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), a potent immunosuppressive cytokine found in neurite plaques, has been implicated recently as a cofactor for AD progression, largely due to its ability to promote perivascular inflammation and/or amyloid deposition (5Grammas P. Ovase R. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 1583-1587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 6Lesne S. Docagne F. Gabriel C. Liot G. Lahiri D.K. Buee L. Plawinski L. Delacourte A.

Postmortem brain tissue analyses of AD patients show increased TGF-β1 expression, which can be closely correlated with the degree of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) (7Wyss-Coray T. Masliah E. Mallory M. McConlogue L. Johnson-Wood K. Lin C. Mucke L. Nature. 1997; 389: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), a major pathological feature of AD and related disorders (8Cordoliani-Mackowiak M.A. Henon H. Pruvo J.P. Pasquier F. Leys D. Arch. Neurol. 2003; 60: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A genetic polymorphism of the TGF-β1 gene may be associated with a higher risk of developing AD (9Luedecking E.K. DeKosky S.T. Mehdi H. Ganguli M. Kamboh M.I. Hum. Genet. 2000; 106: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In contrast to its amyloidogenic effect, TGF-β1 may also exert a more complex role since TGF-β1 facilitates increased Aβ clearance from the brain parenchyma to the cerebral blood vasculature following the activation of parenchymal microglial cells and also induces plaque burden reduction in TGF-β1/human amyloid precursor protein bigenic mouse brains compared with human amyloid precursor protein mice (10Wyss-Coray T. Lin C. Yan F. Yu G.Q. Rohde M. McConlogue L. Masliah E. Mucke L. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 612-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The TGF-βs have also been shown to protect neuronal cell cultures from Aβ- and glutamate-induced neurotoxicity by up-regulating either antiapoptotic (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL) or calcium-stabilizing factors (calbindin) (11Ren R.F. Hawver D.B. Kim R.S. Flanders K.C. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 48: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12Flanders K.C. Ren R.F. Lippa C.F. Prog. Neurobiol. 1998; 54: 71-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Thus, in the Aβ function of neuronal cells, TGF-βs apparently exert both deleterious and beneficial effects via regional and/or cell type-specific TGF-β isoforms and receptor expression (7Wyss-Coray T.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 10366-10374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The TGF-β receptors are transmembrane serine/threonine kinases that propagate signals downstream (14Dennler S. Goumans M.J. ten Dijke P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 731-740PubMed Google Scholar, 15Shi Y. Massague J.

TGF-β binding induces the phosphorylation of the TGF-β type I receptor by the TGF-β type II receptor, the essential process in TGF-β signaling. Smads associate with these activated TGF-β receptors and play a crucial role in TGF-β signal transduction. Smad2 and Smad3 are direct substrates of the TGF-β receptor kinase, and they interact with a common partner, Smad4. Smad4-containing heterometric Smad complexes then translocate from the cytoplasm into the nucleus where they function as transcriptional regulators. Thus, the activation of gene transcription via Smad protein binding to Smad-binding elements (SBEs) represents terminal event in TGF-β signaling (17Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar, 18Jonk L.J. Itoh S. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Kruijer W. J. Biol.

In contrast to the receptor-activated Smads, inhibitory Smad7 binds stably to TGF-β receptors and interferes with the ligand-induced phosphorylation of both Smad2 and Smad3 (14Dennler S.

Importantly, Smad7 is considered to function as a negative regulator of the TGF-β/Smad signaling cascade and abnormal Smad7 expression is implicated in human disease (19Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A.

Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 361-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Increased levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been observed in the plasma and the proximity of extracellular amyloid plaques in the brain tissues from the AD patients (21Asahina M. Yoshiyama Y. Hattori T. Clin. Neuropathol. 2001; 20: 60-63PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lorenzl S. Albers D.S. Relkin N. Ngyuen T. Hilgenberg S.L. Chirichigno J. Cudkowicz M.E. Beal M.F. Neurochem. Int. 2003; 43: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Of important interest, pathogenic Aβ (Dutch variant Aβ), possibly associated with CAA, was shown to stimulate the expression and activation of MMP-2. Thus, these activities may contribute to the loss of vessel wall integrity in CAA, resulting in hemorrhagic stroke (23Jung S.S. Zhang W. Van Nostrand W.E. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 1208-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In contrast, earlier studies showed that MMPs are involved in Aβ degradation (24Backstrom J.R. Lim G.P. Cullen M.J. Tokes Z.A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7910-7919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Carson J.A. Turner A.J. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). These findings together suggest a critical role of MMPs in the pathophysiology of AD. Despite extensive studies on the dual effects of TGF-βs in amyloid plaque metabolism, the role of Aβ in the modulation of TGF-β function has remained enigmatic. Because dysregulation of TGF-β function is also implicated in chronic inflammation, leading to enhanced neurodegeneration, it is important to uncover any synergistic or antagonistic modulations of TGF-β-mediated effects elicited by Aβ to generate effective therapeutic strategies involving TGF-β and Aβ in AD pathology. Furthermore, few studies try to understand how TGF-β1 affects MMP production and how Aβ may modulate this process at the molecular level. In this regard, we sought to determine the regulatory effects of Aβ on the TGF-β-induced stimulation of MMP-2 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), endogenous genes containing SBEs (26Bian J.

We also assessed the effects of Aβ1–42 on the transcriptional activation of a transfected reporter gene containing TGF-β-inducible SBEs and also on Smad7 expression. We then attempted to ascertain in what way Smad7 expression was related to TGF-β-induced effect on MMP-2. To this end, we analyzed the effects of Smad7 overexpression on TGF-β1-mediated MMP-2 production and TGF-β1-induced transcription reporter activity and looked at decreases in cellular Smad7 levels via the siRNA method on the Aβ suppression of TGF-β1-inducible effects. Our data constitute evidence that TGF-β-mediated MMP-2 production primarily occurs through the activation of the Smad pathway. This study posits a novel role for Aβ as a negative regulator of TGF-β-mediated MMP-2 production via Smad7 expression. Materials—Human TGF-β1, TGF-β2, TGF-β3, and anti-human TGF-β1 antibody were purchased from R&D (Minneapolis, MN). A goat polyclonal antibody against Smad7 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-human MMP-2 antibody (Ab-3) was obtained from Calbiochem. Anti-β-actin antibody and other chemicals were obtained from the Sigma. Anti-human TNF-α antibody and anti-human PAI-1 antibody were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY) and American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT), respectively. LY294002, worthmanin, PD98059, SB202190, c-Jun-N-terminal kinase inhibitor (JNKI), cycloheximide, and actinomycin D were all obtained from Calbiochem. The Smad7 expression plasmid and the control pcDNA3 were kindly provided by Dr. C. H. Heldin (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden). The TGF-β-responsible p3TP-Lux promoter reporter plasmid and pRL-TK-Renilla were generous gifts from Dr. J. Massague (University of California, San Francisco, CA) and Dr. E. H. Jho (University of Seoul, Seoul, Korea), respectively. Aβ Peptide Preparation—Aβ1–42 and Aβ42–1 were purchased from U. S. Peptide (Fullerton, CA), and stock solutions were prepared as described previously with some modifications (28Perini G. Della-Bianca V. Politi V. Della Valle G. Dal-Pra I. Rossi F. Armato U. J. Exp.

Aβ peptides were dissolved at 5 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) to be diluted next at 250 μm in double-distilled water before experiments. This preparation contains predominantly monomer and dimers with larger oligomers up to 6-mers (data not shown). These small Aβ oligomers, similar to small SDS-stable Aβ oligomers (29Kayed R. Head E.

Aβ peptides, if used in the indicated concentrations in the presence of TGF-β1, did not significantly affect the viability of THP-1 cells when LDH release was measured. The effects of Me2SO alone in the used range of concentrations were not detectable. Cell Culture and Treatment for Preparation of Conditioned Media— THP-1 (a mononuclear cell line of human origin) and T98G (the human astroglial cell line) were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma). THP-1 has been widely used as a model of human monocytes/macrophages or microglia, not only because of its functional and morphological similarities including its capacity to perform signal transduction pathways but also because of functional differences in the metabolisms of rodent and human microglial cells, as was described previously (33Chong Y.H.

Confluent cells suspended in serum-free RPMI 1640 media supplemented with glucose (0.5%) were seeded into 96-well culture plates (∼1 × 105/well) and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C before experimental manipulation. The cells were then treated with TGF-β1 and/or Aβ peptides as indicated. To determine the effects of specific inhibition of TGF-β1-induced responses, cells were pretreated for 30 min with various chemical inhibitors at the concentrations specified followed by incubation with TGF-β1 and/or Aβ peptides. After incubation for the indicated periods, conditioned media were collected for subsequent analysis by gelatin zymography and cells were lysed for Western blot. To confirm TGF-β1-mediated MMP-2 production, TGF-β1 was preincubated with anti-TGF-β1-neutralizing antibody, anti-TNF-α-neutralizing antibody, or preimmune IgG for 30 min at room temperature at the indicated concentrations before the addition to the cell cultures. None of the drugs at the concentrations used affected cell viability. Analyses of Gelatinolytic Zymography—The gelatinolytic activities in the cell-free supernatants, normalized for equal amounts of protein, were determined by zymography with gelatin according to previously published methods (33Chong Y.H.

Clear bands on the zymograms were quantitated by densitometric scanning to determine the intensity of MMP-2 activity. The arbitrary densitometric units were expressed or converted to a fold measurement of the response of the vehicle-treated controls for each individual experiment. Smad7 Overexpression—THP-1 cells grown in 96-well plates were transiently transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and with 0.2 μg/well of either Smad7 expression plasmid or control pcDNA3 (19Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.E. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). After 24 h of transfection, cells were starved for2hin serum-free RPMI 1640 medium and then treated with TGF-β1 as indicated. Western blot analysis and zymography were performed to assess Smad7 expression and MMP-2 gelatinolytic activities as described below. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Assay—THP-1 cells grown in 96-well plates were transiently transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 and with 0.2 μg/well TGF-β-responsive luciferase reporter construct and plasmid p3TP-Lux containing TGF-β-inducible SBEs (34Wrana J.L.

Also, 0.01 μg/well pRL-TK-Renilla was co-transfected to normalize for variations in transfection efficiency between assays (36Jho E. Lomvardas S. Costantini F.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

After4hof transfection, the cells were treated with TGF-β1 and/or Aβ peptides in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium for 4 h at the indicated concentrations. In some experiments, to measure the effect of Smad7 depletion, cells were transfected with either synthetic siRNA for Smad7 or nonspecific control pool for 24 h, as described below, prior to transfection with p3TP-Lux. The effect of Smad7 overexpression was also analyzed by transfecting either Smad7 expression plasmid or control pcDNA3 for 24 h, as described above, prior to transfection with p3TP-Lux. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured in either duplicate or triplicate and normalized using a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) as described previously (37Lee Y.O. Shin Y.J. Chong Y.H. J. Neuroimmunol. 2004; 155: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity values were normalized with respect to protein concentrations, and the results are presented as fold increases. siRNA Studies—Synthetic siRNA for Smad7 and nonspecific control pool were purchased from Cellogenetics (Gaithersburg, MD), and transfection of the RNA oligonucleotide was performed using Lipofectamine 2000. THP-1 cells were treated with Lipofectamine 2000 (mock transfection), siRNA, or nonspecific RNA pool at the concentrations indicated. After 24 h of transfection, cells were starved for 2 h and then treated with TGF-β1 and/or Aβ peptides as indicated. Western blot analysis and zymography were performed to measure cellular Smad7 depletion and MMP-2 gelatinolytic activities as described above. Western Blot Analysis—Cytoplasmic fractions were prepared as described previously (38Chong Y.H. Shin Y.J. Suh Y.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 690-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and whole cell lysates were prepared by protein extraction, using a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS supplemented with protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors as described above. For Western blot analysis, equal amounts of protein (∼30 μg) were subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE. After electroblotting and blocking, blots were then probed at room temperature for 3 h with the primary antibody and incubated for 1 h with the specific secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Proteins were visualized using an ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). After the antibodies were stripped by incubating the membranes with stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) at 50 °C for 30 min, they were processed for re-labeling with β-actin monoclonal antibody (1:2000, Sigma). Statistical Analysis—All of the values were expressed as means ± S.E. Student's t tests were used for unpaired results to evaluate differences between groups. Differences in p values of <0.05 were considered to be significant. Induction of MMP-2 by TGF-β1—TGF-β1 is a pleiotropic inflammatory mediator with diverse immunomodulatory properties (39Letterio J.L. Roberts A.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 137-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 may affect monocyte chemotaxis and migration into tissues by enhancing the monocytic expression of MMPs. MMP-2 is released from the cells as inactive precursor (72 kDa of pro-MMP-2), which is activated by MT1-MMP (MMP-14) (40Stawowy P. Margeta C. Kallisch H. Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Fleck E. Graf K. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 63: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To assess the potential involvement of MMP-2 in the Aβ modulation of TGF-β1 function, we examined TGF-β1-induced MMP-2 production in monocytic THP-1 cells because MMP-2 contains TGF-β-inducible SBE domains in its promoter regions (17Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar, 26Bian J. Sun Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6330-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). MMP-2 activity was determined by gelatin zymography, and the specificity of MMP-2 protein was verified by Western blot analysis as a 68-kDa intermediateactive MMP-2 (Fig. 1, E), both of which were recently described (41Visse R. Nagase H. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 827-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (3673) Google Scholar). However, 62 kDa of full-active MMP-2 and inactive MMP-2 (72 kDa of pro-MMP-2) were not seen on the zymograms. The treatment of THP-1 cells with TGF-β1 at a concentration of 10 ng/ml induced MMP-2 expression in a time-dependent manner. MMP-2 levels began to increase at 12 h and reached peak 40 h after treatment (Fig. 1, A). This induction of MMP-2 by TGF-β1 in THP-1 also occurred in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, B). Maximal induction of MMP-2 was found to occur at a concentration of 20 ng/ml TGF-β1. Increases in TGF-β1 concentration beyond this level had no further effect on MMP-2 levels (data not shown). In contrast, TGF-β1 treatment had only a minimal effect on MMP-9 activity in THP-1 cells. Similar results were obtained using TGF-β2 and TGF-β3. These results confirm the presence of the three functional TGF-β receptors (Fig. 1, C). This TGF-β-mediated MMP-2 production was clearly specific, because only anti-TGF-β1-neutralizing antibody was able to reverse the process (Fig. 1, D). Moreover, MMP-2 induction was consistently inhibited when de novo mRNA expression and protein synthesis were inhibited by actinomycin and cycloheximide, respectively, which indicates that TGF-β-mediated MMP-2 induction is dependent on both transcriptional and translational activities. MMP-2 Induction by TGF-β1 Is Dependent on Intracellular Smad Signaling—To unravel the mechanism by which TGF-β1 induces MMP-2 expression in THP-1 cells, we investigated the results of blocking various signaling pathways of TGF-β1 on MMP-2 expression since TGF-β1 has been shown to activate several distinctive signaling pathways, such as Smad2, p38 MAPK, and Akt (also known as protein kinase B) (42Dai C. Yang J. Liu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12537-12545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 43Derynck R. Zhang Y.E. Nature. 2003; 425: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (4297) Google Scholar). However, LY294002 and worthmanin, inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, an activator of Akt, evidenced only minimal effects on TGF-β1-mediated MMP-2 induction (Fig. 2, A). Likewise, SB202190, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, and PD98059, known to selectively block the activity of MAPK kinase kinase (MEK1), an activator of ERKs, as well as an inhibitor of JNK MAPK (JNKI), also failed to abolish TGF-β1induced MMP-2 production. On the evidence presented in previous papers (33Chong Y.H. Sung J.H. Shin S.A. Chung J.H. Suh Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23511-23517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 37Lee Y.O. Shin Y.J. Chong Y.H. J.

To further delineate the potential involvement of Smad signaling in MMP-2 induction, we inhibited Smad signaling by overexpressing inhibitory Smad7. Because Smad7 competes with Smad-2 and Smad-3 to bind to the activated TGF-β type I receptor, an overexpression of Smad7 should result in the attenuation of Smad2/3 signaling (14Dennler S. Goumans M.J. ten Dijke P. J"
https://openalex.org/W1998788702,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is subject to considerable interest because of its role in adipocyte differentiation, metabolic control, and anti-inflammatory action. PPARγ research in brain cells is presently focused on glial PPARγ because of its potential as a pharmacological target in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases with an inflammatory component. In neurons PPARγ function is far from clear, and PPARγ agonist-dependent and -independent effects on cell survival or differentiation have been reported. We used PC12 cells, widely used to study neuronal signaling, such as nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced differentiation and survival or epidermal growth factor-dependent cell proliferation to dissect the possible involvement of PPARγ in these pathways. We show that NGF but not epidermal growth factor increases the transcriptional activity of PPARγ, and modulates the expression of this transcription factor. Because NGF signals through the tyrosine kinase (TrkA) NGF receptor and/or the p75NTR receptor, we used rescue experiments with a PC12 cell mutant lacking TrkA to show that NGF-induced PPARγ activation is dependent on TrkA activation. Our results point out PPARγ as a novel target of the TrkA-mediated neuronal cell survival and differentiating pathway and suggest a potential new inflammatory-independent therapeutic approach for pharmacological intervention in neurological disorders."

However, another defense mechanism that has received less attention is DNA repair. Because of the important homeostatic role of mitochondria and the exquisite sensitivity of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to oxidative damage, we hypothesized that mtDNA repair plays an important role in the protection against oxidative stress. To test this hypothesis mtDNA damage and repair was evaluated in normal HA1 Chinese hamster fibroblasts and oxidative stress-resistant variants isolated following chronic exposure to H2O2 or 95% O2. Reactive oxygen species were generated enzymatically using xanthine oxidase and hypoxanthine. When treated with xanthine oxidase reduced levels of initial mtDNA damage and enhanced mtDNA repair were observed in the cells from the oxidative stress-resistant variants, relative to the parental cell line. This enhanced mtDNA repair correlated with an increase in mitochondrial apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease activity in both H2O2- and O2-resistant HA1 variants. This is the first report showing enhanced mtDNA repair in the cellular response to chronic oxidative stress.

Oxidative stress occurs in cells when the equilibrium between prooxidant and species favors prooxidant stress. It is due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; XO, xanthine oxidase; AP, apurinic/apyrimidinic; APE, AP endonuclease; BER, base excision repair; 8-OxoG, 8-oxoguanine; Tg, thymine glycol; THF, tetrahydrofuran; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; XO, xanthine oxidase; AP, apurinic/apyrimidinic; APE, AP endonuclease; BER, base excision repair; 8-OxoG, 8-oxoguanine; Tg, thymine glycol; THF, tetrahydrofuran; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. generated by exogenous factors or by cellular metabolism. ROS can interact with multiple different macromolecules including lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins. As a result, cells have evolved numerous defense systems to counteract the deleterious effects of agents. A variety of cellular antioxidants have been identified that specifically eliminate ROS. These include superoxide dismutases, catalases, glutathione, α-tocopherol, vitamins A and C, and melanin. However, antioxidants are not able to fully protect DNA from oxidative stress, and various lesions in DNA such as base modifications, degradation products of deoxyribose, and strand breaks are known to occur. Therefore, the second line of defense against oxidative stress involves DNA repair.Within mammalian cells, there are two distinct genomes; one is located in the nucleus, and the other in located in mitochondria. Although damage and repair of nuclear DNA has been a subject of intense study for many years, more recently interest in mtDNA damage and repair has come to the forefront with the discovery that defects in the mitochondrial genome are associated with many pathologies and that there are a number of chemotherapeutic agents that work through the initiation of mtDNA damage (1Singh K.K.

Res. 1997; 9: 333-337PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it is well established that mitochondria play a variety of essential roles in cellular metabolism, including the production of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation, regulation of calcium homeostasis in cell signaling pathways, and initiation of apoptotic signal cascades (3Wallace D.C.

For these studies, we used cell lines isolated from HA1 Chinese hamster fibroblasts that became resistant to oxidative stress following chronic exposure to progressively increasing concentrations of H2O2 (OC14 cells) or to high concentrations of molecular oxygen (O2R95 cells) (8Spitz D.R.

These lines are cross-resistant to other oxidative stresses, including oxygen toxicity (10Spitz D.R. Adams D.T. Sherman C.M. Roberts R.J. Arch. Biochem.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3986-3992PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, H2O2- and O2-resistant variants of HA1 cells have an increased ability to metabolize toxic oxidants including hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxidation-derived aldehydes (8Spitz D.R.

Both resistant variants displayed reduced levels of initial mtDNA damage and a greater capacity to repair oxidative lesions in this DNA. To elucidate some of the mechanisms involved in this enhanced mtDNA repair in the resistant cell lines, we investigated the activities of several major DNA repair enzymes involved in mitochondrial base excision repair enzymes (BER) using abasic site (AP)-, 8-oxoguanine (8-OxoG)-, and thymine glycol (Tg)-containing oligonucleotides as substrates. The results showed that mitochondrial APE activity was significantly augmented in both the H2O2- and O2-resistant HA1 variants. No significant changes were found in removal of either 8-OxoG or Tg between oxidative stress-resistant variants and parental HA1 cells. As expected, both oxidative stress-resistant variants showed more efficient survival following treatment with XO compared with the parental HA1 line. These results, to our knowledge, are the first to document enhanced mtDNA repair in the cellular response of cells to chronic oxidative stress.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Chinese hamster fibroblasts designated HA1 and their stable H2O2-resistant (OC14) and O2-resistant (O2R95) variants were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 0.05 mg/ml gentamicin. Cultures were grown at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with a mixture of 5% CO2 and air. For the repair studies, ∼1.5 × 107 cells were plated per 150-mm dish. The cultures were used for experiments ∼3 days after plating.Drug Preparation and Exposure—HA1 cells and their resistant variants were exposed to different concentrations of XO (Grade III from buttermilk; Sigma) ranging from 5 to 600 milliunits/ml. A constant concentration of 0.5 mm hypoxanthine (Sigma) was used. Initially, hypoxanthine was dissolved in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), and different amounts of XO were subsequently added to the medium. The cells were rinsed with HBSS and then exposed to XO for 15 min in a 5% CO2, 37 °C incubated environment. Control cultures were exposed to HBSS under the same conditions. After 15 min, the cells were lysed for dose-response experiments or rinsed and placed in culture medium to allow time for repair.Mitochondrial DNA Damage and Repair Assay—Following drug exposure or after different times for repair, the cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.5% SDS, and 0.3 mg/ml proteinase K and incubated overnight at 37 °C. High molecular weight DNA was extracted, precipitated with 2.5 m ammonium acetate and 2 volumes of cold ethanol, resuspended in water, treated with DNase-free RNase (∼1 mg/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C, and precipitated again with cold ethanol. Purified DNA was digested overnight with KpnI (10 units/μg DNA), precipitated, resuspended in TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), and quantified using Hoechst 33258 dye and a Hoefer TKO 100 Mini-Fluorometer and TKO standards kit (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA). Samples containing 5 μg of DNA were heated at 70 °C for 15 min and then cooled at room temperature for 20 min. A sodium hydroxide solution then was added to a final concentration of 0.1 n, and samples were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. This alkali treatment produced single strand breaks at all abasic or sugar-modified sites in the DNA. Gel electrophoresis and vacuum transfer were carried out as described previously (12Rachek L.I. Grishko V.I. Musiyenko S.I. Kelly M.R. LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44932-44937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Following a prehybridization, the membranes were hybridized with a denatured PCR-generated mitochondrial probe (5Driggers W.J. LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22042-22045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), washed according to the manufacturer, placed under phosphorus imaging screens, and scanned for detection of hybridization bands. The resulting band images were scanned using a Bio-Rad GS-250 molecular imager. Break frequency was determined using the Poisson expression (s = –lnPo, where s is the number of breaks per fragment, and Po is the fraction of fragments free of breaks). The percentage of repair at time t was calculated by subtracting the breaks at time t from the breaks present at 0 h and dividing by the 0-h breaks. The resulting value then was converted to a percentage by multiplying by 100.Preparation of Mitochondrial Fractions—Mitochondrial protein fractions were isolated from one 150-mm dish of each cell type (HA1 cells and their resistant variants). The cells were harvested and treated with ice-cold digitonin (325 mm digitonin, 2.5 mm EDTA, 250 mm mannitol, and 17 mm MOPS, pH 7.4) for 80 s. The lysed cells were then added to mannitol-sucrose buffer to a final strength of 1× (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm Tris, pH 7.5). The suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 800 × g at 4 °C to pellet nuclei. The supernatant was centrifuged two more times for 10 min at 800 × g at 4 °C to remove nuclear debris. The mitochondrial fraction was pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. Isolated mitochondria were suspended in a buffer of 10 mm HEPES, pH 6.5, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 5 μl of protease inhibitors mixture/ml (Sigma). These suspensions were briefly sonicated on ice and centrifuged once more at 5,000 × g to pellet any remaining debris. Supernatant proteins from mitochondrial enriched fractions were used for APE activity assays. The purity of these fractions was routinely evaluated by Western blot analysis as has been documented in our previous publication (13Dobson A.W. Xu Y. Kelley M.R. LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37518-37523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). For the assays to detect 8-OxoG and Tg removal, mitochondria were suspended in a buffer of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, and 5 μl of protease inhibitors mixture/ml. The protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein dye microassay according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Bio-Rad).APE Activity Assays—A 21-mer oligonucleotide with a tetrahydrofuran residue (THF-AP) at the 10th position (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD) was end-labeled. The labeling reaction contained 20 pmol of single-stranded THF-AP oligonucleotide, 5 pmol of [33P]ATP, T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega, Madison, WI), and appropriate kinase buffer in a total volume of 20 μl (incubation for 45 min at 37 °C followed by 10 min at 68 °C). Complementary oligonucleotide (20 pmol) then was added at room temperature to form duplex DNA. Equal amounts of mitochondrial extracts (50–100 ng) were used in assays with the labeled duplex oligonucleotide. Activity assays contained 1 pmol of labeled duplex oligonucleotide, 2 μl of 10× REC buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 6.5, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2) and organelle extracts or 2.5 units of control APE enzyme (Trevigen) in a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction mixes were incubated for various times at 37 °C. Formamide/bromphenol (80%: 0.2%) dye was added to the mix to stop the reaction, and the reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 20% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gels. Wet gels were autoradiographed at –70 °C. Autoradiographs were scanned using a Bio-Rad GS-250 molecular imager, and the densitometry values were analyzed by using Molecular Analyst (Bio-Rad) software.Removal of 8-OxoG and Tg—8-OxoG- and Tg-containing DNA duplexes were prepared, and specific reaction assays were performed as described previously (12Rachek L.I.

Equal amounts of proteins (10–15 μg) from mitochondrial fractions isolated from resistant HA1 variants and the parental cell line were used. In the control reactions, 5 units of either pure formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase enzyme (Trevigen) or endonuclease III (Trevigen) was added instead of cell lysates. The reaction mixtures in a total volume of 20 μl were incubated for 3–20 h at 37 °C. Following polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the resultant images were analyzed by using Molecular Analyst (Bio-Rad) software.Cell Viability and Survival Experiments—For viability studies, HA1 cells and their resistant variants were plated into 24-well plates and exposed to the concentrations of xanthine oxidase that were used for subsequent repair studies (HA1, 50 milliunits; OC14, 600 milliunits; O2R95, 300 milliunits). Following a 15-min exposure to XO, the cells were rinsed with HBSS, and complete medium was replaced for 2 or 24 h. At the indicated time points, trypan blue was added to the wells, and viable cells were counted using light microscope. The percentage of viable cells was plotted as a function of time. For survival experiments, exponentially growing cultures with 2.5–2.8 × 106 cells/60-mm plate were rinsed once with HBSS, and 4 ml of fresh HBSS containing 0.5 mm hypoxanthine was added to each dish. The reaction was then initialized by the addition of the indicated amount of XO, and the treatment interval was 15 min. Control cultures were exposed to the drug diluent only. Following treatment, each cell culture was washed with sterile Pucks saline followed by removal using trypsin. The resulting single cell suspension was counted (Coulter counter), diluted, and plated for clonogenic cell survival. After 8–10 days of incubation at 37 °C, the colonies were fixed (70% ethanol), stained with Coomassie Blue, and counted using a dissecting microscope. The dilution replicates, which yielded 50–250 surviving colonies, were used for survival analysis. A colony had to contain 50 cells to be considered a survivor. Plating efficiencies were 60–90% for all untreated cell lines. Surviving fractions were normalized to the appropriate untreated control and plotted versus the dose of cytotoxic agent.Statistical Analysis—The data are presented as the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments. The data were compared using a standard t test, and statistical significance was determined at the 0.01 level.RESULTSCell Viability Studies—To ensure that the XO doses used for the repair experiments were not toxic to the analyzed cells, metabolic viability studies using the trypan blue excision method were performed. The cells were treated with different concentrations of XO, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and cell viability was determined immediately after treatment (0 h) and 2 and 24 h later. As can be seen in Table I, 80% or more of the cells in each cell line were viable after treatment with XO.Table ICell viability (the percentage viable) following XO treatment analyzed by trypan blue dye exclusionCell typeO h2 h24 h%%%HA1 (control)95.2 ± 3.895 ± 3.693.6 ± 5HA1- XO (50 milliunits)91.5 ± 582 ± 8.477 ± 5.9OC14 (control)95.6 ± 3.994 ± 1.896 ± 0.9OC14-XO (600 milliunits)93.3 ± 2.281.3 ± 2.784 ± 3O2R95 (control)98.2 ± 0.793.1 ± 2.294 ± 3.9O2R95-XO (300 milliunits)92 ± 3.390.1 ± 1.692.4 ± 2.4 Open table in a new tab Clonogenic Survival—Following XO exposure, the cells were trypsinized and replated at equivalent densities (1000 cells/plate). After 8–10 days, the colonies were fixed and stained with Coomassie Blue, and colonies containing 50 or more cells were counted using a dissecting microscope. Dilution replicates that yielded 50–250 surviving colonies were used for analysis. The data were normalized to the cloning efficiencies of untreated controls in the respective cell line, which was 0.775 for HA1 cells, 0.847 for OC14 cells, and 0.827 for O2R95 cells. Both ROS-resistant variants showed enhanced survival, even at increased concentrations of XO (Fig. 1).Analysis of mtDNA Damage in Response to ROS—Initial studies were designed to quantify the amount of mtDNA damage following exposure to various concentrations of XO. In initial experiments, doses of 150, 100, and 50 milliunits/ml were used for all three cell cultures (Fig. 2). After 15 min of exposure to XO and 0.5 mm hypoxanthine, the cells were lysed. DNA was extracted and digested to completion with KpnI. After heating, alkali treatment, and alkaline gel electrophoresis, a Southern blot procedure was performed, and data analyses were conducted as described above. Data obtained from these experiments show significant differences in the initial damage to mtDNA between parent cells and the resistant variants following exposure to the same dose of XO. mtDNA of resistant cells contained almost no damage, even at the highest dose of 150 milliunits/ml, whereas the parental cells showed break frequencies corresponding to three breaks/10-kb DNA fragment at the same dose. For the repair experiments, which require the same initial break frequency for all cell lines, the doses were increased for the resistant variants. Increased concentrations of XO were necessary to generate the same amount of mtDNA damage in the H2O2-resistant variant (12-fold, 600 milliunits/ml) and O2-resistant line (6-fold, 300 milliunits/ml) when compared with the parental HA1 cells (50 milliunits/ml) (Fig. 3).Fig. 2Significant differences are found in initial damage to mtDNA between parental cells and the resistant variants following exposure to the same doses of XO. Initially, 150-, 100-, and 50-milliunits/ml doses of XO were used to evaluate mtDNA damage in parental and variant cell cultures. After a 15-min exposure to XO at the indicated doses and 0.5 mm hypoxanthine, the cells were lysed. Control cells were incubated in drug diluent only. High molecular weight DNA was isolated and digested with KpnI, and Southern blot analysis with mtDNA specific probe was performed.

To optimize levels of damage for the repair experiments, XO doses were increased for the resistant variants. The HA1 parental cell line was exposed to 50, 25, and 5 milliunits/ml of XO and 0.5 mm hypoxanthine. OC14 cell were treated with 600, 300, and 150 milliunits/ml of XO, whereas O2R95 cells were exposed to 300, 150, and 50 milliunits/ml of XO.

After a 15-min exposure, the cells were lysed or rinsed and placed in culture medium. Control cultures were incubated in drug diluent only. 2- and 8-h repair times were selected. The data from these studies revealed that both the O2- and H2O2-resistant variants repair oxidative damage more rapidly then the parental HA1 line (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Resistant cells revealed a greater capacity for mtDNA repair.A, representative autoradiographs of quantitative Southern blots for each cell type are displayed.

Mitochondrial protein extracts were isolated from HA1 cells and their resistant variants. The extracts then were incubated with labeled THF-AP substrate. As a positive control, human APE (Trevigen) was used. As illustrated in Fig. 5 APE activity was significantly increased in both resistant variants compared with the parental cell line.Fig. 5Increased APE activity in ROS-resistant variants. Mitochondrial extracts were isolated from HA1 cells and their resistant variants as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Equal amounts of mitochondrial protein extracts were incubated with labeled THF-AP substrate for a various times.

The data in Fig. 6 show that there were no significant differences in the removal of either adduct between parental HA1 and oxidative stress-resistant variants.Fig. 6Specific activities for removal of 8-OxoG and Tg in parental and chronic oxidative stress-resistant cells are similar.A, 8-OxoG removal in HA1 cells and chronic oxidative stress-resistant cells.

First, it has been shown that cells resistant to oxidative stress have a reduced level of initial mtDNA damage. Second, mtDNA repair is involved in the cellular response to chronic oxidative stress. Third, increased mtDNA repair correlates with enhanced mitochondrial APE activity. In the present study we used HA1 hamster fibroblasts and their stable oxidative stress-resistant variants, which were derived following chronic exposure to H2O2 or 95% O2. In the first set of experiments, we investigated the formation of mtDNA damage in response to ROS generation. Our data reveal that OC14 and O2R95 cells are quite resistant to ROS generated by XO. This finding can partially be explained by the high levels of antioxidants induced following chronic oxidative stress (8Spitz D.R. Li G.C. McCormik M.L. Sun Y. Oberley L.W. Radiat. Res. 1988; 114: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 9Sullivan S.J. Oberley T.D. Roberts R.J. Spitz D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: L748-L756PubMed Google Scholar, 10Spitz D.R.

To overcome this resistance and induce the same level of mtDNA damage in all three types of cultures analyzed, increased doses of XO for the resistant variants were required (12-fold for OC14 cells and 6-fold for O2R95 cells). The results of these studies revealed that the removal of oxidative lesions was dramatically more efficient in the oxidative stress-resistant variants compared with the parental line. To our knowledge this is the first study to quantitatively evaluate the effects of exposure to c"

(2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 12213–12219) concluded that gangliosides serve as co-receptors for flagellin signaling via toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5). In view of several findings in this study that were inconsistent with a role for gangliosides as co-receptors, we re-examined this important issue. Using TLR5-negative RAW 264.7 cells and a TLR5-enhanced yellow fluorescent protein chimera, we established an assay for specific binding of flagellin to cells. Inhibition of clatherin-mediated internalization of flagellin·TLR5-enhanced yellow fluorescent protein complexes did not impair flagellin activation of IRAK-1. Thus flagellin signal occurs at the cell surface and not intracellularly. Exogenous addition of mixed gangliosides (GM1, GD1a, and GT1b) as well as GD1a itself inhibited flagellin-induced interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase activation as well as tumor necrosis factor α production in HeNC2, THP-1, and RAW 264.7 cells. Gangliosides inhibited flagellin signaling in the absence of an effect on flagellin binding to TLR5. Depletion of gangliosides in RAW 264.7 cells did not alter the concentration dependence or magnitude of flagellin signaling as measured by interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase activation or tumor necrosis factor α production. Our findings are consistent with the conclusions that gangliosides are not essential co-receptors for flagellin and that the inhibitory effect of gangliosides is mediated by at least one mechanism that is distinct from any effect on the binding of flagellin to TLR5.

This conclusion was based in part on two key observations. The first was the finding that gangliosides inhibited flagellin signaling in Caco-2 cells, presumably by competing with membrane-associated gangliosides that were part of a TLR5 receptor signaling complex. The second finding was that GD1a protected Salmonella enteritidis flagellin from proteolysis by trypsin, a finding that was consistent with a direct interaction between flagellin and the ganglioside. However, several findings in this study are inconsistent with a role for gangliosides as co-receptors. GD1a did not protect Pseudomonas aeruginosa flagellin from proteolysis by trypsin. If GD1a were a co-receptor for flagellin signaling via TLR5, then the ganglioside should interact with P. aeruginosa flagellin, a flagellin whose TLR5 signaling activity has been well documented (8López-Boado Y.S.

If gangliosides were crucial co-receptors for flagellin, then the absence of gangliosides in the membranes of cells should have dramatically reduced flagellin responsiveness. In view of these concerns, we re-examined the issue of gangliosides as co-receptors for flagellin. Cells and Reagents—The C3H/HeN-derived macrophage cell line HeNC2 and the human monocytic cell line THP-1 were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 (which is TLR5-negative (17Mizel S.B. Honko A.N. Moors M.A. Smith P.S. West A.P. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 6217-6223Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar)) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. To create a stable RAW 264.7 cell line expressing a TLR5-enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (TLR5-EYFP), the cells were transfected with linearized TLR5-EYFP (see below), rested 48 h, and then incubated in medium containing 200 μg/ml G418. Drug-resistant cells were cloned and evaluated for TLR5-EYFP expression and flagellin responsiveness. A single clone was selected and used in the experiments described in this report. Purified, endotoxin-depleted recombinant His-tagged S. enteritidis, P. aeruginosa (PAO1), and Escherichia coli (EPEC) flagellins were prepared as described previously (2McDermott P.F. Ciacci-Woolwine F. Snipes J.A. Mizel S.B. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5525-5529Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). None of these flagellins exhibit stimulatory activity on TLR5-negative RAW 264.7 cells, indicating that the level of potential contaminants such as lipopolysaccharide are well below the range necessary for bioactivity. The truncated inactive form of flagellin (amino acid residues 297–471) termed 229 (2McDermott P.F. Ciacci-Woolwine F. Snipes J.A. Mizel S.B. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5525-5529Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) was prepared in an identical manner. This protein does not bind to TLR5 (18Mizel S.B. West A.P. Hantgan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23624-23629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), nor does it possess any stimulatory activity in flagellin-responsive cells (2McDermott P.F. Ciacci-Woolwine F. Snipes J.A. Mizel S.B. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5525-5529Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-IRAK-1 antibody was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Polyclonal anti-flagellin antibody was prepared by immunizing rabbits with purified recombinant S. enteritidis flagellin. Monodansylcadaverine (MDC) was obtained from Sigma. The ganglioside mixture, containing GM1, GD1a, and GT1b, was purchased from EMD Biosciences. Purified GD1a and asialo-GM1 were purchases from Wako Chemical. Asialo GM1 was dissolved in CHCl3:EtOH and GD1a in Me2SO. The glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor, d,l-threo-l-phenyl-2-hexadecanoylamino-3-morpholinopropanol·HCl (PPMP), was purchased from Matreya Inc. (Pleasant Gap, PA) and was dissolved in ethanol and stored at -20 °C. Alexa fluor 488 cholera toxin subunit B conjugate was obtained from Molecular Probes. mTLR5-EYFP Plasmid—The mTLR5-EYFP chimera contains the complete coding sequence of murine TLR5 with the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) C-terminal to the TLR5. The mTLR5-EYFP fusion was prepared by amplifying a murine TLR5 cDNA via PCR using the forward primer 5′-aaaattatagagctcgccgccaccatggcatgtcaacttgacttg-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-atgcgtgcaggtaccccggaaatggttgctatggt-3′. The resultant product was then directionally cloned into the pEYFP-N1 vector (Clontech) at the SacI and KpnI sites. The final product was sequenced to ensure the fidelity of the PCR. Staining and Confocal Microscopy—To assess flagellin binding, RAW 264.7 cells (2 × 106) were transfected with 2 μg of mTLR5-EYFP plasmid using the Amaxa Biosystems Nucleoefector technology and then plated in chambered covered glass wells (Nalge Nunc). After resting for 24 h, the cells were incubated for 30 min in fresh medium in the absence or presence of 10-9m flagellin and then washed with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (TBS) several times to remove unbound flagellin. The samples were then stained with a 1:500 dilution of anti-flagellin antibody at 4 °C for 1 h. After primary staining, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 5 μg/ml Rhodamine Red-X goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Molecular Probes). Confocal images were collected on a Zeiss Axiovert 100-M microscope equipped with a LSM 510 scanning unit and a 1.2 WC 63× plan apochromat objective. The effect of PPMP on membrane ganglioside expression was evaluated by measuring the level of Alexa fluor 488 cholera toxin subunit B conjugate binding to RAW 264.7 cells incubated in the presence or absence of PPMP. RAW 264.7 cells (4 × 104) stably transfected with mTLR5-EYFP were incubated for 4 days in chambered cover glass wells with or without 5 × 10-6m PPMP. The cells were then washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were resuspended in 1 ml of TBS containing 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mg/ml glycine, 0.05% Tween 20, 10% goat serum (TBS-BGT), and 10 μg/ml Alexa fluor 488-conjugated cholera toxin B subunit and then incubated on a rocker for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were washed five times with TBS-BGT, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and then washed three times with TBS-BGT prior to examination by confocal microscopy. IRAK-1 Kinase Assay—IRAK-1 kinase activity in HeNC2 or RAW 264.7 cell lysates was measured as described previously (16Mizel S.B. Snipes J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22414-22420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 23Moors M.A. Li L. Mizel S.B. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4424-4429Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated in serum-free medium to prevent nonspecific absorption of gangliosides by serum proteins. The reaction products were subject to SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylated form of the substrate, myelin basic protein (MBP), was visualized by autoradiography. The band intensities were quantitated using a Kodak Image Station 2000 RT. Induction and Measurement of TNFα Production—HeNC2 and THP-1 cells (2 × 106 cells/ml) were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates in serum-free medium containing the indicated concentrations of flagellin and gangliosides. After 4 h, the culture supernatants were harvested, and TNFα production was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits from BD Pharmingen. To assess the effect of gangliosides on TNFα production in TLR5-EYFP-expressing RAW 264.7 cells, the cells (8 × 104 cells/well) were cultured overnight in 12-well plates in serum-free medium with or without flagellin and 10 μg/ml gangliosides. The culture medium from each well was then harvested and analyzed for TNFα content by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Flagellin Binds to Surface-associated TLR5 in RAW 264.7 Cells—As a first step in the evaluation of the action of gangliosides on flagellin signaling, we developed an assay for TLR5-dependent flagellin binding to cells. We took advantage of our earlier observation that although RAW 264.7 cells do not express TLR5, they become flagellin-responsive when transfected with a TLR5 expression plasmid (17Mizel S.B. Honko A.N. Moors M.A. Smith P.S. West A.P. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 6217-6223Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To mark TLR5-expressing cells, we used a chimeric cDNA encoding murine TLR5 and EYFP. In preliminary experiments, we established that the expressed TLR5-EYFP is fully capable of signaling in a flagellin-dependent manner. Therefore, RAW264.7 cells were transiently transfected with TLR5-EYFP, plated in chambered cover glass wells and rested for 24 h prior to incubation in the presence or absence of 10-9m flagellin or inactive 229 flagellin for 30 min at 37 °C. The cultures were then washed with ice-cold medium and stained with anti-flagellin antibody at 4 °C. After fixation and staining with a secondary rhodamine-labeled anti-rabbit IgG, confocal microscopy was employed to assess TLR5-EYFP expression and the degree to which flagellin bound to TLR5. In the absence of flagellin (Fig. 1A)orinthe presence of the inactive mutant 229 (Fig. 1B), there was no detectable rhodamine staining. However, when cells were incubated with flagellin, a pattern of staining was observed that was consistent with the binding of flagellin to surface TLR5 (Fig. 1C). The specificity of the staining is demonstrated by the presence of staining in only those cells that express TLR5-EYFP, i.e. cells lacking EYFP fluorescence did not bind flagellin. Furthermore, the level of flagellin staining was directly proportional to the level of TLR5-EYFP expression as evidenced by the observation that the rhodamine/EYFP ratio was constant for individual cells expressing TLR5-EYFP (∼0.4). Clathrin-dependent Endocytosis of Flagellin Is Not Required for IRAK-1 Activation in HeNC2 Cells—Although TLR5, like most other TLRs, is expressed on the cell surface (Fig. 1 and Refs. 4Gewirtz A.T.

Chem. 2003; 278: 23624-23629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and thus is able to bind flagellin (18Mizel S.B. West A.P. Hantgan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23624-23629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), it was not known whether the subsequent signaling by TLR5 occurs at the cell surface or is dependent on migration to an intracellular compartment. In this regard, recent studies have revealed that, depending on the cell type, lipopolysaccharide signaling via TLR4 may occur in different cellular compartments. Hornef et al. (28Hornef M.W. Normark B.H. Vandewalle A. Normark S. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1225-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide signaling via TLR4 occurs at the cell surface in RAW 264.7 cells and in the Golgi apparatus in intestinal epithelial cells. A similar conclusion was reached by Guillot et al. (29Guillot L. Medjane S. Le-Barillec K. Balloy V. Danel C. Chignard M. Si-Tahar M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2712-2718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In related studies, investigators obtained evidence supporting the notion that TLR9 (30Ahmad-Nejad P. Häcker H. Rutz M. Bauer S. Vabulas R.M. Wagner H. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1958-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 31Latz E. Schoenemeyer A. Visintin A. Fitzgerald K.A. Monks B.G. Knetter C.F. Lien E. Nilsen N.J. Espevik T. Golenbock D.T. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar) signaling also occurs in an intracellular compartment in macrophages and dendritic cells. Similar results have also been obtained with TLR2 (32Underhill D.M. Ozinsky A. Hajjar A.M. Stevens A. Wilson C. Bassetti M. Aderem A. Nature. 1999; 401: 811-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). In view of these observations and the possible involvement of membrane-associated gangliosides in flagellin signaling, we evaluated whether flagellin signaling via TLR5 occurs at the cell surface or in an intracellular compartment. RAW 264.7 cells were transiently transfected with TLR5-EYFP and then incubated with or without 100 μm MDC, an inhibitor of membrane transglutaminase that prevents endocytosis via the clathrin-dependent pathway (33Dickson R.B. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3454-3459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), for 30 min at 37 °C, and then incubated with 10-9m flagellin for an additional 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and stained with anti-flagellin antibody. The pattern of flagellin staining was evaluated using confocal microscopy. Representative sections are shown in Fig. 2A. Treatment with MDC decreased intracellular flagellin staining in RAW 264.7 cells as compared with the control sample. This effect was evident in each of the sections through the cells (data not shown). The accumulation of membrane-associated flagellin/TLR5 complexes in the MDC-treated sample most likely reflect enriched invaginations that are blocked from entering the endosomal pathway. Having established the effect of MDC on flagellin internalization in RAW 264.7 cells, we determined whether inhibition of flagellin endocytosis would abrogate TLR5 signaling. TLR5-EYFP-expressing RAW cells (107/sample) were cultured in the presence or absence of 100 μm MDC for 30 min at 37 °C and then stimulated in the presence or absence of 10-9m flagellin for 5 min at 37 °C. Detergent lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-IRAK-1 antibody, and the level of IRAK activity was measured using myelin basic protein as a substrate (16Mizel S.B. Snipes J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22414-22420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 23Moors M.A. Li L. Mizel S.B. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4424-4429Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Although MDC blocked the internalization of flagellin/TLR5 complexes (Fig. 2A), it did not affect the flagellin-dependent activation of IRAK-1 (Fig. 2B). Flagellin induced a 3.3-fold increase in IRAK-1 kinase activity in the absence of MDC and a 2.9-fold increase in the presence of MDC. This difference is well within the experimental error of this type of assay. Thus these results support the notion that internalization is not required for TLR5 signaling in macrophage-like cells. Gangliosides Inhibit Flagellin-induced TNFα Production in HeNC2, THP-1, and RAW 264.7 Cells—After establishing an assay for the cell surface binding of flagellin to TLR5 (Fig. 1) and that TLR5 signaling occurs at the cell surface, we focused our analysis on the question of gangliosides as co-receptors for TLR5. We began by determining the effect of gangliosides on the induction of TNFα production in HeNC2 and THP-1 cells. Each cell type was incubated with 10-9m flagellin in the presence or absence of 30 μg/ml mixed gangliosides for 4 h at 37 °C. Supernatants were analyzed for TNFα by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. As shown in Fig. 3, exogenous gangliosides inhibited TNFα production in HeNC2 cells (Fig. 3A) by ∼75% and completely abrogated TNFα production in THP-1 cells (Fig. 3B). These results are consistent with the observed inhibitory effect of gangliosides on flagellin-induced human β-defensin-2 promoter activity in Caco-2 cells (25Ogushi K. Wada A. Niidome T. Okuda T. Llanes R. Nakayama M. Nishi Y. Kurazono H. Smith K.D. Aderem A. Moss J. Hirayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12213-12219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The effect of the mixed gangliosides was concentration-dependent. Maximal inhibition was obtained with ∼10 μg/ml mixed gangliosides and was absent at concentrations less than ∼0.3 μg/ml (data not shown). In addition to HeNC2 and THP-1 cells, we also evaluated the effect of mixed gangliosides on TNFα production in RAW 264.7 cells stably transfected with TLR5-EYFP. These cells were equally sensitive to the inhibitory action of gangliosides (Fig. 3C). Gangliosides Inhibit Flagellin-induced IRAK-1 Activation— Having established the inhibitory effect of gangliosides on TNFα production in HeNC2 and THP-1 cells, we next determined whether gangliosides inhibit IRAK-1 activation in flagellin-responsive cells. HeNC2 cells (107) were incubated in the presence or absence of 10-9m flagellin with or without 10 μg/ml mixed gangliosides for 5 min at 37 °C and then prepared for analysis of IRAK-1 kinase activity. As shown in Fig. 4A, mixed gangliosides inhibited flagellin-induced IRAK-1 activity (by ∼75%). This level of inhibition is consistent with the 75% decrease in TNFα production (Fig. 3). It is important to note that gangliosides had no direct effect on IRAK-1 activity. Incubation of active IRAK-1 from flagellin-stimulated cells with 10 μg/ml mixed gangliosides did not result in any detectable decrease in kinase activity (data not shown). Ogushi et al. (25Ogushi K. Wada A. Niidome T. Okuda T. Llanes R. Nakayama M. Nishi Y. Kurazono H. Smith K.D. Aderem A. Moss J. Hirayama T. J. Biol.

Therefore, we examined the effect of"

Apoptosis is executed by caspases, which, based on their roles in apoptotic pathways, can be divided into two general groups. Initiator caspases (such as caspase-2, -8, -9, and -10) function mainly as integrators for upstream apoptotic signals. Once activated, the initiator caspases cleave and activate downstream effector caspases (such as caspase-3, -6, and -7), which are responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of many intracellular proteins, leading to the morphological and biochemical changes associated with apoptosis (1Salvesen G.S. Abrams J.M. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2774-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Two major signaling pathways have been described for activation of initiator caspases in mammalian cells. The intrinsic pathway mediates apoptotic responses to various stress signals such as DNA damage, hypoxia, and growth factor deprivation. It is generally thought that these signals eventually lead to the activation of proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family (e.g. Bax and Bak), resulting in mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and other proapoptotic proteins such as Smac/DIABLO (2Liu X.S.

The high local concentration of caspase-8 molecules allows them to activate each other through their low intrinsic protease activity (8Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar). Activated caspase-8 can process downstream effector caspases directly, leading to apoptosis. In certain cell types, however, death receptor-induced apoptosis requires amplification of death signals via a mitochondrial pathway controlled by Bcl-2 family proteins (9Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). Within this pathway, caspase-8 cleaves Bid, a member of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family of proteins. The resulting truncated Bid translocates from the cytoplasm to mitochondria, where it promotes the release of cytochrome c and other apoptotic proteins (10Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.-J. Yuan J.

Tumor suppressors often play a critical role in linking oncogenes to apoptotic machinery. For example, high level expression of many oncoproteins activates the tumor suppressor p53 (16Zindy F.

Activated p53 then targets both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways to promote apoptosis through transcription-dependent and -independent mechanisms (19Vousden K.

Alternatively, oncoproteins may directly activate the intrinsic pathway by up-regulating apoptotic proteins such as Bax and Apaf-1 (21Mitchell K.O. Ricci M.S. Miyashita T. Dicker D.T. Jin Z.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5865-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Also, overexpression of N-Myc has been shown to sensitize neuroblastoma cells to death receptor-induced apoptosis (25Lutz W. Fulda S. Jeremias I. Debatin K.-M. Schwab M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggest a pivotal role of death receptor-mediated apoptosis in protecting the cell from N-Myc-initiated tumorigenesis. In this study, we address the question of how elevated levels of N-Myc lead to activation of death receptor apoptotic pathways. Retroviral and Plasmid Constructs—The following retroviral and plasmid constructs were used to generate SHEP1-derived cell lines for this study: pBabe-hygro/N-Myc, pBabe-EGFP, pBabe-puro/FADD-DN, pBabe-puro/CrmA, pBabe-puro/Bcl-2, pBabe-puro/T7-Casp9(C287A), pBabe-puro/DR5, pRetro-Super/Bidsi1 and 2, pRetro-Super/p53si, pRetro-Super/DR5si1 and 2, pcDNA3.1/Smac, pcDNA3.1/Smac-AS, and pcDNA4/Xpress-XIAP. pRetro-Super/p53si has been described previously (45Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 243-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). To generate pRetro-Super/DR5si1 and 2, and pRetro-Super/Bidsi1 and 2, synthesized 64-bp oligonucleotides containing the human DR5 siRNA sequences (5′-GGTGATCCCACTGAGACTC-3′ and 5′-GCAGAAGATTGAGGACCAC-3′, positions 907–925 and 1158–1176 relative to the start codon, respectively) or the Bid siRNA sequences (5′-GAAGACATCATCCGGAATA-3′ and 5′-GGAGAAGACCATGCTGGTG-3′, positions 238–256 and 432–350 relative to the start codon, respectively) were cloned into the HindIII and BglII sites in the pRetro-Super vector, according to a procedure described previously (45Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 243-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). The human DR5 promoter luciferase reporter constructs pDR5/-1188, pDR5/-115, and pDR5/-38, as well as the promoter-less luciferase vector pGVB2, have been described previously (46Yoshida T. Maeda A. Tani N. Sakai T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The promoter region (-1188 to +1) contains seven noncanonical E-box elements, which were individually point mutated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene). The resulting point mutants of DR5 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs are as follows: pDR5/m972 (-972/-967, CAAATG to CAAGCT), pDR5/m930 (-930/-925, CATTTG to TTCCCG), pDR5/m537 (-537/-532, CAGGTG to GATATG), pDR5/m428 (-428/-432, CAAGTG to AGCTTG), pDR5/m294 (-294/-289, CACTTG to CAGTAC), pDR5/m221 (-221/-216, CAGTTG to GTACTG), and pDR5/m117 (CACGCG to CCCGGG). All of the sequences of the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Cell Lines—The human neuroblastoma cell line SHEP1 and various cell lines derived from SHEP1 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). All cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. Retrovirus-mediated gene transfer was performed as described previously (36Cui H. Schroering A. Ding H.F. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 1: 679-686PubMed Google Scholar, 47Ory D. Neugeboren B. Mulligan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11400-11406Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). 24 h after the final round of retroviral infection, cells were cultured in the growth medium containing either 1.0 μg/ml puromycin or 100 μg/ml hygromycin B for 3 days, and drug-resistant cells were pooled. The percentage of retrovirus-infected cells ranged between 80 and 90%, as estimated in parallel infections using the retrovirus-expressing EGFP. Overexpression or down-regulation of relevant proteins was verified by immunoblotting. For transient transfection of plasmid constructs, 3 × 105 cells were transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine Plus reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). 48 h after transfection, the cells were selected in growth medium containing 800 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Invitrogen) for 6 days. G418-resistant cell clones with overexpression or down-regulation of relevant proteins were pooled and used in apoptosis studies. Apoptosis Induction and Analysis—Exponentially growing cells at 70–80% confluence were either untreated or treated with the indicated concentrations of TRAIL (Calbiochem), 500 ng/ml of an agonistic anti-Fas antibody (clone CH-11, Upstate), 1 ng/ml human TNF-α (Calbiochem) plus 2.5 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma), or 0.5 μg/ml doxorubicin (Ben Venue Laboratories). 24 h after treatment, adherent and floating cells were pooled, collected by centrifugation, and washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Apoptotic cell death was determined by staining of the collected cells with annexin-V and 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD), using a Guava cytometer according to the manufacturer's protocol (Guava). Immunoblotting and Immunofluorescent Staining—SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed according to standard procedures. The following primary antibodies were used: monoclonal antibodies against caspase-8 (clone 5F7; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), caspase-9 (clone 96-2-22; Upstate), FADD (clone 1F7; Upstate), N-Myc (Ab-1, Oncogene Research Products), TRADD (3E11, Upstate), the T7 tag (Novagen), α-tubulin (clone B-5-1-2; Sigma), XIAP (clone 28, BD Biosciences), and the Xpress tag (Invitrogen); rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Bak (Santa Cruz), Bax (B3428; Sigma), Bcl-2 (Δ21, Santa Cruz), DR4 (Alexis), DR5 (Alexis), and p53 (FL-393, Santa Cruz); goat polyclonal antibodies against Bid (C-20; Santa Cruz) and Smac/DIABLO (R&D Systems). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, goat anti-mouse, or rabbit anti-goat antibodies (ICN) were used as secondary antibodies. The protein levels of DR5, Bid, and p53 in SHEP1/N-Myc cells relative to those found in SHEP1/GFP cells were quantified using Kodak Image Station 440CF. For immunofluorescent staining, cells were grown on coverslips and treated with 100 ng/ml TRAIL. After 8 h, cells were washed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. The cells were blocked with 5% milk in PBS for 1 h, incubated with a primary antibody in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature, washed in PBS, and then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody. Primary antibodies were used at 1:400 for a rat monoclonal antibody against Smac/DIABLO (clone 10G7, Calbiochem) and 1:800 for a mouse monoclonal antibody against cytochrome c (clone 6H2.B4, Pharmingen). Texas Red-X goat anti-mouse IgG (1:600) and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rat IgG (H+L) (1:600, Molecular Probes) were used as secondary antibodies. 300 nm DAPI in PBS was used for nuclear staining. Cells were visualized using a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope with Image-Pro Plus software for image analysis. Transient Expression and Luciferase Assays—SHEP1 and SHEP1/N-Myc cells in 6-well dishes were transfected with 1.0 μg of each luciferase reporter DNA construct and 0.5 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase plasmid (Promega) using the Lipofectamine Plus kit. Cells were lysed 24 h after transfection, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were assayed using the luciferase and β-galactosidase assay systems according to the manufacturer's procedure (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity to account for differences in the transfection efficiency. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was prepared from SHEP1/GFP and SHEP1/N-Myc cell lines using TRI Reagent (Molecular Research Center) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA samples (20 μg/lane) were resolved on 1% formaldehyde agarose gels and transferred to an Immmobilon-NY membrane (Millipore). UV cross-linking was performed with Stratalinker 2400 (Strategene). Blots were hybridized to a 32P-labeled probe specific for human DR5 (5 × 106 cpm/ml). N-Myc Sensitizes SHEP1 Cells to Death Receptor-mediated Apoptosis—The human neuroblastoma cell line SHEP1 is an epitheloid subclone of the neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH (48Biedler J. Helson L. Spengler B. Cancer Res. 1973; 33: 2643-2652PubMed Google Scholar) that contains no MYCN amplification (49Schwab M. Alitalo K. Klempnauer K.H. Varmus H.E. Bishop J.M. Gilbert F. Brodeur G. Goldstein M. Trent J. Nature. 1983; 305: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). SHEP1 cells have functional death receptor pathways and express very low levels of endogenous N-Myc which are generally undetectable by immunoblotting (Fig. 1A), thus providing a suitable system for examining the effect of elevated levels of N-Myc on death receptor-triggered apoptosis. The human N-Myc oncogene was introduced into SHEP1 cells by retroviral-mediated gene transfer. After 3-day selection in the presence of hygromycin, infected cells were pooled, which expressed N-Myc at the level compatible to that found in IMR32 cells (Fig. 1A), a neuroblastoma cell line with MYCN amplification (49Schwab M. Alitalo K. Klempnauer K.H. Varmus H.E. Bishop J.M. Gilbert F. Brodeur G. Goldstein M. Trent J. Nature. 1983; 305: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). The control, GFP-expressing SHEP1 (SHEP1/GFP) cells were relatively resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1B). N-Myc expression markedly sensitized SHEP1 cells to TRAIL, and most of the cells exhibited morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis such as cell shrinkage within 24 h of treatment with 100 ng/ml TRAIL (Fig. 1B). The apoptotic cell death was confirmed further by an annexin-V binding assay in which annexin-V binds to externalized phosphatidylserine on the surface of apoptotic cells (Fig. 1C). In addition, SHEP1 cells expressing N-Myc (SHEP1/N-Myc) showed a marked increase in their sensitivity to an agonistic anti-Fas antibody (clone CH-11) and to TNF-α (Fig. 1D). These results confirmed the previous finding that N-Myc is a potent proapoptotic regulator of death receptor-triggered apoptosis (25Lutz W. Fulda S. Jeremias I. Debatin K.-M. Schwab M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). TRAIL Induces Apoptosis in SHEP1/N-Myc Cells through the Caspase-8-Bid-Mitochondria Pathway—We next wished to define the signaling pathway through which N-Myc sensitizes SHEP1 cells to death receptor-induced apoptosis, using the TRAIL system as a model. As expected, both FADD and caspase-8 are required for TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Expression of a FADD dominant-negative mutant (FADD-DN) (50Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F. O'Rourke K.

J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7797-7800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), completely abrogated N-Myc-induced sensitization of SHEP1 cells to TRAIL (Fig. 2, A and B). By contrast, expression of CrmA had no effect on the sensitivity of SHEP1/N-Myc cells to the DNA-damaging drug doxorubicin (Fig. 2B), indicating separate pathways in mediating TRAIL- and DNA damage-induced apoptosis in SHEP1/N-Myc cells. Consistent with their TRAIL-sensitive phenotype, SHEP1/N-Myc cells showed higher levels of caspase-8 activation after TRAIL treatment compared with SHEP1/GFP cells (Fig. 2C). Concurrent with the caspase-8 activation, a decrease in the levels of full-length Bid and an increase in the levels of truncated Bid (tBid) were observed (Fig. 2C). The observed Bid cleavage suggests a possible role of mitochondria in mediating TRAIL-induced apoptosis in SHEP1/N-Myc cells. To test this hypothesis, we examined the location of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO in SHEP1/N-Myc cells before and after TRAIL treatment. In untreated cells, immunofluorescent staining revealed a characteristic punctate mitochondrial pattern for both cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO (Fig. 2D). After TRAIL stimulation, the punctate staining of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO became diffused in SHEP1/N-Myc cells (Fig. 2D), indicating the release of these factors from mitochondria. Overexpression of Bcl-2 in SHEP1/N-Myc cells prevented the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO (Fig. 2D) and protected the cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2E). Together, these results suggest that the mitochondrial release of apoptotic factors is an essential step in TRAIL-induced apoptosis in SHEP1/N-Myc cells. To define further the role of Bid in TRAIL-induced apoptosis in SHEP1/N-Myc cells, we generated two Bid siRNA-expressing retroviral constructs that target different regions of the Bid-coding sequence. Retroviruses produced from both constructs were able to knock down the levels of Bid in SHEP1/N-Myc cells (Fig. 2F, inset) and to decrease their sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2F), indicating that Bid plays an essential role in this apoptotic process. Smac/DIABLO, but Not Cytochrome c-mediated Caspase-9 Activation, Is Required for TRAIL-induced Apoptosis in SHEP1/N-Myc Cells—Release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm promotes Apaf-1-mediated caspase-9 activation (6Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). Indeed, caspase-9 became activated in SHEP1/N-Myc cells after TRAIL treatment, as indicated by the appearance of its processed forms, p35/37 (Fig. 3A). To investigate the role of caspase-9 in TRAIL-induced apoptosis in SHEP1/N-Myc cells, we generated a SHEP1 cell line that expresses both N-Myc and a well characterized caspase-9 dominant-negative mutant (casp9 DN) (52Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B, inset). The control cells expressing GFP and N-Myc were sensitive to apoptosis induced either by the DNA-damaging drug doxorubicin or by TRAIL (Fig. 3B). Expression of casp9 DN completely protected SHEP1/N-Myc cells from doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, demonstrating that casp9 DN is functional in these cells. However, casp9 DN failed to protect the cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3B). Thus, TRAIL induces apoptosis in SHEP1/N-Myc cells through a caspase-9-independent pathway downstream from mitochondria. Because Smac/DIABLO was also released from mitochondria in SHEP1/N-Myc cells treated with TRAIL (Fig. 2D), we examined its role in TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of Smac/DIABLO increased the sensitivity of SHEP1 cells to TRAIL (Fig. 3C). We next assessed the effect of down-regulation of endogenous Smac/DIABLO on TRAIL-induced apoptosis. SHEP1/N-Myc cells were transfected with either pcDNA3.1 or a pcDNA3.1-based plasmid that expresses Smac/DIABLO in an antisense orientation, and G418-resistant clones with significant down-regulation of Smac/DIABLO were pooled. SHEP1/N-Myc cells stably transfected with the control plasmid pcDNA3.1 remained sensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3D). By contrast, the antisense-mediated down-regulation of endogenous Smac/DIABLO significantly decreased the sensitivity of SHEP1/N-Myc cells to TRAIL (Fig. 3D), indicating a critical role of Smac/DIABLO in mediating TRAIL-induced apoptosis in these cells. Smac/DIABLO Targets XIAP for Degradation in SHEP1/N-Myc Cells in Response to TRAIL—A major target of Smac/DIABLO is X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), an inhibitor of caspase-9, -3, and -7 (53Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar). To define the mechanism of Smac/DIABLO action, we investigated the role of XIAP in TRAIL-induced apoptosis in SHEP1/N-Myc cells. Overexpression of XIAP effectively protected SHEP1/N-Myc cells from apoptosis induced by TRAIL (Fig. 4A). Immunoblot analysis revealed that after treatment with TRAIL, the endogenous XIAP levels were decreased markedly in SHEP1/N-Myc cells (Fig. 4B, lanes 4–6 and 13–15). A decrease in XIAP levels was also observed in TRAIL-treated SHEP1 cells expressing both N-Myc and casp9 DN (Fig. 4B, lanes 1–3), which remained sensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3B). By contrast, TRAIL failed to induce XIAP degradation in resistant SHEP1/N-Myc cells expressing FADD-DN (Fig. 4B, lanes 10–12), CrmA (lanes 16–18), or Bcl-2 (lanes 7–9). Moreover, down-regulation of endogenous Smac/DIABLO in SHEP1/N-Myc cells blocked TRAIL-induced XIAP degradation (Fig. 4B, lanes 19–21). Together, these observations suggest that Smac/DIABLO promotes XIAP degradation to mediate TRAIL-induced apoptosis in SHEP1/N-Myc cells. N-Myc Sensitizes SHEP1 Cells to TRAIL by Up-regulating Apoptotic Proteins in the TRAIL Signaling Pathway—Dissection of the TRAIL apoptotic pathway in SHEP1/N-Myc cells allows us to investigate the mechanism by which N-Myc sensitizes cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.

In this context we report here the first and complete residue level investigations on the structural and folding characteristics of the 17-kDa precursor TFR-PR-Cnn (161 residues) of HIV-1 protease. The precursor shows autoprocessing activity indicating that the solution has a certain population of the folded active dimer. Removal of the 5-residue extension, Cnn at the C-terminal of PR enhanced the activity to some extent. However, NMR structural characterization of the precursor containing a mutation, D25N in the PR at pH 5.2 and 32 °C under different conditions of partial and complete denaturation by urea, indicate that the precursor has a high tendency to be unfolded. The major population in the ensemble displays some weak folding propensities in both the TFR and the PR regions, and many of these in the PR region are the non-native type. As both D25N mutant and wild-type PR are known to fold efficiently to the same native dimeric form, we infer that TFR cleavage enables removal of the non-native type of preferences in the PR domain to cause constructive folding of the protein. These results indicate that intrinsic structural and folding preferences in the precursor would have important regulatory roles in the autoprocessing reaction and generation of the mature enzyme.

In HIV, HIV-1 protease (PR) plays a crucial role in virus maturation by processing these precursors into functional proteins (4Kohl N.E. Emini E.A. Schleif W.A. Davis L.J. Heimbach J.C. Dixon R.A.F.

As the HIV-1 protease, which is flanked by the highly variable p6pol at its N terminus and by the reverse transcriptase (RT) at its C terminus (10Oroszlan S. Luftig R.B. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

Earlier studies have shown that premature activation or partial inhibition of the protease leads to retarded viral maturation (15Kaplan A.H. Zack J.A. Knigge M. Paul D.A. Kempf D.J. Norbeck D.W.

Hence understanding the exact sequence of protease maturation from the Gag-Pol precursor has gained importance in recent years because of its intrinsic importance in viral maturation and as a target for drugs against AIDS (19Wondrak E.M. Nashed N.T. Haber M.T. Jerina D.M. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4477-4481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Pettit et al. (20Pettit S.C. Everitt L.E. Choudhury S. Dunn B.M. Kaplan A.H. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 8477-8485Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) have recently shown, by co-expressing equivalent amounts of substituted Gag-Pol constructs, that the initial cleavage of the HIV-1 Gag-Pol precursor is intramolecular. Moreover, they showed that competitive active site inhibition by the drug retonavir was 10,000-fold less for the protease embedded in the precursor than for the mature free protease (20Pettit S.C. Everitt L.E. Choudhury S. Dunn B.M. Kaplan A.H. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 8477-8485Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Earlier, kinetic studies on the model precursor system MBP-ΔTF-Protease-ΔRT showed that the protease maturation takes place in two steps. (ΔTF and ΔRT are short native sequences from the transframe protein and the reverse transcriptase, respectively. MBP stands for maltose-binding protein of Escherichia coli containing two native cleavage sites, p6pol/PR at the N terminus and PR/RT at the C terminus.) The first step involves an intramolecular cleavage of the N terminus that is followed by intermolecular cleavage of the C terminus (19Wondrak E.M. Nashed N.T. Haber M.T. Jerina D.M. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4477-4481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 21Louis J.M. Nashed N.T. Parris K.D. Kimmel A.R. Jerina D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7970-7974Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A relatively low Km for peptide substrates representing the p6*-PR (where p6* is TFP+p6pol) cleavage site, compared with that for oligopeptides corresponding to other Gag or Pol cleavage sites (23Dunn B.M. Gustchina A. Wlodawer A. Kay J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 241: 254-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) supports the view that the N-terminal cleavage is an early event in the proteolytic cascade. The activity of the protease-ΔRT was found to be nearly equal to that of the mature PR, though its conformational stability was much less than that of PR (19Wondrak E.M. Nashed N.T. Haber M.T. Jerina D.M. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4477-4481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However a 600-fold decrease in catalytic activity was seen in MBP-ΔTF-protease-ΔRT compared with mature PR (19Wondrak E.M. Nashed N.T. Haber M.T. Jerina D.M. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4477-4481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 21Louis J.M. Nashed N.T. Parris K.D. Kimmel A.R. Jerina D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7970-7974Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus the flanking N terminus of the protease seems to have important consequences with maturation. The N-terminal transframe region (TFR) consisting of a conserved N-terminal transframe octapeptide (TFP) and a 48–60 amino acid long variable p6pol, with a protease cleavage site at the intersection, does not have any stable secondary or tertiary structure in free solution (24Beissinger M. Paulus C. Bayer P. Wolf H. Rosch P. Wagner R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), though some tendency for helix formation has been seen. However, when present with the PR, TFR does seem to act as a regulator for the autoprocessing of the protease (11Candotti D. Chappey C. Rosenheim M. M'Pele P. Huraux J.M. Agut H. C. R. Acad. Sci.

Interaction of recombinant p6* protein with HIV-1 PR was found to specifically inhibit its activity, and the inhibition was dependent on the C-terminal cleavage site residues SFNF in the p6*. In separate experiments with the precursor, these residues blocked the substrate binding cleft in HIV1-PR after N-terminal autoprocessing of the precursor. At the same time it was also observed that the p6* stabilized the dimer, as the relative amount of dimer increased by 12% in its presence (25Louis J.M. Dyda F. Nashed N.T. Kimmel A.R. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2105-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Functional characterization of the model precursor ΔTFP-p6pol-PR (ΔTFP is a 5-residue variant of TFP) by examination of the mechanism and the pH rate profile of the autocatalytic reaction to produce mature PR shows that full-length TFR with its native cleavage sites is critical for the regulated autoprocessing of Gag-Pol and for optimal catalytic activity (28Louis J.M.

(27Dautin N. Karimova G. Ladant D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8216-8226Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) on functional modulations due to N- and C-terminal extensions to PR, using an E. coli genetic assay for proteolytic activity and a bacterial two-hybrid system, shows that the TFR can restore enzymatic activity to a dimerization-deficient HIV protease variant. Experiments with various deletion and addition mutants of PR and its precursors, Gag-Pol, TFR-PR, also give insights into folding and dimerization of PR (29Louis M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Stuct. Biol. 1999; 6: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). For example, deletion of the first four residues in PR led to >90% unfolded ΔPR. Similar destabilization was observed for PR with additional residues in the N terminus (29Louis M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Stuct. Biol. 1999; 6: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Earlier, it has also been shown that removal of the p6pol domain from the Gag-Pol polyprotein leads to a significantly higher rate of processing of the Gag-ΔPol precursor (31Partin K. Zybarth G. Ehrlich L. DeCrombrugghe M. Wimmer E. Carter C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4776-4780Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The studies discussed so far are mainly based on enzymatic activity assays for the HIV-1 PR and its precursors using the chromogenic peptide substrate Lys-Ala-Arg-Val-Nle-Phe(p-NO2)-Glu-Ala-Nle-NH2 (19Wondrak E.M.

These give very good quantitative as well as qualitative information with regard to the working of the various precursors of HIV-1 protease. However, there are very few reports about the residue level structural characteristics of these precursors, which is crucial to understanding the molecular mechanism of protease maturation (29Louis M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Stuct. Biol. 1999; 6: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 33Ishima R. Torchia D.A. Shannon M.L. Angela M.G. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43311-43319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Louis et al. (29Louis M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Stuct. Biol. 1999; 6: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) have earlier shown, through NMR, how the N-terminal TFR extension to the HIV-1 PR does not allow it to fold even in the presence of DMP323, which is one of the tightest binding inhibitors. Detailed NMR structural characterization of wildtype TFP-p6pol-PR was not possible because of its autolytic property. Hence, in a later study, an active site D25N mutation was introduced, and the HSQC spectra were seen to have many peaks at the same chemical shifts as in the spectra of the folded PRD25N, though, they also had many intense peaks in a narrow region of amide proton chemical shifts (8.0–8.5 ppm), presumably belonging to the TFR residues. This indicated that the PR region folded properly, although the TFR region could not be characterized because of insufficient dispersion of the peaks (33Ishima R. Torchia D.A. Shannon M.L. Angela M.G. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43311-43319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It was suggested that the TFR region was largely unstructured. Thus, all the above studies demonstrate the importance of TFR on the folding and maturation of the protease. However, the mechanistic details at the residue level are still not understood. In this context we present here investigations on a precursor TFP-p6pol-PR-Cnn, where Cnn is a non-native pentapeptide extension at the C terminus of PR. Bacterial expression and MALDI analysis of the precursor show that TFR does not hamper the autoprocessing of the precursor so as to release the PR. Deletion of Cnn enhanced autoprocessing, indicating that the non-native C-terminal extension interferes in the cleavage mechanism. We carried out extensive NMR investigations on the precursor containing an active site mutation D25N, which was stable for several weeks for NMR experiments. We monitored the intrinsic folding propensities of the precursor by studying the graded changes in the dynamic as well as structural characteristics of the equilibrium intermediates, created by use of different concentrations of the chemical denaturant, urea. These results have significant implications for the regulation mechanism of the autoprocessing reaction of HIV-1 protease precursors. Protein Preparation—Starting with the clone for the TFR-PR-tethered dimer (TFR-PR-Cnn-PR), kindly supplied by Dr. M. V. Hosur of Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai, we introduced an active site mutation, D25N, in PR, using a standard PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis strategy; this mutation does not affect PR folding but prevents its autocleavage. From this the TFR-PR-Cnn region was selected and introduced into the NdeI/BamH1 multiple cloning site of a pET11a plasmid. The inclusion of the Cnn, besides providing a non-native flanking C terminus, has a practical advantage. It has the sequence GGSSG, and the glycines have a special significance in the NMR assignment strategy. At the same time, Cnn is known not to affect the folding characteristics of PR in the tethered dimer, which folds similarly to the native homodimer (34Pillai B. Kannan K.K. Hosur M.V. PROTEINS, Struct. Funct. Genet. 2001; 43: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Similarly, the TFR-PR construct was also prepared. The desired wild-type constructs were prepared by PCR amplification of TFR-PR and TFR-PR-Cnn regions from the full clone (TFR-PR-Cnn-PR) and introducing them into a pET11a plasmid as described above. The constructs were sequenced to verify that there were no inadvertent PCR-induced errors. The plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) for protein overexpression. Transformed bacteria were grown at 37 °C in M9 medium to OD600 of ∼0.8, and then induced for production of the desired proteins using 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Uniformly 15N- and 15N/13C-labeled protein samples were prepared by growing bacteria in M9 minimal media supplemented with 1 g liter-1 15NH Cl and 4 g liter-1 [13C]glucose. Protein was purified as described previously (35Panchal S.C. Pillai B. Hosur M.V. Hosur R.V. Curr. Sci. 2000; 79: 1684-1695Google Scholar). MALDI analysis of the protein showed peaks at the expected molecular mass (17.3 kDa). The NMR samples contained 1 mm protein in 50 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.2) containing 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm dithiothreitol, and different concentrations of urea in 90% H2O, 10% D2O. Gel Electrophoresis—The recombinant protein was induced in BL21(DE3) E. coli bacterial cells as described in the section on protein preparation. Aliquots were taken at two different induction times, 3 and 5 h, and analyzed on 12% SDS-PAGE. Capillary Electrophoresis—The purified protein was concentrated to ∼1 mm and analyzed by neutral capillary electrophoresis on a Beckmann-Coulter capillary electrophoresis system in the presence and absence of the denaturants, urea and guanidine hydrochloride. Mass Spectroscopy—MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analyses were carried out with Micromass (UK) MALDI-TOF Spec 2E spectrometer equipped with a UV nitrogen laser (337 nm) and a dual microchannel microplate detector. The samples were prepared by mixing 1 μl of protein solution (∼20 μm) with 1 μl of freshly prepared matrix solution (10 mg/ml of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 3:2 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile). A total of 1 μl of this mixture was placed on the stainless steel probe plate and allowed to dry at room temperature. The spectra were recorded in the positive reflector linear mode at an accelerated voltage of 20 kV in the range from 4000 to 30,000 Da. For each measurement, the spectra were externally calibrated using myoglobin and trypsinogen. NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR experiments were performed at 32 °C on a Varian Unity-plus 600 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with pulse-shaping and pulse-field gradient capabilities. For the HNN spectrum the delays TN, and TC, were both set to 28 ms. 40 complex points were used along the t1 and t2 dimensions. The HN(C)N spectrum was recorded with the same TN and TC parameters, the same number of t1 and t2 points, and the TCC delay was set to 9 ms. TOCSY-HSQC was recorded with a mixing time of 60 ms, 32 complex points along the 15N (t1) dimension and 64 complex points along the 1H (t2) dimension. CBCANH and CBCA(CO)NH were recorded with 40 complex t1 points (15N) and 64 complex t2 points (13C). HNCO was recorded with 40 complex points along t1 and t2. An HSQC was recorded with 256 t1 increments. For the high resolution HSQC data, required for coupling constant measurements, 8192 and 512 complex points were acquired along the t2 and t1 dimensions, respectively. For the relaxation measurements 2048 and 256 complex points were collected along the two dimensions. For R2 measurements, the following Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) delays were used: 10, 30, 50, 90, 130, 150, 190, 230 ms and spectra duplicated at 50 and 150 ms. The R2 values were extracted by fitting the peak intensities to the equation I(t) = B exp(-R2t). The experiments were carried out using the pulse sequences described by Farrow et al. (36Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar). C-terminal Extension at PR Retards the Autoprocessing Activity of the Precursor—We checked the autoproteolytic activity of TFR-PR and TFR-PR-Cnn precursors in vivo (Fig. 1, lanes II and VII). For TFR-PR, we see no trace of the precursor in the SDS-PAGE after 6 h of induction. This is clear evidence that the TFR does not prevent the autoprocessing activity of the precursor (lane VII). However, in the case of TFR-PR-Cnn we see the presence of the intact precursor in the gel (lane II). Thus the C-terminal extension in our TFR-PR precursor slowed down autoprocessing. Our MALDI result with the purified protein also points to the same fact (Fig. 2). For the TFR-PR we see only an ∼11-kDa peak for the PR and a ∼7-kDa peak for the TFR part; however for the TFR-PR-Cnn we see a peak at ∼18 kDa corresponding to the precursor. This seems to suggest that the C-terminal extension possibly interacts with the PR region; either it interferes with dimer formation or it blocks the active site as has been observed for the SFNF stretch at the C terminus of the TFR in an earlier study (26Paulus C.

For this purpose we first prepared a D25N mutant of the precursor, which is inactive as the mutation is at the active site of PR. At the same time it is also known that the D25N mutation does not affect the folding of the protease (37Louis J.M. Ishima R. Nesheiwat I. Pannell L.K. Lynch S.M. Torchia D.A. Gronenborn A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6085-6092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This mutant precursor is thus stable for weeks together and is ideally suited for structural characterization by NMR. However, it turned out that the protein had a high tendency to aggregate, as seen by dynamic light scattering, capillary electrophoresis (data not shown), and also by NMR (see below), over a wide range of experimental conditions of pH and temperature. Deleting the C-terminal extension also did not make any difference with regard to this behavior. This is at variance with the earlier report by Ishima et al. (33Ishima R. Torchia D.A. Shannon M.L. Angela M.G. Louis J.M. J. Biol.

Therefore to investigate the intrinsic folding characteristics of our present precursor, we undertook to elucidate the structural characteristics in 8 m urea and the transitions therefrom by NMR, and the various equilibrium intermediates were created by systematically varying the urea concentration. In the following, we first describe the sequence-specific resonance assignments for the various urea denatured states and then present the structural and dynamic characterizations of the precursor at pH 5.2 and 32 °C. Resonance Assignments—The TFR-PR-Cnn precursor is 161 residues long, of which the first 57 residues belong to the TFR portion. The next 99 residues, that is, 58–156 actually constitute the PR portion. Hence residues 59–62, 152–156 form the dimerization domain, 82–84 form the active site, 138–140 form the substrate binding cleft, 100–106 form the hinge region, and 109–112 constitute the mobile flaps in the PR (35Panchal S.C. Pillai B. Hosur M.V. Hosur R.V. Curr. Sci. 2000; 79: 1684-1695Google Scholar). The final five residues (157–161) having the sequence GGSSG, constitute an extension to the PR at the C terminus. Henceforth we will use these numbers for structural discussion. Conventionally, backbone assignment in proteins has been achieved by a combination of several three-dimensional triple resonance experiments, typically, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, CBCANH, and CBCA(CO)NH (reviewed recently in Ref. 38Ferentz A.E. Wagner G. Quart. Rev. Biophys. 2000; 33: 29-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). These experiments display correlations between HN, 15N, and (Cα, Cb) nuclei along the protein backbone. The success of this approach depends critically on the dispersion of the Cα, Cβ chemical shifts, and therefore for unfolded proteins, where this dispersion is very poor, the method has serious limitations. Our methodology of assignment is based on the recently described triple resonance experiments HNN and HN(C)N (39Panchal S.C. Bhavesh N.S. Hosur R.V. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The most significant feature of these experiments is the observation of different patterns of positive and negative peaks in the (F1, F3) planes depending on the residue types at i-1, i, and i+1 positions. These have been discussed in detail earlier (39Panchal S.C. Bhavesh N.S. Hosur R.V. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 40Bhavesh N.S. Panchal S.C. Hosur R.V. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14727-14735Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar); suffice it to say here that glycines and prolines play important roles in this regard, the former because of the absence of the Cβ, and the latter because of the absence of the amide proton. Triplets containing these residues produce very characteristic patterns in the (F1, F3) planes, which can be termed as fixed points. These provide many starts and check points for the sequential walk, and hence it is less crucial to obtain side chain assignment to validate the backbone assignments. Nevertheless, simultaneous analysis"

Using green fluorescent protein-PU.1 fusions, we show that the Ets DNA binding domain of PU.1 is necessary and sufficient for its nuclear localization. Fluorescence and ultrastructural nuclear import assays showed that PU.1 nuclear import requires energy but not soluble carriers. PU.1 interacted directly with two nucleoporins, Nup62 and Nup153. The binding of PU.1 to Nup153, but not to Nup62, increased dramatically in the presence of RanGMPPNP, indicating the formation of a PU.1·RanGTP·Nup153 complex. The Ets domain accounted for the bulk of the interaction of PU.1 with Nup153 and RanGMPPNP. Because Nup62 is located close to the midplane of the nuclear pore complex whereas Nup153 is at its nuclear side, these findings suggest a model whereby RanGTP propels PU.1 toward the nuclear side of the nuclear pore complex by increasing its affinity for Nup153. This notion was confirmed by ultrastructural studies using gold-labeled PU.1 in permeabilized cells.

Nuclear import of proteins occurs through the nuclear pore complex (NPC), 1The abbreviations used are: NPC, nuclear pore complex; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GMPPNP, guanosine 5′-(β,γ-iminotriphosphate); GST, glutathione S-transferase; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GDP-bound form of RanGDP; RanGTP, GTP-bound form of Ran; RanGMP-PNP, GMPPNP-bound form of Ran; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; TB, transport buffer.1The abbreviations used are: NPC, nuclear pore complex; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GMPPNP, guanosine 5′-(β,γ-iminotriphosphate); GST, glutathione S-transferase; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GDP-bound form of RanGDP; RanGTP, GTP-bound form of Ran; RanGMP-PNP, GMPPNP-bound form of Ran; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; TB, transport buffer. and in most cases involves an interaction between soluble carriers and nuclear localization sequences on the cargo protein (1Chook Y.M. Blobel G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 2Weis K. Cell. 2003; 112: 441-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Most soluble carriers belong to the karyopherin/importin family and mediate transport either as monomers or as heterodimers. For example, classical nuclear localization sequences are bound by a heterodimer that consists of karyopherin α (importin α) and karyopherin β1 (importin β). Members of the karyopherin β family interact with nucleoporins and thus mediate the interaction between their cargoes and the NPC. A subset of nucleoporins contains FG repeats and have been implicated in nuclear import through interacting with cargo and carriers (3Ryan K.J. Wente S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Carrier-mediated nuclear import usually requires energy in the form of GTP, although exceptions have been reported (4Englmeier L. Olivo J.C. Mattaj I.W. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 30-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 5Ribbeck K. Kutay U. Paraskeva E. Gorlich D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 47-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The GTP requirement is mediated by the small GTPase Ran, which cycles between GDP- and GTP-bound forms (RanGDP and RanGTP, respectively). RanGTP is present in the nucleus where it dissociates import complexes by binding to members of the karyopherin β family. Carrier proteins such as karyopherin β1 (importin β), karyopherin β2 (transportin), and karyopherin α (importin α) can enter the nucleus unassisted by soluble proteins, presumably by interacting with nucleoporins (6Kose S.

Dis. 2003; 31: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In addition, several lines of evidence have implicated PU.1 in the pathogenesis of leukemia. PU.1 was originally identified as an oncogene that is up-regulated in mouse erythroleukemias induced by the Friend virus, and PU.1 transgenic mice develop erythroleukemia (26Moreau-Gachelin F.

Immunol. 2004; 172: 4941-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the mechanisms by which PU.1 is imported into the nucleus have not been studied.Here we dissect the nuclear import of PU.1 using both classical fluorescence-based nuclear import assays and ultrastructural import assays and show that it is independent of soluble carriers but requires energy. The karyopherin independence is explained by direct interactions between PU.1 and nucleoporins Nup62 and Nup153. The affinity of PU.1 for Nup153 is increased dramatically in the presence of RanGMPPNP (GMPPNP is a nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP), indicating the formation of a ternary PU.1·RanGTP·Nup153 complex. In contrast, RanGMPPNP does not enhance the binding of PU.1 to Nup62. Because Nup62 is located close to the midplane of the NPC and Nup153 is at the nuclear end of the NPC, these findings suggest that RanGTP creates a gradient of increasing affinity for PU.1 toward the nuclear side of the NPC. This notion is supported by ultrastructural studies using gold-labeled PU.1 in permeabilized cells. These findings provide an explanation for the energy requirement of PU.1 nuclear import. Using GFP-PU.1 fusions, we show that the Ets domain of PU.1 is necessary and sufficient for its nuclear localization in transfected cells. The Ets domain also accounts for the bulk of the interaction of PU.1 with Nup153 and RanGMPPNP, underscoring the importance of this interaction for nuclear import. Based on these findings we suggest a model for the energy-dependent translocation of PU.1 through the NPC.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Transfection—HeLa cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin.Plasmids that express GFP-PU.1 and its derivatives were transfected into HeLa cells grown on coverslips using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions.In Vitro Nuclear Import Assays—HeLa cells grown on coverslips were washed twice with PBS and then washed twice with transport buffer (TB) consisting of 20 mm HEPES·KOH, pH 7.3, 110 mm potassium acetate, and 2 mm magnesium acetate. The cells were permeabilized with 35 μg/ml digitonin (Calbiochem) in TB containing protease inhibitors (complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablet, Roche Applied Science) for 5 min at room temperature. After two washes with 50 μl of TB, the cells were incubated with 30 μl of the import mix for 20 min at room temperature. All import mixes contained the import substrate and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in TB. The energy-regenerating system consisted of 2 mm ATP (Sigma), 5 mm phosphocreatine (Sigma), 20 units/ml creatine phosphokinase (Sigma), and 2 mm GTP (Sigma). The complete nuclear import assay with carriers included 0.6 μg of karyopherin α3, 0.5 μg of karyopherin β1, and 0.6 μg of RanGDP, in addition to the above. The cells were then washed twice with TB followed by fixation with 4% formaldehyde (Polysciences) in TB for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were washed twice with TB and mounted with ProLong antifade reagent (Molecular Probes). The cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy with a Leica TCS SP spectral confocal microscope.Electron Microscopy—Recombinant PU.1 was conjugated to 5-nm colloidal gold beads (BBI International) as described previously (47Yaseen N.R. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5516-5521Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were seeded at about 30% confluence the day before the experiments in a 24-well plate. Cells were washed twice with PBS and twice with transport buffer and were permeabilized with digitonin (as described above). Permeabilized cells were incubated with 200 μl of import mix for 30 or 60 min at room temperature with gentle rocking every 5 min. The import mix contained gold-conjugated PU.1 and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in TB, in the presence or absence of the energy-regenerating system (see above). After the import reaction, the cells were washed twice with TB and fixed with 2.5% glutaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4. The samples were prepared as described (48Pain D. Murakami H. Blobel G. Nature. 1990; 347: 444-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and examined with a JEOL 100CX electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HeLa cells grown on coverslips were washed twice with PBS and then fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. After two washes with PBS, the cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were washed twice with PBS and then incubated with the mouse monoclonal antibody mAb414 (Covance), that recognizes several nucleoporins and therefore highlights the nuclear membrane, at 1:2000 dilution in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes in PBS, the cells were incubated with Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) (1:200 dilution in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed three times with PBS and then mounted with ProLong antifade reagent. The cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy with a Leica TCS SP spectral confocal microscope.Plasmids—The human PU.1 open reading frame was obtained by PCR from a pGEX-3X vector kindly provided by Dr. Elizabeth Eklund and subcloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pGEX-6P1 (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting 6P1-PU.1 vector was used to produce recombinant PU.1 protein for ultrastructural and binding studies. The EGFP open reading frame was amplified with EcoRI and BamHI flanking sites by PCR from the pIRES2-EGFP vector (BD Biosciences) and subcloned along with PU.1 (flanked by BamHI and XhoI sites) between the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pGEX-6P1 by triple ligation. The resulting 6P1-GFP-PU.1 vector was used to produce GST-GFP-PU.1 protein for binding assays and GFP-PU.1 protein for in vitro import assays. The PU.1 open reading frame was divided into PU(1–149) and PU(150–264) using the SmaI site and into PU(1–94) and PU(94–264) using the NcoI site. These fragments were subcloned into pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences) and into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) along with an N-terminal GFP tag in a manner similar to that described for full-length PU.1. The vector pEGFP-C1 (BD Biosciences) was used to express GFP as a control in transfection studies.The open reading frame of Nup62 was amplified from Human Testis Marathon Ready cDNA (BD Biosciences) by PCR and was cloned into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1/HisB (Invitrogen). Nup62N encoding amino acids 1–265 of Nup62 and Nup62C encoding amino acids 178–522 of Nup62 were cloned into EcoRI/XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1/HisB.

Nup153(1–607), Nup153(1–895), Nup153(1–1204), and Nup153(301–1204) were amplified from the pET28b-Nup153(FL) and subcloned into the NheI/NotI sites of a modified vector derived from pET28a (Novagen), provided by Dr. Thomas Schwartz. All PCR products were checked by sequencing. A portion of the Nup153 open reading frame encoding amino acids 346–1175 was also subcloned into the SmaI/XhoI sites of pGEX4T-2 for recombinant protein expression.Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant GFP-PU.1 was produced from the 6P1-GFP-PU.1 vector in BL21(DE3) bacteria and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) followed by digestion with Pre-Scission protease (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant PU.1 for ultrastructural and binding studies was produced similarly from the 6P1-PU.1 vector. GST, GST-Nup153(346–1175), GST-Nup62N, GST-GFP-PU.1, GST-GFP-PU(1–149), and GST-GFP-PU(150–264) for binding studies were produced in BL21(DE3) bacteria, purified by binding to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads, and stored at -80 °C after snap freezing. Recombinant karyopherins α and β were produced as described previously (50Kohler M. Speck C. Christiansen M. Bischoff F.R. Prehn S. Haller H. Gorlich D. Hartmann E. Mol. Cell.

The amounts of translation products from different deletion constructs were compared by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, and the amounts used for binding assays were adjusted accordingly to produce bands of equal intensity. Binding assays were carried out essentially as described previously (51Yaseen N.R. Blobel G. J. Biol.

For a binding reaction, 10 μl of beads of immobilized recombinant protein were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with either in vitro translated or recombinant protein in 36 μl of TB with 0.1% Tween 20 (TB-T). The supernatants and the material that remained bound to the beads after three washes in cold TB-T were separated in 4–20% polyacrylamide gradients by SDS-PAGE. For in vitro translated proteins, the gel was dried and exposed to film. Recombinant PU.1 was detected by immunoblotting using anti-PU.1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-352), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2054), and the SuperSignal West Pico substrate system (Pierce). The ratio of the unbound to bound materials analyzed was ∼1:4.RESULTSThe Ets Domain of PU.1 Is Necessary and Sufficient for Its Nuclear Import in Intact Cells—Although PU.1 is normally expressed in hematopoietic cells, the in vitro assays used for dissecting the mechanisms of nuclear import are usually carried out in permeabilized epithelial cells such as HeLa cells (54Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). To determine whether PU.1 would undergo nuclear import in HeLa cells, a construct expressing a GFP-PU.1 fusion protein was transfected into HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 1, GFP-PU.1 localized exclusively to the nucleus, whereas the GFP tag alone was distributed diffusely throughout the cell.To identify the region of PU.1 responsible for its nuclear localization, deletion constructs of PU.1 fused to GFP were prepared and transfected into HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 1, PU.1 fragments that contain the Ets DNA binding domain (amino acids 150–264) are localized exclusively to the nucleus, whereas fragments that do not include the Ets domain are distributed diffusely throughout the cell in a pattern similar to that of the GFP control. Thus, the Ets domain is necessary and sufficient for the nuclear localization of PU.1.Nuclear Import of PU.1 Requires Energy but Not Import Carriers—To elucidate the mechanisms by which PU.1 is imported into the nucleus, recombinant GFP-PU.1 fusion protein was used in a classical in vitro nuclear import assay (54Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Cells were permeabilized with digitonin to solubilize the plasma membrane and washed to remove cytosolic components. This treatment leaves the nuclear membrane intact. When GFP-PU.1 was added to the permeabilized cells alone, it was localized mainly in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2A, left panel). The addition of GTP and an energy-regenerating system resulted in import of GFP-PU.1 into the nucleus (Fig. 2A, middle panel). For the sake of simplicity, we will refer to GTP and the energy regenerating system as “energy.” A standard nuclear import mixture that includes karyopherin β1, karyopherin α, and RanGDP, in addition to energy, did not further increase import (Fig. 2A, right panel). Thus, GFP-PU.1 import required energy but not import carriers.Fig. 2A, GFP-PU.1 nuclear import is energy-dependent and carrier-independent. Digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells were incubated for 30 min with an import assay mixture containing GFP-PU.1 in the absence of energy (left panel), in the presence of energy (middle panel), and in the presence of energy and import carriers (right panel) (see “Experimental Procedures”). At least 200 cells for each condition were examined, and more than 95% showed a GFP distribution similar to that shown. Bar, 10 μm. B, digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with the import assay mixture containing PU.1/5-nm gold conjugates in the presence or absence of energy. Samples were processed for electron microscopy as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and beads in the nucleus and cytoplasm were counted in electron micrographs from five randomly selected areas for each condition. The average number of beads/μm2 of nucleus (N) and cytoplasm (C) is shown. Bar, 100 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm this result further and to exclude any artifact related to the GFP tag, an ultrastructural in vitro nuclear import assay was carried out using recombinant PU.1 conjugated to 5-nm gold beads. Cells were permeabilized with digitonin and incubated with gold-conjugated PU.1 in the presence or absence of energy. As shown in Fig. 2B, PU.1 entered the nucleus in the presence of energy, confirming the energy-dependent and carrier-independent nuclear import of PU.1. Carrier-independent import is usually attributable to interactions between the protein and nucleoporins (10Fagotto F. Gluck U. Gumbiner B.M. Curr.

By characterizing the class of anti-integrin monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that stimulate integrin activation and ligand binding, we have identified integrin-ligand-mAb complexes that exhibit differential signaling properties. Specifically, addition of 12G10 mAb to cells adhering via integrin α4β1 was found to trigger disruption of the actin cytoskeleton and prevent cell attachment and spreading, whereas mAb addition to cells adhering via α5β1 stimulated all of these processes. In contrast, soluble ligand binding to either α4β1 or α5β1 was augmented or unaffected by 12G10. The regions of the integrin responsible for differential signaling were then mapped using chimeras. Surprisingly, a chimeric α5 integrin containing the β-propeller domain from the ligand binding pocket of α4 exhibited the same signaling properties as the full-length α4 integrin, whereas exchanging or removing cytoplasmic domains had no effect. Thus the mAb 12G10 demonstrates dual functionality, inhibiting cell adhesion and spreading while augmenting soluble ligand binding, via a mechanism that is determined by the extracellular β-propeller domain of the associating α-subunit. These findings therefore demonstrate a direct and variable agonistic link between the ligand binding pocket of integrins and the cell interior that is independent of the α cytoplasmic domains. We propose that either ligand-specific transmembrane conformational changes or ligand-specific differences in the kinetics of transmembrane domain separation underlie integrin agonism.

We propose that either ligand-specific transmembrane conformational changes or ligand-specific differences in the kinetics of transmembrane domain separation underlie integrin agonism. Integrin cell adhesion receptors are uniquely positioned at a nexus regulating the signaling flux between the outside of the cell and the cell interior. Integrins dynamically link the deformable meshwork of the extracellular matrix and the contractile actin microfilament system and thereby enable cells to direct membrane protrusions and apply contractile force to adhesive extracellular sites (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6753) Google Scholar). These adhesion-dependent signals are mediated by the clustering of integrins and the congregation of signaling adaptors and enzymes into specialized morphological structures, including focal complexes, focal adhesions, and fibrillar adhesions (2Geiger B. Bershadsky A. Pankov R. Yamada K.M. Nat. Rev. 2001; 2: 793-805Crossref Scopus (1813) Google Scholar). In this way, the integrincytoskeletal junction is thought to impose temporal and spatial control on adhesion-related signaling events (3Miranti C.K. Brugge J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar).Integrins are non-covalently-linked αβ heterodimers. In mammals, 18 α- and 8 β-subunits combine to form 24 different receptors, with ligand-binding specificity being determined by the particular αβ combination. Both subunits have a conserved, modular domain structure, except that 9 α-subunits contain an additional extracellular domain that is homologous to the A domain of von Willebrand factor. This domain endows these receptors with a different mode of ligand binding and as such integrins should be classified into two subclasses depending on the presence or absence of this domain. All integrins, however, bind to their ligands in a divalent cation-dependent manner with manganese and magnesium promoting, and calcium disfavoring, ligand binding (4Humphries M.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 311-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Recent NMR, electron microscopic, and x-ray crystallographic studies have delivered major advances in our understanding of integrin structure (5Takagi J.

The ligand binding “head” region of αVβ3 comprises a seven-bladed β-propeller module in the α-subunit and a von Willebrand factor type A domain in the β-subunit (βA domain, 1The abbreviations used are: βA domain, von Willebrand factor type A domain in the β-subunit; mAb, monoclonal antibody; VCAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule; PSI, plexin-semaphorin-integrin; Fn, fibronectin; H/120, recombinant fragment of Fn comprising type III repeats 12–15 plus IIICS segment; FnIII(6–10), recombinant fragment of Fn comprising type III repeats 6–10; HBS, HEPES-buffered saline; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PKA, protein kinase A; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase.1The abbreviations used are: βA domain, von Willebrand factor type A domain in the β-subunit; mAb, monoclonal antibody; VCAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule; PSI, plexin-semaphorin-integrin; Fn, fibronectin; H/120, recombinant fragment of Fn comprising type III repeats 12–15 plus IIICS segment; FnIII(6–10), recombinant fragment of Fn comprising type III repeats 6–10; HBS, HEPES-buffered saline; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PKA, protein kinase A; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase. also referred to as I-like domain). This head region is attached to two legs, one formed from each subunit, which provide a link to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Extending from the α-subunit β-propeller, the α-subunit leg comprises three β-sandwich domains, termed thigh, calf 1 and calf 2. The β-subunit domain organization is more complex with the βA domain being inserted into an immunoglobulin hybrid domain. Therefore, although the βA domain is distal to the membrane insertion site, it is not at the N terminus of the primary sequence. Furthermore, the hybrid domain is preceded by, and inserted into, a plexin-semaphorin-integrin (PSI) domain (9Xiao T. Takagi J. Coller B.S. Wang J.-H. Springer T.A. Nature. 2004; 432: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). The PSI domain is located below the hybrid domain and alongside the β-subunit leg, which consists of four tandem cysteine-rich epidermal growth factor-like domains and a C-terminal β-sheet domain termed the β-tail domain. Both subunits are linked to relatively short (typically <60 amino acid residues) cytoplasmic tail domains via a single transmembrane pass.The extracellular matrix components and cell surface molecules that comprise the family of integrin ligands are many and varied. Individual integrin ligands have been shown to bind to several integrins, and reciprocally, individual integrins bind to multiple ligands (10van der Flier A. Sonnenberg A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 305: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Ligand binding to integrins requires the formation of a ligand carboxyl-divalent cation coordination complex at the metal ion-dependent adhesion site in the integrin A domain (8Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak Frech M. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar, 11Emsley J. Knight C.J. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Liddington R.C.

In non-αA domain-containing integrins, residues from both the β-subunit A domain and the α-subunit β-propeller domain contribute to ligand binding, and ligand binding specificity has been shown to be determined by loop structures in these regions (12Takagi J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20324-20336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Integrin-mediated adhesion has wide-ranging effects on cell survival, motility, differentiation, and proliferation (3Miranti C.K. Brugge J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, therefore, the signals generated by integrins and the composition of different adhesion signaling structures initiated by integrin-ligand engagement are highly diverse (2Geiger B. Bershadsky A. Pankov R. Yamada K.M. Nat. Rev. 2001; 2: 793-805Crossref Scopus (1813) Google Scholar). However, the key molecular events determining this diversity and the mechanisms determining the variation in the signals transduced by different integrin heterodimers are largely unknown.Distinctive cellular responses to integrin-ligand engagement have been reported on substrates recognized by the fibronectin (Fn)-binding integrin α4β1. Engagement of this integrin results in an enhanced cell migratory phenotype coupled to a reduction in cell spreading and focal adhesion formation, compared with α2β1 or α5β1. These functional properties were demonstrated to be conferred by the α4 cytoplasmic domain (15Chan B.M. Kassner P.D. Schiro J.A. Byers H.R. Kupper T.S. Hemler M.E. Cell. 1992; 68: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 16Kassner P.D. Hemler M.E. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 649-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 17Kassner P.D. Alon R. Springer T.A. Hemler M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 6: 661-674Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that the α4 cytoplasmic domain modulates the association of cytoskeletal and signaling molecules with its partner β1 cytoplasmic domain differently to that of α2 or α5. Alternatively they suggest that the α4 tail binds directly to cytoplasmic factors that modulate integrin signaling. In this regard, α4 has been shown to bind directly to paxillin, with the association reducing cell spreading and promoting cell migration (18Liu S. Thomas S.M. Woodside D.G. Rose D.M. Kiosses W.B. Pfaff M. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Thus, at present, the α-subunit cytoplasmic tails are believed to have a major effect on the generation of integrin signal diversity from different αβ heterodimers. Recent evidence has indicated that the extracellular βA domain also plays a role in the generation of signal diversity. The βA domains of the β1- and β3-subunits were found to display different abilities to activate the Rho family of GTPases, which are involved in cytoskeletal organization (19Miao H. Li S. Hu Y.-L. Yuan S. Zhao Y. Chen B.P.C. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Tarui T. Shyy J.Y.-J. Takada Y. Usami S. Chien S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2199-2206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Danen E.H.J. Sonneveld P. Brakebusch C. Fassler R. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 259: 1071-1086Crossref Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Signal diversity from integrin-ligand engagement can also result from additional co-operating signaling partners. In this regard, α4β1 and α5β1 demonstrate a differential requirement for protein kinase Cα signaling during cell migration and the formation of focal adhesion structures. These processes are mediated through the co-operative signaling of the proteoglycan co-receptor syndecan-4 with α5β1, but not with α4β1 (21Mostafavi-Pour Z. Askari J. Parkinson S.J. Parker P. Ng T.T.C. Humphries M.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar).To carry out its dynamic functions, integrin structure is specialized to be highly responsive and regulated (22Humphries M.J. McEwan P.A. Barton S.J. Buckley P.A. Bella J. Mould A.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 313-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 23Travis M.A. Humphries J.D. Humphries M.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 192-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The receptors are able to switch from an inactive (low affinity) to active (high affinity) state, and vice versa, in response to binding events taking place at both the ligand binding pocket and the cytoplasmic domains. A large body of evidence exists to indicate that both priming of integrins, to promote ligand binding, and integrin activation, subsequent to ligand binding, involve conformational changes between and within the integrin subunits (22Humphries M.J. McEwan P.A. Barton S.J. Buckley P.A. Bella J. Mould A.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 313-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A distinctive feature of integrin activation is the transition from a highly bent conformation, which represents the inactive form, to an extended, primed conformation. The bend in the molecule is located between the thigh and calf domains of αV and the epidermal growth factor-like 2/3 domains of β3 (5Takagi J. Petre B.M. Waltz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar, 7Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar).The studies described above raise many questions relating to integrin structure and function. For example, how is the efficacy of signaling by different integrins determined? How is ligand binding converted into a signal? What is the signaling route taken through the integrin? Are the mechanisms of priming and activation different or the same? Some of these questions have already begun to be answered. For example, engagement of integrins with their ligands results in conformational changes within the integrin βA domains leading to the swing-out of the hybrid domain in relation to the ligand-binding head region and the propagation of integrin signaling in this manner (5Takagi J. Petre B.M. Waltz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar, 24Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Barton S.J. Kline A.D. McEwan P.A. Craig S.E.

Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17028-17035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the binding of cytoplasmic factors such as talin leads to integrin priming via a route that most likely involves the separation of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains (6Vinogradova O. Velyvis A. Velyviene A. Hu B. Haas T.A. Plow E.F. Qin J. Cell. 2002; 110: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 26Tadokoro S. Shattil S.J. Eto K. Tai V. Linddington R.C. de Pereda J.M. Ginsberg M.H. Calderwood D.A. Science. 2003; 302: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). The differences between these two processes has been suggested to be the basis of the discrimination between integrin priming and activation-induced signals (27Luo B.-H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. PLoS. Biol. 2004; 2: 776-786Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar).We have attempted to address some of these issues by characterizing the class of anti-integrin monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that stimulate integrin activation and ligand binding. Many function-modulating integrin mAbs act allosterically, displacing the conformational equilibrium of the active/inactive integrin to achieve their effects. Therefore anti-integrin mAbs are capable of acting as pseudo-agonists by stabilizing integrin signaling conformations (22Humphries M.J. McEwan P.A. Barton S.J. Buckley P.A. Bella J. Mould A.P.

In this way we have identified integrin-ligand-mAb complexes that exhibit differential signaling properties and determined a hitherto unappreciated mechanism for controlling signal generation diversity that is dictated by the α-subunit region of the integrin ligand binding pocket.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies, Proteins, and Cell Culture—Monoclonal antibodies used were: 12G10, mouse anti-human integrin β1 (29Mould A.P.

Laminin and collagen were purchased from Sigma.All cell lines were from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures unless otherwise stated, passaged every 3–4 days and cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in defined medium as follows. A375-SM human melanoma cells (provided by I. Fidler, University of Texas) were cultured in minimal essential medium with Earle's salts, supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, minimal essential medium vitamins, non-essential amino-acids, sodium pyruvate, and 1% (v/v) l-glutamine. COS-1 African green monkey kidney cells, IMR 32 human neuroblastoma cells, and HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium with 0.11 g/liter sodium pyruvate and pyridoxine supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 1% (v/v) l-glutamine. Cells were detached from flasks by treatment with 1× trypsin/EDTA for 5 min for routine passaging. The MOLT-4 human lymphoblastic leukemia suspension cell line, the K562 human chronic myelogenous leukemia suspension cell line, K562-α3A cells (K562 cells stably transfected with the human α3A integrin subunit; provided by A.

Shore, University of Manchester, UK) were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (w/v) fetal calf serum and 1% (v/v) l-glutamine. An addition of 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) was made for cells transfected with the appropriate expression vector.cDNA Plasmids and Construction of α4/α5 Subunit Chimeras—The α6A cDNA in pRC-CMV was a gift from A. Sonnenberg. Site-directed mutagenesis of α4 and α5 cDNAs was performed using the method of Kunkel (37Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4886) Google Scholar), or using the GeneEditor site-directed mutagenesis kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For GeneEditor, 5′ to 3′ oligonucleotides (MWG-Biotech UK Ltd., Milton Keynes, UK) containing the desired mutations were GTAGTAATTGTTGACGCTAGCTTAAGCCACCCTGAGTCAG for α4 and ATCGTGTCCGCTAGTGCTAGCCTCACCATCTTCCCCGCC for α5. Briefly, to construct the α4/α5 chimera composed of the extracellular and transmembrane region of α4 linked to the cytoplasmic domain of the α5-subunit, a HindIII site was introduced into α4 at the equivalent position to an existing HindIII site in α5 as described previously (16Kassner P.D. Hemler M.E. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 649-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To construct the α4Pα5L chimera, comprising the N-terminal β-propeller domain of α4 (Tyr1-Leu440) with the α5 leg, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains (Thr459-Ala1008), an alignment of the primary structure of α4 and α5 in the region of the β-propeller domain was performed (ClustalW, available at expasy.ch). The conserved ASL sequence (Ala438 in α4 and Ala456 in α5) was chosen to introduce a unique NheI restriction enzyme site into the equivalent position in the α4 and α5 cDNAs. After restriction enzyme digestion the required fragments were ligated into the mammalian expression vector pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) via XhoI/SalI and XbaI sites to enable cell surface expression. All mutagenesis and chimera constructions were verified by DNA sequencing.Transfection of Mammalian Cells—K562 cells were transfected with plasmid DNA either by electroporation or by using GeneJammer transfection reagent (Stratagene). Electroporation was performed with subconfluent cells resuspended to 6–7 × 106 cells/ml (K562 cells) or 7–10 × 106 cells/ml (COS-1 cells). 750 μl of cells was aliquoted into 0.4-cm electroporation cuvettes (Bio-Rad), and 10–20 μg of DNA in 50 μl of water was added on ice for 20 min prior to electroporation at 230 V and 950 microfarads (K562 cells) or 250 V and 950 microfarads (COS-1 cells) with a resultant time constant of 18–22 mS using a Bio-Rad Gene-Pulser II. Electroporated K562 cells were transferred to prewarmed medium and grown for 48 h before addition of the selection antibiotic G418 at 1 mg/ml. Alternatively, 6 μl of GeneJammer transfection reagent (Stratagene) was diluted in serum-free medium for 5–10 min, 1 μg of DNA was added, and the mixture was incubated for 5–10 min. Sub-confluent cells were resuspended at 1–2 × 106 cells/ml, and 1 ml was seeded in 35-mm dishes. The DNA/GeneJammer mixture was added to the cells, and the mixture was incubated for 72 h before passaging into medium containing the selection antibiotic G418 at 1 mg/ml.To enrich the population of transfected K562 cells, cells were subjected to immunomagnetic bead selection. After 2–3 weeks of growth in medium containing selection antibiotics, cells were resuspended to 1 × 107 cells/ml in ice-cold RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1% (v/v) fetal calf serum (wash medium). Antibodies directed against epitopes of interest were added at 5 μg/ml, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min. Cells were washed with cold wash medium before addition of 2 × 107 goat anti-mouse IgG-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-450, Dynal, Bromborough, UK), and the mixture was incubated on ice for 20 min. Bead-cell complexes were isolated using a magnetic separation device (Dynal), and unbound cells were removed by washing in ice-cold wash medium. Bead-cell complexes were resuspended in growth medium plus selection antibiotic, and expression was assessed by fluorescence-activated cell scanning (FACS) analysis (FACscan, BD Biosciences). The bead-sorting procedure was repeated two to three times to obtain cells expressing high levels of the protein of interest. Cells were then cloned by limiting dilution. Identical results were obtained with mixed cell populations and multiple clones. Expression and folding of the α4-subunit was verified by FACS using a panel of anti-α4 and anti-α5 mAbs, or GoH3 for K562-α6 cells.Cell Attachment Assays—96-well plates (Costar Corning) were coated for 60–90 min at room temperature with protein ligands diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen). After aspiration, wells were incubated for 30–60 min with 10 mg/ml filtered, heat-denatured bovine serum albumin (BSA). As controls, some wells were incubated with BSA only. Wells were washed with HEPES-buffered saline (HBS, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm HEPES, pH7.4), before addition of 50 μl of HBS containing 2× final concentration of antibodies, cations, and/or inhibitors where appropriate. Subconfluent cells were washed with HBS, resuspended to 0.2 to 1 × 106 cells/ml, and 50-μl aliquots were added to wells. Plates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and 5% (v/v) CO2. Unbound or loosely bound cells were removed by aspiration and gentle washing with HBS. Wells were fixed by addition of 5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in HBS. To assess the total number of cells added, 100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, and 0% cells were added to wells and fixed by the addition of 1/10 volume of 50% (v/v) glutaraldehyde. Wells were aspirated and washed with HBS before addition of 0.1% (w/v) crystal violet in 200 mm MES pH 6 for 60 min. Wells were then aspirated and washed with water before addition of 10% (v/v) acetic acid, and the absorbance at 570 nm of each well was measured with a multiscan plate reader.Soluble Ligand Binding Assays—Soluble VCAM-1-Fc protein was labeled with the fluorescent dy"
https://openalex.org/W2006474264,"Two open reading frames (nhpS and acsA) were identified immediately downstream of the previously described Pseudomonas chlororaphis B23 nitrile hydratase (NHase) gene cluster (encoding aldoxime dehydratase, amidase, the two NHase subunits, and an uncharacterized protein). The amino acid sequence deduced from acsA shows similarity to that of acyl-CoA synthetase (AcsA). The acsA gene product expressed in Escherichia coli showed acyl-CoA synthetase activity toward butyric acid and CoA as substrates, with butyryl-CoA being synthesized. From the E. coli transformant, AcsA was purified to homogeneity and characterized. The quality of the recombinant protein was verified by the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence and the results of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The apparent Km values for butyric acid, CoA, and ATP were 0.32 ± 0.04, 0.37 ± 0.02, and 0.22 ± 0.02 mm, respectively. AcsA was shown to be a short-chain acyl-CoA synthetase, according to the catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) for various acids. The substrate specificity of AcsA was similar to those of aldoxime dehydratase, NHase, and amidase, the genes of which coexist in the same orientation in the gene cluster. P. chlororaphis B23 grew when cultured in a medium containing butyraldoxime as the sole carbon and nitrogen source. The activities of aldoxime dehydratase, NHase, and amidase were detected together with that of acyl-CoA synthetase under the culture conditions used. Moreover, on culture in a medium containing butyric acid as the sole carbon source, acyl-CoA synthetase activity was also detected. Together with the adjacent locations of the aldoxime dehydratase, NHase, amidase, and acyl-CoA synthetase genes, these findings suggest that the four enzymes are sequentially correlated with one another in vivo to utilize butyraldoxime as a carbon and nitrogen source. This is the first report of an overall “nitrile pathway” (aldoxime→nitrile→amide→acid→acyl-CoA) comprising these enzymes.

One of the fruits of our application-oriented nitrile studies is the current industrial production of acrylamide and nicotinamide using NHase of an actinomycete, Rhodococcus rhodochrous J1 (1Kobayashi M.

Biochem. 1987; 162: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), which was previously used as a catalyst for acrylamide manufacture (10Yamada H. Kobayashi M. Biosci. Biotechnol.

Eisenberg A. Fager S.K. Perkins N.E. Gallagher F.G. Cooper S.M. Gavagan J.E. Stieglitz B. Hennessey S.M. DiCosimo R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1999; 7: 2239-2245Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Because the amount of NHase produced comprises >50% of the total soluble proteins in P. chlororaphis B23 when this strain is cultured in the presence of methacrylamide (31Nagasawa T. Ryuno K. Yamada H. Experientia (Basel). 1989; 45: 1066-1070Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar), there must be a very interesting regulation mechanism for the enzyme expression (9Kobayashi M. Nagasawa T. Yamada H. Trends Biotechnol. 1992; 10: 402-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). We have already cloned the NHase gene from this strain, and we discovered the existence of a gene cluster including the NHase and amidase genes (32Nishiyama M. Horinouchi S. Kobayashi M. Nagasawa T. Yamada H. Beppu T. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2465-2472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Very recently, we also initially discovered that the aldoxime dehydratase gene (oxdA) is an additional member of this gene cluster and that OxdA synthesizes nitriles from the corresponding aldoximes (R-CH═N-OH) (33Oinuma K.-I.

Although we have clarified the nitrile-degradative and -synthetic mechanisms at the protein and gene levels, further metabolism of acids that are formed from the corresponding amides by amidase has never been found. In the present study, we discovered two genes (nhpS and acsA) downstream of the above-mentioned NHase gene cluster in P. chlororaphis B23. We constructed an Escherichia coli transformant overexpressing AcsA, purified the AcsA, and determined its enzymological and physicochemical properties. Although various types of enzymes involved in acid metabolism in living organisms have been reported, we reveal here for the first time that AcsA plays an essential role in acid utilization in the nitrile-degradative pathway, resulting in elucidation of the whole “nitrile pathway.” Materials—All acyl-CoA compounds and acids were purchased from Sigma. DEAE-Sephacel, HiPrep 16/10 Q XL, and a low molecular weight standard kit were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Standard proteins for high-performance gel filtration chromatography were obtained from Oriental Yeast (Tokyo, Japan). All other biochemicals were standard commercial preparations. Plasmids, Strains, and Media—Plasmid pPCN4 carrying the genes encoding NHase and P47K on pUC19 (32Nishiyama M. Horinouchi S. Kobayashi M. Nagasawa T. Yamada H. Beppu T. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2465-2472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used as a probe to clone the downstream region in P. chlororaphis B23. E. coli DH10B (Invitrogen) was used as the host for pUC plasmids (36Yanisch-Perron C. Yieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11450) Google Scholar). E. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL (Novagen, Madison, WI) was used as the host for one plasmid, pET-24a(+) (Novagen), and its derivative, and it was also used for expression of the acyl-CoA synthetase gene (acsA).

Bacteriol. 1995; 117: 2878-2886Crossref Google Scholar) and long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase-deficient mutant strain K27 (CGSC#5478; fadD88) (38Overath P. Pauli G. Schairer H.U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 7: 559-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) were obtained from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center, Yale University (New Haven, CT). E. coli transformants were grown in 2× YT medium (39Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), unless otherwise noted. The culture medium for P. chlororaphis B23 was composed of 1% sucrose, 0.5% (NH4)2SO4, 0.05% KH2PO4, 0.05% K2HPO4, 0.05% MgSO4·7H2O, and 0.001% FeSO4·7H2O (pH 7.0). Unless otherwise stated, sucrose and (NH4)2SO4 were used as carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively. DNA Manipulations—Restriction endonucleases, DNA polymerase, and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Toyobo Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Nucleotides were sequenced by the dideoxy-chain terminating method using an ABI Prism 310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Unless otherwise stated, DNA manipulations were performed essentially as described by Maniatis et al. (39Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Recombinant Acyl-CoA Synthetase— The coding sequence of the enzyme was amplified by PCR with pPCN4 (as described below) as a template. The following two oligonucleotide primers were used: (i) a sense primer, 5′-GAATTCTAAGGAGGAATAGCATATGCGCGATTATGAACACGTTGTTG-3′ containing an EcoRI recognition site (underlined), a ribosome binding site (bold), a TAG stop codon in-frame with the lacZ gene in pUC18 (italic), a NdeI recognition site (double underlined), and 25 nucleotides of acsA starting with the ATG start codon; and (ii) an antisense primer, 5′-GGATCCTTAACCAAGCGCCTGTTGCTTGGAC-3′, containing a BamHI recognition site (underlined) and 25 nucleotides that are complementary to the 3′-end sequence of acsA ending with the TAA stop codon. The amplified DNA was subcloned into vector pUC18 and checked by DNA sequencing. The insert DNA was digested with NdeI and BamHI and then inserted into the respective sites of pET-24a(+). The resultant plasmid was designated as pET-acsA; in this construct, acsA was under the control of the T7 promoter. As for pUC-acsA construction, EcoRI was also used for digestion instead of NdeI, followed by insertion into the respective sites of pUC18. In this construct, acsA was under the control of the lac promoter. E. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL was transformed with pET-acsA, and the recombinant cells were used for the overproduction and purification of acyl-CoA synthetase. The transformed cells were incubated with reciprocal shaking at 37 °C in 25 ml of 2× YT medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. After overnight cultivation, the entire culture was inoculated into 5 liters of the same medium, followed by incubation with shaking at 37 °C for 2 h. Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm to induce the T7 promoter, and further cultivation was carried out at 28 °C for 12 h. All purification procedures were performed at 0–4 °C. Potassium phosphate buffer (KP buffer) (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA and 10% (w/v) glycerol was used throughout the purification, unless noted otherwise. Centrifugation was carried out for 40 min at 10,000 × g. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with 0.1 m KP buffer, and then disrupted by sonication (Insonator Model 201M; Kubota, Tokyo, Japan) to prepare a cell-free extract. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The resulting supernatant was applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column (4 × 16 cm) equilibrated with 0.1 m KP buffer. Protein was eluted from the column with 0.4 liter of 0.1 m KP buffer. The enzyme was collected as flow-through fractions, followed by dialysis against three changes of 5 liters of 10 mm KP buffer. After centrifugation, the enzyme solution was loaded on a HiPrep 16/10 Q XL column (20 ml) equilibrated with 10 mm KP buffer. The enzyme was eluted by increasing the ionic strength of KCl in a linear manner from 0 to 0.2 m in the same KP buffer. The active fractions were combined and dialyzed against 10 mm KP buffer without EDTA and glycerol and then centrifuged. The homogeneity of the purified protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Enzyme Assays—Acyl-CoA synthetase activity was measured by means of the following two assay systems. All of the reactions were performed under linear conditions with regard to protein (∼1 μg/ml) and time (∼4 min). The standard assay A mixture comprised 200 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 5 mm butyric acid, 8 mm CoA, 5 mm ATP, 8 mm MgCl2, 100 mm (NH4)2SO4, and an appropriate amount of enzyme (acyl-CoA synthetase), in a total volume of 150 μl. The reaction was started by the addition of the enzyme and carried out for 4 min at 35 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 150 μl of methanol to the reaction mixture, and a supernatant was obtained by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 5 min). The amount of butyryl-CoA formed was determined by high pressure liquid chromatography with a Shimadzu LC-6A system (Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a Cosmosil 5C18-AR-II column (reversed-phase, 4.6 by 150 mm; Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). The mobile-phase solvent systems were as follows: (i) solvent A, 220 mm KH2PO4-H3PO4 buffer (pH 4.0) with 0.05% (w/v) dithiothreitol; and (ii) solvent B, 98% methanol with 2% chloroform (v/v). Dithiothreitol was added to the solvent systems to prevent oxidation of CoA during the analyses. Chromatographic separation was performed at 40 °C at a flow rate 1.0 ml/min. The mobile-phase composition profile during each chromatography was divided into several linear segments, with each successive segment exhibiting an increased slope. The mobile-phase composition was 94% solvent A/6% solvent B at time 0, 92% solvent A/8% solvent B at time 3, 87% solvent A/13% solvent B at time 4.5, 80% solvent A/20% solvent B at time 6, and 55% solvent A/45% solvent B at time 9. After the final composition of 55% solvent A/45% solvent B had been held for 1.5 min from 9 to 10.5 min, the original conditions were reestablished by means of a reverse gradient to 94% solvent A/6% solvent B from 10.5 to 13 min. This composition was held for 2 min from 13 to 15 min, at which time the column was ready for injection of another sample. The amount of each acyl-CoA sample as a product was measured by monitoring the column effluent at 254 nm (retention time: butyryl-CoA, 13.6 min; acetyl-CoA, 10.8 min). This assay was used to routinely measure acyl-CoA synthetase activity during the purification procedure and to determine the temperature and pH optima of the enzyme. In the case of standard assay B, acyl-CoA synthetase activity was assayed by measuring the acid-dependent formation of AMP with a slight modification (40Kasuya F. Igarashi K. Fukui M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out at 35 °C in a mixture (300 μl) containing 60 μmol of Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 1.5 μmol of butyric acid, 0.9 μmol of CoA, 0.9 μmol of ATP, 0.9 μmol of MgCl2, 30 μmol of (NH4)2SO4, 0.6 μmol of phosphoenol pyruvate, 0.12 μmol of NADH, 0.6 unit of myokinase, 0.7 unit of pyrvate kinase, 0.8 unit of lactate dehydrogenase, and an appropriate amount of enzyme. The reaction was started by the addition of the enzyme and carried out for 4 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 300 μl of methanol to the reaction mixture, followed by measurement of the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. This assay was used to determine the specificity of the enzyme for various acids, with the exception of butyric acid, propionic acid, and acetic acid; the amounts of acyl-CoAs corresponding to the latter three acids were measured by means of standard assay A. One unit of acyl-CoA synthetase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 μmol butyryl-CoA/min and 1 μmol AMP/min under the standard assay A and B conditions, respectively. Specific activity is expressed as units/mg protein. kcat values were calculated with an Mr of 60,210 for the AcsA monomer. The assaying of other enzymes was performed as follows. Aldoxime dehydratase activity was measured anaerobically under reduced conditions (standard assay B) as described previously (33Oinuma K.-I. Hashimoto Y. Konishi K. Goda M. Noguchi T. Higashibata H. Kobayashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29600-29608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). NHase activity was assayed by the method reported previously (29Nagasawa T. Nanba H. Ryuno K. Takeuchi K. Yamada H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 162: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Amidase activity was measured by the same method as reported previously (21Kobayashi M. Komeda H. Nagasawa T. Nishiyama M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Yamada H. Shimizu S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Molecular Mass Determination—The purified enzyme sample was applied to a Superose 12 HR10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences), which was attached to an ÄKTA purifier (Amersham Biosciences) and then eluted with 50 mm KP buffer containing 0.15 m KCl at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. A Superose 12 HR10/30 or Hiload Superdex 200 prep grade 120 ml column (Amersham Biosciences) or a TSK-GEL G3000SW column (Tosoh Co., Tokyo, Japan) was also used. The absorbance of the effluent was recorded at 280 nm. The molecular mass of the enzyme was calculated from the mobilities of the standard proteins glutamate dehydrogenase (290 kDa), lactate dehydrogenase (142 kDa), enolase (67 kDa), adenylate kinase (32 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa). The mass of the protein was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (Axima-CFR plus; Shimadzu). Samples were prepared by mixing the purified protein with an equal volume of a saturated solution of 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 50% acetonitrile, and 1 μl of this solution was spotted onto the MALDI target plate. For mass analysis, external calibration was carried out using two protein standards (equine cytochrome c, average m/z 12,361.96; and bovine serum albumin, average m/z 66,430.09) provided by Sigma. Analytical Methods—Protein concentrations were determined with a Nacalai Tesque protein assay kit, with bovine serum albumin as the standard. SDS-PAGE was performed in a 12% polyacrylamide slab gel according to the method of Laemmli (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar), unless otherwise stated. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The relative molecular mass of the enzyme was calculated from the mobilities of the marker proteins phosphorylase b (94 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (30 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (20.1 kDa), and α-lactalbumin (14.4 kDa). The NH2-terminal amino acid sequences were determined with samples electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane after SDS-PAGE using a Procise protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Concentration of extracellular acetate was measured with an F-kit acetic acid (J. K. International Inc., Tokyo, Japan) according to the method recommended by the manufacturer. Nucleotide Sequence Accession Number—The nucleotide sequence data reported in this study appear in the DDBJ/GenBank™ database under accession number AB125061. Cloning and Nucleotide Sequence of the 3′ Downstream Region of the NHase Gene—In previous studies (32Nishiyama M. Horinouchi S. Kobayashi M. Nagasawa T. Yamada H. Beppu T. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2465-2472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Oinuma K.-I. Hashimoto Y. Konishi K. Goda M. Noguchi T. Higashibata H. Kobayashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29600-29608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we found the close location of five genes, which encode aldoxime dehydratase (OxdA), amidase, the α- and β-subunits of NHase, and P47K (which has been renamed NhpC), in that order. Although we also detected the existence of another open reading frame (ORF) just downstream of nhpC on sequence analysis, this possible ORF (named OrfE previously) has never been obtained as a complete frame; its 3′-coding region was deleted. In order to obtain the complete ORF and to clarify the overall gene organization involved in the nitrile metabolic pathway of P. chlororaphis B23, we tried to clone the downstream regions of the genes obtained so far by the DNA-probing method with a 1.2-kb fragment, which was isolated from pPCN4 (32Nishiyama M. Horinouchi S. Kobayashi M. Nagasawa T. Yamada H. Beppu T. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2465-2472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) digested with XhoI plus SalI, as a probe (Fig. 1). Southern hybridization with this probe against total DNA from P. chlororaphis B23 digested with XhoI revealed that it hybridized with a single fragment of about 5 kb (data not shown). This DNA fragment was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, ligated with pUC18 digested with SalI, and then introduced into E. coli DH10B. Colony hybridization with this probe for screening ampicillin-resistant transformants containing the restriction fragment yielded pPCN41 (Fig. 1). Sequence analyses of the fragment showed that two inserts from pPCN41 and pPCN4 shared a common 1.2-kb XhoI-SalI region. We determined the whole sequence of the XhoI-XhoI 4.8-kb fragment cloned and newly found two complete ORFs clustered with and in the same orientation as the structural genes of aldoxime dehydratase, amidase, subunits α and β of NHase, and NhpC (DDBJ/GenBank™ accession number AB125061). The first ORF (previously named OrfE), which has been renamed nhpS, is 1293 nucleotides long and should encode a protein of 430 amino acids. nhpS showed significant amino acid sequence similarity with a hypothetical protein, Chromobacterium violaceum ATCC12472 (40% identity). The second ORF, named acsA, is 1638 nucleotides long and should encode a protein of 545 amino acids. The protein encoded by acsA showed the highest amino acid sequence similarity with FadD1 (70% identity) from Pseudomonas putida U (Ref. 42Olivera E.R. Carnicero D. García B. Miñambres B.

AcsA is homologous to acetyl-CoA synthetase (31% identity) and acyl-CoA synthetase (25% identity) from E. coli (GenBank™ accession numbers U00006 and L02649, respectively). In particular, two highly conserved sequence elements that comprise the ATP-AMP signature motif (common to all members of the adenylate-forming superfamily) (43Black P.N. DiRusso C.C. Metzger A.K.

In the structure of PheA that belongs to a family of adenylate-forming enzymes, Lys517 is a part of the active site, contacting bot"
https://openalex.org/W2038473949,"The receptor interacting protein 140 (RIP140) belongs to a unique subclass of nuclear receptor coregulators with the ability to bind and repress the action of a number of agonist-bound hormone receptors.

Furthermore, small interfering RNA to RIP140 enhances estrogen-dependent signaling. Our previous studies indicate that RIP140 is a direct target of RA. We report here that RA can abrogate estrogen-mediated cell cycle re-entry. In addition, RA treatment of estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells opposes estrogen receptor-dependent reporter activity, implying that a proportion of RA effects are anti-estrogenic. We provide evidence for a role for RIP140 in mediating anti-estrogenic effects of RA. RIP140 small interfering RNA blocks RA-mediated repression of estrogen receptor activity and provides a growth advantage to estrogen-dependent cells. Together these data implicate a regulatory role for RIP140 in mediating anti-estrogenic effects of RA in estrogendependent breast cancer cells and suggest that acute regulation of coregulator expression may be a general mechanism to integrate diverse hormone signals.

Nuclear receptors are a superfamily of hormone-activated transcription factors, which include retinoic acid receptors (RARs) 1The abbreviations used are: RAR, retinoic acid receptor; RA, all-trans-retinoic acid; RIP140, receptor interacting protein 140 kDa; ER, estrogen receptor; RARE, RA responsive element; ERE, estrogen responsive element; siRNA, small interfering RNA; E2, 17 β-estradiol; HA, hemagglutinin; LCoR, ligand-dependent corepressor. and estrogen receptors (ERs). Organized in a modular fashion, nuclear receptors contain discrete domains that mediate distinct aspects of receptor function, such as DNA binding, ligand binding, dimerization, and transactivation (1Mangelsdorf D.J.

Nuclear receptor-mediated gene expression is regulated by complex and precisely choreographed recruitment of large multiprotein complexes whose activity depends on mutual interactions and post-translational modifications (5Gamble M.J.

The conformation of nuclear receptors depend on the presence of ligand, which determines binding of coregulators, components of basal transcription, and other cofactors, resulting in changes in target gene expression (5Gamble M.J.

However, relatively little attention has focused on mechanisms driving regulation of specific coregulators themselves. Co-repressors N-CoR and SMART, through direct interactions with the AF-2 domain of nuclear receptors, actively repress transcription in the absence of ligand by recruitment of histone deacetylase-associated complexes (8Horlein A.J.

Retinoids at pharmacological doses exhibit a variety of activities associated with cancer prevention. They suppress transformation of cells in vitro, inhibit carcinogenesis in various organs in animal models, reduce premalignant human epithelial lesions, and prevent second primary tumors (as reviewed in Refs. 27Nason-Burchenal K.

Although the underlying mechanism remains elusive, there is evidence to suggest that the growth suppressive effects of retinoids may be, in part, anti-estrogenic in nature (33Fontana J.A. Nervi C.

The current study was designed to assess the role of RIP140 as a mechanism of cross-talk between RAR and ER signaling. Under retinoid dominant conditions, we demonstrated that RA induction of RIP140 constitutes a functional negative feedback signal limiting RA activity at the level of nuclear receptor coregulation in human embryonal carcinoma (25White K.A. Yore M.M. Warburton S.L. Vaseva A.V. Rieder E. Freemantle S.J. Spinella M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43889-43892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we demonstrated that RIP140 has potent rate-limiting effects both in modulating retinoid receptor activity and on the efficacy of retinoids to signal growth suppression and differentiation (25White K.A.

Specifically, silencing RIP140 in human embryonal carcinoma enhances and accelerates retinoid receptor transactivation and RA-mediated maturation (25White K.A. Yore M.M. Warburton S.L. Vaseva A.V.

Acute regulation of coregulators, such as RIP140, may be a general regulatory mechanism in hormonal signaling. RIP140 is predicted to inhibit several, if not all, nuclear receptors (23White J.H. Fernandes I. Mader S. Yang X.J. Vitam. Horm. 2004; 68: 123-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the potential role of RIP140 in mediating crosstalk between RA and ER signaling in a system where both receptors have been characterized, namely retinoid-responsive and estrogen-dependent human breast cancer. Cell Lines, Hormones, Induction Protocols, and Northern Analysis—ER positive, MCF-7 and T47D, and ER negative, MDA-MB-231, human breast cancer cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). All cells were cultured under humidified 5% CO2 at 37 °C in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (50:50) with 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine. Charcoal-absorbed serum was employed for all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) and 17 β-estradiol (E2) inductions to deplete endogenous serum retinoids and estrogens unless otherwise indicated. E2 and RA were purchased from Sigma. RA was stored protected from light under liquid N2 asa10mm stock solution dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). E2 was stored at –20 °C as a 100 μm stock solution dissolved in ethanol (EtOH). The RA induction protocol was as follows. On day –1 cells were fed with complete medium containing charcoal-absorbed sera. On day 0, the medium was replaced with fresh charcoal-absorbed medium containing specific dosages of RA or the vehicle control, Me2SO. The estrogen induction protocol was as follows. On day –3 cells were seeded into phenol-free media with 10% charcoal-absorbed fetal bovine serum supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine. On day 0, medium was replaced with fresh phenol-free medium containing specific dosages of E2 or the vehicle control, EtOH. For Northern analysis, total RNA was isolated using TriReagent (Invitrogen). Northern hybridizations were performed as described previously (24Kerley J.S. Olsen S.L. Freemantle S.J. Spinella M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 969-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The RIP140 probe was a radiolabeled BglII/XhoI 1-kb fragment from plasmid pSG5-HAhRIP140 (22Treuter E. Albrektsen T. Johansson L. Leers J. Gustafsson J.-A. Mol. Endocinol. 1998; 12: 864-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Cell Proliferation Assays—On day –2, MCF-7, T47D, and 231 cell lines were seeded 1:3 into phenol red containing medium with 10% normal sera. On day –1, cell lines were seeded in triplicate into 6-well dishes at 1.75 × 105 cells per well in the above media. 24 h later (on day 0), this medium was replaced with fresh medium containing various doses of RA or vehicle control (Me2SO). Cells were re-fed at 48-h intervals with fresh medium and drug. Cells were harvested via trypsinization and trypan blue-excluded cells were counted using a hemocytometer. Each experimental condition was cultured in triplicate. Average counts were determined from three independent samplings from each triplicate well. Error bars were determined as standard deviations. Expression and Reporter Constructs—The HA-tagged RIP140 expression vector in pSG5, pSG5-HAhRIP140, was kindly provided by Dr. Jan-Ake Gustafsson (Karolinska Institute, Sweden) (22Treuter E. Albrektsen T. Johansson L. Leers J. Gustafsson J.-A. Mol. Endocinol. 1998; 12: 864-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The reporter gene, containing tandem RAREs fused to the minimal herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase promoter and luciferase (RARE-TK-Luc), has been described previously (41Kurie J.M. Buck J. Eppinger T.M. Moy D. Dmitrovsky E. Differentiation. 1993; 54: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The reporter gene containing tandem EREs fused to the minimal herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase promoter and luciferase (ERE2-TK-Luc) were a kind gift from Dr. James DiRenzo (Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH) and have also been described previously (42DiRenzo J. Shang Y. Phelan M. Sif S. Myers M. Kingston R. Brown M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7541-7549Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Transient Transfection Reporter Assays—Transient transfection of MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and NT2/D1 cells has been described previously (43Spinella M.J. Freemantle S.J. Sekula D. Chang J.H. Christie A.J. Dmitrovsky E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22013-22018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.75 × 105 cells per 6-well plate were transfected with 2.75 μg of DNA including 0.75 μg of reporter plasmid, 1.5 μg of expression plasmid, and 0.5 μg of a cytomegalovirus β-galactosidase expression plasmid using Polyfect (Qiagen). In all cases, insertless pSG5 expression plasmid was used to normalize DNA content. All plates transfected with a given plasmid combination received a portion of the same liposomal mixture. Cells were exposed to precipitates for 14–16 h and then washed and cultured with or without RA or E2 for an additional 24 or 48 h before harvest. For siRNA, 0.75 μg of RARE-TK-Luc, 0.5 μg of β-galactosidase expression plasmid, and 1.0 μg of siRNA were co-transfected using Polyfect. Luciferase activities were measured as described (44Spinella M.J. Kitareewan S. Mellado B. Sekula D. Khoo K.S. Dmitrovsky E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3471-3480Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Data points represent the average of triplicate transfection with similar results obtained in at least three independent experiments. siRNA Design and Transfection—The sequence of the custom siRNA duplex for RIP140 (5′-GAAGGAAGCUUUGCUAGCU-3′) corresponds to the human RIP140 cDNA starting 331 bp downstream of the ATG start codon as described previously (25White K.A. Yore M.M. Warburton S.L. Vaseva A.V. Rieder E. Freemantle S.J. Spinella M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43889-43892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and was purchased from Dharmacon. The siRNA duplex control used was the Scramble II sequence from Dharmacon. Transfection of siRNA was performed with OligofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The final concentration of siRNA used in each experiment was ∼150 nm. In independent experiments, transfection efficiency was assessed to be greater than 90% using fluorescein-labeled siRNA (Dharmacon). For select experiments a second siRNA for RIP140 (5′-CAAACAGGAUAGCACAUUA-3′) corresponding to human RIP140 cDNA starting 1986 bp downstream of the ATG start codon was employed. Cell Cycle Analysis—For cell cycle phase analysis, 1 × 106 cells were fixed with 70% ethanol and stained with propidium iodide for 16 h. The percentages of cells in G1, S, and G2/M were then determined on a BD Biosciences FACscan flow cytometer using Modfit LT software and established techniques (43Spinella M.J. Freemantle S.J. Sekula D. Chang J.H. Christie A.J. Dmitrovsky E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22013-22018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Overexpression of RIP140 Represses ER Activity—In prior studies it was shown that RA acutely up-regulates the nuclear receptor coregulator, RIP140 (24Kerley J.S. Olsen S.L. Freemantle S.J. Spinella M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 969-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25White K.A. Yore M.M. Warburton S.L. Vaseva A.V. Rieder E. Freemantle S.J. Spinella M.J. J.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2880-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Because it has been suggested that RIP140 can inhibit nuclear receptor activation, including that mediated by ER, the potential role of RIP140 as a rate-limiting regulator of ER was investigated. Overexpression of RIP140 greatly reduced estrogen-dependent ERE-TK-Luc activity in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1A). Even relatively low amounts of transfected RIP140 was able to potently suppress estrogen-dependent promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). RIP140 transfection had no effect on a SV40-driven control reporter or a TK-control reporter (data not shown). RIP140 overexpression had little effect on basal ERE-dependent reporter activity, which is in support of previous findings that RIP140 most effectively targets estrogen-bound ER. Repression of RIP140 Enhances ER Activity—Because RIP140 contains 10 LXXLL motifs and binds receptors in a ligand-dependent fashion, both features of classic coactivators, it has been questioned whether the repressor effects of overexpressed RIP140 are because of a non-physiologic squelchingtype mechanism. To further address this question we designed siRNA to RIP140 to assess the effects of suppressing endogenous RIP140 expression on ER activity. siRNA specific to RIP140, but not a control siRNA, robustly inhibited both basal and RA-induced expression of RIP140 in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, RIP140 siRNA enhanced ERE-TK Luc reporter activity. Control, scrambled siRNA had no effect on RARE reporter activity and RIP140 siRNA had no effect on SV40 β-galactosidaseor p53-dependent reporter activities (data not shown). This finding supports the hypothesis that endogenous RIP140 functions to inhibit ligand-activated ER. The low level of enhancement seen with siRNA to RIP140 in the Me2SO control may be because of the presence of low levels of endogenous estrogen in charcoal-absorbed sera. RIP140 siRNA also stimulated ERE activity in ER-independent NT2/D1 cells co-transfected with an expression plasmid for ER (Fig. 2C). Repression of RIP140 Sensitizes MCF-7 Cells to Estrogen— The effects of perturbing RIP140 expression on estrogen-dependent growth of MCF-7 cells was then explored. As depicted in Fig. 3A, RIP140 siRNA increased the growth of MFC-7 cells under estrogen-replete growth conditions. To explore this effect further the effect of RIP140 depletion under defined estrogen conditions was assessed. Estrogen starvation of MCF-7 cells resulted in growth suppression as evidenced by a decrease of ∼30% of cells in S-phase (Fig. 3B). As compared with control siRNA, RIP140 siRNA had little effect on the ability of MCF7 cells to growth arrest with estrogen depletion. This is consistent with the inability of RIP140 to bind ER in the absence of ligand (11Cavailles V. Dauvois S. L'Horset F. Lopez G. Hoare S. Kushner P.J. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3741-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 45Peters G.A. Khan S.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, RIP140 siRNA enhanced estrogenmediated cell cycle re-entry (Fig. 3B). The enhanced sensitivity of MCF-7 RIP140 siRNA cells to estrogen could be demonstrated at estrogen levels as low as 1 pm (Fig. 3B). Thus, RIP140 silencing provided MCF-7 cells with a growth advantage under defined estrogen exposure. Similar to the situation for RA signaling in human embyronal carcinoma (24Kerley J.S. Olsen S.L. Freemantle S.J. Spinella M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 969-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25White K.A. Yore M.M. Warburton S.L. Vaseva A.V. Rieder E. Freemantle S.J. Spinella M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43889-43892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), this data supports a role for RIP140 in limiting ER signaling in human breast cancer cells. RA Inhibits Growth of ER-positive Breast Cancer Cells and Represses Expression of ER Target Genes—Because RA induction of RIP140 could potentially be a mechanism of repressional cross-talk between RA and estrogen signaling pathways, the extent to which RA is anti-estrogenic was investigated. Under estrogen-replete conditions, RA dose-dependently inhibited the growth of ER-positive MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cells but not ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 4A). Under these conditions RA was able to inhibit the transcription of the known direct ER-target genes pS2, Cathespin D, and Cyclin D1 in MCF-7 and T47D cells (Fig. 4A, inset, and data not shown). This has been shown previously in the case of pS2 (33Fontana J.A. Nervi C. Shao Z.M. Jetten A.M. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3938-3945PubMed Google Scholar, 34Demirpence E. Balaguer P. Trousse F.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5110-5116PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, despite the lack of RA-mediated growth suppression in MDA-MB-231 cells compared with MCF-7 and T47D cells, both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells supported RA-mediated activation of an RARE-TK-Luc reporter (Fig. 4B). The induction in MDA-MB-231 cells was reduced, supporting some previous findings (40Rousseau C. Pettersson F. Couture M.C. Paquin A. Galipeau J. Mader S. Miller Jr., W.H. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 86: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 46Shao Z.M. Dawson M.I. Li X.S. Rishi A.K. Sheikh M.S. Han Q.X. Ordonez J.V. Shroot B. Fontana J.A. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 493-504PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the transcript levels of established RA target genes RIP140, CRABP2, and HAS2 were induced by RA under estrogen-replete conditions in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 4C, and data not shown). These findings suggest that RA is at least partially anti-estrogenic in MCF-7 and T47D cells, whereas MDA-MB-231 cells are resistant to RA despite partially intact RAR signaling. RA Blocks Mitogenic Effects of Estrogen in MCF-7 Cells—To further establish the anti-estrogenic effects of RA on MCF-7 cells, cell cycle kinetics were investigated. Fig. 5A depicts the cell cycle profile of ER-positive MCF-7 cells either in the continued presence of estrogen or starved of estrogen for 48 h. Estrogen starvation resulted in a decline in S-phase cells and synchronization (45 to 10% S-phase cells). Replenishing the cultures with estrogen released the cells from the G1 block such that"

Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). Structurally, GPCRs are integral membrane proteins composed of seven transmembrane helices connected by extracellular and intracellular loops, an N-terminal extracellular domain, and a C-terminal intracellular region. GPCRs are by far the most successful drug targets as evidenced by the fact that more than 50% of marketed drugs treat diseases by acting on some 20 GPCRs (2Drews J. Science. 2000; 287: 1960-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (2246) Google Scholar). Compounds that stimulate GPCRs are classified as either full agonists or partial agonists. Partial agonists are of therapeutic interest because of their low propensity to exert sideeffects and to desensitize their target (3Clark R.B. Knoll B.J. Barber R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 279-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The actions of agonists and partial agonists are initiated at the ligand binding site on the receptor. Binding sites in GPCRs are physically distant from the site of functional coupling to G proteins, which resides at the intracellular face of the GPCRs (4Schwartz T.W. Rosenkilde M.M.

In the context of this simplified two-states model for GPCRs activation, full and partial agonism may be explained by ligand induced stabilization of different receptor conformations having distinct affinities for a given G protein or distinct abilities to activate it. Alternatively, full and partial agonists may stabilize the receptor in the same active conformation, but the two types of ligands will generate quantitatively different amounts of this active receptor conformation due to their distinct intrinsic activities. The cholecystokinin-1 receptor (CCK1R) is a member of group I in the superfamily of GPCRs (12Silvente-Poirot S. Dufresne M. Vaysse N. Fourmy D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 513-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). CCK1R-mediated effects include control of gallbladder contraction, pancreatic exocrine secretion, gastric emptying and gut motility, and satiety (13Noble F. Wank S.A. Crawley J.N. Bradwejn J. Seroogy K.B. Hamon M. Roques B.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 745-781PubMed Google Scholar). Among available synthetic agonists of the CCK1R, JMV 180 is a CCK-related peptide (Fig. 1), which can act as a full agonist, a dual agonist/antagonist, or a partial agonist depending on species, tissue, or biological event considered (14Galas M.C.

Interestingly, on the contrary to CCK administered at high doses, JMV 180 does not cause acute pancreatitis in rats and can antagonize CCK-induced pancreatitis (19Saluja A.K. Saluja M. Printz H. Zavertnik A. Sengupta A. Steer M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8968-8971Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). With respect to CCK1R-mediated stimulation of inositol phosphate production, JMV 180 is a partial agonist, but the molecular mechanism, at the receptor level, underlying this partial agonism remains unknown. In the recent period, we have devoted much effort toward mapping of the human CCK1R binding site for the full agonist CCK, because we reasoned that knowledge of receptor binding site is required for the understanding of ligand action. In the current work, we investigated the molecular mechanism of JMV 180 partial agonism on the CCK1R using a multidisciplinary approach. We found that helices VI and III of the CCK1R are functionally linked through the CCK1R agonist binding site, and positioning of the C-terminal ends of peptidic agonists toward Phe330 of helix VI is responsible for the extent of phospholipase C activation through Gαq coupling. Materials—The C-terminal nonapeptide analogue (Nle)-CCK-9, (Met)-CCK-9, JMV 172, and JMV 180 were synthesized as described previously (20Moroder L. Wilschowitz L. Gemeiner M. Gohring W. Knof S.

Labeled peptides were prepared and purified as described previously (22Fourmy D. Lopez P. Poirot S. Jimenez J. Dufresne M. Moroder L. Powers S.P. Vaysse N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). CCKAR-/- mice were generated as described previously (23Kopin A.S. Mathes W.F. McBride E.W. Nguyen M. Al-Haider W. Schmitz F. Bonner-Weir S. Kanarek R. Beinborn M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Collagenase (grade) was purchased from Worthington Biochemicals (Freehold, NJ). Infinity™ amylase reagent was from Sigma Diagnostics®. All other chemicals were obtained from commercial sources. Computer Modeling—The model of the CCK1R was built as described previously (24Archer-Lahlou E. Tikhonova I. Escrieur C. Dufresne M. Seva C. Pradayrol L. Moroder L. Maigret B. Fourmy D. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 48: 180-191Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A starting conformation of the JMV 180 molecule was firstly built and refined by 10,000 steps of energy minimizations using Insight II software (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). The consistent valence forcefield was used in the Discover Accelrys molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics program. This starting conformation was next used for a simulated annealing conformational sampling using molecular dynamics in vacuo. The dielectric constant used here was a distance-dependent one to stimulate roughly the electrostatic shielding due to the solvent. The simulated annealing method used consisted of 100 loops of slow cooling, each one leading to a low energy conformer. Each loop starts by fixing the temperature to 1,000 K, followed by 5,000 molecular dynamics steps of 1 fs each. The temperature was then decreased by steps of 100 K: by decreasing the temperature this way every 5,000 molecular dynamics steps, after 40,000 steps the temperature of the system correspond to 300 K. The final conformation obtained at the end of this process was energy-refined and after storage was used to start a new simulation at 1,000 K with a slow cooling as described above. This procedure produced 100 minimized and different conformations of JMV 180. All these 100 conformers were used for the docking procedure using the GOLD algorithm (25Jones G. Willett P. Glen R.C. Leach A.R. Taylor R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 727-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (5375) Google Scholar). The “chem score” scoring function was used. GOLD ranked the conformational samples in such a way that we decided to examine only the 10 top solutions. From these 10 solutions, only 2 were found in accordance with pharmacological results (see “Results”). The two resulting complexes were submitted to annealing molecular dynamics calculations followed by energy minimization, the backbone of the receptor being first fixed. Then, all the constraints were removed excepting hydrogen bonds within helices, and finally the whole receptor-ligand complex was submitted to energy minimization. For JMV 172 and (Met)-CCK, models of the peptide and of the complexes were obtained as described here for JMV 180. The whole modeling was carried out with Accelrys software Insight II modules on a Silicon Graphics O2 station. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Transfection of COS-7 Cells—Mutant receptor cDNAs were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene) using the human CCK1R cDNAs cloned into pRFENeo vector as template. Mutations were confirmed by automated sequencing of both cDNA strands (Applied Biosystems). COS-7 cells (1.6 × 106) were plated onto 10-cm culture dishes and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. After overnight incubation, cells were transiently transfected with 0.1–0.5 μg/plate of pRFENeo vectors containing the cDNA for the wild-type or mutated CCK1R, using a modified DEAE-dextran method. Cells were transferred to 24-well plates at a density of 20,000–80,000 cells/well 24 h after transfection, depending on the transfected mutant and experiment to be performed. Membrane Preparation, Receptor Binding, and Inositol Phosphates Assays—Plasma membranes from COS-7 and from pancreatic acinar cells were prepared as described previously (26.). Both binding and inositol phosphates measurements were rigorously performed as described previously (26Escrieut C. Gigoux V. Archer E. Verrier S. Maigret B. Behrendt R. Moroder L. Bignon E. Silvente-Poirot S. Pradayrol L. Fourmy D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7546-7555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Construction of Recombinant Adenoviruses—Recombinant adenoviruses encoding the wild-type or mutant human CCK1R, or encoding the mouse Gαq subunit, were produced according to the method described previously (27He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3250) Google Scholar). Briefly, the wild-type or mutant human CCK1R cDNAs, and the mouse Gαq cDNA, were cloned into the shuttle vector pAdTrack-CMV, linearized, and co-transformed into Escherichia coli strain BJ5183 along with the adenoviral backbone vector, pAd-Easy-1. Recombinants were selected for kanamycin resistance and confirmed by restriction endonuclease analyzes. Finally, linearized recombinant plasmids were transfected into an adenovirus packaging cell line, HEK293 cells. Recombinant adenoviruses were collected 7–12 days after infection and were concentrated using a CsCl gradient. Under the control of distinct cytomegalovirus promoters, these plasmids express the protein of interest and, in parallel, green fluorescent protein. The titer of the viral stocks was estimated by green fluorescent protein assays. Viruses were stored in a 2× storage buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% BSA, and 50% glycerol, filter sterilized) at -80 °C. Preparation of Acini and Infection with Viruses—The pancreas was excised from freely feed male CCK1R -/- mice (26Escrieut C. Gigoux V. Archer E. Verrier S. Maigret B. Behrendt R. Moroder L. Bignon E. Silvente-Poirot S. Pradayrol L. Fourmy D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7546-7555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Pancreas was washed in KREBS buffer containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 115 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2 (2H2O), 4.8 mm MgSO4 (7 H2O), 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 24.5 mm HEPES, 2 mml-glutamine, 5 mm d-glucose, and essential and non-essential amino acids. The pH was adjusted to 7.4 and equilibrated with 100% O2 before use. The acini were injected with collagenase and enzymatic digestion was then achieved at 37 °C under mechanical shearing. Then, acini were wash two times by sedimentation through 0.2% BSA in KREBS buffer, and acini of medium size were selected. Finally, acini were purified two times by sedimentation through 1% BSA in KREBS buffer. The acini of CCK1R -/- mice suspended in KREBS buffer 1% BSA were infected with virus encoding human CCK1R wild type or M121V-CCK1R mutant. All viruses were used at ∼107 plaque-forming units/mg of protein. Virus was added to acini in 2 ml of Krebs buffer for 10 min. The acini were then diluted with KREBS to 10 ml, transferred to 100-mm dishes, and incubated 4 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Analysis of Amylase Secretion and Pancreatic Acinar Cells Morphology—Infected acini were washed and resuspended in KREBS buffer containing 1% BSA at ∼1 mg/ml. Aliquots of 2 ml were incubated with an increasing concentration of CCK or JMV 180 for amylase assay and with a high concentration of CCK (10-6m) or JMV 180 (3 × 10-5m) for morphology studies, at 37 °C for 30 min, under gently shearing. Incubation was terminated by centrifugation of aliquots for 1 min at 400 rpm. The concentration of amylase in the medium was measured using Infinity™ amylase reagent (Sigma Diagnostics®). Results were expressed as percentage of maximal amylase release. For morphological studies, acinar pellets were fixed 20 h in 100% alcohol, 40% formaldehyde, and 17 m acetic acid (75/25/25), embedded in paraffin, hematoxylin and eosin stained, and visualized by optic microscopy. JMV 180, a High Affinity Agonist of the CCK1R with a Low Intrinsic Activity—In COS-7 cells expressing the human CCK1R receptor, (Nle)-CCK and (Met)-CCK (Fig. 1) indistinguishably stimulated production of inositol phosphates with a potency (ED50), of 0.42 ± 0.10 nm and a maximal stimulation of 15- to 25-fold the basal value (Fig. 2). In the same cells, JMV 180-induced production of inositol phosphates reached a maximum (efficacy) representing 9.3 ± 1.1% of that achieved by (Nle)-CCK, the ED50 being 17.8 ± 6.3 nm. On the other hand, non-sulfated CCK, which is known to bind to the CCK1R with 500-fold lower affinity than sulfated CCK, stimulated inositol phosphate formation with a very weak potency (ED50: 215 ± 18 nm) but an efficacy that represented 75% of that of CCK (Fig. 2). Partial agonism of JMV 180 in COS-7 cells was maintained at its value of efficacy for expression levels of CCK1R ranging from 2 to 6.8 pmol/106 cells (not illustrated), indicating that partial agonism was independent of expression ratio between CCK1R and its intracellular effectors. Thus, partial agonism of JMV 180 to stimulate inositol phosphate formation appears to be due to its weak intrinsic activity. Identification of CCK1R Residues Involved in the JMV 180 Binding Site—We postulated that the weak intrinsic activity of JMV 180 should be due to the inability of this compound to interact with some amino acids of the CCK1R binding site playing a key role in the activation process. On the other hand, JMV 180 displays a strong structural homology with CCK (Fig. 1), suggesting that binding sites for JMV 180 and CCK are likely overlapping. We therefore tested the effect of mutation of residues previously shown to be part of CCK1R binding site, on molecular recognition of JMV 180. Amino acids of the CCK1R binding site for CCK are shown on the serpentine representation of the CCK1R (Fig. 3). Binding studies with labeled JMV 180 allowed identification of three main categories of mutants (Table I). A first series of CCK1R mutants bound [3H]JMV 180 with identical or very similar affinities to the wild-type CCK1R (WT-CCK1R) (0.2 < Fmut < 5, Table I); these were W39A, Q40N, L50F, L53A, C94L, M121A, M121Q, M121V, V125A, F218A, W326A, W326F, I329A, I329F, F330A, N333A, L356A, and Y360F. On the other hand, I352A mutant bound [3H]JMV 180 with a 18-fold decreased affinity compared with the WT-CCK1R. The third set of mutants, F107A, M195L, R197M, and R336M, did not bind [3H]JMV 180. These mutants were previously shown to respond to CCK with strong drops of potency as the mutated residues are involved in CCK1R binding site (Table II) (26Escrieut C. Gigoux V. Archer E. Verrier S.

Bouisson M. Fehrentz J.A. Moroder L. Gully D. Martinez J. Vaysse N. Fourmy A.D. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2347-2354PubMed Google Scholar). Owing to structural homology between JMV 180 and CCK, defective or decreased [3H]JMV 180 binding to mutants F107A, M195L, R197M, R336M, and I352A can be interpreted as an involvement of those residues in the binding site of JMV 180. Additional experiments to evaluate contribution of these residues to recognition of JMV 180 were performed, by measuring inositol phosphate production induced by the mutants in response to JMV 180. However, most of the mutants did not produce sufficient amounts of inositol phosphates to allow accurate analysis (not illustrated). As a partial agonist, JMV 180 was able to inhibit CCK1R stimulations by the full agonist CCK. We took advantage of this behavior to evaluate contribution of mutated amino acids to recognition of JMV 180, by measuring potency of JMV 180 to competitively inhibit CCK-induced production of inositol phosphates on mutants. Inhibition curves indicated that JMV 180 was 15.9-, 20.4-, 127.3-, 124.7-, and 9.5-fold less potent to inhibit CCK-induced formation of inositol phosphates on mutants F107A, M195L, R197M, R336M, and I352A than on the WT-CCK1R, respectively (Fig. 4 and Table II). The Fmut values show that some residues subjected to mutation are similarly involved in recognition of CCK and JMV 180, others are differentially involved, and some are involved in activity of CCK but not in that of JMV 180. This supports partial overlapping of the binding sites of the two peptides and also reflects different chemical structures of the two ligands. All these results indicate that residues Phe107, Met195, Arg197, Arg336, and Ile352 are part of the CCK1R binding site for JMV 180.Table IEffects of CCK1R mutations on JMV 180 binding Binding properties of mutated CCK1R were determined using the peptide radioligand [3H]JMV 180.

https://openalex.org/W2171088617,"To evade the immune system, the etiologic agent of plague, Yersinia pestis, injects an exceptionally active tyrosine phosphatase called YopH into host cells using a type III secretion system. We recently reported that YopH acutely inhibits T cell antigen receptor signaling by dephosphorylating the Lck tyrosine kinase. Here, we show that prolonged presence of YopH in primary T cells or Jurkat T leukemia cells causes apoptosis, detected by annexin V binding, mitochondrial breakdown, caspase activation, and internucleosomal fragmentation. YopH also causes cell death when expressed in HeLa cells, and this cell death was inhibited by YopH-specific small molecule inhibitors. Cell death induced by YopH was also prevented by caspase inhibition or co-expression of Bcl-xL. We conclude that YopH not only paralyzes T cells acutely, but also ensures that the cells will not recover to induce a protective immune response but instead undergo mitochondrially regulated programmed cell death. To evade the immune system, the etiologic agent of plague, Yersinia pestis, injects an exceptionally active tyrosine phosphatase called YopH into host cells using a type III secretion system. We recently reported that YopH acutely inhibits T cell antigen receptor signaling by dephosphorylating the Lck tyrosine kinase. Here, we show that prolonged presence of YopH in primary T cells or Jurkat T leukemia cells causes apoptosis, detected by annexin V binding, mitochondrial breakdown, caspase activation, and internucleosomal fragmentation. YopH also causes cell death when expressed in HeLa cells, and this cell death was inhibited by YopH-specific small molecule inhibitors. Cell death induced by YopH was also prevented by caspase inhibition or co-expression of Bcl-xL. We conclude that YopH not only paralyzes T cells acutely, but also ensures that the cells will not recover to induce a protective immune response but instead undergo mitochondrially regulated programmed cell death. In historical times, the plague-causing bacterium Yersinia pestis has caused social devastation on a scale unmatched by any other infectious disease, with over 200 million human deaths (1Hinnebusch B.J. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 2Titball R.W. Leary S.E. Br. Med. J. 1998; 54: 625-633Google Scholar). Although this fatal bacterium is virtually eradicated and is effectively treated with antibiotic therapy, the rapidly fatal course of pneumonic plague, potential for secondary spread of infection, and developed capacity for massive aerosol distribution have made Y. pestis a feared biological weapon of terror (3Inglesby T.V.

Thus, there exists a need for elucidation of the molecular mechanisms by which Y. pestis evades the immune system and causes the death of its host. In addition, targeting essential virulence factors therapeutically may prove useful in treating a potentially large outbreak of Y. pestis.A 70-kb virulence plasmid, pYV, enables Y. pestis to survive and multiply in the lymphoid tissues of the host (4Cornelis G.R.

Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2002; 291: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Most of the Yops fall into one of two groups. One group consists of intracellular effectors (YopE, YopH, YpkA/YopO, YopP/YopJ, YopM, and YopT), whereas the others (YopB, YopD, and LcrV) form the secretion apparatus that is displayed at the bacterial surface (6Cornelis G.R.

It has a C-terminal catalytic domain and a multifunctional N-terminal domain that binds tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins to target YopH to hot spots of signal transduction (12Persson C. Nordfelth R.

Injection of YopH into phagocytic cell types results in disruption of focal adhesions and inhibition of integrin-mediated bacterial phagocytosis (14Andersson K. Carballeira N. Magnusson K.E.

Microbiol. 2000; 2: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). YopH also prevents integrin-mediated responses in affected phagocytes, such as tumor necrosis factor-α release and oxidative burst (17Aepfelbacher M. Zumbihl R. Ruckdeschel K. Jacobi C.A. Barz C.

Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 972-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The development of an adaptive immune response is also blocked through suppression of T and B lymphocyte activation in a YopH-dependent manner (19Yao T. Mecsas J. Healy J.I. Falkow S. Chien Y. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1343-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that YopH inhibits the activation of T lymphocytes by dephosphorylating the Lck tyrosine kinase at Tyr-394, resulting in a complete loss of its catalytic activity (20Alonso A. Bottini N. Bruckner S. Rahmouni S. Williams S. Schoenberger S.P. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4922-4928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Clearly, YopH is an essential effector protein involved in the virulence of Yersinia, and therapeutically targeting YopH may prove useful in combating a potential outbreak.Here, we report that YopH induces apoptosis as measured by annexin V binding, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase activation, and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation.

Interestingly, co-expression of Bcl-xL with YopH prevents the induction of cell death, caspase activity, and DNA degradation. YopH also causes cell death when expressed in HeLa cells, and YopH-specific small molecule inhibitors blocked this effect but not cell death induced by other stimuli. These data are the first to show a new role for YopH: induction of mitochondrially dependent apoptosis. Taken together with previous findings, we conclude that the actions of YopH in T cells are two-fold: (a) initially acting to paralyze T cells, resulting in immediate inhibition of the adaptive immune response, and (b) actively causing apoptosis, thus efficiently blocking T cell recovery, resulting in long term inhibition of the immune response.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmids and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The expression plasmids for YopH and the catalytically inactive YopH-D356A in the pEF5HA eukaryotic expression vector, which adds a 9-amino-acid hemagglutinin epitope to the N terminus of the insert, were as before (20Alonso A.

The cDNA encoding Bcl-xL and dominant negative caspase-9 were in the pcDNA3 expression vector.Cells and Cell Treatments—Normal T lymphocytes were isolated from venous blood of healthy volunteers by Ficoll gradient centrifugation. Monocytes/macrophages were eliminated by adherence to plastic for 1 h at 37 °C. Jurkat T leukemia cells were kept at logarithmic growth in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, non-essential amino acids, and 100 units/ml each of penicillin G and streptomycin. Transfections were done by electroporation as described previously (21Alonso A. Rahmouni S. Williams S. van Stipdonk M. Jaroszewski L. Godzik A. Abraham R.T. Schoenberger S.P. Mustelin T. Nat.

HeLaS cells were maintained at logarithmic growth in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml each of penicillin G and streptomycin. HeLaS cells were transfected with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. ANT-YopH and ANT-YopH-D356A proteins were induced in transformed Escherichia coli and purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid. Both proteins were of equal high purity. They were added at 6 μm to cells in RPMI medium at 37 °C. BAF (caspase inhibitor III, Calbiochem) was added at a concentration of 10 μm immediately after transfection.YopH Inhibitors—For Jurkat and HeLa cell treatments, LTY11, LTY9, and LTY61 were added at 36 or 48 μm after transfection of YopH was completed.Cell Death Assays—The percentage of cell death was determined by using trypan blue (Invitrogen) exclusion. 48 h after transfection, cells were diluted 50:50 (v/v) in 0.4% trypan blue in phosphate-buffered saline and viewed under a microscope, and total cell number as well as the number of trypan blue-positive (dead) cells were counted in four fields of view using a hemacytometer. The annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (BioVision Research Products, Mountain View, CA) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol, and cells were analyzed on a BD Biosciences FACSort. Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was determined using the nucleosome enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Oncogene Research Products, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Mitochondrial integrity assays were performed by staining 106 cells with 10 μg/ml 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1) for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. The cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently analyzed on a BD Biosciences FACSort.Caspase Assays—Caspase activity was measured as described previously (24Denault J.B. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34042-34050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 25Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 91-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 106 cells were lysed in 50 μl of modified radio-immune precipitation buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate) and left on ice for 15 min, and centrifugation was done at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Protein concentration was determined using the Pierce BCA protein assay according to the manufacturer's protocol with bovine serum albumin as standard. Total caspase activity was measured using 100 μm Ac-DEVD-AFC (Enzyme Systems Products, Aurora, OH) in caspase buffer (10 mm Pipes, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 10% sucrose, 0.1% Chaps, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm dithiothreitol). Amidolytic activity was measured on an f-max Molecular Device spectrofluorometer at 37 °C (excitation, λ = 405 nm; emission, λ = 510 nm). A CaspACE™ FITC-VAD-fmk in situ marker (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to stain active caspases at a concentration of 10 μm for 10 min in the dark, and the cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline and analyzed on a BD Biosciences FACSort.Data Analysis and Statistics—Data collected by FACS were analyzed with FlowJo for Windows v5.0 (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR). Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism v4.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). All experiments were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni posttests.RESULTSYopH Induces Apoptosis in Jurkat T Cells—In preliminary transfection experiments with Jurkat T cells and normal human T lymphocytes, we observed that the number of YopH-positive cells in many experiments was much lower than the number of cells expressing the catalytically inactive YopH-D356A or a control protein (e.g. GFP). This phenomenon was particularly evident at 48 or 72 h after transfection and was more prominent with normal human T lymphocytes when compared with Jurkat. The inequality of YopH-versus YopH-D356A-positive cell numbers between samples was abolished by the inclusion of Z-VAD-fmk, a polycaspase inhibitor, in the culture medium (data not shown). This observation led us to ask whether YopH expression results in caspase activation and subsequent apoptosis in T cells. To test this notion, we transfected Jurkat with the empty pEF5HA vector, wild-type YopH, or the catalytically inactive mutant YopH-D356A and analyzed the cells at 24 h after transfection by staining with FITC-annexin V and propidium iodide. This method of analysis reveals two important aspects of cell death: (i) phosphatidylserine exposure on the extracellular face of the plasma membrane by FITC-annexin V binding and (ii) loss of plasma membrane integrity, resulting in entry of propidium iodide into the cells. YopH caused a significant increase in the percentage of cells double-positive for annexin V and propidium iodide (Fig. 1, A and C). This population of cells represents either late stage apoptosis or necrosis. YopH also increased single-positive cells for annexin V, which corresponds to apoptotic cells that have not yet lost outer membrane integrity but have lost phosphatidylserine asymmetry (Fig. 1, A and B). The cells expressing YopH first go through the annexin V single-positive stage and then proceed to the late stages of apoptosis and become positive for propidium iodide as well, thus accumulating in the double-positive population. Also, cells co-transfected with YopH and GFP and then analyzed by flow cytometry at 24 h (Table I) showed that fewer cells were alive in the YopH-transfected population, fewer GFP-expressing cells remained, and many more of the green fluorescent protein-positive cells were also annexin V-positive. The catalytically inactive (but substrate-binding) YopH-D356A mutant had a small (and not significant) effect when compared with vector controls in this and some other experiments. Thus, the catalytic activity of YopH is essential for its ability to induce apoptosis.Table IDeath of Jurkat T cells co-transfected with YopH and GFPLive cellsaThe percentage of live cells was determined by flow cytometry using forward and side scatter gating for live versus dead cells.GFP+bThe percentage of GFP-positive cells was determined by flow cytometry using untransfected cells as a negative control.GFP+, annexin+cThe percentage of Annexin-positive cells was determined by flow cytometry using Alexa Fluor594-conjugated annexin V.GFP8854.725.5YopH + GFP36.223.451.9YopH-DA + GFP76.639.143.2a The percentage of live cells was determined by flow cytometry using forward and side scatter gating for live versus dead cells.b The percentage of GFP-positive cells was determined by flow cytometry using untransfected cells as a negative control.c The percentage of Annexin-positive cells was determined by flow cytometry using Alexa Fluor594-conjugated annexin V. Open table in a new tab YopH-induced Cell Death Is Blocked by a Specific Small Molecule Inhibitor—To directly test whether the catalytic activity of YopH is essential for its ability to induce cell death, we transfected Jurkat cells with YopH and then treated the cells with the specific YopH inhibitors, LTY11 and LTY9, generated in our laboratory. 2Tautz, L., Bruckner, S., Sareth, S., Alonso, A., Bogetz, J., Bottini, N., Pellecchia, M., and Mustelin, T. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 9400–9408. Both are membrane-permeable competitive small molecule inhibitors that specifically block the enzymatic activity of YopH with Ki values of 143 and 208 nm, respectively, using the general tyrosine phosphatase substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate in an in vitro assay. Jurkat cells were transfected with YopH and then kept in culture in the presence of LTY11 or LTY9, which largely (but not completely) abolished the ability of YopH to cause cell death (Fig. 1D). In the absence of YopH, these inhibitors did not affect cell death. We also used HeLa cells, which typically have higher transfection efficiencies and lower levels of background cell death when compared with Jurkat cells. Expression of YopH caused a highly significant increase in the amount of cell death when compared with empty vector (Fig. 1D), and this cell death was completely prevented by YopH inhibitors LTY11 and LTY61 (Fig. 1E). In contrast, cell death induced by etoposide was not affected at all by these YopH inhibitors. Together, all these results show that YopH is a potent activator of cell death in both T cells and the non-hematopoietic HeLa cell line. More importantly, treatment of cells with a specific small molecule inhibitor of YopH completely blocks the death induced by YopH. This finding provides a first proof of the concept that the essential virulence factor of Y. Pestis, YopH, may be a viable target for treatment of infection.YopH Activates Caspases—To directly measure whether YopH expression resulted in caspase activation, Jurkat cells were transfected with empty vector, wild-type YopH, YopH-D356A, or PTEN (as positive control) and subjected to in vitro caspase activity assays 48 h later, which showed that YopH caused a significant 3-fold increase in caspase activity when compared with vector control cells (Fig. 2A). Importantly, caspase activity in cells transfected with the catalytically inactive mutant of YopH was indistinguishable from vector-transfected control cells, whereas PTEN induced a 5-fold activation of caspases. We conclude that YopH activates caspases in a manner that is dependent upon its catalytic activity.Fig. 2Caspase activation by YopH. A, Jurkat T cells were transiently transfected with 10 μg of the indicated expression plasmids. Caspase activity was measured 48 h after transfection by analyzing the relative fluorescence units generated as a result of Ac-DEVD-AFC cleavage and then normalized for protein concentration. YopH significantly increased the in vitro caspase activity of Jurkat cells (p < 0.001, n = 2). B, JCaM1 cells were transiently transfected with 10 μg of the indicated expression plasmids. Caspase activity was measured 48 h after transfection by analyzing the relative fluorescence units generated as a result of Ac-DEVD-AFC cleavage normalized for protein concentration. C, normal human T lymphocytes were treated with 6 μm of the indicated fusion protein, an equal volume of buffer, or 10 μm etoposide. Caspase activity was measured 24 h after treatment. YopH significantly increased the in vitro caspase activity of Jurkat cells (p < 0.01, n = 2). PBL, peripheral blood leukocytes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We have previously shown that the tyrosine kinase Lck is a target of YopH that accounts for its ability to inhibit T cell receptor signal transduction (20Alonso A. Bottini N. Bruckner S. Rahmouni S. Williams S. Schoenberger S.P. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4922-4928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To test whether Lck was important for the ability of YopH to induce caspase activation, we transfected the Lck-deficient Jurkat cell line JCaM1 with empty vector, wild-type YopH, or YopH-D356A and assayed in vitro caspase activity 48 h later. YopH did not cause caspase activation in this Lck-deficient cell line (Fig. 2B), whereas PTEN did. We conclude that YopH may well reduce T cell survival because it reduces basal Lck phosphorylation at Tyr-394 (20Alonso A. Bottini N. Bruckner S. Rahmouni S. Williams S. Schoenberger S.P. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4922-4928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). If so, JCaM1 cells survive in the absence of Lck because additional mutations have uncoupled Lck from caspase activation or because of other alterations in the machinery for apoptosis. The induction of cell death in HeLa cells by YopH may be related to the dephosphorylation of other Src family kinases and perhaps other tyrosine kinases involved in survival of cells.To better mimic the scenario in a lymph node of an infected patient, where the bacteria inject YopH protein directly into the cytoplasm of T lymphocytes, we incubated freshly isolated peripheral blood leukocytes (>80% T lymphocytes) with negative control buffer, the membrane-permeable fusion protein ANT-YopH (20Alonso A. Bottini N. Bruckner S. Rahmouni S. Williams S. Schoenberger S.P. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4922-4928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), or etoposide as positive control for 24 h and then analyzed in vitro caspase activity. In normal T lymphocytes, ANT-YopH induced a very high level of caspase activity when compared with mock control (Fig. 2C). When compared with etoposide-treated cells, which typically have very high levels of caspase activity, ANT-YopH induced a higher increase in caspase activity. These data show that YopH is a very potent inducer of caspase activation in normal human T lymphocytes.YopH Causes Loss of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—An important event associated with the transduction of many apoptotic signals is the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential caused by translocation of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members to the outer mitochondrial membrane. These proapoptotic molecules, such as Bax, form pores in the membrane, causing breakdown of the membrane potential and release of other proapoptotic molecules from the intermembrane space (26Thornberry N.A. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: R97-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Therefore, to test the hypothesis that YopH expression would result in loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, we transfected Jurkat cells with empty vector, YopH, or YopH-D356A and measured mitochondrial membrane potential 24 h later by using JC-1 staining. JC-1 is a lipophilic cation that forms orange fluorescent aggregates in intact mitochondria of healthy cells. In apoptotic cells where mitochondrial membrane potential has collapsed, JC-1 remains in the cytoplasm in its monomeric green fluorescent form. Cells are then easily distinguished as having lost their mitochondrial membrane potential by FACS analysis. Fig. 3 reveals that YopH caused a significant decrease in the number of cells with intact mitochondrial membrane potential, whereas YopH-D356A did not (Fig. 3, A–C). These data indicate that expression of YopH results in mitochondrial membrane potential breakdown in a manner that is dependent upon its catalytic activity.Fig. 3YopH causes mitochondrial breakdown. Jurkat T cells were transiently transfected with 10 μg of the indicated expression plasmids; 24 h later, the cells were stained with JC-1 and analyzed by FACS. A, representative digital images of vector-transfected control, wild-type YopH, and YopH-D356A. B, representative dot plots of vector-transfected control, wild-type YopH, and YopH-D356A. Cells with intact mitochondria are positive for both FL-1 and FL-2 channels, whereas cells with no remaining intact mitochondria will lose FL-2. C, results from four independent transfections are represented graphically. YopH significantly reduces the number of cells with intact mitochondria (p < 0.05, n = 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)YopH-induced Cell Death Is Mitochondrially Mediated— Members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins are critical regulators of apoptosis via control of mitochondrial outer membrane characteristics. Bcl-xL, an anti-apoptotic member of this family, is able to counteract the effects of the pro-apoptotic members that are responsible for the mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and eventual cell death (27Chinnaiyan A.M. Orth K. O'Rourke K. Duan H. Poirier G.G. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4573-4576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). To test whether YopH induction of caspase activity was mitochondrially mediated, we co-transfected Bcl-xL with YopH and determined the percentage of cells with activated caspases as measured by FACS analysis of FITC-VAD-fmk-stained cells. We found that YopH caused an increase in cells positive for active caspases (Fig. 4A). More importantly, expression of Bcl-xL blocked this increase. These data implicate mitochondria as a key regulator involved in the activation of caspases in response to YopH expression.Fig. 4YopH-induced cell death is blocked by Bcl-xL and BAF. Jurkat T cells were transiently transfected with 10 μg of the indicated expression plasmids. A, the mean percentage of cells with active caspases was determined 48 h after transfection by staining with CaspACE, an irreversible FITC-conjugated caspase inhibitor, and detected using FACS. Cells with active caspases are positive for FITC in the FL-1 channel. B, 48 h later, the cells were diluted 50:50 (v/v) in 0.4% trypan blue, and total cell number was determined. Cells were counted as dead if they were positive for trypan blue. BAF was present at 10 μm in the indicated sample. C, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was determined at 48 h with a nucleosome enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. Data are expressed as mean absorbance (Abs) at 450 nm ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, we tested whether Bcl-xL could also prevent cell death induced by YopH. Although catalytically active YopH expression induced about a 2-fold increase in the percentage of dead cells, as measured by trypan blue exclusion (Fig. 4B), co-expression of Bcl-xL blocked this effect of YopH. We also demonstrate that caspase activity is required for YopH-induced cell death as the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor BAF completely blocked the effect of YopH. We conclude from these data that the cell death induced by catalytically active YopH involves an obligatory mitochondrial step and requires caspase activity.YopH Induces Internucleosomal Fragmentation—A typical late stage characteristic of apoptosis is"

We show that both residues are involved in the binding of the reducing nicotinamide coenzyme NADH and also the binding of the oxidizing substrates 2-cyclohexen-1-one and 1-nitrocyclohexene. Reduction of 2-cyclohexen-1-one by FMNH2 is concerted with proton transfer from an unknown proton donor in the active site. NMR spectroscopy and flavin reoxidation studies with 2-cyclohexen-1-one are consistent with His-186 being unprotonated in oxidized, reduced, and ligand-bound MR, suggesting that His-186 is not the key proton donor required for the reduction of 2-cyclohexen-1-one. Hydride transfer is decoupled from proton transfer with 1-nitrocyclohexene as oxidizing substrate, and unlike with OYE1 the intermediate nitronate species produced after hydride transfer from FMNH2 is not converted to 1-nitrocyclohexane. The work highlights key mechanistic differences in the reactions catalyzed by MR and OYE1 and emphasizes the need for caution in inferring mechanistic similarities in structurally related proteins. Morphinone reductase (MR) catalyzes the NADH-dependent reduction of α/β unsaturated carbonyl compounds in a reaction similar to that catalyzed by Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE1).

MR is a dimeric flavoenzyme of Mr 82,200 containing a single FMN/enzyme subunit (1French C.E. Bruce N.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Based on sequence similarity studies it belongs to the class I flavin-dependent β/α barrel oxidoreductases, also known as the Old Yellow Enzyme family (1French C.E. Bruce N.C. Biochem.

These latter enzymes utilize diverse substrates, but the catalytic framework has clearly evolved from a common progenitor (2Scrutton N.S.

The products of the reactions catalyzed by MR with morphinone and codeinone substrates are hydromorphone and hydrocodone, respectively. These products are valuable semisynthetic opiate drugs. Hydromorphone is a powerful analgesic (seven times more potent than morphine (20Stanski D.R. Roizen M.F. Melmon K.L. Morrelli H.F. Hoffman B.B. Nierenberg D.W. Clinical Pharmacology: Basic Principles in Therapeutics. 3rd Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1992: 721-737Google Scholar)), and hydrocodone is a mild analgesic and antitussive (21Moffat A. Jackson J. Moss M. Widdop B. Clarke's Isolation and Identification of Drugs. The Pharmaceutical Press, London1986Google Scholar). The synthesis of both compounds is complicated because of difficulty in specifically oxidizing the C-6 hydroxy group of morphine and the often limiting supply of thebaine (a precursor for the synthesis of hydrocodone). A desire to find alternative routes to their synthesis has led to the development of novel recombinant biocatalytic routes for hydromorphone and hydrocodone synthesis (22Bruce N. French C. Hailes A. Long M. Rathbone D. Trends Biotechnol. 1995; 13: 200-205Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Biological synthesis exploits the ability of Escherichia coli transformed with the genes encoding MR and morphine dehydrogenase and fed with morphine or codeine to accumulate hydromorphone and hydrocodone, respectively (23French C.E. Hailes A.M. Rathbone D.A. Long M.T. Willey D.L. Bruce N.C. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 674-676PubMed Google Scholar, 24Willey D.L. Caswell D.A. Lowe C.R. Bruce N.C. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of MR has been determined at 2.2 Å resolution in complex with the oxidizing substrate codeinone (17Barna T. Messiha H.L. Petosa C. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Moody P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30976-30983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The structure reveals a dimeric enzyme comprising two 8-fold β/α barrel domains, each bound to FMN. The active site structures of MR, OYE1, and PETN reductase are highly conserved, reflecting the ability of these enzymes to catalyze “generic” reactions such as the reduction of 2-cyclohexen-1-one (25Williams R.E. Rathbone D.A. Scrutton N.S. Bruce N.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 3566-3574Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The active site acid identified in OYE1 (Tyr-196), and conserved in PETN reductase (Tyr-186), is replaced by Cys-191 in MR, but Cys-191 does not act as a crucial acid in the mechanism of reduction of the olefinic bond found in 2-cyclohexen-1-one and codeinone (17Barna T. Messiha H.L. Petosa C. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Moody P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30976-30983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The mechanism of flavin reduction and oxidation in MR has been studied by stopped-flow and steady-state kinetic methods (26Craig D.H. Moody P.C.E. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7598-7607Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 27Basran J. Harris R.J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43973-43982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Recent studies of the temperature dependence of the primary kinetic isotope effect for flavin reduction in MR by nicotinamide coenzyme indicates that quantum mechanical tunneling plays a major role in hydride transfer (27Basran J. Harris R.J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43973-43982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The oxidative half-reaction of MR is fully rate-limiting in steady-state turnover with the substrate 2-cyclohexen-1-one and NADH at saturating concentrations (27Basran J. Harris R.J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43973-43982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The kinetic isotope effect studies for hydride transfer from reduced flavin to the α/β unsaturated bond of 2-cyclohexen-1-one are again consistent with transfer by quantum mechanical tunneling. Additionally, a large solvent isotope effect accompanies the oxidative half-reaction, and double isotope effects indicate that hydride transfer from the flavin N5 atom to 2-cyclohexen-1-one, and the protonation of 2-cyclohexen-1-one, are concerted (27Basran J. Harris R.J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43973-43982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The source of the proton in the reduction of 2-cyclohexen-1-one by MR is uncertain. In OYE1, Tyr-196 performs this role (28Kohli R.M. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32763-32770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), but this residue is not conserved in MR (17Barna T. Messiha H.L. Petosa C. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Moody P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30976-30983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this study we report the isolation and detailed properties of two mutant forms of MR altered at residues His-186 and Asn-189 which have provided new information on the mechanism of the reductive and oxidative half-reactions in MR. Specifically, we demonstrate that (i) both residues are key determinants for the binding of coenzyme and α/β unsaturated carbonyl compounds; (ii) His-186 is unprotonated in oxidized, reduced, and ligand-bound enzyme, thus ruling out a role as the key proton donor in the oxidative half-reaction of the enzyme; and (iii) hydride transfer can be decoupled from proton transfer using the alternative substrate 1-nitrocyclohexene. The work highlights important mechanistic features of MR in its reaction with reducing coenzyme and α/β unsaturated carbonyl compounds and also major differences in reaction chemistry compared with those reactions catalyzed by OYE1. Materials—All materials were analytical grade. Mimetic Yellow 2 affinity chromatography resin was from Affinity Chromatography Ltd. Q-Sepharose resin was from Amersham Biosciences. Protein Purification and Mutagenesis—Wild-type MR was purified from a recombinant strain of E. coli expressing the enzyme from the cloned morB gene as described previously (17Barna T. Messiha H.L. Petosa C. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Moody P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30976-30983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 29French C.E. Bruce N.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). MR mutant enzymes H186A and N189A did not bind to the affinity column (Mimitec Yellow 2) and were purified using Q-Sepharose resin only, using conditions described previously (17Barna T. Messiha H.L. Petosa C. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Moody P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30976-30983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The mutant MR enzymes were isolated using the QuikChange mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene) and the plasmid template pMORB3 (1French C.E. Bruce N.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The mutant genes were sequenced completely to ensure that spurious changes had not arisen during the mutagenesis reaction. Kinetic Studies—All kinetic studies were performed under strict anaerobic conditions (<5 ppm O2) within a glove box environment (Belle Technology) to prevent oxidase activity of MR. Steady-state assays were performed using a Jasco V-530 spectrophotometer at 25 °C. Reaction buffer was 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, which was made anaerobic by bubbling with humidified Pureshield argon at 5 psi for 2 h prior to introduction into the glove box. NADH solutions were made from preweighed powder and anaerobic buffer inside the glove box and the concentration determined spectrophotometrically (ϵ340 = 6,220 m-1 cm-1). Solutions of 2-cyclohexen-1-one were made by dilution of a 10 m stock into anaerobic buffer. The initial velocity in steady-state assays was determined from absorbance changes at 340 nm in a reaction cell volume of 1 ml; the desired concentration of substrate and coenzyme solutions was achieved by making microliter additions to the cell. Least squares fitting procedures to the standard Michaelis-Menten equation were performed using Origin (version 6) software (Microcal). Stopped-flow kinetic experiments were performed under anaerobic conditions using an Applied Photophysics SX.17MV stopped-flow instrument and transients analyzed using nonlinear least squares regression using Spectrakinetics software (Applied Photophysics). Averages of five to seven individual transients were analyzed. Enzyme was contained in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. In the reductive half-reaction, 20 μm enzyme was mixed with NADH at different concentrations (at least >5-fold the enzyme concentration to ensure pseudofirst order conditions). Flavin reduction was monitored at 462 nm; formation and decay of the enzyme-NADH charge-transfer species were monitored at 552 nm (26Craig D.H. Moody P.C.E. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7598-7607Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In studies of the oxidative half-reaction, MR was titrated with sodium dithionite to produce the two-electron-reduced form of MR. Reduced 20 μm MR was then mixed with 2-cyclohexen-1-one or 1-nitrocyclohexene at different concentrations, and flavin oxidation was monitored at 462 nm. Equations used to analyze the reductive and oxidative half-reactions have been described elsewhere (26Craig D.H. Moody P.C.E. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7598-7607Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In pH dependence studies of the oxidative half-reaction, stopped-flow studies were performed in 55 mm MES, 25 mm Tris, and 25 mm ethanolamine, which allows changes in pH without changing the ionic strength (30Ellis K. Morrison J. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Multiple wavelength studies were performed using XSCAN software (Applied Photophysics), and data were analyzed using Prokin software (Applied Photophysics). Ligand Binding Studies—Ligand binding studies were performed for wild-type MR and the N189A and H186A mutant enzymes. For each enzyme, 10 μm enzyme was titrated with progesterone (2 mm and 10 mm stock solutions) in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 25 °C in a 1-ml quartz cuvette, and the absorption spectra of the enzyme were measured after each titration using a Jasco V-550 spectrophotometer until no significant absorbance changes were detected. Readings were monitored at a wavelength where the progesterone and the enzyme had little or no absorbance (at λ = 518 nm), and the absorbance of the free enzyme at λ = 518 nm was subtracted from the individual data for each ligand concentration. The change in absorbance (ΔA) at λ = 518 nm was analyzed as a function of progesterone concentration, and the data were fitted to the quadratic equation (Equation 1) where the dissociation constant (Kd) of the enzyme-ligand complex was calculated. ΔA=ΔAm⋅(([L]T+[E]T+Kd)−((([L]T+[E]T+Kd)2)+4⋅[L]T⋅[E]T)0.5)/(2⋅[E]T)(Eq. 1) ΔAM is the maximum absorbance change, [L]T is the total ligand concentration, [E]T is the total concentration of binding sites, and Kd is the dissociation constant. Redox Potentiometry—Redox titrations were performed at 25 ± 2 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, in a Belle Technology glove box under anaerobic conditions. Enzyme solutions (60- 80 μm in ∼10 ml of titration buffer) were electrochemically titrated according to the method of Dutton (31Dutton P. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar) using sodium dithionite as reductant and potassium ferricyanide as oxidant. Mediators were added to facilitate electrical communication between the enzyme and the electrode, prior to titration. 5 μm 2-hydroxy-1,4-napthaquinone, 2 μm phenazine methosulfate, 1 μm methyl viologen, and 1 μm benzyl viologen were included in the titration to mediate in the range between +100 and -480 mV. The electrochemical potential of the enzyme solutions was measured using a Hanna pH 211 meter coupled to a platinum/calomel electrode (ThermoRussell Ltd.) that had been calibrated previously using the Fe3+/Fe2+ EDTA couple as a standard (+108 mV). The calomel electrode was corrected by +244 ± 2 mV relative to the standard hydrogen electrode. The electrode was allowed to stabilize between each addition of reductant or oxidant, and spectra (300–700 nm) were recorded using a Cary 50 Probe UV-visible scanning spectrophotometer. The spectra of at least 30–40 points across a whole range of redox potentials during the process of reduction and oxidation were recorded. Titrations were performed over 5–7-h period; equilibration was achieved throughout the titrations, and no hysteretic behavior was observed. Corrections were made for small amounts of protein evaporation during titrations as described (32Craig D.H. Barna T. Moody P.C. Bruce N.C. Chapman S.K. Munro A.W. Scrutton N.S. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Plots of the absorbance against redox potential were analyzed by extension of the Nernst equation and the Beer-Lambert law using Equation 2, A462=(a b10(E12−E/29.5))1+10(E12−E)/29.5(Eq. 2) where A462 is the absorbance value at 462 nm at the electrode potential E, and a, b are the absorbance values of the fully oxidized and reduced enzyme at 462 nm, respectively. E12 is the midpoint potential. Data manipulation and analysis were performed using Grafit software package version 5.0. All redox potentials are given relative to the standard hydrogen electrode. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy—For NMR spectroscopy, wild-type and H186A enzymes were grown in modified 2M9 medium. 15N-Labeled enzyme and partially deuterated 15N-labeled (85% deuterated) samples were prepared. For NMR studies, the purified enzymes were filtered and eluted twice through an NAP-5 column (Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated previously with deuterated 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pD 7.0 (made from 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer in D2O; the pH was adjusted to 6.6 by phosphoric acid then lyophilized and dissolved in the required amount of D2O). 15N-Labeled enzymes were concentrated to 400 μm, and the partially deuterated 15N-labeled enzymes were concentrated to 800 μm. NMR spectra were acquired at 600 MHz on a Bruker DRX600 spectrometer at 30 °C. The long range HMQC experiments for detection of His resonances and some of the HSQC spectra were recorded using a CryoProbe (Bruker) to improve the sensitivity. Two types of experiment were recorded: (i) two-dimensional 15N HSQC (33Davis A. Keeler J. Laue E. Moskau D. J. Mag. Reson. 1992; 98: 207-216Google Scholar, 34Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W. Palmer III, A. Skelton N. Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W. Palmer III, A. Skelton N. Protein NMR Spectroscopy. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1996: 411-531Google Scholar) performed on the 15N-labeled enzymes (400 μm), and (ii) long range 15N HMQC optimized for detection of 15Nϵ-C-1Hδ, 15Nϵ-C-1Hϵ, 15Nδ-C-1Hϵ, and 15Nδ-C-1Hδ correlations between carbon-bound protons and 15N nuclei in His aromatic rings (35Damblon C. Prosperi C. Lian L. Barsukov I. Soto R. Galleni M. Frere J. Roberts G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. U. S. A. 1999; 121: 11575-11576Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) performed on the partially deuterated 15N-labeled enzymes (800 μm) and on 15N-labeled enzymes in some experiments. All experiments employed water flip-back pulses (36Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3539) Google Scholar) in combination with the WATERGATE method for water suppression (37Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. U. S. A. 1993; 115: 12593-12594Crossref Scopus (1015) Google Scholar) to minimize saturation of the water signal. 15N HSQC spectra were acquired with sweep widths of 17,985 × 12,165 Hz (1H, 15N) using 1,024 × 230 complex data points and processed to 2,048 × 1024 real data points. Long range 15N HMQC spectra were acquired with sweep widths of 7,788 × 12,165 Hz (1H, 15N) using 512 × 100 complex data points and processed to 2,048 × 1,024 real data points. The 15N offset was set to 175 ppm to maximize the intensities of His resonances. The spectra were processed and analyzed using XWINNMR 3.5 software (Bruker) and were referenced to the external standard at 0.000 ppm. The 15N reference was calculated using 15N/1H γ ratios of 0.101329118. In a second series of experiments, the change in the two-dimensional 15N HSQC spectra was recorded for 500 μm enzymes titrated with 2-cyclohexen-1-one and progesterone. A stock solution of 500 mm 2-cyclohexen-1-one in deuterated potassium phosphate buffer pD 7.0 was used to titrate the enzymes across a concentration range of 0.5–10 mm. For titrations with progesterone, a stock solution of 10 mm progesterone (in deuterated methanol) was used. Changes in two-dimensional 15N HSQC spectra for wild-type MR as a result of enzyme reduction were also recorded where 500 μm wild-type enzyme was reduced with an excess of sodium dithionite under anaerobic conditions and introduced into the NMR tube, which was then sealed inside an anaerobic glove box. Active Site Structure and Implications for Catalysis—His-186 and Asn-189 form part of the active site of MR and are located close to the redox active region of the FMN isoalloxazine ring (i.e. the flavin N5–N1 subnucleus). The residues are conserved in other related enzymes, having a histidine residue at the corresponding position of His-186 and an asparagine or histidine at the corresponding position of Asn-189 (Fig. 1A). A reduction mechanism for α/β unsaturated carbonyl compounds such as 2-cyclohexen-1-one has been proposed for OYE1 in which Tyr-196 acts as proton donor. Given the overall structural similarity of the OYE1 with related proteins such as MR and PETN reductase, it is assumed that reduction of α/β unsaturated carbonyl compounds occurs by a similar mechanism in related enzymes (Fig. 1B). In MR, however, Cys-191 replaces Tyr-196 of OYE1, and mutagenesis studies have indicated that Cys-191 is not a proton donor in the reaction mechanism (17Barna T. Messiha H.L. Petosa C. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Moody P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30976-30983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Key differences therefore exist between MR and other member proteins. For this reason we targeted His-186 and Asn-189 by mutagenesis to (i) address their role in coenzyme and substrate binding, (ii) determine whether His-186 acts as a proton donor during the reduction of α/β unsaturated carbonyl compounds, and (iii) attempt to decouple hydride and proton transfer in MR. Spectroscopic, Potentiometric, and Steady-state Kinetic Properties of the H186A and N189A Enzymes—The UV-visible absorption spectra of the purified H186A and N189A enzymes indicate absorption maxima for the flavin peaks of 462 and 385 nm (H186A), 466 and 384 nm (N189A), and 462 and 384 nm (wild-type) (Fig. 2A). Despite the location of His-186 and Asn-189 close to the flavin isoalloxazine ring, the mutations did not elicit major perturbations in the absorption properties of the enzyme-bound flavin. Potentiometric titration of the wild-type and mutant enzymes revealed that a semiquinone signal was not observed during reductive or oxidative titrations, suggesting that the potential of the oxidized/semiquinone couple is much lower than the semiquinone/hydroquinone couple. Fitting of absorption data measured at the flavin peak (∼460 nm) to Equation 2 gave potentials of -242 ± 6 mV (wild-type MR), -214 ± 7 mV (H186A), and -236 ± 6 mV (N189A) for the E12 potential of the flavin (Fig. 2B). Steady-state kinetic studies of the H186A and the N189A enzymes were performed using 2-cyclohexen-1-one as oxidizing substrate under anaerobic conditions to prevent adventitious oxidase activity. To measure the apparent kinetic constants of the H186A mutant enzyme with the substrate 2-cyclohexen-1-one, the initial velocities of the reaction were determined at 150 μm β-NADH and various concentrations of 2-cyclohexen-1-one. The initial velocities measured were very low and within values obtained with control experiments performed in the absence of 2-cyclohexen-1-one; initial velocities were also independent of 2-cyclohexen-1-one concentrations (up to 100 mm 2-cyclohexen-1-one), suggesting that the mutant is essentially inactive under steady-state turnover conditions. Activity could not be rescued for the H186A enzyme by the addition of imidazole to the reaction buffer (up to 50 mm imidazole). For the N189A mutant enzyme, the apparent kinetic constants were measured for 2-cyclohexen-1-one using 1 μm enzyme at 150 μm β-NADH and 2-cyclohexen-1-one concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100 mm. Unlike for wild-type enzyme, initial velocities were subject to inhibition at high 2-cyclohexen-1-one concentrations (Fig. 2C). The apparent kinetic constants of the N189A mutant enzyme for 2-cyclohexen-1-one were derived by fitting data to a steady-state rate expression that incorporates substrate inhibition (Equation 3). v=Vmax1+Km[S]+[S]Ki (Eq. 3) A kcat value of 0.089 ± 0.004 s-1 (0.80 ± 0.01 s-1 for wild-type MR; (17Barna T.

The apparent kinetic constants of the N189A enzyme were also measured for β-NADH using 1 μm enzyme at a fixed concentration of 2-cyclohexen-1-one (6 mm).

https://openalex.org/W1965828106,"RON is a receptor tyrosine kinase in the MET family. We have expressed and purified active RON using the Sf9/baculovirus system. The constructs used in this study comprise the kinase domain alone and the kinase domain plus the C-terminal region. The construct containing the kinase domain alone has a higher specific activity than the construct containing the kinase and C-terminal domains. Purified RON undergoes autophosphorylation, and the exogenous RON C terminus serves as a substrate. Peptides containing a dityrosine motif derived from the C-terminal tail inhibit RON <i>in vitro</i> or when delivered into intact cells, consistent with an autoinhibitory mechanism. Phenylalanine substitutions within these peptides increase the inhibitory potency. Moreover, introduction of these Phe residues into the dityrosine motif of the RON kinase leads to a decrease in kinase activity. Taken together, our data suggest a model in which the C-terminal tail of RON regulates kinase activity via an interaction with the kinase catalytic domain."

Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 609-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Both coenzymes are involved in the interconversion of C1 units at the oxidation level of formate (N5-formyl, N10-formyl, and N5, N10-methenyl+), formaldehyde (N5, N10-methylene), and methanol (N5-methyl). Whereas the universal distribution of H4F has been well established, the presence of H4MPT in various groups of Archaea and bacteria is just emerging. Originally, after the discovery of H4MPT (2.van Beelen P. van Neck J.W. de Cock R.M. Vogels G.D. Guijt W. Haasnoot C.A.G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4448-4454Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 3.Escalante-Semerena J.C. Rinehart Jr., K.L. Wolfe R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9447-9455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) it was thought to be restricted to methanogenic Archaea where it represents the essential cofactor of a series of enzymes that form the integral part of the process of methane formation from H2 and CO2 (4.Thauer R.K. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 2377-2406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the last decade, the much wider occurrence and importance of H4MPT became evident; H4MPT was found in sulfate-reducing Archaea that are phylogenetically closely related to methanogenic Archaea (5.Gorris L.G.M. Voet A.C. van der Drift C. Biofactors. 1991; 3: 29-35PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Thauer R.K. Kunow J. Barton L.L. Sulfate Reducing Bacteria. Plenum Press, New York1995: 33-48Google Scholar). More surprisingly, H4MPT was later found to be present also outside the Archaea and shown to be an essential cofactor of the central metabolism of many methylotrophic α-, β-, and γ-proteobacteria (7.Chistoserdova L. Vorholt J.A. Thauer R.K. Lidstrom M.E. Science. 1998; 281: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 8.Vorholt J.A. Chistoserdova L. Stolyar S.M. Thauer R.K. Lidstrom M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5750-5757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a group of bacteria that also comprises methanotrophic bacteria. Very recently, it was found that not only aerobic methane oxidation relies on H4MPT but also anaerobic oxidation of methane is likely to depend on H4MPT (9.Krüger M. Meyerdierks A. Glockner F.O. Amann R. Widdel F. Kube M. Reinhardt R. Kahnt J. Bocher R. Thauer R.K. Shima S. Nature. 2003; 426: 878-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), a process catalyzed by a group of Archaea closely related to the Methanosarcinales (10.Boetius A. Ravenschlag K. Schubert C.J. Rickert D. Widdel F. Gieseke A. Amann R. Jorgensen B.B. Witte U. Pfannkuche O. Nature. 2000; 407: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2162) Google Scholar, 11.Michaelis W. Seifert R. Nauhaus K. Treude T. Thiel V. Blumenberg M. Knittel K. Gieseke A. Peterknecht K. Pape T. Boetius A. Amann R. Jorgensen B.B. Widdel F. Peckmann J. Pimenov N.V. Gulin M.B. Science. 2002; 297: 1013-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). All these organisms are highly specialized in C1 metabolism and are of great ecological importance in the global carbon cycle (12.Hogan K.B. Hoffman J.S. Thompson A.M. Nature. 1991; 354: 181-182Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 13.Hinrichs K.U. Hayes J.M. Sylva S.P. Brewer P.G. DeLong E.F. Nature. 1999; 398: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). The recent documentation of functional H4MPT-dependent enzymes in the enigmatic bacterial group of Planctomycetes re-opened the debate of the evolution of H4MPT and H4MPT-dependent enzymes because phylogenetic analysis places the Planctomycetes sequences as distant from the archaeal counterparts as from their proteobacterial counterparts (14.Chistoserdova L. Jenkins C. Kalyuzhnaya M.G. Marx C.J. Lapidus A. Vorholt J.A. Staley J.T. Lidstrom M.E. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2004; 21: 1234-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Functionally the most important difference between H4MPT and H4F is the electron-donating methylene group of H4MPT in position 1c (Fig. 1), which is conjugated to N10 through the aromatic ring, whereas H4F has an electron withdrawing carbonyl group in this position (1.Maden B.E.H. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 609-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 15.Thauer R.K. Klein A.R. Hartmann G.C. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 3031-3042Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). One consequence is that the redox potentials of the N5, N10-methenyl-H4MPT+/N5, N10-methylene-H4MPT couple (–390 mV) and of the N5, N10-methylene-H4MPT/N5-methyl-H4MPT couple (–310 mV) are almost 100 mV more negative than the corresponding H4F couples. The structural and functional differences between H4MPT and H4F are reflected in the finding that most of the enzymes catalyzing the interconversion of their C1 derivatives are highly specific for H4MPT or H4F. Their primary structures indicate that most of them have evolved separately (1.Maden B.E.H. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 609-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 16.Shima S. Warkentin E. Grabarse W. Sordel M. Wicke M. Thauer R.K. Ermler U. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 935-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) although H4MPT and H4F specific enzymes catalyze analogous reactions. This is also true for most of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of H4MPT and of H4F (17.Graham D.E. White R.H. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The two C1 carriers thus appear to be products of convergent evolution. The crystal structures of six H4MPT-specific enzymes have been determined and recently reviewed by Shima et al. (18.Shima S. Warkentin E. Thauer R.K. Ermler U. J. Biosc. Bioeng. 2002; 93: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar): formylmethanofuran:H4MPT formyltransferase, methenyl-H4MPT cyclohydrolase, F420-dependent methylene-H4MPT dehydrogenase (19.Hagemeier C.H. Shima S. Thauer R.K. Bourenkov G. Bartunik H.D. Ermler U. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 1047-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), NADP-dependent methylene-H4MPT dehydrogenase (20.Ermler U. Hagemeier C.H. Roth A. Demmer U. Grabarse W. Warkentin E. Vorholt J.A. Structure (Lond.). 2002; 10: 1127-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and F420-dependent methylene-H4MPT reductase. So far none of these enzymes could be crystallized in complex with H4MPT or one of its derivatives. Only the conformation of methylene-H4MPT bound to H2-forming methylene-H4MPT dehydrogenase (Hmd) was determined by two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy (21.Bartoschek S. Buurman G. Thauer R.K. Geierstanger B.H. Weyrauch J.P. Griesinger C. Nilges M. Hutter M.C. Helms V. Chem. Biochem. 2001; 2: 530-541Google Scholar). Here we describe the structure of the formaldehyde-activating enzyme Fae from Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 with and without methylene-H4MPT bound. The enzyme catalyzes the condensation of formaldehyde with H4MPT to methylene-H4MPT (22.Vorholt J.A. Marx C.J. Lidstrom M.E. Thauer R.K. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6645-6650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This reaction also proceeds spontaneously but only at a lower rate. Fae was discovered in M. extorquens AM1, which grows aerobically at the expense of methanol oxidation to CO2 involving N5, N10-methylene-H4MPT, N5, N10-methenyl-H4MPT+, and N5-formyl-H4MPT as intermediates (23.Vorholt J.A. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 178: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Fae appears to be specific for H4MPT; no formaldehyde-H4F condensing activity could be found with purified Fae (22.Vorholt J.A. Marx C.J. Lidstrom M.E. Thauer R.K. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6645-6650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Fae minus mutants of M. extorquens AM1 are no longer capable of growth on methanol and are inhibited by trace amounts of formaldehyde indicating that Fae has a vital function in methylotrophic energy metabolism and formaldehyde detoxification (22.Vorholt J.A. Marx C.J. Lidstrom M.E. Thauer R.K. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6645-6650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The importance of Fae for methylotrophy is also reflected by its high abundance in the cytoplasm of the cell (24.Laukel M. Rossignol M. Borderies G. Völker U. Vorholt J.A. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 1247-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and its presence in diverse methylotrophic bacteria (23.Vorholt J.A. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 178: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Functional orthologs of Fae are also present in some methanogenic Archaea (22.Vorholt J.A. Marx C.J. Lidstrom M.E. Thauer R.K. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6645-6650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and in Planctomyces species (14.Chistoserdova L. Jenkins C. Kalyuzhnaya M.G. Marx C.J. Lapidus A. Vorholt J.A. Staley J.T. Lidstrom M.E. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2004; 21: 1234-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The widespread occurrence of Fae orthologs suggests that formaldehyde may play an unknown but important role in a broad group of prokaryotes. M. extorquens AM1 is the strain deposited under DSM 1338 in the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (Braunschweig, Germany). Heterologous Overproduction of Fae and Purification—Amplification of the fae gene was achieved with Expand-DNA-polymerase (Roche Applied Science), the primers 5′-GAGACCCCATATGGCAAAAATCACCAAGGTTC-3′ (sense, the NdeI site is underlined) and 5′-CTGCCCAGGAATTCCTCCGATCTAAGCGTT-3′ (antisense, the EcoRI site is underlined), and chromosomal DNA of M. extorquens AM1 as a template. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and EcoRI and ligated into the pET17b expression vector and then introduced into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS. Each transformant of E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS was grown aerobically at 37 °C on minimal medium M9 (25.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.L. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar) supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg ml–1) and chloramphenicol (50 μg ml–1). When the ΔA600 of the culture reached 0.5, cells were induced by 2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 4 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4200 × g at 4 °C. Selenomethionine-labeled protein was produced using the method of metabolic inhibition (26.Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Non-labeled Fae and selenomethionine-labeled protein were purified under aerobic conditions as described in Vorholt et al. (22.Vorholt J.A. Marx C.J. Lidstrom M.E. Thauer R.K. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6645-6650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) for Fae from M. extorquens AM1. H4MPT was purified from Methanothermobacter marburgensis (DSM 2133) (27.Breitung J. Börner G. Scholz S. Linder D. Stetter K.O. Thauer R.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 971-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and stored in 10 mm MOPS/KOH buffer pH 7. H4MPT from M. extorquens AM1 differs from that in M. marburgensis by lacking the phosphate and hydroxyglutarate group. It has been shown, however, that enzymes from M. extorquens AM1 are equally active with H4MPT and with the dephospho form (22.Vorholt J.A. Marx C.J. Lidstrom M.E. Thauer R.K. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6645-6650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystallization trials were performed with non-labeled and selenomethionine-labeled Fae at 4 °C under aerobic conditions and with enzyme in the presence of H4MPT at 8 °C under strictly anaerobic conditions. Within a hanging drop experiment each drop consisted of 1 μl of enzyme solution (13 mg/ml) and 1 μl of reservoir solution. Crystals of non-labeled Fae as well as selenomethionine-labeled Fae grew in a reservoir solution composed of 0.2 m calcium chloride × 2H2O, 0.1 m sodium acetate × 3H2O, pH 4.6, and 10–20% (v/v) isopropanol. Their space group was P43212, and the lattice parameters were a = b = 120.7 Å and c = 205.9 Å. For crystallization in the presence of H4MPT, the enzyme solution (13 mg/ml) was supplemented with 5 mm H4MPT and then combined with the reservoir solution containing 0.1 m HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.5, and 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 10,000. The space group was P21, and the lattice parameters were a = 48.9 Å, b = 112.6 Å, c = 72.0 Å and α,γ = 90°, β = 91.0°. Data were collected at ID14-4 and ID29 beamlines at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France (Table I). Processing and scaling were performed with XDS (28.Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1988; 21: 916-924Crossref Scopus (1681) Google Scholar) and Denzo/Scalepack (29.Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). The phases were calculated with SHARP and improved by solvent flattening (32.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar) assuming a solvent content of 70%. 5-fold molecular averaging within DM (33.Cowtan K.D.

Except for 10 residues at the C-terminal end the residual model could be manually incorporated using O (35.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The structure of the H4MPT-bound enzyme was solved by molecular replacement using the program EPMR (37.Kissinger C.R. Gehlhaar D.K. Fogel D.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) with the coordinates of Fae without bound substrate as the search model. After initial refinement the C-terminal amino acids disordered in the coenzyme free structure and H4MPT later replaced by methylene-H4MPT were modeled into the density. The results of the refinement are listed in Table I. The quality of the models was checked with PROCHECK (38.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Structure of Fae with and without Methylene-H4MPT Bound—Formaldehyde-activating enzyme Fae in the absence and presence of methylene-H4MPT was structurally characterized in two crystal forms at a resolution of 2.0 and 1.9 Å, respectively (Table I). The crystals formed in the presence of H4MPT contained methylene-H4MPT rather than H4MPT, which can be explained by the facts that polyethylene glycols are contaminated with formaldehyde, that methylene-H4MPT forms spontaneously, and enzymatically from formaldehyde and H4MPT under the crystallization conditions. Fae is organized as homopentameric protein complex with dimensions of about 70 Å × 70 Å × 40 Å (Fig. 2A). Each monomer consists of one compact domain that belongs to the class of α/β proteins. The central sheet contains five strands (β1–β5) joined in the order β1, β2, β5, β4, and β3, with only β4 and β5 oriented in parallel. Helix α1 arranged after strand β2 packs against one side of the sheet; helices α2 (after strand 4) and α3 (after strand 5) pack against the other (Fig. 2B). This architecture is somehow reminiscent to that of the ribosomal protein S 5 domain 2-like family to which for example the elongation factor G (39.Al-Karadaghi S. Aevarsson A. Garber M. Zheltonosova J. Liljas A. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 5: 555-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (130) Google Scholar), the ribosomal protein S 5 (40.Ramakrishnan V. White S.W. Nature. 1992; 358: 768-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and the galactokinase, homoserine kinase, mevalonate kinase, and phosphomevalonate kinase family belong. According to the program DALI (41.Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3556) Google Scholar), the root mean square deviations between Fae and elongation factor G and phosphomevalonate kinase (42.Romanowski M.J. Bonanno J.B. Burley S.K. Proteins. 2002; 47: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) are 2.7 Å and 3.1 Å using ∼60% of the Cα positions for calculation. In comparison, the root mean square deviation between the five monomers in the asymmetric unit is ∼0.15 Å that between the pentamers of the two crystal forms is 0.6 Å. A rare topological feature of this fold is the β4α2β5 left-handed cross-over linkage that appears to be crucial for the integrity of the fold (Fig. 2B). Compared with the other family members helix α2 in Fae is longer and part of the H4MPT binding site. The major difference between Fae and the other family members is an insertion between strand β2 and β4 (Fig. 2B) consisting of helix α1, strands β3, and an unusual protrusion at the end of strand β3 (see below). The pentamer can be subdivided into three circular layers built up of an α-helical, a β-sheet, and again an α-helical region (Fig. 2A). The inner ring is formed by the five tightly linked helices α1 of the insertion. The outer layer is formed by helices α2, α3, and α4 with the latter being connected to helix α2ofthe next monomer. The central ring consists of the five five-stranded β-sheets with each of them oriented roughly in a perpendicular manner to the neighboring sheet. The hydrophobic core of each sheet is enlarged by helices α1 of the next monomer at the inner side and of the C-terminal segment of the previous monomer at the outer side. A channel crosses the entire pentamer along the 5-fold axis (Fig. 2A) and is occupied with several solvent molecules and extra electron density that could not be assigned. The binding site for methylene-H4MPT is located in a 20 Å long, 8 Å wide, and 12 Å deep cleft at the interface between two adjacent subunits called A and B (Fig. 2) with the constituting residues highly conserved (Fig. 2C). Upon methylene-H4MPT binding the width of the cleft is slightly decreased because of a rotation of helix α2 of about 5° and because of a displacement of strands β1, β2, and β5 in the range of 0.3–0.5 Å. Additionally, the flexible C-terminal arm of subunit A (A160–A166) is rigidified, and the protrusion of subunit B is shifted around 2 Å toward the coenzyme. Conformation of Methylene-H4MPT When Bound to Fae— Methylene-H4MPT binds to the binding cleft with a high occupancy of about 80%. However, the temperature factor increased dramatically from the pterin and imidazolidine rings (30 Å2) via the benzene ring (38 Å2), the ribitol group (50 Å2), the ribose group (68 Å2), to the phosphate group (78 Å2) indicating only an excellent electron density of the functionally relevant head group. The 2-hydroxyglutarate group is located in the bulk solvent (Fig. 3) and is not visible in the electron density map. Note that Fae from M. extorquens AM1 was crystallized together with H4MPT from M. marburgensis rather than with the shorter H4MPT from M. extorquens AM1 (7.Chistoserdova L. Vorholt J.A. Thauer R.K. Lidstrom M.E. Science. 1998; 281: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). H4MPT from M. marburgensis contains 11 asymmetric carbons (Fig. 1). The quality of the electron density map allowed us to deduce the stereoconfiguration of five of these, 7a, 6a, 11a, 2c, and 3c (Fig. 1), which agreed with that determined previously by two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy (43.Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Schworer B. Thauer R.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3986-3993Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Methylene-H4MPT is accommodated into its binding site in an “S”-shaped conformation with the S positioned in a perpendicular manner to the front side of the cleft (Fig. 3). The pterin ring points toward the channel bottom, the imidazolidine ring and the phenyl ring are attached roughly parallel to the length of the cleft, and the ribose and phosphate groups are directed toward the bulk solvent. The S shape of methylene-H4MPT is the result of two kinks (Fig. 3A). The first sharp kink of ∼70° is located between the pterin and the imidazolidine rings around the N5-C6a bond. An additional small rotation between the imidazolidine and the phenyl rings results in a nearly perpendicular orientation between the pterin and the phenyl ring. The second kink of roughly 90° is performed within the ribitol group. This conformation of methylene-H4MPT implicates that solely the pterin ring is shielded from bulk solvent by the described roof. The rest of the methylene-H4MPT including the imidazolidine ring is at least partly solvent accessible. The conformation of methylene-H4MPT in the Fae-methylene-H4MPT complex (as described by this work) is different from the conformations of methylene-H4MPT in solution or when bound to Hmd, which have previously been determined by two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy (21.Bartoschek S. Buurman G. Thauer R.K. Geierstanger B.H. Weyrauch J.P. Griesinger C. Nilges M. Hutter M.C. Helms V. Chem. Biochem. 2001; 2: 530-541Google Scholar). The major conformational surprise of methylene-H4MPT in Fae is the large kink angle of about 70° between the pterin and the imidazolidine ring that is in solution only 50° and when bound to Hmd only 40° (Fig. 4). This remarkable change necessitates different conformations of the sp3-configured C6a and C7a atoms of the tetrahydropyrazine ring. The C6a atom has to point to the Si face in Fae but to the Re face in solution and when bound to Hmd. Consequently, atom C7a of methylene-H4MPT bound to Fae is oriented to the Re face that leads to a conformation of the C13a atom perpendicular to the pterin ring, whereas the Si face orientation leads to an equatorial position as found in the free and Hmd bound form (Fig. 4). Obviously, the protein scaffold of Fae substantially influences the conformation of methylene-H4MPT upon binding. For example, methylene-H4MPT in the conformation found in solution would interfere with PheA166 of Fae that could not evade because of its contact to ValB81. A related conformational variability of the kink is expected for methylene-H4F dependent enzymes, although an enzyme-methylene-H4F complex is so far not structurally characterized. Interactions between Fae and Methylene-H4MPT—The increasing flexibility along the elongated molecule is reflected in a parallel decrease of the protein-cofactor interactions. Only two hydrogen bonds and a few van der Waals contacts are formed between the protein matrix and the tail groups of H4MPT (Fig. 3A). In other words binding is essentially based on interactions between the polypeptide chain and the catalytically relevant head groups. The conserved residues AspA24, LysA71, LeuB53, and GlnB88 form specific hydrogen bond interactions toward the N1, NH22a, N3H, and O4a atoms (Fig. 3A). The head groups including the imidazole group of HisA22 are encircled by two hydrophobic belts one above and the other below the pterin ring. The first belt includes PheA119, ValA20, LeuA13, ProB58, ProA165, and PheA166; the second belt contains ValA72, PheA119, the hydrophobic portions of LysA71 and ThrB50, LeuB52, PheB84, ValB81, and AlaB80. The two belts partly touch each other and are opened at the front of the cleft with the shortest distances of ∼7.5 Å between PheA119 and PheA166 and between ValA72 and AlaB80 (Fig. 3A). This entrance provides access to the catalytically relevant N5, N10, and C14a atoms of the imidazolidine ring. Of particular importance for the adjustment of the ring conformations are HisA22 and LeuB52 sandwiching the pterin ring and LeuB52 and PheB84 that are positioned in the groove between the pterin, imidazolidine, and phenyl rings (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the methyl groups of methylene-H4MPT not present in methylene-H4F (Fig. 1) mainly interact with invariant hydrophobic side chains of the C-terminal arm (Fig. 3B). Atom C12a is in contact with PheA166, and atom C13a is in contact with HisA164, PheA166, and ProB58, with the latter protruding from the described protrusion at the end of strand β3. Interestingly, the binding site of methylene-H4MPT cannot be considered as prebuilt. In the empty enzyme PheA119, PheB84 and HisA22 point into the coenyzme binding site but evade the arriving methylene-H4MPT by movements up to 5 Å thereby inducing many additional conformational changes. For example, the rotation of PheA119 induces substantial rearrangements of the side chains of HisA121 and GluA123 and allows LysA71 to partially fill out the generated free place. Likewise, PheB84 swings toward the channel bottom accompanied by a shift of LeuB52 to the Re side of the pterin ring that induces a movement of ThrB50 value of 1.9 Å. Consequently, a modeling of methylene-H4MPT to the empty Fae structure would not be possible. The mentioned residues are conserved in Fae from different organisms but not in any of the other H4MPT-specific enzymes. A common binding motif for the C1 carrier was not found. This was also not to be expected because the known H4MPT specific enzymes are not similar on the sequence nor on the structural level. This also holds true for the different H4F specific enzymes, which also do not show a common H4F binding motif. Selectivity of Fae for Methylene-H4MPT Rather Than for Methylene-H4F—Fae catalyzes the reaction of formaldehyde with H4MPT. Using the same assay a formation of methylene-H4F from formaldehyde and H4F was not observed (22.Vorholt J.A. Marx C.J. Lidstrom M.E. Thauer R.K. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6645-6650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The specificity of Fae for H4MPT is also indicated by the finding that the rate of condensation of formaldehyde and H4MPT was not inhibited by the addition of an excess of H4F. 2J. A. Vorholt, unpublished results. This finding needs discussion because except for two methyl groups H4MPT and H4F only differ in their tail groups, but as described the ribitol, ribose, and phosphate groups of methylene-H4MPT appear to contribute only slightly to binding (Fig. 3). Although these few interactions as well as an interference between the protein and the formylglutamate tail groups in H4F might be crucial for selectivity the structural data support a binding mechanism that attributes a key function to the additional methyl groups (Fig. 3B). Accordingly, three of four van der Waals contacts between the methyl groups are formed to side chains of the C-terminal arm that might contribute to its partial fixation. A simultaneous conformational change of several side chains at the Re side of methylene-H4MPT generates a hydrophobic cluster composed of the tetrahydropyrazine and the imidazolidine rings, LeuA13, HisA164, ProA165, PheA166, and ProB58 and most interestingly triggers an inversion of the amide group of GlnB88. This exchange of the amide oxygen and amine groups is the prerequisite to form two hydrogen bonds to methylene-H4MPT and one hydrogen bond to HisA164 of the C-terminal arm (Fig. 3B). Thus, preferred binding of H4MPT against H4F is not only accomplished by the quantitatively small van der Waals interactions between the methyl groups and the protein but by an induced cooperative process that enhances both methylene-H4MPT binding and the fixation of the C-terminal arm. The interactions between the C-terminal arm and the methyl groups of methylene-H4MPT might additionally influence the kink angle between the pterin and imidazolidine rings and thus the binding energy between methylene-H4MPT and Fae. Formaldehyde Binding Site and Enzymatic Mechanism—Attempts to determine a structure of Fae in complex with formaldehyde failed, but an attractive binding site of the substrate is offered by the structure of the Fae-methylene-H4MPT complex. At first glance, an activation of formaldehyde by the amine group of LysA171 appears to be chemically plausible (Fig. 3A), but its fixation by a large number of interactions and the absence of space for formaldehyde binding without pushing H4MPT out of its binding site reject this possibility. More attractively, a site either occupied with a solvent molecule or an unknown molecule (depending on the considered cleft of the asymmetric unit) is positioned parallel to the imidazolidine ring and is accessible from bulk solvent. Furthermore, the oxygen atom of formaldehyde can be modeled into the site of the solvent molecule or into a protrusion of the electron density of the unknown molecule ∼4 Å apart from the N5 atom of methylene-H4MPT and 3 Å apart from the Nδ 1 atom of the highly conserved HisA22. Despite its fairly hydrophobic environment HisA22 is probably protonated as its Nϵ 2 atom donates a hydrogen bond to the negatively charged Oϵ 1 atom of GluA11 (Fig. 3A). Assuming the oxygen atom as fixed, the methylene group of formaldehyde can be placed in front of the N5 atom the distance of 3 Å, which is optimal for a nucleophilic attack. In this way the formaldehyde binding site is approximately defined. On the basis of the proposed formaldehyde position and of an assumed similarity between the conformation of H4MPT and the observed methylene-H4MPT a catalytic mechanism was outlined that essentially consists of a nucleophilic addition and a nucleophilic substitution reaction (Fig. 5). First, the nucleophilic N5 atom attacks the carbonyl carbon of formaldehyde thereby forming a tetrahedral anionic intermediate state that become protonated by HisA22. The positively charged HisA22 enhances the electrophilic properties of the carbonyl carbon of formaldehyde and serves as a general acid catalyst thereby playing a key role in the formaldehyde activation process. After formation of the hydroxymethylene-H4MPT adduct the N5 nitrogen is presumably deprotonated (Fig. 5). Second, the N10 atom nucleophilically attacks the hydroxymethylene carbon atom and the hydroxylate group is concomitantly released. HisA22 might be already reprotonated prior to hydroxylate release and acts again as hydrogen donor. After deprotonation of the N10 atom the product methylene-H4MPT is generated. Interestingly, the electron density suggests a flap of N10 above the ring plane in agreement with the conformation of the imidazolidine ring of methylene-H4MPT in the Hmd but in contrast to that in solution (21.Bartoschek S. Buurman G. Thauer R.K. Geierstanger B.H. Weyrauch J.P. Griesinger C. Nilges M. Hutter M.C. Helms V. Chem. Biochem. 2001; 2: 530-541Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). This mechanism is in agreement with the results of kinetic experiments of spontaneous methylene-H4F formation from H4F and formaldehyde (44.Kallen R.G. Jencks W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 5851-5863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The spontaneous reaction proceeds optimally under acidic conditions indicating that a protonation step is involved. Most likely, in the enzyme, the proton for this step is provided by protonated HisA22. Thus, the presented structure of the Fae-methylene-H4MPT complex is not only the prototype of how this cofactor binds to an enzyme, but it also provides insights into the mechanism of how the highly toxic intermediate formaldehyde is metabolized and thus detoxified.

This inhibition results from a direct association of F-actin with the C terminus of Abl and accounts, in part, for the loss of Abl activity in detached fibroblasts. We report here that Abl from mitotic cells or cells treated with the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid remains active when detached from the extracellular matrix. Aspartic acid substitution of Thr566, which is phosphorylated in mitotic or okadaic acid-treated cells, is sufficient to abolish F-actin-mediated inhibition and to maintain Abl activity despite cell detachment. A recent crystal structure of the Abl N-terminal region has revealed autoinhibitory interactions among the Src homology 3 (SH3), SH2, and kinase domains. We found that deletion of the SH2 domain also abolished the negative effect of F-actin on kinase activity. Immediately following the kinase domain in Abl is a proline-rich linker (PRL) that binds to several SH3 adaptor proteins. Interestingly, binding of the Crk N-terminal SH3 domain to the PRL also disrupted F-actin-mediated inhibition of Abl kinase. These results suggest that F-actin may reinforce the autoinhibitory interactions to regulate Abl kinase and that inhibition can be relieved through phosphorylation and/or protein interactions with the Abl PRL region.

The Abl tyrosine kinase transduces signals from cell surface receptors as well as DNA damaging agents to regulate actin dynamics, cell cycle, differentiation, and apoptosis (1Van Etten R.A.

This wide range of biological activities depends on a number of modular functional Abl domains, which determine its subcellular localization, its interaction partners, and the regulation of its tyrosine kinase activity (1Van Etten R.A.

These intradomain interactions are facilitated by three linkers, that of the CAP region preceding the SH3 domain at the N terminus, the SH3-SH2 linker, and the SH2-kinase linker (6Nagar B.

The Abl kinase is also negatively regulated in trans by several cellular inhibitors that directly bind to the Abl protein (7Wang J.Y.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Among the inhibitors of Abl kinase is F-actin, which binds to the Abl C terminus and contributes to the inactivation of Abl by cell detachment (8Woodring P.J. Hunter T. Wang J.Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27104-27110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Attachment of cells to fibronectin activates Abl kinase to stimulate the formation of F-actin microspikes (9Woodring P.J. Litwack E. O'Leary D. Lucero G. Wang J.Y.J. Hunter T. J.

Because activated Abl kinase can modulate the architecture of F-actin, which can in turn inhibit Abl kinase, Abl-dependent actin polymerization is self-limiting and may contribute to the dynamic membrane protrusive activity at the leading edge of spreading or migrating cells (2Woodring P.J. Hunter T. Wang J.Y.J. J. Cell Science. 2003; 116: 2613-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 9Woodring P.J. Litwack E. O'Leary D. Lucero G. Wang J.Y.J. Hunter T. J.

We have previously shown that F-actin binding to Abl reduces Abl tyrosine kinase activity in vitro and in detached cells (8Woodring P.J. Hunter T. Wang J.Y.J. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 879-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). F-actin-mediated inhibition results in reduced autophosphorylation as well as reduced substrate-phosphorylation by Abl (8Woodring P.J. Hunter T. Wang J.Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27104-27110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Disrupting Abl-F-actin association through either mutation of the Abl actin-binding domain (ABD) or treatment of fibroblasts with latrunculin A, which depolymerizes F-actin, increases Abl activity in detached fibroblasts and prevents the detachment-induced inactivation of Abl (8Woodring P.J.

Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 879-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, the ABD is not an autoinhibitory domain per se because its deletion does not affect Abl kinase activity in the absence of F-actin (8Woodring P.J. Hunter T. Wang J.Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27104-27110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To learn more about the mechanism of F-actin-mediated inhibition of Abl, we sought conditions under which the inhibitory effect of F-actin on Abl kinase could be suppressed. The Abl protein is quantitatively hyperphosphorylated on serine and threonine residues during mitosis (12Kipreos E.T. Wang J.Y.J. Science. 1990; 248: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Previous studies found that Abl kinase remains active in mitotic cells and concluded that mitotic phosphorylation does not affect Abl kinase activity (12Kipreos E.T. Wang J.Y.J. Science. 1990; 248: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In those experiments, Abl from mitotic mouse fibroblasts that were detached from the extracellular matrix by mitotic shake-off was compared with Abl from interphase cells that were attached to the extracellular matrix (12Kipreos E.T. Wang J.Y.J. Science. 1990; 248: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, when a comparison was made between Abl from detached interphase cells and detached mitotic cells, it became clear that mitotic Abl retained kinase activity despite detachment. Here, we have examined the effect of one of the mitotic phosphorylation sites, Thr566, on Abl kinase activity. Substitution of Thr566 with Asp resulted in an Abl mutant that was resistant to F-actin-mediated inhibition in vitro and that retained kinase activity in detached interphase cells. Thr566 is in a proline-rich linker (PRL) immediately C-terminal of the kinase domain in Abl. The PRL contains several distinct binding sites for SH3 domains including those of Crk, Nck, and Abi1/2 (13Feller S.M. Ren R. Hanafusa H. Baltimore D. Trends Biochem.

Here, we report that the Crk N-terminal SH3 domain but not the Crk C-terminal SH3 abrogates F-actin-mediated inhibition of Abl kinase. These data imply that the phosphorylation of Thr566 or binding of Crk SH3 to the PRL may alter Abl structure resulting in a conformation that is no longer sensitive to the inhibitory effect of F-actin. Plasmids—Murine type IV Abl DNA was cloned 3′ of the long terminal repeat promoter in the pMSCV-hph plasmid (17Pear W. Nolan G. Scott M. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar). KD and ΔF-actin Abl DNAs were described previously (8Woodring P.J. Hunter T. Wang J.Y.J. J. Biol.

T566A-Abl and T566D-Abl DNA constructs were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing. All constructs used for transfection contained the eight-amino acid FLAG sequence, flanked by three glycine residues on either side inserted internally at the unique SalI site (amino acid 978). The FLAG tag did not affect adhesion regulation of Abl kinase as determined by side by side analysis with either endogenous Abl or transfected Abl without a FLAG sequence insert (8Woodring P.J. Hunter T. Wang J.Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27104-27110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The hybrid substrate, GST-crk-mCTD, was expressed from the pGEX plasmid. Oligonucleotides with the appropriate sticky ends and coding sequences for Crk amino acids 183–237 (encompassing the YAQP motif that is phosphorylated by Abl) fused to three modified repeats of the mammalian RNA polymerase II C-terminal repeated domain (CTD). The last three repeats (repeats 50–52) were modified to eliminate all but one serine and to maintain the secondary structure of the repeats. The modified CTD sequence is shown in Fig. 5. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Phalloidin Staining—The stable mouse fibroblast cell line null for Abl activity was a gift from Dr. Rubio Ren (Brandeis University). Fibroblast cell lines were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin. Cell treatments with okadaic acid (OA) (Calbiochem) and nocodazole (Sigma) were as described previously. Transient transfections of 293T BOSC cells, retroviral infection, and production of stable cell lines expressing Abl proteins were performed as described previously (8Woodring P.J. Hunter T. Wang J.Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27104-27110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The F-actin cytoskeleton of detached cells was visualized using TRITC-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) as described previously (9Woodring P.J. Litwack E. O'Leary D. Lucero G. Wang J.Y.J. Hunter T. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 879-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Kinase Assay—Fibroblasts were lysed, and Abl was immunoprecipitated from cellular lysates using FLAGM2 monoclonal antibodies (Sigma) or K12 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Detailed procedures for fibronectin stimulation, cell lysate preparation, immunoprecipitation, and kinase assays have been described previously (8Woodring P.J. Hunter T. Wang J.Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27104-27110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The procedures for treatment of cells with okadaic acid and arresting cells in mitosis are described in the figure legends. Immunoblot analysis with the 8E9 (Pharmingen/BD Biosciences) or Ab-3 (Oncogene Sciences) Abl monoclonal antibodies was performed to determine the quantity of Abl in each immunoprecipitate. The Abl concentration was quantified using a charge-coupled device camera and software provided by Alpha Inotech. For kinase reactions using immunoprecipitated Abl (on the agarose bead matrix) the quantity of 32P incorporated into the substrate was then determined by PhosphorImager analysis using kinase-defective Abl as a negative control. The specific activity of Abl was calculated by dividing the substrate 32P incorporation (PhosphorImager) by the Abl protein in each immunoprecipitation (Abl immunoblot). For kinase reactions using purified Abl protein (in solution), values for bar graphs were obtained from scintillation counting of kinase reactions spotted onto P81 paper (8Woodring P.J. Hunter T. Wang J.Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27104-27110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Phosphotryptic Peptide Mapping—This procedure was as described previously (12Kipreos E.T. Wang J.Y.J. Science. 1990; 248: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. A total of 5 × 106 cells were detached and resuspended in growth medium. Cells were centrifuged, washed twice with serum-free and phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) + 0.5% BSA, and then resuspended in the same medium (no serum). Cells were rotated in a 50-ml conical tube for 30 min at 37 °C before adding 5 mCi/ml H 323PO4. Cells were held in suspension and rotated for 3 h at 37 °C to label the ATP pools. Half of the cells in suspension were then replated onto fibronectin-coated dishes for 30 min, the time at which Abl activity is maximal (18Lewis J. Baskaran R. Taagepera S. Schwartz M. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15174-15179Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and the Abl was immunoprecipitated using 8E9 or FLAGM2 antibodies. Abl protein was processed and phosphotryptic analysis was performed as described previously (12Kipreos E.T. Wang J.Y.J. Science. 1990; 248: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Protein Purification—FLAG-Abl was purified using the anti-FLAGM2 resin (Sigma) as described previously (8Woodring P.J. Hunter T. Wang J.Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27104-27110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). GST-tagged proteins were purified using GST-agarose as described previously (19Baskaran R. Dahmus M. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11167-11171Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 20% glycerol overnight and then aliquoted and stored at –80 °C. F-actin Polymerization and Binding Assays—F-actin was purified to homogeneity from rabbit skeletal muscle and supplied by Dr. Tom Pollard (Yale University). F-actin polymerization for kinase assays, and F-actin binding assays were carried out as described previously (8Woodring P.J. Hunter T. Wang J.Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27104-27110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). BSA in the identical F-actin polymerization buffer was used as a negative control for kinase assays containing F-actin. Mitotic Cells and Okadaic Acid-treated Cells Maintain Abl Kinase Activity in Detached Cells—Previous studies have shown Abl to be phosphorylated on at least 12 different Ser/Thr residues in metaphase cells (12Kipreos E.T. Wang J.Y.J. Science. 1990; 248: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Hyperphosphorylation disrupts the DNA binding function of Abl (20Kipreos E.T. Wang J.Y.J. Science. 1992; 256: 382-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) but does not appear to affect Abl catalytic activity (12Kipreos E.T. Wang J.Y.J. Science. 1990; 248: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In those experiments, Abl activity in detached mitotic cells was compared with adherent interphase cells (12Kipreos E.T. Wang J.Y.J. Science. 1990; 248: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, when the comparison was made between detached nocodazole-arrested mitotic 10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts and detached interphase cells, it became clear that mitotic Abl activity was much higher than that of detached interphase cells (Fig. 1A). Mitotic hyperphosphorylation of Abl can be induced by treating interphase cells with OA (12Kipreos E.T. Wang J.Y.J. Science. 1990; 248: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Therefore, Abl–/– mouse fibroblasts expressing either wild type or kinase-defective Abl (Abl-KD) were treated with 2 μm OA, and then Abl kinase activity was determined following immunoprecipitation of Abl from lysates of attached or detached cells (Fig. 1B). In immune complex kinase assays using GST-CTD as substrate and kinase-defective Abl (Fig. 1B, KD) as a negative control, we found that Abl activity from adherent fibroblasts was ∼4-fold higher than Abl from cells in suspension (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 5 and histogram). Following OA treatment, however, Abl activity was maintained despite the loss of cell adhesion (Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 6 and histogram). Because Abl is hyperphosphorylated in mitotic cells and OA-treated cells (12Kipreos E.T. Wang J.Y.J. Science. 1990; 248: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), these results suggest that hyperphosphorylation might contribute to the maintenance of Abl kinase activity in detached cells. Phosphotryptic Mapping of Abl—To compare the sites of phosphorylation on Abl in OA-treated and mitotic cells, we performed phosphotryptic peptide mapping of Abl from 32P-labeled NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts (Fig. 2). Abl from asynchronous fibroblasts contained three predominant phosphotryptic peptides (Fig. 2, spots a–c) and several minor phosphotryptic peptides (left panel). Phosphoamino acid analysis on each tryptic peptide (Fig. 2, spots a, b, and c) revealed only phosphoserine (not shown). The phosphoserine of peptide-a had previously been determined to be Ser588 (12Kipreos E.T. Wang J.Y.J. Science. 1990; 248: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Peptide-b is likely to be phosphorylated at either Ser928 or Ser1029, and peptide-c, at Ser538 or Ser638 (21Pendergast A. Traugh J. Witte O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4280-4289Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Abl from mitotic cells contained 12 additional 32P-labeled peptides (Fig. 2, middle panel) (12Kipreos E.T. Wang J.Y.J. Science. 1990; 248: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Abl from OA-treated cells contained some of the mitotic cell-specific phosphopeptides (Fig. 2, right panel) (12Kipreos E.T. Wang J.Y.J. Science. 1990; 248: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). One particular phosphopeptide (previously referred to as spot 1 (12Kipreos E.T. Wang J.Y.J. Science. 1990; 248: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), arrow) was prominent in Abl from both mitotic and OA-treated cells but was completely absent in Abl from asynchronously growing cells. This Abl phosphopeptide contained phosphothreonine (not shown), and was previously determined to be Thr566 in the tryptic peptide DAPDTPELLHTK of murine Abl (12Kipreos E.T. Wang J.Y.J. Science. 1990; 248: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, the Abl from mitotic or OA-treated cells is phosphorylated at Thr566. Lewis et al. (22Lewis J. Schwartz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14225-14230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) have reported the transient appearance of multiple Abl bands, with a subset of the Abl protein migrating more slowly on SDS-PAGE, at early time points when detached fibroblasts were reattached to fibronectin. They suggested that Abl is activated by adhesion through a transient phosphorylation of the Abl protein based on the elimination of the slower migrating bands with in vitro serine and/or threonine phosphatase treatment. We examined the in vivo phosphorylation state of Abl in cells at 30 min following the replating of NIH3T3 cells on fibronectin by phosphotryptic mapping (not shown) but did not detect phosphorylation of Thr566. Thus, although Thr566 is phosphorylated in mitotic and OA-treated cells, its phosphorylation was not induced by cell adhesion to fibronectin. Mutation of Thr566 to Asp Prevents Detachment-induced Inactivation of Abl—To determine whether phosphorylation of Thr566 may override the inhibitory effect of F-actin on Abl, we examined the consequences of substituting Thr566 with aspartic acid (T566D,TD), a phosphomimetic residue, or with alanine (T566A,TA), a nonphosphorylatable residue, on Abl activity. These mutant Abl proteins were tagged with the FLAG epitope, stably expressed in Abl–/– mouse fibroblasts, and purified using anti-FLAG agarose resin columns. Similarly, FLAG-tagged Abl, Abl-KD, and Abl-ΔABD were purified and used as positive and negative controls in the experiment. Although the in vitro kinase activity of Abl and TA-Abl toward GST-CTD was decreased in the presence of F-actin, the activity of TD-Abl was resistant to F-actin inhibition (Fig. 3A). Each purified Abl was tested for its ability to co-sediment with purified F-actin (Fig. 3B). Similar to Abl, we found that more than 90% of the Thr566 Abl mutants (TD or TA) were recovered in the pellet (Fig. 3B, P) fraction after incubation with F-actin (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the ΔABD-Abl (Abl with the C-terminal three amino acids deleted resulting in a loss of F-actin binding) showed decreased co-sedimentation with F-actin. After correcting for nonspecific sedimentation of Abl (20 ± 10%, not shown) in the absence of F-actin, we calculated that 85% of the ΔABD-Abl remained in the supernatant fraction unbound to F-actin. Therefore, TD-Abl can bind to F-actin, but its kinase activity is resistant to inhibition by F-actin. We have previously shown that actin co-immunoprecipitates with Abl from detached cells and contributes to the reduction in kinase activity in immune complex kinase assays (9Woodring P.J. Litwack E. O'Leary D. Lucero G. Wang J.Y.J. Hunter T. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 879-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We therefore compared the activity of transiently expressed TA- and TD-Abl immunoprecipitated from attached and detached cells (Fig. 3C). The autophosphorylation activity of Abl and TA- and TD-Abl was similar in attached cells (Fig. 3C). However, TD-Abl had higher activity than wild type Abl and TA-Abl in detached cells (Fig. 3C). Thus, TD-Abl is resistant to the inhibitory effect of F-actin, and its kinase activity is higher than Abl or TA-Abl in detached cells. T566D-Abl Increases Peripheral F-actin Microspikes in Suspended Fibroblasts—Fibroblasts detached from the extracellular matrix are typically spherical with few membrane protrusions (9Woodring P.J. Litwack E. O'Leary D. Lucero G. Wang J.Y.J. Hunter T. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 879-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that Abl-ΔABD remains active in suspended fibroblasts and causes the formation of membrane projections rich in F-actin (9Woodring P.J. Litwack E. O'Leary D. Lucero G. Wang J.Y.J. Hunter T. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 879-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The TD-Abl mutant, which also retains kinase activity in detached cells, exerted a similar effect (Fig. 4). The F-actin cytoskeleton of suspended Abl–/– cells stably expressing Abl, Abl-KD, or TA-Abl resembled those expressing only the retroviral vector (Fig. 4). In these suspended cells, F-actin was predominantly at the cell periphery as a ring underlying plasma membranes that appeared smooth. In contrast, cells expressing either of the two Abl mutants, T566D-Abl or ΔABD-Abl, contained numerous F-actin microspikes at the periphery (Fig. 4). This is consistent with our previous results showing that maintenance of active Abl kinase can produce F-actin protrusions in the absence of integrin-extracellular matrix engagement (9Woodring P.J. Litwack E. O'Leary D. Lucero G. Wang J.Y.J. Hunter T. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 879-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Crk N-SH3 but Not C-SH3 Disrupts F-actin-mediated Inhibition of Abl Kinase—Thr566 is located immediately C-terminal of the kinase domain within a PRL that contains binding sites for several SH3-adaptor proteins including Abi1/2, Crk, and Nck (13Feller S.M. Ren R. Hanafusa H. Baltimore D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 453-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 14Ren R. Ye Z.-S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 23Dai Z. Pendergast A.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2569-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 24Shi Y. Alin K. Goff S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2583-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the adaptor protein Crk binds to the PRL and is a substrate of the Abl kinase (14Ren R. Ye Z.-S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 25Feller S. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that Abl phosphorylation of GST-Crk in vitro was not inhibited by F-actin (Fig. 5, B and C). Abl autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of another substrate, the CTD of RNA polymerase II, by contrast, was inhibited by F-actin (Fig. 5, B and C). We have prepared a GST-Crk-mCTD fusion protein that contains just the phosphorylation site of Crk joined to three modified repeats of CTD (Fig. 5A), and the phosphorylation of this substrate by Abl was sensitive to inhibition by F-actin (Fig. 5, B and C). To examine directly the effect of Crk SH3 on Abl activity, we included either the N-terminal or the C-terminal SH3 domain of Crk in Abl autophosphorylation reactions (Fig. 5D). Purified Abl had detectable autokinase activity in vitro (Fig. 5D, lane 3), which was inhibited by F-actin (lane 4). Addition of the Crk N-terminal SH3, which binds to the Abl PRL, caused a 2.5-fold increase in autokinase activity (Fig. 5D, compare lanes 1 and 3). Addition of F-actin did not reduce the Abl autokinase activity when the Crk N-terminal SH3 was present (Fig. 5D, compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3 and 4). By contrast, the Crk C-terminal SH3 did not significantly increase the Abl autokinase activity (Fig. 5D, compare lanes 3 and 5) and could not prevent F-actin from inhibiting Abl kinase (compare lanes 5 and 6 with lanes 3 and 4). Abl-ΔSH2 Mutant Retains Kinase Activity in Detached Cells—The Abl SH2 domain has previously been shown to contribute to the processive tyrosine phosphorylation of Abl substrates such as the CTD of RNA polymerase II (26Duyster J. Rajasekaran B. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1555-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous results, we found that ΔSH2-Abl from attached cells exhibited a 1.5–2-fold lower CTD-kinase activity than did Abl from attached cells (Fig. 6A). In contrast to Abl, the kinase activity of ΔSH2-Abl was not reduced in detached cells (Fig. 6A). This led us to test whether F-actin could inhibit the kinase activity of purified ΔSH2-Abl in vitro. The addition of F-actin lowered the purified Abl kinase activity but did not reduce the activity of ΔSH2-Abl (Fig. 6B). As a control, we showed that F-actin did not inhibit the kinase activity of ΔABD-Abl (Fig. 6B). We found that a point mutation that inactivates the phosphotyrosine-binding pocket of the SH2 domain (FLVR171ES → FLVK171ES) did not rescue Abl kinase from F-actin-mediated inhibition (data not shown). We have also found that substitution of Abl SH2 with Src does not disrupt F-actin-mediated inhibition of Abl kinase (see Ref. 8Woodring P.J. Hunter T. Wang J.Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27104-27110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It thus appears that the complete removal of SH2 domain is required to prevent F-actin from inhibiting Abl. To further examine the basis for why ΔSH2-Abl kinase is resistant to F-actin, we performed sedimentation binding assays and found ΔSH2-Abl to be defective in co-sedimenting with F-actin (Fig. 6C). Previous work has shown that an ABD fragment of Abl (amino acids 979–1142), when purified as a GST fusion protein from bacteria, co-sedimented with F-actin (27McWhirter J.R. Wang J.Y.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1533-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). We have found that the Abl-SH2 domain alone did not co-sediment with F-actin (not shown). These results suggest that the SH2 domain may be required to maintain Abl in a conformation that allows the ABD to associate with F-actin. It is possible that the SH2 domain may be required in conjunction with the ABD to facilitate binding of full-length Abl to F-actin. Alternatively, deletion of the SH2 domain may affect the overall folding of the Abl protein resulting in the masking of the ABD. Maintaining Abl Kinase Activity in Detached Mitotic Cells— The Abl non-receptor tyrosine kinase contributes to the cytoskeletal remodeling in fibroblasts and neurons (2Woodring P.J. Hunter T. Wang J.Y.J. J. Cell Science. 2003; 116: 2613-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 28Hernandez S. Krishnaswami M. Miller A. Koleske A.

Because Abl modifies actin structures through phosphorylating substrates (10Woodring P.J. Meisenhelder J. Johnson S.A. Zhou G.L. Field J. Shah K. Bladt F. Pawson T. Niki M. Pandolfi P.P. Wang J.Y.J.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5471-5479Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), the inhibitory effects of F-actin on Abl kinase must be repressed or relieved for Abl to exert its cytoskeletal effects. Our data suggest that the hyperphosphorylation of Abl during mitosis is one mechanism through which Abl escapes the F-actin mediated inhibition. We propose that mitosis-specific phosphorylation of Abl is needed to maintain its kinase activity despite the weakened interactions with the extracellular matrix in mitotic cells. We have shown that substitution of Thr566 with Asp is sufficient to disrupt F-actin-mediated inhibition and to maintain Abl kinase activity in detached cells. It should be noted that Thr566 is not conserved in the human ABL protein (human ABL contains Val at this position). However, other nearby mitotic Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites are conserved between mouse and human ABL. Moreover, we have found that human ABL as well as BCR-ABL are quantitatively hyperphosphorylated during mitosis (12Kipreos E.T. Wang J.Y.J. Science. 1990; 248: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Although the T566D mutant abrogates F-actin-mediated inhibition of Abl kinase, T566A mutant remains sensitive to F-actin. However, the T566A mutant, similar to Abl, retained its kinase activity in detached mitotic cells (not shown). This suggests that other mitotic phosphorylation sites in Abl and/or additional regulatory mechanisms may exist to maintain Abl kinase activity in detached mitotic cells. At present, the reason why Abl activity is released from F-actin-dependent regulation during mitosis is unclear. Abl might play a role in the remodeling of F-actin cytoskeleton in mitotic cells or might contribute to initiation of post-mitotic cell spreading. However, because Abl-deficient cells do not exhibit mitotic defects in culture, the mitotic function of Abl tyrosine kinase may not be essential. Conformation-dependent Inhibition of Abl Kinase by F-actin—The crystal structures of the N-terminal region of Abl have provided much insight toward an understanding of how intramolecular interactions can regulate its kinase activity (6Nagar B. Hantschel O. Young M. Scheffzek K. Veach D. Bornmann W. Clarkson B. Superti-Furga G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2003; 112: 859-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The Abl kinase domain is folded into an autoinhibited conformation that is stabilized by several interlocking interactions between the SH3 and SH2 domains, between the SH3 domain, the SH2-kinase linker, and the kinase N-lobe, and between the SH2 domain and the kinase C-lobe (6Nagar B. Hantschel O. Young M. Scheffzek K. Veach D. Bornmann W. Clarkson B. Superti-Furga G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2003; 112: 859-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The SH2/C-lobe interaction requires the binding of myristate to a lipid-binding pocket in the C-lobe (6Nagar B. Hantschel O. Young M. Scheffzek K. Veach D. Bornmann W. Clarkson B. Superti-Furga G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2003; 112: 859-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7). In one of the crystal structures (structure A), the myristate was added in trans, and it was bound into the kinase C-lobe. In another crystal structure containing murine Abl type IV amino acids 1–532 (structure B), the N-terminal myristoyl group bound into the same pocket (6Nagar B. Hantschel O. Young M. Scheffzek K. Veach D. Bornmann W. Clarkson B. Superti-Furga G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2003; 112: 859-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Folding of the N-terminal myristoyl group of human ABL-Ib (and murine Abl type IV) into the kinase C-lobe is likely to involve docking interactions of the N-terminal CAP with the SH3-SH2-kinase domains (6Nagar B. Hantschel O. Young M. Scheffzek K. Veach D. Bornmann W. Clarkson B. Superti-Furga G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2003; 112: 859-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7). Our finding that F-actin does not inhibit ΔSH2-Abl and only partially inhibits ΔSH3-Abl (8Woodring P.J. Hunter T. Wang J.Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27104-27110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) suggests the autoinhibited conformation is required for F-actin to exert its inhibitory effect on Abl activity (Fig. 7). The current crystal structure of Abl does not provide any insights into how the large C-terminal region of Abl (608 amino acids) may interact with the autoinhibited conformation because this region (murine type IV amino acids 535–1142) is not present in these structures. Data presented in this report suggest the C-terminal region can modulate the autoinhibited N-terminal structure and vice versa. We have found that deletion of the SH2 domain can disrupt the ABD/F-actin interaction. We therefore propose a model of mutual stabilizing interactions between the SH2/C-lobe assembly and F-actin·ABD complex (Fig. 7). As a result, F-actin exerts a negative allosteric effect on Abl kinase by enforcing the autoinhibitory conformation. We have also found that phosphorylation at Thr566 or binding of Crk N-SH3 can disrupt the inhibition of Abl kinase by F-actin. Again, the current Abl crystal structures do not contain Thr566 or the PRL region, which begins with Pro545. The crystal structure has defined the myristate-binding site in the kinase C-lobe. The myristoyl group contacts 12 amino acids and induces the bending of α-I helix (6Nagar B. Hantschel O. Young M. Scheffzek K. Veach D. Bornmann W. Clarkson B. Superti-Furga G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2003; 112: 859-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The α-I helix is straight in crystal structures that do not contain myristate (6Nagar B. Hantschel O. Young M. Scheffzek K. Veach D. Bornmann W. Clarkson B. Superti-Furga G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2003; 112: 859-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). When myristate is added to the Abl kinase domain, it engages several helices in the kinase C-lobe causing the α-I helix to adopt a bent conformation (6Nagar B. Hantschel O. Young M. Scheffzek K. Veach D. Bornmann W. Clarkson B. Superti-Furga G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2003; 112: 859-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Bending the α-I helix is required for interactions between the SH2 domain and residues in the C-lobe (6Nagar B. Hantschel O. Young M. Scheffzek K. Veach D. Bornmann W. Clarkson B. Superti-Furga G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2003; 112: 859-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the α-I helix extends to the C-terminal end of the crystal structure at Lys531. It is conceivable that α-I helix conformation may be subject to modulation by sequences that are immediately downstream but missing from the current crystal structure. We propose that Thr566 phosphorylation or SH3-binding to the PRL can alter the conformation of the α-I helix and thus disrupt the SH2/C-lobe interaction (Fig. 7). Substitution of Thr566 with either Asp or Ala did not affect the co-sedimentation with F-actin (Fig. 3). Binding of CrkSH3 domain reduced but did not abolish the co-sedimentation of Abl with F-actin (not shown). Thus, perturbations of the PRL region appear to disrupt the inhibitory effect of F-actin without abolishing the ABD/F-actin interaction (Fig. 7). Besides Crk, the Nck SH3 adapter protein and the Abi1/2 proteins, which associate with Abl via the PRL, have also been shown to activate Abl in cells (15Shishido T. Akagi T. Chalmers A. Maeda M. Terada T. Georgescu M. Hanafusa H. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Smith J.M. Katz S. Mayer B.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 21685-21692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The proposed model could explain how these adaptor proteins activate Abl kinase. In addition, oncogenic BCR-ABL retains kinase activity while stably associated with F-actin in transformed cells (27McWhirter J.R. Wang J.Y.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1533-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). BCR-ABL is a homo-oligomer that autophosphorylates constitutively (27McWhirter J.R. Wang J.Y.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1533-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In addition to its oligomerization, BCR-ABL lacks the myristoyl group and part of the CAP linker (6Nagar B. Hantschel O. Young M. Scheffzek K. Veach D. Bornmann W. Clarkson B. Superti-Furga G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2003; 112: 859-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 37Wang J.Y.J. Gutkind J.S. Signal Transduction, Cell Cycle and Their Inhibitors. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000: 303-324Google Scholar); hence, its SH2/C-lobe interaction is likely to be weakened. Moreover, BCR-ABL stably associates with CrkL, a Crk-related protein, through the PRL region (38Bhat A. Kolibaba K. Oda T. Ohno-Jones S. Heaney C. Druker B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16170-16175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Oligomerization, disruption of the SH2/C-lobe interaction, and CrkL binding to the PRL may each contribute to the release of BCR-ABL from F-actin-mediated inhibition. In summary, the inhibitory effect of F-actin on Abl kinase can be overridden not only by mutating the F-actin binding consensus motif at the extreme C terminus of Abl but also through phosphorylation of Thr566, binding of the Crk N-terminal SH3 domain, or deletion of the SH2 domain. At present, we cannot determine how the deletion of SH2 domain disrupts the F-actin binding function of Abl. Ultimately, co-crystallization of full-length Abl with F-actin bound to the C terminus is needed to fully elucidate how F-actin exerts its negative effects through the N-terminal autoinhibited conformation mediated by the interactions among the CAP-SH3-SH2-kinase domains. Unraveling the mechanisms that allow allosteric inhibitors such as F-actin to regulate Abl kinase will assist in the development of new strategies to inhibit deregulated BCR-ABL kinase of human chronic myelogenous leukemia.

https://openalex.org/W1974677394,"Several lines of evidence indicate that some glycoconjugates are efficient effectors of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) conversion into its pathogenic (PrPSc) isoform. To assess how glycoconjugate glycan moieties participate in the biogenesis of PrPSc, an exhaustive comparative analysis of the expression of about 200 glycosylation-related genes was performed on prion-infected or not, hypothalamus-derived GT1 cells by hybridization of DNA microarrays, semiquantitative RT-PCR, and biochemical assays. A significant up- (30-fold) and down- (17-fold) regulation of the expression of the ChGn1 and Chst8 genes, respectively, was observed in prion-infected cells. ChGn1 and Chst8 are involved in the initiation of the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate and in the 4-O-sulfation of non-reducing N-acetylgalactosamine residues, respectively. A possible role for a hyposulfated chondroitin in PrPSc accumulation was evidenced at the protein level and by determination of chondroitin and heparan sulfate amounts. Treatment of Sc-GT1 cells with a heparan mimetic (HM2602) induced an important reduction of the amount of PrPSc, associated with a total reversion of the transcription pattern of the N-acetylgalactosamine-4-O-sulfotransferase 8. It suggests a link between the genetic control of 4-O-sulfation and PrPSc accumulation."
