https://openalex.org/W2170939558,"The ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway plays a major role in selective protein degradation. Ubiquitination of proteins requires the sequential action of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2), and in some cases ubiquitin-protein ligases (E3s). The oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 utilize this cellular proteolytic system to target the tumor suppressor protein p53. The HPV E6 oncoprotein binds to a cellular protein of 100 kd, termed E6-associated protein (E6-AP). The E6-E6-AP complex specifically interacts with p53, resulting in the rapid ubiquitin-dependent degradation of p53. Here we report the purification and identification of the factors necessary for the E6-E6-AP-mediated ubiquitination of p53. The ubiquitination of p53 requires the E1 enzyme and a novel E2 in mammalian cells, while E3 activity is conferred by the E6-E6-AP complex. Furthermore, E6-AP appears to have ubiquitin-protein ligase activity in the absence of E6."
https://openalex.org/W1971016259,"The SNARE hypothesis holds that a transport vesicle chooses its target for fusion when a soluble NSF attachment protein (SNAP) receptor on the vesicle (v-SNARE) pairs with its cognate t-SNARE at the target membrane. Three synaptosomal membrane proteins have previously been identified: syntaxin, SNAP-25 (t-SNAREs), and vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) (v-SNARE); all assemble with SNAPs and NSF into 20S fusion particles. We now report that in the absence of SNAP and NSF, these three SNAREs form a stable complex that can also bind synaptotagmin. Synaptotagmin is displaced by alpha-SNAP, suggesting that these two proteins share binding sites on the SNARE complex and implying that synaptotagmin operates as a ""clamp"" to prevent fusion from proceeding in the absence of a signal. The alpha-SNAP-SNARE complex can bind NSF, and NSF-dependent hydrolysis of ATP dissociates the complex, separating syntaxin, SNAP-25, and VAMP. ATP hydrolysis by NSF may provide motion to initiate bilayer fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2128964111,"Genetic and metabolic studies have been done on a large kindred in which several males are affected by a syndrome of borderline mental retardation and abnormal behavior. The types of behavior that occurred include impulsive aggression, arson, attempted rape, and exhibitionism. Analysis of 24-hour urine samples indicated markedly disturbed monoamine metabolism. This syndrome was associated with a complete and selective deficiency of enzymatic activity of monoamine oxidase A (MAOA). In each of five affected males, a point mutation was identified in the eighth exon of the MAOA structural gene, which changes a glutamine to a termination codon. Thus, isolated complete MAOA deficiency in this family is associated with a recognizable behavioral phenotype that includes disturbed regulation of impulsive aggression."
https://openalex.org/W2019207089,"Ethylene behaves as a hormone in plants, regulating such aspects of growth and development as fruit ripening, flower senescence, and abscission. Ethylene insensitivity is conferred by dominant mutations in the ETR1 gene early in the ethylene signal transduction pathway of Arabidopsis thaliana. The ETR1 gene was cloned by the method of chromosome walking. Each of the four known etr1 mutant alleles contains a missense mutation near the amino terminus of the predicted protein. Although the sequence of the amino-terminal half of the deduced ETR1 protein appears to be novel, the carboxyl-terminal half is similar in sequence to both components of the prokaryotic family of signal transducers known as the two-component systems. Thus, an early step in ethylene signal transduction in plants may involve transfer of phosphate as in prokaryotic two-component systems. The dominant etr1-1 mutant gene conferred ethylene insensitivity to wild-type Arabidopsis plants when introduced by transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2115701574,"Mitogenic stimulation of cells induces rapid and transient activation of MAP kinases. Here we report that a growth factor-inducible gene, 3CH134, encodes a dual specificity phosphatase that dephosphorylates and inactivates p42MAPK both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, 3CH134 protein dephosphorylates both T183 and Y185 in p42MAPK. In serum-stimulated normal fibroblasts, the kinetics of inactivation of p42MAPK coincides with the appearance of newly synthesized 3CH134 protein, and the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide leads to persistent activation of MAP kinase. Expression of 3CH134 in COS cells leads to selective dephosphorylation of p42MAPK from the spectrum of phosphotyrosyl proteins. 3CH134 blocks phosphorylation and activation of p42MAPK mediated by serum, oncogenic Ras, or activated Raf, whereas the catalytically inactive mutant of the phosphatase, Cys-258-->Ser, augments MAP kinase phosphorylation under similar conditions. The mutant 3CH134 protein also forms a physical complex with the phosphorylated form of p42MAPK. These findings suggest that 3CH134 is a physiological MAP kinase phosphatase; we propose the name MKP-1 for this phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W2158499654,"The mouse Mash-1 gene, like its Drosophila homologs of the achaete-scute complex (AS-C), encodes a transcription factor expressed in neural precursors. We created a null allele of this gene by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Mice homozygous for the mutation die at birth with apparent breathing and feeding defects. The brain and spinal cord of the mutants appear normal, but their olfactory epithelium and sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric ganglia are severely affected. In the olfactory epithelium, neuronal progenitors die at an early stage, whereas the nonneuronal supporting cells are present. In sympathetic ganglia, the mutation arrests the development of neuronal precursors, preventing the generation of sympathetic neurons, but does not affect glial precursor cells. These observations suggest that Mash-1, like its Drosophila homologs of the AS-C, controls a basic operation in development of neuronal progenitors in distinct neural lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2027980197,"Adenoviruses enter their host cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis and acid-activated penetration from endosomes into the cytosol and deliver their DNA genome into the nucleus. Our results show that incoming adenovirus type 2 particles undergo a stepwise disassembly program necessary to allow progress of the virus in the entry pathway and release of the genome into the nucleus. The fibers are released, the penton base structures dissociated, the proteins connecting the DNA to the inside surface of the capsid degraded or shed, and the capsid-stabilizing minor proteins eliminated. The uncoating process starts immediately upon endocytic uptake with the loss of fibers and ends with the uptake of dissociated hexon proteins and DNA into the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2007821628,"The apical ectodermal ridge plays a key role in limb development. We show that recombinant FGF-4 can substitute for the ridge to provide all the signals necessary for virtually complete outgrowth and patterning of the chick limb. FGF-4 stimulates proliferation of cells in the distal mesenchyme and maintains a signal from the posterior to the distal mesenchyme that appears to be required for elaboration of skeletal elements in the normal proximodistal sequence. Moreover, retinoic acid, which is capable of providing polarizing activity, can supply this signal. This suggests that polarizing activity plays a role in patterning along the proximodistal axis, in addition to its well-established role in anteroposterior patterning. Taken together, the data suggest a simple mechanism whereby FGF-4 links growth and pattern formation during limb development."
https://openalex.org/W2019638830,"Although many T cells carry two in-frame V alpha rearrangements, the products of both V alpha rearrangements have never been shown simultaneously on the surface of normal cells. With the use of monoclonal antibodies to V alpha 2, V alpha 12, and V alpha 24, up to one-third of mature T cells expressed two V alpha chains as part of two functional and independent T cell receptors (TCRs). Thus, the ""one cell, one receptor"" rule does not apply to a large subset of alpha beta T cells. Cells that belong to this dual TCR subset may be specific for a broader range of antigens than cells with a single receptor, which may be important for autoimmunity and alloreactivity."
https://openalex.org/W2136880905,"Eukaryotic cells rapidly reorganize their microtubule cytoskeleton during the cell cycle, differentiation, and cell migration. In this study, we have purified a heterodimeric protein, katanin, that severs and disassembles microtubules to tubulin dimers. The disassembled tubulin can repolymerize, indicating that it is not irreversibly modified or denatured in the reaction. Katanin is a microtubule-stimulated ATPase and requires ATP hydrolysis to sever microtubules. Katanin represents a novel type of enzyme that utilizes energy from nucleotide hydrolysis to break tubulin-tubulin bonds within a microtubule polymer, a process that may aid in disassembling complex microtubule arrays within cells."

https://openalex.org/W1982051667,"Many bacterial signaling pathways involve a two-component design. In these pathways, a sensor kinase, when activated by a signal, phosphorylates its own histidine, which then serves as a phosphoryl donor to an aspartate in a response regulator protein. The Sln1 protein of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has sequence similarities to both the histidine kinase and the response regulator proteins of bacteria. A missense mutation in SLN1 is lethal in the absence but not in the presence of the N-end rule pathway, a ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic system. The finding of SLN1 demonstrates that a mode of signal transduction similar to the bacterial two-component design operates in eukaryotes as well."
https://openalex.org/W2042688292,"Enhancement of RNA polymerase II transcription by the viral transactivator VP16 requires the TFIID complex, which consists of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and TBP-associated factors (TAFs). Here we report the molecular cloning, expression, and biochemical characterization of Drosophila TAFII40 (dTAFII40), a subunit of TFIID. In vitro protein-protein interaction assays revealed direct binding between dTAFII40 and a 39 amino acid VP16 activation domain. In addition, affinity chromatography indicated a direct binding of the basal factor TFIIB to immobilized dTAFII40. Since VP16 also binds TFIIB, our results suggest a ternary interaction among an activator, a coactivator, and a basal transcription factor. Antibodies directed against dTAFII40 inhibited activation by GAL4-VP16 without affecting basal transcription. These results, taken together with previous studies of Sp1 and dTAFII110, establish that different activators interact with distinct TAFs in the TFIID complex and that TAFs can contact both activators and basal factors."
https://openalex.org/W2044347050,"Heritable inactivation of genes occurs in specific chromosomal domains located at the silent mating type loci and at telomeres of S. cerevisiae. The SIR genes (for silent information regulators) are trans-acting factors required for this repression mechanism. We show here that the SIR3 and SIR4 gene products have a sub-nuclear localization similar to the telomere-associated RAP1 protein, which is found primarily in foci at the nuclear periphery of fixed yeast spheroplasts. In strains deficient for either SIR3 or SIR4, telomeres lose their perinuclear localization, as monitored by RAP1 immunofluorescence. The length of the telomeric repeat shortens in sir3 and sir4 mutant strains, and the mitotic stability of chromosome V is reduced. These data suggest that SIR3 and SIR4 are required for both the integrity and subnuclear localization of yeast telomeres, the loss of which correlates with loss of telomere-associated gene repression."
https://openalex.org/W1989491629,"Glycogen storage disease (GSD) type 1a is caused by the deficiency of D-glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), the key enzyme in glucose homeostasis. Despite both a high incidence and morbidity, the molecular mechanisms underlying this deficiency have eluded characterization. In the present study, the molecular and biochemical characterization of the human G6Pase complementary DNA, its gene, and the expressed protein, which is indistinguishable from human microsomal G6Pase, are reported. Several mutations in the G6Pase gene of affected individuals that completely inactivate the enzyme have been identified. These results establish the molecular basis of this disease and open the way for future gene therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2039871973,"The Tax protein of human T cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-I) transcriptionally activates the HTLV-I promoter. This activation requires binding sites for activating transcription factor (ATF) proteins, a family of cellular proteins that contain basic region-leucine zipper (bZIP) DNA binding domains. Data are presented showing that Tax increases the in vitro DNA binding activity of multiple ATF proteins. Tax also stimulated DNA binding by other bZIP proteins, but did not affect DNA binding proteins that lack a bZIP domain. The increase in DNA binding occurred because Tax promotes dimerization of the bZIP domain in the absence of DNA, and the elevated concentration of the bZIP homodimer then facilitates the DNA binding reaction. These results help explain how Tax activates viral transcription and transforms cells."

https://openalex.org/W1998995307,"The capsular polysaccharide complex from Bacteroides fragilis promotes the formation of intra-abdominal abscesses--a pathologic host response to infecting microorganisms. This complex consists of two distinct polysaccharides, each with repeating units that have positively charged amino groups and negatively charged carboxyl or phosphate groups. Analysis of these polysaccharides as well as other charged carbohydrates before and after chemical modification revealed that these oppositely charged groups are required for the induction of intra-abdominal abscesses in a rat model."
https://openalex.org/W2071559339,"The voltage-activated rabbit cardiac calcium channel alpha 1 subunit was expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The charge movement of its voltage sensor was measured and related to the opening of the ion-conducting pore. The half-activation potential for charge movement was 35 millivolts more negative than that for pore opening. Coexpression of the cardiac calcium channel beta subunit reduced this difference without affecting charge movement. Thus, intramolecular coupling between the voltage sensor and the channel pore opening can be facilitated by a regulatory subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1570736076,"The alpha 2-adrenergic receptors are linked to inhibition of adenylylcyclase and, under certain circumstances, to stimulation of phospholipid hydrolysis via pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. Here we show that alpha 2-adrenergic receptors can couple to an alternative signaling pathway. When expressed in Rat-1 cells, stimulation of the alpha 2A receptor, which couples to Gi2 and Gi3, causes rapid, transient activation of the protooncogene product p21ras as measured by an increase in the amount of bound GTP. Furthermore, alpha 2A receptor stimulation causes rapid phosphorylation of the p42 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. Pertussis toxin completely inhibits both p21ras activation and MAP kinase phosphorylation, but both responses appear to be independent of adenylylcyclase inhibition or phospholipase stimulation. Thus, alpha 2-adrenergic receptors can couple to the p21ras-MAP kinase pathway via Gi, which may explain the mitogenic potential of alpha 2 agonists in certain cell types; together with previous results, these findings further suggest that activation of this pivotal signaling pathway may be a common event in the action of Gi-coupled receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2010986138,"There is evidence from atomic force microscopy for a long-range attractive force between hydrophobic surfaces that is virtually identical to that observed with the surface forces apparatus. This force is present in the nonaqueous solvent ethylene glycol. A possible molecular mechanism involves in-plane polarized domains of solid-like monolayers adsorbed on mica, and a theoretical model has been developed that accounts for many of the observations."
https://openalex.org/W2020994883,"Serotonin (5-HT) induces both short-term and long-term facilitation of the identified synaptic connections between sensory and motor neurons of Aplysia. Three independent experimental approaches showed that long-term facilitation can normally be expressed in the absence of short-term facilitation: (i) The 5-HT antagonist cyproheptadine blocked the induction of short-term but not long-term facilitation; (ii) concentrations of 5-HT below threshold for the induction of short-term facilitation nonetheless induced long-term facilitation; and (iii) localized application of 5-HT to the sensory neuron cell body and proximal synapses induced long-term facilitation in distal synapses that were not exposed to 5-HT and had not expressed short-term facilitation. These results suggest that short-term and long-term synaptic facilitation are induced in parallel in the sensory neurons and that the short-term process, because it is induced and expressed at the synapse, can occur locally, but the long-term process, because of its dependence on a nuclear signal, is expressed throughout the neuron."
https://openalex.org/W2093531054,"Previous studies suggest that the yeast SIR1 protein is involved in the establishment of transcriptional silencing at the HM mating-type loci. Here we show that a GAL4 DNA-binding domain-SIR1 hybrid protein (GBD-SIR1), when targeted to an HMR locus containing GAL4-binding sites (UASG), can establish silencing and bypass the requirement for the silencer element HMR-E. Silencing mediated by GBD-SIR1 requires the trans-acting factors that normally participate in repression, namely, SIR2, SIR3, SIR4, and histone H4. However, GBD hybrids with SIR2, SIR3, or SIR4 cannot establish silencing. Telomeric silencing, which does not require SIR1 and is normally unstable, is greatly improved by tethering GBD-SIR1 to the telomere. These experiments support a model in which native SIR1 protein is brought to the HM loci by proteins bound to the silencers. Telomeres appear to lack the ability to recruit SIR1, and that is why telomeric silencing is unstable."

https://openalex.org/W2030047965,"The amino acid at position 160 of the ligand-binding subunit, alpha 1, is an important determinant of agonist and antagonist binding to the glycine receptor. Exchange of the neighboring residues, phenylalanine at position 159 and tyrosine at position 161, increased the efficacy of amino acid agonists. Whereas wild-type alpha 1 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes required 0.7 millimolar beta-alanine for a half-maximal response, the doubly mutated (F159Y,Y161F) alpha 1 subunit had an affinity for beta-alanine (which was more potent than glycine) that was 110-fold that of the wild type. Also, gamma-aminobutyric acid and D-serine, amino acids that do not activate wild-type alpha 1 receptors, efficiently gated the mutant channel. Thus, aromatic hydroxyl groups are crucial for ligand discrimination at inhibitory amino acid receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1555236883,"We analyzed the status of retinoblastoma and p53 genes in 10 human hepatoma cell lines. Polyclonal anti-peptide antibodies generated against peptides homologous to COOH-terminal and leucine-zipper domains of the retinoblastoma protein allowed us to identify two cell lines (Hep 3B and FOCUS) with abnormal expression. The same cell lines have both lacked p53 expression. In contrast to the retinoblastoma gene, the expression of the p53 gene was abnormal in six additional cell lines. Indeed, only the Hep G2 hepatoblastoma cell line (and its derivative Hep G2/2215) appeared to have normal p53 and retinoblastoma gene expression. Our studies indicate that p53 abnormalities are common but retinoblastoma gene aberrations are rare in human hepatoma cell lines.—Puisieux, A., Galvin, K., Troalen, F., Bressac, B., Marcais, C., Galun, E., Ponchel, F., Yakicier, C., Ji, J., Ozturk, M.

https://openalex.org/W2049415808,"The cell cycle regulatory protein CksHs2 binds to the catalytic subunit of the cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk's) and is essential for their biological function. The crystal structure of the protein was determined at 2.1 A resolution. The CksHs2 structure is an unexpected hexamer formed by the symmetric assembly of three interlocked dimers into an unusual 12-stranded beta barrel fold that may represent a prototype for this class of protein structures. Sequence-conserved regions form the unusual beta strand exchange between the subunits of the dimer, and the metal and anion binding sites associated with the hexamer assembly. The two other sequence-conserved regions line a 12 A diameter tunnel through the beta barrel and form the six exposed, charged helix pairs. Six kinase subunits can be modeled to bind the assembled hexamer without collision, and therefore this CksHs2 hexamer may participate in cell cycle control by acting as the hub for Cdk multimerization in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1501449620,"To examine the role of the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) in mediating insulin biological responsiveness, we generated Chinese hamster ovary cell lines expressing antisense IRS-1 RNA. These cells displayed morphological alterations as well as markedly reduced growth rates compared to the parental cells. Furthermore, the antisense IRS-1 cell lines had decreased insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, reduced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation, and decreased thymidine incorporation relative to the parental cell line. Insulin-dependent transcriptional regulation of a serum response element/luciferase reporter construct (SRE-Luc) was also reduced in the antisense IRS-1-expressing cell lines. However, co-transfection with a plasmid directing the expression of rat IRS-1 fully restored insulin-stimulated SRE-Luc activity in the IRS-1 antisense cell lines. Thus, the inhibition in insulin signaling was a specific effect of decreased IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Taken together, these data demonstrate that insulin regulation of mitogenic signaling requires the functional expression of IRS-1 and documents its central importance in the insulin intracellular signaling pathway."

Here, the prp2+ gene has been cloned by its ability to complement the temperature-sensitive growth defect of a prp2- mutant. The gene also corrects the pre-mRNA splicing defect of prp2- mutants and encodes a 59-kilodalton polypeptide (PRP2). A molecular characterization indicates that PRP2 is a previously uncharacterized yeast splicing factor with extensive similarity to the mammalian splicing factor U2AF65. Thus, this study provides evidence that a U2AF homolog participates in RNA processing in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2133948569,"The astrocyte of the newborn rat brain has proven to be a versatile system in which to study glycogen biogenesis. We have taken advantage of the rapid stimulation of glycogen synthesis that occurs when glucose is fed to astrocytes, and the marked limitation on this synthesis that occurs in astrocytes previously exposed to ammonium ions. These observations have been related to our earlier reports of the initiation of glycogen synthesis on a protein primer, glycogenin, and the discovery of a low-molecular-weight form of glycogen, proglycogen. The following conclusions have been drawn: 1) In the ammonia-treated astrocytes starved of glucose, free glycogenin is present. 2) When these astrocytes are fed with glucose, proglycogen is synthesized from the glycogenin primer by a glycogen-synthase-like UDPglucose transglucosylase activity (proglycogen synthase) distinct from the well-recognized glycogen synthase, and synthesis stops at this point. 3) Proglycogen is the precursor of macromolecular glycogen, which is synthesized from proglycogen by glycogen synthase when glucose is fed to untreated astrocytes, accounting for the much greater accumulation of total glycogen. 4) The stimulus to proglycogen and macroglycogen synthesis that occurs on feeding glucose to untreated or ammonia-treated astrocytes is the result of the activation of proglycogen synthase, not of glycogen synthase. 5) Therefore, in the synthesis of macromolecular glycogen from glycogenin via proglycogen, the step between glycogenin and proglycogen is rate-limiting. 6) The discovery of additional potential control points in glycogen synthesis, now emerging, may assist the identification of so-far-unexplained aberrations of glycogen metabolism.—Lomako, J., Lomako, W.

A zymogenic mutant of tPA has been engineered that displays a reduction in catalytic efficiency by a factor of 141 in the single-chain form while retaining full activity in the cleaved form. The residues introduced in the mutant, serine 292 and histidine 305, are proposed to form a hydrogen-bonded network with aspartate 477, similar to the aspartate 194-histidine 40-serine 32 network found to stabilize the zymogen chymotrypsinogen."
https://openalex.org/W1588939300,"In cells infected by influenza virus type A, host cell protein synthesis declines rapidly and dramatically, while influenza viral protein synthesis occurs efficiently throughout infection. Previously, we had shown that the selective translation of influenza viral mRNAs in infected cells occurred in a cap-dependent manner and was due at least in part to structures inherent in the mRNAs. Using chimeras containing the noncoding and coding regions of cellular and viral mRNAs, we can now report that the selective translation is mediated by sequences within the 5'-untranslated regions (UTR) of the viral mRNAs. Polysome analysis confirmed that a 45-nucleotide sequence contained in the 5'-UTR of the influenza viral nucleocapsid protein was necessary and sufficient to allow the host cell translational machinery to discriminate between viral and cellular mRNAs. In reciprocal experiments in which the 5'-UTR of the cellular mRNA-secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase replaced the nucleocapsid protein 5'-UTR, viral protein synthesis was inhibited in virus-infected cells, resembling host protein synthesis. Finally, we demonstrated that the 5'-UTR of another influenza viral mRNA, that encoding the nonstructural protein, also conferred resistance to the shutoff of protein synthesis in influenza virus-infected cells."

Epistasis studies where 35S:TPASE is in trans with later-acting fusions indicate that transient effectiveness for excision results from this fusion inhibiting its own action and that of other TPASE sources. Inhibition depends on the strength of TPASE expression, since fusions of the 35S promoter to a TPASE cDNA accumulate 30-fold lower amounts of TPASE mRNA than the 35S:TPASE gene fusion and do not inhibit excision.

Gal4 transcriptional activator protein binds to the two consensus UAS sites whether GAL2 expression is induced, uninduced, or repressed by growth with different carbon sources. Although wild type strains show loss of the Gal4 protein-specific footprint in repressing media containing glucose, constitutive high level expression of Gal4 protein restores the GAL2 UAS footprints without fully derepressing GAL2 transcription. Thus binding of the Gal4 activator to target sites in the DNA is required but not sufficient for GAL2 derepression and induction.

https://openalex.org/W1675688787,"Cell-mediated contraction of tissues containing fibrillar collagene can lead to organ compromise and loss of function. The same process that is biologically advantageous during the contraction phase of wound healing can be subverted in diseases such as hepatic cirrhosis, pulmonary fibrosis, and scleroderma, although the cellular and molecular mechanism of matrix tissue contraction is difficult to study in such chronic diseases. However, certain human eye diseases that result in tractional detachment of the retina and loss of vision are characterized by acute cell-mediated contraction of collagenous tissue in the vitreous cavity. In this study, we demonstrate that human cells can contract vitreous, a complex biological gel containing type II collagen, in vitro. This cell-mediated contraction can be blocked by antibodies and peptides that antagonize the function of α2β1 integrin, and the potential for contraction can be conferred upon noncontracting cells by stable transfection of cells with α2 cDNA. We also show that this contractile process, if focally resisted, can result in remodeling vitreous from a gel to a structure that resembles a planar membrane, and that substantial isometric forces can be measured across this tissue. We propose that in diseases such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy and proliferative vitreoretinopathy, α2β1 integrin-mediated contraction of the vitreous and tension at the site of vitreoretinal attachments contribute to the terminal event of tractional retinal detachment. By extension, we propose that α2β1 integrin is a centrally important molecule in human diseases characterized by remodeling and contraction of collagenous tissue (i.e., fibrocontractive diseases).—Kupper, T.

https://openalex.org/W1481726451,"Triage of grant application at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is a process whereby an initial screening of applications by a scientific peer review group eliminates applications that are not competitive for awards. The process of application triage has been limited to those applications submitted to the NIH in response to an RFA (Request for Applications). A hypergeometric model was developed to determine the extent to which five, six, seven, or eight member triage teams or subsets of 12-to-20 member full committees could provide a statistically defensible triage decision. Although the intent of triage is to remove from review those applications that are noncompetitive, the model was weighted in favor of the applicant to minimize the likelihood that highly competitive applications would be eliminated. Within the assumptions and rules developed, it was determined that there was little likelihood that the latter would occur. For example, in the worst case scenario, the greatest probability that a highly competitive application would be knocked out of competition is P ≤ 0.014 in the case of a five-member triage subset of a 20-member committee. Using the latter case, the model was tested on a set of 73 applications that were submitted to the National Cancer Institute for action at the February 1993 National Cancer Advisory Board. The model selected for triage required that each application be assigned to five reviewers, that each reviewer be blinded to the review assignments of the other reviewers, and that four noncompetitive votes be registered to triage out an application. Each of 19 applications received four to five noncompetitive votes, and were triaged out of the review process. The remaining 54 applications were then reviewed according to the usual NIH review process. Four of the applications received three noncompetitive triage votes each and were either rated as not recommended for further consideration (NRF, n = 2)) or received priority scores e 250 (n = 2) (The smaller the priority score the better the technical merit). Thirteen of the 53 applications received two noncompetitive votes. Of the latter, two were not recommended for further consideration and the remaining 11 received priority scores between in excess of 200. The distribution of competitive applications was such that funding was limited to those applications with priority scores of less than 190. Thus, the data suggest that the conservative model is valid such that the likelihood of eliminating a highly competitive application from consideration for funding is remotely small. With this model, the process of triage is fair to applicants on the one hand and is also effective in reducing consultant workloads on the other. The model could be applied to many different types of review situations (private sponsors as well as federal), especially when few awards are to be issued relative to the number of competing applications.—Vener, K. J., Feuer, E. J., Gorelic, L. A statistical model validating triage for the peer review process: keeping the competitive applications in the review pipeline. FASEB J. 7: 1312-1319; 1993."
