https://openalex.org/W2038085058,"Modification of the ionic calcium concentration in the culture medium markedly alters the pattern of proliferation and differentiation in cultured mouse epidermal cells. When medium calcium is lowered to 0.05--0.1 mM, keratinocytes proliferate rapidly with a high growth fraction and do not stratify, but continue to synthesize keratin. The cells grow as a monolayer for several months and can be subcultured and cloned in low Ca++ medium. Ultrastructural examination of cells cultured under low Ca++ conditions reveals widened intercellular spaces, abundant microvilli and perinuclear organization of tonofilaments and cellular organelles. Desmosomes are absent. Epidermal cells growing as a monolayer in low Ca++ can be induced to terminally differentiate by adding calcium to the level normally found in the culture medium (1.2 mM). Cell-to-cell contact occurs rapidly and desmosomes form within 2 hr. The cells stratify by 1--2 days and terminally differentiate with cell sloughing by 3--4 days. After Ca++ addition, DNA synthesis decreases with a lag of 5--10 hr and is totally inhibited within 34 hr. In contrast, RNA and protein synthesis continue at 40--50% of the low Ca++ level at day 3, a time when many cells are detaching from the culture dish. Keratin synthesis is unaffected by the Ca++ switch."

Pulse labeling these neurons with radioactive amino acid indicates that the two hormones and their respective neurophysin carrier proteins are synthesized as parts of separate precursor proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2038597359,"A factor necessary for the accurate transcription of cloned Xenopus 5S genes in vitro has been isolated from soluble extracts of X. Iaevis ovaries. The activity of the factor was monitored by its ability to facilitate transcription of exogenous 5S genes in unfertilized egg extracts which are otherwise incompetent for 5S gene transcription. The factor was purified via ion exchange chromatography, and apparently consists of a 37,000 dalton polypeptide. This factor is necessary for the transcription of both the oocyte-type and somatic-type 5S genes of Xenopus, but is not required for, and has no detectable effect upon, the transcription of a cloned Xenopus tRNA1Met gene. The site of action of the factor has been investigated using the “footprinting” method of Galas and Schmitz, 1978 Galas D. Schmitz A. DNase footprinting: a simple method for the detection of protein-DNA binding specificity. Nucl. Acids Res. 1978; 5: 3157-3170 Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar . The factor binds specifically to intragenic regions extending, approximately, from nucleotide positions 45 to 96 on both somatic and oocyte-type 5S genes. Additionally, this binding occurs independently of, and is not altered by, the presence of purified RNA polymerase III or unfertilized egg extracts.

These effects on histamine secretion and on protein phosphorylation were rapid in onset and both showed tachyphylaxis. Cromolyn may therefore act by altering the phosphorylation of a protein involved in the regulation of secretion."

https://openalex.org/W1968863181,"Platelet-activating factor (PAF), a naturally occurring phospholipid, is a potent activator of various biological processes, including platelet aggregation. The mechanisms by which PAF acts are largely unknown, partly because of the lack of specific inhibitors for PAF-elicited responses. It was found that in washed human platelets the psychotropic triazolobenzodiazepine drugs alprazolam and triazolam potently inhibited PAF-induced changes in shape, aggregation, and secretion. The effects were specific for PAF activation, since the responses of human platelets to adenosine diphosphate, thrombin, epinephrine, collagen, arachidonate, and the calcium ionophore A23187 were not inhibited by the triazolobenzodiazepines. These psychotropic drugs should be useful in investigating the possibility that PAF or PAF-like phospholipids play a role in neuronal function and in elucidating biochemical mechanisms activated specifically by PAF in a variety of cells."
https://openalex.org/W2053509698,"The DNA sequence of the 23S-5S rRNA intergenic region has been determined for two ribosomal RNA operons in E. coli. The spacer in both rrnX and rrnD∗ is 92 bp long; the sequences are identical except for two heterogeneities. 130 bp at the 3′ end of the 23S rRNA gene have also been sequenced. We observe that a region surrounding the 3′ end of 23S is complementary to sequences surrounding the 5′ end of the gene. This complementarity predicts a giant stem and loop structure closed by an almost perfectly double-stranded helix of 28 bp that includes both termini of mature 23S rRNA. Moreover, we find that this helix can be extended after a brief interruption to include a substantial number of additional residues from the two spacer regions flanking the 23S gene; interestingly, the extended structure involves sequences that are conserved in the distal portion of the two different types of 16S–23S spacer region—those containing tRNA1BAla and tRNA1Ile, and those with tRNA2Glu. We have also analyzed the ends of the precursor 23S RNA (23SIII) produced by in vitro RNAase III cleavage of the 30S pre-rRNA. The terminal sequences of 23SIII appear in the 28 bp helical region, several nucleotides beyond the 23S mature ends. Thus we propose that residues separated by the 2900 nucleotides of 23S rRNA come together to form a processing site for RNAase III in the ribosomal RNA precursor molecule."

https://openalex.org/W1485225530,"A specific cGMP binding protein from rat lung has been partially purified and characterized. The binding protein is clearly distinct from the cGMP-dependent protein kinase as determined by several of its characteristics such as chromatographic behavior and spatial requirements for cGMP binding. The protein has a sedimentation coefficient of 7.8 S, a Stokes radius of 5.5 nm, and an estimated M, = 177,000. A cGMP phosphodiesterase activity co-purifies with the binding protein through several steps (ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and sucrose density gradient centrifugation) and the possibility exists that these two activities may be functions of the same protein. Several lines of evidence indicate that the cGMP binding site is distinct from the phosphodiesterase catalytic site. First, 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine is a competitive inhibitor of cGMP for phosphodiesterase activity, while under similar conditions this compound increases cGMP binding. Other phosphodiesterase inhibitors also increase cGMP binding and these effects are not due to substrate protection. Second, the cGMP analogue 2’-0monobutyryl cGMP is an effective inhibitor of cGMP phosphodiesterase activity, but at the same concentration this compound has no effect on cGMP binding. Third, heat or trypsin treatment of the protein causes loss of cGMP phosphodiesterase activity, while both treatments increase cGMP binding. The characteristics of the cGMP binding protein-phosphodiesterase and its presence in several cell types, ie. sea urchin sperm and rat platelets, which appear to contain very low levels of cGMP-dependent protein kinase, suggest that this protein may have a physiological role in mediating cGMP action."

https://openalex.org/W1527467938,"A guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent protein kinase was purified from bovine lung using 8-(6-aminohexylamino)-cAMP-Sepharose. The activity of the purified enzyme was highly dependent on cGMP using histone f2b as a substrate. The self-phosphorylation of the purified enzyme was strongly inhibited by cGMP and not significantly affected by cAMP. A precipitating antiserum prepared in rabbits against the cGMP-dependent protein kinase specifically inhibited the histone kinase activity and the self-phosphorylation of the purified cGMP-dependent protein kinase without affecting the cGMP binding site. This antiserum also specifically inhibited the phosphorylation of the endogenous substrate proteins by endogenous cGMP-dependent protein kinase in smooth muscle membranes, but did not cross-react detectably with catalytic subunit or regulatory subunit of type I or type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Conversely, anti-sera against the regulatory subunit of type I or type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase did not cross-react detectably with cGMP-dependent protein kinase. The substantial differences between the immunological properties of the cGMP-dependent and cAMP-dependent protein kinases suggest that these two enzymes have distinct physiological roles."

https://openalex.org/W2026428797,"Rabbit alveolar macrophages internalize α-macroglobulin 125I-trypsin complexes subsequent to binding of complexes to high affinity surface receptors. Cells were capable of accumulating a 5–10 fold greater amount of αM · 125I-T at 37°C than at 0°C. At 0°C cell-bound αM · 125I-T was bound solely to surface receptors, whereas at 37°C the majority (85%) of cell-bound radioactivity was intracellular. The temperature-dependent accumulation of αM · 125I-T did not reflect a change in surface receptor number or ligand-receptor affinity. Rather, the greater rate of uptake reflected continued internalization of αM · 125I-T complexes. At 37°C cells took up 5–9 fmole αMT per μg cell protein per hr, whereas binding to surface receptors accounted for 0.5–0.7 fmole per μg cell protein. Once bound to surface receptors internalized αM · 125I-T was localized in lysosomes, where it was degraded at a rate of 35–45% per hr. Following binding of αM · T to receptors at 37°C, but not at 0°C, unoccupied receptors could be found on the cell surface. Using cycloheximide to probe receptor turnover, I calculated that receptors were replenished at a rate of 15% per hr. Cells incubated in the presence of cycloheximide exhibited unaltered ligand uptake and catabolism for hours. Thus the reappearance of receptor activity during ligand uptake was not primarily due to de novo receptor synthesis. The rate of ligand uptake was a function of the number of surface receptors. Measurement of αM125I-T binding to subcellular fractions did not reveal the presence of any intracellular reservoir of receptors. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that continued ligand uptake reflects receptor reutilization."
https://openalex.org/W2098310715,"Analogues of fatty acids have been synthesized which contain an S-S bridge in the aliphatic chain and at the omega-carbon the photoactivatable p-(3-trifluoromethyldiazirino)phenyl or p-azidophenyl group as a carbene and nitrene precursor, respectively. These acids were used to acylate 1-palmitoyl phosphatidylcholine by the procedure described by Gupta et al. (Gupta, C.M., Radhakrishnan, R., and Khorana, H.G. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 74, 4315-4319). Multilamellar liposomes prepared from various radioactively labeled lipids and 2 to 10 mol% of one of the photosensitive phospholipid analogues were photolyzed and the extent of cross-linking was determined. The carbene-generating probe labeled dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine in yields of 15 to 20%, while labeling with the nitrene probe was about 10 times less efficient. In contrast these probes were found to react with the unsaturated fatty acid of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine with almost equal efficiency. The nitrene was 2 to 3 times more efficient than the carbene in cross-linking to gramicidin A. Amino acid analysis and Edman degradation of the labeled peptide indicated that both probes predominantly attacked tryptophan residues. No geometrical correlation was found between the expected penetration of the reactive group of the probe within the bilayer and the labeled sites of the peptide. This result is discussed in terms of chemical selectivities of the photoactivated intermediates. After photocross-linking, the disulfide bridge can be cleaved to generate a free sulfhydryl group which subsequently can be utilized for preparative or analytical purposes. Photolabeled lipids and peptides can be separated easily from the bulk of the unlabeled material. These phospholipid analogues are substrates for the phospholipid exchange protein isolated from calf liver. Transfer from sonicated dispersions of the analogues into an acceptor membrane was demonstrated. Individual monolayers can thus be labeled separately with these reagents."
https://openalex.org/W1488271004,"Glutathione labeled in each of its amino acid residues, the corresponding free amino acids, and gamma-glutamyl-amino acids were used to evaluate their renal basolateral transport and metabolism at physiological levels of glutathione. Recovery of label in the venous outflow was compared to that of co-administered inulin after a single-pass in vivo infusion of rat kidney. Metabolites of glutathione and of its constituent amino acids were determined. No net basolateral transport of glutathione was detected; instead there was extensive breakdown of glutathione by the actions of basolateral gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and dipeptidase. Glutamate and 5-oxoproline showed net basolateral uptake. Recoveries of 35S greater than those of inulin were found after perfusion of [35S]cysteine and [35S]glutathione suggesting rapid net tubular reabsorption of cyst(e)ine. Recovery of label from perfused [U-14C]glycine was equivalent to that of inulin consistent with little or no net flux. Co-administration of large amounts of unlabeled metabolites together with the labeled glutathiones led to label recoveries closer to those of inulin, consistent with competitive inhibition of labeled metabolite transport. Treatment of rats with an inhibitor of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase decreased basolateral glutathione metabolism and thus indirectly decreased transport of labeled metabolites. No net basolateral transport of gamma-glutamyl-amino acids was detected. Significant amounts of label perfused as [Glu-U-14C]glutathione appeared in the gamma-glutamyl-amino acid fraction of the renal venous outflows, providing direct evidence that glutathione is used in vivo for the formation of gamma-glutamyl-amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W2101465857,"Somatostatin is a 14 amino acid peptide hormone that is synthesized as part of a larger precursor, preprosomatostatin, which comprises about 120 amino acids. The overall organization of the precursor is conserved in many species in that it consists of a signal peptide followed by a proregion of 90-100 amino acids and the mature hormone is located at the carboxyl terminus of the molecule. To understand the role of the propeptide in generating the mature hormone, we have used gene-transfer experiments to introduce angler fish preprosomatostatin into mammalian cells. Here we report the results of transfection of COS-7 cells with an SV40 expression vector containing preprosomatostatin cDNA cloned into the VP-1 late gene. Analysis of the parameters of somatostatin gene expression showed that COS cells synthesized prosomatostatin, which was detected intracellularly; the prosomatostatin, was proteolytically processed to mature somatostatin; and the mature hormone was secreted by the COS cells into the tissue culture medium. Our results suggest that COS cells, which do not normally secrete polypeptide hormones, contain the necessary proteolytic processing enzymes to convert preprosomatostatin to the mature hormone and the cellular apparatus necessary for its secretion."

The membrane-impermeant enzyme lactoperoxidase was used to radioiodinate the outer surfaces of intact cells and endocytic vesicles, as well as both sides of total microsomal membranes. Proteolytically and chemically produced fragments of the receptor polypeptides were analyzed to identify the tyrosine residues modified in each case. The results reveal that each of these receptors is a transmembrane glycoprotein arranged with its NH2 terminus facing the cytoplasm and its COOH terminus, containing the carbohydrate-binding site, exposed at the cell surface. While the primary structures of the chicken and rat receptors are highly homologous in the extracellular portions of the proteins, the cytoplasmic domains show no sequence similarity."
https://openalex.org/W1553656232,"The stimulatory and inhibitory regulatory components of adenylyl cyclase (Ns and Ni), purified to apparent homogeneity without the use of regulatory ligands such as Mg, NaF, and guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate, were tested for GTPase activity by incubating them with [gamma-32P]GTP and measuring 32Pi liberation using a charcoal adsorption assay to separate hydrolyzed from nonhydrolyzed radioactivity. We found that Ni is capable of hydrolyzing GTP. The activity was shown to be due to Ni itself and not to presence of one of its minor contaminants by correlating activity with abundance of the 40,000 Da alpha i subunit throughout the last stages of purification and by showing co-migration on a sucrose density gradient of the GTP-hydrolyzing activity with the alpha i, beta, and gamma subunits of Ni and not with any one of three minor contaminants present in the preparation tested. Preparations of Ns, free of detectable Ni, exhibited less than 10% the capacity to hydrolyze GTP, as compared to Ni on an equal protein basis. The basic properties of the GTP-hydrolyzing activity of Ni were determined. The activity is dependent on Mg ion (apparent Km = 5 to 15 nM), and is rapidly lost upon incubation with Mg2+ in the absence of GTP. MgGTP and free GTP serve equally well as substrate (apparent Km about 40 nM). Isotopic dilution studies indicate that the GTP binding site has a relative affinity for guanine nucleotides in the order GTP = GTP gamma S greater than GDP = GMP-P(NH)P greater than GDP beta S with the highest difference (GTP versus GDP beta S) being about 10-fold. NaF inhibited GTP hydrolysis by Ni at concentrations at which it activates Ni in intact membranes."

Hydroxylysine was identified in an acid hydrolysate of somatostatin-28 by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Fast-atom bombardment mass spectrometry indicated that the two forms of somatostatin-28 have molecular weights of 3220 and 3204, representing the hydroxylated and nonhydroxylated peptides, respectively. The location of the hydroxylated lysine was deduced by analysis of proteolytic fragments to be position 23.

https://openalex.org/W1494009772,"A Ca2+-pumping ATPase has been shown to be an integral component of skeletal muscle sarcolemma. The enzyme is stimulated by calmodulin and inhibited by micromolar concentrations of vanadate. The presence of calmodulin results in the transition of the AT-Pase to a high Ca2+ affinity state; removal of calmodulin reverses this effect. The Ca2+-ATPase and the Ca2+ uptake associated with it are also regulated by a specific cAMP-dependent phosphorylation system. The phosphorylation of the membrane enhances the Ca2+-ATPase activity. The effect is reversible. Three sarcolemmal proteins (Mr 35,000, 28,000, and 26,000) were identified as specific substrates of the cAMP-dependent phosphorylation system. The sarcolemmal Ca2+-ATPase was isolated by means of a calmodulin affinity chromatography column as a protein band of Mr of about 140,000, which could be eluted from the column by EDTA. The band possesses Ca2+-ATPase activity and is phosphorylated with [gamma-32P]ATP in a Ca2+-dependent manner.

https://openalex.org/W1485475852,"This manuscript describes the use of a solid phase radioimmunoassay for serological analysis of chromosomal components. The applicability of this assay for various studies on nonhistone chromosomal proteins, histones, and chromatin subunits is illustrated. By this technique it is possible to detect and quantify nuclear antigens in the nanogram range. The assay has all the inherent sensitivity and precision of radioimmunoassays and, as such, introduces a new, convenient method for serological analyses of chromosomal components. The results presented reconfirm the serological similarity among the HMG (high mobility group) proteins derived from various sources. The amount of HMG proteins present in mononucleosomes purified from calf thymus is similar to that present in mononucleosomes purified from HeLa cells, suggesting that various tissues contain similar amounts of these proteins. Per nucleosome, dinucleosomes and trinucleosomes contain as much HMG-1 protein as mononucleosomes, suggesting that the protein is not exclusively associated with those regions of DNA which have been solubilized by micrococcal nuclease. Part of the antigenic determinants present in HMG-1 forming a complex in the nucleosomal conformation do not interact with antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2014175070,The nature of the antigenic specificities of several antigens associated with the T/t complex in the mouse were analyzed by means of glycosidase and haptene inhibition studies. Results indicate that on testicular cells sugar residues are involved in at least six different T/t antigenic determinants. The immunodominant sugar appears to be different for each of the specificities. The specificity for the following T/t antigens resides predominantly in the sugars indicated: T: sialic acid; t12: β-D-galactose; tw32: β-D-galactose; t0: L-fucose; tw1: N-acetyl-D-galactosamine; tw18: L-fucose. It seems probable that these sugars are found at the terminal reducing ends of the carbohydrate portion of T/t-bearing molecules. These studies imply that at least some of the genes in the T locus code for glycosyltransferases or regulators of glycosyltransferases which modify oligosaccharide structures and impart specificity to the T/t antigens by alteration of their terminal sugar residues.

At least three of the remaining RNAs synthesized in vivo arise by some type of processing reaction. The processed species contain, as determined by oligonucleotide analysis, the information for the gene VIII protein and the 3'-terminal oligonucleotide expected for a transcription termination event at the rho-independent site following gene VIII. The two primary transcripts which could be analyzed also have this same 3'-terminal oligonucleotide. These results suggest that the processed mRNAs are the 3'-terminal cleavage products of primary transcripts which had terminated at the rho-independent site."

A detailed characterization and a study of requirements for the expression of pyrophosphate exchange and pyrophosphorolysis reactions indicated that a variety of RNA and DNA template-primers supported these catalytic reactions. Furthermore, hydrogen bonding of template to primer was essential, although RNA:RNA template-primers, e.g. poly(rA) . (rU)9 or 70 S RNA . tRNA complex, were not utilized for these reactions. AMV enzyme required Mg2+, and RLV enzyme Mn2+, as the preferred divalent metal ion for the expression of these activities. Response of various catalytic reactions to site-specific inhibitors revealed that polymerization and pyrophosphate exchange reactions were susceptible to reagents that affected either the substrate or the template binding site, intrinsic zinc, or sulfhydryl groups. RNase H and pyrophosphorolysis activities, on the other hand, exhibited susceptibility only to the template site-specific reagent. We, therefore, conclude that RNase H and pyrophosphorolysis reactions are catalyzed through the template binding site while polymerization and pyrophosphate exchange reactions require additional participation of the substrate binding site, as well as that of intrinsic zinc and the presence of reactive sulfhydryl groups."
https://openalex.org/W1578001391,"Abstract Highly purified chromaffin granule ghosts contain about 100 (89.1-110.2, n = 8) nmol of long-chain free fatty acids/mg of protein. About 40% of the fatty acids were mono- and polyunsaturated, of which arachidonate accounted for approximately 20%. Incubation with fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin selectively depleted the ghosts of unsaturated fatty acids. The effect of a series of long-chain fatty acids on energy coupling was studied in resealed chromaffin granule ghosts energized by MgATP. Their effectiveness in inhibiting the generation of the transmembrane proton concentration gradient and transmembrane potential was found to be correlated with their chain length and degree of unsaturation, all-cis-5,8,11,14-icosatetraenoate (arachidonate) and all-cis-5,8,11,14,-17-icosapentaenoate being most effective. Arachidonate was also found to dissipate an artificially generated pH gradient. Treatment of chromaffin granule ghosts with bovine serum albumin increased the transmembrane proton concentration gradient that could be generated by MgATP. This enhanced response to MgATP is presumably due to the removal of free fatty acids from the ghosts. Considering the potency of arachidonate and other unsaturated fatty acids, as well as their high endogenous content, these uncoupling agents should be accounted for when isolated chromaffin granules are used for in vitro studies on energy coupling."

In the presence of cycloheximide, cholera toxin increased intracellular cyclic AMP about 50-fold. Qualitatively similar potentiation of cholera toxin action by cycloheximide was observed in isolated swine aortic vascular smooth muscle cells. Cycloheximide, by itself, had no effect upon cyclic AMP levels and did not alter the apparent Ka for cyclic AMP generation by cholera toxin in the cells. Also, cycloheximide did not appear to augment cholera toxin action via inhibition of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase. Puromycin and actinomycin D also augmented cholera toxin action in C6-2B cells. Potentiation of cholera toxin-increased cyclic AMP formation by cycloheximide was correlated with the inhibition of [14C]leucine incorporation into protein. These results indicate that the ability of cholera toxin to stimulate cyclic AMP production in C6-2B astrocytoma and swine vascular smooth muscle cells is enhanced by inhibition of de novo protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1565130278,The stereochemistry of the hydrogen abstraction in the vitamin K-dependent carboxylation of synthetic peptides has been investigated; the carboxylation rates of various peptidic substrates containing a stereospecifically 4-monodeuterated glutamic acid residue have been compared to that of nondeuterated peptides. A significant isotope effect was found only with the substrates containing (4S)-4-deuterated glutamic acid. These data reveal that the rat liver microsomal vitamin K-dependent carboxylase acts stereospecifically in abstracting the 4-pro-S hydrogen of the glutamyl residue. The low values of the measured isotope effects indicate that the hydrogen abstraction does not constitute a limiting step in the carboxylation mechanism.

The rate of phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis is only slightly inhibited, whereas that of lysylphosphatidylglycerol is somewhat stimulated. As expected, decreased phosphatidylglycerol synthesis results in the inhibition of the formation of the putative lipoteichoic acid precursor, sn-glycero-1-phospho-beta-gentiobiosyldiacyglycerol and of lipoteichoic acid itself."
