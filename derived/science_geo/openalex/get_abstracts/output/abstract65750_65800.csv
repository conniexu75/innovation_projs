https://openalex.org/W1518714509,"A gas chromatographic procedure has been developed for the quantitative analysis of submicrogram amounts of the phenylthiohydantoins of all the amino acids except arginine. The compounds are divided into three groups according to their volatility and need for derivatization (trimethylsilylation). The more volatile, relatively nonpolar thiohydantoins (Group I) are chromatographed with best results on columns coated with the stationary phase DC-560. For polar thiohydantoins of lower volatility (Group II), XE-60 is a much more suitable phase. The third group consists of thiohydantoins for which trimethylsilylation prior to analysis is either mandatory (aspartic, glutamic, and cysteic acids) or helpful (serine, S-carboxymethylcysteine, threonine, and lysine derivatives). A two column system employing the above stationary phases has been applied to the analysis of porcine thyrocalcitonin which was degraded by the threestage form of the Edman procedure. In addition, a single column system has been developed utilizing a blend of three silicone phases which allows identification of all three groups of thiohydantoins in two 50-min runs (before and after trimethylsilylation)."

The diffusion coefficients of nonelectrolytes are reduced by the same factor, showing that the diffusion of the ions is retarded by physical, rather than chemical, interactions. In contrast, the diffusivity of the calcium ion, which is taken up by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, is reduced fiftyfold."
https://openalex.org/W2012920259,Intracisternal injections of 6-hydroxydopamine produce rapid and long-lasting depletion of brain catecholamines without effects on serotonin concentrations. Depletion of norepinephrine is greatest in areas containing only nerve terminals and axons and least in areas containing monoamine cell bodies. The norepinephrine loss is accompanied by electron microscopic evidence of nerve terminal degeneration and decreased turnover. Dopamine loss is less marked and is not accompanied by degeneration or alteration of turnover rate.

https://openalex.org/W1557119857,"Abstract The synthesis of 28S and 18S ribosomal RNA in human lymphocytes was investigated under resting conditions and at various times during cell growth induced by phytohemagglutinin. The currently accepted model for ribosomal RNA production in animal cells holds that both 28 S and 18 S subtypes are synthesized as part of a single 45 S precursor, thus predicting their synthesis in 1:1 molar ratio. Deviations from this ratio are taken to indicate rapid degradation, after synthesis, of one species in excess of the other. With the use of methionine-methyl-3H as a means of labeling newly synthesized rRNA, the following observations were made: 1. In resting lymphocytes about one half of the newly synthesized 18 S rRNA was immediately degraded, confirming a previous report. 2. Upon addition of the growth stimulant, phytohemagglutinin, the degree of rRNA wastage began to diminish almost immediately. The least degradation was observed after 6 to 7 hours of stimulation. 3. After 20 hours of incubation with PHA, rRNA wastage was still low, but had risen to a level significantly above that found at 6 to 7 hours. After 40 hours, at a time when maximal cell growth was in progress, rRNA wastage was almost as high as that in resting cells. 4. Addition of excess phytohemagglutinin during maximal growth did not reverse the wastage of rRNA. However, when the cells were permitted to incubate for 9 days, at which time growth activity was reduced to nearly resting levels, rRNA wastage was again promptly reduced by readdition of phytohemagglutinin. It is concluded that reduction of rRNA wastage is an early event in stimulation of lymphocyte growth, but that rRNA wastage is not incompatible with cell growth under conditions of elevated rRNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1540430903,"Abstract Examination of the reactions of protein disulfide sulfur led to the implication of three mechanisms in the removal of sulfur from cystinyl residues. (a) Persulfide formation in alkali with subsequent loss of the reactive persulfide sulfur; (b) organic thiocyanate formation by direct attack of CN-, followed by elimination of SCN- by OH- or by appropriately located intraprotein nucleophiles; and (c) sulfite reduction of disulfide bonds with formation of S-sulfocysteinyl residues, followed by elimination of thiosulfate. Spectral as well as kinetic evidence was obtained for persulfide formation from a variety of disulfide compounds. The ease of persulfide formation correlated with the ability of base to abstract a proton from the carbon atom β to the disulfide bond. Evidence was obtained indicating that sulfur eliminated from cystine or cystinyl residues in vivo occupies a metabolic branch point. Incorporation into cystine of the labeled outer sulfur atom of thiosulfate, the corresponding labeled sulfur in the form of tetrathionate, and labeled elemental sulfur occurred in vivo. Unlabeled sulfide failed to suppress the level of radioactivity incorporated and the inner atom of thiosulfate failed to be incorporated. Evaluation of the time course of incorporation as well as the chemical reactivities of the various sulfur species led to the proposal of protein-coated elemental sulfur as a retained intermediate in mammalian sulfur metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W2051531865,The refrcactory period of neurons mediating an electrically elicited behavior (self-stimulation) was estimated by varying the intrapair pulse separation in a stimulating train made up of pulse pairs and measuring the intensity of the elicited behavior. Two neuronal systems with different refractory periods were indicated. Single-unit recording in acute preparations stimulated through self-stimulation electrodes revealed primarily two classes of units. Each class gave refractory period estimates characteristic of one of the behaviorally indicated systems. The experiments illustrate a technique for establishing functional relations between single units in the brain and gross behavior.

https://openalex.org/W1614744152,"Abstract Treatment of 14C-uniformly labeled cell walls of Penicillium chrysogenum with chitobiase-containing chitinase resulted in 73% solubilization. The solubilized components were isolated, identified, and determined quantitatively. N-Acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N,N'-diacetylchitobiose ((GlcNAc)2) accounted for 42% of the cell wall. Since kinetic analysis showed that GlcNAc arose from (GlcNAc)2, at least 42% of the cell wall contains GlcNAc in β-d-(1 → 4)-glycosidic linkage. When the same experiment was performed with a chitobiase-free chitinase preparation nearly identical results were obtained, except, as expected, essentially all of the GlcNAc was present as (GlcNAc)2. Small amounts of glucose and laminaritriose were also released. In addition, a nondialyzable component, Fraction 5A, accounting for 14% of the wall, was isolated. This fraction, devoid of GlcNAc, contains 20 times the amount of galactose and 2 times the amount of mannose with respect to glucose found in cell wall hydrolysates. An additional 13% of the wall was solubilized when the cell wall residue, following treatment with chitinase, was treated with chitinase-free β-d-(1 → 3)-glucanase. Therefore, 86% of the wall was solubilized when treated first with chitinase, then with β-d-(1 → 3)-glucanase. Initial treatment of cell walls with β-d-(1 → 3)-glucanase resulted in 48% solubilization. From an analysis of the solubilized components the conclusion was reached that at least 40% of the wall contains glucose in β-d-(1 → 3)-glycosidic linkage. An additional 44% of the wall was solubilized when the residue, following treatment with β-d-(1 → 3)-glucanase, was treated with chitinase. Thus, 92% of the wall was solubilized when treated first with β-d-(1 → 3)-glucanase, then with chitinase. The observations that β-d-(1 → 3)-glucanase-free chitinase released in addition to GlcNAc and (GlcNAc)2 also glucose, laminaritriose, and a fraction containing mannose, galactose, and glucose (Fraction 5A) and that treatment of this fraction with β-d-(1 → 3)-glucanase released glucose and laminaribiose suggest that glucose may exist in cell walls in one or more forms other than the major glucan. From the available data it is not clear whether Fraction 5A contains one or several polymers. An analysis of the monomeric cell wall constituents released by acid hydrolysis is in excellent agreement with the results obtained by enzymatic digestion. These results showed the cell wall to contain about 48% glucosamine and about 52% neutral hexoses, which consisted of glucose, galactose, and mannose in the molar proportion of 10:1:2. Thus, if 40% of the wall is glucose, then galactose and mannose account for 4% and 8% of the wall, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1604389497,"Abstract Proton magnetic resonance studies at 220 MHz have shown that the conformation of flavin adenine dinucleotide in D2O-dioxane-d-8 (70:30, v/v) solutions is in agreement with the model proposed by Sarma, Dannies, and Kaplan (Biochemistry, 7, 4359 (1968)) for D2O solution. The determination of the temperature dependence of the FAD, flavin mononucleotide, and adenosine diphosphoribose proton shifts were found to be necessary for a correct assignment of the isoalloxazine protons in FAD and hence for determining the conformation. The FAD proton shifts in D2O solutions have a sigmoid dependence on temperature which is discussed in terms of a two-state model, where an equilibrium exists between the folded and unfolded states of the molecule. Sigmoid curves are not observed in D2O-dioxane solutions, suggesting that dioxane lowers the transition temperature. Dioxane decreases the fraction of folded FAD molecules in solution by lowering the energy barrier between the two states and also reduces the intermolecular stacking of FAD and FMN. Line broadening of the adenine AC8H proton in ADP-ribose is observed and may be interpreted in terms of rotational isomers in solution."
https://openalex.org/W1545106717,"Abstract Bovine parathyroid gland slices incubated in vitro have been shown to synthesize parathyroid hormone. The incorporation of several radioactive amino acids into the hormone isolated from the tissue was found to vary inversely with the concentration of calcium present in the incubation medium. The identity of the newly synthesized hormone with parathyroid hormone was established by several lines of evidence, including a demonstration of calcium-mobilizing activity in the parathyroidectomized rat. The stimulatory effect of lowered calcium concentration was directed more to incorporation of amino acid into the hormone than into the general protein of the tissue. Examination of the incubation medium indicated significant incorporation of amino acid into soluble protein, but this was unaffected by calcium concentration. The presence of hormone in the incubation medium could not be demonstrated either by attempted isolation or by assays for biological activity."
https://openalex.org/W1501777862,"Abstract Fasting, as well as adrenalectomy, induced an increased rate of glyceride-glycerol synthesis from pyruvate in rat adipose tissue. When both treatments were combined, the elevation in the rate of glycerogenesis was more than additive. The activity of cytosol pyruvate carboxylase rose in tissues of adrenalectomized rats but not in those of fasted rats. P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase activity, on the other hand, was elevated by both treatments, and reached maximum values in adrenalectomized, fasted rats. The results suggest that the increase in glycerogenesis in fasted, adrenalectomized rats was due to increases in the activities of both pyruvate carboxylase and P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase. The effects of fasting and of adrenalectomy on P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase were both counteracted by corticosteroids and by actinomycin D. Corticosteroids were more effective than actinomycin, causing a faster decline and depressing enzyme activity to lower levels. This effect of corticosteroids on P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase was prevented by simultaneous administration of actinomycin. Liver P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase was not elevated by adrenalectomy, but liver from the fasted, adrenalectomized animals had a higher activity of this enzyme than did liver from the fasted rats. Contrary to the activity of the adipose tissue enzyme, the liver enzyme activity increased after short time intervals (2½ hours) following corticosteroid treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1591994153,"Abstract The first paper in this series (Chin, C. C., and Warren, J. C., J. Biol. Chem., 243, 5056 (1968)) described the synthesis of 4-mercuri-17β-estradiol and demonstrated that it could be used for affinity labeling of steroid binding sites. The present report describes the biological activity of the mercury steroid and its interaction with primary uterine receptor proteins. When 17β-estradiol, 4-mercuri-17β-estradiol, and the mercaptide of 4-mercuri-17β-estradiol with 2-mercaptoethanol were applied intraluminally to the uteri of ovariectomized rats, all induced glucose-6-P dehydrogenase and 6-P-gluconate dehydrogenase. A dose-response analysis with 17β-estradiol showed that the effect observed with the mercury steroids could not be the result of contamination with 17β-estradiol. The increased glucose-6-P dehydrogenase activity induced by 4-mercuri-17β-estradiol and 4-(2-hydroxyethylmercapto)mercuri-17β-estradiol was not seen after administration of either p-mercuribenzoate or its mercaptide. 4-Mercuri-17β-estradiol was more persistent in its activity than 17β-estradiol but did not achieve so high a level of maximal stimulation. Morphological examination of uterine tissue after treatment with 4-mercuri-17β-estradiol revealed the classic histological effects seen after similar administration of 17β-estradiol. After injection of 4-mercuri-17β-estradiol-6,7-3H and subsequent steroid extraction, no significant amount of radioactivity was found associated with free 17β-estradiol, indicating that cleavage in vivo of the carbon-mercury bond did not occur. Levels of uterine glycogen were enhanced by 4-mercuri-17β-estradiol, but not by p-mercuribenzoate. Again, the mercury steroid was not so potent as 17β-estradiol but maintained its maximal action over a prolonged period of time. Binding of 4-mercuri-17β-estradiol to the cytoplasmic receptor protein of immature rat uterus was demonstrated; pretreatment with 17β-estradiol abolished this binding. The results demonstrate that 4-mercuri-17β-estradiol mimics 17β-estradiol in the production of several biological responses and in the nature of its binding to soluble uterine receptor sites. The mercury derivative can, therefore, be used for identification of target organ receptor proteins and study of their role in the mechanism of estrogen action."
https://openalex.org/W1601603318,"Abstract The crystalline enzyme uridine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase from calf liver has been shown to be polydisperse. The more rapidly sedimenting components that are present have been shown to be multimers of the basic pyrophosphorylase molecule. Evidence for multimers has come from (a) ultracentrifugal analysis, (b) protein and activity patterns by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugal analysis, and (c) redistribution of the sucrose-separable material. Hydrodynamic studies of the principal component in the ultracentrifuge have yielded extrapolated values of 14.10 to 14.45 S for the sedimentation coefficient and 2.72 to 2.87 x 10-7 cm2 per sec for the diffusion coefficient. Combination of these values yielded a molecular weight of about 480,000. Dissociation in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and 0.1 m mercaptoethanol has yielded subunits with a sedimentation coefficient of 2.14 S and a diffusion coefficient of 2.90 x 10-7 cm2 per sec. A combination of these values produced a molecular weight of 69,100. Estimates obtained by low speed sedimentation equilibrium were 67,500 for both the weight and z-average molecular weights. Electron micrographs have indicated the presence of tetramers. The results are discussed in relationship to an octomer model."
https://openalex.org/W1562399353,"Abstract Incorporation of 14C-leucine, injected intraperitoneally into rats, reached a plateau in 30 min in the liver mitochondrial fractions. Part of the mitochondrial soluble protein, amounting to about 6% of the total protein, was labeled more rapidly by 14C-l-leucine than the rest of the protein. Thyroidectomy produced a decrease in the rate of labeling of all the fractions. A single dose of l-thyroxine (0.52 µg per g) stimulated the incorporation in the above rapidly labeled fractions of soluble protein distinctly within 60 min without appreciably affecting the other protein fractions. Respiratory rate during active phosphorylation of ADP (active or State 3 respiration) and after ADP was completely converted to ATP (controlled or State 4 respiration) were proportionately depressed in thyroidectomy, but only controlled respiration was increased after thyroxine treatment."

https://openalex.org/W1540794543,"Abstract A soluble enzyme from the small intestine of the pig, capable of conjugating uridine diphosphate glucuronic acid with 17β-estradiol, has been purified 5- to 10-fold. The glucuronide formed was identified as 17β-estradiol 3-monoglucuronide by paper chromatography and microchemical reactions. This estrogen glucuronyltransferase is present in the 150,000 x g supernatant and shows an absolute requirement for UDP-glucuronic acid. The glucuronidation reaction is optimal in Tris-HCl buffer between pH 8.0 and 8.6. Magnesium ions and cysteine increase the activity of the enzyme; p-chloromercuribenzoate and iodoacetamide are inhibitors of the enzyme. Km values were found to be 0.74 x 10-5 m for 17β-estradiol and 0.84 x 10-4 m for UDP-glucuronic acid. The glucuronyltransferase is stable for at least 3 months at -20°, while it loses 50% of its initial activity within 20 days when kept at +5°. The enzyme shows a temperature optimum of 42°. The reaction has an activation energy of 15 kcal per mole within the range of 22° to 42°. ATP competes with UDP-glucuronic acid for the enzyme, whereas UDP inhibits the enzyme noncompetitively. The following steroidal and nonsteroidal substrates are not attacked to any significant extent by the estrogen glucuronyltransferase: estriol, 17α-estradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone, testosterone, bilirubin, and p-nitrophenol. However, estrone is conjugated by the enzyme and also acts as a competitive inhibitor of the glucuronidation of 17β-estradiol; the inhibition constant, Ki, for estrone was calculated to be 0.79 x 10-5 m. The similarity of the Ki value for estrone and the Km value for 17β-estradiol makes it likely that only one enzyme catalyzes the glucuronidation of both 17β-estradiol and estrone."

https://openalex.org/W2050418223,"Intracerebral injections of puromycin produced memory deficits in naive quail trained to discriminate between red and green stimuli. Puromycin aminonucleoside, acetoxycycloheximide, and saline had no such effect. After a single reversal of the visual cues, naive quail treated with puromycin performed better than control birds. Also, puromycin had no effect on performance when injected into previously trained animals. High doses both of puromycin and acetoxycycloheximide inhibited ribonucleic acid and protein synthesis to a similar extent, while low doses of puromycin inhibited only protein synthesis. Since only puromycin inhibited memory, the basis for its effect appears more likely to be mediated by the action of peptidyl-puromycin rather than by the quantitative inhibition of macromolecular synthesis or by some nonspecific toxic action."
https://openalex.org/W1559928897,"Abstract Streptococcal proteinase was shown to belong to a group of enzymes such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, and subtilisin that exhibit a high ratio of esterase to peptidase activity. In this respect, streptococcal proteinase is different from other sulfhydryl enzymes, such as papain and ficin, and also different from pepsin. These enzymes hydrolyze a specific ester and amide substrate at comparable rates. A spectrophotometric method is described for following the streptococcal proteinase-catalyzed hydrolysis of substrates of the general type benzyloxycarbonyl-X-Y, where X is lysine, norleucine, and glutamic acid, and Y is phenyl, p-nitrophenyl, aniline, and p-nitroaniline. This method was used to demonstrate that streptococcal proteinase is an efficient esterase in the cleavage of phenyl and p-nitrophenyl esters, and that in the cleavage of these esters the enzyme is favored by the presence of a cationic group in X. Phenyl esters were found to be more versatile substrates than p-nitrophenyl esters for the proteinase, since autolysis of phenyl ester substrates was not observed even at higher pH values (pH 9.0). The effect of pH on the proteinase-catalyzed hydrolyses of benzyloxycarbonylysyl-p-nitrophenyl esters was examined. The data revealed that the ratio of log kcat/Km for the enzyme depends on an ionizable group with a pK of 4.8. When the leaving group, Y, in A-X-Y is changed from phenyl to p-nitrophenyl, kcat/Km values increase 5-fold. However, when Y is changed from aniline to p-nitroaniline, the kcat/Km value unexpectedly decreases 36-fold. Wang's theory of pretransition state protonation was used to interpret these data, and it is proposed that streptococcal proteinase hydrolyzes specific ester or amide substrates by different mechanisms. Tosylnorleucylphenylalanine and tosyllysylphenyl ester were found to be resistant to cleavage by streptococcal proteinase. These two derivatives are competitive inhibitors of streptococcal proteinase, with Ki values near the kinetically determined value of Km(app) for the corresponding benzyloxycarbonyl derivatives."
https://openalex.org/W2017789600,It is doubtful that population growth will be halted sufficiently in either developing or developed countries. The will to regulate population is lacking. The freedom to reproduce when exercised too liberally by some individuals impinges on freedoms of the rest of the population. A population growth target designed merely to replace existing population must be established. In different countries a family size of between 2 and 3 children would be required. To control fertility effectively a social security system for older people is necessary especially in developing countries. As an incentive for couples to practice fertility regulation the correct family size could be established as the condition for participation in social security benefits at old age. For this system to be effective birth control measures must be widely available and cheap within the country.

https://openalex.org/W1518321370,"Abstract A proenzyme (hereafter propeptidase), with a high activity on N-acetyl-l-tyrosine ethyl ester, was found associated with proelastase through several steps of purification. Propeptidase is distinct from chymotrypsinogen A as shown by its electrophoretic mobility and its high resistance, in the activated form, to inhibition by l-1-tosylamido-2-phenyl-ethyl chloromethyl ketone. Evidence indicates that propeptidase is probably the proenzyme form of elastomucase. Activation of proelastase and propeptidase with trypsin changed their electrophoretic mobilities. The activated proelastase migrated at the same rate as authentic, pure elastase. The proenzymes that were originally highly insoluble could be solubilized by treatment with alumina Cγ gel. The solubilizing effect of alumina Cγ gel was reversible. The solubilized proenzymes could be reprecipitated by recombination with the eluate of alumina Cγ gel. Activation of the proenzymes had no effect on their precipitation with Cγ eluate. To a lesser degree, trypsin and chymotrypsinogen A also precipitated upon mixing them with Cγ eluate.
