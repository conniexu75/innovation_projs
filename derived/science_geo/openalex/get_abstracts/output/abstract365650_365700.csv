https://openalex.org/W2149561999,"Cortical gamma oscillations (20-80 Hz) predict increases in focused attention, and failure in gamma regulation is a hallmark of neurological and psychiatric disease. Current theory predicts that gamma oscillations are generated by synchronous activity of fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons, with the resulting rhythmic inhibition producing neural ensemble synchrony by generating a narrow window for effective excitation. We causally tested these hypotheses in barrel cortex in vivo by targeting optogenetic manipulation selectively to fast-spiking interneurons. Here we show that light-driven activation of fast-spiking interneurons at varied frequencies (8-200 Hz) selectively amplifies gamma oscillations. In contrast, pyramidal neuron activation amplifies only lower frequency oscillations, a cell-type-specific double dissociation. We found that the timing of a sensory input relative to a gamma cycle determined the amplitude and precision of evoked responses. Our data directly support the fast-spiking-gamma hypothesis and provide the first causal evidence that distinct network activity states can be induced in vivo by cell-type-specific activation. Gamma oscillations, synchronous activity rhythms in the neuronal network measured between 20 and 80 Hz, are active during information processing and attention, and are dysregulated in schizophrenia. What induces this activity band has been the subject of speculation and theory. Two papers in this issue report the use of cell-type-targeted optogenetic technologies to test the currently favoured theory — that these oscillations are generated by synchronous activity of fast-spiking (FS) interneurons, also known as parvalbumin-expressing interneurons. The results suggest that the theory is correct. Cardin et al. show that a gamma state can be driven by specific activation of FS interneurons in vivo, and that sensory input relative to these oscillations can determine the extent of evoked cortical activity. Sohal et al. report empirical evidence for the involvement of specific activation of FS interneurons in the production of gamma oscillations, and their data too suggest that gamma-based modulation of excitatory cells may enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in circuits. Cortical gamma oscillations (20–80 Hz) predict increases in focused attention, and failure in gamma regulation is a hallmark of neurological and psychiatric disease; however, what induces this activity band is unclear. Here, by using a cell-type targeted optogenetic approach, it is revealed that gamma oscillations can be driven by specific activation of fast-spiking interneurons in vivo, and that sensory input relative to these oscillations can determine the extent of evoked cortical activity."
https://openalex.org/W2047347093,"Synchronized oscillations and inhibitory interneurons have important and interconnected roles within cortical microcircuits. In particular, interneurons defined by the fast-spiking phenotype and expression of the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin have been suggested to be involved in gamma (30-80 Hz) oscillations, which are hypothesized to enhance information processing. However, because parvalbumin interneurons cannot be selectively controlled, definitive tests of their functional significance in gamma oscillations, and quantitative assessment of the impact of parvalbumin interneurons and gamma oscillations on cortical circuits, have been lacking despite potentially enormous significance (for example, abnormalities in parvalbumin interneurons may underlie altered gamma-frequency synchronization and cognition in schizophrenia and autism). Here we use a panel of optogenetic technologies in mice to selectively modulate multiple distinct circuit elements in neocortex, alone or in combination. We find that inhibiting parvalbumin interneurons suppresses gamma oscillations in vivo, whereas driving these interneurons (even by means of non-rhythmic principal cell activity) is sufficient to generate emergent gamma-frequency rhythmicity. Moreover, gamma-frequency modulation of excitatory input in turn was found to enhance signal transmission in neocortex by reducing circuit noise and amplifying circuit signals, including inputs to parvalbumin interneurons. As demonstrated here, optogenetics opens the door to a new kind of informational analysis of brain function, permitting quantitative delineation of the functional significance of individual elements in the emergent operation and function of intact neural circuitry."
https://openalex.org/W2152483372,"Groundbreaking work demonstrated that ectopic expression of four transcription factors, Oct4, Klf4, Sox2, and c-Myc, could reprogram murine somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17012) Google Scholar), and human iPSCs were subsequently generated using similar genetic manipulation (Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K.

To address the safety issues arose from harboring integrated exogenous sequences in the target cell genome, a number of modified genetic methods have been developed and produced iPSCs with potentially reduced risks (for discussion, see Yamanaka, 2009Yamanaka S. Cell. 2009; 137: 13-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, and references therein). However, all of the methods developed to date still involve the use of genetic materials and thus the potential for unexpected genetic modifications by the exogenous sequences in the target cells. Here we report generation of protein-induced pluripotent stem cells (piPSCs) from murine embryonic fibroblasts using recombinant cell-penetrating reprogramming proteins. We demonstrated that such piPSCs can long-term self-renew and are pluripotent in vitro and in vivo. One possible way to avoid introducing exogenous genetic modifications to target cells would be to deliver the reprogramming proteins directly into cells, rather than relying on the transcription from delivered genes. Previous studies have demonstrated that various proteins can be delivered into cells in vitro and in vivo by conjugating them with a short peptide that mediates protein transduction, such as HIV tat and poly-arginine (Inoue et al., 2006Inoue M.

Biotechnol. 2002; 13: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). In addition, various solubilization and refolding techniques for processing inclusion body proteins expressed in E. coli to bioactive proteins have been developed to allow facile and large-scale production of therapeutic proteins (Lafevre-Bernt et al., 2008Lafevre-Bernt M. Wu S. Lin X. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2008; 7: 1420-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To generate recombinant proteins that can penetrate across the plasma membrane of somatic cells, we designed and fused a poly-arginine (i.e., 11R) protein transduction domain to the C terminus of four reprogramming factors: Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (see Figure S1A online). These proteins were expressed in E. coli in inclusion bodies, which were then solubilized, refolded, and further purified (Figure S1B). The protein identities were confirmed by mass spectrometry and western blot analysis (Figure S1C). To test the cell permeability and stability of the proteins, we treated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells with the recombinant proteins at various concentrations by adding them to the cell culture media for 6–72 hr and examining cell morphology and protein presence by immunocytochemistry. We found that the purified 11R-tagged recombinant transcription factors readily entered cells at concentrations of 0.5–8 μg/ml within 6 hr and could translocate into nucleus (Figure S1D). In addition, we found that the transduced proteins appeared to be stable inside cells for up to 48 hr (Figure S1D). We then employed this simple protein transduction protocol to reprogram OG2/Oct4-GFP reporter MEF cells. Because reprogramming through the iPSC mechanism/process typically requires sustained activity of reprogramming proteins for 7–10 days, we devised a strategy that involved treating the cells in four cycles. In each cycle the fibroblasts (initially seeded at the density of 5 × 104 cells/well in a six-well plate) were first treated overnight with the recombinant reprogramming proteins (i.e., Oct4-11R, Sox2-11R, Klf4-11R, and c-Myc-11R) at 8 μg/ml in the mESC growth media supplemented with or without 1 mM valproic acid (VPA), a HDAC inhibitor that can significantly improve reprogramming efficiency (Huangfu et al., 2008bHuangfu D. Osafune K. Maehr R. Guo W. Eijkelenboom A. Chen S. Muhlestein W. Melton D.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 1269-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar), followed by changing to the same media without the recombinant reprogramming proteins and VPA, and culturing for additional 36 hr before the next cycle of the treatment. After completing four repeated protein transductions of reprogramming proteins, the treated cells were transferred onto irradiated MEF feeder cells and simply kept in mESC growth media until colonies emerged around day 30–35 (Figure 1A). We obtained three GFP+ colonies per 5 × 104 cells when they were transduced with four proteins and treated with VPA, and one GFP+ colony per 5 × 104 cells when they were transduced with only three proteins (i.e., Oct4-11R, Sox2-11R, and Klf4-11R) and treated with VPA. However, we did not obtain stable GFP+ piPSC colonies by transducing the three or four reprogramming proteins only for the same period of time, although GFP-negative cell colonies were observed. Those GFP-negative cell colonies stained positive with ALP, an early pluripotency marker, suggesting they might be partially reprogrammed cells. The initial GFP+ colonies were subsequently passaged under conventional mESC growth conditions to yield piPSCs and were characterized further. The generated murine piPSCs have been stably and homogenously expanded for over 30 passages and are morphologically indistinguishable from classic mESCs, forming compact domed small colonies (Figure 1C). They express typical pluripotency markers by immunocytochemistry and staining, including ALP (Figure 1D), Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, and SSEA1 (Figure 1E). RT-PCR analysis confirmed endogenous gene expression of these and additional pluripotency genes (Figure 1F). A single cell survival assay also demonstrated that piPSCs clonally expand efficiently as Oct4-positive colonies in feeder-free and N2/B27-chemically defined conditions (Figure S2A). Bisulfite genomic sequencing analyses of the Oct4 and Nanog promoters revealed that both were demethylated in piPSCs as in mESCs, while in MEFs they were hypermethylated (Figure 1G). This result provides further evidence for reactivation of the pluripotency transcription program in the piPSCs. Global gene expression analysis of piPSCs, OG2-MEFs, and mESCs showed that piPSCs are distinct from OG2-MEFs (Pearson correlation value: 0.895) and most similar to mESCs (Pearson correlation value: 0.969) (Figure 1H), consistent with previous reports. To examine the developmental potential of piPSCs, standard in vitro differentiation using embryoid bodies (EBs) or monolayer chemically defined stepwise differentiation, and in vivo chimerism assays were performed. piPSCs could efficiently form EBs in suspension and differentiate into cells in the three primary germ layers, including endoderm derivatives (cells expressing AFP, Sox17, GATA4, or FoxA2; pancreatic cells [Pdx1]; and hepatic cells [Albumin]), mesoderm derivatives (cells expressing Brachyury and mature beating cardiomyocytes [CT3 and MHC; Movie S1]), and ectoderm derivatives (neural [Sox1, Pax6] and characteristic mature neuronal [βIII-tubulin, MAP2ab] cells) (Figures 2A, 2B, and S2B). Most importantly, such piPSCs could efficiently incorporate into the inner cell mass of a blastocyst following aggregation with an eight-cell embryo and led to high-level chimerism with apparent germline contribution in vivo after the aggregated embryos were transplanted into mice, as confirmed by GFP genotyping in multiple three germ layer tissues of E13.5 fetuses (Figures 2D and S2C) and observation of Oct4-GFP+ cells in the gonad tissue in 3 out of 17 fetuses (Figure 2C). These in vitro and in vivo characterizations collectively confirm that the purified cell-penetrating recombinant reprogramming proteins are sufficient to reprogram MEFs to become piPSCs, which are molecularly, morphologically, and functionally similar to conventional mESCs. iPSCs (and especially patient-specific ones), which are similar to ESCs but are much easier to create and, in the case of human cells, less controversial, present unprecedented opportunities for biomedical research and clinical applications. Realization of the promise of iPSCs will require improved methods of directed differentiation for generating homogenous populations of lineage-specific cell types as well as elimination of the risks and drawbacks associated with the current iPSC protocol, including genetic manipulation, and the low-efficiency/slow kinetics of induction. Recent advances in using various genetic approaches have addressed some of those iPSC challenges, including using nonintegrating adenoviruses to deliver reprogramming genes (Stadtfeld et al., 2008Stadtfeld M.

In addition, strategies of exploiting endogenous gene expression in certain cell types also allowed easier reprogramming and/or fewer required exogenous genes (Shi et al., 2008bShi Y. Do J.T.

Our present study is the first to demonstrate that somatic cells (i.e., murine fibroblasts) can be fully reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells by direct delivery of recombinant reprogramming proteins. This protein transduction method represents a significant advance in generating iPSCs and has several major advantages over previous iPSC methods. First, it effectively eliminates any risk of modifying the target cell genome by exogenous genetic sequences, which are associated with all previous iPSC methods, and consequently offers a method for generating safer iPSCs. Second, the protein transduction method provides a substantially simpler and faster approach than the currently most advanced genetic method, which requires time-consuming sequential selection of potentially integration-free iPSCs. And finally, given the robustness and wide availability of large-scale recombinant protein production, our demonstrated completely chemically defined reprogramming regimen could potentially enable broader and more economical application of reprogramming methodology.

https://openalex.org/W2133381977,"Chromosome instability is a hallmark of tumorigenesis. This study establishes that chromosome instability is also common during early human embryogenesis. A new array-based method allowed screening of genome-wide copy number and loss of heterozygosity in single cells. This revealed not only mosaicism for whole-chromosome aneuploidies and uniparental disomies in most cleavage-stage embryos but also frequent segmental deletions, duplications and amplifications that were reciprocal in sister blastomeres, implying the occurrence of breakage-fusion-bridge cycles. This explains the low human fecundity and identifies post-zygotic chromosome instability as a leading cause of constitutional chromosomal disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2087207490,"Pier Paolo Pandolfi and colleagues report that prostate-specific overexpression of ERG in transgenic mice results in no overt phenotype on its own but promotes progression of intraepithelial neoplasia to adenocarcinoma in a PTEN heterozygous background. They also find that human TMPRSS2-ERG–positive tumors are enriched for PTEN loss, suggesting that these two events cooperate in human prostate tumorigenesis. Chromosomal translocations involving the ERG locus are frequent events in human prostate cancer pathogenesis; however, the biological role of aberrant ERG expression is controversial1. Here we show that aberrant expression of ERG is a progression event in prostate tumorigenesis. We find that prostate cancer specimens containing the TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement are significantly enriched for loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN. In concordance with these findings, transgenic overexpression of ERG in mouse prostate tissue promotes marked acceleration and progression of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) to prostatic adenocarcinoma in a Pten heterozygous background. In vitro overexpression of ERG promotes cell migration, a property necessary for tumorigenesis, without affecting proliferation. ADAMTS1 and CXCR4, two candidate genes strongly associated with cell migration, were upregulated in the presence of ERG overexpression. Thus, ERG has a distinct role in prostate cancer progression and cooperates with PTEN haploinsufficiency to promote progression of HGPIN to invasive adenocarcinoma."

https://openalex.org/W2138248682,"The heart has little regenerative capacity after damage, so understanding the factors required to produce new cardiac myocytes is of great interest. Jun Takeuchi and Benoit Bruneau have investigated the minimal requirements for transdifferentiation of mouse mesoderm to cardiac myocytes, and find that two cardiac transcription factors and a cardiac-specific subunit of BAF chromatin-remodelling complexes are sufficient to direct differentiation of mouse mesoderm into beating cardiomyocytes. Addition of a further transcription factor promotes differentiation into contracting cardiomyocytes, and repression of noncardiac mesodermal genes. Defining the requirements for cardiac cellular differentiation may help in the long-term goal of regenerating cardiomyocytes for therapies. The heart has little regenerative capacity after damage, so understanding the factors required to produce new cardiac myocytes is of great interest. The minimal requirements for transdifferentiation of mouse mesoderm to cardiac myocytes are now defined, with implications for the reprogramming of cardiomyocytes for regenerative purposes in the future. Heart disease is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the western world. The heart has little regenerative capacity after damage, leading to much interest in understanding the factors required to produce new cardiac myocytes. Despite a robust understanding of the molecular networks regulating cardiac differentiation1,2, no single transcription factor or combination of factors has been shown to activate the cardiac gene program de novo in mammalian cells or tissues. Here we define the minimal requirements for transdifferentiation of mouse mesoderm to cardiac myocytes. We show that two cardiac transcription factors, Gata4 and Tbx5, and a cardiac-specific subunit of BAF chromatin-remodelling complexes, Baf60c (also called Smarcd3), can direct ectopic differentiation of mouse mesoderm into beating cardiomyocytes, including the normally non-cardiogenic posterior mesoderm and the extraembryonic mesoderm of the amnion. Gata4 with Baf60c initiated ectopic cardiac gene expression. Addition of Tbx5 allowed differentiation into contracting cardiomyocytes and repression of non-cardiac mesodermal genes. Baf60c was essential for the ectopic cardiogenic activity of Gata4 and Tbx5, partly by permitting binding of Gata4 to cardiac genes, indicating a novel instructive role for BAF complexes in tissue-specific regulation. The combined function of these factors establishes a robust mechanism for controlling cellular differentiation, and may allow reprogramming of new cardiomyocytes for regenerative purposes."

https://openalex.org/W2127864764,"Dengue fever is endemic in many countries in South and Southeast Asia, Africa and South America, and elsewhere it is an emerging threat. It is caused by one of four dengue viruses — DENV-1, 2, 3 and 4 — transmitted by Aedes sp. mosquitoes; there is no approved vaccine and no effective specific therapy. The dengue viruses are compact flaviviruses likely to require a large number of host factors, and knowledge of those factors could lead to the discovery of potential targets for drugs and new vector control strategies. Now by using a high-throughput RNAi screening approach in DENV-2-infected Drosophila cells — Drosophila is related to the vector species and more amenable to the tools of genomics — more than a hundred candidate dengue virus host factors have been identified, many of them also acting as host factors in human cells. This report identifies host factors required for Dengue virus propagation by using a high throughput genome-wide RNA interference screening approach in Drosophila cells. Dengue fever is the most frequent arthropod-borne viral disease of humans, with almost half of the world’s population at risk of infection1. The high prevalence, lack of an effective vaccine, and absence of specific treatment conspire to make dengue fever a global public health threat1,2. Given their compact genomes, dengue viruses (DENV-1–4) and other flaviviruses probably require an extensive number of host factors; however, only a limited number of human, and an even smaller number of insect host factors, have been identified3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. Here we identify insect host factors required for DENV-2 propagation, by carrying out a genome-wide RNA interference screen in Drosophila melanogaster cells using a well-established 22,632 double-stranded RNA library. This screen identified 116 candidate dengue virus host factors (DVHFs). Although some were previously associated with flaviviruses (for example, V-ATPases and α-glucosidases)3,4,5,7,9,10, most of the DVHFs were newly implicated in dengue virus propagation. The dipteran DVHFs had 82 readily recognizable human homologues and, using a targeted short-interfering-RNA screen, we showed that 42 of these are human DVHFs. This indicates notable conservation of required factors between dipteran and human hosts. This work suggests new approaches to control infection in the insect vector and the mammalian host."
https://openalex.org/W2056419186,"Fruitflies show robust attraction to food odours, which usually excite several glomeruli. To understand how the representation of such odours leads to behaviour, we used genetic tools to dissect the contribution of each activated glomerulus. Apple cider vinegar triggers robust innate attraction at a relatively low concentration, which activates six glomeruli. By silencing individual glomeruli, here we show that the absence of activity in two glomeruli, DM1 and VA2, markedly reduces attraction. Conversely, when each of these two glomeruli was selectively activated, flies showed as robust an attraction to vinegar as wild-type flies. Notably, a higher concentration of vinegar excites an additional glomerulus and is less attractive to flies. We show that activation of the extra glomerulus is necessary and sufficient to mediate the behavioural switch. Together, these results indicate that individual glomeruli, rather than the entire pattern of active glomeruli, mediate innate behavioural output."
https://openalex.org/W2093984973,"To maintain genome stability, cells respond to DNA damage by activating signalling pathways that govern cell-cycle checkpoints and initiate DNA repair. Cell-cycle checkpoint controls should connect with DNA repair processes, however, exactly how such coordination occurs in vivo is largely unknown. Here we describe a new role for the E3 ligase RAD18 as the integral component in translating the damage response signal to orchestrate homologous recombination repair (HRR). We show that RAD18 promotes homologous recombination in a manner strictly dependent on its ability to be recruited to sites of DNA breaks and that this recruitment relies on a well-defined DNA damage signalling pathway mediated by another E3 ligase, RNF8. We further demonstrate that RAD18 functions as an adaptor to facilitate homologous recombination through direct interaction with the recombinase RAD51C. Together, our data uncovers RAD18 as a key factor that orchestrates HRR through surveillance of the DNA damage signal."
https://openalex.org/W2066986818,"Any polarizable body placed in an inhomogeneous electric field experiences a dielectric force. This phenomenon is well known from the macroscopic world: a water jet is deflected when approached by a charged object. This fundamental mechanism is exploited in a variety of contexts-for example, trapping microscopic particles in an optical tweezer, where the trapping force is controlled via the intensity of a laser beam, or dielectrophoresis, where electric fields are used to manipulate particles in liquids. Here we extend the underlying concept to the rapidly evolving field of nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS). A broad range of possible applications are anticipated for these systems, but drive and detection schemes for nanomechanical motion still need to be optimized. Our approach is based on the application of dielectric gradient forces for the controlled and local transduction of NEMS. Using a set of on-chip electrodes to create an electric field gradient, we polarize a dielectric resonator and subject it to an attractive force that can be modulated at high frequencies. This universal actuation scheme is efficient, broadband and scalable. It also separates the driving scheme from the driven mechanical element, allowing for arbitrary polarizable materials and thus potentially ultralow dissipation NEMS. In addition, it enables simple voltage tuning of the mechanical resonance over a wide frequency range, because the dielectric force depends strongly on the resonator-electrode separation. We use the modulation of the resonance frequency to demonstrate parametric actuation. Moreover, we reverse the actuation principle to realize dielectric detection, thus allowing universal transduction of NEMS. We expect this combination to be useful both in the study of fundamental principles and in applications such as signal processing and sensing."
https://openalex.org/W2095346103,"Mitotic exit occurs when Cdc2 kinase activity drops and its substrates are dephosphorylated. Protein phosphatase-1 is responsible for this dephosphorylation and its activity is restrained during mitosis by Cdc2 phosphorylation and binding of Inhibitor-1, while auto-dephoshorylation at the Cdc2 site ensures its timely activation. Loss of cell division cycle 2 (Cdc2, also known as Cdk1) activity after cyclin B degradation is necessary, but not sufficient, for mitotic exit. Proteins phosphorylated by Cdc2 and downstream mitotic kinases must be dephosphorylated. We report here that protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) is the main catalyst of mitotic phosphoprotein dephosphorylation. Suppression of PP1 during early mitosis is maintained through dual inhibition by Cdc2 phosphorylation and the binding of inhibitor-1. Protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates inhibitor-1, mediating binding to PP1. As Cdc2 levels drop after cyclin B degradation, auto-dephosphorylation of PP1 at its Cdc2 phosphorylation site (Thr 320) allows partial PP1 activation. This promotes PP1-regulated dephosphorylation at the activating site of inhibitor-1 (Thr 35) followed by dissociation of the inhibitor-1–PP1 complex and then full PP1 activation to promote mitotic exit. Thus, Cdc2 both phosphorylates multiple mitotic substrates and inhibits their PP1-mediated dephosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W2081156233,"A novel approach for boosting antimicrobial peptides through end tagging with hydrophobic oligopeptide stretches is demonstrated. Focusing on two peptides derived from kininogen, GKHKNKGKKNGKHNGWK (GKH17) and HKHGHGHGKHKNKGKKN (HKH17), tagging resulted in enhanced killing of Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-negative Escherichia coli, and fungal Candida albicans. Microbicidal potency increased with tag length, also in plasma, and was larger for Trp and Phe stretches than for aliphatic ones. The enhanced microbicidal effects correlated to a higher degree of bacterial wall rupture. Analogously, tagging promoted peptide binding to model phospholipid membranes and liposome rupture, particularly for anionic and cholesterol-void membranes. Tagged peptides displayed low toxicity, particularly in the presence of serum, and resisted degradation by human leukocyte elastase and by staphylococcal aureolysin and V8 proteinase. The biological relevance of these findings was demonstrated ex vivo and in vivo in porcine S. aureus skin infection models. The generality of end tagging for facile boosting of antimicrobial peptides without the need for post-synthesis modification was also demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W2089637251,"It is well established that the left inferior frontal gyrus plays a key role in the cerebral cortical network that supports reading and visual word recognition. Less clear is when in time this contribution begins. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG), which has both good spatial and excellent temporal resolution, to address this question.MEG data were recorded during a passive viewing paradigm, chosen to emphasize the stimulus-driven component of the cortical response, in which right-handed participants were presented words, consonant strings, and unfamiliar faces to central vision. Time-frequency analyses showed a left-lateralized inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis) response to words between 100-250 ms in the beta frequency band that was significantly stronger than the response to consonant strings or faces. The left inferior frontal gyrus response to words peaked at approximately 130 ms. This response was significantly later in time than the left middle occipital gyrus, which peaked at approximately 115 ms, but not significantly different from the peak response in the left mid fusiform gyrus, which peaked at approximately 140 ms, at a location coincident with the fMRI-defined visual word form area (VWFA). Significant responses were also detected to words in other parts of the reading network, including the anterior middle temporal gyrus, the left posterior middle temporal gyrus, the angular and supramarginal gyri, and the left superior temporal gyrus.These findings suggest very early interactions between the vision and language domains during visual word recognition, with speech motor areas being activated at the same time as the orthographic word-form is being resolved within the fusiform gyrus. This challenges the conventional view of a temporally serial processing sequence for visual word recognition in which letter forms are initially decoded, interact with their phonological and semantic representations, and only then gain access to a speech code."

https://openalex.org/W2016611373,"Ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) abrogate the stimulation of collagen gene transcription induced by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). Here, we delineate the mechanisms underlying this important novel physiological function for PPAR-gamma in connective tissue homeostasis. First, we demonstrated that antagonistic regulation of TGF-beta activity by PPAR-gamma ligands involves cellular PPAR-gamma, since 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J(2) (15d-PGJ(2)) failed to block TGF-beta-induced responses in either primary cultures of PPAR-gamma-null murine embryonic fibroblasts, or in normal human skin fibroblasts with RNAi-mediated knockdown of PPAR-gamma. Next, we examined the molecular basis underlying the abrogation of TGF-beta signaling by PPAR-gamma in normal human fibroblasts in culture. The results demonstrated that Smad-dependent transcriptional responses were blocked by PPAR-gamma without preventing Smad2/3 activation. In contrast, the interaction between activated Smad2/3 and the transcriptional coactivator and histone acetyltransferase p300 induced by TGF-beta, and the accumulation of p300 on consensus Smad-binding DNA sequences and histone H4 hyperacetylation at the COL1A2 locus, were all prevented by PPAR-gamma. Wild-type p300, but not a mutant form of p300 lacking functional histone acetyltransferase, was able to restore TGF-beta-induced stimulation of COL1A2 in the presence of PPAR-gamma ligands. Collectively, these results indicate that PPAR-gamma blocked Smad-mediated transcriptional responses by preventing p300 recruitment and histone H4 hyperacetylation, resulting in the inhibition of TGF-beta-induced collagen gene expression. Pharmacological activation of PPAR-gamma thus may represent a novel therapeutic approach to target p300-dependent TGF-beta profibrotic responses such as stimulation of collagen gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2020725709,"The linking together of molecular fragments that bind to adjacent sites on an enzyme can lead to high-affinity inhibitors. Ideally, this strategy would use linkers that do not perturb the optimal binding geometries of the fragments and do not have excessive conformational flexibility that would increase the entropic penalty of binding. In reality, these aims are seldom realized owing to limitations in linker chemistry. Here we systematically explore the energetic and structural effects of rigid and flexible linkers on the binding of a fragment-based inhibitor of human uracil DNA glycosylase. Analysis of the free energies of binding in combination with cocrystal structures shows that the flexibility and strain of a given linker can have a substantial impact on binding affinity even when the binding fragments are optimally positioned. Such effects are not apparent from inspection of structures and underscore the importance of linker optimization in fragment-based drug discovery efforts."

https://openalex.org/W2098582198,"Background Experimental studies show that a reduction in dietary energy density (ED) is associated with reduced energy intake and body weight. However, few observational studies have investigated the role of ED on long-term weight and waist circumference change. Methods and Principal Findings This population-based prospective cohort study included 89,432 participants from five European countries with mean age 53 years (range: 20–78 years) at baseline and were followed for an average of 6.5 years (range: 1.9–12.5 years). Participants were free of cancer, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes at baseline. ED was calculated as the energy intake (kcal) from foods divided by the weight (g) of foods. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to investigate the associations of ED with annual weight and waist circumference change. Mean ED was 1.7 kcal/g and differed across study centers. After adjusting for baseline anthropometrics, demographic and lifestyle factors, follow-up duration and energy from beverages, ED was not associated with weight change, but significantly associated with waist circumference change overall. For 1 kcal/g ED, the annual weight change was −42 g/year [95% confidence interval (CI): −112, 28] and annual waist circumference change was 0.09 cm/year [95% CI: 0.01, 0.18]. In participants with baseline BMI<25 kg/m2, 1 kcal/g ED was associated with a waist circumference change of 0.17 cm/year [95% CI: 0.09, 0.25]. Conclusion Our results suggest that lower ED diets do not prevent weight gain but have a weak yet potentially beneficial effect on the prevention of abdominal obesity as measured by waist circumference."
https://openalex.org/W1995878243,"Although there are numerous reports of carbohydrates enriched in cancer cells, very few studies have addressed the functions of carbohydrates present in normal cells that decrease in cancer cells. It has been reported that core3 O-glycans are synthesized in normal gastrointestinal cells but are down-regulated in cancer cells. To determine the roles of core3 O-glycans, we transfected PC3 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells with beta3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-6 (core3 synthase) required to synthesize core3 O-glycans. Both engineered cell lines exhibited reduced migration and invasion through extracellular matrix components compared with mock-transfected cells. Moreover we found that alpha2beta1 integrin acquired core3 O-glycans in cells expressing core3 synthase with decreased maturation of beta1 integrin, leading to decreased levels of the alpha2beta1 integrin complex, decreased activation of focal adhesion kinase, and reduced lamellipodia formation. Upon inoculation into the prostate of nude mice, PC3 cells expressing core3 O-glycans produced much smaller tumors without metastasis to the surrounding lymph nodes in contrast to robust tumor formation and metastasis seen in mock-transfected PC3 cells. Similarly LNCaP cells expressing core3 O-glycans barely produced subcutaneous tumors in contrast to robust tumor formation by mock-transfected LNCaP cells. These findings indicate that addition of core3 O-glycans to beta1 and alpha2 integrin subunits in prostate cancer cells suppresses tumor formation and tumor metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2012243786,"The responses of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) to an optimally oriented grating are suppressed when a non-optimal grating is superimposed. Although cross-orientation suppression is thought to reflect mechanisms that maintain a distributed code for orientation, the effect of superimposed gratings on V1 population responses is unknown. Using intrinsic signal optical imaging, we found that patterns of tree shrew V1 activity evoked by superimposed equal-contrast gratings were predicted by the averages of patterns evoked by individual component gratings. This prediction held across contrasts, for summed sinusoidal gratings or nonsumming square-wave gratings, and was evident in single-unit extracellular recordings. Intracellular recordings revealed consistent levels of suppression throughout the time course of subthreshold responses. These results indicate that divisive suppression powerfully governs population responses to multiple orientations. Moreover, the specific form of suppression that we observed appears to support independent population codes for stimulus orientation and strength and calls for a reassessment of mechanisms that underlie cross-orientation suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2010069222,"Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in microRNA target sites can disrupt the effects of the microRNA. Kim and Bartel use sequencing to investigate this phenomenon on a large scale and find that such polymorphisms generate gene-regulatory diversity in mice. Genetic changes that help explain the differences between two individuals might create or disrupt sites complementary to microRNAs (miRNAs)1,2, but the extent to which such polymorphic sites influence miRNA-mediated repression is unknown. Here, we describe a method to measure mRNA allelic imbalances associated with a regulatory site found in mRNA transcribed from one allele but not found in that transcribed from the other. Applying this method, called allelic imbalance sequencing, to sites for three miRNAs (miR-1, miR-133 and miR-122) provided quantitative measurements of repression in vivo without altering either the miRNAs or their targets. A substantial fraction of polymorphic sites mediated repression in tissues that expressed the cognate miRNA, and downregulation was correlated with site type and site context. Extrapolating these results to the other broadly conserved miRNAs suggests that when comparing two mouse strains (or two human individuals), polymorphic miRNA sites cause expression of many genes (often hundreds) to differ."

SEPS1 participates in the processing and removal of misfolded proteins from the ER to the cytosol, where they are polyubiquitinated and degraded through the proteasome (1Ye Y. Shibata Y. Yun C.

The endoplasmic reticulum is one of the largest cell organelles. It serves many essential functions, including production of all components of cellular membranes, proteins, lipids, and sterols (4Ron D. Walter P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4929) Google Scholar). Only correctly folded proteins are transported out of the ER, whereas incompletely folded proteins are retained in the organelle to complete the folding process or be targeted for destruction. ER stress is defined as an imbalance between the cellular demand for ER function and capacity of the organelle. It is characterized by a number of intracellular responses. These responses include the ER overload response (EOR), the unfolded protein response (UPR), and apoptosis. α1-Antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is a disease characterized by early onset emphysema and liver disease (5Greene C.M. Miller S.D. Carroll T. McLean C. O'Mahony M. Lawless M.W. O'Neill S.J. Taggart C.C. McElvaney N.G. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2008; 31: 21-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The mutant Z form of this autosomal co-dominant disease occurs in >95% of all individuals with AAT deficiency (6Brantly M. Nukiwa T. Crystal R.G. Am. J. Med. 1988; 84: 13-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Liver disease occurs in ∼10% of all homozygous neonates who develop hepatitis and cholestasis. A proportion of these children progress to liver failure, requiring liver transplantation (7Sveger T. N. Engl. J. Med. 1976; 294: 1316-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 8Sveger T. Acta Paediatr. Scand. 1988; 77: 847-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Cirrhosis can also occur in adults without a preceding history of childhood liver disease. The mutant Z AAT polymerizes and accumulates in the ER, leaving only 15% of ZAAT secreted (9Le A. Ferrell G.A. Dishon D.S. Le Q.Q. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1072-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Le A. Graham K.S. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14001-14007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This accumulation of abnormal protein in the ER gives rise to ER stress, which is believed to contribute to the liver disease that results from AAT deficiency. The cells respond to this perturbation by inducing the expression of novel genes whose products aim to restore normal ER function (11Welihinda A.A. Tirasophon W. Kaufman R.J. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 293-300PubMed Google Scholar). SEPS1 is an example of a molecular chaperone that serves to augment the capacity of the ER for protein folding and degradation. In this paper, we investigate the role of SEPS1 in regulating the cellular response to ER stress in HepG2 cells transfected with the ZAAT transgene. We investigate the effect of SEPS1 on the UPR component of this response by measuring grp78 promoter activity, a UPR-up-regulated gene that functions as a molecular chaperone, and by detecting activated ATF6, which occurs downstream to the activation of grp78. The EOR component of ER stress is investigated by measuring NFκB activation. We study the effect of selenium supplementation on the action of SEPS1 to see if the function of this selenoprotein can be enhanced and, if so, through which pathways, looking specifically at grp78 promoter activity, ATF6 activation, and NFκB activation and also at glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity and at the anti-inflammatory 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) pathway. GPx is a selenoprotein whose activity can be readily assayed. This was used as a measure of selenoprotein activity. The role of SEPS1 in conformational diseases has not been evaluated. These diseases are caused by inherited or acquired modifications in protein structure, where specific proteins undergo a conformational rearrangement, causing deposition within cellular compartments, such as the ER. This can lead to devastating results. AAT deficiency is one such disease, but the group includes Alzheimer, Parkinson, and Huntington diseases and cystic fibrosis. HepG2 cells (3 × 105 cells/well) were grown in 24-well plates overnight in serum-free Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with l-glutamine (Glutamax) and 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids in preparation for transfection (Transfast; Promega). Cells were co-transfected with pCMV (empty vector), pSEPS1 (Origene), pZAAT, or pSEPS + pZAAT and an inducible grp78 promoter-linked (firefly) luciferase reporter plasmid or an inducible (NFκB)5 promoter (firefly) luciferase reporter plasmid and pRLSV40, a constitutive luciferase reporter plasmid for 24 h. Cells were treated with vehicle, tunicamycin (10 μg/ml) or IL-1β (10 ng/ml) for a further 24 h, as indicated. Supernatants or lysates were prepared for further analyses. Cells (1 × 106) were grown in the absence or presence of selenium (as indicated) or in 6-well plates overnight in serum-free medium in preparation for transfection. Cells were transfected with appropriate plasmids and treated as indicated. Whole cell lysates were prepared. Immunoreactive proteins were detected using specific antibodies (SEPS1, ATF6; Abcam); signals were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technologies) and chemiluminescent substrate solution (Pierce). Equal protein loading was confirmed by Ponceau S staining. Detection of the Z form of AAT was carried out using the Wieslab AAT deficiency test according to the manufacturer's instructions. Duplicate samples of supernatants and lysates from pZAAT-transfected cells were used. Absorbance values were measured at 405 nm, and these were corrected for transfection efficiency. pRLSV40 luciferase activity was quantified, using coelenterazine as the luminescent enzyme substrate and using a Wallac Victor2 1420 multilabel counter. For (NFκB)5 and grp78 promoter luciferase assays, the Promega luciferase assay system was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Values are expressed as (NFκB)5 or grp78 promoter activity per transfected cell. Total RNA was isolated using TRI Reagent (Sigma). RNA (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed, and cDNAs were amplified using standard PCR conditions and primers for SEPS1 (sense, 5′-GAAACGGAAATCGGACAGAA-3′; antisense, 5′-GGCAATTGAATCGAGGGTTA-3′) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (sense, 5′-ACAGTCAGCCGCATCTTCTT-3′; antisense, 5′-GACAAGCTTCCCGTTCTCAG-3′). Amplifications were carried out for 35 cycles at 94 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 7 s using a Roche Applied Science LightCycler (LC480). The expression of SEPS1 relative to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was determined using the 2−ΔΔCT method. Following informed consent under a protocol approved by the Beaumont Hospital Ethics Committee, serum samples were taken from 24 patients who had been screened for AAT deficiency and phenotyped. Twelve ZZ and 12 MM patients who were age- and sex-matched were compared. Serum selenium levels were measured in μg/liter by Trace Laboratories. Cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 40 nm or 150 μm seleno-dl-methionine (Sigma)-supplemented medium (12Venkateswaran V. Klotz L.H. Fleshner N.E. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2540-2545PubMed Google Scholar). GPx activity was quantified using the Sigma glutathione peroxidase cellular activity assay kit. This kit measures total GPx activity and does not differentiate different isoforms. HepG2 cells (9 × 105) transfected or treated appropriately were grown in 6-well plates in 3 ml of complete medium or selenium-supplemented medium (150 μm seleno-dl-methionine) for 48 h. 15-Deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 levels were quantified using an enzyme immunoassay kit (Correlate-EIA; Assay Designs). Data were analyzed with the GraphPad Prism 4 software package (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Results are compared by t test or analysis of variance, as appropriate. Differences were considered significant at p values of less than 0.05. Fig. 1 shows that HepG2 cells transfected with pSEPS1 express higher SEPS1 protein (Fig. 1A) and mRNA (Fig. 1B) compared with empty vector-transfected cells. Cells transfected with pZAAT but not an empty vector produce ZAAT (Fig. 1C). The unfolded protein response was examined by measuring grp78 promoter activity in HepG2 cells transfected with an empty vector (CMV) or with the ZAAT transgene (ZAAT in Fig. 2A). Cells transfected with an empty vector and treated with tunicamycin, a known ER stress agonist, had double the grp78 promoter activity of cells transfected with the empty vector alone. Overexpression of SEPS1 in these cells decreased grp78 promoter activity to the level of the empty vector alone. Transfection with pZAAT caused an increase in grp78 promoter activity to the level seen in the positive control with tunicamycin. When the cells were co-transfected with pSEPS1, grp78 promoter activity was abrogated (p < 0.0001). The unfolded protein response was examined by Western immunoblotting for ATF6 (Fig. 2B). The active form of ATF6, occurring in ER stress, has a molecular mass of 50 kDa and is termed ATF6p50. There was no detectable ATF6p50 in empty vector-transfected cells (lane 1). Tunicamycin treatment and ZAAT overexpression lead to cleavage and activation of ATF6 (lanes 2 and 3, respectively). Co-transfection with SEPS1 inhibited generation of ATF6p50 (lanes 4 and 5). NFκB is a key transcription factor activated in ER stress. We examined the effect of SEPS1 expression on NFκB activation in HepG2 cells in response to ZAAT or another NFκB activator, IL-1β. HepG2 cells were co-transfected with an empty vector, CMV, or a plasmid carrying the ZAAT transgene and an (NFκB)5-luciferase reporter construct (Fig. 3). Overexpression of SEPS1 significantly reduced NFκB activation induced by ZAAT (Fig. 3A) or IL-1β (Fig. 3B). Patients were genotyped for the AAT gene. Serum selenium levels were measured in 12 Z homozygous and 12 M homozygous age- and sex-matched individuals. The levels of selenium in the ZZ patients were all in the lower normal range (Fig. 4). Although no significant difference was evident between the ZZ and MM individuals, mean serum selenium levels were lower than the optimal range for serum glutathione peroxidase activity (70–90 μg/liter) in 75% of the ZZ patients. SEPS1 and GPx are selenoproteins. Selenocysteine is an essential component of selenoproteins and is often present in the active sites of these proteins. We investigated if supplementation with selenium would enhance the activity of SEPS1, using GPx activity as a surrogate marker of SEPS1 activity. HepG2 cells were grown in 150 μm seleno-dl-methionine-supplemented medium or routine serum-containing medium. Growth in selenium led to a decrease in overall cell number; however, once corrected for cell number, GPx activity in cell lysates was higher in cells grown in the presence of selenium (Fig. 5A). This showed an enhanced selenoprotein activity in these cells. We next assessed the status of SEPS1 mRNA and protein expression in selenium-deficient and a variety of selenium-sufficient conditions. Fig. 5B shows that compared with cells grown in the absence of selenium, incorporation of 40 nm or 150 μm selenium into the culture medium led to a small decrease in SEPS1 mRNA expression. Interestingly, SEPS1 protein expression was actually enhanced in cells grown in 40 nm or 150 μm selenium compared with selenium-starved cells (Fig. 5C). Selenium supplementation can have an anti-inflammatory effect through enhancing the activity of SEPS1 but also through its effect on 15d-PGJ2 formation, an endogenous inhibitor of IKKβ activity. HepG2 cells were grown in the presence or absence of 150 μm seleno-dl-methionine. Lysed cells were analyzed for 15d-PGJ2 concentration (Fig. 6). There was increased 15d-PGJ2 concentrations in the selenium-supplemented cells. The effect of supplementation with 150 μm seleno-dl-methionine on the UPR component of ER stress was examined by measuring grp78 promoter activity in HepG2 cells transfected with pCMV, pSEPS1, pZAAT, or pSEPS1 + pZAAT. Fig. 7A shows that selenium enhances the effect of both endogenous and overexpressed SEPS1 on grp78 promoter activity. The effect on the EOR response was assessed by measuring NFκB activity in the presence of selenium supplementation (Fig. 7B). Selenium was also shown to enhance the effect of the endogenous and overexpressed SEPS1 on the activity of NFκB. In this work, we have demonstrated a role for SEPS1 in modifying ER stress responses induced by ZAAT. ZAAT deficiency is a genetic disorder, the phenotype of which has varying degrees of severity and is likely to be affected by a number of modifying factors. Liver disease in this condition occurs in ∼10% of patients and results from the accumulation of polymers of the abnormal protein in the ER. This is exemplified by the fact that in the absence of the abnormal protein, as is the case in the null variant, liver disease does not occur (6Brantly M. Nukiwa T. Crystal R.G. Am. J. Med. 1988; 84: 13-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The in vitro model of the disease we have used is HepG2 cells transfected with a ZAAT transgene. HepG2 is a commonly used cell line in SEPS1 studies (2Gao Y. Feng H.C. Walder K. Bolton K. Sunderland T. Bishara N. Quick M. Kantham L. Collier G.R. FEBS Lett. 2004; 563: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 13Gao Y. Hannan N.R. Wanyonyi S. Konstantopolous N. Pagnon J. Feng H.C. Jowett J.B. Kim K.H. Walder K. Collier G.R. Cytokine. 2006; 33: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We validated our model prior to experiments by demonstrating the expression of SEPS1 and ZAAT in transfected cells. The ER has a key role in protein folding and handling of misfolded proteins. Specific signaling pathways (14Berridge M.J. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar) and effector mechanisms have evolved to deal with the temporal and developmental variation in the ER load. The upstream signal that activates these pathways is referred to as ER stress and is defined functionally as an imbalance between the load of proteins facing the ER and the organelle's ability to process that load. The cellular response to ER stress has four main functional components: EOR, UPR (15Lawless M.W. Greene C.M. Mulgrew A. Taggart C.C. O'Neill S.J. McElvaney N.G. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 5722-5726Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), a decrease in protein synthesis, and programmed cell death (16Ron D. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Here we investigated the effect of SEPS1 on different elements of the ER stress response. GRP78/BiP is a major UPR-up-regulated target protein. This immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein/glucose-regulated protein has a molecular mass of 78 kDa and is one of the most highly expressed ER-resident chaperones. GRP78 is involved in many cellular processes, including translocating newly synthesized proteins, maintaining them in a state competent for subsequent folding and oligomerization, and regulating calcium homeostasis (17Hendershot L.M. Mt. Sinai J. Med. 2004; 71: 289-297PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lee A.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 504-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). In addition to its chaperoning function, GRP78 is a key regulator of ER stress transducers. GRP78 binds and inhibits PERK, IRE1, and ATF6 activation in nonstressed cells (19Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Hendershot L.M. Harding H.P. Ron D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar). It senses the presence of misfolded proteins in the ER, dissociates from PERK, IRE1, and ATF6 and associates with the accumulating misfolded protein in the ER lumen. This titrating event leads to activation of UPR signaling. We demonstrate an increase in grp78 promoter activity in the setting of ER stress in the ZAAT-transfected cells. When SEPS1 is overexpressed, the effect of ZAAT is reduced, and the increase in grp78 promoter activity is decreased to a level seen in the control setting. SEPS1 is a selenoprotein. Selenoproteins are a group of proteins that contain the rare amino acid selenocysteine (Sec). Sec is coded for by the dual function stop codon UGA when it is accompanied by the evolutionarily conserved cis- and trans-acting elements and protein factors dedicated to decoding of UGA as Sec (20Chambers I. Frampton J. Goldfarb P. Affara N. McBain W. Harrison P.R. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1221-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). There are only 25 known selenoproteins in the human proteome (21Castellano S. Lobanov A.V. Chapple C. Novoselov S.V. Albrecht M. Hua D. Lescure A. Lengauer T. Krol A. Gladyshev V.N. Guigó R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16188-16193Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Selenium is an essential trace mineral of fundamental importance to human health and is known for its antioxidant activity and its chemopreventive, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral properties (22Papp L.V. Lu J. Holmgren A. Khanna K.K. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2007; 9: 775-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). Much of its beneficial influence on human health is attributed to its presence within the selenoproteins, but other pathways are also possible. SEPS1 was initially cloned from diabetic rats, since it was observed that its expression was decreased in fasting diabetic animals. The protein was characterized under the name Tanis; however, the penultimate Sec residue was misinterpreted as a stop codon (23Walder K. Kantham L. McMillan J.S. Trevaskis J. Kerr L. De Silva A. Sunderland T. Godde N. Gao Y. Bishara N. Windmill K. Tenne-Brown J. Augert G. Zimmet P.Z. Collier G.R. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1859-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The interaction of SEPS1 with serum amyloid (SAA), an acute phase protein, suggested a link between type 2 diabetes, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease. SEPS1 was later shown to be induced in response to ER stress (13Gao Y. Hannan N.R. Wanyonyi S. Konstantopolous N. Pagnon J. Feng H.C. Jowett J.B. Kim K.H. Walder K. Collier G.R. Cytokine. 2006; 33: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Of the 25 mammalian selenoproteins described, selenoproteins I, K, and S and the thioredoxin reductases 1, 2, and 3 share a penultimate rather then internal Sec residue (24Kryukov G.V. Castellano S. Novoselov S.V. Lobanov A.V. Zehtab O. Guigó R. Gladyshev V.N. Science. 2003; 300: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar). A hierarchy of selenium regulation exists whereby the position of Sec is thought to play a major role in susceptibility of selenoprotein mRNAs to nonsense-mediated decay. Although expression of GPx1 and thioredoxin reductases, for example, are known to be decreased by selenium deficiency, we and others found that SEPS1 displays only low susceptibility to regulation by selenium status (25Sunde R.A. Raines A.M. Barnes K.M. Evenson J.K. Biosci. Rep. 2008; (in press)Google Scholar). In contrast to the effect seen on SEPS1 mRNA, SEPS1 protein expression was enhanced by a growth in the presence of selenium. This is not surprising, given that Sec is cotranslationally incorporated into nascent polypeptides. Thus, in the presence of selenium, there are two levels of regulation: a small decrease in SEPS1 mRNA expression but a larger increase in Sec incorporation into SEPS1 protein. We show in this paper, by demonstrating the effect on ATF6 and the grp78 promoter, that overexpression of SEPS1 inhibits UPR events triggered by ZAAT overexpression. The ER is an essential intracellular organelle for the synthesis and maturation of cell surface and secretory proteins and maintenance of calcium homeostasis. In hepatocytes in particular, it is extremely active, with an estimated synthesis of 13 million secretory proteins/min (26Mullins C. The Biogenesis of Cellular Organelles. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2005: 63-95Crossref Google Scholar). Disruption of these physiological functions leads to accumulation of unfolded proteins and can induce UPR (4Ron D. Walter P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4929) Google Scholar, 27Wu J. Kaufman R.J. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 374-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). ATF6 is a type II transmembrane protein of the ER, which migrates to the Golgi compartment, where it is cleaved by site-1 protease and site-2 protease. The cleaved cytosolic N-terminal fragment of ATF6 migrates to the nucleus and acts as an active transcription factor, together with ATF4 and spliced XBP1, to increase the expression of the genes encoding proteins that function to augment the ER protein folding capacity. These gene targets include those encoding ER chaperones, such as BiP/GRP78 itself. ZAAT polymerizes and is retained in the ER (28Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1992; 357: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). Here we link this event to ATF6 activation and show that that SEPS1 can reverse the effect. ER stress also induces EOR (16Ron D. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar), which leads to activation of the transcription factor NFκB (29Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2580-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). NFκB is normally found in an inactive cytoplasmic complex with IκB. Upon stimulation of cells with a number of agents, NFκB activity is induced. This involves phosphorylation and degradation of IκB and translocation of NFκB to the nucleus, where it activates transcription of proinflammatory target genes. In this study, we found that accumulation of ZAAT in the ER provided an NFκB-activating stimulus, which was decreased by the presence of increasing SEPS1. NFκB, although a regulator of proinflammatory gene expression, is also known to be cytoprotective. It remains to be determined if preventing excessive activation of NFκB represents a therapeutic benefit, since it would be important to avoid its complete suppression. The anti-inflammatory effects of selenium are also mediated via an increased production of 15d-PGJ2 as an adaptive response to protect cells against oxidative stress-induced proinflammatory gene expression (30Vunta H. Davis F. Palempalli U.D. Bhat D. Arner R.J. Thompson J.T. Peterson D.G. Reddy C.C. Prabhu K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17964-17973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The IKK complex is a key kinase in the NFκB cascade. IKKβ has the dominant role in signal-induced phosphorylation and degradation of the inhibitory and cytoplasmic retention protein of the NFκB complex, IκBα. IKKβ is also subject to control by cyclopentone prostaglandins, such as PGA1 and 15d-PGJ2. It has been shown that selenium supplementation of macrophages leads to an increase in 15d-PGJ2 via arachidonic acid oxidation by COX1. It has also been shown that some anti-inflammatory effects of 15d-PGJ2 were mediated by PPARγ-dependent mechanisms. We explored this mechanism of action of selenium by performing 15d-PGJ2 assays to demonstrate an increased concentration in cells supplemented with selenium. In the experiments investigating grp78 promoter and NFκB activity in HepG2 cells, in the presence of selenium supplementation, we showed an additive effect to the inhibition when SEPS1 was overexpressed and selenium was supplemented. We had shown that SEPS1 exerted a direct effect, but the effect of selenium could potentially be through the effect on the selenoprotein, SEPS1, or via 15d-PGJ2. This in vitro work raises the potential of selenium supplementation as a therapeutic option in preventing liver disease in patients affected with Z variant AAT. Interestingly, the SEPS1 gene is located on chromosome 15q26.3, a region associated with the conformational diseases diabetes and Alzheimer disease. SEPS1 is also a strong functional and positional candidate gene for various inflammation-related disorders, and genetic correlation studies have shown that the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor α, and IL-6 may be affected by a gene that jointly influences their expression (31Curran J.E. Jowett J.B. Elliott K.S. Gao Y. Gluschenko K. Wang J. Abel Azim D.M. Cai G. Mahaney M.C. Comuzzie A.G. Dyer T.D. Walder K.R. Zimmet P. MacCluer J.W. Collier G.R. Kissebah A.H. Blangero J. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 1234-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Curran et al. (31Curran J.E. Jowett J.B. Elliott K.S. Gao Y. Gluschenko K. Wang J. Abel Azim D.M. Cai G. Mahaney M.C. Comuzzie A.G. Dyer T.D. Walder K.R. Zimmet P. MacCluer J.W. Collier G.R. Kissebah A.H. Blangero J. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 1234-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) identified a key single nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region of SEPS1 at position −105 that showed significant correlation to IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor α, and IL-6 plasma levels and demonstrated overwhelming support for a role of the SEPS1 −105G→A single nucleotide polymorphism as a functional variant for these proinflammatory biomarkers. This may be important in AAT deficiency, given that an aberrant inflammatory response is a probable factor determining the severity and outcome of disease. The SEPS1 promoter is GC-rich and contains one conserved and one potential ER stress response element II (ERSE), a consensus-binding site for transcription factors regulating ER stress responses. ERSEs are involved in the stress inducibility of ER proteins that assist protein folding in the ER and promote cell survival under stress conditions. The SEPS1 −105G→A single nucleotide polymorphism is located in the putative ERSEII. The A allele confers lower promoter activity than the G allele in response to stimulation with tunicamycin. Furthermore, the A allele is associated with higher cytokine levels. Thus, the phenotypes associated with the SEPS1 −105A allele are decreased SEPS1 expression and ERAD function and increased cytokine production. Many countries in Europe and other parts of the world still have a dietary selenium intake below what is recommended by health regulatory bodies (32Combs Jr., G.F. Br. J. Nutr. 2001; 85: 517-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Rayman M.P. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 2005; 64: 527-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). In the United States, where dietary intakes are higher than in many other countries, the current recommendation is 55 μg/day. This level is based on optimizing plasma glutathione peroxidase enzyme activity. Recommendations for intake are higher in European populations, where selenium intake is considerably lower. Suboptimal selenium status may increase susceptibility to various chronic disorders and is likely to lead to suboptimal functioning of the beneficial properties of SEPS1, which we have demonstrated. In our work, we measured serum selenium levels in ZZ patients and compared these with MM phenotypes. There was no difference between the two groups; however, we did find that the serum levels of selenium were in the lower range of normal and were not at the level likely to lead to optimal functioning of selenoproteins. Nonetheless, the sample size tested was very small, and any conclusions should be tested in an independent study with a larger sample size. Considerable variation in serum selenium levels is expected based on geographic location, and specific locations associated with low selenium may be important for individuals with AAT deficiency living there. In view of these results, we believe that selenium supplementation has potential to be investigated as a therapeutic option for the liver disease associated with AAT deficiency. Taken together, these data point to the important role of selenium in the diet as an essential factor required to enhance the function of selenoproteins. Optimizing SEPS1 activity, particularly in cases where the −105A allele is present, could be of tremendous therapeutic benefit to an individual coping with intracellular accumulation of misfolded proteins, such as ZAAT. In summary, we found that SEPS1 down-regulated a number of markers of the response to ER stress induced by ZAAT. We demonstrated that supplementation with selenium enhances the effect of this selenoprotein. We also showed effects of the anti-inflammatory selenium through the 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 pathway. We demonstrated the selenium level to be in the low normal range for our population and below the optimal level for function of the antioxidant effect of selenoproteins. The potential therapies for conformational diseases, such as ZAAT deficiency, includes therapies directed at preventing polymerization of the aberrant protein, chemical chaperones, and anti-inflammatories. We have demonstrated how selenium can address two of these pathways. This is an essential trace element that is frequently low in adult populations and can be easily supplemented."

The intestinal mucosa is considered to be the main site used by these bacteria for entrance and dissemination. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in colonization and invasion of enterococci may help to devise methods to prevent infections in hospitalized patients. Glycosaminoglycans, which are present on the surface of all eukaryotic cells, were investigated with regard to their role as host receptors for adhesion of E. faecalis. Competitive binding assays, enzymatic digestion, and reduction of the sulfation of the glycosaminoglycan chains indicated that heparin and heparan sulfate, but not chondroitin sulfate B, played important roles in adhesion of E. faecalis 12030 to Caco2 cells. By using proteinases and carbohydrate oxidation by sodium meta-periodate to modify the bacterial surface, it could be demonstrated that a sugar-containing molecule rather than a protein is the bacterial ligand mediating adhesion to eukaryotic cells. Preincubation of Caco2 cells with the enterococcal glycolipid diglucosyldiacylglycerol but not other carbohydrate cell wall components inhibited bacterial binding. These results may indicate that heparin and/or heparan sulfate on host epithelial cells and diglucosyldiacylglycerol, either itself or as a partial structure of lipoteichoic acid, are involved in enterococcal adhesion to colonic epithelia, the first step in translocation from the intestinal tract.

Enterococci are currently the third most common pathogen isolated from bloodstream infections and the second most common nosocomial pathogen in the United States (1.Wisplinghoff H. Bischoff T.

Enterococci are responsible for three to four cases of nosocomial bloodstream infection per 10,000 hospital discharges (3.Banerjee S.N. Emori T.G. Culver D.H. Gaynes R.P. Jarvis W.R. Horan T.

Control. 1989; 17: 323-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Enterococci are endogenously resistant to a variety of antibiotics and have increasingly acquired more resistance mechanisms to antimicrobials, allowing them to survive in hospital and nursing home settings (5.Murray B.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 710-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). The difficulty in treating serious enterococcal infections emphasizes the importance of understanding virulence factors that may be targeted by alternative therapeutics. The rapid increase in vancomycin-resistant enterococcal strains (6.National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System Am. J. Infect. Control. 2004; 32: 470-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2587) Google Scholar) and their general ability to pass this trait on to other pathogens, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus (7.Sievert D.M.

Dis. 2008; 46: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), indicates we are confronting an urgent and expanding problem on multiple fronts. Enterococci seem to have a propensity to colonize and infect certain tissues (such as the gastrointestinal tract, the urogenital tract, and the cardiac endothelia), although they are never found to cause disease in other tissues (e.g. lower respiratory tract). A main route of invasive infection by enterococci is likely initiated by adherence of the microbe to host cells followed by translocation to the gastrointestinal submucosa (8.Berg R.D. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 430-435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar).

It has been shown previously that heparan sulfate proteoglycans on professional and nonprofessional phagocytes mediate invasion of Enterococcus faecalis into cells, where they can resist specific killing mechanisms (11.Baldassarri L.

Because of their complex nature, heparan sulfate proteoglycans are made up of a variety of different structures that have a well defined distribution in different tissues, which is likely an important factor in binding of bacteria to cells (12.Spillmann D.

Cells were cultivated in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% nonessential amino acids in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. All the experiments were performed on cells between the 15th and 25th passage. The following strains were used in this study: E. faecalis 12030 (13.Huebner J. Wang Y. Krueger W.A. Madoff L.C.

Sava I. Kropec A. Holst O. Huebner J. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 71: 1055-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). E. faecalis strains were grown to mid log phase at 37 °C without agitation in tryptic soy broth. Prior to infection of cells, bacteria were washed and resuspended in DMEM. The number of bacteria in the inoculum was initially estimated from previously derived growth curve determinations and confirmed by viable counts for each experiment. LTA was extracted and purified from E. faecalis 12030 as described elsewhere (19.Theilacker C. Kaczynski Z. Kropec A. Fabretti F. Sange T. Holst O. Huebner J. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 5703-5712Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Wall teichoic acid (WTA) was extracted using trichloroacetic acid, as described previously (20.Peschel A. Otto M. Jack R.W. Kalbacher H. Jung G. Götz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8405-8410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar), and further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Sephacryl S-200 column (1 × 90 cm; GE Healthcare) followed by anion-exchange chromatography (1 × 10 cm; Q-Sepharose) using a gradient of 0 to 1 m NaCl. Purity was assessed by 1H NMR analysis. Total membrane lipids were prepared from the organic phase after butanol extraction and purified according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (21.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) and others (22.Gründling A. Schneewind O. J.

The preparations were analyzed by TLC as described elsewhere using α-naphthol staining and appropriate standards (22.Gründling A. Schneewind O. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 2521-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Glycolipids were isolated by preparative layer chromatography. Silica gel plates were loaded with Bligh/Dyer extracts, and the lipid mixture was separated by CHCl3/MeOH/H2O (65:25:4, v/v). Spots staining with α-naphthol were scraped off the plate and eluted by CHCl3. Purity of the glycolipids was evaluated by TLC as described above. Reagents used in this study were purchased from Sigma, except for the following: DMEM (PAN Technologies); trypsin/EDTA, nonessential amino acids, and gentamicin (Invitrogen); tryptic soy broth (Merck); fetal bovine serum (PAA Clone); porcine intestinal heparin and HS (Celsus Laboratories); 2-O-desulfated heparin, 6-O-desulfated heparin, and de-N-sulfated heparin (Neoparin Inc.). Sensor streptavidin chips were from BIAcore (BIAcore AB) and TLC and preparative layer chromatography plates from Merck. Caco2 cells were cultivated in 24-well plates to a density of ∼1 × 105 cells/well for 3–5 days. To infect the monolayers, bacteria were inoculated at a bacterial cell-to-epithelial cell ratio of 100:1. Epithelial cells were incubated with bacteria for 2 h as indicated and then washed and lysed with 0.25% Triton X-100 for 15 min at 37 °C. The lysates were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline and plated. The number of colony-forming units corresponded to the number of bacteria attached and internalized by the cells. The last washes were tested in pilot experiments to ensure that any remaining nonadherent bacteria would be <1% of the total adherent colony-forming units. Invasion experiments were performed as described elsewhere, using the gentamycin protection assay (11.Baldassarri L. Bertuccini L. Creti R. Filippini P. Ammendolia M.G. Koch S. Huebner J. Orefici G. J. Infect. Dis. 2005; 191: 1253-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Glycosaminoglycans were diluted in DMEM and added in various concentrations to the epithelial cells 30 min prior to addition of the bacterial inoculum. The adhesion assay was then performed as described above. To test the ability of E. faecalis 12030 to adhere to the epithelial cells after depletion of some of the surface glycosaminoglycans chains, heparin lyase and chondroitin lyase ABC were added to the cells 10 min prior to infection in concentrations between 0.125 and 2 units/ml (25.Barth H. Schafer C. Adah M.I. Zhang F. Linhardt R.J. Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Toida T. Van Kuppevelt T.H. Depla E. Von Weizsacker F. Blum H.E. Baumert T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41003-41012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Additionally, 50 min after infection, the medium was supplemented with the same amount of enzyme, and the incubation was continued for another hour. Treatment of bacteria with various amounts of sodium meta-periodate (0.125–1 mm) for 60 min at 4 °C in the dark was used to study the contribution of surface carbohydrates in bacterial adhesion to Caco2 cells. Sodium meta-periodate was neutralized using ethylene glycol. Purified glycolipids were treated with sodium meta-periodate at 1 mm at 4 °C on a rotor rack in the dark followed by neutralization with ethylene glycol. Glycolipids (67.5–250 μg/ml), LTA (50–500 μg/ml), or WTA (50–500 μg/ml) isolated from enterococcal cell walls were added to the cells 30 min before infection. The assay was then performed as described above. Sodium chlorate (an inhibitor of GAG chain sulfation) (26.Baeuerle P.A. Huttner W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) was added to the cells 48 h prior to the experiments in a concentration between 12.5 and 50 mm as described elsewhere (27.Behling-Kelly E. Vonderheid H. Kim K.S. Corbeil L.B. Czuprynski C.J. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 5311-5318Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For screening of different enterococcal strains a concentration of 50 mm was used. Surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed on a BIAcore 3000 operated using the version software. Buffers were filtered and degassed for SPR assay. The biotinylated GAGs were immobilized to a streptavidin chip based on the manufacturer's protocol. The biotinylated heparin was prepared by reaction of sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide long-chain biotin (Pierce) with free amino groups of unsubstituted glucosamine residues in the polysaccharide chain. To prepare other biotinylated GAGs (HS, chondroitin sulfate (CS) A, CSB, and CSC), GAGs (5 mg) and amine-PEO3-biotin (5 mg) were dissolved in 200 μl of H2O, and 10 mg of NaCNBH3 was added. The reaction mixture was heated at 70 °C for 24 h, after that a further 10 mg of NaCNBH3 was added, and the reaction was heated at 70 °C for another 24 h. After cooling, the mixture was desalted with the spin column (3000 Da). The biotinylated GAGs were collected and freeze-dried. To prepare the GAGs chip, biotinylated HS, CSA, CSB, and CSC were immobilized on different flow cells in a streptavidin sensor chip (CSA immobilized flow cell served as a control). The successful immobilization of GAGs was confirmed by the observation of an ∼300-resonance unit increase in the sensor chip. To prepare the heparin chip, biotinylated heparin was immobilized with an ∼70-resonance unit increase. For the measurement of glycolipid interaction with GAGs using BIAcore, the glycolipid suspension was prepared in HBS-EP buffer (0.01 m HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% polysorbate 20 (v/v), pH 7.4) by heating to 65 °C for 15 min in a water bath and then sonicated for another 15 min. Glycolipid samples diluted in HBS running buffer (0.01 m HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4) were injected at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. At the end of the sample injection (90 s), the same HBS running buffer (0.01 m HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4) was flowed over the sensor surface to facilitate dissociation for 180 s. After a 3-min dissociation time, the sensor surface was regenerated with injections of 30 μl of 2 m NaCl. The response was monitored as a function of time (sensorgram) at 25 °C. The SPR data were processed by using BIAevaluation software (version 4.0.1, GE Healthcare). Multigroup comparisons were done using ANOVA (PRISM4, GraphPad software). When confluent monolayers of Caco2 cells were incubated for 2–4 h at 37 °C with ∼100 bacteria/cell, adherence of bacteria correlated with the time of incubation (i.e. more bacteria adhered after longer incubation periods). For the invasion assay a higher multiplicity of infection (1000:1) was used because at a multiplicity of infection of 100:1 only few bacteria could be detected inside the cells. The number of internalized bacteria was ∼4 logs smaller than the number of adherent bacteria (data not shown). The involvement of GAGs in the adherence of bacteria to the host cells was investigated using different concentrations of heparins, HS and CSB, to preincubate Caco2 cells monolayers. These polysulfated polysaccharides reduced (up to 56%) the adherence of E. faecalis 12030 to the epithelial cell cultures (Fig. 1, A and B). The highest inhibition was obtained by using the glycosaminoglycan heparin (56% at a concentration of 500 μg/ml); HS also significantly decreased the level of adherence of the bacteria by 50% (concentration of 1000 μg/ml). Binding of bacteria to Caco2 cells was not significantly affected when using CSB (13% at 1000 μg/ml). The inhibition of the bacterial binding was dose-dependent when HS was used (Fig. 1B). For heparin, a dose-dependent inhibition was observed for all but the highest concentration used (Fig. 1A). This latter observation may be explained by the unphysiologically high inhibitor concentration. The structural complexity of heparin is determined by a series of modifications during its biosynthesis, regarding mainly sulfation of the aminosugars and/or uronic acids. To identify the importance of these modifications for bacterial binding, inhibition assays were performed using chemically modified heparins as inhibitors (28.Barth H. Schnober E.K. Zhang F. Linhardt R.J. Depla E. Boson B. Cosset F.L. Patel A.H. Blum H.E. Baumert T.F. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 10579-10590Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, preincubation of cell monolayers with 500 μg/ml normal heparin and 6-O-desulfated heparin decreased bacterial binding by 58 and 56%, respectively. In contrast, both 2-O-desulfated heparin and de-N-sulfated heparin partially lost their inhibitory ability (21 and 23% inhibition, respectively).FIGURE 2Inhibition of bacterial binding to the epithelial cells using chemically modified heparins. Normal heparin, 2-O-desulfated heparin, 6-O-desulfated heparin, and de-N-sulfated heparin (all at 500 μg/ml concentration) were used as inhibitors of bacterial binding. Heparin and 6-O-desulfated heparin significantly reduced bacterial binding to cells (*, p > 0.05, against heparin using ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparison test), whereas 2-O-desulfated heparin and de-N-sulfated heparin partially lost their inhibitory activity (#, p < 0.05 against heparin). Bars represent average ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The role of GAGs in bacterial adhesion was further investigated by treating the target cells with heparin lyase I (which cleaves heparin and HS chains) and chondroitin lyase ABC (which degrades chondroitin sulfate chains). The strongest reduction in adherence occurred after treatment of the cells with heparin lyase I, which reduced enterococcal adhesion by 25–52.5% in a dose-dependent manner, whereas chondroitin lyase ABC had little effect on enterococcal adherence (Fig. 3). Caco2 cells were grown for 48 h in the presence of sodium chlorate (12.5–50 mm) to decrease sulfation of GAG chains. Under these conditions, adherence of the bacteria was reduced by up to 42% (Fig. 4). To determine whether GAGs also mediate adhesion to other enterococcal strains, we tested five more strains in addition to E. faecalis 12030. Two of the strains (FA2-2 and type 9) showed a significant reduction in adhesion to cells treated with sodium chlorate compared with untreated Caco2 cells (Fig. 5). This was comparable with the inhibition obtained when the reference strain E. faecalis 12030 was used (41% inhibition for FA2-2 and 68% inhibition for type 9). No significant difference between the treated and untreated cells was detected for the other strains tested (type 5, OG1-RF, and V583).FIGURE 5Inhibition of different E. faecalis strains binding to Caco2 cells using sodium chlorate treatment. Reduction of GAG chain sulfation by sodium chlorate treatment (50 mm) decreased the ability of E. faecalis 12030, FA2-2, and type 9 strains to adhere (using ANOVA with Bonferroni's multiple comparison test). Meanwhile for the other three strains tested, there was no significant difference in binding to Caco2 cells (data not shown). Bars represent average ± S.E. +, with sodium chlorate; −, without sodium chlorate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To study the specific interactions between bacteria and GAGs, bacterial cells were treated with proteinase K, Pronase E, or sodium meta-periodate. Using bacteria treated with proteinase K or Pronase E, adherence of enterococci to epithelial cells was not impaired, making a protein unlikely to mediate bacterial binding (data not shown). The role of bacterial polysaccharides in adhesion to Caco2 cells was tested after incubation of bacteria with sodium meta-periodate (0.125–1 mm). This treatment resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of enterococcal adhesion to the epithelial cells of 2–100% (Fig. 6). Meta-periodate oxidation and proteinase digestion did not affect bacterial viability, as demonstrated by viable counts (data not shown). Incubation of the epithelial monolayers with LTA (50–500 μg/ml) and WTA (50–500 μg/ml) did not have any effect on bacterial adhesion (data not shown). Using extracts of total membrane lipids, which include glycolipids (concentrations between 67.5 and 250 μg/ml), adhesion to the cells was inhibited by up to 59%, and maximum inhibition was observed at a concentration of 125 μg/ml (Fig. 7). To assess if inhibitory effects of the extracts were because of glycolipids, total membrane lipids were treated with 1 mm sodium meta-periodate. Compared with native material, which reduced adhesion significantly (43%), oxidized glycolipids were not able to inhibit bacterial binding (Fig. 8).FIGURE 8Inactivation of glycolipids with sodium meta-periodate eliminates inhibitory activity. Treatment of glycolipids with 1 mm sodium meta-periodate resulted in a complete loss of the inhibitory activity of enterococcal glycolipids on adherence to Caco2 cells.

Data points represent individual replicates, and lines represent the mean.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further corroborate their role in bacterial binding and exclude nonspecific effects mediated by other membrane lipids, the two major glycolipids of E. faecalis (MGlcDAG and DGlcDAG) were purified (Fig. 9). Whereas MGlcGAG did not significantly affect bacterial binding, DGlcDAG inhibited adhesion up to 47% (Fig. 9). The interaction between glycolipids and GAGs was examined by SPR. Biotinylated GAGs were immobilized on a streptavidin sensor chip, and the glycolipid in the running buffer was injected at different concentrations. Sensorgrams of DGlcDAG-heparin, DGlcDAG-HS, DGlcDAG-CSB, and DGlcDAG-CSC interactions are shown in Fig. 10. Surface plasmon resonance demonstrated a stronger binding signal (resonance units) of HS to DGlcDAG, in comparison with CSB or CSC (Fig. 10, B and D). The binding of heparin and HS to DGlcDAG was concentration-dependent (Fig. 10, A and D), suggesting the interaction is specific. The KD value for DGlcDAG binding to heparin can be estimated at ∼60 μm. The binding of CSB or CSC to DGlcDAG was not concentration-dependent, and the interaction was low. No binding was observed (negative signal) for MGlcDAG-GAGs interactions (Fig. 10C). Many pathogenic bacteria establish infections after adhering to host surfaces by means of specific surface structures or motifs. Adhesion is usually the first step leading to colonization and subsequent infection. The intestinal tract is a source of many nosocomial pathogens, including E. faecalis, which can cause invasive infections such as bacteremia or endocarditis in otherwise healthy individuals. Other bacteria that are phylogenetically related, such as group A or group B streptococci, colonize different host epithelia and infect distinct target organs. Various structures on eukaryotic cells and tissues have been identified as targets for adhesion by microorganisms (29.Ofek I. Hasty D.L. Doyle R.J. Bacterial Adhesion to Animal Cells and Tissues. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2003: 177-407Google Scholar). Many of these molecules have been characterized as belonging to the family of proteoglycans (9.Rostand K.S. Esko J.D. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several investigators have used purified GAGs as competitive inhibitors of adhesion to study the role of these molecules in the attachment of various pathogens to host surfaces (9.Rostand K.S. Esko J.D. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Different glycosaminoglycans are distinguished based on the charge of the carbohydrate chains. Chondroitin sulfate usually contains one sulfate group per disaccharide unit, although in HS the amount of sulfate residues varies between 0.8 and 1.4. Heparin is the most sulfated glycosaminoglycan, with an average of 2.4 sulfate groups per disaccharide (9.Rostand K.S. Esko J.D. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Differences in binding to specific glycosaminoglycans and tissue-specific expression profiles of proteoglycans may account for tropism of pathogens in invasive infection and colonization (12.Spillmann D. Biochimie. 2001; 83: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It has been shown recently that binding of Escherichia coli O157:H7 to colonic epithelial cells is blocked by heparin and HS in a dose-dependent fashion (30.Gu L. Wang H. Guo Y.L. Zen K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 369: 1061-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Adhesion to GAGs has also been demonstrated in a variety of Gram-positive organisms as follows: Streptococcus pneumoniae binds to heparin, HS, and chondroitin sulfate (31.Tonnaer E.L. Hafmans T.G. Van Kuppevelt T.H. Sanders E.A. Verweij P.E. Curfs J.H. Microbes Infect. 2006; 8: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); staphylococci bind to CSA (32.Fallgren C. Andersson A. Ljungh A. Curr. Microbiol. 2001; 43: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and HS (33.Hess D.J. Henry-Stanley M.J. Erlandsen S.L. Wells C.L. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 2006; 195: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); Streptococcus pyogenes recognizes dermatan sulfate, HS, and heparin (34.Frick I.M. Schmidtchen A. Sjöbring U. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2303-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar); and Streptococcus mutans binds mainly heparin (35.Choi S.H. Stinson M.W. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 3834-3840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding partners for glycosaminoglycans on the bacterial surface have been characterized for some bacterial species, whereas for others there is still controversy. All the known binding ligands of proteoglycans to date are surface proteins. Baron et al. (36.Baron M.J. Bolduc G.R. Goldberg M.B. Aupérin T.C. Madoff L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24714-24723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and Auperin et al. (37.Aupérin T.C. Bolduc G.R. Baron M.J. Heroux A. Filman D.J. Madoff L.C. Hogle J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18245-18252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) found that α-C protein of Streptococcus agalactiae binds to proteoglycans on the ME180 cervical epithelial cell line. In S. pyogenes Frick et al. (34.Frick I.M. Schmidtchen A. Sjöbring U. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2303-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) showed that there is a strong correlation between M protein expression and the ability of the bacteria to bind to glycosaminoglycans, especially dermatan sulfate. A different protein, ActA, has been shown to be responsible for the attachment of Listeria monocytogenes to host cell heparin and HS (38.Alvarez-Domínguez C. Vázquez-Boland J.A. Carrasco-Marín E. López-Mato P. Leyva-Cobián F. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 78-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Baldassarri et al. (11.Baldassarri L. Bertuccini L. Creti R. Filippini P. Ammendolia M.G. Koch S. Huebner J. Orefici G. J. Infect. Dis. 2005; 191: 1253-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) showed that heparin, HS, and to a lesser extent CSA act as the host receptors for enterococci on phagocytes. Our data corroborate most of the findings of Baldassarri et al. (11.Baldassarri L. Bertuccini L. Creti R. Filippini P. Ammendolia M.G. Koch S. Huebner J. Orefici G. J. Infect. Dis. 2005; 191: 1253-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast to their results, however, we did not see any inhibition by CSB in our experiments. These differences may be explained by the fact that we used a different cell line (i.e. Caco2) derived from colon cancer, whereas Baldassarri et al. (11.Baldassarri L. Bertuccini L. Creti R. Filippini P. Ammendolia M.G. Koch S. Huebner J. Orefici G. J. Infect. Dis. 2005; 191: 1253-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) used professional and nonprofessional phagocytes. The data presented here confirm that in the early stages of infection enterococci use heparan sulfate-containing proteoglycans as receptors on the host cells. Inhibition of bacterial binding was observed in the presence of soluble heparin and HS. Pretreatment of the cells with heparin lyase I and sodium chlorate also reduced bacterial binding to Caco2 cells. Binding of ligands to heparan sulfate depends on defined patterns and orientations of the sulfo and carboxyl groups along the polysaccharide chain (39.Muñoz E.M. Linhardt R.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 1549-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Heparin is distinguished from heparin sulfate by much higher levels of N- and O-sulfo groups. In recent years, numerous heparan sulfate biosynthetic enzymes have been identified that are involved in the modification of the heparan sulfate chain (40.Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). These modifications include 2-O-sulfation of iduronic and glucuronic acid, N-sulfation of glucosamine, as well as 6-O-sulfation and 3-O-sulfation of glucosamine (40.Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Here we provide evidence that N-sulfation and 2-O- but not 6-O-sulfation are required for DGlcDAG-heparan sulfate interaction. This conclusion is supported by the observations that 6-O-desulfated heparin was able to inhibit bacterial binding, whereas 2-O-desulfated heparin as well as de-N-sulfated heparin partially lost their inhibitory activity. These findings support the conclusion that specific sulfate groups on cellular heparin sulfate rather than the total level of sulfation may be important for mediating DGlcDAG-host cell interaction. Interestingly, the sulfation pattern required for inhibition of DGlcDAG binding was different from the sulfation pattern mediating hepatitis C virus envelope glycoprotein-heparan sulfate interaction (28.Barth H. Schnober E.K. Zhang F. Linhardt R.J. Depla E. Boson B. Cosset F.L. Patel A.H. Blum H.E. Baumert T.F. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 10579-10590Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). These findings further confirm the relevance and specificity of these modifications for DGlcDAG-heparan sulfate interactions. Inhibition of bacterial binding to epithelia using sodium chlorate was used to investigate whether utilization of GAGs is strain-specific. Because adhesion of three of six strains tested could be inhibited by sodium chlorate treatment, we conclude that, although proteoglycans may not act as receptor for all the enterococcal strains, this mechanism is not a unique feature of E. faecalis 12030. Our data indicate that a carbohydrate cell wall structure, and not a protein, is involved in adhesion to Caco2 cells because treatment with sodium meta-periodate abrogated binding of the bacteria, whereas treatment with proteinases did not impair it. There are only a few examples of glycoconjugates mediating adhesion to eukaryotic cells. Guzman et al. (41.Guzmàn C.A. Pruzzo C. Platè M. Guardati M.C. Calegari L. Microb. Pathog. 1991; 11: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) treated E. faecalis isolates with sodium meta-periodate showing that adherence to the human cell line Girardi heart is mediated by carbohydrate residues on the bacterial surface. By using d-galactose and l-fucose, they were able to inhibit binding of the bacteria to the heart cells. Beachey and co-workers (42.Courtney H.S. von Hunolstein C. Dale J.B. Bronze M.S. Beachey E.H. Hasty D.L. Microb. Pathog. 1992; 12: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) studied adhesion of S. pyogenes to Hep-2 cells and found that LTA is part of a two-step adhesion process to the host cells. The role of LTA in invasion of brain microvascular endothelial cells by group B streptococci was studied by Doran et al. (43.Doran K.S. Engelson E.J. Khosravi A. Maisey H.C. Fedtke I. Equils O. Michelsen K.S. Arditi M. Peschel A. Nizet V. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2499-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) in a deletion mutant of the iagA gene. IagA is responsible for the synthesis of DGlcDAG, the cell surface anchor of LTA, and its inactivation resulted in attenuated virulence and reduced translocation from the bloodstream into the cerebrospinal fluid (43.Doran K.S. Engelson E.J. Khosravi A. Maisey H.C. Fedtke I. Equils O. Michelsen K.S. Arditi M. Peschel A. Nizet V. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2499-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The authors concluded that LTA is the bacterial cell surface structure that interacts with the blood-brain barrier endothelium. Using a mutant in a glycosyltransferase gene with high similarity to iagA, we were able to demonstrate that this mutant is also deficient in DGlcDAG. The mutant strain adhered significantly less to Caco2 cells (18.Theilacker C. Sanchez-Carballo P. Toma I. Fabretti F. Sava I. Kropec A. Holst O. Huebner J. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 71: 1055-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Here we show that purified DGlcDAG efficiently inhibited adhesion, although MGlcDAG had no effect. Because we demonstrated that a large proportion of enterococcal strains bind to Caco2 cells through highly sulfated heparan sulfates and that bacterial glycolipids are able to specifically inhibit this attachment, we were interested in measuring the interaction between these molecules. Using surface plasmon resonance experiments, a high affinity interaction of heparin was only shown for DGlcDAG, whereas for MGlcDAG, which differs only by the lack of a terminal α-d-glucose (Fig. 9), no detectable binding was observed. As for the binding of DGlcDAG to different GAGs, high affinity binding was observed for heparin and HS, which represent the most sulfated GAGs present on eukaryotic cells. DGlcDAG is found in the enterococcal cell wall as a membrane glycolipid and also as a partial structure of LTA (44.Fischer W. Kates M. Glycolipids, Phosphoglycolipids, and Sulfoglycolipids. Publishing Corp., New York1990: 123-234Google Scholar). Because of the spatial arrangement of the cell wall, a direct interaction of membrane-bound glycolipids with GAGs is difficult to envision. Both glycolipids and LTA, however, are also shed from the cells during growth and turnover of the bacterial cell wall (45.Ofek I. Simpson W.A. Beachey E.H. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 149: 426-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LTA is also known to be able to insert its glycolipid anchor into eukaryotic membranes (46.Beachey E.H. Dale J.B. Grebe S. Ahmed A. Simpson W.A. Ofek I. J. Immunol. 1979; 122: 189-195PubMed Google Scholar, 47.Beachey E.H. Dale J.B. Simpson W.A. Evans J.D. Knox K.W. Ofek I. Wicken A.J. Infect. Immun. 1979; 23: 618-625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesize that LTA shed from planktonic bacteria is inserted into the eukaryotic membrane and interacts with GAGs by its kojibiose residue of the glycolipid anchor. By its polyglycerol phosphate moiety, which now extends toward the interface between host cells and pathogens, it binds to a bacterial cell surface receptor, which yet needs to be defined. A similar model was suggested for S. pyogenes (32.Fallgren C. Andersson A. Ljungh A. Curr. Microbiol. 2001; 43: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This model is supported by our experimental findings as follows: (i) because saturating the LTA-binding sites on the eukaryotic cell by preincubation with DGlcDAG, a bridging by reoriented LTA would be blocked; and (ii) by using the LTA molecule for preincubation no such inhibition would be achieved due to the additional presence of polyglycerol phosphate in the inhibitor, the putative binding moiety to the bacterial cell surface receptor. Further experiments will need to clarify the exact mechanism of the adhesion. To our knowledge, however, this is the first time that bacterial adhesion mediated by the interaction of two carbohydrate structures has been demonstrated. Although several mechanisms, receptors, and putative virulence factors have been proposed for the interaction of enterococci with mammalian cells, there is still no good understanding of the occasional transition from usually benign commensal to deadly pathogen. Future studies of the role of surface proteoglycans and carbohydrate containing surface components may help to develop new strategies to prevent and treat enterococcal infections. We thank Dr. G.

https://openalex.org/W2091145965,"Artemia has attracted much attention for its ability to produce encysted embryos wrapped in a protective shell when subject to extremely harsh environmental conditions. However, what the cyst shell is synthesized from and how the formative process is performed remains, as yet, largely unknown. Over 20 oviparous specifically expressed genes were identified through screening the subtracted cDNA library enriched between oviparous and ovoviviparous Artemia ovisacs. Among them, a shell gland-specifically expressed gene (SGEG) has been found to be involved in the cyst shell formation. Lacking SGEG protein (by RNA interference) caused the cyst shell to become translucent and the chorion layer of the shell to become less compact and pultaceous and to show a marked decrease of iron composition within the shell. The RNA interference induced defective diapause cysts with a totally compromised resistibility to UV irradiation, extremely large temperature differences, osmotic pressure, dryness, and organic solvent stresses. In contrast, the natural cyst would provide adequate protection from all such factors. SGEG contains a 345-bp open reading frame, and its consequentially translated peptide consists of a 33-amino acid residue putative signal peptide and an 81-amino acid residue mature peptide. The results of Northern blotting and in situ hybridization indicate that the gene is specifically expressed in the cells of shell glands during the period of diapause cyst formation of oviparous Artemia.

Salt lakes on plateaus, are widely known as “seas of death,” because they represent one of the most hostile environments on the earth in terms of extreme salinity, high pH, anoxia, large temperature differences, and intermittent dry conditions. Hardly any animal can survive such extremes. However, one notable exception lies in the shape of a small crustacean, Artemia. Artemia, also called the brine shrimp, is an ancient species that first appeared ∼400 million years ago (1Dattilo A.M. Bracchini L. Carlini L. Loiselle S. Rossi C. Int. J. Biometeorol. 2005; 49: 388-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To cope with harsh and complex habitats such as salt lakes, Artemia are able, when the circumstances become adverse, to release their offspring into a dormant, encysted state, rather than simply releasing swimming nauplius, to ensure survival. Such adverse conditions include environments where the Artemia may experience high salinity, low oxygen levels, short days, or conditions of extreme temperature variation (2Clegg J.S. Trotman C.N.A.

Nambu F. J. Exp. Zool. Part A. Comp. Exp. Biol. 2004; 301: 542-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These dormant cysts will keep diapause until the state is terminated by activation (triggered by factors such as desiccation, dehydration, cold or chemical treatment), at which point they resume development when appropriate and stable environmental conditions have arisen (4Nambu Z.

The diapause cysts, with their greatly reduced metabolic activity, contain embryos existing as late gastrulae and are composed of ∼4000 cells that are arrested at the G2/M phase with a complete turning off of RNA and protein synthesis (8Clegg J.S.

Previous studies indicate that the resistance and resumption ability of Artemia cysts have several causes. In addition to the arrested cell cycle, it has been noted that large amounts of two molecular chaperone proteins, namely p26 and artemin, are synthesized (10MacRae T.H. Semin. Cell Dev.

In addition to falling into diapause, Artemia themselves secrete a rigid noncellular shell to cope with the extreme environmental stresses before they release the diapause cysts. The complex noncellular cyst shell consists of two main regions; the outer region, secreted by the shell gland, is of hypochlorite-soluble chorion, whereas the hypochlorite-resistant inner region is formed by blastoderm cells and comprises the embryonic cuticle (5Drinkwater L.E. Clegg J.S. Browne R.A. Sorgeloos P. Trotman C.N.A. Artemia Biology. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 93-118Google Scholar, 20Morris J.E. Afzelius B.A. J. Ultrastruct.

The shell glands, which are composed of clusters of secretory cells, are situated at the ovisac and open into the uterus. There are many dark brown secretory granules, which probably contain chorion material and pigments such as hematin formed in the cells of the shell glands at the point where the oocytes emerge in the ovaries during the reproductive period. These are secreted out at the second day after the oocytes enter the uterus. Therefore the shell glands vary from dark brown to white, even to colorless, as reproductive cycles differ (22Criel G.R.J.

Tech. 2006; 69: 957-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) reveal that both the chorion and the embryonic cuticle have an exquisite structure (21Clegg J.S. Jackson S.A. Liang P. MacRae T.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Chorion consists of two distinct layers. First, a compact outer covering is over the cyst with many radially aligned aeropyles penetrating through. This is known as the cortical layer. Second, in a cavernous region below the cortical layer is the alveolar layer, which may act as a float for the newly laid cysts. A thin supra cortical layer, probably consisting of cuticulin, covers the outer surface of the cortical layer. The embryonic cuticle, which is impermeable to nonvolatile solutes, is otherwise composed of a broad multilamellar region as a fibrous layer sandwiched between the outer and inner cuticular membranes and constructed as a tripartite structure. This forms an area of relative independence from the external environment and serves to maintain the homeostasis of inorganic ions (2Clegg J.S. Trotman C.N.A. Abatzopoulos TH.J. Beardmore J.A. Clegg J.S. Sorgeloos P. Artemia: Basic and Applied Biology. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2002: 129-170Google Scholar). The molecular formulation of the cyst shell is complex, and details remain unclear, although it is known that the cyst shell does contain chitin, lipoprotein, hematin, and some metal elements (25Yosefali A.

Universa Press, Wetteren, Belgium1980: 11-54Google Scholar), the cyst shell also plays an important role in protecting the embryo within from other lethal environmental stresses. Previous experimental data have confirmed the protective capabilities of the cyst shell. Tanguay et al. (29Tanguay J.A. Reyes R.C. Clegg J.S. J. Biosci. 2004; 29: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) indicated that the hatching rate of intact cysts is significantly higher than the decapsulated ones after ultraviolet irradiation treatment. Hematin, the hemopigment of the cyst shell, is also demonstrated to have a light-screening function (27Van der Linden A. Blust R. Cuypers K. Thoeye C. Bernaerts F. Artemia Research and Its Applications: 2. Physiology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology.in: Decleir W. Moens L. Slegers H. Sorgeloos P. Jaspers E.

Biol. 2005; 45: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) indicated that the cyst shell plays a critical role in desiccation tolerance, because the rate of dehydration of decapsulated cysts is much higher than intact ones in the dehydration study, and rapid water loss significantly reduces the hatching level of dehydrated cysts. Liu et al. (31Liu F.Q. Ji B.C. Xuan C.H. Anim. Sci. Vet. Med. 2002; 83: 10-11Google Scholar) also found that intact cysts have better thermotolerance than decapsulated ones in both dry and water heating studies. In our experiments, through the in vivo gene knockdown by RNA interference, a shell gland-specifically expressed gene (SGEG) has been found to be involved in the cyst shell formation. The formed cyst shell has been demonstrated to play an important role in resistance to UV irradiation, large temperature differences, osmotic pressure, dryness, and organic solution stresses. The oviparous Artemia were reared in 8% (w/v) artificial seawater (Blue Starfish, China) under light and dark cycles of 4 h (12:00–16:00) and 20 h, respectively. Otherwise the ovoviviparous Artemia were reared in 3% (w/v) artificial seawater under light and dark cycles of 16 h (7:00–23:00) and 8 h, respectively. The water temperature was kept at 28 °C. Chlorella powder was supplemented as brine shrimp food (Fuqing King Dnarmsa Spirulina Co. Ltd., Fuqing, China). A sufficient amount of both oviparous and ovoviviparous Artemia, at the stage where oocytes are stored in lateral pouches (the stage usually only lasting less than 6 h), were collected and temporarily cultured. Both types were used for isolating ovisacs each day throughout the reproductive cycle (for 5 days). The collected ovisacs were marked as either oviparous or ovoviviparous samples, and the day of collection was noted (from day 1 to day 5). The Artemia used for isolating ovisacs were placed in an ice bath for 1–2 min until they were lightly anesthetized. Then the ovisac was dissected, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until RNA preparation. The total RNAs of both oviparous and ovoviviparous ovisacs were extracted individually by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). One microgram of each total RNA was used to synthesize the first strand cDNA by PowerScriptTM reverse transcriptase (Takara Bio Company, Otsu, Japan) at 42 °C for 90 min, and two adaptors were added to both endings by 3′ SMART CDS Primer II A and SMART II A Oligonucleotide (Super SMARTTM PCR cDNA synthesis kit; Takara Bio Company, Japan). The first strand cDNAs, purified by NucleoSpin® columns, were amplified using 5′ PCR Primer II A for optimized cycles, and the double-stranded cDNAs were finally purified by NucleoSpin® columns once again. For SSH, 2The abbreviations used are: SSHsuppression subtractive hybridizationDIGdigoxingeninRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsdsdouble-strandedRNAiRNA interferenceSEMscanning electron microscopeFE-SEM/EDSfield emission SEM/energy dispersive system. the double-stranded cDNAs of oviparous ovisac samples from day 1 to day 5 were mixed in equal parts as a tester, whereas the double-stranded cDNAs of ovoviviparous ovisac samples from day 1 to day 5 were mixed in equal parts as a driver. The subtractive library was then generated using the Clontech PCR-Select cDNA subtraction kit (Takara Bio Company), according to established protocols. After two cycles of hybridization and two cycles of PCR amplification, a total of 84 individual recombinant clones in pUCm-T vector (Bio Basic Inc., Markham, Canada) were picked and used as templates for PCR amplification using vector primers M13F and M13R. Each PCR product (1 μl) was spotted onto a nylon membrane (Hybond-N; Amersham Biosciences), hybridized with the probes of tester and driver cDNA in order, and detected by the DIG chemiluminescent detection system (DIG High Prime DNA labeling and detection starter kit II; Roche Applied Science). suppression subtractive hybridization digoxingenin rapid amplification of cDNA ends double-stranded RNA interference scanning electron microscope field emission SEM/energy dispersive system. All of the clones that exhibited distinct expression differences according to the result of SSH were sequenced (Sangon, Shanghai, China). One full-length cDNA of them (SGEG) was achieved by 3′- and 5′-RACE methods. The gene-specific primers CRaceF for 3′-RACE and CRaceR for 5′-RACE (Table 1) were designed based on the nucleotide sequences of SGEG, and the cDNAs for RACE were synthesized from the total RNA of oviparous ovisacs. All of the processes of 3′- and 5′-RACE were following the manufacturer's protocol of FirstChoiceTM RLM-RACE kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The sequenced cDNA was analyzed by using Lasergene software (DNAStar Inc.), and the deduced amino acid sequence of the peptide was predicted by the PredictProtein and Scratch Protein Predictor website. Otherwise the Blast (blastx and blastn) program was performed using the NCBI website. The nucleotide sequence of SGEG was submitted to GenBankTM under the accession number EU683079.TABLE 1Nucleotide sequences and positions of primers used in polymerase chain reactionsPrimerLengthPositionDirectionSequence (5′ → 3′)bpCRaceF20273–292FTTTGACGGACACCAACTTAGCRaceR20121–140RTTCTTTGGCAGCTTCCTCTGCExpF3037–57FCGCGGATCCATGGGGGTAAAGGAAGTTTTGCRiR31410–432RGCTCTAGACTAAATTTGCATCTGTTTAATCCCExpR30400–420RCCGCTCGAGCTGTTTAATCCAGTAAGCAACGFPF30122–144FGGAATTCAACTTACCCTTAATTTTATTTGCGFPR28461–480RGCTCTAGAGCCATTCTTTGGTTTGTCTCCQF20121–140FCAGAGGAAGCTGCCAAAGAACQR20273–292RCTAAGTTGGTGTCCGTCAAATubF20532–551FTCTACTGCCGTTGTTGAGCCTubR20694–713RATGGAGGAAACGATTTGACC Open table in a new tab A pair of primers (CExpF and CRiR in Table 1) were designed for the preparation of SGEG dsRNA. A 361-bp cDNA fragment was subcloned into the plasmid pET-T7 (17Dai J.Q. Zhu X.J. Liu F.Q. Xiang J.H. Nagasawa H. Yang W.J. J. Biol.

For negative control, a 359-bp GFP cDNA fragment was amplified using the primers GFPF and GFPR (Table 1) and subcloned into the pET-T7 vector at the same restriction sites. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli HT115, and the dsRNAs were produced and purified as described by Yodmuang et al. (32Yodmuang S. Tirasophon W. Roshorm Y. Chinnirunvong W. Panyim S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Based upon the basic and quantitative controls (supplemental Fig. S1), 300 ng of SGEG dsRNA was injected into the reproductive segments of Artemia at the instar XII stage (before ovarian development). An UltraMicroPump II equipped with the Micro4TM microsyringe pump controller was used for the microinjection. Both RNAi and control Artemia were cultured in 8% artificial seawater under the condition of light/dark cycles of 4/20 h. The RNAi-induced and control cysts were observed by light microscopes and collected for the following experiments. Total RNAs were extracted from ovisacs (lateral pouches filled with oocytes) of RNAi-induced Artemia and controls. After reverse transcription, all real time PCRs were performed on the Bio-Rad MiniOpticonTM real time PCR System using the SYBR® Premix Ex TaqTM (Takara Bio Inc.) and 200 nm SGEG-specific primers (CQF/CQR and TubF/TubR in Table 1). Relative transcript levels are presented as fold change calculated using the comparative CT method as described by Livak and Schmittgen (33Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D.

Protoc. 2008; 3: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (17485) Google Scholar) with α-tubulin cDNA as the internal reference. All of the data are given as the means ± S.E. of independent experiments from six separate RNA pools. All statistical analyses were performed using the one-way analysis of variance, and the difference was considered significant for p < 0.01. A transmission electron microscopic study was carried out to search for differences between the shells of RNAi-induced and those of control cysts, following the method described by Hofmann et al. (35Hofmann G.E. Hand S.C. J. Exp. Zool. 1990; 253: 287-302Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Both cysts were nicked and fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde prepared in 3% NaCl for 12 h. Then they were washed and postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in 3% NaCl solution, dehydrated in graded acetone series, and embedded in spurr resin. Sections of ∼70 nm were cut with microtome (UC6; Leica), stained with 2% uranyl acetate and Reynold's solution (0.2% sodium citrate and 0.2% lead nitrate), then viewed in a transmission electron microscope (JEM-1230; JEOL), and photographed at a voltage of 70 kV. For SEM and FE-SEM/EDA analysis, the RNAi-induced and control cysts were individually fixed by 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 2 h. Then these cysts were washed and dehydrated in graded acetone series and critical point dried with CO2 using a critical point dryer (Hitachi HCP-2). These were used for FE-SEM/EDS (Sirion SEM System, FEI Co., Hillsboro, OR) analysis directly or sputter-coated with gold (Hitachi E-1010) for scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi S-3000N). Equal numbers of the RNAi induced and control cysts were homogenized in 8 m urea individually and boiled for 10 min. After centrifugation to remove insoluble shell fragments, the supernatants were quantified using the Bradford method (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Twenty micrograms of protein of each sample were electrophoresed on 15% polyacrylamide gels and detected by Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The open reading frame of SGEG cDNA was amplified using the primers CExpF and CExpR (Table 1) and cloned into the pET-32 vector with an N-terminal His6 tag. Recombinant SGEG protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen), and the anti-SGEG antibody was raised in rabbit (HuaAn Biotechnology Co. LTD.). Fifty micrograms of protein of each sample were separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) for Western blotting analysis. The membranes were incubated with anti-SGEG antibody and anti-α-tubulin antibody (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) overnight at 4 °C and detected using the BM Chemiluminescence Western blotting kit (Roche Applied Science). A sufficient number of RNAi-induced and control cysts were collected for the anti-environmental stress test, which included dryness, UV irradiation, high temperature, freezing, extreme osmotic pressure, and organic solvent tests. Triplicate experiments were performed for each of these physiological stresses. For the test of dryness, both the RNAi-induced and control cysts were air dried and kept at room temperature with continual observation. For the UV irradiation test, both the RNAi-induced and control cysts were exposed to ultraviolet light (∼310 nm) for 3.6 J/cm2. For the high temperature and freezing stress test, the RNAi-induced and control cysts were incubated in the water bath at 50 °C for 5 min or frozen at −30 °C for 3 days. For the test of coping with extreme osmotic pressure, the RNAi-induced and control cysts were soaked in 6 m NaCl for 450 min or in deionized water for 3 days. After the above tests, all RNAi-induced cysts were incubated in 3% artificial sea water with continual illumination at 25 °C for hatching. The hatching rates were then investigated for a period of 72 h. In contrast all the control cysts were activated before hatching by soaking in saturated brine for 24 h and freezing in −20 °C for 3 months. In addition, for the test of resistance to organic solvent, both the RNAi-induced and activated control cysts were incubated in 3% artificial sea water with 0.5 m methanol for investigating hatching rates. A DIG-labeled cDNA fragment (384 bp) was amplified using the primers CExpF and CExpR (Table 1) and used as a probe for the Northern blotting analyses. The total RNA of both oviparous and ovoviviparous Artemia, the total RNA of both thoracic segments and ovisacs of oviparous Artemia, and the total RNA of oviparous ovisacs from days 1–5 were extracted. All of the samples (15 μg corresponding to each tissue) were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, then transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N; Amersham Biosciences) for overnight hybridization at 45 °C, washed twice at 55 °C, and finally detected by the DIG chemiluminescent detection system (Roche Applied Science). The DIG-labeled sense and antisense RNA probes, corresponding to nucleotides 80–432 of SGEG cDNA, were amplified (primed by CExpF and CExpR; Table 1) and cloned into plasmid vector pSPT18 at EcoRI and XbaI sites (the EcoRI site exists in the SGEG sequence). They were then transcribed in vitro from the EcoRI- and XbaI-linearized templates, respectively (according to the manufacturer's instruction of DIG RNA Labeling kit SP6/T7; Roche Applied Science). For tissue slice preparation, Artemia were anesthetized as mentioned previously, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and embedded in Tissue-TekTM (Sakura Finetechnical Co. Ltd). Then 10-μm-thick frozen sections were prepared by frozen ultramicrotome. Dry sections were fixed with paraformaldehyde, digested with proteinase K and hybridized at 42 °C overnight. Then these slices were washed at 52 °C and blocked by blocking solution (Roche Applied Science). They were then treated with anti-DIG-AP conjugate (Roche Applied Science; 1:500) and visualized with the colorimetric substrates nitroblue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Finally, the photographs were taken on an inverted microscope (ECLIPSE TE2000-S; Nikon). A SSH library was constructed, and the double-stranded cDNA from oviparous and ovoviviparous ovisacs of Artemia were used as tester and driver, respectively. Eighty-four clones were obtained from the SSH library enriched for the oviparous-specific transcripts. Twenty-two clones exhibiting distinct expression differences were selected for sequencing and obtaining of the complete cDNA sequence by RACE. A differentially expressed gene, which contained a 450-bp complete cDNA sequence, was the focus, and this was named the shell gland-specifically expressed gene (SGEG). The conceptually translated peptide from the gene consists of a 33-amino acid putative signal peptides and an 81-amino acid putative residue mature peptides (supplemental Fig. S2). It was considered to be a novel gene, having no apparent identity with other known genes or proteins when alignments were compared with sequences in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTM data base. RNA interference was performed by dsRNA microinjection into the Artemia at instar XII stage, and the SGEG transcript level was reduced to less than 20% (Fig. 1A). Although both the RNAi and control Artemia showed no significant abnormal phenotypes, the cysts, which were oviposited by RNAi-treated Artemia, stuck on bottom of the culture tank having a characteristically soft cyst shell in direct contrast to control cysts, which could be observed sinking, floating, and suspended in the same tank. For the RNAi-induced cysts, more than 20% were found to be able to develop into swimming nauplii by 72 h without any activation necessary. The control cysts remained unable to be hatched out directly without a procedure of diapause termination even in the presence of appropriate hatching conditions. The observations using the inverted microscope revealed that the shells of RNAi-induced cysts were transparent, whereas the control cysts remained opaque. Thus the embryo and blastopore inside could be observed clearly for the RNAi-induced cysts (Fig. 1B, panels a and a′). Moreover, in contrast to the control cyst shell, the RNAi-induced cyst shell had changed to light yellow when observed by anatomical microscopes (Fig. 1B, panels b and b′). Furthermore, the cortical layer and alveolar layer (chorion layer) of the RNAi-induced cyst shell was contorted and obviously lighter (more electron-transparent) than that of control cysts as shown in the transmission electron micrographs (Fig. 1C, panels a and a′). In addition, in the RNAi-induced cysts, the thin supra cortical layer had disappeared, the aeropyles in the cortical layer were blurry and syncretized, and the cortical layer of RNAi-induced cyst shell was less than half the thickness of the control cortical layer (Fig. 1C, panels b and b′). The scanning electron micrographs revealed that the shell surface of cysts reproduced by RNAi-treated Artemia was lamellar and rough (Fig. 1D, panel a), instead of the compact and smooth shell of the control cyst (normal cortical layer; Fig"

Recently the first crystal structure of a chicken ASIC was obtained. Expanding upon this work, homology models of the human ASICs were constructed and evaluated. Energy-minimized structures were tested for validity by in silico docking of the models to psalmotoxin-1, which potently inhibits ASIC-1 and not other members of the family. The data are consistent with prior radioligand binding and functional assays while also explaining the selectivity of PcTX-1 for homomeric hASIC-1a. Binding energy calculations suggest that the toxin and channel create a complex that is more stable than the channel alone. The binding is dominated by the coulombic contributions, which account for why the toxin-channel interaction is not observed at low pH. The computational data were experimentally verified with single channel and whole-cell electrophysiological studies. These validated models should allow for the rational design of specific and potent peptidomimetic compounds that may be useful for the treatment of pain or ischemic stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2066079289,"The cleavage of the autotransporter adhesin involved in diffuse adherence (AIDA-I) of Escherichia coli yields a membrane-embedded fragment, AIDAc, and an extracellular fragment, the mature AIDA-I adhesin. The latter remains noncovalently associated with AIDAc but can be released by heat treatment. In this study we determined the mechanism of AIDA-I cleavage. We showed that AIDA-I processing is an autocatalytic event by monitoring the in vitro cleavage of an uncleaved mutant protein isolated from inclusion bodies. Furthermore, by following changes in circular dichroism spectra and protease resistance of the renaturated protein, we showed that the cleavage of the protein is correlated with folding. With site-directed deletions, we showed that the catalytic activity of the protein lies in a region encompassing amino acids between Ala-667 and Thr-953, which includes the conserved junction domain of some autotransporters. With site-directed point mutations, we also found that Asp-878 and Glu-897 are involved in the processing of AIDA-I and that a mutation preserving the acidic side chain of Asp-878 was tolerated, giving evidence that this carboxylic acid group is directly involved in catalysis. Last, we confirmed that cleavage of AIDA-I is intramolecular. Our results unveil a new mechanism of auto-processing in the autotransporter family."

In the case of E. coli, repair begins when the RecBCD enzyme binds to a dsDNA end and unwinds the DNA using its ATP-dependent helicase activities (17Taylor A.F. Smith G.R. Nature. 2003; 423: 889-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 24Taylor A. Smith G.R. Cell. 1980; 22: 447-457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Single-stranded (ss) DNA produced during unwinding, with or without accompanying nuclease, is coated with RecA protein (16Anderson D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 25Churchill J.J. Anderson D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 901-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This recombinogenic substrate engages in strand exchange with a homologous intact duplex to form a joint molecule. Joint molecules are thought to be converted into intact, recombinant DNA either by replication or by cutting and ligation of exchanged strands (26Smith G.R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 243-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although the AddAB and RecBCD enzymes appear to play similar roles in promoting recombination and DNA repair, they differ in several ways. RecBCD is a heterotrimer, composed of one copy of the RecB, RecC, and RecD gene products (27Taylor A.F. Smith G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24451-24458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), whereas AddAB has two subunits, encoded by the addA and addB genes (21Kooistra J. Venema G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3644-3655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kooistra J. Vosman B. Venema G. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4791-4797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme subunit(s) responsible for helicase activity can be inferred from the presence of conserved protein domains or the activity of purified proteins. AddA, RecB, and RecD are superfamily I helicases with six highly conserved helicase motifs, including the conserved Walker A box found in many enzymes that bind ATP (29Walker J.E. Saraste M.

RecBCD enzymes in which the conserved Lys in this motif is changed to Gln have a reduced affinity for ATP binding (33Chen H.W. Ruan B. Yu M. Wang J. Julin D.A. J. Biol.

A nuclease domain with the conserved amino acid sequence LDYK is found in RecB, AddA, AddB, and many other nucleases (38Aravind L. Makarova K.S. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3417-3432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The conserved Asp plays a role in Mg2+ binding at the active site; Mg2+ is required for nuclease activity (39Yu M. Souaya J. Julin D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 797-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The recB1080 mutation, which changes codon 1080 from the conserved Asp in this motif to Ala, eliminates nuclease activity (39Yu M. Souaya J. Julin D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 797-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that addA and addB deletion mutants are hypersensitive to DNA-damaging agents and impaired in colonization of the mouse stomach compared with wild-type strains (8Amundsen S.K. Fero J. Hansen L.M. Cromie G.A. Solnick J.V. Smith G.R. Salama N.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 994-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To determine the roles of the individual helicase and nuclease activities of H. pylori AddAB in DNA repair and infectivity, we used site-directed mutagenesis to inactivate the conserved nuclease domains of addA and addB and the conserved ATPase (helicase) domain of AddA. Here, we report that loss of the AddAB helicase is sufficient to impair H. pylori DNA repair and infectivity and, when the genes are expressed in E. coli, homologous recombination. AddAB retains partial activity in biochemical and genetic assays when either of the two nuclease domains is inactivated but loses all detectable nuclease activity when both domains are inactivated. Remarkably, H. pylori AddAB can produce recombinants in E. coli only in the presence of H. pylori RecA, suggesting a species-specific interaction in which AddAB facilitates the production of ssDNA-coated with RecA protein. Our results show that both the helicase and nuclease activities are required for the biological roles of H. pylori AddAB. E. coli and H. pylori strains with their genotypes are listed in Table S1. Plasmids are listed in Table S2. Allele numbers and designations for polypeptides with nuclease (NUC) or helicase (HEL) mutations are indicated as superscripts for clarity. E. coli strains were constructed by CaCl2-mediated transformation; fresh transformants were made prior to each experiment. H. pylori strains were constructed by natural transformation. E. coli and H. pylori strains were cultured as described by Amundsen et al. (8Amundsen S.K. Fero J. Hansen L.M. Cromie G.A. Solnick J.V. Smith G.R. Salama N.R. Mol.

Mutations in the nuclease (addANUC and addBNUC) and helicase motifs (addAHEL) were introduced into pSA405 (pDuet-1 with addA and addB (8Amundsen S.K. Fero J. Hansen L.M. Cromie G.A. Solnick J.V.

Oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies) carrying the desired mutations are listed in Table S3. Plasmids with the targeted mutations were identified by sequencing and introduced into E. coli strain V3060. Helicase and nuclease motif mutant alleles were introduced into H. pylori at the rdxA locus by natural transformation (40Wang Y. Roos K.P. Taylor D.E.

In all cases expression was driven from the endogenous promoter of the rdxA locus. Recombination proficiency was measured in crosses as described previously (42Schultz D.W. Taylor A.F. Smith G.R. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 664-680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using E. coli Hfr donor strain V1306 (his+rpsL+; PO44) and F− recipients (hisG4 rpsL31) carrying plasmids expressing E. coli recBCD, H. pylori addAB, H. pylori recA, or combinations of these and lacking E. coli chromosomal recA or recBCD null alleles. Selection was for His+StrR. Cell-free extracts were prepared and assayed for helicase and nuclease activities as described (8Amundsen S.K. Fero J. Hansen L.M. Cromie G.A. Solnick J.V. Smith G.R. Salama N.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 994-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For H. pylori, ∼3 × 107 bacteria were inoculated on horse blood plates. For E. coli, ∼1 × 107 bacteria were inoculated on LB agar plates. A single E-test strip (AB Biodisk) was placed in the center of each plate, and plates were incubated at 37 °C for 2–4 days (H. pylori) or 1 day (E. coli). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined according to the manufacturer's instructions. Female C57BL/6 mice 24–28 days old were obtained from Charles River Laboratories and certified free of endogenous Helicobacter infection by the vendor. The mice were housed in sterilized microisolator cages with irradiated PMI 5053 rodent chow and autoclaved corncob bedding, and acidified reverse osmosis-purified water was provided ad libitum. All studies were done under the practices and procedures of Animal Biosafety Level 2. The facility is fully accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International, and all activities were approved by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Groups of five mice were infected with H. pylori via oral gavage. After 1 week bacteria were recovered, and a competitive index was calculated as described (8Amundsen S.K. Fero J. Hansen L.M.

To assess the role of the nuclease and helicase activities of AddAB in DNA repair, recombination, and infectivity, we genetically inactivated one or another function. Nuclease and helicase domains were identified by comparing the amino acid sequences of H. pylori AddA and AddB with known motifs in E. coli RecB and RecD and in B. subtilis AddA and AddB (8Amundsen S.K.

To inactivate the putative AddA helicase, we targeted the Walker A box responsible for ATP binding by changing codon 18 from Lys to Gln (K18Q), here designated AddAHEL. The nuclease domains of AddA and AddB were identified by the conserved RecB nuclease motif LDYK. To inactivate the nuclease domain, we changed the Asp in this motif to Ala in addA (D897A) or in addB (D667A), here designated AddANUC or AddBNUC, respectively. Mutations were introduced into the addAB genes carried on an E. coli expression vector. For analysis in H. pylori, mutant alleles were integrated and expressed at the rdxA locus, and the endogenous locus was deleted (8Amundsen S.K. Fero J. Hansen L.M. Cromie G.A. Solnick J.V. Smith G.R. Salama N.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 994-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 41Smeets L.C. Bijlsma J.J. Boomkens S.Y. Vandenbroucke-Grauls C.M. Kusters J.G. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3948-3954Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We assayed nuclease activity, as acid-soluble products of radioactive DNA, in extracts of E. coli cells with a chromosomal recBCD deletion (ΔrecBCD) bearing a plasmid encoding the wild-type or mutant addAB alleles. Extracts from cells without AddAB (vector control), AddAHELB, and the AddANUCBNUC extract had very little ATP-dependent nuclease activity, indicating that inactivating both nuclease domains or the single helicase domain eliminates detectable exonuclease activity (Table 1). The AddAHELB enzyme likely fails to degrade DNA because, as for the RecBCD enzyme, the exonuclease acts almost exclusively during DNA unwinding (45Eichler D.C. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 499-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Goldmark P.J. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1849-1860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Karu A.E. Linn S.

In contrast, inactivating the single nuclease motif in addA or in addB reduced the nuclease activity to about half that of the wild type (Table 1). This suggests that the individual nuclease domains of AddA and AddB can act independently during DNA unwinding.TABLE 1Mutations in either the nuclease or helicase domain of AddAB reduce or eliminate exonuclease activity in cells and in cell-free extractsAddAB plasmidaPlasmids are derivatives of pETDuet-1 encoding the indicated AddAB subunits.Codon changeATP-dependent ds DNA exonuclease activitybUnits/mg extract protein (46).

Open table in a new tab We next measured the nuclease activity of mutant and wild-type AddAB enzymes in intact cells. In E. coli, the nuclease activity of RecBCD enzyme degrades the DNA of phage T4 lacking the protective gene 2 protein; this restriction greatly reduces the efficiency of plating (EOP) of phage T4 gene 2 mutants (50Oliver D.B. Goldberg E.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 51Lipinska B. Rao A.S. Bolten B.M. Balakrishnan R. Goldberg E.B. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 488-497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In E. coli ΔrecBCD cells, expression of AddAB or AddANUCB or AddABNUC reduced the EOP to about 10−5 of that with the vector control (Table 1). The EOP was ∼1 on cells with addAHEL or addANUCBNUC, indicating that phage plating was not restricted in these cells, consistent with the absence of nuclease activity in assays of the corresponding extracts (Table 1). The strong reduction of EOP on addANUCB or addABNUC cells indicates that each of the two nuclease domains has significant nuclease activity, as observed in cell-free extracts (Table 1). Thus, both the intracellular and cell-free extract results suggest that the single nuclease domains can act independently but are dependent on the helicase for detectable nuclease activity. The AddAB and RecBCD enzymes unwind linear dsDNA in an ATP-dependent reaction. We measured helicase activity under reaction conditions that minimize nuclease activity, with excess ATP relative to Mg2+ (45Eichler D.C. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 499-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell-free extracts were reacted briefly (2 min) with the 32P end-labeled substrate, and the products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. Extracts containing AddAB, AddANUCB, AddABNUC, or AddANUCBNUC unwound dsDNA, producing similar amounts of ssDNA products (Fig. 1). As expected, mutation of one or both of the nuclease motifs had no apparent effect on the helicase activity. In contrast, inactivation of the AddA ATP-binding domain (AddAHELB) abolished helicase activity, and no ssDNA was detected even with more than 10 times the amount of extract protein that gave detectable unwinding with the other strains (Fig. 1). Collectively, the experiments described above demonstrate that site-directed mutations in the nuclease and helicase domains of AddA or AddB altered the expected target activities (Table 1 and Fig. 1). We next determined how loss of these activities affected DNA repair, recombination, and infectivity. AddAB plays a central role in DNA repair, and addAB null mutants are sensitive to DNA-damaging agents (8Amundsen S.K. Fero J. Hansen L.M. Cromie G.A. Solnick J.V. Smith G.R. Salama N.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 994-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 32Kooistra J. Haijema B.J. Hesseling-Meinders A. Venema G. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 137-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We wished to determine in H. pylori whether inactivation of the helicase domain or one or both of the nuclease domains of AddAB increased the sensitivity of cells to the DNA gyrase inhibitor ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin induces ds breaks in the DNA, a target for AddAB-mediated repair (52Sioud M. Forterre P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3638-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 53Wolfson J.S. Hooper D.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1985; 28: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 54Iyer V.N. Szybalski W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1963; 50: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). H. pylori strains with chromosomal addA or addB deletions had a lower MIC of ciprofloxacin than the wild type (Fig. 2). To compare the phenotype of wild type and nuclease or helicase mutants, addA or addB alleles (wild type or mutant) were inserted into the chromosomal rdx locus, at which inserted genes are often overexpressed compared with the normal chromosomal location (8Amundsen S.K. Fero J. Hansen L.M. Cromie G.A. Solnick J.V. Smith G.R. Salama N.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 994-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 43Haijema B.J. Venema G. Kooistra J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5086-5091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). H. pylori strains with a mutation in the helicase motif (addAHEL) or the nuclease motif of either addA or addB (addANUC or addBNUC) had a lower MIC of ciprofloxacin than wild-type addAB at rdx (Fig. 2). These data suggest that AddAB helicase and nuclease are required for repair of ciprofloxacin-induced damage. DNA damage induced by ciprofloxacin is thought to be repaired by homologous recombination between the damaged DNA and an intact duplex. Recombination proficiency can be measured quantitatively in E. coli following conjugation with an Hfr strain, which introduces broken DNA into the recipient cells. Because both AddAB and RecBCD have helicase and nuclease activities (Table 1 and Fig. 1), we tested the ability of wild-type and mutant AddAB to promote recombination in E. coli recipients lacking RecBCD, an enzyme essential for recombination in E. coli Hfr crosses (11Howard-Flanders P. Theriot L. Genetics. 1966; 53: 1137-1150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Willetts N.S. Clark A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 100: 231-239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Willetts N.S. Mount D.W. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 100: 923-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To measure conjugation, we expressed H. pylori AddAB from plasmids in E. coli hisG rpsL (His−StrR) strains with a chromosomal recBCD deletion. These strains were mated with an rpsL+ Hfr strain that transfers hisG+ early, and His+ [StrR] recombinants were selected (42Schultz D.W. Taylor A.F. Smith G.R. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 664-680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant frequency in the recB21 null mutant was reduced more than a thousand-fold compared with that in a recBCD+ strain (Table 2, compare crosses 1 and 2). Surprisingly, strains expressing wild-type AddAB were as recombination-deficient as recB21 (Table 2, cross 5). Strains e"

In the present studies, we have employed a novel mutagenesis-based approach to identify the macromolecular determinants that control H4 N-terminal domain (NTD) function during oligomerization. Core histones were engineered in which 1) the H2A, H2B, and H3 NTDs were swapped onto the H4 histone fold; 2) the length of the H4 NTD and the H2A NTD on the H4 histone fold, were increased; 3) the charge density of the NTDs on the H4 histone fold was increased or decreased; and 4) the H4 NTD was placed on the H2B histone fold. Model nucleosomal arrays were assembled from wild type and mutant core histone octamers, and Mg2+-dependent oligomerization was characterized. The results demonstrated that the H2B and H3 NTDs could replace the H4 NTD, as could the H2A NTD if it was duplicated to the length of the native H4 NTD. Arrays oligomerized at lower salt concentrations as the length of the NTD on the H4 histone fold was increased. Mutations that decreased the NTD charge density required more Mg2+ to oligomerize, whereas mutants that increased the charge density required less salt. Finally, the H4 NTD functioned differently when attached to the H2B histone fold than the H4 histone fold. These studies have revealed new insights into the biochemical basis for H4 NTD effects on genome architecture as well as the protein chemistry that underlies the function of the intrinsically disordered H4 NTD.

Chromatin fibers consist of linear polymers of nucleosomes, termed nucleosomal arrays, together with a specific complement of associated proteins, e.g. linker histones, chromatin architectural proteins, and transcription factors. Each nucleosome in the array contains 147 bp of DNA wrapped 1.75 times around a core histone octamer and is separated from its neighbor by 10–80 bp of linker DNA (1Felsenfeld G. Groudine M. Nature. 2003; 421: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). The histone octamer is composed of two each of the four core histones, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. The α-helical histone fold portions of the core histones constrain the superhelical turns of the nucleosomal DNA, largely through hydrogen bonding between the proteins and DNA (2Luger K. Richmond T.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Unlike the structured histone fold domains, the highly basic core histone N-terminal “tail” domains (NTDs) 2The abbreviations used are: NTDN-terminal domainWTwild typeTLtail-lesssaveaverage sedimentation coefficientCDcharge density. are found on the outside of the nucleosome (3Luger K.

Extended 10-nm diameter beads-on-a-string arrays are locally compacted into 30-nm diameter fibers, which are subsequently coiled further to form extensively condensed, large scale “chromonema” fibers that are ∼130 nm in diameter (7Belmont A.S.

Folding is induced by low levels of monovalent or divalent cations, which screen linker DNA charge (18Clark D.J. Kimura T. J. Mol.

Oligomerization occurs at slightly higher concentrations of divalent cations than those that induce folding (10Hansen J.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5622-5633Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Oligomerization produces supramolecular assemblies with sedimentation coefficients >100 S that dissociate into beads-on-a-string nucleosomal arrays when the divalent cations are removed from the buffer, indicating that both the oligomerization and folding transitions are freely reversible (19Schwarz P.M. Felthauser A. Fletcher T.M. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4009-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Considerable evidence indicates that divalent cation-dependent oligomerization of short nucleosomal array fragments is an in vitro manifestation of the long range fiber-fiber interactions that help stabilize chromosomal structures beyond the 30-nm fiber. Early studies examined the effects of salts on chromosomal morphology in intact isolated rat liver nuclei (24Olins D.E. Olins A.L. J. Cell Biol. 1972; 53: 715-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Dense, granular chromatin (heterochromatin) was present when the nuclei were isolated in buffers containing >2 mm Mg2+. However, washing the nuclei in buffer lacking divalent cations led to rapid nuclear swelling and spectral changes indicative of chromosome decondensation. Returning the nuclei to buffer containing 2 mm MgCl2 led to reformation of the dense granules, indicating that the Mg2+-dependent chromosomal transition(s) were reversible. Similar results subsequently were obtained by other investigators (25Aaronson R.P. Woo E. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 90: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 26Weith A. Exp. Cell Res. 1983; 146: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 27Dixon D.K. Burkholder G.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 36: 315-322PubMed Google Scholar). When interphase chromosomes were isolated in buffers containing polyamines and divalent cations, highly condensed 130-nm diameter chromonema fibers were observed by electron microscopy. However, when isolated in buffers lacking polyamines and divalent cations, no condensed structures were observed beyond the 30-nm fiber (7Belmont A.S. Braunfeld M.B. Sedat J.W. Agard D.A. Chromosoma. 1989; 98: 129-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Taken together, these early seminal studies established that divalent cations or polyamines are required to maintain extensively condensed chromosomal structures and strongly argue that there is a close relationship between model system oligomerization in vitro and higher order chromatin fiber folding beyond the 30-nm fiber. The core histone NTDs provide major macromolecular conduits through which the structure and function of the chromatin fiber is regulated (10Hansen J.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 361-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 28Taverna S.D. Li H. Ruthenburg A.J. Allis C.D. Patel D.J. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Such intrinsically disordered domains lack a native secondary structure, yet are able to participate in specific macromolecular interactions, often with multiple partners (6Hansen J.C. Lu X.

The core histone NTDs are essential mediators of chromatin condensation (10Hansen J.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 361-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Without the NTDs, nucleosomal arrays (11Dorigo B. Schalch T. Bystricky K. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 38Garcia-Ramirez M. Dong F. Ausio J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 37285-37290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) do not condense beyond the 10-nm diameter beads-on-a-string structure in the presence of ionic conditions that induce folding and oligomerization of native nucleosomal arrays. The histone H4 NTD contributes the primary role in the folding transition (11Dorigo B. Schalch T. Bystricky K. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). In contrast, oligomerization is mediated through the independent action of all four core histone NTDs (41Gordon F. Luger K. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33701-33706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The biochemical mechanisms that dictate NTD function during nucleosomal array oligomerization are poorly understood. Because of their high positive charge density, the NTDs have been proposed to bind to DNA and subsequently neutralize backbone charge (42Arya G. Zhang Q. Schlick T. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 133-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 43Sharma S. Ding F. Dokholyan N.V. Biophys. J. 2007; 92: 1457-1470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of the H3 and H4 NTDs to DNA has been observed recently, concomitant with Mg2+-dependent oligomerization (21Kan P.Y. Lu X. Hansen J.C. Hayes J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2084-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 22Wang X. Hayes J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 44Kan P.Y. Caterino T.L. Hayes J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, other evidence suggests that a DNA charge neutralization-based mechanism is too simple. For example, the H3 and H4 NTDs alone can mediate oligomerization, but the H2A and H2B NTDs cannot (41Gordon F. Luger K. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33701-33706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), even though all four NTDs have essentially the same charge density. Acetylation of Lys-16 on the H4 NTD and neutralization of a single positive charge have the same effect on oligomerization as removal of the entire H4 NTD with nine positive charges (45Shogren-Knaak M. Ishii H. Sun J.M. Pazin M.J. Davie J.R. Peterson C.L. Science. 2006; 311: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar). Consequently, a direct study of the determinants of NTD function during oligomerization was warranted. When selectively removed from nucleosomal arrays, the H4 NTD has the largest effect on oligomerization (11Dorigo B. Schalch T. Bystricky K. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 41Gordon F. Luger K. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33701-33706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Arrays lacking the H4 NTD still oligomerize (due to the action of the other NTDs) but require higher amounts of Mg2+ than the wild type to achieve half-maximal oligomerization. In the present work, we have performed a novel mutagenesis-based analysis of H4 NTD function. Four possible determinants were examined: primary sequence, NTD length, charge density, and the histone fold attachment site. Novel H4 proteins were constructed in which the NTDs of the other three core histones were swapped into the H4 histone fold; the H4 and H2A NTD were tandemly repeated to increase the length of the NTD; the positive charge density was altered via site-directed mutagenesis; and the H4 NTD was attached to the H2B histone fold. Our results indicate that although the primary sequence appears inconsequential, the H4 NTD length, charge density, and histone fold attachment site all are all important determinants of the function of the H4 NTD during Mg2+-dependent oligomerization. Amino acid composition also appears to contribute to NTD function. These results significantly advance our understanding of both the biochemical mechanism of stabilization of chromosome structure beyond the 30-nm fiber and the unique protein chemistry that enables H4 NTD function during chromatin condensation. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using the cDNA encoding the Xenopus laevis core histones (cloned into pET3A (Novagen)) as templates (46Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Flaus A.J. Waye M.M. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 47Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Richmond T.J. Methods Mol.

PCR primers were designed to amplify fragments from these templates and included specific restriction sites. For tail swap mutants, amplified NTD fragments were flanked by Nde-1 at the 5′ end and one of the following sites at the 3′ end: Nae-1, Nhe-1, and Stu-1. Amplified histone fold fragments were flanked by 5′ restriction sites complementary to those at the 3′ end of the prospective NTD fragment and with BamH1 sites at the 3′ ends. The restriction enzymes used at the union of the NTD and histone-fold fragments were chosen such that the composition of the amino acids at the union was maintained closely to the parent histone amino acids. For example, the Nae-1 site (5′-GCCGGC-3′) codes for alanine and glycine; both are among the amino acids commonly found in the H2A and H4 NTDs (see Table 1). Tandemly repeated (doubled and tripled) H2A NTDs cloned onto the H4 histone-fold domain were generated in steps by repeatedly cloning an additional H2A NTD upstream of the T2AHF4 clone 3The nomenclature used for the mutant chimeric histones and nucleosomal arrays is as follows. The specific N-terminal tail domain will be preceded by the superscript “T,” and the “histone fold” portion will be preceded by the superscript “HF.” Thus, the NTD of H2A cloned on the histone fold of H4 is written as T2AHF4, whereas two H2A NTDs fused to the H4 histone fold are written as T[2A]2HF4. using PCR methods similar to those described above.

The fragments were ligated into appropriately digested pET3a (or previously cloned histone chimeras; see above) and transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α. Clones were screened by the appearance of a band of the appropriate length following digestion with Nde-1 and BamH-1 and agarose electrophoresis. The fidelity of the clones was confirmed by sequencing (Macromolecular Resource Facility, Colorado State University). BL21(DE3)pLysS cells were transformed with the pET plasmids, and the core histones were expressed and purified as described previously (41Gordon F. Luger K. Hansen J.C. J. Biol.

Consequently, in the present work, we have investigated the macromolecular determinants through which the H4 NTD mediates the nucleosome-nucleosome interactions involved in salt-dependent nucleosomal array oligomerization. To accomplish this, we engineered recombinant X. laevis core histone H4 proteins with novel NTDs (Fig. 1). These mutant histones were then expressed and purified from E. coli and assembled onto 12-mer 5 S ribosomal DNA templates to yield the model nucleosomal arrays used in the oligomerization studies. Importantly, because each core histone NTD functions independently during oligomerization (41Gordon F. Luger K. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33701-33706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), our experiments only assay the effects of the mutations on the action of the H4 NTD. The number of octamers assembled on a 12-mer 5 S ribosomal DNA template will influence the MgCl2-dependent oligomerization curve and the Mg50. Specifically, the magnitude of the Mg50 increases as the number of nucleosomes on the template decreases (19Schwarz P.M. Felthauser A. Fletcher T.M. Hansen J.C.

https://openalex.org/W1984954340,"The reversible unfolding of metallo-beta-lactamase from Chryseobacterium meningosepticum (BlaB) by guanidinium hydrochloride is best described by a three-state model including folded, intermediate, and unfolded states. The transformation of the folded apoenzyme into the intermediate state requires only very low denaturant concentrations, in contrast to the Zn2-enzyme. Similarly, circular dichroism spectra of both BlaB and metallo-beta-lactamase from Bacillus cereus 569/H/9 (BcII) display distinct differences between metal-free and Zn2-enzymes, indicating that the zinc ions affect the folding of the proteins, giving a larger alpha-helix content. To identify the regions of the protein involved in this zinc ion-induced change, a hydrogen deuterium exchange study with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization tandem time of flight mass spectrometry on metal-free and Zn1- and Zn2-BcII was carried out. The region spanning the metal binding metallo-beta-lactamases (MBL) superfamily consensus sequence His-X-His-X-Asp motif and the loop connecting the N- and C-terminal domains of the protein undergoes a zinc ion-dependent structural change between intrinsically disordered and ordered states. The inherent flexibility even appears to allow for the formation of metal ion-bridged protein-protein complexes which may account for both electrospray ionization-mass spectroscopy results obtained upon variation of the zinc/protein ratio and stoichiometry-dependent variations of 199mHg-perturbed angular correlation of gamma-rays spectroscopic data. We suggest that this flexible ""zinc arm"" motif, present in all the MBL subclasses, is disordered in metal-free MBLs and may be involved in metal ion acquisition from zinc-carrying molecules different from MBL in an ""activation on demand"" regulation of enzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W2035194595,"Background Proteolysis, involved in many processes in living organisms, is tightly regulated in space and time under physiological conditions. However deregulation can occur with local persistent proteolytic activities, e.g. in inflammation, cystic fibrosis, tumors, or pancreatitis. Furthermore, little is known about the role of many proteases, hence there is a need of new imaging methods to visualize specifically normal or disease-related proteolysis in intact bodies. Methodology/Principal Findings In this paper, a new concept for non invasive proteolysis imaging is proposed. Overhauser-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (OMRI) at 0.2 Tesla was used to monitor the enzymatic hydrolysis of a nitroxide-labeled protein. In vitro, image intensity switched from 1 to 25 upon proteolysis due to the associated decrease in the motional correlation time of the substrate. The OMRI experimental device used in this study is consistent with protease imaging in mice at 0.2 T without significant heating. Simulations show that this enzymatic-driven OMRI signal switch can be obtained at lower frequencies suitable for larger animals or humans. Conclusions/Significance The method is highly sensitive and makes possible proteolysis imaging in three dimensions with a good spatial resolution. Any protease could be targeted specifically through the use of taylor-made cleavable macromolecules. At short term OMRI of proteolysis may be applied to basic research as well as to evaluate therapeutic treatments in small animal models of experimental diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2115264660,"Compartmentalization within eukaryotic cells hinders the efficient delivery of therapeutic agents to the cell nucleus. Here we describe novel multifunctional DNA carriers (MDCs) that self-assemble with DNA to form structured nanoparticles that possess virus-like functions for cellular trafficking. MDCs contain, in fusion, the DNA-compacting sperm chromatin component protamine, alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone for cell-targeted internalization, the endosome-translocation domain of diphtheria toxin, and an optimized nuclear localization sequence to confer recognition by the nuclear import machinery. The structure of the MDC-DNA particles was examined using atomic force microscopy, and the functionality of each domain assessed using in vitro techniques, including a reconstituted nuclear transport assay in semi-intact cells relying on the use of quantitative confocal laser scanning microscopy. The nanoparticles were internalized in cell-specific fashion and subsequently exited the endosome into the cytoplasm. Notably, the nanoparticles interact with cellular nuclear transport proteins as shown in direct binding assays and are actively trafficked into the cell nucleus of nondividing cells, resulting in 3- to 4-fold higher reporter gene expression in growth-arrested human embryonic kidney cells, as well as lower cytotoxicity, than lipid and polyethyleneimine vectors. The importance of each functional domain was examined by comparing MDCs with different domain compositions as controls, as well as using antibodies to block particular pathways. MDCs that utilize cellular signaling pathways have enormous potential to safely and efficiently deliver therapeutic transgenes into the nucleus of nondividing cells."
https://openalex.org/W2020350739,"Background Several abiotic processes leading to the formation of life-like signatures or later contamination with actual biogenic traces can blur the interpretation of the earliest fossil record. In recent years, a large body of evidence showing the occurrence of diverse and active microbial communities in the terrestrial subsurface has accumulated. Considering the time elapsed since Archaean sedimentation, the contribution of subsurface microbial communities postdating the rock formation to the fossil biomarker pool and other biogenic remains in Archaean rocks may be far from negligible. Methodology/Principal Findings In order to evaluate the degree of potential contamination of Archean rocks by modern microorganisms, we looked for the presence of living indigenous bacteria in fresh diamond drillcores through 2,724 Myr-old stromatolites (Tumbiana Formation, Fortescue Group, Western Australia) using molecular methods based on the amplification of small subunit ribosomal RNA genes (SSU rDNAs). We analyzed drillcore samples from 4.3 m and 66.2 m depth, showing signs of meteoritic alteration, and also from deeper “fresh” samples showing no apparent evidence for late stage alteration (68 m, 78.8 m, and 99.3 m). We also analyzed control samples from drilling and sawing fluids and a series of laboratory controls to establish a list of potential contaminants introduced during sample manipulation and PCR experiments. We identified in this way the presence of indigenous bacteria belonging to Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammaproteobacteria in aseptically-sawed inner parts of drillcores down to at least 78.8 m depth. Conclusions/Significance The presence of modern bacterial communities in subsurface fossil stromatolite layers opens the possibility that a continuous microbial colonization had existed in the past and contributed to the accumulation of biogenic traces over geological timescales. This finding casts shadow on bulk analyses of early life remains and makes claims for morphological, chemical, isotopic, and biomarker traces syngenetic with the rock unreliable in the absence of detailed contextual analyses at microscale."
https://openalex.org/W2118282477,"Using a noninvasive, solid-state magicangle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) approach, we track ex vivo the behavior of individual membrane components in isolated, active mitochondria (model system: potato tubers) during physiological processes. The individual phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and cardiolipin (CL) membrane constituents were identified as distinct lines by applying MAS 31P NMR on extracted lipid membranes. However, the CL NMR signal appeared to be very broad in functional mitochondria, indicating a tight complex formation with membrane protein. Calcium stress induced severe membrane degradation without recovery of a single CL NMR resonance. This suggests that calcium overload destroys the outer mitochondrial membrane and does not modify strongly the CL protein complexes in the inner membrane; a conclusion confirmed by respiratory controls. Conversely, mitochondrial membrane disruption on time degradation or mechanical stress generates clearly visible identical CL NMR signals, similar to those observed in rehydrated lipid extracts. Similarly, noninvasive based NMR tracking of lipids in response to diverse physiological stimuli can easily be used for other organelles and whole living cells.

The ability to undergo neoangiogenesis, as measured in a window-chamber model, was also inhibited by 70%. Screening of biochemical pathways revealed that analog II inhibited the enzyme ENOX1 (EC(50) = 10 microM). Retroviral-mediated shRNA suppression of endothelial ENOX1 expression inhibited cell migration and tubule formation, recapitulating the effects observed with the small-molecule analogs. Genetic or chemical suppression of ENOX1 significantly increased radiation-mediated Caspase3-activated apoptosis, coincident with suppression of p70S6K1 phosphorylation. Administration of analog II prior to fractionated X-irradiation significantly diminished the number and density of tumor microvessels, as well as delayed syngeneic and xenograft tumor growth compared to results obtained with radiation alone. Analysis of necropsies suggests that the analog was well tolerated. These results suggest that targeting ENOX1 activity represents a novel therapeutic strategy for enhancing the radiation response of tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2062344827,"Multipassage experiments are performed by subcutaneous implantation in lab animals (usually mice) of a small number of cells from selected human lines. Tumor cells are then passaged from one mouse to another by harvesting them from a growing tumor and implanting them into other healthy animals. This procedure may be extremely useful to investigate the various mechanisms involved in the long term evolution of tumoral growth. It has been observed by several researchers that, contrary to what happens in in vitro experiments, there is a significant growth acceleration at each new passage. This result is explained by a new method of analysis, based on the Phenomenological Universalities approach. It is found that, by means of a simple rescaling of time, it is possible to collapse all the growth curves, corresponding to the successive passages, into a single curve, belonging to the Universality Class U2. Possible applications are proposed and the need of further experimental evidence is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1973978594,"The asymmetric distribution of human spatial attention has been repeatedly documented in both patients and healthy controls. Biases in the distribution of attention and/or in the mental representation of space may also affect some aspects of language processing. We investigated whether biases in attention and/or mental representation of space affect semantic representations. In particular, we investigated whether semantic judgments could be modulated by the location in space where the semantic information was presented and the role of the left and right parietal cortices in this task. Healthy subjects were presented with three pictures arranged horizontally (one middle and two outer pictures) of items belonging to the same semantic category. Subjects were asked to indicate the spatial position in which the semantic distance between the outer and middle pictures was smaller. Subjects systematically overestimated the semantic distance of items presented in the right side of space. We explored the neural correlates underpinning this bias using rTMS over the left and right parietal cortex. rTMS of the left parietal cortex selectively reduced this rightward bias. Our findings suggest the existence of an attentional and/or mental representational bias in semantic judgments, similar to that observed for the processing of space and numbers. Spatial manipulation of semantic material results in the activation of specialised attentional resources located in the left hemisphere."

https://openalex.org/W2151595306,"A population of glial cells in the central nervous system of the gastropod mollusk Lymnaea stagnalis produces a soluble protein that specifically binds acetylcholine. This protein is named the acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP). Experiments performed in vitro indicated that AChBP inactivates released acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses. On the basis of these observations, a similar in vivo role for AChBP was hypothesized. To fulfill this function, AChBP-expressing glia ought to be located in close proximity to cholinergic synapses in vivo. To examine this, we have analyzed the cellular and subcellular expression of AChBP in the intact CNS. Using a variety of molecular techniques, we demonstrate here that AChBP expression is confined to a subpopulation of glial cells located within the peripheral zone of each of the ganglia constituting the CNS. This zone contains the cell bodies of neurons, but few synapses. Conversely, glial cells that do not express the AChBP are predominantly located in the synapse-rich central neuropile zone but are rare in the cell body zone. Thus, our findings are not compatible with the previous conclusions drawn from in vitro studies and suggest that AChBP functions in vivo as a regulator of nonsynaptic cholinergic transmission."
