https://openalex.org/W2033861867,"SATB1 (special AT-rich sequence binding protein 1) organizes cell type–specific nuclear architecture by anchoring specialized DNA sequences and recruiting chromatin remodeling factors to control gene transcription. We studied the role of SATB1 in regulating the coordinated expression of Il5, Il4 and Il13, located in the 200-kb T-helper 2 (TH2) cytokine locus on mouse chromosome 11. We show that on TH2 cell activation, SATB1 expression is rapidly induced to form a unique transcriptionally active chromatin structure at the cytokine locus. In this structure, chromatin is folded into numerous small loops, all anchored to SATB1 at their base. In addition, histone H3 is acetylated at Lys9 and Lys14, and the TH2-specific factors GATA3, STAT6 and c-Maf, the chromatin-remodeling enzyme Brg1 and RNA polymerase II are all bound across the 200-kb region. Before activation, the TH2 cytokine locus is already associated with GATA3 and STAT6, showing some looping, but these are insufficient to induce cytokine gene expression. Using RNA interference, we show that on cell activation, SATB1 is required not only for compacting chromatin into dense loops at the 200-kb cytokine locus but also for inducing Il4, Il5, Il13 and c-Maf expression. Thus, SATB1 is a necessary determinant for the hitherto unidentified higher-order, transcriptionally active chromatin structure that forms on TH2 cell activation."

In addition, recognition of the apoptotic cells is actively anti-inflammatory and anti-immunogenic with generation of anti-inflammatory mediators such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids. Here, we have investigated the role played by the induction of TGF-β in the coordinate expression of anti-inflammatory eicosanoids or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ and in the suppression of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators and nitric oxide (NO). By use of a dominant negative TGFβII receptor, TGF-β signaling was blocked, and its participation in the consequences of apoptotic cell stimulation was determined. The induction of TGF-β itself could be attributed to exposed phosphatidylserine on the apoptotic cells, which therefore appears to drive the balanced inflammatory mediator responses. Arachidonic acid release, COX-2, and prostaglandin synthase expression were shown to be significantly dependent on the TGF-β production. On the other hand, a requirement for TGF-β was also shown in the inhibition of thromboxane synthase and thromboxanes, of 5-lipoxygenase and sulfidopeptide leukotrienes, as well as of inducible nitric-oxide synthase and NO. TGF-β-dependent induction of arginase was also found and would further limit the NO generation. Finally, apoptotic cells stimulated production of 15-lipoxygenase and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, a potentially anti-inflammatory pathway acting through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, and lipoxin A4 production, which were also up-regulated by a TGF-β-dependent pathway in this system. These results strongly suggest that the apoptotic cell inhibition of pro-inflammatory mediator production is pleiotropic and significantly dependent on the stimulation of TGF-β production.

Recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells by phagocytes play pivotal roles in development, maintenance of tissue homeostasis, control of the immune response, and resolution of inflammation (1Fadok V.A.

Apoptotic cells are removed by professional phagocytes, members of the mononuclear phagocyte system such as macrophages and immature dendritic cells, or by nonprofessional phagocytes such as fibroblasts, endothelial, epithelial, smooth muscle, or stromal cells (3Henson P.M. Hume D.A. Trends Immunol. 2006; 27: 244-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Uptake of the apoptotic cell is by a specialized and highly conserved form of phagocytosis termed efferocytosis (4DeCathelineau A.M. Henson P.M.

As a cell becomes apoptotic, it is generally removed in situ by near-neighbor cells or macrophages in a quiet, almost invisible fashion, i.e. the process does not induce a local tissue reaction. In fact, recognition and removal of apoptotic cells are normally both anti-inflammatory and anti-immunogenic (6Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Konowal A. Freed P.W. Westcott J.Y. Henson P.M. J. Clin.

On the other hand, there is considerable evidence to implicate PS as the main stimulus for the anti-inflammatory or anti-immunogenic effects (6Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Konowal A. Freed P.W.

Immunol. 1999; 163: 6164-6172PubMed Google Scholar). We suspect that these two stimuli, acting through different signaling pathways, are balanced, with a normal bias toward the anti-inflammatory. Unfortunately, the receptor(s) that recognizes PS (PS recognition structures, PSRS) that is responsible for this effect is unknown, although it does seem to distinguish between stereoisomeric forms of the phosphoserine head group (10Fadok V.A.

Pearson A. Ezekewitz R.A. Henson P.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar) whose binding is blocked by PS. The antibody binds to and activates cells and mimics exactly the effects of PS on apoptotic cells in contributing to uptake and on the generation of anti-inflammatory mediators (7Hoffmann P.R. Kench J.A. Vondracek A. Kruk E. Daleke D.L. Jordan M. Marrack P. Henson P.M. Fadok V.A. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1393-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 18Hoffmann P.R. deCathelineau A.M.

Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 649-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and it has been used here along with apoptotic cells to stimulate macrophages for production or suppression of eicosanoids.A major anti-inflammatory mediator induced in response to apoptotic cells, mAb217, or PS liposomes is TGF-β (6Fadok V.A.

Blockade of TGF-β has been shown to reverse the suppressive effects of apoptotic cells or PS in vivo on either inflammation or adaptive immunity (7Hoffmann P.R. Kench J.A. Vondracek A. Kruk E.

Investig. 2002; 109: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). On the other hand, earlier studies also suggested induction of other candidates such as IL-10 (19Voll R.E. Herrmann M. Roth E.A. Stach C. Kalden J.R. Girkontaite I. Nature. 1997; 390: 350-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar), PGE2 (6Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Konowal A. Freed P.W. Westcott J.Y. Henson P.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 890-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (2537) Google Scholar), and even platelet-activating factor (6Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Konowal A. Freed P.W. Westcott J.Y. Henson P.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 890-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (2537) Google Scholar), although the last two can have both pro- or anti-inflammatory effects. The ability of apoptotic cell recognition to alter the production of eicosanoids had first been noted for thromboxane (20Meagher L.C. Savill J.S. Baker A. Fuller R.W. Haslett C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1992; 52: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 21Stern M. Savill J. Haslett C. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 911-921PubMed Google Scholar) and exemplified by roles for TGF-β and prostaglandins in the apoptotic cell enhancement of Trypanosoma cruzi growth in macrophages (22Freire-de-Lima C.G. Nascimento D.O. Soares M.B. Bozza P.T. Castro-Faria-Neto H.C. de Mello F.G. DosReis G.A. Lopes M.F. Nature. 2000; 403: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Therefore, a key issue is whether apoptotic cell-induced TGF-β, acting in an autocrine/paracrine fashion, mediates the alterations in eicosanoid generation. By use of a dominant negative TGF-β receptor construct, we have been able to show that apoptotic cells stimulate via their induction of active TGF-β, a coordinate production of generally anti-inflammatory and simultaneous inhibition of generally pro-inflammatory, eicosanoids. The effect is mediated by effects on the synthases for these mediators. Additional coordinate effects were seen on related proteins, including iNOS, which was down-regulated, and PPARγ or arginase, which were induced, i.e. combining to reduce NO production and also potentially in keeping with the anti-inflammatory balance.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and Reagents—TGF-β was purchased from R&D Systems. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS, Escherichia coli 0111:B4) was from List Biological Laboratories, Inc. Recombinant murine interferon-γ was from BD Biosciences. Human factor Va was from Hematologic Technologies Inc. Cyclosporin A and protease inhibitor mixture set I were from Calbiochem. Anti-arginase 1 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies against COX-2, human PGD-2 synthase, murine PGE-1 synthase 1, PGI synthase, thromboxane synthase, 5-LO, 15-LO II, PPARγ1, iNOS, and indomethacin were from Cayman Chemical. Anti-β-actin antibody was from Cell Signaling. mAb217 is an IgM monoclonal antibody that was originally raised against PS-recognizing macrophages. It was obtained from concentrated hybridoma supernatants. Unfortunately, attempts to label, fragment, or convert the antibody to an IgG isotype have universally resulted in loss of activity. [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]Arachidonate acid (200 Ci/mol) was from American Radiolabeled Chemical. Lipofectamine Plus reagent was from Invitrogen.Induction of Apoptotic Cells—Jurkat T cells were exposed to UV irradiation at 254 nm for 10 min. Jurkat T cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum (Gemini Bio-Products) for 3 h at 37°C in 5% CO2. The cells were generally ≥80% apoptotic by nuclear morphology and maintained intact cell membranes that excluded trypan blue (6Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Konowal A. Freed P.W. Westcott J.Y. Henson P.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 890-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (2537) Google Scholar).Cell Culture, Stimulation and Measurement of Pro-inflammatory Mediators by ELISA—Murine peritoneal macrophages were obtained from BALB/c mice 4 days after intraperitoneal injection of 1 ml of thioglycollate. Murine RAW 264 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. RAW-V and RAW-TβRII were made by stable transfection of empty vector and truncated TGF-β receptor II constructs, respectively. The cells (1 × 106 cells/well) were plated in each well of a 24-well tissue culture plate and were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated endotoxin-free fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin under a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C for 24 h. Then the cells were cultured in serum-free DMEM in the absence or presence of LPS, IFN-γ, factor Va, or cyclosporin A for 18 h with 3 × 106 apoptotic Jurkat cells (apoJ), viable Jurkat cells (ViableJ), 50 μg/ml mAb217, 50 μg/ml control isotype IgM, or 100 μm liposomes (containing 30:70 molar ratios of PS:PC or PC alone). The supernatants were collected and measured for TGF-β, TNF-α, PGE2, PGF1α, 15-HETE, LXA4, and leukotrienes by ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions (ELISA TECH, Aurora, CO). In some experiments, to inhibit pro-inflammatory mediators, the macrophages were treated with stimuli cited before and 100 ng/ml LPS or LPS plus 40 units/ml IFN-γ.NO Production Assay—NO levels produced by RAW 264 cells, RAW-TβRII cells, and murine peritoneal macrophages were measured by reducing the nitrate accumulated over 18 h to nitrite with nitrate reductase (23Schmidt H.H. Wilke P. Evers B. Bohme E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 284-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and measuring the nitrite concentration by the method of Green et al. (24Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10674) Google Scholar). The nitrite concentrations were quantified by using a double three-point standard curve of NaNO2 concentrations (in a linear range between 1 and 80 μm).Measurement of Arachidonate Release—Arachidonic acid release was measured as described (25Evans J.H. Fergus D.J. Leslie C.C. BMC Biochem. 2002; 3: 30Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were cultured in 24-well plates to incorporate arachidonate by incubation for 24 h in 1 ml of DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and [3H]arachidonate (1 μCi/ml) for 24 h. Then the cells were washed and incubated in serum-free DMEM containing 0.1% human serum albumin and stimulated with LPS or apoJ or ViableJ or mAb217 or isotype control IgM. The medium was removed 2 h after stimulation and centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min, and the amount of radioactivity (arachidonate and arachidonate products) in the supernatant was determined.Transient Cell Transfection and Reporter Gene Assay—The p3TP-luc (26Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar) luciferase reporter gene construct was transfected into RAW-TβRII and RAW-V cells using Lipofectamine Plus reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. pSV-β-galactosidase vector (Promega) was co-transfected as an internal control to measure differences in transfection efficiency. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured 18 h after TGF-β stimulation using the luciferase assay system (Promega) and Galacto-Light (Tropix), respectively.Immunoblotting Analysis—Immunoblotting analysis was carried out as described previously with some modification (27Frasch S.C. Nick J.A. Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Worthen G.S. Henson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8389-8397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (3.0 × 105 cells/well) were plated in each well of a 12-well tissue culture plate and incubated overnight. Following stimulation, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100 and 1× protease inhibitor mixture set I), resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal loading of proteins in each lane was confirmed by Ponceau S staining or re-probed with corresponding antibodies against the native proteins (28Xiao Y.Q. Malcolm K. Worthen G.S. Gardai S.

The results shown are representative of at least three separate experiments.Statistical Analysis—All data are presented as means ± S.E. from three or more separate experiments. The means were analyzed using analysis of variance for multiple comparisons. When analysis of variance indicated significance, the Tukey-Kramer honestly significant difference test for all pairs was used to compare groups. All data were analyzed using JMP statistical software (version 5; SAS Institute) for the Macintosh computer.RESULTSApoptotic Cells or Antibody to PSRS on Murine Macrophages Stimulate Production of TGF-β and Concomitant Blockade of LPS-induced TNF-α, NO, and iNOS—Murine macrophages (peritoneal or RAW 264, 1.0 × 106 cells/ml) were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) as positive control or mAb217 (50 μg/ml) or apoptotic Jurkat T cells (3 × 106 cells/ml) for 18 h. These stimuli each induced TGF-β production in both types of macrophages (Fig. 1A). Isotype control IgM or viable Jurkat T cells were inactive. These data are in accordance with previous reports (6Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Konowal A. Freed P.W. Westcott J.Y. Henson P.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 890-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (2537) Google Scholar, 16McDonald P.P. Fadok V.A. Bratton D. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6164-6172PubMed Google Scholar). The stimulation of TGF-β production by apoptotic cells in this system was blocked by preincubation of the targets with the PS-binding protein factor Va (Fig. 1B) as had been shown earlier with annexin V (29Seabra S.H. de Souza W. Damatta R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 324: 744-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). PS liposomes also stimulated the production of TGF-β but less efficiently. This is probably because the presentation to the PSRS from PS exposed on the apoptotic cell is from a quite different environment compared with a liposome. However, PS liposomes increased the production of TGF-β in the presence of LPS or cyclosporin A (Fig. 1C). These findings suggest that PS liposomes themselves may up-regulate TGF-β translation when TGF-β message has been induced by other stimuli (17Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Rose D.M. Pearson A. Ezekewitz R.A. Henson P.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar, 30Waiser J. Dell K. Bohler T. Dogu E. Gaedeke J. Budde K. Neumayer H.H. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 2002; 17: 1568-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Classically activated macrophages (LPS and IFN-γ stimulation) exhibit release of TNF-α and NO as well as up-regulation of iNOS. As shown in Fig. 1, D and E, these three responses to stimulation with LPS and IFN-γ were inhibited by exposure of the macrophages to apoptotic cells or mAb217. Previous studies implicated the TGF-β produced, in the suppression of TNF-α induction, and might be expected to serve the same role for suppression of iNOS and NO.To demonstrate this presumed requirement for TGF-β in the suppression, a dominant negative form of the TGFβRII was employed. Transfection of RAW 264 cells with this construct was shown to block the ability of TGF-β to signal for 3xPT-luc reporter (which contains three consecutive 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-response elements and a portion of the plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) promoter region) gene activation (Fig. 2A). Because TGF-β can induce its own synthesis, the effect of the dominant negative receptor was also examined on the production of TGF-β itself after stimulation with apoptotic cells, mAb217, or LPS. As shown in Fig. 2B, this treatment blocked 60–70% of the TGF-β produced by each of the stimuli, i.e. supporting an additional autocrine/paracrine effect of TGF-β on its own induction in these systems.FIGURE 2Transfection of truncated TGFβRII into RAW 264 cells reverses the suppression of TNF-α, NO, iNOS, and arginase 1 up-regulation induced by apoptotic cells or PSRS stimulation. A, RAW macrophages transfected with truncated TGF-β receptor II (RAW-TβRII) and empty vector (RAW-V) were transiently co-transfected with 3xPT-luc and pSV-β-galactosidase constructs. After 48 h, the cells were incubated in the presence of TGF-β (10 ng/ml) for 18 h. The luciferase assays, which were normalized to β-galactosidase, are expressed as relative luciferase unites. #, significantly different from controls. *, significantly different from RAW-V cells stimulated with TGF-β.

In keeping with the suppression of NO production by blocking up-regulation of iNOS, exposure of macrophages to apoptotic cells or PSRS stimuli also led to increases in intracellular levels of arginase 1 (Fig. 2F), which could further reduce the production of nitric oxide.Macrophages with Truncated TGFβRII Are Defective in Prostaglandin Production and Prostaglandin Synthase Expression in Response to Stimulation with Apoptotic Cells or LPS—In the original studies of anti-inflammatory effects of apoptotic cells, PGE2 was also shown to be generated, and it too seemed to play a role in suppression of inflammatory mediators (27Frasch S.C. Nick J.A. Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Worthen G.S. Henson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8389-8397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we next examined the effect of apoptotic cells and stimulation with mAb217 on induction of potentially anti-inflammatory prostaglandins as well as the role of TGF-β in their regulation. The original studies did not address the probable induction of PGI2 (detected as PGF1α) along with PGE2, and accordingly, this was included in the analysis. Supernatants from the cell culture were collected 18 h after stimulation and analyzed for PGE2 and PGF1α. The cell lysates were collected, and the levels of synthases for PGE2 (PGES1), PGD2, and PGI2 were determined by Western blotting. As expected, the two stimuli induced production of PGE2 and PGF1α starting at 2 h or earlier and extending out to 18 h of incubation (Fig. 3, A–C). Importantly, they also increased the intracellular levels of the prostaglandin synthases (Fig. 3D).FIGURE 3Prostaglandin production and prostaglandin synthase expression in response to apoptotic cells or mAb217 stimulation is TGF-β-dependent.

Arteriosclerosis. 1990; 10: 653-657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in data not shown, the direct addition of active TGF-β to the macrophage cultures did stimulate production of PGE2 and PGF1α. When the macrophage response to TGF-β was blocked with the dominant negative receptor, induction of PGE2 and PGF1α by either apoptotic cells or mAb217 was prevented (Fig. 3, A and B). Interestingly, LPS-induced PGE2 and PGF1α were also reduced by about 80%. We suspect that the lack of complete blockade with this stimulus reflects the possible use of alternative pathways not involving TGF-β. In keeping with the data on the prostaglandins themselves, the truncated receptor also reduced up-regulation of the synthases (Fig. 3D), although not to as great an extent as seen for the secreted prostaglandins.These prostaglandins are lipid mediators that like TGF-β have been reported to have pro- or anti-inflammatory properties in different circumstances. For example, we earlier showed PGE2 to decrease TNF-α production from macrophages (6Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Konowal A. Freed P.W. Westcott J.Y."

In Alzheimer disease (AD), soluble amyloid-β (Aβ) appears to be a key factor in inducing synaptic and cognitive abnormalities.

We describe improved cognitive function following a reduction in both soluble Aβ and tau levels after active or passive immunization in advanced aged 3xTg-AD mice that contain both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs).

Alzheimer disease (AD) 2The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer disease; Aβ, amyloid-β; NFT, neurofibrillary tangles; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; IL, interleukin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor. is clinically marked by a progressive deterioration of memory and other cognitive functions. Two obligate neuropathological lesions occur in the AD brain: amyloid plaques, mainly formed by a small peptide called amyloid-β (Aβ), and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) formed by the hyperphosphorylated microtubule-binding protein tau (1Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5170) Google Scholar). The accumulation of Aβ plays a central role in the progression of the disease, and over the past several years, there has been a growing appreciation for the pathogenic effects of soluble assemblies of Aβ, which may be the predominant toxic species for neurons (2Cleary J.P. Walsh D.M. Hofmeister J.J. Shankar G.M. Kuskowski M.A. Selkoe D.J. Ashe K.H. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar, 3Lesne S. Koh M.T. Kotilinek L. Kayed R.

Neuron. 2004; 44: 181-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). The causes underlying AD-related memory loss and other cognitive changes are likely to be multifactorial, and although evidence suggests that soluble Aβ is an excellent candidate to be the initial trigger (4Walsh D.M. Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 2004; 44: 181-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar), other elements of AD neuropathology almost certainly contribute to the progressive deterioration in the cognitive faculties. In this regard, it is likely that the manifestation of tau pathology plays a pivotal role that further exacerbates the cognitive decline in the presence of Aβ and other AD-related alterations. Pathological assemblies of tau can induce neurodegeneration and dementia in the absence of Aβ, as occurs in disorders such as frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP17) (5Cairns N.J. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. J. Pathol. 2004; 204: 438-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Elucidating the relationship between these two proteins (Aβ and tau) and their synergistic effects on cognition is facilitated by the utilization of a transgenic model that develops both Aβ and tau pathology. The 3xTg-AD mice develop an age-dependent decline in the cognitive phenotype in both spatial and contextual learning and memory paradigms. The occurrence of intraneuronal Aβ appears to be a trigger for the onset of deficits in water maze spatial memory, an effect that is fully reversible by Aβ immunotherapy (6Billings L.M. Oddo S. Green K.N. McGaugh J.L. LaFerla F.M. Neuron. 2005; 45: 675-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). However, as the mice age and extracellular Aβ and neurofibrillary pathology manifest, the mice show further cognitive decline, 3L. M. Billings, K. N. Green, J. L. McGaugh, and F. M. LaFerla, submitted manuscript. although the role that plaques and tangles play on the deterioration of the cognitive phenotype is still unresolved. Postmortem evaluation of AD brains has provided some correlational evidence linking these structures to the cognitive decline, with the general finding that tangles are a better correlate than plaques (7Arriagada P.V. Marzloff K. Hyman B.T. Neurology. 1992; 42: 1681-1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8McKee A.C. Kosik K.S. Kowall N.W. Ann. Neurol. 1991; 30: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). However, these types of studies have two inherent limitations. 1) They ignore the dynamic nature of clearance mechanisms; thus, it is possible that the guilty culprit (e.g. plaque or NFT) that induces cognitive decline is no longer present in the brain at the time of autopsy. 2) It is now recognized that soluble Aβ assemblies may directly cause cognitive dysfunction. Moreover, it remains to be established if and how soluble tau accumulation participates in the cognitive decline in the presence of Aβ pathology, which represents the focus of this study. Although increasing evidence suggests that soluble Aβ may be a key factor in inducing cognitive decline, to our knowledge, no firm experimental evidence has been presented to show a comparable role for soluble tau in an experimental mammalian system, particularly in the presence of Aβ pathology. A prior study involving regulatable tau transgenic mice found that NFTs are not sufficient to induce memory loss and neuronal loss, but no mechanism was defined or proposed (9Santacruz K. Lewis J. Spires T. Paulson J. Kotilinek L. Ingelsson M. Guimaraes A. DeTure M. Ramsden M. McGowan E. Forster C. Yue M. Orne J. Janus C. Mariash A. Kuskowski M. Hyman B. Hutton M. Ashe K.H. Science. 2005; 309: 476-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). Aβ immunotherapy, both active and passive, has been shown to be a valuable tool to decrease Aβ pathology and rescue cognitive deficits in several AD transgenic models (10Schenk D. Barbour R. Dunn W.

Although the human clinical trial involving an active immunization approach was suspended because 6% of the patients developed meningoencephalitis (15Check E. Nature. 2002; 415: 462Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) this strategy still holds great potential because it is a disease-modifying intervention, in contrast with currently available treatments (16Nitsch R.M. Alzheimer Dis. Assoc. Disord. 2004; 18: 185-189PubMed Google Scholar, 17Schenk D. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 824-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). A critical issue that remains to be resolved is whether therapeutic interventions aimed at decreasing Aβ will suffice to improve cognition in the presence of established plaques and NFTs. Here we actively or passively immunized aged 3xTg-AD mice to determine whether it was possible to ameliorate their cognitive impairments in the presence of established plaques and NFTs. We report that reduction of both soluble Aβ and tau levels were required to rescue the cognitive impairments. Notably, decreasing soluble Aβ without affecting soluble tau levels did not improve cognition. Therefore, we conclude that Aβ immunotherapy represents an effective strategy for ameliorating cognitive decline even in aged brains marked by resistant amyloid plaques and NFTs. Moreover, these data suggest that soluble tau plays an important role in the cognitive impairments in aged 3xTg-AD mice and by extrapolation independent therapies aimed at further reducing its levels or restoring tau function may lead to even greater cognitive improvements in human patients. Immunization—For active immunization, Aβ42 peptide was synthesized at the University of California Core Facility, and fibrillar Aβ42 (fAβ42) was prepared as previously described (18Cribbs D.H. Ghochikyan A. Vasilevko V. Tran M. Petrushina I. Sadzikava N. Babikyan D. Kesslak P. Kieber-Emmons T. Cotman C.W. Agadjanyan M.G. Int. Immunol. 2003; 15: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and delivered subcutaneously (s.c.). Blood was collected before the first immunization and 10 days after each boost from the retro-orbital sinus into EDTA-coated tubes. Tubes were centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C, and the sera were collected as a supernatant and stored at -80 °C. For passive immunization, the mouse anti-Aβ monoclonal 20.1 antibody was prepared in low endotoxin format from a hybridoma kindly provided by Dr. William Van Nostrand (Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY). The 20.1 antibody is an IgG2b isotype and recognizes the N-terminal region of Aβ spanning amino acids 1-8. Mice were given weekly intraperitoneal injections of 300 μg of 20.1 antibody diluted in 300 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Sera from the mice were collected before and at 24 h and 7 days after administration of the antibody, as well as at the end of experiment. The anti-Aβ antibody concentration as well as Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptide concentration were measured. Behavior—The passive inhibitory avoidance was conducted as previously described (6Billings L.M. Oddo S. Green K.N. McGaugh J.L. LaFerla F.M. Neuron. 2005; 45: 675-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). The T-maze consisted of a central main arm with two side arms positioned perpendicular to the main arm. The central arm was 65-cm long, and the two side arms were 30-cm each. The maze width was 13.5 cm. The walls of the maze were made of transparent acrylic and were 20-cm tall. At the beginning of each test, the mice were placed in the main stem while one side arm was blocked by a barrier so that the mice were forced to make a choice. Once the mice entered the side arm, the entrance was blocked, thus retaining them in the side arm. Mice were left to explore that arm for 120 s at the end of which they were placed back in the main arm of the maze with both side arms open. Mice were free to choose the arm that they already explored or the new arm. Each animal was tested daily for 7 days and on each day we alternatively blocked one side arm. The numbers of alternations and the latency to make a choice during the free trial were recorded. Immunological and Histological Staining—After completion of the behavioral tasks, the mice were trans-cardially perfused with ice-cold PBS. Following perfusion, each brain was cut sagittally, and one-half of the brain was frozen in dry ice whereas the other half was fixed in ice-cold paraformaldehyde for 48 h. After fixation, brains were cut (50-μm thick) using a slicing vibratome (Pelco, Redding, CA), and sections were stored in 0.02% sodium azide in PBS. Immunohistochemical analysis was conducted as previously described (19Oddo S. Billings L. Kesslak J.P. Cribbs D.H. LaFerla F.M. Neuron. 2004; 43: 321-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). For thioflavine staining, sections were incubated in a 0.5% solution of ThioflavineS (Sigma Aldrich) in 50% ethanol for 10 min. Sections were then washed twice for 3 min each in 50% ethanol and twice for 3 min each in water. Quantification of the stained sections was done as previously described (20Oddo S. Caccamo A. Smith I.F. Green K.N. Laferla F.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2006; 168: 184-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Western Blot and ELISA—Brains were homogenized in Tissue Protein Extraction reagent (Pierce) supplemented with a complete mini protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitors (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). The homogenized mixes were briefly sonicated to sheer the DNA and centrifuged at 4 °C for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The supernatant was stored as the soluble fraction. The pellet was re-homogenized in 70% formic acid and centrifuged at 4 °C for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The supernatant was stored as the insoluble fraction. The extraction procedure was confirmed by Western blot, using APP as a marker of soluble proteins and flotillin as a marker of insoluble proteins (data not shown). Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay, and samples were adjusted with T-PER to the same concentration. Western blot and Aβ ELISA experiments were done as previously described (19Oddo S. Billings L. Kesslak J.P. Cribbs D.H. LaFerla F.M.

ELISA measurements of tau were conducted using a total tau ELISA kit from BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The titers of anti-Aβ antibodies were measured as previously described (18Cribbs D.H. Ghochikyan A. Vasilevko V. Tran M. Petrushina I. Sadzikava N. Babikyan D. Kesslak P. Kieber-Emmons T. Cotman C.W. Agadjanyan M.G. Int. Immunol. 2003; 15: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Quantitative Cytokine Assay—Levels of different cytokines were quantitatively measured by Bio-Plex 200 (Bio-Rad) system using the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies—The following antibodies were used in this study: anti-Aβ 6E10 (Signet Laboratories, Dedham, MA), anti-Aβ 1560 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), anti-Aβ40 and anti Aβ42 (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA), anti-Aβ 35-40 (MM32-13.1.1, for Aβ40) or anti-Aβ 35-42 (MM40-21.3.4, for Aβ42), anti-β-actin (Sigma), anti-tau HT7, (Innogenetics, Belgium), AT8 and AT100 (Pierce), 8C11 and 16B5 were a generous gift from Dr. Peter Seubert. HT7, 8C11, and 16B5 recognize tau independent of its phosphorylation state. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferoni post-test using GraphPad Prism version 3.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA. We first sought to determine whether aged mice harboring an extensive plaque and tangle burden would show improved learning and memory following active or passive Aβ immunization. For the active immunization study, thirty 18-month-old 3xTg-AD mice were randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1) untreated, 2) adjuvant only, and 3) fibrillar Aβ42. For the passive immunization, ten 20-month-old 3xTg-AD mice received 300 μg per injection of the anti-Aβ antibody 20.1, which is raised against the first 8 amino acids of the Aβ sequence. The active immunization trial was conducted over a period of 5 months, whereas the passive immunization trial was conducted over a period of 3 months (Fig. 1A). Consequently, all the mice were 23 months old at the conclusion of the experiment. Mice, actively immunized with fAβ42 had significant amounts of circulating anti-Aβ antibody (82.95 ± 37.09 μg/ml) after four injections and maintained uniform elevated levels of anti-Aβ antibodies. The antibody concentration 10 days after the last injection was 101.28 ± 63.61 μg/ml. In contrast, adjuvant-treated or unimmunized mice did not have detectable levels of anti-Aβ antibody during the experiment (data not shown). Average serum titers from the passively immunized mice were 1:53,000 and 1:5,400 at 24-h and 7-days postinjection, respectively. Aβ Vaccination Ameliorates the Behavioral Phenotype despite Persistent Plaques and NFTs—At the end of the treatment period, we evaluated the behavioral phenotype of the 3xTg-AD mice using two different behavioral paradigms, the T-maze and the passive inhibitory avoidance. The former relies on the tendency of mice to alternate free choices in a T-maze during successive trials, and it is mainly based on working memory and is dependent on several brain regions including the basal forebrain, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex (22Lalonde R. Neurosci. Biobehav Rev. 2002; 26: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). The passive inhibitory avoidance is a contextual learning and memory task, which is mainly dependent on the amygdala (23McGaugh J.L. McIntyre C.K. Power A.E. Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 2002; 78: 539-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Aged 3xTg-AD mice that were either untreated or treated with adjuvant only performed at chance levels on the T-maze, i.e. they failed to alternate between the two arms of the maze on successive trials (47.6 ± 2.4% and 46.4 ± 5.2%, respectively, Fig. 1B). In contrast, we found that the percentage of alternations was significantly increased in both actively and passively immunized 3xTg-AD mice (63.5 ± 6.8% and 64.3 ± 2.7%, respectively, Fig. 1B) and was similar to that of age-matched non transgenic (NonTg) mice (71.43 ± 3.37% Fig. 1B). As the ability to successfully alternate with each successive trial is considered to reflect intact working memory (22Lalonde R. Neurosci. Biobehav Rev. 2002; 26: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), these results show that working memory can be restored in aged transgenic mice following active or passive immunization. We next evaluated the mice on a contextual learning and memory task using passive inhibitory avoidance. During the initial training and the subsequent 3-h probe trial, all the groups performed similarly (p < 0.05, Fig. 1C), indicating that the task was learned and retained during the first 3 h. For the 24-h probe, both control groups showed a reduced latency to cross over to the dark compartment, although the results did not achieve statistical significance compared with immunized mice (Fig. 1C). In contrast, analysis at the 36-h probe trial indicated that both the active and passive immunized groups performed similarly to NonTg mice (162.9 ± 17.1, 150.2 ± 19.8, and 173.9 ± 2.8 s), and significantly better than the unimmunized control groups (79.28 ± 17.5 and 93.1 ± 18 s, for untreated and adjuvant treated mice, respectively; Fig. 1C). These results clearly indicate that 23-month-old 3xTg-AD mice can learn and briefly retain this information for the short term, but cannot form long term memories (i.e. 36 h), whereas immunized mice are able to retain the information throughout the duration of the experiment. Reduction of Soluble Aβ Levels by Active and Passive Immunization—We next determined the effect of active and passive immunization on plaque burden in the aged mice. The number of thioflavine-positive plaques did not appear to be statistically reduced in aged 3xTg-AD mice immunized with fAβ42, as the overall burden was similar to the control groups (Fig. 2, A-D). In contrast, the number of thioflavine-positive plaques was significantly reduced in aged 3xTg-AD mice passively immunized (Fig. 2, E and F). The number of plaques per microscopic field was 29 ± 2.8 S.E., 29 ± 2.2 S.E., and 15 ± 2.1 S.E., for the adjuvant, active, and passive immunized mice, respectively (Fig. 2G). Although the number of thioflavine-positive plaques was not significantly reduced in actively immunized mice, we still found that these mice performed significantly better than control mice in both the T-maze and the passive inhibitory avoidance tasks. Consequently, we analyzed brain extracts from these mice by sandwich ELISA to determine if total Aβ levels were reduced. Among all the groups analyzed, insoluble Aβ40 and Aβ42 were only significantly reduced in passively immunized mice (Fig. 2H), consistent with the immunohistochemical results. Notably, soluble Aβ42 levels were significantly lower in both the actively and passively immunized mice (Fig. 2H), whereas soluble Aβ40 levels were significantly decreased following passive immunization but not with active immunization (Fig. 2H). As the reduction of soluble Aβ42 levels was the only species of Aβ consistently changed among all the immunized mice, it indicates that lowering this Aβ species even in mice with extensive plaque and tangle neuropathology can lead to improvements in cognition. These results are consistent with recent data showing that soluble Aβ better correlates with memory impairments in AD patients and transgenic mice (6Billings L.M. Oddo S. Green K.N. McGaugh J.L.

Reduction of Soluble but Not Insoluble Tau by Active and Passive Immunization—Because we immunized aged mice with very extensive plaque and tangle pathology, we next determined whether active or passive immunization had any beneficial downstream effects on the tau pathology. Although our previous studies showed that a single intrahippocampal injection of Aβ antibodies was able to reduce early, but not late hyperphosphorylated/aggregated tau in 1-year-old mice (19Oddo S.

Klein W.L. LaFerla F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1599-1604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), it remains to be established whether active or chronic passive immunization would be efficacious in aged mice with very advanced neuropathology. To address this issue, we immunostained sections with antibodies that recognize specific phospho-tau epitopes (AT100, AT8, PHF-1) or histologically evaluated sections following staining with Gallyas silver impregnation. As expected, neither active nor passive immunization had any discernable effect on the number of Gallyas-positive neurons or on the number of PHF-1- and AT8-positive neurons (Fig. 3, A-L). In contrast, we found that the number of AT100-positive neurons was reduced following immunization compared with the control groups (Fig. 3, M-P). This finding was notable as AT100 is an early marker of tau pathology in the 3xTg-AD mice, 4S. Oddo, A. Caccamo, and F. M. LaFerla, submitted manuscript. whereas AT8- and PHF-1-positive neurons appear at later ages (31Oddo S. Caccamo A. Shepherd J.D. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Kayed R. Metherate R. Mattson M.P. Akbari Y. LaFerla F.M. Neuron. 2003; 39: 409-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3196) Google Scholar). This finding is also consistent with our previous observations and the emerging data from the human clinical trials showing that soluble tau levels may be reduced by Aβ immunotherapy, whereas the NFT burden appears unchanged (32Ferrer I.

Med. 2003; 9: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). Although Gallyas-positive NFTs were unaffected by prolonged active or passive Aβ immunization, it is possible that soluble forms of tau may be reduced. To investigate this issue and to better quantify the changes in tau pathology, we measured total tau levels by Western blot using several phosphodependent (PHF-1, AT8, and AT100) tau antibodies. As expected based on the immunohistochemical data, we found that the levels of PHF-1 and AT8 reactivity were unaltered among all the groups (Fig. 4, A-C), whereas there was a significant reduction in AT100 levels in the immunized mice compared with the control groups (Fig. 4, A and D). To better quantify the changes in tau, we quantitatively measured tau levels in the soluble and insoluble fraction by sandwich ELISA and found that insoluble tau levels were unaltered among all the groups (Fig. 4E). Notably, soluble tau levels were significantly reduced in the actively and passively immunized mice compared with untreated or adjuvant-treated control mice (Fig. 4E). These results are consistent with our previous results showing that a single injection of an anti-Aβ antibody is sufficient to clear not only Aβ but also early tau pathology (19Oddo S. Billings L.

The mechanism underlying the Aβ antibody-mediated reduction in tau pathology appears to be dependent on the proteasome, as inhibiting its activity prevented the Aβ-mediated clearance of tau (19Oddo S. Billings L. Kesslak J.P. Cribbs D.H. LaFerla F.M. Neuron. 2004; 43: 321-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar).FIGURE 4Soluble tau levels were reduced by both active and passive immunization. A, representative Western blots probed with a series of anti-tau antibodies. B and C, consistent with the immunohistochemical findings, the levels of PHF1 and AT8 by Western blot were unaltered following active and passive immunization, whereas the levels of AT100 immunoreactivity (D) was significantly reduced following both active and passive immunization. Note that densitometric analyses were performed by normalizing PHF-1, AT8, and AT100 levels to β-actin. E, sandwich ELISA measurements revealed that the levels of detergent-insoluble tau were unaffected by Aβ immunotherapy, whereas the levels of detergent-soluble tau were significantly reduced in the immunized mice versus untreated and adjuvant-treated 3xTg-AD mice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Reducing Soluble Aβ without Reducing Soluble Tau Does Not Improve Cognition—Taken together, the data presented here demonstrate that it is possible to ameliorate the cognitive impairments in the 3xTg-AD mice by reducing soluble Aβ42 and tau levels, even in the presence of thioflavine-positive plaques and Gallyas-positive NFTs. It remains to be established, however, if the reduction of both soluble Aβ42 and tau levels is necessary to rescue the cognitive impairments or if the reduction of only soluble Aβ42 will suffice. We previously showed that the clearance of Aβ and tau pathology is hierarchical, with Aβ pathology cleared first and tau pathology reduced following the clearance of Aβ pathology (19Oddo S.

The complete genome sequence is 4,376,040-bp long and contains 3,992 predicted protein-coding sequences. Genome comparison with the Azoarcus-related soil bacterium strain EbN1 revealed a surprisingly low degree of synteny. Coding sequences involved in the synthesis of surface components potentially important for plant-microbe interactions were more closely related to those of plant-associated bacteria. Strain BH72 appears to be 'disarmed' compared to plant pathogens, having only a few enzymes that degrade plant cell walls; it lacks type III and IV secretion systems, related toxins and an N-acyl homoserine lactones–based communication system. The genome contains remarkably few mobile elements, indicating a low rate of recent gene transfer that is presumably due to adaptation to a stable, low-stress microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W1982178416,"Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a omega-3 essential fatty acid that reduces the incidence and severity of a number of diseases. Recently, a novel series of DHA-derived lipid mediators with potent protective actions has been identified. In this study we demonstrate that dietary amplification of these DHA-derived products protects the liver from necroinflammatory injury. In vitro, supplementation of hepatocytes with DHA significantly reduced hydrogen peroxide-induced DNA damage, evaluated by the ""comet assay,"" and oxidative stress, determined by measurement of malondialdehyde levels. In vivo, dietary supplementation of mice with DHA ameliorated carbon tetrachloride-induced necroinflammatory damage. In addition, hepatic cyclooxygenase-2 expression and PGE2 levels were significantly reduced in mice fed DHA-enriched diets. In these animals, increased hepatic formation of DHA-derived lipid mediators (i.e., 17S-hydroxy-DHA (17S-HDHA) and protectin D1) was detected by HPLC-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. Consistent with these findings, synthetic 17-HDHA abrogated genotoxic and oxidative damage in hepatocytes and decreased TNF-alpha release and 5-lipoxygenase expression in macrophages. In a transactivation assay, 17-HDHA acted in a concentration-dependent manner as a PPARgamma agonist. Taken together, these findings identify a potential role for DHA-derived products, specifically 17S-HDHA and protectin D1, in mediating the protective effects of dietary DHA in necroinflammatory liver injury."
https://openalex.org/W2006055704,"Several homeodomain (HD) proteins are critical for skeletal patterning and respond directly to BMP2 as an early step in bone formation. RUNX2, the earliest transcription factor proven essential for commitment to osteoblastogenesis, is also expressed in response to BMP2. However, there is a gap in our knowledge of the regulatory cascade from BMP2 signaling to the onset of osteogenesis. Here we show that BMP2 induces DLX3, a homeodomain protein that activates <i>Runx2</i> gene transcription. Small interfering RNA knockdown studies in osteoblasts validate that DLX3 is a potent regulator of <i>Runx2</i>. Furthermore in <i>Runx2</i> null cells, DLX3 forced expression suffices to induce transcription of <i>Runx2</i>, osteocalcin, and alkaline phosphatase genes, thus defining DLX3 as an osteogenic regulator independent of RUNX2. Our studies further show regulation of the <i>Runx2</i> gene by several homeodomain proteins: MSX2 and CDP/cut repress whereas DLX3 and DLX5 activate endogenous <i>Runx2</i> expression and promoter activity in non-osseous cells and osteoblasts. These HD proteins exhibit distinct temporal expression profiles during osteoblast differentiation as well as selective association with <i>Runx2</i> chromatin that is related to <i>Runx2</i> transcriptional activity and recruitment of RNA polymerase II. <i>Runx2</i> promoter mutagenesis shows that multiple HD elements control expression of <i>Runx2</i> in relation to the stages of osteoblast maturation. Our studies establish mechanisms for commitment to the osteogenic lineage directly through BMP2 induction of HD proteins DLX3 and DLX5 that activate <i>Runx2</i>, thus delineating a transcriptional regulatory pathway mediating osteoblast differentiation. We propose that the three homeodomain proteins MSX2, DLX3, and DLX5 provide a key series of molecular switches that regulate expression of <i>Runx2</i> throughout bone formation."
https://openalex.org/W2137669462,"Even the simplest environmental stimuli elicit responses in large populations of neurons in early sensory cortical areas. How these distributed responses are read out by subsequent processing stages to mediate behavior remains unknown. Here we used voltage-sensitive dye imaging to measure directly population responses in the primary visual cortex (V1) of monkeys performing a demanding visual detection task. We then evaluated the ability of different decoding rules to detect the target from the measured neural responses. We found that small visual targets elicit widespread responses in V1, and that response variability at distant sites is highly correlated. These correlations render most previously proposed decoding rules inefficient relative to one that uses spatially antagonistic center-surround summation. This optimal decoder consistently outperformed the monkey in the detection task, demonstrating the sensitivity of our techniques. Overall, our results suggest an unexpected role for inhibitory mechanisms in efficient decoding of neural population responses.

The degenerative processes in MLIV and in most other lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are not limited to brain but also involve skeletal and cardiac muscle, skin, parietal cell, and other tissues (15Tardy C.

The range of pathological manifestations in many LSDs is similar and suggests that a generalized mechanism of degeneration exists. One such mechanism may involve the lysosomal-mitochondrial axis, as proposed for aged cardiac myocytes (18Terman A. Dalen H. Eaton J.W. Neuzil J. Brunk U.T. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

This model suggests that accumulation of lipofuscin in lysosomes of post-mitotic cardiac myocytes impairs lysosomal function. Because lysosomes are major players in autophagic recycling of mitochondria (20Uchiyama Y. Arch. Histol. Cytol. 2001; 64: 233-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 21Bursch W.

Therefore, one expects to see accumulation of fragmented mitochondria in cells with lysosomal deficiencies. By analogy with this model, we proposed that lysosomal deficiencies in LSDs should also affect mitochondrial homeostasis. Normal mitochondria are frequently arranged in extended linear networks, allowing intermitochondrial communication to facilitate crucial energetic and calcium buffering functions (reviewed in Refs. 31Karbowski M. Youle R.J. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 870-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar and 32Skulachev V.P. Trends Biochem.

Our results demonstrate significant changes in both the appearance and function of mitochondria in skin fibroblast cultures from patients with MLIV and other LSDs. This is pathogenically significant for mucolipidoses because post-mitotic neurons and cardiomyocytes are especially sensitive to alterations in mitochondrial function (18Terman A. Dalen H. Eaton J.W. Neuzil J. Brunk U.T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1019: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 24Chen H. Chan D.C. Hum. Mol.

We hypothesize that impaired lysosomal function in MLIV affects autophagy of mitochondria, which leads to accumulation of effete mitochondria that cannot effectively buffer cytoplasmic Ca2+. As a result, cells affected by MLIV are more sensitive to pro-apoptotic effects of Ca2+-mobilizing agonists than cells with normal mitochondria. At present, little is known about the pathways leading to cell death in LSDs. A recent paper by Schaheen et al. (34Schaheen L. Dang H. Fares H. Dev. Biol. 2006; 293: 382-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) reports that mutations in CUP-5, a Caenorhabditis elegans orthologue of TRP-ML1, lead to increased apoptosis, but it did not explain why a cell death pathway is activated in the CUP-5-deficient cells. We believe that our results provide a mechanistic explanation that links suppression of lysosomal function in MLIV, and perhaps other LSDs, with cell death.

Fura-2AM was from TefLabs (Austin, TX). Cells—Skin fibroblasts from MLIV, MLII, and MLIII patients (clones WG 0909, WG 0229, and WG 0109) and corresponding heterozygous nondiseased parent skin fibroblasts (clones WG 0987 and WG 0140) were obtained from the Repository for Mutant Human Cell Strains of Montreal Children's Hospital (Montreal, Canada). MLIV fibroblasts clone GM02525 and CLN2 fibroblasts clone GM09404 were from Coriell Cell Repositories (Boston, MA). Fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% streptomycin (all from Atlanta Biologicals, Atlanta, GA). Confocal Immunocytochemistry—For experiments with fixed cells, the cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed and permeabilized by 10 min of incubation at –20 °C with 100% methanol or were fixed by a 5-min incubation with 3.7% formaldehyde and permeabilized by incubation with 0.01% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 5 min. After fixation, nonspecific sites were blocked by incubation in 5% goat serum. Subsequently the cells were incubated with the primary antibodies in blocking solution. Following wash-out of the primary antibodies with PBS, the cells were stained with fluorescent secondary antibodies and analyzed as above. Primary antibodies used for immunocytochemistry for LC3 were clone H-50 and clone 6H2 for cytochrome c. They were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The primary cytochrome c antibodies used in Western blotting were clone 6H2.B4 from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Primary antibodies for caspase-8 (clone 1C12) were from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). For experiments with live cells, the cells on coverslips were bathed in the standard bath solution, which contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Following loading with dyes and three washes, the coverslips were mounted into a perfusion chamber containing standard solution. The chamber was placed on the stage of a Bio-Rad 1024 confocal microscope, and fluorescence was recorded and analyzed off-line using ImageJ software. Measurement of [Ca2+]i—For standard fluorescence recording experiments, the cells grown on coverslips were loaded with 5 μm Fura-2AM in the standard solution for 30 min at 37 °C. Following three washes, the coverslips were placed in the perfusion chamber that allows rapid exchange of bath solutions. The solutions were applied by bath perfusion with ten volumes of the perfusion chamber. Fura was excited by alternating 340/380-nm light, and the resulting 510-nm fluorescence was recorded through a CCD-cooled camera and analyzed using Metafluor software (Universal Images Corporation). To record mitochondrial Ca2+, the cells were loaded with Rhod2 and analyzed essentially as above. To record MDC fluorescence, the coverslips were washed three times with 1× PBS and incubated with 0.05 mm MDC diluted in 1× PBS for 10 min at 37 °C. The coverslips were washed three times with 1× PBS to remove excess and placed in the perfusion chamber. MDC fluorescence was excited by 340-nm light and recorded at 510 nm. Apoptosis Assays—TUNEL and annexin V-based assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Confluent coverslips, either untreated or treated with an apoptosis-inducing agonist, were washed three times with 1× PBS. The cells were fixed with –20 °C methanol for 10 min and washed three times with 1× PBS. The coverslips were incubated in 300 nm DAPI (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) diluted in 1× PBS for 5 min, washed three times with 1× PBS, and mounted on slides. Caspase-8 Fluorogenic Substrates—The fluorogenic Z-IETD-AFC substrate (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) was used to measure the caspase-8 activity in this study (35Karahashi H. Amano F. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2000; 23: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Lysate (10 μg of protein) was prepared in 200 μl of reaction buffer (0.1% CHAPS buffer containing 20 mm PIPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% sucrose) and mixed with 20 μm Z-IETD-AFC. The fluorescence of the cleavage product was measured over time at 37 °C in a microplate spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices; excitation wavelength, 400 nm; emission, 505 nm). Proteolytic activity was expressed as relative fluorescence units normalized to control cultures. Mitochondrial Appearance in MLIV—Live skin fibroblasts from a heterozygous control relative and a MLIV patient, homozygous for the TRP-ML1 mutation (clones WG0987 and WG0909, henceforth identified as MLIV-control and MLIV fibroblasts, respectively) were stained with 1 μm Mitotracker Red or 1 μm 123-rhodamine. At these concentrations, both dyes showed nearly perfect overlap, and from this point on, the description and statistical analysis of mitochondrial appearance in the two cell types were performed on 123-rhodamine-stained cells. Confocal analysis revealed significant differences in mitochondrial appearance between MLIV-control and MLIV cells. Mitochondrial chain length was estimated by manually tracing unbranched mitochondria on confocal images of the cells and measuring their length using ImageJ software. In MLIV-control fibroblasts, mitochondria are organized as extended threads with average lengths of 73.8 ± 4.5 μm (n = 25 cells and all results are the means ± S.E.) (Fig. 1, A and B). In comparison, MLIV cells contain mitochondria that appear significantly shorter with an average length of 33.1 ± 2.6 μm (n = 20, p < 0.05) (Fig. 1, A and B). Mitotracker Red showed the same fragmentation pattern as 123-rhodamine. Similar results were obtained with the MLIV fibroblasts clone GM02525 (not shown). As another indicator of mitochondrial fragmentation, the numbers of separately identifiable mitochondrial particles/cell were analyzed. The average numbers of mitochondria in MLIV-control fibroblasts were 32.6 ± 3.8 (n = 11) and 94.5 ± 7.8 (n = 12, p < 0.05) in MLIV cells (Fig. 1B). Mitochondrial fragmentation in MLIV cells was associated not only with an increase in numbers of shorter mitochondria but also with a depletion of longer mitochondria (see a representative histogram in Fig. 1C). Mitochondrial fragmentation in MLIV fibroblasts cannot be explained by differences between proliferation rates of control and MLIV fibroblasts because our own observations do not indicate such a difference. TRP-ML1 did not colocalize with mitochondria (data not shown) and is therefore unlikely to directly regulate mitochondrial length and/or function. Mitochondrial fragmentation was previously reported in post-mitotic myocytes with lipofuscin deposits in lysosomes (18Terman A. Dalen H. Eaton J.W. Neuzil J. Brunk U.T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1019: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 19Brunk U.T. Terman A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1996-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 23Terman A. Dalen H.

Biogerontology. 2005; 6: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and because MLIV is associated with suppressed lipid degradation in the lysosomal pathway, we hypothesized that depressed lysosomal function contributed to the mitochondrial fragmentation observed in MLIV fibroblasts. Furthermore, a prediction can be made that mitochondrial fragmentation similar to that observed in MLIV fibroblasts and aged cardiac myocytes should also be observed in fibroblasts with other LSDs or in cells whose lysosomal function is suppressed by pharmacological means. Mitochondrial Alterations in Other Mucolipidoses—Fig. 1 (A and B) shows that mitochondrial fragmentation is also observed in fibroblasts from an MLIII patient but not from a matching heterozygous control relative (clones WG0109 and WG0140 will be identified as MLIII and MLIII-control, respectively). Average mitochondrial numbers were 34.8 ± 3.5 (n = 11) in MLIII-control fibroblasts and 123.6 ± 13.7 in MLIII fibroblasts (n = 10, p < 0.05) (Fig. 1, A and B). Fibroblasts from an MLII patient (clone WG0229) showed a similar trend (39.5 ± 8.1 μm (n = 25) and 91.6 ± 6.1 average mitochondrial number (n = 10, p < 0.05)) (Fig. 1, A and B). Fibroblasts from an unrelated storage disease, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 2 (CLN2, clone GM09404), which is a result of mutations in a gene coding for tripeptidyl peptidase I, also contained numerous, fragmented mitochondria (average mitochondrial length was 19.1 ± 1.2 μm (n = 25), and the average mitochondrial number was 105.8 ± 7.2 (Fig. 1, A and B). Lysosomal Function, Autophagy, and Mitochondrial Fragmentation—MLII, MLIII, MLIV, and CLN2 are caused by lysosomal dysfunctions linked to inefficient breakdown of lipids or proteins (37Sleat D.E. Wiseman J.A. El-Banna M. Kim K.H. Mao Q. Price S. Macauley S.L. Sidman R.L. Shen M.M. Zhao Q. Passini M.A. Davidson B.L. Stewart G.R. Lobel P. J.

The fact that these LSDs result from mutations in completely different proteins yet cause same mitochondrial phenotype indicates a common cause of mitochondrial fragmentation in these diseases, such as lysosomal dysfunction. We used a series of lysosomal degradation inhibitors to determine whether impaired completion of autophagolysosomal degradation could explain the observed alterations in mitochondrial organization in the mutant cells. Lysosomal function was suppressed using bafilomycin, which blocks the lysosomal V-type H+ pump, nigericin, the H+ ionophore, and ammonium chloride, which disrupt the acidic environment essential for lysosomal hydrolase activities (39Jin S. Zhang B. Weisz O.A. Montelaro R.C. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 14489-14497Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that treatment of MLIV-control and MLIII-control cells with bafilomycin (0.1–100 nm) for 3 days induced mitochondrial fragmentation similar to that observed in the LSD fibroblasts (Fig. 2A). Average mitochondrial lengths in bafilomycin-treated mitochondria were 21.0 ± 0.8 and 10.7 ± 0.5 μm, respectively (n = 20 and 20, p < 0.05 for both sets). Short treatment with bafilomycin did not induce significant mitochondrial fragmentation (Fig. 2, A and B). Therefore, these changes do not reflect rapid induction of mitochondrial fission by lysosomal or autophagy inhibitors. Counting individual mitochondria in control and treated cells confirmed that cells treated with lysosomal inhibitors contained more discrete mitochondrial fragments than untreated cells (Fig. 2C). Similar results were obtained with nigericin and ammonium chloride used as lysosomal inhibitors (data not shown). The primary pathway through which mitochondria recycle and renew is autophagy, a process in which lysosomes are key participants (33Jolly R.D. Brown S. Das A.M. Walkley S.U. Neurochem. Int. 2002; 40: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 40Zhao M. Antunes F. Eaton J.W. Brunk U.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 3778-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 41Winchester B.G. Eur. J. Paediatr. Neurol. 2001; 5: 11-19Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Upstream signals that stimulate autophagy include Vps34, a class III PI3K, and inhibition of Vps34 by 3-MA effectively inhibits starvation-induced autophagy (42Stroikin Y. Dalen H. Loof S. Terman A. Eur J. Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To see whether disrupted autophagy could result in mitochondrial changes observed in MLIV and MLIII fibroblasts, we used a pharmacologic inhibitor of autophagy. Fig. 2A shows that treating MLIV-control and MLIII-control fibroblasts with 5 mm 3-MA for 3–4 days induced mitochondrial fragmentation similar to that observed in MLIV and MLIII fibroblasts. Average mitochondrial lengths of 3-MA-treated MLIV-control and MLIII-control fibroblasts were 32.3 ± 1.7 and 34.7 ± 2.4 μm, respectively (n = 20 and 20, p < 0.05). Short, 1-h treatment with 3-MA did not induce noticeable mitochondrial fragmentation (Fig. 2, B and C), indicating that 3-MA does not directly induce mitochondrial fission. Thus, inhibition of autophagocytosis results in the loss of the extended, filamentous mitochondrial network and accumulation of individual, isolated mitochondria as observed in MLIV and MLIII fibroblasts. The number of individual mitochondria per cell was also higher in 3-MA-treated control fibroblasts than in untreated controls (Fig. 2C). Based on these three series of experiments, we conclude that suppression of lysosomal function in LSDs results in the accumulation of isolated, fragmented mitochondria. By analogy with lipofuscin-induced mitochondrial fragmentation reported by Terman et al. (18Terman A. Dalen H. Eaton J.W. Neuzil J. Brunk U.T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1019: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that mitochondrial fragmentation in LSDs is a result of suppressed autolysosomal degradation of mitochondria. Mitochondrial Ca2+ Buffering in MLIV—Mitochondria are involved in Ca2+ homeostasis because they work as Ca2+ sinks buffering cytoplasmic Ca2+ and preventing large Ca2+ transients that might otherwise be damaging for cells (43Boitier E. Rea R. Duchen M.R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 795-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 44Monteith G.R. Blaustein M.P. Am. J.

Mitochondria are normally organized as extended cellular networks, and we hypothesized that disruption of this network would significantly impair mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering. To test [Ca2+]i buffering by mitochondria, the cells were stimulated with a Ca2+-mobilizing agonist, bradykinin (Bk), and the amount of Ca2+ accumulated in mitochondria after completion of the Ca2+ flux was compared. Bk activates phospholipase Cβ, generates inositol (1Mach L. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 4Bargal R. Bach G. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1989; 181: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 5Bach G. Desnick R.J. Enzyme. 1988; 40: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) trisphosphate, and induces both Ca2+ release for endoplasmic reticulum and associated Ca2+ influx (46Broad L.M. Braun F.J.

MLIV-control and MLIV fibroblasts showed normal Ca2+ release and influx (Fig. 3A). The endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ load in MLIV-control and MLIV fibroblasts was previously analyzed using ionomycin and was found to be very similar in the two cell types (8Soyombo A.A. Tjon-Kon-Sang S. Rbaibi Y. Bashllari E. Bisceglia J. Muallem S. Kiselyov K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7294-7301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Therefore, the differences in mitochondrial Ca2+ load described below can be directly attributed to variations in mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in control and LSD cells. During the [Ca2+]i spike, some of the Ca2+ is accumulated by mitochondria; this amount can be estimated by releasing mitochondrial Ca2+ with the mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP, which collapses mitochondrial membrane potential. When applied during Ca2+ response, 0.1 μm FCCP induced an increase in [Ca2+]i in 9 of 14 of MLIV-control cells (Fig. 3A). The increase was never seen in MLIV fibroblasts (25 cells tested). Similar results were obtained with GM02525 MLIV fibroblasts. We conclude that the mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering capacity is markedly reduced in MLIV fibroblasts as compared with MLIV-control fibroblasts. To determine whether suppressed mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation could be a general feature of LSDs, we used MLIII-control and MLIII fibroblasts. Fig. 3A shows that much like MLIV fibroblasts, MLIII fibroblasts did not release Ca2+ in response to FCCP application during Bk-induced Ca2+ response, whereas MLIII-control SF did. These data represent 11 of 11 MLIII-control and 12 of 12 MLIII fibroblasts. No mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation was detected in 20 of 20 MLII or 10 of 10 CLN2 fibroblasts (data not shown). Because FCCP is a H+ ionophore, a possibility exists that the FCCP-induced Ca2+ release originates, at least partially, from lysosomes. To remove this uncertainty, we depleted lysosomal Ca2+ by bursting lysosomes using 100 μm glycyl-phenylalanine-naphthylamide. This peptide is cleaved in lysosomes, thus exerting osmotic pressure on their membranes. The resulting osmotic shock bursts lysosomes and releases lysosomal Ca2+ (47Haller T. Dietl P. Deetjen P. Volkl H. Cell Calcium. 1996; 19: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 48Srinivas S.P. Ong A. Goon L. Bonanno J.A. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 2341-2350PubMed Google Scholar). We found that bursting lysosomes with glycyl-phenylalanine-naphthylamide released lysosomal Ca2+ into the cytoplasm but did not affect FCCP-induced Ca2+ release (data not shown). Therefore, FCCP-induced Ca2+ release originates largely or entirely from mitochondria. FCCP has equal access to mitochondria in MLIV-control and MLIV fibroblasts because it was equally effective in dissipating 123-rhodamine mitochondrial stain (Fig. 3B). The FCCP-based assay was validated by directly measuring mitochondrial Ca2+ using mi"

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 313-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The SDF-1-CXCR4 signaling system is now known to be critical for the regulation of the migration, proliferation, differentiation, and survival of lymphocyte, as reflected by its key role in lymphocyte trafficking and overall immune surveillance (8Klein R.S. Rubin J.B. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 306-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). CXCR4 is also an obligatory co-receptor for the infection of T-cell tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) strains (9Juarez J. Bendall L. Histol. Histopathol. 2004; 19: 299-309PubMed Google Scholar, 10Berger E.A. Murphy P.M. Farber J.M. Annu. Rev.

Indeed, mouse embryos lacking either SDF-1 or CXCR4 display many lethal defects, including impaired hematopoiesis, malformations of the intestinal vasculature, cardiac ventricular septal defects, and abnormal migration of cerebellar neurons (11Ma Q. Jones D. Borghesani P.R. Segal R.A. Nagasawa T. Kishimoto T. Bronson R.T. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9448-9453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar, 12Tachibana K.

Nature. 1998; 393: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2107) Google Scholar). In addition, SDF-1 and CXCR4 participate in a number of pathologic conditions that involve aberrant cell motility, such as the metastatic spread of cancerous cells (14Juarez J. Bendall L. Bradstock K. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2004; 10: 1245-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). For example, CXCR4 is largely overexpressed in many frequently malignant tumors, including breast, lung, and prostate cancer, whereas the expression of SDF-1 is high in the organs in which these tumors metastasize, such as lymph nodes and lung (15Zlotnik A. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2004; 14: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SDF-1 is a potent chemoattractant for breast cancer cells in vitro, and neutralizing CXCR4 antibodies inhibit the metastasis of these cells to organs with high expression of SDF-1 in vivo (16Muller A. Homey B. Soto H. Ge N. Catron D. Buchanan M.E. McClanahan T. Murphy E. Yuan W. Wagner S.N. Barrera J.L. Mohar A. Verastegui E. Zlotnik A. Nature. 2001; 410: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (4410) Google Scholar).The signaling mechanisms by which CXCR4 promotes cell migration are not fully elucidated. It is well known that CXCR4 is coupled to pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive heterotrimeric G proteins of the Gi family, which promote the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the accumulation of D-3 phosphoinositol lipids (17Dutt P. Wang J.F. Groopman J.E. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3652-3658PubMed Google Scholar, 18Curnock A.P. Sotsios Y. Wright K.L. Ward S.G. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 4021-4030Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling can in turn promote cell migration in response to SDF-1 by activating ITK, a Tec family kinase (19Fischer A.M. Mercer J.C. Iyer A. Ragin M.J. August A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29816-29820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, whether other heterotrimeric G proteins are also required for cell migration and, if so, the nature of their downstream targets is not fully understood. Here, we took advantage of the fact that Jurkat T-cells express CXCR4 receptors endogenously, and thus migrate readily in response to SDF-1, to begin dissecting the signaling network by which CXCR4 controls directional cell motility. We found that whereas Gi regulates cell migration by activating Rac through Gβγ heterotrimeric G protein subunits, CXCR4 utilizes the α subunit of G13 to activate Rho and that the functional activity of Gi and G13, hence the coordinated activation of Rac and Rho, are both required for CXCR4-induced cell migration in response to SDF-1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Recombinant human stromal cell-derived factor 1 alpha and biotin-conjugated mouse monoclonal anti-CXCR4 antibody and mouse IgG2B isotype antibody were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN).

Cells were transfected by Lipofectamine-PLUS (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's directions.CXCR4 shRNA and Gα13 shRNA—To knock down the expression of CXCR4 and Gα13, CXCR4 shRNA, GCGCGGCCAAGTTCTTAGTTGCTGTTAGTGAAGCCACAGATGTAACAGCAACTAAGAACTTGGCCATGCCTACTGCCTCGGA, which targets CXCR4 mRNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number AY728138) at nucleotide 5457-5478, and Gα13shRNA, TGCTGTTGACAGTGAGCGCTAAGATGATGTCGTTTGATACTAGTGAAGCCACAGATGTAGTATCAAACGACATCATCTTATTGCCTACTGCCTCGGA, which targets Gα13 mRNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number NM_006572) at nucleotide 412-438, were subcloned into the pENTR-shRNA vector between the XhoI and EcoRI sites. LR reaction (the Gateway attL × attR reaction) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions to transfer the CXCR4 shRNA or Gα13 shRNA insert from pENTR-shRNA into PWPI-GW, a Gateway-compatible lentiviral destination vector (24Wiznerowicz M. Trono D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8957-8961Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar).Lentivirus Infection—Lentiviral stocks were prepared and titrated as previously reported using 293T cells as the packaging cells (25Basile J.R. Barac A. Zhu T. Guan K.L. Gutkind J.S. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 5212-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Jurkat cells were incubated with viral supernatants for 12 h. After that, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and returned to normal growth medium.Flow Cytometric Analysis—Cells were harvested and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Following incubation with biotin-conjugated anti-CXCR-4 antibody or isotype control antibody for 60 min at room temperature, the cells were treated with streptavidin-phycoerythrin-conjugated IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 30 min at room temperature and analyzed with a BD Biosciences flow cytometer.Chemotaxis Assay—Chemotaxis assay was determined with a 48-well Boyden chamber (NeuroProbe, Gaithersburg, MD) using a polyvinyl pyrrolidone-free polycarbonate filter with a 5-μm pore size (Nuclepore; Corning Costar, Acton, MA). Filters were not coated with extracellular matrix molecules to prevent the influence of cell adhesion to the chemotactic response to SDF-1. Briefly, 50 μl of Jurkat cells transfected by Renilla luciferase with or without other constructs were added to the upper chamber, and a similar volume of cell suspension was kept as transfection efficiency control. The chemoattractant was added to the lower chamber. Cells migrated into the lower chamber were collected after 4 h of incubation, and Renilla luciferase activities present in cellular lysates were assayed using the dual luciferase reporter system. In each case, migration was calculated as the ratio between the luciferase activity in migrating cells (lower chamber) and the total luciferase activity in the 50-μl cell suspension.Rho GTPase Pulldown Assay—In vivo Rho and Rac activity was assessed by a modified method described elsewhere (21Montaner S. Sodhi A. Servitja J.M. Ramsdell A.K. Barac A. Sawai E.T. Gutkind J.S. Blood. 2004; 104: 2903-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, after serum starvation overnight, cells were treated as indicated and lysed at 4 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm EGTA, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were incubated with glutathione S-transferase-rhotekin-Rho binding domain previously bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads for Rho activity assay or with a purified, bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the cdc42/Rac-interacting binding (CRIB) domain of PAK1 previously bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads for Rac activity. Associated GTP-bound forms of Rho or Rac were released with protein loading buffer and analyzed by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody against Rho or Rac.Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μl/ml aprotinin and leupeptin) for 15 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P; Millipore). The membranes were then incubated with the appropriate antibodies.RESULTSSDF-1 Induces Jurkat Cell Migration through CXCR4—To investigate the mechanism underlying the ability of SDF-1 to promote cell migration, we took advantage of the Jurkat T cell line that expresses CXCR4 endogenously (26Peacock J.W. Jirik F.R. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 215-223PubMed Google Scholar). We first confirmed CXCR4 expression on Jurkat cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Saos-2 cells, which do not express of CXCR4, were used as a negative control. As shown in Fig. 1A, we observed remarkable expression of CXCR4 on Jurkat cells, whereas no expression of CXCR4 was detected on Saos-2 cells (not shown). We then determined the functional activity of CXCR4 in Jurkat cells by analyzing the activation of ERK, a typical response elicited by GPCRs (20Crespo P. Xu N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar) by SDF-1. Exposure of Jurkat cells to SDF-1 resulted in the fast accumulation of the phosphorylated active form of ERK, which peaked at ∼5 min after stimulation and decreased thereafter. Pretreatment of cells with AMD3100, a specific CXCR4 inhibitor (27Donzella G.A. Schols D. Lin S.W. Este J.A. Nagashima K.A. Maddon P.J. Allaway G.P. Sakmar T.P. Henson G. De Clercq E. Moore J.P. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar), prevented the phosphorylation of ERK when provoked by SDF-1 (Fig. 1B), thus together demonstrating that Jurkat cells express functional CXCR4 receptors. We next evaluated whether SDF-1 could induce the migration of Jurkat cells using a modified Boyden Chamber system in which cell migration can be easily quantified using a luciferase-based assay. Using this system, we observed that Jurkat cells migrate efficiently toward wells containing various concentrations of SDF-1, reaching a maximum already at a concentration of 10 ng/ml of this chemoattractant (Fig. 1C). The treatment with AMD3100 prevented the SDF-1-induced cell migration in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1D). These data indicated that SDF-1 can induce a remarkable migratory response in Jurkat cells through CXCR4.Gi and Gβγ Are Involved in the Migration of Jurkat Cells Induced by SDF-1—PTX, which ADP ribosylates Gαi, thereby uncoupling it from receptor activation (28Ui M. Katada T. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1990; 24: 63-69PubMed Google Scholar), was used to investigate the role of Gi in the process of cell migration stimulated by SDF-1. The effect of PTX on the phosphorylation of ERK was used as positive control. Treatment of Jurkat cells with PTX resulted in a decrease of phosphorylation of ERK and cell migration in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 2, A and B). This confirmed that Gi participates in the migratory response initiated by CXCR4. As receptor stimulation of Gi induces the dissociation of Gβγ subunits from GTP-bound Gi (29Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar), we next evaluated the contribution of Gβγ to SDF-1-induced cell migration by the overexpression of Gα transducin, which blocks Gβγ function by quenching these G protein subunits upon their release from Gi (20Crespo P. Xu N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Indeed, expression of Gα transducin in Jurkat cells (Fig. 2C) prevented the phosphorylation of ERK induced by SDF-1 (Fig. 2D). In contrast, the phosphorylation of ERK elicited by PMA through protein kinase C (30Ueda Y. Hirai S. Osada S. Suzuki A. Mizuno K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23512-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) remained unaffected and served as a negative control (Fig. 2D). Gα transducin expression resulted in a dramatic inhibition of the migratory response toward SDF-1 (Fig. 2E), thus indicating that Gβγ subunits, when released from Gi, are involved in SDF-1-induced cell migration through CXCR4.FIGURE 2PTX-sensitive G proteins of the Gi family are required for SDF-1-induced migration of Jurkat T-cells. A role for Gβγ subunits. A, PTX inhibits the phosphorylation of ERK stimulated by SDF-1. Jurkat cells pretreated overnight with serum-free medium with or without different concentrations of PTX were stimulated with SDF-1 (10 ng/ml) for 5 min. Cells were lysed and used for Western blot analysis of phosphorylated and total ERK. B, PTX blocks the migration of Jurkat cells evoked by SDF-1. After incubating with different concentrations of PTX overnight, Jurkat cells were suspended in serum-free growth medium and added into the upper wells of the Boyden chambers. Serum-free growth medium with or without SDF-1 (10 ng/ml) was loaded into the lower wells as chemoattractant. Data are represented as in Fig. 1C. C, expression of transducin in Jurkat cells. Control and transducin (Gαt)-transfected Jurkat cells were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies to transducin or α-tubulin as a control. D, expression of transducin decreases the phosphorylation of ERK induced by SDF-1. Jurkat cells were transfected with transducin, serum starved overnight, and lysed after stimulating with SDF-1 (10 ng/ml) or PMA (50 nm) for 5 min. Western blot analysis of ERK phosphorylation was performed as above. E, transducin inhibits the migration of Jurkat cells induced by SDF-1. Jurkat cells transfected with different concentrations of transducin were subjected to migration assays using SDF-1 as the chemoattractant as described above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Signaling through Gi Promotes the Migration of Jurkat Cells by Stimulating Rac—Because the small GTP-binding protein Rac plays a central role in the regulation of the actin-based cytoskeleton and cell movement (31Bar-Sagi D. Hall A. Cell. 2000; 103: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar), we then investigated whether this Rho-related GTPase is involved in the Gi-mediated migration of Jurkat cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, by a pulldown assay we observed that stimulation of Jurkat cells with SDF-1 provoked the rapid accumulation of GTP-bound Rac, which reached a maximum at ∼5 min. In parallel experiments, however, we did not detect the accumulation of the GTP-bound form of Cdc42, a Rac-related GTPase (not shown). Pretreatment of Jurkat cells with PTX attenuated the Rac activity induced by SDF-1 (Fig. 3B). These data indicate that SDF-1 induces Rac activation through PTX-sensitive G proteins of the Gi class. We next set out to explore whether Rac is necessary for the migratory response to SDF-1 by expressing in Jurkat cells the N-terminal region of PAK (p21-activated kinase), PAK-N, which includes its Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding motif, and PAK-NL2, which lacks two residues required for Rac binding and therefore serves as a specificity control (21Montaner S. Sodhi A. Servitja J.M. Ramsdell A.K. Barac A. Sawai E.T. Gutkind J.S. Blood. 2004; 104: 2903-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Fig. 3C shows the expression of the AU1-tagged forms of both PAK-N and PAK-NL2 after transfection of their expression vectors into Jurkat cells. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 3D, expression of PAK-N dramatically reduced the migration of Jurkat cells induced by SDF-1, whereas PAK-NL2 did not exert any demonstrable effect (Fig. 3D). Collectively, our results suggest that Gi participates in the SDF-1-induced migration of Jurkat cells by stimulating the activity of Rac, likely through Gβγ subunits.FIGURE 3SDF-1 induces cell migration and Rac activation through Gi. A, time course of the activation of Rac stimulated by SDF-1. Serum-starved Jurkat cells were stimulated with SDF-1 (10 ng/ml) for different times, and the GTP-bound form of Rac (GTP-Rac) was assessed in cellular lysates by pulldown assays. Western blot analysis of total Rac in each cell lysate was used as a control. B, PTX inhibits the activation of Rac induced by SDF-1. Jurkat cells were cultured overnight in serum-free growth medium with or without different concentrations of PTX and stimulated with SDF-1 (10 ng/ml) for 5 min. Cell lysates were used for pulldown analysis of GTP-bound Rac as above. C, expression of the AU1-tagged forms of PAK-N (PAKN) and PAK-NL2 (PAKL2) in Jurkat cells. Jurkat cells transfected with PAK-N and PAK-NL2 expression vectors were lysed for Western blot analysis with antibodies to the AU1 epitope or α-tubulin as a control. D, inhibition of Rac leads to a decrease in Jurkat cell migration induced by SDF-1. Jurkat cells were transfected by PAK-N and the control construct PAK-NL2, and migration assays toward SDF-1 were performed as described above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Rho Is Involved in Cell Migration Induced by SDF-1 through CXCR4—As cell migration often requires the coordinated activation of the small GTPases Rac and Rho, we next sought to explore whether Rho plays a role in the chemotactic response to SDF-1. We first examined whether SDF-1 promotes the activation of Rho. As shown in Fig. 4A, SDF-1 stimulation provoked a profound activation of Rho, as judged by the use of pulldown assays. To address whether Rho is involved in cell migration stimulated by SDF-1, we used both treatment with C3 toxin, by which ADP ribosylates and inhibits Rho (32Kikuchi A. Yamamoto K. Fujita T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16303-16308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the expression of an AU5-tagged negative dominant mutant of Rho, Rho N19. Treatment with C3 toxin from 0.1-5 ng/ml inhibited the migration of Jurkat cells toward wells containing SDF-1 (Fig. 4B). Similarly, the expression of the AU5-tagged form of Rho N19 in Jurkat cells (Fig. 4C) dramatically reduced the migration of these cells when induced by SDF-1 (Fig. 4D), while in control experiments the dominant negative mutant of Rac, but not of Cdc42, also prevented Jurkat cell migration (not shown). These data demonstrate that SDF-1 can activate Rho and that in turn Rho is involved in cell migration induced by this potent chemokine. To further investigate whether Rho activation in response to SDF-1 is indeed mediated through CXCR4, we limited the expression of this GPCR by RNA-interfering approaches (Fig. 4E). Our data showed that the knock down of the expression of CXCR4 in Jurkat cells resulted in a reduction in the ability of SDF-1 to promote both Rho activation and migration (Fig. 4, F and G).FIGURE 4Rho is involved in SDF-1-stimulated cell migration. A, time course of Rho activation induced by SDF-1. Jurkat cells were serum starved overnight and stimulated with SDF-1 (10 ng/ml) for the indicated times. Rho activity was assessed in cell lysates by pulldown analysis of GTP-bound Rho. Total Rho in each cell lysate was determined as a control. B, treatment with C3 toxin inhibits the migration of Jurkat cells. Jurkat cells were transfected with various concentrations of a C3 toxin expression vector, and their migration to wells containing SDF-1 (10 ng/ml) was assayed as described above. C, expression of RhoN19 in Jurkat cells. Jurkat cells were transfected with AU5-tagged RhoN19, and Western blot analysis was performed in total cell lysates using antibodies to the AU5 epitope or α-tubulin. D, inhibition of Rho prevents Jurkat cell migration induced by SDF-1. Jurkat cells were transfected with RhoN19 and used for migration assays toward SDF-1 (10 ng/ml) as above. E, knock down of the expression of CXCR4 by RNA-interfering approach. After infection with lentivirus-GFP (control shRNA) or lentivirus-CXCR4 shRNA, Jurkat cells were analyzed for CXCR4 expression by fluorescence-activated cell sorter. F, knock down of the expression of CXCR4 diminished ERK phosphorylation and Rho activation in response to SDF-1. Jurkat cells infected with lentivirus-GFP (GFP) or lentivirus-CXCR4shRNA were serum starved overnight and used for ERK and Rho activation by Western blot analysis and Rho pulldown assays as above. G, CXCR4 knock down decreased Jurkat cell migration induced by SDF-1. Cells infected with the indicated lentiviruses were used for migration assays in response to SDF-1 as above. H and I, the Rho effector Rho kinase participates in Jurkat cell migration promoted by SDF-1. Pretreatment of Jurkat cells with the indicated concentrations of the Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 suppressed the phosphorylation of the MLC (H) and the migration of the Jurkat cells in response to SDF-1 (I).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image"
https://openalex.org/W1971215002,"We used fluorescent probes and EPR to study the mechanism(s) underlying reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by endothelial cell mitochondria and the action of mitoquinol, a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant. ROS measured by fluorescence resulted from complex I superoxide released to the matrix and converted to H2O2. In contrast, EPR largely detected superoxide generated at complex III and effluxed outward. ROS fluorescence by mitochondria fueled by the complex II substrate, succinate, was substantial but markedly inhibited by rotenone. Superoxide, detected by EPR, in succinate-fueled mitochondria was not inhibited by rotenone and likely derived from semiquinone formation at complex III. Mitoquinol decreased H2O2 fluorescence by succinate-fueled mitochondria but had little effect on the EPR signal for superoxide. This was not associated with a detectable decrease in membrane potential. Mitoquinol markedly enhanced ROS fluorescence in mitochondria fueled by the complex I substrates, glutamate and malate. Inhibitor studies suggested that this occurred in complex I, at one or more Q binding pockets. The above effects of mitoquinol were determined in mitochondria isolated and subsequently exposed to the targeted antioxidant. However, similar effects were observed in mitochondria after antecedent exposure to mitoquinol/mitoquinone in culture, suggesting that the agent is retained after isolation of the organelles. In conclusion, ROS production in bovine aortic endothelial cell mitochondria results largely from reverse transport to complex I and through the Q cycle in complex III. Mitoquinol blocks ROS from reverse electron transport but increases superoxide production derived from forward transport. These effects likely occur at one or more Q binding sites in complex I.

Moreover, mitochondrial oxidative damage may underlie problems, including the vascular and neurologic complications of diabetes, cell damage in degenerative diseases, and aging (5Brand M.D. Buckingham J.A. Esteves T.C. Green K. Lambert A.J. Miwa S. Murphy M.P. Pakay J.L. Talbot D.A. Echtay K.S. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2004; 71: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 6Nishikawa T. Edelstein D.

Reactive oxygen derived from endothelial cell mitochondria has also been implicated in the metabolic pathways leading to the microvascular complications of diabetes (6Nishikawa T. Edelstein D. Du X.L. Yamagishi S. Matsumura T. Kaneda Y. Yorek M.A. Beebe D. Oates P.J. Hammes H.P. Giardino I. Brownlee M. Nature. 2000; 404: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial electron transport generates substantial amounts of superoxide derived from electron leaks as substrates are metabolized (10Skulachev V.P. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1996; 29: 169-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The process may have adverse consequences as evidenced by observations in mice lacking the mitochondrial enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase. These mice develop dilated cardiomyopathy and live less than 2 weeks (11Li Y. Huang T.T. Carlson E.J. Melov S. Ursell P.C. Olson J.L. Nobile L.J. Yoshimura M.P. Berger C. Chan P.H. Wallace D.C. Epstein C.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1455) Google Scholar). The major sites of superoxide production have been somewhat controversial, but there is evidence that most derive from complexes I and III (12Raha S. Robinson B.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 502-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that complex I superoxide is released exclusively to the matrix side of the inner membrane, whereas complex III likely generates superoxide to both the matrix and intermembrane space (13St-Pierre J.

J. 2001; 353: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). The likely role of ROS in human disease has led to efforts at prevention through antioxidant therapy. However, the therapeutic use of antioxidants in vivo, particularly in human studies directed at vascular events, has been disappointing (16Yorek M.A. Free Radic. Res. 2003; 37: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Possible reasons for this include inadequate dosing due to concerns over toxicity and inability to deliver agents to target sites of ROS production. Hence, efforts are underway to develop effective antioxidant compounds targeted to mitochondria. One approach to this involves the synthesis of compounds linking agents such as redox forms of Q compounds (ubiquinol and ubiquinone) or vitamin E to compounds like triphenylphosphonium, a lipophilic cation avidly taken up into the relatively negative mitochondrial matrix (17Smith R.A. Porteous C.M. Coulter C.V. Murphy M.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 709-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 18Kelso G.F. Porteous C.M. Coulter C.V. Hughes G. Porteous W.K. Ledgerwood E.C. Smith R.A. Murphy M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4588-4596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). In fact, we and several others have used the tetraphenylphosphonium ion to measure mitochondrial membrane potential (19Fink B.D. Hong Y.S. Mathahs M.M. Scholz T.D. Dillon J.S. Sivitz W.I. J. Biol.

One such compound, an alkyltriphenylphosphonium cation, termed mitoQ (mitoquinol or mitoquinone or a mixture of these redox forms), consists of compound Q covalently bound to the cation triphenylphosphonium. By virtue of its delocalized positive charge, mitoQ accumulates several hundredfold in mitochondria (18Kelso G.F. Porteous C.M. Coulter C.V. Hughes G. Porteous W.K. Ledgerwood E.C. Smith R.A.

Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47129-47135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Although mitoQ appears to have protective effects in certain cell types, the mechanism of action is not well defined and appears complex. A major action may be to decrease lipid peroxidation by virtue of the quinol moiety acting as a chain-breaking antioxidant (23James A.M. Smith R.A. Murphy M.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 423: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Mitochondria-targeted antioxidants protected Friedreich ataxia fibroblasts, in which glutathione synthesis was blocked, from oxidative stress (24Jauslin M.L. Meier T. Smith R.A. Murphy M.P. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1972-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and mitoQ reduced telomere shortening in fibroblasts exposed to oxidative stress (25Saretzki G. Murphy M.P. von Zglinicki T. Aging Cell. 2003; 2: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In bovine aortic endothelial (BAE) cells, mitoQ reduced oxidative damage in cells stressed by 25 mm glucose and glucose oxidase (26Dhanasekaran A. Kotamraju S. Kalivendi S.V. Matsunaga T. Shang T. Keszler A. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37575-37587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Moreover, mitoQ also reduced ROS and ERK2 activation in endothelial cells after hypoxic stress (27Schafer M. Schafer C. Ewald N. Piper H.M. Noll T. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 1010-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). There is currently no information concerning the mitochondrial sites of ROS production or about the effects of mitochondria-targeted antioxidants in mitochondria of vascular cells. There is also no information concerning the effects of these targeted compounds in mitochondria isolated from cells subject to prior antioxidant treatment in culture. To better understand the mechanism(s) and site(s) of ROS production by endothelial mitochondria we examined ROS production under different substrate and inhibitor conditions. We assessed ROS in two ways; as fluorescence produced by hydrogen peroxide and as superoxide specifically determined by EPR. As our data will show, these two methods differ in regards to what they measure. To learn more of the action of targeted quinols/quinones in endothelial mitochondria, we examined ROS production upon addition of these compounds directly to mitochondria as well as after antecedent exposure of BAE cells to these compounds in culture. Control compounds included non-targeted ubiquinone and decyltriphenylphosphonium (dTPP), which is identical to mitoquinone and mitoquinol but lacks the quinone/quinol group (28James A.M. Cocheme H.M. Smith R.A. Murphy M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21295-21312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Reagents and Supplies—Mitoquinone and mitoquinol were synthesized from commercially available 11-bromoundecanoic acid and 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone as described previously (18Kelso G.F. Porteous C.M. Coulter C.V. Hughes G. Porteous W.K. Ledgerwood E.C. Smith R.A. Murphy M.P. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 571: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Other reagents, kits, and supplies were as specified or purchased from standard sources. Animals—Animals were fed and maintained according to standard National Institutes of Health guidelines, and the protocol was approved by our institutional Animal Care Committee. Normal C57Bl/6 mice (age 99 ± 19 days, 8 males and 2 females) were sacrificed by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital followed by cardiac puncture to obtain hind limb muscle tissue for preparation of mitochondria. Cell Culture—BAE cells were grown in medium M199 (Invitrogen) supplemented with minimal essential medium amino acids (Invitrogen), penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), minimal essential medium vitamins (Sigma), and 20% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) as described (29Moser D.R. Lowe Jr., W.L. Dake B.L. Booth B.A. Boes M. Clemmons D.R. Bar R.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1805-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to near confluence in 150-cm2 flasks between passages 6 and 12. For experiments involving mitochondria-targeted antioxidants administered to intact cells, 1 μm concentrations of mitoquinone, mitoquinol, ubiquinone, dTPP, or methyltriphenylphosphonium (mTPP), or vehicle (ethanol) were then added, and the cells incubated for 24 h before isolation of mitochondria. Isolation of Mitochondria—Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped. Collected cells were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer in ice-cold homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2) with 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. For muscle mitochondria, the tissue was minced and processed using a Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder and subsequently by a ground glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was centrifuged again at 10,000 × g for 10 min to obtain the mitochondrial pellet. The resulting pellet was then washed three times in homogenization buffer without bovine serum albumin and resuspended in media as described below. Protein was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Mitochondria prepared in this way were of good quality as documented by an increase in respiratory rate of 4- to 6-fold after addition of carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP) as an uncoupler. Mitochondrial Hydrogen Peroxide—Mitochondria were studied during state 4 respiration, under which circumstance oxygen radical formation is enhanced as electron flow leads to high potential unmitigated by ATP generation (30Boss O. Hagen T. Lowell B.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). H2O2 production was assessed using the fluorescent probes Amplex Red (Invitrogen) and 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF, H2DCF-DA, Invitrogen) using a Fluostar Optima fluorescence spectrophotometer (BMG Labtechnologies, Inc., Durham, NC) at 37 °C with filter wavelengths of 544 nm absorbance and 590 nm emission. Samples were prepared in 96-well plates containing 0.06 ml per well of respiratory buffer (220 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 2.5 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 with 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 2 μm oligomycin) plus 20 μm Amplex Red or DCF, 5 units/ml horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) and mitochondria at a concentration of 0.05–0.1 mg/ml. When DCF was included, the compound was subject to chemical hydrolysis of the diacetate groups by exposure to 0.2 m KOH for 1 h before use. Fluorescence in all wells was measured in relative units once every 44 s (one cycle) and carried out for 50 cycles. For quantification, a hydrogen peroxide standard curve ranging from 0 to 12 μm was prepared in respiratory buffer and included on each plate. Addition of catalase, 500 units/ml, to incubations performed under the conditions studied reduced fluorescence to below the detectable limit indicating specificity for H2O2. Mitochondria Superoxide Generation—As in the case of fluorescence detection, mitochondria were studied during state 4 respiration. EPR spectra were recorded using a Bruker EMX EPR spectrometer operating in X band and equipped with a high sensitivity resonator ER 4119HS. Samples were prepared at room temperature in 0.3 ml of respiratory buffer with 0.0688 m 5,5-dimethyl-l-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO), and 0.12 mg of isolated mitochondria. Respiration was initiated with the addition of substrate (succinate or glutamate plus malate), and samples were preincubated for 5 min in a 37 °C water bath. Reactions were transferred to a flat aqueous EPR cell, and the spectra were recorded at room temperature using the following instrument settings: microwave power 40 milliwatt, modulation amplitude 2 G, receiver gain 2 × 105, conversion time 40.96 ms, time constant 81.92 ms, and scan rate 80G/41.92 s. Spectra shown are the average of 7–10 scans. Oxygen Utilization and Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—The rate of respiration of isolated mitochondria (0.2–0.4 mg of protein/ml) was determined as we previously described (19Fink B.D. Hong Y.S.

Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Concurrently, we assessed mitochondrial inner membrane potential based on the distribution (inside and external to the mitochondrial matrix), of the lipophilic cation triphenylphosphonium (TPP+) as we previously described (19Fink B.D.

To determine the concentration of TPP+ inside the mitochondrial matrix, it is necessary to know the mitochondrial matrix volume and the extent to which TPP+ is bound to mitochondrial protein as opposed to freely present within the matrix. Mitochondrial matrix volumes and the TPP+ binding correction, under the conditions of incubation, were determined as we have previously reported (20Fink B.D. Reszka K.J. Herlein J.A. Mathahs M.M. Sivitz W.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: E71-E79Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Kinetic Relationship of Proton Flux to Membrane Potential—The relationship of H+ flux to mitochondrial membrane potential (kinetics of the proton leak) has been considered an optimal assessment of mitochondrial uncoupling (32Porter R.K. Joyce O.J. Farmer M.K. Heneghan R. Tipton K.F. Andrews J.F. McBennett S.M. Lund M.D. Jensen C.H. Melia H.P. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab.

This was accomplished through simultaneous recording of oxygen consumption and potential as we have previously carried out using electrodes sensitive to oxygen and to the distribution of the tetraphenylphosphonium ion (TPP+) (19Fink B.D.

Mitochondria were incubated in respiratory buffer plus 5-μm rotenone to inhibit electron entry at Complex-I, and 0.1-μm nigericin to abolish the ΔpH (34Lionetti L. Iossa S. Liverini G. Brand M.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 352: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) across the mitochondrial membrane. H+ flux, under these conditions, is proton leak-dependent and, with succinate as fuel, follows a 6:1 stoichiometry (H+/O) with oxygen consumed (32Porter R.K. Joyce O.J. Farmer M.K. Heneghan R. Tipton K.F. Andrews J.F. McBennett S.M. Lund M.D. Jensen C.H. Melia H.P. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 1999; 23: S12-S18Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 35Nicholls D.G. Biosci.

Succinate (5 mm) was added followed by malonate in incremental amounts to final concentrations of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mm to inhibit succinate dehydrogenase, thereby decreasing electrons available for the transport system and creating a range of membrane potentials (38Brand M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1018: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Measurement of Membrane Potential by Isotopic Assessment of TPP+ Distribution—Reaction tubes contained 40 μg of mitochondria, 2 μm oligomycin, 6 μm tetraphenylphosphonium chloride, and 40 nm tetra[3H]phenylphosphonium bromide (1.4 μCi/ml) in a volume of 100 μl of respiration medium plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The microcentrifuge tubes were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in the presence of 5 mm succinate or 5 mm succinate plus 2.5 μm FCCP. The tubes were then centrifuged at room temperature for 4 min at 10,000 × g. 90 μl of each supernatant was removed for liquid scintillation counting. Succinate-driven mitochondrial TPP+ uptake was assessed as the difference in counts recovered between the succinate plus FCCP supernatant and the succinate alone supernatant. Potential was then calculated based on the Nernst equation. Each individual assay was carried out in duplicate, and mean values were determined. Measurement of Complex I (NADH-Ubiquinone Oxidoreductase) Activity in BAE Cell Mitochondria—Activity was determined as described previously (39Birch-Machin M.A. Briggs H.L. Saborido A.A. Bindoff L.A. Turnbull D.M. Biochem. Med. Metab. Biol. 1994; 51: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) by following the decrease in absorbance due to NADH oxidation at 340 nm. Activity was measured for 5 min in the presence of excess NADH and ubiquinone. Mitochondria were freeze-thawed three times to disrupt membranes and to release activity. Statistics—Differences between groups were determined by analysis of variance or t test with correction for multiple groups using commercial software (GraphPad Prism, GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). H2O2 Production from Isolated BAE Cell Mitochondria Assessed by Fluorescence—H2O2 was assessed as relative Amplex Red (Fig. 1A) or DCF (Fig. 1B) fluorescence in mitochondria isolated from BAE cells and fueled by succinate, a complex II substrate. Using either fluorescence probe, ROS production was markedly inhibited by the complex I inhibitor rotenone. Addition of the complex III inhibitor, antimycin A, mildly decreased ROS as assessed in this manner. H2O2 production in succinate-fueled mitochondria was compared with that in the presence on the complex I substrates, glutamate plus malate (Fig. 1C). In this case H2O2 was quantified in molar terms based on fluorescence of Amplex Red in the presence of a standard curve. H2O2 production was much less in the presence of the complex I substrates. Rotenone did not alter H2O2 production in this circumstance. The experiments in Fig. 1C were also carried out in mouse hind limb muscle mitochondria (Fig. 1D). Succinate-driven H2O2 production was greater in muscle mitochondria. In contrast, relatively little H2O2 was generated by glutamate/malate-fueled mitochondria unless rotenone was added. There was minimal nonspecific fluorescence due to rotenone or antimycin A. Addition of these compounds to respiratory buffer without mitochondria or with mitochondria in the absence of substrate altered fluorescence only ∼5%, and correction for this effect would not reduce the significance of the differences observed. Superoxide Production from Isolated BAE Cell Mitochondria Assessed by EPR Spectroscopy—H2O2 production as measured by our fluorescence probes (see above) should derive largely from matrix superoxide released at complex I and converted to H2O2 by matrix superoxide dismutase (SOD) (13St-Pierre J. Buckingham J.A. Roebuck S.J. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44784-44790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). Superoxide, effluxed outward to the cytoplasmic side, should not be detected by our fluorescence probes unless converted to H2O2 by exogenous SOD, which was not present in the incubation medium. On the other hand, superoxide effluxed directly outward should be detectable by EPR spectroscopy. Superoxide was quantitatively assessed by EPR as the decay product of the superoxide-DMPO adduct, DMPO/·OOH, which rapidly and spontaneously decays to the hydroxyl radical adduct DMPO/·OH (40Zwicker K. Dikalov S. Matuschka S. Mainka L. Hofmann M. Khramtsov V. Zimmer G. Arzneimittelforschung. 1998; 48: 629-636PubMed Google Scholar). Representative EPR spectra (Fig. 2) are those of DMPO/·OH adducts as determined based on their characteristic splitting pattern (four lines of intensity 1:2:2:1) and hyperfine splitting constants aN = 14.9 G and aβH = 14.9 G. These DMPO/·OH spectra could possibly arise directly from the hydroxyl radical rather than the rapid decay of the superoxide adduct, DMPO/·OOH. However, addition of SOD abolished the spectra (Fig. 2) indicating that formation of DMPO/·OH was entirely mediated by the superoxide radical. Fig. 2 reveals marked differences in reactive oxygen as assessed by EPR measurement of superoxide compared with fluorescence measurement of H2O2. As shown in Fig. 2, succinate-fueled mitochondria generated superoxide substantially above that in the absence of substrate, but, as opposed to fluorescent detection of H2O2 (Fig. 1), there was no inhibition by rotenone. Moreover, whereas antimycin A markedly increased the EPR signal (Fig. 2F), antimycin decreased H2O2 by fluorescence (Fig. 1). The spectra shown in Fig. 2 are representative of at least five repetitions for each condition studied (see below). Effects of Mitochondria-targeted Antioxidant Compounds Added to Isolated BAE Mitochondria on H2O2 Production Detected by Fluorescence—ROS were assessed both as H2O2 fluorescence and as superoxide by EPR. Fig. 3A shows that mitoquinol and mitoquinone reduced H2O2 production by succinate-fueled mitochondria. The non-targeted compound, ubiquinone, had no effect. Fig. 3B shows that, in sharp contrast to the effect of mitoquinol in succinate-fueled mitochondria, mitoquinol markedly increased H2O2 production by mitochondria fueled by the complex I substrates, glutamate and malate. When added to mitochondria in the absence of substrate mitoquinol, mitoquinone, dTPP, and ubiquinone, all increased Amplex Red fluorescence, but by <10% of that observed in succinate-fueled mitochondria. Moreover, there was essentially no difference between the effects of the individual compounds, and therefore, nonspecific fluorescence cannot account for the observed differences between these compounds in the presence of substrate. Data from a subsequent series of experiments (Fig. 4) confirm the effect of mitoquinol in glutamate/malate-fueled mitochondria and include non-targeted ubiquinone and dTPP as controls, neither of which shared the effect of mitoquinol. Mitoquinone, the oxidized form of mitoQ, had similar but lesser effects than mitoquinol. As seen in Fig. 4, we also examined the effect of two inhibitors of electron transfer upon ROS generation triggered by mitoquinol and mitoquinone. Stigmatellin inhibits electron transfer at the QP center near the outer face of complex III where electrons from reduced ubiquinone are accepted. This agent markedly reduced the effect of mitoquinol and mitoquinone on ROS production. Rotenone, a Q site inhibitor in complex I, likewise reduced the effect of mitoquinol and mitoquinone on ROS but to a lesser extent than stigmatellin. Stigmatellin, more than rotenone, induced nonspecific fluorescence. When added to mitochondria in the absence of substrate, fluorescence increased ∼40%. Therefore, the data in Fig. 2 were corrected for nonspecific fluorescence by subtracting out the effect of stigmatellin and rotenone on fluorescence by mitochondria in the absence of substrate. The effect of the complex I inhibitor, rotenone, to decrease H2O2 fluorescence by"

However, the regulation of chemokine receptor signaling under physiological and pathological conditions is not fully understood. In the present study, we demonstrate that the CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) formed a complex with ferritin heavy chain (FHC) in a ligand-dependent manner. Our in vitro binding assays revealed that purified FHC associated with both the glutathione S-transferase-conjugated N-terminal and C-terminal domains of CXCR4, thereby suggesting the presence of more than one FHC binding site in the protein sequence of CXCR4. Using confocal microscopy, we observed that stimulation with CXCL12, the receptor ligand, induced colocalization of the internalized CXCR4 with FHC into internal vesicles. Furthermore, after CXCL12 treatment, FHC underwent time-dependent nuclear translocation and phosphorylation at serine residues. By contrast, a mutant form of FHC in which serine 178 was replaced by alanine (S178A) failed to undergo phosphorylation, suggesting that serine 178 is the major phosphorylation site. Compared with the wild type FHC, the FHC-S178A mutant exhibited reduced association with CXCR4 and constitutive nuclear translocation. We also found that CXCR4-mediated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activation and chemotaxis were inhibited by overexpression of wild type FHC but not FHC-S178A mutant, and were prolonged by FHC knockdown. In addition to CXCR4, other chemokine receptor-initiated signaling appeared to be similarly regulated by FHC, because CXCR2-mediated ERK1/2 activation was also inhibited by FHC overexpression and prolonged by FHC knockdown. Altogether, our data provide strong evidence for an important role of FHC in chemokine receptor signaling and receptor-mediated cell migration.

VOLUME 281 (2006) PAGES 37616-37627Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 282Issue 17PreviewPAGE 37616: Full-Text PDF Open Access Chemokines comprise a large family of low molecular mass (8-10 kDa) proteins with chemotactic and proactivatory effects on different leukocyte lineages. Approximately 40 chemokines have been identified and several studies have established their central role in a number of physiological situations, including T helper cell responses, hematopoiesis, homeostasis, and angiogenesis (1Mackay C.R. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Chemokines mediate their biological effects by binding to specific seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor subtypes, designated CXCR1 through CXCR6, CCR1 through CCR11, XCR1, and CX3CR1, based on their specific preference for certain chemokines (2Liao F.

Whereas the mechanisms by which alterations of chemokine receptor signaling in the above pathological conditions remain largely unknown. Ferritin is a ubiquitous and highly conserved iron-binding protein. Cytosolic ferritin is composed of two types of subunits, termed heavy chain (FHC) and light chain (FLC) that assemble together to form a 24-subunit protein. FLC contributes to the nucleation of the iron core, whereas FHC possesses a ferroxidase activity that catalyzes the oxidation of iron into a ferrihydrite mineral core in the center of the protein (22Lawson D.M.

Perturbations in cellular FHC are emerging as an important element in the pathogenesis of disease. These changes in FHC are important not only in the classic diseases of iron acquisition, transport, and storage, but also in diseases characterized by inflammation, infection, injury, and repair. Among these are most common diseases such as Parkinson disease (23Linert W. Jameson G.N. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 79: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), Alzheimer disease (24Kondo T.

In cellular models, FHC is induced by inflammatory cytokines (29Torti S.V. Kwak E.L. Miller S.C. Miller L.L. Ringold G.M. Myambo K.B. Young A.P. Torti F.M. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The transcription factor, nuclear factor-κB, plays a critical role in the transcriptional regulation of FHC (33Pham C.G. Bubici C. Zazzeroni F. Papa S. Jones J. Alvarez K. Jayawardena S. De Smaele E. Cong R. Beaumont C. Torti F.M. Torti S.V. Franzoso G. Cell. 2004; 119: 529-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). A recent study demonstrated that overexpression of FHC inhibited tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-induced sustained JNK activation and, thereby, apoptosis triggered by TNFα (33Pham C.G. Bubici C. Zazzeroni F. Papa S. Jones J. Alvarez K. Jayawardena S. De Smaele E. Cong R. Beaumont C. Torti F.M. Torti S.V. Franzoso G. Cell. 2004; 119: 529-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). This suggested an involvement of FHC in the signal transduction initiated by TNFα. Although FHC is involved in a number of diseases in which chemokines and their receptors are dysregulated, the potential role of this protein in chemokine receptor signaling has not been addressed. In the present study, we demonstrate that FHC formed a complex with CXCR4 in vivo and in vitro. CXCL12 stimulation of CXCR4 expressing cells induced FHC phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Moreover, CXCL12-initiated ERK1/2 activation and chemotaxis were inhibited by FHC overexpression and were enhanced by FHC knockdown. Plasmids—Plasmids encoding Myc-CXCR4, HA-CXCR4, and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-conjugated CXCR4 C terminus were obtained from Dr. Gang Pei (Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences). For the construction of CXCR4 into pRC/CMV vector, the cDNA of CXCR4 was amplified by PCR from HA-CXCR4 and the amplified fragment was inserted into the HindIII site of the pRC/CMV vector. For the construction of FHC in pcDNA3.1, the cDNA of FHC was amplified by PCR from the cDNA library of HEK293 cells. The amplified product was inserted into BamHI and XbaI sites of pcDNA3.1. The GST-conjugated CXCR4 N terminus was constructed by amplifying the receptor N-terminal fragment (1-32 amino acid) using PCR and insertion of this fragment into the BamHI and XbaI sites of the pGEX/KG vector. Two specific FHC siRNAs, FHC siRNA-1 and siRNA-2, were used for this study. FHC siRNA-1 targeting at the first 29 nucleotides from the start codon was obtained from Dr. Paolo Arosio (aDipartimento Materno Infantile e Tecnologie Biomediche, Università di Brescia, A.O. Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy) (34Cozzi A. Corsi B. Levi S. Santambrogio P. Biasiotto G. Arosio P. Blood. 2004; 103: 2377-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The FHC siRNA-2, which is a pool of three target-specific 20-25-nucleotide siRNAs (sc-40575), and a control siRNA (sc-37007) consisting of a scrambled sequence that will not lead to the specific degradation of any cellular message, were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Mutagenesis of specific FHC serine 178 to alanine (S178A) was conducted by PCR-directed mutagenesis. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing 10% fetal bovine serum and a 1:100 dilution of penicillin/streptomycin, at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with plasmids encoding CXCR2, CXCR4, or FHC using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen). HEK293 cells stably expressing CXCR4 or CXCR2 were selected with 560 μg/ml Geneticin and evaluated for receptor expression by radioligand binding assay using 125I-CXCL12 or 125I-CXCL8, respectively. Jurkat T cells were grown in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and a 1:100 dilution of penicillin/streptomycin, at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. For transient transfection of FHC constructs, 20 × 106 cells were electroporated with 20 μg of DNA, in 0.4 ml of preheated (37 °C) RPMI 1640 containing 10 nm dextrose and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, using Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad), and a setting of 234 V and 1000 microfarads, using a 0.4-cm preheated cuvette (Bio-Rad). Transfected cells were resuspended in growth medium and used for experiments 16-24 h after transfection. In Vitro Binding Assay—The GST or GST-CXCR4 C terminus fusion protein or GST-CXCR4 N terminus fusion protein were purified from the bacteria strain DH5α transformed with plasmids encoding the above proteins. Briefly, after incubation of the Escherichia coli at 37 °C for 12 h, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added and incubation was continued for another 3 h to induce protein expression. The bacteria were lysed in RIPA buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg each of leupeptin and aprotinin) and then sonicated on ice for 10 s. The supernatant of the bacterial lysate was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose at 4 °C for 30 min. After washing three times with RIPA buffer, the purified GST- or GST fusion protein-bound beads were resuspended in RIPA buffer. The His-tagged FHC fusion proteins were purified from bacteria strain DH5α transformed with plasmids encoding His-FHC. Briefly, E. coli were cultured 37 °C for 12 h, then isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added and incubation was continued for another 3 h to induce protein expression. The bacteria were resuspended in TMP buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and then sonicated. The supernatant of the bacterial lysate was applied to equilibrated nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose by gravity flow, and His-FHC was eluted with elution buffer containing TMP and 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm imidazole, and 10% glycerol. For the in vitro binding assay, aliquots of the glutathione-Sepharose bound GST or GST fusion proteins were incubated with equal amounts of His-FHC fusion proteins at 4 °C for 2 h with rotation. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 2 min), and washed four times with RIPA buffer. Bound proteins were released by boiling in loading buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol for 5 min and detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Confocal Microscopy—HeLa cells grown on coverslips were transfected with plasmids encoding Myc-CXCR4. Cells were treated with carrier buffer or CXCL12 for various time intervals and fixed with methanol. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with an antibody mixture containing an anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and a rabbit polyclonal anti-FHC antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 30 min. Cells were washed and incubated with a secondary antibody mixture containing a Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and a FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes) for 30 min. After the immunostaining, the cells were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 to visualize nuclei. Confocal microscopy was performed on a LSM-510 laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) with a 63 × 1.3 numerical aperture oil immersion lens using dual excitation (488 nm for FITC, 568 nm for Cy3) and emission (515-540 nm for FITC, 590-610 nm for Cy3) filter sets. All digital images were captured at the same settings to allow direct quantitative comparison of staining patterns. Final images were processed using Adobe Photoshop software. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—HEK293 cells stably expressing Myc-CXCR4 were treated with carrier buffer (control) or CXCL12 (10 nm) for the indicated time intervals, washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 1 ml of RIPA buffer. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 15 min). The supernatant was precleared by incubation with 40 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Pierce) for 1 h at 4 °C to reduce nonspecific binding. After removal of the protein A/G-agarose by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 1 min), the cleared supernatant was collected and 10 μl of affinity-purified anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was added for overnight incubation at 4 °C. Protein A/G beads were then added and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The protein A/G-antibody-antigen complex was then collected by washing three times with ice-cold RIPA buffer. The final pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of SDS sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol and heated to 50 °C for 10 min. 20 μl of this preparation was electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and the proteins on the gel were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Co-precipitated proteins were detected by Western blotting using specific antibodies. MAPK Assay—HEK293 cells stably expressing CXCR4 or CXCR2 were transiently transfected with vector (control), FHC expressing vector, control siRNA, or FHC-specific siRNA. Cells were treated with CXCL12 (10 nm) or CXCL8 (10 nm) for different time intervals. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer. Lysates containing equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated ERK1/2 was detected by Western blot analysis using a phosphospecific ERK1/2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The blots were stripped and reprobed with ERK2 antibody to confirm equal loading. FHC Phosphorylation Assay—HEK293 cells stably expressing CXCR4 were grown in 6-well plates. Cells were treated with CXCL12 (10 nm) for different time intervals before being lysed in RIPA buffer. FHC proteins were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates. Equal amounts of immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated FHC proteins were detected by Western blot analysis with an anti-phosphoserine antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories). The same blots were stripped and reprobed with a FHC antibody to confirm equal loading. Densitometry Analysis of Western Blots—The relative amount of the Western blot bands was measured by densitometry analysis using NIH Image software. The relative density of the protein bands was calculated in the area encompassing the immunoreactive protein band and subtracting the background of an adjacent nonreactive area in the same lane of the protein of interest. Chemotaxis Assay—The migration of HEK293 cells stably expressing CXCR4 and transiently transfected with the FHC construct or FHC-specific siRNA was evaluated using the chemotaxis assay. Briefly, polycarbonate filters (10-μm pore size) coated with 20 μg/μl human collagen type IV were placed between the upper and lower compartments of the Boyden chambers (Neuroprobe, Gaithersburg, MD). The lower compartment of the chamber was loaded with 400-μl aliquots of 1 mg/ml ovalbumin/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (chemotaxis buffer) or CXCL12 diluted in the chemotaxis buffer (0.001-10 nm). Cells (5 × 105/100 μl) were loaded into the upper compartments and incubated for 240 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells migrated toward media or CXCL12 gradients were counted under the microscope (20 × objective) after being stained with a Diff-Quik kit. The migration index was calculated based on the ratio of the number of cells crossing the filter toward CXCL12 gradients to the number of cells migrating toward media (control). Each experiment was performed at least three times. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS) Analysis— HEK293 cells stably expressing Myc-CXCR4 were transfected with vector (control), plasmids encoding FHC or FHC-S178A, control siRNA, or FHC-specific siRNA. Cells were incubated in HEPES (20 mm)-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence or absence of CXCL12 (10 nm) for 30 min. Cells were washed in ice-cold medium followed by continued incubation in ligand-free medium at 37 °C for 60 min. Cells were incubated with a monoclonal anti-Myc antibody at 4 °C for 60 min, followed by FITC-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody at 4 °C for 60 min. Cells were washed and fixed in 2% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and analyzed by flow cytometry equipped with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). In a recent effort to identify CXCR4-interacting proteins, we performed proteomic studies by treating HEK293 cells stably expressing Myc-CXCR4 with or without CXCL12, immunoprecipitating CXCR4 from the cell lysates, and analyzing the co-immunoprecipitated proteins by mass spectrometry. We have identified a number of proteins that potentially interact with CXCR4, and have characterized some of them (35Ding Y. Li M. Zhang J. Li N. Xia Z. Hu Y. Wang S. Fan G.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1269-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). One of the proteins potentially associated with CXCR4 is FHC (data not shown). To confirm the association of FHC with CXCR4, we repeated the co-immunoprecipitation experiment after treating HEK293 cells stably expressing Myc-CXCR4 with CXCL12 (10 nm) for different time intervals and detected the possible association of FHC with CXCR4 by Western blot analysis using a specific anti-FHC antibody. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, immunoprecipitation of CXCR4 from HEK293 cells revealed a weak basal association of the receptor with FHC prior to ligand treatment. CXCL12 (10 nm) treatment resulted in a time-dependent increase in the association of FHC with CXCR4, which peaked at 30 min and returned to near basal level after 120 min of incubation. By comparing the density of the immunoblots for FHC co-precipitated with CXCR4 from 1 ml of cell lysate and the immunoblots of FHC in 40 μl of cell lysate, we estimated that 20% of the FHC proteins were coimmunoprecipitated with CXCR4. 3R. Li, C. Luo, M. Mines, J. Zhang, and G.-H. Fan, unpublished data. The CXCR4-FHC interaction is obviously specific because using the anti-Myc antibody failed to pull down any FHC from the cell lysate of parental HEK293 cells, which do not express CXCR4 endogenously. We have previously shown that CXCR4 undergoes internalization in response to CXCL12 stimulation in a time-dependent manner and maximal receptor internalization occurs after exposure to CXCL12 for 30 min (35Ding Y. Li M. Zhang J. Li N. Xia Z. Hu Y. Wang S. Fan G.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1269-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The corresponding peak CXCR4 internalization time and peak FHC-CXCR4 association time (30 min) suggests that only the internalized CXCR4 associates with FHC. To test this hypothesis, the internalization of Myc-CXCR4 in HEK293 cells was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with 0.4 m sucrose for 1 h at 37 °C in medium without fetal bovine serum (36Mueller A. Kelly E. Strange P.G. Blood. 2002; 99: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and then the co-immunoprecipitation assay was performed to examine the association of CXCR4 with FHC after CXCL12 (10 nm) treatment for 30 min. As shown in Fig. 1C, CXCL12 treatment resulted in a significant increase in the association of CXCR4 with FHC in the control cells. In contrast, the ligand-induced association was remarkably reduced in the sucrose-pretreated cells. In a parallel experiment, we observed that sucrose pretreatment inhibited CXCL12-induced CXCR4 internalization (data not shown). These data suggest that CXCR4 internalization is required for its association with FHC. The C terminus of chemokine receptors has been known to interact with various intracellular proteins (35Ding Y. Li M. Zhang J. Li N. Xia Z. Hu Y. Wang S. Fan G.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1269-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 37Fan G.H. Yang W. Sai J. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16960-16968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To test whether the CXCR4 C terminus is involved in receptor association with FHC, we incubated purified GST (control) or GST-CXCR4 C terminus fusion proteins with HEK293 cell lysates and determined co-precipitated FHC by immunoblotting. To assess the possible interaction of the receptor N terminus with FHC, we also incubated purified GSTCXCR4 N terminus fusion proteins with HEK293 cell lysates and detected possible co-precipitated FHC by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1D, the GST-CXCR4 C terminus fusion proteins but not the GST alone (control) associated with FHC. Unexpectedly, we also observed a robust association of the GST-CXCR4 N terminus fusion proteins with FHC, suggesting that both the C terminus and N terminus contain FHC binding sites. The in vitro and in vivo associations of FHC with CXCR4 suggest that these two proteins are co-distributed. To visualize the subcellular localization of CXCR4 and FHC, we treated HeLa cells transiently expressing Myc-CXCR4 with CXCL12 (10 nm) for different time intervals (0, 15, and 30 min), immunostained both Myc-CXCR4 and FHC, and performed confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 2, prior to ligand stimulation, CXCR4 proteins were exclusively expressed on the cell surface, whereas FHC was predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm. In response to ligand treatment for 15 min, a small proportion of Myc-CXCR4 receptors were internalized and partially co-localized with FHC in the cytoplasm (small arrows indicated). Ligand treatment for 30 min induced more pronounced CXCR4 internalization and colocalization with FHC (small arrows indicated). Interestingly, we observed significant nuclear translocation of FHC after CXCL12 treatment for 15 min (large arrows indicated) and maximal nuclear translocation was observed after 30 min of ligand stimulation (large arrows indicated). FHC is enriched with serine and threonine residues in the protein sequence. T"
https://openalex.org/W2042881370,"Ribosomal proteins were recently shown to regulate p53 activity by abrogating Mdm2-induced p53 degradation (L23, L11, L5) or by enhancing p53 translation (L26). Here, we report that a novel ribosomal protein, RPS27L (S27-like protein), is a direct p53 target. RPS27L, but not its family member RPS27, was identified as a p53 inducible gene in a genome-wide chip-profiling study. Further characterization revealed a p53-dependent induction of RPS27L in multiple cancer cell models. Indeed, a consensus p53-binding site was identified in the first intron of the RPS27L gene and a direct binding of p53 to this site was demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. Characterization of a luciferase reporter driven by the RPS27L intron fragment revealed a p53-binding site-dependent transaction by wild-type p53, but not by several transactivating-deficient p53 mutants. This transactivation was enhanced by etoposide, a DNA damaging agent that activates p53 and was completely blocked by a dominant-negative p53 mutant. Functionally, overexpression of RPS27L within the physiological inducible levels promoted, whereas siRNA silencing of RPS27L inhibited, apoptosis induced by etoposide. This is the first report, to our knowledge, that p53 directly induces the expression of a ribosomal protein, RPS27L, which in turn promotes apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1976438344,"Proteasome dysfunction has been demonstrated in Parkinson disease (PD), and proteasome inhibitors have been shown to induce degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in vitro and in vivo. The mechanism whereby proteasome dysfunction leads to dopaminergic cell death, however, is unknown. In this study, we show that proteasome inhibition in both PC12 cells and dopaminergic neurons derived from embryonic stem cells is associated with mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, activation of caspase-3, and nuclear changes consistent with apoptosis. Prior to the emergence of apoptotic features, we found that proteasome inhibition induced increased levels of phosphorylated p53. Inhibition of p53 by pifithrin-α or by RNA interference prevented mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and cytotoxicity. There was no increase in p53 mRNA in proteasome-inhibited cells, suggesting that p53 was increased in a transcription-independent manner. Further, there was no increase in Puma or Bax mRNA and p53 co-immunoprecipitated with Bcl-xL and Mdm2. These findings suggest that p53 mediates cell death by way of a direct mitochondrial effect in this model. We also observed increased levels of phosphorylated p53 in dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta of mice following systemic administration of a proteasome inhibitor. These changes preceded degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Increased phosphorylated p53 was also demonstrated in the substantia nigra pars compacta of post-mortem PD brains. These results suggest that abnormalities in p53 signaling play a role in dopaminergic cell death induced by proteasome inhibition and may be relevant to neurodegeneration in PD.

For example, treatment of rat ventral mesencephalic cultures or PC12 cells with proteasome inhibitors leads to degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and the formation of α-synuclein/ubiquitin-containing intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Further, we and others have found that systemic administration of a proteasome inhibitor induces a model of PD in rats with behavioral, imaging, pathological, and biochemical features that resemble what is found in human PD brain (16McNaught K.S.

These findings suggest that defects in the ubiquitin proteasome system, and more specifically proteasomal dysfunction, might play a role in the loss of dopaminergic neurons in PD. Recent studies have demonstrated that degeneration of dopaminergic cells induced by toxins thought to be relevant to PD is associated with increased levels of the tumor suppressor gene p53 (20Nair V.D.

Neurol. 2002; 52: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). p53 is a sequence-specific transcription factor that increases dramatically in response to a variety of cellular stresses and activates the expression of several genes that promote cell death (see reviews in Refs. 23Laptenko O. Prives C. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 951-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 24Lavin M.F. Gueven N.

Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 994-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). p53 is also known to be able to cause cell death by directly inducing mitochondrial permeability and apoptosis, independent of the transcriptional up-regulation of pro-apoptotic genes (26Mihara M.

The regulation of p53 levels in the cell is complex and not completely understood (28Brooks C.L. Gu W. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 307-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). However, the ubiquitin proteasome system is known to play an important role in maintaining low levels of p53 in the cell, because the protein is primarily cleared by Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation (16McNaught K.S. Perl D.P. Brownell A.L. Olanow C.W. Ann. Neurol. 2004; 56: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we hypothesize that proteasomal dysfunction in PD and related models could lead to increased levels of p53 that contribute to the degeneration of dopaminergic cells. Here, we report that proteasome inhibition induces degeneration of PC12 cells and dopaminergic neurons generated from mouse embryonic stem (DA-ES) cells. Dopaminergic cell death is accompanied by a nontranscriptional increase in phosphorylated (activated) p53, and p53 inhibition prevents cell death in these models. We also demonstrate that phosphorylated p53 accumulates in the SNc of mice treated with proteasome inhibitor as well as in patients with sporadic PD. These data suggest that p53 signaling plays a key role in cell death associated with proteasome inhibition and possibly in PD itself. Cell Culture—Mouse embryonic stem cells (R1) in culture were propagated and differentiated into DA neurons (DA-ES) as described previously (20Nair V.D.

CellTiter-Blue Cytotoxicity Assays—For cytotoxicity analysis, the cells were plated at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well on 96-microwell cell culture plates (in 100 μl of medium) and grown for 24 h. For neuroprotection studies, Z-DEVD-fmk (Biovision, Mountain View, CA) or pifithrin-α (PFT-α; A.G. Scientific Inc., San Diego, CA) was applied 1 h prior to treatment with proteasome inhibitor Z-lle-Glu(OtBu)-Ala-Leu-al (PSI; Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). Following various treatments, 20 μl of the CellTiter-Blue™ reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 3-4 h. The conversion of nonfluorescent CellTiter-Blue reagent to highly fluorescent substrate by living cells was quantified using a spectrofluorometer (Spectra Max Gemini XS, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) as described (20Nair V.D.

After washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated at room temperature for 2 h with Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa Fluor 592 chicken anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG, and/or Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-sheep IgG (1:400; Molecular Probes) as indicated. The nuclei were stained with fluorescent DNA dye 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI). The slides were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) mounting medium and examined under an Olympus (BX65) upright epifluorescence microscope. Determination of Mitochondrial Membrane Permeability—The cells were incubated in medium containing 250 nm Mito-Tracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes) at 37 °C for 45 min. Thereafter, the cells were processed as described previously (20Nair V.D. Apoptosis. 2006; 11: 955-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The slides were examined using an Olympus (BX65) upright epifluorescence microscope. Gene Expression Analysis—Total cellular RNA was prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). To determine the expression of target genes, reverse transcription PCR or quantitative real time PCR was carried out in an ABI Prism 7900HT (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using SYBR-Green assay, as previously described (20Nair V.D.

The authenticity of the PCR products was verified by melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis. The comparative cycle threshold method was used to analyze the data by generating relative values of the amount of target cDNA (29Nair V.D. Yuen T. Olanow C.W. Sealfon S.C. J. Biol.

Luciferase Reporter Assay—The PC12 cells were plated in 12-well plates (1 × 105 cells/well) with complete medium. After 24 h, the cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of p53-Luc plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), as well as with 50 ng of a Renilla luciferase plasmid (pRL-TK) (Promega) as a control, with the use of the TransIT-Neural transfection reagents (Mirus, Madison, WI) as described previously (31Nair V.D. Sealfon S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47053-47061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The following day, the cells were treated with PSI (5 μm) for the time periods indicated, and the luciferase activity of the lysate was measured in triplicate with a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) using the Sirius luminometer (Berthold Technologies). The luciferase activities of the p53-luciferase vector were normalized based on Renilla luciferase activity of the co-transfected vector. At a minimum, transfections were done in triplicate and on two independent occasions. RNA Interference—Custom SMARTpool plus small interfering RNA (siRNA) to target rat p53 (29Nair V.D. Yuen T. Olanow C.W. Sealfon S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27494-27501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) was designed and synthesized by Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) (product number QS-004997-00-70). siRNA (50 pmol) was transfected into PC12 cells using TransIT-TKO transfection reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI) as described previously (29Nair V.D.

Chem. 2003; 278: 47053-47061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). After 48 h upon transfection, the cells were treated with PSI (5 μm) or vehicle for 24 h, and cell viability was assessed by CellTiter-Blue assays. A non-specific RNA duplex (Dharmacon; catalog number D-001206-09-05) was used in control experiments. Animals and Proteasome Inhibitor Treatments—All of the experiments were performed in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Mount Sinai School of Medicine and National Institutes of Health guidelines on the ethical use of animals. Male 129Sv mice (purchased from Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY; weight, 25-30 g) were housed in plastic cages and provided free access to food and water. The animals were maintained in temperature- and humidity-controlled rooms with a 12-h light-dark cycle (light from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.). The mice were randomly divided into two treatment groups. In the control group, the animals were administered vehicle (70% ethanol). In the active treatment group, the mice were treated (subcutaneously) with 3.0 mg/kg PSI in 70% ethanol. The animals received six subcutaneous injections spaced over a 2-week period as previously described (16McNaught K.S. Perl D.P. Brownell A.L. Olanow C.W. Ann. Neurol. 2004; 56: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). During and for up to 6 weeks after the end of the injections, the animals were assessed for alterations in body weights and monitored for evidence of systemic toxicity. At 1 and 6 weeks after the cessation of treatment, the mice were sacrificed, and brain histopathological analyses were performed. Immunohistochemistry—For immunohistochemistry, the mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital (10 mg/kg intraperitoneal) and fixed by transcardial perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). The brains were post-fixed in the same solution overnight and then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose/phosphate-buffered saline. For immunostaining, the brains were cut coronally in 25-μm sections with a sliding microtome equipped with a freezing stage, and two successive slices of vehicle- and PSI-treated animals were arranged serially on the same slide. The sections were either stained for TH using a Vector ABC immunostaining procedure with DAB chromogen or a double immunofluorescence for TH and phospho-p53 or phospho-ERK with donkey anti-sheep (Alexa 488; 1:400; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and goat anti-rabbit (Alexa 568; 1:400) was used as a secondary antibody to detect TH and phospho-p53 or phospho-ERK, respectively. The nuclei were stained with the fluorescent DNA dye DAPI, and the sections were subsequently mounted in Vectashield. The sections were examined, and the images were acquired with an Olympus BX65 microscope equipped with a high resolution digital camera. The number of neuronal cell bodies in specific brain areas was counted manually as we described previously (16McNaught K.S. Perl D.P. Brownell A.L. Olanow C.W. Ann. Neurol. 2004; 56: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—The data were analyzed using Graph-Pad Prism data analysis program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). For the comparison of statistical significance between two groups, Student's t tests for paired and unpaired data were used. For multiple comparisons, one-way analysis of variance followed by post hoc comparisons of the group means according to the method of Tukey was used. Proteasomal Inhibition Causes Dopaminergic Cell Loss and Protein Aggregation in Vitro—We examined the cytotoxic effects of proteasome inhibitors on dopaminergic cells in culture. A number of previous investigations have demonstrated that the peptidyl aldehyde PSI is a specific inhibitor of proteasome chymotrypsin-related activity (16McNaught K.S. Perl D.P. Brownell A.L. Olanow C.W. Ann. Neurol. 2004; 56: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 32Lopes U.G. Erhardt P. Yao R. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12893-12896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Treatment of PC12 cells with PSI at 1-10 μm induced a concentration-dependent cell death. At 1 and 5 μm, there was ∼20 and 50% cell loss after 24 h of treatment (Fig. 1A). Consistent with reported studies (33Ciechanover A. Brundin P. Neuron. 2003; 40: 427-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar) proteasome inhibition caused a time-dependent increase in ubiquitinated proteins (increased by ∼2-fold at 16 h) as determined by Western immunoblotting (Fig. 1B). Immunocytochemistry following PSI treatment similarly showed a marked increase in cytoplasmic and nuclear staining for ubiquitinated proteins along with the formation of aggregates resembling inclusions bodies (Fig. 1C). We also examined the effects of PSI in cultures containing dopaminergic neurons derived from ES cells (DA-ES) because this system provides a relatively high density of dopaminergic neurons (∼25% of total cells) in which cell death mechanisms can be studied. PSI also induced dose-dependent degeneration of these neurons. At 1 and 10 μm, total cell death was ∼20 and 30%, respectively, after 24 h of incubation (Fig. 1D). To determine the specificity of PSI toxicity for dopaminergic neurons, we measured [3H]DA uptake. The percentage of total cell death observed with PSI at 10 μm was 28.6 ± 1.1, whereas [3H]DA uptake showed an almost complete loss of DA uptake (95.6 ± 7.1) (Fig. 1D). These findings confirm previous reports that proteasome inhibitors can induce a relatively selective dose-dependent degeneration of dopaminergic cells with protein accumulation and inclusions. Proteasome Inhibition Causes Mitochondrial Membrane Permeabilization and Caspase-3 Activation—Proteasome inhibition is known to be associated with apoptotic cell death (18Schapira A.H. Cleeter M.W. Muddle J.R. Workman J.M. Cooper J.M. King R.H. Ann. Neurol. 2006; 60: 253-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In our studies, PSI treatment induced morphological features of apoptosis such as fragmented nuclei in PC12 cells (Fig. 2A) and retracted processes in DA-ES cells (Fig. 2B). To determine whether this process involves a mitochondrially mediated mechanism, we examined mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and caspase-3 activation following PSI exposure. In PC12 cells, mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, as measured by MitoTracker Red CMXRos uptake, was significantly reduced in dopaminergic cells treated after 6 h of incubation with PSI (Fig. 3A, upper panels). This was associated with reduced focal (presumably mitochondrial) staining for cytochrome c at 16-24 h (Fig. 3A, lower panels), consistent with the diffusion of the protein from mitochondria to the cytoplasm. At 24 h, immunostaining for activated caspase-3 was observed in TH-positive DA-ES cells and in PC12 cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Moreover, caspase-3 activation was exclusively present in cells that failed to take up MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Fig. 3B), further indicating that mitochondrial membrane permeabilization precedes caspase-3 activation.FIGURE 3Proteasome inhibition causes alterations in mitochondrial membrane permeability. A, PC12 cells were treated with 5 μm PSI for the indicated period of time and mitochondrial membrane permeability was assessed using MitoTracker Red CMXRos (upper panels, red) and cytochrome c immunostaining (lower panels, green). Decreased MitoTracker uptake and cytochrome c staining was observed after 6 h of PSI exposure. B, PC12 cells were treated with 5 μm PSI for 24 h and then subjected to MitoTracker uptake (red) and caspase-3 immunostaining (green). In PSI-treated cells, caspase-3 activation was found exclusively in cells with decreased MitoTracker uptake and fragmented nuclei (blue). Similar results were observed in four independent experiments. Scale bar, 5 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether caspase-3 mediates proteasome inhibitor-induced death, DA-ES and PC12 cells were pretreated with the caspasae-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-fmk before being treated with 1 or 5 μm of PSI, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2 (C and D), 10 μm Z-DEVD-fmk treatments significantly prevented the loss of DA-ES and PC12 cells induced by PSI. These results suggest that PSI induces cell death via a caspase-3-dependent mechanism in these in vitro models. Proteasomal Inhibition Leads to Accumulation of Phosphorylated p53 in Dopaminergic Cells—Because the degradation and clearance of p53 is controlled by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (34Rodriguez M. Desterro J. Lain S. Lane D. Hay R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8458-8467Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), we examined the effects of proteasome inhibition with PSI on the accumulation of p53 in PC12 cells. Treatment with 5 μm PSI was associated with an increase in the level of p53 protein of 4-5-fold after 16 and 24 h of exposure (Fig. 4, A and B). Accumulated p53 was highly phosphorylated at serine 15 (Fig. 4, A and B), which is known to increase p53 stability (accumulation) (35Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C.

https://openalex.org/W2055547557,"Pharmacological experiments on Ascaris suum have demonstrated the presence of three (N-, L-, and B-) subtypes of cholinergic receptor mediating contraction of body wall muscle in parasitic nematodes. In the present study, these ionotropic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors (nAChRs) were activated by levamisole and bephenium under patch-clamp conditions and competitively antagonized by paraherquamide and 2-desoxoparaherquamide. A number of recordings exhibited three separate current amplitude levels, indicating the presence of small, intermediate, and large conductance subtypes of receptor. The mean conductance of the small conductance subtype, G25, was 22 +/- 1 pS; the intermediate conductance channel, G35, was 33 +/- 1 pS; and the large conductance channel, G45, was 45 +/- 1 pS. The small channel was not antagonized significantly by paraherquamide and was identified as the N-subtype. The intermediate channel was preferentially activated by levamisole rather than bephenium and antagonized by paraherquamide: the intermediate channel was identified as the L-subtype. The large conductance channel was preferentially activated by bephenium, antagonized more by 2-desoxoparaherquamde than by paraherquamide and was identified as the B-subtype. These observations reveal that the three channel subtypes have different selectivity for cholinergic anthelmintics. The different selectivity of these compounds should be considered when dealing with drug resistant infections."

Biol. 2000; 175: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Their ∼150-residue globular N termini (N-domain; see Fig. 1) reside within their β-barrels. This architecture is potentially consistent with the “ball-and-chain” mechanism of membrane transport, whereby the globule controls solute (ligand) uptake by moving in and out of the channel. This process was postulated for nervous system channels (6Armstrong C.M. Bezanilla F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 70: 567-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar), but no demonstrated examples of ball-and-chain transport are known. FepA and its relatives are unlike other porins (7Nikaido H.

Ligand binding causes small conformational changes that activate them to transport competency (15Locher K.P. Rees B. Koebnik R. Mitschler A. Moulinier L. Rosenbusch J.P. Moras D.

Vaara M. Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 1-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); TonB is a minor cell envelope protein whose functions are not yet understood. In live cells, FepA binds and transports FeEnt via sub-reactions with different dependences on energy and TonB. (i) In the absence of ligand the receptor opens, and its flexible surface loops extend outward (25Scott D.C. Newton S.M. Klebba P.E. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4906-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). (ii) FeEnt binds to FepA in a biphasic reaction (26Payne M.A. Igo J.D. Cao Z. Foster S.B. Newton S.M. Klebba P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21950-21955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) that begins with adsorption to aromatic amino acids in the loop extremities (27Cao Z. Qi Z. Sprencel C.

Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3578-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Multiple determinants in multiple loops, including L7 (25Scott D.C. Newton S.M. Klebba P.E. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4906-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), converge on the iron complex, creating a closed conformation that associates the negatively charged (-3), catecholate iron center with basic and aromatic residues in the receptor's vestibule (27Cao Z. Qi Z. Sprencel C. Newton S.M. Klebba P.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1306-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 29Newton S.M. Allen J.S. Cao Z. Qi Z. Jiang X. Sprencel C. Igo J.D.

Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1153-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). At binding equilibrium FeEnt sits atop the N-domain, poised for transport through the β-barrel. (iii) In the paralog, FhuA, ferrichrome binding relocates a short β-strand called the TonB-box away from the β-barrel wall, sending a signal of receptor occupancy from the cell surface to the periplasm (15Locher K.P. Rees B. Koebnik R. Mitschler A. Moulinier L. Rosenbusch J.P. Moras D. Cell. 1998; 95: 771-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 16Ferguson A.D. Hofmann E. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Welte W. Science. 1998; 282: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). No data exist on whether the same phenomenon takes place when FepA binds FeEnt, but conformational motion also occurs in the TonB-box of BtuB when it binds cyanocobalamin (31Merianos H.J. Cadieux N. Lin C.H. Kadner R.J. Cafiso D.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These initial stages of ligand uptake are energy- and TonB-independent, because they happen with equivalent affinity and rate in energy-sufficient or -deficient, and TonB+ or tonB cells. (iv) In energized tonB+ cells FepA internalizes FeEnt through its transmembrane channel into the periplasm. Transport does not occur in de-energized or tonB cells. The function of the N-domain in transport is presently inscrutable (32Usher K.C. Ozkan E. Gardner K.H. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10676-10681Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It has low affinity for the ligand (32Usher K.C. Ozkan E. Gardner K.H. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10676-10681Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and it blocks the FepA channel, necessitating a structural rearrangement to open a pathway to the periplasm. In the ball-and-chain model the N-domain dislodges into the periplasm, either as a globule that moves on the basis of its hinge-like connection to the β-barrel (at residue 150), or by unfolding of its α-β structure, in both cases opening the large (∼40-Å diameter) trans-OM channel. N-domain expulsion rationalizes ligand internalization: if the metal complex associates with the N-domain loops, then movement of the N-domain to the periplasm will transport FeEnt through the channel. The Transient Pore model, on the other hand, requires conformational motion in the N-domain while it is resident in the β-barrel, which opens a necessarily smaller pore for passage of the metal complex. The dimensions of FeEnt indicate that such a channel must acquire a diameter of ∼20 Å. According to this mechanism, the ligand transits the protein interior by passing between sequential binding sites with affinity for its natural chemistry. For the acidic siderophore FeEnt, this may happen by stepwise binding to basic residues that exist near the top of the FepA N-domain and line its membrane channel. In this report we tested for the main difference between these models, N-domain movement into the periplasm, by determining the susceptibility of genetically engineered Cys residues to modification by fluorescein maleimide (FM) during FeEnt uptake. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, Culture Conditions, and Chemicals—Bacteria were grown at 37 °C with vigorous shaking in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (33Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) containing streptomycin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (20 μg/ml). For physiological and biochemical experiments, including fluorescence labeling studies, we subcultured the bacteria (1%) from stationary-phase LB broth cultures into MOPS minimal medium (58Neidhardt F.C. Bloch P.L. Smith D.F. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 736-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or T-medium (2McIntosh M.A. Earhart C.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 70: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) containing the same antibiotics but without added iron. After ∼6 h the growth rate diminished from iron deficiency. Under these conditions the expression of the inner membrane (FepC, FepD, and FepG) and periplasmic (FepB) components of the transport system reached maximum levels, and transport of FeEnt through the OM is the rate-limiting step in its uptake (30Newton S.M. Igo J.D. Scott D.C. Klebba P.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1153-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 34Sprencel C. Cao Z. Qi Z. Scott D.C. Montague M.A. Ivanoff N. Xu J. Raymond K.M. Newton S.M. Klebba P.E. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5359-5364Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Siderophores and Colicin B—We formed iron complexes of purified enterobactin (28Annamalai R. Jin B. Cao Z. Newton S.M. Klebba P.E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3578-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and TRENCAM (a gift from Dick van der Helm) by dissolving the siderophores in methanol, incubating them with an equimolar amount of freshly prepared FeSO4 in water, or 59FeCl3 (Amersham Biosciences) in dilute HCl. After 1 h at 25°C we adjusted the pH to 6.9 with NaHPO4, chromatographically purified the ferric siderophores over Sephadex LH20 in 5 mm NaHPO4, and spectrophotometrically determined their concentrations from their extinction maxima (5.6 mm-1) at 495 nm. We purified colicins B and D from cultures of Escherichia coli strains DM1187/pCLB1 (26Payne M.A. Igo J.D. Cao Z. Foster S.B. Newton S.M. Klebba P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21950-21955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and CA23, respectively. Site-directed Deletion Mutagenesis—We genetically engineered in-frame chromosomal deletion mutants in E. coli K-12 strain BN1071 (35Klebba P.E. McIntosh M.A. Neilands J.B. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 149: 880-888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by allelic replacement (36Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11305) Google Scholar). After verification of OKN1 (ΔtonB), OKN2 (ΔfecA), OKN3 (ΔfepA), OKN5 (Δcir), OKN7 (ΔfhuA), OKN9 (Δfiu), and OKN13 (ΔtonB and ΔfepA) by PCR reactions from chromosomal DNA and SDS-PAGE analysis of their cell envelopes (Fig. 1), we transformed OKN3 and OKN13 with plasmids of interest and confirmed their expected phenotypes by measurement of FeEnt and Fc transport, and colicin and bacteriophage susceptibility (30Newton S.M. Igo J.D. Scott D.C. Klebba P.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1153-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We constructed OKN7 by P1 transduction of the ΔfhuA marker in strain MB97 (37Braun M. Endriss F. Killmann H. Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5508-5518Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which was a gift from V. Braun. Site-directed Cys Substitution Mutagenesis—We engineered mutations on pITS23 (25Scott D.C. Newton S.M. Klebba P.E. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4906-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 38Scott D.C. Cao Z. Qi Z. Bauler M. Igo J.D. Newton S.M. Klebba P.E. J. Biol.

Timmis K.N. Gene (Amst.). 1981; 16: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) carrying fepA under its natural promoter. Using QuikChange (Stratagene) we generated site-directed Cys substitution mutations in fepA on pITS23 for the following residues: Ile-14, Ala-33, Gly-54, Ser-92, Thr-107, Thr-216, Ser-254, Ala-261, Ser-271, Gly-300, Ala-322, Thr-367, Ala-383, Ser-411, Ser-470, Ser-482, Ser-507, Thr-550, Gly-565, Ser-569, Thr-585, Ser-600, Thr-609, Thr-666, and Ala-698. After verification by DNA sequence analysis (McLab, San Francisco, CA), we evaluated the colicin B and D sensitivity, ability to transport FeEnt, and the expression of the mutant FepA proteins (30Newton S.M. Igo J.D. Scott D.C. Klebba P.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1153-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar): their phenotypes were indistinguishable from wild-type FepA. Membrane Separations—Bacterial cells, grown to late-exponential phase in MOPS minimal media, were collected by centrifugation, suspended in either 0.01 m HEPES, pH 7.4, or 0.01 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.9% NaCl (Tris-buffered saline (TBS)), chilled on ice, and lysed by passage through a French pressure cell at 14,000 p.s.i. The OM and inner membrane (IM) fragments formed by French press lysis (40Smit J. Kamio Y. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 124: 942-958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were either fractionated by sucrose gradient centrifugation (41Nikaido H. Rosenberg E.Y. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 241-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or subjected to differential extraction with sodium sarkosinate (42Rutz J.M. Abdullah T. Singh S.P. Kalve V.I. Klebba P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5964-5974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE, Western Immunoblots, and Expression Measurements—For SDS-PAGE, samples were suspended in SDS-containing sample buffer plus 3% β-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 5 min, and electrophoresed (30Newton S.M. Igo J.D. Scott D.C. Klebba P.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1153-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 43Ames G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 634-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at room temperature. For Western immunoblots, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose paper, the paper was blocked with 50 mm Tris chloride (pH 7.5), 0.5 m NaCl (TBS) plus 1% gelatin, incubated with mouse anti-FepA monoclonal antibody 45 (0.5% (44Murphy C.K. Kalve V.I. Klebba P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2736-2746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) in TBS plus 1% gelatin for 3 h, and developed with 125I-protein A (30Newton S.M. Igo J.D. Scott D.C. Klebba P.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1153-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For determinations of protein expression levels, 5 × 108 bacteria were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 150 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, briefly centrifuged to remove debris, and 108 cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblot. After overnight exposure on an imaging screen, radioactivity was quantitated on the STORMSCAN PhosphorImager. Fluorescence Labeling—For covalent modification of Cys residues in live cells, after overnight growth in LB broth the bacteria were subcultured in MOPS minimal media and shaken at 37 °C until they reached mid-log phase (4-5 × 108 cells/ml; ∼5 h). The cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice by suspension in TBS (pH 7.4, 0 °C) and centrifugation, and then resuspended in TBS (pH 7.2, 0 °C) containing glucose (0.4%), with or without FeEnt (0.0001-200 μm) or sodium azide (10 mm), as the experiments warranted. FM was prepared by dissolution in dimethyl formamide; its concentration was spectrophotometrically determined (ϵ493 nm = 81,500 m-1) after dilution into 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8. FM was added to 5-20 μm, for 1-15 min at 37 °C in the dark. The reactions were quenched by the addition of cysteine (to 1 mm), and the bacteria were washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold TBS, resuspended in ice-cold TBS, quantitated by visible spectrophotometry at 600 nm, and lysed by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the gels were analyzed by direct fluorescence imagery. Fluorescence Imagery—Immediately following resolution of cell lysate proteins by SDS-PAGE, the slab gels were rinsed with water and transferred to a STORMSCAN PhosphorImager and scanned for fluorescence emissions, and the resultant images were analyzed by ImageQuant 5.2 (Molecular Dynamics). FepA (cysteine-substituted) was the primary protein that FM labeled in the outer membranes, but other proteins in the lysates were also consistently modified. The intensity of FepA Cys mutant fluoresceination was quantitated relative to the total labeling that was observed for all other proteins in the cell lysate. Disulfide Bonds between the N-domain and the β-Barrel— Bacteria were cultured in LB broth and subcultured in nutrient broth containing β-mercaptoethanol, dithiothreitol, or oxidized dithiothreitol at the indicated concentrations. After 3.5 h aliquots of bacteria were collected by centrifugation, lysed, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblot with anti-FepA monoclonal antibody 45, or subjected to siderophore nutrition tests. Complementation Assays—E. coli strain OKN3, which carries a precise deletion of the fepA structural gene (see “Results”), was individually transformed with plasmids expressing the N-domain (pFepN) and empty β-barrel (pFepβ) of FepA and with both plasmids (pFepNpFepβ). We verified the expression of the individual domains by Western immunoblot and then determined the functionality of the two protein domains when expressed singly or together, by measuring susceptibility to colicin B and D, and by FeEnt uptake. Precise Deletions of OM Receptor Proteins—Because of potential complementation between chromosomal fragments of ferric siderophore receptor genes and mutant receptor genes on plasmids (45Vakharia H.L. Postle K. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5508-5512Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we genetically engineered (36Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11305) Google Scholar) an isogenic series of bacterial strains containing precise deletions of tonB, fepA, fepA, cir, fhuA, and fiu in BN1071 (F-trp, entA-). After transformation of OKN3 (ΔfepA) with pITS23 (fepA+ (38Scott D.C. Cao Z. Qi Z. Bauler M. Igo J.D. Newton S.M. Klebba P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13025-13033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)), and OKN7 (ΔfhuA) with pITS11 (fhuA+ (38Scott D.C. Cao Z. Qi Z. Bauler M. Igo J.D. Newton S.M. Klebba P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13025-13033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)), we tested all the strains for their susceptibility to bacteriocins B, D, and M, bacteriophages T5 and H8, 7W. Rabsch, L. Ma, G. Wiley, F. Najar, B. Roe, W. Kaserer, B. Biel, M. Schmalley, S. M. Newton, and P. E. Klebba, manuscript submitted for publication. and for their ability to bind and transport ferric enterobactin and ferrichrome. The resistance of the hosts strains to the colicins and phage showed the absence of FepA and FhuA, and the complementation of the engineered deletion strains to sensitivity by fepA+ and fhuA+ alleles on pHSG575 verified this conclusion. Similarly, OKN3 and OKN7 were unable to transport ferric enterobactin and ferrichrome, respectively, whereas the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of OKN3/pITS23 and OKN7/pITS11 were identical to those of wild-type FepA and wild-type FhuA in KDF541 harboring the same plasmids, and in BN1071, which expresses the wild-type proteins from the chromosome (25Scott D.C. Newton S.M. Klebba P.E. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4906-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Cao Z. Qi Z. Sprencel C. Newton S.M. Klebba P.E. Mol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 13025-13033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Lastly, fluorescence spectroscopic measurements of FeEnt uptake in FM-modified OKN3/FepAS271C (Fig. 1) were indistinguishable from those observed in KDF541 (47Cao Z. Warfel P. Newton S.M. Klebba P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1022-1028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, when harboring plasmids that encode the wild-type fepA and fhuA genes, host strains with precise deletions of siderophore receptor genes behaved identically to previously isolated spontaneous fepA and fhuA mutants (48Rutz J.M. Liu J. Lyons J.A. Goranson J. Armstrong S.K. McIntosh M.A. Feix J.B. Klebba P.E. Science. 1992; 258: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Besides the site-directed deletions of individual siderophore receptor genes in BN1071(ΔfepA, ΔfhuA, ΔybiL (Δfiu), ΔfecA, and Δcir; Fig. 1), we constructed a derivative with an exact deletion of tonB (OKN1), another that carried inactivating transposon cassettes in ompF and ompC (from HN705 (49Sugawara E. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2507-2511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and several multiple combinations of these mutations (Fig. 1). Modification of Genetically Engineered Cys Residues by FM— After generating 25 Cys substitutions, we confirmed the functionality of the mutant FepA proteins in activity assays. All the Cys mutant derivatives of FepA transported FeEnt like the wild-type parent protein in siderophore nutrition tests and conferred normal susceptibility to colicin B. The mutant proteins, under control of the wild-type FepA promoter, were expressed at wild-type levels (Fig. 2). Hence, in general, the introduction of a single, unpaired cysteine did not impair the physiological functions of the outer membrane protein. We surveyed the sulfhydryl side chains for their accessibility to FM (Fig. 2). When exposed for 15 min at 37 °C, with or without FeEnt, several residues were differentially reactive. The fluorophore strongly labeled engineered Cys residues in surface loops (at positions 216, 271, 322, 383, 482, and 550), reacted at lower levels with sulfhydryls in the periplasm (residues 14, 33, 300, and 666), and importantly, modified a Cys residue in the protein interior on the surface of the N-domain (residue 54). The intensity of labeling at some of these sites changed in response to the binding and transport of FeEnt (residues 14, 54, 322, 383, and 550), reiterating the receptor's dynamic response to interactions with its ligand. It was of interest that FM labeled residue G54C, buried in the receptor's interior on the surface of the N-domain, but did not label contiguous residues on the wall of the β-barrel (G565C, S569C, and T585C). The modification of G54C was weaker than that of surface residues but, nevertheless, distinct and reproducible. Cellular Distribution of Fluoresceinated Proteins—When live E. coli was exposed to FM, besides the Cys substitution mutants of FepA many other cellular proteins were weakly modified by the reagent, and about seven proteins were reproducibly labeled at higher levels (Fig. 3). The extent of labeling of other proteins depended on two factors: the external concentration of FM and the duration of the labeling reaction. Results on the concentration and time dependence of fluoresceination (data not shown) led us to employ FM at 5 μm, for 15 min at 37 °C in TBS, pH 7.2, as standard conditions. This protocol yielded specific labeling of the FepA Cys mutants (i.e. without modification of wild-type FepA) and background labeling of other proteins at moderate levels. The intensity of Cys reactivity at different sites in FepA was as high as 45% of total cellular labeling (S216C (Fig. 2)). A residue of prior interest, S271C (47Cao Z. Warfel P. Newton S.M. Klebba P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1022-1028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), was consistently labeled at a level of 26% of total cellular labeling, in the presence or absence of FeEnt, and we used the extent of S271C fluoresceination as a control standard to which we compared the labeling at other sites. G54C was one residue whose susceptibility to FM changed during the binding and transport of FeEnt, and we characterized the overall pattern of its fluorescent modification in bacteria expressing FepA with this substitution mutation. Fractionation of fluoresceinated OKN3/pFepAG54C showed the bulk of the FepAG54C-FM in the OM (∼90%) and a small amount of unprocessed, pre-FepAG54C in the IM (Fig. 3). In addition, among the approximately seven other cellular proteins that FM reacted with (seen in cell lysates, Fig. 3, lane 13), four or five resided in the periplasm/cytoplasm (Fig. 3, bands 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7; the fractionation procedure did not differentiate between the two compartments, which were collected together as the supernatant from centrifugation of the cell lysate), one derived from the IM (band 5), and one inhabited the OM (band 1). Despite these side reactions, residue G54C in FepA, which was one of most weakly labeled sites that we considered (at levels between 5 and 9% of total cellular labeling; Figs. 2, 4, and 5), was still the predominant OM target that FM reacted with, constituting >90% of the total fluorescence of the OM fraction (Fig. 3). Thus the covalent modification protocol was nearly exclusive for FepA in the OM but allowed reactions with other proteins in both the periplasm and inner membrane.FIGURE 5Concentration dependence of FeEnt effects on FM labeling of G54C.

https://openalex.org/W2037435545,"An instability of the mature cell phenotype is thought to participate to the formation of gliomas, primary brain tumors deriving from astrocytes and/or neural stem cells. Transforming growth factor alpha (TGFalpha) is an erbB1 ligand overexpressed in the earliest stages of gliomas, and exerts trophic effects on gliomal cells and astrocytes. Here, we questioned whether prolonged TGFalpha exposure affects the stability of the normal mature astrocyte phenotype. We first developed astrocyte cultures devoid of residual neural stem cells or progenitors. We demonstrate that days of TGFalpha treatment result in the functional conversion of a population of mature astrocytes into radial glial cells, a population of neural progenitors. TGFalpha-generated radial glial cells support embryonic neurons migration, and give birth to cells of the neuronal lineage, expressing neuronal markers and the electrophysiological properties of neuroblasts. Lengthening TGFalpha treatment to months results in the delayed appearance of cells with neural stem cells properties: they form floating cellular spheres that are self-renewing, can be clonally derived from a single cell and differentiated into cells of the neuronal lineage. This study uncovers a novel population of mature astrocytes capable, in response to a single epigenetic factor, to regress progressively into a neural stem-like cell stage via an intermediate progenitor stage."
https://openalex.org/W1986076894,"c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) has been reported to either potentiate or inhibit oncogenesis, depending upon the cellular context, but its role in lung neoplasia is unclear. Here we sought to define the role of JNK in lung neoplasia by examining evidence of JNK phosphorylation in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) biopsy samples and by using genetic and pharmacologic approaches to modulate JNK expression and activity in cultured cells. Immunohistochemical staining for JNK phosphorylation was detected in 114 (45%) of 252 NSCLC biopsy samples and was predominantly nuclear, providing evidence of JNK activation in a subset of NSCLC cases. Introduction of a doxycycline-inducible, constitutively active, mutant mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MKK4) into the human bronchial epithelial cell lines BEAS-2B and HB56B increased the cells' proliferation, migration, invasion and clonogenicity. Depletion of JNK in MKK4 mutant-transformed BEAS-2B cells by introduction of JNK1/2 short hairpin RNA reversed the transformed phenotype, indicating that JNK activation is oncogenic and MKK4 confers neoplastic properties in these cells. The proliferation of NSCLC cell lines HCC827 and H2009, in which JNK and its substrate c-Jun are constitutively phosphorylated, was inhibited by SP600125, a JNK kinase inhibitor. We conclude that JNK is activated in a subset of NSCLC biopsy samples and promotes oncogenesis in the bronchial epithelium, suggesting that strategies to inhibit the JNK pathway should be considered for the prevention and treatment of NSCLC."

Krauskopf A. Basso E. Petronilli V. Blalchy-Dyson E. Di Lisa F. Forte M.A. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 2077-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The mPT is defined as a sudden increase in permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) in response to mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and/or oxidative stress (2Crompton M. Virji S. Doyle V. Johnson N. Ward J.M. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 66: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 4Halestrap A.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 232-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). There are numerous indications that the mPT has complex regulation and may exist in low and high conductance modes (5Ichas F. Mazat J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 33-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 9Brustovetsky N. Dubinsky J.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 103-113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A growing body of evidence implicates the mPT in various pathologies associated with the elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ and/or oxidative stress (1Bernardi P. Krauskopf A. Basso E. Petronilli V. Blalchy-Dyson E. Di Lisa F. Forte M.A. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 2077-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 10Halestrap A.P. Clarke S.J. Javadov S.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 61: 372-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). Stroke accompanied by brain ischemia with neurons suffering from glucose/oxygen deprivation and exposure to high excitotoxic concentrations of glutamate is one such pathological condition. Overstimulation of glutamate receptors in stroke causes massive Ca2+ influx into neurons where mitochondria play a crucial role in clearance of elevated Ca2+ (11White R.J. Reynolds I.J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1318-1328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Herrington J. Park Y.B. Babcock D.F. Hille B. Neuron. 1996; 16: 219-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). However, the active role of mitochondria in sequestration of cytosolic Ca2+ comes with a high price. Excessive Ca2+ accumulation causes the mPT accompanied by its main manifestations, depolarization and mitochondrial swelling (3Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). The pivotal role of the mPT in neuronal damage emerged in the 1990s when several groups reported a protective role of cyclosporin A (CsA), an inhibitor of the mPT, in studies of the mechanisms of excitotoxicity (15Kristal B.S. Dubinsky J.M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 524-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 22Vergun O. Keelan J. Khodorov B.I. Duchen M.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 519: 451-466Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The protection with CsA is widely considered a hallmark of the mPT involvement in cellular or mitochondrial injury (1Bernardi P. Krauskopf A. Basso E. Petronilli V. Blalchy-Dyson E. Di Lisa F. Forte M.A. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 2077-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 23Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2189) Google Scholar). Lately, the role of the mPT in the mechanisms of excitotoxicity was questioned largely because of the lack or inconsistency of CsA-imposed protection (24Isaev N.K. Zorov D.B. Stelmashook E.V. Uzbekov R.E. Kozhemyakin M.B. Victorov I.V. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 28Ruiz F. Alvarez G. Ramos M. Hernandez M. Bogonez E. Satrustegui J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 404: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, it is well known that the protective effects of CsA could be easily overridden by increasing the concentrations of the mPT inducers/activators (29Bernardi P. Vassanelli S. Veronese P. Colonna R. Szabo I. Zoratti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2934-2939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Brustovetsky N. Dubinsky J.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8229-8237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the lack of CsA protection might not necessarily indicate the lack of the mPT. Many studies of mitochondrial involvement in excitotoxicity in situ are focused on mitochondrial depolarization that precludes oxidative phosphorylation restricting the energetic capacity of the cell (32Nicholls D.G. Curr. Mol. Med. (Hilversum). 2004; 4: 149-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Deregulation of calcium homeostasis that disturbs intracellular signaling and activates processes of cell degradation is another favorite area of these studies (33Bano D. Young K.W. Guerin C.J. Lefeuvre R. Rothwell N.J. Naldini L. Rizzuto R. Carafoli E. Nicotera P. Cell. 2005; 120: 275-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), although only a few of the early studies paid attention to mitochondrial morphological changes associated with glutamate insults (16Dubinsky J.M. Levi Y. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 53: 728-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 24Isaev N.K. Zorov D.B. Stelmashook E.V. Uzbekov R.E. Kozhemyakin M.B. Victorov I.V.

Neurosci. Res. 2000; 37: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Excessive mitochondrial swelling appears not to be a less dangerous process than depolarization, which potentially leads to rupture of the OMM and release of mitochondrial apoptogenes that amplify apoptotic signal transduction (36Budd S.L. Tenneti L. Lishnak T. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6161-6166Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 38Pivovarova N.B. Nguyen H.V. Winters C.A. Brantner C.A. Smith C.L. Andrews S.B. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5611-5622Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Massive Ca2+ influx into the cytosol and subsequent Ca2+ sequestration by mitochondria during glutamate challenge result in distinct changes in mitochondrial morphology that, in most cases, could be characterized as swelling of the organelles (16Dubinsky J.M. Levi Y. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 53: 728-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 24Isaev N.K. Zorov D.B. Stelmashook E.V. Uzbekov R.E. Kozhemyakin M.B. Victorov I.V. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 38Pivovarova N.B. Nguyen H.V. Winters C.A. Brantner C.A. Smith C.L. Andrews S.B. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5611-5622Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, the definitive role of the mPT in mitochondrial morphological changes was not firmly established in the early studies. Later, glutamate-induced alterations in mitochondrial morphology were found to be CsA-insensitive, and that argued against involvement of the classical mPT (39Rintoul G.L. Filiano A.J. Brocard J.B. Kress G.J. Reynolds I.J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7881-7888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In another study, an application of NMDA to cultured hippocampal neurons caused mitochondrial swelling, but whether this swelling was associated with the mPT remained unclear (38Pivovarova N.B. Nguyen H.V. Winters C.A. Brantner C.A. Smith C.L. Andrews S.B. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5611-5622Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In our previous paper (37Brustovetsky N. Brustovetsky T. Jemmerson R. Dubinsky J.M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), we showed that brief exposure of cultured neurons to an excitotoxic concentration of glutamate causes partial release of cytochrome c into the cytosol in a CsA-sensitive manner. The sensitivity to CsA linked this release to the mPT. It was proposed that mitochondrial swelling in situ followed by the rupture of the OMM underlies the release of cytochrome c. In this study, we demonstrated a CsA-sensitive, Ca2+-dependent mitochondrial remodeling in cultured neurons treated with excitotoxic glutamate. Furthermore, we compared this remodeling in situ with morphological changes in isolated brain mitochondria in vitro. Remarkably, in both cases the remodeling was spontaneously reversible and had numerous common features suggesting common mechanisms in situ as well as in vitro. This finding provided an opportunity to use isolated brain mitochondria as a well defined, cell-free model system for a detailed analysis of the mechanisms of mitochondrial remodeling in cultured neurons under excitotoxic conditions. Cell Culturing—Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons were prepared from postnatal day 1 rat pups according to approved protocols from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees and procedures published previously (40Dubinsky J.M. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 623-631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, neurons were plated on glass-bottomed Petri dishes without preplated glia as described previously. For all platings, 35 μg/ml uridine plus 15 μg/ml 2-deoxy-5-fluorouridine was added 24 h after plating to inhibit proliferation of non-neuronal cells. Cultures were maintained in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% NuSerum (BD Biosciences) and 27 mm glucose. Transfection of Primary Hippocampal Neurons—To visualize mitochondria within live cells, hippocampal neurons were transfected in suspension during plating using electroporator BTX 630 ECM (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) with a plasmid encoding mitochondrially targeted enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP, generously provided by Dr. Roger Tsien, University of California, San Diego). This procedure usually provided 15–20% transfection efficacy compared with <1% efficacy with commercial cationic lipid liposomes. Neurons were imaged 10–12 days after transfection. Supplemental Fig. 1 demonstrates typical bright field and fluorescence images of cultured hippocampal neurons expressing mito-eYFP at 11 days in vitro. Fluorescence Microscopy—A Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U inverted microscope equipped with objective Nikon CFI Super-Fluor 100× 1.3 NA and Metamorph 6.3 software (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA) were used to visualize neuronal mitochondria targeted with eYFP. In all experiments neurons were perfused using ValveBank 8 perfusion system (AutoMate Scientific, San Francisco). The standard perfusion solution contained 139 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 5 mm glucose, 20 mm sucrose. Neurons were illuminated at 480 ± 20 nm. Fluorescence was collected through a 505 nm dichroic mirror and a 535 ± 25 nm emission filter by a CCD camera CoolSNAPHQ (Photometrics, Tuscon, AZ). Images were taken at room temperature every 15 s during the time course of the experiment. Isolation of Brain, Liver, and Heart Mitochondria—To isolate mitochondria, male Sprague-Dawley rats, 225–250 g (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN), were sacrificed by decapitation according to an approved protocol from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Nonsynaptic mitochondria derived from the single rat brain were isolated in mannitol/sucrose medium and purified on a discontinuous Percoll gradient (37Brustovetsky N. Brustovetsky T. Jemmerson R. Dubinsky J.M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 41Sims N.R. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 698-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Synaptic mitochondria were isolated from synaptosomes by the nitrogen cavitation method using a nitrogen cell disruption bomb, model 4639 (Parr Instrument Co., Moline, IL), cooled on ice (42Brown M.R. Sullivan P.G. Dorenbos K.A. Modafferi E.A. Geddes J.W. Steward O. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2004; 137: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, the synaptosomes obtained during preparation of nonsynaptic mitochondria were transferred in a cooled plastic beaker and placed into the nitrogen bomb on ice under 1,000 psi for 13 min. The synaptosomes were layered on top of the discontinuous Percoll gradient (26/40%) and centrifuged at 31,000 × g for 28 min in a Beckman SW-41 rotor. The mitochondrial fraction in the interface between Percoll layers was transferred into a fresh tube, diluted 1:5 with medium containing 394 mm sucrose, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 31,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of the latter medium and kept on ice. Liver and heart mitochondria were isolated and purified in the same way as nonsynaptic brain mitochondria except the lower level in the discontinuous density gradient contained 60% Percoll (43Brustovetsky N. Dubinsky J.M. Antonsson B. Jemmerson R. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 196-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method (44Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar) with BSA as a standard. Measurements of Light Scattering, Membrane Potential (Δψ), and Mitochondrial Respiration—Mitochondrial swelling was evaluated by following changes in light scattering of mitochondrial suspension at 525 nm with an incident beam under 180° in a 0.3-ml chamber at 37 °C and continuous stirring. Δψ (mitochondrial membrane potential) was monitored by following the distribution of tetraphenylphosphonium cation (TPP+) between the external medium (initially 1.8 μm TPP+-Cl) and the mitochondrial matrix with a TPP+-sensitive electrode (45Kamo N. Muratsugu M. Hongoh R. Kobatake Y. J. Membr. Biol. 1979; 49: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar) in the standard incubation medium containing 125 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm KH2PO4, 0.1% BSA (free from fatty acids) supplemented with 3 mm pyruvate and 1 mm malate unless stated otherwise. Where it is stated, experiments have been performed in hypotonic KCl-based medium (75 mm KCl) or K+-free medium containing either 125 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine or 125 mm choline chloride or 215 mm mannitol plus 70 mm sucrose. A decline in the external TPP+ concentration corresponded to mitochondrial polarization, whereas a rise in the TPP+ concentration in the medium corresponded to depolarization. Mitochondrial respiration was recorded in the standard 125 mm KCl-based incubation medium at 37 °C under continuous stirring. Rat liver mitochondria were incubated with 3 mm glutamate plus 1 mm malate, all other mitochondrial preparations with 3 mm pyruvate plus 1 mm malate. The 0.3-ml incubation chamber was equipped with a Clark-type oxygen electrode and a tightly closed lid. The slope of the O2 electrode trace corresponded to the respiration rate. The representative respiratory traces and averaged respiratory control ratios (the ratio of respiratory rates in the presence of 300 μm ADP and in the presence of 1 μm oligomycin, RCROligo) are shown in supplemental Fig. 2. In all experiments with isolated mitochondria, the concentration of mitochondrial protein in the chamber was 0.1 mg/ml. All data traces shown are representative of at least three separate experiments. Monitoring of Matrix pH—To monitor the matrix pH, mitochondria were loaded with 10 μm 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein-AM in the dark at room temperature for 20 min. Mitochondria were then washed twice in the medium for resuspension. The standard incubation medium was supplemented with 50 mm HEPES to minimize fluctuations of the external pH (46Brand M.D. Brown G.C. Cooper C.E. Bioenergetics: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 39-62Google Scholar). The measurements were performed under continuous stirring in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 55 luminescence spectrometer equipped with a bio-kinetics accessory attachment using excitation/emission wavelengths of 500 and 535 nm, respectively. Transmission Electron Microscopy—Samples for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were taken prior to Ca2+ addition, at the top of mitochondrial swelling, and at the end of recovery as indicated in Fig. 3a. Purified brain mitochondria were incubated in the standard 125 mm KCl-based medium supplemented with 3 mm pyruvate plus 1 mm malate at 37 °C prior to fixation in 2% paraformaldehyde plus 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.05 m phosphate buffer in the same incubation medium at room temperature for 15 min. Mitochondria were then centrifuged at 15,800 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was layered with a fresh solution of 2% paraformaldehyde plus 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer and left overnight at 4 °C. The samples were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h and dehydrated through a series of graded ethyl alcohols before embedding in the resin Embed® 812 (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA). Thick sections were cut on an Ultracut UCT microtome (Leica, Bannockburn, IL), and then thin sections were cut using a diamond knife (Diatome, Electron Microscopy Sciences) at 70–90 nm and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Digital electron micrographs were obtained using a Tecnai G12 BioTwin electron microscope (FEI, Hillsboro, OR) equipped with an AMT 2.6 × 2.6 K digital CCD camera. To quantitatively assess the morphological changes, five different TEM micrographs representing randomly chosen areas in the grid were selected and analyzed in a blinded fashion using the approach described previously (47Scorrano L. Ashiya M. Buttle K. Weiler S. Oakes S.A. Mannella C.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Total mitochondrial population was categorized into three groups according to their morphology as follows: (i) condensed, (ii) swollen, and (iii) orthodox. Mitochondria with characteristics bridging morphologic groups were assigned to the lower category. Mitochondria were counted, and morphological distribution was statistically analyzed using one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's post-test (GraphPad Prism, 4.0). Immunoblotting—Release of mitochondrial apoptogenic proteins, including cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO, Omi/HtrA2, endonuclease G (EndoG), and AIF, was assessed using Western blotting in supernatants obtained through incubation of mitochondria in 75 mm KCl-based medium for 15 min at 37 °C with or without Ca2+. Western blotting was performed as described previously (48Brustovetsky T. Antonsson B. Jemmerson R. Dubinsky J.M. Brustovetsky N. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 980-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). During the course of this project, we found that BSA used in the incubation medium interferes with detection of the released AIF in the supernatants. Therefore, the release of AIF was studied in the BSA-free incubation medium. The release of proteins from mitochondria treated with alamethicin (30 μg/ml) was used as a positive control. However, we could not detect release of EndoG even after treatment of mitochondria with alamethicin. In this case, we used solubilized mitochondria as a positive control. Statistics—Statistical analyses of experimental data consisted of one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's posttest (GraphPad Prism, 4.0, GraphPad Software, San Diego). Data represent mean ± S.E. of at least three separate, independent experiments. Reversible mPT-linked Mitochondrial Remodeling in Cultured Neurons—A brief exposure of cultured neurons expressing mito-eYFP to excitotoxic concentration of glutamate (500 μm, 3 min) resulted in rapid mitochondrial remodeling that in many instances could be interpreted as swelling of organelles. We found similar remodeling in response to high glutamate in all 63 examined individual neurons (57 culture dishes, 9 separate platings). Before glutamate treatment, most of the mitochondria in the neuronal soma appeared as elongated, thread-like structures (Fig. 1a). After incubation with glutamate, many mitochondria looked rounded and presumably swollen (Fig. 1b). MK801 (20 μm), an inhibitor of glutamate/NMDA receptor, prevented glutamate-induced mitochondrial morphological alterations (not shown). After glutamate removal, mitochondria recovered their shape within 30 min in all examined cells (Fig. 1c). Prolonged exposure to high glutamate (500 μm, >5 min) caused irreversible morphological changes. An application of lower glutamate concentration (100 μm, 20 min) evoked variable neuronal responses causing delayed alterations in mitochondrial morphology in some neurons (in 17 of 39 examined cells, 34 dishes, 5 separate platings). In the experiments with neurons treated with 500 μm glutamate for 3 min, preliminary mitochondrial depolarization with carbonylcyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (supplemental Fig. 3), replacing Ca2+ for Sr2+ (supplemental Fig. 4), or omission of Ca2+ in the perfusion buffer (not shown) precluded glutamate-induced morphological changes. Glutamate also failed to change mitochondrial morphology in the presence of 3 μm CsA, an inhibitor of the mPT (Fig. 1, d and e). The lower CsA concentrations (0.5–1 μm) did not provide a distinct and consistent protection. The relatively high CsA concentration was used to overcome CsA binding to cytosolic cyclophilins and ensure a sufficient delivery of CsA to mitochondrial cyclophilin D (49Bernardi P. Petronilli V. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In the presence of 3 μm CsA we did not detect overt changes in mitochondrial morphology in response to glutamate (500 μm glutamate, 3 min) in 35 of 37 examined neurons (36 dishes, 5 separate platings). It has to be mentioned that in our experiments CsA itself influenced mitochondrial appearance making mitochondria look somewhat grainy (Fig. 1d). To distinguish between the action of CsA on the mPT and calcineurin, we used N-methyl-4-isoleucine-cyclosporin (NIM811), a nonimmunosuppressive analog of CsA (generously provided by Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland), which did not inhibit calcineurin (50Waldmeier P.C. Feldtrauer J.J. Qian T. Lemasters J.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). NIM811 (1 μm) prevented glutamate-induced morphological changes in neuronal mitochondria (Fig. 2). In addition, we used cyclosporin H (CsH, 3 μm; Axxora, San Diego) instead of CsA to confirm involvement of the mPT in mitochondrial swelling in cultured neurons. It is known that CsH does not bind well to cyclophilin D, and hence it does not block pore opening (51Griffiths E.J. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In our experiments, CsH appeared to be ineffective in preventing mitochondrial morphological changes in glutamate-treated neurons (supplemental Fig. 5). These data confirmed the role of the mPT in glutamate-induced, Ca2+-dependent remodeling of neuronal mitochondria. Altogether, the observations made with cultured cells suggested that the exposure of neurons to excitotoxic concentration of glutamate resulted in reversible mitochondrial remodeling in situ apparently associated with an induction of the mPT.FIGURE 2NIM811 prevented glutamate-induced morphological changes in neuronal mitochondria. a–c, fluorescent images of the representative cultured hippocampal neuron expressing mitochondrially targeted eYFP. Neurons were preincubated with 1 μm NIM811 for 20 min before glutamate treatment (a). Cells were then treated with 500 μm glutamate and 10 μm glycine for 3 min in the presence of 1 μm NIM811 (b), followed by washing in the glutamate-free solution containing 1 μm NIM811 and 20 μm MK801 for 30 min (c). MK801, an inhibitor of the NMDA-type glutamate receptor, was used during washing to prevent residual activation of the glutamate receptors (38Pivovarova N.B. Nguyen H.V. Winters C.A. Brantner C.A.

Lipid phosphate phosphatase-1 (LPP1) regulates the degradation of extracellular LPA as well as the intracellular accumulation of lipid phosphates. Here we show that increasing the catalytic activity of LPP1 decreased the pertussis toxin-sensitive stimulation of fibroblast migration by LPA and an LPA-receptor agonist that could not be dephosphorylated. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous LPP1 activity increased LPA-induced migration. However, LPP1 did not affect PDGF- or endothelin-induced migration of fibroblasts in Transwell chamber and “wound healing” assays. Thus, in addition to degrading exogenous LPA, LPP1 controls signaling downstream of LPA receptors. Consistent with this conclusion, LPP1 expression decreased phospholipase D (PLD) stimulation by LPA and PDGF, and phosphatidate accumulation. This LPP1 effect was upstream of PLD activation in addition to the possible metabolism of phosphatidate to diacylglycerol. PLD2 activation was necessary for LPA-, but not PDGF-induced migration. Increased LPP1 expression also decreased the LPA-, but not the PDGF-induced activation of important proteins involved in fibroblast migration. These included decreased LPA-induced activation of ERK and Rho, and the basal activities of Rac and Cdc42. However, ERK and Rho activation were not downstream targets of LPA-induced PLD2 activity. We conclude that the intracellular actions of LPP1 play important functions in regulating LPA-induced fibroblast migration through PLD2. LPP1 also controls PDGF-induced phosphatidate formation.

These results shed new light on the roles of LPP1 in controlling wound healing and the growth and metastasis of tumors. It is well established that LPA plays a major physiological and pathological role in controlling cell signaling. LPA is present in biological fluids and activates cells through families of G-protein-coupled receptors (1Tigyi G. Parrill A.L. Prog.

Extracellular LPA is produced in inflammatory conditions by secretory phospholipase A2 acting on PA (3Fourcade O. Simon M.F. Viode C. Rugani N. Leballe F. Ragab A. Fournie B. Sarda L. Chap H. Cell. 1995; 80: 919-927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). LPA is also produced from circulating lysophosphatidylcholine by secreted lysophospholipase D and autotaxin (4Tokumura A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 5Umezu-Goto M. Kishi Y. Taira A. Hama K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Yamori T. Mills G.B. Inoue K. Aoki J. Arai H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Autotaxin stimulates fibroblast migration and division for wound repair (6Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 197-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and its expression shows a positive correlation with tumor progression, angiogenesis, and metastasis (4Tokumura A. Biochim.

Importantly, LPA mimics many effects of autotaxin. Furthermore, LPA concentrations are high in ascites fluid of patients with ovarian tumors (7Shen Z. Wu M. Wiper D.W. Morton R.E. Kennedy A.W. Belinson J. Markman M. Casey G. Xu Y. Clin. Chem. 1997; 43 (577): 577Google Scholar, 9Fang X. Schummer M. Mao M. Yu S. Tabassam F.H. Swaby R. Hasegawa Y. Tanyi J.L. LaPushin R. Eder A. Jaffe R.

Mills G.B. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 1307-1313PubMed Google Scholar). These effects highlight our growing knowledge of the importance of LPA in tissue repair, tumor growth, and metastasis. Consequently, increasing the degradation of extracellular LPA, or attenuating signaling through the LPA receptors can regulate the extracellular actions of LPA. The present work focuses on the effects of the integral membrane protein, lipid phosphate phosphatase-1 (LPP1), which dephosphorylates LPA and other lipid phosphates, and the mechanisms whereby this enzyme modifies fibroblast migration. LPP1 acts partly in the plasma membrane as an ecto-enzyme (11Brindley D.N. J. Cell Biochem. 2004; 92: 900-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 12Sigal Y.J. McDermott M.I. Morris A.J. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). It was originally proposed that this ecto activity explained how LPP1 overexpression attenuated the effects of exogenous LPA in activating cell division, ERK, phospholipase D, and Ca2+ transients (13Jasinska R. Zhang Q.X. Pilquil C. Singh I. Xu J. Dewald J. Dillon D.A. Berthiaume L.G. Carman G.M. Waggoner D.W. Brindley D.N. Biochem.

Prostaglandins. 2001; 64: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies demonstrate that gonadotropin releasing hormone increases LPP expression in the plasma membranes of ovarian cancer cells and that this explains the anti-proliferative effects of gonadotropin releasing hormone on ovarian carcinomas (15Imai A. Furui T. Tamaya T. Mills G.B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 85: 3370-3375Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Overexpression of LPP3 decreases growth, survival, and tumorigenesis of ovarian cancer cells leading to the conclusion that this occurred through the increase in exogenous LPA degradation (16Tanyi J.L. Morris A.J. Wolf J.K. Fang X. Hasegawa Y. Lapushin R. Auersperg N. Sigal Y.J. Newman R.A. Felix E.A. Atkinson E.N. Mills G.B. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1073-1082PubMed Google Scholar). Ovarian cancer cells express decreased levels of LPP1, which could contribute to increases in extracellular LPA and the promotion of transformation (17Tanyi J.L. Hasegawa Y. Lapushin R. Morris A.J. Wolf J.K. Berchuck A. Lu K. Smith D.I. Kalli K. Hartmann L.C. McCune K. Fishman D. Broaddus R. Cheng K.W. Atkinson E.N. Yamal J.M. Bast R.C. Felix E.A. Newman R.A. Mills G.B. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 3534-3545PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this view, overexpressing LPP1 in these cells decreased LPA-induced migration (17Tanyi J.L. Hasegawa Y. Lapushin R. Morris A.J. Wolf J.K. Berchuck A. Lu K. Smith D.I. Kalli K. Hartmann L.C. McCune K. Fishman D. Broaddus R. Cheng K.W. Atkinson E.N. Yamal J.M. Bast R.C. Felix E.A. Newman R.A. Mills G.B. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 3534-3545PubMed Google Scholar). In platelets exogenous LPA increased the expression of ecto-LPP1 activity (18Smyth S.S. Sciorra V.A. Sigal Y.J. Pamuklar Z. Wang Z. Xu Y. Prestwich G.D. Morris A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43214-43223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) thus decreasing net LPA production and LPA-induced shape changes and aggregation. Ecto-LPP activities were also concluded to regulate extracellular LPA accumulation that results in the proliferation of pre-adipocytes (19Simon M.F. Rey A. Castan-Laurel I. Gres S. Sibrac D. Valet P. Saulnier-Blache J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23131-23136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The simplest explanation for these combined results is that the ecto-LPP activities control extracellular LPA concentrations, thereby regulating LPA receptor activation. Although, partly true, other mechanisms of action have been demonstrated. In our fibroblast experiments (13Jasinska R. Zhang Q.X. Pilquil C. Singh I. Xu J. Dewald J. Dillon D.A. Berthiaume L.G.

Alderton et al. (20Alderton F. Darroch P. Sambi B. McKie A. Ahmed I.S. Pyne N. Pyne S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13452-13460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) showed diminished activation of ERK by extracellular LPA, S1P, PA, and thrombin in cells that overexpressed LPP1, -1A, and -2, but not in cells that overexpressed LPP3. The effect on thrombin signaling indicates that ecto-LPP activity is not responsible for attenuating ERK activation, but that this depended upon decreases in intracellular PA concentrations (20Alderton F. Darroch P. Sambi B. McKie A. Ahmed I.S. Pyne N. Pyne S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13452-13460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Subsequent work showed that overexpressing LPP2 and LPP3 increased apoptosis in serum-deprived HEK 293 cells and this correlated with decreased concentrations of PA and S1P in the cells, respectively (21Long J. Darroch P. Wan K.F. Kong K.C. Ktistakis N. Pyne N.J. Pyne S. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Also, HEK 293 cells that overexpress LPP3 exhibited greater DAG formation subsequent to PLD stimulation. PLD2 and LPP3 are both present in caveolin-1-enriched microdomains (22Sciorra V.A. Morris A.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3863-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Zhao et al. (23Zhao Y. Usatyuk P.V. Cummings R. Saatian B. He D. Watkins T. Morris A. Spannhake E.W. Brindley D.N. Natarajan V. Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) also concluded that the effects of LPP1 in inhibiting Ca2+ transients and the secretion of the inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-8, occurred downstream of LPA receptor activation. Furthermore, in vivo studies with LPP1 overexpressing transgenic mice failed to detect alterations in circulating LPA levels (24Yue J. Yokoyama K. Balazs L. Baker D.L. Smalley D. Pilquil C. Brindley D.N. Tigyi G. Cell Signal. 2004; 16: 385-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts from these LPP1 overexpressing mice revealed decreased steady-state levels of PA and a rise in DAG. This work failed to show decreased LPA- and PDGF-induced ERK1/2 activation in fibroblasts from LPP1 overexpressing mice (24Yue J. Yokoyama K. Balazs L. Baker D.L. Smalley D. Pilquil C. Brindley D.N. Tigyi G. Cell Signal. 2004; 16: 385-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, decreased ERK activation by S1P and PDGF was observed in fibroblasts prepared from mice that expressed 20 gene copies for Lpp1, but little effect was seen in fibroblast that expressed two gene copies (25Long J.S. Yokoyama K. Tigyi G. Pyne N.J. Pyne S. Biochem. J. 2006; 394: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We used the latter fibroblasts in some of our studies on migration. Long et al. (25Long J.S. Yokoyama K. Tigyi G. Pyne N.J. Pyne S. Biochem. J. 2006; 394: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) postulated that the effects of LPP1 in decreasing PDGF-induced fibroblast migration in a “wound healing” assay were caused by long-term increases in DAG concentrations and desensitization of PKC-mediated cell signaling. The actions of the LPPs on intracellular PA concentrations can also modify cell signaling because the PA is an important bioactive lipid (see Refs. 11Brindley D.N. J. Cell Biochem. 2004; 92: 900-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar and 12Sigal Y.J. McDermott M.I. Morris A.J. Biochem.

PA also stimulates protein kinase C-ζ, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, and phospholipase C-γ and increases Ras-GTP concentrations (11Brindley D.N. J.

Knockdown of LPP1 activity increased LPA-induced migration, whereas increasing LPP1 activity decreased this migration. Under our experimental conditions, changing LPP1 expression did not affect PDGF- or endothelin-induced migration. The regulation of LPA-induced migration by LPP1 did not depend upon the degradation of exogenous LPA. The inhibitory effect of LPP1 on migration was downstream of LPA-receptor stimulation through its activation of Rho and control of PA formation by PLD2. The latter activity is necessary for the stimulation of Rat2 fibroblast migration by LPA, but not by PDGF.

Fibroblast Culture and Modifying the Expression of LPP1 Activity—We engineered mixed populations of Rat2 fibroblasts that stably overexpress LPP1 by using a retroviral vector and puromycin selection (13Jasinska R. Zhang Q.X. Pilquil C. Singh I. Xu J. Dewald J. Dillon D.A. Berthiaume L.G. Carman G.M. Waggoner D.W. Brindley D.N. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We also employed fibroblasts obtained from transgenic mice that overexpressed 2 copies of the Lpp1 gene (24Yue J. Yokoyama K. Balazs L. Baker D.L. Smalley D. Pilquil C. Brindley D.N. Tigyi G. Cell Signal. 2004; 16: 385-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Catalytically active LPP1 and the inactive R217K mutant (40Zhang Q.X. Pilquil C.S. Dewald J. Berthiaume L.G. Brindley D.N. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) were transiently overexpressed by using adenoviral constructs at 40 multiplicity of infection for 24 h, when new serum-supplemented medium was added and the cells tested 18 h later (23Zhao Y.

Knockdown of LPP1 activity was achieved using double-stranded SMARTpool® siRNAs designed to target rat LPP1 from Dharmacon Inc. (Lafayette, CO). About 500,000 Rat2 fibroblasts were plated on 10-cm plates with DMEM and 10% FBS and allowed to double in number over 24 h. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) was used at 1 × 106 cells to 7 μg of Lipofectamine 2000 with a final concentration of 200 nm siRNAs. Transfection was performed in antibiotic-free medium containing serum according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 4.5 h, the transfection media was replaced with DMEM and 10% FBS. Cells were starved in DMEM and 0.4% BSA 24 h after transfection. For each experiment, controls for LPP1 knockdown were performed with functional non-targeting siCONTROL (Dharmacon) siRNAs, which can silence firefly luciferase, and with Lipofectamine 2000 alone. Total LPP activity was measured using PA in Triton X-100 micelles and ecto-LPP activity was determined by measuring the release of 32Pi from 32P-labeled LPA (13Jasinska R. Zhang Q.X. Pilquil C. Singh I. Xu J. Dewald J. Dillon D.A. Berthiaume L.G. Carman G.M. Waggoner D.W. Brindley D.N. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Detection of mRNA Expression of LPPs—Changes in mRNA concentrations in fibroblasts that were left over from the migration assay were measured by real time reverse transcriptase-PCR using appropriate controls and primers as described previously (41Morris K.E. Schang L.M. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9297-9306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—Cell lysates were collected in buffer that contained 50 mm Hepes, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl, 1 mm CaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, and 1% Sigma protease inhibitor mixture. Sample protein (75 μg) was loaded on 10- and 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels for separating and detecting LPP1 and PLD, respectively. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked overnight in Odyssey Blocking Buffer (LI-COR, Lincoln, NB). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies for mLPP1, PLD1, and PLD2 were diluted 1:1000 in the Odyssey Blocking Buffer supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Transactivation of the PDGFR by LPA was measured by immunoprecipitating 100 μg of sample protein with mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and analyzing the antibody complex from protein A-Sepharose (from GE Healthcare) on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel followed by Western blotting with rabbit polyclonal anti-PDGFR-β diluted 1:1000. For ERK analysis, 30 μg of protein was analyzed using a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel. The membrane was probed simultaneously with rabbit polyclonal anti-ERK1 antibodies, and mouse monoclonal antibodies (both diluted 1:2000) that recognize phosphorylated ERK1/2. Goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to an IRDye800 (Rockland Immunochemica, Gilbertsville, PA) and goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 680 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) fluorescent markers were diluted 1:10,000 and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Fluorescence on the Western blot at 700 and 800 nm was scanned with the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System and quantified with Odyssey software. The phosphorylation of ERK was expressed relative to total ERK. Measurement of PA and DAG Concentrations and PLD Activation—For the measurement of PA formation, 350,000 Rat2 fibroblasts were plated on 10-cm dishes with DMEM and 10% FBS. After 48 h the medium was changed to DMEM that contained 0.4% BSA and 20 μCi of [3H]palmitate. The cells were incubated 18 h when the media was removed and unlabeled DMEM and 0.4% BSA were added to the cells for an additional 2 h. The cells were then treated with agonists for 30 min, and the reactions were stopped by washing twice with ice-cold Hepes-buffered saline. The cells were then collected by scrapping twice in 0.5 ml of methanol. One ml of chloroform and 0.9 ml of 2 m KCl containing 0.2 m HCl were added and the mixtures were vortexed and then centrifuged. The bottom organic phase was isolated and dried under N2 and dissolved in 100 μl of chloroform/methanol (9:1). One half of the sample was used to measure PA levels and the other half was used for the DAG mass assay. For measuring PA concentrations, samples of the lipids were loaded in the middle of plastic-supported Silica Gel 60 thin layer chromatography plates. Plates were developed twice in chloroform/methanol/ammonium hydroxide (65:35:7.5, by volume), and the plates were cut 1 cm above the PA standard. They were then turned upside down, and developed in the reverse direction with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/acetone/water (50:10:12:20:5, by volume). The mass of DAG in the cells was determined by converting it to PA in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and DAG kinase (42Martin A. Duffy P.A. Liossis C. Gomez-Munoz A. O'Brien L. Stone J.C. Brindley D.N. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1571-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The concentration of DAG was determined by using a standard curve prepared with sn-1,2-dioleoylglycerol. The mass of DAG was expressed relative to the total phospholipid content of the cells (42Martin A. Duffy P.A. Liossis C. Gomez-Munoz A. O'Brien L. Stone J.C. Brindley D.N. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1571-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For measurement of PLD activity, 73,000 fibroblasts were plated in DMEM and 10% FBS on 3.5-cm dishes. After 48 h, the medium was changed to 1 ml of DMEM that contained 0.4% BSA and 5 μCi of [3H]palmitate. The cells were incubated 18 h when the media was replaced with unlabeled DMEM plus 0.4% BSA, and the cells were incubated for 2 h. The fibroblasts were then preincubated with 30 mm butan-1-ol for 15 min and then treated with agonists for 6 min so that PLD activity could be measured through the formation of PB. Lipids were extracted, and isolated as for PA above. Samples of the lipids including 50 μg of PB internal standard were loaded on glass-supported Silica Gel 60 thin layer chromatography plates and the plates were developed using the upper organic phase of ethyl acetate/iso-octane/acetic acid/water (130:20:30:100, by volume). Lipids were detected by I2 staining and PB and the total phospholipids near the origin were collected by scrapping. 3H labeling was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Relative PLD activity was calculated as the percentage of PB relative to the labeling of total phospholipids. Fibroblast Migration—For the Transwell assay, about 350,000 cells were plated on 10-cm dishes with DMEM and 10% FBS and no antibiotics. After 24 h the fibroblasts were treated with adenovirus at 40 multiplicity of infection for LPPs and 50 multiplicity of infection for the PLDs or siRNA as indicated. After a further 24 h the cells were starved with DMEM and 0.4% fatty acid-free BSA for 18 h. The cells were collected using trypsin-EDTA and quickly neutralized with trypsin inhibitor. Cells (100,000) in DMEM and 0.4% fatty acid-free BSA were plated inside 6.5-mm diameter Transwell inserts with 8.0-μm pore size polycarbonate filters for 2 h before they were placed in the bottom well. When indicated, 30 mm butan-1-ol or butan-2-ol, 200 nm GW9662, 40 μm PD98059, or 0.1% Me2SO as a vehicle control were added to the Transwell 30 min before the migration started. The bottom wells contained the agonists, DMEM, and 0.4% fatty acid-free BSA supplemented with 0.4% charcoal-treated FBS plus butanol, or inhibitors as indicated. The cells were allowed to migrate for 6 h at which time the top of the filters was cleared by using a wet cotton-tipped applicator followed by a dry one. The migrated cells were then fixed in 5% formaldehyde in Hepes-buffered saline for 30 min. Visualization of the fixed cells on the filters was achieved with a hematoxylin/eosin combination stain, or the nuclei were stained with 1 μg/ml Hoec"
https://openalex.org/W2086697514,"The plant plasma membrane proton pump (H+-ATPase) is stimulated by potassium, but it has remained unclear whether potassium is actually transported by the pump or whether it serves other roles. We now show that K+ is bound to the proton pump at a site involving Asp617 in the cytoplasmic phosphorylation domain, from where it is unlikely to be transported. Binding of K+ to this site can induce dephosphorylation of the phosphorylated E1P reaction cycle intermediate by a mechanism involving Glu184 in the conserved TGES motif of the pump actuator domain. Our data identify K+ as an intrinsic uncoupler of the proton pump and suggest a mechanism for control of the H+/ATP coupling ratio.

K+-induced dephosphorylation of E1P may serve regulatory purposes and play a role in negative regulation of the transmembrane electrochemical gradient under cellular conditions where E1P is accumulating. P-type ATPases constitute a large ubiquitous family of cation pumps characterized by forming a phosphorylated intermediate as part of their catalytic cycle. In most organisms, except plants (1Schachtman D.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 3Very A.A. Sentenac H. Trends. Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 168-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), members of this family are involved in active transport of K+ (4Moller J.V. le Juul B. Maire M.

Examples of P-type K+ pumps are Kdp ATPases from bacterial systems (6Epstein W. Whitelaw V. Hesse J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6666-6668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), K+-ATPases in fungi (7Benito B. Garciadeblas B. Schreier P. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and animal Na+/K+- and H+/K+-ATPases (8Skou J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 23: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar, 9Sachs G. Chang H.H. Rabon E. Schackman R. Lewin M. Saccomani G. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7690-7698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which exchange K+ with either Na+ or H+. The main primary transporter in the plant plasma membrane is the P-type plasma membrane H+-ATPase, an electrogenic proton pump that generates the plasma membrane electrochemical gradient of H+ and the ATP hydrolytic activity of which is stimulated by K+ (10Morsomme P. Boutry M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 11Palmgren M.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 817-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that the plasma membrane proton pump is an H+/K+ counterion ATPase mechanistically similar to the animal Na+/K+-, H+/K+-, and Ca2+/H+-ATPases (12Villalobo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1824-1828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Briskin D.P. Hanson J.B. J. Exp. Bot. 1992; 43: 269-289Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar), but decisive proof for active K+ transport has not been obtained. It therefore seems plausible that K+ could serve other role(s) in the plasma membrane H+-ATPase. During turnover, P-type ATPases alternate between different conformations that have very different structures. A simplified scheme operates with two basal conformations, Enzyme 1 (E1) and Enzyme 2(E2) (14Albers R.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1967; 36: 727-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 15Post R.L. Hegyvary C. Kume S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6530-6540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Phosphorylation from ATP of E1, in which an ion binding site in the membranous region is facing the cytoplasm, results in formation of a phosphorylated pump intermediate, E1P, that is spontaneously converted to E2P, in which the ion is now exposed to the extracellular medium. E2P will become dephosphorylated to produce E2 that spontaneously reverts to E1. According to this model, binding of H+ to plasma membrane H+-ATPase triggers phosphorylation of E1 to form E1P, whereas, in case it was a counterion, binding of K+ to E2P would be expected to trigger dephosphorylation to E2 (16Briskin D.P. Physiol. Plant. 1986; 68: 159-163Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In Na+/K+- and H+/K+-ATPases, uptake of K+ is associated with the E2 to E1 conformational step, which is preceded by dephosphorylation of E2P (17Jorgensen P.L. Hakansson K.O. Karlish S.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 817-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 18Rabon E.C. Reuben M.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The D684N mutant of plasma membrane H+-ATPase is H+ transport-incompetent but can hydrolyze ATP and, as it is defective in the E1P–E2P conformational step, E1P will start to accumulate (19Buch-Pedersen M.J. Venema K. Serrano R. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39167-39173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20Buch-Pedersen M.J. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17845-17851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The E1P intermediate slowly dephosphorylates and returns to E1, which results in Pi release not associated with proton transport (20Buch-Pedersen M.J. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17845-17851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As no inhibitors of E1P–E2P partial reactions are known for plasma membrane H+-ATPases, the D684N mutant serves as a unique tool to investigate partial reactions involving E1P. Unexpectedly, we found that D684N H+-ATPase is hypersensitive to K+. The D684N mutant proved effective for identifying new mutations that are completely insensitive to K+ but otherwise with normal catalytic properties. The study of these mutants has allowed for a detailed characterization of the role of K+ in the ATP hydrolytic mechanism of the proton pump. We demonstrate that K+ has the capacity to induce rapid dephosphorylation of the E1P phosphoform. As transport takes place between the E1 and E2 conformational states, K+-induced dephosphorylation of E1P serves as a pump uncoupling mechanism. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The construction of the wild-type H+-ATPase vector for heterologous expression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as well as the construction of the D684N mutant, has been described (19Buch-Pedersen M.J. Venema K. Serrano R. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39167-39173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Other mutants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using an overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (21Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). All mutated sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. All proteins were expressed without the COOH-terminal 73-amino-acid residues but with a COOH-terminal Met-Arg-Gly-Ser-His6 (MRGSH6) tag. The COOH-terminal deletion transforms the enzyme into a constitutively activated state, simplifying functional studies. The addition of the His6 tag allows affinity purification of recombinant H+-ATPase (22Lanfermeijer F.C. Venema K. Palmgren M.G. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 12: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Expression in Yeast and Protein Affinity Purification—The S. cerevisiae strain RS-72 (23Cid A. Perona R. Serrano R. Curr. Genet. 1987; 12: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) was transformed and cultured essentially as described previously (24Regenberg B. Villalba J.M. Lanfermeijer F.C. Palmgren M.G. Plant Cell. 1995; 10: 1655-1666Google Scholar). Affinity purification of heterologously expressed wild-type and D684N mutant H+-ATPases was performed as described (20Buch-Pedersen M.J. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17845-17851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) except that purified proteins after purification were dialyzed against GMED20 (20% (w/v) glycerol, 100 mm MES 2The abbreviations used are: MES, 2-morpholinoethansulfonic acid; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. (pH 6.5 with N-methyl-d-glucamine), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). ATPase Assay—ATPase activity at 3 mm ATP was determined as described (24Regenberg B. Villalba J.M. Lanfermeijer F.C. Palmgren M.G. Plant Cell. 1995; 10: 1655-1666Google Scholar). The assay was carried out at 30 °C in a buffer (300 μl) containing 20 mm MOPS, 4 mm MgSO4, and 3 mm Tris-ATP. The pH of the buffer was adjusted to pH 6.5 with N-methyl-d-glucamine. The reaction was initiated by the addition of purified membrane protein in reactivation buffer (GMED20 with 10 μg/μl l-phosphatidylcholine and 0.7% (w/v) N-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside). Measurement of ATPase activity at 1 μm ATP was performed at 0 °C in a buffer (300 μl) containing 20 mm MOPS (pH adjusted to 6.5 with N-methyl-d-glucamine), 1 mm MgSO4, and purified protein in reactivation buffer and various cations as indicated. The addition of [γ-32P]ATP to a final concentration of 1 μm initiated the ATP hydrolysis reaction. ATP hydrolysis was stopped by the addition of 6% trichloroacetic acid and 10% (w/v) charcoal. After centrifugation, the amount of liberated inorganic phosphate was determined by scintillation counting. Stability Measurements—Purified proteins in reactivation buffer were incubated 46 °C for 20 min in 20 mm MOPS (pH adjusted to 6.5 with N-methyl-d-glucamine) and either in the absence or in the presence of 50 mm monovalent cation (LiCl, NaCl, or KCl). After heat treatment, proteins were diluted 50 times into buffer containing Tris-ATP (3 mm), 1 mm MgSO4, and 50 mm KCl. The ATP hydrolysis reaction was followed as described above. The activity remaining after 20 min at 46 °C were related to proteins incubated 20 min on ice (100% activity). Reconstitution of H+-ATPases into Artificial Liposomes—To determine the sidedness of the K+ effect, protein was reconstituted at a lipid to protein ratio of 200:1 as described (22Lanfermeijer F.C. Venema K. Palmgren M.G. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 12: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) in 10 mm MES (adjusted to pH 6.5 with N-methyl-d-glucamine), 50 mm Na2SO4 or 50 mm K2SO4, and 20% (v/v) glycerol. Reconstituting wild-type protein with Na+ substituting for K+ consistently resulted in vesicles that were less transport-competent (data not shown). Immediately prior to use, the outside medium of K2SO4 containing vesicles was exchanged by spinning a 100-μl sample (12 μg of protein) through a 2-ml column of Sephadex G50 equilibrated in 10 mm MES (adjusted to pH 6.5 with N-methyl-d-glucamine), 50 mm Na2SO4, and 20% (w/v) glycerol. Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation of the Phosphorylated Intermediate—Phosphorylation by [γ-32P]ATP and dephosphorylation initiated with 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EDTA supplemented 2 mm ADP or various cations were performed as described (19Buch-Pedersen M.J. Venema K. Serrano R. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39167-39173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Protein Determination—Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216377) Google Scholar) employing bovine serum albumin as a standard. The ATP Hydrolytic Activity of the D684N Mutant Is Stimulated to High Values by K+—The only conserved acidic residue in the proton coordination center of plasma membrane H+-ATPase is Asp684 in transmembrane segment 6 (16Briskin D.P. Physiol. Plant. 1986; 68: 159-163Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar)(Fig. 1B). If this residue is coordinating K+ as a counter-transported ligand, a D684N substituted pump would be expected to have reduced K+ sensitivity. The ATP hydrolytic activities of affinity-purified wild-type and mutant D684N plasma membrane H+-ATPase proteins were measured in the presence of various concentrations of KCl (Fig. 2A). Although physiological concentrations of KCl (50 mm) stimulated ATP hydrolysis by the wild-type protein less than 2-fold, KCl stimulated the Asn684 substituted enzyme more than 4-fold when measured at standard conditions (pH = 6.5, 30 °C) (Fig. 2A). K+ stimulated ATPase activity of both the wild-type and the D684N substituted protein with the same apparent Km (1 mm at pH 6.5). The effect of KCl on the D684N substituted enzyme was specific for K+ as other physiologically relevant monovalent cations did not stimulate ATP hydrolysis to the same degree as KCl (Fig. 2B). The effect of monovalent cations on ATP hydrolytic activity of D684N was as the same order (K+ > Rb+ > Na+ > Li+) as seen for wild-type proteins (Fig. 2B) (26Vara F. Serrano R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 257: 12826-12830Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). K+ Does Not Induce E1–E2 Transitions in the D684N Mutant—One explanation for the above finding could be that K+ accelerates transition of E1P into the E2P conformation that in turn is dephosphorylated. Vanadate is a transition state analogue of inorganic phosphate in the E2 conformation of P-type ATPases, and for this reason, vanadate can be used as a conformational probe of P-type ATPases (4Moller J.V. le Juul B. Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). The vanadate sensitivity of ATP hydrolysis was measured for the wild-type and D684N mutant proteins in the absence and in the presence of 50 mm KCl (Fig. 2C). K+ increased the vanadate sensitivity of the wild-type protein (Fig. 2C; Table 1; Ki = 50 μm in the absence of KCl, Ki = 10 μm at 50 mm KCl). However, K+ did not affect the vanadate insensitivity of the D684N mutant protein. Thus we conclude that the stimulatory effect of K+ is not due to an induced E1–E2 transition in the D684N mutant protein.TABLE 1Kinetic properties of plasma membrane H+-ATPase mutant proteinsH+-ATPaseATPase activityaSpecific activity of ATP hydrolysis is expressed as μmol of Pi produced/min/mg of protein in the absence of monovalent cations.Km (ATP)bThe apparent Km for ATP hydrolysis.Ki (vanadate)cThe Ki for vanadate in the presence of 50 mm KCl.pH optimumdThe pH optimum of the ATP hydrolysis reaction.WT22.1 ± 1.964 μm ± 1010 μm≈6.8D617A29.9 ± 1.750 μm ± 1095 μm≈6.8D684N5.3 ± 1.056 μm ± 11Insensitive≈6.4D617A/D684N4.8 ± 1.652 μm ± 5Insensitive≈6.4a Specific activity of ATP hydrolysis is expressed as μmol of Pi produced/min/mg of protein in the absence of monovalent cations.b The apparent Km for ATP hydrolysis.c The Ki for vanadate in the presence of 50 mm KCl.d The pH optimum of the ATP hydrolysis reaction. Open table in a new tab K+ Induces Dephosphorylation of the E1P Phosphoform of the D684N Protein—In P-type ATPases, the E1P phosphoform, but not E2P, is capable of ATP synthesis from ADP and bound phosphate and dephosphorylates to E1 in the presence of ADP (4Moller J.V. le Juul B. Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). As expected for the E1P phosphoform, all of the phosphorylated intermediate accumulating in the D684N mutant of plant H+-ATPase was sensitive toward the application of ADP (Fig. 3A). In the absence of ADP, application of 50 mm KCl triggered dephosphorylation of a large fraction (≈40%) of the E1P phosphoform (Fig. 3A). The K+ effect upon the ATP hydrolytic reaction was intact at the conditions used for investigating the phosphorylated intermediate (i.e. 0 °C, 1 μm ATP) (Fig. 2A). Likewise, monovalent cations induced E1P dephosphorylation to the same degree as they stimulated ATP hydrolysis (K+ > Rb+ > Na+ > Li+; Fig. 3B). Since K+ does not induce an E1–E2 transition in this mutant we conclude that the E1P phosphoform of the D684N mutant is K+-sensitive. An increase in the KCl concentration from 50 to 1000 mm only resulted in a slightly increased degree of E1P dephosphorylation (Fig. 3C), which indicates that K+-induced breakdown of E1P in the D684N mutant is saturable. The remaining EP was still sensitive toward application of ADP, which suggests that it belongs to the E1P pool (Fig. 3A). This indicates the presence of two E1P reaction cycle intermediate populations: one that is K+- and ADP-sensitive and another that is K+-insensitive but ADP-sensitive. The Effect of K+ on Other Asp684 Substituted Enzymes—Like D684N, other substitutions at this site (D684A, D684V, and D684R but not D684E) are blocked in the E1–E2 transition, albeit the phosphorylated intermediate accumulates to various levels and can be purified in the E1 conformation (20Buch-Pedersen M.J. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17845-17851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The degree by which K+ stimulated the ATP hydrolysis reaction was in accordance with the degree of E1P intermediate accumulation (Fig. 3D). This correlation indicates that K+ stimulation of ATP hydrolysis is not a general characteristic of E1 accumulating mutants but rather could be related to the degree of accumulation of the E1P conformational state. K+ Exerts Its Effect from the Cytoplasmic Face of the Enzyme—K+ has been suggested to stimulate ATP hydrolysis from the cytoplasmic side of plasma membrane H+-ATPase (27Gibrat R. Grouzis J.P. Rigaud J. Grignon C. Plant Physiol. 1990; 93: 1183-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To test the sidedness of the K+ effect, detergent-solubilized and purified D684N protein was reconstituted into artificial proteoliposomes. As no ATP is included in the reconstitution buffer, only ATPase reconstituted with its cytoplasmic ATP binding site facing the outside of the vesicles will split ATP. D684N protein was reconstituted into proteoliposomes in the absence of K+, and the phosphorylation reaction was initiated by application of [γ-32P]ATP to the extravesicular medium. K+ efficiently promoted EP breakdown under these conditions (Fig. 4A), suggesting that binding of K+ occurs to the same part of the ATPase as does ATP, i.e. to the cytoplasmic side of the pump. Reconstitution in the presence of K+ with subsequent removal of K+ from the extravesicular medium resulted in relatively stable EP intermediate that could be triggered to dephosphorylate by the addition of K+ to the extravesicular medium (Fig. 4A). Monovalent Cation Stimulation Is Lost in D617A/D684N Double Substituted Enzymes—The cytoplasmic part of P-type ATPases is subdivided into the A (actuator), N (nucleotide binding), and P (phosphorylation) domains (28Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar, 29Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). We hypothesized that K+ facilitates water attack in the P domain either by directly changing the geometry of the covalently bound phosphate or, alternatively, by indirectly influencing the phosphate geometry trough induction of a conformational change. In a homology model of AHA2 plasma membrane H+-ATPase (30Bukrinsky J.T. Buch-Pedersen M.J. Larsen S. Palmgren M.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the P domain is comprised of residues 308–337 and 491–622. Negatively charged amino acid moieties are often found in context with monovalent cation binding sites (31Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1305-1308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and to investigate whether residues in the phosphorylation domain of the H+-ATPase mediate the K+ response, 8 conserved H+-ATPase acidic residues (Glu318, Asp492, Glu520, Glu556, Asp559, Asp600, Asp610, and Asp617) were selected for mutagenic analysis (Fig. 1B). Conserved residues that in related P-type pumps are essential for the catalytic mechanism had already been excluded. All mutations were introduced into the D684N mutant H+-ATPase background, and the corresponding proteins were expressed in yeast and affinity-purified (data not shown). Monovalent cations (K+ > Na+ > Li+) stimulated release of Pi in the ATPase assay from the E318A/D684N, D492A/D684N, E520A/D684N, E556A/D684N, D559A/D684N, D600A/D684N, and D610/D684N double mutants (Fig. 4B). However, in the D617A/D684N mutant, both the stimulation effect of K+ on ATP hydrolytic activity (Fig. 4B) and the K+-induced E1P dephosphorylation (Fig. 4C) were completely lost. The D617A/D684N double mutant resembled the D684N single point substituted enzyme with respect to pH optimum for ATP hydrolysis and specific activity in the absence of K+ (Table 1). Furthermore, the lost K+ effect was apparent at all pH values investigated (pH 5.5, 6.5, and 7.2; Fig. 5), ruling out an effect of H+ competing out K+. To test the hypothesis that Asp617 is essential for mediating the K+ effect, a single D617A substituted protein was produced. As expected, K+ stimulation of ATP hydrolytic activity was lost in the D617A mutant at all pH values determined (Fig. 5), and the pH optimum for ATP hydrolysis resembled that of the wild-type protein (Table 1). In contrast to the wild-type protein, K+ did not influence the vanadate sensitivity of the D617A substituted enzyme (Fig. 2C). The specific activity of the D617A single point substituted pump was found higher than the unmodified wild-type protein (Table 1). Glu184 in the A domain Is Necessary for Uncoupled Dephosphorylation of E1P—Biochemical and structural data have demonstrated that the A domain of P-type ATPases undergoes substantial domain movements during catalysis (17Jorgensen P.L. Hakansson K.O. Karlish S.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 817-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 32Moller J.V. Nissen P. le Sorensen T.L. Maire M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 33Toyoshima C. Inesi G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 269-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In the A domain of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1a), Glu183 in the conserved P-type ATPase signature motif TGESis essential for dephosphorylation of EP (34Clarke D. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14088-14092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Wang G. Ymasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26508-26516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the plasma membrane H+-ATPase, the corresponding residue is Glu184 (Fig. 1B). We generated E184A mutations in the wild-type and D684N mutant backgrounds to investigate whether the phosphatase function of the A domain is required in the plasma membrane H+-ATPase for dephosphorylation of E1P. Neither E184A nor E184A/D684N substituted enzymes exhibited any detectable Pi release in the ATPase assay (Fig. 6A), and both mutant proteins accumulated to a high degree in the EP phosphorylated state (Fig. 6A). This indicates the buildup of stable EP forms. A major fraction (≈65%) of the EP pool of the E184A single substituted protein was insensitive to ADP, suggesting accumulation of the E2P phosphointermediate (Fig. 6B). Accumulation of E2P in response to mutations in the TGES motif is in accordance with results obtained in other pumps (35Clausen J.D. Vilsen B. McIntosh D.B. Einholm A.P. Andersen J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2776-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In contrast herewith, the phosphoprotein that formed in the E184A/D684N double substituted enzyme was highly sensitive toward ADP (Fig. 6B), which indicates that the E1P conformational state accumulates in this mutant. K+ had no effect on breakdown on EP in either E184A or E184A/D684N substituted proteins, which is strong evidence that the phosphatase activity of the A domain is required for K+-induced dephosphorylation of the E1P phosphointermediate. K+ Binding to Asp617 Provides Protection to the H+-ATPase against Thermal Inactivation—If a role of K+ is to promote domain interactions in the pump protein, e.g. between the P domain and the A domain, it could be expected that K+ has a positive effect on enzyme stability. Indeed, it was found that monovalent cations protected wild-type and D684N H+-ATPase against thermal inactivation (Fig. 7). The substitution of Asp617, to abolish the K+ binding site, lead to a loss of K+ protection against thermal inactivation (Fig. 7). This was seen for both D617A and D617A/D684N mutant proteins, indicating that K+ binding to Asp617 not only influences enzyme turnover reactions but also affects overall protein stability. Na+ also influenced wild-type and D684N protein stability positively (Fig. 7), indicative that the protective effect of K+ against thermal inactivation is less specific than its effect on the ATP hydrolytic reaction (Fig. 2B). K+ Stimulation of Plasma Membrane H+-ATPase Involves Asp617 Situated in a Cytoplasmic Domain—In this study, we show that in a E1P–E2P conformationally blocked plasma membrane H+-ATPase, K+ stimulates dephosphorylation of the E1P phosphointermediate. Following the substitution of Asp617 in the cytoplasmic phosphorylation domain, K+ stimulation of Pi release and K+-induced E1P dephosphorylation were completely lost. Asp617 is not situated in transmembrane segments that facilitate ion transfer, but is predicted to be close to the aspartyl phosphate group at Asp329 (30Bukrinsky J.T. Buch-Pedersen M.J. Larsen S. Palmgren M.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). The fact that the K+ effect is completely lost when substituting a single negatively charged residue, without having other measurable effects on H+-ATPase kinetics, strongly suggests a stoichiometry of 1 K+ bound per pump molecule. In a typical plant cell, the cytoplasmic concentration of K+ exceeds 50 mm, which indicates that the K+ binding site (apparent Km = 1mm) will be occupied under normal conditions. Asp617 Is Part of a Conserved P-type ATPase K+ Binding Site—The activities of Ca2+- and Na+/K+-ATPases are both stimulated by cytoplasmic monovalent cations (37Romero P.J. Romero E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 778: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 39Yoda S. Yoda A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1147-1152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further, using fast kinetic analysis, K+ has been demonstrated to affect the EP conformations of the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (40Herscher C.J. Rega A.F. Adamo H.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and the plasma membrane H+-ATPase (41Briskin D.P. Plant Physiol. 1988; 88: 84-91Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the mechanism is not clarified, it appears that cytoplasmic K+ promotes dephosphorylation of P-type Ca2+-, Na+/K+, and H+-ATPase phosphoenzymes. This demonstrates that a K+ effect on pump dephosphorylation is a general phenomenon in P-type ATPases. In sequence alignments (the P-type ATPase data base), Asp617 in the plant plasma membrane H+-ATPase AHA2 corresponds to Glu732 in sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase SERCA1a. A K+ binding site that involves Glu732 (SERCA1a) has recently been identified in crystal structures of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (42Sørensen T.L.M. Clausen J.D. Jensen A.L. Vilsen B. Møller J.V. Andersen J.P. Nissen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46355-46358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). K+ coordinating groups at this site involves oxygen atoms derived from the negatively charged Glu732 (SERCA1a) and three oxygen atoms in backbone carbonyl residues (Leu711, Lys712, and Ala714 in SERCA1a). Mutation of Glu732 in the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase reduces the rate of phosphoenzyme dephosphorylation in the presence of K+. A negative charge is present at an equivalent position in many P-type ATPases, which indicates the presence of a conserved K+ binding site in the P domain of P-type ATPases. It is an attractive hypothesis that binding of K+ to this site promotes pump dephosphorylation in the same P-type pumps. Mutational Evidence for Potassium-sensitive and Potassium-insensitive E1P Conformational States—We found that the complete E1P pool is ADP-sensitive, whereas only part of the E1P pool is K+-sensitive. This is compatible with the presence of two different E1P phosphoforms, in only one of which does K+ induce a rapid discharge of the covalently bound phosphate. In E1–E2 conformationally blocked Na+/K+-ATPase, an ADP- and K+-sensitive E1P intermediate (termed E1P*) has been described (39Yoda S. Yoda A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1147-1152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Yoda A. Yoda S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10320-10325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The E1P* of this enzyme is sensitive toward application of cytoplasmic K+ and is a conversion product between E1P (ADP-sensitive) and E2P (ADP-insensitive, K+-sensitive) (39Yoda S. Yoda A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1147-1152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Yoda A. Yoda S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10320-10325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The E1P* intermediate of the Na+/K+-ATPase could resemble the K+-sensitive form of E1Pinthe plasma membrane H+-ATPase. Mechanism of the K+ Effect on Pump Dephosphorylation—Our finding that K+ positively influences the stability of purified H+-ATPase supports a model in which K+ induces a compact conformation of the protein. Crystal structures of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase have demonstrated that the A domain undergoes substantial movement and rotates during the E1–E2 conformational step (32Moller J.V. Nissen P. le Sorensen T.L. Maire M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 33Toyoshima C. Inesi G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 269-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Linker regions between the membranous region and the A domain direct this rotation, the purpose of which is to bring the TGES motif in the A domain in close proximity to the aspartyl phosphate group in the P domain. It has been proposed that K+ bound to the P domain assists in attracting the linker regions connected to the A domain (42Sørensen T.L.M. Clausen J.D. Jensen A.L. Vilsen B. Møller J.V. Andersen J.P. Nissen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46355-46358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In support of this model, the effect of K+ bound to the P domain at Asp617 was completely lost in mutants carrying substitutions at Glu184 (in the sequence TGES) in the A domain. The negative charge of the conserved TGES motif in the A domain has been suggested to interact with the water molecule that attacks the phosphoryl group (32Moller J.V. Nissen P. le Sorensen T.L. Maire M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 35Clausen J.D. Vilsen B. McIntosh D.B. Einholm A.P. Andersen J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2776-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The simplest hypothesis in accordance with our data is that K+ accelerates docking of the A domain to the P domain, and in this way, promotes A domain-catalyzed decay of the phosphoryl group situated in the P domain. According to this model, K+ is not an uncoupler of the H+-ATPase per se, which would require that it specifically dephosphorylates E1P, but rather, it has the capacity to stimulate dephosphorylation of both the E1P and the E2P phosphoenzymes. What determines whether K+ acts as an uncoupler or not is the time the enzyme spends in the E1P conformation before it proceeds to the E2P conformation. If the E1P–E2P transition is very fast, and faster than A domain movements, E2P will be dephosphorylated by the A domain, and the K+ effect will be seen as stimulation of coupled pump turnover. If the conformational transition is slow, the A domain moves in before the E1P–E2P transition, and K+ will act as a pump uncoupler. This could be the case if the membrane potential is close to the reversal potential of the pump. In such a situation, K+-induced dephosphorylation of E1P would act as a safety valve. Regulation of P-type ATPases by Cytoplasmic K+—An important question that arises is why a mechanism has developed that potentially allows K+ to dephosphorylate E1Pina way that uncouples ATP hydrolysis from transport. Uncoupling has been described in several P-type ATPases and appears to be an inherent property of these pumps (44Berman M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1513: 95-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that proton transport and ATP hydrolysis in plasma membrane H+-ATPase are partially uncoupled in the resting state (45Venema K. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19659-19667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 47Baunsgaard L. Venema K. Axelsen K.B. Villalba J.M. Welling A. Wollenweber B. Palmgren M.G. Plant J. 1996; 10: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Yeast and plant plasma membrane H+-ATPases are controlled by an autoinhibitory COOH-terminal regulatory domain (11Palmgren M.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 817-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Following relief of this constraint, e.g. by post-translational regulatory processes, proton transport is typically stimulated to a much higher degree than ATP hydrolysis (45Venema K. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19659-19667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 47Baunsgaard L. Venema K. Axelsen K.B. Villalba J.M. Welling A. Wollenweber B. Palmgren M.G. Plant J. 1996; 10: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This would suggest that post-translational activation involving the regulatory domain is linked to the onset of strict coupling. The found connection between the K+ binding site and the phosphorylated aspartic acid could represent a mechanism controlling the coupling ratio depending on the activation state of the pump molecule. K+-induced dephosphorylation of E1P may thus well serve regulatory purposes and play a role in negative regulation of the transmembrane electrochemical gradient under cellular conditions where E1P is accumulating. As a shift in conformational equilibrium between E1 and E2 is likely to determine the extent of the K+ effect, any effector that influences this equilibrium would in turn control the coupling state of the pump.

However, the molecular determinants driving the subunit interaction and assembly of the TRPM2 channels are not well defined. Here we examined, using site-directed mutagenesis in conjunction with co-immunoprecipitation and patch clamp recording, the role of a coiled-coil domain in the intracellular C terminus of TRPM2 subunit in subunit interaction and channel assembly. Deletion of the coiled-coil domain resulted in severe disruption of the subunit interaction and substantial loss of the adenosine diphosphoribose-evoked channel currents. Individual or combined mutations to glutamine of the hydrophobic residues at positions a and d of the abcdef heptad repeat, key residues for protein-protein interaction, significantly reduced the subunit interaction and channel currents; the mutational effects on the subunit interaction and channel currents were clearly correlated. Furthermore, deletion of the coiled-coil domain in a pore mutant subunit abolished its dominant negative phenotypic functional suppression. These results provide strong evidence that the coiled-coil domain is critically engaged in the TRPM2 subunit interaction and such interaction is required for assembly of functional TRPM2 channel.

They are subdivided into TRPC, TRPV, TRPM, TRPP, TRPML, and TRPA subfamilies based on sequence relatedness (2Clapham D.E. Nat. Rev.

All the TRP family proteins, including TRPM2, have a membrane topology similar to the voltage-gated potassium channels, calcium-activated channels, and cyclic nucleotide-gated channels; each subunit comprises six transmembrane segments (S1-S6), a pore loop between the S5 and S6, and intracellular N and C termini (2Clapham D.E.

Unique to the TRPM2 subunit, the distal C-terminal part shares substantial homology to the NUDT9 proteins (thus termed NUDT9-H domain). Between the TRP motif and NUDT9-H domain is a region showing a strong propensity for coiled-coil formation (Fig. 1A). TRPM2 channels presumably form tetramers like the TRPV channels (20Kedei N. Szabo T. Lile J.D. Treanor J.J. Loah Z. Iadarola M.J. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28613-28619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 22Hoendrop J.G.J.

Despite the overall structural similarity, studies on the TRPV subfamily have rather surprisingly revealed distinct molecular domains within different locations that mediate TRPV subunit interaction and channel assembly. Thus, for example, a C-terminal coiled-coil domain located immediately after S6 directs the subunit interaction and tetramerization of the TRPV1 channel (23Garcia-Sanz N. Fernandez-Carvajal A.

Albrecht N. Harteneck C. Schultz G. Schaefer M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). For the TRPV4 channel, the N-terminal ankyrin domains play a key role in subunit multimerization (25Arniges M. Fernandez-Fernandez J.M. Albrecht N. Schaefer M. Valverde M.A. J. Biol.

Van de Gyftogianni E. Graaf S.F.J. Hoefs S. Weidema F.A. Bindels R.J.M. Hoenderop J.G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54304-54311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Compared with the TRPV channels, the molecular domains mediating the subunit interaction and assembly of TRPM channels (and other TRP subfamilies) are less clear. A previous study implied a role of the C terminus in the subunit interaction and assembly of the functional TRPM4 channel (27Launay P. Cheng H. Srivatsan S. Penner R. Fleig A. Kinet J.P. Science. 2004; 306: 1374-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Coiled-coil, a common protein-protein interaction domain (28Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J.

Blanz J. Beck C. Jentsch T.J. Saftig P. Friedrich T. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 3757-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the TRPV1 channel (23Garcia-Sanz N. Fernandez-Carvajal A.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5307-5313Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and very recently the TRPM8 channel (32Tsuruda P.R. Julius D. Minor D.L. Neuron. 2006; 51: 201-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Here, by using molecular biology in conjunction with biochemistry and electrophysiology approaches, we provide evidence to indicate that the C-terminal coiled-coil domain is engaged in the subunit interaction and assembly of the TRPM2 channel. Cell and Molecular Biology—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C under 5% CO2 humidified conditions. Transient transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The cDNA encoding the hTRPM2 protein with a C-terminal Glu-Glu (or EE) epitope tag (EYMPME) was subcloned in pcDNA3 vector in a previous study (33Mei Z.Z. Mao H.J. Jiang L.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: C1022-C1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The plasmid expressing a C-terminal FLAG-tagged hTRPM2 protein was made as follows. The sequence from the initiation codon to the SfiI site (fragment A) of the TRPM2 subunit was amplified using a forward primer (5′-ATG GAG CCC TCA GCC CTG AGG AAA GC) and a reverse primer (5′-GCG CTC GTT GTG GAT GAG G), and the sequence from the SfiI site to the stop codon (fragment B) was amplified using a forward primer (5′-GTG TGG GTG GTG TCC TTC) and a reverse primer (5′-AAAC TCA CTT GTC ATC GTC GTC CTT GTA GTC TCT AGA GTA GTG AGC CCC GG; the underlined sequence for the FLAG tag). The PCR products were separately inserted into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen). The fragment A was excised using HindIII and SfiI, and the fragment B using SfiI and EcoRV, and then ligated with pcDNA 3.1/Myc-His/A vector (Invitrogen), which was prior restricted using HindIII and PmeI. The C-terminal c-Myc-tagged TRPM2 construct was made using similar protocols. Deletion of the coiled-coil domain (residues from 1167 to 1201) was performed by overlapping extension PCR (34Jiang L.H. Gawler D.J. Hodson N. Milligan C.J. Pearson H.A. Porter A. Wray D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6135-6143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange II protocols (Stratagene). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Electrophysiological Recording—As previously described, whole cell recordings were carried out using an Axopatch 200B amplifier at room temperature (32Tsuruda P.R. Julius D. Minor D.L. Neuron. 2006; 51: 201-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Patch pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass capillaries with a resistance of 4-6 MΩ. Extracellular solutions contained 147 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 13 mm glucose. Intracellular solution contained 147 mm NaCl, 50 μm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm ATP, and 1 mm ADPR. Cells were held at -40 mV, and voltage ramps from -120 mV to 80 mV with 1-s duration were applied every 5-10 s. Recordings started before changing the cell-attached configuration into whole cell configuration, seen as an increase in the transient capacitance currents at the beginning and the end of the voltage ramp, and thus no capacitance and resistance compensation was made. Flufenamic acid (0.5 mm) was used via a rapid solution changer RSC-160 system (Biologic Science Instruments). Co-immunoprecipitation, Biotin Labeling, and Western Blotting—These experiments were performed as detailed previously (33Mei Z.Z. Mao H.J. Jiang L.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: C1022-C1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In brief, human embryonic kidney 293 cells were prepared in a T25 flask (∼3 × 106 cells), transfected with 3 μg of plasmid, and used 24 h later. For co-immunoprecipitation, cells were collected and lysed in 300 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 5% glycerol) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C for 30 min. After being cleared by centrifugation, the cell lysates were mixed with 3 μl of anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) and then incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. Upon addition of 20 μl of Protein A/G-agarose bead suspension (Santa Cruz), the mix continued to incubate overnight. Following extensive washing with the lysis buffer, the agarose beads were resuspended in 40 μl of electrophoresis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue). Protein in the cell lysates or immunoprecipitated samples were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred onto nitrocellular membranes, and detected using mouse anti-FLAG M2 (1:1000; Sigma), rabbit anti-EE (1:2000; Bethyl), or mouse anti-c-Myc antibody (1:500; Santa Cruz) primary antibodies, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (1:2000; Santa Cruz). Proteins were visualized using a Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescence system (Pierce), and the protein intensities were quantified using a gel doc XR quantity system (Bio-Rad). The subunit interaction was determined by the intensity of the EE-tagged wild type subunit co-immunoprecipitated with the FLAG-tagged mutant subunits, normalized to the intensity of the EE-tagged wild type subunit co-immunoprecipitated with the FLAG-tagged wild type subunit. The variation in the protein expression level was corrected by normalizing the intensity of the mutant subunits to that of the parental wild type subunit in each parallel experiment. For biotin labeling, cells were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered solution (136 mm NaCl, 1.4 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.7 mm KH2PO4, pH 8.0) and incubated in phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 1 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) for 30 min at 4 °C. Then the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 mm glycine and lysed in 300 μl of lysis buffer (see above) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C for 30 min. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma), and the immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting as described above using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:1000; Pierce) and mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody (1:1000; Sigma) to detect the proteins at the cell surface and the total amount of proteins, respectively. Immunostaining—Cells were fixed in Zamboni's fixative at room temperature for 30 min. For double staining of TRPM2 and calreticulin (a endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein marker), cells expressing the FLAG-tagged wild type or [ΔC] subunit, after being permeabilized with 2% Triton X-100 and blocked with 5% goat serum, were incubated with mouse anti-calreticulin antibody (1:500; Stressgen) at 4 °C overnight and then with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:500; Sigma) for 2 h. After being extensively rinsed, the cells were incubated with a rabbit anti-FLAG antibody (1:500; Sigma) for 3-4 h at room temperature and then with a TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:500; Sigma) for 2 h. For double staining of FLAG-tagged TRPM2 and TGN46 (a trans-Golgi network protein), cells expressing the FLAG-tagged wild type or [ΔC] subunits, after being permeabilized with Triton X-100 and blocked with 5% donkey serum (Sigma), were incubated with a sheep anti-TGN46 antibody (1:400) at 4 °C overnight and then with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-sheep IgG antibody (1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 2 h. After being extensively rinsed, the cells were incubated with a mouse anti-FLAG antibody (1:500; Sigma) for 3-4 h at room temperature and then with a TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:500; Sigma) for 2 h. For double staining of c-Myc-tagged wild type and FLAG-tagged [ΔC] mutant TRPM2 proteins, cells were permeabilized with Triton X-100 and blocked with 5% goat serum (Sigma). Cells co-expressing c-Myc-tagged wild type and FLAG-tagged [ΔC] mutant subunits were incubated with a mouse anti-c-Myc antibody (1:80; Santa Cruz.) at 4 °C overnight and then with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:500; Sigma) for 2 h. After being extensively rinsed, the cells were incubated with a rabbit anti-FLAG antibody (1:500; Sigma) for 3-4 h at room temperature and then with a TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:500; Sigma). The images were captured using a Zeiss AxioVert 200M confocal microscope and LSM510 META software. All data, where appropriate, are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was carried out using Student's t test. TRPM2 Coiled-coil Domain Mediates Subunit Interaction—Analysis of the TRPM2 subunit sequence using the coiled-coil domain prediction program (www.ch.embnet.org) indicates that a stretch of residues in the C terminus between the TRP motif and the NUDT9-H domain (Gly1171 to Ala1200 in the human TRPM2 subunit; Fig. 1A) exhibit a strong probability of coiled-coil formation. To determine the potential role of this coiled-coil domain in the TRPM2 channel, we first generated a mutant subunit in which the coiled-coil domain was deleted ([ΔC] mutant subunit). The total protein expression level of the [ΔC] mutant subunit was virtually the same as the parental wild type subunit determined by Western blotting (Fig. 1C), but the surface expression level was about half of the wild type subunit shown by biotin-labeling assay (Fig. 1D). As shown by double labeling with antibodies against calreticulin (an endoplasmic reticulum or ER protein) or TGN46 (a trans-Golgi network protein), the TRPM2 proteins were strongly co-localized with calreticulin (Fig. 1E) but lacked noticeable co-localization with TGN46 (Fig. 1F). These results suggest that deletion of the coiled-coil domain seems to not significantly alter the targeting of the TRPM2 protein from the ER to the plasma membrane. For multisubunit channels, reduction in the surface expression could result alternatively from defects in assembly of multisubunit protein complex. Subunit interaction is the first step in the assembly of multisubunit channel. To address the possible role of the coiled-coil domain in the TRPM2 subunit interaction, C-terminal FLAG-tagged [ΔC] mutants were co-expressed with C-terminal EE-tagged wild type subunit or with C-terminal c-Myc-tagged [ΔC] mutant, and the subunit interaction was examined by co-immunoprecipitation. The interactions between wild type and [ΔC] mutant subunits were severely disrupted (Fig. 2A); the average residual subunit interaction was <20% of the interaction between two wild type subunits (Fig. 2B). The interaction between two mutant subunits was also dramatically attenuated (Fig. 2C), and the reduction was slightly greater than that seen between wild type and mutant subunits (data not shown). In cells co-expressing wild type and mutant subunits, double staining shows strong co-localization rather than segregate distribution of two subunits (Fig. 2D), suggesting that loss of co-immunoprecipitation was due to reduced interaction between wild type and mutant subunits rather than potential preferential homo-subunit interaction. All these results indicate that the coiled-coil domain is important in the TRPM2 subunit interaction. The canonical coiled-coil domain comprises heptad repeats denoted by abcdefg where the positions a and d are preferably occupied by hydrophobic residues and are important to the protein-protein interaction (28Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3471) Google Scholar, 29Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Therefore, to testify further the importance of the coiled-coil domain in the TRPM2 subunit interaction, we introduced substitutions of these hydrophobic residues (Fig. 1B) in the FLAG-tagged TRPM2 subunit with the hydrophilic residue glutamine, co-expressed the resultant mutant subunit with the EE-tagged wild type subunit, and performed co-immunoprecipitation to assess the mutational effect on the subunit interaction. Fig. 3 shows the results. Similar to the co-expression of deletion mutant and wild type subunits, co-expression of any of the FLAG-tagged point mutants with EE-tagged wild type subunit resulted in no significant alteration in the protein expression level for both proteins. However, as expected, mutation of each of these hydrophobic residues (Leu1177, Leu1180, Val1184, Leu1191, Ile1194, and Leu1198) indeed strongly reduced the subunit interaction, although the reduction was variable (the order of the potency: Ilu1194 >Leu1180 >Leu1198 >Leu1177 ≥Leu 1191 ≥Val1184). In contrast, substitution of the hydrophilic residue Thr1187, which was predicted not to alter the coiled-coil formation, had no effect on the subunit interaction (Fig. 3), arguing against the possibility that the effects of mutating the hydrophobic residues on the subunit interaction were nonspecific. We then introduced combined mutations in the four most outstanding positions (Ilu1194, Leu1180, Leu1198, and Leu1177) to see to what extent mutation of these residues could mimic the effect of the [ΔC] mutant. The double mutants have substitutions in two close ([L1177/L1180] and [I1194/L1198]) or distant ([L1177/L1194] and [L1177/L1198]) positions, the triple mutants contain additional substitution in distant positions ([L1177/L1180/I1194], [L1177/L1180/L1198], [L1177/I1194/L1198] and [L1180/I1194/L1198]), and the quadruple mutant includes mutations of all the four residues. Introduction of two substitutions enhanced the reduction in the subunit interaction. Of all the triple and quadruple mutants, the subunit interaction was not different from that of the [ΔC] mutant subunit (Fig. 3C). These results clearly strengthen the argument that the C-terminal coiled-coil domain plays an important role in mediating the TRPM2 subunit interaction. Coiled-coil Domain Is Important for Functional TRPM2 Channel Assembly—Subunit interaction is the prerequisite for functional channel assembly. Thus, we next investigated whether the subunit interaction mediated by the coiled-coil domain is essential for the assembly of functional TRPM2 channel. We used whole cell patch clamp recording to measure ADPR-evoked TRPM2 channel currents, a functional assay widely used in similar studies of other ion channels (e.g. 23, 27, 30-32, 36, 37). Robust TRPM2 channel currents were rapidly evoked by a supermaximal concentration of ADPR (1 mm) (10Kolisek M. Beck A. Fleig A. Penner R. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 17Beck A. Kolisek M. Bagley L.A. Fleig A. Penner R. FASEB J. 2006; 20: E47-E54Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and blocked by flufenamic acid as expected for the TRPM2 channels (33Mei Z.Z. Mao H.J. Jiang L.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: C1022-C1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 35Hill K. Benham C.D. McNulty S. Randall A.D. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 47: 450-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We first compared the ADPR-evoked currents in cells expressing the wild type channel or the [ΔC] mutant channel. The ADPR-evoked currents were readily detected in cells expressing the [ΔC] mutant channel. However, the average current amplitude was substantially smaller than that of the wild type channel recorded in parallel experiments (Fig. 4). The decrease in the current amplitude was ∼75%, approximating the decrease seen in the subunit interaction (Fig. 2). We performed another set of experiments to compare the currents evoked by 1 and 3 mm ADPR in cells expressing the wild type or [ΔC] mutant channel. The currents evoked by 1 mm ADPR (WT, 4382 ± 238 pA, n = 3; [ΔC], 709 ± 322 pA, n = 8) reached the maximal values at both the wild type and mutant channels, as there was no significant increase in currents evoked by 3 mm ADPR (WT, 3805 ± 505 pA, n = 3; [ΔC], 650 ± 197, n = 5; in both cases p >0.3). In addition, the mutant channel showed a typical current voltage (I/V) relationship like the wild type channel (Fig. 4A). These results indicate that the agonist sensitivity and the I/V relationship are not responsible for the reduced currents. Fig. 5 summarizes the ADPR-evoked currents recorded in cells expressing the point mutant channels. The current amplitude for single mutant channel [L1177Q], [1180Q], [I1194Q], or [L1198Q] was significantly reduced compared with that of the wild type channel. The current amplitude for the [L1191Q] mutant channel showed a tendency of reducing but the reduction was not statistically significant, whereas there was no difference between the [V1184Q] mutant and the wild type channels. Thus, the order of potency of reducing the expression of the functional TRPM2 channels is: Leu1180 ∼Leu1198 >Leu1177 ≥Ile1194 >Leu1191 ∼Val1184. Of notice, both biochemical and functional approaches unequivocally identified Leu1177, Leu1180, Ile1194, and Leu1198 as the most important residues (Figs. 3C and 5B), although the orders were slightly different. The mean ADPR-evoked current of the [T1187Q] mutant channel was not significantly different from that of the wild type channel, again in line with the lack of effect on the subunit interaction. Combined mutations of the most outstanding four hydrophobic residues caused further decrease in the ADPR-evoked currents; there were no significant differences between the triple and quadruple mutant channels and the wild type channel (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, there was clear correlation between the mutational effects on the subunit interaction and the ADPR-evoked channel currents (Fig. 5C). Thus, the biochemical and functional results are consistent with the notion that the coiled-coil domain is critical in mediating the TRPM2 subunit interaction and in the assembly of the functional TRPM2 channel. Deletion of the Coiled-coil Domain Removes Functional Suppression of the TRPM2 Subunit Carrying a Phenotypic Pore Mutation—Mutation of the completely conserved residue Cys996 in the pore region of the TRPM2 subunit (Fig. 1A) confers dominant negative phenotypic functional suppression (33Mei Z.Z. Mao H.J. Jiang L.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: C1022-C1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To seek further evidence for the role of the coiled-coil domain in the TRPM2 subunit interaction and channel assembly, we asked whether deletion of the coiled-coil domain can abolish the functional suppression by C996S mutation. A similar approach was successfully applied in previous studies to attest to the role of the coiled-coil domains in the assembly of the large conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (38Quirk J.C. Reinhart P.H. Neuron. 2001; 31: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and the TRPV1 channel (23Garcia-Sanz N. Fernandez-Carvajal A. Morenilla-Palao C. Planells-Cases R. Fajardo-Sanchez E. Fernandez-Ballester G. Ferrer-Montiel A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5307-5313Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We introduced deletion of the coiled-coil domain into the [C996S] mutant and co-expressed the [C996S] or [C996S/ΔC] mutant subunit with the wild type subunit. We examined the assembly of functional channels by recording ADPR-evoked currents and the subunit interaction by co-immunoprecipitation. Fig. 6 shows the results. In striking contrast with the [C996S] mutant subunit, the [C996S/ΔC] mutant subunit almost entirely"
https://openalex.org/W2030975218,"Activation of death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) occurs via dephosphorylation of Ser-308 and subsequent association of calcium/calmodulin. In this study, we confirmed the existence of the alternatively spliced human DAPK-β, and we examined the levels of DAPK autophosphorylation and DAPK catalytic activity in response to tumor necrosis factor or ceramide. It was found that DAPK is rapidly dephosphorylated in response to tumor necrosis factor or ceramide and then subsequently degraded via proteasome activity. Dephosphorylation and activation of DAPK are shown to temporally precede its subsequent degradation. This results in an initial increase in kinase activity followed by a decrease in DAPK expression and activity. The decline in DAPK expression is paralleled with increased caspase activity and cell apoptosis. These results suggest that the apoptosis regulatory activities mediated by DAPK are controlled both by phosphorylation status and protein stability.

The kinase domain of DAPK has a high homology to the kinase domain of smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase and as expected can also phosphorylate the regulatory light chain (RLC) of myosin II. Studies have confirmed that a conserved lysine residue within the catalytic site is important for ATP binding, and mutation of this lysine (K42W or K42A) abolishes the effect of DAPK on apoptosis (2Jin Y.

The catalytic activity of DAPK is regulated by Ca2+/CaM and by autophosphorylation of Ser-308 within the Ca2+/CaM binding domain. Similar to myosin light chain kinase, phosphorylation of this site inhibits Ca2+/CaM binding and provides a mechanism that negatively regulates DAPK activity (14Shohat G. Spivak-Kroizman T. Cohen O.

DAPK has been shown to interact with DIP1/MIB1 (DAPK-interacting protein-1/mind-bomb) primarily through the ankyrin repeats domain of DAPK (17Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Shao Z. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol.

DIP1/MIB1 is an E3 ligase, and among its multiple functions, it mediates the poly-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of DAPK (17Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Shao Z. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol.

This finding raises the possibility that controlling DAPK stability may be a mechanism to regulate the protein levels of DAPK and hence its overall activity. Consistent with this proposal is a recent study demonstrating that HSP90 binds to and stabilizes DAPK, providing another pathway to regulate the activities of this complex kinase (19Citri A. Harari D. Shohat G. Ramakrishnan P. Gan J. Lavi S. Eisenstein M. Kimchi A. Wallach D. Pietrokovski S. Yarden Y. J. Biol.

Ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation are common mechanisms for controlling the level of proteins involved in regulating apoptosis, such as caspases and inhibitors of caspases. It has been reported that the expression of DAPK is lost in some types of cancer by promoter hypermethylation, although the significance of down-regulating DAPK expression in the transition of these normal cells to transformed cells is uncertain when the dual pro- and anti-apoptotic functions of this kinase are considered (20Bai T.

In this study, we determined whether the expression level of DAPK is acutely altered during TNF- or ceramide-induced apoptosis and whether ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation are responsible for the change in DAPK protein levels. One important aspect of DAPK functionality that has not been extensively pursued is the relationship between activation of DAPK and the stability of the protein in response to apoptotic stimuli (17Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Shao Z. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46980-46986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the kinase activity of DAPK during TNF- or ceramide-induced apoptosis, and its relationship to DAPK Ser-308 phosphorylation and total DAPK protein levels. We found that DAPK activities, which are critical in determining the progression of TNF- or ceramide-induced apoptosis (3Cohen O. Inbal B. Kissil J.L. Raveh T. Berissi H. Spivak-Kroizaman T.

These studies reveal that alterations in DAPK stability in addition to changes in its kinase activity occur in response to these stimuli. These alterations occur in a temporally distinct pattern during the progression of apoptosis, and it is likely that the balance of these activities ultimately determines the pro- or anti-apoptotic outcome. Thus, when phosphorylation of Ser-308 is low, survival predominates, and when proteasomal degradation is increased to deplete cellular levels of DAPK, apoptosis ensues. Cells, Antibodies, and Reagents—HeLa cells are from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). HeLa cells expressing tetracycline-inducible mouse DAPK-α or DAPK-β were created and maintained in this laboratory as described previously (2Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Hou L. Wysolmerski R.B. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39667-39678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Antibodies to DAPK (clone DAPK-55) and DAPK phosphorylated on Ser-308 (clone DKPS308) were purchased from Sigma. Antibodies to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Human tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) and cycloheximide (CHX) were purchased from Calbiochem. The proteasome inhibitor, MG-132, and N-hexanoyl-d-sphingosine (C6-ceramide) were from Sigma. RT-PCR Detection of Human DAPK-β—First Choice RACE-ready cDNA from human brain was purchased from Ambion. Total RNA from human coronary artery smooth muscle primary cells (Cell Applications, Inc.) was prepared using Trizol according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen), and cDNA synthesis was performed in a mixture containing 400 ng of total RNA, random primers, and reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). For RT-PCR detection of DAPK-α and DAPK-β isoform mRNAs, a combination of a sense primer (SP) 5′-TTGCTGAAGGCATCCTCTGTG-3′ (SP1), 5′-TCAGACCTGAACCTCCTCACTCG-3′ (SP2), and an antisense primer (ASP) of 5′-ACAGAGAGGTAGCGTTTCCTTG-3′ (ASP1) was used to generate fragments. The amplification was carried out in a 50-μl mixture containing 1 μl of cDNA, 1 mm each of the sense and antisense primers, 1 unit of Platinum Taq High Fidelity, 1× High Fidelity PCR Buffer, and 0.2 mm dNTPs (Invitrogen). The reaction conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min and 35–45 cycles of amplification (94 °C for 0.5 min, 55 °C for 0.5 min, and 68 °C for 0.75 min), followed by a final extension step of 10 min at 68 °C. The products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis for size estimation, subcloned into pCR4-TOPO using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen), and were sequenced to verify the insert. The nucleotide sequence for the PCR fragment confirming the alternatively spliced human DAPK-β has been deposited in the GenBank™ under accession number EF090258. Immunoprecipitation and in Vitro Kinase Assay—Endogenous human DAPK or overexpressed mouse mutant (S308A or S308D) DAPK was immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells and subjected to an in vitro kinase assay as described previously (2Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Hou L. Wysolmerski R.B. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39667-39678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The amount of phosphorylated RLC was quantified from Western blotting of phospho-RLC using an antibody specific for RLC phosphorylated on Ser-19, purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Alkaline Phosphatase Treatment and Calmodulin Overlay Assay—Immunoprecipitated DAPK was washed and incubated with 50 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (AP, New England Biolabs) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl for 30 min at room temperature. For calmodulin overlay assay, immunoprecipitated DAPK was Western-blotted and incubated with biotinylated calmodulin (CaM, Sigma) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Ca2+ and 5% nonfat dry milk. Calmodulin was detected with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (The Jackson Laboratory). Caspase Activity Assay—Caspase assays utilize specific caspase substrates Ac-IETD-pNA (caspase-8), Ac-DEVD-pNA (caspase-3), or Ac-LEHD-pNA (caspase-9) (7Jin Y. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51587-51593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For measurement of caspase activity in vivo, both adherent and floating cells were collected and lysed with CHAPS lysis buffer (0.1% CHAPS, 100 mm NaCl, 100 μm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). For every cell sample, nonspecific background was determined by adding the caspase inhibitors, acetyl-IETD-aldehyde (Ac-IETD-CHO; caspase-8), acetyl-DEVD-aldehyde (Ac-DEVD-CHO; caspase-3), or acetyl-LEHD-aldehyde (Ac-LEHD-CHO; caspase-9) as negative control. Cell Death Assay—Quantification of apoptotic cell death was performed as described previously (2Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Hou L. Wysolmerski R.B. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39667-39678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, after 4 h of treatment with TNF (10 ng/ml) and CHX (10 μg/ml), cells were fixed and stained for LacZ expression. Apoptotic cells with membrane blebbing were identified morphologically and counted. The extent of apoptosis is defined as follows: (the number of blue apoptotic cells)/(the total number of blue cells). Data Analysis—All experiments were independently performed at least three times. All statistic analysis and graphs were created using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego). Phospho-DAPK level is normalized to the level of total DAPK in Fig. 2C. Western blotting data were quantified by densitometry and are representative of at least three repeated experiments. Dephosphorylation of Ser-308 in DAPK Enhances Kinase Activity—DAPK is phosphorylated on several residues, including an autophosphorylation site at Ser-308 (14Shohat G. Spivak-Kroizman T. Cohen O. Bialik S. Shani G. Berrisi H. Eisenstein M. Kimchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47460-47467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Mutation of Ser-308 to alanine increases the Ca2+/CaM-dependent kinase activity of DAPK (14Shohat G. Spivak-Kroizman T. Cohen O. Bialik S. Shani G. Berrisi H. Eisenstein M. Kimchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47460-47467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated whether dephosphorylation of Ser-308 of the endogenous DAPK was capable of increasing DAPK activity. Initially, the basal level of human DAPK autophosphorylated at Ser-308 (phospho-DAPK) in HeLa cells was determined by immunoprecipitation utilizing an antibody specific for DAPK phosphorylated at Ser-308. The relative levels of phospho-DAPK and nonphosphorylated DAPK were detected and quantified following Western blotting of the immunoprecipitate and the immunoprecipitation supernatant (Fig. 1A). This analysis showed that the relative levels of immunoprecipitated phospho-DAPK and nonphosphorylated DAPK remaining in the post-immunoprecipitation supernatant are approximately equal, suggesting that about 50% of human DAPK is autophosphorylated on Ser-308 under basal conditions. In vitro treatment of immunoprecipitated total human DAPK with alkaline phosphatase (AP) significantly reduced the level of phospho-DAPK (Fig. 1B). The AP-treated, dephosphorylated DAPK bound Ca2+/CaM with higher affinity (Fig. 1B). The kinase activities of both the AP-treated and untreated DAPK were measured using purified myosin II RLC as a substrate in an in vitro kinase assay as described previously (2Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Hou L. Wysolmerski R.B. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39667-39678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). After the reaction was stopped, the phosphorylated RLC was analyzed by Western blotting using an antibody specific for RLC phosphorylated on Ser-19 and quantified by densitometry. Because DAPK is only partially activated by Ca2+/CaM binding, the kinase assays were performed both in the presence or absence of Ca2+/CaM. These results show that the Ca2+/CaM-independent kinase activity of AP-treated human DAPK is 5-fold higher than untreated DAPK (Fig. 1C). This is consistent with the previous report that ablation of Ser-308 autophosphorylation increases Ca2+/CaM-independent kinase activity (14Shohat G. Spivak-Kroizman T. Cohen O. Bialik S. Shani G. Berrisi H. Eisenstein M. Kimchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47460-47467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). AP-treated DAPK also has 2-fold higher Ca2+/CaM-dependent kinase activity than untreated DAPK (Fig. 1C). DAPK Expression and Activity Decrease following Dephosphorylation during TNF- and Ceramide-induced Apoptosis—DAPK has an important kinase-dependent role in regulating TNF- or ceramide-induced apoptosis (3Cohen O. Inbal B. Kissil J.L. Raveh T. Berissi H. Spivak-Kroizaman T. Feinstein E. Kimchi A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 5Pelled D. Raveh T. Riebeling C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 47460-47467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We thus examined levels of the endogenous human DAPK activity in HeLa cells treated with TNF (10 ng/ml) and CHX (10 μg/ml) or CHX alone (data not shown) for up to 6 h, or with C6-ceramide (50 μm) for up to 32 h. Endogenous DAPK was immunoprecipitated, and its kinase activity was determined by an in vitro kinase assay with myosin II RLC as substrate. Phospho-RLC was detected with a specific antibody that detects phosphorylation of Ser-19 and quantified by densitometric scanning (Fig. 2A). Although the kinase assays were performed both in the presence or absence of Ca2+/CaM, only results from assays conducted in the presence of Ca2+/CaM are shown as both Ca2+/CaM-dependent and -independent kinase activities of DAPK had similar changes in the magnitude of the response to TNF. These results demonstrate that DAPK kinase activity increases between 15 and 30 min in response to TNF treatment, reaching 3-fold higher than the initial level by 60 min. After 60 min, DAPK activity drops dramatically, dipping below the initial level of kinase activity at 120 min and having only 50% of the initial kinase activity left after 6 h of TNF/CHX treatment. DAPK activities in HeLa cells treated with C6-ceramide for up to 32 h have similar biphasic profiles, in which DAPK kinase activity gradually increases to greater than 2-fold of the basal level by 8 h and thereafter declines to basal level. To determine the relationship between DAPK activity and DAPK autophosphorylation, protein levels of phospho-DAPK as well as total DAPK were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 2, B and C). Expression of phospho-DAPK begins to decline beginning between 15 and 30 min of TNF/CHX treatment or following 2 h of ceramide treatment. Total levels of DAPK also decrease, although this is not detectable until after 2 h of TNF/CHX treatment or after of 16 h of ceramide. Normalization of phospho-DAPK level to the total DAPK level revealed that TNF treatment induces a rapid and sustained dephosphorylation of DAPK at Ser-308. After 60 min of TNF/CHX treatment (Fig. 2, B and C), the level of phosphorylation is only 20% that of nontreated cells. Because it was determined that 50% of the total DAPK in nontreated cells is autophosphorylated (Fig. 1A), then by extrapolation, in the TNF/CHX cells only 10% of total DAPK will be autophosphorylated after 60 min. A similar decrease in phosphorylation of DAPK at Ser-308 is also detected after 8 h of C6-ceramide treatment (Fig. 2, B and C). Together these data define the temporal succession of events that begin with dephosphorylation of Ser-308 to result in increased catalytic activity and the subsequent decline in activity, which results from the decrease in DAPK expression. In parallel experiments, caspase-9 activity in HeLa cells treated with TNF/CHX or ceramide was determined by a colorimetric assay using a caspase-9-specific substrate. The temporal increase in caspase-9 activity is delayed, and an increase over the basal levels is not detectable until after 60 min of TNF/CHX treatment or 8 h of ceramide treatment. (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the increase in caspase-9 activity is delayed until after a significant decline in DAPK kinase activity occurs raising the possibility that there is an inverse relationship between these activities. A Mutant, Unphosphorylatable DAPK (DAPK-S308A), Protects Cells from TNF- or Ceramide-induced Apoptosis—The above results suggest that in response to TNF or ceramide, DAPK is initially dephosphorylated and activated, perhaps to antagonize and attenuate the apoptotic signaling of TNF or ceramide. If this is true, then overexpression of a mutant DAPK lacking the auto-phosphorylation site (DAPK-S308A) should protect cells from TNF- or ceramide-induced apoptosis. To test this, we expressed mutant unphosphorylatable mouse DAPK-S308A and DAPK-S308D, a phosphomimetic mutant with a serine to aspartic acid substitution of either DAPK-α or DAPK-β in HeLa cells. As the results of kinase assays from both DAPK-α and DAPK-β mutants are indistinguishable, only the results for mouse DAPK-α are shown in Fig. 3, A and B. As expected, both mutant forms of DAPK are not phosphorylated on Ser-308, as confirmed by the absence of signal using the phospho-Ser-308-DAPK-specific antibody (Fig. 3A). DAPK-S308D also has a lower affinity for Ca2+/CaM as evidenced by its inability to bind CaM in the presence of Ca2+ using a ligand-blotting assay (Fig. 3A). This result suggests that mutation of Ser-308 to aspartic acid (S308D) results in a kinase that resembles the Ser-308 autophosphorylated DAPK (Fig. 1B). The kinase activities of these mutant mouse DAPKs were evaluated using an in vitro kinase assay with myosin II RLC as substrate (Fig. 3B). These assays showed that DAPK-S308A is twice as active as wild type DAPK (DAPK-WT), in the presence or absence of Ca2+/CaM, whereas DAPK-S308D retains less than 20% of the kinase activity of DAPK-WT. These data suggest that when expressed in cells, DAPK-S308D will act as a dominant negative by competing with endogenous DAPK. Although mouse DAPK-α and DAPK-β have indistinguishable kinase activities, DAPK-β is more potent than DAPK-α in protecting HeLa cells from TNF-induced apoptosis (2Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Hou L. Wysolmerski R.B. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39667-39678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To test the effect of DAPK-Ser-308 mutants on TNF-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells, plasmids encoding either wild type or mutant DAPK-α or DAPK-β S308A or S308D were cotransfected with LacZ into HeLa cells. The transfection efficiency was similar for all the plasmids, as shown by Western blotting of recombinant DAPKs (Fig. 3C). After treatment with TNF/CHX for 4 h, cells were fixed and stained for LacZ expression. The percentage of LacZ-positive cells that had obvious apoptotic morphology (blebbing and condensed cytoplasm) was determined to monitor apoptosis (Fig. 3C). After 4 h of TNF treatment, 75% of control cells that were transfected with LacZ alone had apoptotic morphology. Cells that were transfected with mouse DAPK had a lower percentage of apoptotic cells, although statistical significance was achieved only for cells expressing DAPK-β. Similarly, overexpression of DAPK-β-S308A, a mutant mouse DAPK-β that has higher kinase activity than wild type DAPK-β because of loss of the inactivating autophosphorylation site (Fig. 3B), further decreased the level of apoptotic cells to 30%. In contrast, overexpression of an autophosphorylation site mimetic, DAPK-β-S308D, a mutant DAPK-β that has lower kinase activity than wild type DAPK-β (Fig. 3B), increased the percentage of apoptotic cells to 90%, suggesting DAPK-β-S308D acts as a dominant negative to promote apoptosis. Consistent with our previous studies suggesting that overexpression of DAPK-α does not overtly promote apoptosis, but rather acts as a weak survival factor (2Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Hou L. Wysolmerski R.B. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39667-39678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), expression of either wild type, S308A, or S308D DAPK-α form did not significantly increase or decrease the apoptotic levels of TNF-treated HeLa cells. Plasmids encoding either wild type or mutant mouse DAPK-α or DAPK-β S308A or S308D were also cotransfected with GFP into HeLa cells. The GFP-positive cells were enriched by fluorescence-activated cell sorter and were positive for the recombinant DAPKs (Fig. 3D). After treatment with C6-ceramide for 24 h, both the floating and adherent cells were collected and assayed for cellular activities of caspase-3, caspase-8, and ca"

A fraction of Cdk5 and p35 localizes in the nucleus where Cdk5-p35 exerts its functions via protein phosphorylation, and p35 displays a dynamic localization between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Here, we examined the nuclear import properties of p35. In nuclear import assays, p35 was actively transported into the nuclei of digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells and cortical neurons by cytoplasmic carrier-mediated mechanisms. Importin-β, importin-5, and importin-7 were identified to import p35 into the nuclei via a direct interaction with it. An N-terminal region of p35 was defined to interact with the above importins, serving as a nuclear localization signal. Finally, we show that the nuclear localization of p35 does not require the association of Cdk5. Furthermore, Cdk5 and importin-β/5/7 are mutually exclusive in binding to p35.

Instead, p35 is found as a specific activator of Cdk5 in nervous system neurons, and just recently, p35 has also been detected in muscle cells (3Fu A.K. Fu W.Y. Cheung J. Tsim K.W. Ip F.C. Wang J.H. Ip N.Y. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 4Lew J. Huang Q.Q. Qi Z. Winkfein R.J. Aebersold R. Hunt T. Wang J.H.

Nature. 1994; 371: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Despite little apparent sequence homology between p35 and cyclins, p35 assembles into a cyclin A-like structure with distinct features to specifically bind and activate Cdk5 (6Tarricone C. Dhavan R. Peng J. Areces L.B. Tsai L.H. Musacchio A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 657-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). A body of evidence has accumulated to indicate the vital role of Cdk5-p35 in a multitude of neural functions, including cytoskeletal dynamics, cell adhesion, axonal guidance, cell signaling, and synaptic plasticity (1Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 2Lim A.C. Qu D. Qi R.Z. Neurosignals. 2003; 12: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Neurotoxins induce the proteolytic transformation of p35 to an N-terminally truncated form, p25; the resulting complex Cdk5-p25 becomes neurotoxic (7Lee M.S. Kwon Y.T. Li M. Peng J. Friedlander R.M. Tsai L.H. Nature. 2000; 405: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar, 8Patrick G.N. Zukerberg L. Nikolic M. de la Monte S. Dikkes P. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the aberrant Cdk5 regulation by p25 is implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease (1Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 2Lim A.C. Qu D. Qi R.Z. Neurosignals. 2003; 12: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In cultured neurons, both Cdk5 and p35 are detected throughout the cell soma and neurites (9Nikolic M. Dudek H. Kwon Y.T. Ramos Y.F. Tsai L.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 10Qu D. Li Q. Lim H.Y. Cheung N.S. Li R. Wang J.H. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7324-7332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, a number of studies have shown the presence of Cdk5 and p35 in the nucleus (9Nikolic M. Dudek H. Kwon Y.T. Ramos Y.F. Tsai L.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 10Qu D. Li Q. Lim H.Y. Cheung N.S. Li R. Wang J.H. Qi R.Z. J. Biol.

Also, some of Cdk5-p35 associating proteins and substrates display nuclear localization and functions (2Lim A.C. Qu D. Qi R.Z. Neurosignals. 2003; 12: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For instance, Cdk5 and p35/p25 colocalize with the transcription factor MEF2 in the nucleus (11Gong X. Tang X. Wiedmann M. Wang X. Peng J. Zheng D. Blair L.A. Marshall J. Mao Z. Neuron. 2003; 38: 33-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Moreover, Cdk5-p35/p25 catalyzes the site-specific phosphorylation of MEF2, inhibiting MEF2 transcriptional activity (11Gong X. Tang X. Wiedmann M. Wang X. Peng J. Zheng D. Blair L.A. Marshall J. Mao Z. Neuron. 2003; 38: 33-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Another nuclear protein, SET, has been found to interact with Cdk5-p35, up-regulating its kinase activity (10Qu D. Li Q. Lim H.Y. Cheung N.S. Li R. Wang J.H. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7324-7332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These observations suggest the nuclear functions of Cdk5-p35, which are linked to the phosphorylation of its substrates. Recently, it has been observed that neuregulin induces the elevation of p35 levels but not those of Cdk5 in the nuclei of myotubes, implicating a signal-mediated dynamic nucleocytoplasmic transport of p35 (13Fu A.K. Fu W.Y. Ng A.K. Chien W.W. Ng Y.P. Wang J.H. Ip N.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6728-6733Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The p35 uptake may regulate Cdk5 functions in the nucleus. Protein transport between the cytoplasm and the nucleus occurs through the nuclear pore complex (NPC), 2The abbreviations used are: NPC, nuclear pore complex; aa, amino acid(s); Imp, importin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione-S-transferase; NLS, nuclear localization sequence. which allows the entry of small molecules by diffusion and the selective entry of large molecules via active transport. Importins are an expanding family of proteins that mediate active nuclear import through association with protein cargos (14Fried H. Kutay U. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1659-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 15Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). Importin-cargo association is regulated by small GTPase Ran, which shifts between the GTP- and GDP-bound states (16Gorlich D. Pante N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm where Ran is primarily GDP-bound, importins are loaded with cargos and the complexes transit to the nucleus where Ran-GTP is accumulated. The binding of Ran-GTP to the importins triggers cargo release in the nucleus. Both importins and Ran recycle for efficient nuclear transport. In the classical import mechanism, importin-α (Impα) binds to the nuclear localization signal (NLS) within the import cargos. Such binding couples the cargos to the transport carrier importin-β (Impβ), which moves the Impα-cargo complexes into the nucleus (14Fried H. Kutay U. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1659-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 15Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). In addition, a number of proteins interact directly with Impβ or other carrier importins, such as importin-5 (Imp5) and importin-7 (Imp7), for Impα-independent transport (14Fried H. Kutay U. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1659-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 15Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). Interestingly, various import properties have been observed for different cyclin family members. For example, cyclin E employs the Impα/Impβ heterodimer pathway, while cyclin B is imported by Impβ without the involvement of Impα (17Moore J.D. Yang J. Truant R. Kornbluth S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 18Takizawa C.G. Weis K. Morgan D.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7938-7943Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The different import pathways imply separate control mechanisms for each CDK/cyclin at the nucleocytoplasmic transport level. In the present report, we investigated the nuclear import mechanisms of p35. In nuclear import assays using digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells and cortical neurons, we found that p35 import requires soluble import factors and is in an energy-dependent and Ran-GTP/GDP-mediated manner. Subsequently, Impβ, Imp5, and Imp7 were isolated from rat brain to interact with p35. We show that the above importins can transport p35 into the nucleus via direct association with a basic region at the N terminus of p35. We also probed the role of Cdk5 in p35 nuclear import and show that p35 does not depend on the Cdk5 association for nuclear localization. In addition, Cdk5 does not form a ternary complex with p35 and Impβ, Imp5, or Imp7. Therefore, p35 and Cdk5 may undertake separate pathways for nuclear import. Plasmid Construction—Mutants and fragments of p35 were generated from a bovine p35 cDNA using PCR-based methods and were then cloned into pCI-neo, pEGFP-N3, pFlag-CMV2, and pGEX4T-1. We modified pCI-neo to express cloned genes with a double myc-tag at the C terminus. The p35 fragment aa 31–98 and its K61–63A mutant were also double tagged with GFP and GST by ligating a GST sequence amplified from pGEX in-frame to the C terminus of the p35 sequence in pEGFP-C3. Ran-GAP1 and Ran-BP1 were cloned by PCR from the cDNA preparations of a human cell line and were inserted into the vector pET14. Impβ/pET30a (obtained from Dr. Stephen A. Adam, Northwestern University Medical School) (19Chi N.C. Adam E.J. Visser G.D. Adam S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) was used to construct Impβ/pFlag-CMV2. We generated Impβ-(1–281) and Impβ-(1–483) by subcloning Impβ restriction fragments into pET30Xa/LIC. Imp5 was cloned from Imp5/pGEX4T (obtained from Dr. Günter Blobel, The Rockefeller University) (20Yaseen N.R. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4451-4456Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) into pET30. Human CRM1 was subcloned from CRM1/pcDNA3.1 (obtained from Dr. Edward Seto, University of South Florida) (21Yang W.M. Tsai S.C. Wen Y.D. Fejer G. Seto E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9447-9454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) into pET14b. Recombinant Protein Preparation—Protein expression was induced in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) with 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 18 °C for 16 h. Recombinant proteins were purified using GSH-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for GST fusion proteins and Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen) for His6-tagged (His6) proteins (22Lim A.C. Hou Z. Goh C.P. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46668-46673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). After purification, proteins were dialyzed in a buffer solution of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 110 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm benzamidine. Imp7 and NTF2 were prepared from Xenopus Imp7/pQE9 (obtained from Dr. Dirk Görlich, Zentrum für Molekulare Biologie der Universität Heidelberg, Germany) and NTF2/pET23b (obtained from Dr. Larry Gerace, The Scripps Research Institute), respectively, following published protocols (23Gorlich D.

Isolation of p35-binding Proteins and Protein Binding Assays—Proteins interacting with p35 were isolated from rat brain using GST-p35 fragments as reported previously (10Qu D. Li Q. Lim H.Y. Cheung N.S. Li R. Wang J.H. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7324-7332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 22Lim A.C. Hou Z. Goh C.P. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46668-46673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The binding of p35 to importins was tested by incubating GST-p35 proteins with His6-tagged importins at 4 °C for 1 h in 0.5 ml of the binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2% Triton X-100) plus 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. After the GST pull down, the bound proteins were analyzed on immunoblots. The antibodies used were anti-Impβ (mAb3E9, Affinity BioReagents), anti-Imp5 (obtained from Dr. Günter Blobel), anti-Imp7 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-His6 (H-15, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Nuclear Import Assays—HeLa cells were grown on cover-slips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cultures of primary cortical neurons were prepared from cortices of mouse embryos as detailed in a previous report (10Qu D. Li Q. Lim H.Y. Cheung N.S. Li R. Wang J.H. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7324-7332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Nuclear import assays were performed as described (24Jakel S. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4491-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 26Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were permeabilized with 60 μg/ml of digitonin (Sigma) in the import buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 250 mm sucrose, and 0.5 mm EGTA). Import assays were conducted at 30 °C for 30 min in the import buffer containing import substrates (3 μm), an energy-regenerating system (1 mm ATP, 0.5 mm GTP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, and 50 μg/ml creatine kinase), and 30% rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega). Alternatively, a mixture of 3 μm Ran-GDP, 0.3 μm Ran-GAP1, 0.3 μm Ran-BP1, 0.3 μm NTF2, and 2 μm of Impβ, Imp5, or Imp7 was used instead of rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Where indicated, nuclear import was also tested under the following conditions: 50 units/ml apyrase (Sigma) was applied instead of the energy-regenerating system, the nuclei were preincubated with 0.1 mg/ml wheat germ agglutinin (Sigma) in the import buffer for 15 min at room temperature, and 3 μm Ran-Q69L-GTP or Ran-GDP was present in the reactions. Following the reactions, the cells were washed with the cold import buffer and were fixed for immunofluorescence staining. The anti-GST antibody was from Sigma. Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 488- or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat antibodies (Invitrogen). Nuclear DNA was labeled by 1 μm Hoechst 33258 (Sigma). Images were acquired on an epifluorescence microscope (Nikon model TE2000). Transfection and Immunoprecipitation—Transient transfection of COS-7 and HEK293T was carried out using Lipofectamine Plus Reagent (Invitrogen). Cell lysates were prepared in 50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, and the protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma). The immunoprecipitates were analyzed on immunoblots with antibodies where indicated. The antibodies recognizing GFP, Cdk5 (anti-Cdk5 DC17), and p35 (anti-p35 C-19) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—The nucleocytoplasmic localization of GFP in fusion with p35 or p35 mutants was examined under a confocal microscope (Olympus Fluoview BX61). To determine the ratio of nuclear/cytoplasmic p35 fluorescence (Fn/c), the quantification of fluorescence intensity in the nucleus (Fn), the cytoplasm (Fc), and un-transfected background areas (Fb) was performed using the MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging). In each cell, at least three different fields in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm excluding areas of protein aggregates were measured to obtain average nuclear and cytoplasmic pixel intensities, respectively. Fn/c was derived from the formula Fn/c = (Fn – Fb)/(Fc – Fb) (27Lam M.H. Briggs L.J. Hu W. Martin T.J. Gillespie M.T. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7391-7398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test (unpaired, two-tailed). p35 Is Actively Imported into the Nucleus—We examined p35 nuclear import properties in nuclear import assays. When the assays were conducted at 30 °C on digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells with rabbit reticulocyte lysate and an energy regenerating system, GST-p35 was avidly transported into the nuclei (Fig. 1A). Moreover, the p35 import failed to occur under the following conditions (Fig. 1A). First, rabbit reticulocyte lysate, which was the source of cytosolic import factors, was omitted in the assay. Second, the assay was conducted at 4 °C, which inhibits active protein import but not passive diffusion. Third, apyrase was used instead of the energy system. Fourth, wheat germ agglutinin was used to block the NPC (28Finlay D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Price T.M. Forbes D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that p35 is actively imported into the nucleus by cytosolic factors via the NPC. The same import results were obtained using the protein p35-His6 (data not shown), indicating that the tag moiety of the recombinant proteins did not affect p35 import behavior. As p35 is a neuronal protein, we also conducted the import assays on digitonin-permeabilized cortical neurons. The results were in complete agreement with those of HeLa cells (supplemental Fig. S1), suggesting that both cell types are suitable for p35 nuclear import assays. Ran-GTP mediates nuclear import by dissociating cargos from carrier importins (14Fried H. Kutay U. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1659-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 15Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). The Ran-GTP effect on p35 import was probed by using the GTPase-deficient mutant Ran-Q69L. p35 import assays were performed with rabbit reticulocyte lysate as the source of all import protein factors. In contrast to the nuclear uptake of p35 in the assay with Ran-GDP, p35 import was inhibited in the presence of Ran-Q69L-GTP (Fig. 1B), revealing that p35 nuclear import is mediated by the Ran-GTP/GDP system. Therefore, we conclude that p35 is imported into the nucleus by import factors in a Ran-mediated manner. p35 Binds to Impβ, Imp5, and Imp7—To seek for nuclear import receptors of p35, we carried out a biochemical isolation of p35-interacting proteins from rat brain. As described previously, two recombinant proteins, GST-p16 comprising aa 1–149 and GST-p25 comprising aa 99–307 of p35, were used in the isolation (10Qu D. Li Q. Lim H.Y. Cheung N.S. Li R. Wang J.H. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7324-7332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 22Lim A.C. Hou Z. Goh C.P. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46668-46673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Tandem mass spectrometric data revealed the specific pull down of Impβ, Imp5, and Imp7 by GST-p16 (data not shown). To confirm the isolation results, we probed the pull downs on immunoblots. As seen in Fig. 2A, Impβ, Imp5, and Imp7 coprecipitated with GST-p16 but not with GST or GST-p25, indicating the specific association of the above importins with the N-terminal fragment of p35. Next, we conducted biochemical binding assays using purified recombinant proteins. As detected on the immunoblots, Impβ, Imp5, and Imp7 were pulled down by GST-p35 but not by GST (Fig. 2B), showing direct interaction between p35 and the importins. We also examined the effect of the Ran-GTPase on p35 interaction with Impβ/5/7. Impβ, Imp5, and Imp7 failed to coprecipitate with p35 in the presence of GTP-loaded Ran-Q69L, in contrast to the coprecipitation of the importins with p35 when Ran-GDP was used (Fig. 2C). Therefore, GTP-bound Ran abrogates p35 association with Impβ/5/7. In a previous report, Impβ and Imp7 have been found to cooperate in binding to histone H1 for histone H1 import (29Jakel S. Albig W. Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Schwamborn K. Doenecke D. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In our assays, we did not observe any cooperative effect between Impβ and either Imp7 or Imp5 in the p35 association (data not shown). Impβ contains a protein cargo binding site at the N-terminal half (aa 1–462) (17Moore J.D. Yang J. Truant R. Kornbluth S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 24Jakel S. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4491-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). We tested p35 binding to two N-terminal fragments of Impβ, aa 1–281 and aa 1–483. The binding assays were performed with the p35 fragment p10, which contains the Impβ-binding domain (see Fig. 7A). Like the full-length Impβ, Impβ-(1–483) exhibited a strong p10 binding activity (Fig. 3). In contrast, Impβ-(1–281) did not bind to p10 in the assay (Fig. 3). These results show that like other cargo proteins such as cyclin B1 and rpL23a, p35 binds to an N-terminal region of Impβ, which overlaps with the Ran-GTP-binding region (17Moore J.D. Yang J. Truant R. Kornbluth S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 24Jakel S. Gorlich D.

GST pull downs were performed using 5 μg of GST-p10 and 10 μg of His6-Impβ or the Impβ fragments. The bound fractions and the input Impβ proteins (10%) were analyzed on anti-His6 immunoblots. GST-p10 retrieved by the beads was visualized by staining the membrane with Ponseau S.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Impβ/5/7 Can Import p35 into the Nucleus in Vitro—The import activities of Impβ/5/7 toward p35 were tested on HeLa nuclei with import factors supplied from purified recombinant proteins. When the assay was performed with Impβ, strong and exclusive nuclear staining of p35 was observed, whereas the p35 import completely failed in the absence of any importin (Fig. 4). The nuclear uptake of p35 was also detected in the assays of Imp5 or Imp7 (Fig. 4). Likewise, when the Impβ-triggered import was tested on digitonin-permeabilized cortical neurons, p35 was readily imported into the nuclei (supplemental Fig. S2). Therefore, each of Impβ, Imp5, and Imp7 can stimulate the nuclear import of p35. p35 and Cdk5 Are Imported by Separate Pathways—Given that p35 is a primary regulator of Cdk5, we explored the potential effects of Cdk5 on p35 association with Impβ, Imp5, and Imp7. In a binding test, Cdk5 did not exhibit any significant binding activity to Impβ/5/7 (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, after preincubation of GST-p35 with excess Cdk5, GST-p35 failed to pull down Impβ/5/7 (Fig. 5A), revealing that Cdk5 blocked p35 binding to the importins. In this and the experiments below, the amount of the GST proteins retrieved by GSH beads remained unchanged under various conditions (data not shown). To assess the effect of Impβ/5/7 on the interaction between p35 and Cdk5, p35 was incubated with an increasing amount of Impβ, Imp5, or Imp7 and was then subjected to a Cdk5 binding test. As shown in Fig. 5B, the binding of p35 with Cdk5 was inhibited by the importins in a dose-dependent manner. Collectively, these results indicate that Cdk5 and Impβ/5/7 are mutually exclusive in binding to p35. To determine whether Cdk5 association is required for p35 nuclear localization, we generated two p35 mutants, p35(L151,152N) and p35(D288A,L289A), which are devoid of the Cdk5 binding activity (31Tang D. Chun A.C. Zhang M. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12318-12327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Indeed, these p35 mutants were not able to coimmunoprecipitate Cdk5 from the transfected cells in contrast to the wild type (Fig. 6A). To examine the subcellular localization, p35 and the non-Cdk5-binding mutants were ectopically expressed with GFP. The expression of GFP in fusion with the p35 proteins was verified on an immunoblot of the cell lysates (Fig. 6B). GFP fluorescence showed that these mutations did not alter the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of p35 (Fig. 6B). Thus, p35 does not require Cdk5 association for its nuclear localization. An N-terminal Region of p35 Can Serve as an NLS—As shown above, Impβ, Imp5, and Imp7 were isolated from the brain extract with aa 1–149 of p35 but not with p25. We further mapped the Impβ/5/7-binding site at the N terminus of p35. In binding assays, Impβ, Imp5, and Imp7 bound to aa 1–99 and aa 31–98 but not to the further truncated fragments aa 1–52 and aa 31–90 (Fig. 7A). Thus, aa 31–98 is responsible for the binding of the above importins. In addition, we found that p10 did not bind to the nuclear export receptor CRM1 in a binding assay (Fig. 7B). As a control, CRM1 was readily detected in the pull down of cyclin D1 (Fig. 7B), a known cargo protein of CRM1 (32Alt J.R. Cleveland J.L. Hannink M. Diehl J.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3102-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). This result provides additional support to the specificity of the interaction between the N terminus of p35 and the importins. The sequence of aa 31–98 is rich in basic amino acids, reminiscent of the BIB domain (β-like import receptor binding domain) of the ribosomal protein rpL23a (24Jakel S. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4491-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Particularly, five Lys residues were found in a short stretch, aa 61–67 (Fig. 7C). To determine whether these Lys residues are required for the importin associations, we substituted Ala for the three consecutive lysines 61KKK63, generating the K61–63A mutant of p35. This mutation did not affect p35 association with Cdk5 (Fig. 7D). However, it abrogated the Impβ binding activity (Fig. 7E), demonstrating the requirement of these basic residues in the Impβ association. In addition, the K61–63A mutation reduced the Imp5 binding activity but did not significantly affect the Imp7 binding activity of p35 (data not shown). We went on to assess the import activity of the K61–63A mutant in nuclear import assays. When the assays were performed with rabbit reticulocyte lysate, the mutant was detected at only minimal levels in the nuclei compared with the avid nuclear uptake of parent p35 (Fig. 7F). Moreover, in the assay using recombinant Impβ the mutant failed to be imported into the nuclei (supplemental Fig. S3). Thus, the mutation interferes with the import activity of p35. To demonstrate the NLS function of aa 31–98, we transiently expressed this fragment or its K61–63A mutant in fusion with both GFP and GST, a double tag that does not traffic between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (33Rosorius O. Heger P. Stelz G. Hirschmann N. Hauber J. Stauber R.H. BioTechniques. 1999; 27: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In fusion with aa 31–98, GFP-GST exhibited exclusive nuclear localization, whereas the K61–63A counterpart was found primarily in the cytoplasm (Fig. 8A). Therefore, aa 31–98 is a functional NLS and the function requires lysines at positions 61–63. Next, we assessed the effect of the K61–63A mutation on the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of p35. Wild type and mutant p35 were transiently expressed to examine their subcellular localizations (Fig. 8B). The K61–63A mutant did not exhibit a dramatic difference from the wild type in their nucleocytoplasmic localizations (Fig. 8B). To define the dist"
https://openalex.org/W2168670169,"Transcriptional regulation of podocyte gene expression in primary glomerular disease is poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate a prominent role of members of the ZHX (zinc fingers and homeoboxes) family of proteins in regulating podocyte gene expression during the development of nephrotic syndrome. While studying mechanisms of glomerular disease, rat ZHX3 was cloned from a down-regulated gene fragment; its cellular localization, DNA binding, and transcriptional repressor properties were characterized; and its ability to influence podocyte gene expression directly or via ZHX1 and ZHX2 was studied. In eukaryotic promoters, ZHX3 bound to the CdxA binding motif. ZHX proteins were mostly sequestered in the non-nuclear compartment in the normal in vivo podocyte by virtue of heterodimer formation, and loss of heterodimerization was associated with entry into the nucleus. In experimental minimal change disease, ZHX3 was transiently down-regulated prior to the onset of proteinuria, and recovery of expression was associated with migration of ZHX3 protein into the nucleus and the development of proteinuria. This expression pattern mirrored the increased nuclear ZHX3 expression noted in vivo in the podocytes in human minimal change disease biopsies. In vitro, migration of ZHX3 protein into the nucleus during recovery from transient ZHX3 knockdown reproduced the gene expression profile of in vivo minimal change disease. Severe sustained knockdown of ZHX3 caused down-regulation of genes involved in focal sclerosis, including WT1, mediated mostly by increased nuclear entry of ZHX2 and ZHX1. In summary, ZHX proteins are major transcriptional mediators of podocyte disease. Transcriptional regulation of podocyte gene expression in primary glomerular disease is poorly understood.

In summary, ZHX proteins are major transcriptional mediators of podocyte disease. Minimal change disease, membranous nephropathy, and focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) 3The abbreviations used are: FSGS, focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis; ZHX, zinc fingers and homeoboxes; SiRNA, small interfering RNA; GEC, glomerular epithelial cell; HSV, herpes simplex virus; HEK, human embryonic kidney; SEAP, secreted alkaline phosphatase; PAN, puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis. 3The abbreviations used are: FSGS, focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis; ZHX, zinc fingers and homeoboxes; SiRNA, small interfering RNA; GEC, glomerular epithelial cell; HSV, herpes simplex virus; HEK, human embryonic kidney; SEAP, secreted alkaline phosphatase; PAN, puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis. are diseases that primarily affect the podocyte. Large gaps of knowledge exist in the pathways of disease pathogenesis. Whereas changes in gene and protein expression in glomerular disorders have been described piecemeal over the past several years, transcriptional regulation of these events is unknown. Several transcriptional factors expressed in the podocyte have been implicated in the pathogenesis of human or experimental disease. Mutations in the zinc finger protein WT1 result in the development of Denys-Drash syndrome (1Pelletier J. Bruening W. Kashtan C.E. Mauer S.M. Manivel J.C. Striegel J.E. Houghton D.C. Junien C.

Also podocyte WT1 expression is dramatically reduced in the collapsing variant of focal sclerosis (3Barisoni L. Bruggeman L.A. Mundel P. D'Agati V.D. Klotman P.E. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 173-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Persistent PAX2 expression has also been noted in Denys-Drash syndrome and may be related to abnormal upstream control by mutant WT1 (4Yang Y. Jeanpierre C. Dressler G.R. Lacoste M. Niaudet P. Gubler M.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 181-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Mutations in LMX1B result in the development of nail-patella syndrome (5Dreyer S.D.

Knock-out of Pod1 results in abnormal development of the mesenchyme and podocytes, resulting in non-functional kidneys (7Quaggin S.E. Schwartz L. Cui S. Igarashi P. Deimling J. Post M. Rossant J. Development. 1999; 126: 5771-5783PubMed Google Scholar). Kreisler acts downstream of Pod1, and mice with mutations in this gene develop proteinuria and effacement of podocyte foot processes (8Sadl V. Jin F. Yu J. Cui S. Holmyard D. Quaggin S. Barsh G. Cordes S. Dev. Biol. 2002; 249: 16-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Whereas a direct role of some of these transcriptional factors has been implicated in uncommon clinical situations, transcriptional factors that influence the bulk of changes in gene expression in primary glomerular disorders are unknown. This study provides novel insight into the regulation of structurally and functionally important podocyte genes by a relatively new family of transcriptional factors studied for the first time in the podocyte. We describe the cloning, characterization, localization, and biological properties of rat zinc fingers and homeoboxes 3 (ZHX3) and discusses its role, along with that of two other family members, ZHX1 and ZHX2, in mediating early changes in gene expression during the pathogenesis of glomerular disease. Because proteinuria is a common factor of all primary podocyte disorders, changes in gene expression were studied immediately before and after the onset of proteinuria. The primary goal of these studies was to show how changes in the expression of ZHX family members mediate changes in podocyte gene expression in primary glomerular disease with a special emphasis on minimal change disease. Whereas some of these changes are also likely to be relevant to the pathogenesis of proteinuria, enquiry into this specific aspect is beyond the scope of this study. Results from this study indicate that ZHX proteins are major regulators of podocyte gene expression in minimal change disease and focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis. In view of expression of ZHX proteins in multiple organs, involvement of this gene family in the pathogenesis of other disease processes is also very likely. All animal studies were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at Northwestern University. Two groups of 100-125-g Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 4/group) were injected with 3.5 mg of γ2 nephrotoxic serum or normal sheep IgG intravenously via the tail vein as described previously (9Chugh S. Yuan H. Haydar S. Mittal V. Topham P. Kalluri R. Salant D.J. Kidney Int. 2001; 59: 601-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), urinary protein excretion over the next 18 h was measured, and both groups were euthanized 24 h after injection. Following euthanasia, small sections of kidney from each group were retained for histological studies, whereas the rest of the kidneys were pooled to extract glomeruli by sieving at 4 °C under aseptic conditions. After confirming the purity of the extracted glomeruli by light microscopy, one-fifth of the extracted glomeruli were frozen at -80 °C in the presence of protease inhibitors for future protein studies, whereas the rest of the glomeruli were used immediately for extraction of total RNA using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The total RNA extracted from different groups was quantified simultaneously as mentioned above. Some of the total RNA was used for suppression subtractive hybridization as described below. Of the rest, cDNA templates for real time PCR were generated by reverse transcription with Superscript III (Invitrogen) using 2 μg of total RNA/template and three identical thermocyclers on the same day. RNase H was added to each template at the end of reverse transcription. Templates were stored at -20 °C prior to conducting real time PCR studies. Total RNA from the nephrotoxic serum and control group glomeruli was used to generate cDNA using the Super SMART PCR cDNA synthesis kit (Clontech); cDNAs were then subjected to suppression subtractive hybridization using the PCR-Select cDNA subtraction kit (Clontech). The PCR-amplified differentially expressed products were resolved on a 1% agarose gel, visible bands were excised, and DNA was extracted, cloned into pCRII, and sequenced in sense and antisense directions. The sequences were subjected to a BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) search to identify the genes. One of the then unknown genes identified was clone 1102. TaqMan probes were developed to each fragment as described below, and the extent of differential gene expression was quantified by real time PCR. Clone 1102 containing a 1643-bp differentially expressed gene fragment was used to screen a Uni-ZAP XR rat kidney cDNA library (catalog number 937517, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Approximately one million clones of a rat kidney cDNA library were screened with clone 1102, resulting in the identification of five overlapping clones encoding for a 2863-bp fragment that extended the 3′-end of the sequence up to the poly(A) tail (Fig. 1). With the subsequent availability of the human ZHX3 sequence (NCBI, gi 28866856), the 5′-end of the gene was identified by homology search. The full-length gene was sequenced (GenBank™ accession number rat ZHX3 DQ017884) and cloned into pCRII, and full-length eukaryotic expression constructs were developed in pcDNA3.1/V5-His A. Because several experiments were planned in cultured mouse glomerular epithelial cells (GECs), mouse ZHX3 was also cloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-His B (GenBank accession number DQ317973) using primers based on existing GenBank sequences. For Northern blot analysis, rat kidney mRNA was purified from total RNA using the Oligotex mRNA maxi kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The insert of clone 1102 was excised from pCRII to generate a probe labeled with [32P]dCTP (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) using the Rediprime II random primer labeling system (GE Healthcare). Northern blots were performed under high stringency conditions. Using primers K335 (gcgcggatccaagaccatggtgctgccgggtgcca) and K336 (gcgcctcgagaagggccttggatgtgggcagggg), a part of rat ZHX3 encoding for amino acids 16-290 (including the zinc finger domain region) was cloned into pGEX-6P-1 between the BamHI and XhoI sites and expressed in Escherichia coli using standard protocols. The recombinant His-tagged protein was purified over nickel columns and used to immunize rabbits to generate a polyclonal rabbit anti-rat ZHX3 antibody, which was tested for reactivity by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blot, and immunofluorescence. The following primary antibodies were purchased from commercial sources: mouse anti-ZHX2 (Abnova, Taipei City, Taiwan), rabbit anti-ZHX1 (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX), mouse anti-V5 (Invitrogen), goat anti-V5 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), mouse anti-FLAG (Stratagene), mouse anti-HSV (Novagen, San Diego, CA), mouse anti-actin (Sigma), and rabbit anti-histone B4 (Bethyl Laboratories). A previously published clone for the cathepsin L promoter (10Charron M. Folmer J.S. Wright W.W. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 1641-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) was used. The 3198-bp insert contained the promoter region, exon 1, intron 1, and part of exon 2. The start codon was noted to be present in exon 2. Because there is an alternative start site in the cathepsin L gene, two studies to verify the transcriptional start site in glomerular RNA were first conducted. Primer extension analysis was done using total RNA from rat glomeruli, and reverse primers based in exon 1 (K453, gatccccggaggtcgccgaggtccgag) and exon 2 (K454, cagaggacagccaggaggagtaaagggg) using the avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase primer extension system (Promega). 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends was conducted with primer K455 (ggacttccactggtgccactgtgcattaaacg) and nested primer K456 (ggacagccaggaggagtaaaggggtcatggttcaaacac) from the published sequence using the Gene Racer kit (Invitrogen). After verifying that the transcriptional start site in rat glomerular and testicular mRNA was identical, a 1897-bp fragment upstream of exon 1 was cloned using primers K463 (gcgacgcgtgaagcaggtctcagtatgtagccttggctggac) and K467 (gcgctcgagggcaaggcccgcccccgccccgtc) designed from the published sequence and Sprague-Dawley genomic DNA into pCRII, and the sequence was compared with that of the existing promoter clone. The full-length cathepsin L promoter sequence (construct A, -1897 to -49, 1849 bp, primers K464 (gcgacgcgtctgggctcaaaatcatagagttcttcctggcttcc) and K467) and two deletion constructs (construct B, -1224 to -49, 1176 bp, primers K465 (gcgacgcgtcagcaagttccaggacagccaagcctacacggag) and K467; construct C, -409 to -49, 361 bp, primers K466 (gcgacgcgtccctggagaggtgactctgccctcggc) and K467) were cloned into pSEAP2 basic between the MluI and XhoI sites. A 1-kb fragment encoding the rat cathepsin B promoter region (-1009 to +61) was cloned into pSEAP2 basic between the MluI and XhoI sites using primers K378 (gcccgacgcgtggcatcagacctcagtacag) and K379 (gcgctcgaggcttgtcatgggcactggtc), rat genomic DNA, and Advantage genomic polymerase mixture. A construct for the flavin-containing monooxygenase 1 promoter region was similarly cloned into pSEAP2 basic using primers K355 (gcgcacgcgtctattctcagattcaggacacatggtaattc) and K356 (gcgcctcgagatattcacaaaagccccacccaagtc). Cathepsin L (construct A), cathepsin B, and flavin-containing monooxygenase 1 promoter region constructs were co-transfected with full-length V5-tagged rat ZHX3 or empty pcDNA/V5-His vector into HEK 293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and SEAP activity was measured in the media after 48 h. Transfection studies for promoter-reporter analysis were repeated in COS7 cells. pβgal vector (Clontech) was used for normalization of transfection. The transfection studies of the cathepsin L promoter were able to identify the minimum promoter activity in construct B but not in construct C. The cathepsin L promoter fragment between -1215 and -339 was divided into four parts (part D, -1216 to -904, primers K509 (ccaggacagccaagcctacacgg) and K510 (tcccagcttcccctcactaaa); part E, -979 to -777, primers K579 (ccaagtaatttcttcaagctaaac) and K580 (cactatgtagaccagcctggg); part F, -798 to -598, primers K575 (cccaggctggtctacatagtg) and K576 (cgggattggggatgtaggatg); and part G, -618 to -340, primers K577 (catcctacatccccaatcccg) and K578 (ctgtttaacccacaacaatgc)) that were subcloned into pCR2.1-TOPO, excised with EcoRI, and used for DNA footprinting studies. Affinity-purified V5- and His-tagged recombinant ZHX3 extracted from lysates of transfected HEK 293 cells was used for gel shift and DNA footprinting studies. For footprinting studies, these plasmids were cut with Hin-dIII and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase, and a single end-labeled probe was generated by further digesting the 3′-end with XhoI, purified by phenol:chloroform: isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and precipitated with ethanol. The DNA-protein binding reaction mixture (50 μl) contained labeled DNA probe, 2 μg of purified protein extract (prepared as described above), 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 6.125 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After incubation for 10 min on ice, 50 μl of 10 mm MgCl2 and 5 mm CaCl2 were added followed by the addition of 0.2 units of DNase I, and incubation was continued at room temperature for 2 min. DNase I digestion was quenched by the addition of 90 μl of stop solution (200 mm NaCl, 30 mm EDTA, 1% SDS), and the DNA template was purified by phenol:chloroform (1:1) extraction and ethanol precipitation. The DNA samples were dissolved in 8 μl of formamide loading dye and heated to 90 °C for 2 min. The samples were then loaded onto a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea sequencing gel. A 25-bp DNA stepladder labeled (using polynucleotide kinase) with [γ-32P]ATP was used as a size marker. For electrophoretic mobility shift assay, consensus sequences of the CdxA binding motif (A/C)TTTAT(A/G), as suggested by DNA footprinting studies, and several other putative transcriptional factor binding sites (SRY, MZF1, NF-AT, GATA-2, AML-1a, and AP-4) between -980 and -800 were used. Complementary oligonucleotides in equimolar amounts were hybridized for 5 min at 95 °C and then were allowed to cool to room temperature. The double-stranded oligonucleotide probe was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase in 20 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 4% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.05 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI·dC)) for 10 min at room temperature. 1 μl of 32P-labeled CdxA, or other binding site, consensus double-stranded oligonucleotide was added to 2 μg of recombinant ZHX3 protein and incubated for another 20 min at room temperature. In CdxA competition studies, 100-fold excess of cold consensus or cold mutant CdxA double-stranded oligonucleotide, as appropriate, were added to the reactions. For supershift assays, recombinant ZHX3 was incubated at room temperature with rabbit anti-rat Zhx3 antibody for 30 min before labeled CdxA probe was added, separated on a 6% DNA retardation polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA, dried, and developed by autoradiography. Sense strand sequences for wild type and mutant CdxA used in electrophoretic mobility shift assay studies were as follows: wild type, ATTTTT ATTTATA TGAGTGC; mutation 1, ATTTTT AATTATA TGAGTGC; mutation 2, ATTTTT ATATATA TGAGTGC; mutation 3, ATTTTT ATTAATA TGAGTGC; mutation 4, ATTTTT ATTTTTA TGAGTGC; mutation 5, ATTTTT ATTTAAA TGAGTGC. CdxA motif specific sequences are underlined, and bold letters indicate the mutations. Because the nephrotoxic serum model does not represent a specific form of human glomerular disease, the expression of ZHX3 around the onset of proteinuria was studied in puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis (PAN; a model of minimal change disease) and passive Heymann nephritis (a model of membranous nephropathy). In each model, tissue was preserved after euthanasia to confirm the induction of glomerular injury by light microscopy, immunofluorescence microscopy, and conventional electron microscopy. Isolated glomeruli were used for extracting protein or for generation of 12-24 cDNA templates for real time PCR. Special emphasis was placed on the quality of total RNA. In the initial studies, total RNA was quantified, and its quality was assessed by A260 and agarose gel electrophoresis, respectively. RNA with A260 < 2.0 was further purified by phenol:chloroform extraction. In later experiments, the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer was used to assess total RNA quality and quantity. Glomerular proteins were extracted using SDS-PAGE sample buffer without bromphenol blue and quantified as described previously (11Liu G. Kaw B. Kurfis J. Rahmanuddin S. Kanwar Y.S. Chugh S.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein were added to each lane in quantitative Western blots, and additional loading controls were done using anti-actin antibodies after stripping the membrane. Induction of PAN—15 mg/100 g puromycin aminonucleoside (Sigma) or an equivalent volume of sterile filtered phosphate-buffered saline was injected intravenously into different groups of 75-100-g male Wistar rats (n = 4 rats/group, base-line proteinuria <1 mg/18 h), and rats were euthanized on Days 3, 6, and 10 after injection. Rats develop proteinuria on Day 4 to Day 5. Prior to euthanasia, 18-h urine collection was obtained in metabolic cages, and proteinuria was assessed. Induction of Passive Heymann Nephritis—Different groups of male Wistar rats (n = 4 rats/group; rat weight, 75-100 g) were injected on 2 consecutive days with 0.75 and 0.5 ml of sheep anti-rat Fx1a or control sheep serum (Sigma), and proteinuria was measured on Days 3, 6, and 10 after the first injection. Anti-Fx1a-injected rats typically become proteinuric on Day 4 or Day 5. Different groups of rats were euthanized on Days 3, 6, and 10, and kidneys were removed and processed as for the PAN group. HEK 293 cells and mouse GECs were cultured as described previously (9Chugh S. Yuan H. Haydar S. Mittal V. Topham P. Kalluri R. Salant D.J. Kidney Int. 2001; 59: 601-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Rat ZHX3 cDNA sequence (bp 1-2847) was cloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-His A using primers K534 (5′-gcgcgaattctggccaccatggccagcaagaggaagtcc-3′) and K536 (5′-gcgcctcgagctgttcgagctgacgtccgg-3′) between the EcoRI and XhoI sites. Baseline expression of ZHX3 in these cells was first assessed by staining with anti-ZHX3 antibody. Then expression of recombinant rat ZHX3 was assessed in HEK 293 cells by staining with mouse anti-V5 antibody. Nuclei and the actin cytoskeleton were stained using TO-PRO-3 iodide and fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin, respectively. Mouse ZHX1 was cloned into TOPO-pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) using primers K795 (5′-gccaccatggcaagcagacgaaaatcaacaacacct-3′) and K796 (5′-gtcatccgatttagaaagcttccgcttca-3′) and into pIRES-hrGFP-1a (Stratagene) using primers K728 (5′-cccggcatgcgccaccatggcaagcagacgaaaatcaacaacacc-3′) and K740 (5′-gcccctcgagtcagtcatccgatttagaaagcttccgcttcacatgtcgtggg-3′). Mouse ZHX2 was cloned into pTriEx-3 Neo (Novagen) using primers K730 (5′-cgcgggatccgccaccatggcaagcaaacggaaatctacaac-3′) and K739 (5′-gcgcagatctctgcaggggtgctgtcggagtcgg-3′). Recombinant His- and V5-tagged rat ZHX3 was purified from transfected HEK 293 cells after lysis using the Probond purification system (Invitrogen). Purity of the recombinant protein was assessed by Gelcode blue (Pierce) staining of a reducing SDS-PAGE gel and Western blot with anti-V5 and anti-ZHX3 antibodies. For knockdown studies, two SiRNAs for mouse ZHX3 (SiRNA 568, 5′-UUUACAGCAAUAUACAUAGCCAUCC-3′, 5′-GGAUGGCUAUGUAUAUUGCUGUAAA-3′; SiRNA 569, 5′-UUAAGCUGUUCUUCUGGAUACUUGG-3′, 5′-CCAAGUAUCCAGAAGAACAGCUUAA-3′) synthesized by Invitrogen were transfected into mouse GECs by electroporation using the Gene Pulser XCell electroporation system (Bio-Rad) using exponential mode at 120 V, 1000 microfarads, 0.2-cm cuvettes, and a 200-μl volume. For ZHX2 knockdown, the following SiRNAs were used (SiRNA 247, 5′-CCACCCAGCGUUUAAAGCACGGUAU-3′, 5′-AUACCGUGCUUUAAACGCUGGGUGG-3′; SiRNA 248, 5′-CACUCCUCAGGAGUACGAUCAGUUA-3′,5′-UAACUGAUCGUACUCCUGAGGAGUG-3′). Control knockdown studies were performed with every transfection experiment. Nuclear and cytosolic proteins were extracted using the Transfactor extraction kit (BD Biosciences). Several steps were taken to ensure the validity of quantitative Western blots following gene knockdown. First an equal number of cells were used for each group in the knockdown experiments. Next a protein assay was done to load equal amounts of protein in each of the nuclear or cytosolic extract groups. Next Ponceau red staining of the nitrocellulose membrane was documented after transfer. Finally membranes were stripped and incubated with control antibodies against actin or histone B4 as appropriate. Because in vitro studies on the effect of changes in ZHX3 expression on target genes were planned in mouse GECs, full-length mouse ZHX3 cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-His B between the BamHI and XhoI sites using primers K691 (5′-gcgcggatccgccaccatggccagcaaaaggaagtccacc-3′) and K692 (5′-gcgcctcgagcggtctgcttcgagttgacgtccag-3′) designed from the published sequence. A 1.5-kb fragment of mouse genomic DNA upstream of exon 1 of mouse ZHX3 predicted to have promoter activity using the Neural Network Promoter Prediction program was cloned into pSEAP2-basic (Promega) and used for co-transfection studies in HEK 293 cells with mouse ZHX3-pcDNA or control constructs. Real time PCR primers and probes (FAM-MGB combination) (supplemental Tables 3 and 4) were designed for each gene of interest using Primer Express 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as described previously (11Liu G. Kaw B. Kurfis J. Rahmanuddin S. Kanwar Y.S. Chugh S.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Real time PCR was performed in 96-well format on the ABI Prism 7000 (Applied Biosystems) in multiplex mode (i.e. study primers/probe +18 S control primers/probe). In each experiment, all genes were initially screened with three to four templates per group and, if found to be differentially expressed, were confirmed by another six templates per group. Selection of Candidate Genes for Studying the Gene Expression Profile of Puromycin Nephrosis by Real Time PCR—Candidate genes met two or more of the following criteria. 1) They are critical for maintaining the structure and function of the glomerular capillary loop. 2) Within the glomerulus, they are relatively specific to the glomerular capillary loop. 3) They have been associated with or have a possibility of being associated with proteinuria. Establishment of Cutoff of Significance for in Vivo Studies—Pilot studies were conducted in various animal models to define a cutoff in gene expression that would lead to concomitant significant changes in protein expression by Western blot. The system was specifically designed to assess changes in rat glomerular mRNA expression using 18 S as a control. Mean changes in mRNA expression of 2-, 2.5-, 3-, 3.5-, and 4-fold were studied. Consistent changes in protein expression were noted at mean changes of 3-fold and above using 18 S probes for normalization. Therefore, a mean change in mRNA expression in excess of 3-fold was considered significant. Assuming that 25-33% of total RNA from glomeruli comes from a single cell type, e.g. podocyte or endothelial cell, this roughly translates to a 9-12-fold change in expression of a cell type-specific gene, e.g. nephrin for podocytes and TIE2 for endothelial cells. Immunostaining of archival frozen human kidney biopsy tissue stored after diagnostic immunofluorescence tissue sections had been taken was approved by the Ethics Committee at the Instituto Nacional De Cardiologia Ignacio Chavez, Mexico City, Mexico. Immunofluorescence staining was performed as discussed above. Age- and sex-matched controls for these biopsies were obtained from a pool of archival kidney transplant donor biopsies obtained as part of a pretransplant screening protocol. Statistical analysis of densitometry data from Western blot studies was done using the unpaired Student's t test in Microsoft Excel 2003. A value of p < 0.05 was taken as significant. Identification of Differentially Expressed Genes—To study changes in gene expression during the pathogenesis of glomerular disease, differential gene expression in glomeruli of proteinuric rats (767.90 ± 191.80 mg/18 h in the nephrotoxic serum group and 13.22 ± 2.87 mg/18 h in the control sheep Ig group) was studied by suppression subtractive hybridization-PCR. Differentially expressed glomerular genes were quantified by TaqMan real time PCR and included β1 integrin (↑3.70 ± 0.53), cathepsin L (↑6.60 ± 0.68), cathepsin D (↑7.11 ± 1.10), cathepsin B (↑3.63 ± 0.33), and flavin-containing monooxygenase 1 (↓3.28 ± 0.35). Clone 1102, now identified as ZHX3, was also down-regulated (↓3.24 ± 0.40). Some additional clones are currently under investigation. Cloning and Characterization of Rat ZHX3—Cloning of fulllength rat ZHX3 cDNA revealed an open reading frame of 2856 bp (Fig. 1). Northern blot revealed 8.8-, 6.3-, and 4.2-kb transcripts in rat kidney mRNA. Rat ZHX3 has two exons with all but the last 11 bp of the open reading frame in exon 1. Translation of the open reading frame of rat ZHX3 revealed a 951-amino acid sequence (predicted size, 105 kDa) including five HOX-like homeobox domains and two zinc finger C2H2 domains, similar to its human counterpart (12Yamada K.

Additionally, Ito,f densities are markedly down-regulated in cardiac hypertrophy and heart disease, conditions associated with activation of the serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin (Cn). In this study, we investigated the regulation of Ito,f expression by Cn in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) with and without α1-adrenoreceptor stimulation with phenylephrine (PE). Overexpression of constitutively active Cn in NRVMs induced hypertrophy and caused profound increases in Ito,f density as well as Kv4.2 mRNA and protein expression and promoter activity, without affecting Kv4.3 or KChIP2 levels. The effects of Cn on hypertrophy, Ito,f, and Kv4.2 transcription were associated with NFAT activation and were abrogated by NFAT inhibition. Despite activating Cn and inducing hypertrophy in NRVMs, PE resulted in profound down-regulation of Ito,f densities as well as Kv4.2, Kv4.3, and KChIP2 expression. Although hypertrophy and NFAT activation were inhibited by the Cn inhibitory peptide CAIN, Ito,f and Kv4.2 expression were further reduced by CAIN, whereas Cn overexpression eliminated PE-induced reductions in Ito,f and Kv4.2 expression without affecting Kv4.3 or KChIP2 levels. We conclude that Cn increases cardiac Ito,f densities by positively regulating Kv4.2 gene transcription. Consistent with this conclusion, we found that Ito,f was increased in myocytes isolated from young mice overexpressing Cn prior to the development of heart disease. This positive regulation of Kv4.2 transcription by Cn activation is expected to minimize the reductions in Ito,f and Kv4.2 expression observed in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes.

This positive regulation of Kv4.2 transcription by Cn activation is expected to minimize the reductions in Ito,f and Kv4.2 expression observed in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes. Normal cardiac repolarization is orchestrated by coordinated activity of many K+ currents, which vary between regions of the heart as well as between different species. One K+ current of particular interest in most mammalian species, including humans, is the cardiac transient outward K+ current, which is composed of fast (Ito,f) 4The abbreviations used are: Ito,f, fast transient outward K+ current; α1AR, α1-adrenoreceptor; Cn, calcineurin; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T-cells; NRVMs, neonatal rat ventricular myocytes; PE, phenylephrine; CAIN, calcineurin inhibitory peptide; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Gmax, maximal chord conductance; V½, voltage for half-maximal activation of Ito,f; Gslope, slope conductance; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; Isus, sustained current; pF, picofarad. and slow types. Ito,f is encoded by pore-forming α-subunits (i.e. Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 in rodents and Kv4.3 in humans) and auxiliary KChIP2 subunits.

Recent studies concluded that calcineurin (Cn), a Ca2+/calmodulin-activated serine/threonine phosphatase that dephosphorylates NFATc1-4 (16Doevendans P.A. van Rooij E. de Theije C.C. Babiker F.A.

This is a particularly attractive mechanism because Cn is necessary and sufficient to induce hypertrophy in rodents with pressure overload (19Shimoyama M. Hayashi D. Takimoto E. Zou Y. Oka T.

Wieczorek D.F. Molkentin J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1690-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). However, K+ currents are reported to be unchanged in young mice with cardiac overexpression of Cn, despite significant hypertrophy prior to the development of cardiomyopathy (23Petrashevskaya N.N. Bodi I. Rubio M. Molkentin J.D. Schwartz A. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 54: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Moreover, Ito,f is increased in NFATc4 transgenic mice (24Zhan S. Guo J. Molkentin J.D. Lees-Miller J.P. Duff H.J. Circulation. 2002; 106: II-283Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, despite the importance of Ito,f and Cn in heart disease, the precise role of Cn in the regulation of Ito,f remains poorly understood. Our experiments were designed to elucidate the regulation of Ito,f by Cn in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs). Our results establish that Cn overexpression strongly enhanced Ito,f and Kv4.2 transcription in an NFAT-dependent manner. In addition, Cn overexpression reversed Ito,f reductions induced by α1AR stimulation with phenylephrine (PE) via increases in Kv4.2 mRNA and protein, whereas Cn inhibition with the Cn inhibitory peptide CAIN (21Taigen T. De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Molkentin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1196-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) caused further reductions in Ito,f and Kv4.2 transcription observed with PE treatment. These results demonstrate that Cn/NFAT is a positive regulator of Ito,f via transcriptional up-regulation of Kv4.2 in myocytes and thus minimizes the degree of Ito,f reductions induced in cardiac hypertrophy. Isolation, Culture, and Intervention of NRVMs—Day 1 or 2 Sprague-Dawley NRVMs (Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Montreal, Canada) were isolated and cultured in medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum in the presence of 0.1 mmol/liter bromodeoxyuridine (Sigma) following removal of non-myocytes by pre-plating (37 °C, 1 h) as described previously (25Wickenden A.D. Kaprielian R. Parker T.G. Jones O.T. Backx P.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 504: 271-286Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). After 24 h, the myocytes were cultured in the absence of serum (and supplemented with insulin-transferrin-selenium-X (Invitrogen), 25 μg/ml ascorbic acid, and 1 nmol/liter LiCl) and infected with adenoviruses (green fluorescent protein (GFP), CAIN, constitutively active Cn, ΔNFATc3, or VIVIT (a peptide consisting of Met-Ala-Gly-Pro-His-Pro-Val-Ile-Val-Ile-Thr-Gly-Pro-His-Glu-Glu designed to inhibit Cn-mediated NFAT activation (32Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar); VIVIT adenoviruses were kindly provided by Dr. S. D. Kraner) at a multiplicity of infection of 5-10 for 16 h. Myocyte cultures were then washed and incubated in the presence or absence of the α1AR agonist PE (100 μmol/liter) for 48 h. Infection efficiency was typically >98%, with minimal cell death at these levels of multiplicity of infection. Myocytes were plated on laminin-coated coverslips at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/ml for experiments involving immunofluorescence staining and electrophysiological recordings and at 5 × 105 cells/ml for all other experiments. Immunofluorescence Staining of NRVMs—Immunoconfocal fluorescence was used to assess myocyte size and numbers. To perform these experiments, cultured cells were fixed and permeabilized with methanol (-20 °C, 15 min). After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated with 1:200 anti-α-actinin monoclonal antibody (sarcomeric; Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline with 1% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1 h. Phosphate-buffered saline-washed cells were subsequently incubated at room temperature for 30 min with 1:400 Alexa Fluor® 488-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (H + L; Molecular Probes) and viewed under a confocal microscope. Typically, >98% of the cells were α-actinin-positive 96 h after NRVM isolation, confirming the dominance of myocytes in the culture. [3H]Leucine Uptake Experiments—The rate of protein synthesis was measured by [3H]leucine uptake experiments. Cells were cultured in leucine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 (Sigma) in the presence of 1 μCi/ml [3H]leucine with or without 100 μmol/liter PE for 48 h. Cells were then incubated with 10% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C for 2 h, followed by cell lysis with 1 n NaOH. Each of the lysed samples was added to 7 ml of ScintiSafe™ 30% liquid scintillation mixture (Fisher) in a 20-ml polyethylene scintillation vial (Fisher) and subjected to liquid scintillation counting. Electrophysiological Recordings in NRVMs—Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were done as described previously (8Zobel C. Kassiri Z. Nguyen T.T. Meng Y. Backx P.H. Circulation. 2002; 106: 2385-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 25Wickenden A.D. Kaprielian R. Parker T.G. Jones O.T. Backx P.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 504: 271-286Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar) at room temperature. Whole-cell currents were filtered at 2 kHz (Axon 200A amplifier). Myocytes were perfused with drug-free extracellular solution for at least 15 min before measurements were performed. The extracellular solution contained 140 mmol/liter NaCl, 4 mmol/liter KCl, 2 mmol/liter CaCl2, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, 0.5 mmol/liter CdCl2, 10 mmol/liter HEPES, and 10 mmol/liter glucose (pH 7.4). The intracellular solution contained 140 mmol/liter KCl, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, 10 mmol/liter EGTA, 10 mmol/liter HEPES, and 5 mmol/liter MgATP (pH 7.25). Chord conductance (G) was calculated according to the following equation: G = I/(Vm - EK), where I is Ito,f recorded in response to step depolarization to Vm and EK represents the Nernst potential for K+ ions. Fits of the relationship between G and Vm to the Boltzmann equation allow estimation of the maximal chord conductance (Gmax) and the voltage for half-maximal activation of Ito,f (i.e. V½). Slope conductance (Gslope) was estimated by linear regression of the relationship between peak Ito,f and Vm at step voltages ranging from +10 to +60 mV. Electrophysiological Recordings in Cardiomyocytes from Young Mouse Hearts—Cardiomyocytes were dissociated from the ventricular apices of 3-4-week-old non-transgenic and Cn-overexpressing transgenic mice according to the technique described previously (23Petrashevskaya N.N. Bodi I. Rubio M. Molkentin J.D. Schwartz A. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 54: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were done as described previously (26Xu J. Gong N.L. Bodi I. Aronow B.J. Backx P.H. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9152-9162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) at room temperature. Cardiomyocytes were perfused with normal Tyrode's solution containing 138 mmol/liter NaCl, 4 mmol/liter KCl, 2 mmol/liter CaCl2, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, 10 mmol/liter glucose, 10 mmol/liter HEPES, and 0.33 mmol/liter NaH2PO4 (adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH). L-type Ca2+ current was eliminated by 0.3 mmol/liter CdCl2 included in the recording solution. The pipette solution contained 120 mmol/liter potassium glutamate, 10 mmol/liter KCl, 2 mmol/liter MgCl2, 10 mmol/liter HEPES, 5 mmol/liter EGTA, and 2 mmol/liter MgATP (adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH). RNA Extraction and Quantitative Real-time PCR Analysis— Total RNA was extracted from NRVMs using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer and treated with RNase-free DNase I. cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA using SuperScript™ (Invitrogen) and amplified by real-time PCR (Applied Biosystems). For KChIP2, TaqMan probe and primers (assay ID Rn01411445_g1) were used for mRNA quantification. Kv4.2, Kv4.3, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were quantified using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The primers for Kv4.2 were 5′-GTGTCAGGAAGTCATAGAGGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTACAAAGCAGACACCCTGA-3′ (reverse). The primers for Kv4.3 were 5′-CACCACCTGCTACACTGCTTAGAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCTGCTCATCAATAAACTCGTGGTT-3′ (reverse). The primers for GAPDH were 5′-TGCACCACCAACTGCTTAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GATGCAGGGATGATGTTC-3′ (reverse). mRNA determinations were done in duplicate using standard curves, and specificity was confirmed using 2% agarose gel and/or melting curves. Western Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were collected and lysed in Laemmli buffer. Equal amounts of protein (determined using the Bio-Rad RC DC assay) were loaded, separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Kv4.2 or Kv4.3 (Chemicon) or KChIP2 (Affinity BioReagents). GAPDH was detected by a mouse monoclonal antibody (Research Diagnostics, Inc.). Anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) were used as secondary antibodies to allow protein visualization with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Isolation of the KChIP2 Promoter and Cloning into the pGL3-Basic Vector—Rat genomic DNA was isolated from Sprague-Dawley rat livers using previously described methods (27Davis L.G. Dibner M.D. Battey J.F. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1986: 47-50Crossref Google Scholar). The KChIP2 promoter region (-1524 to +312) was isolated from rat genomic DNA by Advantage™-GC genomic PCR (BD Biosciences) using primers designed according to the nucleotide sequence of NW_043419. The primers used were 5′-TAAGCTAGCTGTGGGGTGCATCATCTCTATTCA-3′ (forward) with the addition of an NheI site and 5′-AACCCCGGGAACTATCACCGACTCACCCGTAAG-3′ (reverse) with the addition of an SmaI site at the 5′-end. Following purification, the amplified DNA was digested with NheI and SmaI and subcloned into the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega Corp.). Positive clones containing the KChIP2 promoter were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing and Dual-Luciferase assay. Transfection and Promoter Activity Measurements—For promoter experiments, myocytes were transfected 16 h after viral infection with pGL3 with a firefly luciferase reporter gene driven by the Kv4.2 (kindly provided by Dr. K. Takimoto) (28Jia Y. Takimoto K. Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 60: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), Kv4.3 (kindly provided by Dr. E. S. Levitan) (29Zhang T.T. Takimoto K. Stewart A.F.

Cell lysates were obtained 48 h after transfection to measure Dual-Luciferase activity (Promega Corp.). In the experiments to measure the activation of Cn/NFAT, NRVMs were transfected with pGL3 with a firefly luciferase reporter gene driven by a promoter containing three NFAT cis-elements (kindly provided by Dr. A. Rao). Statistical Analysis—All data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was calculated using Student's t test to compare two groups and analysis of variance to compare multiple groups. p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Cn Increases Ito,f via NFAT-dependent Increases in Kv4.2 Transcription—To examine the regulation of Ito,f by Cn, we overexpressed constitutively active Cn in NRVMs. As reported previously (30Molkentin J.D.

Res. 2000; 86: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), Cn overexpression induced marked myocyte hypertrophy as determined by cell microscopy, cell capacitance data, and [3H]leucine uptake experiments (Fig. 1A). Rather than decreasing Ito,f, as might be expected from previous studies (17Perrier E. Perrier R. Richard S. Benitah J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40634-40639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18Rossow C.F. Minami E. Chase E.G. Murry C.E. Santana L.F. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1340-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), Cn caused a 2-fold increase in Ito,f density, which was quantified as the difference in the peak current minus the sustained current (Isus) at the end of the pulse divided by the cell capacitance. Ito,f density recorded at +60 mV (Fig. 1, B and C; and Table 1) was increased in myocytes overexpressing Cn compared with control myocytes. As expected, Gslope, which gives a more direct measure of the extent of Ito,f enhancement, was also increased in myocytes overexpressing Cn compared with control myocytes, along with increased Gmax of Ito,f (Table 1). The increases in Ito,f density and conductance were not accompanied by shifts (p = 0.57) in the voltage dependence of Ito,f activation as assessed by estimates of the voltages required for Ito,f to reach 50% of the maximal conductance (V½) (data not shown). In addition, there were no changes in the time course of Ito,f inactivation (data not shown). The effect of Cn overexpression on Ito,f appeared to be specific because the current density remaining at the end of the voltage step (i.e. Isus) was not changed (p > 0.50) in myocytes by overexpression of Cn (Table 1).TABLE 1Electrophysiological properties of Ito,f and Isus recorded in NRVMs Data are the means ± S.E. The values were calculated from the current recordings illustrated in Figs. 1 and 4. Gslope is estimated from the slope conductance of Ito,f (between +10 and +60 mV). Gmax is the maximal conductance estimated from plots of Ito,f/(Vm – EK) (see “Experimental Procedures”). n indicates the number of cells studied.GFPCnGFP + PECAIN + PECn + PEn66666Ito,f (pA/pF) at +60 mV16.3 ± 3.734.5 ± 5.4ap < 0.05 versus GFP1.7 ± 0.3ap < 0.05 versus GFP0.5 ± 0.3ap < 0.05 versus GFP,bp < 0.05 versus GFP + PE20.6 ± 5.4bp < 0.05 versus GFP + PEGslope of Ito,f (pA/(pF·mV))0.226 ± 0.0620.497 ± 0.084ap < 0.05 versus GFP0.033 ± 0.006ap < 0.05 versus GFP0.015 ± 0.004ap < 0.05 versus GFP,bp < 0.05 versus GFP + PE0.293 ± 0.082bp < 0.05 versus GFP + PEGmax of Ito,f (pA/(pF·mV))0.112 ± 0.0240.238 ± 0.034ap < 0.05 versus GFP0.012 ± 0.002ap < 0.05 versus GFP0.003 ± 0.002ap < 0.05 versus GFP,bp < 0.05 versus GFP + PE0.142 ± 0.034bp < 0.05 versus GFP + PEIsus (pA/pF) at +60 mV6.8 ± 1.36.8 ± 0.95.8 ± 0.87.5 ± 2.05.5 ± 1.0a p < 0.05 versus GFPb p < 0.05 versus GFP + PE Open table in a new tab To test whether the increases in Ito,f induced by Cn were associated with changes in the expression of genes encoding Ito,f, we measured the expression of Kv4.2, Kv4.3, and KChIP2. As shown in Fig. 2, Cn overexpression increased Kv4.2 mRNA and protein, without affecting Kv4.3 or KChIP2 expression compared with control cells. To investigate whether the increases in Kv4.2 mRNA were related to increased transcription activity (versus changes in mRNA stability), NRVMs were transfected with Kv4.2 (28Jia Y. Takimoto K. Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 60: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), Kv4.3 (29Zhang T.T. Takimoto K. Stewart A.F. Zhu C. Levitan E.S. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and KChIP2 promoter constructs. Fig. 3A shows that overexpression of Cn increased the activity of the Kv4.2EB promoter (-3162 to +592). This increase in Kv4.2EB promoter activity, as well as the changes in Ito,f, appeared to be mediated by NFAT dephosphorylation because Ito,f recorded at +60 mV in NRVMs upon overexpression of Cn was reduced to 8.71 ± 2.25 pA/picofarad (pF) (n = 6) when co-infected with adenoviral VIVIT (32Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), a selective inhibitory peptide of Cn-mediated NFAT dephosphorylation. VIVIT overexpression alone did not alter Ito,f (11.52 ± 1.86 pA/pF, n = 5). Cn-mediated Kv4.2 promoter activity was abolished by coinfection with VIVIT, which alone had no effect on basal Kv4.2 promoter activity (Fig. 3A), and Cn overexpression induced a 6-fold increase in NFAT activity (Fig. 3B), whereas overexpression of ΔNFATc3 (i.e. constitutively active NFATc3) (33Dai Y.S. Xu J. Molkentin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9936-9948Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) stimulated Kv4.2EB promoter activity by similar amounts (Fig. 3A). By contrast, neither Cn nor ΔNFATc3 overexpression altered the activity of the Kv4.3 (-2337 to +54), Kv4.3 (-663 to +54), or KChIP2 (-1524 to +312) promoter (data not shown), consistent with mRNA and protein results (Fig. 2). These results establish that Cn increases Ito,f via NFAT-dependent increases in Kv4.2 transcription.FIGURE 3Activity of the Kv4.2EB promoter in NRVMs overexpressing GFP, Cn, ΔNFATc3, or VIVIT (A) and activity of a promoter containing three NFAT cis-elements in NRVMs overexpressing GFP or Cn (B). Sixteen hours after viral infection, cells were transfected with pGL3 with the firefly luciferase gene driven by the Kv4.2EB promoter or a promoter containing three NFAT cis-elements. pRL-TK encoding Renilla luciferase was cotransfected as a control for transfection efficiency. Cell lysates were obtained 48 h after transfection and subjected to Dual-Luciferase assay.

To achieve this, we overexpressed either CAIN or constitutively active Cn in NRVMs in the presence of 100 μmol/liter PE for 48 h. As expected from a previous study (8Zobel C. Kassiri Z. Nguyen T.T. Meng Y. Backx P.H. Circulation. 2002; 106: 2385-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), PE treatment induced marked myocyte hypertrophy based on cell microscopy, cell capacitance data, and [3H]leucine uptake experiments (Fig. 4A) and increased NFAT activity by 4-fold compared with myocytes not treated with PE (Fig. 4B). In addition, overexpression of CAIN (21Taigen T. De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Molkentin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1196-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), a specific inhibitory peptide of Cn, inhibited NFAT activation and prevented hypertrophy following treatment with PE, confirming the essential role of Cn signaling in α1AR-induced hypertrophy. Consistent with previous studies (8Zobel C. Kassiri Z. Nguyen T.T. Meng Y. Backx P.H. Circulation. 2002; 106: 2385-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 34Jia Y. Takimoto K. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 386-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), Fig. 4 (C and D) and Table 1 show that Ito,f densities along with Gslope and Gmax were decreased in PE-treated myocytes compared with control myocytes without PE. However, contrary to expectations based on studies concluding that Cn is responsible for Ito,f reductions (17Perrier E. Perrier R. Richard S. Benitah J.P. J. Biol.

On the other hand, CAIN overexpression did not alter (p > 0.40) the basal levels of Ito,f densities, Gslope, or Gmax (data not shown). Remarkably, as shown in Fig. 4 (C and D) and Table 1, overexpression of constitutively active Cn (31De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Taigen T. Wencker D. Condorelli G. Dorn II, G.W. Kitsis R.N. Molkentin J.D.

We have previously shown that Gal-3 can import into the nucleus through at least two pathways; via passive diffusion and/or active transport (Nakahara, S., Oka, N., Wang, Y., Hogan, V., Inohara, H, and Raz, A. (2006) Cancer Res. 66, 9995-10006). Here, we investigated the process mediated by the active nuclear transport of Gal-3 and have identified a nuclear localization signal (NLS)-like motif in its protein sequence, 223HRVKKL228, that resembles p53 and c-Myc NLSs (378SRHKKL383, 322AKRVKL327), respectively. Moreover, trimers of enhanced green fluorescence protein (3×GFP) fused with this NLS-like sequence, which is too large to passively diffuse through the nuclear pores, accumulated in the cell nuclei. To gain insights into this newly identified nuclear import mechanism, the interaction between Gal-3 and importins (importins α and β) that carry the NLS harboring nuclear proteins into the nucleus, was investigated. Pull-down assays and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis revealed that wild-type Gal-3, but not mutant Gal-3 (R224A), binds to importin-α. Down-regulation of importin-β by RNA interference (RNAi) efficiently abrogates its nuclear accumulation. Furthermore, we provide evidence that impaired nuclear translocation of mutant Gal-3 protein (R224A) results in accelerated degradation compared with the wild-type protein. Thus, these results suggest that Gal-3 is translocated to the nucleus, in part, via the importin-α/β route and that Arg224 amino acid residue of human Gal-3 is essential for its active nuclear translocation and its molecular stability.

In patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, elevated expression of Gal-3 in the nuclei was suggested to be an important pathological parameter related to histological differentiation and vascular invasion (22Shibata T. Noguchi T. Takeno S. Takahashi Y. Fumoto S. Kawahara K. Oncol. Rep. 2005; 13: 235-239PubMed Google Scholar).Analysis of in vitro nuclear import assay using digitonin-permeabilized cells revealed that there are at least two pathways for the nuclear import of Gal-3, passive diffusion and active transport dependent on its N-terminal region (23Nakahara S. Oka N. Wang Y. Hogan V. Inohara H. Raz A. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9995-10006Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, the possible role of the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) in Gal-3 nuclear translocation process was difficult to determine using this system because it bound to the cell surface glycoproteins and/or glycolipids through its β-galactoside binding site, resulting in inhibition of transport (23Nakahara S. Oka N. Wang Y. Hogan V. Inohara H. Raz A. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9995-10006Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, the complete mechanism of Gal-3 nuclear import is not fully understood and a different approach avoiding the use of digitonin-permeabilized cells is required to study and establish the critical role of CRD for Gal-3 nuclear import.Here, we have identified an NLS-like sequence, 223HRVKKL228, in the C-terminal region of the human Gal-3 that is similar to p53 and c-Myc NLSs (24Shaulsky G. Goldfinger N. Ben-Ze'ev A. Rotter V. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 6565-6577Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 25Chen M.H. Ben-Efraim I. Mitrousis G. Walker-Kopp N. Sims P.J. Cingolani G. J.

Cell Res. 2003; 282: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and studied its function(s). NLS-containing proteins, like p53, are transported into the nucleus by the importin (karyopherin) α/β complex (26Fabbro M. Henderson B.R. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 282: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 27Xu L. Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 28Kau T.R. Way J.C. Silver P.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 106-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Importin-α is the receptor subunit that recognizes the NLS, a cluster of basic amino acid residues that complex with importin-β for passage through the nuclear pore (29Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar, 30Weis K. Cell. 2003; 112: 441-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). The presence of several isoforms of importin-α proteins in mammals recognizing variants of the classic NLS was reported (31Sekimoto T. Imamoto N. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7067-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), suggesting that the nuclear import process might be different for each protein depending in part on specifically regulated biological functions. This study also shows that deletion of the C-terminal region of Gal-3 protein without the NLS-like motif (1-222) results in complete impairment of nuclear accumulation, whereas a different C-terminal deletion protein that includes this motif (1-229) can be accumulated in the nucleus. In addition, substitution of Arg to Ala at position 224 (R224A) of the human Gal-3 efficiently abolished nuclear localization. To conclude, the studies shown here revealed that Gal-3 directly binds to importin-α proteins and complexes with the importin-α/β complex in vivo. Moreover, the failure to translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus resulted in a rapid degradation of Gal-3.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Transfection—COS-7, HeLa and HT1080 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). These cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA) and antibiotics (50 international units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin) (Cellgro, Herndon, VA) under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transfection into COS-7 or HT1080 cells was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For siRNA transfection to down-regulate the expression level of human importin-β1, karyopherin β1 siRNA (h) (sc-35736, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was purchased and used. Selection was performed via the addition of 1000 μg/ml G418 (Cellgro) to establish stable transfectants. Cell culture with addition of the reagents was performed as follows. In the case of leptomycin B treatment, at 24 h after transfections, COS-7 cells were treated with 30 ng/ml of leptomycin B (Sigma) for 4 h at 37 °C. In the case of cycloheximide (CHX) treatment, at 24 h after transfection COS-7 cells were treated with 100 ng/ml of CHX (Sigma) for the time indicated.Plasmid Construction—The constructs for wild type (WT/GFP), C-terminal-deleted Gal-3 (1-222/GFP, 1-229/GFP), SV40NLS (NLS+×2GFP) fused with GFP, and 2× EGFP (2× GFP) for mammalian expression were described previously (23Nakahara S.

For construction of C-terminal His-tagged wild type Gal-3 (Gal-3/C(WT)), the PCR product using the primers (a 5′ primer, the same as above and a 3′ primer, (5′-CGGAATTCTATCATGGTATATGAAGC-3′) was subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Myc-His A (Invitrogen). C-terminal His-tagged deletion mutant Gal-3/C-(1-222) was made by subcloning the fragment cut from 1-222/GFP with EcoRI and ApaI into pcDNA3.1/Myc-His B (Invitrogen). For construction of N-terminal His-tagged wild-type Gal-3 (Gal-3/N(WT)) and deletion mutant (Gal-3/N-(63-250)), the fragment cut from pGEX/Gal-3 and cleaved Gal-3 (32Fukumori T. Takenaka Y. Yoshii T.

To create the expression vectors including Gal-3 NLS-like sequence (222NHRVKKLNE230) and its mutated sequence (R224A) fused with 3× EGFP (3× GFP/RVKKL, 3× GFP/AVKKL), two sets of synthesized oligonucleotides (for 3× GFP/RVKKL; 5′-CAATCATCGGGTTAAAAAACTCAATGAGGGCC-3′ and 5′-CTCATTGAGTTTTTTAACCCGATGATTGGTAC-3′, and for 3× GFP/AVKKL; 5′-CAATCATGCGGTTAAAAAACTCAATGAGGGCC-3′ and 5′-CTCATTGAGTTTTTTAACCGCATGATTGGTAC-3′) were annealed and subcloned into 3× GFP vector described previously (23Nakahara S.

In the case of GFP expression, cells were washed with PBS and counterstained with 5 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), then mounted with Crystal/Mount reagent (Biomeda, Foster City, CA). In the other cases, cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min after fixation.

Adjusted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (8-12.5%) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with 0.1% casein in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and then incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After washes for 5 min with PBS-T, it was incubated with the secondary fluorescence-labeled antibodies for 1 h at room temperature and finally washed three times with PBS-T. The fluorescence-labeled bands were detected with the Odyssey system (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). The density of the band was also determined with the Odyssey software.

Recombinant Gal-3 proteins (wild type, R224A mutant) were expressed and purified as described previously (23Nakahara S. Oka N. Wang Y. Hogan V. Inohara H. Raz A.

Lysates from bacteria expressing GST (20 μg) or GST-importins (each 15 μg) were incubated with GSH-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) and resuspended as 1:1 slurry with transport buffer (23Nakahara S. Oka N. Wang Y. Hogan V. Inohara H. Raz A. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9995-10006Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The beads were mixed with 1 μg of Gal-3 and dissolved in final 150 μl of transport buffer. After incubation for 1.5 h at room temperature, the beads were washed five times with transport buffer and subject to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis.BiFC Analysis—The plasmids for BiFC chimeras [YC/α1, YN/β, YC/WT, YN/WT, YC/224, and YN/224] were transiently co-transfected with the indicated pair into COS-7 cells by means of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 24-36 h after transfection, COS-7 cells were plated for 15 h at 30 °C on coverslips to induce maturation of the YFP fluorophore (33Hu C.D.

Fluorescence images were acquired with an Olympus BX40 microscope and processed with imaging software (MCID).Lactose Precipitation—Lactose-conjugated agarose was used to check lactose binding capacity of wild-type Gal-3 and its mutants (10Dagher S.F. Wang J.L. Patterson R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1995; 92: 1213-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole cell extracts (200 μg) from each transfected cell line were mixed with 15 μl of 1:1 lactose-conjugated agarose slurry (Sigma) followed by agitation at 4 °C for 1.5 h. At the same time, 10% of whole cell extracts was saved as an input. After three washes with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, samples were subject to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis.In Vitro Degradation Assay—Recombinant GFP-fused Gal-3 and mutant Gal-3 (R224A) proteins were expressed and purified as described above. Each GFP-fused Gal-3 (25 ng) was mixed with 10 μg of whole cell lysates (protease inhibitor-free) from COS-7 cells and dissolved in final 15 μl of PBS. After incubation at 37 °C for indicated time, samples were subject to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis.RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNAs from transfected COS-7 cells were isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR analysis was performed using AccessQuick RT-PCR system (Promega, Madison, WI) with 1 μg of RNA from each cell as a template. For detection of GFP mRNA expression, 40 cycles (95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min) were performed with the following primers: 5′ primer, 5′-CGGGATCCATCGCCACCATGGT-3′ and 3′ primer, 5′-CGGGATCCCTTGTACAGCTCGTC-3′. For detection of β-actin mRNA as an internal control, 25 cycles (95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min) were performed with the following primers: 5′ primer, 5′-TGACGGGGTCACCCACACTGTGCCCAT-3′ and 3′ primer, 5′-CTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGGACGATGGAGGG-3′. After RT-PCR, samples were electrophoresed on 1.0% agarose gel containing SYBR Gold nucleic acid gel stain reagent (Molecular Probes), and the intensity of each band was detected with a Kodak Digital Science Image System.RESULTSSubcellular Localization of NLS-like Sequence Deleted or Point-mutated Gal-3 Proteins—To address the possibility that the 223HRVKKL228 sequence of Gal-3 is functionally homologous with p53 and c-Myc NLSs (Refs. 24Shaulsky G.

We constructed fusion proteins whereby wild-type Gal-3 fused with GFP at its C terminus (WT/GFP) and its point mutants in the target sequence by sitedirected mutagenesis where we have substituted Arg224, Lys226, and Lys227 with Ala (R224A, K226A, K227A), respectively, and in addition constructed two C-terminal-deleted mutants proteins with or without the above sequence (1-229/GFP and 1-222/GFP), respectively (Fig. 1B). To confirm the correct expression of the deletion and point mutants of EGFP-fused Gal-3 as well as 2× EGFP (2× GFP) proteins, Western blotting of the transfected COS-7 cell lysates was performed using antibodies to GFP and Gal-3 (TIB166) (Fig. 1C). All plasmids expressed proteins of the expected molecular weights in Western blotting of either GFP (Fig. 1C, green), and/or Gal-3 (Fig. 1C, red) indicated the correct expression of Gal-3 polypeptides (Fig. 1C, yellow). Thereafter, each plasmid was transfected into COS-7 cells and cultured for 24 h at 37 °C. The cells were then fixed and visualized under a fluorescence microscope. The representative microscopic fields are depicted in Fig. 1D. EGFP expression of 1-222/GFP, which does not include the above NLS-like Gal-3 sequence, was outside the nucleus (Fig. 1D, panels a and a′). However, 1-229/GFP Gal-3-protein, which contains that sequence, was found to be localized in the nuclear compartment (Fig. 1D, panels b and b′), implying that the consecutive amino acid residues (223-229) of Gal-3 partially control its cellular distribution. Moreover, high expression of R224A mutant protein was located predominantly outside the nucleus (Fig. 1D, panels d and d′), whereas the GFP expression patterns of K226A and K227A protein mutants were diffusely spread throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 1D, panels e, e′,f, and f′). Whereas, the expression of wild-type Gal-3 protein wa"

We have investigated the role of collagen I proteolysis in both regulating proliferation and maintaining the activated myofibroblastic phenotype of stellate cells in vitro. Compared with stellate cells plated on normal collagen I, those plated on a collagenase-resistant form of collagen I (r/r collagen) had reduced thymidine incorporation and proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression but increased p21 expression. Collagen I was shown to be rendered resistant to matrix metalloproteinases by artificial cross-linking in vitro using tissue transglutaminase exerted similar antiproliferative effects on stellate cells to r/r collagen. Of the stellate cell activation markers examined (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1, alpha-smooth muscle actin, matrix metalloproteinases-2 and -9, and procollagen I) only the last was decreased by culture on r/r collagen relative to normal collagen I. Antagonists of integrin alphavbeta3, an integrin reported to stimulate stellate cell proliferation, significantly inhibited adhesion, proliferation, and procollagen I synthesis of stellate cells plated on normal collagen I but had reduced effectiveness on these parameters in cells on r/r collagen. We conclude that proliferation of stellate cells is promoted by pericellular collagen I proteolysis acting via alphavbeta3 integrin. Cross-linking of collagen I by tissue transglutaminase, a process known to occur in chronic liver fibrosis, might not only increase its resistance to matrix metalloproteinases thereby inhibiting resolution of fibrosis but also functions to constrain the fibroproliferative process."

Together the results form the basis for a water partitioning model that can account for both preferential hydration and water/osmolyte-mediated conformational changes in protein structure. It is becoming ever more apparent that water plays a major role both in stabilizing protein structures and in modulating protein dynamics (1Tanford C. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 39: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 15Bennion B.J. Daggett V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6433-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Many of the impressive advances in understanding the interplay between water and proteins and the resulting impact on protein stability have been derived from thermodynamic analyses and simulations (14Bennion B.J. Daggett V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5142-5147Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 16Timasheff S.N.

A. 2000; 97: 3987-3992Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Molecular level probing of the hydration shell of proteins under conditions that either enhance or destabilize native structures has proven to be a more daunting task due to the relative dearth of suitable probes and probe techniques. In the present study we utilize pyranine (HPT) 2The abbreviations used are: HPT, pyranine (8-hydroxy-1,3,6-pyrenetrisulfonic acid, trisodium salt); Oac, acetate; DPG, diphosphoglycerate; HbA, adult hemoglobin; PEG, polyethylene glycol; VSBLS, vibrational side band luminescence spectroscopy; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. as a site-specific fluorescent probe that provides direct spectroscopic detail relating to interactions within hydration layers. In addition, the hydration shell information provided by pyranine is supplemented with Gd3+ vibronic side band data that expose how hydrogen bonding between first and second hydration shell waters is influenced by osmolytes. Together the results from these two probes directly relate to issues such as preferential hydration and osmolyte-induced changes in protein stability. The results are consistent with a relatively simple model that partitions waters and the associated water interactions into three domains: surface waters directly interacting with the hydrated molecule (e.g. protein, cation, chelate etc.), waters within the hydration layer that are impacted by these surface waters, and bulk solvent. The results also support the concept of at least two modes through which osmolytes can alter water interactions within the hydration layer: traditional preferential hydration mechanisms and alteration of hydrogen bonding patterns. The fluorescence from pyranine (8-hydroxy-1,3,6-pyrene trisulfonate, referred to as HPT in the subsequent text) is highly responsive to the composition of its solvent shell. This sensitivity arises from the dissociation/recombination behavior of the single ionizable hydroxyl on the HPT fluorophore (18Gutman M. Nachliel E. Huppert D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 125: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 19Flora K.K. Dabrowski M.A. Musson S.P. Brennan J.D. Can. J. Chem.-Rev. Can. Chim. 1999; 77: 1617-1625Google Scholar). For the electronic ground state of HPT, the pKa of this proton is ∼7; whereas, in the excited state, the pKa decreases to less than one (18Gutman M. Nachliel E. Huppert D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 125: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). At pH 6.5, excitation at 355 nm accesses the low pKa excited state resulting in proton dissociation with subsequent transfer to surrounding water molecules. Under these conditions the 355-nm excitation yields a single emission band at 513 nm originating from the transfer of the dissociated proton to water and a slow recombination back to the HPT. In the presence of weak proton acceptors such as immobilized water, alcohols, or polyols in general, the extended proton transfer does not occur and the resulting fluorescence maximum shifts to 435 nm. As a result, the ratio of these two peaks in the fluorescence spectrum from HPT reflects the composition of the solvent shell of the HPT with respect to mobile waters and poor proton acceptors. This property has been previously exploited to probe the alcohol content of Sol-Gels during and after gelation (19Flora K.K. Dabrowski M.A. Musson S.P. Brennan J.D. Can. J. Chem.-Rev. Can. Chim. 1999; 77: 1617-1625Google Scholar, 20Keeling-Tucker T. Brennan J.D. Chem. Materials. 2001; 13: 3331-3350Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In the present study this sensitivity is exploited to probe: (i) the extent to which added glycerol invades the hydration shell of both free and HbA-bound HPT, and (ii) modulation of this effect as a function of added osmolytes including PEG, urea, trehalose and Mg2+. The potential utility of the HPT fluorescence as a probe of hydration is further enhanced by the observation that HPT, a known fluorescent analog of DPG, binds stoichiometrically to the DPG binding site of human adult hemoglobin (HbA), which is located at the ββ terminus of the water-filled central cavity running through the central core of the α1β1/α2β2 HbA tetramer (21MacQuarrie R. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5832-5835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Chen Q. Lalezari I. Nagel R.L. Hirsch R.E. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 2057-2067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This site is on the periphery of the protein, where the bound HPT is in contact with the hydration shell waters of HbA. Consequently, HPT fluorescence from HbA-bound HPT versus that from dilute HbA-free HPT samples can be compared as a function of added polyols. Such a comparison permits a direct evaluation of the degree of preferential hydration (reflected in the relative exclusion of the polyol from the hydration shell for protein-bound versus protein-free HPT) at the DPG binding site of HbA as a function of added glycerol in the presence and absence of osmolytes. The present pyranine-based study uses two experimental protocols. In the first, the fluorescence spectrum of HbA-bound and HbA-free HPT is generated in solution and in Sol-Gel matrices as a function of added glycerol. The Sol-Gel study is included because there are growing indications that the unusual Sol-Gel induced damping of protein dynamics (26Abbruzetti S. Viappiani C. Bruno S. Bettati S. Bonaccio M. Mozzarelli A. J. Nanosci. Nanotechnol. 2001; 1: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 36Samuni U. Roche C.J. Dantsker D. Juszczak L.J. Friedman J.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2820-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) is attributed to altered hydration layers in which there is a decrease in the mobility of hydration shell waters and hence those protein dynamics that are slaved to water mobility. This component of the study seeks to compare the extent to which the hydration shell surrounding the HPT-occupied DPG binding site of HbA preferentially excludes glycerol over water compared with the hydration shell of the free HPT probe in solution (37Gekko K. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4667-4676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). The second protocol entails having the free and HbA-bound HPT samples in both solution and in Sol-Gel exposed to an aqueous buffer solvent that is 50% glycerol by volume. The relative water/glycerol occupancy of the hydration shell of HPT for the different samples is then probed as a function of added osmolytes that are likely to either change the relative composition of the hydration layer through any of several possible mechanisms. Polyethylene glycol (PEG400 and PEG5000) is used as a prototype osmolyte that exerts influence through its preferential exclusion from the hydration layer. Smaller osmolytes such as urea, Mg2+, and trehalose are used as osmolytes that are anticipated to exert influence by either weakening (urea and magnesium) or enhancing (trehalose) the hydrogen bonding capacity of water (14Bennion B.J. Daggett V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5142-5147Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 15Bennion B.J. Daggett V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The working hypothesis that is supported by the experimental results is that preferential exclusion of glycerol from the hydration shell of proteins can be modulated by the addition of other osmolytes either by enhancing osmotic stress through additional preferential exclusion or by altering the hydrogen bonding properties of water molecules. The second component of the study utilizes Gd3+ vibronic sideband luminescence spectroscopy (VSBLS) (42Stavola M. Friedman A.J. Stepnoski R.A. Sceats M.G. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1981; 80: 192-194Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 44Navati M.S. Ray A. Shamir J. Friedman J.M. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2004; 108: 1321-1327Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) to expose how hydrogen bonding between the first and second shell waters within the hydration shell of the Gd3+ solvent shell is impacted by the osmolytes used to perturb the partitioning of glycerol in the HPT experiments. Gd3+ VSBLS is based on the appearance within the luminescence spectrum of Gd3+ of weak but relatively sharp vibronic transitions that are induced by the vibrations of the molecular species contained primarily within the first solvation layer (45Yatsiv S.E. Ehrenfreund E. El-Hanany U. J. Chem. Phys. 1965; 42: 743-749Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 46Yehuda Haas G.S. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1971; 11: 143-145Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the case of free aqueous phase Gd3+, the vibronic side bands originate from the waters within the first hydration shell, whereas Gd3+ bound to either chelators (e.g. EDTA) or calcium binding sites in calcium-binding proteins, the vibronic bands manifest the vibrational frequencies of both the coordinated waters and the coordinating ligands such as carboxyl groups. In the present study we focus on the OH stretching frequency of the hydration shell waters. This frequency is inversely correlated with the strength of hydrogen bonding between the first and second shell waters (42Stavola M. Friedman A.J. Stepnoski R.A. Sceats M.G. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1981; 80: 192-194Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 47Stavola M. Isganitsis L. Sceats M.G. J. Chem. Phys. 1981; 74: 4228-4241Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As such it provides a direct measure of how added osmolytes influence the hydrogen bonding capacity of water specifically within the hydration layer as opposed to the bulk water. HbA—OxyHbA, generously provided by Drs. Manjula and Acharya, was prepared according to previous protocols (48Manjula B.N. Kumar R. Sun D.P. Ho N.T. Ho C. Rao J.M. Malavalli A. Acharya A.S. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 49Acharya A.S. Sussman L.G. Manning J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2296-2302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HPT was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) and used without further purification. Stock solutions of the probe were prepared in 0.05 m BisTris OAc, pH 6.5. All other chemicals were reagent grade (Sigma). At the concentrations used in this study, the fluorescence intensity appeared roughly linear with concentration. Over this concentration range, the relative ratio of the polyol/water fluorescence peaks (see below) were independent of the HPT concentration. At higher concentrations of HPT, saturation effects occurred that were attributable to complex formation. Deoxy-HbA was prepared by degassing a 2.0 mm (heme) (in 0.05 m BisTris OAc, pH 6.5) solution of oxy-HbA, previously prepared in the same buffer, with nitrogen and adding sodium dithionite (2× heme) if needed. HPT was then added to the resulting deoxy-HbA solution in a ratio of 1:1 (in tetramer, 0.25 heme concentration). This stock solution was used both for solution measurements and encapsulation in the Sol-Gel as described below. The solution samples were prepared directly in a buffer already containing glycerol (glycerol percentage is by volume), 0.05 m BisTris OAc, pH 6.5, X% glycerol. Integrity of HbA—The integrity of the protein was verified by careful examination of the HbA spectrum in the bands of interest before, during, and after experimental procedures to ensure that the ligation state of the heme did not change during the time course of the experiment. In addition, samples were prepared that were deliberately oxidized or partially ligated to identify what changes would occur in the emission spectrum of HPT in these circumstances. Pseudobands appear in the emission spectrum of HPT in both cases due to absorption in the range of the heme Q band. None of these bands were ever observed for any of the deoxy samples used in this study. HbA samples were also periodically checked for denaturation in the tryptophan fluorescence emission region, particularly in the presence of urea. All spectral changes reported were recorded after assuring that the spectra were no longer changing with time and the samples were at equilibrium. Osmolytes—Osmolytes were either added from a stock solution prepared in 0.05 m BisTris OAc, pH 6.5, or as a solid where appropriate. The pH was carefully controlled to avoid shifting by some osmolytes. Sol-Gel—Sol-Gel-encapsulated HbA samples were prepared using a previously described protocol (31Khan I. Shannon C.F. Dantsker D. Friedman A.J. Perez-Gonzalezde-Apodaca J. Friedman J.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16099-16109Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 32Samuni U. Dantsker D. Khan I. Friedman A.J. Peterson E.

Basically a solution of protein-HPT in buffer (0.05 m BisTris OAc, pH 6.5) was added to TMOS (tetramethylorthosilicate) (Sigma, ultrapure) and buffer (0.05 m BisTris OAc, pH 6.5, + 25% glycerol) in a 1:1:1 ratio. The resulting mixture (final concentration of the protein was 0.5 mm in heme, 0.125 mm in tetramer) was spun in an NMR tube (1-cm diameter) under nitrogen atmosphere until gelation was complete. The bathing buffer of the Sol-Gel was 0.05 m BisTris OAc, pH 6.5, + 25% glycerol + HPT (1:1) tetramer. The bathing buffer was subsequently changed to 0% glycerol, or higher, in 0.05 m BisTris OAc, pH 6.5, + X% glycerol + HPT (1:1) tetramer. Osmolytes were either added from a stock solution prepared in 0.05 m BisTris OAc, pH 6.5, or as a solid where appropriate. Fluorescence Measurements—Spectra were obtained from either of two instruments: a Schimadzu RF-5301PC (Columbia, MD) or a modular PTI Fluorescence system (Photon Technology Inc., Lawrenceville, NJ). Spectra were generated using the following experimental settings: an excitation wavelength of 351 or 355 nm was used, 1-mm slit width for excitation and emission slits, and an integration time of 0.5 or 1 s at ambient temperature. For Sol-Gel samples in 1-cm NMR tubes, or solution phase deoxy-HbA + HPT samples in a 1-mm cell, the instrument was configured for front face emission (52Hirsch R.E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 232: 231-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A range of samples of HbA bound to HPT in 50% glycerol were tested (62-134 μm in protein tetramer) to ensure that the ratio of the two bands in the emission spectrum of HPT did not change with the concentration of the protein and the measurements were within linear range. The solution phase HbA-free HPT samples were monitored using the standard 90° excitation/emission geometry. Gadolinium Cation Vibronic Side Band Luminescence Spectra—The gadolinium cation concentration in all probed solutions was 100 mm. Luminescence spectra were measured on a QuantaMaster model QM-4/2000SE enhanced performance scanning spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International, Lawrenceville, NJ). Samples were held in the quartz cuvette and placed in the sample chamber in the configuration for 90° excitation. The emission profiles were recorded with the excitation of 273 nm, where gadolinium has relatively strong absorption compared with the 311-nm absorption origin. The luminescence was recorded from 290 to 400 nm. The step size was set to be 0.5 nm. The luminescence spectra were plotted as intensity versus wavelength (nm). Each spectrum was repeated at least three times and averaged. The spectra were processed and analyzed using GRAMS/32 AI (6.00) for background subtraction, smoothing, and peak position analysis. HPT Fluorescence as a Function of Added Glycerol: the Influence of Protein and Encapsulation—Fig. 1 shows the fluorescence of HPT as a function of added glycerol (0-75% glycerol by volume) for free HPT in an aqueous buffered solution. In the top panel is shown the progression of changes for the un-normalized data, whereas the bottom panel shows the changes on a plot where the spectra are normalized with respect to the 510 nm peak (set as unity). It can be seen that with added glycerol the polyol-associated 435-nm peak increases as the water-derived 510-nm peak decreases. The inset shows a plot of the relative intensity of the 435-nm polyol peak as a function of added glycerol. It can be seen that the increase is highly nonlinear with a considerable enhancement for glycerol additions beyond the 50% value. The un-normalized plot reveals what appears to be two isosbestic points for two different concentration regimes. Fig. 2 compares the fractional change in the relative intensities of the water and polyol peaks as a function of added glycerol (0, 50, and 75% glycerol by volume) for free-HPT (a), HPT bound to deoxy-HbA in solution (b) and HPT bound to deoxy-HPT encapsulated in a porous Sol-Gel (c). For the thin Sol-Gel samples lining the inner wall of the 1-cm diameter NMR tube, the bathing buffers (with different glycerol content) are present in large volume excess. A solution of Hb-free HPT in aqueous buffer excited at 355 nm yields a single fluorescence emission band at 513 nm representing the proton-dissociated form of the molecule with transfer of the proton to water. It can be seen in Fig. 2 (traces labeled a) that with increasing added glycerol, a band at 435 nm appears and increases relative to the 513-nm band as already demonstrated in Fig. 1. The 435-nm band is also observed when other alcohols or sugars are added to the solution (not shown). Fig. 2 shows that for HbA-bound HPT in both solution (traces b) and Sol-Gel (traces c), the HPT fluorescence emission spectra shows changes with increasing glycerol similar to that seen for free-HPT in solution and in the Sol-Gel (not shown) but with some significant differences. There are two clear differences between the Hb-free and Hb-bound HPT spectra. The first is that the peak positions for both the water-sensitive and the glycol-sensitive bands are responsive to coordination to HbA. With coordination to HbA, the water band shifts from 513 to ∼510 nm and the glycerol band shifts from 435 to ∼460 nm. This shift allows for an assessment of whether the HPT is free or bound to the HbA. Indeed the addition of CO to the solution phase deoxy-HbA·HPT complex, which causes the Thr to Arg quaternary structure switch, results in the appearance of fluorescence peaks indicative of release of HPT from the DPG binding site (not shown). The second major difference is that at high glycerol concentrations, the ratio of the glycerol to water peak is lower for HbA-coordinated HPT both in solution and in Sol-Gel than for the free HPT, with the Sol-Gel sample yielding the lowest ratio. The Effect of Added PEG on the Partitioning of Glycerol into the Hydration Sphere of HPT—Fig. 3 shows the influence of added PEG on the fluorescence spectrum of HPT in the presence of 50% glycerol. Panel A shows the progressive increase in the relative intensity of the polyol peak at 435 nm with added PEG5000 for a solution of HPT containing 50% glycerol by volume. A similar sequence occurs for the addition of PEG400 but higher concentrations of PEG are required to elicit a comparable effect as the PEG5000. This difference in the concentration dependence is seen in the inset in panel A that compares the relative increase of the 435-nm peak as a function of added PEG for two different PEG sizes. Addition of PEG in the absence of glycerol has a minimal effect on the fluorescence spectrum (not shown). Shown in panels B and C are the effects of added PEG5000 and PEG400 on the relative intensity of polyol peak for a solution of HbA-HPT in the presence of 50% glycerol, respectively. At the maximum concentration attainable for the added PEG5000 (10 mm) in the presence of HbA (before precipitation of protein is observed), there is no observable change in the relative intensity of the fluorescence peaks (panel B). In contrast, at the factor of 10 higher attainable concentration of PEG400 (100 mm), an increase in the relative intensity of the polyol peak at 460 nm is observed (panel C). The Effect of Added Mg2+, Urea, and Trehalose on Partitioning of Glycerol into the Hydration Sphere of HPT—Figs. 4, 5 and 6 show the effect of added Mg2+ (panel A) and urea (panel B) on the HPT fluorescence spectrum in the presence of 50% glycerol for free HPT, HPT bound to solution phase HbA, and HPT bound to Sol-Gel encapsulated HbA, respectively. Also shown in each figure is the effect of adding trehalose subsequent to the addition of urea (panel C). The fluorescence spectra are normalized at the 513/510-nm band in all cases. All three samples show similar responses upon addition of the osmolytes. It can be seen (top panels) that there is an increase in the ratio of the water peak at 513/510 nm to the glycerol peak at 435/460 nm upon the addition of 1 m magnesium ion (as magnesium acetate), indicating a decrease in the partitioning of glycerol in the hydration sphere of HPT both unbound and bound to HbA. Similar but reduced changes (not shown) are seen for added sodium and potassium salts. Fig. 4A, inset, shows a plot of the change in the relative fluorescence intensity at 435 nm as a function of Mg2+ concentration. As the concentration of the cation is increased the glycol band is preferentially decreased over that of the water-associated 513-nm band.FIGURE 5Same series as in Fig. 4 for HPT-deoxy HbA (1:1, HPT:tetramer) solution phase.

Trehalose is 0.5 m for the protein complex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Panels B in Figs. 4, 5 and 6 show that the addition of 1 m urea to the three different samples results in changes similar in direction but smaller in amplitude to those occurring with added magnesium ions. This concentration of urea, a known protein denaturant, had virtually no detectable effect, e.g. a red shift on the front face tryptophan emission spectrum of HbA indicating little if any unfolding at this concentration of urea. Fig. 4B, inset, shows the change in the relative fluorescence intensity at 435 nm as a function of increasing urea. The glycol band is preferentially decreased as the urea concentration is increased. The bottom panel (panel C) in all three figures shows how subsequent to the addition of urea, the addition of 0.5 m trehalose, a disaccharide known to stabilize native protein conformations (11Cordone L.

Sci. 2000; 89: 199-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), impacts the urea induced changes. It can be seen that in all three cases, the addition of trehalose reversed the effect of adding urea, resulting in enhancement of the peak associated with the absence of proton dissociation (435/460 nm). The trehalose-induced change in the intensity for the free HPT is included in Fig. 4B, inset. Similar sugar-induced trends are observed for other sugars such as glucose, sucrose, and tagatose. In the absence of glycerol, none of the non-sugar osmolytes when added to HPT at the concentrations used above result in the appearance of a polyol peak in the fluorescence. As discussed below, addition of trehalose does result in a small but insignificant contribution to the polyol peak. Because trehalose like glycerol is a polyol, its presence in the hydration shell of HPT should generate the 435/460-nm emission band. As a consequence the results shown in the bottom panel of the Figs. 4, 5 and 6 could be due exclusively to the additive effect of glycerol plus trehalose. Fig. 7 shows the spectroscopic consequences of the addition of trehalose (1 m) to glycerol-free (A) and glycerol containing (B-D) HPT solutions. For the glycerol-free sample, the addition of trehalose results in the appearance of a small amplitude change (relative to the water peak) 435-nm band. In marked contrast, the addition of trehalose in the presence of 25-50% glycerol results in an enhancement of the 435-nm peak, which in each case is far in excess of an additive effect anticipated based on the behavior shown in Fig. 7A. This result indicates that the spectroscopic changes occurring when adding the trehalose represent a synergistic effect with the glycerol. Similar results were obtained for the HbA-bound HPT samples both in solution and Sol-Gel (data not shown). Fig. 8 compares the change in the relative intensity of the 430-nm peak as a function of added glycerol for HPT-containing solutions with and without added trehalose (1 m). It can be seen that the effect of trehalose is to enhance the glycerol effect at all concentrations of the added glycerol. The trehalose effect becomes progressively larger with increased additions of glycerol. The solubility of the trehalose at the higher concentrations of glycerol limited the extent of the comparison (60% glycerol). Un-normalized spectra recorded upon serial dilutions of a solution of 50% glycerol/HPT in 1 m trehalose while maintaining the same concentration of glycerol and HPT show that the water-sensitive band of HPT increases linearly in response to the reduction of the sugar concentration, whereas the polyol band remains almost unchanged. The response of the water peak is linear with respect to the change in trehalose concentration.FIGURE 8Plot of the changes in fluorescence as a function of added glycerol of an HPT solution in 0.05 m BisTris acetate buffer, pH 6.5, in the presence (▪) and absence (•) of 1 m trehalose.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Gd3+ Vibronic Side Band Spectra (GVSBS)—Fig. 9A shows the 273-nm excited luminescence spectrum from Gd3+ in solution as has previously been reported (42Stavola M.

The pancreas has three distinct cell types, ductal, acinar, and islet, each with different functions. Embryologically, the pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1) homeodomain protein is critical for the initiation of all pancreatic lineages; however, the later differentiation of the endocrine pancreas is uniquely dependent upon high PDX1 expression, whereas PDX1 is down-regulated in the ductal and acinar cell lineages. We find that this down-regulation may be required for normal ductal expression of cytokeratin K19. The K19 promoter-reporter gene assay demonstrates that ectopic PDX1 inhibits K19 reporter gene activity in primary pancreatic ductal cells. This is reinforced by our findings that retrovirally mediated stable transduction of PDX1 in primary pancreatic ductal cells suppresses K19 expression, and short interfering RNA to PDX1 in Min6 insulinoma cells results in the induction of normally undetectable K19. Complementary functional and biochemical approaches led to the unexpected finding that a multimeric complex of PDX1 and two members of the TALE homeodomain factor family, MEIS1a and PBX1b, regulates K19 gene transcription through a specific cis-regulatory element (–341 to –325) upstream of the K19 transcription start site. These data suggest a unifying mechanism whereby PDX1, myeloid ecotropic viral insertion site (MEIS), and pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor 1 (PBX) may regulate ductal and acinar lineage specification during pancreatic development. Specifically, concomitant PDX1 suppression and MEIS isoform expression result in proper ductal and acinar lineage specification. Furthermore, PDX1 may inhibit the ductal differentiation program in the pancreatic endocrine compartment, particularly beta cells.

Furthermore, PDX1 may inhibit the ductal differentiation program in the pancreatic endocrine compartment, particularly beta cells. Cytokeratins are members of the intermediate filament family that are critical to the maintenance of cell and tissue integrity (1Toivola D.M. Tao G.Z. Habtezion A. Liao J. Omary M.B. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 608-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In addition, they influence membrane and subcellular localization of proteins. The cytokeratin family consists of at least 20 members that are categorized as acidic type I, comprising keratins 9–20, or basic type II, comprising keratins 1–8. Typically, cytokeratins form heterodimers between one type I member and one type II member.

Among the pancreatic cell types, K19 is specifically expressed in pancreatic ducts in vivo and in primary pancreatic ductal cells in vitro that our laboratory has successfully isolated and characterized (2Schreiber F.S. Deramaudt T.B. Brunner T.B. Boretti M.I. Gooch K.J. Stoffers D.A. Bernhard E.J. Rustgi A.K. Gastroenterology. 2004; 127: 250-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that K19 expression is modulated by the KLF4 and Sp1 zinc-finger transcription factors, contributing to its tissue specificity in the pancreas (3Brembeck F.H. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28230-28239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This activity is mediated by a short cis-regulatory region containing an overlapping binding site for KLF4 and Sp1 within the K19 promoter. KLF4 has a higher binding affinity and is the predominant binding factor in pancreatic ductal cells with low Sp1 protein levels (3Brembeck F.H. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28230-28239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). PDX1 (pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1) is a Hox type homeodomain transcription factor that is critical for the transcriptional regulation of beta cell development (4Edlund H. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1817-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 9Wright C.V. Schnegelsberg P. De Robertis E.M. Development. 1989; 105: 787-794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PDX1 expression and function are noteworthy in the emergence of pancreatic buds from the endoderm and the maintenance of putative pancreatic progenitor cells during development, and it is, thereafter, highly expressed in the endocrine beta cell lineage. Within the pancreas PDX1 expression is minimally detected in ductal and acinar cells. Mice deficient for Pdx1 exhibit pancreatic agenesis (10Offield M.F. Jetton T.L. Labosky P.A. Ray M. Stein R.W.

Humans with germ line PDX1 mutations develop early (designated maturity onset diabetes of the young, or MODY4) and late-onset forms of type 2 diabetes (13Ahlgren U. Jonsson J. Jonson L. Simu K.

Genet. 1997; 17: 138-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Use of a tet-regulatory system for modulation of PDX1 expression in utero has shown that, in addition to its necessity for early pancreatic development, PDX1 is also required later for the formation of acinar cell compartments. In the absence of PDX1, acini do not form, and in addition the precursor epithelium develops a truncated ductal tree consisting of immature duct-like cells. Thus, the temporal and spatial regulation of PDX1 expression appears to be critical for cell fate determination during development and has implications for cell autonomous and non-autonomous behavior during adult differentiation and regeneration (20Hale M.A. Kagami H.

It is precisely the potential interplay between PDX1 and ductal cell morphogenesis that motivated us to investigate the impact of PDX1 upon ductal epithelial cell-specific gene expression and, in this particular context, K19 gene transcription. We report herein that the transcription factor PDX1 negatively regulates K19 expression in pancreatic cells. K19 expression is reduced in pancreatic ductal cells that stably express PDX1 mediated by retroviral transduction, and conversely, Min6 insulinoma cells that normally express high levels of PDX1 exhibit increased K19 expression after short interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of PDX1. We identified a cis-regulatory region of 16 nucleotides in the K19 promoter that is negatively regulated by PDX1 and is distinct from the region regulated by KLF4 and Sp1. Surprisingly, consensus binding sites for the MEIS (myeloid ecotropic viral insertion site) and PBX (pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor) three-amino acid loop extension (TALE) homeodomain transcription factors were also found in this region. This 16-bp regulatory region is modulated by MEIS1a acting as a positive regulator, whereas PBX1b functions as a repressor of K19 reporter gene activity. Complex formation of PDX1 with MEIS1a and PBX1b leads to PDX1-mediated repression of K19. We conclude that low level PDX1 expression, as observed in ductal cells, permits higher levels of K19 expression as compared with islet cells that express high levels of PDX1 and undetectable levels of K19. This dynamic interplay between PDX1 and K19 has important implications for cell fate decisions during development and regeneration. Cell Lines—The mouse primary pancreatic ductal cell line, WT-PDC, was isolated and characterized as previously described and maintained in a serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (2Schreiber F.S. Deramaudt T.B. Brunner T.B. Boretti M.I. Gooch K.J. Stoffers D.A. Bernhard E.J. Rustgi A.K. Gastroenterology. 2004; 127: 250-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The mouse insulinoma β-cell line, Min6, was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose and supplemented with pyroxidine hydrochloride) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. HeLa and PANC-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell lines were kept as subconfluent monolayers and were maintained in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C. K19 Promoter-Luciferase Reporter and Serial Deletion Constructs—The 5′-flanking region of the mouse K19 gene from –1970 to +46 bp was inserted into pGL3-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI) (3Brembeck F.H. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28230-28239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Similarly, plasmids pK19-654 and pK19-288 were generated by a PCR-based technique (3Brembeck F.H. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28230-28239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). pK19-408, pK19-365, pK19-341, and pK19-325 were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The primers used to construct the deletion mutations of the K19 promoter were as follows 5′-ctatcgataggtaccATTATTCCAGAGGGG-3′ (K19–408), 5′-ctatcgataggtaccGGGCTCAGAGGG-3′ (K19–365), 5′-ctatcgataggtaccAGGGTGTCAAATTCC-3′ (K19–341), and 5′-ctatcgataggtaccGGAGGTTTTAAAGGG-3′ (K19–325). Bases in lowercase correspond to pGL3-Basic, whereas bases in uppercase correspond to the 5′-flanking region of K19. The antisense primers matched the complementary sequences of each sense primer. Deletion or site-directed mutations of the pK19-1970 plasmid between –352 and –325 bp were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Primer sequences used to generate pK19-1970Δ (oligonucleotide K19-352Δ), pK19-1970m (oligonucleotide K19-352m), pK19-1970m2 (oligonucleotide K19-352m2), and pK19-1970m4 (oligonucleotide K19-352m4) are described in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) section below. The sequences of the plasmids were verified by the DNA sequencing facility at the University of Pennsylvania. Expression Vectors—The pCMX-PDX1 vector expressing mouse PDX1 was described previously (25Liu A. Desai B.M. Stoffers D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4372-4383Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). pCS2-MEIS1a, pCS2-MEIS1b, and pCS2-PBX1a were gifts from Dr. Mark Featherstone (26Shanmugam K. Green N.C. Rambaldi I. Saragovi H.U. Featherstone M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7577-7588Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). pCDNA1.1-MEIS2b and pcDNA1.1-PBX1b were gifts from Dr. Galvin Swift (27Liu Y. MacDonald R.J. Swift G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17985-17993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The pGEX-PDX1 vector expressing a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fused to the intact rat PDX1 (residues 1–283) was described elsewhere (7Miller C.P. McGehee Jr., R.E. Habener J.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1145-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The pGEX-4T-1-PDX1 (144–283) and the pGEX-4T-1-PDX1 (206–283) vectors were described previously (25Liu A. Desai B.M. Stoffers D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4372-4383Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and expressed the GST fused to the mouse PDX1 homeodomain/C terminus regions, GST-PDX (144–283), and PDX1 C terminus domain, GST-PDX (206–283), respectively. Transient Transfections and Luciferase Activity Assays—Cells were plated 24 h before transfection in 24-well plates and transiently transfected with 0.15 μg of pGL3-Basic or pGL3-K19 plasmid, 1 ng of pRL-CMV plasmid expressing the renilla luciferase reporter gene with or without 50 ng to 0.3 μgof pCMX-PDX1, 0.3 μg of pCS2-MEIS1a, 0.3 μg of pCS2-PBX1a, 0.3 μg of pcDNA1.1-PBX1b expression plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as directed by the manufacturer. The total amount of DNA in each transfection was adjusted with the corresponding empty expression vector. pGL3-Basic was used as a standard control. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were harvested, assayed for firefly luciferase activity and normalized to renilla luciferase activity using the Dual-luciferase Reporter assay system (Promega). Luciferase activities were detected by the Orion microplate luminometer (Berthold detection system). Antibodies—Rabbit anti-cyclophilin B was obtained from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO). Mouse anti-MEIS1/2/3 antibody was obtained from Upstate (now Millipore, Billerica, MA). Antibodies against mouse anti-PBX1/2/3/4, rabbit anti-PBX1/2/3, and goat anti-PDX1 (clone A-17) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin antibodies were obtained from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse or donkey anti-rabbit IgG were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. In Vitro Transcription-Translation—MEIS1a, MEIS1b, and PBX1a were in vitro transcribed and translated with the SP6 TnT rabbit reticulocyte lysate coupled transcription-translation system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. MEIS2b, PBX1b, and PDX1 were translated using the T7 polymerase from a similar coupled reaction kit. Controls of the translation efficiency were performed using [35S]methionine (Redivue, Amersham Biosciences) in the reaction mixes, and samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE (4–12%). EMSAs—For EMSAs, nuclear extracts were prepared from WT-PDC cells and Min6 cells as described previously (28Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Synthetic oligonucleotides and their respective complementary oligonucleotides for K19-352 probe (–352 to –323, 5′-GGTGTGATTTCTAAGGGTGTCAAATTCCTGG-3′), TSE2-PDX1 (5′-GATCTCAGTAATTAATCATGCA-3′) (29Peers B. Sharma S. Johnson T. Kamps M. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7091-7097Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), mutant K19-352Δ (5′-GAGGGGTGTGATTTCT-Δ-GGAGGTTTTAAAGGGCC-3′), mutant K19-352m (5′GGTGTGATTTCTAAGatcaTCAAATTCCTGGAGG-3′), mutant K19-352m2 (5′-CTAAGGGTGTCAAtcagCTGGAGGTTTTAAAGG-3′), and mutant 352m4 (5′-GTGATTTCTAAGGGTGatcaATTCCTGGAGG-3′) were diluted to a final concentration of 5 μm (lowercase letters represent mutated nucleotides, and bold letters represent region of interest in the K19 promoter). The sense oligonucleotides were end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) in the presence of 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and then purified using Microspin G-25 columns (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. The complementary antisense oligonucleotides were then added to the radiolabeled oligonucleotides and annealed by heating at 100 °C for 5 min followed by slow cooling to room temperature. EMSA experiments were carried out by mixing the following components to the reaction mixture: 5 μg of nuclear extract, ∼0.5 pmol of radiolabeled probe, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 150 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC). The various components were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Nuclear extracts from PDC and Min6 were preincubated in the presence or absence of 100-fold excess of competitor DNAs at room temperature for 20 min before the addition to the reaction mixture. For supershift analysis, nuclear extracts were preincubated with 3μl of goat polyclonal antibody to PDX1, mouse anti-PBX, mouse anti-MEIS, or purified immunoglobulin G at room temperature for 20 min before the addition of the labeled probes. Free and bound DNA were separated on a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel, which was run at a constant voltage of 120 V in Tris-glycine buffer. After drying the gel, the results were visualized by phosphorimaging or exposed to BioMax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Western Blot Analysis—For immunoblot analysis, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete mini, Roche Applied Science)). Protein concentration was determined with the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). A total of 10 μgof total protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE (4–12%) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). To check for equal protein transfer, the membranes were stained briefly with Ponceau S solution (Sigma). Blocking was performed in 5% milk, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h before incubation with primary antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immunoreactivity was visualized using the ECL+ system (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to BioMax MR film. DNA Affinity Precipitation Assay—5′-Biotinylated oligonucleotides and their respective complementary oligonucleotides were synthesized, gel-purified by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA), and annealed in Tris-EDTA buffer with 150 mm NaCl by heating at 100 °C for 5 min followed by a slow cooling to room temperature. The positive control oligonucleotide (CMV2) was 5′-biotin-TAATCAATTACGGGGTCATTA-3′. The negative control oligonucleotide (scramble) was 5′-biotin-GCCGCCGCCGCCGCCGCCGC-3′. K19 oligonucleotides were 5′-biotin K19-352 (as described above). The biotinylated probes (2μg) were incubated on ice with 20 μg of Min6 or 60 μg of WT-PDC nuclear extract in 400 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25% Triton X-100). Increasing amounts of excess competitor (0–50-fold excess) were included in the binding reaction for competition assays. The negative control was done by omitting the biotinylated probes. After 30 min of incubation, 20 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads prewashed 3 times with the binding buffer were added to each reaction mixture, and the reaction was conducted for an additional hour on ice with gentle shaking. The streptavidin-agarose beads were washed 4 times with 1 ml of binding buffer before adding 30 μl of protein sample buffer (with 1% 2-β mercaptoethanol). All the samples were denatured by heating at 85 °C for 5 min and resolved by SDS-PAGE (4–12%). Quantitative Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP assays were performed as described previously (30Chakrabarti S.K. Francis J. Ziesmann S.M. Garmey J.C. Mirmira R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23617-23623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 31Letting D.L. Rakowski C. Weiss M.J. Blobel G.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1334-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Briefly, for each antiserum, one confluent 10-cm plate of pancreatic ductal cells (∼1 × 107 cells) was cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature and quenched with glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. Chromatin was sonicated to create ∼500-bp fragments in size and precleared with normal goat or mouse IgG (Santa Cruz) overnight at 4 °C. After removal of an aliquot for analysis as input, precleared chromatin was divided equally for immunoprecipitation with either goat polyclonal anti-PDX1 antibody, mouse monoclonal anti-MEIS, or normal IgG for 3 h at 4°C. Data were analyzed quantitatively in duplicate by real-time PCR. GST Pulldown Assays—The GST pull-down assays were carried out using the ProFound™ pulldown GST protein-protein interaction kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, GST fusion proteins or GST alone were produced in Escherichia coli BL21-Gold(DE3)pLysS cells induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. The purified GST proteins were then incubated with immobilized glutathione for 1 h at 4°C. After 3 washes (ProFound lysis buffer: Tris-buffered saline, 1:1), the immobilized baits were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μl of in vitro translated 35S-labeled PDX1, MEIS1a, or PBX1b diluted in washing buffer. The beads were then washed 4 times, the captured proteins were eluted in 100 μl of sample buffer and heated at 85 °C for 5 min, and 20 μl of proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (4–12%). The gels were dried under vacuum at 80 °C and autoradiographed. Viral Infection and RNA Isolation—Min6 cells were infected with recombinant adenovirus containing a siRNA sequence designed to target either PDX1 or luciferase as described (32Iype T. Francis J. Garmey J.C. Schisler J.C. Nesher R. Weir G.C. Becker T.C. Newgard C.B. Griffen S.C. Mirmira R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16798-16807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 105 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 2500 plaque-forming units/cell for 6.5 h. Cells were harvested 72 h post-infection and processed for RNA isolation using Trizol (Invitrogen). RNA samples were treated with DNase I (Ambion), analyzed for integrity with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, and reverse-transcribed with Superscript II (Invitrogen) using oligo(dT) for priming. Full-length mouse PDX1 cDNA was obtained by digesting pCMX-PDX1 expression vector with the restriction enzymes SalI and BamHI. The extremities of the insert were then filled blunt with T4 DNA polymerase, and the PDX1 cDNA was inserted into the SnaBI-digested pBABE/puro retroviral vector (33Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar). Retrovirus preparation and WT-PDC infection and selection were conducted as previously described (34Deramaudt T.B. Takaoka M. Upadhyay R. Bowser M.J. Porter J. Lee A. Rhoades B. Johnstone C.N. Weissleder R. Hingorani S.R. Mahmood U. Rustgi A.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4185-4200Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Reverse Transcription-PCR and Real-time PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from monolayer cultures using Trizol reagent, and cDNA was synthesized by oligo(dT) priming from 1 μg of total RNA using a Superscript first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. The semiquantitative analysis of transcripts encoding various isoforms of MEIS and PBX was carried out with a mixture of cDNA derived from WT-PDC or Min6, 0.2 μm each of the sense and antisense primers, 0.2 μm dNTP, and 2.5 units of Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) in a final reaction volume of 50 μl. The specific primers to detect MEIS1, -2, and -3 and PBX1a, -1b, -2, and -3 were described elsewhere (35Qin P. Cimildoro R. Kochhar D.M. Soprano K.J. Soprano D.R. Teratology. 2002; 66: 224-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The PCR program was 90 °C for 2 min and 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 1 min with a final extension at 68 °C for 7 min. Data shown were obtained with 30 PCR cycles. Analysis of digested and undigested PCR products was done by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. For quantification of duplicate or triplicate samples, real-time PCR was performed with SYBR green using a Bio-Rad iCycler (Apply Biosystems) by cycling 40 times using the conditions 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 45 s (PDX1 andβ-actin primers), or 55 °C for 45 s (K19 primers). PCR product signals were referenced to a dilution series of the relevant input to account for different efficiencies of primer sets: K19 promoter, sense, 5′-TGTCAAATTCCTGGAGGTTTTAAAG-3′, and antisense, 5′-GCCCCTTACTACACAGGCTTAGAC-3′; albumin promoter, sense, 5′-TGGGAAAACTGGGAAAACCATC-3′, and antisense, 5′-CACTCTCACACATACACTCCTGCTG-3′ (30Chakrabarti S.K. Francis J. Ziesmann S.M. Garmey J.C. Mirmira R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23617-23623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The following forward and reverse primers were used to amplify PDX1 mRNA (forward, 5′-GAACCCGAGGAAAACAAGAGG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GTTCAACATCACTGCCAGCTC-3′), K19 mRNA (forward, 5′-TCCCAGCTCAGCATGAAAGCT-3′, and reverse, 5′-AAAACCGCTGATCACGCTCTG-3′), Pbx1 mRNA (forward, 5′-AACCTCCTTCGAGAGCAAAGC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GCATCTGGATGGAGCTGAACT-3′), Meis2 mRNA (forward, 5′-CCCGTCCATGTGTCCTTTAGT-3′, and reverse, 5′-TGAAGAAGCCTTCGCTCTGTC-3′), hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (forward, 5′-GGCCAGACTTTGTTGGATTTG-3′, and reverse, 5′-TGCGCTCATCTTAGGCTTTGT-3′), or β-actin (forward, 5′-GAAGTGTGACGTTGACATCCG-3′, and reverse 5′-GTCAGCAATGCCTGGGTACAT-3′). Densitometry Measurements and Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Densitometry measurements were performed using Scion Image Beta 4.02 software (Frederick, MD) and calibrated with the β-actin signal. Analysis of variance with a Tukey post hoc test was used for statistical analysis. A p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Expression of PDX1 in Primary Pancreatic Ductal Cells—To determine the level of expression of PDX1 in our primary pancreatic cell lines, designated as wild-type pancreatic ductal cells (WT-PDC), we performed Western blots on whole cell lysates. The results show that PDX1 is expressed at low levels in the pancreatic ductal cells, and its expression is significantly higher in the insulinoma cell line Min6 (PDX1 is 22 ± 3.5-fold higher in Min6 cells compared with WT-PDC, p < 0.01). PDX1 expression was undetectable in PANC-1 and HeLa cells (Fig. 1). PDX1 Negatively Regulates K19 Expression—The K19-1970 plasmid containing a luciferase reporter gene under the control of the 5′ regulatory region of the mouse K19 gene was constructed as previously described (3Brembeck F.H. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28230-28239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). A set of 5′ deletion constructs were generated using a PCR-based technique, and the reporter plasmids were transiently transfected into WT-PDC (Fig. 2A). PDX1 had no effect on the basal luciferase activity of the empty pGL3-Basic vector (Fig. 2B). Data from the luciferase reporter assays revealed that co-expression of PDX1 in WT-PDC negatively regulated the K19 promoter. PDX1 partially suppressed K19 expression by about 50% when using the K19 promoter constructs from –1970/+46 to –341/+46. However, PDX1 had no effect on K19 expression when the K19 promoter was reduced to –325/+46 and –288/+46. This result suggests that the negative regulation of K19 by PDX1 is alleviated when the region between –341 and –325 of the K19 promoter is deleted. Interestingly, this region does not contain an obvious AT-rich consensus DNA binding site for PDX1. PDX1 Occupies the K19 Promoter in Vivo—To provide in vivo evidence for PDX1 binding to the K19 promoter, we carried out ChIP in WT-PDC and analyzed the results using quantitative real-time PCR. The compiled data from 5 independent ChIP experiments demonstrate that PDX1 specifically occupies the K19 promoter in WT-PDC, resulting in an ∼2.5-fold higher enrichment than observed with the control IgG immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3A). In these assays the lack of PDX1 occupancy at the albumin promoter serves as a negative control. These data suggest that PDX1 associates with the K19 promoter despite the absence of a TAA(T/T)TAT consensus sequence, perhaps via interaction with another/other DNA binding factor(s). To further confirm the interaction of PDX1 with the K19 promoter, the DNA affinity pr"
https://openalex.org/W2133746729,"Synovial sarcoma, a soft tissue sarcoma that develops in adults, is pathologically subclassified into monophasic spindle synovial sarcoma and biphasic synovial sarcoma with epithelial components. The molecular mechanism building the epithelial components in biphasic synovial sarcoma is totally unknown. Here we investigated claudins, critical molecules in the tight junction, in biphasic synovial sarcoma. Expression profiles of 21 claudins in 17 synovial sarcoma tumor samples, including 9 biphasic tumors, identified claudin4, claudin7, and claudin10 as biphasic tumor-related claudins, and immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated the localization of these claudins in the epithelial component in biphasic tumors, with claudin7 the most closely associated with the epithelial component. The mRNA expression and protein localization of claudin7 coincided with those of the ELF3, an epithelia-specific member of the Ets family of transcription factors. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that the presence of the Ets-binding site at -150 in the promoter region of the claudin7 gene was critical for the transcriptional activity, and gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed the binding of ELF3 to the Ets site at -150. Inhibition of ELF3 expression by small interfering RNA simultaneously down-regulated the mRNA expression of the claudin7 gene, and the introduction of ELF3 expression in claudin7-negative cell lines induced mRNA expression of the claudin7 gene. Therefore, the induction of claudin7 expression by ELF3 appears critical to the formation of the epithelial structures in biphasic synovial sarcoma.

In some rare types of malignant tumors, carcinomatous and sarcomatous elements are found simultaneously at an early stage. These tumors are classified as carcinosarcomas (1Wick M.R. Swanson P.E. Semin. Diagn. Pathol. 1993; 10: 118-127PubMed Google Scholar). A prototype among soft tissue sarcomas is synovial sarcoma (SS) 2The abbreviations used are: SS, synovial sarcoma; siRNA, small interfering RNA; TJ, tight junction; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; RT, reverse transcription; CLDN, claudin; OND, oligonucleotide; OSP, oligodendrocyte-specific protein. 2The abbreviations used are: SS, synovial sarcoma; siRNA, small interfering RNA; TJ, tight junction; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; RT, reverse transcription; CLDN, claudin; OND, oligonucleotide; OSP, oligodendrocyte-specific protein. (2Leader M. Patel J. Collins M. Kristin H. Cancer. 1987; 59: 2096-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 3Enzinger F.M. Weiss S.W. Enzinger F.M. Weiss S.W. Soft Tissue Tumors. Mosby, St. Louis1995: 757-778Google Scholar). SS is a malignant spindle cell sarcoma predominantly affecting the lower extremities of adolescents and young adults and accounts for 5-10% of soft tissue sarcomas (3Enzinger F.M. Weiss S.W. Enzinger F.M. Weiss S.W. Soft Tissue Tumors. Mosby, St. Louis1995: 757-778Google Scholar). Although the nomenclature for this tumor has stemmed from the morphological similarity to synovial tissues (4Lejars F. Rubens-Duval H. Rev. Chir. 1910; 41: 751-758Google Scholar), ultrastructural and immunohistochemical analyses have clearly excluded a synovial origin for this type of tumor (5Mickelson M.R. Brown G.A. Maynard J.A. Cooper R.R. Bonfiglio M. Cancer. 1980; 45: 2109-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 6Miettinen M. Viranen I. Am. J. Pathol. 1984; 117: 18-25PubMed Google Scholar), and currently SS is classified as a miscellaneous tumor of unknown histological origin (3Enzinger F.M. Weiss S.W. Enzinger F.M. Weiss S.W. Soft Tissue Tumors. Mosby, St. Louis1995: 757-778Google Scholar). Gene expression profiling of soft tissue sarcomas revealed that SS was clustered with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (7Nagayama S. Katagiri T. Tsunoda T. Hosaka T. Nakashima Y. Araki N. Kusuzaki K. Nakayama T. Tsuboyama T. Nakamura T. Imamura M. Nakamura Y. Toguchida J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5859-5866PubMed Google Scholar), the cellular origin of which is Schwann cells, one of the descendants of neural crest cells (8Le Douarin N.M. Dupin E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Indeed, most of the genes whose expression is up-regulated in SS are related to the neural crest (7Nagayama S. Katagiri T. Tsunoda T. Hosaka T. Nakashima Y. Araki N. Kusuzaki K. Nakayama T. Tsuboyama T. Nakamura T. Imamura M. Nakamura Y. Toguchida J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5859-5866PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the precursor cells of SS might be neural crest-derived cells. Based on the presence or absence of an epithelial component, SS is classified into two major subtypes as follows: biphasic SS composed of distinct epithelial and spindle tumor cells, and monophasic spindle SS solely composed of spindle tumor cells (3Enzinger F.M. Weiss S.W. Enzinger F.M. Weiss S.W. Soft Tissue Tumors. Mosby, St. Louis1995: 757-778Google Scholar). Epithelial cells of biphasic SS are cuboidal to tall and columnar, and are disposed in solid cords, nests, or grandular structures that contain granular or homogeneous eosinophilic secretions (3Enzinger F.M. Weiss S.W. Enzinger F.M. Weiss S.W. Soft Tissue Tumors. Mosby, St. Louis1995: 757-778Google Scholar). Epithelial cells are sometimes flattened bearing a resemblance to normal synovium, which may be the reason for the misnomer (4Lejars F. Rubens-Duval H. Rev. Chir. 1910; 41: 751-758Google Scholar). Although its biological significance is unknown, this unique feature has been used to distinguish SS from other soft tissue sarcomas, and the expression of epithelial structure-related molecules such as cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, and E-cadherin has been analyzed (9Jorgensen L.J. Lyon H. Myhre-Jensen O. Nordentoft A. Sneppen O. APMIS. 1994; 102: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 10Sato H. Hasegawa T. Kanai Y. Tsutsumi Y. Osamura Y. Abe Y. Sakai H. Hirohashi S. Virchows Arch. 2001; 438: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Despite the pathological heterogeneity, almost all SSs share a oncogenic fusion gene, the SYT-SSX gene, which is created by the reciprocal chromosomal translocation t(X;18)(p11.2; q11.2), resulting in the fusion of the SYT gene on chromosome 18 (18q11) with either the SSX1, SSX2, or SSX4 gene on chromosome X (Xp11) (11Clark J. Rocques P.J. Crew A.J. Gill S. Shipley J. Chan A.M.L. Gusterson B.A. Cooper C.S. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 502-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 12Skytting B. Nilsson G. Brodin B. Xie Y. Lundeberg J. Uhlen M. Larsson O. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 974-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Because of the high sensitivity and specificity, the SYT-SSX fusion gene was used as a reliable diagnostic marker for SS (13Randall R.L. Schabel K.L. Hitchcock Y. Joyner D.E. Albritton K.H. Curr. Treat. Options Oncol. 2005; 6: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), although the precise function of SYT-SSX is still to be investigated. Data from clinical samples suggested a link between the function of the SYT-SSX protein and epithelial components; the SYT-SSX1 transcript was found in both monophasic and biphasic tumors, whereas almost all SS tumors with SYT-SSX2 were monophasic (14Kawai A. Woodruff J. Healey J.H. Brennan M. Antonescu C.R. Ladanyi M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of this association, however, is not known. The formation of epithelial structures requires tight cell-to-cell adhesion, which is produced by three components, the tight junction (TJ), adherens junction, and desmosome (15Farquhar M.G. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 375-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (2078) Google Scholar). Adherens junctions mechanically link adjacent cells, in which cadherins and nectins play crucial roles (16Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2966) Google Scholar, 17Takai Y. Nakanishi H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The TJ is formed at the most apical side, where a set of continuous, anastomosing intramembranous particle strands exists (TJ strands) (18Schneeberger E.E. Lynch R.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: 647-661PubMed Google Scholar). Each TJ strand within a plasma membrane associates laterally with another TJ strand in the opposing membrane of an adjacent cell to form a paired TJ strand, making a tight seal separating luminal and basal sides of epithelial tissues (18Schneeberger E.E. Lynch R.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: 647-661PubMed Google Scholar). Three integral membrane proteins have been found as components of TJs as follows: occludin (19Furuse M. Hirase T. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (2073) Google Scholar), claudin (CLDN) (20Furuse M. Fujita K. Hiiragi T. Fujimato K. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1539-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1656) Google Scholar), and junctional adhesion molecule (21Martin P.I. Lostaglio S. Schneeman M. Williams L. Romano M. Fruscella P. Penzeri C. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. Villa A. Simmons D. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar), of which CLDN plays a central role. CLDN has four transmembrane domains and short amino- and carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domains (22Tsukita S. Furuse M. Itoh M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1979) Google Scholar, 23Tsukita S. Furuse M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). So far, 24 CLDNs have been found in mammals, 21 of which are confirmed to exist in humans (24Loh Y.H. Christoffels A. Brenner S. Hunziker W. Venkatesh B. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1248-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). CLDN constitutes the back-bone of TJ strands, making tight “ziplocks” by binding to CLDNs on adjacent cells in a homoor heterotypic manner (22Tsukita S. Furuse M. Itoh M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1979) Google Scholar, 23Tsukita S. Furuse M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The tightness of a TJ depends on the number and quality of strands, which is determined by the pair of CLDNs (22Tsukita S. Furuse M. Itoh M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1979) Google Scholar, 23Tsukita S. Furuse M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), and therefore each epithelial tissue contains specific pairs of CLDNs (22Tsukita S. Furuse M. Itoh M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1979) Google Scholar, 23Tsukita S. Furuse M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Here we performed a survey of CLDNs related to the formation of epithelial structures in SS and isolated CLDN4, -7, and -10 as biphasic SS-related CLDNs, among which CLDN7 seemed to be indispensable. In addition, we found that the expression of CLDN7 was associated with the expression of a transcription factor, ELF3. Therefore, the induction of CLDN7 expression by ELF3 is an indispensable step in the formation of epithelial components in SS. Tissue Samples and Cell Lines—Primary tumor tissues from 17 SS were obtained at either biopsy or resection. Informed consent was obtained from each patient, and tumor samples were approved for analysis by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University. SS tumors were subclassified into either monophasic spindle or biphasic tumors based on the presence of epithelial structures by one pathologist (Y. Nakashima). Tumor specimens were frozen quickly and kept at -80 °C until nucleic acid was extracted. Six human SS cell lines were used in this study. YaFuSS was established in our laboratory from monophasic SS (25Ishibe T. Nakayama T. Okamoto T. Aoyama T. Nishijo K. Roberts Shibata K.R. Shima Y. Nagayama S. Katagiri T. Nakamura Y. Nakamura T. Toguchida J. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 2702-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and HS-SY-II was provided from H. Sonobe (Kochi University, Japan) (26Sonobe H. Manabe Y. Furihata M.

Hashimoto (Osaka University, Japan). Among the control cell lines, NMS-2 (a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor) was provided by A. Ogose (Niigata University, Japan) (29Imaizumi S. Motoyama T. Ogose A. Hotta T. Takahashi H.E. Virchows Arch. 1998; 433: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and Saos2 (osteosarcoma), HT1080 (fibrosarcoma), COLO205 (colon cancer), SW480 (colon cancer), HCT15 (colon cancer), and NT2/D1 (embryonal carcinoma) cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were maintained either in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—RNA was isolated using Sepazol reagent (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) from frozen tumor tissues and cell lines. After the treatment with DNase I (Nippon Gene, Osaka, Japan), 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed for single-stranded cDNA using an oligo(dT) primer and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR was done using 1 μl of the RT product in a final volume of 25 μl containing 20 pmol each of the sense and antisense primers, 2.5 mmol/liter of MgCl2, 0.2 mmol/liter of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, and 1 unit of rTaq polymerase (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). All PCRs were done using GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Information on the primers is available upon request. Immunohistochemistry—Slides of paraffin-embedded SS surgical specimens were processed for antigen retrieval with the boiling method (boiling for 10 min followed by cooling at room temperature for 20 min) and incubated with antibodies against CLDN4 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) at a concentration of 1:200, CLDN7 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) at 1:500, CLDN10 (Abcam) at 1:100, or ELF3 (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) at 1:750. Subsequently, mouse EnVision™ polymer reagent (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) for CLDN7 or rabbit EnVision™ polymer reagent (Dako) for CLDN4, CLDN10, and ELF3 was added and visualized with peroxidase substrate (3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride). Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated in ethanol, cleared in xylene, and mounted in Entellan® (Merck). Western Blotting—Whole cell lysates were prepared from each cell line, separated by SDS-PAGE using a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). After blocking with 5% skim milk, the membrane was probed with anti-CLDN7 antibody at 1:500 or with anti-ESE1 antibody at 1:500 overnight at 4 °C and then probed with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (for CLDN7) or anti-rabbit (for ELF3) immunoglobulin at 1:2000, respectively, for 1 h. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with Enhanced Chemiluminescence Plus (Amersham Biosciences). Luciferase Assay—Information on the 5′ putative regulatory region of the CLDN7 gene was obtained from the GenBank™ data base (accession number NT010718), and a search for putative binding sites of transcription factors was made with TFSEARCH. DNA fragments of different size were amplified by PCR using sense primers with an XhoI site, antisense primers with a HindIII site, and KOD plus DNA polymerase (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan), digested by XhoI and HindIII (CLDN7), and cloned into a luciferase reporter plasmid vector, PGV-B (Toyo Ink, Tokyo, Japan). CLDN7(-1136 mutated) having a mutation at the ETS site (-150) (TTCCG→ TTAAG) was generated by a site-directed mutagenesis. Briefly, using CLDN7(-1136)-PGV-B as template DNA, PCR was performed with a sense and antisense primer containing the mutation (-150 site, TTCCG→TTAAG) using KOD plus DNA polymerase (TOYOBO). Amplified DNA was digested by DpnI (TOYOBO) and transformed to competent high DH5α (TOYOBO) by incubation for 30 min on ice, propagated in LB medium, and purified with a plasmid midi kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). SW480 cells (6 × 105) or HT1080 cells (1 × 105) were seeded in a 35-mm dish, and 1 μg of each reporter plasmid was transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In co-transfection experiments, each reporter plasmid was transfected with or without 2 μg of pFLAG-CMV2-ESE1 containing a full-length ELF3, kindly provided by Dr. S. Yoshida, Kyoto University (30Yoshida N. Yoshida S. Araie M. Handa H. Nabeshima Y. Mech. Dev. 2000; 97: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency was standardized by the co-transfection of 1 ng of pRL-TK control vector (Toyo Ink, Tokyo, Japan). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and luciferase assays were performed with the dual luciferase assay reporter system (Promega, Madison, WI). Firefly luciferase activity and SeaPansy luciferase activity were measured as relative light units with a luminometer (STRATEC Biomedical Systems, Birkenfeld, Germany). The firefly luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency based on the SeaPansy luciferase activity. Each experiment was performed in duplicate. Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts of SW480 were prepared with the NE-PER nuclear extraction reagent (Pierce). Double-stranded oligonucleotides (OND) corresponding to the wild-type sequence from -159 to -138 (ETS-WT) were synthesized by annealing two single ONDs (5′-GGCCACGACTTCCGGTTCAGGT-3′ and 5′-ACCTGAACCGGAAGTCGTGGCC-3′). A mutant fragment with a mutated Ets site at -150 (ETS-MUT) was created by annealing two single ONDs (5′-GGCCACGACTTAAGGTTCAGGT-3′ and 5′-ACCTGAACCTTAAGTCGTGGCC-3′). Each single OND was biotinylated by the biotin 3′ end labeling kit (Pierce) and annealed with the corresponding OND by mixing together and incubating for 1 h at room temperature. Then the nuclear extract (5 μg) of SW480 was incubated with OND for 20 min at room temperature. The mixtures were electrophoresed in 5% polyacrylamide with 2.5% glycerol in 0.5% Tris borate EDTA at 85 V for 1.5 h and transferred to a nylon membrane. The biotinlabeled OND was detected with a LightShift chemiluminescent electrophoretic mobility shift assay kit (Pierce). For the competition assay, the OND-protein complex was produced in the same way in the presence of given amounts of unlabeled OND. In the supershift assay, nuclear extracts were incubated with 3 μg of anti-ELF3 antibody and labeled OND overnight at 4 °C. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—Cells were harvested and mixed with formaldehyde at a final concentration of 1.0% for 15 min at 37 °C to cross-link protein to DNA. Cells were suspended in 0.2 ml of SDS lysis buffer and settled on ice for 10 min. DNA cross-linked with protein was sonicated into fragments of 200-1000 bp. One-tenth of the sample was set aside as an input control, and the rest was pre-cleared with salmon sperm DNA protein A-Sepharose beads (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) for 30 min with agitation. The soluble DNA fraction was mixed with anti-ELF3 antibody at 4 °C overnight with rotation. Immune complexes were then collected with salmon sperm DNA protein A-Sepharose beads, and washed with the manufacturer's low salt, high salt, LiCl buffers and then twice with TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA). The chromatin-antibody complexes were eluted with elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3). Protein DNA cross-links were reversed with 5 m NaCl at 65 °C for 4 h. After proteinase K treatment and phenol/chloroform extraction, DNA was precipitated in ethanol and used as template for PCR amplification using primers specific for the CLDN7 promoter (sense, 5′-GTCAAAACCGGGCAAGCGAA-3′, -237 to -218; antisense, 5′-CGCACCTGAGTATATGTAGGG-3′, -40 to -20). The reaction was performed with an initial denaturation of 5 min at 94 °C followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 56 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C with a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. RNA Interference and Quantitative RT-PCR—Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for the ELF3 gene were designed and produced by HP Guaranteed siRNA system (Qiagen). Transient transfections of SW480 cells (1 × 105) with siRNAs (100 pmol) were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The knockdown effect of siRNA on the expression of ELF3 and CLDN7 was assessed with the 7300 real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). PCR was done using 2 μl of RT product diluted 10-fold in a final volume of 25 μl containing 12.5 μl of 2× Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Primers were the same as those used in the standard RT-PCR, and the β-actin gene was used as the internal control. All of the reactions were run in triplicate. The ratio of ELF3 or CLDN7/β-actin in each sample was calculated, and the expression level was demonstrated as a relative value using the ELF3 or CLDN7/β-actin ratio in samples without treatment as a standard (1.0). Expression of CLDN Genes in SS Tumors—The mRNA expression of 21 CLDN genes in SS tumor tissue samples was analyzed by conventional RT-PCR (Fig. 1A). The expression profiles of CLDN genes in SS differed considerably among tumors. Some tumors such as SS188 and SS259 expressed only one of the 21 genes, whereas the clear expression of nine CLDN was observed in SS053. In biphasic tumors, CLDN4 (8:9 samples), CLDN7 (9:9), CLDN10 (7:9), and CLDN12 (9:9) were found with high frequency, among which the expression of CLDN12 was detected also in monophasic tumors (8:8). Therefore, we considered the remaining three CLDNs, CLDN4, -7, and -10, to be biphasic phenotype-related CLDNs, among which CLDN7 was most specific in biphasic SS. All nine biphasic tumors were positive, but only a faint signal was detected in one of eight monophasic tumors. These results indicated the strong association of CLDN7 with the epithelial structures in SS. Expression of CLDN Genes in Mesenchymal and Epithelial Tumor Cell Lines—The expression of the 21 CLDN genes was analyzed in cell lines of various histological origin, including six SS cell lines (Fig. 1B). Carcinoma cell lines (COLO205, SW480, SKGIIIa, and HeLa) expressed multiple CLDN genes, including the CLDN4 and CLDN7 genes. Fibrosarcoma (HT1080) and osteosarcoma (Saos2) cell lines expressed only the CLDN12 gene. A cell line derived from malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (NMS-2) expressed many CLDN genes as well as a cell line of embryonal carcinoma (NT2/D1). Among SS cell lines, only 1273/99 expressed multiple CLDN genes, including the CLDN7 and -10 genes, whereas other SS cell lines expressed only the CLDN11 and -12 genes. It is interesting that the expression of the CLDN11 gene was detected only in two of 17 SS tumor tissues, whereas all six cell lines expressed the CLDN11 gene in vitro. Localization of CLDN4, -7, and -10 in SS Tumor Tissues—To analyze the localization of CLDN4, -7, and -10 proteins, immunohistochemical staining using the antibody for each CLDN was performed in typical biphasic and monophasic SS tumors (Fig. 2). Biphasic SS Tumors—SS334 showed a single columnar epithelial structure surrounded by spindle cells (Fig. 2, a-c). The expression of CLDN4 was found mainly in epithelial cells but also in some spindle cells (Fig. 2a). In contrast, the expression of CLDN7 was intense in epithelial cells but barely detectable in spindle cells (Fig. 2b). The signal of CLDN10 was also strongly detected in epithelial cells, although some spindle cells also expressed CLDN10 (Fig. 2c). KS822 showed a single flattened epithelial structure (Fig. 2, d-f). As in the case of KS334, CLDN4 was faintly detected in some epithelial cells (Fig. 2d), and the signal of CLDN7 (Fig. 2e) and -10 (Fig. 2f) was strongly and consistently detected in epithelial cells. Monophasic SS Tumors—No signal from CLDN4, -7, or -10 was detected in KS438 (monophasic SS with SYT-SSX1) (Fig. 2, g-i) and KS646 (monophasic SS with SYT-SSX2) (Fig. 2, j-l). These results indicated that CLDN4, -7, and -10 were localized to epithelial cells in biphasic SS tumors, with the expression of CLDN7 highly specific to these cells. Association of CLND7 with ELF3—ELF3 (E74-like factor 3) is a member of the Ets family of transcription factors, whose expression is restricted to epithelial cells, and known to be involved in the regulation of epithelium-specific gene products such as keratins (30Yoshida N. Yoshida S. Araie M. Handa H. Nabeshima Y. Mech. Dev. 2000; 97: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 31Tymms M.J. Ng A.Y.N. Thomas R.S. Schutte B.C. Zhou J. Eyre H.J. Sutherland G.R. Seth A. Rosenberg M. Papas T. Debouck C. Kola I. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2449-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Gene expression profiles of SS identified the ELF3 gene as one of the biphasic SS-specific genes (32Allander S.V. Illei P.B. Chen Y. Antonescu C.R. Bittner M. Ladanyi M. Meltzer P.S. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 1587-1595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of ELF3 in the regulation of epithelial structure-related genes such as CLDN genes. First, the mRNA expression of the ELF3 gene along with other members of the ELF family (ELF1, -2, -4, and -5 genes) in SS tumor tissues and cell lines was investigated (Fig. 3). Consistent with previous reports, the mRNA expression of the ELF3 gene was observed in all biphasic tumors (Fig. 3A) and associated with the expression of the CLDN7 gene. Interestingly, this association was also observed in a monophasic tumor expressing the CLDN7 gene (SS720). The expression of the ELF1 genes was detected in most tumors, and some SS tumors expressed the ELF2, ELF4, or ELF5 genes, but there was no clear relationship between the expression of any of these ELF3 genes and histological classification or the expression of the CLDN7 gene. Identical association was also observed in the analyses of cell lines (Fig. 3B). In contrast with the data in tumor tissues, the expression of the ELF4 gene was observed constantly in all cell lines. As in the case of tumor tissues, a complete association was observed between the expression of the ELF3 gene and that of the CLND7 gene but not the CLDN4 or CDN10 gene. To further investigate the association of ELF3 with CLDN7, the localization of ELF3 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. In biphasic SS (SS334 and SS822), the staining of ELF3 protein was observed in the nucleus of epithelial cells as well as some apparently nonepithelial cells, although purely spindle cells were negative for the staining (Fig. 3C, a and c). Compared with the staining of CLDN7 (Fig. 3C, b and d), there seemed to be three types of cells as follows: epithelial cells expressing both ELF3 and CLDN7 (indicated by a closed arrowhead), spindle cells negative for both proteins (indicated by an open arrowhead), and cells with an intermediate morphology expressing ELF3 but not CLDN7 (indicated by an arrow). These results suggested that ELF3 was necessary, but itself not enough, for the expression of the CLDN7 gene. No signal from ELF3 was detected in CLDN7-negative monophasic tumors (data not shown). Identification of the Transcriptional Regulatory Element of the CLDN7 Gene—To investigate the possible role of ELF3 in the transcriptional regulation of the CLDN7 gene, the transcriptional regulatory element of the CLDN7 gene was investigated using the luciferase reporter assay. Computer analyses in the 5′ putative regulatory region of the CLND7 locus revealed that the region from -1136 to +428 (ATG site) was CpG-rich and contained several p"
https://openalex.org/W2040746370,"Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) are two pathways that can compete or cooperate for DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. NHEJ was previously shown to act throughout the cell cycle whereas HR is restricted to late S/G2. Paradoxically, we show here that defect in XRCC4 (NHEJ) leads to over-stimulation of HR when cells were irradiated in G1, not in G2. However, XRCC4 defect did not modify the strict cell cycle regulation for HR (i.e. in S/G2) as attested by (i) the formation of Rad51 foci in late S/G2 whatever the XRCC4 status, and (ii) the fact that neither Rad51 foci nor HR (gene conversion plus single-strand annealing) events induced by ionizing radiation were detected when cells were maintained blocked in G1. Finally, both γ-H2AX analysis and pulse field gel electrophoresis showed that following irradiation in G1, some DSBs reached S/G2 in NHEJ-defective cells. Taken together, our results show that when cells are defective in G1/S arrest, DSB produced in G1 and left unrepaired by XRCC4 can be processed by HR but in late S/G2."
https://openalex.org/W2012365790,"Mitotic spindle assembly in Xenopus egg extracts is regulated at least in part by importin β and its regulator, the small GTPase, Ran. RanGTP stabilizes microtubules near the chromosomes during spindle assembly by selectively releasing spindle assembly factors from inhibition by importin α/β in the vicinity of the chromosomes. Several spindle assembly factors are regulated in this manner. We identified maskin, the Xenopus member of the transforming acidic coiled coil family of proteins, as a potential candidate in a two-step affinity chromatography approach designed to uncover additional downstream targets of importin α/β in mitosis. Here, we show that although maskin lacks a canonical nuclear localization sequence, it binds importin β in a RanGTP-regulated manner. We further show that importin β inhibits the regulatory phosphorylation of maskin by Aurora-A. This suggests a novel mechanism by which importin β regulates the activity of a spindle assembly factor.

Chromosomes are segregated during cell division by the mitotic spindle, an elaborate macromolecular assembly composed of microtubules (MTs), 3The abbreviations used are: MT, microtubule; MAP, microtubule-associated protein; TACC, transforming acidic coiled coil; NLS, nuclear localization sequences; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. MT motor proteins, and many non-motor MT-associated proteins (MAPs) (1Gadde S. Heald R. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 797-805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Spindle assembly is driven by the selective stabilization of MTs near the chromosomes and their organization into a bipolar array. Two pathways contribute to bipolar spindle formation in most animal cells. In one pathway, MTs are nucleated by centrosomes and are captured by kinetochores on the chromosomes (“search and capture”). In the second pathway, MTs are nucleated in the vicinity of the chromosomes and are subsequently organized into bipolar spindles. It has become increasingly clear over the past few years that spindle assembly is regulated by proteins that, during interphase, are involved in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking (2Carazo-Salas R.E.

Cell. 2004; 16: 319-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). At the heart of this regulatory mechanism for mitotic spindle assembly lies importin β (8Wiese C. Wilde A. Moore M.S. Adam S.A. Merdes A. Zheng Y. Science. 2001; 291: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 9Nachury M.V. Maresca T.J. Salmon W.C. Waterman-Storer C.M. Heald R. Weis K. Cell. 2001; 104: 95-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). During interphase, importin β (mostly in concert with its adaptor protein, importin α) serves as the major nuclear transport receptor in the cell (10Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). It interacts with patches of basic amino acids (nuclear localization sequences (NLSs)) on proteins destined for the nucleus. The interactions between importin β and its “cargos” are regulated by the small GTPase, Ran (10Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). Binding of RanGTP (but not RanGDP) to importin β destabilizes the interaction between importin β and its cargo by causing importin β to adopt a conformation that facilitates cargo release (11Stewart M. Science. 2003; 302: 1513-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, importin β binds its cargo when RanGTP is low, and releases cargo in the presence of RanGTP. By restricting the production of RanGTP to the vicinity of chromosomes, the cell uses this loading/unloading cycle to drive NLS-containing proteins into the nucleus during interphase (10Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar, 11Stewart M. Science. 2003; 302: 1513-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A similar importin β binding/release cycle is thought to take place during mitosis in metazoa, albeit in the absence of the strict compartmentalization provided by the nuclear envelope (6Dasso M. Cell. 2001; 104: 321-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 7Harel A. Forbes D.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 319-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Regulating the activities of proteins that bind, stabilize, destabilize, and/or organize MTs allows rearrangement of the interphase MT array into a mitotic spindle. Several key mitotic spindle assembly proteins, including TPX2, NuMA, XCTK2, XKid, Rae1, Xnf7, HURP, and NuSAP, have been shown to bind importins during mitosis (8Wiese C. Wilde A. Moore M.S.

Although the molecular mechanism of importin β inhibition is not fully understood, it is clear that removal of importin β is a prerequisite for the function of these proteins in mitotic spindle assembly. Importins thus serve as potent inhibitors of spindle assembly. As is true for NLS-containing proteins during interphase, release of spindle assembly factors from the inhibitory effect of importin β during mitosis requires RanGTP. Because RanGTP is found mainly in the vicinity of mitotic chromosomes (21Kalab P. Weis K. Heald R. Science. 2002; 295: 2452-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 23Caudron M. Bunt G. Bastiaens P. Karsenti E. Science. 2005; 309: 1373-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), MT stabilization and spindle assembly preferentially take place near chromosomes in mitotic cells. However, a portion of RanGTP also localizes to centrosomes where it presumably regulates importin β binding to spindle assembly factors that act mainly at or near the minus ends of MTs (24Keryer G.

Consistent with this idea, importin α and β have also been found at spindle poles during mitosis (25Ciciarello M. Mangiacasale R. Thibier C. Guarguaglini G. Marchetti E. Di Fiore B. Lavia P. J.

Maskin is a Xenopus spindle assembly factor that stabilizes MTs and functions at centrosomes (27O'Brien L.L. Albee A.J. Liu L. Tao W. Dobrzyn P. Lizarraga S.B. Wiese C. Mol. Biol.

Members of this family share a ∼200-amino acid C-terminal coiled coil “TACC” domain that targets the TACC proteins to centrosomes (28Peset I. Seiler J. Sardon T. Bejarano L.A. Rybina S. Vernos I. J.

TACC proteins stabilize MTs (at least in part) by recruiting members of the XMAP215/TOG protein family to the centrosome (32Raff J.W.

Recombinant Xenopus maskin TACC domain alone is sufficient to rescue centrosome defects brought about by depleting maskin from egg extracts (27O'Brien L.L. Albee A.J. Liu L. Tao W. Dobrzyn P.

Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 1057-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), suggesting that the TACC domain plays an important role in centrosome function. The localization and activity of maskin are regulated by Aurora-A (28Peset I. Seiler J. Sardon T. Bejarano L.A. Rybina S. Vernos I. J.

Aurora-A is an essential protein kinase required for mitosis and centrosome maturation, a process in which centrosomes acquire additional MT nucleating material at the onset of mitosis (35Hannak E.

Cell Res. 2004; 301: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of maskin by Aurora-A on three residues (Ser33, Ser620, and Ser626) is required to localize maskin to the centrosome and activate its function (Refs. 28Peset I. Seiler J. Sardon T.

Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila Aurora-A homologs are similarly required to target TACC proteins to centrosomes and activate them (38Barros T.P. Kinoshita K. Hyman A.A. Raff J.W. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 41Le Bot N. Tsai M.C. Andrews R.K. Ahringer J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1499-1505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), suggesting that the regulation of TACC protein function by Aurora-A kinase is evolutionarily conserved. Here, we report isolating maskin in an assay designed to identify MT-binding proteins that are regulated by importin β. We show that maskin interacts with importin β in vitro, and this interaction is regulated by RanGTP. The direct interaction between maskin and importin β was unexpected because maskin lacks a canonical NLS. Using truncation mutants to map the importin β binding domain of maskin, we found that the central portion of maskin is important for importin β binding, but efficient binding requires the full-length protein. Most importantly, we show that importin β binding inhibits the phosphorylation of maskin by Aurora-A. These findings suggest a role for importin β in regulating maskin activity at the centrosome.

Concentrated mitotic extracts (5 ml/purification) were diluted with 1 volume of buffer (50 mm sucrose, 10 mm K-HEPES (pH 7.7), 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). This mixture was centrifuged at 192,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. The reaction was supplemented with Taxol (20 μm final; Molecular Probes) and pre-polymerized MTs (1/10 volume), and incubated at 22–25 °C. Pre-polymerized Taxol-stabilized MTs were prepared by incubating tubulin (0.43 mg) for 30 min at 37 °C with BRB80 containing 66% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm GTP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 μm Taxol.

The MT pellets were resuspended in buffer A (20 mm K-PIPES (pH 7.0), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, protease inhibitors, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol) and incubated for 20 min on ice to allow depolymerization of the Taxol-stabilized MTs. The mixture was centrifuged twice for 10 min at 110,000 × g at 4 °C to remove particulates, dialyzed against XB, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Importin β Affinity Chromatography—Mitotic MAPs were incubated with XB buffer and importin α, importin β, or both importin α plus importin β for 3 h at 4°C.

Reactions were stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Incorporation of label was detected by autoradiography using a PhosphorImager and was quantitated using Adobe Photoshop software. The Xenopus Spindle Assembly Factor Maskin Is a Potential Importin β Target—Several proteins that function to regulate mitotic spindle assembly or MT bundling have been shown to interact with importin β in mitosis (7Harel A. Forbes D.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 319-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 49Zheng Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 867-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To identify additional potential targets for regulation by importin β, we reasoned that at least a subset of proteins that regulate mitotic spindles through importin β should directly bind to both MTs and importin β. Other potential importin β binding targets, which were not selected for in our assay, might be regulatory factors that interact with MTs transiently, or not at all. To identify candidate MT binding targets, we isolated mitotic MAPs from Xenopus egg extracts (see “Experimental Procedures”), supplemented them with importin α (which in some cases acts as an adaptor between NLS-containing proteins and importin β), and loaded these onto an importin β affinity chromatography column. A distinct subset of mitotic MAPs specifically interacted with importin β, either directly or in the presence of importin α (marked with asterisks in Fig. 1A). These proteins were excised from the gel, digested with trypsin to generate peptides, and subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry to analyze peptide masses. Data base analysis of the peptide masses revealed that 11 peptides of the ∼100-kDa protein matched the expected masses of tryptic peptides of TPX2, covering 17% of the TPX2 sequence (not shown). Western blotting confirmed the presence of TPX2 in our final fraction (Fig. 1B). This result is consistent with previous reports that TPX2 is a downstream target of the Ran pathway in mitotic spindle assembly (12Gruss O.J. Carazo-Salas R.E. Schatz C.A. Guarguaglini G. Kast J.

Ruderman J. Prigent C. Zheng Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analysis further identified the ∼150-kDa protein as the Xenopus TACC protein, maskin, and this result was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 1B; 12 peptides matched). Maskin is involved in centrosome and spindle assembly in Xenopus egg extracts (27O'Brien L.L. Albee A.J. Liu L. Tao W. Dobrzyn P. Lizarraga S.B. Wiese C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2836-2847Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 29Kinoshita K. Noetzel T.L. Pelletier L. Mechtler K. Drechsel D.N. Schwager A. Lee M. Raff J.W. Hyman A.A. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 1047-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Interestingly, sequence analysis revealed that maskin lacks a canonical importin β binding domain. Maskin binding to importin β appeared to be independent of importin α, but more efficient in its presence (Fig. 1B; see also Fig. 2). We concluded that despite the absence of an NLS, maskin is a potential importin β target during mitosis. Maskin Interacts with Importin β in Vitro—Two possibilities could explain why the non-NLS-containing maskin was identified in an assay designed to uncover proteins that are regulated by importin β: 1) maskin interacts with importin β via an unconventional importin β binding domain; or 2) maskin interacts with importin β indirectly via other, NLS-bearing proteins. To distinguish between these possibilities, we tested the ability of maskin to interact with importin α and/or β in vitro, in the absence of the other MAPs. For this, recombinant proteins were incubated in vitro. Complexes were selectively isolated by affinity chromatography using the unique tag on one of the proteins (“pull-out” experiments). In one set of pull-out experiments, we incubated protein S-tagged importin β with importin α and/or maskin, isolated importin β using its protein-S tag, and probed for bound maskin (Fig. 2A). These experiments showed that maskin co-purified with importin β, and this binding was independent of importin α. Moreover, the interaction between importin β and maskin was abolished in the presence of RanL43E, a Ran point mutant that mimics its GTP-bound state (Fig. 2A). In another set of experiments, we incubated GST-tagged maskin with importin α and/or importin β, re-isolated GST-maskin using glutathione beads, and probed for bound importins (Fig. 2B). We found that maskin interacted directly with importin β as well as importin α, and the interaction between maskin and importin β was enhanced by the presence of importin α. Importantly, the maskin/importin β interaction was abolished by the addition of RanL43E but not by RanT24N (a RanGDP mimic) (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the in vitro interaction between maskin and importin β is regulated by RanGTP. The interaction between importin β and maskin was saturable: pull-out experiments with GST-maskin and increasing amounts of importin β (in the presence of constant levels of importin α) showed that the amount of importin β that co-purified with maskin reached a maximum that was not increased by an excess of importin β (Fig. 2C). Nonlinear regression analysis determined that the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) for the interaction between maskin and importin β was 1.3 ± 0.2 μm (Fig. 2D).

https://openalex.org/W2014882682,"The Tec family of tyrosine kinases transduces signals from antigen and other receptors in cells of the hematopoietic system. In particular, interleukin-2 inducible T cell kinase (Itk) plays an important role in modulating T cell development and activation. Itk is activated by receptors via a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-mediated pathway, which results in recruitment of Itk to the plasma membrane via its pleckstrin homology domain. We show here that membrane localization of Itk results in the formation of clusters of at least two molecules within 80 Å of each other, which is dependent on the integrity of its pleckstrin homology domain. By contrast, the proline-rich region within the Tec homology domain, SH3 or SH2 domains, or kinase activity were not required for this event. More importantly, these clusters of Itk molecules form in distinct regions of the plasma membrane as only receptors that recruit phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase reside in the same membrane vicinity as the recruited Itk. Our results indicate that Itk forms dimers in the membrane and that receptors that recruit Itk do so to specific membrane regions. The Tec family of tyrosine kinases transduces signals from antigen and other receptors in cells of the hematopoietic system.

Itk is activated by receptors via a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-mediated pathway, which results in recruitment of Itk to the plasma membrane via its pleckstrin homology domain. We show here that membrane localization of Itk results in the formation of clusters of at least two molecules within 80 Å of each other, which is dependent on the integrity of its pleckstrin homology domain. By contrast, the proline-rich region within the Tec homology domain, SH3 or SH2 domains, or kinase activity were not required for this event. More importantly, these clusters of Itk molecules form in distinct regions of the plasma membrane as only receptors that recruit phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase reside in the same membrane vicinity as the recruited Itk. Our results indicate that Itk forms dimers in the membrane and that receptors that recruit Itk do so to specific membrane regions. The Tec family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases is the second largest family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases (1Smith C. Islam T. Mattsson P. Mohamed A. Nore B. Vihinen M. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 436-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). This family, which includes Itk, 2The abbreviations used are: Itk, interleukin-2 inducible T cell kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; PH, pleckstrin homology domain; TH, Tec homology domain; SH2, Src homology domain 2; SH3, Src homology domain 3; PRR, proline-rich region; PI3, phosphatidylinositol 3; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; WT, wild-type. 2The abbreviations used are: Itk, interleukin-2 inducible T cell kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; PH, pleckstrin homology domain; TH, Tec homology domain; SH2, Src homology domain 2; SH3, Src homology domain 3; PRR, proline-rich region; PI3, phosphatidylinositol 3; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; WT, wild-type. is involved in transducing signals from a number of receptors, including the T cell receptor, B cell receptor, FcϵR, c-Kit, CD28, CD2, CD32, and the erythropoietin receptor (1Smith C.

Witte O. Wahl M. Blood. 2000; 95: 1663-1670PubMed Google Scholar). These kinases play important roles in regulating cytokine and immune receptor signals that regulate the immune response (7Amarante-Mendes. G. McGahon A. Nishioka W. Afar D. Witte O. Green D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 8Berg L. Finkelstein L. Lucas J. Schwartzberg P.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 549-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Itk in particular is involved in early T cell receptor signaling and regulates increases in intracellular calcium and activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells family of transcription factors (9Liu K. Bunnell S. Gurniak C. Berg L. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1721-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 10Fowell D. Shinkai K. Liao X. Beebe A. Coffman R. Littman D. Locksley R. Immunity. 1999; 11: 399-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In addition, Itk regulates the development of Th2 cells and their subsequent cytokine secretion, thereby modulating the immune response (10Fowell D. Shinkai K. Liao X. Beebe A. Coffman R. Littman D. Locksley R. Immunity. 1999; 11: 399-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 13Ferrara T. Mueller C. Sahu N. Ben-Jebria A. August A. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2006; 117: 780-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A common feature of these kinases is that they require the activation of PI3 kinase, as well as Src kinase activation for their activity (14Gibson S. August A. Branch D. Dupont B. Mills G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7079-7083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 17Yang W.C. Ching K.A. Tsoukas C.D. Berg L.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These kinases, including Itk, have a PH domain that allows them to be recruited to the plasma membrane by an activated PI3 kinase (1Smith C. Islam T. Mattsson P. Mohamed A. Nore B. Vihinen M. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 436-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Thus, membrane recruitment is a critical component of their activation, and Itk can be found at the plasma membrane of cells, although other events are required for its full activity (17Yang W.C. Ching K.A. Tsoukas C.D. Berg L.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 19August A. Sadra A. Dupont B. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11227-11232Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It is, however, not clear whether this is general membrane localization of the protein in anticipation of activation or a specific localization in certain regions of the plasma membrane. The structure of Itk in cells is not known, although it has been suggested to form dimers in its inactive state, with a resultant monomerization upon activation (20Brazin K.N. Mallis R.J. Fulton D.B. Andreotti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1899-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 21Colgan J. Asmal M. Neagu M. Yu B. Schneidkraut J. Lee Y. Sokolskaja E. Andreotti A.

Michnick S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 358-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) and find that Itk forms dimers or higher order clusters; however, it does so only at the plasma membrane and only in the vicinity of a receptor that can recruit PI3 kinase. Our data shed new light on the regulation, structure, and localization of this family of kinases in cells. Plasmids and Reagents—Antibodies against Itk were a gift from Dr. Gordon Mills (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center) (19August A. Sadra A. Dupont B. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11227-11232Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The pCDNA3.1-YFP1-zipper and pCDNA3.1-YFP2-zipper were a kind gift from Dr. Stephen Michnick (University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada) (22Remy I. Montmarquette A. Michnick S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 358-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The lentivirus vector FUGW and packaging plasmids pΔ8-9 and pVSVG were a kind gift from Dr. David Baltimore (California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA) (23Lois C. Hong E. Pease S. Brown E. Baltimore D. Science. 2002; 295: 868-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). The pCDNA3.1-YFP1-Itk was generated by deleting the zipper sequence of pCDNA3.1-YFP1-zipper and replacing it with the human Itk cDNA generated by PCR and sequenced to confirm the integrity. pCDNA3.1-YFP2-Itk plasmids was generated by deleting the YFP1 sequence of pCDNA3.1-YFP1-Itk and replacing it with the YFP2 fragment. Itk mutants lacking the PRR within the TH, SH3, or SH2 domain or carrying a K391M mutation in the kinase domain that significantly reduce kinase activity were previously described (19August A. Sadra A. Dupont B. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11227-11232Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 24Hao S. August A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 525: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The pG-ICOS-YFP1 and pMex-CD8α-YFP1 were generated by subcloning linker-YFP1 to the C terminus of pG-ICOS or pMex-CD8 fragment lacking the cytoplasmic tail (25Zong C. Yan R. August A. Darnell Jr., J. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4515-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), respectively. Point mutations were introduced by using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The FUGW-YFP1-Itk and FUGW-YFP2-Itk plasmids were generated by substituting the GFP fragment for YFP1-Itk or YFP2-Itk in the FUGW vector, respectively. The pGFP-Itk was generated by inserting GFP fragment to the N terminus of HA-Itk (24Hao S. August A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 525: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cell Transfection—HEK 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The plasmids were transfected into HEK-293T cells by using TransIT-293T (Mirus). Jurkat E6-1 T cells were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and were transfected by electroporation. Cells were infected with lentiviruses generated as described (23Lois C. Hong E. Pease S. Brown E. Baltimore D. Science. 2002; 295: 868-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). Flow Cytometric Assay—24 h after transfection, the cells were incubated at 30 °C overnight to promote fluorophore maturation. The cells were cultured, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in PBS followed by flow cytometric analysis. YFP fluorescence was corrected for expression by analysis of Itk expression either by western blot, or in most experiments, by analysis of YFP expression using an antibody against GFP and flow cytometry. These values were then compared with control cells transfected with YFP1-Itk or YFP2-Itk alone, which was set at 1. Confocal Microscopy—HEK 293T cells were grown on glass slides. 24 h after transfection, the cells were incubated at 30 °C overnight, and the fluorescence image was analyzed by confocal microscopy. For immunofluorescence microscopy, cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde for 20-30 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were then incubated with anti-Itk antibody in blocking buffer (2% fetal bovine serum and 0.1% Triton in PBS) for 1 h. After washing three times with PBS, cells were then stained with Alexa Fluor 663-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min in the dark. The unbound antibody was removed by washing three times with PBS. The cells were then incubated in PBS and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Since each cell is of a different size and may express varying levels of protein, an algorithm was developed to compare the localization of Itk molecules in cells of different sizes and varying levels of expression using the program CCDi Image (Stellar Image Software) as follows. 1) A line was drawn across the cells, excluding the nucleus, and the fluorescence intensity and map data points were collected for each cell; 2) points along the line were set as a percentage of the cell from one end of the line to the other (0-100%); 3) the fluorescence at each point was calculated as a percentage of the maximum fluorescence observed for that cell; and 4) these values were then plotted for each cell as the percentage of maximum fluorescence (y axis) versus the percentage of cell (x axis) for each cell. In general, the cell membrane represented that 15% of the cell at the edges (0-15% and 85-100%). Itk is recruited to cell membrane after receptor stimulation (3August A. Gibson S. Kawakami Y.

Wange R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29323-29330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, whether the localization of Itk results in specific clustering or a more dispersed distribution is not clear. To answer this question, we utilized the split YFP system to probe the interaction between molecules of Itk (22Remy I. Montmarquette A. Michnick S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 358-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Either YFP1 or YFP2 was fused to the N terminus of Itk using a linker peptide of 10 amino acids, thus constructing the protein designated as YFP1-Itk or YFP2-Itk, respectively (Fig. 1a). Since the average distance of each amino acid is ∼4 Å, the fluorescence can be detected when Itk molecules fused to the two fragments of YFP are within an average distance of 80 Å. These constructs were expressed in 293T cells, and fluorescence was analyzed by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. The expression of either YFP1-Itk or YFP2-Itk alone in cells did not show any detectable fluorescence when compared with non-transfected cells (data not shown), suggesting that expression of individual YFP fragment does not exhibit fluorescence, similar to what has been previously determined for other fusions (Fig. 1b) (22Remy I. Montmarquette A. Michnick S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 358-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). However, when YFP1-Itk and YFP2-Itk were coexpressed, strong fluorescence was detected (Fig. 1b). Since the YFP fluorescence can be detected when Itk molecules are in close proximity (<80 Å), these data indicate that Itk proteins formed specific dimers or higher order clusters in living cells that are within this range. To determine the subcellular sites of Itk clustering, we analyzed the localization of YFP fluorescence in these cells by using confocal microscopy. The YFP fluorescence was found predominantly at the cell membrane. In comparison, analysis of cells with an anti-Itk antibody revealed that Itk was distributed in both cytoplasm and cell membrane (Fig. 1c, control non-transfected 293T cells are negative for Itk staining by western and immunofluorescence, data not shown; see also Fig. 2b). In addition, GFP-tagged Itk also showed the same pattern of subcellular localization as that seen with the anti-Itk antibody (Fig. 1c). Quantification of the localization of these proteins dramatically illustrated the point that the YFP1 Itk and the YFP2 Itk only interact at the membrane, and thus, fluorescence is only detected at that location, whereas GFP Itk is found in both the cytoplasm and the membrane (Fig. 1d). Together, these results suggested that although localized both in the cytoplasm and at the cell membrane, Itk only forms dimers or higher order clusters as detected by complementation of YFP1 and YFP2 and subsequent fluorescence emission at the cell membrane. To further test the possibility that interaction between Itk molecules in the cytoplasm could occur, we generated an Itk mutant, R29C, which disrupts the ability of the PH domain to interact with lipids, rendering this mutant unable to be recruited to the membrane (29Li Z. Wahl M. Eguinoa A. Stephens L. Hawkins P. Witte O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13820-13825Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 30Woods M. Kivens W. Adelsman M. Qiu Y. August A. Shimizu Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1232-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, this mutant is totally constrained to the cytoplasm. The expression level of this mutant fused to YFP1 and YFP2 was determined by western blot (data not shown), and although expressed at a similar level as wild-type Itk, the R29C PH mutants did not show any detectable fluorescence when compared with untransfected 293T cells (Fig. 2, a and b). Specific anti-Itk antibody analysis of Itk, as well as YFP fusion to this Itk mutant, confirmed that it is localized only in the cytoplasm (Figs. 1, c and d, and 2b). More importantly, even when wild-type YFP1-Itk was coexpressed with the mutant YFP2-R29CItk, no interaction was detected as measured by YFP fluorescence and confocal microscopy (Fig. 2b). Thus, we conclude that the dimers and perhaps higher order clusters of Itk form only at the cell membrane, and thus, YFP fluorescence of YFP1-Itk plus YFP2-Itk can only be detected at the cell membrane but not in the cytoplasm. This experiment also indicates that the interaction between Itk molecules at the membrane is specific. Itk has several domains that can act as protein-protein interaction domains. We therefore disrupted the integrity of each of these domains to determine whether they were required for this dimerization. The PRR within the unique TH domain of Itk has been suggested to interact with the SH3 domain of Itk in an intramolecular interaction (31Andreotti A. Bunnell S. Feng S. Berg L. Schreiber S. Nature. 1997; 385: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). However, we found that Itk mutants carrying a deletion in the PRR of the TH domain could still form dimers with the WT Itk (Fig. 3a). In addition to potential interactions with the PRR of the TH domain, the SH3 domain of Itk has been suggested to interact with a proline residue in the SH2 domain of Itk in an intermolecular fashion (20Brazin K.N. Mallis R.J. Fulton D.B. Andreotti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1899-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 21Colgan J. Asmal M. Neagu M. Yu B. Schneidkraut J. Lee Y. Sokolskaja E. Andreotti A. Luban J. Immunity. 2004; 21: 189-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The SH2 domain can interact with other proteins upon their tyrosine phosphorylation. Nevertheless, we found that Itk mutants lacking SH3 or SH2 domains could still form dimers with WT Itk (Fig. 3, b and c). Finally, we could show that the kinase activity of Itk was not required for this event since a mutant of Itk lacking kinase activity still formed dimers with WT Itk (Fig. 3d). Since molecules of WT Itk cannot transport a PH domain mutant of Itk to the membrane and form dimers (Fig. 2), we conclude that the ability of these mutants to form dimers with WT Itk indicates that these domains or activities are not required for dimer formation. These data also indicate that the PRR or SH3 and SH2 domains are not critical for the formation of dimers or higher order clusters of Itk at the plasma membrane and that membrane localization is the critical event that brings two molecules of Itk together and allows the formation of dimers or higher order clusters. To investigate the specificity of Itk dimerization/clustering at the cell membrane, we determined whether Itk could interact with a transmembrane protein that does not normally interact with Itk. We deleted the cytoplasmic tail of the human CD8α receptor and fused it to YFP1 at the C terminus. CD8α is randomly distributed in the cell membrane, and if Itk was also randomly distributed, then the two proteins should be able to interact. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that coexpression of CD8α-YFP1 and YFP2-Itk did not result in the emission of any YFP fluorescence when compared with non-transfected 293T cells (Fig. 4a), suggesting that there was no interaction between these two proteins at the plasma membrane. The expression of the CD8α-YFP1 was confirmed by flow cytometry (Fig. 4a, Itk expression was confirmed by western blot as well as flow cytometry, data not shown). By contrast, when we analyzed whether Itk could interact with ICOS, a receptor that has a PI3 kinase binding motif and recruits PI3 kinase to the plasma membrane (32Coyle A. Lehar S. Lloyd C. Tian J. Delaney T. Manning S. Nguyen T. Burwell T. Schneider H. Gonzalo J. Gosselin M. Owen L. Rudd C. Gutierrez-Ramos J.

Commun. 2003; 310: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) using a similar approach, we found that Itk could interact with this receptor (Fig. 4b). Confocal analysis indicates that this interaction occurs at the cell membrane (Fig. 4b). This interaction was dependent on recruitment of Itk to the membrane by PI3 kinase as a R29C PH mutant of Itk could not interact with ICOS (Fig. 4c). Together, these data indicate that Itk forms specific dimers/clusters at specific regions of the cell membrane, around the vicinity of receptors capable of activating PI3 kinase. Since Itk is predominantly expressed in T cells, we analyzed the ability to form dimers/clusters at the plasma membrane in Jurkat T cells. Expression of YFP1-Itk and YFP2-ITK in Jurkat T cells demonstrated that Itk forms similar dimers/clusters in these cells at the cell membrane (Fig. 5a). In addition, similar to what we found in 293T cells with CD8α and ICOS, Itk only interacted with ICOS, but not with CD8α, in Jurkat T cells (Fig. 5, b and c). All together, our data suggest that Itk is recruited to specific regions of the plasma membrane, where it can form dimers/clusters, and this occurs in the vicinity of receptors that can recruit and activate PI3-kinase. We and others have shown that Itk is recruited to the plasma membrane in a PI3-kinase- and PH domain-dependent manner; however, whether this recruitment results in clustering/dimerization of Itk was not known. Our data demonstrate that at least dimers of Itk form specifically at the plasma membrane of cells. In addition, receptors capable of recruiting this kinase specifically interact with Itk, although we note that they do so less efficiently than the formation of Itk dimers. This could indicate that all the receptors are not capable at any one time of interacting with Itk, and thus, the efficiency is reduced. Although we cannot distinguish between the formation of dimers or higher order clusters, the data suggest that at least dimers are formed. In addition, our data also indicate that these dimers are at least 80 Å apart and that the interaction between Itk and ICOS is also at least the same distance.

A key factor in this process is the bacterial virulence protein VirE2, which associates stoichiometrically with the transported single-stranded (ss) DNA molecule (T-strand). As observed in vitro by transmission electron microscopy, VirE2-ssDNA readily forms an extended helical complex with a structure well suited to the tasks of DNA protection and nuclear import. Here we have elucidated the role of the specific molecular chaperone VirE1 in regulating VireE2-VirE2 and VirE2-ssDNA interactions. VirE2 alone formed functional filamentous aggregates capable of ssDNA binding. In contrast, co-expression with VirE1 yielded monodisperse VirE1–VirE2 complexes. Cooperative binding of VirE2 to ssDNA released VirE1, resulting in a controlled formation mechanism for the helical complex that is further promoted by macromolecular crowding. Based on this in vitro evidence, we suggest that the constrained volume of the VirB channel provides a natural site for the exchange of VirE2 binding from VirE1 to the T-strand.

The transfer of DNA from the soil bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens into plant cells is an efficient process utilizing both bacterial and host machineries (1Gelvin S.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol.

Detection of phenolic compounds released from wounded plant tissues leads to adhesion and induction of the bacterial virulence (vir) machinery. Vir proteins are responsible for the excision of the single-stranded transfer DNA (tDNA), a specific segment of the bacterial tumor-inducing plasmid. Its delivery to the host cell cytoplasm occurs in complex with a single VirD2 molecule attached at its 5′ end (the T-strand). The T-strand is wrapped with numerous VirE2 proteins to produce a mature transfer complex (T-complex) (3Tzfira T. Citovsky V. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 121-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), which is then imported into the host cell nucleus. Additional bacterial proteins and host factors are involved in genomic integration and expression of the encoded genes (1Gelvin S.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

It is well established that the T-strand and several other virulence proteins (i.e. VirE2, VirF, VirE3, and VirD5) are transported independently into the host plant cytoplasm via a type IV secretion system (7Zhao Z.M. Sagulenko E. Ding Z.Y. Christie P.J. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3855-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 8Cascales E. Christie P.J. Science. 2004; 304: 1170-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). However, the site of T-complex formation remains unclear. Co-inoculation of plants with a combination of individually avirulent Agrobacterium strains (ΔvirE2 and tDNA-) resulted in tumorigenesis (9Otten L. De Greve H. Leemans J. Hain R. Hooykaas P.J.J. Schell J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 195: 159-163Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar), suggesting that the mature T-complex forms in the plant cell rather than in the bacterium. This observation was further corroborated by transformation of VirE2-expressing tobacco plants with a ΔvirE2 Agrobacterium mutant (10Citovsky V. Zupan J. Warnick D. Zambryski P.

The mechanism by which VirE2 interaction with tDNA is inhibited in the bacterium, before translocation of the molecular substrates to the plant host, is still unresolved. VirE2 is a large (63.5 kDa) single-stranded DNA-binding protein. It binds without sequence specificity (10Citovsky V. Zupan J. Warnick D. Zambryski P.

The binding of VirE2 by its molecular chaperone VirE1, a 7.1-kDa protein located on the same operon as VirE2 (23McBride K.E. Knauf V.C. J.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6850-6855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VirE1–VirE2 association preserves the latter in a soluble, nonaggregated form essential for virulence (24Deng W.Y. Chen L.S. Peng W.T.

Agrobacterium strains lacking the virE1 gene or not expressing it in cis to virE2 are avirulent (7Zhao Z.M. Sagulenko E. Ding Z.Y. Christie P.J. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3855-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It was therefore proposed that VirE1 preserves VirE2 in a state suitable for translocation through the VirB/D4 channel (27Vergunst A.C. van Lier M.C.M. den Dulk-Ras A. Hooykaas P.J.J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 978-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), into which VirE2 and T-strand are targeted independently (28Vergunst A.C. Schrammeijer B. den Dulk-Ras A. de Vlaam C.M.T.

Here we have addressed the role of VirE1 in VirE2-ssDNA 2The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; MS, mass spectrometry; ESI, electrospray ionization; PEG, polyethylene glycol; DTT, dithiothreitol; SAXS, small-angle X-ray scattering; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. 2The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; MS, mass spectrometry; ESI, electrospray ionization; PEG, polyethylene glycol; DTT, dithiothreitol; SAXS, small-angle X-ray scattering; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. complex formation from a structural point of view. We found that in the absence of VirE1, VirE2 formed soluble filamentous aggregates that bind ssDNA. In contrast, when the two genes were co-expressed, a monodisperse species of VirE2 in complex with VirE1 was formed. VirE1 was dissociated from VirE2 upon binding of the latter to ssDNA. The dissociation and protein-DNA complex assembly processes then proceeded in a controlled manner that was promoted by macromolecular crowding effects. VirE2 Purification—Nopaline virE2 (29Citovsky V. De Vos G. Zambryski P. Science. 1988; 240: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) was cloned into the pET-28b vector (Novagen) and expressed in the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain by induction with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h. Following sonication in buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol) plus 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) and 170 units of protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem), inclusion bodies were isolated and purified by three washes in buffer A plus 2% Triton X-100. The inclusion bodies were then washed in buffer B (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) and denatured in buffer A plus 5 m urea. Following refolding by dialysis against buffer C (10 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm DTT) VirE2 was purified on a ceramic hydroxyapatite column using a linear gradient of phosphate buffer ranging from 10 to 500 mm. VirE2 eluted at 150 mm KH2PO4 and was further purified by gel filtration (Pharmacia HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200). Purified fractions of the protein were pooled, concentrated separately to 0.5 mg/ml, and stored at –80 °C. VirE1–VirE2 Co-expression and Purification—The virE1 and virE2 genes were cloned into pACYCDuet-1 (Novagen). VirE1 expressed from this vector bears an N-terminal His6 tag followed by a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site (ENLY-FQG), whereas VirE2 is untagged. BL21(DE3) cells harboring the VirE1–VirE2 duet plasmid were induced by 0.05 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at A600 0.6. The culture was harvested after additional growth for 18 h at 15 °C. Bacterial pellets were sonicated in buffer D (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT). The VirE1–VirE2 complex was captured on a nickel-chelating column (Pharmacia HiTrap-chelating) and eluted at 200 mm imidazole. Following buffer exchange by dialysis to buffer C, the complex was purified on a heparin column (Pharmacia HiTrap heparin) with a linear salt gradient to 1 m NaCl. The VirE1–VirE2 complex eluted at 200 mm NaCl and was treated with tobacco etch virus protease to remove the His6 tag from VirE1. Final purification of the complex was done by gel filtration in buffer T (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA). Expression and Purification of N- and C-terminal His6-tagged VirE2—Nopaline virE2 (29Citovsky V. De Vos G. Zambryski P. Science. 1988; 240: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) was His6-tagged at its N or C terminus by cloning into pET-28b (Novagen). For the N-terminal fusion, virE2 was cloned between the HindIII and XhoI sites, whereas for the C-terminal fusion, it was cloned between the NcoI and XbaI sites. Both constructs were expressed and purified as described above. BL21(DE3) pLysS cells containing the expression plasmids were induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Clean inclusion bodies containing tagged VirE2 were denatured in buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol) plus 6 m guanidine hydrochloride. Soluble protein was captured on a nickel-chelating column (Pharmacia HiTrap-Chelating). Buffer was then changed to buffer E (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 6 m urea) and protein refolded on the nickel column by gradual exchange to buffer A without urea. Refolded protein was eluted from the column at 200 mm imidazole. Fractions containing the protein were pooled, dialyzed against buffer T, and stored in aliquots at 0.5 mg/ml at –80 °C. Single-stranded DNA (M13mp18 ssDNA, New England Biolabs) or 20-mer oligo-DNA with an arbitrary sequence (AGCTACCATGGCTTCATCAG; Metabion FPLC pure) were denatured by heating to 70 °C for 5 min and then cooled on ice for 5 min. VirE2 or VirE1–VirE2 was added and allowed to interact for ∼3 h at room temperature in buffer H (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT). Mixing ratios are denoted as w/w; complete coverage of VirE2:ssDNA corresponds to a 10:1 VirE2:ssDNA ratio. Samples of 5–10 μlat a final protein concentration of 50–100 μg/ml were deposited on glow-discharged carbon-coated 400 copper grids and stained with 1% uranyl acetate for 30 s. The interaction of DNA with uranyl acetate rendered some of the specimens positively stained, allowing for the detection of both protein and ssDNA. Images were recorded on a charge-coupled device camera (TVIPS) using either an FEI Tecnai T12 or F20 transmission electron microscopy (TEM). To check for complex formation between VirE2 or VirE1–VirE2 and ssDNA, samples were analyzed relative to naked DNA on 0.8% agarose gel and stained with GelStar (Cambrex). Alternatively, 5′ 32P radioactively labeled 20-mer ssDNA substrate (sequence above) was used, and the samples were analyzed on 12% acrylamide nondenaturing gel. The gel was then dried on filter paper and analyzed by phosphoimager (Fuji, Inc.). The composition of the complex formed between VirE1–VirE2 and ssDNA was determined by filtration and gel electrophoresis. VirE1–VirE2 complex was mixed with M13 ssDNA at a 25:1 w/w ratio for ∼3 h and then filtered through a NanoSep device (Pall, Inc.) with 300-kDa cutoff. Filtration was repeated twice, increasing the volume of the concentrate to 200 μl before each filtration step. The fractions were probed on a 15% Tricine gel (30Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar) followed by silver staining to reveal the 7.1 kDa-VirE1 protein. Equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation was performed in UV absorption mode at 4 °C in a Beckman XL-A instrument using sample cells fitted with 6-channel centerpieces. The VirE1–VirE2 protein stock solution was diluted successively in buffer T to obtain solutions of 3.0, 1.0, and 0.5 mg/ml protein. To extend the measurement range to higher concentrations, absorbance data were collected at 250 nm as well as at 280 nm. Measurements were repeated over 48 h at 7000 rpm following preliminary trials at 6000, 9000, and 10000 rpm. The data were analyzed by plotting the natural logarithm of the optical absorption (proportional to concentration) versus the square of the radius from the center of rotation. For a homogeneous sample the slope of this plot is proportional to the molecular mass (MM) according to Equation 1, MM=2RT(1-ρν¯)ω2×dlncdr2(Eq. 1) where R is the gas constant, ω is the angular velocity, ρ is the solution density (assumed equal to unity), and ν- is the partial specific volume of the protein (calculated to be 0.72 from amino acid content by the UltraScan software suite). To determine the stoichiometry of the VirE1–VirE2 complex, electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem MS (MS/MS) experiments were preformed on a QSTAR XL instrument. Prior to MS analysis, 30 μl of a 1.8 mg/ml solution of His6-VirE1–VirE2 in 10 mm KH2PO4 and 0.2 m NaCl was buffer-exchanged twice into 0.5 m ammonium acetate solution using Bio-Rad Biospin columns and stored on ice. Typically, a 2-μl aliquot was loaded for sampling via NanoESI capillaries prepared in-house from borosilicate glass tubes as described previously (31Nettleton E.J. Sunde M. Lai Z. Kelly J.W. Dobson C.M. Robinson C.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The following experimental parameters were used: capillary voltage up to 1.2 kV, declustering potential 150 V, focusing potential 250 V, second declustering potential 30 V focusing rod offset 40 V, and microchannel plate detector 2350 V. In MS/MS the relevant m/z value was selected in the quadrupole, and collision energies up to 120 V were employed. Argon was used as a collision gas at maximum pressure. All spectra were calibrated externally by using a solution of cesium iodide (100 mg/ml). Spectra in Fig. 4 are shown with minimal smoothing and without background subtraction. SAXS data were collected on the X33 camera of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory at the storage ring DORIS III (Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY), Hamburg) (32Boulin C. Kempf R. Koch M.H.J. McLaughlin S.M. Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res. A. 1986; 249: 399-407Crossref Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Purified solutions of the co-expressed VirE1–VirE2 complex were measured in buffer T at 7.8 and 3.9 mg/ml concentrations (determined by UV absorption at 280 nm, with ϵ = 49,760 cm–1 m–1) using a mar345 Image Plate Detector in the range of momentum transfer 0.13 < s < 3.0 nm–1 (s = 4π sin(θ)/λ), where 2θ is the scattering angle and λ = 0.15 nm is the x-ray wavelength). Data were processed following standard procedures by the programs PRIMUS (33Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H.J. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2275) Google Scholar) and GNOM (34Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2875) Google Scholar) to yield the final scattering pattern, overall parameters, and the distance distribution function p(r) of the particle. The molecular mass of the solute was evaluated by comparison with the scattering from a reference solution of bovine serum albumin. The shape of VirE1–VirE2 was restored ab initio using the simulated annealing program DAMMIN (35Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar). Multiple shape reconstructions were analyzed by the program DAMAVER (36Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 860-864Crossref Scopus (1578) Google Scholar) yielding the most representative models of VirE1–VirE2. For display, these models were converted to a volume of uniform density with a Gaussian low-pass filter of 3.0 nm using pdb2mrc from the EMAN image processing suite (37Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2093) Google Scholar). VirE2 Alone Forms Functional Aggregates—VirE2 forms inclusion bodies when overexpressed in E. coli (12Das A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2909-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). After refolding, size exclusion gel filtration analysis revealed that the major fraction of protein eluted from the column in the void volume, indicating soluble aggregates of molecular weight greater than the cutoff of 600,000 Da (Fig. 1A). A 20-mer DNA oligomer readily associates with the VirE2 aggregates as seen by gel shift analysis (Fig. 1B). Twenty bases correspond to the binding footprint of VirE2 (63.5 kDa) to ssDNA (average molecular weight 315/base) at a 10:1 w/w ratio corresponding to the observed saturation of protein binding, i.e. maximal gel shift or, equivalently, “full coverage” of the DNA by protein (15Citovsky V. Guralnick B. Simon M.N. Wall J.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 718-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 16Abu-Arish A. Frenkiel-Krispin D. Fricke T. Tzfira T. Citovsky V. Wolf S.G. Elbaum M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25359-25363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus the aggregated protein retains DNA binding activity. The maximal gel shift of the complex formed by this protein with 20-mer ssDNA required a protein:DNA ratio of 15:1 (w/w), 50% higher than the saturating ratio observed with long ssDNA substrates. This indicates a coexistence of DNA-bound and unbound protein. Purified soluble aggregates of VirE2 alone, and VirE2 in complex with oligo-DNA, were analyzed by TEM. In the absence of DNA, the VirE2 protein stock appeared as filamentous aggregates of indistinct shape with a typical diameter of ∼14 nm (Fig. 2A). After incubation for several hours at room temperature, a few percent of these aggregates adopted a helical structure (Fig. 2A, inset) similar to that of complexes formed between VirE2 and long ssDNA (Fig. 2B). Compact aggregates are identified with tetrameric rings described previously (16Abu-Arish A. Frenkiel-Krispin D. Fricke T. Tzfira T. Citovsky V. Wolf S.G. Elbaum M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25359-25363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Well ordered helical complexes were also formed following incubation of VirE2 with 20-mer oligo-DNA (Fig. 2C). These complexes reached several micrometers in length despite the fact that this DNA substrate matches the binding footprint of a single VirE2 protein. Thus, the transition of VirE2 aggregates into helical conformation is promoted by the binding to ssDNA. The effect on complex formation of peptide tags at either end of VirE2 was examined by fusion of a His6 tag to the N or C terminus of VirE2. Tagged VirE2 retained ssDNA binding activity (gel shift, not shown), although the complexes that were formed lacked an extended helical morphology and appeared instead as “beads on a string” (Fig. 2D). Complexes formed with N- and C-terminally-tagged VirE2 were indistinguishable in the electron microscope. Fusions at either terminus therefore appear to modify VirE2-VirE2 protein contacts without disturbing protein-DNA association. VirE2 Forms Soluble Complexes When Co-expressed with VirE1—To imitate the natural state of VirE2 in Agrobacterium, we co-expressed it together with VirE1. A soluble VirE1–VirE2 complex was formed (Fig. 3A), which could be concentrated to more than 15 mg/ml. Gel filtration indicated that the complex is monodisperse (Fig. 3B), whereas comparison with calibration standards suggested a molecular mass of 135 kDa (not shown). Because protein migration in size exclusion chromatography depends on molecular shape as well as mass, we performed equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation to assess the oligomerization state of the VirE1–VirE2 complex. Analysis of a VirE1–VirE2 sample at 1 mg/ml concentration yielded a molecular mass of 67.9 kDa. Other protein concentrations gave similar results, with sample-to-sample variations on the order of 10%, and no systematic trend was found with the sample concentration. The mass calculated from analytical ultracentrifugation experiments is clearly inconsistent with more than one VirE2 protein (63.5 kDa) in the assembly. It was not possible, however, to determine whether one or more VirE1 molecules bound per VirE2. To determine the VirE1–VirE2 stoichiometry, mass spectrometry measurements were conducted (Fig. 4). The mass spectrum of the complex gave rise to a charge series centered around 3,750 m/z. The measured mass of 72,956 ± 21 corresponds to a 1:1 stoichiometry between VirE1 and VirE2. To confirm the composition of the complex, the 19+ charge state was selected for tandem MS experiments. The complex dissociates into a relatively highly charged VirE1 monomer in the low m/z region and a VirE2 protein in the 5,000–7,000 m/z region. The measured mass for VirE2 is 63,451 Da, which is in close agreement with the mass calculated from the protein sequence. Structural Characterization of VirE1–VirE2 Complex by SAXS—To gain further insight into VirE1–VirE2 complex structure, SAXS analysis was performed. Fig. 5A presents the background-corrected and processed scattering curve. Because primarily ordered regions contribute to the scattering signal, it can be inferred that VirE2 is maintained in an ordered (i.e. folded) conformation within the complex. The radius of gyration and maximum size (4.2 ± 0.2 and 14 ± 1 nm, respectively) point to a rather anisometric structure. This interpretation is confirmed by the profile of the distance distribution function typical for elongated particles shown in Fig. 5B. Several independent simulated annealing runs of the ab initio program DAMMIN (35Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar) without symmetry imposition (P1) yielded reproducible shapes all neatly fitting the experimental data with discrepancy χ = 0.90 (solid curve in Fig. 5A). A representative solution is presented in Fig. 5C, showing a suggested molecular outline, or surface, of the VirE2 protein generated from the scattering data. VirE1 Competes with ssDNA for Binding to VirE2—The interaction of VirE1–VirE2 with ssDNA resulted in the formation of a nucleoprotein complex (Fig. 6A). VirE2-ssDNA complex formation was substantially improved when a crowding agent, polyethylene glycol (PEG 8000), was added to the reaction mixture. The excluded volume environment introduced by the crowding agent (38Zimmerman S.B. Minton A.P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 27-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar) thus promoted subunit association and cooperative elongation of the VirE2-ssDNA filament (13Sen P. Pazour G.J. Anderson D. Das A. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2573-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 14Citovsky V. Wong M.L. Zambryski P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1193-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In contrast to VirE2 alone, however, 20-mer DNA did not form complexes when mixed with VirE1–VirE2 (Fig. 6B), indicating that complex formation in the presence of VirE1 requires long ssDNA substrates. To determine whether the complex formed by the mixing of VirE1–VirE2 with long ssDNA substrates still contains VirE1, its composition was analyzed using a filtration device with a cutoff of 300 kDa. In such a membrane, the 7.2 kb-M13mp18 ssDNA substrate is retained, whereas the VirE1–VirE2 complex can pass. The retained fraction as well as the two eluted filtrates was probed on a 15% Tricine gel (Fig. 6C). VirE1 was present only in the filtrates, whereas VirE2 appeared in all fractions, demonstrating that VirE1 is displaced by the ssDNA rather than retained in the nucleoprotein complex. Association of VirE2 to ssDNA in the Presence of VirE1—The interaction of VirE1–VirE2 complex and M13 ssDNA at various mixing ratios was characterized by TEM. Positively stained specimens prepared at sub-saturating VirE2:ssDNA ratios, in which the DNA was not fully coated with VirE2, allowed the detection of both protein and DNA along the same complex (Fig. 7A). In addition to bare and VirE2-coated DNA, we observed compact rings (Fig. 7A, black arrowhead), which can be compared with similar structures seen previously with VirE1-free VirE2 (16Abu-Arish A. Frenkiel-Krispin D. Fricke T. Tzfira T. Citovsky V. Wolf S.G. Elbaum M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25359-25363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Saturating protein ratios seen by gel shift analysis (Fig. 6A) resulted in continuous coating of the ssDNA by VirE2 (Fig. 7B), with a structure identical to that of complexes formed between VirE2 aggregates and ssDNA (Fig. 2, B and C). Data presented here suggest that VirE1 inhibits the formation of VirE2 aggregates and regulates the assembly of VirE2-ssDNA complexes. In the absence of VirE1, VirE2 tends to self-associate both in vivo and in vitro (24Deng W.Y. Chen L.S. Peng W.T. Liang X.Y. Sekiguchi S. Gordon M.P. Comai L. Nester E.W. Mol.

Indeed, we observed that VirE2 adopted an irregular filamentous form in the absence of ssDNA. This aggregated protein retained its biochemical function, however, as helically ordered filaments formed upon addition of s"

Our validation studies demonstrated that the level of calpain activity correlates with a decrease in FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) between the two fluorescent proteins. Using this model, we observed a small level of activity after denervation and fasting, a high level of activity during muscle regeneration and ischemia, and local activity in damaged myofibers after exercise. Finally, we crossed the CAFI mouse with the α-sarcoglycan-deficient model, demonstrating an increase of calpain activity at the steady state.

Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2305) Google Scholar). Through limited proteolysis of their substrates, they were proposed to regulate key cellular functions involving cytoskeleton reorganization such as cell adhesion, cell motility, vesicular trafficking, as well as signal transduction and apoptosis (1Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2305) Google Scholar). However, several crucial questions on calpain biology remain unanswered. For instance, few clues exist on where and when calpains could be activated in the cell. We also have no clear data on the level of activity of calpains at the steady state. Inappropriate calpain activation has been implicated in various disease states including traumatic spinal cord and brain injuries, cataract formation, cerebral and heart ischemia, hypertension, arthritis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease (2Spencer M.J.

Toxicol. 2004; 44: 349-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The cell injury in most of these pathologies is initiated by the loss of Ca2+ homeostasis, which leads to calpain activation, cleavage of structural and regulatory proteins, and finally to necrotic cell death (7Allen D.G. Whitehead N.P. Yeung E.W. J. Physiol. 2005; 567: 723-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 8Du S. Rubin A. Klepper S. Barrett C. Kim Y.C. Rhim H.W. Lee E.B. Park C.W. Markelonis G.J.

The implication of calpains in these disorders has identified them as important potential therapeutic targets and has raised interest in the use of specific calpain inhibitors as a potent treatment (10Wang K.K.

The ability to follow in vivo calpain activity is important for physiological, pathological, and therapeutic evaluations. For this purpose, genetically encoded probes that monitor calpain activity have been published in recent years (14Stockholm D. Bartoli M. Sillon G. Bourg N. Davoust J. Richard I. J. Mol.

In this report, we generated a mouse model expressing an indicator of calpain activity, based on the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) 3The abbreviations used are: FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; CAFI, calpain activity monitored by FRET imaging; ES, embryonic stem cell; HAT, hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine; ROI, region of interest; eCFP, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein; eYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; hprt, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase; TA, Tibialis anterior; CP1B, calpain inhibitor peptide. 3The abbreviations used are: FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; CAFI, calpain activity monitored by FRET imaging; ES, embryonic stem cell; HAT, hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine; ROI, region of interest; eCFP, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein; eYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; hprt, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase; TA, Tibialis anterior; CP1B, calpain inhibitor peptide. technique. We named this model CAFI for calpain activity monitored by FRET imaging. After performing validation studies, this model was used to quantify the proteolytic activity of ubiquitous calpains in several biological processes in skeletal muscle. Calpain activity was visualized in vivo in exercise-induced damages after denervation, after fasting, during the degeneration and regeneration processes following injury, and during ischemia. We also crossed this model with a model deficient in α-sarcoglycan (16Duclos F. Straub V. Moore S.A. Venzke D.P. Hrstka R.F. Crosbie R.H. Durbeej M. Lebakken C.S. Ettinger A.J. van der Meulen J. Holt K.H. Lim L.E. Sanes J.R. Davidson B.L. Faulkner J.A. Williamson R. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1461-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and demonstrated an elevation of basal calpain activity compared with normal muscle. Our data showed that the CAFI model can be useful for realtime visualization of spatial and temporal activity of calpains under physiological and pathological conditions. Generation of CAFI and SARCAFI Models—The construction of the reporter cassette was previously described (14Stockholm D. Bartoli M. Sillon G. Bourg N. Davoust J. Richard I. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). CAFI mice were generated by Speedy Mouse® Technology (Nucleis, France) to produce a single copy transgene insertion at the hprt locus. The coding sequence of the calpain sensor was excised as a NheI-AflII fragment and cloned into the EcoRI site of the polylinker of the Gateway® pENTR-1A vector (Invitrogen) previously modified to include the ubiquitous cytomegalovirus immediate-early enhancer chicken β-actin hybrid (CAG) promoter (17Ikawa M. Kominami K. Yoshimura Y. Tanaka K. Nishimune Y. Okabe M. Dev. Growth Differ. 1995; 37: 455-459Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The transgene was then transferred by the Gateway technology into a destination vector pDEST-HPRT (Nucleis) carrying two homologous arms of the hprt gene. The vector was linearized using PvuI and electroporated into hprt-deficient BPES-embryonic stem (ES) cells by standard methods. The targeting construct contained the missing sequences in BPES-ES cells and two regions of homology of the hprt gene, which allowed insertion of the transgene at this locus (Fig. 1). The targeted ES clones were efficiently selected, thanks to the restoration of the ability to grow in hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine (HAT) medium through a correct homologous recombination. Genotyping of HAT-resistant ES clones was performed by PCR analysis of genomic DNA using a forward primer from the eCFP gene, 181CFP.F 5′-CTCGTGACCACCTTCGGCT-3′ and a reverse primer from the poly(A) sequence, SV40polyA_45pb.m 5′-GTTTCAGGTTCAGGGGGAGG-3′. Samples were amplified for 30 cycles, each consisting of denaturation at 94 °C for 40 s, annealing at 60 °C for 40 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 40 s. Targeted ES cells were injected into C57BL/6-derived blastocysts that were then transplanted into the uteri of recipient females. Resulting chimeric males were bred with C57BL/6 females, and the F1 agouti female off-spring were backcrossed with C57BL/6 males. Animals were genotyped by visualization of the fluorescence of the tail sample after YFP excitation. Hemizygous CAFI females were crossed with Sgca-null males (16Duclos F. Straub V. Moore S.A. Venzke D.P. Hrstka R.F. Crosbie R.H. Durbeej M. Lebakken C.S. Ettinger A.J. van der Meulen J. Holt K.H. Lim L.E. Sanes J.R. Davidson B.L. Faulkner J.A. Williamson R. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1461-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Analysis of the progeny was performed by fluorescence examination of the tail sample for the CAFI locus and genotyping with the following primers: KOscgINT1.s 5′-CAGGGCTGGGAGCTGGGTTCTG-3′, KOscgEX2.as 5′-CCCAGGGCCTTGATGCCT-3′ and KOscgNEOTR.as 5′-GCTATCAGGACATAGCGTTGGCTA-3′ for the Sgca locus. Using these primers, the Sgca wild-type locus gives a band of 1061 bp, and the mutated locus a band of 618 bp. Females that were fluorescent and positive for one Sgca-null allele were then crossed with Sgca-null males. The progeny was analyzed as stated above to identify the mice that were homozygous for the Sgca mutation while carrying the fluorescent reporter. In Vivo Experiments—Control mice from the C57BL/6 strain were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Les Oncins, France). CAFI and SARCAFI mice were produced at our in-house facility. All animal experiments were carried out in agreement with European and national regulations and guidelines. Mice were subjected to the following different treatments (n = 3-10 for each condition). (i) Artificial induction of calpain activation: a solution containing 100 mm CaCl2, 15 μm ionomycin, 7% fetal calf serum, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) in a final volume of 50 μl was injected in the muscle. (ii) Fasting: mice were fasted for a 24-h period with water available ad libitum. A subgroup was refed for 6 h before the microscopic examination. (iii) Exercise: mice were forced to run downhill for 1 h at a speed of 10 m/min on a treadmill with a 15° slope. (iv) Degeneration/regeneration of the muscle: 20 μl of notexin (10 μg/ml) were injected in the left TA muscle. (v) Chronic denervation of the muscle: this condition was obtained by cutting the sciatic nerve as described (18Stockholm D. Herasse M. Marchand S. Praud C. Roudaut C. Richard I. Sebille A. Beckmann J.S. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C1561-1569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). (vi) Ischemia of the muscle: after dissection, the femoral artery was ligatured with Mersilk braided non-absorbable silk (Ethicon). At the time of examination, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamin (100 mg/kg) and xylazin (10 mg/kg). A glass coverslide was positioned on the exposed muscle, and mice were placed on the microscope for direct observation. Fluorescence and FRET Imaging—FRET microscopy set-up was previously described (14Stockholm D. Bartoli M. Sillon G. Bourg N. Davoust J. Richard I. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Laser scanning confocal images were collected on a Bio-Rad confocal microscope system. Analysis was performed in ImageJ with custom-made software named FRET Compute Environment. The software (freely available upon request) implemented as an ImageJ plug-in is designed in four modules that can be used independently or successively through a graphical user interface. The first module converts the images acquired by the LaserSharp software into tiff files. The second module enables the calculation of spectral bleed-through coefficients. The third module calculates the FRET efficiency (FRETeff) and stores the results in float images (32 bits) and in RG images, consisting of a superimposition of the donor (eCFP) channel in green and FRET channel in red. The last module permits the creation of pseudocolor images, giving a comprehensive interpretation of FRETeff calculations. To obtain such images, the float images were first converted in an 8-bit pseudocolor image using a classic rainbow look-up table (red for minimum values, green for middle, and blue for high values). Donor channel pixels below a minimum threshold (50Zimowska M. Constantin B. Papy-Garcia D. Raymond G. Cognard C. Caruelle J.P. Moraczewski J. Martelly I. J. Cell. Physiol. 2005; 205: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) or higher than a maximum threshold (200) are represented in gray scale in the pseudocolor images. The mean FRET efficiency was calculated on the region of interest (ROI) either selected inside fibers or corresponding to the complete image, when there was homogeneity of FRET efficiency. The calculation of FRETeff in this plug-in takes into account G, a factor that relates the quenching of donor emission due to FRET, to the sensitized emission of the acceptor (19Gordon G.W. Berry G. Liang X.H. Levine B. Herman B. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2702-2713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). To determine G experimentally, we expressed a CFP-YFP tandem for which the FRETeff was previously established by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. 4Dr. Marc Tramier, personal communication. We obtained a G value with a mean of 1.7 ± 0.1 after the analysis of various ROIs of muscles fibers expressing the eCFP-eYFP tandem (n = 3 independent experiments). For FRAP experiments, a Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope (Leica, Mannheim, Germany) was used. Eight bleaching pulses at an excitation of 514-nm wavelength with 100% intensity of an argon laser were initiated at time 0 using a ×20 microscope objective lens. The recovery of fluorescence following the bleach was monitored every 5 s for 3 min and collected through the FRAP module of the Leica software. Western Blot—For the in vitro analysis, organs were cut in three equivalent pieces. One-third was put in lysis buffer (Tris-HCl, 20 mm pH 7.5, NaCl 150 mm, 1% Triton) supplemented with 5 mm EDTA, Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 2 μm E64 (Sigma) and immediately pulverized. These samples were used as a control. The second third was put in lysis buffer supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2 for activation, and the last third was put in lysis buffer supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2 plus 100 μm MDL28170 (Sigma) and 50 or 100 μm of calpain inhibitor peptide (CP1B, C9181, Sigma). The two last samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C before pulverization. 10 μg of samples were then processed for Western blotting using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against GFP (Abcam, AB6556-25, dilution 1:5,000) according to standard procedures. For analysis of the cleavage of the reporter, muscles were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen, pulverized with UltraTurrax, and rapidly solubilized in Tris-HCl, 20 mm, pH 7.5, NaCl, 150 mm, 2 mm EGTA, 1% Triton containing the Complete Miniprotease Inhibitor mixture and 2 μm E64. After centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 5 min at +4 °C, the supernatants were mixed with 1mm dithiothreitol and 1× LDS NuPAGE Buffer (Invitrogen) before they were denaturated at 70 °C for 10 min and processed for Western blot as above. Detection of Evans Blue-positive Fibers and Immunofluorescence—SARCAFI mice were injected intraperitoneally with Evans blue dye (1 mg/g of body weight). The following day, mice were sacrificed, and muscles were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane. Cryosections (10-μm thickness) were prepared from frozen muscles. Evans blue-positive fibers were revealed by fluorescence excitation at 633 nm. Transverse sections were processed for hematoxylin and eosin staining. Immunohistochemical detection of MHCd was performed according to standard procedures with the primary antibody NCL-MHCd (Novocastra). Statistical Analysis—To determine whether the FRETeff differed between treated and corresponding controls, statistical analyses were performed using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test, corrected for ties. Production and Characterization of Mice Expressing the Calpain Sensor—The FRET calpain reporter used in this study (calpain sensor) codes for a fusion protein consisting of eYFP, a cleavage site of α-fodrin, and eCFP. We previously validated by gene transfer experiments the use of this reporter as an effective tool to detect the proteolytic activity of ubiquitous calpains in living mice (14Stockholm D. Bartoli M. Sillon G. Bourg N. Davoust J. Richard I. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A mouse model carrying a single copy of this reporter at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (hprt) locus was generated by the Speedy Mouse® technology. After construction of the targeting vector, electroporation into BPES-ES cells and selection on HAT medium, three resistant clones were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts and implanted in recipient females. Two of them gave nine chimeric males with about 100% chimerism. These founders were crossed with C57BL/6 mice, and experiments were conducted in F1-F4 male progeny. CAFI mice produce litters of normal size and sex ratio and have the expected longevity. Histological examination of tissues revealed no discernable phenotype associated with the expression of the sensor. As expected, a robust fluorescence was detected by direct microscopic examination in selected organs (Fig. 2). In accordance with the fluorescence level, a Western blot performed using an anti-GFP polyclonal antibody gave a strong response in these tissues (data not shown). These analyses showed that the reporter is highly expressed in our model and gave fluorescence sufficiently strong for high resolution in vivo imaging. Considering the level of calpain activity in the context of muscular dystrophies and given the easy access to muscle for experimentation, we focused our attention on muscle tissue. A lower limb was sectioned transversally as a whole, confirming the general distribution of the fluorescence (Fig. 3A). Fluorescence was detected throughout all the myofibers, including the nuclear compartment, without any aggregates being identified (Fig. 3B). It must be noted that in our microscopic set-up, no autofluorescence was detected in normal muscles (data not shown). As occasionally a sarcomeric pattern could be observed, we performed a one-photon fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiment to determine whether any of the reporter molecules was bound to the sarcomere. A restoration calculated to be 99% of the initial fluorescence was observed within 1 min, indicating that the molecules are freely diffusible and that they would be therefore readily accessible to calpains wherever localized (Fig. 3C). A similar sarcomeric pattern can be seen with other reporters and should correspond to a negative image of the Z disc, a dense protein network of the sarcomere. Validation of the Reporter Functionality—After sampling, pulverized powder of different tissues was incubated in vitro in the presence of Ca2+ for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of MDL28170, a potent inhibitor of the ubiquitous calpains. Subsequent analysis of these samples by anti-GFP Western blotting allowed the visualization of the extent of the reporter cleavage. On control samples, no cleavage was evidenced with the exception of the kidney (Fig. 4A, lane a). In this tissue, an elevated activity was later confirmed by FRET analysis (data not shown). Because this organ was sampled before others where no activity was observed, we can exclude an artifactual activation because of the treatment. Therefore, it seems to indicate that the ubiquitous calpains are activated in physiological condition in this tissue. Even so, in all the tissues, incubation in the presence of Ca2+ led to a cleavage that was inhibited in the presence of MDL28170 (Fig. 4A, lanes b and c). To confirm the specificity of the reporter, we performed a similar experiment using a calpain inhibitor derived from calpastatin, the CP1B peptide (20Gil-Parrado S. Assfalg-Machleidt I. Fiorino F. Deluca D. Pfeiler D. Schaschke N. Moroder L. Machleidt W. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Inhibition of cleavage was obtained in a dose-dependent manner in the muscle tissue (Fig. 4B). Hence, we concluded that the reporter expressed in the CAFI model was readily and specifically cleavable by the ubiquitous calpains. We analyzed the FRET efficiency (FRETeff) in muscle at rest by two-photon confocal microscopy according to the method described under “Experimental Procedures.” A homogeneous FRETeff was observed between and among the fibers with a mean of 0.380 (Fig. 4C, upper panels). Then, we performed an intramuscular injection of Ca2+/ionomycin, a condition previously shown to induce calpain activation. Various FRETeff decreases were observed among the fibers, shown by the calculation of the FRETeff in ROI (ROI1 = 0.267 and ROI2 = 0.203; Fig. 4C, lower panels). A Western blot showed that about 40% of the reporter was effectively cleaved, consistent with the decrease of FRETeff (Fig. 4D). It is noted that when mice died during the experiment, a postmortem cleavage of the reporter was seen associated with a high decrease of FRETeff, stressing the importance of in vivo analysis when looking for physiological calpain activity. In Vivo Analysis of Calpain Activity—We analyzed calpain activity by monitoring the muscle of a living animal under various conditions where ubiquitous calpains are known to be upregulated or activated (21Belcastro A.N.

For the fasting experiment, CAFI mice were divided into three experimental groups: a control group, a group where the mice fasted for a 24-h period, and a group where the mice were refed for 6 h after the fasting period. The mean loss of weight after 24-h fasting was 16%, and the mice in the third group recovered half of the lost weight after the refeeding period. A small but statistically significant decrease of 3.6% in FRETeff was observed for both groups that underwent fasting compared with control (Table 1 and Fig. 5, panel a). For the denervation experiment, a chronic cut of the sciatic nerve was performed, and the mice were examined 4 and 14 days after the section. A change of 4.3 and 6.1% in FRETeff was observed at days 4 and 14, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. 5, panel b).TABLE 1Mean FRETeff ± S.D. for the number of ROI are presented for different in vivo protocolsFastingDenervationExerciseNotexinIschemiaFRETeff ± S.D.% Diff.pFRETeff ± S.D.% Diff.pFRETeff ± S.D.% Diff.pFRETeff ± S.D.% Diff.pFRETeff ± S.D.% Diff.pControl0.383 ± 0.0073--Control0.393 ± 0.0043--Control0.382 ± 0.0035--Control0.372 ± 0.0102--Control0.396 ± 0.0235--n = 39n = 32n = 33n = 29n = 60Fasting0.369 ± 0.0097−3.66<0.001D4 post-Den.0.376 ± 0.0047−4.330.0030h post-ex.0.342 ± 0.0248−10.42<0.001D4 post-Not.0.255 ± 0.0256−31.45<0.001Ischemia0.293 ± 0.0272−26.00.003n = 39n = 40n = 46n = 32n = 64Refed0.369 ± 0.0057−3.66<0.001D14 post-Den.0.369 ± 0.0023−6.11<0.00124h post-ex.0.354 ± 0.0076−7.33<0.001D7 post-Not.0.294 ± 0.0070−20.97<0.001n = 65n = 25n = 49n = 14D9 post-Not.0.366 ± 0.0080−1.610.327n = 16 Open table in a new tab Another protocol was performed where the mice were forced to run on a treadmill for 1 h. Muscles were observed immediately afterward and after a 24-h period. At both periods, a global 10% FRETeff decrease was detected (Table 1 and Fig. 5, panel c). In addition, we observed the appearance of structural anomalies in some fibers. Different phenotypes observed during this protocol are presented in Fig. 6. Most of the time, these disruptions of architecture present as a plugged density associated with a major FRETeff decrease only at one side of the anomaly (black and white arrowheads in Figs. 5, panel c and 6). Calpain activity was also followed up during degeneration and regeneration after notexin injury. Tibialis anterior (TA) muscles were examined 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9 days after injury. From day 0 to day 4, muscles were totally disorganized with fiber necrosis and infiltrates of mononucleated cells. At this stage, large black regions indicated loss of the fluorescence, probably corresponding to necrotic fibers (Fig. 5, panel d). In the remaining fibers, a massive loss of FRETeff occurred as shown by the solid red regions. In the following days, small regenerating myofibers appeared while mononucleated cells disappeared. At day 4, the mean FRETeff for treated samples showed a 31% decrease (Table 1 and Fig. 5, panel d). At day 7, the mean FRETeff was still low, and at day 9, the FRETeff had returned to a normal level with an apparently healthy muscle with remaining central nuclei (Table 1 and data not shown). Finally, we performed a kinetic analysis over2hof calpain activity during ischemia. We examined the consequence on the TA muscle after blockade of the blood flow with a femoral clamp. A decrease in FRETeff was noticed as soon as 45 min of ischemia (Table 1 and Fig. 5, panel e). A complete loss of FRETeff occurred after 130 min (data not shown). This loss of FRETeff was very homogeneous among the studied muscle with no apparent damage seen in the myofibers. Crossing of CAFI Mice with a Model of Muscular Dystrophy—An activation of the ubiquitous calpains, secondary to an increase in Ca2+ influx through leaky membranes, has been previously reported in the dystrophin-deficient mdx mice (2Spencer M.J. Croall D.E. Tidball J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10909-10914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 7Allen D.G. Whitehead N.P. Yeung E.W. J. Physiol. 2005; 567: 723-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis was also shown in the case of the BIO14.6 hamster deficient in δ-sarcoglycan, a member of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) (28Iwata Y. Katanosaka Y. Shijun Z. Kobayashi Y. Hanada H. Shigekawa M. Wakabayashi S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 70: 740-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that excess calpain activity would constitute a common pathophysiological mechanism in these DGC-related diseases. To analyze in vivo calpain activity in the context of muscular dystrophies, we crossed the CAFI model with a model deficient in α-sarcoglycan (Sgca-null mice). We named this model SARCAFI. The Sgca-null model"
https://openalex.org/W2069556266,"Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a signaling receptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but its interaction with MD-2 is required for efficient responses to LPS. Previous studies with deletion mutants indicate a critical role of the amino-terminal TLR4 region in interaction with MD-2. However, it is uncertain which region in the TLR4 molecule directly binds to MD-2. The purpose of this study was to determine a critical stretch of primary sequence in the TLR4 region that directly binds MD-2 and is critical for LPS signaling. The synthetic TLR4 peptide corresponding to the TLR4 region Glu24–Lys47 directly binds to recombinant soluble MD-2 (sMD-2). The TLR4 peptide inhibited the binding of a recombinant soluble form of the extracellular TLR4 domain (sTLR4) to sMD-2 and significantly attenuated LPS-induced NF-κB activation and IL-8 secretion in wild type TLR4-transfected cells. Reduction and S-carboxymethylation of sTLR4 abrogated its association with sMD-2. The TLR4 mutants, TLR4C29A, TLR4C40A, and TLR4C29A,C40A, were neither co-precipitated with MD-2 nor expressed on the cell surface and failed to transmit LPS signaling. These results demonstrate that the TLR4 region Glu24–Lys47 is a site for MD-2 binding and that Cys29 and Cys40 within this region are critical residues for MD-2 binding and LPS signaling. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a signaling receptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but its interaction with MD-2 is required for efficient responses to LPS. Previous studies with deletion mutants indicate a critical role of the amino-terminal TLR4 region in interaction with MD-2. However, it is uncertain which region in the TLR4 molecule directly binds to MD-2.

These results demonstrate that the TLR4 region Glu24–Lys47 is a site for MD-2 binding and that Cys29 and Cys40 within this region are critical residues for MD-2 binding and LPS signaling. The innate immune system protects against invasion of microorganisms as the first line of defense and stimulates the clonal responses of adaptive immunity (1Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway C.A.

Among the TLR family, TLR4 has been shown to play a critical role in recognition and signaling of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (3Chow J.C. Young D.W. Golenbock D.T. Christ W.J. Gusovsky F. J. Biol.

TLR4 is a type I membrane protein consisting of an extracellular domain that possesses a characteristic leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motif structure and an intracellular signaling domain.

Stimulation by LPS through TLR4 initiates an IL-1 receptor-like NF-κB signaling cascade, resulting in the production and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (3Chow J.C. Young D.W. Golenbock D.T.

TLR4 alone cannot transmit LPS signaling, and the interaction of TLR4 with MD-2 is required for transmission of LPS signals (6Shimazu R. Akahsi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). Thus, identification of a functional region of TLR4 that directly interacts with MD-2 is important to understand the mechanism of the regulation of LPS signaling. Recent studies from this and other laboratories (9Fujimoto T. Yamazaki S. Eto-Kimura A. Takeshige K. Muta T. J. Biol.

Commun. 2005; 328: 586-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have revealed that deletion of the amino-terminal TLR4 region abrogates the binding of TLR4 to MD-2 and that substitution of the amino-terminal TLR4 region for the TLR2 region confers the TLR2 chimera on the MD-2 binding activity, indicating that the amino-terminal TLR4 region is critical for the interaction with MD-2. However, it remains uncertain which region in the TLR4 molecule directly binds to MD-2. The purpose of this study was to determine the critical stretch of primary sequence of TLR4 that directly binds to MD-2 and regulates LPS signaling. We demonstrate that the TLR4 region Glu24–Lys47 is a site for MD-2 binding and that Cys29 and Cys40 within this region are critical for interaction with MD-2 and LPS signaling.

Anti-V5 tag polyclonal antibody was purchased from Medical & Biological Laboratories Corp. (Nagoya, Japan). Expression Vectors—The cDNAs for human TLR4 and human MD-2 were obtained as described previously (6Shimazu R. Akahsi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). TLR4-3×FLAG that contains the C-terminal fusion 3× FLAG tag was generated by using PCR and subcloned into p3×FLAG-CMV™-14 expression vector (Sigma). MD-2-V5-His that contains the C-terminal fusion V5 tag and His6 tag was generated by using PCR and subcloned into pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen). Recombinant Proteins—sTLR4 consisting of the putative extracellular domain (Met1–Lys631) and a His6 tag at the C-terminal end and a recombinant soluble form of MD-2 (sMD-2) containing a V5 tag and His6 tag (MD-2) were expressed by a baculovirus-insect cell expression system using the method described previously (11Hyakushima N.

Schematic representations of wild type (WT) TLR4, sTLR4, and sMD-2 are shown in Fig. 1A. Analysis of the amino-terminal sequence of sTLR4 reveals that this protein starts at Glu24 (11Hyakushima N.

The TLR4 mutant possessing a mutation at Pro714 → His (TLR4P714H) (8Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M.

Biotinylation of TLR Peptides—The TLR2 peptide and the TLR4 peptide were biotinylated with EZ-Link-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide-LC-Biotin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Binding of sMD-2 to TLR Peptides Coated onto Microtiter Wells—The TLR2 peptide or the TLR4 peptide (1 μg/ml, 50 μl/well) was coated into microtiter wells (Immulon 1B; Dynex). After nonspecific binding was blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% (w/v) skim milk and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (blocking buffer), the indicated concentrations of sMD-2 (50 μl/well) in the blocking buffer were added onto the wells and were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. MD-2 binding to the solid phase TLR peptide was detected by anti-V5 polyclonal antibody, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled anti-rabbit IgG. A peroxidase reaction was carried out by using o-phenylenediamine as a substrate, and the absorbance at 492 nm was measured. Pull-down Assay of Biotinylated TLR Peptide—The biotinylated peptide (1 μg) of TLR2 or TLR4 was incubated with or without sMD-2 (2.5 μg) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% fetal calf serum for 1 h at 37°C. Streptavidin-agarose beads were then added, and the mixture (500 μl) was further incubated for 1 h at 4°C. After the incubation, the agarose beads were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and the final pellets obtained were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was performed to detect sMD-2 that had co-precipitated with the biotinylated peptide by using anti-V5 polyclonal antibody. The proteins that reacted with the antibodies were visualized by using a Super Signal West Pico chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation of sMD-2—sMD-2 (1 μg) possessing the V5 tag was mixed with or without the biotinylated peptide of TLR4 or TLR2 (1 μg) and was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Anti-V5 antibody-conjugated agarose beads were then added into the reaction mixture, and the suspension was further incubated at 4 °C for 12 h. After the incubation, the agarose beads were washed, and the final pellets obtained were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was performed to detect the TLR peptides and MD-2 by using HRP-conjugated streptavidin and anti-V5 polyclonal antibody, respectively. Competition of the TLR Peptide with sTLR4 for sMD-2 Binding—sMD-2 (20 ng) was preincubated with or without the peptide of TLR4 or TLR2 (0.4, 2, and 10 μg), and the mixture of sMD-2 and the TLR peptide was further incubated with the sTLR4 (100 ng) at 37 °C for 1 h. Anti-V5 antibody-conjugated agarose beads were then added into the reaction mixture, and the suspension was further incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. After the incubation, the agarose beads were washed, and the final pellets obtained were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was performed to detect sTLR4 and MD-2 by using anti-sTLR4 monoclonal antibody (4D9) (11Hyakushima N. Mitsuzawa H. Nishitani C. Sano H. Kuronuma K. Konishi M. Himi T. Miyake K. Kuroki Y. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 6949-6954Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and anti-V5 polyclonal antibody, respectively. NF-κB Reporter Assay—Activation of NF-κB was measured as previously described (12Iwaki D. Mitsuzawa H. Murakami S. Sano H. Konishi M. Akino T. Kuroki Y. J. Biol.

The cells were transiently transfected by FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) with 30 ng of an NF-κB reporter construct (pNF-κB-Luc; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and 10 ng of a construct directing expression of Renilla luciferase (pRL-TK; Promega, Madison, WI), together with 160 ng of cDNA for TLR4. Thirty-six hours after transfection, the indicated concentrations of purified MD-2 were incubated for 6 h in the absence or the presence of 10 ng/ml LPS with HEK293 cells, and luciferase activity was measured by the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. In some experiments, sMD-2 (20 ng/ml) was preincubated with the indicated concentrations of the TLR2 peptide or the TLR4 peptide at 37 °C for 1 h before adding to the well. IL-8 Secretion—HEK293 cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates on the day before transfection. The cells were transiently transfected by FuGENE 6 transfection reagent with 200 ng of TLR4 cDNA. Thirty-six hours after transfection, the indicated concentrations of purified sMD-2 were incubated for 15 h in the absence or presence of 10 ng/ml LPS with HEK293 cells. After the LPS stimulation, concentrations of IL-8 secreted from HEK293 cells were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using an OptEIA™ human IL-8 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay set (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In some experiments, sMD-2 (100 ng/ml) was preincubated with the indicated concentrations of the TLR2 peptide or the TLR4 peptide at 37 °C for 1 h before adding to the well. Chemical Modifications of sTLR4—sTLR4 (70 μg/500 μl)) was treated with 20 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) for 2 h at room temperature, followed by treatment with 41.4 mm iodoacetate for 30 min in the dark. The reaction mixture containing the reduced and S-carboxymethylated sTLR4 was applied to a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) to separate the modified protein from DTT and iodoacetate. Binding of the Reduced and S-Carboxymethylated sTLR4—sMD-2 (20 ng) was incubated with or without sTLR4 (50 ng) or chemically modified sTLR4 at 37 °C for 30 min. Anti-V5 antibody-conjugated agarose beads were then added into the reaction mixture, and the suspension was further incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. After the incubation, agarose beads were washed, and the final pellets obtained were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was performed to detect sTLR4 and MD-2 by using anti-sTLR4 polyclonal antibody and anti-V5 polyclonal antibody, respectively. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting of Membrane-bound TLR—The 293T cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged TLR2, TLR4, or TLR4 mutants (12 μg cDNA) along with V5-tagged MD-2 (12 μg of cDNA) by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant with an empty vector. Forty hours after transfection, the cells were lysed with 20 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, and 2 mm Na3VO4 (lysis buffer) on ice for 15 min. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated agarose or anti-V5 antibody-conjugated agarose. Immunoprecipitates were washed and released by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer under reducing conditions. The protein samples were resolved by 7.5–15% SDS-PAGE and were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.). The membrane was then incubated with anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody or anti-V5 polyclonal antibody, followed by incubation with HRP-labeled anti-rabbit antibody. Flow Cytometry—The 293T cells were transfected with TLR4 or its mutants (TLR4C29A, TLR4C40A, TLR4C88A, or TLR4C29A,C40A)(2 μg of cDNA) with or without MD-2 (2 μgof cDNA) by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant with an empty vector. Forty hours after transfection, the cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with a phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-human TLR4 monoclonal antibody (eBioscience, San Diego, CA). Expression of cell surface TLR4 was analyzed by using FACSCalibular and CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Electrophoretic Analysis of Recombinant Proteins—sTLR4 and sMD-2 were produced in insect cells, and recombinant proteins were purified from the media by a column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads. The electrophoresis of purified proteins was performed under reducing and nonreducing conditions. The purified proteins of sTLR4 and sMD-2 exhibited apparent molecular masses of 80 and 23–30 kDa, respectively, under reducing conditions (Fig. 1B). sMD-2 migrated as monomeric and polymeric forms under nonreducing conditions. sTLR4 starts at Glu24, as described previously (11Hyakushima N. Mitsuzawa H. Nishitani C. Sano H. Kuronuma K. Konishi M. Himi T. Miyake K. Kuroki Y. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 6949-6954Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The Synthetic Peptide Corresponding to the TLR4 Region Glu24–Lys47 Directly Binds to sMD-2—Analysis with deletion mutants has revealed that the amino-terminal TLR4 region is critical for interaction with MD-2 (9Fujimoto T. Yamazaki S. Eto-Kimura A. Takeshige K. Muta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47431-47437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 10Nishitani C. Mitsuzawa H. Hyakushima N. Sano H. Matsushima N. Kuroki Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 586-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, it is uncertain which region in TLR4 molecule directly binds to MD-2. Thus, we generated the synthetic peptides corresponding to the amino-terminal TLR4 region of Glu24–Lys47 and the TLR2 region of Glu21–Ser45 (TLR4 peptide and TLR2 peptide, respectively) (Fig. 2A). We first investigated the direct interactions of sMD-2 with the synthetic peptides. When various concentrations of sMD-2 were incubated with the peptide coated onto the microtiter wells, sMD-2 bound to the solid phase TLR4 peptide in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). However, sMD-2 did not exhibit any significant binding to the TLR2 peptide. The results suggest that the amino-terminal TLR4 region of Glu24–Lys47 directly binds to sMD-2. The interactions of the TLR peptides with sMD-2 were also examined by a solution-phase assay. When biotinylated TLR peptide and sMD-2 were co-incubated and the biotinylated peptide was precipitated by pull-down assay with streptavidin-agarose beads, the biotinylated TLR4 peptide but not the TLR2 peptide co-precipitated sMD-2 (Fig. 2C). Conversely, when sMD-2 was immunoprecipitated after incubation with or without biotinylated TLR peptides, sMD-2 co-precipitated the TLR4 peptide but not the TLR2 peptide (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the synthetic peptide corresponding to the TLR4 region Glu24–Lys47 binds to sMD-2. The TLR4 Peptide Inhibits the Binding of sTLR4 to sMD-2—We next examined whether the TLR4 peptide competed with sTLR4 for sMD-2 binding. When sTLR4 and sMD-2 were co-incubated and sMD-2 was immunoprecipitated, sTLR4 was co-precipitated (Fig. 3, peptide, –), indicating direct binding of sTLR4 to sMD-2. The addition of the TLR4 peptide but not the TLR2 peptide decreased the amounts of sTLR4 co-precipitating with sMD-2 in a manner dependent upon the amounts of the TLR4 peptide added (Fig. 3, peptide, TLR2 and TLR4). Taken together with the results obtained from the direct peptide binding, these results support the conclusion that the TLR4 region of Glu24–Lys47 is a site for sMD-2 binding. The TLR4 Peptide Attenuates LPS-induced NF-κB Activation and IL-8 Secretion in TLR4-expressing Cells—The addition of sMD-2 elicited NF-κB activation and IL-8 secretion in response to 10 ng/ml LPS in TLR4-transfected HEK293 cells in a manner dependent upon the sMD-2 concentrations (Fig. 4, A and C). We next examined whether the TLR4 peptide affected LPS-induced NF-κB activation in TLR4-transfected HEK293 cells. The indicated concentrations of the TLR4 peptide or the TLR2 peptide that had been preincubated with sMD-2 (20 ng/ml) were further incubated with the cells in the presence of 10 ng/ml LPS. The TLR4 peptide but not the TLR2 peptide significantly attenuated LPS-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 4B). The TLR4 peptide at 40 μg/ml decreased LPS-elicited NF-κB activation by ∼45%. The addition of the TLR4 peptide that had been preincubated with sMD-2 (100 ng/ml) also significantly decreased IL-8 secretion from TLR4-transfected cells in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4D). These data indicate that the TLR4 peptide can down-regulate LPS-induced inflammation in TLR4-expressing cells. Reduction and S-Carboxymethylation of sTLR4 Abrogate Its Association with sMD-2—The extracellular TLR4 domain contains 16 cysteine residues, two (Cys29 and Cys40) of which exist in the amino-terminal region of Glu24–Lys47. To determine the importance of disulfide bonding in the binding of sTLR4 to sMD-2, sTLR4 was reduced with DTT, followed by S-carboxymethylation with iodoacetate. We then examined, by immunoprecipitation with sMD-2, whether the reduced and S-carboxymethylated sTLR4 was able to bind to sMD-2. Untreated sTLR4 co-precipitated with sMD-2 (Fig. 5). However, the reduced and S-carboxymethylated sTLR4 did not co-precipitate with sMD-2, indicating that the chemically modified sTLR4 fails to bind to sMD-2. Because analysis of sTLR4 with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) has revealed that there is no free thiol group in the extracellular TLR4 domain (data not shown), the present results suggest that the disulfide bonding in the TLR4 molecule is critical for its binding to MD-2. TLR4C29A, TLR4C40A, and TLR4C29A,C40A Fail to Associate with MD-2 and to Transmit LPS Signaling—Since reduction and S-carboxymethylation of sTLR4 abrogated its binding to sMD-2, we generated TLR4 mutants in which a cysteine residue was replaced with alanine and examined whether Cys → Ala mutation in TLR4 altered its ability to associate with MD-2. MD-2 cDNA and cDNA for TLR2, TLR4, or TLR4 mutant were co-transfected with 293T cells, and V5-tagged MD-2 was immunoprecipitated. The proteins of TLR2, TLR4, and TLR4 mutants as well as MD-2 protein were sufficiently expressed in all transfectants (Fig. 6A, IP: α-V5/WB: α-V5 and IP: α-FLAG/WB: α-FLAG). A significant amount of the WT TLR4 protein co-precipitated with MD-2 (Fig. 6A, IP: α-V5/WB: α-FLAG). However, MD-2 co-precipitated no protein of TLR4C29A, TLR4C40A, or TLR4C29A,C40A. The amount of TLR4C88A protein that co-precipitated with MD-2 was decreased, indicating that TLR4C88A impaired but retained some MD-2-binding activity. These results clearly demonstrate that cysteine residues of TLR4 at amino acids 29 and 40 are critical for MD-2 binding. We next examined whether the TLR4 mutants were able to induce NF-κB activation in response to LPS. HEK293 cells that had been transfected with MD-2 and WT TLR4 responded well to LPS (Fig. 6B). When the empty plasmid and TLR4P714H cDNA were transfected, no response to LPS was observed. LPS did not elicit significant NF-κB activation in the cells that had been transfected with WT TLR2, TLR4C29A, TLR4C40A, or TLR4C29A,C40A. TLR4C88A that showed weak association with MD-2 exhibited reduced but significant activation of NF-κBin response to LPS. These results correlate well with those obtained from co-precipitation with MD-2 (Fig. 6A). Neither TLR4C29A, TLR4C40A, nor TLR4C29A,C40A Is Expressed on Cell Surface—Since transport of TLR4 to the cell surface is closely related to the presence of MD-2 and their interactions (14Nagai Y. Akashi S. Nagafuku M. Ogata M. Iwakura Y. Akira S. Kitamura T. Kosugi A. Kimoto M. Miyake K. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar), we next examined the cell surface expression of TLR4 and its mutants (Fig. 7). The 293T cells had been transfected with TLR4 or its mutant with or without MD-2, and cell surface TLR4 was examined by flow cytometry. When WT TLR4 was transfected with or without MD-2, a significant amount of TLR4 was expressed on the cell surface. Co-expression with MD-2 slightly increased cell surface expression of TLR4 (Fig. 7B), albeit not significantly. However, neither TLR4C29A, TLR4C40A, nor TLR4C29A,C40A appeared on the cell surface even when co-transfected with MD-2. TLR4C88A was expressed on the cell surface only when co-transfected with MD-2. These results are consistent with those obtained from the MD-2 binding and LPS signaling (Fig. 6, A and B). Taken together, the results showing that TLR4C29A, TLR4C40A, or TLR4C29A,C40A is not localized on the cell surface support the conclusion that these mutants fail to bind to MD-2. Since previous studies with deletion mutants of TLR4 from this and other laboratories (9Fujimoto T. Yamazaki S. Eto-Kimura A. Takeshige K. Muta T. J. Biol.

In addition, the TLR4/2 chimera consisting of the TLR4 region Met1–Phe54 and the TLR2 region Ala53–Ser784 possesses the MD-2 binding property (10Nishitani C. Mitsuzawa H. Hyakushima N. Sano H.

MD-2 does not bind to TLR2 or CD14, both of which contain LRR structure like TLR4. Thus, we focused on the amino-terminal region containing no LRRs and generated the synthetic peptide corresponding to the amino-terminal TLR4 region Glu24–Lys47 and examined whether this peptide directly binds to MD-2. The solid phase binding study (see Fig. 2B) and the pull-down and immunoprecipitation studies (see Fig. 2, C and D) demonstrate the direct binding of the TLR4 peptide to MD-2. We have further shown that the TLR4 peptide competes with the extracellular TLR4 domain for MD-2 binding (see Fig. 3). Thus, it is possible to conclude that the TLR4 region of Glu24–Lys47 is a site for MD-2 binding. The TLR4 peptide but not the TLR2 peptide has been shown to down-regulate LPS-induced NF-κB activation and IL-8 secretion in the presence of sMD-2 in TLR4-transfected cells (see Fig. 4). It is likely that a complex formation of the TLR4 peptide and its interaction with sMD-2 may prevent sMD-2 from binding to WT TLR4 on the cell surface, resulting in the down-regulation of LPS signaling. A recent study (15Pugin J. Stem-Voeffray S. Daubeuf B. Matthay M.A. Elson G. Dunn-Siegrist I. Blood. 2004; 104: 4071-4079Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) has shown that plasma from patients with severe sepsis and septic shock contains soluble MD-2 that elicits LPS activation in TLR4-expressing epithelial cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Depletion of endogenous soluble MD-2 from human serum, with an immobilized TLR4-Fc fusion protein, abrogates TLR4-mediated LPS responses (16Visintin A. Halmen K.A. Latz E. B. Monke G. Golenbock D.T. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 6465-6472Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In addition, the purified TLR4-Fc fusion protein inhibits the interaction of MD-2 with TLR4, thus preventing LPS stimulation. The study proposes that the binding of TLR4-Fc to MD-2 can be utilized for drug therapy against endotoxin-induced disease. Since the TLR4 peptide is thought to inhibit TLR4-mediated LPS responses by a mechanism similar to that of TLR4-Fc fusion protein, it is possible to infer that the TLR4 peptide can also be used for dampening endotoxin-induced inflammation, with a high probability of realization, presumably due to its availability. Since the extracellular TLR4 domain contains 16 cysteine residues, we investigated the role of cysteine residues in its association with MD-2. The reduced and S-carboxymethylated sTLR4 did not co-precipitate with sMD-2 (see Fig. 5). Titration analysis with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) reveals that sTLR4 contains no free thiol group. Thus, this study indicates that the disulfide bonding is important for the binding of TLR4 to MD-2. The amino-terminal TLR4 region Glu24–Lys47 contains Cys29 and Cys40, and the TLR4 mutants, TLR4C29A, TLR4C40A, and TLR4C29A,C40A, fail to associate with MD-2 and to transmit LPS signaling (see Fig. 6). These mutants are not expressed on the cell surface (see Fig. 7). Glycoprotein Ibα (GPIbα) is a member of LRR proteins, and its amino-terminal sequence is similar to that of TLR4 (17Uff S. Clements J.M. Harrison T. Clemetson K.J. Emsley J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35657-35663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). This protein possesses the amino-terminal β-hairpin that has two anti-parallel strands with a disulfide bridge (Cys4–Cys17) at the base. A structure homology search indicates that GPIbα also shows greatest similarity with TLR3 (18Bell J.K. Botos I. Hall P.R. Askins J. Shiloach J. Segal D.M. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10976-10980Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 20Huizinga E.G. Tsuji S. Romijn R.A. Schiphorst M.E. de Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. Gros P. Science. 2002; 297: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). TLR3 contains a hairpin loop anchored by a disulfide bond between Cys28 and Cys38 (18Bell J.K. Botos I. Hall P.R. Askins J. Shiloach J. Segal D.M. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10976-10980Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Although we have not determined whether Cys29 and Cys40 of TLR4 form a disulfide bridge, it is likely that these two cysteine residues are strongly involved in MD-2 binding, since the hairpin is a ligand binding site of GPIbα (21Matsushima N. Enkhbayar P. Kamiya M. Osaki M. Kretsinger R.H. Drug Des. Rev. 2005; 2: 305-322Google Scholar). The TLR4 mutants, TLR4C29A, TLR4C40A, and TLR4C29A,C40A, were not expressed on the cell surface (see Fig. 7). This is consistent with the result showing that these mutants do not possess the ability to bind MD-2 (see Fig. 6A). TLR4C88A retains weak ability to bind MD-2 and is expressed on the cell surface only when transfected with MD-2. Consistently, LPS signaling mediated by this mutant is quite weak but nonetheless significant. These results are reasonable, since interaction with MD-2 has been shown to be critical for correct intracellular distribution of TLR4 and LPS responsiveness (14Nagai Y. Akashi S. Nagafuku M. Ogata M. Iwakura Y. Akira S. Kitamura T. Kosugi A. Kimoto M. Miyake K. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). WT TLR4 and TLR4C88A, which are expressed on the cell surface, exhibit highly glycosylated forms, whereas TLR4C29A, TLR4C40A, or TLR4C29A,C40A that is not expressed on the cell surface does not contain a highly glycosylated band (see Fig. 6A; IP: α-FLAG, WB: α-FLAG). A mature form of full-length TLR4 containing the upper minor band, which is an endoglycosidase H-resistant form of carbohydrate chains, is localized on cell surface when it is co-expressed with MD-2 (9Fujimoto T. Yamazaki S. Eto-Kimura A. Takeshige K. Muta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47431-47437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Immature TLR4 is suggested to be glycosylated in the endoplasmic reticulum but does not reach the medial Golgi compartment, where glycosylation of endoglycosidase H-resistant carbohydrate occurs. Thus, the present data suggest that TLR4C29A, TLR4C40A, and TLR4C29A,C40A are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and are not processed to a mature form of the highly glycosylated protein. In this study, we have shown that the amino-terminal TLR4 region of Glu24–Lys47 containing no LRRs directly binds to MD-2. Lipid A interacts with a cell surface receptor complex of TLR4 and MD-2 with higher affinity than with MD-2 alone or CD14 alone when expressed on the cell surface (22Akashi S. Saitoh S. Wakabayashi Y. Kikuchi T. Takamura N. Nagai Y. Kusumoto Y. Fukase K. Kusumoto S. Adachi Y. Kusugi A. Miyake K. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). It remains unknown how the receptor complex of TLR4 and MD-2 interacts with LPS. Although an answer to this question may have to await analysis of the receptor complex with crystal structure, it is possible to assume that the LRR motif of TLR4 is still available for interaction with LPS, since only the short segment of the amino-terminal TLR4 region is used for the MD-2 binding. The crystal structure of human TLR3 ectodomain reveals a large, horseshoe-shaped solenoid assembled from 23 LRRs (23Choe J. Kelker M. Wilson I.A. Science. 2005; 309: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Two patches of positively charged residues and a TLR3-specific LRR insertion in the LRR motifs have been suggested to provide an appropriate binding site for its ligand, double-stranded RNA. In conclusion, the TLR4 region Glu24–Lys47 is a site for MD-2 binding. Cysteine residues at amino acids 29 and 40 within this region are critical for the interaction of TLR4 with MD-2 and LPS signaling. We thank Dr. Kensuke Miyake (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan) for providing cDNAs for human TLR4 and human MD-2."
https://openalex.org/W2015278341,"Proline- and acid-rich (PAR) basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins thyrotroph embryonic factor (TEF), D-site-binding protein (DBP), and hepatic leukemia factor have been involved in neurotransmitter homeostasis and amino acid metabolism. Here we demonstrate a novel role for these proteins in the transcriptional control of a BH3-only gene. PAR bZIP proteins are able to transactivate the promoter of bcl-gS. This promoter is particularly responsive to TEF activation and is silenced by NFIL3, a repressor that shares the consensus binding site with PAR bZIP proteins. Consistently, transfection of TEF induces the expression of endogenous bcl-gS in cancer cells, and this induction is independent of p53. A naturally occurring variant of DBP (tDBP), lacking the transactivation domain, has been identified and shown to impede the formation of active TEF dimers in a competitive manner and to reduce the TEF-dependent induction of bcl-gS. Of note, treatment of cancer cells with etoposide induces TEF activation and promotes the expression of bcl-gS. Furthermore, blockade of bcl-gS or TEF expression by a small interfering RNA strategy or transfection with tDBP significantly reduces the etoposide-mediated apoptotic cell death. These findings represent the first described role for PAR bZIP proteins in the regulation of a gene involved in the execution of apoptosis."

Attachment of a GPI anchor occurs rapidly upon completion of protein translation and translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, and involves replacement of the C-terminal GPI-directing signal sequence in the proprotein with a preformed GPI anchor. More than 20 different ER membrane proteins are required for synthesizing the GPI lipid and attaching it to target proteins (3Kinoshita T. Inoue N. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 4Eisenhaber B. Maurer-Stroh S. Novatchkova M. Schneider G. Eisenhaber F.

GPI biosynthesis (Fig. 1A) is initiated on the cytoplasmic face of the ER by a multisubunit enzyme that transfers N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) from UDP-GlcNAc to phosphatidylinositol (PI) (7Doering T.L.

Commun. 2005; 2005: 453-455Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). GlcNAc-PI is then de-N-acetylated and, in mammalian cells and yeast, inositol acylated to yield GlcN-acyl-PI. GlcN-acyl-PI is elaborated by addition of mannose and ethanolaminephosphate (EtN-P) residues that are contributed by the lipids dolichol-P-mannose and phosphatidylethanolamine, respectively (11Menon A.K. Mayor S. Schwarz R.T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4249-4258Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 15Imhof I. Canivenc-Gansel E. Meyer U. Conzelmann A. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 1271-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The mannose and EtN-P transfer reactions are presumed to occur in the lumenal leaflet of the ER. The complete GPI structures that are generated by this pathway in mammals contain 3 (occasionally 4) mannose residues and 2–3 EtN-P residues. Modification of the 6-OH of the third mannose residue (Man3) with EtN-P, as seen in the GPI anchor precursors H7 and H8 (16Hirose S. Prince G.M. Sevlever D. Ravi L. Rosenberry T.L. Ueda E. Medof M.E.

Modification of the 2-OH of the first mannose residue (Man1) with EtN-P (catalyzed by PIG-N/Mcd4p) is essential in yeast (18Gaynor E.C. Mondésert G. Grimme S.J. Reed S.I. Orlean P. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 627-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 20Wiedman J.M. Fabre A.L. Taron B.W. Taron C.H. Orlean P. FEMS Yeast Res. 2006; Google Scholar) possibly because of a preference of the third mannosyltransferase (PIG-B/Gpi10p) for an EtN-P-modified GPI substrate. This EtN-P is also important in mammalian cells to generate a full complement of cell-surface-expressed GPI-anchored proteins (21Hong Y. Maeda Y. Watanabe R. Ohishi K. Mishkind M. Riezman H. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35099-35106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). GPI transamidase (GPIT), the enzyme that catalyzes the attachment of GPI to protein, is a penta-subunit complex consisting of the membrane proteins (in mammals) GPI8, GAA1, PIG-S, PIG-T, and PIG-U (22Hamburger D. Egerton M. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 629-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 28Hong Y. Ohishi K. Kang J.Y. Tanaka S. Inoue N. Nishimura J. Maeda Y. Kinoshita T. Mol. Biol.

In the first step of the GPIT-catalyzed reaction, the GPI signal sequence is cleaved and the newly generated α-carbonyl group is attached via a thioester linkage to the GPI8 subunit of GPIT. Nucleophilic attack on the activated carbonyl by the amino group of the terminal EtN-P residue of GPI regenerates GPIT and yields a GPI-anchored protein (29Mayor S. Menon A.K. Cross G.A.M. J.

While the GPI signal sequence has been extensively analyzed biochemically as well as by bioinformatics approaches (32Moran P. Raab H. Kohr W.J. Caras I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1250-1257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Bohme U. Cross G.A.M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 805-816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), very little is known about the structural features of the GPI lipid substrate that enable its recognition by GPIT. In an effort to shed light on this problem, we considered the following three questions. (i) Is the terminal EtN-P required for GPI interaction with GPIT? (ii) Can GPI biosynthetic intermediates bind GPIT? (iii) What is the minimal GPI structure recognized by GPIT? To answer these questions we made use of our ability to co-precipitate GPIs (metabolically radiolabeled with [2-3H]mannose in HeLa cells) with epitope-tagged human GPIT complexes (36Vainauskas S. Menon A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6540-6545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We used GPI biosynthesis inhibitors to generate a spectrum of radiolabeled GPI biosynthetic intermediates in situ and assayed whether these different lipids could be co-precipitated with human GPIT complexes. We also reconstituted the binding interaction between GPIs and GPIT, enabling us to test the ability of human GPIT to interact with non-mammalian GPIs that lack the side-chain modifications characteristic of GPIs seen in mammalian cells. Our results show that the EtN-P residue linked to Man1 is a major feature of the GPI structure that is recognized by human GPIT, while the EtN-P linked to Man3 and the trimannosyl core itself are relatively unimportant. Thus human GPIT is able to bind the minimal GPI structure EtN-P-2Manα1–4GlcN-acyl-PI (lipid H5; Fig. 1). The implications of these data are discussed.

Immunoprecipitations and Immunoblots—HeLa cells (1–2 × 107 cells) were processed 48 h after being transfected with cDNAs encoding epitope-tagged GPIT subunits. The cells were scraped off the culture dish, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 1 ml of MSB buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 200 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) digitonin and 1× protease inhibitor mixture set I (Calbiochem)) and incubated on ice for 60 min. The cell lysate was clarified by medium speed centrifugation (20 min, 10,000 × g, 4 °C), and the resulting supernatant was ultracentrifuged (45 min, 100,000 × g (43,000 rpm, TLA-100.3 rotor), 4 °C) to generate a clear detergent extract. Extracts were treated with 30 μl of slurry of anti-FLAG- and/or anti-V5-coated agarose beads at 4 °C for 4 h with gentle agitation. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation for 15 s at 10,000 × g and washed with MSB buffer (4 × 1.5 ml).

Radiolabeled GPIs were identified by their sensitivity to GPI-specific phospholipase D (GPI-PLD) and jack bean α-mannosidase (Jbαm) and by co-migration with previously characterized GPIs on thin layer chromatograms. Chromatograms were visualized by scanning using a Berthold LB2842 TLC Linear Analyzer. Enzyme treatments were done as follows. For treatment with Jbαm, extracts containing [3H]mannose-labeled GPIs were dried, dissolved in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, 0.5% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, and treated with 2 units of Jbαm (Sigma) overnight at 37 °C. For treatment with GPI-PLD, radiolabeled GPIs were dried, dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3mm CaCl2, 0.1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, and treated with 10% (w/v) fetal bovine serum (a source of GPI-PLD) overnight at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation with Jbαm or GPI-PLD, samples were extracted with n-butyl alcohol. The n-butyl alcohol extracts were washed repeatedly with n-butyl alcohol-saturated water before being taken for TLC analysis on silica 60 thin layer plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) using chloroform/methanol/water (10:10:3, by volume) as the solvent system.

Two days post-transfection cells (∼1 × 107) were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped off the culture dish, resuspended in 0.4 ml of labeling buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 15 mm MgCl2, 15 mm MnCl2, 3 mm ATP, 1 mm UDP-GlcNAc) with 1.5 μg/ml digitonin, 0.2 μg/ml tunicamycin, and 10 μCi of GDP-[3H]mannose (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc., St. Louis, MO), and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C. After labeling, digitonin was added to a final concentration of 1% (w/v), and the cells were solubilized on ice for 60 min. The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation and subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG beads as described above. GPI extraction and analysis was done as described above. Synthesis of [3H]GlcNAc-PI in a Cell-free System—Microsomes of CHO K1 0.85 (PIG-L– mutant) cells (∼1.5 × 107) were incubated with 5 μCi of UDP-[3H]GlcNAc for 45 min at 37 °C to generate [3H]GlcNAc-PI as described previously (38Stevens V.L.

The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation as described above and the clear detergent extract was treated with anti-FLAG-agarose slurry at 4 °C for 4 h. The resin was recovered by centrifugation, washed with MSB buffer containing 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40 (4 × 1.5 ml), then with MSB containing 0.5% (w/v) digitonin (2 × 1 ml), and finally resuspended in MSB containing 0.5% (w/v) digitonin. Metabolic labeling of HeLa cells with d-[2-3H]mannose was done as described above. Lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol/water (10:10:3 by volume). The chloroform/methanol/water extracts were dried and desalted by partitioning between n-butyl alcohol -saturated water and water-saturated n-butyl alcohol. The n-butyl alcohol phase containing [3H]mannose-labeled GPIs was dried, and the residue was dissolved initially in MSB buffer containing 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, then diluted with detergent-free MSB to obtain a final concentration of 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100. A similar procedure was followed to obtain a solution of in vitro synthesized [3H]GlcNAc-PI in MSB containing 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100. [3H]Mannose-labeled GPIs (termed PP1 and PP3) from insect-stage Trypanosoma brucei were generated by incubating trypanosome membranes with GDP-[3H]mannose and non-labeled UDP-GlcNAc as described (39Field M.C.

Radiolabeled GPIs (∼30,000 cpm in 3 μl of MSB containing 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100) were added to 50 μl of anti-FLAG bead slurry (in MSB buffer with 0.5% digitonin) with bound GPIT complexes. The mixture was incubated for 25 min at room temperature, then 0.5 ml of MSB with 0.5% digitonin was added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 10 min. The bead-bound immunoprecipitates were washed with MSB buffer containing 0.5% digitonin (5 × 1 ml), then aliquoted for immunoblotting and GPI extraction. The GPI structures discussed in this paper are illustrated schematically in Fig. 1B. Specific Co-immunoprecipitation of GPIs with Human GPIT—We previously showed that the GPI anchor precursor H8 could be co-immunoprecipitated with detergent-solubilized human GPIT complexes (36Vainauskas S. Menon A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6540-6545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These results were obtained by transiently expressing functional, epitope-tagged subunits of human GPIT in HeLa cells, then metabolically radiolabeling the cells with [2-3H]mannose in the presence of tunicamycin to generate radiolabeled GPIs in situ. After labeling, the cells were lysed in digitonin-containing buffer and GPIT complexes were immunoprecipitated. The immunoprecipitate (GPIT IP) was washed in digitonin-containing buffer before being extracted with organic solvents to solubilize co-precipitated lipids. Nonimmunoprecipitated material (post-IP supernatant) was extracted in parallel. The organic solvent extracts were desalted and analyzed by TLC to identify [3H]mannose-labeled GPIs. TLC profiles from a typical experiment (Fig. 2) show that of the many [3H]mannose-labeled GPIs evident in the cell extract (upper panel; post-IP supernatant), only H8 is significantly co-precipitated with GPIT (lower panel; GPIT IP). M4-H8, 3This lipid was identified as M4-H8 by showing 1) that it is converted to H8 upon Jbαm treatment and 2) that yields of the [3H]mannose-labeled lipid are significantly higher in HeLa cells that overexpress the human Smp3 protein (the mannosyltransferase that transfers the fourth mannose reside in the GPI structure (41Taron B.W.

A similar structure has been reported previously (21Hong Y. Maeda Y. Watanabe R. Ohishi K. Mishkind M. Riezman H. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35099-35106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). a minor GPI species corresponding to H8 with an additional α-linked mannose residue (Fig. 1), is also recovered in the GPIT IP but at a lower level than H8. In contrast, the [3H]mannose-labeled GPIs H4 and H3 (Fig. 1) are not detected in the GPIT IP. These structures are completely de-mannosylated on treatment with the exoglycosidase Jbαm, consistent with the absence of any EtN-P (or other) substitutions of the mannose core. Thus mature GPI structures (H8, and to a lesser extent, M4-H8) are “pulled down” with GPIT in the immunoprecipitation assay, whereas GPIs lacking EtN-P altogether are not. Many GPI-anchors found on mammalian proteins resemble H7 (which has two EtN-P groups, one linked to the first mannose and another to the third mannose of the GPI glycan (Fig. 1B)) rather than H8. Thus we were interested to see whether H7 interacts with GPIT. In HeLa cells, H8 is the main GPI species generated during metabolic radiolabeling with [3H]mannose (Fig. 2A), and levels of radiolabeled H7 are typically too low to test in GPIT co-precipitation experiments. We were able to generate readily detectable levels of H7 by growing HeLa cells in the presence of the aminoglycoside G418 (42Gupta D. Tartakoff A. Tisdale E. Science. 1988; 242: 1446-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). G418 treatment alters the profile of metabolically radiolabeled GPIs, increasing the levels of H7 without significantly decreasing the level of H8. HeLa cells were grown in medium containing G418 (0.75 mg/ml) for 5 days. The cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding epitope-tagged GPIT subunits, metabolically labeled with [2-3H]-mannose, and processed as described above to immunoprecipitate GPIT. Lipid extraction and TLC analysis of the GPIT IP showed that both H7 and H8 were present in the immunoprecipitated complexes (data not shown) indicating that both H7 and H8 are able to interact with GPIT. Although the pulldown assay provides only a semiquantitative assessment of GPI interaction with GPIT, clear distinctions can nevertheless be made between the ability of different GPIs to be recognized by the enzyme (Fig. 2). Thus M4-H8 is less well recognized than H8 (recovery of M4-H8 in the IP versus post-IP extracts is ∼2-fold lower than that of H8 (Fig. 2)), and H4 and H3 do not bind GPIT at all. The pulldown assay is also highly specific. We previously showed that GPIT complexes containing a non-functional GAA1 subunit do not pull down H8 (36Vainauskas S. Menon A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6540-6545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This observation pointed to a role for GAA1 in GPI recognition by GPIT and also served as a specificity control for the pulldown assay. The results described above further document the specificity of the assay since not all GPIs are pulled down with wild-type GPIT. The Terminal EtN-P Residue Is Not Required for GPI Recognition by Human GPIT—GPIT transfers “complete” GPIs, like H8 and H7, to ER-translocated proteins that display a signal sequence for GPI anchor attachment. These complete GPIs are characterized by the presence of a capping EtN-P residue linked to the 6-OH of Man3. The amino group of the EtN-P cap ultimately participates in the amide bond that links the GPI structure to the ω amino acid of the target protein. Because of its direct role in GPI anchoring we speculated that the EtN-P cap would be a critical feature of GPIs recognized by GPIT. This speculation is consistent with the data presented in Fig. 2 that indicate that trimannosylated GPIs (H3 and H4) lacking EtN-P altogether are not recognized by GPIT. We wanted to refine our approach to this question by asking whether a fully mannosylated GPI lacking the EtN-P cap but possessing EtN-P residues elsewhere could be recognized by GPIT in our pulldown assay. To do this we took advantage of the fact that 1,10-phenanthroline (PNT), a commonly used membrane-permeant inhibitor of metalloproteases, is an effective inhibitor of GPI EtN-P transferases in mammalian cells (43Mann K.J. Sevlever D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40 (Erratum in Biochemistry40, 3758): 1205-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As reported previously, inclusion of 250 μm PNT in the culture medium, while metabolically labeling HeLa cells with [2-3H]mannose, blocked production of radiolabeled H8 and caused the accumulation of [3H]mannose-labeled H6, a trimannosylated GPI intermediate with only one EtN-P residue linked to Man1 (Fig. 3A; compare with the lipid profile shown in Fig. 2A). A species corresponding to M4-H6 was also labeled, as were the Jbαm-sensitive lipids H4, H3, and H2. The identity of H6 and M4-H6 was confirmed by diagnostic enzymatic treatments. Both H6 and M4-H6 were completely hydrolyzed by GPI-PLD, and after treatment with Jbαm, both lipids were converted to a radiolabeled species that co-migrated with H5 by TLC analysis (data not shown). HeLa cells expressing epitope-tagged variants of all five GPIT subunits were labeled with [2-3H]mannose in the presence of 250 μm PNT. After labeling, the cells were lysed in digitonin-containing buffer, and GPIT complexes were recovered from the digitonin extract by immunoprecipitation. TLC analysis of the organic solvent extract of the GPIT IP shows that both H6 and M4-H6 are co-immuoprecipitated with GPIT complexes while H4, H3, and H2 are not. This result clearly shows that the EtN-P cap of complete GPI anchor precursors is not required for GPI recognition by GPIT. We previously described a point mutant of human GAA1 (GAA1(P609L)) that interacts with other GPIT subunits to form a non-functional GPIT complex (36Vainauskas S. Menon A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6540-6545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). GAA1(P609L)-containing GPIT complexes bind proproteins but do not bind H8. These non-functional complexes similarly do not interact with H6 (data not shown), suggesting that both H6 and H8 interact with GPIT in the same way. EtN-P-containing GPIs with an Incomplete Glycan Core Are Recognized by GPIT—To test whether EtN-P-containing GPI intermediates with an incomplete glycan core structure can be recognized by human GPIT, we used mannosamine (ManN) to inhibit GPI biosynthesis. ManN inhibits in vivo GPI anchoring of proteins in a variety of cell types by preventing addition of the third mannose to the core glycan of GPI (44Lisanti M.P. Field M.C. Caras I.W. Menon A.K. Rodriguez-Boulan E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1969-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 48Ralton J.E. Milne K.G. Guther M.L. Field R.A. Ferguson M.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24183-24189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which ManN inhibits GPI biosynthesis is not entirely clear. It has been proposed that it acts as a chain terminator once it is incorporated into the GPI structure; alternatively, ManN has been proposed to be an inhibitor of the third GPI-mannosyltransferase. HeLa cells expressing epitope-tagged GPIT subunits were preincubated with 10 mm ManN and then metabolically labeled with [2-3H]mannose in the continued presence of 10 mm ManN. Cells were lysed in digitonin-containing buffer, and GPIT IP and post-IP supernatant fractions were generated and analyzed. TLC analysis of the post-IP supernatant revealed a major radiolabeled species (termed MN) that migrated faster than H6 (Rf(MN) ∼0.65 versus Rf(H6) ∼0.6) (Fig. 3C) and another, slower moving lipid species termed MN1. Both MN and MN1 could be quantitatively hydrolyzed by GPI-PLD indicating that they are GPIs (Fig. 3E). MN1 was resistant to Jbαm, whereas MN was partially degraded to a product that co-migrated with H5 by TLC (Fig. 3E). These data suggest that MN has the structure ManN-(EtN-P)Man-GlcN-acyl-PI, (Fig. 1B) consistent with previous proposals (45Pan Y.T. Kamitani T. Bhuvaneswaran C. Hallaq Y. Warren C.D. Yeh E.T.H. Elbein A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21250-21255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Ralton J.E. Milne K.G. Guther M.L. Field R.A. Ferguson M.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24183-24189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The exact structure of MN1 remains to be determined. The properties of MN1 (mobility on TLC comparable with that of H7 and resistance to Jbαm) suggest that it could have the structure ManN-Man-Man-GlcN-acyl-PI with EtN-P residues on the terminal ManN and the first mannose. Both MN and MN1 were present in the GPIT IP (Fig. 3D), indicating that they are recognized by GPIT. We conclude that EtN-P-containing GPIs with an incomplete or altered glycan core are recognized by GPIT. A Minimal EtN-P-containing GPI Is Recognized by Human GPIT—Since GPIT can bind incomplete EtN-P-containing GPIs such as H6 and MN, but not other incomplete structures such as H4, H3, and H2 that lack EtN-P (Figs. 2 and 3, A and B), we wondered if GPIT c"
