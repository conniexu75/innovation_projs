https://openalex.org/W2071075259,"The 14-3-3 family of proteins mediates signal transduction by binding to phosphoserine-containing proteins. Using phosphoserine-oriented peptide libraries to probe all mammalian and yeast 14-3-3s, we identified two different binding motifs, RSXpSXP and RXY/FXpSXP, present in nearly all known 14-3-3 binding proteins. The crystal structure of 14-3-3ζ complexed with the phosphoserine motif in polyoma middle-T was determined to 2.6 Å resolution. The bound peptide is in an extended conformation, with a tight turn created by the pS +2 Pro in a cis conformation. Sites of peptide–protein interaction in the complex rationalize the peptide library results. Finally, we show that the 14-3-3 dimer binds tightly to single molecules containing tandem repeats of phosphoserine motifs, implicating bidentate association as a signaling mechanism with molecules such as Raf, BAD, and Cbl."

https://openalex.org/W2048466060,"We have characterized a mammalian homolog of the Drosophila period gene and designated it Per2. The PER2 protein shows >40% amino acid identity to the protein of another mammalian per homolog (designated Per1) that was recently cloned and characterized. Both PER1 and PER2 proteins share several regions of homology with the Drosophila PER protein, including the protein dimerization PAS domain. Phylogenetic analysis supports the existence of a family of mammalian per genes. In the mouse, Per1 and Per2 RNA levels exhibit circadian rhythms in the SCN and eyes, sites of circadian clocks. Both Per1 and Per2 RNAs in the SCN are increased by light exposure during subjective night but not during subjective day. The results advance our knowledge of candidate clock elements in mammals."

https://openalex.org/W2007863157,"The requirement for transcription during long-lasting synaptic plasticity has raised the question of whether the cellular unit of synaptic plasticity is the soma and its nucleus or the synapse. To address this question, we cultured a single bifurcated Apylsia sensory neuron making synapses with two spatially separated motor neurons. By perfusing serotonin onto the synapses made onto one motor neuron, we found that a single axonal branch can undergo long-term branch-specific facilitation. This branch-specific facilitation depends on CREB-mediated transcription and involves the growth of new synaptic connections exclusively at the treated branch. Branch-specific long-term facilitation requires local protein synthesis in the presynaptic but not the postsynaptic cell. In fact, presynaptic sensory neuron axons deprived of their cell bodies are capable of protein synthesis, and this protein synthesis is stimulated 3-fold by exposure to serotonin."
https://openalex.org/W2086538740,"Hirschsprung disease (HSCR, MIM #142623) is a multigenic neurocristopathy (neural crest disorder) characterized by absence of enteric ganglia in a variable portion of the distal colon. Subsets of HSCR individuals also present with neural crest-derived melanocyte deficiencies (Hirschsprung-Waardenburg, HSCR-WS, MIM #277580). Murine models have been instrumental in the identification and analysis of HSCR disease genes. These include mice with deficiencies of endothelin B receptor (Ednrb(s-l); refs 1,2) endothelin 3 (Edn3(ls): refs 1,3) the tyrosine kinase receptor cRet and glial-derived neurotrophic factor. Another mouse model of HSCR disease, Dom, arose spontaneously at the Jackson Laboratory. While Dom/+ heterozygous mice display regional deficiencies of neural crest-derived enteric ganglia in the distal colon, Dom/Dom homozygous animals are embryonic lethal. We have determined that premature termination of Sox10, a member of the SRY-like HMG box family of transcription factors, is responsible for absence of the neural crest derivatives in Dom mice. We demonstrate expression of Sox10 in normal neural crest cells, disrupted expression of both Sox10 and the HSCR disease gene Ednrb in Dom mutant embryos, and loss of neural crest derivatives due to apoptosis. Our studies suggest that Sox10 is essential for proper peripheral nervous system development. We propose SOX10 as a candidate disease gene for individuals with HSCR whose disease does not have an identified genetic origin."

https://openalex.org/W1980830316,"We demonstrate that the alpha6beta4 integrin promotes carcinoma invasion through a preferential and localized targeting of phosphoinositide-3 OH kinase (PI3K) activity. Stable expression of alpha6beta4 increased carcinoma invasion in a PI3K-dependent manner, and transient expression of a constitutively active PI3K increased invasion in the absence of alpha6beta4. Ligation of alpha6beta4 stimulated significantly more PI3K activity than ligation of beta1 integrins, establishing specificity among integrins for PI3K activation. Alpha6beta4-regulated PI3K activity was required for the formation of lamellae, dynamic sites of motility, in carcinoma cells. The small G protein Rac is required downstream of PI3K for invasion. These studies define a mechanism by which the alpha6beta4 integrin promotes carcinoma invasion and invoke a novel function for PI3K signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2086386772,"Excess excitatory amino acids can provoke neuronal death in the hippocampus, and the extracellular proteases tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasmin (ogen) have been implicated in this death. To investigate substrates for plasmin that might influence neuronal degeneration, extracellular matrix (ECM) protein expression was examined. Laminin is expressed in the hippocampus and disappears after excitotoxin injection. Laminin disappearance precedes neuronal death, is spatially coincident with regions that exhibit neuronal loss, and is blocked by either tPA-deficiency or infusion of a plasmin inhibitor, both of which also block neuronal degeneration. Preventing neuron-laminin interaction by infusion of anti-laminin antibodies into tPA-deficient mice restores excitotoxic sensitivity to their hippocampal neurons. These results indicate that disruption of neuron-ECM interaction via tPA/plasmin catalyzed degradation of laminin sensitizes hippocampal neurons to cell death."

https://openalex.org/W2120213194,"Sine oculis (so) and eyes absent (eya) are required for Drosophila eye development and are founding members of the mammalian Six and Eya gene families. These genes have been proposed to act with eyeless (Pax6) to regulate eye development in vertebrates and invertebrates. so encodes a highly diverged homeobox transcription factor and eya encodes a novel nuclear protein. We demonstrate that So and Eya (1) regulate common steps in eye development including cell proliferation, patterning, and neuronal development; (2) synergize in inducing ectopic eyes; and (3) interact in yeast and in vitro through evolutionarily conserved domains. We propose that an So/Eya complex regulates multiple steps in eye development and functions within the context of a network of genes to specify eye tissue identity."
https://openalex.org/W1992111877,"Netrin-1 is known to function as a chemoattractant for several classes of developing axons and as a chemorepellent for other classes of axons, apparently dependent on the receptor type expressed by responsive cells. In culture, growth cones of embryonic Xenopus spinal neurons exhibited chemoattractive turning toward the source of netrin-1 but showed chemorepulsive responses in the presence of a competitive analog of cAMP or an inhibitor of protein kinase A. Both attractive and repulsive responses were abolished by depleting extracellular calcium and by adding a blocking antibody against the netrin-1 receptor Deleted in Colorectal Cancer. Thus, nerve growth cones may respond to the same guidance cue with opposite turning behavior, dependent on other coincident signals that set the level of cytosolic cAMP."

https://openalex.org/W1966846060,"Glutamate transporters in the CNS are expressed in neurons and glia and mediate high affinity, electrogenic uptake of extracellular glutamate. Although glia have the highest capacity for glutamate uptake, the amount of glutamate that reaches glial membranes following release and the rate that glial transporters bind and sequester transmitter is not known. We find that stimulation of Schaffer collateral/commissural fibers in hippocampal slices evokes glutamate transporter currents in CA1 astrocytes that activate rapidly, indicating that a significant amount of transmitter escapes the synaptic cleft shortly after release. Transporter currents in outside-out patches from astrocytes have faster kinetics than synaptically elicited currents, suggesting that the glutamate concentration attained at astrocytic membranes is lower but remains elevated for longer than in the synaptic cleft."
https://openalex.org/W2065178022,"Postsynaptic sensitivity to glutamate was genetically manipulated at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) to test whether postsynaptic activity can regulate presynaptic function during development. We cloned the gene encoding a second muscle-specific glutamate receptor, DGluRIIB, which is closely related to the previously identified DGluRIIA and located adjacent to it in the genome. Mutations that eliminate DGluRIIA(but not DGluRIIB) or transgenic constructs that increase DGluRIIA expression were generated. When DGluRIIA is missing, the response of the muscle to a single vesicle of transmitter is substantially decreased. However, the response of the muscle to nerve stimulation is normal because quantal content is significantly increased. Thus, a decrease in postsynaptic receptors leads to an increase in presynaptic transmitter release, indicating that postsynaptic activity controls a retrograde signal that regulates presynaptic function."

https://openalex.org/W1997339096,"The eyeless, dachshund, and eyes absent genes encode conserved, nuclear proteins that are essential for eye development in Drosophila. Misexpression of eyeless or dachshund is also sufficient to induce the formation of ectopic compound eyes. Here we show that the dachshund and eyes absent genes act synergistically to induce ectopic retinal development and positively regulate the expression of each other. Moreover, we show that the Dachshund and Eyes Absent proteins can physically interact through conserved domains, suggesting a molecular basis for the genetic synergy observed and that a similar complex may function in mammals. We propose that a conserved regulatory network, rather than a linear hierarchy, controls retinal specification and involves multiple protein complexes that function during distinct steps of eye development."
https://openalex.org/W2027067842,"The Rho GTPases mediate actin rearrangements that are likely to be required for the numerous cell shape changes in a developing embryo. In a genetic screen for Rho signaling pathway components in Drosophila, we identified a gene, DRhoGEF2, that encodes a predicted Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Embryos lacking DRhoGEF2 fail to gastrulate due to a defect in cell shape changes required for tissue invagination, and expression of a dominant-negative Rho GTPase in early embryos results in similar defects. Evidence is also presented that DRhoGEF2 mediates these specific cell shape changes in response to the extracellular ligand, Fog. Together, these results establish a Rho-mediated signaling pathway that is essential for the major morphogenetic events in Drosophila gastrulation."
https://openalex.org/W2085674390,"Vesicular monoamine transporters are known to transport monoamines from the cytoplasm into secretory vesicles. We have used homologous recombination to generate mutant mice lacking the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), the predominant form expressed in the brain. Newborn homozygotes die within a few days after birth, manifesting severely impaired monoamine storage and vesicular release. In heterozygous adult mice, extracellular striatal dopamine levels, as well as K+- and amphetamine-evoked dopamine release, are diminished. The observed changes in presynaptic homeostasis are accompanied by a pronounced supersensitivity of the mice to the locomotor effects of the dopamine agonist apomorphine, the psychostimulants cocaine and amphetamine, and ethanol. Importantly, VMAT2 heterozygous mice do not develop further sensitization to repeated cocaine administration. These observations stress the importance of VMAT2 in the maintenance of presynaptic function and suggest that these mice may provide an animal model for delineating the mechanisms of vesicular release, monoamine function, and postsynaptic sensitization associated with drug abuse."
https://openalex.org/W1996222810,"To assess the role of exocytotic release in signaling by monoamines, we have disrupted the neuronal vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) gene. VMAT2-/- mice move little, feed poorly, and die within a few days after birth. Monoamine cell groups and their projections are indistinguishable from those of wild-type littermates, but the brains of mutant mice show a drastic reduction in monoamines. Using midbrain cultures from the mutant animals, amphetamine but not depolarization induces dopamine release. In vivo, amphetamine increases movement, promotes feeding, and prolongs the survival of VMAT2-/- animals, indicating that precise, temporally regulated exocytotic release of monoamine is not required for certain complex behaviors. In addition, the brains of VMAT2 heterozygotes contain substantially lower monoamine levels than those of wild-type littermates, and depolarization induces less dopamine release from heterozygous than from wild-type cultures, suggesting that VMAT2 expression regulates monoamine storage and release."

https://openalex.org/W1984470518,"Netrin-1 promotes outgrowth of axons in vitro through the receptor Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) and elicits turning of axons within embryonic explants when presented as a point source. It is not known whether netrin-1 alone can elicit turning nor whether DCC mediates the turning response. We show that Xenopus retinal ganglion cell growth cones orient rapidly toward a pipette ejecting netrin-1, an effect blocked by antibodies to DCC. In vitro, netrin-1 induces a complex growth cone morphology reminiscent of that at the optic nerve head, a site of netrin-1 expression in vivo. These results demonstrate that netrin-1 can function alone to induce turning, implicate DCC in this response, and support the idea that netrin-1 contributes to steering axons out of the retina."
https://openalex.org/W2077909999,"Crx is a novel paired-like homeodomain protein that is expressed predominantly in retinal photoreceptors and pinealocytes. Its gene has been mapped to chromosome 19q13.3, the site of a disease locus for autosomal dominant cone-rod dystrophy (CORDII). Analysis of the proband from a family with autosomal dominant CORD revealed an Arg41Trp substitution in the third residue of the CRX homeodomain. The sequence change cosegregated with the disease phenotype and was not detected in 247 normal controls. Recombinant CRX homeodomain containing the Arg41Trp substitution showed decreased DNA binding activity. Analysis of another 169 CORD probands identified three additional CRX sequence variations (Arg41Gln, Val242Met, and a 4 bp deletion in codons 196/7) that were not found among the controls. This data suggests that mutations in the CRX gene are associated with photoreceptor degeneration and that the Crx protein is necessary for the maintenance of normal cone and rod function."
https://openalex.org/W2058476273,"Axon formation in multipolar neurons is believed to depend on the existence of precise sorting mechanisms for axonal membrane and membrane-associated proteins. Conclusive evidence in living neurons, however, is lacking. In the present study, we use light and video microscopy to address this issue directly. We show that axon formation is preceded by the appearance in one of the multiple neurites of (1) a larger growth cone, (2) a higher amount and greater transport of membrane organelles, (3) polarized delivery of TGN-derived vesicles, (4) a higher concentration of mitochondria and peroxisomes, (5) a higher concentration of a cytosolic protein, and (6) a higher concentration of ribosomes. These results provide evidence for the involvement of bulk cytoplasmic flow as an early determinant of neuronal morphological polarization. Molecular sorting events would later trigger the establishment of functional polarity."
https://openalex.org/W2042590680,"In voltage-dependent ion channels, pore opening is initiated by electrically driven movements of charged residues, and this movement generates a gating current. To examine structural rearrangements in the Shaker K+ channel, basic residues R365 and R368 in the S4 segment were replaced with histidine, and gating currents were recorded. Changes in gating charge displacement with solvent pH reveal voltage-dependent changes in exposure of the histidine to solvent protons. This technique directly monitors accessibility changes during gating, probes the environment even in confined locations, and introduces minimal interference of gating charge motion. The results indicate that charges 365 and 368 traverse the entire electric field during gating. The remarkable implication of the successive exposure of histidine to each side of the membrane is that in a pH gradient, the voltage sensor transports protons."

https://openalex.org/W1989989032,"The pattern of scrapie prion protein (PrPSc) accumulation in the brain is different for each prion strain. We tested whether the PrPSc deposition pattern is influenced by the Asn-linked oligosaccharides of PrPC in transgenic mice. Deletion of the first oligosaccharide altered PrPC trafficking and prevented infection with two prion strains. Deletion of the second did not alter PrPC trafficking, permitted infection with one prion strain, and had a profound effect on the PrPSc deposition pattern. Our data raise the possibility that glycosylation can modify the conformation of PrPC. Glycosylation could affect the affinity of PrPC for a particular conformer of PrPSc, thereby determining the rate of nascent PrPSc formation and the specific patterns of PrPSc deposition."
https://openalex.org/W1970042814,"We have tested the proposal that the light-sensitive conductance in Drosophila is composed of two independent components by comparing the wild-type conductance with that in mutants lacking one or the other of the putative light-sensitive channel subunits, TRP and TRPL. For a wide range of cations, ionic permeability ratios in wild type were always intermediate between those of trp and trpl mutants. Effective channel conductances derived by noise analysis in wild type were again intermediate (17 pS; c.f. 35 pS in trp and 4 pS in trpl) and also showed a complex voltage dependence, which was quantitatively explained by the summation of TRPL and TRP channels after taking their different reversal potentials into account. Although La3+ partially blocked the light response in wild-type photoreceptors, it increased the effective single channel conductance. The results indicate that the wild-type light-activated conductance is composed of two separate channels, with the properties of TRP- and TRPL-dependent channels as determined in the respective mutants."
https://openalex.org/W1963989698,"We have examined the role of NMDA receptor-mediated neural activity in the formation of periphery-related somatosensory patterns, using genetically engineered mice. We demonstrate that ectopic expression of a transgene of an NMDAR1 splice variant rescues neonatally fatal NMDAR1 knockout (KO) mice, although the average life span varies depending on the level of the transgene expression. In NMDAR1 KO mice with ""high"" levels of the transgene expression, sensory periphery-related patterns were normal along both the trigeminal and dorsal column pathways. In the KO mice with ""low"" levels of the transgene expression, the patterns were absent in the trigeminal pathway. Our results indicate that NMDA receptor-mediated neural activity plays a critical role in pattern formation along the ascending somatosensory pathways."

https://openalex.org/W4237145571,"Infection by Ebola virus causes rapidly progressive, often fatal, symptoms of fever, hemorrhage and hypotension. Previous attempts to elicit protective immunity for this disease have not met with success. We report here that protection against the lethal effects of Ebola virus can be achieved in an animal model by immunizing with plasmids encoding viral proteins. We analyzed immune responses to the viral nucleoprotein (NP) and the secreted or transmembrane forms of the glycoprotein (sGP or GP) and their ability to protect against infection in a guinea pig infection model analogous to the human disease. Protection was achieved and correlated with antibody titer and antigen-specific T-cell responses to sGP or GP. Immunity to Ebola virus can therefore be developed through genetic vaccination and may facilitate efforts to limit the spread of this disease."

https://openalex.org/W2068320441,"In this report we describe a potentially powerful method for vaccinating infants against encapsulated bacterial pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. High levels of antibody directed against the polysaccharides of the bacterial capsule are normally protective. Unfortunately, the capsular polysaccharides are T cell-independent antigens (TI); lacking T-cell help, they induce only weak, predominantly IgM antibody responses, with infants responding especially poorly. T-cell help, given to B cells during responses to protein antigens, causes stronger antibody responses and isotype switching to the IgG isotypes. T-cell help is mainly mediated through ligation of the B-cell surface antigen, CD40, by its cognate T-cell ligand, CD154. Here we show that administering anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody to mice, along with pneumococcal polysaccharide, provides a substitute for T-cell help and results in the generation of strong, isotype-switched antibody responses, which are protective. The work points the way toward a possible effective and inexpensive means of protecting susceptible groups against important bacterial pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2024154483,"ClpX, a molecular chaperone and the regulatory subunit of the ClpXP protease, is shown to contain tandem modular domains that bind to the C-terminal sequences of target proteins in a manner that parallels functional specificity. Nuclear magnetic resonance studies show that these C-terminal sequences are displayed as disordered peptides on the surface of otherwise folded proteins. The ClpX substrate-binding domains are homologous to sequences in other Clp/Hsp100 proteins and are related more distantly to PDZ domains, which also mediate C-terminal specific protein-protein interactions. Conservation of these binding domains indicates that the mode of substrate recognition characterized here for ClpX will be a conserved feature among Clp/Hsp100 family members and a distinguishing characteristic between this chaperone family and the Hsp70 chaperones."

https://openalex.org/W2058938762,"Intracellular localization of organelles may depend in part on specific cytoplasmic linker proteins (CLIPs) that link membranous organelles to microtubules. Here, we characterize rat cDNAs encoding a novel, brain-specific CLIP of 115 kDa. This protein contains two N-terminal microtubule-binding domains and a long coiled-coil region; it binds to microtubules and is homologous to CLIP-170, a protein mediating the binding of endosomes to microtubules. CLIP-115 is enriched in the dendritic lamellar body (DLB), a recently discovered organelle predominantly present in bulbous dendritic appendages of neurons linked by dendrodendritic gap junctions. Local microtubule depolymerization leads to a temporary reduction of DLBs. These results suggest that CLIP-115 operates in the control of brain-specific organelle translocations."

We have developed a novel method for assaying p(r), which utilizes the synaptic refractory period--a brief 5-6 ms period following release during which the synapse is incapable of transmission (Stevens and Wang, 1995). We show that this assay is sensitive to a battery of manipulations that affect p(r) but find no change following either NMDA receptor-dependent LTP or long-term depression (LTD)."
