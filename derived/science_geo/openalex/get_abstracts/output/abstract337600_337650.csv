https://openalex.org/W1979212500,"Steric and hydrophobic effects on substrate specificity were probed by protein engineering of subtilisin. Subtilisin has broad peptidase specificity and contains a large hydrophobic substrate binding cleft. A conserved glycine (Gly(166)), located at the bottom of the substrate binding left, was replaced by 12 nonionic amino acids by the cassette mutagenesis method. Mutant enzymes showed large changes in specificity toward substrates of increasing size and hydrophobicity. In general, the catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) toward small hydrophobic substrates was increased (up to 16 times) by hydrophobic substitutions at position 166 in the binding cleft. Exceeding the optimal binding volume of the cleft ( approximately 160 A(3)), by enlarging either the substrate side chain or the side chain at position 166, evoked precipitous drops in catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) (up to 5000 times) as a result of steric hindrance."

https://openalex.org/W1993818786,"The Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984 was designed to advance arctic research in the national interest. Some of the research fields that require attention are weather and climate; national defense; renewable and nonrenewable resources; transportation; communications and spacedisturbance effects; environmental protection; health, culture, and socioeconomics; and international cooperation. A research framework recommended by the Arctic Research Commission includes, in order of priority, integrated investigations to understand: (i) the Arctic Ocean (including the marginal seas, sea ice, and seabed) and how the ocean and atmosphere operate as coupled components of the arctic system; (ii) the coupled atmosphere and land components and how their interaction governs the terrestrial environment; and (iii) the high-latitude upper atmosphere and its extension into the magnetosphere with emphasis on predicting and mitigating effects on communications and defense systems. A separate recommendation is for high priority research to resolve the major health, behavioral, and cultural problems related to the arctic environment. Recommendations are also made concerning support services and management."

https://openalex.org/W2058079444,"The subjective approach to hurricane prediction of yesteryear has given way to the automation of many facets of prediction, leaving the forecaster with more time to reason dynamically in making the final adjustments to the official track derived from a hierarchy of computer-generated guidances. The most important task immediately ahead is to develop and apply better diagnostic procedures to help the forecaster identify the guidance sources which are most likely to contain the truth, and to help assure that his final decision will either succeed or fail safely."
