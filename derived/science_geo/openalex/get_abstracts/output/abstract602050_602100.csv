https://openalex.org/W2778262854,"Selenoproteins are rare proteins among all kingdoms of life containing the 21st amino acid, selenocysteine. Selenocysteine resembles cysteine, differing only by the substitution of selenium for sulfur. Yet the actual advantage of selenolate- versus thiolate-based catalysis has remained enigmatic, as most of the known selenoproteins also exist as cysteine-containing homologs. Here, we demonstrate that selenolate-based catalysis of the essential mammalian selenoprotein GPX4 is unexpectedly dispensable for normal embryogenesis. Yet the survival of a specific type of interneurons emerges to exclusively depend on selenocysteine-containing GPX4, thereby preventing fatal epileptic seizures. Mechanistically, selenocysteine utilization by GPX4 confers exquisite resistance to irreversible overoxidation as cells expressing a cysteine variant are highly sensitive toward peroxide-induced ferroptosis. Remarkably, concomitant deletion of all selenoproteins in Gpx4cys/cys cells revealed that selenoproteins are dispensable for cell viability provided partial GPX4 activity is retained. Conclusively, 200 years after its discovery, a specific and indispensable role for selenium is provided."

Hematopoiesis is a tightly regulated process during which mature blood cells are produced from a small pool of multipotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). In particular, the differentiation of HSCs into myeloid progenitors and eventually mature myeloid cells, a process known as myelopoiesis, involves the actions of master transcription factors (TFs) that specify and re-enforce each cell-fate decision. For instance, PU.1 (SPI1, the product of the oncogene SPI1), a transcriptional master regulator of myeloid cells, plays an essential role in generating early myeloid progenitors (i.e., common myeloid progenitors [CMPs]), while the basic-region leucine zipper TF C/EBPα is required for the production of granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMPs) from CMPs (Dakic et al., 2005Dakic A. Metcalf D. Di Rago L. Mifsud S. Wu L. Nutt S.L. PU.1 regulates the commitment of adult hematopoietic progenitors and restricts granulopoiesis.J. Exp.

Transcription factors in myeloid development: Balancing differentiation with transformation.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Dysregulation of myelopoiesis results in the development of diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a clonal hematopoietic disorder where a stem cell-like self-renewal capacity is gained and the differentiation capacity is blocked (Testa, 2011Testa U. Leukemia stem cells.Ann. Hematol. 2011; 90: 245-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence has demonstrated the roles of oncogenic proteins in inducing myeloid differentiation block in the development of AML, as exemplified by oncogenic fusion proteins such as MLL fusions (t(11q23)), AML1-ETO (t(8;21)), PML-RARα (t(15;17)), and CBFβ-MYH11 (inv16) (Look, 1997Look A.T.

Transcription factors in myeloid development: Balancing differentiation with transformation.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Other well-known oncogenic TFs, such as MYB and MYC, have also been shown to contribute to AML development by inhibiting differentiation and promoting self-renewal of AML cells (Wall et al., 2008Wall M. Poortinga G. Hannan K.M. Pearson R.B. Hannan R.D. McArthur G.A.

Such findings have led to the exploration and development of differentiation-inducing agents (e.g., all trans-retinoic acid [ATRA]) targeting the oncogenic proteins to cure AML. Recent studies have shown that chemical modifications on RNA, similar to those in its DNA and histone counterparts, contribute to gene expression control. Among over 150 modified RNA nucleotide variants identified, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification is the most prevalent chemical mark in eukaryotic mRNAs, which is reversible (Jia et al., 2011Jia G. Fu Y. Zhao X. Dai Q. Zheng G. Yang Y. Yi C. Lindahl T. Pan T. Yang Y.G. He C. N6-methyladenosine in nuclear RNA is a major substrate of the obesity-associated FTO.Nat. Chem.

This modification was found on adenosines embedded in the consensus sequence G[G > A]m6AC[U > A > C] across the mRNA transcripts, especially near the stop codons (Fu et al., 2014Fu Y. Dominissini D. Rechavi G. He C. Gene expression regulation mediated through reversible m6A RNA methylation.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2014; 15: 293-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence has shown that m6A modifications in mRNAs or non-coding RNAs influence RNA fate and functions and are critical for most bioprocesses including tissue development, circadian rhythm, DNA damage response, sex determination, and tumorigenesis (Deng et al., 2017Deng X.

The m6A modification is deposited to RNAs by the m6A methyltransferase (writer) complex, a protein complex formed by the methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3)/methyltransferase-like 14 (METTL14) heterodimeric catalytic core and a regulatory subunit, Wilms’ tumor 1-associating protein (WTAP) (Bokar et al., 1997Bokar J.A.

While METTL3 possesses the active methyltransferase domain that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine (A) to m6A, METTL14 functions as an essential component to support METTL3 in recognizing RNA substrates, and thus the METTL3-METTL14 heterodimer is required for the methylation activity (Śledź and Jinek, 2016Śledź P.

Research on the role of m6A modifications and the m6A machinery in cancers, including leukemia, is still in its infancy. Here, we report that METTL14 plays a critical role in normal hematopoiesis and AML pathogenesis by fine-tuning the expression of its critical targets such as MYB and MYC through m6A-based post-transcriptional regulation. We first examined the expression patterns of known m6A writers (i.e., Mettl3, Mettl14, and Wtap) and erasers (i.e., Fto and Alkbh5) in different populations of mouse bone marrow (BM) cells. A significant lower levels of Mettl14 and Fto mRNAs were observed in the c-Kit– proportion compared to the corresponding c-Kit+ stem/progenitor counterpart in BM cells of wild-type C57BL/6 (CD45.2) mice, whereas no significant change was found for Mettl3, Wtap, or Alkbh5 (Figure 1A). Notably, the global m6A level on mRNAs was also decreased in c-Kit– cells relative to c-Kit+ cells (Figure 1B). Thus, the decreased m6A level in more matured hematopoietic cells (Figure 1B) is likely due to the downregulation of Mettl14 (Figures 1A and S1A). Further examination of Mettl14 in HSC and progenitor cells revealed that Mettl14 is expressed at a high level in HSC and Lin– Sca-1+ c-kit+ (LSK) cells and is markedly downregulated in hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs, Lin– Sca-1– c-kit+) and CMPs, but not in megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEPs); its expression is further downregulated in GMP and myeloid cells (Mac-1+/Gr-1+) (Figure 1C). Similar results were observed in BM of wild-type B6.SJL (CD45.1) mice (Figure S1B), suggesting that the downregulation of Mettl14 in committed or differentiated myeloid-lineage cells is common. Furthermore, we induced differentiation of mouse hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) in vitro using the OP9-coculture system (Holmes and Zuniga-Pflucker, 2009Holmes R. Zuniga-Pflucker J.C. The OP9-DL1 system: Generation of T-lymphocytes from embryonic or hematopoietic stem cells in vitro.Cold Spring Harbor Protoc. 2009; (Published online February 2009)https://doi.org/10.1101/pdb.prot5156Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). After 5 days of coculture, most of the HSPCs differentiated toward myeloid lineage (Figure 1D) but not B or T lineage (Figure S1C), and Mettl14 expression was dramatically decreased at both RNA and protein levels (Figure 1E). These data together indicate that the expression of Mettl14 as well as the m6A level is downregulated during myeloid differentiation. We next conducted loss-of-function studies in human CD34+ HSPCs to investigate the role of METTL14 in HSPC differentiation. CD34+ HSPCs were transduced with pLKO.1-based lentiviral short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting human METTL14 (shM14) or pLKO.1-scrambled shRNA (shNS) and induced toward monocyte/macrophage differentiation (Figure 1F). Knockdown of METTL14 in normal CD34+ cells showed only slight effect on cell growth and apoptosis, though with a more noticeable effect on their colony-forming ability (Figures S1D–S1F). As expected, endogenous expression of METTL14 was gradually downregulated during normal myelopoiesis in the control group and further decreased when METTL14 was knocked down (Figures 1G, 1H, S1G, and S1H). An acceleration in monocytic differentiation was observed upon METTL14 silencing (Figures 1I and S1I). In addition, expression of CD11b and CSF1R, genes encoding markers for monocyte and macrophage differentiation, were upregulated during normal monocytic differentiation, which was further enhanced upon METTL14 depletion (Figures 1G and S1G). Opposite changes were observed for GATA1 (Figures 1G and S1G), which was reported to inhibit monocyte differentiation (Tanaka et al., 2000Tanaka H. Matsumura I. Nakajima K. Daino H. Sonoyama J. Yoshida H. Oritani K. Machii T. Yamamoto M. Hirano T. Kanakura Y. GATA-1 blocks IL-6-induced macrophage differentiation and apoptosis through the sustained expression of cyclin D1 and bcl-2 in a murine myeloid cell line M1.Blood. 2000; 95: 1264-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By utilizing Mettl14fl/fl-CREERT conditional knockout (Mettl14-cKO) mice in which Mettl14 could be depleted upon 4-OHT or tamoxifen (TAM) treatment in vitro or in vivo (Figures S1J–S1M), we found a moderate increase in white blood cell (WBC) count and myeloid cells over 16 weeks after TAM treatment, although not always statistically significant (Figure S1N). Further, to evaluate the impact of Mettl14 on the functional capacity of HSCs in vivo, we conducted competitive repopulation assays (Figure S1O). As shown in Figure 1J, TAM-induced deletion of Mettl14 in recipient mice resulted in a mild but significant decline in the ratio of CD45.2+ (Mettl14-cKO) cells versus CD45.1+CD45.2+ (competitor) cells in peripheral blood (PB), suggesting a partial inhibition of HSC self-renewal activity in vivo upon Mettl14 depletion. Collectively, METTL14 expression is downregulated during myelopoiesis and its knockdown further substantially promotes differentiation of HSPCs toward myeloid cells, implying that METTL14 plays a role in inhibiting normal myelopoiesis. Analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data revealed that AML has a higher level of METTL14 expression than the vast majority of other cancer types (Figure S2A). We showed that METTL14 was expressed at a significantly higher level in BM mononuclear cells (MNCs) of primary AML patients carrying common chromosomal translocations (e.g., t(8;21), t(15;17) and t(11q23)), except for inv(16), than in the healthy donors (Figure 2A). Consistently, METTL14 is also expressed at a higher level in human leukemia cell lines than in normal MNCs, or CD34+ or CD34– MNCs, of healthy donors (Figure 2B). Consistently, we found a higher expression of METTL14, as well as METTL3, in mouse BM progenitor cells immortalized by oncogenic fusion genes including MLL-fusions (MLL-AF9, MLL-AF10, and MLL-ENL), PML-RARa (a t(15;17) fusion gene), and AML1-ETO9a (a truncated but more potent oncogenic isoform of AML1-ETO, a t(8;21) fusion gene) (Figures 2C and S2B). In addition, in the murine leukemic cell line MLL-ENL-ERtm that carries TAM-inducible MLL-ENL (Zeisig et al., 2004Zeisig B.B. Milne T. García-Cuéllar M.P. Schreiner S. Martin M.E. Fuchs U. Borkhardt A. Chanda S.K. Walker J. Soden R. et al.Hoxa9 and Meis1 are key targets for MLL-ENL-mediated cellular immortalization.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 617-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), Mettl14 expression was gradually and dramatically decreased over time after withdrawal of 4-hydroxy-TAM (4-OHT) (Figure S2C). Such data suggest that METTL14 expression is affected by these AML-associated fusion proteins directly or indirectly. Notably, when human AML cells were treated with differentiation-inducing agents, such as ATRA or phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), a decrease in METTL14 level as well as global m6A level was observed (Figure 2D), similar to the pattern in normal myelopoiesis (Figure 1). Thus, the downregulation of METTL14 is a common event in the myeloid differentiation of both normal HSPCs and AML cells. To identify TFs that directly regulate METTL14 expression, we analyzed the ENCODE chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data in ChIPBase (Yang et al., 2013Yang J.H. Li J.H. Jiang S. Zhou H. Qu L.H. ChIPBase: A database for decoding the transcriptional regulation of long non-coding RNA and microRNA genes from ChIP-seq data.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: D177-D187Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and found that hematopoietic TFs including CEBPB, GABPA, ELF1, CEBPA, and SPI1 have binding sites within 5 Kb upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) of METTL14. Among them, GABPA and ELF1 showed a significant positive correlation, whereas SPI1 showed a significant negative correlation, with METTL14 in expression across AML patient samples (n = 166) from TCGA (Ley et al., 2013Ley T.J. Miller C. Ding L. Raphael B.J. Mungall A.J. Robertson A. Hoadley K. Triche Jr., T.J. Laird P.W. Baty J.D. et al.Cancer Genome Atlas Research NetworkGenomic and epigenomic landscapes of adult de novo acute myeloid leukemia.N. Engl. J. Med. 2013; 368: 2059-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar) as well as normal BM samples in GSE24006 dataset (n = 31) or blood tissues (n = 444) from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx) (Figure S2D). Knockdown of SPI1 resulted in consistent upregulation of METTL14 in both MONOMAC-6 (MM6) and NB4 AML cells, which carry t(9;11) and t(15;17), respectively, whereas no consistent patterns were observed in these two cell lines when GABPA or ELF1 was knocked down (Figures S2E and S2F). By utilizing two individual shRNAs against SPI1, we showed that knockdown of SPI1 resulted in an increase of METTL14 at both mRNA and protein levels in human AML cells and normal CD34+ HSPCs (Figures 2E and 2F). Conversely, overexpression of SPI1 decreased METTL14 expression in these cells (Figures 2E and 2F). Thus, SPI1 is likely a negative regulator of METTL14 in AML cells. In contrast, no binding sites for SPI1 were found within 5 Kb upstream of TSS of METTL3. Six potential binding sites of SPI1 were predicted within 5 Kb upstream or in the vicinity of the TSS of METTL14 by JASPAR. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR assays demonstrated that SPI1 has a significant enrichment on 5 of the 6 sites over normal immunoglobulin G (IgG) control (Figure 2G), indicating a direct binding. Luciferase reporter assays showed a significant decrease of reporter expression upon insertion of site 3 sequence into the promoter region as compared to the empty vector or vector with mutant site 3 sequence where the putative SPI1 binding motif was completely destroyed (Figure S2G). This reduction of luciferase expression was abrogated when SPI1 was silenced (Figure S2G), supporting a SPI1-dependent negative regulation on gene expression. In addition, SPI1 exhibited a significant lower expression in primary AML samples with t(8;21), t(15;17), and t(11q23) translocations than in healthy donors (Figure 2H) and showed a negative correlation with METTL14 in expression in these samples (Figure 2I). Moreover, Spi1 was downregulated in mouse BM progenitor cells transduced with AML-associated fusion genes (Figure S2H). During myeloid differentiation of normal HSPCs and AML cells, SPI1 is gradually and significantly upregulated (Figures S2I and S2J), in a manner opposite to METTL14 (Figures 1G and 2D). Together, these data suggest that SPI1 is a direct negative regulator of METTL14 expression in both normal and malignant hematopoietic cells. Colony-forming/replating assays (CFAs) were then conducted to evaluate the potential role of Mettl14 in cell transformation mediated by AML-associated fusion genes. Conditional ablation of Mettl14 by 4-OHT treatment dramatically impaired cell-transforming ability of all the oncogenic fusion genes tested (Figure 3A). Similar to the genetic knockout, silencing of Mettl14 by shRNAs (Figure S3A) also significantly disrupted MA9-induced cell immortalization in vitro (Figure S3B). Conversely, ectopic expression of wild-type (METTL14-WT), but not mutated METTL14 (METTL14-R298P; R298 is critical for target recognition of the methyltransferase complex [Wang et al., 2016aWang P.

Tang C. et al.Structural basis of N(6)-adenosine methylation by the METTL3-METTL14 complex.Nature. 2016; 534: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar]), substantially increased global m6A level and promoted cell immortalization mediated by MA9 (Figures 3B and 3C), suggesting the effect of METTL14 on cell transformation relies on its role as a RNA methylation modifier. To assess the role of Mettl14 in leukemogenesis in vivo, we transplanted lethally irradiated recipient mice with MA9-transduced Lin– BM HSPCs from Mettl14fl/fl-CREERT (fl/fl) mice or wild-type (WT) mice (Figure S3C). In agreement with the in vitro data, induced deletion of Mettl14 in vivo by TAM significantly delayed leukemia onset and prolonged the survival of primary BMT recipient mice (fl/fl, Figure 3D). In contrast, TAM treatment of recipients transplanted with MA9-transduced WT cells showed no effect on survival (WT; Figure 3D). In addition, Mettl14 depletion led to decreased immature blast cell population in both PB and BM, as well as a reduction of leukemia cell infiltration and disruption of organ architecture in spleen and liver (Figure 3E). A reduction in both WBC count and spleen weight index was observed in the fl/fl-TAM mice compared to the control group was observed (Figure S3D). As expected, BM cells from the TAM-treated fl/fl Mett114 mice (TAM) exhibited lower levels of global m6A than those from vehicle-treated mice (CT) (Figure 3F). While most of the BM cells in both TAM- and vehicle (CT)-treated fl/fl groups showed a strong signal of the myeloid marker Mac-1, the c-kit+ and the LSK populations were markedly decreased in the Mettl14-depleted group (Figures 3G, S3E, and S3F). CFAs of BM leukemic cells from the primary fl/fl BMT recipient mice showed smaller and reduced colonies in the TAM-treated group than in the control group (Figure 3H), demonstrating impaired proliferation potential of leukemia cells when Mettl14 was depleted. To directly evaluate the effect of Mettl14 depletion on the frequency of leukemia stem/initiating cells (LSCs/LICs), we conducted limiting dilution assays. As expected, the estimated LSC/LIC frequency of the Mettl14 knockout group (TAM) is significantly lower (p < 0.01) than that of the control group (1/3,218 versus 1/433) (Figure 3I). To determine whether Mettl14 is also required for leukemia maintenance, we performed CFAs with leukemic BM cells collected from primary AML mice. As expected, Mettl14 knockdown significantly inhibited colony-forming/replating capacity of various AML cells (Figure 3J). Secondary BMT assay with colony cells from the first round of plating further demonstrated that knockdown of Mettl14 significantly inhibited progression of MA9-induced AML in secondary recipients (Figure 3K). Similarly, TAM-induced Mettl14 depletion in secondary recipients transplanted with BM cells from Mettl14fl/fl-CREERT+MA9 primary leukemic mice (as illustrated in Figure S3C) led to a dramatically prolonged survival (Figure 3L) and largely normal morphologies in PB, BM, spleen, and liver tissues (Figure 3M), as well as a significant reduction in WBC and spleen weight index (Figure S3G). We next studied the function of METTL14 in human AML cells. METTL14 depletion by shRNAs resulted in a substantial inhibition of cell grow/proliferation and a significant induction of apoptosis in both MM6 and NB4 AML cells (Figures 4A and S4A). Conversely, ectopic expression of METTL14-WT, but not METTL14-R298P mutant, promoted growth of human AML cells (Figure 4B). Moreover, knockdown of METTL14 greatly promoted terminal myeloid differentiation of AML cells (Figures 4C and 4D). Similarly, knockdown of METTL14 led to cell growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis and differentiation in primary leukemic blasts (CD34+) from three AML patients (Figures 4E, 4F, S4B, and S4C). Our in vivo studies showed that knockdown of METTL14 significantly inhibited progression of human AML cells and substantially prolonged survival in xeno-transplantation recipient mice (Figures 4G and 4H) associated with remarkably reduced tumor burden (Figure 4I). Since knockdown of METTL14 promotes terminal differentiation of AML cells, we also tested whether depleting METTL14 expression can further sensitize AML cells to differentiation-inducing agents. As expected, depletion of METTL14 greatly increased CD11b+ population of human AML cells in the presence of ATRA (Figure 4J) or PMA (Figure S4D), as compared to the control (shNS) group. Conversely, overexpression of METTL14 significantly inhibits ATRA-induced myeloid differentiation, as compared to overexpression of METTL14-R298P or empty vector (Figure 4K). We then conducted RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and m6A-sequencing (m6A-seq) assays in MM6 and NB4 cells to identify METTL14 targets. RNA-seq revealed that 560 genes were significantly downregulated, while 377 genes were significantly upregulated (p < 0.05; fold change ≥1.2) upon METTL14 knockdown in both cell lines (Figure 5A). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed an enrichment of genes downregulated in hematopoietic/leukemic stem cells as well as MYB-downregulated targets in knockdown cells relative to control cells (Figure S5A). In agreement, real-time qPCR confirmed the downregulation and upregulation of a set of reported positive and negative targets of MYB, respectively, in MM6 cells upon METTL14 knockdown (Figure S5B). More than 16,675 and 18,831 m6A peaks were identified from m6A-seq libraries generated from MM6 and NB4 cells, respectively, which correspond with 8,246 and 9,632 transcripts.

Considering the role of METTL14 in the m6A writer complex, only m6A peaks with decreased abundance (termed as m6A-hypo peaks) upon METTL14 knockdown were considered as authentic m6A peaks. As shown in Figure S5F, 1,368 and 934 genes in METTL14 knockdown (i.e., shM14-#1 and shM14-#2) MM6 cells and 2,220 and 2,875 genes in METTL14 knockdown NB4 cells carry one or more m6A-hypo peaks (diff p < 0.01), which were thereafter termed m6A-hypo genes. Among these genes, 676 were shared between MM6 and NB4 cells. Notably, the vast majority of m6A-hypo genes (88.0%–92.8% for MM6, 69.9%–78.1% for NB4) are associated with downregulated mRNA levels in METTL14 knockdown cells (Figures 5B and S5F). As our m6A mapping method has relatively lower resolution than the recently developed m6A individual-nucleotide-resolution cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (miCLIP) method (Linder et al., 2015Linder B.

Only a small portion (5.13% ∼7.48%) of the (m6A-)hypo peaks are located within this region (Figure S5G). Nevertheless, METTL3-METTL14 complex does not mediate the cap m6Am methylation (Mauer et al., 2017Mauer J. Luo X. Blanjoie A. Jiao X. Grozhik A.V. Patil D.P. Linder B. Pickering B.F. Vasseur J.J.

https://openalex.org/W2776223742,"Microglia exhibit two modes of motility: they constantly extend and retract their processes to survey the brain, but they also send out targeted processes to envelop sites of tissue damage. We now show that these motility modes differ mechanistically. We identify the two-pore domain channel THIK-1 as the main K+ channel expressed in microglia in situ. THIK-1 is tonically active, and its activity is potentiated by P2Y12 receptors. Inhibiting THIK-1 function pharmacologically or by gene knockout depolarizes microglia, which decreases microglial ramification and thus reduces surveillance, whereas blocking P2Y12 receptors does not affect membrane potential, ramification, or surveillance. In contrast, process outgrowth to damaged tissue requires P2Y12 receptor activation but is unaffected by blocking THIK-1. Block of THIK-1 function also inhibits release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β from activated microglia, consistent with K+ loss being needed for inflammasome assembly. Thus, microglial immune surveillance and cytokine release require THIK-1 channel activity."
https://openalex.org/W2776975398,"The medial frontal cortex, including anterior midcingulate cortex, has been linked to multiple psychological domains, including cognitive control, pain, and emotion. However, it is unclear whether this region encodes representations of these domains that are generalizable across studies and subdomains. Additionally, if there are generalizable representations, do they reflect a single underlying process shared across domains or multiple domain-specific processes? We decomposed multivariate patterns of functional MRI activity from 270 participants across 18 studies into study-specific, subdomain-specific, and domain-specific components and identified latent multivariate representations that generalized across subdomains but were specific to each domain. Pain representations were localized to anterior midcingulate cortex, negative emotion representations to ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and cognitive control representations to portions of the dorsal midcingulate. These findings provide evidence for medial frontal cortex representations that generalize across studies and subdomains but are specific to distinct psychological domains rather than reducible to a single underlying process."

X-ray crystallography provided GPCR molecular architectures, which also revealed the need for additional structural dynamics data to support drug development. Here, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy with the wild-type-like A2A adenosine receptor (A2AAR) in solution provides a comprehensive characterization of signaling-related structural dynamics. All six tryptophan indole and eight glycine backbone 15N-1H NMR signals in A2AAR were individually assigned. These NMR probes provided insight into the role of Asp522.50 as an allosteric link between the orthosteric drug binding site and the intracellular signaling surface, revealing strong interactions with the toggle switch Trp 2466.48, and delineated the structural response to variable efficacy of bound drugs across A2AAR. The present data support GPCR signaling based on dynamic interactions between two semi-independent subdomains connected by an allosteric switch at Asp522.50."
https://openalex.org/W2782456208,"OPR3 is required to reduce the JA-Ile precursor OPDA. Analyses of JA levels in a loss-of-function opr3-3 mutant identified an OPR3-independent pathway for JA-Ile biosynthesis, based on OPDA conversion to 4,5-ddh-JA and reduction to JA by OPR2. Biosynthesis of the phytohormone jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) requires reduction of the JA precursor 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) by OPDA reductase 3 (OPR3). Previous analyses of the opr3-1 Arabidopsis mutant suggested an OPDA signaling role independent of JA-Ile and its receptor COI1; however, this hypothesis has been challenged because opr3-1 is a conditional allele not completely impaired in JA-Ile biosynthesis. To clarify the role of OPR3 and OPDA in JA-independent defenses, we isolated and characterized a loss-of-function opr3-3 allele. Strikingly, opr3-3 plants remained resistant to necrotrophic pathogens and insect feeding, and activated COI1-dependent JA-mediated gene expression. Analysis of OPDA derivatives identified 4,5-didehydro-JA in wounded wild-type and opr3-3 plants. OPR2 was found to reduce 4,5-didehydro-JA to JA, explaining the accumulation of JA-Ile and activation of JA-Ile-responses in opr3-3 mutants. Our results demonstrate that in the absence of OPR3, OPDA enters the β-oxidation pathway to produce 4,5-ddh-JA as a direct precursor of JA and JA-Ile, thus identifying an OPR3-independent pathway for JA biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2779236324,"Summary α-Synuclein (α-syn) aggregation is a key event in Parkinson's disease (PD). Mutations in glycosphingolipid (GSL)-degrading glucocerebrosidase are risk factors for PD, indicating that disrupted GSL clearance plays a key role in α-syn aggregation. However, the mechanisms of GSL-induced aggregation are not completely understood. We document the presence of physiological α-syn conformers in human midbrain dopamine neurons and tested their contribution to the aggregation process. Pathological α-syn assembly mainly occurred through the conversion of high molecular weight (HMW) physiological α-syn conformers into compact, assembly-state intermediates by glucosylceramide (GluCer), without apparent disassembly into free monomers. This process was reversible in vitro through GluCer depletion. Reducing GSLs in PD patient neurons with and without GBA1 mutations diminished pathology and restored physiological α-syn conformers that associated with synapses. Our work indicates that GSLs control the toxic conversion of physiological α-syn conformers in a reversible manner that is amenable to therapeutic intervention by GSL reducing agents."

However, the reference databases of full-length SSU rRNA gene sequences are skewed to well-studied ecosystems and subject to primer bias and chimerism, which results in an incomplete view of the diversity present in a sample. We combine poly(A)-tailing and reverse transcription of SSU rRNA molecules with synthetic long-read sequencing to generate high-quality, full-length SSU rRNA sequences, without primer bias, at high throughput. We apply our approach to samples from seven different ecosystems and obtain more than a million SSU rRNA sequences from all domains of life, with an estimated raw error rate of 0.17%. We observe a large proportion of novel diversity, including several deeply branching phylum-level lineages putatively related to the Asgard Archaea. Our approach will enable expansion of the SSU rRNA reference databases by orders of magnitude, and contribute to a comprehensive census of the tree of life."

Previously, we have shown that intracellular substrates are recruited to a bipartite binding site when the transporter rests in an inward-facing conformation. A key question remains: how are high-affinity substrates transferred across the membrane and released outside the cell? Using electron cryomicroscopy, we show here that ATP binding opens the transport pathway to the extracellular space and reconfigures the substrate-binding site such that it relinquishes its affinity for substrate. Thus, substrate is released prior to ATP hydrolysis. With this result, we now have a complete description of the conformational cycle that enables substrate transfer in a eukaryotic ABC exporter."

Xenografted organoids were prone to displacement by the remaining murine crypts, and this could be overcome by complete removal of the mouse epithelium. Xenografted organoids formed crypt structures distinctively different from surrounding mouse crypts, reflecting their human origin. Lineage tracing using CRISPR-Cas9 to engineer an LGR5-CreER knockin allele demonstrated self-renewal and multipotency of LGR5+ CoSCs. In contrast to the rapidly cycling properties of mouse Lgr5+ CoSCs, human LGR5+ CoSCs were slow-cycling in vivo.

For this reason, the impacts of climate change on future hydrological extremes is investigated in these river basins. We use a fully-distributed cryospheric-hydrological model to simulate current and future hydrological fluxes and force the model with an ensemble of 8 downscaled General Circulation Models (GCMs) that are selected from the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. The model is calibrated on observed daily discharge and geodetic mass balances. The climate forcing and the outputs of the hydrological model are used to evaluate future changes in climatic extremes, and hydrological extremes by focusing on high and low flows. The outcomes show an increase in the magnitude of climatic means and extremes towards the end of the 21st century where climatic extremes tend to increase stronger than climatic means. Future mean discharge and high flow conditions will very likely increase. These increases might mainly be the result of increasing precipitation extremes. To some extent temperature extremes might also contribute to increasing discharge extremes, although this is highly dependent on magnitude of change in temperature extremes. Low flow conditions may occur less frequently, although the uncertainties in low flow projections can be high. The results of this study may contribute to improved understanding on the implications of climate change for the occurrence of future hydrological extremes in the Hindu Kush–Himalayan region."

Our results lead us to propose that telomerase inappropriately binds to and inhibits restart of reversed replication forks within telomeres, which compromises replication and leads to critically short telomeres. Eukaryotic genomes are organized into linear chromosomes, which require the presence of telomeres to protect and maintain their chromosome ends. Telomeres are repetitive sequences (TTAGGG in vertebrates) that form complex nucleoprotein structures that protect chromosome ends from promiscuous DNA repair activities and nucleolytic degradation (reviewed in de Lange, 2005de Lange T. Shelterin: The protein complex that shapes and safeguards human telomeres.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2100-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar). Telomeres also shorten with each cell division due to processing by nucleases, genotoxic stress and the “end-replication problem” (Harley et al., 1990Harley C.B. Futcher A.B. Greider C.W. Telomeres shorten during ageing of human fibroblasts.Nature. 1990; 345: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (4608) Google Scholar). To counteract telomere shortening, telomeric repeats can be extended by means of telomerase, a reverse transcriptase that uses an RNA moiety (TERC) as a template to extend the 3′ end of the chromosome (Greider and Blackburn, 1985Greider C.W.

Blackburn E.H. Functional evidence for an RNA template in telomerase.Science. 1990; 247: 546-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Telomerase expression is normally high in stem cells and repressed in somatic tissues but is frequently re-expressed in cancer cells as a means of maintaining telomere length during disease progression (Damle et al., 2004Damle R.N. Batliwalla F.M. Ghiotto F. Valetto A. Albesiano E. Sison C. Allen S.L. Kolitz J. Vinciguerra V.P.

Cancer. 2003; 88: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Telomere integrity is also dependent on the six-subunit Shelterin complex, which (1) suppresses ATM and ATR checkpoint signaling, (2) inhibits DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways, and (3) facilitates semi-conservative telomere replication (de Lange, 2005de Lange T. Shelterin: The protein complex that shapes and safeguards human telomeres.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2100-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar). Shelterin is composed of telomere repeat-binding factor 1 and 2 (TRF1 and TRF2, respectively), protection of telomeres 1 (POT1), TRF1-interacting nuclear factor 2 (TIN2), repressor activator protein 1 (RAP1), and TPP1 (reviewed in Palm and de Lange, 2008Palm W. de Lange T. How shelterin protects mammalian telomeres.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2008; 42: 301-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). TRF1 is essential for efficient telomere replication, which averts telomeric fragility (Sfeir et al., 2009Sfeir A. Kosiyatrakul S.T. Hockemeyer D. MacRae S.L. Karlseder J. Schildkraut C.L. de Lange T. Mammalian telomeres resemble fragile sites and require TRF1 for efficient replication.Cell. 2009; 138: 90-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), whereas TRF2 prevents ATM activation at telomeres, telomere end-to-end fusions, and loss of the 3′ single-stranded overhang (Celli and de Lange, 2005Celli G.B. de Lange T.

Moreover, POT1 represses the activity of ATR at telomeres by binding to single-stranded DNA and thus preventing the recruitment of RPA (Denchi and de Lange, 2007Denchi E.L. de Lange T.

One way that TRF2 protects chromosome ends is by promoting the formation of t-loops at telomeres, which form when the 3′ single-stranded telomeric G-rich overhang invades into internal telomeric repeats to form a lariat-like structure (Doksani et al., 2013Doksani Y.

By masking the processed DSB end within an internally protected structure, t-loops protect chromosome ends from degradation and deleterious DNA damage response (DDR) pathways (reviewed in O’Sullivan and Karlseder, 2010O’Sullivan R.J. Karlseder J. Telomeres: Protecting chromosomes against genome instability.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Telomere replication and telomerase access to the 3′ telomeric end require that t-loops are transiently dismantled during S-phase, which is catalyzed by Regulator of Telomere Length 1 (RTEL1) (Sarek et al., 2015Sarek G. Vannier J.B. Panier S. Petrini J.H. Boulton S.J. TRF2 recruits RTEL1 to telomeres in S phase to promote t-loop unwinding.Mol. Cell. 2015; 57: 622-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the absence of RTEL1, persistent t-loops are aberrantly excised by the SLX1/4 nuclease complex, leading to dramatic telomere length changes and loss of the t-loop as a circle (Vannier et al., 2012Vannier J.B. Pavicic-Kaltenbrunner V. Petalcorin M.I. Ding H. Boulton S.J. RTEL1 dismantles T loops and counteracts telomeric G4-DNA to maintain telomere integrity.Cell. 2012; 149: 795-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Loss of RTEL1 also causes the appearance of telomeric fragility, which reflects a defect in unwinding telomeric G4-DNA structures that hinder DNA replication (Vannier et al., 2012Vannier J.B. Pavicic-Kaltenbrunner V. Petalcorin M.I. Ding H. Boulton S.J. RTEL1 dismantles T loops and counteracts telomeric G4-DNA to maintain telomere integrity.Cell. 2012; 149: 795-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). This second function of RTEL1 is also important genome-wide to facilitate processive genome replication and to prevent tumorigenesis (Vannier et al., 2013Vannier J.B. Sandhu S. Petalcorin M.I. Wu X. Nabi Z. Ding H. Boulton S.J. RTEL1 is a replisome-associated helicase that promotes telomere and genome-wide replication.Science. 2013; 342: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The clinical importance of RTEL1’s role at telomeres was recently highlighted with the discovery that it is frequently mutated in Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome (HHS), a severe form of Dyskeratosis congenita (DKC) (Ballew et al., 2013aBallew B.J.

Genet. 2013; 92: 448-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, the rapid onset of telomeric dysfunction following conditional murine RTEL1 inactivation does not result in chromosome end-to-end fusions nor activation of a robust DDR (Vannier et al., 2012Vannier J.B. Pavicic-Kaltenbrunner V. Petalcorin M.I. Ding H. Boulton S.J. RTEL1 dismantles T loops and counteracts telomeric G4-DNA to maintain telomere integrity.Cell. 2012; 149: 795-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Since telomerase is constitutively active in mouse cells, it seemed plausible that this activity could act to heal critically short telomeres that arise in the absence of RTEL1, thereby preventing telomere fusions and induction of the DDR. However, we report here that eliminating telomerase activity does not lead to telomere fusions following inactivation of RTEL1. Strikingly, Rtel1−/−Terc−/− cells are instead rescued for the rapid accumulation of dysfunctional telomeres normally observed following conditional loss of RTEL1, which implied that telomerase is driving telomere catastrophe in this context. We proceed to show that telomerase aberrantly accumulates at telomeres in the absence of RTEL1 and eliminating telomerase or blocking its recruitment to telomeres is sufficient to rescue telomere dysfunction in Rtel1-null cells. We present evidence that the abnormal association of telomerase with telomeres in these cells corresponds to its binding to single-ended DSBs generated at reversed replication forks that form as a consequence of persistent t-loops or unresolved telomeric G4-DNA structures. Consistent with this conclusion, blocking fork reversal is sufficient to rescue telomere dysfunction in Rtel1−/− cells, whereas inhibiting the restart of reversed replication forks mimics the toxic effects of telomerase. These data reveal an unappreciated source of critically short telomeres that results from the aberrant binding and stabilization of reversed replication forks by telomerase. To determine whether telomerase prevents telomere fusions and DDR induction at telomeres in Rtel1−/− cells, Rtel1f/f conditional mice were crossed with early generation Terc+/− mice, which lack the RNA component of telomerase (Terc). Mouse adult ear fibroblast (MAF) cell lines were derived from aged matched Rtel1f/fTerc+/+ and Rtel1f/fTerc−/− sibling mice. These cells carry Rtel1 floxed alleles, which allow the conditional deletion of the Rtel1 gene by Cre-mediated recombination (Sarek et al., 2015Sarek G. Vannier J.B. Panier S. Petrini J.H.

In contrast to Trf2−/− cells, which exhibit extensive telomere fusions, no fusions were observed following Cre-mediated inactivation of RTEL1, irrespective of the status of telomerase (Figures 1A and 1B ). These data establish that removing telomerase does not lead to telomere fusions in the absence of RTEL1.Figure 1Terc Deletion Rescues Telomere Dysfunction in Rtel1-Deficient CellsShow full caption(A) Telomeric FISH to analyze telomere fusions per metaphase in cells of the indicated genotypes 96 hr after Ad-Cre infection.

Metaphase spreads from Rtel1-deficient telomerase positive and negative cells were also scored for the presence of telomere loss, telomere fragility, telomere length heterogeneity, and telomere circles (TCs), which are hallmarks of telomere dysfunction observed following loss of RTEL1 (Figure 1C). To our surprise, the rapid accumulation of dysfunctional telomeres following conditional Rtel1 inactivation in telomerase positive cells was largely absent in telomerase negative Terc−/− cells (Figures S1C and 1D, 1E, and 1F). This result was confirmed in MAFs immortalized by SV40-LT (T1 and T2, and 2 other pairs not shown), as well as in two independently derived sets of primary MAFs (C3 and C4, and C5 and C6). Immortalized Terc−/− cells (T2) have a basal level of telomere loss even in the presence of RTEL1, but importantly this is not further increased upon RTEL1 inactivation. Moreover, primary Terc−/− cells (C3 and C4, and C5 and C6), which do not show telomere loss under basal conditions, do not accumulate dysfunctional telomeres upon RTEL1 depletion. In agreement, TCs, which accumulate in RTEL1-deficient cells concomitant with telomere shortening and loss, were induced in Rtel1f/fTerc+/+ cells but this accumulation was largely reduced in Rtel1f/fTerc−/− cells (Figures 1G and S1D). To determine whether inactivation of other telomerase components is capable of suppressing telomere dysfunction associated with loss of RTEL1, we generated CRISPR knockouts for both Terc and Tert genes in conditional Rtel1f/f MEFs. CRISPR induced deletions in Terc and Tert were analyzed by DNA sequence and loss of telomerase activity was confirmed using an established Telomeric Repeat Amplification Protocol (TRAP) (Tables S1; Figure S2A). In agreement with our previous results in MAF cells, MEFs lacking Terc or Tert did not show Rtel1 telomeric dysfunction after Cre infection when assessed for telomeric loss, telomeric fragility, or telomeric length heterogeneity (Figure 2A, 2B, and S2B). The fact that telomere lengths are comparable between Terc+/+, Terc−/−, and the CRISPR cell lines excludes the possibility that telomere shortening in the absence of telomerase is responsible for rescuing the deleterious effects of RTEL1 deficiency (Figures S1E and S2C).Figure 2Deletion of Terc or Tert Prevents Telomere Dysfunction and Suppresses SLX4 Recruitment to TelomeresShow full caption(A and B) Quantification of telomere loss (A) and telomere fragility (B) per metaphase in cells of the indicated genotype 96 hr after Ad-GFP or Ad-Cre infection.

To further confirm that the lack of telomeric dysfunction in the Rtel1−/−Terc−/− and Rtel1−/− Terc CRISPR cells is due to Terc inactivation, we re-expressed Terc RNA in these cells (Figure 2C, S2D, and S2F). Restoring Terc RNA expression to Rtel1−/−Terc−/− cells or to Rtel1−/− Terc CRISPR cells through expression of a Terc transgene resulted in the reappearance of telomeric loss, telomeric fragility, and telomeric length heterogeneity following Rtel1 inactivation (Figures 2D, 2E, S2E, S2G, S2H, and S2I). Our observations raised the possibility that telomerase is important for the accumulation of SLX1/4 at telomeres in RTEL1-null cells, which processes persistent t-loops (Vannier et al., 2012Vannier J.B. Pavicic-Kaltenbrunner V. Petalcorin M.I. Ding H. Boulton S.J. RTEL1 dismantles T loops and counteracts telomeric G4-DNA to maintain telomere integrity.Cell. 2012; 149: 795-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Indeed, telomerase positive Terc+/+ cells lacking RTEL1 showed a 5-fold increase in SLX4 foci that overlap with telomeres, when compared to Rtel1-proficient cells (Figures 2F and 2G). Conversely, the accumulation of SLX4 at telomeres was suppressed in telomerase negative Rtel1−/−Terc−/− cells. Hence, telomerase is necessary for the accumulation of the SLX1/4 nuclease complex at Rtel1-deficient telomeres. RTEL1’s role in cells is not limited to telomere maintenance but also extends to global DNA replication (Vannier et al., 2013Vannier J.B. Sandhu S. Petalcorin M.I. Wu X. Nabi Z. Ding H. Boulton S.J. RTEL1 is a replisome-associated helicase that promotes telomere and genome-wide replication.Science. 2013; 342: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar); we asked whether telomerase also suppresses the non-telomeric phenotypes associated with Rtel1 deficiency. To this end, we examined the levels of 53BP1 foci as a readout of spontaneous DNA damage and assessed replication dynamics by aphidicolin treatment and DNA combing. Non-telomere-associated 53BP1 foci were elevated in both immortalized and primary Rtel1−/−Terc+/+ and Rtel1−/−Terc−/− cells, suggesting that induction of spontaneous DNA damage following loss of RTEL1 occurs independently of telomerase status (Figure 3A). Consistent with a previous report, Rtel1−/− Terc+/+ cells exhibited sensitivity to aphidicolin treatment when compared to Rtel1-proficient cells (Uringa et al., 2012Uringa E.J. Lisaingo K. Pickett H.A. Brind'Amour J. Rohde J.H. Zelensky A. Essers J. Lansdorp P.M. RTEL1 contributes to DNA replication and repair and telomere maintenance.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2012; 23: 2782-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar; Figure 3B). Importantly, Rtel1−/− Terc−/− cells displayed a similar level of aphidicolin sensitivity to telomerase positive Rtel1−/− Terc+/+ cells, suggesting that Terc deletion does not influence the global replication defects associated with Rtel1 inactivation. In support of this conclusion, DNA combing revealed that the reduced replication fork extension rates and increased fork asymmetry observed following Rtel1 inactivation occur irrespective of telomerase status: Rtel1−/− Terc+/+ and Rtel1−/−Terc−/− cells both exhibited reduced replication fork speeds when compared to Rtel1-proficient cells (Rtel1+/+ 1.597 kb/min versus Rtel1−/−Terc+/+ 1.095 kb/min and Rtel1−/−Terc−/− 1.085 kb/min) (Figure 3C). Similarly, the accumulation of asymmetric replication forks observed in Rtel1-deficient cells, which reflect increased fork stalling and/or collapse, occurs irrespective of telomerase status (Rtel1+/+ cells 3.57% asymmetric DNA tracts versus Rtel1−/−Terc+/+ 67.85% and Rtel1−/−Terc−/− 64.29%; Figure 3D). These results establish that suppression of the Rtel1 phenotype by telomerase inactivation does not extend to the role of RTEL1 during global DNA replication. We considered two possibilities that could account for why the presence of telomerase could result in telomere dysfunction in RTEL1-deficient cells: (1) telomerase is corrupted by loss of Rtel1 and this interferes with telomere biogenesis, or (2) telomerase inappropriately binds to and stabilizes DNA secondary structures at the telomere that are normally removed by RTEL1. The first of these possibilities is unlikely, as telomerase activity is comparable between Rtel1-proficient and -deficient cells (Figure S3A). We therefore focused our attention on the second hypothesis and sought to determine whether telomerase abnormally engages with telomeres when telomeric DNA secondary structures are not properly dismantled. A recent study has defined two distinct populations of telomerase transiently engaging with telomeres (Schmidt et al., 2016Schmidt J.C. Zaug A.J. Cech T.R. Live cell imaging reveals the dynamics of telomerase recruitment to telomeres.Cell. 2016; 166: 1188-1197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), which are believed to reflect: (1) short-lived but frequent interactions with TPP1 that are not associated with the 3′ overhang at the chromosome end, and (2) long static interactions with the 3′ overhang that are productive for telomere extension but are very rare. To examine telomerase recruitment to telomeres in Rtel1-proficient and -deficient cells, we conducted proximity ligation assays (PLAs) to detect close proximity interactions between the TERT subunit of telomerase and the Shelterin protein TRF1. In Rtel1-proficient cells, PLA between endogenous TERT and TRF1 is an infrequent event, consistent with the low abundance and transient nature of telomerase binding to telomeres in wild-type cells (Figures 4A and 4B ). In contrast, a 4-fold increase in PLA signal for TERT and TRF1 was detected in Rtel1-deficient cells when compared to controls cells (Figures 4A and 4B). We also detected a robust PLA signal between TERT and TRF2 in Rtel1-deficient cells, but not in control cells (Figures S3B and S3C). A significant increase in Terc RNA coincident with telomeres was observed by RNAscope in Rtel1-deficient cells, but not in Rtel1−/−Terc−/− cells (Figures S3D and S3E). These data reveal that telomerase binds abnormally to telomeres in the absence of RTEL1. Since telomerase recruitment to telomeres requires the shelterin component TPP1, as well as DKC1 and TCAB1 (Wrap53 in mice) (Zhong et al., 2012Zhong F.L. Batista L.F. Freund A. Pech M.F. Venteicher A.S. Artandi S.E. TPP1 OB-fold domain controls telomere maintenance by recruiting telomerase to chromosome ends.Cell. 2012; 150: 481-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), we asked what would happen to Rtel1-deficient telomeres if we blocked telomerase recruitment. Strikingly, downregulation of Tpp1, Dkc1, or Wrap53 (Figures S4B and S4C) abolished the rapid accumulation of dysfunctional telomeres following Rtel1 inactivation (Figures 4C, 4D, and S4A). Furthermore, treating Rtel1f/f cells with GRN163L, which inhibits telomerase recruitment to telomeres (Asai et al., 2003Asai A. Oshima Y. Yamamoto Y. Uochi T.A. Kusaka H. Akinaga S. Yamashita Y.

This poses a problem, as such small molecules are excellent sources of potential pharmaceuticals, pretested by nature for animal compatibility. We discovered anti-HIV compounds from small, marine tunicates from the Eastern Fields of Papua New Guinea. Tunicates are a reservoir for new bioactive chemicals, yet their small size often impedes identification or even detection of the chemicals within. We solved this problem by combining chemistry, metagenomics, and synthetic biology to directly identify and synthesize the natural products. We show that these anti-HIV compounds, the divamides, are a novel family of lanthipeptides produced by symbiotic bacteria living in the tunicate. Neighboring animal colonies contain structurally related divamides that differ starkly in their biological properties, suggesting a role for biosynthetic plasticity in a native context wherein biological interactions take place."
https://openalex.org/W2780663388,"Telomerase maintains chromosome ends from humans to yeasts. Recruitment of yeast telomerase to telomeres occurs through its Ku and Est1 subunits via independent interactions with telomerase RNA (TLC1) and telomeric proteins Sir4 and Cdc13, respectively. However, the structures of the molecules comprising these telomerase-recruiting pathways remain unknown. Here, we report crystal structures of the Ku heterodimer and Est1 complexed with their key binding partners. Two major findings are as follows: (1) Ku specifically binds to telomerase RNA in a distinct, yet related, manner to how it binds DNA; and (2) Est1 employs two separate pockets to bind distinct motifs of Cdc13. The N-terminal Cdc13-binding site of Est1 cooperates with the TLC1-Ku-Sir4 pathway for telomerase recruitment, whereas the C-terminal interface is dispensable for binding Est1 in vitro yet is nevertheless essential for telomere maintenance in vivo. Overall, our results integrate previous models and provide fundamentally valuable structural information regarding telomere biology."

We found increased power and phase synchrony in the theta range during aversive conditioning. The synchrony was linked to single-unit spiking and exhibited specific directionality between input and output measures in each region. Although it was correlated with the magnitude of conditioned responses, it declined once the association stabilized. The results suggest that amygdala spikes help to synchronize ACC activity and transfer error signal information to support memory formation."
https://openalex.org/W2777661401,"Catalytic cross-metathesis is a central transformation in chemistry, yet corresponding methods for the stereoselective generation of acyclic trisubstituted alkenes in either the E or the Z isomeric forms are not known. The key problems are a lack of chemoselectivity—namely, the preponderance of side reactions involving only the less hindered starting alkene, resulting in homo-metathesis by-products—and the formation of short-lived methylidene complexes. By contrast, in catalytic cross-coupling, substrates are more distinct and homocoupling is less of a problem. Here we show that through cross-metathesis reactions involving E- or Z-trisubstituted alkenes, which are easily prepared from commercially available starting materials by cross-coupling reactions, many desirable and otherwise difficult-to-access linear E- or Z-trisubstituted alkenes can be synthesized efficiently and in exceptional stereoisomeric purity (up to 98 per cent E or 95 per cent Z). The utility of the strategy is demonstrated by the concise stereoselective syntheses of biologically active compounds, such as the antifungal indiacen B and the anti-inflammatory coibacin D. An approach for the synthesis of E- and Z- trisubstituted alkenes in high stereoisomeric purity is developed by merging catalytic cross-metathesis and cross-coupling processes. Alkene metathesis is a ubiquitous transformation in organic chemistry, as well as in the manufacture of polymers. In the past few years, key advances have been made in achieving high levels of stereoselectivity in certain classes of substrate. However, no general method for the preparation of trisubstituted alkenes is yet available. Here, Amir Hoveyda, Richard Schrock and colleagues report the synthesis of both E- and Z-trisubstituted alkenes with high stereoselectivity by merging cross-coupling and cross-metathesis. Easy-to-access substrates are used to prepare more complex and challenging E- or Z-trisubstituted alkenes. In many cases, the products are vinyl halides, so have a functional handle with which to react further. This is used to good effect in the synthesis of an antifungal and an anti-inflammatory compound."
https://openalex.org/W2780609832,"In the mammalian brain, auditory information is known to be processed along a central ascending pathway leading to auditory cortex (AC). Whether there exist any major pathways beyond this canonical auditory neuraxis remains unclear. In awake mice, we found that auditory responses in entorhinal cortex (EC) cannot be explained by a previously proposed relay from AC based on response properties. By combining anatomical tracing and optogenetic/pharmacological manipulations, we discovered that EC received auditory input primarily from the medial septum (MS), rather than AC. A previously uncharacterized auditory pathway was then revealed: it branched from the cochlear nucleus, and via caudal pontine reticular nucleus, pontine central gray, and MS, reached EC. Neurons along this non-canonical auditory pathway responded selectively to high-intensity broadband noise, but not pure tones. Disruption of the pathway resulted in an impairment of specifically noise-cued fear conditioning. This reticular-limbic pathway may thus function in processing aversive acoustic signals."

https://openalex.org/W2780143664,"Super-massive black holes, with masses larger than a million times that of the Sun, appear to inhabit the centers of all massive galaxies. Cosmologically-motivated theories of galaxy formation need feedback from these super-massive black holes to regulate star formation. In the absence of such feedback, state-of-the-art numerical simulations dramatically fail to reproduce the number density and properties of massive galaxies in the local Universe. However, there is no observational evidence of this strongly coupled co-evolution between super-massive black holes and star formation, impeding our understanding of baryonic processes within galaxies. Here we show that the star formation histories (SFHs) of nearby massive galaxies, as measured from their integrated optical spectra, depend on the mass of the central super-massive black hole. Our results suggest that black hole mass growth scales with gas cooling rate in the early Universe. The subsequent quenching of star formation takes place earlier and more efficiently in galaxies hosting more massive central black holes. The observed relation between black hole mass and star formation efficiency applies to all generations of stars formed throughout a galaxy's life, revealing a continuous interplay between black hole activity and baryon cooling."
https://openalex.org/W2778937553,"Sensorimotor integration regulates goal-directed movements. We study the signaling mechanisms underlying sensorimotor integration in C. elegans during olfactory steering, when the sinusoidal movements of the worm generate an in-phase oscillation in the concentration of the sampled odorant. We show that cholinergic neurotransmission encodes the oscillatory sensory response and the motor state of head undulations by acting through an acetylcholine-gated channel and a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, respectively. These signals converge on two axonal domains of an interneuron RIA, where the sensory-evoked signal suppresses the motor-encoding signal to transform the spatial information of the odorant into the asymmetry between the axonal activities. The asymmetric synaptic outputs of the RIA axonal domains generate a directional bias in the locomotory trajectory. Experience alters the sensorimotor integration to generate specific behavioral changes. Our study reveals how cholinergic neurotransmission, which can represent sensory and motor information in the mammalian brain, regulates sensorimotor integration during goal-directed locomotions."

We found that despite excellent agreement of estimates mean and variability with a Basic Bayesian observer model, the estimate distributions were bimodal with unpredicted modes near the prior and the likelihood. We developed a model that switched between prior and sensory evidence rather than integrating the two, which better explained the data than the Basic and several other Bayesian observers. Our data suggest that humans can approximate Bayesian optimality with a switching heuristic that forgoes multiplicative combination of priors and likelihoods."
https://openalex.org/W2776773903,"The contribution of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) to metabolic disorder and obesity, independent of high fat, energy-rich diets, is controversial. While high-fat diets are widely accepted as a rodent model of diet-induced obesity (DIO) and metabolic disorder, the value of HFCS alone as a rodent model of DIO is unclear. Impaired dopamine function is associated with obesity and high fat diet, but the effect of HFCS on the dopamine system has not been investigated. The objective of this study was to test the effect of HFCS on weight gain, glucose regulation, and evoked dopamine release using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. Mice (C57BL/6) received either water or 10% HFCS solution in combination with ad libitum chow for 15 weeks. HFCS consumption with chow diet did not induce weight gain compared to water, chow-only controls but did induce glucose dysregulation and reduced evoked dopamine release in the dorsolateral striatum. These data show that HFCS can contribute to metabolic disorder and altered dopamine function independent of weight gain and high-fat diets."

However, the relationship between POD and postoperative physical frailty and the effect of both on long-term clinical outcomes have not been fully explored.We aimed to examine the associations among POD, postoperative frailty, and major adverse cardiac events (MACE).This was a prospective cohort study.We studied 329 consecutive patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. The intensive care delirium screening checklist was used to assess POD. Postoperative frailty was defined by handgrip strength and walking speed. Patients were subsequently followed-up to detect MACE.POD was present in 13.2%, while the incidence of postoperative frailty was 27.0%. POD was independently associated with development of postoperative frailty (adjusted odds ratio = 2.98). During follow-up, MACE occurred in 14.1% of all participants. On multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis, POD (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 3.36), postoperative frailty (HR = 2.21), postoperative complications (HR = 1.54), and left ventricular ejection fraction (HR = 0.95) were independently associated with increased risk of MACE.It is a single-center study with a risk of bias. We did not investigate follow up cognitive function.POD was a predictor of postoperative frailty after cardiac surgery. Both postoperative frailty and POD were associated with the incidence of MACE, while POD was the stronger predictor of MACE.

https://openalex.org/W2779970637,"Heat acclimation in rats is associated with enhanced neurogenesis in thermoregulatory centers of the hypothalamus. To elucidate the mechanisms for heat acclimation, we investigated the effects of direct mild heat exposure on the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs/NPCs). The NSCs/NPCs isolated from forebrain cortices of 14.5-day-old rat fetuses were propagated as neurospheres at either 37.0°C (control) or 38.5°C (mild heat exposure) for four days, and the effects on proliferation were investigated by MTS cell viability assay, measurement of neurosphere diameter, and counting the total number of cells. The mRNA expressions of heat shock proteins (HSPs) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cAMP response element-binding (CREB) protein and Akt phosphorylation levels, and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were analyzed using real time PCR, Western blotting and CM-H2DCFDA assay respectively. Heat exposure under proliferation condition increased NSC/NPC viability, neurosphere diameter, and cell count. BDNF mRNA expression, CREB phosphorylation, and ROS level were also increased by heat exposure. Heat exposure increased HSP27 mRNA expression concomitant with enhanced p-Akt level. Moreover, treatment with LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor) abolished the effects of heat exposure on NSC/NPC proliferation. Furthermore, heat exposure under differentiation conditions increased the proportion of cells positive for Tuj1 (a neuronal marker). These findings suggest that mild heat exposure increases NSC/NPC proliferation, possibly through activation of the Akt pathway, and also enhances neuronal differentiation. Direct effects of temperature on NSCs/NPCs may be one of the mechanisms involved in hypothalamic neurogenesis in heat-acclimated rats. Such heat-induced neurogenesis could also be an effective therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases."

We demonstrate that surgical timing has a significant impact on survival in MSCC patients treated with palliative decompression.Eighty-nine consecutive MSCC patients at a tertiary referral medical center were enrolled between January 2012 and February 2016. Wide laminectomy was performed for tumors invading the vertebral body. Debulking surgery was done for tumors damaging the posterior column of the spine. Patient records were retrospectively analyzed.Better survival was observed in patients with preoperative intact motor function (Group A, n = 37) than in those with motor deficit (Group B, n = 52, p = 0.0031). In Group B, survival was better in those who underwent surgery within 7 days of motor deficit onset than in those who underwent surgery 7 days after onset (p = 0.0444) and in postoperative ambulant patients than in nonambulant patients (p = 0.0120). In Group B, Frankel grade improved in patients who underwent surgery within 48 h than in those who underwent surgery after 48 h (p = 0.0992). Group A patients had a shorter hospital stay and higher revised Tokuhashi score than Group B patients. Overall survival was better in patients with a lower Tomita score (≤5, p = 0.0012), higher revised Tokuhashi score (≥9, p = 0.0009), better preoperative Frankel grade (p < 0.0001), and younger age (≤55 years, p = 0.0179). There were no significant differences in age, sex, tumor type, involved vertebrae level, Tomita score, intraoperative blood loss, operation time, incidence of infection, and postoperative complications between groups.We can improve the survival of MSCC patients with palliative decompression before motor deficits occur. After motor deficit onset, survival can still be improved with surgery within 7 days. Overall survival was better in patients aged ≤55 years."
https://openalex.org/W2776827574,"Dysfunctional processing of traumatic events may be in particular related to high trait anxiety as a pre-traumatic risk factor for the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, as this has rarely been investigated in prospective, experimental studies, we aimed to analyse the association between high trait anxiety and affective as well as cognitive processing of stress using a new prospective Virtual Reality analogue trauma paradigm to overcome limitations of retrospective or current analogue designs. Individuals with high and low trait anxiety (N = 80) were exposed to a multi-sensory Virtual Reality emergency scenario while psychophysiological stress response, emotion regulation and intrusive memories were assessed. Our results showed that high trait anxiety individuals display increased (i) subjective stress responses, (ii) emotion dysregulation and (iii) intrusive memories upon VR analogue trauma exposure. In particular, our sample of high trait anxiety individuals displayed limited access to different emotion regulation strategies as well as increased worry and rumination regarding perceived intrusive memories. Considering the complex interplay of multiple risk factors, our findings suggests that peri-traumatic affective processing seems to mediate high trait anxiety and post-traumatic intrusive memories thereby pointing out the central role of peri-traumatic processes for intrusion development. In addition, HA as a modulating pre-traumatic risk factor might further increase the risk of later dysfunctional processing of an analogue trauma by interacting with factors of affective processing during analogue trauma exposure. Implications of these findings which may contribute to a higher risk to develop PTSD are discussed."

To contribute to the knowledge of the adult P. spumarius chemoreceptivity, electroantennographic (EAG) responses of both sexes to 50 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including aliphatic aldehydes, alcohols, esters, and ketones, terpenoids, and aromatics were recorded. Measurable EAG responses were elicited by all compounds tested. In both sexes, octanal, 2-octanol, 2-decanone, (E)-2-hexenyl acetate, and vanillin elicited the strongest antennal amplitude within the chemical groups of aliphatic saturated aldehydes, aliphatic alcohols, aliphatic acetates and aromatics, respectively. Male and female EAG responses to sulcatol, (±)linalool, and sulcatone were higher than those to other terpenoinds. In both sexes, the weakest antennal stimulants were phenethyl alcohol and 2-pentanone. Sexual differences in the EAG amplitude were found only for four of test compounds suggesting a general similarity between males and females in antennal sensitivity. The olfactory system of both sexes proved to be sensitive to changes in stimulus concentration, carbon chain length, and compound structure. Compounds with short carbon chain length (C5—C6) elicited lower EAG amplitudes than compounds with higher carbon chain length (C9—C10) in all classes of aliphatic hydrocarbons with different functional groups.

One in five maternal deaths, globally, are from Nigeria.This study aimed to assess the sociocultural correlates of maternal mortality in Nigeria.We conducted a retrospective analysis of nationally representative data from the 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey. The analysis was based on responses from the core women's questionnaire. Maternal mortality was categorized as 'yes' for any death while pregnant, during delivery or two months after delivery (as reported by the sibling), and 'no' for deaths of other or unknown causes. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was conducted to test for association between maternal mortality and predictor variables of sociocultural status (educational attainment, community women's education, region, type of residence, religion, and women's empowerment).Region, Religion, and the level of community women's education were independently associated with maternal mortality. Women in the North West were more than twice as likely to report maternal mortality (OR: 2.14; 95% CI: 1.42-3.23) compared to those in the North Central region. Muslim women were 52% more likely to report maternal deaths (OR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.10-2.11) compared to Christian women. Respondents living in communities where a significant proportion of women have at least secondary schooling were 33% less likely to report that their sisters died of pregnancy-related causes (OR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.48-0.95).Efforts to reduce maternal mortality should implement tailored programs that address barriers to health-seeking behavior influenced by cultural beliefs and attitudes, and low educational attainment. Strategies to improve women's agency should be at the core of these programs; they are essential for reducing maternal mortality and achieving sustainable development goals towards gender equality. Future studies should develop empirically evaluated measures which assess, and further investigate the association between women's empowerment and maternal health status and outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2779765201,"Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a previously identified modification of Viennese method of perineal protection remains most effective for reduction of perineal tension in cases with substantially smaller or larger fetal heads. Methods A previously designed finite element model was used to compare perineal tension of different modifications of the Viennese method of perineal protection to ""hands-off"" technique for three different sizes of the fetal head. Quantity and extent of tension throughout the perineal body during vaginal delivery at the time when the suboccipito-bregmatic circumference passes between the fourchette and the lower margin of the pubis was determined. Results The order of effectiveness of different modifications of manual perineal protection was similar for all three sizes of fetal head. The reduction of perineal tension was most significant in delivery simulations with larger heads. The final position of fingers 2cm anteriorly from the fourchette (y = +2) consistently remains most effective in reducing the tension. The extent of finger movement along the anterior-posterior (y-axis) contributes to the effectiveness of manual perineal protection. Conclusion Appropriately performed Viennese manual perineal protection seems to reduce the perineal tension regardless of the fetal head size, and thus the method seems to be applicable to reduce risk of perineal trauma for all parturients."
https://openalex.org/W2781118089,"Background Various immune-mediated diseases are associated with increased malignancy risks. However, the relationship between Behçet’s disease (BD) and cancer remains unclear. We conducted a nationwide, population-based study to determine the risk of cancer in patients with BD. Methods Using National Health Insurance claims records, we collected data from 2402 patients diagnosed with BD between 2013 and 2014. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of overall and site-specific cancers in patients with BD in comparison with the general population were calculated. Results The risks of overall cancer (SIR, 3.54; 95% confidence interval, 2.35–5.11 in men and 2.17; 1.58–2.92 in women) and solid cancer (3.10; 1.94–4.69 in men and 2.13; 1.52–2.90 in women) were greater in patients with BD than in the general population. There were significantly increased risks for these solid cancers: colorectal (4.26; 1.38–9.94), liver (4.00; 1.09–10.25), bone/articular cartilage (55.66; 1.41–310.14), prostate (7.05; 1.45–20.60), and brain/central nervous system (28.32; 3.43–102.31) in men; and the lips/oral cavity/pharynx (13.97, 1.69–50.47), liver (12.78; 5.14–26.33), lungs (4.35; 1.18–11.13), other female genital organs (53.57; 1.36–298.49), and eyes (128.26; 3.24–714.59) in women. Patients with BD had a greater risk of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) than the general population did (65.72; 7.96–237.41 in men and 53.86; 11.11–157.40 in women), but not of hematological cancer. Conclusions Compared to the general population, Korean patients with BD had greater risks of overall cancer, some solid cancers, and MDS, but not of hematological cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2779920959,"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), the discrete genome which encodes subunits of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, is present at highly variable copy numbers across cell types. Though severe mtDNA depletion dramatically reduces mitochondrial function, the impact of tissue-specific mtDNA reduction remains debated. Previously, our lab identified reduced mtDNA quantity in the putamen of Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients who had developed L-DOPA Induced Dyskinesia (LID), compared to PD patients who had not developed LID and healthy subjects. Here, we present the consequences of mtDNA depletion by ethidium bromide (EtBr) treatment on the bioenergetic function of primary cultured neurons, astrocytes and neuron-enriched cocultures from rat striatum. We report that EtBr inhibition of mtDNA replication and transcription consistently reduces mitochondrial oxygen consumption, and that neurons are significantly more sensitive to EtBr than astrocytes. EtBr also increases glycolytic activity in astrocytes, whereas in neurons it reduces the expression of mitochondrial creatine kinase mRNA and levels of phosphocreatine. Further, we show that mitochondrial creatine kinase mRNA is similarly downregulated in dyskinetic PD patients, compared to both non-dyskinetic PD patients and healthy subjects. Our data support a hypothesis that reduced striatal mtDNA contributes to energetic dysregulation in the dyskinetic striatum by destabilizing the energy buffering system of the phosphocreatine/creatine shuttle."
https://openalex.org/W2777319199,"Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) was recently described as an independent risk factor of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, the main respiratory sequelae of preterm birth. We previously showed impaired alveolarization in rat pups born with IUGR induced by a low-protein diet (LPD) during gestation. We conducted a genome-wide analysis of gene expression and found the involvement of several pathways such as cell adhesion. Here, we describe our unbiased microRNA (miRNA) profiling by microarray assay and validation by qPCR at postnatal days 10 and 21 (P10 and P21) in lungs of rat pups with LPD-induced lung-alveolarization disorder after IUGR. We identified 13 miRNAs with more than two-fold differential expression between control lungs and LPD-induced IUGR lungs. Validated and predicted target genes of these miRNAs were related to “tissue repair” at P10 and “cellular communication regulation” at P21. We predicted the deregulation of several genes associated with these pathways. Especially, E2F3, a transcription factor involved in cell cycle control, was expressed in developing alveoli, and its mRNA and protein levels were significantly increased at P21 after IUGR. Hence, IUGR affects the expression of selected miRNAs during lung alveolarization. These results provide a basis for deciphering the mechanistic contributions of IUGR to impaired alveolarization."
https://openalex.org/W2780128349,"Leymus chinensis (Trin.) is the dominant vegetation type in eastern Eurasian temperate grasslands but is decreasing due to the combined pressure of reduced precipitation and overgrazing. This study evaluated the separate and combined effects of precipitation and defoliation on net primary productivity (NPP) and composition of a L. chinensis steppe to promote the sustainable development of temperate grasslands through improved management practices. The effects of three precipitation gradients (precipitation unchanged, reduced by 50%, and increased by 50%) and two clipping intensities (clipping once or twice per year) were examined on NPP and composition of the L. chinensis community using a 7-year in situ controlled trial at the Guyuan State Key Monitoring and Research Station of Grassland Ecosystem in China. The results showed that: (1) a 50% reduction in natural precipitation significantly decreased NPP; a 50% increase in precipitation did not significantly increase NPP, but it decreased the importance value of L. chinensis because more water promoted the growth of competing species. (2) Clipping twice per year increased NPP, but the increase was from the dry matter of other species (DMO) component, and not from the dry matter of L. chinensis. (3) The standardized coefficients of a regression model (β) for DMO, NPP, and the importance value of L. chinensis were 0.685, 0.532, and −0.608 for precipitation, and 0.369, 0.419, and −0.276 for clipping mode, respectively. This study demonstrated that variation in precipitationis the key driver of NPP and composition of a L. chinensis steppe under the precipitation range and clipping intensities evaluated. This improved understanding of the effects of precipitation and clipping on NPP and composition will allow for improved, sustainable management of L. chinensis temperate grassland steppes."
https://openalex.org/W2780841987,"Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is a sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain. In cartilage, CS plays important roles as the main component of the extracellular matrix (ECM), existing as side chains of the major cartilage proteoglycan, aggrecan. Six glycosyltransferases are known to coordinately synthesize the backbone structure of CS; however, their in vivo synthetic mechanism remains unknown. Previous studies have suggested that two glycosyltransferases, Csgalnact1 (t1) and Csgalnact2 (t2), are critical for initiation of CS synthesis in vitro. Indeed, t1 single knockout mice (t1 KO) exhibit slight dwarfism and a reduction in CS content in cartilage compared with wild-type (WT) mice. To reveal the synergetic roles of t1 and t2 in CS synthesis in vivo, we generated systemic single and double knockout (DKO) mice and cartilage-specific t1 and t2 double knockout (Col2-DKO) mice. DKO mice exhibited postnatal lethality, whereas t2 KO mice showed normal size and skeletal development. Col2-DKO mice survived to adulthood and showed severe dwarfism compared with t1 KO mice. Histological analysis of epiphyseal cartilage from Col2-DKO mice revealed disrupted endochondral ossification, characterized by drastic GAG reduction in the ECM. Moreover, DKO cartilage had reduced chondrocyte proliferation and an increased number of apoptotic chondrocytes compared with WT cartilage. Conversely, primary chondrocyte cultures from Col2-DKO knee cartilage had the same proliferation rate as WT chondrocytes and low GAG expression levels, indicating that the chondrocytes themselves had an intact proliferative ability. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of E18.5 cartilage showed that the expression levels of Col2a1 and Ptch1 transcripts tended to decrease in DKO compared with those in WT mice. The CS content in DKO cartilage was decreased compared with that in t1 KO cartilage but was not completely absent. These results suggest that aberrant ECM caused by CS reduction disrupted endochondral ossification. Overall, we propose that both t1 and t2 are necessary for CS synthesis and normal chondrocyte differentiation but are not sufficient for all CS synthesis in cartilage."
https://openalex.org/W2776196143,"Objective Cartilage homeostasis relies on a balance of catabolism and anabolism of cartilage matrix. Our goal was to evaluate the burden of radiographic osteoarthritis and serum levels of type IIA procollagen amino terminal propeptide (sPIIANP), a biomarker representing type II collagen synthesis, in osteoarthritis. Methods OA burden was quantified on the basis of radiographic features as total joint faces with an osteophyte, joint space narrowing, or in the spine, disc space narrowing. sPIIANP was measured in 1,235 participants from the Genetics of Generalized Osteoarthritis study using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Separate multivariable linear regression models, adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index and additionally for ipsilateral osteophytes or joint/disc space narrowing, were used to assess the independent association of sPIIANP with osteophytes and with joint/disc space narrowing burden in knees, hips, hands and spine, individually and together. Results After full adjustment, sPIIANP was significantly associated with a lesser burden of hip joint space narrowing and knee osteophytes. sPIIANP was associated with a lesser burden of hand joint space narrowing but a greater burden of hand osteophytes; these results were only evident upon adjustment for osteoarthritic features in all other joints. There were no associations of sPIIANP and features of spine osteoarthritis. Conclusions Higher cartilage collagen synthesis, as reflected in systemic PIIANP concentrations, was associated with lesser burden of osteoarthritic features in lower extremity joints (knees and hips), even accounting for osteoarthritis burden in hands and spine, age, sex and body mass index. These results suggest that pro-anabolic agents may be appropriate for early treatment to prevent severe lower extremity large joint osteoarthritis."
https://openalex.org/W2778942319,"The response of the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) to changing global temperatures is a key component of sea-level projections. Current projections of the AIS contribution to sea-level changes are deeply uncertain. This deep uncertainty stems, in part, from (i) the inability of current models to fully resolve key processes and scales, (ii) the relatively sparse available data, and (iii) divergent expert assessments. One promising approach to characterizing the deep uncertainty stemming from divergent expert assessments is to combine expert assessments, observations, and simple models by coupling probabilistic inversion and Bayesian inversion. Here, we present a proof-of-concept study that uses probabilistic inversion to fuse a simple AIS model and diverse expert assessments. We demonstrate the ability of probabilistic inversion to infer joint prior probability distributions of model parameters that are consistent with expert assessments. We then confront these inferred expert priors with instrumental and paleoclimatic observational data in a Bayesian inversion. These additional constraints yield tighter hindcasts and projections. We use this approach to quantify how the deep uncertainty surrounding expert assessments affects the joint probability distributions of model parameters and future projections."
https://openalex.org/W2779316814,"Diabetes affects mortality and cognitive functioning. It is not known how diabetes influences life expectancy (LE) with and without cognitive impairment. We seek to examine age at onset of cognitive impairment and life expectancy (LE) with and without cognitive impairment by diabetes status among middle- and older-aged Americans. Data come from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study 2000–2012 linked to the National Death Index (N = 13,687). We use multinomial regression models stratified by gender and controlling for age, education and race/ethnicity to estimate diabetes-status specific transition probabilities, then use a Markov chain matrix population model to calculate age at onset of cognitive impairment and LE with and without cognitive impairment by diabetes status at age 50. LE at age 50 was 27.6 (men) and 32.1 (women). From age 50, those with diabetes had a first incidence of cognitive impairment 3 (men) and 4 (women) years earlier than those without. Diabetes reduced total LE by 5–7 years and cognitively healthy LE by 4–6 years. Those with diabetes lived one year less in a cognitively impaired state than those without. Over 80% of the lower LE associated with diabetes is attributable to the loss of cognitively-healthy years. Those with diabetes have a shorter LE with cognitive impairment because of higher mortality. In analyses by educational attainment, education was strongly protective of cognitive health, yet diabetes was associated with lower age of cognitive impairment onset and fewer cognitive healthy years lived in all educational groups. The excess mortality because of diabetes may be decreasing. If the mortality decline is not coupled with a comparable decline in the risk of cognitive impairment, the population level burden of impaired cognition may grow larger."
https://openalex.org/W2779733582,"Oxalis pes-caprae L. is a South African geophyte that behaves as an invasive in the eurimediterranean area. According to a long-established hypothesis, O. pes-caprae may have invaded Europe and the Mediterranean area starting from a single plant introduced in the Botanical Garden of Malta at the beginning of the 19th century. The aim of this work was to test this hypothesis, to track the arrival of O. pes-caprae in different countries of the Euro-Mediterranean area and to understand the pathways of spreading and particularly its starting point(s). Historical data attesting the presence of the plant in the whole Euro-Mediterranean region were collected from different sources: herbarium specimens, Floras and other botanical papers, plant lists of gardens, catalogs of plant nurseries and plant dealers. First records of the plant (both cultivated and wild) for each Territorial Unit (3rd level of NUTS) were selected and used to draw up a diachronic map and an animated graphic. Both documents clearly show that oldest records are scattered throughout the whole area, proving that the plant arrived in Europe and in the Mediterranean region more times independently and that its spreading started in different times from several different centers of invasion. Botanical gardens and other public or private gardens, nurseries and plant dealers, and above all seaside towns and harbors seemingly played a strategic role as a source of either intentional and unintentional introduction or spread. A geographic profiling analysis was performed to analyse the data. We used also techniques (Silhouette, Kmeans and Voronoi tessellation) capable of verifying the presence of more than one independent clusters of data on the basis of their geographical distribution. Microsatellites were employed for a preliminary analysis of genetic variation in the Mediterranean. Even if the sampling was insufficient, particularly among the populations of the original area, our data supported three main groups of populations, one of them corresponding to the central group of populations identified by GP analysis, and the other two corresponding, respectively, to the western and the eastern cluster of data. The most probable areas of origin of the invasion in the three clusters of observations are characterized by the presence of localities where the invasive plant was cultivated, with the exception of the Iberian cluster of observation where the observations in the field predate the data about known cultivation localities. Alternative possible reasons are also suggested, to explain the current prevalence of pentaploid short-styled plants in the Euro-Mediterranean area."
https://openalex.org/W2780466153,"The equal headway instability-the fact that a configuration with regular time intervals between vehicles tends to be volatile-is a common regulation problem in public transportation systems. An unsatisfactory regulation results in low efficiency and possible collapses of the service. Computational simulations have shown that self-organizing methods can regulate the headway adaptively beyond the theoretical optimum. In this work, we develop a computer simulation for metro systems fed with real data from the Mexico City Metro to test the current regulatory method with a novel self-organizing approach. The current model considers overall system's data such as minimum and maximum waiting times at stations, while the self-organizing method regulates the headway in a decentralized manner using local information such as the passenger's inflow and the positions of neighboring trains. The simulation shows that the self-organizing method improves the performance over the current one as it adapts to environmental changes at the timescale they occur. The correlation between the simulation of the current model and empirical observations carried out in the Mexico City Metro provides a base to calculate the expected performance of the self-organizing method in case it is implemented in the real system. We also performed a pilot study at the Balderas station to regulate the alighting and boarding of passengers through guide signs on platforms. The analysis of empirical data shows a delay reduction of the waiting time of trains at stations. Finally, we provide recommendations to improve public transportation systems."

This report is to present proof of concept for nanoparticle dependent cartilage barrier imaging in a large animal model including the use of clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Conditioned (following matrix depletion) and unconditioned porcine metacarpophalangeal cartilage was evaluated on the basis of fluorophore conjugated 30 nm and 80 nm spherical gold nanoparticle permeation and multiphoton laser scanning and bright field microscopy after autometallographic particle enhancement. Consequently, conditioned and unconditioned joints underwent MRI pre- and post-injection with 12 nm superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) to evaluate particle permeation in the context of matrix depletion and use of a clinical 1.5 Tesla MRI scanner. To gauge the potential pro-inflammatory effect of intra-articular nanoparticle delivery co-cultures of equine synovium and cartilage tissue were exposed to an escalating dose of SPIONs and IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ and PGE2 were assessed in culture media. The chemotactic potential of growth media samples was subsequently assessed in transwell migration assays on isolated equine neutrophils. Results demonstrate an increase in MRI signal following conditioning of porcine joints which suggests that nanoparticle dependent compositional cartilage imaging is feasible. Tissue culture and neutrophil migration assays highlight a dose dependent inflammatory response following SPION exposure which at the imaging dose investigated was not different from controls. The preliminary safety and imaging data support the continued investigation of nanoparticle dependent compositional cartilage imaging. To our knowledge, this is the first report in using SPIONs as intra-articular MRI contrast agent for studying cartilage barrier function, which could potentially lead to a new diagnostic technique for early detection of cartilage disease."
https://openalex.org/W2781152779,"India accounts for the highest number of maternal and child deaths globally. A large body of empirical research suggests that improvement in the coverage of institutional delivery is essential to reduce the burden of maternal and child death. However the dynamics of choice of place of delivery is poorly understood. Using qualitative survey data consisting of twelve focus group discussions, conducted in a rural setting of West Bengal, India, this study aims to understand the reasons behind preferring home or institution for delivery. Findings reveal that some women who underwent an institutional delivery preferred to deliver their baby at home. On the other hand, of women who delivered their baby at home, 60% wanted to deliver their babies in institutions but could not do so, primarily due to the unwillingness of family members and misreporting of the onset of true labour pain. With the help of Accredited Social Health Activists, the village level health workers, there is need for an intervention that focuses on educating household members (essentially targeting husbands and mother-in-laws) about birth preparedness, and identification of true labour pain."
https://openalex.org/W2776490122,"Heterochromatin formation in budding yeast is regulated by the silent information regulator (SIR) complex. The SIR complex comprises the NAD-dependent deacetylase Sir2, the scaffolding protein Sir4, and the nucleosome-binding protein Sir3. Transcriptionally active regions present a challenge to SIR complex-mediated de novo heterochromatic silencing due to the presence of antagonistic histone post-translational modifications, including acetylation and methylation. Methylation of histone H3K4 and H3K79 is dependent on monoubiquitination of histone H2B (H2B-Ub). The SIR complex cannot erase H2B-Ub or histone methylation on its own. The deubiquitinase (DUB) Ubp10 is thought to promote heterochromatic silencing by maintaining low H2B-Ub at sub-telomeres. Here, we biochemically characterized the interactions between Ubp10 and the SIR complex machinery. We demonstrate that a direct interaction between Ubp10 and the Sir2/4 sub-complex facilitates Ubp10 recruitment to chromatin via a co-assembly mechanism. Using hydrolyzable H2B-Ub analogs, we show that Ubp10 activity is lower on nucleosomes compared with H2B-Ub in solution. We find that Sir2/4 stimulates Ubp10 DUB activity on nucleosomes, likely through a combination of targeting and allosteric regulation. This coupling mechanism between the silencing machinery and its DUB partner allows erasure of active PTMs and the de novo transition of a transcriptionally active DNA region to a silent chromatin state."
https://openalex.org/W2778808538,"Coxiella burnetii is a human pathogen that causes the serious zoonotic disease Q fever. It is ubiquitous in the environment and due to its wide host range, long-range dispersal potential and classification as a bioterrorism agent, this microorganism is considered an HHS Select Agent. In the event of an outbreak or intentional release, laboratory strain typing methods can contribute to epidemiological investigations, law enforcement investigation and the public health response by providing critical information about the relatedness between C. burnetii isolates collected from different sources. Laboratory cultivation of C. burnetii is both time-consuming and challenging. Availability of strain collections is often limited and while several strain typing methods have been described over the years, a true gold-standard method is still elusive. Building upon epidemiological knowledge from limited, historical strain collections and typing data is essential to more accurately infer C. burnetii phylogeny. Harmonization of auspicious high-resolution laboratory typing techniques is critical to support epidemiological and law enforcement investigation. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) -based genotyping approach offers simplicity, rapidity and robustness. Herein, we demonstrate SNPs identified within 16S rRNA gene sequences can differentiate C. burnetii strains. Using this method, 55 isolates were assigned to six groups based on six polymorphisms. These 16S rRNA SNP-based genotyping results were largely congruent with those obtained by analyzing restriction-endonuclease (RE)-digested DNA separated by SDS-PAGE and by the high-resolution approach based on SNPs within multispacer sequence typing (MST) loci. The SNPs identified within the 16S rRNA gene can be used as targets for the development of additional SNP-based genotyping assays for C. burnetii."

Sero-surveys are a pragmatic means of estimating incidence however serological data is prone to misclassification. This study used mixture models to estimate incidence of rotavirus infection from anti-rotavirus immunoglobulin A (IgA) titres in infants from Vellore, India, and Karonga, Malawi. IgA titres were measured using serum samples collected at 6 month intervals for 36 months from 373 infants from Vellore and 12 months from 66 infants from Karonga. Mixture models (two component Gaussian mixture distributions) were fit to the difference in titres between time points to estimate risk of sero-positivity and derive incidence estimates. A peak incidence of 1.05(95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.64, 1.64) infections per child-year was observed in the first 6 months of life in Vellore. This declined incrementally with each subsequent time interval. Contrastingly in Karonga incidence was greatest in the second 6 months of life (1.41 infections per child year [95% CI: 0.79, 2.29]). This study demonstrates that infants from Vellore experience peak rotavirus incidence earlier than those from Karonga. Identifying such differences in transmission patterns is important in informing vaccine strategy, particularly where vaccine effectiveness is modest."
https://openalex.org/W2779267636,"Perspectives on whether the functions of MAS, a G protein-coupled receptor, are beneficial or deleterious in the heart remain controversial. MAS gene knockout reduces coronary vasodilatation leading to ischemic injury. G protein signaling activated by MAS has been implicated in progression of adaptive cardiac hypertrophy to heart failure and fibrosis. In the present study, we observed increased expression of MAS, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and collagen genes in failing (HF) human heart samples when compared to non-failing (NF). Expression levels of MAS are correlated with CTGF in HF and NF leading to our hypothesis that MAS controls CTGF production and the ensuing expression of collagen genes. In support of this hypothesis we show that the non-peptide MAS agonist AR234960 increases both mRNA and protein levels of CTGF via ERK1/2 signaling in HEK293-MAS cells and adult human cardiac fibroblasts. MAS-mediated CTGF expression can be specifically blocked by MAS inverse agonist AR244555 and also by MEK1 inhibition. Expression of CTGF gene was essential for MAS-mediated up-regulation of different collagen subtype genes in HEK293-MAS cells and human cardiac fibroblasts. Knockdown of CTGF by RNAi disrupted collagen gene regulation by the MAS-agonist. Our data indicate that CTGF mediates the profibrotic effects of MAS in cardiac fibroblasts. Blocking MAS-CTGF-collagen pathway should be considered for pharmacological intervention for HF."
https://openalex.org/W2781384657,"Changing climatic conditions impose a challenge both to biodiversity and food security. The effects of climate change affect different aspects of the plant or crop, such as morphological and phenological aspects, as well as yield. The effects of greenhouse conditions might be comparable in some cases to a permanent extreme disturbance in climate and weather, thus, contributing to our knowledge on climate change impacts on plant species. We have investigated the differences for 23 traits in two cultivar groups of an Andean traditional crop, Solanum betaceum, under two different environmental conditions that correspond to the traditional practices in the open field and three cultural managements under greenhouse conditions (no fertilization or control, organic, and mineral). We found that traditional practices in the open field are the less productive. Moreover, in warmer and drier conditions the treatment with organic fertilization was the most productive. Greenhouse conditions, however, delay production. We further identified traits that differentiate both cultivar groups and traits that are linked to either the new climate conditions or the fertilization treatments. Fruit characteristics were quite homogeneous between the two cultivar groups. Overall, our results provide insight on the consequences that climate change effects might exert on crops such as tree tomato, reveal that greenhouses can be a robust alternative for tree tomato production, and highlight the need to understand how different managements are linked to different solutions to fulfil the farmers' demands."
