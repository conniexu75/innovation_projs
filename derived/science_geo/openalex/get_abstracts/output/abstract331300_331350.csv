https://openalex.org/W2014144720,"It is suggested that the entire history of the ocean basins, in terms of oceanfloor spreading,is contained frozen in the oceanic crust. Variations in the intensity and polarity of Earth's magnetic field are considered to be recorded in the remanent magnetism of the igneous rocks as they solidified and cooled through the Curie temperature at the crest of an oceanic ridge, and subsequently spread away from it at a steady rate. The hypothesis is supported by the extreme linearity and continuity of oceanic magnetic anomalies and their symmetry about the axes of ridges. If the proposed reversal time scale for the last 4 million years is combined with the model, computed anomaly profiles show remarkably good agreement with those observed, and one can deduce rates of spreading for all active parts of the midoceanic ridge system for which magnetic profilesor surveys are available. The rates obtained are in exact agreement with those needed to account for continental drift. An exceptionally high rate of spreading (approximately 4.5 cm/year) in the South Pacific enables one to deduce by extrapolation considerable details of the reversal time scale back to 11.5 million years ago. Again, this scale can be applied to other parts of the ridge system. Thus one isled to the suggestion that the crest of the East Pacific Rise in the northeast Pacific has been overridden and modified by the westward drift of North America, with the production of the anomalous width and unique features of the American cordillera in the western United States. The oceanicmagnetic anomalies also indicate that there was a change in derection of crustal spreading in this region during Pliocene time from eastwest to southeast-northwest. A profile from the crest to the boundary of the East Pacific Rise, and the difference between axial-zone and flank anomalies over ridges, suggest increase in the frequency of reversal of Earth's magnetic field, together, possibly, with decrease in its intensity, approximately 25 million years ago. Within the framework of ocean-floor spreading, it is suggested that magnetic anomaliesmay indicate the nature of oceanic fracture zones and distinguish the parts of the ridge system that are actively spreading. Thus data derived during the past year lend remarkable support to thehypothesis that magnetic anomalies may reveal the history of the ocean basins."

https://openalex.org/W2037762471,"Sunflower leaf tissue of known potential was obtained by equilibrating an interveinal leaf sample, at constant temperature in air, with a potential determined by sucrose solutions. Equilibration occurred within 17 hours. Except for one determination, all measurements of the water potential of the equilibrated samples with an isopiestic technique were within 0.1 bar of the known potential of the tissue. This finding indicates that thermocouple psychrometers can measure accurate values of water potential when an isopiestic technique is used."
https://openalex.org/W1994259914,"The first detailed paleontological analysis of a deep-sea pistoncore from the Caribbean Sea has been completed. The core, P6304-8, was raised from 3927 meters, east of Beata Ridge at 14 degrees 59'N, 69 degrees 20'W. Formerly, stratigraphic works in this area were based on studies of paleotemperature, measured by the oxygen isotope mass spectrometry method, or on micropaleontological analysis by means of rapid or cursory examinations. For core P6304-8, samples for foraminiferal analysis were taken at 10-centimeter intervals and split into smaller samples containing an average of 710 individuals (smallest sample, 517 individuals); all individuals were then identified and counted. By use of data derived from populations of this size, a statistical reliability was insured within a 5 percent limnit. Temperature oscillations, the best method of portraying Pleistocene stratigraphy, were shown by using ratios of the relative abundances of tropical and subtropical planktonic foraminifera to those found in temperate and cooler waters. These ratios correlate well with existing paleotemperature measurements for the same core, obtained by the oxygen isotope mass spectrometry method."

The chains are composed of six-membered rings containing one boron-oxygen triangle and two boron-oxygen tetrahedra. The rings are linked through commonly shared boron-oxygen tetrahedra."
https://openalex.org/W1968966500,"Chemiluminescence was observed when organic compounds in a dry state,as well as in organic solvents, were exposed to ozone in oxygen. The peak intensity of the light emission is related quantitatively to the amount of compound. Many compounds can be identified by this method, and some are listed. Sensitivity of detection approximates that of fluorescence methods and extends to less-than- nanogram quantities for some compounds. Ozoneinduced chemiluminescence of compounds in acetone solution was less sensitive than it was in the dry analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2030851273,"One of Frohlich’s major achievements was to point out [1], in 1950, the significance of the electron-phonon interaction in superconductivity. Earlier, interactions between electrons and phonons (the quanta of the lattice vibrations) were taken into account for scattering and resistance; FRoHLICH showed that the same interaction should modify the energy of the electrons and proposed it as the basis for a theory of superconductivity. He suggested using a Hamiltonian, now called the Frohlich Hamiltonian, in which Coulomb interactions are disregarded except as they may modify the energies of the individual electrons, but which includes the interaction between electrons and phonons. An effective attractive interaction between the electrons results from exchange of virtual phonons. Strong confirmation of the importance of electron-phonon interactions in superconductivity came from the independent experimental discovery of the isotope effect. Although the theory given at that time was unsuccessful in accounting for superconductivity, FRoHLICH’S formulation of the problem has been the basis for nearly all subsequent theoretical developments."
https://openalex.org/W2053943042,"The various growth spurts and bends obtained in simple programs or irradiation can be interpreted, up to a point, in terms of optics, symmetry, and the cell's intrinsically regulated growth. Simple kinetic models imitate many gross features of the responses, and imply that light catalyzes some step in the formation or extension of the cell wall. This step may well be a nearly terminal one, perhaps involving slippage of chitin chains over one another. The most pervasive concept in these studies is that of adaptation, of which the steady-state level is primarily set by the light flux. But, since adaptation is tested by a growth response, every ""dark"" process contributing to cell enlargement is also implicated. From these sources comes the prompt negative feedback after an increase in light flux, as well as the conservation of growth seen in bending. Use of light by the plant seems to be only for operation of a crude guidance system for spore dispersal. For the investigator, light is a tool that displaces or unsteadies the mechanisms of cell extension and gives glimpses of their otherwise-concealed complex interplay."

Reactions between these solutions and sedimentary minerals, particularly dolomitization, must have contributed additional Ca++ to solution."

https://openalex.org/W2038810543,"The Gowganda Formation of Ontario consists of conglomerates, quartzites, and argillites deposited in a glacial environment. The distribution of varved argillites and silty limestones suggests continental and marine facies, respectively. Pebble and ripple-drift orientations, distribution of limestones, striated pavements, distribution of the underlying Bruce Group, and Huronian quartzite paleocurrents support the conclusion that sediment transport was from north to south."

https://openalex.org/W2073783756,"Radar measurements confirm that the several hundred million individually orbiting West Ford dipoles reentered the lower atmosphere in precise accord with predictions. Calculations indicate that these tiny copper wires survived reentry and floated gently back to Earth; unfortunately,the probability of finding one is minuscule. Some dipole clusters remain in orbit but almost all should return to Earth within the next 2 years."

https://openalex.org/W1968392907,"The inverse Compton effect can transform enough energy of relativistic electrons into radiation so that an upper limit to the mean energy of the electrons is set. In quasars, the limit is too small to allow the production of any appreciable amount of synchrotron or inverse Compton radiation, unless either the distances are not cosmological or the lifetimes of the relativistic electrons are extremely short, of the order of hours."
