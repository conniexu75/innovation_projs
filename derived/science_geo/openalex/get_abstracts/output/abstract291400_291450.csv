New findings now show that this myxosporean disease of fish is initiated by what is regarded as an actinosporean produced in a tubificid oligochaete. Experimental results provide evidence that, instead of being considered as representatives of separate classes in the phylum Myxozoa, the myxosporean and actinosporean are alternating life forms of a single organism."
https://openalex.org/W1990369605,"Reciprocal transplants of genetically identical fragments of intertidal sponges between environments of high and low wave action exhibit great variability in the timing of their responses to environmental change. Sponges quickly begin production of stiffer and stronger tissues in high wave energy environments but delay formation of new, weak tissues in calm habitats. This may be due to the risks of forming wave-intolerant tissue in a temporally variable, unpredictable environment. These results suggest that the evolution of acclimatory control is linked to environmental predictability and concomitantly to risks of acclimatory errors."

These mucous strands, secreted in response to water current stimuli, are produced by dense accumulations of ctenidial mucocytes and may help in the downstream or interstream dispersal of this rapidly spreading exotic clam."
https://openalex.org/W2052755153,"A brief review is given of the structures of an important class of reactive intermediates, divalent carbon species (carbenes). The electronic properties of carbenes force an unusual electronic character upon these species that, in turn, leads to intriguing physical and chemical properties. Because of the fleeting nature of carbenes, which are extraordinarily reactive, direct investigation of their structural and chemical behavior has presented a challenge to the experimentalist. The application of spectroscopic and ultrafast laser techniques has met this challenge. With the use of laser methods, along with conventional techniques, quantitative evaluation of the energetics, dynamics, and reactivities of a variety of carbenes has been possible."

Once the most valuable component has been obtained from each plant (rubber from guayule; seed oil from jojoba, buffalo gourd, and bladderpod; and resin from gumweed), the remaining material holds potential for useful products as well as fuel. It is difficult to realize the full potential of arid land plants, however, because of the complexities of developing the necessary agricultural and industrial infrastructure simultaneously. To do so, multicompany efforts or cooperative efforts between government and the private sector will be required."

The upper electrode must be the anode, and the magnitude of the current must be larger than a threshold value. The oscillations signal the onset of convection in the fluid. The experiment provides a new method for investigating transient convection processes."
https://openalex.org/W1967593271,"Phloem tissue from a Middle Devonian member of the Aneurophytales (Progymnospermopsida) is described. This may be the oldest firm evidence of conducting elements of the phloem, extending our knowledge of this tissue back some 35 million years. The discovery indicates a close phylogenetic relation between progymnosperms and gymnosperms and provides a basis for investigating patterns of specialization in the phloem of these groups of plants."

https://openalex.org/W2040726483,"THE FIRST EDITION OF HOLBROOK'S NORTH AMERICAN HERPETOLOGY. -When Theodore Gill reported the discovery by Witmer Stone of a fourth volume of the first edition of Holbrook's North American Herpetology in the library of the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, the copy in that library was thought to be the only one known (Gill, 1903, Science, 17: 910). Gill, in his memoir on Holbrook in the previous year, had reported the first edition to consist of only three volumes (1902, Nat. Acad. Sci. Biogr. Mem., 4: 56). A second set of the first edition of the North American Herpetology, complete with the fourth volume, was reported by the late Dr. Bohumil Shimek in 1924 (Proc. Acad. Sci. Iowa, 31: 427). Thus there appeared at that time to be only two published records of the supposedly especially rare fourth volume of the first edition. It may be added that the impression that the first edition consists of only three volumes, established by the publisher's prefatory note in the second edition, is perpetuated by the biography of Holbrook in the Dictionary of American Biography. The acquisition of a complete set of the first edition of Holbrook's work by Field Museum thus offers an appropriate occasion for further remarks on this noteworthy item of bibliographic history. Enquiry from my colleagues discloses the existence of a total of nine four-volume sets of the first edition, (Academy of Natural Sciences, Library of Congress (2), Museum of Comparative Zoology, Carnegie Museum, California Academy of Sciences, Charleston Museum, Field Museum, and the private library of Thomas Barbour). The question thus arises as to whether three volume sets of this edition are more numerous than are complete ones. Gill's remarks indicate that such sets are known; but the only three volume sets I discover are one at the University of Michigan, one at the University of Iowa, and one in the library of Charles L. Camp. To judge from the non-appearance of odd volumes or of three-volume sets of the first edition in the catalogues of book dealers, the first edition is rare in all of its volumes. It does not appear that there is any complete set of the first edition in European libraries. The fourth volume of the set here reported was found to agree exactly with the data supplied by Shimek, and on enquiry from the library at the University of Iowa, our set proves in fact to be the one long in his possession. It is gratifying to have it find a permanent place in a library especially rich in the literature of herpetology. The history of the first edition of the work, set forth by Gill on the basis of verbal information, is still far from clear. states, on the authority of the artist Richard (one of many employed by Holbrook) that He would become dissatisfied with a work before its completion and would have new plates drawn and published. Then he would offer to substitute the new for the old numbers, and, I was told, might even decline to let an old subscriber have a copy of the new edition unless the old one was returned to be destroyed. Holbrook's work on the two editions of the North American Herpetology was carried on at his home in Charleston, South Carolina, and the work was presumably distributed from his home. In my own recent reference to Holbrook's destruction of his first edition (Schmidt and Davis, Field Book of Snakes: 12) the scene of the burning is placed in his Philadelphia backyard, by a lapsus calami, arising perhaps from association of ideas with its place of printing, and to a confused recollection of the destruction of the plates of Holbrook's later work on fishes by a disastrous fire in Philadelphia. A copy of volume five of the second edition that accompanies our set of the first edition exhibits numerous differences from another copy in Field Museum's set of the second edition, especially in its plates. The text differs only in that page 11 has been reprinted to add Holbrook's name to Bufo erythronotus and page 97 to add an NB acknowledgment to the artist. There is also an unnumbered page of errata for the first four volumes (which prove to refer to the second edition). Our first copy of volume five has an inserted errata slip for volume five only, and an NB slip noting Holbrook's supposition that dekayi and occipitomaculata are identical. It is evident that the copy of volume five received with the first edition considerably antedates the other. More noteworthy differences consist in the fact that plate 13 is by Queen, plate 16 has the error in the specific name belineata corrected to bilineata, plates 19 and 26 are by Hill, plate 32 lacks any signature, and plate 37 is by Richard. In the later copy of volume five, plates 13, 19 and 26 are by Richard, plate 32 (redrawn) bears the artist's name Phiel (Peele in the text) and plate 37 is by Hopkins. Plates 13, 16, 19 and 26 of the earlier copy are identical with plates in the first edition; plates 32 and 37 are orphans, not represented in the first edition, and replaced by others in the second.
