https://openalex.org/W2538361155,"Individuals from different populations vary considerably in their susceptibility to immune-related diseases. To understand how genetic variation and natural selection contribute to these differences, we tested for the effects of African versus European ancestry on the transcriptional response of primary macrophages to live bacterial pathogens. A total of 9.3% of macrophage-expressed genes show ancestry-associated differences in the gene regulatory response to infection, and African ancestry specifically predicts a stronger inflammatory response and reduced intracellular bacterial growth. A large proportion of these differences are under genetic control: for 804 genes, more than 75% of ancestry effects on the immune response can be explained by a single cis- or trans-acting expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL). Finally, we show that genetic effects on the immune response are strongly enriched for recent, population-specific signatures of adaptation. Together, our results demonstrate how historical selective events continue to shape human phenotypic diversity today, including for traits that are key to controlling infection."

Here, we characterized, using RNA sequencing, the transcriptional response of primary monocytes from Africans and Europeans to bacterial and viral stimuli—ligands activating Toll-like receptor pathways (TLR1/2, TLR4, and TLR7/8) and influenza virus—and mapped expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). We identify numerous cis-eQTLs that contribute to the marked differences in immune responses detected within and between populations and a strong trans-eQTL hotspot at TLR1 that decreases expression of pro-inflammatory genes in Europeans only. We find that immune-responsive regulatory variants are enriched in population-specific signals of natural selection and show that admixture with Neandertals introduced regulatory variants into European genomes, affecting preferentially responses to viral challenges. Together, our study uncovers evolutionarily important determinants of differences in host immune responsiveness between human populations."

In the present study, we utilized a series of recently sequenced snake genomes to study the molecular and functional evolution of a critical limb enhancer in snakes and examine its possible role in limb loss. Our analysis focuses on one of the best-studied vertebrate enhancers, the Zone of Polarizing Activity [ZPA] Regulatory Sequence (ZRS, also known as MFCS1) (Lettice et al., 2003Lettice L.A.

Zuniga A. Shh and Gremlin1 chromosomal landscapes in development and disease.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2007; 17: 428-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The ZRS is a limb-specific enhancer of the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) gene that is located at the extreme distance of nearly one million base pairs from its target promoter. During limb development, the enhancer is active in the posterior limb bud mesenchyme (Figure 1A), where its activity is critically required for normal limb development in mouse (Sagai et al., 2005Sagai T. Hosoya M. Mizushina Y. Tamura M. Shiroishi T. Elimination of a long-range cis-regulatory module causes complete loss of limb-specific Shh expression and truncation of the mouse limb.Development. 2005; 132: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Single-nucleotide mutations within the ZRS cause limb malformations, such as preaxial polydactyly, in multiple vertebrate species including humans (Hill and Lettice, 2013Hill R.E. Lettice L.A.

Dyn. 2011; 240: 920-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we observed that the sequence of this limb enhancer is conserved throughout nearly all examined species in the snake lineage. In basal snakes, which retain vestigial limbs, it is highly conserved, whereas it underwent a rapid increase in substitution rate in advanced snakes, in which all skeletal limb structures have disappeared. Consistent with this, we provide evidence that the snake enhancer progressively lost its in vivo function as the body plan evolved from basal to advanced snakes. Finally, we identify a specific subset of nucleotide changes within the enhancer that contribute to its functional degeneration in snakes and show in a mouse model that synthetic reintroduction of just one degraded transcription factor binding site is sufficient to recreate the ancestral function and to rescue normal limb formation in vivo. To explore the potential role of the ZRS limb enhancer in snake evolution, we examined the draft genomes of six snake species including the Burmese python (Python molurus bivittatus) (Castoe et al., 2013Castoe T.A. de Koning A.P.J.

These species represent different morphological stages within the evolutionary history of snakes (Apesteguía and Zaher, 2006Apesteguía S. Zaher H.

Longrich N.R. EVOLUTION.

Slowinski J.B. Crother B.I. Burbrink F.T. Phylogeny of the Colubroidea (Serpentes): New evidence from mitochondrial and nuclear genes.Mol. Phylogenet.

A phylogeny and revised classification of Squamata, including 4161 species of lizards and snakes.BMC Evol. Biol. 2013; 13: 93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). Nearly all of the snake species studied have a ZRS-orthologous sequence (Figures 1B and S1). However, while the ZRS enhancer of basal snakes shares ∼80% nucleotide identity with the orthologous region from limbed lizards and shows a substitution rate similar to other vertebrate ZRS orthologs, the ZRS of advanced snakes displays a substantially increased number of substitutions compared to other enhancers (p = 0.012, permutation test; Figures 1B, 1C, and S2; Table S4). This fast evolutionary rate clearly distinguishes the ZRS from other limb enhancers, which do not show such an increase in substitutions (Figure S2) (Infante et al., 2015Infante C.R. Mihala A.G. Park S. Wang J.S. Johnson K.K. Lauderdale J.D. Menke D.B. Shared enhancer activity in the limbs and phallus and functional divergence of a limb-genital cis-regulatory element in snakes.Dev. Cell. 2015; 35: 107-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, while nearly all snake species examined have a ZRS enhancer, a loss of evolutionary constraint on this enhancer coincides with the complete loss of limb structures at the transition from basal to advanced snakes.Figure S2Phylogeny of Vertebrate Species Used in the Study, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A–C) Branch lengths indicate absolute substitution rate for ZRS enhancer (A, B) or all other limb specific enhancer sequences from the VISTA enhancer browser (C). Colors indicate the relative evolutionary rate of the ZRS (A, B) or all other limb specific enhancers (C) compared to forebrain specific enhancers (A, C) or to other limb specific enhancers (B) from the VISTA enhancer browser. This is consistent with the recent observation that other limb enhancers are conserved in snakes (Infante et al., 2015Infante C.R. Mihala A.G. Park S. Wang J.S. Johnson K.K. Lauderdale J.D.

This sequence conservation has been ascribed to functions in the development of vestigial limb structures in basal snakes or pleiotropic functions in structures outside the limb. Mouse ZRS transgenic reporter assays show no reproducible staining outside the limb, and ZRS deletion studies in mice indicate no phenotypes beyond limb defects, suggesting that the function of the ZRS is restricted to limb development (Lettice et al., 2003Lettice L.A.

To systematically examine whether the sequence changes observed in different snake ZRS orthologs alter the in vivo function of the enhancer, we used a transgenic mouse enhancer reporter assay (http://enhancer.lbl.gov/) (Kothary et al., 1989Kothary R. Clapoff S. Darling S. Perry M.D. Moran L.A. Rossant J.

VISTA Enhancer Browser—A database of tissue-specific human enhancers.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: D88-D92Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). We determined ZRS enhancer activity patterns for 16 different species covering a wide range of jawed vertebrates, including cartilaginous and bony fishes (elephant shark and coelacanth), four snakes (boa, python, rattlesnake, and cobra), and ten limbed tetrapods at mid-gestation (embryonic day [E]11.5), a time point when the mouse ZRS is active (Figures 1A and 2) (Lettice et al., 2003Lettice L.A.

Genet. 2003; 12: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). The orthologs from nine finned or limbed vertebrates (coelacanth, lizard, chicken, platypus, sloth, horse, cow, mouse, and human) displayed reproducible patterns of activity in the posterior limb bud that were indistinguishable from the activity of the mouse enhancer (Figure 2), confirming the deep conservation of its function across vertebrates with paired appendages (Dahn et al., 2007Dahn R.D.

ZRS orthologs from three species were active in the ZPA of mouse limb buds but also had activity expanded anteriorly (dolphin and megabat) or proximally (elephant shark). In contrast, in four out of five basal and advanced snake species examined, either the enhancer activity in the ZPA or the enhancer sequence itself was lost (Figure 2). Among them, the rattlesnake ZRS displayed an ectopic limb activity pattern that did not include the ZPA and may be related to an ∼180-bp insertion specifically found in the viper and rattlesnake lineage (Figures 2 and S1). Only the ZRS of boa, which diverged from python 63–96 million years ago (Esquerré and Scott Keogh, 2016Esquerré D. Scott Keogh J. Parallel selective pressures drive convergent diversification of phenotypes in pythons and boas.Ecol. Lett. 2016; 19: 800-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and among the examined snakes is the one showing the lowest nucleotide substitution rate with respect to that of the lizard, retained activity in the ZPA. Notably, the ZRS from all advanced snakes examined (rattlesnake and cobra) completely lost ZPA-specific activity. To assess the extent to which the observed activity changes in transgenic reporter assays affect vertebrate limb morphology in vivo, we employed CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to generate a series of knockin (KI) mice where the functionally critical 1.3-kb core region of the ZRS (Figure S3) was replaced with the orthologous sequences of the same length from other species. We first replaced the mouse ZRS with the orthologs from human (73% sequence identity to the mouse ZRS) and coelacanth (57% sequence identity to the human ZRS), whose last common ancestor lived approximately 400 million years ago. Both the human and coelacanth orthologs resulted in Shh expression at the onset of limb bud formation that was indistinguishable from wild-type and rescued the formation of fully developed limbs (Figures 3 and S4G–S4J ), indicating that despite considerable evolutionary distance between mammals and fish, the enhancers of mouse, human, and coelacanth are largely functionally interchangeable. In contrast, replacing the mouse ZRS with the orthologous cobra sequence resulted in a complete loss of Shh expression and a truncated limb phenotype, affecting both the fore- and hindlimbs, that is indistinguishable from the phenotype caused by deletion of the mouse enhancer (Figures 3, S3, and S4G) (Sagai et al., 2005Sagai T. Hosoya M. Mizushina Y. Tamura M. Shiroishi T. Elimination of a long-range cis-regulatory module causes complete loss of limb-specific Shh expression and truncation of the mouse limb.Development. 2005; 132: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). This result confirms that despite recognizable sequence conservation, the cobra sequence lacks limb enhancer function and is therefore unable to support limb development. The less diverged python ZRS resulted in a similar but a slightly milder phenotype. While most skeletal forelimb and hindlimb elements distal of the stylopod:zeugopod junction were also severely affected, the python ZRS resulted in formation of two to three rudimentary digits in the forelimb and a slightly enlarged ossification resembling a rudimentary zeugopod (Figure 3D). This result may be due to residual enhancer activity that was not detected in transgenic reporter assays (Figure 2). Consistent with this possibility, prolonged staining after RNA in situ hybridization indeed revealed very weak levels of Shh transcript in the posterior forelimb bud of python ZRS knockin mouse embryos (data not shown). Taken together our data indicate that both snake enhancers tested lost their ability to induce normal limb development in mice despite the much shorter evolutionary distance between mammals and snakes than between mammals and lobe-finned fish.Figure S4CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated ZRS Limb Enhancer Replacement by Homology-Driven Repair, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Schematic overview of strategy.

https://openalex.org/W2538195819,"Our ability to sustain attention for prolonged periods of time is limited. Studies on the relationship between lapses of attention and psychophysiological markers of attentional state, such as pupil diameter, have yielded contradicting results. Here, we investigated the relationship between tonic fluctuations in pupil diameter and performance on a demanding sustained attention task. We found robust linear relationships between baseline pupil diameter and several measures of task performance, suggesting that attentional lapses tended to occur when pupil diameter was small. However, these observations were primarily driven by the joint effects of time-on-task on baseline pupil diameter and task performance. The linear relationships disappeared when we statistically controlled for time-on-task effects and were replaced by consistent inverted U-shaped relationships between baseline pupil diameter and each of the task performance measures, such that most false alarms and the longest and most variable response times occurred when pupil diameter was both relatively small and large. Finally, we observed strong linear relationships between the temporal derivative of pupil diameter and task performance measures, which were largely independent of time-on-task. Our results help to reconcile contradicting findings in the literature on pupil-linked changes in attentional state, and are consistent with the adaptive gain theory of locus coeruleus-norepinephrine function. Moreover, they suggest that the derivative of baseline pupil diameter is a potentially useful psychophysiological marker that could be used in the on-line prediction and prevention of attentional lapses."

Vaccinia immune globulin (VIG) has been used therapeutically to treat severe orthopoxvirus infections but is in short supply. We generated a large panel of orthopoxvirus-specific human monoclonal antibodies (Abs) from immune subjects to investigate the molecular basis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses for diverse orthopoxviruses. Detailed analysis revealed the principal neutralizing antibody specificities that are cross-reactive for VACV, CPXV, MPXV, and VARV and that are determinants of protection in murine challenge models. Optimal protection following respiratory or systemic infection required a mixture of Abs that targeted several membrane proteins, including proteins on enveloped and mature virion forms of virus. This work reveals orthopoxvirus targets for human Abs that mediate cross-protective immunity and identifies new candidate Ab therapeutic mixtures to replace VIG."

Our results suggest that Sca4 relieves intercellular tension to promote protrusion engulfment, which represents a distinctive strategy for manipulating cytoskeletal force generation to enable spread. Many intracellular bacterial pathogens that reside in the cytosol have evolved mechanisms to spread through host tissues while remaining within cells, enabling access to cytosolic nutrients and evasion of the immune response (Ray et al., 2009Ray K. Marteyn B. Sansonetti P.J. Tang C.M. Life on the inside: the intracellular lifestyle of cytosolic bacteria.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Cell-to-cell spread has been extensively studied for pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes and Shigella flexneri. However, less well-studied intracytosolic bacteria also undergo spread, including the spotted fever group (SFG) of Rickettsia spp. These obligate intracellular bacteria are transmitted to humans via arthropod vectors, and spread likely contributes to the vascular and epithelial damage associated with spotted fever disease (Walker and Ismail, 2008Walker D.H. Ismail N. Emerging and re-emerging rickettsioses: endothelial cell infection and early disease events.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, in comparison with other pathogens, we know very little about the pathways and underlying mechanisms by which SFG rickettsiae spread. Previous studies of L. monocytogenes and S. flexneri have revealed key steps of cell-to-cell spread. First, intracytosolic bacteria hijack host actin and use the force from actin polymerization to drive movement and form actin comet tails (Bernardini et al., 1989Bernardini M.L. Mounier J. d’Hauteville H. Coquis-Rondon M. Sansonetti P.J. Identification of icsA, a plasmid locus of Shigella flexneri that governs bacterial intra- and intercellular spread through interaction with F-actin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Actin filaments and the growth, movement, and spread of the intracellular bacterial parasite, Listeria monocytogenes.J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1597-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Next, motile bacteria propel themselves into the donor cell plasma membrane and form long protrusions into the recipient cell (Dragoi and Agaisse, 2015Dragoi A.-M. Agaisse H. The class II phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase PIK3C2A promotes Shigella flexneri dissemination through formation of vacuole-like protrusions.Infect.

Eventually, a bacterial protrusion is engulfed into a double-membrane vesicle in the recipient cell, which is followed by lysis of the vesicle and escape of the bacterium into the recipient cell cytosol (Kuehl et al., 2015Kuehl C.J. Dragoi A.-M. Talman A. Agaisse H.

Marteyn B. Sansonetti P.J. Tang C.M. Life on the inside: the intracellular lifestyle of cytosolic bacteria.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). SFG rickettsiae also undergo actin-based motility (Heinzen, 2003Heinzen R.A. Rickettsial actin-based motility: behavior and involvement of cytoskeletal regulators.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2003; 990: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and form protrusions into recipient cells (Gouin et al., 1999Gouin E. Gantelet H. Egile C. Lasa I. Ohayon H. Villiers V. Gounon P. Sansonetti P.J. Cossart P. A comparative study of the actin-based motilities of the pathogenic bacteria Listeria monocytogenes, Shigella flexneri and Rickettsia conorii.J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the model SFG Rickettsia species R. parkeri uses distinct mechanisms of actin-based motility compared with other pathogens (Haglund et al., 2010Haglund C.M. Choe J.E. Skau C.T. Kovar D.R. Welch M.D. Rickettsia Sca2 is a bacterial formin-like mediator of actin-based motility.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 1057-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, Reed et al., 2014Reed S.C.O. Lamason R.L. Risca V.I. Abernathy E. Welch M.D. Rickettsia actin-based motility occurs in distinct phases mediated by different actin nucleators.Curr. Biol. 2014; 24: 98-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), suggesting their mechanisms of spread may also be different. During spread, bacteria interact directly with the host plasma membrane at intercellular junctions. These junctions contain protein complexes and signaling platforms that can be usurped by pathogens. For example, S. flexneri target tricellular junctions via the host tight junction protein tricellulin to promote protrusion formation (Fukumatsu et al., 2012Fukumatsu M. Ogawa M. Arakawa S. Suzuki M. Nakayama K. Shimizu S. Kim M. Mimuro H. Sasakawa C. Shigella targets epithelial tricellular junctions and uses a noncanonical clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway to spread between cells.Cell Host Microbe. 2012; 11: 325-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). S. flexneri protrusion dynamics are also regulated by localized tyrosine kinase signaling and phospholipid production (Kuehl et al., 2015Kuehl C.J. Dragoi A.-M. Talman A. Agaisse H. Bacterial spread from cell to cell: beyond actin-based motility.Trends Microbiol. 2015; 23: 558-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In contrast, the L. monocytogenes effector protein InlC promotes protrusion formation by inhibiting the host adaptor protein Tuba and the actin regulatory protein N-WASP (Rajabian et al., 2009Rajabian T. Gavicherla B. Heisig M. Müller-Altrock S. Goebel W. Gray-Owen S.D. Ireton K. The bacterial virulence factor InlC perturbs apical cell junctions and promotes cell-to-cell spread of Listeria.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 1212-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These differences highlight the complexity of this process and suggest that distinct pathways of spread have evolved for different pathogens. Intercellular junctions also serve as sites for generating cell-cell tension. At adherens junctions, E-cadherin receptors are linked to the underlying actomyosin network through protein complexes that respond to and transmit forces to regulate cell shape, structure, and function (Lecuit and Yap, 2015Lecuit T. Yap A.S. E-cadherin junctions as active mechanical integrators in tissue dynamics.Nat. Cell Biol. 2015; 17: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). When tension is applied to E-cadherin, α-catenin is stretched to expose cryptic binding sites for proteins such as vinculin (Buckley et al., 2014Buckley C.D. Tan J. Anderson K.L. Hanein D. Volkmann N. Weis W.I. Nelson W.J. Dunn A.R. Cell adhesion. The minimal cadherin-catenin complex binds to actin filaments under force.Science. 2014; 346: 1254211Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, Yonemura et al., 2010Yonemura S. Wada Y. Watanabe T. Nagafuchi A. Shibata M. alpha-Catenin as a tension transducer that induces adherens junction development.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 533-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Vinculin recruitment reinforces reciprocal, actin-mediated pulling forces at junctions by facilitating additional connections to the actomyosin network and increasing cell stiffness (Huveneers and de Rooij, 2013Huveneers S. de Rooij J. Mechanosensitive systems at the cadherin-F-actin interface.J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126: 403-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Tension at cell-cell junctions likely represents a key barrier to be overcome by bacteria during spread. Previous work suggested that the forces from actin-based motility were sufficient to overcome cell-cell tension (Monack and Theriot, 2001Monack D.M. Theriot J.A. Actin-based motility is sufficient for bacterial membrane protrusion formation and host cell uptake.Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 633-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Alternatively, bacteria may directly manipulate host subcellular tension forces to promote spread, as has been suggested for L. monocytogenes InlC (Rajabian et al., 2009Rajabian T. Gavicherla B. Heisig M. Müller-Altrock S. Goebel W. Gray-Owen S.D. Ireton K. The bacterial virulence factor InlC perturbs apical cell junctions and promotes cell-to-cell spread of Listeria.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 1212-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To better understand general and pathogen-specific features of cell-to-cell spread, we investigated spread parameters and molecular mechanisms for R. parkeri. We found that R. parkeri spread occurs with distinct physical and kinetic features when compared with L. monocytogenes. Moreover, most R. parkeri lack actin tails when in protrusions, in contrast with L. monocytogenes, suggesting R. parkeri may not rely on actin-based motility for protrusion dynamics. Instead, we found that the rickettsial protein surface cell antigen 4 (Sca4) promotes efficient protrusion engulfment by reducing vinculin-dependent tension at E-cadherin-mediated adhesion sites. Our results suggest that R. parkeri evolved a strategy to promote spread that may not rely on the force generated by actin-based motility and instead depends on weakening intercellular tension. Although previous studies have investigated the parameters of L. monocytogenes and S. flexneri spread (Bernardini et al., 1989Bernardini M.L. Mounier J. d’Hauteville H. Coquis-Rondon M. Sansonetti P.J. Identification of icsA, a plasmid locus of Shigella flexneri that governs bacterial intra- and intercellular spread through interaction with F-actin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Actin filaments and the growth, movement, and spread of the intracellular bacterial parasite, Listeria monocytogenes.J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1597-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar), little was known for R. parkeri. Therefore, we compared the spread parameters of GFP-expressing R. parkeri and L. monocytogenes (Rp-GFP and Lm-GFP) using live imaging of infected A549 cells, which form flat, adherent monolayers amenable to live-cell imaging. To visualize individual spread events, A549 cells stably expressing a red plasma membrane marker (TagRFP-T-Farnesyl; TRTF) were mixed with unlabeled A549 cells and grown to confluency before infection. We observed each stage of spread, including protrusion formation, protrusion engulfment, and bacterial escape into the cytosol (Figure 1A; Movies S1 and S2). We discovered that Rp-GFP generated significantly shorter protrusions than Lm-GFP (Figures 1A and 1B; short protrusions were also seen in HMEC-1 cells; data not shown). Moreover, Rp-GFP protrusions resolved into vesicles faster than Lm-GFP protrusions (Figure 1C). Vesicle-escape kinetics were the same for both bacteria (Figure 1D). These morphological and kinetic differences suggested that each pathogen may have evolved different molecular mechanisms for regulating protrusion dynamics. L. monocytogenes relies on the force generated by actin-based motility to initiate and elongate protrusions (Talman et al., 2014Talman A.M. Chong R. Chia J. Svitkina T. Agaisse H. Actin network disassembly powers dissemination of Listeria monocytogenes.J. Cell Sci. 2014; 127: 240-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). SFG Rickettsia mutants defective in actin-based motility also spread less efficiently (Kleba et al., 2010Kleba B. Clark T.R. Lutter E.I. Ellison D.W. Hackstadt T. Disruption of the Rickettsia rickettsii Sca2 autotransporter inhibits actin-based motility.Infect. Immun. 2010; 78: 2240-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, Reed et al., 2014Reed S.C.O. Lamason R.L. Risca V.I. Abernathy E. Welch M.D. Rickettsia actin-based motility occurs in distinct phases mediated by different actin nucleators.Curr. Biol. 2014; 24: 98-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), suggesting motility is critical for this process. Thus it was surprising that in A549 cells infected with R. parkeri (Rp-2xTagBFP) and L. monocytogenes (Lm-TagBFP), only 8% of Rp-2xTagBFP in protrusions had polar actin or actin tails, whereas 82% of Lm-TagBFP had polar actin or actin tails (Figures 1E–1G; note the small difference in protrusion frequency in Figure 1F). The results with R. parkeri were confirmed using live-cell imaging of A549 cells co-expressing TRTF and Lifeact-mWasabi (to visualize actin). In these experiments, actin tails were clearly seen associated with motile R. parkeri in the cytosol, but tails were lost once bacteria reached the cell edge and remained absent during protrusion formation and engulfment (Figure 1H; Movie S3). Thus, while actin-based motility may be necessary for R. parkeri to move to the host cell membrane, it may not be needed for initiating or elongating protrusions (Figures 1I and 1J). This highlights important differences in spread mechanisms between these bacterial species and suggests other rickettsial factors could be required for protrusion dynamics. Because no rickettsial genes were known to specifically regulate spread, we sought to better understand the molecular mechanisms of spread by identifying R. parkeri mutants with defects in this process. We used a mariner-based transposon mutagenesis system (Liu et al., 2007Liu Z.-M. Tucker A.M. Driskell L.O. Wood D.O. Mariner-based transposon mutagenesis of Rickettsia prowazekii.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2007; 73: 6644-6649Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) to generate R. parkeri small-plaque mutants. One mutant contained a transposon (tn) insertion within the sca4 gene (sca4::tn) (Figure 2A), resulting in a truncation of Sca4 at residue 652 (Figure 2B) and a small-plaque phenotype (Figures 2D and S1A). We generated an antibody against Sca4 and confirmed the sca4::tn mutant does not express full-length protein but instead weakly expresses an apparent truncation product (Figure 2C). The Sca4 amino acid sequence includes two antigenic repeat regions of unknown function (Sears et al., 2012Sears K.T. Ceraul S.M. Gillespie J.J. Allen Jr., E.D. Popov V.L. Ammerman N.C. Rahman M.S.

The VBSs are conserved in most Rickettsia spp. (Gillespie et al., 2015Gillespie J.J. Kaur S.J. Rahman M.S. Rennoll-Bankert K. Sears K.T. Beier-Sexton M. Azad A.F. Dehio C.

Data are mean ± SEM. (G, H) Infectious focus size in (G) HMEC-1 and (H) U2OS monolayers infected with WT (Rp-GFP) and sca4::tn. Data are mean ± SEM (unpaired t test: ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001). The small plaques formed by the sca4::tn mutant could be caused by defects in the infectious life cycle independent of spread (e.g., growth, motility). However, when compared with wild-type (WT) bacteria, the sca4::tn mutant had similar growth kinetics (Figure S1B), invasion efficiency (Figures S1C and S1D), frequency of actin tails, and rate of actin-based motility (Figures S1E and S1F). These data pointed to a role for Sca4 in spread. To directly measure spread, host cell monolayers were infected at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI), and extracellular bacteria were killed with gentamicin. Foci of infection formed, and the number of infected cells per focus was measured to quantify spread efficiency (Reed et al., 2014Reed S.C.O. Lamason R.L. Risca V.I. Abernathy E. Welch M.D. Rickettsia actin-based motility occurs in distinct phases mediated by different actin nucleators.Curr. Biol. 2014; 24: 98-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this infectious focus assay, the sca4::tn mutant generated smaller foci than WT in A549 (Figures 2E and 2F), HMEC-1, and U2OS cells (Figures S1G and S1H). To confirm that this phenotype is caused by sca4 disruption, we complemented the sca4::tn mutant by transforming R. parkeri with a plasmid (pSca4) containing the sca4 genomic region (nt 652,261–655,741 of the R. parkeri chromosome) (Figure 2A). This plasmid was sufficient to mediate full-length Sca4 expression in the sca4::tn mutant (Figure 2C). Moreover, mutant bacteria containing this plasmid (sca4::tn + pSca4) exhibited similar infectious focus sizes compared to WT in A549 cells (Figure 2F). Taken together, these results indicate Sca4 specifically enhances R. parkeri spread in a variety of cell types. To determine the step of spread at which Sca4 acts (protrusion formation, protrusion engulfment and/or vesicle escape), live-cell imaging was performed as described above (Figure 1A) to compare WT and sca4::tn spread dynamics. Interestingly, the sca4::tn mutant displayed a kinetic defect in protrusion engulfment, spending over twice as much time in a protrusion (∼23 min) compared with WT (∼10 min) before resolving into a double-membrane vesicle (Figure 2G). No differences between sca4::tn and WT were observed in the other stages of spread (not shown), suggesting Sca4 is specifically required for efficient protrusion engulfment. Given the apparent importance of Sca4 in protrusion engulfment, we also predicted that more sca4::tn mutant bacteria would be found within protrusions at a fixed time point. In agreement with this prediction, the sca4::tn mutant was found in protrusions at twice the frequency of WT (Figure 2H). This phenotype was also rescued in the sca4::tn + pSca4 strain (Figure 2H). These findings indicate Sca4 acts in spread by specifically enhancing protrusion engulfment efficiency. Sca4 orthologs are thought to be secreted from bacteria (Gillespie et al., 2015Gillespie J.J. Kaur S.J. Rahman M.S. Rennoll-Bankert K. Sears K.T. Beier-Sexton M. Azad A.F. Dehio C. Secretome of obligate intracellular Rickettsia.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2015; 39: 47-80PubMed Google Scholar), which would be consistent with a direct role in promoting spread by targeting host proteins. To determine if Sca4 is secreted from R. parkeri, we generated strains of R. parkeri stably expressing TEM1-Sca4 fusions for use in a β-lactamase reporter assay (Figures 3A–3C). Secretion is detected after cleavage of the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensor CCF4/AM in the host cytosol, resulting in a shift from green to blue fluorescence (Charpentier and Oswald, 2004Charpentier X. Oswald E. Identification of the secretion and translocation domain of the enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli effector Cif, using TEM-1 beta-lactamase as a new fluorescence-based reporter.J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5486-5495Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Infection of host cells with R. parkeri expressing full-length TEM1 (positive control) showed robust secretion and CCF4/AM cleavage (Figures 3A and 3C). Deleting the N-terminal secretion signal from TEM1 (TEM1∗, negative control) abolished secretion (Figures 3A and 3C). Importantly, a TEM1∗-Sca4 fusion was secreted as shown by abundant CCF4/AM cleavage (Figures 3A and 3C). This strongly suggests R. parkeri secrete Sca4 into the host cell. Analysis with SignalP 4.0 software (Petersen et al., 2011Petersen T.N. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Nielsen H. SignalP 4.0: discriminating signal peptides from transmembrane regions.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8: 785-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (7096) Google Scholar) revealed R. parkeri Sca4 lacks a classical N-terminal Sec or Tat signal sequence. Secretion may thus be directed by an alternative secretion system, such as the type I secretion system (T1SS) or the type IV secretion system (T4SS) (Gillespie et al., 2015Gillespie J.J. Kaur S.J. Rahman M.S. Rennoll-Bankert K. Sears K.T. Beier-Sexton M. Azad A.F. Dehio C. Secretome of obligate intracellular Rickettsia.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2015; 39: 47-80PubMed Google Scholar). Although T1SS and T4SS effectors lack strong consensus signal sequences, such sequences are often at the C terminus (Cambronne and Roy, 2006Cambronne E.D. Roy C.R. Recognition and delivery of effector proteins into eukaryotic cells by bacterial secretion systems.Traffic. 2006; 7: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, Delepelaire, 2004Delepelaire P. Type I secretion in gram-negative bacteria.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Consequently, we tested whether the C-terminal 20 aa of Sca4 are necessary and/or sufficient for secretion. TEM1∗-Sca4 harboring a deletion of this C-terminal sequence (TEM1∗-Sca4Δ20) was not secreted by R. parkeri, despite being expressed at similar levels as TEM1∗-Sca4 (Figures 3B and 3C). However, fusing this 20-aa sequence to TEM1∗ was not sufficient for secretion (Figures 3B and 3C). Thus, the C-terminal sequence is necessary, but not sufficient, for secretion, and additional sequences also participate in this process. To confirm whether endogenous Sca4 is secreted and determine where it localizes in the host cell, we used a differential staining protocol to distinguish secreted proteins from those residing in the bacterial cytosol (Campbell-Valois et al., 2014Campbell-Valois F.X. Schnupf P. Sansonetti P.J. Detection of the secreted and cytoplasmic fractions of IpaB, IpaC and IpaD by lysozyme permeabilization.Bio-protocol. 2014; 4: e1271Google Scholar) (Figure 3D). All WT bacteria displayed Sca4 staining in the bacterial cytosol, whereas only 8% ± 4% of WT bacteria were associated with secreted Sca4 (Figure 3D; bottom 2 rows). The sca4::tn mutant displayed a significantly weaker Sca4 signal in the bacterial cytosol (data not shown) and a much lower fraction was associated with secreted Sca4 (0.6% ± 0.5%), confirming the specifi"

Epigenetic modifying drugs can only transiently and modestly induce FMR1 reactivation in the presence of the elongated CGG repeat. As a proof-of-principle, we excised the expanded CGG-repeat in both somatic cell hybrids containing the human fragile X chromosome and human FXS iPS cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. We observed transcriptional reactivation in approximately 67% of the CRISPR cut hybrid colonies and in 20% of isolated human FXS iPSC colonies. The reactivated cells produced FMRP and exhibited a decline in DNA methylation at the FMR1 locus. These data demonstrate the excision of the expanded CGG-repeat from the fragile X chromosome can result in FMR1 reactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2536222201,"Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with some disorders including cardiovascular diseases. Dyslipidemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. However, data about the relationships between vitamin D and lipids are inconsistent. The relationship of vitamin D and Atherogenic Index of Plasma (AIP), as an excellent predictor of level of small and dense LDL, has not been reported. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of vitamin D status on serum lipids in Chinese adults.The study was carried out using 1475 participants from the Center for Physical Examination, 306 Hospital of PLA in Beijing, China. Fasting blood samples were collected and serum concentrations of 25(OH)D, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were measured. AIP was calculated based on the formula: log [TG/HDL-C]. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to estimate the associations between serum 25(OH)D and lipids. The association between the occurrences of dyslipidemias and vitamin D levels was assessed by multiple logistic regression analysis. Confounding factors, age and BMI, were used for the adjustment.The median of serum 25(OH)D concentration was 47 (27-92.25) nmol/L in all subjects. The overall percentage of 25(OH)D ≦ 50 nmol/L was 58.5% (males 54.4%, females 63.7%). The serum 25(OH)D levels were inversely associated with TG (β coefficient = -0.24, p < 0.001) and LDL-C (β coefficient = -0.34, p < 0.001) and positively associated with TC (β coefficient = 0.35, p < 0.002) in men. The associations between serum 25(OH)D and LDL-C (β coefficient = -0.25, p = 0.01) and TC (β coefficient = 0.39, p = 0.001) also existed in women. The serum 25(OH)D concentrations were negatively associated with AIP in men (r = -0.111, p < 0.01) but not in women. In addition, vitamin D deficient men had higher AIP values than vitamin D sufficient men. Furthermore, the occurrences of dyslipidemias (reduced HDL-C, elevated TG and elevated AIP) correlated with lower 25(OH)D levels in men, whereas the higher TC and LDL-C associated with higher 25(OH)D levels in women.It seems that the serum 25(OH)D levels are closely associated with the serum lipids and AIP. Vitamin D deficiency may be associated with the increased risk of dyslipidemias, especially in men. The association between vitamin D status and serum lipids may differ by genders."
https://openalex.org/W2543985504,"P2X4 receptors (P2X4R) are a family of ATP-gated non-selective cation channels. We previously demonstrated that activation of P2X4R in spinal microglia is crucial for neuropathic pain, a highly debilitating chronic pain condition, suggesting that P2X4R is a potential therapeutic target for treating neuropathic pain. Thus, the identification of a compound that has a potent inhibitory effect on P2X4R is an important clinical challenge. In the present study, we screened a chemical library of clinically approved drugs and show for the first time that duloxetine, a serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, has an inhibitory effect on rodent and human P2X4R. In primary cultured microglial cells, duloxetine also inhibited P2X4R-, but not P2X7R-, mediated responses. Moreover, intrathecal administration of duloxetine in a model of neuropathic pain produced a reversal of nerve injury-induced mechanical allodynia, a cardinal symptom of neuropathic pain. In rats that were pretreated with a serotonin-depleting agent and a noradrenaline neurotoxin, the antiallodynic effect of duloxetine was reduced, but still remained. Based on these results, we suggest that, in addition to duloxetine's primary inhibitory action on serotonin and noradrenaline transporters, an inhibitory effect on P2X4R may be involved at least in part in an antiallodynic effect of intrathecal duloxetine in a model of neuropathic pain."

Also, we report on how changes to a microsphere's refractive index and size affect image formation and planes. The relationship between the focus position and the additional magnification factor is also investigated using experimental and theoretical methods.

The intervention lasted less than 15 minutes. In our initial study, children showed large gains from pretest to posttest in their fraction number line estimates, magnitude comparisons, and recall accuracy. In a more rigorous second study, the experimental group showed similarly large improvements, whereas a control group showed no improvement from practicing fraction number line estimates without feedback. The results provide evidence for the effectiveness of interventions emphasizing fraction magnitudes and indicate how psychological theories and research can be used to evaluate specific recommendations of the Common Core State Standards."
https://openalex.org/W2533264585,"Although the scientific peer review process is crucial to distributing research investments, little has been reported about the decision-making processes used by reviewers. One key attribute likely to be important for decision-making is reviewer expertise. Recent data from an experimental blinded review utilizing a direct measure of expertise has found that closer intellectual distances between applicant and reviewer lead to harsher evaluations, possibly suggesting that information is differentially sampled across subject-matter expertise levels and across information type (e.g. strengths or weaknesses). However, social and professional networks have been suggested to play a role in reviewer scoring. In an effort to test whether this result can be replicated in a real-world unblinded study utilizing self-assessed reviewer expertise, we conducted a retrospective multi-level regression analysis of 1,450 individual unblinded evaluations of 725 biomedical research funding applications by 1,044 reviewers. Despite the large variability in the scoring data, the results are largely confirmatory of work from blinded reviews, by which a linear relationship between reviewer expertise and their evaluations was observed—reviewers with higher levels of self-assessed expertise tended to be harsher in their evaluations. However, we also found that reviewer and applicant seniority could influence this relationship, suggesting social networks could have subtle influences on reviewer scoring. Overall, these results highlight the need to explore how reviewers utilize their expertise to gather and weight information from the application in making their evaluations."
https://openalex.org/W2535352967,"The combination of CD44 and CD24, or aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) alone, is a widely used cancer stem cell marker in breast cancer. However, no conclusion has yet been reached as to which marker is the best for characterizing cancer stemness. Immunohistochemical evaluation using cancer stem cell markers is clearly less common clinically than in basic experiments and how the expressions of these markers relate to patient outcomes remains controversial. To investigate whether combining these markers might improve the prediction of patient outcomes, we immunohistochemically examined clinical samples. Primary invasive breast cancer samples from 61 patients who eventually developed distant metastases after curative surgery were immunohistochemically examined. All patients were free of metastatic disease at the time of surgery and received standard adjuvant systemic treatments. CD44+/24- and ALDH1-positive rates in primary tumors differed according to intrinsic subtype. ER-positive patients with CD44+/24- tumors had significantly longer disease-free-survival than all other ER-positive patients (p = 0.0047). On the other hand, CD44+/24- tumors were associated with poor outcomes of ER-negative patients (p = 0.038). Finally, expression patterns of CD44 and ALDH1 in single tumors were strikingly different and there were virtually no individual double-stained cells. Thus, this combination does not allow evaluation of relationships with patient outcomes. Our results raise the possibility of CD44+/24- being a good prognostic marker, one which would allow treatment effects and outcomes to be predicted in patients with recurrent breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2537137541,"With half of the world’s population at risk for malaria infection and with drug resistance on the rise, the search for mutation-resistant therapies has intensified. We report here a therapy for Plasmodium falciparum malaria that acts by inhibiting the phosphorylation of erythrocyte membrane band 3 by an erythrocyte tyrosine kinase. Because tyrosine phosphorylation of band 3 causes a destabilization of the erythrocyte membrane required for parasite egress, inhibition of the erythrocyte tyrosine kinase leads to parasite entrapment and termination of the infection. Moreover, because one of the kinase inhibitors to demonstrate antimalarial activity is imatinib, i.e. an FDA-approved drug authorized for use in children, translation of the therapy into the clinic will be facilitated. At a time when drug resistant strains of P. falciparum are emerging, a strategy that targets a host enzyme that cannot be mutated by the parasite should constitute a therapeutic mechanism that will retard evolution of resistance."

BL21(DE3) and MRE600 E. coli strains were used to prepare the S30-T7 extract. The CFPS system was used to produce a set of fluorescent and therapeutic proteins of different molecular weights (up to 66 kDa). This system was able to produce 40-150 μg-protein/ml, with variations depending on the plasmid type, expressed protein and E. coli strain. Interestingly, the BL21-based CFPS exhibited stability and increased activity at 40 and 45°C. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most rapid and affordable lab-scale protocol for preparing a cell-free protein synthesis system, with high thermal stability and efficacy in producing therapeutic proteins."

Methods This article bases upon weighted data (N = 6483) from the National Comorbidity Survey Adolescent Supplement (participant age: 13–18 years), a nationally representative United States cohort. Onset of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition lifetime mental disorders was assessed with the fully structured World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview, complemented by parent report. Onset of lifetime medical conditions and doctor-diagnosed diseases was assessed by self-report. Results The most substantial temporal associations with onset of mental disorders preceding onset of physical diseases included those between affective disorders and arthritis (hazard ratio (HR) = 3.36, 95%-confidence interval (CI) = 1.95 to 5.77) and diseases of the digestive system (HR = 3.39, CI = 2.30 to 5.00), between anxiety disorders and skin diseases (HR = 1.53, CI = 1.21 to 1.94), and between substance use disorders and seasonal allergies (HR = 0.33, CI = 0.17 to 0.63). The most substantial temporal associations with physical diseases preceding mental disorders included those between heart diseases and anxiety disorders (HR = 1.89, CI = 1.41 to 2.52), epilepsy and eating disorders (HR = 6.27, CI = 1.58 to 24.96), and heart diseases and any mental disorder (HR = 1.39, CI = 1.11 to 1.74). Conclusions Findings suggest that mental disorders are antecedent risk factors of certain physical diseases in early life, but also vice versa. Our results expand the relevance of mental disorders beyond mental to physical health care, and vice versa, supporting the concept of a more integrated mental-physical health care approach, and open new starting points for early disease prevention and better treatments, with relevance for various medical disciplines."

Human lysozyme is a globular protein with antimicrobial properties with tendencies to fibrillate and hence is known as a fibril-forming protein. Therefore, its behavior under different ambient conditions is of great importance. In this study, we conducted two 500000 ps molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of human lysozyme in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at two ambient temperatures. To achieve comparative results, we also performed two 500000 ps human lysozyme MD simulations in pure water as controls. The aim of this study was to provide further molecular insight into all interactions in the lysozyme-SDS complexes and to provide a perspective on the ability of human lysozyme to form amyloid fibrils in the presence of SDS surfactant molecules. SDS, which is an anionic detergent, contains a hydrophobic tail with 12 carbon atoms and a negatively charged head group. The SDS surfactant is known to be a stabilizer for helical structures above the critical micelle concentration (CMC) [1]. During the 500000 ps MD simulations, the helical structures were maintained by the SDS surfactant above its CMC at 300 K, while at 370 K, human lysozyme lost most of its helices and gained β-sheets. Therefore, we suggest that future studies investigate the β-amyloid formation of human lysozyme at SDS concentrations above the CMC and at high temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W2536911456,"Forsythia spp. are perennial woody plants which are one of the most extensively used medicinal sources of Chinese medicines and functional diets owing to their lignan contents. Lignans have received widespread attention as leading compounds in the development of antitumor drugs and healthy diets for reducing the risks of lifestyle-related diseases. However, the molecular basis of Forsythia has yet to be established. In this study, we have verified de novo deep transcriptome of Forsythia koreana leaf and callus using the Illumina HiSeq 1500 platform. A total of 89 million reads were assembled into 116,824 contigs using Trinity, and 1,576 of the contigs displayed the sequence similarity to the enzymes responsible for plant specialized metabolism including lignan biosynthesis. Notably, gene ontology (GO) analysis indicated the remarkable enrichment of lignan-biosynthetic enzyme genes in the callus transcriptome. Nevertheless, precise annotation and molecular phylogenetic analyses were hindered by partial sequences of open reading frames (ORFs) of the Trinity-based contigs. To obtain more numerous contigs harboring a full-length ORF, we developed a novel overlapping layout consensus-based procedure, virtual primer-based sequence reassembly (VP-seq). VP-seq elucidated 709 full-length ORFs, whereas only 146 full-length ORFs were assembled by Trinity. The comparison of expression profiles of leaf and callus using VP-seq-based full-length ORFs revealed 50-fold upregulation of secoisolariciresinol dehydrogenase (SIRD) in callus. Expression and phylogenetic cluster analyses predicted candidates for matairesinol-glucosylating enzymes. We also performed VP-seq analysis of lignan-biosynthetic enzyme genes in the transcriptome data of other lignan-rich plants, Linum flavum, Linum usitatissimum and Podophyllum hexandrum. The comparative analysis indicated both common gene clusters involved in biosynthesis upstream of matairesinol such as SIRD and plant lineage-specific gene clusters, in particular, genes responsible for biosynthetic pathways for production of podophyllotoxin; CYP71BE54, a key enzyme gene for podophyllotoxin biosynthesis in P. hexandrum, was not found in L. flavum, although both P. hexandrum. and L. flavum yield podophyllotoxin. Altogether, these data have established the fruitful molecular basis of Forsythia and provided insight into the molecular evolution and diversity of lignan biosynthetic pathways."

However, ASC is also known to trigger apoptosis in tumor cells, acting as a tumor-suppressor gene, which is lost in several human cancers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical significance of ASC in human cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Initially, ASC expression was immunohistochemically evaluated in non-metastic and metastatic SCC. While ASC expression does not correlate with metastatic potential, it correlates with the degree of dedifferentiation. Using methylation specific PCR we were able to demonstrate ASC silencing by promotor specific methylation and impaired inflammasome function in methylated cell lines, linking epigenetic modifications to innate immune activation in keratinocytes. Interestingly, upon ASC restoration by treatment with demethylating agents, we were able to restore AIM2 and NLRP3 activation. In summary, loss of ASC driven tumor development is counterbalanced in the identical cell by the inhibition of pro-tumorigenic inflammation in the tumor cell itself."

https://openalex.org/W2536969971,"We recently pointed out the important role of dermis deformation by pulsating arterial pressure in the formation of a photoplethysmographic signal at green light. The aim of this study was to explore the role of this novel finding in near-infrared (NIR) light. A light-emitting diode (LED)-based imaging photoplethysmography (IPPG) system was used to detect spatial distribution of blood pulsations under frame-to-frame switching green and NIR illumination in the palms of 34 healthy individuals. We observed a significant increase of light-intensity modulation at the heartbeat frequency for both illuminating wavelengths after a palm was contacted with a glass plate. Strong positive correlation between data measured at green and NIR light was found, suggesting that the same signal was read independently from the depth of penetration. Analysis of the data shows that an essential part of remitted NIR light is modulated in time as a result of elastic deformations of dermis caused by variable blood pressure in the arteries. Our observations suggest that in contrast with the classical model, photoplethysmographic waveform originates from the modulation of the density of capillaries caused by the variable pressure applied to the skin from large blood vessels. Particularly, beat-to-beat transmural pressure in arteries compresses/decompresses the dermis and deforms its connective-tissue components, thus affecting the distance between the capillaries, which results in the modulation of absorption and scattering coefficients of both green and NIR light. These findings are important for the correct interpretation of this widely used medical technique, which may have novel applications in diagnosis and treatment monitoring of aging and skin diseases."

PLoS ONE 11(10): e0165123. doi:10.1371/journal. pone.0165123 Editor: Alena Talkachova, University of Minnesota, UNITED STATES Background Preconditioning stimuli conducted in remote organs can protect the heart against subse- quent ischemic injury, but effects on arrhythmogenesis and sudden cardiac death (SCD) are unclear. Here, we investigated the effect of remote liver ischemia preconditioning (RLIPC) on ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced cardiac arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death (SCD) in vivo, and determined the potential role of ERK/GSK-3βsignaling. Received: April 10, 2016 Methods/Results Accepted: October 6, 2016 Male Sprague Dawley rats were randomized to sham-operated, control, or RLIPC groups. RLIPC was induced by alternating four 5-minute cycles of liver ischemia with 5-minute inter- mittent reperfusions. To investigate I/R-induced arrhythmogenesis, hearts in each group were subsequently subjected to 5-minute left main coronary artery ligation followed by 20- minute reperfusion. RLIPC reduced post-I/R ventricular arrhythmias, and decreased the incidence of SCD >threefold. RLIPC increased phosphorylation of cardiac ERK1/2, and GSK-3β Ser9 but not Tyr216 post-I/R injury. Inhibition of either GSK-3β (with SB216763) or ERK1/2 (with U0126) abolished RLIPC-induced antiarrhythmic activity and GSK-3β Ser9 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, leaving GSK-3β Tyr216 phosphorylation unchanged.

https://openalex.org/W2535821507,"The mechanisms underlying human germ cell development are largely unknown, partly due to the scarcity of primordial germ cells and the inaccessibility of the human germline to genetic analysis. Human embryonic stem cells can differentiate to germ cells in vitro and can be genetically modified to study the genetic requirements for germ cell development. Here, we studied NANOS3 and DAZL, which have critical roles in germ cell development in several species, via their over expression in human embryonic stem cells using global transcriptional analysis, in vitro germ cell differentiation, and in vivo germ cell formation assay by xenotransplantation. We found that NANOS3 over expression prolonged pluripotency and delayed differentiation. In addition, we observed a possible connection of NANOS3 with inhibition of apoptosis. For DAZL, our results suggest a post-transcriptional regulation mechanism in hES cells. In addition, we found that DAZL suppressed the translation of OCT4, and affected the transcription of several genes associated with germ cells, cell cycle arrest, and cell migration. Furthermore, DAZL over expressed cells formed spermatogonia-like colonies in a rare instance upon xenotransplantation. These data can be used to further elucidate the role of NANOS3 and DAZL in germ cell development both in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2537132191,"Objective This study was aimed to find out epidemiologic characteristic of tuberculosis (TB) cases, and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) positive cases among TB patients (TB/HIV co-infection) through demographic, temporal, and spatial study in Urumqi. Methods Descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression were applied to identify the epidemiologic characteristics and risk factors of TB epidemic and TB/HIV co-infection epidemic. All addresses of each TB case, TB/HIV co-infection case, and administrative street were transformed into geographical coordinate. Subsequently, the geocoded address for 82 streets was transformed into a dot map used as the basis of spatial datasets. In addition, the paper also used quantile map and the spatial scan statistic in order to identify the spatial distribution and spatial clusters of TB epidemic and TB/HIV co-infection epidemic. Result There was a declining trend of the notification rates of TB epidemic from 2007 to 2009, as well as a rising trend from 2010 to 2013. However, the notification rates of TB/HIV co-infection epidemic showed a rising trend from 2007 to 2010, and a declining trend from 2011 to 2013. Moreover, a significant share of TB epidemic and TB/HIV co-infection epidemic happened between the age of 15 to 45 years old, indicating an increase in risk of TB and TB/HIV infection. It is worth noting that the risk of HIV infection for male TB patients was 2.947 times (95% CI [2.178, 3.988]) than that of female patients. Han ethnicity and Uygur ethnicity in urban region accounted for a large proportion of total TB and TB/HIV co-infection cases. Most of the TB cases of minorities in Urumqi showed a statistically significant increase in risk of HIV infection than Han ethnicity in Urumqi. In addition, the spatial distribution of TB epidemic and TB/HIV co-infection epidemic was highly skewed. Most of the local clusters were located in urban area and rural-urban continuum where showed an increase in risk of TB and TB/HIV infection. Conclusion The epidemiologic and spatial-temporal analysis of TB epidemic and TB/HIV co-infection epidemic demonstrates a potential connection between TB and HIV in Urumqi. Demographic, temporal, geographic factors are the reasons of causing TB and TB/HIV co-infection epidemic."
https://openalex.org/W2539074516,"Background Previous studies showed that isoflurane-induced cognitive deficits could be alleviated by dexmedetomidine in young animal subjects. In the current study, we examine whether dexmedetomidine could also alleviate isoflurane-induced cognitive deficits in senile animals. Methods Senile male C57BL/6 mice (20 months) received dexmedetomidine (50 μg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle 30 minutes prior to isoflurane exposure (1.3% for 4 h). Cognitive function was assessed 19 days later using a 5-day testing regimen with Morris water maze. Some subjects also received pretreatment with α2 adrenoreceptor antagonist atipamezole (250 μg/kg, i.p.), JAK2 inhibitor AG490 (15 mg/kg i.p.) or STAT3 inhibitor WP1066 (40 mg/kg i.p.) 30 minutes prior to dexmedetomidine. Results Isoflurane exposure increased and reduced the time spent in the quadrant containing the target platform in training sessions. The number of crossings over the original target quadrant was also decreased. Dexmedotomidine attenuated such effects. Effects of dexmedotomidine were reduced by pretreatment with atipamezole, AG490 and WP1066. Increased phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 in the hippocampus induced by isoflurane was augmented by dexmedetomidine. Effects of dexmedetomidine on JAK2/STAT3 phosphorylation were attenuated by atipamezole, AG490 and WP1066. Isoflurane promoted neuronal apoptosis and increased the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and BAD, and reduced Bcl-2 expression. Attenuation of such effects by dexmedotomidine was partially blocked by atipamezole, AG490 and WP1066. Conclusion Dexmedetomidine could protect against isoflurane-induced spatial learning and memory impairment in senile mice by stimulating the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Such findings encourage the use of dexmedetomidine in geriatric patients receiving isoflurane anesthesia."
https://openalex.org/W2534749847,"The non-hemolytic enterotoxin complex (Nhe) is supposed to be the main virulence factor of B. cereus causing a diarrheal outcome of food poisoning. This tripartite toxin consists of the single components NheA, -B and -C all of them being necessary for maximum toxicity. In the past, research activities aiming to elucidate the mode-of-action of Nhe were mostly focused on the B- and C-component. In this study the generation of novel monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and their thorough characterization enabled the determination of key features for NheA. By the means of immunoaffinity chromatography it could be shown that NheA does not interact with -B and -C in solution. Additionally, the establishment of a highly sensitive sandwich-EIA now enables the detection of NheA in B. cereus supernatants down to 20 pg ml-1.Peptide-based epitope mapping in combination with partially deleted recombinant NheA fragments allowed the allocation of the binding regions for the three mAbs under study. Furthermore, by different EIA set-ups the conformational flexibility of NheA could be shown. For two of the antibodies under study different mechanisms of NheA neutralization were proven. Due to prevention of complete pore formation by one of the antibodies, NheA could be detected in an intermediate stage of the tripartite complex on the cell surface. Taken together, the results obtained in the present study allow a refinement of the mode-of-action for the Nhe toxin-complex."
https://openalex.org/W2533377295,"Beta-adrenergically-stimulated sweat rates determined by evaporimetry or by sweat bubble imaging are useful for measuring CFTR function because they provide a near-linear readout across almost the full range of CFTR function. They differentiate cystic fibrosis (CF) subjects from CF carriers and carriers from controls. However, evaporimetry, unlike bubble imaging, appears to be unable to detect improved levels of CFTR function in G551D subjects taking the CFTR modulator ivacaftor. Here, we quantify the sensitivity of evaporimetry and bubble imaging methods for assessing low levels of CFTR-dependent sweat rates. To establish sensitivity, we did dose-ranging studies using intradermally injected [cAMP]i–elevating cocktails. We reduced isoproterenol/aminophylline levels while maintaining a high level of atropine to block muscarinic elevation of [Ca2+]i. We stimulated the same sets of glands for both assays and recorded responses for 20 min. In response to a 3-log dilution of the stimulating cocktail (0.1%), bubble responses were detected in 12/12 tests (100%), with 49% ± 3% of glands secreting to produce an aggregate volume of 598 nl across the 12, 20-min tests. This was ~5% of the response to full cocktail. Evaporimetry detected responses in 3/12 (25%) tests with an aggregate secretion volume of 175 nl. After stimulation with a still more dilute cocktail (0.03%), bubble imaging detected 15 ± 13% of glands secreting at a rate ~0.9% of the response to full cocktail, while zero responding was seen with evaporimetry. The bubble imaging method detected secretion down to aggregate rates of <0.2 nl/(cm2·min), or ~1/30th of the average basal transepithelial water loss (TEWL) in the test subject of 4 g/m2·hr or 6.7 nl/(cm2·min). The increased sensitivity of bubble imaging may be required to detect small but physiologically important increases in secretion rates produced by CFTR modulators."
https://openalex.org/W2537465957,"Recent studies have indicated that the ratio of C-reactive protein to albumin (CRP–Alb ratio) is associated with clinical outcomes in patients with disease. We examined the predictive value of this ratio in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD). In this cross-sectional study, 91 eligible adult HD patients were analyzed, and the correlation between the CRP–Alb ratio and skeletal muscle mass normalized for body weight (SMM/wt; estimated using a bioelectrical impedance analyzer) was investigated. The mean age of the study participants was 54.9 ± 6.6 years (ranging from 27 to 64 years); 43 (47.2%) were men. The mean values for the SMM/wt were 39.1% ± 5.4%. The CRP–Alb ratio was found to be negatively correlated with SMM/wt (r = −0.33, P = 0.002) and creatinine (r = −0.20, P = 0.056). All the univariate significant and nonsignificant relevant covariates were selected for multivariable stepwise regression analysis. We determined that the homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance and CRP–Alb ratio were independent risk determinants for SMM/wt (βHOMA-IR = −0.18 and βCRP–Alb ratio = −3.84, adjusted R2 = 0.32). This study indicated that the CRP–Alb ratio may help clinicians in predicting muscle mass in adult patients undergoing HD."
https://openalex.org/W2539018587,"Tat-interactive protein 60 (Tip60), encoded by the Kat5 gene, is a member of the MYST family of acetyltransferases. Cancer biology studies have shown that Tip60 induces the DNA damage response, apoptosis, and cell-cycle inhibition. Although Tip60 is expressed in the myocardium, its role in cardiomyocytes (CMs) is unclear. Earlier studies here showed that application of cardiac stress to globally targeted Kat5+/-haploinsufficient mice resulted in inhibition of apoptosis and activation of the CM cell-cycle, despite only modest reduction of Tip60 protein levels. It was therefore of interest to ascertain the effects of specifically and substantially depleting Tip60 from CMs using Kat5LoxP/-;Myh6-Cre mice in the absence of stress. We report initial findings using this model, in which the effects of specifically depleting Tip60 protein from ventricular CMs, beginning at early neonatal stages, were assessed in 2-12 week-old mice. Although 5'-bromodeoxyuridine immunostaining indicated that CM proliferation was not altered at any of these stages, CM density was increased in 2 week-old ventricles, which persisted in 4 week-old hearts when TUNEL staining revealed inhibition of apoptosis. By week 4, levels of connexin-43 were depleted, and its patterning was dysmorphic, concomitant with an increase in cardiac hypertrophy marker expression and interstitial fibrosis. This was followed by systolic dysfunction at 8 weeks, after which extensive apoptosis and CM fallout occurred, followed by lethality as mice approached 12 weeks of age. In summary, chronic depletion of Tip60 from the ventricular myocardium beginning at early stages of neonatal heart development causes CM death after 8 weeks; hence, Tip60 protein has a crucial function in the heart."
https://openalex.org/W2533254723,"Vocal fold paralysis results from various etiologies and can induce voice changes, swallowing complications, and issues with aspiration. Vocal fold paralysis is typically managed using injection laryngoplasty with fat or synthetic polymers. Injection with autologous fat has shown excellent biocompatibility. However, it has several disadvantages such as unpredictable resorption rate, morbidities associated with liposuction procedure which has to be done in operating room under general anesthesia. Human adipose-derived extracellular matrix (ECM) grafts have been reported to form new adipose tissue and have greater biostability than autologous fat graft. Here, we present an injectable hydrogel that is constructed from adipose tissue derived soluble extracellular matrix (sECM) and methylcellulose (MC) for use in vocal fold augmentation. Human sECM derived from adipose tissue was extracted using two major steps-ECM was isolated from human adipose tissue and was subsequently solubilized. Injectable sECM/MC hydrogels were prepared by blending of sECM and MC. Sustained vocal fold augmentation and symmetric vocal fold vibration were accomplished by the sECM/MC hydrogel in paralyzed vocal fold which were confirmed by laryngoscope, histology and a high-speed imaging system. There were increased number of collagen fibers and fatty granules at the injection site without significant inflammation or fibrosis. Overall, these results indicate that the sECM/MC hydrogel can enhance vocal function in paralyzed vocal folds without early resorption and has potential as a promising material for injection laryngoplasty for stable vocal fold augmentation which can overcome the shortcomings of autologous fat such as unpredictable duration and morbidity associated with the fat harvest."
https://openalex.org/W2533300437,"Fatigue resulting from strenuous exercise can impair cognition and oculomotor control. These impairments can be prevented by administering psychostimulants such as caffeine. This study used two experiments to explore the influence of caffeine administered at rest and during fatiguing physical exercise on spatial attention-a cognitive function that is crucial for task-based visually guided behavior. In independent placebo-controlled studies, cohorts of 12 healthy participants consumed caffeine and rested or completed 180 min of stationary cycling. Covert attentional orienting was measured in both experiments using a spatial cueing paradigm. We observed no alterations in attentional facilitation toward spatial cues suggesting that covert attentional orienting is not influenced by exercise fatigue or caffeine supplementation. Response times were increased (impaired) after exercise and this deterioration was prevented by caffeine supplementation. In the resting experiment, response times across all conditions and cues were decreased (improved) with caffeine. Covert spatial attention was not influenced by caffeine. Together, the results of these experiments suggest that covert attentional orienting is robust to the effects of fatiguing exercise and not influenced by caffeine. However, exercise fatigue impairs response times, which can be prevented by caffeine, suggesting that pre-motor planning and execution of the motor responses required for performance of the cueing task are sensitive to central nervous system fatigue. Caffeine improves response time in both fatigued and fresh conditions, most likely through action on networks controlling motor function."
https://openalex.org/W2539042434,"Visual function has been shown to deteriorate prior to the onset of retinopathy in some diabetic patients and experimental animal models. This suggests the involvement of the brain's visual system in the early stages of diabetes. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by examining the integrity of the visual pathway in a diabetic rat model using in vivo multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ten-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into an experimental diabetic group by intraperitoneal injection of 65 mg/kg streptozotocin in 0.01 M citric acid, and a sham control group by intraperitoneal injection of citric acid only. One month later, diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) was performed to examine the white matter integrity in the brain, followed by chromium-enhanced MRI of retinal integrity and manganese-enhanced MRI of anterograde manganese transport along the visual pathway. Prior to MRI experiments, the streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats showed significantly smaller weight gain and higher blood glucose level than the control rats. DTI revealed significantly lower fractional anisotropy and higher radial diffusivity in the prechiasmatic optic nerve of the diabetic rats compared to the control rats. No apparent difference was observed in the axial diffusivity of the optic nerve, the chromium enhancement in the retina, or the manganese enhancement in the lateral geniculate nucleus and superior colliculus between groups. Our results suggest that streptozotocin-induced diabetes leads to early injury in the optic nerve when no substantial change in retinal integrity or anterograde transport along the visual pathways was observed in MRI using contrast agent enhancement. DTI may be a useful tool for detecting and monitoring early pathophysiological changes in the visual system of experimental diabetes non-invasively."
https://openalex.org/W2536172081,"Accounting for climate change in invasive species risk assessments improves our understanding of potential future impacts and enhances our preparedness for the arrival of new non-native species. We combined traditional risk assessment for invasive species with habitat suitability modeling to assess risk to biodiversity based on climate change. We demonstrate our method by assessing the risk for 15 potentially new invasive plant species to Alberta, Canada, an area where climate change is expected to facilitate the poleward expansion of invasive species ranges. Of the 15 species assessed, the three terrestrial invasive plant species that could pose the greatest threat to Alberta's biodiversity are giant knotweed (Fallopia sachalinensis), tamarisk (Tamarix chinensis), and alkali swainsonpea (Sphaerophysa salsula). We characterise giant knotweed as 'extremely invasive', with 21 times the suitable habitat between baseline and future projected climate. Tamarisk is 'extremely invasive' with a 64% increase in suitable habitat, and alkali swainsonpea is 'highly invasive' with a 21% increase in suitable habitat. Our methodology can be used to predict and prioritise potentially new invasive species for their impact on biodiversity in the context of climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2533177721,"Neuromelanin is a dark pigment granule present within certain catecholamine neurons of the human brain. Here, we aimed to clarify the relationship between contrast of neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MR relaxation times using T1, T2, and T2* mapping of the lower midbrain.The subjects were 14 healthy volunteers (11 men and 3 women, mean age 29.9 ± 6.9 years). Neuromelanin-sensitive MRI was acquired using an optimized T1-weighted two-dimensional (2D)-turbo spin-echo sequence. To quantitatively evaluate the relaxation time, 2D-image data for the T1, T2, and T2* maps were also acquired. The regions of interest (substantia nigra pars compacta [SNc], superior cerebellar peduncles [SCP], cerebral peduncles [CP], and midbrain tegmentum [MT]) were manually drawn on neuromelanin-sensitive MRI to measure the contrast ratio (CR) and on relaxation maps to measure the relaxation times.The CR in the SNc was significantly higher than the CRs in the SCP and CP. Compared to the SCP and CP, the SNc had significantly higher T1 relaxation times. Moreover, the SNc had significantly lower T2 and T2* relaxation times than the other three regions (SCP, CP, and MT). Correlation analyses showed no significant correlations between the CRs in the SNc, SCP, and CP and each relaxation time.We demonstrated the relationship between the CR of neuromelanin-sensitive MRI and the relaxation times of quantitative maps of the human midbrain."
https://openalex.org/W2536537637,"Translation of mRNA in alternate reading frames (ARF) is a naturally occurring process heretofore underappreciated as a generator of protein diversity. The MUC1 gene encodes MUC1-TM, a signal-transducing trans-membrane protein highly expressed in human malignancies. Here we show that an AUG codon downstream to the MUC1-TM initiation codon initiates an alternate reading frame thereby generating a novel protein, MUC1-ARF. MUC1-ARF, like its MUC1-TM 'parent' protein, contains a tandem repeat (VNTR) domain. However, the amino acid sequence of the MUC1-ARF tandem repeat as well as N- and C- sequences flanking it differ entirely from those of MUC1-TM. In vitro protein synthesis assays and extensive immunohistochemical as well as western blot analyses with MUC1-ARF specific monoclonal antibodies confirmed MUC1-ARF expression. Rather than being expressed at the cell membrane like MUC1-TM, immunostaining showed that MUC1-ARF protein localizes mainly in the nucleus: Immunohistochemical analyses of MUC1-expressing tissues demonstrated MUC1-ARF expression in the nuclei of secretory luminal epithelial cells. MUC1-ARF expression varies in different malignancies. While the malignant epithelial cells of pancreatic cancer show limited expression, in breast cancer tissue MUC1-ARF demonstrates strong nuclear expression. Proinflammatory cytokines upregulate expression of MUC1-ARF protein and co-immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrate association of MUC1-ARF with SH3 domain-containing proteins. Mass spectrometry performed on proteins coprecipitating with MUC1-ARF demonstrated Glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase (G6PD) and Dynamin 2 (DNM2). These studies not only reveal that the MUC1 gene generates a previously unidentified MUC1-ARF protein, they also show that just like its 'parent' MUC1-TM protein, MUC1-ARF is apparently linked to signaling and malignancy, yet a definitive link to these processes and the roles it plays awaits a precise identification of its molecular functions. Comprising at least 524 amino acids, MUC1-ARF is, furthermore, the longest ARF protein heretofore described."
https://openalex.org/W2535909400,"Although it is recognized that multi-drug therapies may be necessary to combat AD, there is a paucity of preclinical proof of concept studies. We present a combination treatment paradigm, which temporally affects different aspects of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like pathology, specifically Aβ-toxicity and neurogenesis. At early stages of AD-like pathology, in TgCRND8 mice, we found that combating Aβ pathology with scyllo-inositol ameliorated deficits in neurogenesis. Older TgCRND8 mice with established amyloid load had decreased progenitor cell proliferation and survival compared to non-transgenic mice, regardless of scyllo-inositol treatment. The prolonged exposure to Aβ-pathology leads to deficits in the neurogenic niche, thus targeting Aβ alone is insufficient to rescue neurogenesis. To support the neurogenic niche, we combined scyllo-inositol treatment with leteprinim potassium (neotrofin), the latter of which stimulates neurotrophin expression. We show that the combination treatment of scyllo-inositol and neotrofin enhances neuronal survival and differentiation. We propose this proof of concept combination therapy of targeting Aβ-pathology and neurotrophin deficits as a potential treatment for AD."
https://openalex.org/W2536668199,"By definition, the domestication process leads to an overall reduction of crop genetic diversity. This lead to the current search of genomic regions in wild crop relatives (CWR), an important task for modern carrot breeding. Nowadays massive sequencing possibilities can allow for discovery of novel genetic resources in wild populations, but this quest could be aided by the use of a surrogate gene (to first identify and prioritize novel wild populations for increased sequencing effort). Alternative oxidase (AOX) gene family seems to be linked to all kinds of abiotic and biotic stress reactions in various organisms and thus have the potential to be used in the identification of CWR hotspots of environment-adapted diversity. High variability of DcAOX1 was found in populations of wild carrot sampled across a West-European environmental gradient. Even though no direct relation was found with the analyzed climatic conditions or with physical distance, population differentiation exists and results mainly from the polymorphisms associated with DcAOX1 exon 1 and intron 1. The relatively high number of amino acid changes and the identification of several unusually variable positions (through a likelihood ratio test), suggests that DcAOX1 gene might be under positive selection. However, if positive selection is considered, it only acts on some specific populations (i.e. is in the form of adaptive differences in different population locations) given the observed high genetic diversity. We were able to identify two populations with higher levels of differentiation which are promising as hot spots of specific functional diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2532257404,"Hepcidin, one kind of antimicrobial peptides, is one of the promising alternatives to antibiotics with broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. Hepcidins cloned from different kinds of fishes have been produced using exogenous expression systems, and their in vitro antimicrobial effects have been verified. However their in vivo effects on gut microbiota and gut health of hosts remain unclear. Here we performed a safety study of hepcidin so that it can be used to reduce microbial contaminations in the food and feed. In this study, Pichia pastoris-expressed Pseudosciaena crocea hepcidin (PC-hepc) was first assessed by simulated digestion tests and then administered to male and female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats in different concentrations. Subchronic toxicity testing, high throughput 16S rRNA sequencing of gut microbiota, and examinations on gut metabolism and permeability were conducted. The results showed PC-hepc could be digested in simulated intestinal fluid but not in simulated gastric fluid. PC-hepc had no adverse effects on general health, except causing increase of blood glucose (still in the normal value range of this index) in all trial groups of female rats and intestinal inflammation in HD group of female rats. Community composition of gut microbiota of female MD and HD groups shifted compared with control group, of which the decrease of genus Akkermansia might be related to the increase of blood glucose and intestinal inflammation. Significant increase of fecal nitroreductase activity was also observed in female MD and HD groups. Our results suggest the uses of exogenous PC-hepc in normal dosage are safe, however excess dosage of it may cause intestinal disorder of animals."
https://openalex.org/W2537790108,"Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is considered an effective treatment for major depression with melancholic features. However, neurocognitive side-effects such as anterograde amnesia still regularly occur. The present study aims to evaluate the severity and course of anterograde amnesia in severely depressed patients undergoing ECT. In a prospective naturalistic study, anterograde memory function was assessed among inpatients who underwent ECT (n = 11). Subjects met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder. Recruitment took place between March 2010-March 2011 and March 2012-March 2013. Controls treated with antidepressants (n = 9) were matched for age, gender and depression severity. Primary outcome measure was immediate recall; secondary outcome measures were delayed recall, recognition, and visual association. Differences were tested using repeated measures ANOVA and paired t-tests. Correlations with hypothesized covariates were calculated. In patients with major depressive disorder, ECT had a significant effect on delayed memory function (p<0.01 with large effect sizes). Findings on immediate recall were less consistent. Four weeks after treatment discontinuation, these memory functions had recovered. Age was identified as a very important covariate. The main limitations of our study are its naturalistic design, possibly compromising internal validity, and its small sample size. However, if these findings can be reproduced in a more comprehensive study group, then the possible induction of anterograde amnesia is not a justifiable reason for clinicians to disregard ECT as a treatment option."

Two quinoline alkaloids, anhydroevoxine (A) and choisyine (C), isolated from these leaves were also tested. The results obtained pointed out to a very high antinociceptive activity measured by the hot plate model for EECA (at doses of 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg) as well as for A and C (at doses of 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg). The magnitude of the activity was two-fold higher than the one observed for the morphine treated animals for the higher doses of extracts/compounds (30, 100 mg/kg and 3, 10 mg/kg respectively). The mechanism of action for this activity was also investigated and it seems that for EECA as well as A and C, the opiate system plays an important role. Results have also shown that the nitric oxide (NO) system also play a pivotal role in the case of EECA and A while for C it seems that the cholinergic system have some involvement. The acute toxicity was evaluated for EECA with results showing no important toxic effect."
https://openalex.org/W2539334867,"Typical research on intertemporal choice utilizes a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) paradigm requiring participants to choose between a smaller sooner and larger later payoff. In the adjusting-amount procedure (AAP) one of the alternatives is fixed and the other is adjusted according to particular choices made by the participant. Such a method makes the alternatives unequal in status and is speculated to make the fixed alternative a reference point for choices, thereby affecting the decision made. The current study shows that fixing different alternatives in the AAP influences discount rates in intertemporal choices. Specifically, individuals' (N = 283) choices were affected to just the same extent by merely fixing an alternative as when choices were preceded by scenarios explicitly imposing reference points."
https://openalex.org/W2545229506,"An optochemokine tandem was developed to control the release of calcium from endosomes into the cytosol by light and to analyze the internalization kinetics of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) by electrophysiology. A previously constructed rhodopsin tandem was re-engineered to combine the light-gated Ca2+-permeable cation channel Channelrhodopsin-2(L132C), CatCh, with the chemokine receptor CXCR4 in a functional tandem protein tCXCR4/CatCh. The GPCR was used as a shuttle protein to displace CatCh from the plasma membrane into intracellular areas. As shown by patch-clamp measurements and confocal laser scanning microscopy, heterologously expressed tCXCR4/CatCh was internalized via the endocytic SDF1/CXCR4 signaling pathway. The kinetics of internalization could be followed electrophysiologically via the amplitude of the CatCh signal. The light-induced release of Ca2+ by tandem endosomes into the cytosol via CatCh was visualized using the Ca2+-sensitive dyes rhod2 and rhod2-AM showing an increase of intracellular Ca2+ in response to light."
https://openalex.org/W2535752073,"From 2013 to 2015, peste des petits ruminants (PPR) broke out in more than half of the provinces of China; thus, the application and development of diagnostic methods are very important for the control of PPR. Here, an immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) was developed to detect antibodies against PPR. However, during IPMA development, we found that Vero cells were not the appropriate choice because staining results were not easily observed. Therefore, we first established a baby hamster kidney-goat signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (BHK-SLAM) cell line that could stably express goat SLAM for at least 20 generations. Compared with Vero cells, the PPR-mediated cytopathic effect occurred earlier in BHK-SLAM cells, and large syncytia appeared after virus infection. Based on this cell line and recombinant PPR virus expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) (rPPRV-GFP), an IPMA for PPR diagnosis was developed. One hundred and ninety-eight PPR serum samples from goats or sheep were tested by the IPMA and virus neutralization test (VNT). Compared with the VNT, the sensitivity and specificity of the IPMA were 91% and 100%, respectively, and the coincidence rate of the two methods was 95.5%. The IPMA assay could be completed in 4 h, compared with more than 6 d for the VNT using rPPRV-GFP, and it is easily performed, as the staining results can be observed under a microscope. Additionally, unlike the VNT, the IPMA does not require antigen purification, which will reduce its cost. In conclusion, the established IPMA will be an alternative method that replaces the VNT for detecting antibodies against PPRV in the field."
https://openalex.org/W2535782417,"Previous studies have confirmed that there are many differences between animal and plant microRNAs (miRNAs), and that numerical features based on sequence and structure can be used to predict the function of individual miRNAs. However, there is little research regarding numerical differences between animal and plant miRNAs, and whether a single numerical feature or combination of features could be used to distinguish animal and plant miRNAs or not. Therefore, in current study we aimed to discover numerical features that could be used to accomplish this. We performed a large-scale analysis of 132 miRNA numerical features, and identified 17 highly significant distinguishing features. However, none of the features independently could clearly differentiate animal and plant miRNAs. By further analysis, we found a four-feature subset that included helix number, stack number, length of pre-miRNA, and minimum free energy, and developed a logistic classifier that could distinguish animal and plant miRNAs effectively. The precision of the classifier was greater than 80%. Using this tool, we confirmed that there were universal differences between animal and plant miRNAs, and that a single feature was unable to adequately distinguish the difference. This feature set and classifier represent a valuable tool for identifying differences between animal and plant miRNAs at a molecular level."
https://openalex.org/W2534491882,"Previous studies have shown that the removal of one testis leads to a compensatory mechanism in the contralateral one, but this was species and age dependent. The aim of this study was to check whether this compensation would still occur after the combination of a unilateral orchiectomy and gonadotoxic treatment, since this resembles the clinical situation of patients who have to undergo highly toxic cancer treatment and therefore choose to cryopreserve a testicular biopsy for fertility restoration purposes.Sprague Dawley rats underwent either unilateral orchiectomy, gonadotoxic busulfan treatment, the combination of both or served as fertile control. A comparison of the compensatory effects was made between adult and prepubertal treated rats. Mating experiments were performed, testosterone levels were followed-up, testicular weight was recorded and histology was analysed.Adult treated rats were able to restore fertility spontaneously in all treatment groups. On the other hand, 30% of the rats that underwent a unilateral orchiectomy and gonadotoxic treatment at prepubertal age showed hampered spermatogenesis, low testosterone levels, decreased testicular weights and were not able to reproduce.This study emphasizes the need of fertility preservation strategies in prepubertal patients before gonadotoxic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2536801773,"A shortage of computed tomographic (CT) machines in low and middle income countries often results in delayed CT imaging for patients suspected of a stroke. Yet, time constraint is one of the most important aspects for patients with an ischemic stroke to benefit from thrombolytic therapy. We set out to assess whether application of the Siriraj Stroke Score is able to assist physicians in prioritizing patients with a high probability of having an ischemic stroke for urgent CT imaging.From the Malaysian National Neurology Registry, we selected patients aged 18 years and over with clinical features suggesting of a stroke, who arrived in the hospital 4.5 hours or less from ictus. The prioritization of receiving CT imaging was left to the discretion of the treating physician. We applied the Siriraj Stroke Score to all patients, refitted the score and defined a cut-off value to best distinguish an ischemic stroke from a hemorrhagic stroke.Of the 2176 patients included, 73% had an ischemic stroke. Only 33% of the ischemic stroke patients had CT imaging within 4.5 hours. The median door-to-scan time for these patients was 4 hours (IQR: 1;16). With the recalibrated score, it would have been possible to prioritize 95% (95% CI: 94%-96%) of patients with an ischemic stroke for urgent CT imaging.In settings where CT imaging capacity is limited, we propose the use of the Siriraj Stroke Score to prioritize patients with a probable ischemic stroke for urgent CT imaging."

Being able to celebrate a 30th birthday was once considered a miracle but only if one survived the perilous years of childhood. Indeed, the CDC reports that in 1900, nearly 30% of deaths worldwide occurred in children 5 and under. It is remarkable how far we’ve come in our ability to fight off pathogens. Better nutrition, medication, sanitation, and overall quality of life has meant that humans are now living longer than ever before in history."
https://openalex.org/W2531957452,"Pepper pericarp microbiota plays an important role in the pepper peeling process for the production of white pepper. We collected pepper samples at different peeling time points from Hainan Province, China, and used a metagenomic approach to identify changes in the pericarp microbiota based on functional gene analysis. UniFrac distance-based principal coordinates analysis revealed significant changes in the pericarp microbiota structure during peeling, which were attributed to increases in bacteria from the genera Selenomonas and Prevotella. We identified 28 core operational taxonomic units at each time point, mainly belonging to Selenomonas, Prevotella, Megasphaera, Anaerovibrio, and Clostridium genera. The results were confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. At the functional level, we observed significant increases in microbial features related to acetyl xylan esterase and pectinesterase for pericarp degradation during peeling. These findings offer a new insight into biodegradation for pepper peeling and will promote the development of the white pepper industry."
