https://openalex.org/W1603801897,"Abstract Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is known to be metabolized to 1α,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, and this sterol is thought to be the active form of the vitamin. The present report shows that administration of increasing amounts of radioactive vitamin D3 to vitamin D-deficient chicks results in a saturable binding of 1α,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol to the intestinal chromatin that parallels saturation of the calcium absorption response. The appearance of 1α,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol in the chromatin precedes the calcium absorption response by 2 to 8 hours after a physiologic dose of 1α,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. This sterol also specifically associates with the chromatin fraction after incubation with intestinal mucosa homogenates in vitro. The chromatin fraction contains a finite number of binding sites for 1α,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, and closely related sterols such as 25-hydroxycholecalciferol in equal concentration do not bind to this fraction; however, displacement of the hormone from the receptor can be achieved by concentrations of cholecalciferol = dihydrotachysterol2 >> 1α-hydroxycholecalciferol g 25-hydroxycholecalciferol >> 1α,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. Pretreatment of rachitic chicks with unlabeled vitamin D3 or 1α,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol reduced the subsequent binding of radioactive 1α,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol to the intestinal chromatin in vitro. It is concluded that localization of the apparent hormonal form of vitamin D3, 1α,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, in the nucleus of the target tissue is probably involved in the physiologic response of calcium transport."
https://openalex.org/W1541091328,"Abstract Specific binding of 1α,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol in the cytosol and purified chromatin fractions of chick small intestinal mucosa was studied to investigate the mechanism by which this hormone arrives at its chromatin binding site. The cytosol fraction of the mucosa contains a macromolecule with a high affinity (Kd = 2.2 x 10-9 m) for 1α,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol and has a limited number of binding sites which are saturated at low hormone concentrations (≃ 10-8 m). The association of the sterol with the cytoplasmic component is thermolabile, and is destroyed by treatment with pronase, but not by nucleases, and the receptor component is therefore presumed to be a protein. The protein-sterol complex was isolated and characterized by sucrose gradient centrifugation and sediments at 3 to 3.5 S in the presence of 0.15 m KCl. The interaction of 1α,25-dihydroxy[3H] cholecalciferol with the cytosol protein is reversed by unlabeled 1α,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol g 25-hydroxycholecalciferol g 1α,25-hydroxycholecalciferol g cholecalciferol ≃ estradiol-17β. The subcellular localization of 1α,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol is temperature-dependent. The hormone remains bound to the cytosol fraction at 0° in whole intestines in vitro, and a dramatic movement of 1α,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol to the nuclear chromatin occurs at 37°. The temperature dependence of the hormone localization is also evident in intestinal mucosa homogenates and reconstituted cytosol-chromatin systems. This observation suggests that the cell membrane and nuclear membrane are not involved in the temperature-dependent process. It is postulated that the specific cytosol receptor for 1α,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol functions to transport the hormone to its ultimate site of action in the nuclear chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W1501788884,"Abstract The rat uterine cytosol contains two estrogen-binding proteins (EBP) referred to as the and EBP. The 5 S EBP was produced by incubating the uterine cytosol-[3H]estradiol mixture at 28° for 30 min to promote the S to 5 S transformation as described by Jensen et al. ((1971) Biochem. Soc. Symp. 32, 133). These two EBP species were characterized in high ionic strength buffers using sucrose gradient centrifugation and Sephadex G-200 gel chromatography. With these analytical methods the sedimentation coefficient, molecular Stokes radii, and molecular weights were determined. In the presence of 0.4 m KCl at pH 7.4 the 4 S EBP has a sedimentation coefficient of 4.2 ± 0.04 S, a molecular Stokes radius of 44.0 ± 0.4 A, and a molecular weight of 76,200. While in the identical buffers the 5 S EBP has a sedimentation coefficient of 5.5 ± 0.02 S, a molecular Stokes radius of 58.5 ± 0.5 A, and a molecular weight of 132,700. In the presence of 0.4 m KCl and 3 m urea at pH 7.4 the 4 S EBP shows a decrease in its sedimentation to 3.6 ± 0.04 S, but an increase in its molecular Stokes radius to 53.8 ± 0.9 A. The estimated molecular weight is 79,900. The 5 S EBP has a sedimentation coefficient of 4.6 ± 0.9 S and a molecular Stokes radius of 70.6 ± 1.0 A. The molecular weight is 133,900. In addition, sucrose gradient centrifugation analyses, in the presence of 0.4 m KCl, 3 m urea at pH 7.4 showed that a moderate fraction (25 to 50%) of the 5 S EBP is dissociated to the 4 S EBP. In the presence of 0.4 m KCl at pH 6.8 the 4 S and 5 S EBPs sediment at 4.7 ± 0.04 and 5.6 ± 0.05 S, respectively. The 5 S EBP also shows a tendency to revert to the 4 S EBP. Consequently, it was observed that a combination of 0.4 m KCl and 3 m urea at pH 6.8 is extremely effective, in contrast to using each of these reagents alone, in dissociating the 5 S EBP to the 4 S EBP without causing a loss of [3H]estradiol binding. The dissociation process is first order with a half-life of approximately 5 hours. These results indicate that the in vitro S to 5 S transformation is an association of the 4 S EBP, having a molecular weight of ∼80,000, with a second component or subunit of ∼50,000 to form the 5 S EBP (∼130,000). Concurrent with the association process, the 4 S and 5 S EBPs are also capable of marked conformational changes that were discerned when the EBPs were compared to the protein standards under identical conditions. The protein standards used were myoglobin, trypsin, ovalbumin, serum albumin, alkaline phosphatase, aldolase, γ-globulin, and ferritin. The conformational changes of the EBPs were shown by their sedimentation coefficients and molecular Stokes radii varying in a reciprocating manner while their molecular weights remained constant."

Viral RNA and antigens are increased as much as 20-fold, and culture fluid supernatants from steroid-treated cells contain type B particles with reverse transcriptase. These cells provide a possible tissue culture source of this virus and a model system for studying the mechanism of action of corticosteroids and the regulation of transcription of integrated viral DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1504726355,"Abstract The total carbohydrate composition of an IgE myeloma protein has been determined. Mannose, N-acetylglucosamine, galactose, sialic acid, and fucose were found to be present in the amount of 16, 12, 7, 5, and 4 moles, respectively, per mole of heavy chain. Previously it had been determined that all of the carbohydrate moieties were located on the heavy chain of the IgE protein (Kochwa, S., Terry, W. D., Capra, J. D., and Yang, N. L. (1971) Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 190, 49). Five major glycopeptide-containing fractions were isolated after pronase degradation of the protein. The type designated B contained sialic acid, fucose, mannose, galactose, and N-acetylglucosamine in the molar ratios of 1 to 2:1:3:2:4. Three of the B-type oligosaccharide units were found to be present per heavy chain. The complete structure of these glycopeptides is presented in the following paper (Baenziger, J., Kochwa, S., and Kornfeld, S. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 1897). In addition, a high mannose glycopeptide, termed C-1, was isolated which contained only mannose and N-acetylglucosamine in the ratio of 6:2. Only one chain of this type was present per heavy chain. The complete sequence of this glycopeptide was determined using a combination of sequential enzymatic degradation, periodate oxidation, and methylation. After removal of 4 of the 6 mannose residues with α-mannosidase, a core with the following sequence remained. Man (β1,4)/→ GlcNAc(α1,3)/→ Man (β1,4)/→ GlcNAc (β)/→ Asn This is the first example of an α-linked N-acetylglucosamine to be described in a circulating glycoprotein. This glycopeptide is also unusual in that it does not have the more commonly found chitobiose core unit (GlcNAc (β1,4)/→ GlcNAc (β)/→ Asn) and gives no evidence of microheterogeneity."
https://openalex.org/W1544177485,Abstract The Trp-59 fluorescence of ferricytochrome c is extremely sensitive to the over-all protein conformation. Equilibrium unfolding monitored by the Trp-59 fluorescence reveals several points of interest. (a) The protein retains certain residual structures in solutions of guanidine HCl after a major conformational transition is over. These structures continue to disintegrate at higher guanidine HCl concentrations. (b) Iron-binding ligands which displace the Met-80 coordination to the heme completely abolish the 695-nm absorption band but have no significant effect on the tryptophan fluorescence and the stability of the protein toward guanidine HCl denaturation. (c) Acidification of the protein in 4 m guanidine HCl detects a spin state transformation of the heme group around pH 5.2. This reaction appears to have little effect on the over-all protein conformation and is not observable by the tryptophan fluorescence.
https://openalex.org/W1583635488,"Abstract Preparations of partially purified rat brain tubulin contain protein kinase activity that phosphorylates tubulin preferentially on the β chain. The protein kinase activity associated with tubulin is independent of adenosine 3' : 5'-monophosphate and is not affected by incubation with colchicine or vinblastine. Protamine is the best exogenous substrate for this protein kinase activity; histone and casein also act as substrates. Incubation of tubulin with [γ-32P]ATP gives a maximum molar incorporation of phosphate into tubulin of 0.1 mole of 32P per mole of tubulin dimer; tryptic maps of this in vitro 32P-tubulin show that there are at least five major 32P-tryptic peptides. Gel filtration of native in vitro 32P-tubulin indicates that all of the tubulin that is labeled with 32P is aggregated; no tubulin dimer is labeled. The tubulin dimer does not have protein kinase activity, but it was not possible to achieve a complete separation of protein kinase activity from aggregated tubulin. Based on the low specific activity of the protein kinase activity associated with aggregated tubulin, the different temperature stability of protein kinase activity and colchicine binding activity, and partial solubilization of protein kinase activity, it is suggested that no form of tubulin has protein kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1607256394,"Abstract The mechanism for regulation of α-ketoglutarate metabolism by the phosphorylation state of the intramitochondrial nucleotides has been investigated using intact rat and guinea pig liver mitochondria and isolated α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Depletion of ATP under conditions of either high or low intramitochondrial NADH levels was achieved by addition of oligomycin plus ADP and glucose-hexokinase as an extramitochondrial ATP trapping system to State 4 or uncoupled mitochondria, or by a stimulation of the rate of GTP utilization for P-enolpyruvate synthesis by malate addition. A decrease of the ATP:ADP ratio in rat liver mitochondria resulted in a decrease of the succinyl-CoA to CoA-SH ratio. The GTP:GDP ratio, calculated by assuming equilibrium at succinate thiokinase, also decreased over a 4-fold range but the measured GTP content (approximately 0.2 nmoles per mg of protein) remained constant within analytical error. Nucleoside diphosphate kinase was calculated to be displaced from equilibrium by about two orders of magnitude. Flux through α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, as measured by α-ketoglutarate uptake, varied inversely with the succinyl-CoA to CoA-SH ratio at both high and low levels of intramitochondrial NADH. The rate of α-ketoglutarate uptake by mitochondria having approximately equal intramitochondrial phosphate potentials and succinyl-CoA to CoA-SH ratios was greater at low than at high ratios of NADH:NAD. Addition of malate to guinea pig liver mitochondria incubated with α-ketoglutarate in the presence of uncoupler and oligomycin caused a 2-fold stimulation of α-ketoglutarate uptake, a 4.4-fold increase of P-enolpyruvate production and a 4-fold decrease of the succinyl-CoA to CoA-SH ratio. The ATP content decreased from 3.5 to 1.1 nmoles per mg of protein while the GTP content changed insignificantly from 0.21 to 0.18 nmoles per mg of protein. With guinea pig liver mitochondria at low NADH levels, a linear relationship was obtained between the reciprocal of the α-ketoglutarate uptake and the succinyl-CoA to CoA-SH ratio, which provided a value of 1.6 for the ratio of Michaelis constant for CoA-SH to the inhibition constant for succinylCoA. Initial velocity kinetics with purified pig heart α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase showed that succinyl-CoA and NADH were strong inhibitors, but no inhibitory effects were obtained with GTP or ATP. The inhibition by succinyl-CoA was independent of the NADH:NAD ratio and was competitive with CoA-SH. At high α-ketoglutarate and NAD concentrations, the Km for CoA-SH was 2.7 µm and the Ki for succinyl-CoA was 6.9 µm. Inhibition by NADH was noncompetitive with respect to both NAD and α-ketoglutarate. At high α-ketoglutarate and CoA-SH concentrations, the Km for NAD was 21 µm and the Ki for NADH was 4.5 µm. It is concluded that regulation of flux through α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase by the state of phosphorylation of the nucleotide systems in rat and guinea pig liver mitochondria is achieved primarily by variations of the succinyl-CoA to CoA-SH ratio and to a lesser extent by variations of the NAD oxidation-reduction state. There are no grounds for supposing a direct effect via GTP or ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1524939360,"Abstract In the preceding paper (Baenziger, J., Kornfeld, S., and Kochwa, S. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 1889) it was shown that an IgE myeloma protein has 4 oligosaccharide units per heavy chain, 1 of which contains only mannose and N-acetylglucosamine while the other 3 contain sialic acid, fucose, galactose, mannose, and N-acetylglucosamine in the ratio of 1 to 2:1:2:3:4. The data in this paper establish the structure of the three sialic acid-containing glycopeptides, designated B-1, B-2, and B-3. Glycopeptides B-2 and B-3 are branched structures containing two nonreducing termini with the sequence sialic acid (α2,6)/→ Gal (β1,4)/→ GlcNAc (β1,2)/→ Man (α)/→, while B-1 has one nonreducing terminus with the above structure and another with the sequence Gal (β1,4)/→ GlcNAc (β1,2)/→ Man (α)/→. The core of all three B-glycopeptides is identical and has the sequence: [see PDF for sequence] The branch of B-1 terminating in sialic acid originates from position 3 of the β-linked mannose in the core while the branch terminating in galactose originates from position 6 of this mannose."

https://openalex.org/W1554335583,"Abstract Four fractions of protein kinase activity were resolved and partially purified from the ribosome-free supernatant fraction of rabbit reticulocytes and erythrocytes by DEAE-cellulose and phosphocellulose chromatography. The protein kinase activities from reticulocytes were studied under a variety of assay conditions, and the enzymes were characterized with respect to the capacity to interact with cyclic adenosine 3' : 5'-monophosphate (cAMP), stimulation by cAMP, the effects of isolated regulatory subunit and heatstable inhibitor protein on activity, substrate specificity, and the effects of monovalent and divalent cations. The enzymes were classified into three types according to previously established criteria (Traugh, J. A., Ashby, C. D., and Walsh, D. A. (1974) Methods Enzymol., in press). Three of the resolved enzyme fractions were found to be cAMP-regulated: two of the enzyme activities were identified as cAMP-dependent holoenzyme consisting of regulatory and catalytic subunits (type I); one activity was the free catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (type II). The fourth enzyme fraction was a cAMP-independent protein kinase (type III), with properties similar to phosvitin and casein kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1548784481,"Abstract A new apoprotein has been isolated from delipidated human very low density lipoproteins by Sepharose 6B chromatography in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride. This water-insoluble protein was noted to be unique to the plasma very low density and chylomicron fractions. This protein was shown to be homogeneous by urea-DEAE-cellulose chromatography, rechromatography in a guanidine-Sepharose system, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and isoelectric focusing. The molecular weight of this apoprotein obtained by guanidine gel filtration, sedimentation equilibrium in guanidine hydrochloride, and by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 33,000. The amino acid content was significantly different from any previously characterized very low density lipoprotein apoprotein, containing relatively more arginine. By the dansylation and cyanate techniques the NH2-terminal amino acid was found to be lysine. Digestion with carboxypeptidase revealed the COOH-terminal sequence to be -Leu-Ser-Ala-COOH."
https://openalex.org/W1563179743,"Abstract Incubation of testis seminiferous tubules with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) results within 5 min in an activation of soluble adenosine 3' : 5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase, as indicated by a conversion of the inactive holoenzyme to the active catalytic subunit. Maximal stimulation (3-fold) is achieved by 20 min. Moreover, this increased kinase activity can be directly correlated with increased intracellular accumulation of cAMP. Activation of protein kinase in isolated tubules is specific for FSH and is dependent upon time and temperature of incubation. This response to FSH is also dependent upon the age of the animal and disappears at approximately 30 days. However, sensitivity to gonadotrophin can be restored in adult animals by hypophysectomy or by addition of 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine to the incubation medium. These results suggest that the appearance of an active phosphodiesterase may be responsible for the decreased response to FSH during spermatogenesis. Increased protein kinase activity in response to the continued presence of FSH exhibits a half-life time of 2 to 4 hours. Furthermore, bound FSH can be recovered following treatment of the tissue of acid pH and this hormone retains the ability to activate protein kinase in fresh tissue suggesting that FSH may not be degraded while attached to testicular receptors. Excellent temporal correlation exists between binding of FSH and activation of protein kinase. Maximal enzyme activation occurs at a lower concentration of FSH than is necessary to saturate testicular binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1529587950,"Abstract Structurally related oligosaccharides have been isolated from freshly frozen liver from cases of Gm1-gangliosidosis, type I, an inherited glycolipid storage disease. In the three major fractions of approximate molecular weight, 1400, 1800, and 2200, respectively, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, and mannose were the main components. From periodate oxidation, proton magnetic resonance, optical rotation, and methylation studies, it was concluded that the molecular weight 1800 oligosaccharide had the structure [see PDF for equation] with 1 additional Gal β1→4 GlcNAc disaccharide unit linked β1→4 to either of the monosubstituted mannose residues. The molecular weight 1400 fraction lacked this additional disaccharide. In the molecular weight 2200 fraction the terminal N-acetylglucosamine was glycosidically linked. The anomeric configurations were confirmed by digestions with appropriate enzymes. The oligosaccharides likely derive from erythrocyte stromal glycoproteins whose normal breakdown is impaired during development by the deficient β-galactosidase activity present in this disease."
https://openalex.org/W1480116313,"Abstract [3H]Oxytocin, incubated with rat uterine segments, was bound specifically, and about equally, to the three particulate fractions obtained by homogenization and centrifugation at 1,000, 20,000, and 105,000 x g. There apparently was no binding in the cytosol fraction. [3H]Oxytocin, added directly to rat uterine particles sedimenting between 1,000 and 20,000 x g, was bound with an apparent Kd of 1.8 x 10-9 m; 0.18 pmole of oxytocin was bound per mg of protein. For the 20,000 x g particulate fraction of the uterus from a pregnant sow, the apparent Kd for oxytocin binding was 1.5 x 10-9 m; 0.15 pmole of oxytocin was bound per mg of protein. The affinity of oxytocin for the 105,000 x g particles from sow uterus was about 3 times greater than for the 20,000 x g particles. The binding constants are of the same order as the concentration of oxytocin which elicits a half-maximal uterine response. The binding of [3H]oxytocin by sow uterine 20,000 x g particles was maximal by 40 min at 20°. Less binding occurred at 37 and 0° than at 20°. The competition for [3H]oxytocin binding sites by synthetic analogs of oxytocin was specific: oxytocin = [4-threonine]-oxytocin = [8-valine]oxytocin g [8-lysine]vasopressin >> [4-proline]oxytocin. Binding was optimal in the range of pH 7.4 to 7.8, was enhanced by Mn2+ and Co2+ g Mg2+ g Zn2+, and was absent with 1 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetate. The concentrations of Mn2+ giving maximal and half-maximal augmentation of binding were 5 and 0.4 mm, respectively. Ca2+, 5 mm, did not affect binding. A portion of the [3H]oxytocin appeared to be metabolized during the incubation with sow uterine particles. The uterine oxytocin receptor site is protein, at least in part, because binding was reduced by trypsin, —SH reagents such as N-ethylmaleimide, p-chloromercuribenzoate, and by thioglycollate. Phospholipases A and C inhibited binding; however, their inhibitory activities appeared to be separate from their catalytic activities. Neuraminidase, phospholipase D, butanedione, and sodium fluoride did not affect [3H]oxytocin binding. Binding was depressed by guanosine triphosphate, cytosine triphosphate, and uridine triphosphate. However, 1 mm ATP inhibited binding by more than twice as much as the other nucleoside triphosphates. The high affinity and ligand specificity of the uterine binding sites for oxytocin indicate that the binding protein is part of the oxytocin receptor system."
https://openalex.org/W1702274300,"Abstract The superoxide radical produced by xanthine oxidase can be coupled to oxidation of NADH in the presence of lactate dehydrogenase. The oxidized product has been identified as the enzymatically active NAD+. If the superoxide radical is determined quantitatively by its interaction with ferricytochrome c under similar conditions, it can be estimated that for each superoxide radical produced in the xanthine oxidase system an average of 6.2 molecules of NADH can be oxidized, which indicates a chain reaction in the oxidation process. The lactate dehydrogenase-catalyzed oxidation activity can be inhibited by either superoxide dismutase or oxamate."
https://openalex.org/W1598009079,"Abstract Product inhibition patterns and patterns for dead end inhibition by 1-deoxy-d-fructose-6-P and the chromium complex of ATP have been determined for rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase at pH 7.4, 25°. Nucleotides are mutually competitive, as are sugars, with nucleotides being noncompetitive versus sugars and vice versa, except that MgATP appears competitive versus fructose-P2. These data establish that the kinetic mechanism is random, with the formation of a dead end E-MgADP-fructose-6-P complex, but little or no E-MgATP-fructose-P2 complex. Quantitative analysis of the inhibitions and comparison with the initial velocity data from the previous paper suggest that the rapid equilibrium assumption holds in the reverse reaction, but that with MgATP and fructose-6-P as substrates the rate constants for release of these substrates are less than Vmax, with the result that the initial velocity patterns appear parallel or nearly so. In the absence of nucleotides, fructose-6-P binds to phosphofructokinase 30-fold more tightly than 1-deoxyfructose-6-P, showing that the 1-OH is important for binding, but in the presence of MgATP the affinities are the same, suggesting that the conformation change which normally produces catalysis by generating compression between the two substrates causes deoxyfructose-6-P and MgATP to move closer to each other and thus be more tightly bound when the 1-OH is missing. Similarly, in the absence of sugars MgATP is bound 20-fold more tightly than the chromium complex of ATP, but in the presence of fructose-6-P the affinities are the same. The chromium complex of ADP does not show the effect, although its affinity for free enzyme is the same as that of the chromium complex of ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1654065879,"Double-stranded, covalently closed circular DNA from phage PM2 was either treated with methyl methanesulfonate, irradiated with ultraviolet light, or irradiated with γ-rays to introduce a small number of lesions per DNA molecule. The damaged DNA preparations were then exposed to an endonuclease from calf thymus that catalyzes the formation of single strand interruptions at apurinic sites in double-stranded DNA. DNA containing 2 to 3 alkylated residues per molecule was not attacked by the enzyme. DNA exposed to ultraviolet light was sensitized to the ultraviolet endonuclease from Micrococcus luteus, which attacks DNA containing pyrimidine dimers, but was resistant to the thymus endonuclease. On incubation in solution, alkali-labile sites appeared in the damaged DNA molecules as secondary lesions, and simultaneously the DNA became sensitive to the enzyme. Similar results were obtained with γ-irradiated DNA. The thymus endonuclease apparently is specific for apurinic sites and analogous lesions involving loss of a base residue from DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1574672978,"Abstract An improved, simplified procedure is described for the isolation of liver cells from rat or chicken. Livers were perfused in situ and then incubated in a solution of collagenase and hyaluronidase. Greater than 50% of the liver mass was converted into a suspension of intact parenchymal cells which excluded a vital stain and were undamaged when viewed with the electron microscope. The cells actively incorporated labeled precursors into lipids and proteins without specific cofactor requirements in both simple, ionic, and complex culture media. The chicken hepatocytes synthesized lipids and proteins for several days in suspension culture, but suspended rat hepatocytes had minimal biosynthetic activity after 24 hours. Both dibutyryl cyclic AMP (0.1 mm) and adenosine 3' : 5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) (0.1 mm) produced a similar striking inhibition of [1-14C]acetate incorporation into lipids in chicken hepatocytes. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP was less inhibitory to lipid synthesis by rat liver cells and cyclic AMP had no effect on this process. The inhibitory actions of dibutyryl cyclic AMP were probably not due to isotopic dilution of the label within the cells. Neither cyclic nucleotide had a lipolytic effect in vitro on hepatocyte lipids prelabeled in vivo. The inhibitory action of dibutyryl cyclic AMP on lipogenesis was significantly greater than the effect of twice the concentration of sodium butyrate, and 5'-AMP did not diminish hepatic lipid synthesis. It is postulated that hepatic lipid synthesis is inhibited specifically by cyclic nucleotides, and that hormonal stimulation of adenylate cyclase regulates hepatic lipid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W127461588,"Abstract Bacitracin was tritiated by the Wilzbach technique and purified by carboxymethylcellulose chromatography. Binding studies between [3H]bacitracin and Micrococcus lysodeikticus cells and protoplasts indicated that the cells or protoplasts were saturated at 2 x 105 molecules per cell. This value correlates well with the number of C55-isoprenyl pyrophosphate molecules found in the membrane and adds further support to the hypothesis that the antibiotic activity of this peptide is due to complex formation with this functional lipid. The Km for binding of bacitracin to cells or protoplasts was 3.7 x 10-6 molar which is consistent with the in vitro binding constant of 1 x 106 m-1 observed for the interaction of bacitracin A with the purified C55-isoprenyl pyrophosphate. In vitro binding studies between bacitracin A and purified bacterial phospholipids indicated that the antibiotic does not interact strongly with these lipids. It is concluded from these studies that binding of bacitracin to the bacterial cells can be accounted for quantitatively by virtue of a specific interaction with the membrane C55-isoprenyl pyrophosphate. Furthermore, the protoplast permeability changes induced by bacitracin, under certain conditions, may arise from interaction between bacitracin and the C55-isoprenyl pyrophosphate molecules in the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1543617877,"Abstract Light nerve endings from guinea pig cerebral cortex were incubated with [32P]orthophosphate, myo[3H]inositol, [3H]glycerol, or [3H]glucose in the presence or absence of cholinergic agents. Acetylcholine and carbamylcholine increased incorporation of 32Pi into phosphatidic acid 100% and into various classes of phosphatidylinositol 20 to 70%. These agents also stimulated the labeling of phosphatidylinositol from myo[3H]inositol but did not affect the labeling of either phosphatidylinositol or phosphatidic acid from [3H]glycerol or from [3H]glucose. The specific activity of synaptosomal [γ-32P]ATP was unchanged. In a series of two-step incubations, lipids were first labeled with 32Pi, then excess unlabeled Pi or 2,4-dinitrophenol was added to lower the specific activity or the amount of [γ32P]-ATP. The addition of acetylcholine stimulated the rate of disappearance of [32P]phosphatidic acid by 80%. This effect of acetylcholine was blocked by atropine. We conclude that cholinergic agents increase phospholipid labeling by increasing the hydrolysis of phosphatidate."
https://openalex.org/W1538623164,"Abstract The glutaminase activity of glutamine-dependent carbamyl phosphate synthetase (Escherichia coli) and that of the separated light subunit of this enzyme, as well as the glutaminedependent synthetase activity catalyzed by the native enzyme, are inactivated by incubation in air with relatively low concentrations (0.025 to 1 mm) of dithiothreitol; oxidized dithiothreitol does not inhibit. Other mercaptans (glutathione, 2-mercaptoethanol, dithioerythritol) also inhibit. Low concentrations of dithiothreitol under nitrogen and high concentrations (5 to 25 mm) of dithiothreitol in air do not inactivate the glutamine-related functions of the separated light subunit or of the native enzyme. However, enzyme preparations that have been inhibited by low concentrations of dithiothreitol in air are not readily reactivated by treatment with high concentrations of dithiothreitol. Incubation of the native enzyme with hydrogen peroxide (0.2 mm) also inhibits the glutamine-dependent activities. In distinction, treatment of the enzyme with either hydrogen peroxide or low concentrations of dithiothreitol in air does not affect either the ammonia-dependent synthetase activity or the synthesis of ATP from ADP and carbamyl phosphate, while the bicarbonate-dependent hydrolysis of ATP is stimulated moderately by both of these reagents. The addition of catalase as well as the addition of l-albizziin, l-glutamine, EDTA, or a mixture of ATP, magnesium ions, bicarbonate, and l-ornithine protect against inhibition of the glutamine-dependent synthetase activity by dithiothreitol. Neither l-ornithine (a positive allosteric effector) nor UMP (a negative allosteric effector) significantly affects the inhibition while a high protein concentration (10 mg per ml) protects against inhibition. The glutaminase activity of the separated light subunit, like that of the intact enzyme, is inhibited by the glutamine analog l-2-amino-4-oxo-5-chloropentanoic acid (chloroketone); l-glutamine or l-albizziin can protect against this inhibition. [14C]Chloroketone binds to the dithiothreitol-inhibited enzyme to the same extent as it does to the native enzyme; such binding is reduced in the presence of glutamine. The most straightforward interpretation of the present results is that metal ion-catalyzed oxidation of dithiothreitol produces hydrogen peroxide which oxidizes one or more critical residues in the glutamine binding site of the light subunit. Such oxidation does not involve the sulfhydryl group which in the native enzyme reacts with chloroketone, nor does it involve a sulfhydryl group on the light subunit whose reaction with N-ethylmaleimide in the presence of ATP, magnesium ions, and bicarbonate, leads to loss of glutamine-dependent synthetase activity and to enhanced glutaminase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1505530830,"Abstract The organ specificity of human adenylate kinase isoenzymes was established among adenylate kinase isoenzymes of different tissue origins by differences in the degree of inhibitions by sulfhydryl reagents; by differences in isoelectric points; by differences of enzyme distribution patterns; and in some instances by differences in molecular weights. The organ specificity of the adenylate kinase isoenzymes obtained also in dog, rat, guinea pig, rooster, fish, and cow. At least six different tissue-specific adenylate kinase isoenzymes were evident in man and several other animal species. The organ specificity of the adenylate kinase was further supported by serological studies. An antiserum against rabbit muscle adenylate kinase inhibited extensively the adenylate kinase activities of the skeletal muscles from all of the species tested, but inhibited slightly or did not inhibit the adenylate kinase activities from the liver or kidneys of these species. The adenylate kinase activities from other tissues showed degrees of inhibition by the antiserum intermediate to liver or kidney adenylate kinase and skeletal muscle adenylate kinase."

https://openalex.org/W1552355184,"Abstract The activity of DPN-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase is dependent on the concentration of magnesium d-isocitrate (MgI-) under conditions where the concentrations of free Mg2+ and isocitrate approach zero and saturation, respectively. These results can be interpreted in terms of magnesium isocitrate as the active substrate, however the present data cannot rule out the possibility of free Mg2+ and isocitrate as the substrates if the reaction mechanism is rapid equilibrium ordered with free Mg2+ being the first reactant. In the absence of ADP and in presence of 0.33 mm DPN+, S0.5 of magnesium dl-isocitrate has been found to be 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, and 1.0 mm at pH 6.65, 7.2, 7.4, and 7.75, respectively, with values of Hill slopes (n) near 2. Excess free Mg2+ causes apparent inhibition which is competitive with respect to magnesium isocitrate, the proposed substrate of the reaction. The inhibition by Mg2+ is much more severe at pH 6.65 than at pH 7.2 and above, e.g. the inhibition constant for Mg2+ is 40- to 80-fold larger at pH 7.2 than at pH 6.65. In contrast to the results which are consistent with magnesium isocitrate as the substrate, free ADP3- is the modifier of the enzyme and MgADP- is inactive. At pH 7.2 and 7.4, increasing concentrations of ADP3- lead to decreasing values of S0.5 for magnesium isocitrate accompanied by a decline of Hill slopes from n = 2 to near unity; these changes are less pronounced at pH 6.65. The values of Vmax are the same in the absence and presence of ADP at each pH tested; however, Vmax at pH 6.65 is about one-half of that at pH 7.2 and above. There is an interdependence in the interaction of the enzyme with substrate and modifier. Thus, at pH 7.2 and 7.4, the values of Km for ADP3- decline with increasing concentrations of magnesium isocitrate; however, the Hill slopes for ADP3- are not influenced by substrate concentration and remain constant at m = 1 between pH 6.65 and 7.75. A reaction model has been proposed in which initial binding of substrate to the enzyme at one site leads to a conformational change and subsequent binding of magnesium isocitrate at an additional site which is catalytically active."
https://openalex.org/W1602555107,"Abstract The interconversions and properties of uterine cytoplasmic receptor proteins have been studied. In general the properties analyzed are those pertaining to the binding of the cytosol receptors to membranes or nucleohistone. Specific cytoplasmic estradiol receptors are found in both the endometrial and myometrial layers of both mature and immature heifers. The level of receptors is highest in immature tissues. The 4 S and 9 S receptors have similar binding properties and probably represent different levels of molecular complexity of the same receptor. The 4 S and 5 S receptors have very different binding properties in that the 4 S estradiol-receptor binds membranes in a temperature dependent process requiring the presence of divalent cations, whereas the 5 S receptor binds nucleohistone in a very rapid reaction even at 4°, in the absence of divalent cations. A small amount of 4 S receptor also binds to nucleohistone but only at elevated temperatures (25°) and in the absence of divalent cations. A small measure of specificity for target organ material is seen in the binding of 4 S estradiol-receptor to membranes. No specificity for target tissue was noted for 5 S estradiol-receptor binding to nuclear material. The 4 S form of the estradiol-receptor complex is converted into the 5 S estradiol-receptor in a reaction which does not require the presence of chromatin, but is dependent upon an elevated temperature and the presence of estradiol. Immature uterine tissue does not contain the 5 S receptor if assayed directly, but if the tissue is preincubated with estradiol, the formation of the 5 S receptor can be demonstrated, arguing that the 4 S-5 S conversion occurs within the cell in a reaction requiring the presence of estradiol. Since after incubation the 5 S estradiol-receptor is present in the cytoplasm in vivo and can bind nuclear material instantaneously at 4°, we have raised the possibility that the 5 S estradiol-receptor found associated with nuclear material could have been translocated and bound during the homogenization of the tissue."

https://openalex.org/W1517479217,"Abstract Pancreatic DNase is inactivated rapidly by reaction with methane sulfonyl chloride. Eight sites are sulfonylated at pH 7 with 98% loss in activity. At pH 5, the reaction is more specific and 0.7 to 0.8 site is sulfonylated at 70 to 80% loss in activity. Above the 70 to 80% decrease in activity there is significant sulfonylation of a second site. Calcium ions can partially protect the enzyme against inactivation by methane sulfonyl chloride. The main site sulfonylated at pH 5 is serine. The rate of desulfonylation of inactivated DNase in acid or base parallels the lability of model sulfonyl serines and is far faster than desulfonylation of tyrosine or histidine. Lysine is also a possible site for sulfonylation. The 9 lysine residues in DNase can be converted quantitatively to homoarginine by reaction with O-methyl isourea and the modified protein has 70% of initial enzymic activity. This homoarginine derivative of DNase with all 9 lysines blocked still loses activity at the same rate on treatment with methane sulfonyl chloride. Sulfonylated serines can be treated with the nucleophile β-mercaptoethylamine to form S-aminoethylcysteine which is stable to acid hydrolysis and can be measured on the amino acid analyzer. Sulfonylated, inactive DNase treated with β-mercaptoethylamine gives yields of S-aminoethylcysteine which indicate that a single serine residue has been sulfonylated and is critical for DNase activity. Carboxylate side chains of aspartic and glutamic acid residues probably participate in Ca2+ binding to DNase. When DNase is treated with the carboxyl group selective reagent 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide, 18 to 20 carboxyl groups are modified within 20 min and over 90% of the enzyme activity is lost. In the presence of 0.1 m CaCl2, only 11 to 12 carboxyl groups are modified and 46% of the activity is lost. Calcium protects six to eight critical carboxyl groups from the carbodiimide reaction."

https://openalex.org/W2119479379,"Abstract Proteins L7 and L12 from the 50 S ribosomal subunit are required for polypeptide chain initiation in Escherchia coli. Ribosomes deficient in these proteins cannot participate in initiation factor IF-2 dependent hydrolysis of guanosine triphosphate (either coupled or uncoupled from initiation); activity can be restored by the addition of either L7 or L12. N-Formyl methionyl transfer RNA binding to ribosomes is also impaired in the absence of L7 and L12. The results indicate that L7 or L12 is required for the catalytic function of IF-2 in binding N-formyl methionyl transfer RNA to ribosomes. In each reaction tested, L7 and L12 are about equal in efficiency in restoring activity to depleted 50 S subunits. These results are discussed in light of the current information on the role of these ribosomal proteins in other partial reactions or protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1530743165,"Abstract This study is a consideration of the condition and distribution of tRNA in rabbit reticulocytes. Levels of tRNA aminoacylation by 18 different amino acids were determined by assaying tRNA resistance to periodate oxidation. The levels range from 71% aminoacylation for tRNA accepting glycine to 97% for tRNAs accepting leucine and phenylalanine, with most values being close to 90%. Amounts of tRNA accepting the 18 amino acids which are attached to ribosomes were determined. Yields of ribosomal material from known numbers of reticulocytes are equivalent to 100,000 80 S ribosomal monomers per cell. There are approximately 100,000 tRNA molecules per cell attached to these ribosomes, this being approximately one-quarter of the total reticulocyte tRNA content. The numbers of ribosomal tRNA molecules for the different amino acids vary widely and have no demonstrable relationship to rabbit hemoglobin amino acid composition or to the content of tRNA for these amino acids in whole reticulocytes. More than half of the total reticulocyte tRNA for leucine and phenylalanine is attached to ribosomes while only 10% of serine and alanine tRNA is ribosomal. The results are discussed in relation to the cycling of different kinds of tRNA during hemoglobin synthesis and to the possibility that the availability of certain tRNA species may limit the rate of hemoglobin synthesis in reticulocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1555995016,"Abstract Highly purified, stable preparations of adenosine monophosphate nucleosidase (EC 3.2.2.4) have been studied by initial velocity kinetics in order to determine the kinetic parameters of the enzyme and the relationships between the substrate and modifier sites. The results indicate that AMP nucleosidase contains interdependent modifier sites which can be occupied by MgATP2-, ATP4-, or MgPPi to give catalytically competent enzyme-activator complexes. MgATP2- is the most effective activator with ATP4- and MgPPi being less effective. The presence of saturating concentrations of activator increased the initial velocity from 100- to 400-fold over that in the absence of activator. The Hill coefficients for all three activator species are between 2.5 and 3.5 and are not affected by the concentration of AMP, the substrate of the reaction. The substrate sites exhibit interdependent kinetic behavior only at low activator concentrations and give linear double reciprocal plots of initial velocity as a function of AMP concentration at higher concentrations of activator. At high concentrations of the substrate, AMP, apparent substrate inhibition occurs. Kinetic results are consistent with this inhibition occurring by AMP combination at the modifier sites, thereby displacing the activator. Such inhibition occurs with each of the activators tested. Kinetic studies of the inhibition by AMP showed that the enzyme complex with AMP saturating at both the substrate and modifier sites retains a basal level of activity. This finding was substantiated by the demonstration of equivalent basal activity in the absence of activators. Kinetic studies of the activator-free AMP hydrolysis were consistent with the substrate sites maintaining a low rate of hydrolytic activity when the modifier sites are unoccupied. Saturation of the modifier sites with AMP leads to an increase in the rate of hydrolysis at the substrate sites. The enzyme is strongly inhibited by low concentrations of inorganic phosphate and by higher concentrations of sulfate. This inhibition occurs by competition with respect to the modifier site. From the kinetic parameters obtained, it is suggested that AMP nucleosidase is regulated in vivo by the intracellular ratios of MgATP2- and inorganic phosphate."

https://openalex.org/W1555940285,"Abstract Some kinetic and allosteric properties of crystalline chicken liver phosphofructokinase were investigated. Lineweaver-Burk plots with fructose 6-phosphate and ATP as substrates yield a series of apparently parallel lines. The liver enzyme also catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose-1-P, and the double reciprocal plot with fructose-1-P as the substrate yields intersecting lines. Phosphorylation of both fructose-6-P and fructose-1-P are lost at 4° at equal rate. Of the many sugar phosphates examined, only glucose-6-P, 6-P-gluconate, and ribulose-5-P relieve ATP inhibition of liver phosphofructokinase. These sugar-Ps are competitive inhibitors of fructose-6-P at noninhibitory concentrations of ATP. Isocitrate and citrate inhibit phosphofructokinase, while NADH does not. Arrhenius plots of enzyme activity of both ATP inhibited and unhibited activities show a sharp break at approximately 15°. The Km value for ATP decreases from 0.041 mm to 0.012 mm below the transition temperature, while the Km for fructose-6-P is not affected by different temperature. These results suggest the existence of two different conformational states of liver phosphofructokinase. Fructose 1,6-diphosphatase at high concentration enhances ATP inhibition of phosphofructokinase, but at lower concentration it relieves the inhibition. The maximum inhibition by FDPase is usually obtained at a molar ratio (fructose diphosphatase to phosphofructokinase) of approximately 150. Moreover, fructose diphosphatase protects phosphofructokinase against cold inactivation. Physiological significance of these observations and a possible mechanism for the regulation of phosphofructokinase by fructose diphosphatase are discussed."

These studies eliminated the possibility that the enzyme contained regulatory subunits. The enzyme was crystallized with both oxidized and reduced coenzyme bound to the protein. Kinetic studies of phosphoglycerate oxidation have been made possible by substitution of 3-acetylpyridine DPN (3-AcPy-DPN) for DPN in the assay system.

https://openalex.org/W1543794486,"Abstract Two enzyme activities which catalyze phosphoribosyl-1-amine synthesis from phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate and glutamine and from phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate and ammonia were partially purified from human lymphoblasts (Burkitt lymphoma) maintained in tissue culture. The two enzyme activities were separated from each other by Sephadex G-100 chromatography. The elution pattern from a Sephadex G-100 column showed two distinct peaks of enzyme activities: peak activity for glutamine phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase corresponded to a molecular weight of approximately 95,000; peak activity of the ammonia-requiring enzyme activity corresponded to a molecular weight of 67,000. The lower molecular weight fraction could represent a separate enzyme activity, or it could be a subunit of glutamine phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase, which uses ammonia preferentially. Both enzyme activities required either Mg2+ or Mn2+ for catalytic activity, but optimal Mn2+ concentration for the ammonia-dependent activity was 0.25 mm. Concentrations above 0.25 mm inhibited ammonia-dependent catalytic activity, while optimal Mn2+ concentration for glutamine phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase was 2 mm. KCl (50 to 100 mm) inhibited phosphoribosyl-1-amine synthesis from ammonia and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate, but did not inhibit glutamine phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase. Glutamine phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase was more heat-labile (t½ = 4 min) than was the lower molecular weight polypeptide which used ammonia for synthesis. The catalytic activity of the enzyme fraction which catalyzes phosphoribosyl-1-amine from ammonia and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate was not inhibited by glutamine. The apparent Km values were 0.15 mm for phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate and 2 mm for ammonia. The Km values for glutamine phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase were 0.1 mm for phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate and 1 mm for glutamine. Both enzyme activities were sensitive to inhibition by adenosine 5'-monophosphate, guanosine 5'-monophosphate, and allopurinol ribonucleotide. The effect of ammonia on the early steps of de novo purine biosynthesis was investigated in the intact human lymphoblast maintained in tissue culture. Addition of 10 mm NH4Cl (at pH 7.5) stimulated the rate of purine biosynthesis in the intact cell of 168%, while the addition of adenine or hypoxanthine to the incubation medium inhibited the rate of the early steps of purine biosynthesis. Ammonia stimulation of α-N-formylglycinamide ribonucleotide synthesis was not mediated by an increase in cellular glutamine. Preincubation of cells with 1 mm 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine for 30 min inhibited glutamine-dependent α-N-formylglycinamide ribonucleotide synthesis by 80%, but reduced ammonia-dependent α-N-formylglycinamide ribonucleotide synthesis by only 20% (unpublished observations). These cells had no detectable glutamine synthetase activity, nor was glutamine synthesis detected following the addition of ammonia to the incubation medium (unpublished observations). The addition of 0.5 µm adenine inhibited glutaminedependent α-N-formylglycinamide ribonucleotide synthesis by 44%, while the addition of 2 µm hypoxanthine inhibited this synthesis by 42%. Ammonia-dependent α-N-formylglycinamide ribonucleotide synthesis was inhibited by 33% by 0.5 µm adenine and by 47% by 2 µm hypoxanthine. These observations indicate that ammonia-dependent phosphoribosyl-1-amine may contribute significantly to the regulation of the rate of de novo purine biosynthesis in human tissues. The regulation of purine biosynthesis is of particular interest in gout and in malignant diseases."

Experimental evidence presented indicate that this phenomenon is attributable to formation of [γ-32P]ATP or [β,γ-32P]-ATP from [γ-32P]GTP through isotope exchange and transfer reactions, probably as the result of a combined action of nucleoside triphosphate phosphotransferases, nucleoside triphosphatases, nucleoside diphosphate kinases, nucleoside monophosphate kinases, and other related enzymes.

Isoproterenol administration increased uridine, deoxycytidine, and thymidine kinase activities 2-, 10-, and 30-fold, the enzymes reaching maximum activity at 12 to 14, 27, and 30 hours after isoproterenol injection, respectively. DNA synthesis was maximal at 27 hours. In control glands 25% of the deoxycytidine and thymidine kinase activities was present in a nuclear fraction and 40% of the uridine kinase activity in the microsomal fraction. Most of the remainder of their activities was present in the high speed supernatant fraction. After isoproterenol injection the activities of these enzymes in the nuclear, mitochondrial, and microsomal fractions changed only slightly, while 97% of the increased activities was present in the cytosol fraction. Sedimentation of crude homogenates on sucrose gradients showed that the nuclear and cytoplasmic forms of the deoxyribonucleoside kinases had the same molecular weights, being 65,000 for deoxycytidine kinase and 70,000 for thymidine kinase.

https://openalex.org/W1529460420,"Abstract The synthesis and isolation in purified form of [Hcy6,11-A]insulin, a biologically active analog of sheep insulin, is described. This analog differs from the parent molecule in that the cysteine residues located at positions 6 and 11 in the A chain and participating in the formation of the intrachain cyclic system have been replaced by homocysteine residues. For the synthesis of this compound, the Hcy6,11-A chain of sheep insulin was chemically synthesized by the fragment condensation method and isolated as the S-sulfonated derivative. Conversion of the latter compound to the sulfhydryl form on exposure to 2-mercaptoethanol and combination of the reduced product with the S-sulfonated B chain of sheep insulin afforded [Hcy6,11-A]insulin. Purification of the insulin analog was accomplished by chromatography on a carboxymethylcellulose column with an exponential sodium chloride gradient. This analog, which possesses a 22-membered cyclic system in contrast to insulin which contains a 20-membered ring, had a potency of 7 to 8 i.u. per mg, as compared to 25 i.u. per mg possessed by the natural hormone when assayed by the mouse convulsion method or by the radioimmunoassay method. The implication therefore arises that the enlargement of the intrachain cyclic system by two methylene groups does not abolish the topochemical features responsible for the expression of the biological profile of insulin."
