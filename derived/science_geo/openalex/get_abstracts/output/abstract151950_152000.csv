https://openalex.org/W1992950258,"Synthesis and maturation of G protein-coupled receptors are complex events that require an intricate combination of processes that include protein folding, post-translational modifications, and transport through distinct cellular compartments. Relatively little is known about the nature and kinetics of specific steps involved in these processes. Here, the human δ opioid receptor expressed in human embryonic kidney 293S cells is used as a model to delineate these steps and to establish the kinetics of receptor synthesis, glycosylation, and transport. We found that the receptor is synthesized as a core-glycosylatedM r 45,000 precursor that is converted to the fully mature M r 55,000 receptor with a half-time of about 120 min. In addition to trimming and processing of two N-linked oligosaccharides, maturation involves addition of O-glycans containing N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose, and sialic acid. In contrast to N-glycosylation, which is initiated co-translationally and is completed when the protein reaches the trans-Golgi network, O-glycosylation was found to occur only after the receptor exits from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and was terminated as early as thetrans-Golgi cisternae. Once the carbohydrates are fully processed and the receptor reaches the trans-Golgi network, it is transported to the cell surface in about 10 min. The exit from the ER was found to be the limiting step in overall processing of the receptor. This indicates that early events in the folding of the receptor are probably rate-limiting and that receptor folding intermediates are retained in the ER until they can adopt the correct conformation. The overall low efficiency of receptor maturation, less than 50% of the precursor being processed to the fully glycosylated protein, further suggests that only a fraction of the synthesized receptors attain properly folded conformation that allows exit from the ER. This indicates that folding and ER export are key events in control of receptor cell surface expression. Whether or not the low efficiency of the ER export is a general feature among G protein-coupled receptors remains to be investigated.

A variety of chemical messengers, such as neurotransmitters and hormones, act on these receptors, and they also serve as sensory molecules in the olfactory and visual systems. Although overall they do not share extensive sequence identity, they are believed to have a similar three-dimensional structure that is characterized by seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains connected by alternating intracellular and extracellular loops (1.Dohlman H.G.

The N terminus is extracellular, whereas the C terminus lies within the cytosol. Several post-translational modifications, most notably glycosylation, phosphorylation, and palmitoylation, also have an impact on the structure and function of these important membrane proteins. The GPCRs are expressed at very low levels in natural tissues and cells, and thus progress in biochemical characterization of these proteins has been greatly facilitated by the use of heterologous expression systems. Over the last few years, this approach has been used to address a number of fundamental questions related to both structural and functional features of these proteins. In some cases, however, expression of wild type (6.McClintock T.S. Landers T.M. Gimelbrant A.A. Fuller L.Z. Jackson B.A. Jayawickreme C.K. Lerner M.R. Mol.

Similarly, a number of inherited disorders have been traced to mutations within the GPCRs that result in proteins with reduced cell surface expression (12.Sung C.-H. Schneider B.G. Agarwal N.

In many cases this was proposed to be due to misfolding and/or deficient targeting of the protein. Recently, a few GPCRs, such as olfactory receptors (17.Dwyer N.D. Troemel E.R. Sengupta P. Bargmann C.I. Cell. 1998; 93: 455-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), visual opsins (18.Colley N.J. Baker E.K. Stamnes M.A. Zuker C.S.

Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1817) Google Scholar), were shown to need special chaperone/escort proteins to be expressed at the cell surface. In the case of the γ-aminobutyric acid type B-1 receptor, heterodimerization with another GPCR, the γ-aminobutyric acid type B-2 receptor, was shown to be required (22.White J.H. Wise A. Main M.J.

In general, however, very little is known about how the GPCRs assume their correct conformation and acquire their covalent modifications and are trafficked from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the plasma membrane. In an attempt to delineate the basic steps involved in the biosynthesis, maturation, post-translational modifications and targeting of these proteins, the human δ opioid receptor (hδOR) was used as an experimental model. This receptor, along with the other opioid receptors, μ and κ, mediates the actions of endogenous opioid peptides as well as opiate alkaloids in the nervous system (23.Dhawan B.N. Cesselin F. Raghubir R. Reisine T. Bradley P.B. Portoghese P.S. Hamon M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1996; 48: 567-592PubMed Google Scholar,24.Quock R.M. Burkey T.H. Varga E. Hosohata Y. Hosohata K. Cowell S.M. Slate C.A. Ehlert F.J. Roeske W.R. Yamamura H.I. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 503-532PubMed Google Scholar). The deduced primary structure of the hδOR predicts a protein of 372 amino acids with two consensus N-glycosylation sites in its N-terminal extracellular domain and a calculated weight of approximately 40,000 (25.Knapp R.J. Malatynska E. Fang L. Li X. Babin E. Nguyen M. Santoro G. Varga E.V. Hruby V.J. Roeske W.R. Yamamura H.I. Life Sci. 1994; 54: PL463-PL469Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 26.Simonin F. Befort K. Gavériaux-Ruff C. Matthes H. Nappey V. Lannes B. Micheletti G. Kieffer B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1015-1021PubMed Google Scholar). To date no study has directly investigated the steps leading from the newly synthesized polypeptide to the mature receptor at the plasma membrane. Here, using a heterologous expression system, we studied the rates of biosynthesis, maturation, and metabolic turnover of the hδOR in discrete cellular compartments in relation with the glycosylation events that occur during the transit of the protein from the ER to the cell surface. We found that protein export from the ER represents the rate-limiting step in the processing of the newly synthesized receptor. EXPRE35S35S protein labeling mix (1175 Ci/mmol), [9-3H(N)]bremazocine (26.6 Ci/mmol), [2,8-3H]adenine (31.7 Ci/mmol), andd-[6-3H(N)]glucosamine (22.7 Ci/mmol) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Endo H) ofStreptomyces plicatus, recombinant from. Escherichia coli (EC 3.2.1.96), peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) of Flavobacterium meningosepticum, recombinant from E. coli (EC 3.5.1.52), and O-glycosidase fromDiplococcus pneumoniae (EC 3.2.1.97) were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Neuraminidase from Vibrio cholerae (EC 3.2.1.18), monensin, and brefeldin A (BFA) were from Calbiochem. Cell culture reagents were either from Life Technologies, Inc. or Wisent. Tunicamycin, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-agarose, anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody, anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin, and FLAG peptide were products of Sigma. EZ-linkedTMsulfo-N-Hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-biotin and Immunopure® immobilized streptavidin were from Pierce and the opioid agonists and antagonists from RBI, except SNC-80, which was purchased from Tocris. All the other reagents were of analytical grade and obtained from various commercial suppliers. The hδOR cDNA was subcloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen) as described (27.Valiquette M. Vu H.K. Yue S.Y. Wahlestedt C. Walker P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18789-18796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The receptor was tagged at the C-terminal end with the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) using theCLONTECH site-directed mutagenesis kit that is based on the method of Deng and Nickoloff (28.Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). The construction was verified and confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequencing. Human embryonic kidney 293S (HEK-293S) cells were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Earl's medium (DMEM) containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 1000 units of penicillin/ml, 1 mg streptomycin/ml, and 1.5 μg of fungizone/ml (complete DMEM) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were transfected by a modified calcium-phosphate precipitation method (29.Chen C Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar), and clones of stably transfected cells were selected using 400 μg/ml of G-418 (Calbiochem). Saturation binding of [3H]bremazocine (see below) was used to estimate the level of receptor expression. Cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 80–90% confluency, quick frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. After thawing, the cell pellets were suspended in buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI), and 10 μg/ml benzamidine) and homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer (Ultra-Turrax T-25, Janke and Kunkel) using three bursts of 5 s at maximum setting. Homogenates were centrifuged at 700 × g for 5 min, and the pellets were rehomogenized and recentrifuged. The combined supernatants were further centrifuged at 27,000 × gfor 20 min, and the pellets were washed twice with buffer A. The pellets containing the crude membrane fractions were resuspended in buffer A at a concentration of 1–5 mg/ml and either used immediately or quick frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Protein was assayed by using Bio-Rad's DC assay kit with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. Saturation and competition binding assays for the wild type and the FLAG-tagged hδOR were carried out using 5 μg of membrane protein in a final volume of 300 μl of buffer A supplemented with 0.1% BSA (w/v). For saturation experiments, triplicates contained 0.2–20 nm [3H]bremazocine. For competition experiments, triplicates contained 1 nm[3H]bremazocine and either SNC-80, Leu-enkephalin, or naloxone at final concentrations ranging from 0.1 pm to 100 μm. Nonspecific binding was determined using 10 μm naltrexone. After incubation at 25 °C for 60 min, the membranes were harvested by rapid filtration over Whatman GF/C filters presoaked for 60 min in 0.1% polyethyleneimine (v/v)/0.1% BSA (w/v) and washed three times with cold 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The radioactivity on the filters was determined after an overnight incubation in UniverSol™ scintillation fluid (ICN). Curve fitting and analysis of the binding data were performed using the GraphPad Prism program version 2.01. Intracellular cAMP levels were determined by measuring the conversion of [3H]ATP to [3H]cAMP following metabolic labeling with the [3H]adenine, as described (30.Dumuis A. Bouhelal R. Sebben M. Cory R. Bockaert J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 880-887PubMed Google Scholar). Stably transfected HEK-293S cells were subcultured into 6-well culture plates at a density of 100,000 cells/well and allowed to recover for 48 h before the experiments. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h in complete DMEM containing 2 μCi/ml of [3H]adenine, washed twice with PBS, and incubated further for 15 min in medium supplemented with 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 100 μm forskolin, and SNC-80 at a final concentration of 1 fM to 1 μm. The reaction was stopped by aspirating the medium and adding 1 ml of ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid (w/v). After adding 100 μl of 5 mm ATP/5 mm cAMP, cells were lifted by a rubber policeman, and cellular proteins were removed by centrifugation (700 × g, 10 min). [3H]ATP and [3H]cAMP were measured in the supernatant following separation by sequential chromatography on Dowex and alumina columns, as described (31.Salomon J. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3367) Google Scholar). Analysis of the data was performed using the GraphPad Prism program, version 2.01. Total cellular membranes prepared as described above were extracted (1 mg of membrane protein/ml) with buffer B (0.5%n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM) (w/v), 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 140 mm NaCl, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml STI, 10 g/ml benzamidine, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 2 mm 1,10-phenantroline) by mixing the suspension on a magnetic stirrer for 60 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min, the solubilized receptor was purified batchwise from the supernatant fraction by affinity chromatography on immobilized WGA. The resin (100 μl/mg of membrane protein) was incubated with the supernatant overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation, pelleted, and washed five times with 1 ml of buffer C (buffer B containing 0.1% instead of 0.5% DDM (w/v)). The bound proteins were eluted by incubating the resin for 30 min at 4 °C under gentle agitation with 300 μl of buffer C containing 0.3m N-acetylglucosamine. This was repeated three times, and the eluates were combined. For sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), aliquots of the solubilized material, unbound fraction, and the eluate were diluted 2-fold with SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.001% (w/v) bromphenol blue). Cells were subcultured in either 25 cm2 or 75 cm2 culture flasks and grown to 80–90% confluency. For [35S]methionine/cysteine labeling, the cells were first preincubated in methionine and cysteine-free DMEM for 60 min at 37 °C, and the labeling was performed in fresh medium containing 150 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine/cysteine. After an incubation of 60 min at 37 °C, the pulse was terminated by washing the cells twice with the chase medium (complete DMEM supplemented with 5 mm methionine) and chased for different periods of time as specified in the figures and the text. When labeling was performed in the presence of monensin, BFA, or tunicamycin, the reagents were added either 1 h (BFA and monensin) or 3 h (tunicamycin) before the pulse labeling at a final concentration of 10 μm(monensin) or 5 μg/ml (BFA and tunicamycin). For [3H]glucosamine labeling, the cells were preincubated for 2 h in complete DMEM containing 1 g of glucose/liter and labeled for 6 h in the same medium containing 70 μCi/ml of [3H]glucosamine. After the metabolic labeling, the cells were washed with and harvested in PBS, quick frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. After thawing, the cells were sonicated with a tip sonicator twice for 15 s in buffer D (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml STI, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 2 mm 1,10-phenantroline). Total cellular membranes were recovered by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 20 min, washed twice with buffer D, and extracted with buffer E (0.5% DDM (w/v), 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 140 mm NaCl, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml STI, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 2 mm 1,10-phenantroline). After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min, the receptor was immunoprecipitated from the supernatant fraction by using anti-FLAG M2 antibody resin. The polyclonal antibody used for Western blotting (see below) that recognizes the native C-terminal end of the receptor was not suitable for immunoprecipitation. 20 μl of antibody-coupled resin equilibrated in buffer E supplemented with 0.1% BSA (w/v) was used to purify the receptor from one 25-cm2 flask. The resin was incubated with the supernatant overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation, pelleted, and washed twice with 500 μl of buffer E and four times with 500 μl of buffer F (buffer E containing 0.1% instead of 0.5% DDM (w/v)). The receptor was eluted by incubating the resin for 10 min at 4 °C with 100 μl of buffer F containing 175 μg of FLAG peptide/ml. This was repeated three times, and the eluates were combined. For SDS-PAGE, 100 μl of the combined eluates was concentrated down to 25 μl by membrane filtration over Microcon-30 concentrators (Millipore), and 25 μl of SDS sample buffer was added. For cell surface biotinylation, cells were washed three times with warm Dulbecco's PBS, cooled on ice, and incubated with gentle agitation at 4 °C for 30 min in Dulbecco's PBS containing 0.5 mg/ml of sulfo-NHS-biotin. Excess biotin was quenched by adding Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, to a final concentration of 50 mm and incubating the cells further for 10 min at 4 °C. The cells were then washed twice with cold Dulbecco's PBS and harvested. Biotinylated cell surface proteins were isolated using immobilized streptavidin after solubilizing the total cellular membranes as described above. 25 μl of resin was used for 1 mg of solubilized membrane proteins. The resin was incubated with the 100,000 ×g supernatant containing 0.1% BSA (w/v) for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation, pelleted and washed five times with 500 μl of buffer E. The biotinylated proteins were eluted with 100 μl of SDS sample buffer containing 50 mm dithiothreitol by incubating the resin first for 15 min at 25 °C and then for 5 min at 95 °C. When cell surface proteins were isolated from metabolically labeled cells, the elution was carried out using 100 μl of 1% SDS (w/v), 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, which was diluted with 900 μl of buffer E prior to purifying the receptor by immunoprecipitation. Thawed total cellular membranes were washed with either buffer G (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.5, 50 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, 2 mm 1,10-phenantroline, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml STI, 10 μg/ml benzamidine; Endo H) or buffer H (50 mm Na-phosphate, pH 7.5, 50 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, 2 mm 1,10-phenantroline, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml STI, and 10 μg/ml benzamidine; PNGase F). After pelleting the membranes at 27,000 × g for 20 min, they were extracted in the appropriate buffers containing 0.5% DDM (w/v) at 1 mg of membrane protein/ml on a magnetic stirrer for 60 min at 4 °C. Solubilized receptors were recovered in the supernatant of a 100,000 × g centrifugation for 60 min at 4 °C, and the enzymes were added at final concentrations of 100 milliunits/ml (Endo H) and 0.001–20 milliunits/ml (PNGase F). Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h, and the reaction was terminated by adding SDS sample buffer. The metabolically labeled purified receptor was deglycosylated in a similar manner following elution from the anti-FLAG M2 antibody resin with 1% (w/v) SDS, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. The enzymes were added at final concentrations of 25 milliunits/ml (Endo H), 20 units/ml (PNGase F) and 50 milliunits/ml (neuraminidase andO-glycosidase). Before the enzyme reaction, the eluates were diluted 10-fold with 0.5% (w/v) DDM in buffer G containing 1% 2-mercaptoethanol (Endo H), buffer H containing 1% 2-mercaptoethanol (PNGase F), or 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 0.5 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml STI, and 10 μg/ml benzamidine (neuraminidase and O-glycosidase). SDS-PAGE was performed as described (32.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar), using 4% stacking gels and 10% separating gels. Samples were heated at 95 °C for 2 min in the presence of 50 mm dithiothreitol and run on a Bio-Rad Mini-Protein II apparatus. Molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad) detected by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Bio-Rad) were used to calibrate the gels. For the detection of radioactivity, the gels were treated with En3hance® (NEN Life Science Products) according to the manufacturer's instructions, dried, and exposed at −80 °C for 1–15 days, using Biomax MR film and intensifying screens (Kodak). The relative intensities of the labeled bands on the autoradiograms were analyzed by densitometric scanning with an Agfa Arcus II laser scanner, and the data were quantified using the NIH image program, version 1.61, subtracting a local background from each lane. For Western blotting, the proteins resolved in SDS-PAGE were transferred electrophoretically from the gels onto nitrocellulose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (50 mA, 16 h, Bio-Rad Mini-Trans Blot apparatus). The nitrocellulose-bound proteins were probed with either a polyclonal receptor antiserum directed against a peptide (SDGPGGGRAA) corresponding to the 10 amino acids at the native C-terminal end of the receptor (a generous gift from Dr. Robert Elde, University of Minnesota) or a monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) recognizing the FLAG epitope tag at the C terminus of the receptor, according to the protocol described by the manufacturer of the latter antibody. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagents from NEN Life Science Products were used to reveal the blotted proteins. The electroblotted molecular weight markers were detected by staining with Ponceau S (Sigma). The FLAG epitope was introduced to the C-terminal end of the hδOR coding sequence to facilitate immunological detection and purification of the receptor protein. An antiserum recognizing the last 10 amino acids of the native receptor was used for Western blotting (see below), but it did not allow efficient immunopurification of the receptor. Plasmids encoding either the wild type or the tagged hδOR were stably transfected into HEK-293S cells. Characterization of the pharmacological properties of the two constructs revealed that the addition of the epitope did not significantly affect ligand binding or G protein coupling (Table I). TheK d for the agonist [3H]bremazocine, the K i for all the ligands tested in binding competition assays as well as the potency of SNC-80 to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation were found to be identical for the FLAG epitope-modified hδOR and the wild type receptor and in close agreement with the values reported previously (23.Dhawan B.N.

https://openalex.org/W2081971657,"The recent identification of two new thrombin receptors, PAR3 and PAR4, led us to re-examine the basis for endothelial cell responses to thrombin. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) are known to express PAR1 and the trypsin/tryptase receptor, PAR2. Northern blots detected both of those receptors and, to a lesser extent, PAR3, but PAR4 message was undetectable and there was no response to PAR4 agonist peptides. To determine whether PAR3 or any other receptor contributes to thrombin signaling in HUVEC, PAR1 cleavage was blocked with two selective antibodies and PAR1 activation was inhibited with the antagonist, BMS200261. The antibodies completely inhibited HUVEC responses to thrombin, but BMS200261 was only partly effective, even though separate studies established that the antagonist completely inhibits PAR1 signaling at the concentrations used. Since peptides mimicking the PAR1 tethered ligand domain can also activate PAR2, we asked whether the remaining thrombin response in the presence of the antagonist could be due in part to the intermolecular transactivation of PAR2 by cleaved PAR1. Evidence that transactivation can occur was obtained in COS-7 cells co-expressing PAR2 and a variant of PAR1 that can be cleaved, but not signal. There was a substantial response to thrombin only in cells expressing both receptors. Conversely, in HUVEC, complete blockade of the thrombin response by the PAR1 antagonist occurred only when signaling through PAR2 was also blocked. From these observations we conclude that 1) PAR1 is the predominant thrombin receptor expressed in HUVEC and cleavage of PAR1 is required for endothelial cell responses to thrombin; 2) although PAR3 may be expressed, there is still no evidence that it mediates thrombin responses; 3) PAR4 is not expressed on HUVEC; and 4) transactivation of PAR2 by cleaved PAR1 can contribute to endothelial cell responses to thrombin, particularly when signaling through PAR1 is blocked. Such transactivation may limit the effectiveness of PAR1 antagonists, which compete with the tethered ligand domain rather than preventing PAR1 cleavage.

Thrombin activates receptors that stimulate phospholipases A2, C, and D and causes an increase in cytosolic Ca2+. This leads to cell proliferation and the release of a wide range of vasoactive substances (2.Shankar R. de la Motte C.A. DiCorleto P.E. Am. J.

The only signaling receptors that have been unequivocally identified for thrombin to date are members of the protease-activated receptor family, a group of G protein-coupled receptors that are activated by proteolytic cleavage at a unique site within each receptor's NH2 terminus. Receptor cleavage exposes a new NH2 terminus that serves as a tethered ligand by binding to sites within the body of the receptor (reviewed in Ref.6.Dery O. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Three of the four currently identified PAR1 family members (PAR1, PAR3, and PAR4) have been shown to be cleaved and activated by thrombin. These receptors are closely related with different, but overlapping expression patterns in human tissues (7.Hollenberg M.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 271-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The fourth PAR family member, PAR2, is known to be expressed on human endothelial cells. PAR2 is cleaved and activated by trypsin and tryptase, but not by thrombin (8.Nystedt S. Emilsson K. Wahlestedt C. Sundelin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9208-9212Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). It is not yet clear, however, which (if either) of these proteases is the physiological activator of PAR2 in endothelial cells. Stimulation of PAR1 or PAR2 evokes a range of responses in endothelial cells, most of which are common to both receptors (6.Dery O. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition to proteolytic activation, three of the PARs can also be activated by synthetic peptides corresponding to their tethered ligand. PAR3, for which no peptide agonist has been reported, is the sole exception.Prior to the identification of PAR3 (9.Ishihara H. Connolly A.J. Zeng D. Kahn M.L. Zheng Y.W. Timmons C. Tram T.

However, the results of those studies leave open the question of whether thrombin responses in endothelial cells are mediated solely by PAR1. Although peptide agonists of PAR1 can clearly produce thrombin-like effects, at least two reports have shown that PAR1 antibodies are only partially effective in blocking thrombin responses (18.Bahou W.F. Coller B.S. Potter C.L. Norton K.J. Kutok J.L. Goligorsky M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 19.Seiler S.M. Peluso M. Tuttle J.G. Pryor K. Klimas C. Matsueda G.R. Bernatowicz M.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 190-197PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, HUVEC have been shown to express mRNA encoding PAR3 and to bind a polyclonal PAR3 antibody (20.Schmidt V.A. Nierman W.C. Maglott D.R. Cupit L.D. Moskowitz K.A. Wainer J.A. Bahou W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15061-15068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The existence of PAR4 in endothelial cells has not been reported.Therefore, in the present studies, we have revisited the basis for endothelial cell responses to thrombin. Using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) as a model, we have asked the following questions. First, which of the known members of the PAR family are expressed in these cells and what are their respective contributions to the events that occur when endothelial cells are activated by thrombin? Second, are thrombin responses in endothelial cells mediated in part by additional receptors that have not yet been discovered? These could be unidentified PAR family members or unrelated receptors with different mechanisms of activation. Finally, we also asked whether endothelial cell PAR2, which is not a substrate for thrombin, might indirectly contribute to signaling in response to thrombin by a novel mechanism involving cleaved PAR1. The results that will be described show that PAR1 cleavage is required for endothelial cell responses to thrombin and that subsequent signaling can be mediated by either the direct activation of PAR1 (the predominant mechanism) or by the indirect “transactivation” of PAR2. Thrombin receptors other than PAR1 are either not expressed on endothelial cells or not able to support a thrombin response on their own, but to the extent that transactivation of PAR2 by PAR1 contributes to the thrombin response, it will limit the effectiveness of PAR1 antagonists that compete with the tethered ligand domain rather than preventing PAR1 cleavage.RESULTSPrevious reports show that human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) express PAR1 and PAR2 (15.Nelken N.A.

Wainer J.A. Bahou W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15061-15068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) suggests that human endothelial cells also express PAR3 but, in the absence of a selective agonist or antagonist, the ability of the receptor to signal in HUVEC could not be tested directly. In the studies shown in Fig.1, mRNA from early passage HUVEC was probed for PAR3 using PAR1 and PAR2 as positive controls. As reported (20.Schmidt V.A. Nierman W.C. Maglott D.R. Cupit L.D.

Chem. 1998; 273: 15061-15068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), PAR3 mRNA was detectable, but with less intensity than PAR1 or PAR2. Evidence for PAR4 expression in HUVEC was sought by reverse transcription-PCR and by stimulating the cells with a PAR4 peptide agonist. Using primers based upon the PAR4 NH2 terminus (see “Experimental Procedures”) and PAR1 as a positive control, we were able to detect PAR4 in the megakaryoblastic Dami cell line, but not in HUVEC (data not shown). Furthermore, the PAR4 peptide agonist, GYPGQV, failed to produce an increase in cytosolic Ca2+when added to HUVEC loaded with Fura-2 (Fig.2). The same peptide agonist caused platelet aggregation (Ref. 10.Xu W.-F. Andersen H. Whitmore T.E. Presnell S.R. Yee D.P. Ching A.C. Gilbert T. Davie E.W. Foster D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Results are representative of those obtained in three such experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These results suggest that PAR3 may be present in HUVEC, but PAR4 is not. In order to distinguish the contributions of PAR1 from those of PAR3 (or any other as yet unidentified thrombin receptor), we used two previously developed monoclonal antibodies to block PAR1 cleavage by thrombin. Antibody ATAP2 binds to an epitope within the PAR1 tethered ligand domain (23.Brass L.F. Pizarro S. Ahuja M. Belmonte E. Stadel J. Hoxie J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2943-2952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody WEDE15 binds to the hirudin-like domain that interacts with thrombin's anion-binding exosite (22.Hoxie J.A. Ahuja M. Belmonte E. Pizarro S. Parton R.G. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13756-13763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage of PAR1 was detected with a third monoclonal antibody, PC143, which binds to residues within the NH2-terminal fragment of PAR1 that is released by thrombin (24.Ramachandran R. Klufas A.S. Molino M. Ahuja M. Hoxie J.A. Brass L.F. Thromb. Haemost. 1997; 78: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the studies shown in Fig.3, COS-7 cells transiently transfected with human PAR1 were exposed to thrombin in the presence of either ATAP2 and WEDE15 or an equivalent amount of an isotype-matched control antibody, EH1. Approximately 30% of the cells expressed the transfected receptor. In the histograms shown in Fig. 3 (Aand B), the transfected cells bound more biotinylated PC143, and appear as a shoulder to the right of the weakly fluorescent, mock-transfected cells (dotted line). Thrombin caused a complete loss of PC143 binding and the disappearance of the shoulder in the cells preincubated with the control antibody, EH1 (Fig.3 A), but cleavage was completely inhibited by the ATAP2/WEDE15 antibody mixture (Fig. 3 B).Figure 3Selected monoclonal antibodies can specifically inhibit thrombin cleavage of PAR1. A andB, COS-7 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry 36–48 h after transfection with human PAR1 or empty vector. The cells were preincubated with either the control antibody EH1 (A) or the anti-PAR1 monoclonal antibodies ATAP2 and WEDE15 (B), and stimulated with thrombin. Receptor cleavage was detected as a loss in binding for biotinylated antibody PC143, a cleavage-sensitive PAR1 monoclonal antibody, as described under “Experimental Procedures.”C, COS-7 cells were transfected with chimeras containing the NH2 terminus of PAR1, PAR3, or PAR4 fused to CXCR4 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Surface expression of each chimera was confirmed using the monoclonal antibody 12G5 directed against CXCR4 (data not shown). The results are expressed as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the population of cells for each transfection, and show the binding of antibody ATAP2 and WEDE15 to cells expressing P1NT-CXCR4, but not the other chimeras. The results shown are representative of two separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Based upon the sequence of the peptides that were originally used to prepare them, antibodies ATAP2 and WEDE15 would not be expected to bind to human PAR3 or PAR4. To confirm this specificity, COS-7 cells were transfected with chimeric constructs consisting of the NH2terminus of either PAR1, PAR3, or PAR4 fused to the G protein-coupled chemokine receptor, CXCR4 (25.Endres M.J. Clapham P.R. Marsh M. Ahuja M. Turner J.D. McKnight A. Thomas J.F. Stoebenau-Haggarty B. Choe S. Vance P.J. Wells T.N.C. Power C.A. Sutterwala S.S. Doms R.W. Landau N.R. Hoxie J.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 745-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with each of these constructs were recognized by anti-CXCR4 antibody 12G5 (data not shown). Fig. 3 C shows that in cells expressing individual chimeras, WEDE15 and ATAP2 bind to cells expressing the PAR1-CXCR4 chimera, but not to cells expressing the PAR3- or PAR4-CXCR4 chimeras.PAR1 Cleavage Is Required for Thrombin Responses in HUVECSince antibodies ATAP2 and WEDE15 inhibit PAR1 cleavage by thrombin, but do not bind to PAR3 or PAR4, we used them to determine whether PAR1 cleavage is required for HUVEC to respond to thrombin. In the study shown in Fig. 4, changes in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in HUVEC were measured in response to thrombin and the PAR2 agonist peptide, SLIGRL. In the presence of isotype-matched control, thrombin produced a robust increase in cytosolic Ca2+, but in the presence of the PAR1-blocking antibodies there was no response, even at 50 nm thrombin. The response to SLIGRL was the same in either case. Blockade of PAR1 cleavage also inhibited thrombin-induced phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase, ERK2 (data not shown), which lies downstream of a number of different effector pathways in HUVEC (35.May M.J. Wheeler-Jones C.P.D. Houliston R.A. Pearson J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C789-C798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Busse R. Circ.

Fura-2-loaded HUVEC were pretreated with the control antibody EH1 (50 μg/ml) or the anti-PAR1 antibodies ATAP2 and WEDE15 (25 μg/ml of each), then stimulated with thrombin as indicated. Cell responsiveness was confirmed using the SLIGRL peptide as indicated. Results are representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These results suggest that the rapid thrombin-induced calcium response in HUVEC requires PAR1 cleavage and that PAR3 (despite the Northern analysis) is either not present or not able to signal on its own in any of the assays that were performed. The same conclusion might apply to any other, as yet unidentified, thrombin receptors on HUVEC. Since there is evidence (20.Schmidt V.A. Nierman W.C. Maglott D.R. Cupit L.D. Moskowitz K.A. Wainer J.A. Bahou W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15061-15068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) that PAR3 is expressed on HUVEC, we considered the possibility that PAR3 is present, but is cleaved by thrombin at too slow a rate to stimulate mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation or to contribute to the rapid increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate needed to stimulate the release of stored calcium (38.Ishii K. Hein L. Kobilka B. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9780-9786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6148) Google Scholar). This possibility was tested by analyzing thrombin-induced inositol phosphate accumulation in the presence of control or PAR1-blocking antibodies while inhibiting inositol phosphatase activity with Li+. The results in Fig.5 show that thrombin-induced inositol accumulation in HUVEC was reduced by 93% in the presence of the PAR1 blocking antibodies, making a substantial contribution from PAR3 seem unlikely.Figure 5PAR1 blocking antibodies inhibit thrombin-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis in HUVEC. Adherent cells were loaded with [3H]inositol and pretreated with control or PAR1 blocking antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were treated with thrombin for 45 min as indicated. The results shown are mean ± S.E. of three studies expressed as the -fold increase in total [3H]inositol phosphate formation compared with the results obtained in each experiment in which control antibody-treated cells were stimulated with buffer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Transactivation of PAR2 by PAR1Since PAR1 cleavage is necessary for HUVEC thrombin responses, we sought to determine if it is sufficient to account for the myriad responses induced by thrombin in these cells. In other words, could some part of the HUVEC thrombin response result from the activation of another receptor by a mechanism that depends upon PAR1 cleavage? One likely candidate for such a role is PAR2, which is also expressed on endothelial cells. Although PAR2 has been shown to be activated by trypsin (8.Nystedt S. Emilsson K. Wahlestedt C. Sundelin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9208-9212Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar) and, less efficiently, tryptase (40.Molino M. Barnathan E.S. Numerof R. Clark J. Dreyer M. Cumashi A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 4043-4049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), it remains to be shown that either of these proteases is the primary activator of PAR2 on endothelial cells (6.Dery O. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We asked whether PAR2 could contribute to the thrombin response in human endothelial cells without being a direct substrate for thrombin. It has been shown previously that non-signaling (but cleavable) variants of PAR1 can “transactivate” PAR1 variants that can signal, but not be cleaved (41.Chen J. Ishii M. Wang L. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16041-16045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transactivation in that case was thought to involve the intermolecular donation of the tethered ligand domain of the cleavable receptor, allowing it to activate non-cleavable receptors. PAR2 is not a thrombin substrate and cannot be directly activated by thrombin (Ref.8.Nystedt S. Emilsson K. Wahlestedt C. Sundelin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9208-9212Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar and Fig. 6). However, peptides corresponding to the tethered ligand domain of human PAR1 (SFLLRN) are known to be able to activate PAR2 (42.Blackhart B.D. Emilsson K. Nguyen D. Teng W. Martelli A.J. Nystedt S.

Invest. 1996; 97: 1705-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) have shown that the response of HUVEC to thrombin is reduced when PAR2 is activated first with a selective agonist peptide. Although the latter observation was attributed to heterologous desensitization of PAR1 by downstream mediators of the PAR2 response, an additional hypothesis is that part of the thrombin signal is mediated by the transactivation of PAR2 by thrombin-cleaved PAR1.Figure 6PAR1 transactivation of PAR2 in transfected COS-7 cells. COS-7 cells were transfected with empty vector (mock) or the indicated plasmids, loaded with [3H]inositol, and stimulated with thrombin (20 nm) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results shown are mean ± S.E. of three studies expressed as -fold increase in total [3H]inositol phosphate formation compared with the results obtained in each experiment with vector-transfected cells stimulated with buffer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As a first test of this hypothesis, we asked whether a non-signaling, but cleavable variant of human PAR1 would transactivate wild type human PAR2 in transfected COS-7 cells. PAR1(L258P) contains a Leu to Pro substitution in the second extracellular loop of the receptor near a domain needed for receptor activation. The data in Fig. 6 show that neither PAR1(L258P) nor intact PAR2 signals in response to thrombin when expressed alone in COS-7 cells. However, when the cells were transfected with both constructs, there was a 5-fold increase in [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation in response to thrombin: nearly half of that seen in cells expressing wild type PAR1 alone.This result suggests that cleaved PAR1 can donate its tethered ligand to PAR2 and transactivate PAR2, at least under conditions in which direct signaling through PAR1 cannot occur because of a mutation in a putative tethered ligand domain binding site. An alternative explanation for the rescue of thrombin responses in this experiment is that PAR2 can physically interact with PAR1(L258P) and complement the mutation to restore PAR1 signaling. However, although such interactions have been described for other G protein-coupled receptors (44.Cvejic S. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26959-26964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 45.Jordan B.A. Devi L.A.

Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16041-16045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that transactivation of non-cleavable PAR1 by PAR1 can occur when the ligand donor is the NH2 terminus of PAR1 fused to the single transmembrane domain of CD8.Since there are no known antagonists of PAR2 and since the antibodies that block PAR1 activation do so by blocking PAR1 cleavage, we used a different approach to ask whether transactivation of PAR2 by thrombin-cleaved PAR1 occurs on human endothelial cells at normal levels of expression of the native forms of the two receptors. Fig.7 shows the response of Fura-2-loaded HUVEC to thrombin in the presence and absence of the PAR1 antagonist, BMS200261. This compound is a peptidomimetic based on the PAR1 activating peptide that prevents PAR1 signaling by PAR1 agonist peptides (47.Seiler S.M. Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 1996; 22: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and is thus thought to work by inhibiting the binding of the tethered ligand domain to sites in the body of the receptor. BMS200261 has been reported to completely inhibit human platelet responses to SFLLRN and to concentrations of thrombin that activate PAR1 but not PAR4 (21.Bernatowicz M.S. Klimas C.E. Hartl K.S.

We found that BMS200261 also completely inhibits thrombin responses in the REH pre-B-cell line that expresses PAR1, but not other known PAR family members (see below).

https://openalex.org/W2018474491,"The stress protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is induced in endothelial cells exposed to nitric oxide (NO)-releasing agents, and this process is finely modulated by thiols (Foresti, R., Clark, J. E., Green, C. J., and Motterlini R. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 18411–18417). Here, we report that up-regulation of HO-1 in aortic endothelial cells by severe hypoxic conditions (pO2 ≤ 2 mm Hg) is preceded by increased inducible NO synthase and NO synthase activity. This effect is accompanied by oxidation of intracellular glutathione and formation of S-nitrosothiols. Incubation of cells with a selective inhibitor of inducible NO synthase (S-(2-aminoethyl)-isothiourea) or a NO scavenger ([2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide]) significantly attenuated the increase in heme oxygenase activity caused by reduced oxygen availability. A series of antioxidant agents did not prevent the elevation in heme oxygenase activity by hypoxia; however, the precursor of glutathione synthesis and thiol donor,N-acetylcysteine, completely abolished HO-1 induction. We also found that the hypoxia-mediated increase in endothelial heme oxygenase activity was potentiated by the presence ofS-nitrosoglutathione. These results indicate that intracellular interaction of thiols with NO is an important determinant in the mechanism leading to HO-1 induction by reduced oxygen levels. We suggest that in addition to oxidative stress, HO-1 gene expression can be regulated by redox reactions involving NO andS-nitrosothiols (nitrosative stress), emphasizing a versatile role for the heme oxygenase pathway in the cellular adaptation to a variety of stressful conditions. The stress protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is induced in endothelial cells exposed to nitric oxide (NO)-releasing agents, and this process is finely modulated by thiols (Foresti, R., Clark, J.

Mammalian organisms have evolved a series of stratagems to counteract the negative effect of intracellular oxygen deficiency and favoring the adaptation of tissues to low oxygen tension. For example, there exist sensitive genes that, in the absence of oxygen, are readily stimulated to encode for modulators of erythropoiesis (erythropoietin), promoters of angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor), and proteins involved in alternative metabolic pathways for ATP generation (glycolytic enzymes) (1.Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Thus, the ultimate purpose of these inducible systems is to increase the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and improve oxygen delivery to hypoxic tissues. The expression of hypoxic-sensitive genes appears to require redox modification and phosphorylation of specific transcription factors such as hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1)1 (1.Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). In addition to the above mentioned systems, low oxygen or anoxic conditions affect the protein expression of nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) and heme oxygenase, two enzymatic pathways responsible for the synthesis of signaling molecules that regulate important biological activities (2.Maines M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2198) Google Scholar). Nitric oxide (NO), generated from the oxidation ofl-arginine by NOS enzymes, is a multifunctional interactive molecule involved in the modulation of vascular tone, inhibition of platelet aggregation, and oxygen transport to tissues (3.Palmer R.M.J. Ferrige A.G. Moncada S. Nature. 1987; 327: 524-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (9289) Google Scholar, 4.Ignarro L.J. Buga G.M. Wood K.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 9265-9269Crossref PubMed Scopus (4313) Google Scholar, 5.Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar). Under most physiological conditions, NO derives mainly from constitutively expressed endothelial NOS (ecNOS); however, the inducible isoform (iNOS) can generate substantial amounts of NO once appropriately stimulated by cytokines or other inflammation-mediated stimuli. Hypoxia has also been shown to affect differentially the expression and activity of the diverse NOS isoforms. Exposure of human umbilical vein endothelial cells to hypoxia results in decreased transcription of the ecNOS protein as well as reduced mRNA stability (6.Mcquillan L.P. Leung G.K. Marsden P.A. Kostyk S.K. Kourembanas S. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 267: H1921-H1927Google Scholar, 7.Phelan M.W. Faller D.V. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 167: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Similarly, bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells exposed to low oxygen levels show a marked repression in the ecNOS transcript and decreased NOS activity (8.Liao J.K. Zulueta J.J., Yu, F.S. Peng H.B. Cote C.G. Hassoun P.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2661-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In contrast, the iNOS gene appears to be up-regulated by conditions of low oxygen availability. Indeed, a functional hypoxia-responsive element has been detected in the promoter region of iNOS in murine macrophages (9.Melillo G. Musso T. Sica A. Taylor L.S. Cox G.W. Varesio L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1683-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), and induction of the iNOS transcript in vascular tissue was found using a chronic hypoxia model of pulmonary hypertension (10.Palmer L.A. Semenza G.L. Stoler M.H. Johns R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L212-L219PubMed Google Scholar). Heme oxygenase is the rate-limiting step in heme degradation; it catalyzes the oxidation of the α-meso carbon of the protoporphyrin ring leading to the formation of carbon monoxide (CO), free iron, and biliverdin (11.Tenhunen R. Marver H.S. Schmid R. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6388-6394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inducible isoform of heme oxygenase, HO-1, is a ubiquitous heat shock protein (HSP32) that is highly induced by diverse stress-related conditions (2.Maines M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2198) Google Scholar, 12.Abraham N.G. Drummond G.S. Lutton J.D. Kappas A. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 1996; 6: 129-168Crossref Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The end products of heme oxygenase may have crucial biological functions in the cardiovascular system. Bilirubin, which is formed from biliverdin by biliverdin reductase, is a potent antioxidant (13.Stocker R. Yamamoto Y. McDonagh A.F. Glazer A.N. Ames B.N. Science. 1987; 235: 1043-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (2900) Google Scholar) and has been shown recently to ameliorate postischemic myocardial dysfunction in a model of isolated heart (14.Clark J.E. Foresti R. Sarathchandra P. Kaur H. Green C.J. Motterlini R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: H643-H651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, enhanced CO production following HO-1 induction in vascular tissue effectively contributes to the suppression of both aortic vasoconstriction in vitro (15.Sammut I.A. Foresti R. Clark J.E. Exon D.J. Vesely M.J.J. Sarathchandra P. Green C.J. Motterlini R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 1437-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and acute hypertensive responses in vivo (16.Motterlini R. Gonzales A. Foresti R. Clark J.E. Green C.J. Winslow R.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 568-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Reports have also demonstrated that the HO-1/CO pathway is markedly up-regulated by hypoxia in vascular smooth muscle cells, cardiomyocytes, and heart tissue (17.Morita T. Perrella M.A. Lee M.E. Kourembanas S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1475-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 18.Borger D.R. Essig D.A. Am. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5375-5381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that aortic vasoconstriction following chronic hypoxia in rats involves the induction of endothelial HO-1 and the enhanced production of CO (20.Caudill T.K. Resta T.C. Kanagy N.L. Walker B.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: R1025-R1030PubMed Google Scholar). In view of the vasoregulatory effects of both NO and CO, it appears that the heme oxygenase and NOS pathways could actively participate in the maintenance of local tissue oxygenation; however, how these two systems interact mutually in response to limited availability of oxygen has not been examined previously. In previous studies, we demonstrated that various NO-releasing compounds induce endothelial HO-1 protein expression and heme oxygenase activity and that thiols are important regulators of this effect (21.Foresti R. Clark J.E. Green C.J. Motterlini R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18411-18417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar,22.Foresti R. Motterlini R. Free Rad. Res. 1999; 31: 459-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In the present study we examined the temporal pattern of ecNOS/iNOS and HO-1 expression in aortic endothelial cells exposed to hypoxia. Having established that iNOS expression precedes the up-regulation of HO-1 protein, we investigated a possible involvement of endogenously generated NO, glutathione, andS-nitrosothiols in modulating hypoxia-mediated HO-1 induction. Inhibitors of ecNOS and iNOS, carboxy-PTIO (CPTIO), manganese (III) tetrakis(4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (MnTBAP),S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), and [1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazole[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one] (ODQ) were obtained from Alexis Corporation (Bingham, Nottingham, U. K.). Tin protoporphyrin IX (SnPPIX) was from Porphyrin Products Inc. (Logan, UT). N-Acetylcysteine, uric acid, 1,3-dimethyl-2-thiourea, and all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Bovine aortic endothelial cells were purchased from the European Collection of Animal Cell Culture (ECACC, Salisbury, U. K.), cultured in 75-cm2 flasks, and grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Endothelial cells at confluence were transferred to an air-tight chamber (Billups-Rothenberg Inc., Del Mar, CA) and flushed with a mixture of 95% N2and 5% CO2. The gas was infused continuously into the air-tight chamber at a flow rate of 5 liters/min for the first 2 h and at 1 liter/min for the following hours of incubation. In preliminary experiments conducted under these conditions, it was found that the pO2 measured in the media by an oxygen electrode was 2 mm Hg after a 2-h exposure to hypoxia and did not fluctuate from this value throughout the remaining incubation period. Within the hypoxia chamber, cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. A time course (0–24 h) of heme oxygenase activity, HO-1, cNOS, and iNOS protein expression was determined in endothelial cells exposed to hypoxia. At specific time points, NOS activity was also measured. To examine the involvement of endogenously produced NO on heme oxygenase activation, cells were exposed to hypoxia (18 h) in the presence of ecNOS/iNOS inhibitors.N G-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME, 1 mm) was used as the inhibitor of ecNOS, whereas S-(2-aminoethyl)isothiourea (ITU) and [l-N 6-(1-iminoethyl)-lysine dihydrochloride] (l-NIL) at concentrations of 20 and 40 μm were used as selective inhibitors of iNOS. In an additional set of experiments, heme oxygenase activity was measured in endothelial cells 18 h after hypoxic treatment in the presence of 100 μm CPTIO, a NO scavenger. To assess a possible role of intracellular redox changes in the stimulation of the heme oxygenase pathway by hypoxia, total glutathione (GSH + GSSG) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG) were measured at the indicated time points. In addition, heme oxygenase activity was determined in endothelial cells exposed to low oxygen tension in the presence of the following compounds: N-acetylcysteine (1 mm), a precursor of glutathione synthesis and permeable reducing agent; uric acid (1 mm), a scavenger of peroxynitrite; 1,3-dimethyl-2-thiourea (1 mm), a specific scavenger of hydroxyl radical; MnTBAP, a cell-permeable superoxide dismutase mimetic and peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst; and the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase. S-Nitrosothiols (RSNO) were also measured during hypoxia at specific time points. To examine the possible role of S-nitrosation in the modulation of heme oxygenase activity, cells were exposed to hypoxia for 6 h in the presence of 0.5 mm GSNO and compared with cells treated with the compound in normoxic conditions. In additional experiments, cells were exposed to hypoxia in the presence of SnPPIX (50 μm), an inhibitor of heme oxygenase activity, or ODQ (100 nm–10 μm), a potent inhibitor of guanylate cyclase activity. Heme oxygenase activity assay was performed as described previously (23.Motterlini R. Foresti R. Intaglietta M. Vandegriff K. Winslow R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: H648-H655PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, microsomes from harvested cells were added to a reaction mixture containing NADPH, rat liver cytosol as a source of biliverdin reductase, and the substrate hemin. The reaction was conducted at 37 °C in the dark for 1 h, terminated by the addition of 1 ml of chloroform, and the extracted bilirubin was calculated by the difference in absorbance between 464 and 530 nm (ε = 40 mm−1 cm−1). Samples of endothelial cells treated for the heme oxygenase activity assay were also analyzed by Western immunoblot technique as described previously (21.Foresti R. Clark J.E. Green C.J. Motterlini R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18411-18417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Briefly, an equal amount of proteins (30 μg) for each sample was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred overnight to nitrocellulose membranes, and the nonspecific binding of antibodies was blocked with 3% non-fat dried milk in PBS. Membranes were then probed with a polyclonal rabbit anti-HO-1 antibody (Stressgen, Victoria, Canada) (1:1,000 dilution in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4) for 2 h at room temperature. When probed for NOS proteins, membranes were incubated for 2 h with anti-ecNOS and anti-iNOS antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 1:20,000 dilution in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4). After three washes with PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, blots were visualized using an amplified alkaline phosphatase kit from Sigma (Extra-3A) and the relative density of bands analyzed by an imaging densitometer (model GS-700, Bio-Rad). Endothelial cells were seeded onto Lab-Tek® chamber slides (Nunc Inc., Naperville, IL) at a density of 106 cells/ml. They were grown to confluence and exposed to hypoxia for 18 h in the presence of various agents. The medium was then discarded, and the upper part of the slide well frame was removed. Slides were washed twice very gently with cold (4 °C) PBS for 5 min. Cells were then fixed in cold 95% v/v ethanol for 10 min and gently washed again in cold PBS for 5 min. Slides were immersed in cold 3% v/v H2O2 in PBS for 5 min followed by 5% v/v normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories Ltd., Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, U. K.) in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Next, slides were covered with rabbit anti-HO-1 antibody (1:1,000 dilution in PBS) and left for 18 h at 4 °C. Slides were then covered with a 1:100 dilution in PBS of biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Vector Laboratories Ltd.) and left for 60 min at room temperature on an orbital shaker. After incubation with the secondary antibody, slides were washed again with PBS at room temperature, and the tertiary avidin-biotin-antibody complex was applied (Vectastain® ABC Elite Kit, Vector Laboratories Ltd.) for 60 min at room temperature on an orbital shaker. Slides were washed in PBS for 5 min and finally incubated with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB Substrate Kit, Vector Laboratories Ltd.) until suitable staining developed (about 10 min) and analyzed by an imaging densitometer. Total RNA was isolated by phenol-chloroform using the method described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (24.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63088) Google Scholar). Total RNA was run on a 1.3% denaturing agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde and transferred onto a nylon membrane. The membrane was hybridized using [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probes to rat HO-1 gene as described previously (25.Vesely M.J.J. Exon D.J. Clark J.E. Foresti R. Green C.J. Motterlini R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1087-C1094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Vesely M.J.J. Sanders R. Green C.J. Motterlini R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and staining of the 18 S rRNA band was used to confirm integrity and equal loading of RNA. The hybridized membrane was exposed to radiographic film and bands analyzed using an imaging densitometer. Total glutathione (GSH + GSSG) was measured in endothelial cells at various times of hypoxia using a modification of a method described previously (27.Adams J.D. Lauterburg B.H. Mitchell J.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1983; 227: 749-754PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested in ice-cold PBS, centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), containing 5 mm EDTA (buffer 1). The cell suspension was freeze-thawed three times, and an aliquot (60 μl) was added to an equal volume of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), containing 12 mm EDTA and 10 mm5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB). The sample was mixed by tilting and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 2 min. The supernatant was added to a cuvette containing 0.5 unit of glutathione reductase in buffer 1, equilibrated for 1 min, and the reaction initiated by adding NADPH (220 nmol). The change in absorbance at 412 nm was recorded over a period of 5 min using a reference cuvette containing equal concentrations of NADPH, DTNB, and enzyme. To assay GSSG, an aliquot of the cell suspension (400 μl) was added to an equal volume of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), containing 17.5 mm EDTA and 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide. The sample was mixed, centrifuged and the supernatant passed through a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters, Watford, U. K.) to remove the excess N-ethylmaleimide and washed with buffer 1. The sample was added to a cuvette containing DTNB and glutathione reductase and the assay performed as for the measurement of total GSH. The intracellular glutathione content, expressed as nmol/mg of protein, was determined by comparison with a standard curve obtained with GSH and GSSG solutions. NOS activity was determined using the hemoglobin assay as described previously (28.Hevel J.M. Marletta M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The assay is based on the oxidation of oxyhemoglobin with NO and is performed spectrophotometrically by measuring the formation of methemoglobin under initial rate conditions. Briefly, cells were washed with PBS, gently scraped using a rubber policeman, and the cellular pellet separated by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in a solution containing 0.32 msucrose, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and homogenized. The supernatant obtained after centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min was used for NOS activity measurements. The reaction mixture contained (in a final volume of 1 ml): 1 mm l-arginine, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm NADPH, 12 μm tetrahydro-l-biopterin, 5 μmoxyhemoglobin, 4 μm FAD, 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), and 0.5 mg of protein sample. The formation of methemoglobin was monitored by the change in absorbance which occurred over time between 411 and 401 nm using a double beam spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer 559). Detection of S-nitrosothiols in cell extracts was performed after cleavage of the S-nitroso bond by measuring the NO released using the chemiluminescence reaction between NO and the luminol-hydrogen peroxide system (29.Clancy R.M. Levartovsky D. Leszczynskapiziak J. Yegudin J. Abramson S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3680-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 30.Kikuchi K. Nagano T. Hayakawa H. Hirata Y. Hirobe M. Anal. Chem. 1993; 65: 1794-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Differences in the data among the groups were analyzed by using one-way analysis of variance combined with the Bonferroni test. Values were expressed as a mean ± S.E. and differences between groups were considered to be significant atp < 0.05. Exposure of aortic endothelial cells to severe hypoxia (pO2≤ 2 mm Hg) resulted in a time-dependent increase of heme oxygenase activity and HO-1 protein expression (Figs.1 A and2 B). The increase was evident at 12 h, and both HO-1 protein and heme oxygenase activity continued to rise in the following hours of incubation. Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1 B) indicated that up-regulation of the HO-1 gene by hypoxia occurs at the transcriptional level and precedes protein expression, as HO-1 mRNA was markedly visible at 6 h and continued to increase for the entire period of the hypoxic treatment.Figure 2Time course of endothelial iNOS , ecNOS , and HO-1 protein expression during hypoxia. Western blot analysis of cells exposed to hypoxia for different times using specific antibodies for iNOS and ecNOS (panel A) and HO-1 (panel B) is shown. Samples were processed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each blot is representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A time-dependent increase in the expression of endothelial iNOS protein was also observed during hypoxia (Fig. 2 A); this was accompanied by enhanced NOS activity (see Fig. 7). However, iNOS protein was significantly up-regulated at 6 and 12 h hypoxia and started to decrease at 18 and 24 h. It is important to emphasize that at 6 h hypoxia, iNOS expression was already markedly elevated, whereas no changes in heme oxygenase activity and HO-1 protein expression were yet to be detected (Figs. 1,2 A, and 2 B). In contrast, endothelial ecNOS protein, which is highly expressed under control conditions (normoxia), was down-regulated by hypoxia in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2 A). These data reveal that stimulation of iNOS protein by hypoxia occurred very rapidly and preceded both the increased expression of HO-1 protein and heme oxygenase activity. Our group has demonstrated the ability of various NO-releasing agents to increase heme oxygenase activity and HO-1 protein expression in bovine aortic endothelial cells, aortic tissue, and other cell types (15.Sammut I.A.

Because a transient increase in iNOS protein and NOS activity preceded the induction of heme oxygenase during hypoxia, we wanted to verify whether iNOS-derived NO is required for triggering the expression of HO-1. As shown in Fig. 3, exposure of endothelial cells to hypoxia in the presence of a selective inhibitor of iNOS (ITU) resulted in a concentration-dependent attenuation of heme oxygenase activity (p < 0.05). We could not use higher concentrations of ITU because in preliminary experiments we found that concentrations above 40 μm can directly affect heme oxygenase activity in an in vitro assay. l-NIL, another inhibitor of iNOS activity, had a less pronounced effect; however, the presence of the NO scavenger CPTIO (100 μm) during hypoxia decreased endothelial heme oxygenase activity from 2,231 ± 140 to 969 ± 60 pmol of bilirubin/mg of protein/h (p < 0.05, Fig. 3). In contrast, l-NAME (1 mm), an inhibitor of cNOS, had no effect on heme oxygenase activation by hypoxia (Fig. 3). These data suggest that augmented NO production following stimulation of iNOS contributes to increased HO-1 expression and heme oxygenase activity under conditions of reduced oxygen tension. This effect appears to be cGMP-independent because ODQ, a selective inhibitor of guanylate cyclase activity, did not prevent hypoxia-mediated heme oxygenase activation (data not shown). Several lines of evidence suggest that glutathione is a crucial intracellular modulator of HO-1 gene expression both in vitro and in vivo (21.Foresti R. Clark J.E. Green C.J. Motterlini R. J. Biol.

Fig.4 shows the changes in total glutathione (GSH + GSSG), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and the ratio between reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH:GSSG) in endothelial cells at various time points of hypoxia. Hypoxia caused a substantial change in GSSG content (Fig. 4, center) which was markedly increased at 6 h hypoxia (14-fold, p < 0.05versus control), transiently diminished at 12 h, and significantly elevated after 24 h hypoxia (24.5-fold,p < 0.05). It can be observed that this effect was associated with a gradual and significant increase in total glutathione levels (Fig. 4, top) that were maximal at 12 h hypoxia (95%, p < 0.05 versus control), suggesting that reduced oxygen tension stimulates the enzymatic activities responsible for glutathione synthesis. However, at all time points examined, hypoxia caused a substantial change in the GSH:GSSG ratio, an index of the redox status of the cell. As shown in Fig. 4(bottom), the GSH:GSSG ratio decreased significantly from 115 ± 10 (control) to 11.3 ± 0.9 after 6 h hypoxia (p < 0.05); although this index transiently increased at 12 h hypoxia, a further decrease of this parameter was observed at 24 h hypoxia (5.8 ± 0.8, p < 0.05). The fact that the transient recovery of the GSH:GSSG ratio at 12 h hypoxia correlated with a rise in total glutathione is indicative of the inherent ability of cells to produce new glutathione in response to augmented GSSG. Taken together, these data reveal that exposure of cells to severe and prolonged hypoxic conditions results in the rapid formation of GSSG, leading to a marked alteration in the redox status of the intracellular milieu. Because thiol residues are important targets for NO-mediated biological activities, and we observed radical changes in GSH:GSSG ratio during hy"
https://openalex.org/W2060762539,"The superoxide-producing phagocyte NADPH oxidase can be activated by arachidonic acid (AA) or by phosphorylation of p47 <sup>phox</sup> under cell-free conditions. The molecular mechanism underlying the activation, however, has remained largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that AA, at high concentrations (50–100 μm), induces direct interaction between the oxidase factors p47 <sup>phox</sup> and p22 <sup>phox</sup> in parallel with superoxide production. The interaction, being required for the oxidase activation, is mediated via the Src homology 3 (SH3) domains of p47 <sup>phox</sup> (p47-(SH3)<sub>2</sub>), which are intramolecularly masked in a resting state. We also show that AA disrupts complexation of p47-(SH3)<sub>2</sub> with its intramolecular target fragment (amino acids 286–340) without affecting association of p47-(SH3)<sub>2</sub>with p22 <sup>phox</sup>, indicating that the disruption plays a crucial role in the induced interaction with p22 <sup>phox</sup>. Phosphorylation of p47 <sup>phox</sup> by protein kinase C partially replaces the effects of AA; treatment of the SH3 target fragment with PKC<i>in vitro</i> results in a completely impaired interaction with p47-(SH3)<sub>2</sub>, and the same treatment of the full-length p47 <sup>phox</sup> leads to both interaction with p22 <sup>phox</sup> and oxidase activation without AA, but to a lesser extent. Furthermore, phosphorylated p47 <sup>phox</sup> effectively binds to p22 <sup>phox</sup> and activates the oxidase in the presence of AA at low concentrations (1–5 μm), where an unphosphorylated protein only slightly supports superoxide production. Thus AA, at high concentrations, fully induces the interaction of p47 <sup>phox</sup> with p22 <sup>phox</sup> by itself, whereas, at low concentrations, AA synergizes with phosphorylation of p47 <sup>phox</sup> to facilitate the interaction, thereby activating the NADPH oxidase."

Both necessary and sufficient roles have been described for the mitogen activated protein kinase1 (MAPK) signaling pathway, specific protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, and calcineurin. Here we investigate the interdependence between calcineurin, MAPK, and PKC isoforms in regulating cardiomyocyte hypertrophy using three separate approaches. Hearts from hypertrophic calcineurin transgenic mice were characterized for PKC and MAPK activation. Transgenic hearts demonstrated activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), but not p38 MAPK factors. Calcineurin transgenic hearts demonstrated increased activation of PKCα, β1, and θ, but not of ε, β2, or λ. In a second approach, cultured cardiomyocytes were infected with a calcineurin adenovirus to induce hypertrophy and the effects of pharmacologic inhibitors or co-infection with a dominant negative adenovirus were examined. Calcineurin-mediated hypertrophy was prevented with PKC inhibitors, Ca2+chelation, and attenuated with a dominant negative SEK-1 (MKK4) adenovirus, but inhibitors of ERK or p38 activation had no effect. In a third approach, we examined the activation of MAPK factors and PKC isoforms during the progression of load-induced hypertrophy in aortic banded rats with or without cyclosporine. We determined that inhibition of calcineurin activity with cyclosporine prevented PKCα, θ, and JNK activation, but did not affect PKCε, β, λ, ERK1/2, or p38 activation. Collectively, these data indicate that calcineurin hypertrophic signaling is interconnected with PKCα, θ, and JNK in the heart, while PKCε, β, λ, p38, and ERK1/2 are not involved in calcineurin-mediated hypertrophy.

Cardiac hypertrophy is characterized by an increase in cell surface area of individual myocytes, enhanced sarcomeric organization, and the re-expression of specific fetal genes. While initially beneficial, prolonged cardiac hypertrophy eventually leads to decompensation, dilated cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, fibrotic disease, sudden death, or overt failure (1.Levy D. Garrison R.J. Savage D.D. Kannel W.B. Castelli W.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 322: 1561-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (4810) Google Scholar). Recent investigation has centered around identifying the intracellular signaling pathways that regulate the hypertrophic growth of cardiac myocytes so that novel pharmacologic therapies might be employed to prevent the long-term maladaptive effects of hypertrophy.The hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes has been associated with alterations in intracellular signal transduction pathways, including Ras, the three main branches of the MAPK signaling cascade (ERKs,1 JNKs, and p38s), PKC, and calcineurin. A large number of in vitro studies have identified important roles for the three branches of the MAPK signaling pathway in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Specifically, the importance of ERKs in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy has been proposed based on studies with the pharmacologic MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 or by transient transfection of cDNAs encoding activated or dominant negative MEK1 cDNAs (reviewed in Refs. 2.Sugden P.H. Clerk A. Cell Signal. 1997; 9: 337-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar and 3.Sugden P.H. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 633-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, other studies have disputed the importance of ERK signaling in directing the hypertrophic program of cardiomyocytes in culture (4.Thorburn J. Frost J.A. Thorburn A. J.

In contrast, two studies have reported that p38 inhibition was not sufficient to attenuate agonist-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, suggesting more specialized roles for individual MAPK signaling factors (10.Choukroun G.

Physiol. 1999; 277: H331-H341PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, a recent report demonstrated that ERKs were important at the onset of hypertrophic stimulation while p38 factors appeared to act later in response to agonist stimulation (16.Clerk A. Michael A. Sugden P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar).Members of the protein kinase C (PKC) superfamily have also been shown to regulate hypertrophic growth of cardiac myocytes. Specific PKC isoforms are rapidly activated in the heart following agonist-induced G protein-coupled receptors activation (reviewed in Refs. 17.Dorn G.W., II. Brown J.H. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1999; 9: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar and 18.Pucat M. Vassort G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 157: 65-72PubMed Google Scholar). Acute mechanical stretch of the left ventricle induces translocation of the PKCε isoform, while chronic pressure overload activates PKCα and -ε isoforms in guinea pig heart (19.Paul K. Ball N.A. Dorn G.W., II. Walsh R.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 20.Takeishi Y. Bhagwat A. Ball N.A. Kirkpatrick D.L. Periasamy M. Walsh R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 267: H53-H62Google Scholar). PKCβ was also shown to be sufficient to mediate cardiac hypertrophy when overexpressed in the hearts of transgenic mice (21.Bowman J.C. Steinberg S.F.

Walsh R.A. King G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9320-9325Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Once activated, PKCs are thought to directly enhance hypertrophic gene expression by acting on transcription factors such as transcription enhancer factor-1, serum response factor, and spl (23.Sadoshima J. Izumo S. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 424-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 24.Karns L.R. Kariya K. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 410-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Lastly, the expression and activity of PKCα and -β isoforms are elevated in the failing human heart, supporting the notion that PKC isoforms regulate multiple responses in cardiomyocyte disease states (25.Takeishi Y. Jalili T. Ball N.A. Walsh R.A. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 26.Bowling N. Walsh R.A. Song G. Estridge T. Sandusky G.E. Fouts R.L. Mintze K. Pickard T.

Circulation. 1999; 99: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar).More recently, an additional intracellular signaling pathway has been implicated in the control of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy through the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin and the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T-cells 3. Cardiac-specific expression of a constitutively active calcineurin cDNA in transgenic mice was shown to induce a 2–3-fold increase in heart size that rapidly progressed to overt failure (27.Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2191) Google Scholar). Further evidence implicating this signaling pathway came from the observation that pharmacologic inhibition of calcineurin with cyclosporin A or FK506 was sufficient to attenuate hypertrophy of cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes induced by angiotensin II or PE (27.Molkentin J.D.

This observation was extended in vivo whereby cyclosporin or FK506 were shown to block hypertrophy or dilation in three transgenic mouse models of cardiomyopathy (28.Sussman M.A. Lim H.W. Gude N.

Cyclosporine was also shown to significantly attenuate pressure overload hypertrophy induced by aortic constriction in the rat (28.Sussman M.A. Lim H.W. Gude N. Taigen T. Olson E.N. Robbins J.

Res. 1999; 84: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Lastly, myocardial pressure overload was also shown to significantly induce cardiac calcineurin phosphatase activity (29.Lim, H. W., De Windt, L. J., Steinberg, L., Taigen, T., Witt, S. A., Kimball, T. R., and Molkentin, J. D. (2000) Circulation, in pressGoogle Scholar). However, the potential interplay between calcineurin and other hypertrophic signaling pathways is not known.To this end, we investigated the interconnectivity between calcineurin and the other hypertrophy associated signaling pathways. Using three different approaches, calcineurin signaling was shown to be interconnected with PKCα, PKCθ, and JNK in the induction and maintenance of cardiac hypertrophy.DISCUSSIONNumerous studies have implicated roles for a wide range of intracellular signaling factors in cardiac hypertrophy. However, very little is known of the interconnectivity or hierarchies among multiple signaling pathways in the heart. Here we utilized three different approaches to investigate the interconnectivity between calcineurin hypertrophic signaling and MAPK and PKC factors. 1) Calcineurin transgenic hearts were characterized for the activation state of different signaling factors in vivo. 2) Adenoviral-mediated gene transfer of an activated calcineurin cDNA was performed in cultured cardiomyocytes and the effects of pharmacologic and dominant negative inhibitors were investigated. 3) A physiologic model of pressure overload hypertrophy was employed to determine if inhibition of endogenous calcineurin affects the activation of other signaling factors in vivo. All three approaches implicated cross-talk between calcineurin, PKC, and JNK.Interconnection between Calcineurin and PKC in Cardiac HypertrophyCalcineurin transgenic hearts were characterized by a significant activation of PKCα, PKCθ, and PKCβ1 isoforms as detected by translocation to the membrane or particulate subcellular fraction. In cultured cardiomyocytes, calcineurin mediated hypertrophy by adenoviral gene transfer was blocked by PKC inhibition using either chelerythrine or PMA-induced down-regulation. Lastly, cyclosporine treatment of aortic-banded rats blocked PKCα and PKCθ activation in the heart in vivo. These data suggest that calcineurin-directed hypertrophy requires PKC activation, suggesting at least one interconnection between two signaling cascades in the heart. A potential interconnection between PKC and calcineurin has already been suggested in other cell types. Numerous studies in immune cells have shown that calcium inophores (calcineurin activation) and PKC agonists synergistically activate inducible promoters or immune response genes (reviewed in Ref. 46.Jain J. Loh C. Rao A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). PKC and calcineurin were shown to synergistically activate IκB kinase activity in T cells, resulting in NF-κB activation (47.Trushin S.A. Pennington K.N. Algeciras-Schimnich A. Paya C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22923-22931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and nPKC isoforms were shown to be activated by calcineurin during thymocyte apoptosis (48.Asada A. Zhao Y. Kondo S. Iwata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28392-28398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It is also interesting to note that PKC and calcineurin share a common intracellular docking protein, AKAP79, which may be involved in coordinating reactive responses (49.Klauck T.M. Faux M.C. Labudda K. Langeberg L.K. Jaken S. Scott J.D. Science. 1996; 271: 15089-15092Crossref Scopus (480) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms whereby a kinase (PKC) and a phosphatase (calcineurin) might synergize to promote reactive signaling in either T-cells or cardiac myocytes is unknown. One possible hypothesis is that each pathway may counterbalance the net effect of the other pathway so that desensitization is avoided. Consequently, maintaining a balance between net phosphorylation and dephosphorylation might allow for enhanced cycling of multiple reactive signaling effectors.Interconnection between Calcineurin and MAPK in Cardiac HypertrophyWe also analyzed the interconnectivity between calcineurin and MAPK signaling factors. Calcineurin transgenic hearts demonstrate activation of JNK (p54), mild ERK1/2 activation, but not of p38. In fact, careful inspection of multiple time points suggests that p38 phosphorylation might be down-regulated in calcineurin TG hearts (Fig. 1 A, and data not shown). In vitro, a dominant negative SEK-1 adenovirus attenuated AdCnA-induced hypertrophy in cultured cardiomyocytes, while p38 and ERK1/2 inhibition did not effect AdCnA-induced hypertrophy. Lastly, cyclosporine treatment of aortic-banded rats blocked JNK (p54) activation in the heart, while p38 and ERK1/2 remain in an enhanced phosphorylation state.The observation that cyclosporine significantly attenuates load-induced hypertrophy (29.Lim, H. W., De Windt, L. J., Steinberg, L., Taigen, T., Witt, S. A., Kimball, T. R., and Molkentin, J. D. (2000) Circulation, in pressGoogle Scholar), despite p38 and ERK1/2 activation, suggests that these two signaling pathways are not critical for maintaining load-induced hypertrophy in the absence of additional signaling pathways. However, these data might also simply suggest that calcineurin is parallel to ERK and p38 signaling pathways in programming cardiac hypertrophy. A number of in vitrostudies have implicated an important role for either p38 or ERK signaling in the hypertrophy of cultured cardiomyocytes (reviewed in Refs. 2.Sugden P.H. Clerk A. Cell Signal. 1997; 9: 337-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar and 3.Sugden P.H. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 633-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Despite these positive reports, a nearly equal number of in vitro studies have disputed the importance of either ERKs or p38 MAPK factors in mediating cultured cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (4.Thorburn J.

For example, adenoviral-mediated infection of an activated MKK6 factor (activates p38) or transfection of the MKK6 cDNA was reported to induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro, suggesting a sufficient role for p38 in hypertrophy (8.Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar,11.Wang Y. Huanf S. Sah V.P. Ross J. Brown J.H. Han J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2161-2168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Yet, pacing induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was shown to be associated with a down-regulation of p38 activity, despite progressive hypertrophy (15.Hines W.A. Thorburn J. Thorburn A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H331-H341PubMed Google Scholar). This later observation is interesting since pacing might be predicted to activate calcineurin through enhanced inotropy.A number of recent studies have shown that the stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs or JNKs) are critical regulators of cardiac hypertrophyin vitro and in vivo. Choukroun et al.(14.Choukroun G. Hajjar R. Fry S. del Monte F. Haq S. Guerrero L. Picard M. Rosenzweig A. Force T. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) demonstrated that dominant negative inhibition of JNK in vivo attenuated load-induced hypertrophy in aortic-banded rats. JNKs have also been reported to be activated by pressure overload hypertrophy in aortic-banded rats and JNK activation was shown in the remote myocardium of infected rat hearts (14.Choukroun G. Hajjar R. Fry S. del Monte F. Haq S. Guerrero L. Picard M. Rosenzweig A. Force T. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 50.Li W.G. Zaheer A. Coppey L. Oskarsson H.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 816-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).Calcineurin, PKC, and JNK as an Interconnected Regulatory NetworkRecently, calcineurin was shown to synergize with PKCθ to activate JNK activity and expression of the interleukin-2 promoter (51.Werlen G. Jacinto E. Xia Y. Karin M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3101-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In T-cells, cyclosporine was shown to inhibit JNK activation and interleukin-2 promoter activity (52.Matsuda S. Moriguchi T. Koyasu S. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12378-12382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). These reports are interesting considering the relationship that we have identified between calcineurin, PKC, and JNK in cardiomyocytes. It is possible that a conserved interconnected regulatory circuit exists between calcineurin, PKC, and JNK in multiple cell types. Indeed, PKC may even regulate calcineurin activity through phosphorylation of serine 411 within the calmodulin-binding domain (53.Hashimoto Y. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16524-16529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 54.Tung H.Y.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This paradigm would suggest that targeted inhibition of one or more of these three components would diminish the entire reactive signaling response. We have previously shown that inhibition of calcineurin with cyclosporine or FK506 attenuates cardiac hypertrophy in vivo (28.Sussman M.A. Lim H.W. Gude N. Taigen T. Olson E.N. Robbins J. Colbert M.C. Gualberto A. Wieczorek D.F. Molkentin J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1690-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 29.Lim, H. W., De Windt, L. J., Steinberg, L., Taigen, T., Witt, S. A., Kimball, T. R., and Molkentin, J. D. (2000) Circulation, in pressGoogle Scholar). The observation that cyclosporine also effects PKC and JNK activation explains how direct inhibition of a single factor, calcineurin, attenuates the entire hypertrophic response in vivo. Consistent with this notion, direct inhibition of either JNK or PKC also attenuates the hypertrophic response (10.Choukroun G. Hajjar R. Kyriakis J.M. Bonventre J.V. Rosenzweig A. Force T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 14.Choukroun G. Hajjar R. Fry S. del Monte F. Haq S. Guerrero L. Picard M. Rosenzweig A. Force T. J. Clin.

Res. 1996; 79: 1086-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).In this report, we show that cyclosporine inhibits PKCα and PKCθ activation in pressure overloaded hearts (Fig. 8, A andB). It is unlikely that cyclosporine directly inhibits PKCα or PKCθ in the heart given a lack of precedence in other cell types, although this interpretation cannot be ruled out. However, the simplest interpretation is that cyclosporine leads to calcineurin inhibition which ultimately effects PKCα and θ activation. Taken together, these data suggest that an interconnected network between calcineurin, PKC, and JNK are of critical importance in cardiac hypertrophy. This paradigm would more fully explain why targeted inhibition of any one of these three signaling pathways diminishes the entire hypertrophic response.Potential Cross-regulation between Calcineurin and Calcium HandlingCalcineurin is activated by increased intracellular calcium concentration through association with calmodulin. The catalytic subunit of calcineurin is also regulated by the EF-hand calcium-binding protein calcineurin B (reviewed in Ref. 56.Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13367-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). In cardiomyocytes, we have shown that adenoviral gene transfer of an activated calcineurin cDNA leads to an increase in the calcium transient. We have also determined that cardiac myocytes derived from adult calcineurin transgenic hearts have a significant increase in the calcium transient. 2A. Yatani, J. D. Molkentin, and E. G. Kranias, unpublished observation. Taken together, these data suggest a working hypothesis whereby calcineurin may function as a calcium thermostat. Indeed, calcineurin in yeast regulates the activity of the calcium pump, and calcineurin in mammalian cells is associated with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor and potentially regulates the release of reactive calcium (57.Degand I. Catty P. Talla E. Thines-Sempoux D. de Kerchove d'Exaerde A. Goffeau A. Ghislain M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar,58.Cameron A.M. Steiner J.P. Roskams A.J. Ali S.M. Ronnett G.V. Snyder S.H. Cell. 1995; 83: 463-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). However, the direct mechanisms whereby calcineurin-directed dephosphorylation would augment calcium release or affect subcellular pools of reactive calcium in a cardiomyocyte is not known.Model of Calcineurin-induced Cardiac HypertrophyThis study begins to examine the potential interconnections between multiple intracellular mediators and the orchestration of the hypertrophic response. To date, no study has shown a direct mechanism whereby calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation might lead to the activation of another intracellular signaling kinase. Given this limitation, a number of scenarios might account for the interconnective signaling between calcineurin, PKC, and JNK in the heart. It is formally possible that calcineurin directly dephosphorylates a PKC or JNK regulatory protein, permitting or enhancing their activation. Indeed, PKC and calcineurin are co-localized to the common docking protein AKAP79, where direct communication may occur. However, it is also possible that calcineurin activation simply leads to the general promotion of the hypertrophic phenotype which indirectly leads to PKC and JNK activation. Calcineurin activation may set in motion a program of hypertrophy such that reinforcing signaling networks are activated which eventually lead to JNK and"
https://openalex.org/W2095859714,"Cardiomyopathy induced by doxorubicin (DOX) has long been a major impediment of clinical applications of this effective anticancer agent. Previous studies have shown that cardiac-specific metallothionein (MT)-overexpressing transgenic mice are highly resistant to DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. To investigate cellular and molecular mechanisms by which MT participates in this cytoprotection, transgenic mice containing high levels of cardiac MT and non-transgenic controls were treated intraperitoneally with DOX at a single dose of 15 mg/kg and sacrificed on the 4th day after treatment. Myocardial apoptosis was detected by a terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay and confirmed by electron microscopy of immunogold staining of apoptotic nuclei. Dual staining of cardiac α-sarcomeric actin using an immunohistochemical method further identified apoptotic myocytes. Apoptosis was significantly inhibited in the transgenic myocardium. The anti-apoptotic effect of MT was further revealed in primary cultures of neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, DOX activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which was critically involved in the apoptotic process, as demonstrated by inhibition of DOX-induced apoptosis by a p38-specific inhibitor, SB203580. Both DOX-induced p38 MAPK activation and apoptosis were dramatically inhibited in the transgenic cardiomyocytes. The results thus demonstrate that DOX induces apoptosis in cardiomyocytes both in vivo andin vitro and MT suppresses this effect through at least in part inhibition of p38 MAPK activation.

It is a valuable component of various chemotherapeutic regimens used to treat breast and small cell lung carcinoma. In metastatic thyroid carcinoma, DOX is probably the best available agent. It is also an important agent for the successful treatment of Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. However, severe cardiotoxicity of DOX is a major limiting factor for its effective use in the treatment of all malignancies (1.Ferrans V.J. Cancer Treat. Rep. 1978; 62: 955-961PubMed Google Scholar). The proposed mechanism for the cardiac toxic effect of DOX is the production of reactive oxygen species during its intracellular metabolism (2.Myers C.E. Science. 1977; 197: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). Significant efforts have been directed toward developing conjunctive therapy to decrease DOX cardiotoxicity and enhance its anticancer therapeutic efficacy. Previous studies using a cardiac-specific metallothionein (MT)-overexpressing transgenic mouse model have demonstrated that MT provides protection against DOX cardiotoxicity (3.Kang Y.J. Chen Y., Yu, A. Voss-McCowan M. Epstein P.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1501-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The same protective effect of MT was also observed in recently established primary cultures of neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes (4.Wang G.W. Kang Y.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 288: 938-944PubMed Google Scholar). MT is a ubiquitous, low molecular weight, and highly inducible protein (5.Hamer D.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 913-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which has been shown to function as an antioxidant (6.Thornalley P.J. Vasak M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 827: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 7.Thomas J.P. Bachowski G.J. Girotti A.W. Biochim. Biophys.

It thus holds high potential for pharmaceutical and gene therapy development in preventing DOX cardiotoxicity (3.Kang Y.J. Chen Y., Yu, A. Voss-McCowan M. Epstein P.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1501-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 4.Wang G.W. Kang Y.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 288: 938-944PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Hamer D.H. Annu. Rev.

Physiol. 1999; 276: H993-H997PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to know how MT functions in cardiac protection against DOX toxicity. DOX induces apoptosis in several tumor cell lines (14.Azmi S. Bhatia L. Khanna N. Dhawan D. Singh N. Cancer Lett. 1997; 111: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 15.Skladanowski A. Konopa J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and multiple organ systems, including intestines, kidneys, skin, and thymus (16.Zhang J. Clark J.R.J. Herman E.H. Ferrans V.J. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1996; 28: 1931-1943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar,17.Cece R. Cazzaniga S. Morelli D. Sfondrini L. Bignotto M. Menard S. Colnaghi M.I. Balsari A. Lab. Invest. 1996; 75: 601-609PubMed Google Scholar). In our previous studies, we have observed that DOX induced apoptosis in mouse myocardium, as determined by a TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labeling) assay and an electron microscopy method (18.Kang Y.J. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1997; 38: 192Google Scholar). However, in DOX-treated spontaneously hypertensive rats, apoptosis was found to occur in renal and intestinal epithelial cells. In the heart, DOX-induced apoptosis occurred in endothelial cells, interstitial dendritic cells and macrophages, but not in myocytes (16.Zhang J. Clark J.R.J. Herman E.H. Ferrans V.J. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1996; 28: 1931-1943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These controversial observations indicate that additional studies are needed to determine the role of apoptosis in the loss of cardiomyocytes due to DOX treatment. The primary cultures of cardiomyocytes isolated from the cardiac-specific MT-overexpressing transgenic mice were found to contain high levels of MT and be highly resistant to DOX-induced morphological alteration, mitochondrial damage, and lactate dehydrogenase leakage (4.Wang G.W. Kang Y.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 288: 938-944PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, DOX-induced lipid peroxidation, a measure of DOX-induced oxidative injury, was significantly inhibited in these transgenic myocytes (4.Wang G.W. Kang Y.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 288: 938-944PubMed Google Scholar). This cell culture system thus provides a useful tool to dissect the events of DOX-induced myocardial injury. In particular, the purity of the primary cultures was found to be about 95% cardiomyocytes, assessed by an immunocytochemical assay (19.Wang G.W. Schuschke D.A. Kang Y.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: H167-H175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both qualitative and quantitative studies of DOX-induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes can be performed by using this unique experimental model. In the present study, we employed the cardiac-specific MT-overexpressing transgenic mice and cardiomyocyte cultures isolated from these mice to determine the effect of MT on DOX-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we examined whether activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is involved in the DOX-induced apoptosis and the effect of MT on this pathway. The results obtained demonstrate that DOX indeed induces apoptosis in the cardiomyocytes and MT inhibition of the apoptotic effect is mediated at least in part by inhibition of p38 MAPK activation. Eagle's minimum essential medium, fetal bovine serum and trypsin were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay reagents were obtained from Pierce. DOX and monoclonal anti-α-sarcomeric actin antibody were obtained from Sigma. ApopTag in situ apoptosis detection kit (S7101 kit) was purchased from Oncor (Gaithersburg, MD). Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (6693KK) was obtained from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse IgM, peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin, and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). SB203580, a competitive inhibitor of p38 MAPK, was obtained from Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA. 109CdCl2 was the product of NEN Life Science Products, and [γ-32P]ATP (4000 Ci/mmol) was from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). All other chemicals were purchased from either Fisher, Sigma, or Aldrich. The purity of all reagents was at least analytical grade. FVB mice obtained from the University of Louisville Research Resources Center were housed in the animal quarters maintained at 22 °C with a 12-h light/dark cycle. They were given free access to rodent chow and deionized water. Cardiac-specific MT-overexpressing transgenic mice were produced from the FVB strain. Detailed descriptions for development and characterization of these transgenic mouse lines were reported previously (3.Kang Y.J. Chen Y., Yu, A. Voss-McCowan M. Epstein P.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1501-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). These animals were maintained under the same conditions as described above. The transgenic founder mice were bred with non-transgenic mice of the same strain. The resultant litters were identified by a pigment marker (dark eye and fur) at birth. This pigment transgene was co-injected with the MT transgene into the early embryo when the transgenic mice were produced. Both transgenic positive and negative neonatal mouse littermates were used for experiments. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, which is certified by the American Association of Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. A new procedure for culturing ventricular cardiomyocytes from neonatal mice was described previously (19.Wang G.W. Schuschke D.A. Kang Y.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: H167-H175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1–3-day-old neonatal transgenic or nontransgenic mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Hearts were removed aseptically (retaining the ventricles only) and kept in cold Hanks' buffered saline solution without Ca2+ and Mg2+. The ventricles were washed with the same Hanks' buffered saline solution and minced into small fragments. Cardiac cells were dissociated with a trypsin solution and obtained by centrifugation. To exclude non-muscle cells, the isolated cells were first plated in tissue culture dishes at 37 °C for 2 h under a water-saturated atmosphere of 5% CO2 with 95% air (19.Wang G.W. Schuschke D.A. Kang Y.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: H167-H175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The suspended cells (myocytes) were then collected and plated at a density of 1.0 × 105 cells/cm2 in 100-mm culture dishes or on glass coverslips, and incubated under the same conditions as above. Myocyte purity was monitored by staining with antibody to cardiac-sarcomeric actin according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma) and was found to be averaged 94 ± 5% when examined at 48 h after culturing. Total MT was determined by a cadmium-hemoglobin affinity assay (20.Eaton D.L. Cherian M.G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 205: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). MT concentrations in myocardial tissues were measured as described previously (3.Kang Y.J. Chen Y., Yu, A. Voss-McCowan M. Epstein P.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1501-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). MT concentrations in cultured myocytes were measured from cells that were cultured for 3 or 4 days and before being exposed to DOX. The cells were rinsed with 5 ml of cold PBS and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min, and to the pellet, 500 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl was added. The cells were then pulse-sonicated on ice with a dismembrator (model 60, Fisher Scientific Inc.) at an output power of 8 for 15 s, and repeated three times with a 30-s interval. Following centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min, 200 μl of supernatant was transferred to microtubes for MT analysis following the procedure described previously (20.Eaton D.L. Cherian M.G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 205: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and another 100 μl of supernatant was transferred to separate microtubes for total protein determination using the Pierce BCA protein assay reagents (21.Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Proverzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klerk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18510) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The hearts removed from DOX- and saline-treated mice were fixed in 10% formalin in 0.01 m phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.3, for 24 h and embedded in paraplast. Tissue blocks were sectioned at a thickness of 5 μm and mounted on silanized slides. The slides obtained were processed for a TUNEL assay to detect fragmented nuclei in the myocardium. An ApopTagin situ detection kit was used according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, the slides were pretreated with H2O2 and incubated with the reaction mixture containing TdT and digoxigenin-conjugated dUTP for 1 h at 37 °C. Labeled DNA was visualized with peroxidase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody with 3,3′-diaminobenzidene as the chromagen. Rat mammary gland tissue provided in the kit was used as positive control. For negative control, TdT was routinely omitted from the reaction mixture. After the TUNEL staining, some of the tissue sections were processed for α-sarcomeric actin localization with an immunoperoxidase method. Sections were incubated with monoclonal anti-α-sarcomeric actin (clone 5C5, Isotype mouse IgM, Sigma) overnight at 4 °C, then with biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse IgM, followed by streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase incubation. A red color chromagen of new fuchsin was used to visualize the binding sites. Heart tissue taken from the free wall of left ventricles was cut into about 1-mm3. The samples were fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, for 2 h at 4 °C and routinely osmicated in 1% osmium tetroxide. After dehydration with ethanol, the samples were embedded in LR White resin. Ultrathin sections were obtained using a LKB ultratome and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. A Philip transmission electron microscope was used for observation. In addition to morphological examination, a procedure for detection of fragmented DNA by immunogold electron microscopy was applied. Ultrathin sections were cut on a LKB ultratome and collected on gold grids. The fragmented DNA on the ultrathin sections were labeled basically with the ApopTag kit with some modulations. Briefly, the ultrathin sections were incubated with working solution of TdT at 37 °C with different concentrations (up to 10 times dilution) and incubation time (10–60 min). The reaction was terminated by rinsing in SSC for 15 min. After rinsing in immunogold buffer (0.01 m PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween, and 0.1% Na3N, pH 8.2), the ultrathin sections were incubated with 10-nm gold conjugated sheep anti-digoxigenin (BBInternational, Cardiff, United Kingdom) diluted 1:30 in immunogold buffer. The ultrathin sections were then rinsed in distilled water and counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The labeled ultrathin sections were observed with a Philip transmission electron microscope. Negative controls were performed by omitting the TdT enzyme. Cardiomyocytes cultured on glass coverslips were washed with PBS and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and post-fixed in pre-cooled ethanol:acetic acid (2:1) for another 5 min at −20 °C. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with the TUNEL reaction mixture for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. As a positive control, cells were treated with DNase I (1 μg/ml, Sigma) for 10 min to introduce nicks in the genomic DNA. The percentage of myocytes with DNA nick end labeling was determined by counting cells exhibiting brown nuclei (TUNEL-positive) among 10,000 nuclei in triplicate plates. To confirm the TUNEL observation of apoptotic cardiomyocytes in cultures, annexin V-FITC binding was determined by confocal microcopy. Cells undergoing apoptosis lose plasma membrane asymmetry and phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) is translocated from the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane to the outer leaflet, thereby exposing PS to the external environment. Annexin V is a Ca2+-dependent phospholipid-binding protein that has a high affinity for PS, and is useful for identifying apoptotic cells with exposed PS. Cells that are stained positive for annexin V-FITC are in the early stages of apoptosis. This assay was performed on cardiomyocytes that had been cultured on glass coverslips. The cells were washed with proprietary binding buffer and stained with FITC-conjugated annexin V for 10 min. The samples were then optically sectioned with a Genomic Solutions confocal microscopy system equipped with a Nikon microscope. Cardiomyocytes cultured on glass coverslips were treated with DOX after the cells were incubated for 72 h. At different time points after the treatment, the culture slips were washed with PBS and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C. The fixed cells on the slips were then washed twice with Kreb's Ringer's phosphate buffer and permeabilized in 0.2% saponin for 1.0 h, and washed and incubated in an FITC-conjugated monoclonal anti-phospho-p38 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 1 h. Controls for nonspecific antibody binding as well as peptide inhibition with relevant protein were performed. Samples were optically sectioned with the confocal microscopy system. An immune complex kinase assay using ATF2 as substrate was applied to measure the p38 MAPK activity, as described previously (22.Rane M.J. Carrithers S.L. Arthur J.M. Klein J.B. McLeish K.R. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5070-5078PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the hearts were homogenized with 1:9 (w/v) 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) and the homogenate was briefly centrifuged. The supernatant was treated with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.0), 1% Triton, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 0.2 mmNaVO3, 1.0 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) on ice and centrifuged at 15,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C. Samples thus obtained were incubated with anti-p38 antisera for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads (15 μl of a 1:1 slurry in RIPA/EDTA) were added to the homogenate and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C to precipitate the immune complexes. Samples were centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 2 min and the beads were washed once in RIPA/EDTA and twice in PAN (10 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 0.09 unit/ml aprotinin, and 100 mm NaCl). The kinase assay was initiated by the addition of 40 μl of PAN containing 30 μm[γ-32P]ATP (10 Ci/mmol) and 1 μg of recombinant fragment of ATF2 encoding amino acids. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, then terminated by the addition of 15 μl of 5× Laemmli's SDS sample buffer. Samples were boiled, briefly centrifuged, and the products were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The incorporation of 32P was visualized by autoradiography and quantified by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics Inc.). Data were analyzed initially by one-way analysis of variance. Scheffe's F test was employed for further determination of the significance of differences. Differences between MT overexpressing transgenic cardiomyocytes and non-transgenic controls were considered significant atp < 0.05. The data are presented as mean ± S.D. values from triplicate samples for each treatment. Both cardiac-specific MT-overexpressing transgenic mice and non-transgenic littermates were treated intraperitoneally with DOX at a single dose of 15 mg/kg. Four days after the treatment, these animals were sacrificed, and the hearts were removed and subjected to measurement of MT concentrations and processing for detection of apoptosis by a TUNEL assay. The MT concentrations were 120.5 ± 6.8 and 5.6 ± 0.8 μg/g tissue in transgenic and non-transgenic hearts, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1, a significant number of cardiac cells in the DOX-treated non-transgenic myocardium were TUNEL-positive. In contrast, the number of TUNEL-positive cells was significantly reduced in the DOX-treated transgenic mouse hearts. To identify whether apoptosis determined by the TUNEL assay occurred in myocytes, a dual immunohistochemical staining for cardiac α-sarcomeric actin was performed. As also shown in Fig. 1, most of the TUNEL-positive cells were reactive to the monoclonal anti-α-sarcomeric actin antibody, demonstrating that these cells are of myocyte origin. To confirm the TUNEL result, an electron microscopic examination of the myocardium was performed. The results shown in Fig.2 demonstrate that DOX induced dramatic morphological changes. Nuclear chromatin margination with many condensed pieces of coarse chromatin clumping was observed. A majority of cells displayed nuclear changes without obvious mitochondrial structure alterations (Fig. 2 C), although mitochondrial cristae disappearance and membrane disruption occurred in some cells (Fig. 2 C). However, in all events, the plasma membrane structure was preserved. These morphological changes demonstrate typical myocardial apoptosis. More importantly, immunogold staining of condensed nuclei provided further confirmation of cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Myocytes with these changes in the DOX-treated non-transgenic hearts were easily identified. In contrast to these findings, the chromatin was distributed homogeneously within the nucleus and mild mitochondrial morphological changes were seldom observed in the DOX-treated MT-overexpressing transgenic mouse heart. The immunogold TUNEL staining of myocytes in the transgenic myocadium was negative (Fig. 2 F). Therefore, there were no severe morphological alterations or characteristic changes that indicate myocyte apoptosis in the DOX-treated MT-overexpressing mouse heart.Figure 2Electron microscopic examination of morphological changes and immunogold staining of apoptotic nuclei in myocytes. A, non-transgenic mouse myocardium, negative control (without TdT enzyme). No gold particles were found in either cytoplasm or nucleus. B, non-transgenic myocardium treated with saline as control.

A time-course study was also performed by exposing the cells to 1.0 μm for different times. The same TUNEL assay used for detecting apoptosis in vivo was applied to identify apoptotic cells in cultures. As shown in Fig.3, a small number of cells underwent apoptosis spontaneously and substantial numbers of cells were TUNEL-positive in the DOX-treated non-transgenic myocyte cultures. A concentration-dependent apoptotic effect of DOX was observed. After a 6-h exposure, DOX at its final concentrations above 0.1 μm in the cultures significantly induced apoptosis. About one-third of the total populations of cultured cardiomyocytes underwent the apoptotic process in the cultures containing 1.0 μm DOX. The time course study revealed that 1 h after the cultures were treated with 1.0 μm DOX, some cells traversed the apoptotic process, but the numbers of these cells were not statistically significantly different from those of spontaneous apoptotic cells. The number of apoptotic cells was significantly increased 3 h after the treatment and continued to increase as the exposure time increased. Both of the concentration- and time-dependent apoptotic effects were dramatically inhibited in the transgenic myocytes, about 50% inhibition was observed (Fig. 3). To confirm the results obtained from the TUNEL assay, a more apoptotic-sensitive and early detection method, annexin V-FITC staining and confocal microscopy, was used. The results presented in Fig. 4 show the time-course studies of the cells exposed to 1.0 μm DOX. The annexin V-positive cells were detected as early as 30 min after DOX exposure. The number of annexin V-FITC-positive cells in the DOX-treated non-transgenic myocyte cultures at any of the time points was much greater than in the DOX-treated transgenic cell cultures, which was in agreement with the results obtained from the TUNEL assay.Figure 4Detection of apoptosis in cardiomyocyte cultures by annexin V-FITC staining. Cells were treated with 1.0 μm DOX for varying time periods as indicated. Procedures for annexin V-FITC staining and confocal microscopic examination of positive cells were described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) MAPKs, such as p38, have been shown to be involved in oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes (23.Wang Y. Huang S. Sah V.P. Ross Jr., J. Brown J.H. Han J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2161-2168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Because DOX-induced cardiotoxicity is mediated at least in part by reactive oxygen species and DOX induces lipid peroxidation in the cultured neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes (4.Wang G.W. Kang Y.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 288: 938-944PubMed Google Scholar), it is interesting to determine whether DOX also activates the p38 MAPK pathway in the myocytes. We employed a rather sensitive detection method to determine DOX-induced activation of p38 MAPK. This method uses an FITC-conjugated monoclonal anti-phospho-p38 antibody to recognize the activated form of p38 MAPK (phospho-p38). As shown in Fig. 5, DOX indeed activated p38 MAPK in the non-transgenic cardiomyocytes. This activation was time-dependent. The earliest detection of p38 MAPK activation was 5 min after the cells were treated with 1.0 μm DOX. A remarkable activation was observed at 20 min, and a maximum one was achieved 30 min after the treatment. Surprisingly, it was observed that the FITC/confocal microscopy-detected p38 MAPK activation in the DOX-treated transgenic myocytes was almost completely undetectable (Fig. 5). To demonstrate the effect of MT on DOX-induced p38 MAPK activationin vivo, an immune complex kinase assay using ATF-2 as substrate was performed. Both transgenic and non-transgenic control mice were treated with DOX for 12 h before the hearts were collected for the assay. The result shown in Fig.6 demonstrates that DOX significantly increased p38 MAPK activity in vivo and MT almost completely suppressed this activation. The results obtained above suggest that p38 MAPK is a mediator of DOX-induced apoptosis and MT inhibits the apoptotic effect through inhibition of p38 MAPK activation. To demonstrate this"

As part of our continuing effort to identify cofactors that influence the transcriptional activity of PPARs, we now report the isolation of a novel coactivator from mouse, designated PRIP (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptorinteracting protein), a nuclear protein with 2068 amino acids and encoded by 13 exons. Northern analysis showed that PRIP mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues of adult mice. PRIP contains two LXXLL signature motifs. The amino-terminal LXXLL motif (amino acid position 892 to 896) of PRIP was found to be necessary for nuclear receptor interaction, but the second LXXLL motif (amino acid position 1496 to 1500) appeared unable to bind PPARγ. Deletion of the last 12 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of PPARγ resulted in the abolition of the interaction between PRIP and PPARγ. PRIP also binds to PPARα, RARα, RXRα, ER, and TRβ1, and this binding is increased in the presence of specific ligands. PRIP acts as a strong coactivator for PPARγ in the yeast and also potentiates the transcriptional activities of PPARγ and RXRα in mammalian cells.

These PPAR isotypes appear to exhibit distinct patterns of tissue distribution and differ considerably in their ligand-binding domains, implying that they possibly perform different functions in different cell types (5.Dreyer C.

Of the three isotypes, PPARα expression is relatively high in hepatocytes, enterocytes, and the proximal tubular epithelium of kidney when compared with other cell types (8.Braissant O. Foufelle F. Scotto C. Dauca M. Wahli W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar), and evidence derived from mice with PPARα gene disruption indicates that this receptor is essential for the pleiotropic responses induced by peroxisome proliferators (10.Lee S.S.-T.

Also worth noting is that the fatty acyl-CoA oxidase, the first and the rate-limiting enzyme of the peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation system, plays a critical role in the metabolism of biological/natural ligands of PPARα in that mice with fatty acyl-CoA oxidase gene disruption exhibit sustained spontaneous up-regulation of PPARα-responsive genes (11.Fan C-Y.

Although a great deal is known about genes regulated by PPARα, especially in conjunction with peroxisome proliferator-induced pleiotropic responses (2.Chu R. Reddy J.K. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Evidence accumulated so far indicates that the transcriptional activation of nuclear receptors after ligand binding involves the participation of cofactors termed nuclear receptor corepressors and coactivators (18.Xu L. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 19.Qi C. Zhu Y. Reddy J.K. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 32: 187-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The current model suggests that unliganded receptors are maintained in a repressed state by nuclear receptor corepressors such as N-CoR (20.Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar) and SMRT (21.Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, the corepressor(s) dissociates from the nuclear receptor, thus enabling the liganded nuclear receptor to recruit a complex of proteins, called nuclear receptor coactivators, that bridge the nuclear receptors with basal transcription machinery (18.Xu L.

Alternative strategies that focused on the identification and purification of the putative transcriptional complexes yielded valuable information regarding the transcriptional activation of thyroid hormone receptor (TR), vitamin D receptor, and other transcriptional units (41.Yuan C.X.

Likewise, multiple protein complexes such as DRIP (vitamin D3 receptor interacting protein) and ARC (activator-recruited cofactor) are identified and found to be required for the transcriptional activation of multiple transcription factors including SP1, p53, NF-κB, vp16, and nuclear receptors (43.Rachez C.

It is of special interest that this complex acts on the nuclear receptors by binding to PBP (PPARBP), a nuclear receptor coactivator we originally identified as a coactivator for PPAR (34.Zhu Y. Qi C. Jain S. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25500-25506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). More recently, we demonstrated that the PBP gene (PPARBP) is overexpressed in about 50% of breast cancers examined, and the PBP gene amplification was noted in about 25% of breast tumors (45.Zhu Y. Qi C. Jain S. Le Beau M.M. Espinosa III R. Atkins G.B. Lazar M.A. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10848-10853Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These observations underscore the importance of nuclear receptor coactivators in transcriptional activation and also point to their possible role in neoplastic conversion. Here we report the characterization of a new nuclear receptor coactivator, designated PRIP identified during yeast two-hybrid screening. PRIP contains two LXXLL signature motifs at amino acid positions 892–896 and 1496–1500, but the latter motif did not appear necessary for binding to PPARγ. PRIP acts as a strong coactivator for PPARγ in yeast and also potentiates transcriptional activities of PPARγ and RXRα in mammalian cells. We further show that a truncated form of PRIP (amino acids 786–1132) functions as a dominant-negative repressor, suggesting that PRIP is a genuine coactivator. GAL4-PPARγ, GAL4-PPARγΔ12, GST-PPARγ, GST-RXRα, PCMV-PPARγ, PPRE-LUC, and pSV-sport-PPARα, as well as the vectors for in vitro translation of RARα, TRβ1, and ER, have been described elsewhere (34.Zhu Y. Qi C. Jain S. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25500-25506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). PCMX-RXRα and RXRE-TK-LUC were provided by Dr. R. Evans (Salk Institute). PCMV-PRIP was constructed by inserting the full-length coding region of PRIP cDNA into the HindIII/XbaI site of PCDNA 3.1(+) (Invitrogen). PCMV-PRIP-HA was made by inserting full-length PRIP cDNA with two HA epitopes at the carboxyl terminus into theHindIII site of PCDNA 3.1(+). PGADH10-PRIP was generated by inserting the full-length PRIP cDNA into the HindIII site of PGADH10. The PFLAG-PRIP-T and GST-PRIP were generated by subcloning the fragment released from PGADH10-PRIPT clone isolated by the yeast two-hybrid screening into the EcoRI site of a modified PCMV-FLAG2 containing a nuclear targeting signal peptide PKKKRKV and PGEX-5X-2, respectively. A partial cDNA encoding a peptide that interacts with PPARγ was isolated by yeast two-hybrid screening of a mouse liver cDNA library as described previously (24.Zhu Y. Qi C. Calandra C. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Gene Expr. 1996; 6: 185-195PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Zhu Y. Qi C. Jain S. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25500-25506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). We then obtained the full-length cDNA from a λZAP newborn mouse kidney cDNA library with RACE PCR using a kit from Life Technologies, Inc. according to the manufacturer's protocol. The PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T (Promega), and three independent clones were sequenced. The full-length cDNA that we cloned has been designated PRIP, or peroxisome proliferator activated receptor interactingprotein to reflect its ability to bind PPARs and to distinguish it from PBP (PPARBP), which we cloned earlier (34.Zhu Y. Qi C. Jain S. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25500-25506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Mouse multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) containing 2 μg of poly(A) RNA in each lane was probed with 32P-labeled PRIP full-length cDNA according to the conditions outlined by the manufacturer. By screening a BAC mouse library (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO) with PCR primers 5′-AGAGAATGCCCGTGCAGCAG-3′ and 5′-TTGCTGGGGAGTTGCACCTT-3′, one BAC clone (#21803) containing the PRIP gene was obtained. The BAC clone was digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and subcloned as necessary. The intron sizes and exon/intron boundaries were determined by Southern blotting, restriction enzyme mapping, PCR, sequencing, and a comparison of sequences between the cDNA and genomic DNA. Appropriate plasmids were cotransformed into yeast HF7C, plated on selective media plates in the presence or absence of 10−5m BRL49653, a PPARγ ligand, and then incubated for 4 days at 30 °C. For each assay, five colonies were suspended in 150 μl of buffer Z (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 35 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). Equal number of cells in suspension was pelleted by centrifugation, and β-galactosidase activity was determined by a chemiluminescent reporter protocol (Galacto-light kit, Tropix, Bedford, MA). The GST alone and GST-fusion proteins GST-PRIP, GST-RXRα, GST-RARα, and GST-PPARγ were produced inEscherichia coli DH5α and bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In vitro translation was performed using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) and [35S]methionine. In a GST pull-down assay, a 10-μl aliquot of GST fusion protein loaded on glutathione-Sepharose beads was incubated with 5 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro translated proteins for 2 h in 600 μl of NETN (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.7 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The binding was assayed in the presence or absence specific ligands: BRL49653 (1 × 10−5m) for PPARγ, 9-cis-retinoic acid (1 × 10−6m) for RXRα and RARα, Wy-14, 643 (1 × 10−5m) for PPARα, T3 (1 × 10−6m) for TRβ1, and β-estrogen (1 × 10−6m) for ER, respectively. Bound proteins were washed three times with binding buffer, eluted by boiling for 2 min in 20 μl of SDS sample buffer, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and autoradiographed. EBNA cells (293) were transfected with pcDNA3.1-HA-PRIP, PFLAG-PRIP-T, or PFLAG-PRIP-M2 along with PCMV-PPARγ by the calcium precipitation method. 24 h after transfection, the cell was harvested. The lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-PPARγ or control serum. The precipitates were resolved on SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis. CV-1 cells (1 × 105) were plated in six-well plates and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h before transfection. Cells were transfected for 5 h with 1.25 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid DNA, 0.75 μg of the appropriate expression plasmid DNA, and 0.5 μg of β-galactosidase expression vector pCMVβ (CLONTECH) DNA using theN-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N,-trimethylammonium methylsufate-mediated transfection method (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell extracts were prepared 36 h after transfection and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. (Tropix). For immunofluorescence localization, COS-1 cells were fixed in ice-cold methanol for 5 min and washed twice with Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmKCl). After incubating with antibody for 1 h at 27 °C, cells were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline, and mounted with a Prolong anti-fade kit (Molecular Probes). Using the PPARγ ligand-binding domain as a bait in the yeast two-hybrid system, we isolated from a mouse liver cDNA library a partial cDNA encoding a PPAR-interacting protein, designated PRIP. The full-length PRIP cDNA was cloned through RACE PCR. It has an open reading frame of 6204 nucleotides that encodes a protein of 2068 amino acids (Fig.1) with an estimated molecular mass of ∼ 220 kDa. It contains two LXXLL motifs that have been shown to be essential for transcriptional coactivators to interact with nuclear receptors (26.Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar, 36.Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). One motif is at amino acid positions 892–896, and the second is located at amino acid positions 1496–1500. The PRIP cDNA fragment directly recovered by yeast two-hybrid screening encodes amino acids 786–1132 and contains the first LXXLL motif. When the amino acid sequence of PRIP was compared with known sequences in GeneBankTM, it showed 96% homology to KIAA0181 except that the first 58 amino acids were missing in the KIAA0181 cDNA. The KIAA0181 cDNA was isolated from human myeloid KG-1 cells (46.Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K. Tanaka A. Nomura N. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The function of this protein has not been investigated. Mouse PRIP contains a stretch of 31 glutamine residues from amino acids Glu261-Glu291, whereas its human homologue has 25 contiguous glutamines. The PRIP was expressed as an 8.5-kb transcript in all tissues examined including blood, spleen, prostate, thymus, colon, testis, ovary (Fig.2), liver, and kidney, among others (data not shown). A high level of expression of PRIP mRNA has been noted in the testis. A second ∼4-kb transcript is detected in the testis, which may represent an isoform for PRIP. Transfection of a plasmid containing two HA epitopes linked to the carboxyl-terminal portion of PRIP protein into COS-1 cells revealed the nuclear localization of the expressed PRIP protein (Fig. 3).Figure 2Northern blot analysis of PRIP mRNA.A mouse multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) containing 2 μg of poly(A) RNA for each tissue was probed with32P-labeled full-length PRIP cDNA and then exposed to film at −80 °C with intensifier screens for 24 h. The transcript size of PRIP is ∼8.5 kb in all tissues examined. An additional ∼4-kb transcript is present in the testis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Immunofluorescence localization of transiently expressed PRIP in COS-1 cells.

One clone covered the entire PRIP gene. The size of the introns and the exon/intron boundaries were determined by XL-PCR and by sequencing. The PRIP gene consists of 13 exons and spans about 47.5 kb (Table I). Similar to the gene structures of mSRC-1 and PBP-1, about half of the PRIP cDNA is encoded by a single large exon (exon 9). The sequences of all of the splice acceptor and donor sequences conformed to the GT-AG consensus rule for splicing (47.Breathnach R. Bednoist C. O'Hare K. Gannon F. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

https://openalex.org/W2144409619,"To identify the signaling pathway that mediates the adrenergic stimulation of the expression of the gene for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) during physiologically induced angiogenesis, we examined mouse brown adipocytes in primary culture. The endogenous adrenergic neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) induced VEGF expression 3-fold, in a dose- and time-dependent manner (EC50 ≈ 90 nm). Also, the hypoxia-mimicking agent cobalt, as well as serum and phorbol ester, induced VEGF expression, but the effect of NE was additive to each of these factors, implying that a separate signaling mechanism for the NE-mediated induction was activated. The NE effect was abolished by propranolol and mimicked by isoprenaline or BRL-37344 and was thus mediated via β-adrenoreceptors. The NE-induced VEGF expression was fully cAMP mediated, an effect which was inhibited by H-89 and thus was dependent on protein kinase A activity. Involvement of other adrenergic signaling pathways (α1-adrenoreceptors, Ca2+, protein kinase C, α2-adrenoreceptors, and pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi-proteins) was excluded. The specific inhibitor of Src tyrosine kinases, PP2, markedly reduced the stimulation by NE, which demonstrates that a cAMP-dependent Src-mediated pathway is positively connected to VEGF expression. However, inhibition of Erk1/2 MAP kinases by PD98059 was without effect. NE did not prolong VEGF mRNA half-life and its effect was thus transcriptional, and was independent of protein synthesis. These results demonstrate that adrenergic stimulation, through β-adrenoreceptor/cAMP/protein kinase A signaling, recruits a pathway that branches off from the NE-activated Src-Erk1/2 cascade to enhance transcription of the VEGF gene.

In this tissue, norepinephrine (NE),1 the adrenergic mediator in sympathetic nerves, is the acute inducer of thermogenesis (1.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). During the thermogenic process, the rate of lipid oxidation in this tissue, and thus the demand for oxygen delivery to the tissue, is immense. Heat production in brown adipose tissue accounts for nearly half of the total energy expenditure in a cold-acclimated animal in the cold, even though the tissue only constitutes 1–2% of the total body weight (2.Foster D.O. Frydman M.L. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1978; 56: 110-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 3.Foster D.O. Frydman M.L. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1979; 57: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The blood supply needed to support the oxygen requirement under such conditions is necessarily exceedingly high (2.Foster D.O. Frydman M.L. Can. J. Physiol.

Physiol. 1982; 242: E353-E359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of this angiogenesis in brown adipose tissue has so far not been extensively investigated. Expression of the angiogenic factor basic fibroblast growth factor, is induced in the tissue by cold exposure (5.Yamashita H. Sato Y. Kizaki T. Oh-ishi S. Nagasawa J. Ohno H. Pflügers Arch. 1994; 428: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and by NE in cultured brown adipocytes (6.Yamashita H. Sato N. Kizaki T. Oh-ishi S. Segawa M. Saitoh D. Ohira Y. Ohno H. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1457-1462PubMed Google Scholar). The VEGF-related factor (vascular endothelial growth factor-B) is expressed already during development (7.Lagercrantz J. Larsson C. Grimmond S. Fredriksson M. Weber G. Piehl F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and expression of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor (8.Ferrara N. Henzel W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 161: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2023) Google Scholar)) itself is induced by NE administration and cold exposure in brown adipose tissue (9.Asano A. Morimatsu M. Nikami H. Yoshida T. Saito M. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and VEGF expression and secretion is stimulated by NE in cultured brown adipocytes (10.Fredriksson J.M.

Thus, NE appears to mediate cold-induced angiogenesis in brown adipose tissue by stimulating the expression of angiogenic factors, such as VEGF. In this respect, the effect of NE may be connected to the general recruitment effect of NE in this tissue, i.e. increased DNA synthesis (6.Yamashita H. Sato N. Kizaki T. Oh-ishi S. Segawa M.

The aim of the present investigation was to clarify through which intracellular signaling mechanisms NE stimulates expression of the VEGF gene. We conclude that NE-induced VEGF expression was exclusively dependent on a β-adrenoreceptor-mediated increase in cAMP levels and PKA activity. The mediation involved Src tyrosine kinases, unexpectedly and completely independently of downstream mediation via Erk1/2 MAP kinases. We thus demonstrate a positive connection between VEGF expression and a signaling pathway that branches off from the NE-activated Src-Erk1/2 cascade. Brown adipocyte precursors were isolated from 3–4-week-old mice of the NMRI strain, obtained from a local supplier (Eklunds), principally as described by Néchad et al. (19.Néchad M. Kuusela P. Carneheim C. Björntorp P. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Exp. Cell Res. 1983; 149: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and modified by Bronnikov et al. (14.Bronnikov G. Houstek J. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2006-2013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cervical, interscapular, and axillary brown adipose tissue depots were dissected out from each mouse. The depots were pooled and incubated in the Hepes-buffered Ringer solution detailed by Néchad et al. (19.Néchad M. Kuusela P. Carneheim C. Björntorp P. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Exp. Cell Res. 1983; 149: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), containing 0.2% (w/v) crude collagenase type II (Sigma). The tissue was digested for 30 min at 37 °C, with vortexing every 5 min, after which the digest was filtered through a 250-μm nylon screen. To allow lipid droplets and mature adipocytes to float, the digest was put on ice for 20 min, and the infranatant was then collected and filtered through a 25-μm nylon screen. The cells in the filtrate were pelleted by centrifugation, suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and repelleted, after which they were suspended in culture medium and used for cell culture. The cells were cultured either in Costar 6-well plates (growth area 9.4 cm2 per well, with cells obtained from 2.5 animals inoculated per plate in 2 ml of culture medium per well) or in Costar 12-well plates (growth area 3.83 cm2 per well, with cells obtained from 2 animals inoculated per plate in 1 ml of culture medium per well). The culture medium consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (routinely Life Technologies, Inc., without l-glutamine with 4 nm l-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) added), supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum (PAN Systems), 4 nm insulin (Actrapid Human, Novo), 10 mm Hepes (Life Technologies, Inc.), and with 50 IU penicillin, 50 μg of streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 25 μg of sodium ascorbate (Kebo) per ml, at 37 °C in a water-saturated atmosphere of 8% CO2 in air in a Heraeus CO2 auto-zero B5061 incubator. On day 1, the cultures were washed with prewarmed Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and fresh prewarmed medium was then added. Medium was then changed every other day until the day of experimentation, which was routinely day 6. Cultures under serum-free conditions were cultured for 5–6 days in the above medium, after which they were washed and the same culture medium as described above, without newborn calf serum, but with 0.5% (w/v) albumin (fraction V, fatty acid free; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) added. The experiments were performed after approximately 20 h in this medium. On the indicated day of culture (day 6 if not otherwise indicated) and after stimulation, the culture medium was discarded and the cells were dissolved in 0.8 ml of an Ultraspec solution (Biotecx), and the manufacturer's procedure for RNA isolation was followed. The RNA concentration was measured on a Beckman DU 50 spectrophotometer with readings at 260 and 280 nm; the 260/280 nm ratio was routinely 1.7–1.8. 10 μg of total RNA was separated by electrophoresis in an ethidium bromide-containing agarose-formaldehyde gel, as described by Bronnikov et al. (20.Bronnikov G. Bengtsson T. Kramarova L. Golozoubova V. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4185-4197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The intensity of the 18 S and 28 S rRNA bands under UV light was routinely checked to verify that all samples were equally loaded and that no RNA degradation had occurred. The RNA was blotted overnight from the gel to a Hybond-N membrane, cross-linked, and hybridized as described by Bronnikov et al. (20.Bronnikov G. Bengtsson T. Kramarova L. Golozoubova V. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4185-4197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Hybond-N membrane was then washed three times in 0.1 × SSC, 0.2% SDS at 50 °C for 20 min. The membrane was sealed in a plastic envelope and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen for 1 day. The screen was analyzed on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and the overall VEGF mRNA signal was quantified with the ImageQuant program. When the same Hybond-N membrane was analyzed for both VEGF and UCP1 mRNA, the previous probe was removed by putting the membrane in 0.2% SDS solution at 100 °C and allowing this solution to cool down to room temperature. The VEGF cDNA was a gift from Dr. Georg Breier, Max-Planck Institute, Bad Nauheim, Germany. It contained the 580-base pair mouse VEGF164 cDNA, which encodes the VEGF164 isoform (21.Breier G. Albrecht U. Sterrer S. Risau W. Development. 1992; 114: 521-532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This cDNA had been cloned into the EcoRI-BamHI cloning sites of a pBluescript KS vector. The vector was amplified by transformation of a TG-1Escherichia coli strain and the cDNA was isolated. The UCP1 cDNA was that earlier used (18.Rehnmark S. Néchad M. Herron D. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16464-16471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP with a Random Primed DNA Labeling Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), according to the manufacturer's instructions. On day 6 in culture and after stimulation, the culture medium was aspirated after the indicated time and the cells were treated principally as described by Bronnikov et al.(20.Bronnikov G. Bengtsson T. Kramarova L. Golozoubova V. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4185-4197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.8 ml of 75% ethanol with 1 mm EDTA was added to each well, and after 10 min, cells were harvested by scraping. Ethanol was removed by SpeedVac centrifugation and pellets were suspended in 0.5 ml of 4 × TE buffer and sonicated 5 s. After centrifugation, a 25-μl supernatant aliquot from each sample was used for determination of cAMP levels with the Cyclic AMP Assay System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), according to the manufacturer's instructions. On day 6 in culture and after stimulation, the culture medium was discarded and the cells were harvested and analyzed for Erk1/2 phosphorylation as described earlier (22.Lindquist J.M. Rehnmark S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30147-30156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were separated on 12% polyacrylamide gels. Electrotransfer to Hybond-C Extra nitrocellulose membranes (pore size 0.45 μm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was carried out in a semidry electroblotter. After transfer, the membranes were allowed to soak in Tris-buffered saline for 5 min followed by quenching (5% non-fat dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline) of nonspecific binding for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies, an Erk1/2 phosphospecific antibody (human Thr(P) 202/Tyr(P) 204; New England Biolabs) or an Erk1/2 antibody (New England Biolabs) overnight at 4 °C. The primary antibody was detected with a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (New England Biolabs) and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blots were exposed to Kodak X-Omat RP films and quantified on a Molecular Dynamics densitometer. Erk1/2 phosphorylation was routinely expressed as the ratio of phosphorylated Erk1/2 to total Erk1/2. The following chemicals were used: norepinephrine ((−)-arterenol bitartrate), dl-propranolol, prazosin, isoprenaline, clonidine, A23187, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), genistein, wortmannin, pertussis toxin, actinomycin D, cycloheximide, 8-bromo-cAMP, and forskolin (all from Sigma), CGP-12177 (CGP-12177A; Ciba-Geigy), BRL-37344 (SmithKline Beecham), cirazoline, and 1,9-dideoxy-forskolin (RBI), UK 14304 (Tocris Cookson), PD98059 (New England BioLabs), H-89 and PP2 (Calbiochem). Dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) was used to dissolve A23187, TPA, forskolin, PD98059, genistein, and PP2; final concentration per assay was maximally 0.5%. Ethanol (50%) was used to dissolve prazosin and actinomycin D; final concentration per assay was maximally 0.5%. To examine the regulation of VEGF expression in mouse brown adipocytes, we first investigated the ability of these cells to express the VEGF gene constitutively. Total RNA isolated from differentiated mouse brown adipocytes (on day 6 in culture) was analyzed by Northern blot analysis. The 580-base pair mouse VEGF164 cDNA probe (21.Breier G. Albrecht U. Sterrer S. Risau W. Development. 1992; 114: 521-532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used. On the Northern blot (Fig.1 A), a major band at approximately 4 kilobases was observed (top arrow), and 4 further bands at lower molecular weight were distinguishable on densitometric analysis. This Northern blot pattern was similar to that observed in other cells, tissues, and species (9.Asano A. Morimatsu M. Nikami H. Yoshida T. Saito M. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 21.Breier G. Albrecht U. Sterrer S. Risau W. Development. 1992; 114: 521-532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Berse B. Brown L.F.

J. 1997; 328: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). During the different treatments used in this study, the intensity of these bands varied in parallel, and the total signal was therefore that used for analysis. To investigate whether the expression of VEGF is a differentiation characteristic, we followed VEGF expression during cell differentiation. Brown adipocytes in primary culture proliferate until confluence is reached, which occurs at approximately day 5–6 after inoculation (14.Bronnikov G. Houstek J. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2006-2013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Néchad M. Kuusela P. Carneheim C. Björntorp P. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Exp. Cell Res. 1983; 149: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 20.Bronnikov G. Bengtsson T. Kramarova L. Golozoubova V. Cannon B. Nedergaard J.

Néchad M. Herron D. Nelson B.D. Obregon M.J. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 182: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). At this time, differentiation spontaneously occurs. This is verified in Fig. 1 B where the ability of NE to induce expression of the brown adipocyte-specific differentiation marker, mitochondrial uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1), is analyzed. As seen, rather high levels of UCP1 mRNA were induced by NE from day 5 (Fig. 1 B, black bars), indicating that brown adipocyte differentiation had occurred. As seen in Fig. 1 C(gray bars), VEGF was constitutively expressed already in undifferentiated cells, and basal VEGF mRNA levels were similar in all stages of differentiation. This is in contrast to VEGF expression observed in 3T3-F442A adipocytes, which was fully differentiation-dependent (27.Claffey K.P. Wilkison W.O. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16317-16322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the state of differentiation is not crucial for basal VEGF expression in brown adipocytes. To investigate the effect of NE on VEGF expression, we treated the cultures with NE for 1 h. VEGF mRNA levels increased approximately 3-fold after NE stimulation (Fig. 1 A, two rightmost lanes), which is in accordance with observations in cultured rat brown adipocytes (11.Tonello C. Giordano A. Cozzi V. Cinti S. Stock M.J. Carruba M.O. Nisoli E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The stimulation by NE was observed at all stages of brown adipocyte differentiation, from proliferating to fully differentiated cells, and was of similar relative magnitude (Fig.1 C, black bars). When brown adipocytes were stimulated with increasing concentrations of NE, VEGF mRNA levels increased monophasically, following simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics, to 4-fold control levels, obtained with 10 μm NE; the EC50 was 70 ± 22 nm (Fig. 2 A). Analysis of mean points from four similar experiments yielded a 3-fold increase, with similar kinetics; EC50 93 ± 27 nm (not shown). In the maintained presence of NE, the VEGF mRNA levels were elevated only during the first few hours and had returned to control levels after 6 h (Fig. 2 B). An independent experiment with 30 min NE stimulation of brown adipocytes resulted in only a 30% elevation of VEGF mRNA levels (not shown); thus maximum levels occurred at about 1 h of stimulation. The rapid disappearance of the mRNA signal in these experiments implies a short half-life of VEGF mRNA (see also below). This transient increase in expression is in principal agreement with the time course of VEGF expression induced in rat brown adipose tissue in situ by cold exposure: the expression peaked at 4 h, and had decreased down to control levels within 24 h (9.Asano A. Morimatsu M. Nikami H. Yoshida T. Saito M. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Based on these experiments, further experiments were performed with 10 μm NE and analyzed after 1 h of stimulation. As demonstrated above, NE is a potent inducer of VEGF expression in mouse brown adipocytes. In various other cell types, other factors such as hypoxia, cobalt (as a hypoxia-mimicking agent), serum, growth factors, and phorbol esters have been demonstrated to induce VEGF expression (27.Claffey K.P. Wilkison W.O. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16317-16322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Shweiki D. Itin A. Soffer D. Keshet E.

Chem. 1996; 271: 736-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). We have therefore investigated whether NE is an exclusive inducer of VEGF expression in brown adipocytes, or whether the classical factors mentioned above could induce expression also in these cells. These experiments may also reveal initial information on the intracellular pathway mediating the NE signal, as non-additivity between the NE-induced VEGF expression and that induced by other factors would imply distinct signaling pathways. The hypoxia-mimicking agent cobalt was not able to elevate VEGF expression after 1 h of treatment (not shown), but after 6 h, a 3-fold increase could be seen (Fig.3 A). The elevated VEGF mRNA levels persisted for at least 24 h (not shown). Thus, hypoxia is probably an inducer of VEGF expression also in brown adipocytes. The effect of NE was additive to that of cobalt (Fig.3 A). Thus, NE and hypoxia (cobalt treatment) utilize separate pathways for the induction of VEGF expression. To investigate the effect of serum factors, serum was removed from the brown adipocyte cultures. When readded the next day, serum induced VEGF expression 4-fold (Fig. 3 B). The effect of serum lasted longer than that of NE (>6 h; not shown). NE was able to induce VEGF expression, also in the absence of serum factors (Fig.3 B). The effect of NE was additive to that of serum (Fig.3 B), and thus the signaling pathway mediating the NE effect would also seem to be different from pathways utilized by serum factors. The phorbol ester TPA was also a potent inducer of VEGF expression (4-fold) (Fig. 3 C), implying that protein kinase C (PKC)-activated pathways can stimulate VEGF expression in brown adipocytes. NE gave a marked increase of VEGF mRNA in addition to that induced by TPA alone (Fig. 3 C). Thus, the pathway mediating the NE effect on VEGF expression appears not to involve PKC activation (see also below). Thus, also the classical inducers of VEGF expression, hypoxia (cobalt), serum, and phorbol ester, induced VEGF expression in brown adipocytes, but NE utilized a distinct signaling pathway. To investigate which adrenergic receptors mediate the NE effect on VEGF expression in brown adipocytes, adrenoreceptor agonists and antagonists were used (Fig.4 A). The α1-adrenoreceptor antagonist prazosin had no significant effect on NE-induced VEGF expression, but the β-adrenoreceptor antagonist propranolol completely abolished it. In accordance with this, the α1-adrenoreceptor agonist cirazoline had no inducing effect (Fig. 4 A), nor had the α2-adrenoreceptor agonists clonidine (10 μm) or UK14304 (10 μm) (not shown), whereas the β-adrenoreceptor agonist isoprenaline was an equally potent inducer as was NE (Fig. 4 C). Thus, only β-adrenoreceptors mediated the NE-induced VEGF expression. Proliferating brown preadipocytes only express the β1-adrenoreceptor subtype whereas fully differentiated brown adipocytes also express the β3-adrenoreceptor subtype which, at this stage of differentiation, is the only β-adrenoreceptor subtype coupled to adenylyl cyclase (20.Bronnikov G. Bengtsson T. Kramarova L. Golozoubova V. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4185-4197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the NE-induced VEGF expression observed in proliferating undifferentiated brown preadipocytes (days 3–4, Fig. 1 B) is most likely mediated by β1-adrenoreceptors. In differentiated brown adipocytes, the β3-adrenoreceptor agonist BRL-37344 induced VEGF expression to the same extent as did NE (not shown). The β3-adrenoreceptor agonist CGP-12177 (32.Mohell N. Dicker A. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) (which is a β1- and β2-adrenoreceptor antagonist) also induced VEGF expression in these cells (not shown). Thus, both β1- and β3-adrenoreceptors were able to mediate NE-induced VEGF expression in these cells, the coupling depending on the differentiation stage. To identify which second messengers had the ability to induce VEGF expression, we examined the intracellular second messenger systems involved in adrenoreceptor-mediated signaling: Ca2+ and PKC (from α1-adrenoreceptors), the proposed β3-adrenoreceptor/Gi-protein signaling pathway (33.Chaudhry A. Mackenzie R.G. Georgic L.M. Granneman J.G. Cell. Signal. 1994; 6: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and cAMP (from β-adrenoreceptors). The Ca2+ ionophore A23187, which increases intracellular Ca2+ levels and through this, e.g. induces c-fos expression (34.Thonberg H. Zhang S.-J. Tvrdik P. Jacobsson A. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33179-33186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), had no effect on VEGF mRNA levels (Fig. 4 A). Concerning PKC activation, it was shown above that the phorbol ester TPA induced a marked elevation of VEGF expression (Fig. 3 C), but it was concluded that the NE effect appeared to be independent of PKC, because of the additivity of the effects. To substantiate this, PKC was inactivated prior to NE stimulation, by prolonged exposure to TPA, a treatment that inactivates TPA-sensitive PKC isoforms (35.Stumpo D.J. Blackshear P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9453-9457Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 36.Borner C. Guadagno S.N. Fabbro D. Weinstein I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12892-12899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After TPA pretreatment, no remaining elevation of VEGF mRNA levels was observed (Fig.4 B), and the acute effect of TPA on VEGF mRNA levels was abolished (Fig. 4 B). Thus, TPA pretreatment effectively inactivated PKC. However, the NE-induced VEGF expression was not altered by TPA pretreatment (Fig. 4 B) and was thus not mediated through a TPA-sensitive PKC pathway. To investigate the possible involvement of the suggested cAMP-independent β3-adrenoreceptor signaling through pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G-proteins, i.e.Gi-proteins (33.Chaudhry A.

Here we investigated the presence and regulation of the AEA transporter in human umbelical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). HUVECs take up AEA by facilitated transport (apparent K m = 190 ± 10 nm and V max = 45 ± 3 pmol·min−1·mg−1 protein), which is inhibited by α-linolenoyl-vanillyl-amide andN-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-arachidonoylamide, and stimulated up to 2.2-fold by nitric oxide (NO) donors. The NO scavenger hydroxocobalamin abolishes the latter effect, which is instead enhanced by superoxide anions but inhibited by superoxide dismutase andN-acetylcysteine, a precursor of glutathione synthesis. Peroxynitrite (ONOO−) causes a 4-fold activation of AEA transport into cells. The HUVEC AEA transporter contributes to the termination of a typical type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1) -mediated action of AEA, i.e. the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase, because NO/ONOO−donors and α-linolenoyl-vanillyl-amide/N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-arachidonoylamide were found to attenuate and enhance, respectively, this effect of AEA. Consistently, activation of CB1 cannabinoid receptors by either AEA or the cannabinoid HU-210 caused a stimulation of HUVEC inducible NO synthase activity and expression up to 2.9- and 2.6-fold, respectively. Also these effects are regulated by the AEA transporter. HU-210 enhanced AEA uptake by HUVECs in a fashion sensitive to the NO synthase inhibitor Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester.

Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 521-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). In fact, AEA has been isolated and characterized as an endogenous ligand for both CB1 and, to a lesser extent, CB2 cannabinoid receptor subtypes, and has been shown to mimic the psychotropic, antiemetic, and analgesic effects of cannabinoids (3.Di Marzo V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1392: 153-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Recently, attention has been focused on the cardiovascular actions of AEA and their potential role in human shock conditions (4.Wagner J.A. Varga K. Kunos G. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 824-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In particular, a role for AEA has been proposed in both endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxations of vascular tissues, which involve several mechanisms including hyperpolarization of the smooth muscle cell membrane (5.Randall M.D. Alexander S.P.H.

A similar mechanism has been attributed in the past to a diffusible endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) different from nitric oxide (NO), whose chemical nature is still a matter of speculation (8.Mombouli J.-V.

Pharmacol. 1999; 126: 949-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and recent data strongly support the theory that EDHF is a cytochrome P450 metabolite (11.Fisslthaler B. Popp R. Kiss L. Potente M. Harder D.R. Fleming I. Busse R. Nature. 1999; 401: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). Whether or not an EDHF, AEA is likely to play an important role in the control of vascular tone (for reviews see Refs. 4.Wagner J.A. Varga K. Kunos G. J. Mol.

Biochem. 1999; 264: 258-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The pharmacological effects of AEA on CB1 and CB2 receptors depend, as for any other extracellular transmitter, on its life span in the extracellular space, which is limited by a two-step process: (i) its rapid and selective uptake by cells through the action of a membrane transporter and (ii) intracellular degradation. In particular, AEA is hydrolyzed to ethanolamine and arachidonic acid by the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) (17.Di Marzo V. Fontana A. Cadas H. Schinelli S. Cimino G. Schwartz J.C. Piomelli D. Nature. 1994; 372: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar, 18.Cravatt B.F. Giang D.K. Mayfield S.P. Boger D.L. Lerner R.A. Gilula N.B. Nature. 1996; 384: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar). Both components of this inactivation process of AEA are the objects of active investigations. Recent data seem to indicate that the uptake process is the rate-limiting step in AEA degradation (19.Hillard C.J. Edgemond W.S. Jarrahian A. Campbell W.B. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 20.Beltramo M. Stella N. Calignano A. Lin S.Y. Makriyannis A. Piomelli D.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5802-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). There is pharmacological evidence suggesting that also the hypotensive action of AEA in vivo is limited by its re-uptake (24.Calignano A. La Rana G. Beltramo M. Makriyannis A. Piomelli D. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 337: 1-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, the existence of the AEA membrane transporter in endothelial cells has never been investigated. Although cannabinoid receptor activation was recently shown to lead to AEA biosynthesis (25.Shivachar A.C. Martin B.R. Ellis E.F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 26.Pestonjamasp V.K. Burstein S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1394: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the possibility of a functional link between CB1 and CB2 receptors and the AEA transporter has not been tested. Such a functional coupling might trigger self-elimination of AEA following activation by this lipid of cannabinoid receptor-dependent signaling pathways and would represent a regulatory loop critical for the manifold actions of this compound. A possible mechanism for this coupling may be suggested by findings that AEA binding to cannabinoid receptors leads to NO release (13.Deutsch D.G. Goligorsky M.S. Schmid P.C. Krebsbach R.J.

Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 1999; 57: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), whereas AEA uptake is enhanced by NO donors (22.Maccarrone M. van der Stelt M. Rossi A. Veldink G.A.

The results reported here demonstrate a saturable and temperature-dependent transport of AEA into endothelial cells. AEA uptake by human umbelical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) is enhanced by various NO donors and further potentiated by superoxide anions. Conversely, a major cellular antioxidant and NO scavenger, glutathione, reduces the NO effect on the AEA transport. The observation that exogenously added NO donors may link CB receptors and HUVEC AEA transporter, through a CB receptor-mediated up-regulation of inducible NO synthase (NOS) and intracellular release of nitric oxide, appears to be the main outcome of this investigation. Chemicals were of the purest analytical grade. AEA, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, hydroxocobalamin,N-acetylcysteine (NAC),dl-buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine (BSO), superoxide dismutase (SOD, bovine liver), actinomycin D, cycloheximide, Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), sodium nitroprusside (SNP) andN-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-arachidonoylamide (AM404) were purchased from Sigma. 2- AG andS-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) were from Research Biochemicals International, and spermine NONOate ((Z)-1-{N-[3- aminopropyl]-N-[4-(3-aminopropyl-ammonio)-butyl]-amino}-diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate) (SPER-NO) and 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1) were from Alexis Corp. (Läufelfingen, Switzerland). Peroxynitrite was from Calbiochem.N-piperidino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2, 4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-3-pyrazole-carboxamide (SR 141716) and N-[1(S)-endo-1,3,3-trimethyl bicyclo [2.2.1] heptan-2-yl]-5-(4-chloro-3-methylphenyl)-1-(4-methylbenzyl)-pyrazole-3-carboxamide (SR 144528) were a kind gift from Sanofi Recherche (Montpellier, France). [3H]AEA (223 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products, l-[2,3,4,5-3H]arginine (64 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [3H]2-AG (5 Ci/mol) was synthesized as described previously (21.Bisogno T. Sepe N. Melck D. Maurelli S. De Petrocellis L. Di Marzo V. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Linvanil (α-linolenoyl-vanillyl-amide) was synthesized as reported (29.Melck D. Bisogno T. De Petrocellis L. Chuang H.-h. Julius D. Bifulco M. Di Marzo V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). HU-210 was kindly donated by Prof. R. Mechoulam (The Hebrew University of Jerusalem). Monoclonal antibodies against the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the N-terminal region of the human CB1 receptor were from Calbiochem, and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the human apoptosis protease-activating factor 1 were purchased from Cayman Chemical. Goat anti-mouse antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase were from Bio-Rad. Generation of superoxide anions (O2−) was achieved by adding to the culture medium 100 μm xanthine and 5 milliunit/ml xanthine oxidase (Sigma), which produces about 2 μm O2−/min (30.Van der Vliet A. ‘t Hoen P.A. Wong P.S.-Y. Bast A. Cross C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30255-30262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). HUVECs were purchased from BioWhittaker and were cultured in 75-cm2 flasks at a density of 2500/cm2 in EGM-2 Bulletkit medium (BioWhittaker). HUVECs were maintained at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere and were split every second day (at 70–80% confluency) with daily replacement of the culture medium. The uptake of [3H]AEA by intact HUVECs was studied essentially as described (22.Maccarrone M. van der Stelt M. Rossi A. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32332-32339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Cells at the fourth to fifth passage were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinized with trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc.), and resuspended in their serum-free culture media at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. Cell suspensions (1 ml/test) were incubated for different time intervals, at 37 °C, with 100 nm [3H]AEA, and they were washed three times in 2 ml of culture medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin and were finally resuspended in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Membrane lipids were then extracted (31.Maccarrone M. Nieuwenhuizen W.F. Dullens H.F.J. Catani M.V. Melino G. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Finazzi-Agrò A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), resuspended in 0.5 ml of methanol, and mixed with 3.5 ml of Sigma-Fluor liquid scintillation mixture for nonaqueous samples (Sigma), and radioactivity was measured in a LKB1214 Rackbeta scintillation counter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To discern noncarrier-mediated from carrier-mediated transport of AEA into cell membranes, control experiments were carried out at 4 °C (22.Maccarrone M. van der Stelt M. Rossi A. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32332-32339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Incubations (15 min) were also carried out with different concentrations of [3H]AEA, in the range 0–1000 nm, to determine apparent K m andV max of the uptake by Lineweaver-Burk analysis (in this case, the uptake at 4 °C was subtracted from that at 37 °C). Q 10 value was calculated as the ratio of AEA uptake at 30 and 20 °C (19.Hillard C.J. Edgemond W.S. Jarrahian A. Campbell W.B. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). AEA uptake was expressed as pmol of AEA taken up/min/mg of protein. The effect of different compounds on AEA uptake (15 min) was determined by adding each substance directly to the incubation medium at the indicated concentrations. In the case of BSO or NAC, cells were preincubated for 6 h before assaying AEA uptake. Cell viability after each treatment was checked with Trypan blue and was found to be higher than 90% in all cases. Uptake of [3H]2-AG by HUVECs was determined as reported previously for other cell types (16.Di Marzo V. Bisogno T. De Petrocellis L. Melck D. Orlando P. Wagner J.A. Kunos G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 258-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 32.Di Marzo V. Bisogno T. Sugiura T. Melck D. De Petrocellis L. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). FAAH (E.C. 3.5.1.4) activity was assayed in HUVEC extracts by measuring the release of [3H]arachidonic acid from [3H]AEA, using reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography as reported (33.Maccarrone M. Bari M. Finazzi-Agrò A. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 267: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The activity of NOS (E.C. 1.14.13.39) was assayed by incubating cell extracts with the radiolabeled substrate [3H]arginine and then measuring the reaction product [3H]citrulline as described (34.Maccarrone M. Fantini C. Ranalli M. Melino G. Finazzi-Agrò A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). FAAH and NOS activities were expressed as pmol arachidonate or pmol citrulline released/min/mg of protein, respectively. The effect of various compounds on FAAH or NOS activity was determined by adding each substance directly to the assay buffer, at the indicated concentrations, and incubating for 15 min at 37 °C. The expression of the iNOS at the protein level was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, performed by coating the plate with cell homogenates (25 μg/well), prepared as described (34.Maccarrone M. Fantini C. Ranalli M. Melino G. Finazzi-Agrò A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Anti-iNOS monoclonal antibodies (diluted 1:400) were used as first antibody, and goat anti-mouse antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase were used as second antibody, diluted 1:2000. Color development of the alkaline phosphatase reaction was followed at 405 nm, usingp-nitrophenylphosphate as substrate (34.Maccarrone M. Fantini C. Ranalli M. Melino G. Finazzi-Agrò A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Controls included wells coated with different amounts of bovine serum albumin. The colorimetric assay based on 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) was used to quantify glutathione, the only detectable thiol in endothelial cells (35.Foresti R. Clark J.E. Green C.J. Motterlini R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18411-18417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). HUVECs (2.5 × 106 cells/test) were treated with different compounds (or vehicle alone in the controls) for 15 min, and they were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged at 800 × g,and pellets were resuspended in 75 μl of trichloroacetic acid (5% in 0.1 m HCl, 10 mm EDTA). Supernatants from the 10,000 × g centrifugation were recovered and aliquots of 60 μl were mixed with 130 μl of stock buffer (125 mmNa2PO4, 6.3 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). Ten μl of stock buffer containing 6 mm5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) were added to each sample, and after 30 min at room temperature in the dark the absorbance was read in a microtiter plate at 412 nm (extinction coefficient was 14.3 mm−1 cm−1) (35.Foresti R. Clark J.E. Green C.J. Motterlini R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18411-18417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The glutathione content of cellular extracts was within the linearity range of the assay procedure, as assessed by calibration curves made with glutathione (Sigma). The sensitivity of the colorimetric assay was ascertained by incubating HUVECs for 6 h with 1 mm BSO or NAC, a selective inhibitor or a precursor of glutathione biosynthesis, respectively (35.Foresti R. Clark J.E. Green C.J. Motterlini R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18411-18417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Generation of NO was determined by measuring accumulation of the stable end product nitrite (NO2−) in culture supernatants (30.Van der Vliet A. ‘t Hoen P.A. Wong P.S.-Y. Bast A. Cross C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30255-30262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 36.Waksman Y. Olson J.M. Carlisle S.J. Cabral G.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 288: 1357-1366PubMed Google Scholar). HUVECs (5 × 106 cells/test) were treated with different compounds (or vehicle alone in the controls) for 15 min, and the nitrite levels were determined in the culture medium via spectrophotometric analysis, after using nitrate reductase (Alexis Corporation, LÄufelfingen, Switzerland) and the acid-catalyzed diazotation reaction with sulfanylamide and naphtylethylenediamine (Griess reaction) as described (35.Foresti R. Clark J.E. Green C.J. Motterlini R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18411-18417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Nitrite levels in culture supernatants were within the linearity range of calibration curves made from a solution of sodium nitrite. HUVECs (5 × 106 cells/test) were treated with different compounds (or vehicle alone in the controls) for 15 min, then medium was discarded, and the cells were trypsinized as described above. Cyclic AMP levels in acetylated HUVEC extracts were determined by the Cayman Chemical cAMP Enzyme Immunoassay kit (Alexis Corporation, Läufelfingen, Switzerland). Cyclic AMP in cellular extracts was within the linearity range of the method, calibrated with acetylated cAMP as suggested by the manufacturer. Data reported in this paper are the mean ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments, each performed in duplicate. Statistical analysis was performed by the Student'st test elaborating experimental data by means of the InStat program (GraphPAD Software for Science). HUVECs were able to accumulate [3H]AEA, a process which was temperature- (Q 10 = 1.6), time- (t 1/2 = 4 min) and concentration-dependent (Fig.1 A and data not shown). [3H]AEA uptake at 37 °C was saturable (apparentK m = 190 ± 10 nm, apparentV max = 45 ± 3 pmol·min−1·mg−1 protein) and was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the synthetic vanilloid linvanil (29.Melck D. Bisogno T. De Petrocellis L. Chuang H.-h. Julius D. Bifulco M. Di Marzo V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), 10 μm of which reduced the transport to about 38% of the untreated control (TableI). A similar inhibition of AEA transport (42 ± 5% of the control) was observed also in the presence of 10 μm AM404 (not shown). It is noteworthy that 2-AG inhibited [3H]AEA uptake by HUVECs in a dose-dependent manner, showing a IC50 of 400 ± 30 nm. Lineweaver-Burk analysis of double reciprocal plots showed that the inhibition was competitive and had an apparent inhibition constant (K i) of 350 ± 30 nm. However, we could not find accumulation of [3H]2-AG into HUVECs and observed instead that the compound was either immediately hydrolyzed to [3H]arachidonic acid and glycerol (see below) or directly inserted into membrane phospholipids in a temperature-dependent fashion (data not shown), as previously reported for J774 macrophages and rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells (16.Di Marzo V.

Open table in a new tab The uptake of 1 μm [3H]AEA by intact HUVECs was measured after a 15-min incubation at 37 °C, in the absence or in the presence of each compound. Values in brackets represent percentage of the control. AEA uptake was dose dependently enhanced by the NO donors SNP, SNAP, or SPER-NO (Fig. 1 B), which led to a 2.2-fold increase when used between 2.5 mm (SNAP) and 5 mm (SNP or SPER-NO). The NO scavenger hydroxocobalamin (1 mm) abolished the stimulation of AEA uptake by 5 mm SNP or 2.5 mm SNAP. NO can readily react with O2− generating peroxynitrite (ONOO−), a potent oxidant and nitrosylating agent (30.Van der Vliet A. ‘t Hoen P.A. Wong P.S.-Y. Bast A. Cross C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30255-30262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Co-incubation of SNP or SNAP with a superoxide (O2−) generating system, such as xanthine-xanthine oxidase (see “Experimental Procedures”), led to a further enhancement of AEA transport compared with NO donors alone,i.e. up to 2.7- and 3.2-fold the control compared with 2.0- and 2.5-fold with SNP or SNAP, respectively (Fig.2 A). Superoxide ions alone hardly affected AEA uptake (not shown). To test the hypothesis that peroxynitrite was more efficient than NO as a stimulator of AEA transport, SIN-1, which generates ONOO− via simultaneous release of NO and O2− in stoichiometric amounts (37.Kelm M. Dahmann R. Wink D. Feelisch M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9922-9932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), was used. SIN-1 (1 mm) was twice as effective as SNP (5 mm) or SNAP (2.5 mm) in enhancing AEA uptake by HUVECs, leading to a 4-fold increase over the untreated control (Fig. 2 A). When peroxynitrite was added directly to the medium, a dose-dependent increase in AEA uptake by HUVECs was also observed. The transport increased from 18.5 ± 1.2 to 32.3 ± 2.5 or 39.4 ± 3.4 pmol·min−1·mg−1 protein, in the presence of 150 or 300 μm ONOO−, respectively. The presence of SOD (100 units/ml) in the medium significantly reduced the effect of SNP or SNAP on AEA transport into the endothelial cells (Fig.2 A). The effect of SOD on AEA transport was more pronounced when the experiments were carried out with SIN-1 (from 4- to 1.5-fold of the control). Finally, the presence of O2− in excess over NO, as in the case of co-incubation of HUVECs with O2− and SIN-1, did not further potentiate AEA uptake by endothelial cells, which was instead slightly reduced (Fig. 2 A). To examine whether intracellular glutathione could affect the activation of AEA uptake by NO donors, HUVECs were treated with NAC or BSO, a precursor or a selective inhibitor of glutathione biosynthesis, respectively (35.Foresti R. Clark J.E. Green C.J. Motterlini R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18411-18417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). NAC produced a 1.8-fold increase in intracellular glutathione (Fig.3 A). Under these conditions, the induction of AEA transport by SNP, SNAP, or SIN-1 was markedly attenuated (Fig. 2 B). On the other hand, treatment with BSO reduced by 50% the glutathione content in HUVECs (Fig. 3 A), further enhancing the AEA uptake by any of the NO donors used (Fig.2 B). It is worth noting that recently it has been shown that NO donors per se do not affect the intracellular glutathione concentration in endothelial cells (35.Foresti R. Clark J.E. Green C.J. Motterlini R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18411-18417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Once taken up by HUVECs, AEA (and possibly 2-AG (32.Di Marzo V. Bisogno T. Sugiura T. Melck D. De Petrocellis L. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 38.Goparaju S.K. Ueda N. Yamaguchi H. Yamamoto S.

However, respiration stimulated by succinate (K iapp = ∼6 μm) was less sensitive to Zn2+, indicating the existence of a mitochondrial target for Zn2+ upstream from bc 1 complex. Purified pig heart α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex was strongly inhibited by Zn2+(K iapp = 0.37 ± 0.05 μm). Glutamate dehydrogenase was more resistant (K iapp = 6 μm), malate dehydrogenase was unaffected, and succinate dehydrogenase was stimulated by Zn2+. Zn2+inhibition of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex required enzyme cycling and was reversed by EDTA. Reversibility was inversely related to the duration of exposure and the concentration of Zn2+. Physiological free Zn2+ may modulate hepatic mitochondrial respiration by reversible inhibition of the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. In contrast, extreme or chronic elevation of intracellular Zn2+ could contribute to persistent reductions in mitochondrial respiration that have been observed in Zn2+-rich diseased tissues. Intracellular free Zn2+ is elevated in a variety of pathological conditions, including ischemia-reperfusion injury and Alzheimer's disease. Impairment of mitochondrial respiration is also associated with these pathological conditions. To test whether elevated Zn2+ and impaired respiration might be linked, respiration of isolated rat liver mitochondria was measured after addition of Zn2+.

Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1989; 31: 145-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Interest in the biological function of chelatable Zn2+ has grown steadily during the last decade. This interest was stimulated in part by the recognition that the concentration of chelatable Zn2+ is elevated in some cerebral regions following episodes of transient ischemia (2.Tonder N.

Oxidative energy metabolism is impaired in many neurodegenerative disorders (22.Blass J.P. Tanzi R.E. Wasco W. Molecular Models of Dementia. Humana Press, New York1996: 91-102Google Scholar, 23.Gibson G.E. Sheu K.-F.R. Blass J.P. J. Neur. Transm. 1998; 105: 855-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 24.Beal M.F. Bioch. Biophys.

One component of energy metabolism that has been extensively studied is the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (KGDHC).1 Reductions in KGDHC activity or protein abundance in brain occur in several neurological diseases (25.Mastrogiacomo F.

Neurol. 1994; 35: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The cause of this deficit has not been established. Reduced concentration and/or activity of enzymes involved in mitochondrial carbohydrate metabolism has been documented for both chronic ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion injury in heart and brain (20.Zaidan E. Sims N.R. Brain Res. 1997; 772: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 21.Kobayashi K. Neely J.R. J. Mol.

Blood Flow Metab. 1993; 13: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Studies on intact mitochondria have revealed that Zn2+inhibits respiration supported by combined glutamate and malate (32.Skulachev V.P. Christyakov V.V. Jasaitis A.A. Smirnova E.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 26: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) or β-hydroxybutyrate (33.Hunter F.E. Ford L. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 216: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies identified complex III, specifically the bc 1 complex, as the site of Zn2+ binding and inhibition (34.Lorusso M. Cocco T. Sardanelli A.M. Minuto M. Bonomi F. Papa S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 35.Link T.A. von Jagow G. J. Biol.

(Similarly, cytochrome b 562 -o complex of aerobically grown Escherichia coli K12 is inhibited by Zn2+ (36.Kita K. Konishi K. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3368-3374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).) These studies utilized substrates that enter the respiratory chain downstream from complex I such as succinate, nonylubihydroquinone, or duroquinol (32.Skulachev V.P. Christyakov V.V. Jasaitis A.A. Smirnova E.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 26: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 34.Lorusso M. Cocco T. Sardanelli A.M. Minuto M. Bonomi F. Papa S. Eur. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25001-25006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The choice of substrates in the earlier studies precluded detection of Zn2+ inhibition of upstream dehydrogenases. Evidence of disease-linked impairment of KGDHC activity (see previous paragraph), which is part of the (Krebs) tricarboxylic acid cycle that is upstream from complex I, motivated us to examine the effect of Zn2+on earlier stages of mitochondrial energy metabolism. Because the cytosolic concentration of free Zn2+ in dissociated hepatocytes is in the range of 0.6–2.7 μm (37.Kleineke J.W. Brand I.A. J. Pharmcol. Tox. Methods. 1997; 38: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we tested the effect of submicromolar to micromolar Zn2+ upon mitochondrial respiration. KGDHC converts α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), coenzyme A (CoA), and NAD+ to succinyl-CoA, CO2, and NADH in the presence of thiamin pyrophosphate (TTP) (38.Berg A. de Kok A. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 617-634PubMed Google Scholar). The complex subunit structure of KGDHC has been extensively studied. The sequential activities catalyzed by KGDHC (39.Reed L. Mukherjee B. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 55-61Crossref Scopus (281) Google Scholar) are summarized below. KGDHC activity is feedback-inhibited by the reaction products NADH and succinyl-CoA (40.Garland P.B. Biochem J. 1964; 92: 10c-12cCrossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). KGDHC is also sensitive to metals; activity is enhanced by millimolar Mg2+ or micromolar Ca2+ (41.Lawlis V.B. Roche T.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2512-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) but is inhibited by higher (>mm) concentrations of Ca2+ (42.Bernard P.A. Cockrell R.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 766: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 43.Lai J.C.K. Cooper A.J.L. J. Neurochem. 1986; 47: 1376-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report that micromolar concentrations of Zn2+ in the assay buffer inhibit respiration of intact liver mitochondria. Respiration stimulated by α-KG is more sensitive to Zn2+ inhibition than respiration stimulated by other mitochondrial energy substrates. Experiments with purified enzyme indicated that KGDHC is inhibited by submicromolar concentrations of Zn2+. The possible roles of Zn2+ in the regulation of mitochondrial respiration and in mitochondrial pathology are discussed. Sodium α-KG, sodium succinate,l-glutamate, malate, NADH, NAD+, TPP, Tris, CoASH, dithiothreitol (DTT), fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA; A-6003), dl-6,8-thioctic acid amide (LipS2), 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol, p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet, EDTA, ZnCl2, CaCl2, and MgCl2 were purchased from Sigma. Whenever possible, ultrapure grades of reagents were used; all other reagents were of the highest quality available commercially. Stock solutions (100 mm) of lipoamide were prepared in Me2SO and used within a few hours or stored in frozen aliquots at −20 °C until needed. Where required, lipoamide (i.e. -SS- form) was reduced to dihydrolipoamide (i.e. -(SH)2 form)in situ by inclusion of 0.1 mm DTT in the reaction solution. Buffer solutions were prepared using water that was distilled and then deionized through alternating anion-cation exchangers (Barnstead), resulting in >15 MΩ/cm resistance. Absolute Zn2+ concentrations were determined by flame atomic absorption analysis using a Hitachi 6100 Zeeman Background Correction atomic absorption spectrometer. Analysis of the buffers used in all assays indicated that total Zn2+ was below the limit of detection (<0.08 μm). Pig heart KGDHC (0.5 unit/mg of protein (11.1 mg/ml) in a solution containing 50% glycerol, 25% sucrose, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm DTT, 10 mg/ml BSA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.01% sodium azide, and 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.9); pig heart lipoamide dehydrogenase (dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase; the E3 component of KGDHC) (suspension in 3.2m ammonium sulfate; 128 units/mg of protein; 11.5 mg/ml)); and pig heart mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (MDH) (910 units/mg of protein in 50% glycerol containing 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 5.6 mg/ml) were obtained from Sigma. Beef liver glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) (crystalline suspension in 2m ammonium sulfate; 20 mg/ml of protein; 120 units/mg) was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Enzyme activities are expressed as μmol of product formed per min at 37 °C. Rat liver mitochondria were isolated essentially as described previously (44.Kristal B.S. Jackson C.T. Chung H.-Y.

Chem. 1999; 274: 23169-23175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). All steps were carried out at 0–4 °C. Four-month-old Fisher 344 male rats were decapitated. Livers were rapidly removed and homogenized with a motor-driven Teflon pestle in buffer A (250 mm mannitol, 75 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with KOH) supplemented with 100 μm K-EDTA and 500 μm K-EGTA. After centrifugation at 1,000 ×g for 10 min, the supernatants were removed and subjected to centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The resulting pellets were washed in buffer A supplemented with 100 μmK-EDTA and 500 μm K-EGTA and 0.5% (w/v) fatty acid-free BSA and centrifuged at 10,000 × g, followed by two additional washes in buffer A supplemented with 30 μmEDTA and 0.5% (w/v) fatty acid-free BSA. Following the final wash, mitochondria were resuspended in buffer A and 5 μmK-EDTA. Protein concentrations were estimated spectrophotometrically using BSA as a standard (47.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial oxygen consumption was measured at 28 °C using a Clark electrode in a computer controlled system (Hansatech, PP Systems, Haverhill, MA) as described previously with minor modification (44.Kristal B.S. Jackson C.T. Chung H.-Y. Matsuda M. Nguyen H.D. Yu B.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 823-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were added to 1.7-ml chambers containing respiration buffer (270 mm sucrose, 10 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4, 3 mmMgCl2; final mitochondrial concentration, 0.8 ± 0.2 mg protein/ml). Samples were preincubated with or without added ZnCl2 for 2 min. Following preincubation, state 4 respiration (respiration in the absence of ADP) was initiated by addition of substrate (5 mm α-KG, 7.5 mmsuccinate, or 6.25 mm glutamate/malate). These substrate concentrations were saturating for state 3 respiration under the conditions used (data not shown). After an additional 3 min, state 3 respiration rates (ADP-stimulated) were determined by adding ADP to a final concentration of 0.5 mm (48.Estabrook R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 41-47Crossref Scopus (1896) Google Scholar). Stabilized respiration rates (i.e. 1 min after ADP addition) were determined by least square regression analysis using Hansatech software. The intervals used for determination of the rate of oxygen consumption were 1.5 min for state 4 and 2–3 min for state 3. The enzyme is sensitive to inhibition by low concentrations of Zn2+ (see “Results”). Therefore, as a prerequisite for the study of the effect of Zn2+ on KGDHC, the purified enzyme complex was subjected to Sephadex chromatography to remove EGTA, EDTA, and BSA (components of the storage buffer that chelate Zn2+ and other divalent ions). An aliquot (100 μl) of the commercial KGDHC preparation was loaded onto a 0.5 × 8 cm Sephadex G-200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.1 mm DTT. The enzyme was eluted with 100-μl aliquots of the same buffer, and fractions containing enzyme activity (fractions 6–8) were used. Activity of the most-concentrated fractions was stable at 4 °C for 3–7 days. KGDHC is composed of multiple copies of three different subunits that transfer intermediate enzyme products in an ordered fashion (39.Reed L. Mukherjee B. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 55-61Crossref Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The combined E1, E2, and E3 subunits of KGDHC catalyze the following reaction sequence in the presence of α-KG, TPP, CoA, and NAD+.α­KG+TPP­E1→succinyl­TPP­E1+CO2Equation 1 Succinyl­TPP­E1+[LipS2]­E2→succinyl­[SLipSH]­E2Equation 2 +TPP­E1Succinyl­[SLipSH]­E2+CoASH→[Lip(SH) 2]­E2Equation 3 +succinyl­SCoA[Lip(SH) 2]­E2+E3­FAD→[LipS2]­E2+Reduced E3­FADEquation 4 Reduced E3­FAD+NAD+→E3­FAD+NADH+H+Equation 5 where [Lip(SH)2] and [LipS2] represent the dihydrolipoamide (reduced form) and lipopamide (oxidized form) of the tethered lipoic acid prosthetic group of E2, respectively (39.Reed L. Mukherjee B. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 55-61Crossref Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The overall reaction is as follows.α­KG+CoASH+NAD+→Succinyl­SCoA+NADHEquation 6 +H++CO2Assay of the combined E1-E2 activity (Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3) can be accomplished by introducing free LipS2 to replace E3-FAD as an electron acceptor (Equation 7). The reduced lipoamide prosthetic group is oxidized by disulfide exchange, allowing E2 to recycle while generating a pool of Lip(SH)2.[Lip(SH) 2]­E2+LipS2→[LipS2]­E2+Lip(SH) 2Equation 7 Subsequent quantitation of Lip(SH)2 is accomplished in an end point assay that measures the burst of NADH produced upon addition of the accumulated Lip[SH]2 to a mixture of purified E3 and excess NAD+.Lip(SH) 2+E3­FAD→LipS2+reduced E3­FADEquation 8 Reduced E3-FAD then converts NAD+ to NADH (Equation5) giving the following overall reaction.Lip(SH) 2+NAD+→LipS2+NADH+H+Equation 9 Assay of E3 activity (independent of E1 and E2) is accomplished by providing exogenous Lip(SH)2 and NAD+ to either KGDHC or isolated E3, as in Equation 9. Reaction 9 is freely reversible. Therefore, the reverse (diaphorase) reaction catalyzed by E3 can be monitored in the presence of NADH and LipS2 (see below). The volume of the reaction mixtures was 200 μl, except where noted. Activities were determined spectrophotometrically at 23 °C using a 96-well spectrophotometric plate reader (SpectraMax 250, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). NADH appearance or disappearance was measured at 340 nm (ε340 nm = 6.23 × 103). Typically, the absorbance values of individual wells were determined at 5-s intervals. In all cases where Zn2+ was present the cation was added as the chloride salt, prior to initiation of the reaction. Standard assay mixtures were as follows: (i) for KGDHC: 3.2 mm α-KG, 2 mm NAD+, 0.7 mm TPP, 0.5 mm CoASH, 20 μmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm DTT, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; (ii) for combined E1 and E2: mixture 1 (100 μl): 4 mm α-KG, 0.7 mm TPP, 0.5 mm CoASH, 0.3 mmLipS2, 20 μm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 12–25 μg/ml desalted KGDHC, and mixture 2 (100 μl): 2 mm NAD+, 20 μm EDTA, 10 μl of 1:40 dilution of lipoamide dehydrogenase (E3) suspension, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Zn2+ was added to mixture 1 before initiating the reaction with α-KG. After 15 min, 100 μl of mixture 1 was added to an equal volume of Mixture 2 in a microtiter well. The optical density was recorded before and after mixing. Mixture 1 in the presence of α-KG supports the combined E1-E2 activity (Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3 and 7) generating Lip(SH)2 as the final product. Addition of mixture 2 promotes the consumption of Lip(SH)2 and production of NADH (Equation 9). The rapid increase in absorbance, because of reduction of NAD+ after combining mixtures 1 and 2, was interpreted as a quantitative measure of the pool of Lip(SH)2 formed by the combined E1-E2 activities. Note that EDTA was included in mixture 2 to prevent possible inhibition of E3 by chelating Zn2+ carried over from Mixture 1; (iii) for E3 forward reaction: 2 mmNAD+, 0.25 mm LipS2, 0.1 mm DTT, and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; and (iv) for E3 reverse reaction: 0.1 mm NADH, 0.1 mmLipS2, and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. For SDH activity, isolated mitochondria (∼20 mg/ml protein) were fractured by three freeze-thaw cycles and mixed with an equal volume of reaction buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4). The standard reaction mixture contained ∼0.5 mg/ml mitochondrial protein, 7 mm sodium succinate, 0.5 mm p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet in reaction buffer. Reaction progress was monitored as an increase of absorbance at 490 nm. For GDH, 10 mm α-KG, 0.5 mm NADH, 50 mm ammonium sulfate, 0.1 mm ADP, and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, were used. For MDH, 10 mmoxaloacetate (added as a solid immediately before assay), 1 mm NADH, and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, were used. All data are reported as the means ± S.E. Enzyme velocities (V) were determined by regression analysis of the change in NADH absorbance with time. Apparent inhibition constants (K iapp) for enzyme data were determined by Dixon plots of 1/V plotted against the concentration of added Zn2+ (49.Copeland R.A. Enzymes: A Practical Introduction to Structure, Mechanism, and Data Analysis. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1996: 225-233Google Scholar).K iapp was the negative of the x intercept calculated from the linear regression coefficients determined using SIGMAPLOT (SPSS, Inc.). Regression analysis for Dixon plots of respiration data was performed using the Robust Regression routine in the NCSS 97 statistics package (Kaysville, UT). Standard errors forK iapp were calculated from the product of the estimatedK iapp and the estimated confidence value (the root of the sum of the squares of the confidence values for the two regression coefficients). Significance between means was tested using Student's t test (two-tailed). Respiration was measured in isolated, intact liver mitochondria by monitoring oxygen consumption using succinate, glutamate/malate, or α-KG as substrates.

Under these conditions Zn2+ did not induce mitochondrial swelling, as assessed by absorbance at 540 nm. 2B. S. Kristal and A. M. Brown, manuscript in preparation. Mitochondria were preincubated for 2 min in the presence of 0–6.4 μmZn2+. Substrate was added, and 3 min of state 4 respiration was monitored prior to ADP addition (state 3 respiration). Fig.1 A illustrates that in the presence of succinate state 3 respiration was at least partly maintained at 6.4 μm Zn2+. All five mitochondrial preparations tested in the presence of succinate failed to recover state 4 respiration when exposed to 6.4 μmZn2+, which may be due to uncoupling and/or ATPase activation. Glutamate/malate-stimulated state 3 respiration was somewhat inhibited by 0.4 or 1.6 μm Zn2+ and completely inhibited by 6.4 μm Zn2+ (Fig.1 B). In contrast, partial inhibition of α-KG-stimulated State 3 respiration was observed at 0.4 μm, and complete inhibition required only 3.2 μm Zn2+ (Fig.1 C). The IC50 values for each substrate (TableI) were statistically different from each other (p < 0.05). TheK iapp for Zn2+ inhibition of respiration determined analytically (Fig. 2) also differed significantly for each substrate and was smallest for α-KG (Table I).Table IInhibition of state 3 respiration in isolated, intact rat liver mitochondriaSubstratenIC50K iaDixon plot calculated from Fig 2.μmμmα-Ketoglutarate51.1 ± 0.2bp = 0.0007 versus succinate, paired t test; p = 0.040 versusglutamate/malate, paired t test.1.2 ± 0.1dp < 0.001 versus succinate,t test; p = 0.015 versusglutamate/malate, t test.Succinate56.2 ± 0.5cp = 0.0084 versusglutamate/malate, paired t test.6.0 ± 0.9Glutamate/malate42.0 ± 0.42.2 ± 0.4a Dixon plot calculated from Fig 2.b p = 0.0007 versus succinate, paired t test; p = 0.040 versusglutamate/malate, paired t test.c p = 0.0084 versusglutamate/malate, paired t test.d p < 0.001 versus succinate,t test; p = 0.015 versusglutamate/malate, t test.

Possible sites of Zn2+ inhibition include mitochondrial dehydrogenases associated with the oxidation of the various metabolites tested above. Therefore, the Zn2+sensitivities of the relevant mitochondrial dehydrogenases were directly tested. Incubation of mitochondrial lysates with 100 μmZn2+ resulted in a ∼2-fold activation of SDH activity (data not shown). Purified mitochondrial MDH was unaffected by 100 μm Zn2+ (Fig.3 A), whereas purified GDH activity was inhibited by Zn2+ (Fig. 3 B) withK iapp = 6.1 ± 0.6 μm. In contrast, as detailed below, KGDHC activity was inhibited by submicromolar concentrations of Zn2+. The high Zn2+ sensitivities observed for both α-KG-stimulated mitochondrial respiration and purified KGDHC activity (relative to the other substrates and dehydrogenases) supports the hypothesis that KGDHC is a target for intracellular Zn2+. To obtain additional evidence in support of this conclusion, detailed experiments delineating the effect of Zn2+ on purified KGDHC were carried out. Preliminary experiments with purified KGDHC indicated that Zn2+ in the range of 2–5 μm inhibited enzyme activity. However, the value of the determinedK iappprogressively declined as the concentration of enzyme in the reaction mixture was reduced (data not shown).

Although recent studies have suggested a role for cardiac-specific zinc finger GATA factors in the transcriptional pathways that modulate cardiac hypertrophy, it is unknown whether these factors are also involved in cardiac ET-1 transcription and if so, how these factors are modulated during this process. Using transient transfection assays in primary cardiac myocytes from neonatal rats, we show here that the GATA element in the rat ET-1 promoter was required for phenylephrine-stimulated ET-1 transcription. Cardiac GATA-4 bound the ET-1 GATA element and activated the ET-1 promoter in a sequence-specific manner. Stimulation by phenylephrine caused serine phosphorylation of GATA-4 and increased its ability to bind the ET-1 GATA element. Inhibition of the extracellularly responsive kinase cascade with PD098059 blocked the phenylephrine-induced increase in the DNA binding ability and the phosphorylation of GATA-4. These findings demonstrate that serine phosphorylation of GATA-4 is involved in α1-adrenergic agonist-responsive transcription of the ET-1 gene in cardiac myocytes and that extracellularly responsive kinase 1/2 activation plays a role upstream of GATA-4.

Later work showed that it acts not only as a vasoconstrictor but also as a potent growth-promoting peptide. For example, ET-1 can induce myocyte hypertrophy (2.Shubeita H.E. McDonough P.M.

ET-1 signaling is also coupled with Gi protein. Therefore, it is able to decrease intracellular cAMP levels (4.James A.F. Xie L.H. Fujitani Y. Hayashi S. Horie M.

Although ET-1 is mainly produced by endothelial cells in the basal state, a number of cell types can synthesize ET-1 in response to various stimuli (5.Shichiri M. Hirata Y. Nakajima T. Ando K.

Left ventricular levels of ET-1 increase markedly in close association with the deterioration of systolic function following myocardial infarction and pressure overload (9.Sakai S. Miyauchi T.

ET receptor antagonists bosentan and BQ123 prevent the remodeling of the heart and have been shown to improve survival following myocardial infarction and pressure overload (9.Sakai S. Miyauchi T.

These findings demonstrate that up-regulated expression of ET-1 in cardiac myocytes plays a critical role in the development of heart failure in vivo. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to this up-regulation in the failing heart are unclear at present. The mechanisms regulating the transcription of the ET-1 gene have been studied in endothelial cells. The 204-bp sequences proximal to the transcription starting site is sufficient to drive high levels of expression in these cells in culture (11.Lee M.E. Bloch K.D. Clifford J.A. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10446-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of a putative GATA element in this sequence diminishes the transcriptional activity of the ET-1 promoter (12.Lee M.E. Temizer D.H. Clifford J.A. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16188-16192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Wilson D.B. Dorfman D.M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1990; 10: 4854-4862Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Although cardiac myocytes also express the subfamily of zinc finger GATA transcription factors (GATA-4/5/6), it is unknown whether the ET-1 GATA element is functional in this context. We and others have shown that GATA factors are required for transcriptional activation of the genes for β-myosin heavy chain and angiotensin II type 1a receptor during pressure overload-induced hypertrophy in vivo (15.Hasegawa K. Lee S.J. Jobe S.M. Markham B.E. Kitsis R.N. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3943-3953Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 16.Herzig, T. C., Jobe, S. M., Aoki, H., Molkentin, J. D., Cowley, A. W., Izumo, S., and Markham, B. E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 94, 7543–7548Google Scholar). For these reasons, it would be of interest to know whether GATA factors also mediate the up-regulation of the expression of cardiac ET-1 during myocardial cell hypertrophy. In addition, if this were the case, it would be important to examine how GATA factors are regulated during this process. The α1-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (PE) is a potent inducer of hypertrophy and ET-1 expression in cardiac myocytes (17.Kaburagi S. Hasegawa K. Morimoto T. Araki M. Sawamura T. Masaki T. Sasayama S. Circulation. 1999; 99: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), providing a useful tool to study the mechanisms for the induction of ET-1 expression in the failing heart. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the role of GATA factors in PE-stimulated transcription of cardiac ET-1. Primary ventricular cardiac myocytes were prepared as described previously (17.Kaburagi S. Hasegawa K. Morimoto T. Araki M. Sawamura T. Masaki T. Sasayama S.

Briefly, hearts from 1–2-day-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were removed, the ventricles were pooled, and the ventricular cells were dispersed by digestion with pancreatin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were preplated for 1 h to enrich for myocytes (90–95% of the cells after this step). Cells were plated at a density of 250 cells/mm2 onto 60-mm tissue culture dishes (Primaria, Falcon; Becton Dickinson & Co., Lincoln Park, NJ) and cultured in medium consisting of Hanks' salts plus MEM vitamin stock, MEM amino acids, MEM nonessential amino acids, 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.67 mm glycine, 0.92 mm hypoxanthine, 19.6 mmNaHCO3 (pH 7.1–7.2), penicillin, streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (all from Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 h. The plasmid construct pwtET-CAT was the transcription start site-proximal 204-bp wild type rat ET-1 promoter fused to the bacterial CAT gene (14.Kawana M. Lee M.E. Quertermous E.E. Quertermous T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4225-4231Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In pmutGATA-ET-CAT, a consensus GATA element located at sequence −136 to −131 was mutated in the context of the 204-bp rat ET-1 promoter (14.Kawana M. Lee M.E. Quertermous E.E. Quertermous T. Mol.

A promoterless CAT plasmid (basic CAT) was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). pRSVCAT and pRSVluc contain the CAT and luc genes, respectively, driven by Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat sequences (15.Hasegawa K.

The murine GATA-5 and GATA-6 expression plasmids, pcDNAG5 and pcDNAG6, were generous gifts of Dr. Michael S. Parmacek (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) and were described elsewhere (20.Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Tang Z. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev.

The murine GATA-4 expression plasmid pcDNAG4 was subcloned by digesting pMT2-GATA-4 (22.Arceci R.J. King A.A.J. Simon M.C. Orkin S.H. Wilson D.B. Mol. Cel.

Plasmids were purified by anion exchange chromatography (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), quantified by measurement ofA 260, and examined on agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide prior to use. 24 h after plating, cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and then co-transfected with 2 μg of the CAT construct of interest and 0.1 μg of pRSVluc using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. After a 2-h incubation with DNA-LipofectAMINE complex, the cells were washed twice with serum-free media and further incubated for 48 h in serum-free medium in the presence of 1.0 × 10−5m PE or saline as controls. The cells were then washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with lysis buffer, and subjected to assays for luciferase and CAT activities as described previously (15.Hasegawa K.

Nuclear extracts were prepared from cultures of primary neonatal rat cardiac myocytes as described (19.Morimoto T. Hasegawa K. Kaburagi S. Kakita T. Masutani H. Kitsis R.N. Matsumori A. Sasayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12811-12818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides that contained GATA motifs from the ET-1 promoter were designed. The sequences of the sense strand of these oligonucleotides were as follows: ET-GATA, 5′-CCTCTAGAGCCGGGTCTTAT-CTCCGGCTGCACGTTGC-3′, and mutET-GATA, 5′-CCTCTAGAGCCGGGTCTGCAC-TCCGGCTGCACGTTGC-3′. We also used a double-stranded oligonucleotide that contained p53-binding site in the p21 promoter as a control probe (19.Morimoto T. Hasegawa K. Kaburagi S. Kakita T. Masutani H. Kitsis R.N. Matsumori A. Sasayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12811-12818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Greiner, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan) and purified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. EMSAs were carried out at 4 °C for 20 min in 15-μl reaction mixtures containing 10 μg of nuclear extract, 0.25 ng (>20,000 cpm) of radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide, 500 ng of poly(dI-dC), 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 37.5 mm KCl, and 4% Ficoll 400. For cold competition experiments, a 100 molar excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide was included in the binding reaction mixture. Protein-DNA complexes were separated by electrophoresis on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.25 × TBE (1 × TBE is 100 mm Tris, 100 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA) at 4 °C. In these experiments, 50 mm NaF and 1 mmNa3VO4 were added in all buffers. Nuclear extracts from primary cultures of cardiac myocytes were immunoprecipitated using anti-GATA-4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA) in low stringency buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmEDTA, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, and leupeptin, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; all from Sigma) for 16 h at 4 °C and incubated with protein G beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The precipitate was washed four times in the same buffer, resuspended in 50 ml of SDS-lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 1 mm dithiothreitol), heated to 95 °C for 2 min, electrophoresed on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (10%), transferred to Immobilon membranes, and reacted with anti-phosphoserine antibody (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), which was subsequently detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. Signals were detected using the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To normalize for protein loading after immunoprecipitation, blots were stripped by incubation in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS for 30 min at 50 °C, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween, and then probed with anti-GATA-4 antibody. Cells were lysed with Laemmli loading buffer at 2× concentration (2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.04 mg/ml bromphenol blue, 0.12 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.28 m β-mercaptoethanol) (150 μl/35-mm dish). Electrophoresis was performed with approximately 20 μg of protein/sample on 12% low ratio bisacrylamide (100:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) gels. Filters were probed with anti-phospho-specific ERK1/2 antibody (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). An identical quantity of each lysate was used for Western blotting with an antibody that recognizes both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of ERK1/2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Data are presented as the means ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were performed using unpaired two-tailed Student's t tests or analysis of variance with Scheffe's test where appropriate, with a probability value less than 0.05 taken to indicate significance. The α1-adrenergic agonist PE is a potent inducer of hypertrophy and ET-1 expression in cardiac myocytes (17.Kaburagi S. Hasegawa K. Morimoto T. Araki M. Sawamura T. Masaki T. Sasayama S. Circulation. 1999; 99: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To determine whether the 204-bp promoter sequence of the ET-1 gene is sufficient to mediate PE-responsive transcription in neonatal rat ventricular cells, these cells were transfected with a CAT reporter construct driven by the 204-bp rat ET-1 upstream sequence (pwtET-CAT). To control for transfection efficiency, the cells were co-transfected with a small quantity of pRSVluc. After 48 h of stimulation with 1.0 × 10−5m of PE or saline as a control, cardiomyocytes were harvested for luciferase and CAT assays. The 204-bp ET-1 promoter fragment conferred PE-inducible expression on the CAT reporter gene (Fig.1 A). In contrast, PE stimulation did not induce the activity of a promoter derived from the ubiquitously expressed β-actin gene (data not shown). PE stimulation did not increase the background activity of a promoterless CAT (basic CAT) transfected into cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1 A). To rule out the possibility that the increase by PE of the ET-1 promoter activity occurs in contaminating cells other than cardiac myocytes (less than 10% in our preparation), which mainly consist of fibroblasts, NIH3T3 cells (mouse fibroblasts) were transfected with pwtET-CAT. In these cells, PE stimulation did not increase the activity of pwtET-CAT (Fig.1 B), indicating the cardiac-specific response of this promoter to PE. These findings demonstrate that the proximal 204-bp ET-1 promoter sequence contains element that are responsive to PE stimulation in cardiac myocytes. The 204-bp rat ET-1 promoter sequence contains a putative GATA motif, which was recently shown to mediate changes in the expression of other genes associated with hypertrophy (15.Hasegawa K. Lee S.J. Jobe S.M. Markham B.E. Kitsis R.N. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3943-3953Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 16.Herzig, T. C., Jobe, S. M., Aoki, H., Molkentin, J. D., Cowley, A. W., Izumo, S., and Markham, B. E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 94, 7543–7548Google Scholar). To clarify the role of the GATA element in PE-induced hypertrophy in the context of the ET-1 promoter, cardiac myocytes were transfected with CAT gene driven by the 204-bp ET-1 promoter containing a mutation in the GATA site (pmutGATA-ET-CAT), which abolishes the binding of cardiac GATA factors (see Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 1 A, the basal transcriptional activity of the transfected 204-bp ET-1 promoter was modestly decreased by the mutation of the GATA element (53% decrease versuswild type). In contrast, PE-responsive transcription was severely attenuated (2.2-fold for wild type versus 1.3-fold for GATA mutant). Thus, an intact GATA element is required for both basal and PE-responsive ET-1 transcription in cardiac myocytes. Among the six members of the GATA transcription factor family, only GATA-4, -5, and -6 are expressed in the heart (19.Morimoto T. Hasegawa K. Kaburagi S. Kakita T. Masutani H. Kitsis R.N.

To determine whether expression of GATA-4, -5, and/or -6 can transactivate the 204-bp ET-1 promoter via the GATA sites that mediate PE responsiveness (Fig. 1), we performed co-transfection experiments in NIH3T3 cells, which lack all GATA factors. A CAT reporter driven by the 204-bp ET-1 promoter was transiently transfected with a eukaryotic expression plasmid encoding GATA-4, -5, or -6 or β-galactosidase as a control. Transfection efficiency was monitored by co-transfecting a small quantity of pRSVluc. As shown in Fig.2, expression of GATA-4 (25-fold), -5 (91-fold), or -6 (13-fold) resulted in significant activation of the 204-bp ET-1 promoter. Moreover, co-transfection experiments employing the ET-1 promoter containing the same GATA site mutation as in Fig. 1illustrated that only GATA-4 and -5 transactivate the 204-bp ET-1 promoter in a GATA sequence-specific manner (Fig. 2). These data suggest that GATA-4/5 transactivate the ET-1 promoter directly via the GATA site. To identify cardiac nuclear factors that bind the ET-1 GATA site, EMSAs were performed with nuclear extracts from PE-stimulated neonatal cardiac myocytes. Nuclear extracts were probed with a radiolabeled ET-1 GATA double-stranded oligonucleotide in the presence or absence of competitor oligonucleotides (Fig.3 A). Competition EMSAs revealed that one retarded band, indicated by an arrow(first lane), represented a GATA sequence-specific complex, as evidenced by the fact that it was competed by an unlabeled ET-1 GATA double-stranded oligonucleotide (second lane) but not by an excess of the ET-1 GATA site containing mutations that abolishes PE responsiveness (third lane). This result suggests the presence of factor(s) that specifically bind to the ET-1-GATA sequence in extracts from PE-stimulated rat cardiac myocytes. Previous studies demonstrated that in vitro translated GATA factors can bind to the ET-1-GATA site (11.Lee M.E. Bloch K.D. Clifford J.A. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10446-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Lee M.E. Temizer D.H. Clifford J.A. Quertermous T. J. Biol.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4225-4231Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In addition, our results described above demonstrate that GATA-4/5 can transactivate the ET-1 promoter in a sequence-specific manner. Therefore, we examined by supershift experiments whether the factor(s) that specifically interact with the ET-1-GATA site in cardiac nuclear extracts are GATA-4 and/or GATA-5 (Fig. 3 B). Addition of anti-GATA-4 antibody resulted in nearly complete disappearance of the original complex formed by the interaction of the ET-1 GATA site with cardiac nuclear factors (second lane). In addition, it produced a new complex that migrated much more slowly than the original one. In contrast, addition of anti-GATA-5 antibody resulted in only slight diminishment of the original band and in the formation of a slower migrating complex which was much fainter than that formed upon the addition of anti-GATA-4 antibody (lane 3). These findings demonstrate that GATA-4 is the major cardiac nuclear factor that binds the ET-1-GATA site and that GATA-5 binds this site to a much lesser degree. To clarify the regulatory mechanisms for GATA-4 activation during PE-stimulated hypertrophy in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes, we examined the expression of GATA-4 following PE stimulation. In neonatal rat ventricular cells incubated with PE for 5 min - 48 h, the total GATA-4 expression levels were not altered by PE (Fig.4). We next examined the effect of PE on GATA-4 phosphorylation. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-GATA-4 antibody, followed by Western blot analysis with anti-phosphoserine antibody. As shown in Fig. 4, PE treatment resulted in a marked increase in the level of the phosphorylated form of GATA-4. The level was maximal at 3 h after PE treatment and decreased thereafter but continued to be high at 48 h after the treatment. To correct for differences in protein loading after immunoprecipitation, the same membrane was reblotted with anti-GATA-4 antibody. As shown in Fig. 4, total GATA-4 immunoreactivity did not change following PE stimulation. Therefore, the ratio of the phosphorylated form of GATA-4 to the total GATA-4 in cardiac myocytes was markedly increased by PE. Similar results were obtained with reciprocal experiments, i.e. immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphoserine antibody and Western blotting with anti-GATA-4 antibody. We could not detect a PE-stimulated increase in threonine phosphorylation of cardiac GATA-4. These findings indicate that PE stimulation causes serine phosphorylation of GATA-4, which might be involved in PE-responsive ET-1 transcription in cardiac myocytes. We tested the possibility that phosphorylation of GATA-4 results in functional consequences such as an increase in the DNA binding activity. COS7 cells were transfected with an expression plasmid encoding GATA-4 (pcDNAG4) and incubated in medium containing 10% serum. 48 h later, nuclear extracts were prepared by lysis of the transfected cells in lysis buffer in the presence or absence of phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaF and 1 mm Na3VO4). These extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-GATA-4 antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-phosphoserine antibody. As shown in the upper panel of Fig. 5 A, the phosphorylation of GATA-4 was evident in the nuclear extract collected with the phosphatase inhibitors but not in that without the inhibitors. However, the amount of GATA-4 (total of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms) was similar in these two extracts (Fig. 5 A,lower panel). Then we determined using EMSA whether the DNA binding activity of GATA-4 differed in the nuclear extracts used for the experiments shown in Fig. 5 A. By competition EMSAs using a radiolabeled ET-1 GATA double-stranded oligonucleotide as a probe (Fig. 5 B, second through sixth lanes), one retarded band (indicated by an arrow, second lane) was found to be a GATA sequence-specific complex, as evidenced by the fact that it was competed by an ET-1 GATA oligonucleotide (third lane) but not by an oligonucleotide with a GATA site mutations (fourth lane). In addition, this retarded band was clearly supershifted by anti-GATA-4 antibody (sixth lane) but not by IgG (fifth lane), indicating this band represents a complex of the ET-1 GATA oligonucleotide and GATA-4. Notably, the intensity of this band was much stronger in the nuclear extract prepared with the phosphatase inhibitors (second lane) than in that prepared without the inhibitors (first lane). These results suggest that phosphorylation of GATA-4 increases its DNA binding activity. To determine the upstream factors involved in PE-induced phosphorylation of GATA-4, we examined the effect of PD098059, a MEK-1-specific inhibitor, on GATA-4 phosphorylation, as well as on activation of ERK1/2, targets of MEK-1. Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were preincubated with or without 20 μm PD098059 for 1 h; then PE was added, and the myocytes were further incubated at 37 °C. Activation of ERK1/2 was estimated by Western blot analysis using an antibody that specifically recognizes the phosphorylated, active form of these enzymes. ERK1/2 were markedly activated after 15 min of PE stimulation (Fig. 5 A, second lane) compared with saline stimulation (Fig. 5 A, first lane). 20 μm PD098059 completely blocked the activation (Fig.5 A, third lane). GATA-4 phosphorylation was examined in cardiac myocytes collected 3 h after the PE stimulation, when the phosphorylation was maximal. Lysates of these cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-GATA-4 antibody followed by Western blotting with anti-phosphoserine antibody as above. As shown in Fig. 5 B, 20 μm PD098059 almost completely inhibited PE-induced GATA-4 phosphorylation. However, GATA-4 phosphorylation was not blocked by a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor (wortmannin) or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor (SB 203580) (data not shown). These results suggest that ERK activation is required for PE-induced phosphorylation of cardiac GATA-4. Last, to determine whether the ERK pathway is also involved in the DNA binding activity of cardiac GATA-4, EMSAs were performed with nuclear extracts from neonatal cardiac myocytes stimulated with saline and PE in the presence or absence of PD098059. These extracts were probed with a radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the ET-1 GATA site or that containing p53-binding site in the p21 promoter as a control. As shown in Fig. 6 (top two panels), the intensity of the specific band indicating GATA-4 binding was increased in nuclear extracts from PE-stimulated myocytes (second lane) compared with those from saline-stimulated cells (first lane). The PE-stimulated increase in the DNA binding activity of cardiac GATA-4 was almost completely blocked by PD098059 (third lane). In contrast, p53 binding activities were altered by PE nor PE plus PD098059 (Fig. 6, bottom two panels, first through third lanes). These experiments were repeated three times using independent preparations of cells and found to be reproducible. Taken together with the above results, these findings indicate that ERK activation and subsequent GATA-4 phosphorylation might be involved in the increased DNA binding activity of cardiac GATA-4 (Fig. 7).Figure 7PD098059 inhibits PE-stimulated increase in the cardiac ET-1 GATA binding activity. Cardiac myocytes were preincubated with (third lane) or without (firstand second lanes) 20 μm PD098059 (PD) for 1 h and subsequently stimulated with saline (SS, first lane) or PE (second andthird lanes) for 3 h. Nuclear extracts (10 μg of protein) from these cells were probed with a radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the ET-1 GATA site inA and with that containing the p53-binding site inB.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although ET-1 was initially identified as an endothelial cell-derived vasoconstrictor, it is now recognized as a growth-promoting peptide produced by a variety of cell types. Expression of ET-1 in cardiac myocytes is markedly increased in failing hearts (9.Sakai S. Miyauchi T. Kobayashi M. Yamaguchi I. Goto K. Sugishita K.

Circulation. 1998; 98: 2065-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In addition, the administration of ET receptor antagonists prevents remodeling of the heart following myocardial infarction and pressure overload independent of hemodynamic effects (9.Sakai S. Miyauchi T. Kobayashi M. Yamaguchi I. Goto K. Sugishita K. Nature. 1996; 384: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar,10.Iwanaga Y. Kihara Y. Hasegawa K. Inagaki K. Kaburagi S. Araki M. Sasayama S. Circulation. 1998; 98: 2065-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the local synthesis of ET-1 is involved in the development of heart failure in vivo. The α1-adrenergic agonist PE is a potent inducer of hypertrophy and ET-1 expression in cardiac myocytes (17.Kaburagi S. Hasegawa K. Morimoto T. Araki M. Sawamura T. Masaki T. Sasayama S. Circulation. 1999; 99: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The present results demonstrate that PE-inducible expression of cardiac ET-1 is mediated, at least in part, at the level of transcription and that phosphorylation of GATA-4 plays a role in this process. GATA factors are important for cardiac-specific transcription of many genes, including α-MHC, B-type natriuretic peptide, myosin light chain 1/3, and cardiac troponin C (23.Ip H.S. Wilson D.B.

Likewise, we showed here that mutation of the GATA element in the 204-bp ET-1 promoter moderately decreased the basal transcriptional activity in cardiac myocytes. In addition, recent studies, including ours, demonstrated that GATA transcription factors are also required for transcriptional activation of the genes for β-myosin heavy chain and angiotensin II type 1a receptor during hemodynamic overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy in vivo (15.Hasegawa K. Lee S.J. Jobe S.M. Markham B.E. Kitsis R.N. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3943-3953Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 16.Herzig, T. C., Jobe, S. M., Aoki, H., Molkentin, J. D., Cowley, A.

The results of the present study provide further evidence that GATA factors are involved in the hypertrophic process, because mutating the GATA element abolished α1-adrenergic-responsive ET-1 transcription. Thus, in the context of the ET-1 promoter, the GATA element plays an important role in both basal and PE-responsive transcription in cardiac myocytes. To date, six related zinc finger-containing proteins have been described that recognize and bind the GATA motif (19.Morimoto T. Hasegawa K. Kaburagi S. Kakita T. Masutani H. Kitsis R.N. Matsumori A.

The proteins fall into two subgroups: one consisting of GATA-1, -2, and -3 and one consisting of GATA-4, -5, and -6. The subgroups are defined both by sequence homology and expression pattern, with GATA-1, -2, and -3 predominating in blood and ectodermal derivatives and GATA-4, -5, and -6 predominating in heart and endodermal derivatives. Interestingly, the genes encoding GATA-4 and -6 are expressed in the heart throughout embryonic and postnatal development, whereas the murine GATA-5 gene is normally expressed in a temporally and spatially restricted pattern within the embryonic heart (20.Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Tang Z. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 183: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 21.Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrated that both GATA-4 and -5 activated the 204-bp ET-1 promoter in a sequence-specific manner. However, GATA-4 is the major cardiac nuclear factor that binds to the ET-1 GATA element, and GATA-5 binds to a much lesser degree. Despite this fact, our data do not rule out a potential contribution of GATA-5 to the PE-responsive ET-1 transcription because the expression of GATA-5 in cardiac myocytes increases during hypertrophy (19.Morimoto T. Hasegawa K. Kaburagi S. Kakita T. Masutani H. Kitsis R.N. Matsumori A. Sasayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12811-12818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The relative contributions of GATA-4 and GATA-5 to PE-responsive transcription should be further investigated. A large number of transcription factors have been shown to exist within cells as phosphoproteins. The functional consequences of phosphorylation vary but include regulation of DNA binding and transcriptional activation. It has been shown that other members of the GATA family of transcripiton factors, namely GATA-1 and -2, exist as phosphoproteins in erythroid or hematopoietic progenitor cells (27.Crossley M. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16589-16596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,28.Towatari M. May G.E. Marais R. Perkins G.R. Marshall C.J. Cowley S. Enver T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4101-4107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These proteins are phosphorylated exclusively on serine residues. Notably, stimulation with growth factors results in their enhanced phosphorylation. Systematic mutations of serine residues in GATA-1 do not appear to alter its transactivation function as judged by reporter gene assays conducted in COS cells, nor do they alter the DNA binding ability of GATA-1 proteins expressed in COS cells. Our data that stimulation by PE caused serine phosphorylation of GATA-4 in cardiac myocytes are compatible with these previous findings. In contrast to the previous reports, we observed that PE stimulation increased the DNA binding activity of GATA-4 in cardiac myocytes. The reason for this discrepancy is unclear at present, but further studies on precise mapping of phosphorylation sites are needed to clarify this discrepancy. Many hypertrophic stimuli, including α1-adrenergic stimulation, have been shown to activate the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, also known as the ERK pathway (29.Post G.R. Goldstein D. Thuerauf D.J. Glembotski C.C. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8452-8457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 30.Fuller S.J. Gillespie-Brown J. Sugden P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18146-18152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). ERK1/2 are one element in a series of kinases that serve to connect the nucleus with cytosolic events. The idea that phosphorylation of transcription factors by ERK1/2 might provide the cytoplasmic link between hypertrophic stimuli and changes in gene expression in the nucleus is supported by the observation that activated ERK1/2 can enter the nucleus. The present study demonstrated that inhibition of the ERK cascade with PD098059 blocked phosphorylation of GATA-4. These findings demonstrate that ERK1/2 plays a role upstream of GATA-4 in α1-adrenergic signaling of cardiac myocytes. The results also raise a secondary, although interesting, question of whether ERK1/2 brings about GATA-4 phosphorylation in a direct or an indirect fashion. In this regard, it is noteworthy that GATA-4 protein has multiple ERK1/2 phosphorylation sites (31.Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Tang Z. Parmacek M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8515-8524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Systematic mutagenesis of these positions is currently underway in our laboratory. However, ERK1/2 are activated 10–15 min after PE stimulation, whereas GATA-4 phosphorylation is maximal at 3 h after the stimulation. The precise relationship between ERK1/2 and GATA-4 should be further investigated. Cardiac myocyte hypertrophy is a central feature of all types of heart muscle failure. Hypertrophic stimuli reach the nucleus via multiple signaling pathways within cardiac myocytes and elicit changes in cardiac gene expression. ET-1 is one of the local factors that play important roles in the development of heart failure. Our present findings add ET-1 to the increasing list of factors whose transcriptional activation during cardiac hypertrophy is mediated by GATA factors. In addition, the present study provides the first evidence that post-translational modification of GATA-4 is involved in this process. Further elucidation of the precise mechanisms by which this central pathway modulates the hypertrophic response may provide novel therapeutic approaches to human heart failure."

Nonhuman antibodies are highly immunogenic in humans thereby limiting their potential use for therapeutic applications, especially when repeated administration is necessary. In order to reduce their immunogenicity, nonhuman antibodies have been humanized using strategies that are based on rational design, in vitroevolution, or a combination of both. An alternative route is the direct generation of human antibodies from transgenic mice containing human immunoglobulin (Ig)1 loci or by selection from naive or synthetic human antibody libraries displayed on phage (1.Barbas III, C.F.

Recombinant protein was purified from cell extracts as described (11.Moritz R.L. Ritter G. Catimel B. Cohen L.S. Welt S. Old L.J. Burgess A.W. Nice E.C. Simpson R.J. J. Chromatogr. Sect. A. 1998; 798: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Over a period of 4 to 5 months, 2 rabbits from the New Zealand White strain were treated with 3 subcutaneous injections of 106 LIM1215 cells followed by 3 subcutaneous injections of 1 μg of recombinant human A33 antigen in a 1-ml emulsion of Ribi adjuvant in PBS (Ribi Immunochem Research, Hamilton, MT). Antisera from the immune animals was analyzed for binding to recombinant human A33 antigen by ELISA using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Fc polyclonal antibodies (Cappel, West Chester, PA) as secondary antibodies. Five days after the final boost, spleen and bone marrow from 1 leg were harvested and used for total RNA preparation with TRI-REAGENT from Molecular Research Center (Cincinnati, OH). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using the Superscript Preamplification System for First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit with oligo(dT) priming (Life Technologies, Inc.). The first-strand cDNAs from each rabbit were subjected to separate 35-cycle polymerase chain reactions using Perkin-Elmer AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Systems, Brunchburg, NY) and 10 primer combinations for the amplification of rabbit VL (9 × Vκ and 1 × Vλ) coding sequences and 4 combinations for the amplification of rabbit VH coding sequences (Table I). The antisense primers consist of a hybrid rabbit/human sequence designed for the fusion of rabbit VL and VH coding sequences to human Cκ and CH1 coding sequences, respectively. Human Cκ and CH1 coding sequences were amplified from a pComb3H-compatible expression vector (3.Rader C. Barbas III, C.F. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) that contained the sequence of a human Fab directed to tetanus toxoid (12.Barbas III, C.F. Kang A.S. Lerner R.A. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7978-7982Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar) using the primer combination HKC-F (5-ACTGTGGCTGCACCATCTGTC-3′)/lead-B (5′GCCATGGCTGGTTGGGCAGC-3′) and HIgGCH1-F (5′-GCCTCCACCAAGGGCCCATCGGTC-3′)/dpseq (5′-AGAAGCGTAGTCCGGAACGTC-3′), respectively. The antisense primer lead-B hybridizes to a sequence upstream of the Fd fragment coding sequence and is used to amplify the Cκ coding sequence together with the sequence intervening LC and Fd fragment coding sequences in phagemid vector pComb3H (3.Rader C. Barbas III, C.F. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Based on this strategy, the chimeric rabbit/human LC and Fd fragment coding sequences are assembled and fused by 2 sequential overlap extension polymerase chain reaction steps. In the first step, rabbit VL and human Cκ are fused using the primer combination RSC-F (5′-GAGGAGGAGGAGGAGGAGGCGGGGCCCAGGCGGCCGAGCTC-3′)/lead-B and rabbit VH and human CH1 are fused using the primer combination lead-VH (5-GCTGCCCAACCAGCCATGGCC-3′) and dp-EX (5′-GAGGAGGAGGAGGAGGAGAGAAGCGTAGTCCGGAACGTC-3′). In the second step, the assembled chimeric LC and Fd fragment coding sequences are fused using the flanking primers RSC-F and dp-EX. Only LC and Fd fragment coding sequences derived from the same animal were combined. The final construct was cloned into phagemid vector pComb3H using 2 asymmetric SfiI sites (3.Rader C. Barbas III, C.F. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), yielding a complexity of 2 × 107 independent transformants. The phage library displaying the chimeric rabbit/human Fab was panned against immobilized recombinant human A33 antigen using 200 ng of protein in 25 μl of TBS for coating on 1 well of a Costar number 3690 96-well plate, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 in TBS for washing, and 10 mg/ml trypsin (Difco) in TBS for elution. Trypsinization was for 30 min at 37 °C. The washing steps were increased from 5 in the first round to 10 in the second round and 15 in the third and fourth round. A round of panning defines a sequence of binding of the phage to the antigen, removal of unspecific binders, and elution of specific binders followed by their reamplification in Escherichia coli. Indicative of a successful selection, the output numbers strongly increased after the third and fourth round. The output phage pool of each round was monitored by phage ELISA using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-M13 phage polyclonal antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) as secondary antibodies. An increasing signal above background from round to round was noted. Fourty clones from the final output were grown and induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyransoside. Supernatants were tested for binding to immobilized recombinant human A33 antigen by ELISA using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human F(ab′)2 polyclonal antibodies (Pierce, Rockford, IL) as secondary antibody. All clones gave a strong signal above background and were further analyzed by DNA fingerprinting. For this, phagemids were isolated, Fab coding sequences amplified using the flanking primers ompseq (5′-AAGACAGCTATCGCGATTGCAG-3′) and gback (5′-GCCCCCTTATTAGCGTTTGCCATC-3′), and digested with the 4-base pair cutter BstOI. Three different, although highly similar, fingerprints were obtained. Two of them, rabbit clones 1 and 2, were found in 13 and 26 clones, respectively. The third rabbit clone (3.Rader C. Barbas III, C.F. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) was represented only once. The sequence of the variable domains of heavy and light chain of clones 1, 2, and 3 was determined by DNA sequencing using the primers newpelseq (5′-CTATTGCCTACGGCAGCCGCTG-3′) and ompseq, respectively.

Open table in a new tab Note that the 3′ antisense primers are designed to allow the fusion of rabbit variable domains to human constant domains (M = A or C; R = A or G; S = G or C; Y = C or T). Human germ-line VLand VH sequences with the highest degree of homology with the corresponding rabbit sequences were identified from the VBASE Directory of Human V Gene Sequences by amino acid sequence alignment. The identified human sequences were diversified at positions that are potentially involved in antigen binding and used as frameworks for the grafting of the 6 rabbit CDRs as defined by Kabat et al.(13.Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Foeller C. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1991Google Scholar). Overlapping oligonucleotides were designed accordingly, synthesized, and assembled to synthetic VL and VH coding sequences in 2 sequential 10-cycle polymerase chain reaction steps using the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Molecular Systems). Using the same procedure as described for the generation of the rabbit antibody library, the synthetic VLand VH coding sequences were fused to human Cκ and CH1 coding sequences, respectively, and the resulting humanized light chain and Fd fragment coding sequences were assembled. The final construct was SfiI cloned into a variant of pComb3H in which the ampicillin resistance gene had been replaced by a chloramphenicol resistance. This prevents potential contaminations with phage derived from the rabbit antibody libraries. The resulting library with a theoretical complexity of only 256 consisted of 1 × 107 independent transformants and was panned against immobilized recombinant human A33 antigen essentially as described for the screening of the rabbit antibody library but under more stringent conditions. The amount of antigen was decreased from 100 ng in the first and second round to 50 ng in the third and fourth round and 25 ng in the fifth and sixth round. Ten washing steps with 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20 in TBS were performed for each of the 6 rounds. Round 3 and 4 as well as 5 and 6 were linked without phage amplification. For this, phage from round 3 and 5 were eluted by adding 50 μl of 100 mm HCl glycine (pH 2.2), incubated for 10 min at room temperature, collected, neutralized with 3 μl of 2m Tris base and 50 μl of 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in TBS, and directly subjected to another round of panning. Phage from rounds 1, 2, 4, and 6 were eluted by trypsinization as described before. Out of 70 clones from the final output that were analyzed by ELISA and all found to be positive, 24 clones were further analyzed by DNA sequencing as described before. The following oligonucleotides were used for humanization, L denotes primers for the VL assembly, H denotes primers for the VH assembly (r = A or G; S = G or C; W = A or T): L1, 5′- GAGCTCCAGATGACCCAGTCTCCATCCTCCCTGTCTGCATCTGTAGGAGACAGAGTCACCATCACTTGCCTGGCCAGTGAGTTCCTTTTTAATGGTGTATCC-3′; L2, 5′- AGATGGGACCCCAGATTCTAAATTGGATGCACCATAGATCAGGARCTTAGGARCTTTCCCTGGTTTCTGCTGATACCAGGATACACCATTAAAAAGGAACTC-3′; L3, 5′- AATTTAGAATCTGGGGTCCCATCTCGGTTCAGTGGCAGTGGATCTGGGACAGATTWCACTCTCACCATCAGCAGCCTGCAGSCTGAAGATGTTGCAACT-3′; L4, 5′- TTTGATCTCCACCTTGGTCCCTCCGCCGAAAGTCAAACCACTACTACCACTATAACCGCCTAGACAGTAATAAGTTGCAACATCTTCAGSCTGCAG-3′; L flank sense, 5′-GAGGAGGAGGAGGAGGGCCCAGGCGGCCGAGCTCCAGATGACCCAGTCTCCA-3′; L antisense flank, 5′- GACAGATGGTGCAGCCACAGTTCGTTTGATCTCCACCTTGGTCCCTCC-3′; H1, 5′- GAGGTGCAGCTGGTGGAGTCTGGGGGAGGCCTGGTCAAGCCTGGGGGGTCCCTGAGACTCTCCTGTGCAGCCTCTGGA-3′; H2A, 5′- CCAGCTAATGCCATAGTGACTGAAGGTGAATCCAGAGGCTGCACAGGAGAGTCT-3′; H2B, 5′- CCAGCTAATGCCATAGTGACTGAAGTCGATTCCAGAGGCTGCACAGGAGAGTCT-3′; H3, 5′- TTCAGTCACTATGGCATTAGCTGGGTCCGCCAGGCTCCAGGGAAGGGGCTGGAGTGGGTCGCCTACATTTATCCTAATTATGGGAGTGTAGACTACGCGAGC-3′; H4A, 5′- GTTCATTTGCAGATACASTGAGTTCTTGGCGTTGTCTCTGGAGATGGTGAATCGGCCATTCACGCTGCTCGCGTAGTCTACACTCCCATA-3′; H4B, 5′- GTTCATTTGCAGATACASTGAGTTCTGGGCGTTGTCGAGGGAGATGGTGAATCGGCCATTCACGCTGCTCGCGTAGTCTACACTCCCATA-3′; H5, 5′- AACTCASTGTATCTGCAAATGAACAGCCTGAGAGCCGAGGACACGGCCGTATATTWCTGTGCGAGAGATCGGGGTTATTATTCTGGTAGT-3′; H6, 5′- TGAGGAGACGGTGACCAGGGTGCCCTGGCCCCAGAGATCCAACCGAGTCCCCCTACTACCAGAATAATAACCCCGATC-3′; H flank sense, 5′-GCTGCCCAACCAGCCATGGCCGAGGTGCAGCTGGTGGAGTCTGGGGGA-3′; H flank antisense, 5′- GACCGATGGGCCCTTGGTGGAGGCTGAGGAGACGGTGACCAGGGTGCC-3′. Soluble Fab from rabbit clones 1 and 2 and humanized clones A to F were produced in E. coli strain Xl1-Blue using gene III fragment-depleted pComb3H as expression vector (3.Rader C. Barbas III, C.F. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Fab were purified from concentrated supernatants and from sonicated lysates of overnight 1-liter flask cultures induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyransoside by affinity chromatography using a 5-ml Protein G HiTrap column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) attached to an fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). PBS was used as equilibration and washing buffer and 0.5 m acetic acid for elution. Eluted fractions were neutralized immediately using 0.5 volumes of 1m Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), pooled, concentrated, and brought into PBS. Quality was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining, quantity by measuring the optical density at 280 nm using an Eppendorf BioPhotometer (Hamburg, Germany). Surface plasmon resonance for the determination of association (k on) and dissociation (k off) rate constants for binding of rabbit and humanized Fab to recombinant human A33 antigen was performed on a Biacore instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). A CM5 sensor chip (Biacore AB) was activated for immobilization withN-hydroxysuccinimide andN-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide according to the methods outlined by the supplier. Recombinant human A33 antigen was coupled at a low density to the surface by injection of 30 to 40 μl of a 1 ng/μl sample in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 3.5). Approximately 500 resonance units were immobilized. Subsequently, the sensor chip was deactivated with 1 methanolamine hydrochloride (pH 8.5). Binding of Fab to immobilized A33 antigen was studied by injection of Fab at 5 different concentrations ranging from 75 to 200 nm. PBS was used as the running buffer. The sensor chip was regenerated with 20 mm HCl and remained active for at least 50 measurements. Thek on and k off values were calculated using Biacore AB evaluation software. The equilibrium dissociation constant K d was calculated fromk off/k on. Data obtained from different sensor chips revealed a high consistency and were further validated as described (19.Rader C. Cheresh D.A. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8910-8915Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Triton X-100 (0.3% (v/v) in PBS, pH 7.5) lysates of human colon cancer cell lines were resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing (5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol) and nonreducing conditions. Proteins were blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA) and incubated with 0.5 μg/ml Fab followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human F(ab′)2 polyclonal antibodies (Pierce). Specific binding was visualized by chemiluminescence (Tropix, Bedford, MA). Flow cytometry was performed using a FACSscan instrument from Becton-Dickinson (Franklin Lakes, NJ). For each determination, 1 × 104 cells were analyzed. Indirect immunofluorescence staining was achieved with 2 μg/ml Fab in 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 25 mm Hepes, 0.05% (w/v) sodium azide in PBS. A 1:100 dilution of fluorescein isithiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-human F(ab′)2polyclonal antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) was used for detection. Incubation with primary antibodies was for 1 h, with secondary antibodies for 30 min at room temperature. All immunochemical stainings were done on snap-frozen tissue samples, embedded in O.C.T. compound (Tissue Tek, Torrance, CA). 5-μm cuts (HM503 cryostat, Zeiss, Walldorf, Germany) were mounted on slides for immunohistochemistry (Superfrost Plus, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Serial sections were used, so as to compare staining results of the different antibody preparations. After cutting, the slides were fixed in cold acetone for 10 min and then air dried. Reactivity of the humanized Fab was analyzed using the colon cancer cell line SW1222 xenografted into nude mice. A working concentration of Fab (1 μg/ml) was established by titering. The humanized Fab was detected by biotinylated goat-anti human F(ab)2 polyclonal antibodies (1:200; Vector, Burlingame, CA) and an avidin-biotin complex system (ABC/Elite kit, Vector). Diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Biogenex, San Ramon, CA) was used as a chromogen. Reactivity of the humanized Fab was also evaluated in human colonic adenocarcinoma samples. In order to prevent immunoreactivity of endogenous human immunoglobulin, a special technique for the detection of humanized Fab was utilized. Prior addition to tissue, the humanized Fab (1 μg/ml) was incubated with biotinylated goat-anti human F(ab)2 polyclonal antibodies in a test tube. The optimal ratio of humanized Fab to secondary antibody was determined in separate titration assays. Incubation of humanized Fab and secondary antibody was done at room temperature for 1 h and followed by an addition of human serum in order to block the activity of unbound secondary antibody. Again, the optimal ratio of human serum to secondary antibody was determined in separate titration assays. Our strategy for the generation and humanization of rabbit antibodies directed to human A33 antigen is outlined in Fig.1. Two rabbits were immunized with the human colon cancer cell line LIM1215 which expresses large amounts of the A33 antigen. A LIM1215 cDNA library had been used to clone the cDNA for human A33 antigen (8.Heath J.K. White S.J. Johnstone C.N. Catimel B. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. Tu G.F. Ji H. Whitehead R.H. Groenen L.C. Scott A.M. Ritter G. Cohen L. Welt S. Old L.J. Nice E.C. Burgess A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The initial immunization and 2 boosts elicited a weak immune response against recombinant human A33 antigen as revealed by the analysis of the rabbit sera by ELISA (data not shown). Both rabbits were further boosted with recombinant human A33 antigen derived from a baculovirus expression system. A strong immune response against recombinant human A33 antigen in sera from both rabbits resulted (data not shown). Our sequential cell and protein immunization strategy aimed at targeting the humoral immune response to native epitopes of the protein that are accessible at the cell surface. A rabbit antibody library displayed on phage was generated as follows. RNA was isolated from bone marrow and spleen of the immune rabbits, retro-transcribed, and VL and VH coding sequences were amplified using a variety of primer combinations designed to amplify most of the known rabbit antibody sequences (TableI). The primer combinations used here extend the primer sets reported previously (14.Ridder R. Schmitz R. Legay F. Gram H. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 15.Lang I.M. Barbas III, C.F. Schleef R.R.

Methods. 1998; 213: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Importantly, the rabbit antibody library was based on a chimeric Fab format. Variable domains from rabbit light and heavy chains were fused to the corresponding human constant domains. The use of human constant domains suggested several advantages. First, while antigen binding is confined to the variable domains and, thus, is not expected to be influenced by constant domain swapping, the human constant domains confer established and standardized detection and purification means on Fab derived from multiple species. Second, the use of human constant regions was found to improve the E. coli expression level of Fab (17.Carter P. Kelley R.F. Rodrigues M.L. Snedecor B. Covarrubias M. Velligan M.D. Wong W.L.T. Rowland A.M. Kotts C.E. Carver M.E. Yang M. Bourell J.H. Shepard H.M. Henner D. Bio/Technology. 1992; 10: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 18.Ulrich H.D. Patten P.A. Yang P.L. Romesberg F.E. Schultz P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11907-11911Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Lastly, a Fab with human constant domains is already partially humanized and can be readily channeled into recently reported strategies for complete humanization (19.Rader C. Cheresh D.A. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8910-8915Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The phage library displaying chimeric rabbit/human Fab was selected by panning against immobilized recombinant human A33 antigen. Among 40 selected clones that demonstrated strong reactivity in ELISA on immobilized recombinant human A33 antigen, only 3 distinct sequences were identified (Fig. 2). Data bank screening revealed that the sequences corresponding to the variable domains were rabbit sequences. The clones with distinct sequences were designated rabbit clones 1 to 3. Rabbit clones 1 and 2 shared identical Vκ coding sequences and 90% identical VH coding sequences. Rabbit clone 3 consisted of a Vκ coding sequence with 90% identity to rabbit clones 1 and 2 and shared an identical VH coding sequence with rabbit clone 3. The high similarity of the sequences included the hypervariable VDJ and VJ joint regions HCDR3 and LCDR3. Thus, it is likely that all the selected sequences originated from 1 B cell clone in 1 of the 2 rabbits that had undergone somatic diversification. Rabbit clones 1 and 2 were produced as soluble Fab in E. coli and purified by protein G affinity chromatography (Fig.3). Analysis by flow cytometry revealed that both Fab specifically bound to human colon cancer cells expressing native human A33 antigen (Fig. 4). Binding of the Fab to human A33 antigen was found to be very strong with affinities in the 1 nm range as determined by surface plasmon resonance using a Biacore instrument. Rabbit clones 1 and 2 gave K d values of 390 pm and 1.6 nm, respectively (Fig. 5, Table III). While both a higher association and a slower dissociation rate constant contributed to the higher affinity of rabbit clone 1, rabbit clone 2 gave consistently higher expression yields in E. coli. Considering the fact that the majority of selected clones contained the rabbit clone 2 sequence, it can be assumed that the higher expression level of rabbit clone 2 led to its preferential selection despite the higher affinity of rabbit clone 1.Figure 4Flow cytometry histograms demonstrating that the selected rabbit clones 1 and 2, as well as the selected humanized clones A-F, bind specifically to native human A33 antigen expressed on the cell surface. For indirect immunofluorescence staining, cells were incubated with Fab (except for the control) followed by f"

However, the cellular origin and molecular mechanism controlling differentiation of prostatic NE cells are unresolved. The prostate tumor cell line, LNCaP, can reversibly acquire many NE characteristics in response to treatment with β-adrenergic receptor agonists and activators of adenylate cyclase. In this study, we demonstrate that these treatments induce protein kinase A (PKA) activation in LNCaP cells and that ectopic expression of a constitutively activated form of the PKA catalytic subunit, CIα, results in acquisition of NE characteristics, including the extension of neuritic processes, cessation of mitotic activity, and production of neuron-specific enolase. Forskolin-, epinephrine-, and isoproterenol-dependent NE differentiation of LNCaP cells was significantly inhibited by expressing a dominant negative mutant of the PKA regulatory subunit, RIα. These results demonstrate that prostatic NE differentiation in response to these agents depends on PKA activation, and this signaling pathway may provide a therapeutic target for treating advanced forms of prostate cancer.

It has become evident that NE cells are a normal component of both the developing and mature prostatic epithelium and are postulated to be derived from stem cells common to both the exocrine and basal cell populations (3.Gkonos P.J.

NE cells produce a variety of neurosecretory products that exhibit growth-promoting activities, including parathyroid hormone-related peptides, neurotensin, serotonin, calcitonin, and bombesin-related peptides (5.Bologna M.

Virtually all prostatic adenocarcinomas contain foci of cells with NE characteristics (10.di Sant'Agnese P.A. Human Pathol. 1992; 23: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar).

Tumor cell populations become enriched for NE cells following long term anti-androgen therapy (15.Abrahamsson P.A. Lilja H.

These studies suggest that NE cells that develop within prostate tumors may produce neurosecretory factors that contribute to increased malignancy and decreased responsiveness to androgen ablation therapy. The androgen-responsive prostate tumor cell line, LNCaP, has emerged as a useful model for testing the development of a NE phenotype in adenocarcinoma cells with an exocrine phenotype. LNCaP cells have been shown to acquire NE characteristics in response to increased intracellular cAMP levels (18.Bang Y.J. Pirnia F. Fang W.G. Kang W.K. Sartor O. Whitesell L. Ha M.J. Tsokos M.

Treating LNCaP cells with the β-adrenergic receptor agonists epinepherine (Epi) and isoproterenol (Isop) or with the adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin (Fsk), induces the rapid accumulation of intracellular cAMP and acquisition of numerous NE characteristics, including development of neuritic processes; cessation of mitotic activity; increased expression of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and the biogenic amine serotonin; and the release of parathyroid hormone-related peptide and neurotensin into the culture medium (19.Cox M.E. Deeble P.D. Lakhani S. Parsons S.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3821-3830PubMed Google Scholar). However, maintenance of the NE phenotype is lost upon withdrawal of differentiation-inducing agents, resulting in retraction of neuritic processes, reinitiation of mitotic activity, and loss of neuronal marker expression (19.Cox M.E. Deeble P.D. Lakhani S. Parsons S.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3821-3830PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the phenotype of tumor cells may be dynamic and determined in part by the balance of differentiative and mitogenic factors in the local environment. Although cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is often considered essential for mediating the wide range of physiological effects initiated by cAMP, direct evidence for its role is often limited. The recent identification of cAMP-responsive guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rap1 (23.Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M.

Additionally, treatment of LNCaP cells with a butyrate analogue was shown to be sufficient to induce cell cycle arrest (25.Gleave M.E. Sato N. Sadar M. Yago V. Bruchovsky N. Sullivan L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 69: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP) may have antiproliferative effects due to the butyrate component of the reagent and not due to activation of cAMP-dependent effectors. In this report, we establish that PKA activation is sufficient to initiate acquisition of a NE phenotype by LNCaP cells and that PKA activation is required for acquisition of these characteristics by β-adrenergic receptor agonists or Fsk. These results indicate that PKA activation plays a central role in regulating the phenotype of LNCaP cells and suggest that PKA activation may be a novel therapeutic target for controlling NE differentiation in prostatic adenocarcinomas.

The green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing reporter plasmid, pGreen Lantern™, was from Life Technologies, Inc. Plasmids encoding the wild type and mutant isoforms of the PKA catalytic subunit, CIα, and the dominant-negative mutant of the PKA regulatory subunit, RIα, were gifts from Dr. G. S.

CIα subunits were amino-terminally FLAG-tagged by polymerase chain reaction using Pfupolymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to encode the peptide, MDYKDDDDKGP, and placed under the transcriptional control of a Rous Sarcoma virus long terminal repeat promoter in the plasmid, pOPRSV1 (Stratagene). The dominant negative RIα subunit, dnRIα, was provided in a murine metallothionine I promoter-driven expression vector (pMTdnRIα; Ref. 28.Clegg C.H. Correll L.A. Cadd G.G. McKnight G.S. J. Biol.

FLAG-tagged extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 expression plasmid was a gift from Drs. S. Eblin and M. J. Weber (University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA). After treatment, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), lysed in HO buffer (50 mmHEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Noniodet P-40, 2 mmEDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mmsodium vanadate, 40 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 2 μm microcystin, pH 7.2) on ice, and processed for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schuell), as described (29.Ely C.M.

Immunoblotting for FLAG-tagged kinases, NSE, and PKA was performed using the anti-FLAG epitope antibody, M5 (Eastman Kodak Co.), a polyclonal anti-NSE antiserum (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA), and a polyclonal anti-PKA CIα catalytic subunit antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Immunoblots were visualized by ECL using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG or Protein A as appropriate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Relative band intensities were determined by densitometry using ImageQuant software. PKA kinase activity was assessed by immune complex kinase assay derived from previously published protocols (28.Clegg C.H. Correll L.A. Cadd G.G. McKnight G.S. J. Biol.

J. 1990; 267: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were performed from 500 μg of lysate protein using 1 μg of rabbit polyclonal anti-PKA CIα catalytic subunit antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) collected on Protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) or 10 μl of M2 anti-FLAG epitope antibody conjugated to agarose beads (Kodak). Immune complexes were washed 3 times with HO lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.014% Tween 20) and resuspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer. Kinase reactions were started by adding 10 μl of kinase buffer containing 28 μm synthetic PKA peptide substrate, malantide (Sigma), and 1 mm (1 μCi/nmol) [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products) and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. Reactions were terminated by adding 10 μl 1m HCl, and 35 μl of the reaction was spotted onto 1-cm2 strips of phosphocellulose (P81; Whatman). The P81 strips were washed four times for 10 min each in 75 mmH3PO4, washed once in methanol, dried, and counted by Cherenkov radiation. Malantide is a synthetic dodecapeptide corresponding to the PKA phosphorylation site of phosphorylase kinase β-subunit and is efficiently phosphorylated by PKA in vitro (K m = 15 μm;V max = 23 μmol of phosphate transferred min−1 mg−1 (28.Clegg C.H. Correll L.A. Cadd G.G. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13111-13119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Relative PKA-specific activity was determined as pmol of phosphate incorporated into malantide per min per unit of immunoprecipitated PKA CIα (Fig. 1) or FLAG-tagged kinase (Fig. 3) as measured by immunoblotting as described above.Figure 3Expression and kinase activity of FLAG-tagged PKA catalytic subunit expression vectors. LNCaP cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged PKA catalytic subunit (F-CIα,lanes 1 and 2; F-Cqr,lanes 3 and 4) or FLAG-tagged extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (F-ERK2,lanes 5 and 6) expression vectors. Two days after transfection, duplicate plates of cells were left untreated (open bars; lanes 1,3, and 5) or treated with 5 μm Fsk (filled bars; lanes 2,4, and 6) for 10 min. The FLAG-tagged kinases were immunoprecipitated with M2 anti-FLAG antibody and subjected toin vitro kinase assays using malantide as a substrate. Relative PKA kinase activity (pmol of phosphate transferred to malantide min−1 arbitrary unit of immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged kinase−1) was normalized to the activity from untreated, CIα-transfected cells (1.2 pmol of phosphate transferred to malantide min−1). The corresponding immunoblots using anti-PKA CIα antibody (upper panel) or anti-FLAG antibody (lower panel) were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For immunofluorescence analysis, LNCaP cells were plated onto glass coverslips and processed as described previously (31.Chang J.H. Gill S. Settleman J. Parsons S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged CIα or Cqr expression was detected using anti-FLAG antibody, M5, and Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Cells undergoing DNA synthesis were detected by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd; Sigma) labeling, performed by adding 100 μm BrdUrd to the culture medium of cells during the last 20 h of incubation. BrdUrd incorporation into DNA was assessed by immunofluorescence using anti-BrdUrd-fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described by the manufacturer. Assessment of differences in response was performed using analysis of variance models fit using maximum likelihood techniques using single factor analysis of variance models for Figs. 5 A and 6 and multifactor analysis of variance models for Figs. 1, 5 B, and 8. Variance-stabilizing transformations were used when required to meet assumptions of a linear model (constant variance and normally distributed error terms). A natural logarithmic transformation was used for Figs. 1 and 6 that allowed the use of the antilogarithm of pairwise differences to compare the ratio of two quantities (-fold change). The data in Fig. 8 required an arc sine square root (sin−1(√x)) transformation, for which there is no convenient interpretation of a pairwise difference. Therefore, only the relative magnitude and statistical significance of these results were of interest. Type III F-tests were used to determine the importance of effects and interactions. Pairwise comparisons were made at the highest level of complexity that was significant for this test at the 5% level. Confidence intervals for pairwise differences were generated by Fisher's least significant difference method with a comparison type I error rate of 0.05 (32.Hsu J.C. Multiple Comparisons: Theory and Methods. Chapman and Hall, London1996Crossref Google Scholar). A 95% confidence interval that does not contain 0 (or 1 in the case of -fold change) implies statistical significance at the 5% level. Representative photomicrographs and immunoblots are provided to demonstrate the primary data.Figure 6PKA expression is sufficient to induce NSE expression. LNCaP cells were transfected with plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged PKA catalytic subunits (CIα, lane 1; F-Cqr, lane 2) or GFP either left untreated (lane 3) or treated with 0.1 mm Bt2cAMP for 2 days (lane 4). Whole cell lysates (100 μg/lane) were subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-NSE antibody (upper panel of immunoblot and histogram) or M5 anti-FLAG epitope antibody (lower panel of immunoblot). Bovine adrenomedullary chromaffin cell lysate (Chrom.,lane 5; 100 μg) was utilized as a positive control for NSE expression. Statistical significance of the pairwise difference for the ratio of NSE expressed per unit of FLAG-tagged PKA catalytic subunit expressed from CIα to Cqr was averaged from five independent experiments and is described under “Results.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 8Expression of dominant-negative PKA regulatory subunit, RIα, inhibits Epi -, Isop -, and Fsk-induced acquisition of a NE morphology.

Cells were left unstimulated (U) or stimulated with 10 μm Epi (E), Isop (I), or Fsk (F) and either not treated (No Trt.) or treated with Cd/Zn. For each treatment, the morphology of 50–100 GFP-positive cells was determined from at least five random fields. GFP-positive cells were scored for the NE phenotype as defined by cells with neuritic processes at least 2 times the length of the cell body (% Neurite-Bearing Cells). Statistical significance of pairwise differences for each stimulation condition of both transfectants in the presence or absence of Cd/Zn was performed as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” †, p < 0.05 for the indicated treatment pairs. † indicates those treatment pairs for which acquisition of NE morphology was significantly different.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our previous studies demonstrated that LNCaP cells treated with Epi, Isop, or Fsk induced an increase in cytosolic cAMP levels and the reversible acquisition of a number of NE characteristics. We measured PKA-specific kinase activity from LNCaP cells acutely stimulated with these agents to assess their ability to mediate activation of PKA. PKA-specific kinase activity was significantly increased (∼4-fold) in lysates from LNCaP cells treated with Fsk or Isop as compared with that of lysates from unstimulated cells or cells stimulated with IL-6 or EGF (Fig.1). Additionally, the kinase activity immunoprecipitated from untreated cells could be significantly inhibited (∼80%) by addition of the PKA inhibitor, H89, to the kinase assay. These results establish that PKA is activated in LNCaP cells under treatment conditions that induce the acquisition of NE characteristics. To directly assess whether activated PKA was sufficient to induce acquisition of NE characteristics by LNCaP cells, we employed cDNAs encoding amino-terminal FLAG-tagged wild type PKA catalytic subunit, CIα, or constitutively activated mutant, Cqr, which is unable to bind PKA regulatory subunit in the absence of cAMP due to the point mutations, H87Q and W196R (27.Orellana S.A. McKnight G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4726-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). LNCaP cells were transiently transfected with equal amounts of plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged CIα, Cqr, or extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 and assessed for expression and PKA-specific kinase activity (Fig. 3). The CIα and Cqr subunits were readily detected in anti-CIα immunoblots of anti-FLAG immunoprecipitations from the appropriately transfected populations (Fig. 3 B, upper panel), while similar levels of all three kinase constructs were detected in anti-FLAG epitope immunoblots of anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates (Fig.3 B, lower panel). When normalized to the amount of FLAG-tagged kinase immunoprecipitated, the PKA kinase activity from Cqr-transfected cells was ∼2-fold greater than the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitated activity detected in CIα-transfected cells stimulated with Fsk and ∼5-fold greater than the activity of unstimulated CIα-transfected cells (Fig.3 A). Treatment of Cqr-transfected cells with Fsk had no discernible effect on FLAG-precipitated PKA kinase activity. FLAG-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2-transfected LNCaP cells exhibited a basal level of malantide phosphorylating activity equivalent to one-tenth the activity detected from unstimulated, CIα-transfected, cells. This basal activity was independent of Fsk stimulation. Each construct has been assessed three times with similar results, indicating that tagging and subcloning these constructs did not affect the previously reported differences in enzymatic activity attributed to these CIα isoforms (27.Orellana S.A. McKnight G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4726-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We have established that treatment of LNCaP cells with β-adrenergic receptor agonists or Fsk increases intracellular cAMP levels (19.Cox M.E. Deeble P.D. Lakhani S. Parsons S.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3821-3830PubMed Google Scholar) and PKA activity (Fig. 1). To determine whether expression of activated PKA catalytic subunit was sufficient to induce acquisition of NE characteristics in LNCaP cells, we compared the morphology of cells cotransfected with empty vector or CIα- or Cqr-expressing plasmids along with the GFP reporter plasmid. Three days after transfection, cells were fixed and stained for the FLAG epitope. When either the Cqr- or CIα-containing plasmid was transfected into LNCaP cells along with the GFP reporter plasmid at a 5:1 molar ratio, greater than 95% of the GFP-positive cells were also positive for the FLAG epitope. Transient transfection of LNCaP cells routinely resulted in ∼30% of the cells in the population being transfected. These observations allowed us to compare the morphology of PKA subunit-transfected cells with both the untransfected cells and cells cotransfected with GFP along with empty pRSV1 vector. Cqr-transfected cells exhibited a distinct NE morphology, including the elaboration of long branched processes (Fig.4, D and E) terminated with well defined growth cones (Fig. 4, G andH), while the surrounding untransfected cells and cells transfected with CIα (Fig. 4, A–C, F, andI) exhibited morphologies typical of untreated LNCaP cells. Greater than 80% of the Cqr-transfected cells exhibited a NE morphology (cells with processes greater than two cell bodies (40 μm) in length). This was significantly greater than the less than 20% of the CIα- or empty vector-transfected cells determined to exhibit such morphological characteristics (Fig.5 A). These results indicate that activation of PKA alone is sufficient to induce the NE differentiation morphology in LNCaP cells. We previously showed that Fsk- and Epi-induced acquisition of NE characteristics included the cessation of mitotic activity. We therefore assessed the mitotic activity of the PKA catalytic subunit-transfected cells cultured for 3 days in T-Media containing 5% FBS, serum-free and phenol red-free RPMI 1640 (S-F), or phenol red-free RPMI 1640 containing 5% charcoal-stripped FBS (CS-FBS) to characterize the extent to which the different transfections affected the LNCaP phenotype. Under all conditions tested, the rate of BrdUrd incorporation observed in the Cqr-transfected cells was significantly reduced as compared with that of the CIα-transfected cells (Fig.5 B) with the exception of the case discussed below. Furthermore, the rate of BrdUrd incorporation observed in CIα-transfected cells was indistinguishable from that of the untransfected cells (data not shown). Approximately 48% of the CIα-transfected cells grown in FBS were positive for BrdUrd at the end of the 20-h labeling indicating a doubling time of about 2 days. This is in excellent agreement with the previously reported doubling time for LNCaP cells (26.Thalmann G.N. Anezinis P.E. Chang S.M. Zhau H.E. Kim E.E. Hopwood V.L. Pathak S. von Eschenbach A.C. Chung L.W. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2577-2581PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Horoszewicz J.S. Leong S.S. Kawinski E. Karr J.P. Rosenthal H. Chu T.M. Mirand E.A. Murphy G.P. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 1809-1818PubMed Google Scholar) and indicates that the doubling time of transfected cells had not been influenced by expression of the wild type CIα subunit. The level of BrdUrd incorporation observed in Cqr-transfected cells cultured in FBS was comparable with the level of inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation observed in LNCaP cells treated with Bt2cAMP, Fsk, or Epi (19.Cox M.E. Deeble P.D. Lakhani S. Parsons S.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3821-3830PubMed Google Scholar) and indistinguishable from that observed in CIα-transfected cells cultured under S-F conditions (Fig. 5 B). This latter condition has been reported to induce growth arrest and eventual acquisition of NE characteristics in LNCaP cells (20.Shen R. Dorai T. Szaboles M. Katz A.E. Olsson C.A. Buttyan R. Urol. Res. 1997; 3: 67-75Google Scholar). These results indicate that, even under optimal growth conditions, expression of Cqr is sufficient to reduce the mitotic activity level of transfected cells to that observed for untransfected or CIα-transfected cells under S-F conditions. Additionally, while the rate of BrdUrd incorporation observed in CIα-expressing cells under charcoal-stripped FBS conditions was significantly greater than that of cells under S-F conditions, the BrdUrd incorporation rate of the Cqr-expressing cells under the same conditions were indistinguishable (Fig. 5 B). These results indicate that while androgen withdrawal had a modest impact on the mitotic activity of LNCaP cells, it significantly increased the susceptibility of LNCaP cells to PKA activation by initiating cell cycle arrest. To further characterize the extent to which activation of PKA affected the LNCaP phenotype, we assessed the expression of NSE in cells transfected with the FLAG-tagged PKA catalytic subunit vectors (Fig. 6). For comparison, NSE levels were measured from lysates of LNCaP cells transfected with a GFP expression plasmid and cultured for 2 days in the presence or absence of Bt2cAMP and from lyastes of bovine adrenomedullary chromaffin cells. As compared with untreated GFP-transfected cells, NSE expression was ∼5-fold higher in CIα-transfected cells and ∼60-fold higher in Cqr-transfected cells. NSE expression in Cqr-transfected cells was ∼35% of that detected in Bt2cAMP-treated GFP-transfected cells. To compare the NSE levels in cells transfected with CIα or Cqr, the NSE/FLAG ratio of CIα-transfected cells was normalized and compared with the NSE/FLAG ratio of Cqr-transfected cells for five independent experiments using the pairwise difference described under “Experimental Procedures.” By this analysis, Cqr-transfected cells expressed significantly more NSE than CIα-transfected cells (-fold change (95% confidence interval) = 8.5 (4.8, 15.2)). These results are in agreement with the morphologic and mitotic activity data and indicate that expression of PKA is sufficient to induce acquisition of a NE phenotype by LNCaP cells. To determine if PKA activation is required for Fsk or β-adrenergic receptor agonists to mediate acquisition of NE characteristics, LNCaP cells were transfected with pMTdnRIα in which expression of a dominant-negative mutant of the PKA regulatory subunit, RIα, is induced in response to treatment with Cd/Zn (Fig. 2). This construct contains mutations at site A (G200E) and site B (G324D, R332H), which render it unresponsive to cAMP and maintain the catalytic subunit in an inactive conformation even in the presence of increased intracellular cAMP levels (28.Clegg C.H. Correll L.A. Cadd G.G. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13111-13119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LNCaP cells were cotransfected with pMTdnRIα or pcDNA3 as a control plasmid along with the GFP reporter plasmid. Transfected cells were cultured in medium with or without Cd/Zn, in the presence or absence of Fsk for 3 days before assessing the morphology of the transfected and untransfected cells (Fig. 7). In the absence of Cd/Zn, pMTdnRIα-transfected, Fsk-stimulated LNCaP cells acquired a NE morphology indistinguishable from that of the untransfected cells (Fig. 7, A and B). However, in the presence of Cd/Zn, pMTdnRIα-transfected, Fsk-stimulated cells retained the typically fusiform LNCaP morphology, while the surrounding cells acquired a NE morphology (Fig. 7, C–F). The effect of RIα expression on acquisition of a NE phenotype in response to induction by Fsk, Epi, and Isop was quantitatively assessed for three independent sets of transfected and treated cells (Fig.8). Because of the relatively high endogenous levels of PKA regulatory subunit in LNCaP cells, we were unable to determine the fold induction of RIα expression in the transfected cells. However, treatment of RIα-transfected cells with Cd/Zn significantly inhibited the ability of Isop-, Epi- or Fsk-stimulated cells to acquire a NE morphology. These results suggest that PKA signaling is required for LNCaP cells to acquire NE characteristics in response to β-adrenergic agonists and Fsk, further supporting the idea that activated PKA is involved in controlling cAMP-mediated NE differentiation in prostatic adenocarcinomas. NE cells are found in essentially all prostatic adenocarcinomas, and since these cells produce factors capable of affecting the proliferative and metastatic state of prostate tumor cells, the potential role of NE differentiation in prostatic cancer progression is of interest. However, the lack of a consensus concerning the prognostic value of tumor NE status clearly indicates that a more accurate assessment of the potential significance of NE differentiation in the progression of prostatic disease is needed. In this report, we used the LNCaP cell line to demonstrate directly that activated PKA plays an essential role in mediating the acquisition of NE characteristics induced by β-adrenergic receptor agonists and activators of adenylate cyclase. This conclusion is based on our demonstration 1) that these agents induce activation of PKA kinase activity, 2) that ectopic expression of an activated isoform of PKA catalytic subunit is sufficient to initiate acquisition of NE characteristics by these cells, and 3) that inhibition of PKA signaling by expressing a dominant-negative isoform of the PKA regulatory subunit is capable of inhibiting the ability of β-adrenergic receptor agonists and activators of adenylate cyclase to induce NE differentiation. We have measured acquisition of a neuritic morphology and inhibition of mitotic activity because these were the most readily quantifiable measures of NE differentiation applicable to the single-cell assays utilized here, and because these changes in morphology and mitotic activity were completely coincident with the expression of the NE markers, NSE (Fig. 6), serotonin, parathyroid hormone-related peptide, and neurotensin (19.Cox M.E. Deeble P.D. Lakhani S. Parsons S.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3821-3830PubMed Google Scholar). These results, coupled with our previous report (19.Cox M.E. Deeble P.D. Lakhani S. Parsons S.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3821-3830PubMed Google Scholar) indicating that cAMP-mediated acquisition of NE characteristics in LNCaP cells is completely reversible, such that maintenance of the NE phenotype requires the continual presence of differentiating agents, implicate PKA as a central player in mediating NE differentiation in adenocarcinomas. The prostate has been demonstrated to be a rich source of α1- and β2-adrenergic receptors with both adrenergic and cholinergic innervation into the glandular epithelia (34.McVary K.T. McKenna K.E. Lee C. Prostate. 1998; 8 (Suppl.): 2-13Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Moreover, β-adrenergic receptor agonists have been implicated in the maintenance of prostate homeostasis and as mitogens for prostatic stromal cells (35.Thompson T.C. Zhau H. Chung L.W.K. Coffey D.S. Bruchovsky N. Gardner W.A. Resnick M.I. Karr J.P. Current Concepts and Approaches to the Study of Prostate Cancer. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1987: 239-248Google Scholar). Perhaps the requirement for continual cAMP signaling for the maintenance of a NE phenotype in LNCaP cells reflects a normal requirement for β-adrenergic signaling for proper prostatic function. A potentially strong selective advantage is provided to tumors that, in response to factors either present (such as catecholamines) or absent (such as androgens) in their environment, can reversibly generate cells that serve as endocrine/paracrine sources and are themselves nonproliferative and androgen-independent. Our observations indicating that PKA activation initiates acquisition of NE characteristics and that these effects are accentuated under conditions of androgen withdrawal (Fig. 5 B) suggest that the LNCaP cell line provides just such a model. The use of LNCaP cell lines expressing wild type and mutant isoforms of components of the PKA signaling pathway should provide systems to critically evaluate the outstanding issues concerning control of NE differentiation and the possible influence NE cells have on prostate cancer progression. We thank Drs. L. W. Chung and R. Sikes for providing LNCaP cell lines and advice on their maintenance, Dr. G. S. McKnight for providing the PKA subunit cDNAs, and Drs. C. E. Meyers, M. J. Weber, J. T. Parsons, and D. Theodorescu for conceptual insights."

By using the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel member of the syntaxin family, syntaxin 18, that binds to α-soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor-attachment protein. Subcellular fractionation and immunocytochemical analysis revealed that syntaxin 18 is principally located in the endoplasmic reticulum. We examined the effect of overexpression of FLAG-tagged syntaxin 18 and a mutant lacking the N-terminal 81 amino acid residues on protein transport and organelles in the early secretory pathway. Both expressed proteins localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, and the expressed FLAG-syntaxin 18 caused remarkable aggregation of endoplasmic reticulum membranes. Although expression of the FLAG-syntaxin 18 lacking the N-terminal region produced less effect on the morphology of the endoplasmic reticulum, dispersion of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment and cis-Golgi was elicited. Moreover, overexpression of the FLAG-syntaxin 18 mutant inhibited protein export from the endoplasmic reticulum. These results taken together suggest that syntaxin 18 functions in transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi.

Transport vesicles are formed from donor compartments and are targeted to acceptor compartments, where they deliver cargo molecules through membrane fusion. The docking and/or fusion of transport vesicles with target membranes is mediated by the SNAP1 receptor (SNARE) machinery (1.Rothman J.E. Warren G. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 220-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The original SNARE hypothesis predicts that the docking of transport vesicles to target membranes is mediated by the specific pairing of v-SNAREs (members of the VAMP or synaptobrevin family) on transport vesicles with t-SNAREs (members of the syntaxin and SNAP-25 families) on target membranes (2.Bennett M.K.

The presence of many isoforms of t- and v-SNAREs that uniquely localize to different membrane compartments may provide a basis for the specificity of the docking step in different transport pathways (2.Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2559-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). A recent study, however, suggests that a simple one to one pairing of SNAREs is not sufficient to account for the specificity of vesicle docking and fusion (5.Yang B. Gonzalez Jr., L. Prekeris R.

Protein transport from the ER to the Golgi occurs in both forward (anterograde) and backward (retrograde) directions. Proteins are transported via the anterograde pathway from the ER to the Golgi, where ER resident proteins are specifically captured in a receptor-dependent manner and retrieved via the retrograde pathway (6.Lewis M.J.

COPII vesicles, which contain the small GTPase Sar1p and two heterodimers (Sec23p-Sec24p and Sec13p-Sec31p) (14.Barlowe C. Orci L. Yeung T. Hosobuchi M. Hamamoto S. Salama N. Rexach M.F. Ravazzola M.

The COPII coat is likely replaced with COPI in the transit to the intermediate compartment, an organelle between the ER and Golgi termed the ERGIC or vesicular tubular clusters (16.Aridor M.

Yeast COPI- and COPII-coated vesicles contain three types of SNAREs (Bos1p, Bet1p, and Sec22p) (15.Bednarek S.Y. Ravazzola M. Hosobuchi M. Amherdt M. Perrelet A. Schekman R. Orci L.

Science. 1997; 276: 1255-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). A recent reconstitution study revealed that Bos1p is required for only anterograde transport, Bet1p for only retrograde transport, and Sec22p is involved in both anterograde and retrograde directions (25.Spang A. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Sec22p interacts both with Ufe1p, a potential retrograde t-SNARE located in the ER, and with Sed5p in the Golgi (26.Lewis M.J. Rayner J.C. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3017-3024Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Ufe1p also interacts with Cdc48p and likely plays a role in ER membrane fusion during karyogamy (27.Patel S.K. Indig F.E. Olivieri N. Levine N.D. Latterich M. Cell. 1998; 92: 611-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Biochemical analyses and EST data base analysis revealed the presence of many mammalian SNAREs that participate in transport between the ER and Golgi. Those include membrin, rBet1, rSec22b, and syntaxin 5, which correspond to Bos1p, Bet1p, Sec22p, and Sed5p, respectively, in yeast (28.Bennett M.K. Garcia-Arrarás J.E. Elferink L.A. Peterson K.

One possibility is that the Ufe1p homologue does not exist in mammalian cells; instead, syntaxin 5 plays a role as a t-SNARE in the ER as well as in the Golgi apparatus. Previous studies showed that the 41- and 34-kDa forms of syntaxin 5 are present in the ER and Golgi, respectively (35.Hui N. Nakamura N. Sönnichsen B. Shima D.T. Nilsson T. Warren G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1777-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 36.Hay J.C. Klumperman J. Oorschot V. Steegmaier M. Kuo C.S. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1489-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In this paper we report a novel syntaxin species (designated syntaxin 18) that was identified as an α-SNAP-interacting protein in our yeast two-hybrid screening. Morphological and functional analyses revealed that syntaxin 18 is principally located in the ER and functions in transport between the ER and Golgi. The full cDNA of bovine α-SNAP was subcloned into the yeast expression vector pGBT9 usingEcoRI and BamHI (pGBT-α-SNAP). The pGBT-α-SNAP plasmid was transformed into yeast strain HF7c, and a yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out essentially according to the manufacturer's protocol using a GAL4 DNA activation domain fusion library in pGAD10 (MATCHMAKER human leukocyte cDNA library,CLONTECH). Positive clones were isolated by growth selection on plates lacking Trp, Leu, and His followed by β-galactosidase filter assays. The isolated clones were sequenced with an automated DNA sequencer (ABI PRISMTM377; Applied Biosystems). One of the clones encoded a novel syntaxin family member. The insert of this clone was used to screen a human brain cDNA library. A full-length cDNA was isolated using standard plaque hybridization techniques. Subcellular fractionation was conducted essentially as described previously (37.Subramaniam V.N. bin Mohd. Yusoff A.R. Wong S.H. Lim G.B. Chew M. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12016-12021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Livers from Wistar rats that fasted overnight were removed, rinsed once in homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA), and then weighed. The livers were perfused with homogenization buffer, cut into small pieces, and then mashed by passing through a stainless steel sieve (150-μm mesh). To the mashed livers were added 4 volumes (g/ml) of homogenization buffer and then homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer (5 strokes). The homogenate was centrifuged at 600 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min and then at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) was collected, and the total membrane pellet was suspended in 7 ml of homogenization buffer. The sucrose concentration of the suspension was adjusted to 1.17m by adding 2.0 m sucrose in homogenization buffer and then overlaid on gradients of 8 ml of 1.15 msucrose, 10 ml of 0.86 m sucrose, and 8 ml of 0.25m sucrose in homogenization buffer. The gradients were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 3 h, and then four fractions, the G1 fraction at 0.25 m, 0.86m sucrose interphase, the G2 fraction at 0.86m, 1.15 m sucrose interphase, the smooth ER fraction at upper portion of 1.17 m sucrose phase, and the rough ER pellet, were obtained. Membranes of the G1, G2, and smooth ER fractions were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min following dilution with 1 mm EDTA. An antibody to syntaxin 18 was raised against a protein lacking the TMD (His6-syntaxin 18ΔTMD) that was expressed in Escherichia coli using pQE31 (Qiagen). The expressed protein in inclusion bodies was solubilized with guanidine hydrochloride and purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The purified protein was mixed with Z-Max adjuvant (Zonagen) and injected subcutaneously into two Japanese White rabbits every 3 weeks. An antibody against syntaxin 18 was purified on affinity chromatography of Sepharose 4B coupled with His6-syntaxin 18ΔTMD. Similarly, an antibody against a recombinant syntaxin 5 was prepared. Preparation of Fab fragments and their isolation were carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol (Bio-Rad). Polyclonal antibodies against mouse Sec22b, membrin, and rBet1 were prepared as described previously (36.Hay J.C. Klumperman J. Oorschot V. Steegmaier M. Kuo C.S. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1489-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody against protein disulfide isomerase was prepared as described (38.Akagi S. Yamamoto A. Yoshimori T. Masaki R. Ogawa R. Tashiro Y. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1988; 36: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The method for the preparation of polyclonal anti-Man II will be described elsewhere. Monoclonal anti-ERGIC-53/p58 and polyclonal anti-β-COP were generous gifts from Dr. H.-P. Hauri (University of Basel, Switzerland) and Dr. Yamaguchi of this laboratory, respectively. Anti-GM130 and anti-calnexin were obtained from Transduction Laboratories. Monoclonal anti-Man II was obtained from Babco. The mammalian expression plasmids pEBG (kindly donated from Dr. B. Mayer of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and pFLAG-CMV-2 (Eastman Kodak Co.) were used to express proteins fused with the N-terminal GST for α-SNAP and with the N-terminal FLAG epitope for syntaxin 18, syntaxin 18Δ81, syntaxin 5, and p47. To perform in vivo α-SNAP binding assays, COS7 cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 7.5% fetal calf serum were transfected with the expression plasmids using a LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. At 24 h after transfection, the cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer (0.25 ml/35-mm dish) consisting of 20 mmHEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1% Triton X-100. The lysates were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 15,000 rpm to remove insoluble materials. The supernatant (250 μl) was incubated with an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein G-agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was then added and allowed to incubate for 15 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. The beads were sedimented in a microcentrifuge and washed three times with lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitated proteins were dissociated from the beads by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Five percent (12.5 μl) of the total lysate was mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels, blotted, and immunostained with an anti-FLAG M2 antibody and an anti-α-SNAP polyclonal antibody using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as the detection method. A rat liver total membrane fraction was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min, and the resulting membrane pellet was solubilized in lysis buffer. The solubilized membrane proteins were incubated with a polyclonal antibody against syntaxin 18 or syntaxin 5 for 30 min 4 °C, and the immune complexes were collected with protein A-agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The beads were washed with lysis buffer three times (each for 15 min), and then the proteins bound on the beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with polyclonal antibodies against mouse Sec22b, membrin, and rBet1 using ECL. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described (39.Tagaya M. Furuno A. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 466-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed with methanol at −20 °C for 5 min for endogenous syntaxin 18 or with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature for expressed proteins. Confocal microscopy was performed on a Olympus Fluoview 300 laser scanning microscope. Electron microscopy was performed as described (40.Yamaguchi T. Yamamoto A. Furuno A. Hatsuzawa K. Tani K. Himeno M. Tagaya M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25260-25266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The expression plasmid for VSVG-GFP was kindly donated from Dr. J. Lippincott-Schwartz (National Institutes of Health). The plasmid was cotransfected with the plasmid for FLAG-syntaxin 18Δ81 or FLAG-syntaxin 5 into Vero cells. The cells were incubated at 40 °C for 15 h to allow the expression of proteins and then shifted to 32 °C for 30 min to measure the transport of VSVG-GFP from the ER to the Golgi. We screened a human leukocyte expression library using a full-length α-SNAP cDNA as a bait in the yeast two-hybrid system. Forty two clones positive for both His− cell growth and β-galactosidase expression were isolated. Most of the positive clones encoded known syntaxin family members. However, one clone encoded a novel protein that displays homology to syntaxin family proteins. A complete cDNA was isolated by screening a human brain cDNA library. Sequence analysis showed an open reading frame encoding a novel syntaxin (termed syntaxin 18) that consists of 335 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 38,673 (Fig. 1 A). Like other syntaxins, syntaxin 18 possesses a putative TMD near the C terminus and predicted coiled-coil regions. A BLAST search revealed that syntaxin 18 shares 27.8% identity (43.6% similarity) to the Caenorhabditis elegans T10H9 predicted gene product (Fig. 1 B). Syntaxin 18 does not show conspicuous sequence similarities to known syntaxins and their yeast homologues. The most similar one is Ufe1p, a t-SNARE implicated in both retrograde transport (41.Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1996; 85: 205-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and ER membrane fusion (27.Patel S.K. Indig F.E. Olivieri N. Levine N.D. Latterich M. Cell. 1998; 92: 611-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) inSaccharomyces cerevisiae, but the overall sequence identity is only 11.9% (22.7% similarity). The low sequence similarities between syntaxin 18 and other known syntaxin species may explain why syntaxin 18 has not been discovered by extensive EST data base searches. To confirm the yeast two-hybrid interaction in mammalian cells, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments. Lysates of COS7 cells coexpressing syntaxin 18 tagged with the FLAG epitope at the N terminus (FLAG-syntaxin 18) and GST-tagged α-SNAP (GST-α-SNAP) were incubated with an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-α-SNAP and anti-FLAG antibodies. As positive and negative controls, we expressed FLAG-syntaxin 5 and FLAG-p47, respectively, and carried out similar experiments. Syntaxin 5 is a t-SNARE that resides mostly in the ERGIC and the cis-Golgi region (35.Hui N. Nakamura N. Sönnichsen B. Shima D.T. Nilsson T. Warren G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1777-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 36.Hay J.C. Klumperman J. Oorschot V. Steegmaier M. Kuo C.S. Scheller R.H. J.

Science. 1998; 279: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). p47 competes with α-SNAP for biding to syntaxin 5 but does not bind to α-SNAP (43.Rabouille C. Kondo H. Newman R. Hui N. Freemont P. Warren G. Cell. 1998; 92: 603-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, GST-α-SNAP was coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-syntaxin 18 as well as with FLAG-syntaxin 5 but not with FLAG-p47. These results suggest that syntaxin 18 interacts specifically with α-SNAP. To characterize further syntaxin 18, we produced a rabbit polyclonal antibody against a bacterially expressed fusion protein. On immunoblot analysis of rat liver and several cell lines including HeLa, COS7, and NRK, the affinity purified antibody specifically detected a protein of 42 kDa, which is in close agreement with the calculated mass of syntaxin 18 (data not shown). A ubiquitous expression of this protein was confirmed by Northern blotting. A transcript of 1.8 kilobase pairs was detected in tissues including heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas (data not shown). We next sought to determine the subcellular localization of syntaxin 18. Total membranes were prepared from the postnuclear supernatant of rat liver homogenates. They were further separated by sucrose gradient centrifugation into the rough ER membranes (rER), smooth ER membranes (sER), G2 membranes (a fraction at the 0.86 m, 1.15 m sucrose interface), and G1 membranes (a fraction at the 0.25 m, 0.86 m sucrose interface). Each fraction was analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against syntaxin 18 and markers of the ER (calnexin and the 41-kDa form of syntaxin 5) and Golgi (Man II and the 34-kDa form of syntaxin 5) (Fig. 3). The results of immunoblotting with marker proteins clearly demonstrate that adequate fractionation was achieved. Syntaxin 18 was found to be enriched in the sER fraction although it was detected to a lower extent in the rER and Golgi fractions. Localization of syntaxin 18 was also investigated by indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Syntaxin 18 in HeLa cells displayed a tubular/reticular ER-like localization (Fig.4 A), which overlapped significantly with that of calnexin (Fig. 4 B), but not with that of ERGIC-53/p58 (Fig. 4 D), an ERGIC marker protein (44.Saraste J.

Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1643-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), or GM-130 (Fig. 4 F), a cis-Golgi protein involved in the tethering of COPI vesicles to Golgi membranes (46.Nakamura N.

These subcellular fractionation and immunohistochemical analyses suggest that syntaxin 18 is principally located in the ER. Overexpression of mouse Sec22b or membrin disrupts normal morphology of the ERGIC and Golgi (31.Hay J.C. Chao D.S. Kuo C.S. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1997; 89: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of overexpression of syntaxin 18 on the morphology of the organelles in the early secretory pathway. When FLAG-syntaxin 18 was expressed in HeLa cells, protein disulfide isomerase, an ER marker protein, displayed dot-like structures, in which the overexpressed syntaxin 18 was localized (Fig. 5). Electron microscopic analysis showed the presence of aggregated membrane structures in cells expressing syntaxin 18 (Fig.6). In these cells Golgi stacks were not seen, instead small vesicles were observed at the perinuclear region. On the other hand, no significant morphological changes were observed in organelles such as mitochondria, lysosomes, and peroxisomes (Fig. 6and data not shown), suggesting that overexpression of syntaxin 18 specifically affects the structures of organelles involved in the early secretory pathway. When a syntaxin 18 mutant lacking N-terminal 81-amino acid residues (syntaxin 18Δ81) was expressed, it was located in the ER (Fig. 5). ER aggregates were observed only when the syntaxin 18 mutant was highly expressed.Figure 6Electron microscopic analysis of HeLa cells expressing FLAG-syntaxin 18.

This unequivocally excludes the possibility that the formation of ER aggregates is an artifact due to the overexpression of a FLAG tag version of syntaxin 18. We wanted to examine morphological changes of the ERGIC and Golgi without remarkable changes of the ER structure. For this purpose, we chose FLAG-syntaxin 18Δ81 because it produced less of an effect on the ER structure compared with the full-length construct. In control HeLa cells, ERGIC-53/p58 was distributed in small vesicles and reticular structures mostly concentrated to the perinuclear Golgi region (Fig. 7). Overexpression of FLAG-syntaxin 18Δ81 caused a dispersion of the perinuclear staining of ERGIC-53/p58. A similar but more marked effect was observed in the distribution of β-COP, a component of COPI vesicles (20.Serafini T. Stenbeck G. Brecht A. Lottspeich F. Orci L. Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Nature. 1991; 349: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 48.Duden R. Griffiths G. Frank R. Argos P. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1991; 64: 649-665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Staining for GM130 was also dispersed. Overexpression of FLAG-syntaxin 5 caused similar changes in the distribution of β-COP and GM130, although the dispersion of GM130 was not remarkable compared with that of β-COP (Fig.8). In contrast, no significant change was observed for the staining pattern of ERGIC-53/p58. Thus, the overexpression of syntaxin 18 and syntaxin 5 causes similar but different morphological changes of the compartments along the early secretory pathway, suggesting that the two syntaxins participate in the organization of the ER and Golgi in similar but distinct manners. We wondered whether disorganization of the ERGIC and Golgi caused by overexpression of syntaxin 18Δ81 may be due to a defect in transport from the ER to the Golgi. To test this possibility, we measured the transport of VSVG-GFP from the ER to the Golgi. This mutant protein resides in the ER at nonpermissive temperature (40 °C) and is exported from the ER at permissive temperature (32 °C) (49.Presley J.F. Cole N.B. Schroer T.A. Hirschberg K. Zaal K.J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nature. 1997; 389: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Cells were cotransfected with the FLAG-syntaxin 18Δ81 and VSVG-GFP constructs and then incubated at 40 °C for 15 h. The two proteins were colocalized in the ER at 40 °C (data not shown). When temperature was shifted to 32 °C, and the cells were incubated for 30 min, VSVG-GFP was still localized in the ER in cells expressing FLAG-syntaxin 1"

ChiA1 is a glycosidase that hydrolyzes chitin and is composed of an N-terminal catalytic domain, two fibronectin type III-like domains, and C-terminal ChBDChiA1 (45 residues, Ala655–Gln699), which binds specifically to insoluble chitin. ChBDChiA1 has a compact and globular structure with the topology of a twisted β-sandwich. This domain contains two antiparallel β-sheets, one composed of three strands and the other of two strands. The core region formed by the hydrophobic and aromatic residues makes the overall structure rigid and compact. The overall topology of ChBDChiA1 is similar to that of the cellulose-binding domain (CBD) of Erwinia chrysanthemiendoglucanase Z (CBDEGZ). However, ChBDChiA1lacks the three aromatic residues aligned linearly and exposed to the solvent, which probably interact with cellulose in CBDs. Therefore, the binding mechanism of a group of ChBDs including ChBDChiA1may be different from that proposed for CBDs.

Chitinases are found in a wide variety of organisms that possess chitin as a constituent (fungi, insects, and crustaceans) and organisms that do not possess chitin as well (bacteria, plants, and vertebrates). The roles of chitinases in these organisms are diverse (1.Jolles P. Muzzarelli R.A.A. Chitin and Chitinases. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel1999Crossref Google Scholar). Invertebrates require chitinases for partial degradation of old exoskeletons. Fungi produce chitinases to modify chitin, which is used as an important cell wall component. Bacteria produce chitinases to digest chitin and utilize it as carbon and energy sources. It is suggested that the production of chitinases by higher plants is a part of defense mechanisms against fungal pathogens (2.Boller T. Key J.L. Kosuge T. Cellular and Molecular Biology of Plant Stress. Alan R. Liss Inc., New York1985: 247-262Google Scholar). Bacillus circulans WL-12 is a Gram-positive bacterium identified as being lytic for yeast and fungal cell walls (3.Tanaka H. Phaff H.J. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 89: 1570-1580Crossref Google Scholar). The bacterium has been reported to secrete multiple chitinases into culture medium containing chitin as an inducer (4.Watanabe T. Oyanagi W. Suzuki K. Tanaka H. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4017-4022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Alam M.M. Mizutani T. Isono M. Nikaidou N. Watanabe T. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1996; 82: 28-36Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Among these chitinases, A1 encoded by the chiA gene is thought to be the key enzyme in the chitinase system of this bacterium, because chitinase A1 (ChiA1)1 is produced most abundantly and exhibits the highest activity as to the hydrolysis of colloidal chitin (4.Watanabe T. Oyanagi W. Suzuki K. Tanaka H. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4017-4022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a high affinity to insoluble chitin. ChiA1 (M r = ∼74,000) contains three discrete functional domains: an N-terminal catalytic domain (CatD) (417 amino acid residues), a tandem repeat of fibronectin type III-like (FnIII) domains (duplicate 95 residues), and a C-terminal chitin-binding domain (45 residues) (6.Watanabe T. Ito Y. Yamada T. Hashimoto M. Sekine S. Tanaka H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4465-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Such a structural form of discrete catalytic and substrate-binding domains (7.Cohen-Kupiec R. Chet I. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1998; 9: 270-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) as in ChiA1 has also been observed for some other polysaccharide-degrading enzymes, including cellulases (8.Brun E. Moriaud F.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 186-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal chitin-binding domain (ChBDChiA1) is required for ChiA1 to bind specifically to insoluble chitin and to hydrolyze it efficiently (4.Watanabe T. Oyanagi W. Suzuki K. Tanaka H. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4017-4022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Watanabe T. Ito Y. Yamada T. Hashimoto M. Sekine S. Tanaka H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4465-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). We have found that ChBDChiA1 does not bind to chito-oligosaccharides or soluble derivatives of chitin but does bind to insoluble or crystalline chitin. 2Hashimoto, M., Ikegami, T., Seino, S., Ohuchi, N., Fukada, H., Sugiyama, J., Shirakawa, M., and Watanabe, T. (2000)J. Bacteriol. 182, in press. So far, two roles of the cellulose-binding domains (CBDs) of cellulases in their hydrolysis activities have been suggested: (i) CBDs may enhance the cellulase activities by concentrating the cellulases on a cellulose surface (13.Gilkes N.R. Warren R.A. Miller Jr., R.C. Kilburn D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10401-10407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,14.Tomme P. Van Tilbeurgh H. Pettersson G. Van Damme J. Vandekerckhove J. Knowles J. Teeri T. Claeyssens M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 170: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), and (ii) CBDs may disrupt noncovalent interactions including hydrogen bonds between adjacent glucose units (15.Din N. Gilkes N.R. Tekant B. Miller R.C. Warren R.A.J. Kilburn D.G. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 1096-1099Crossref Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The chitin-binding domains (ChBDs) are also considered to have similar roles to those of CBDs, but the roles of ChBDs remain unclear. Although a large number of studies have been performed on the structures of the CBDs of cellulases (8.Brun E. Moriaud F. Gans P. Blackledge M.J. Barras F. Marion D.

Biol. 1997; 4: 810-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), little is known about the tertiary structures of the ChBDs of chitinases. The structures of at least three chitinases have already been determined. They are (i) endochitinase from barley seeds, Hordeum vulgare (22.Hart P.J. Pfluger H.D. Monzingo A.F. Hollis T. Robertus J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 402-413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), (ii) hevamine with combined chitinase and lysozyme activities from a plant, Hevea brasiliensis (23.Scheltinga A.C.T. Hennig M. Dijkstra B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and (iii) chitinase A from a Gram-negative soil bacterium, Serratia marcescens (24.Perrakis A. Tews I. Dauter Z. Oppenheim A.B. Chet I. Wilson K.S. Vorgias C.E. Structure. 1994; 2: 1169-1180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). However, the two plant chitinases do not contain ChBDs that are separated from their catalytic domains. It is suggested that the remaining chitinase, S. marcescens chitinase A, contains a putative ChBD in its N-terminal region (ChiN) (residues Ala24–His137) (1.Jolles P. Muzzarelli R.A.A. Chitin and Chitinases. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel1999Crossref Google Scholar), but no sequence similarity exists between ChiN and ChBDChiA1 (see “FnIII Domains”). Therefore, the three-dimensional structure of a ChBD whose function has clearly been identified is necessary for elucidation of its binding mechanism with chitin and its role in the subsequent catalytic activity. Further, some CBDs studied so far have the ability to bind to soluble cello-oligosaccharides (17.Mattinen M.L. Linder M. Drakenberg T. Annila A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and chitin (25.Simpson H.D. Barras F. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4611-4616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as crystalline cellulose. On the other hand, ChBDChiA1 only binds to insoluble chitin; specifically, it does not bind to soluble chito-oligosaccharides, soluble chitin derivatives, or cellulose.2 Thus, it is important to approach the mechanism by which this rather small domain consisting of 45 amino acids exhibits this binding specificity to insoluble chitin from the viewpoint of its tertiary structure. Here we present the three-dimensional structure of the chitin-binding domain (Ala655–Gln699) of B. circulans WL-12 chitinase A1 (ChBDChiA1) determined by NMR using a uniformly 15N-labeled domain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported structure of a ChBD that binds specifically to chitin. Analysis involving structures and sequential alignments allowed us to suggest that the chitin-binding mechanism of ChBDChiA1 is different from the currently proposed cellulose-binding mechanism of the CBDs of cellulases, which are supposed to interact with cellulose via three aromatic rings arranged linearly on the surfaces of CBDs. Cells of Escherichia coliBL21(DE3) harboring the expression pET3a plasmid (Novagen, Madison, WI) with the ChBDChiA1 gene were grown in M9 minimal medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 0.1% glycerol, 4.0 g/literd-glucose, and 0.5 g/liter 15NH4Cl as a sole nitrogen source. The cells were incubated at 30 °C with shaking, and expression of the protein was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 24 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation and disrupted by sonication in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mmEDTA. Proteins in the soluble fraction were collected by ammonium sulfate precipitation (60% saturation) and then dialyzed against 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0). The solution was applied to a chitin affinity column (Chitin EX, Funakoshi, Japan) equilibrated previously with the same buffer. After washing the column with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 1m sodium chloride and with 20 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5), the protein was eluted with 20 mm acetic acid (pH 3.0). About 15 mg of purified and uniformly15N-labeled ChBDChiA1 was obtained from 1 liter of an M9 minimal culture. The obtained protein has a T7 tag consisting of 14 residues (H2N-Met-Ala-Ser-Met-Thr-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Met-Gly-Arg-Gly-Ser-) derived from the expression vector at its N terminus. The protein was stable and did not form a precipitate, at least upon changes of the solution in the pH range of 3–9, a NaCl concentration range of 20–1000 mm, and a temperature range of 4–40 °C. The samples for most of the NMR measurements comprised 2.0 mm15N-labeled ChBDChiA1 in 10 mmKH2PO4-K2HPO4 (pH 6.0) and 10 mm deuterated dithiothreitol in 90% H2O, 10% 2H2O or 1.2 mm15N-labeled ChBDChiA1 in 100 mmKH2PO4-K2HPO4 (pH 6.0) and 10 mm deuterated dithiothreitol in 99.8%2H2O. Protein concentrations were estimated using the calculated molar absorption coefficient at 280 nm (ε280 = 20,970). The calculated weight of the molecule, without the T7 tag region, is 5,018. All NMR experiments were performed with a Bruker DRX500 or DRX800 spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance (1H, 15N, and 13C) probe with a self-shielded triple axis gradient coil. Most spectra were recorded at 310 K. For 1H and 15N resonance assignments (26.Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996Google Scholar), two-dimensional 15N-1H HSQC, two-dimensional TOCSY (with a mixing time of 50 ms), three-dimensional15N-edited TOCSY (with a mixing time of 70 ms), and two-dimensional H(NN)H TOCSY and three-dimensional (H)NNH TOCSY (with mixing times of 308 ms) (27.Theis K. Dingley A.J. Hoffmann A. Omichinski J.G. Grzesiek S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 10: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), spectra were acquired. The numbers of complex points and spectral widths in the three-dimensional (H)NNH TOCSY experiment with the DRX500 were 20, 620.2 Hz (15N, F1, and F2) and 681, 8012.8 Hz (1H, F3). For dihedral angle constraints, a two-dimensional HMQC-J spectrum (26.Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996Google Scholar) was acquired with the DRX800. The 15N dimension was recorded with an acquisition time of 403 ms (400 complex data sets). The digital resolution was 0.5 Hz after zero-filling and subsequent Fourier transformation. For interproton distance constraints (26.Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996Google Scholar), two-dimensional NOESY and three-dimensional15N-edited NOESY spectra were acquired with the DRX800. The mixing time in both experiments was 150 ms. The two-dimensional TOCSY and two-dimensional NOESY experiments were performed with samples dissolved in 99.8% 2H2O, and the other experiments were performed with samples dissolved in 90% H2O/10% 2H2O. Amide proton exchange with the solvent was monitored with a series of15N-1H-HSQC spectra obtained every 30–60 min at 298 K after dissolving lyophilized and protonated15N-labeled ChBDChiA1 (pH 6.0) in2H2O. The signals remaining at eight times within 22 h were identified. In all experiments, the1H carrier was set to the frequency of water resonance (4.692 ppm), and the 15N carrier was set to 118.32 ppm. The two-dimensional 15N-1H HSQC, three-dimensional15N-edited NOESY, two-dimensional H(NN)H TOCSY, and three-dimensional (H)NNH TOCSY experiments included the WATERGATE and Water-flip-back techniques (26.Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996Google Scholar). The three-dimensional15N-edited TOCSY experiment included the sensitivity enhancement and gradient echo methods for the indirect 15N dimension (26.Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996Google Scholar). All other indirect dimensions were recorded in the States-TPPI manner (26.Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996Google Scholar). The NMR data were processed and analyzed using the nmrPipe (28.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar) and Pipp (29.Garrett D.S. Powers R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 214-220Crossref Scopus (802) Google Scholar) software packages, respectively. Stereospecific assignments of the methyl groups of the leucine and valine residues were achieved with 15% fractionally13C-labeled ChBDChiA1 dissolved in 99.8%2H2O as described (30.Hu W. Zuiderweg E.R.P. J. Magn. Reson. 1996; B113: 70-75Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The NOE connectivities derived from strong, medium, and weak cross-peaks were categorized and assumed to correspond to the upper limits for interproton distances of 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 Å, respectively. Pseudoatom corrections were applied to upper bound constraints involving methyl, methylene, and aromatic ring protons as described (31.Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). The NOE list was not filtered to remove restraints of no structural value. The distance constraints for the hydrogen bonds were applied for slowly exchanging amides,i.e. 2.8–3.3 Å for N-O pairs and 1.8–2.3 Å for H-O pairs. A pair of these constraints was used for each hydrogen bond to restrict the length and angle of the bond (32.Weber P.L. Sarkar S.K. NMR Spectroscopy and Its Application to Biomedical Research. Elsevier, Amsterdam1996: 187-239Crossref Google Scholar, 33.Güntert P. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 60: 157-194PubMed Google Scholar). The β-strands were aligned on the basis of the interstrand NOE connectivities among Hα and HN atoms. Hydrogen bond pairs between the amide hydrogens with slow chemical exchange rates and carbonyl oxygens were determined in accordance with the alignment of the β strands. The backbone torsion angles, φ, were estimated from the scalar 3 J HNHα coupling constants derived from the HMQC-J spectrum. The angle constraints used were −65 ± 25° for 3 J HNHα<4.7 Hz, −120 ± 40° for3 J HNHα >8.5 and <9.9 Hz, and −120 ± 20° for 3 J HNHα>10.0 Hz. At the stage of structural constraint collection, the program DYANA version 1.5 (molecular dynamics in a torsion angle space with 25,000 steps) was used (34.Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar). Finally, an ensemble of 100 structures of ChBDChiA1 was calculated with the program X-PLOR version 3.851 (35.Brünger A.T. X-PLOR 3.1: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar), the standard simulated annealing protocol (sa.inp file) with 18,000 steps at a high temperature and 9,000 steps for the cooling being used. The T7 tag region at the N terminus was excluded from the structure calculations. The best 30 structures were analyzed with MOLMOL (36.Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar) and with AQUA and PROCHECK-NMR (37.Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A.C. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar) software. The secondary structures were determined on the basis of the main chain hydrogen bond patterns, the interstrand NOE connectivities, and the results of AQUA and PROCHECK-NMR analyses (37.Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A.C. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar). The amide 1H and15N resonances were assigned at first using two-dimensional H(NN)H TOCSY and three-dimensional (H)NNH TOCSY spectra (27.Theis K. Dingley A.J. Hoffmann A. Omichinski J.G. Grzesiek S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 10: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), magnetization being transferred from an amide 15N spin to those of both preceding and following residues through a15N homonuclear Hartmann-Hahn mixing (TOCSY) scheme. Thus, the two-dimensional and three-dimensional spectra provided observable resonances at the frequencies of (ωH i, ωH j) and (ωN i, ωN j, ωH j), respectively, where i equals j − 1, j, orj + 1. Figs. 1, Aand B, show examples of the sequential connectivities of the amide groups of residues (Tyr662–Tyr670) in the two-dimensional H(NN)H TOCSY and three-dimensional (H)NNH TOCSY spectra, respectively. The combination of these two-dimensional and three-dimensional spectra provided secure amide sequential connectivities, which amounted to 63% of the expected connectivities. Next, additional information regarding1HN-1HN distances and amino acid types was obtained from the three-dimensional15N-edited NOESY and three-dimensional15N-edited TOCSY spectra, respectively. This information compensated for the ambiguity of the amide sequential connectivities that were not resolved in the above3 J NN-based experiments. Finally, we accomplished the assignment of all the amide resonances except for those of Asn671, Gly672, the T7 tag region, and three proline residues. The region containing Asn671 and Gly672 may undergo a conformational exchange, because these residues form the turn connecting the β2- and β3-strands (see “Structure Description”). Fig.1 C shows a two-dimensional 15N-1H HSQC spectrum with the amide resonance assignments. The well dispersed resonance peaks in both the 1H and 15N dimensions reflect the stable structure of ChBDChiA1. The proton resonances of the α sites and side chains were assigned using the two-dimensional TOCSY and three-dimensional 15N-edited TOCSY spectra. The methyl groups of the four leucine and two valine residues were assigned stereospecifically using 15% fractionally13C-labeled ChBDChiA1. The methyl groups of the other two residues, Leu678 and Val658, could not be assigned stereospecifically owing to their overlapping1H chemical shifts. Overall, we assigned 95% of the expected 1H and 15N resonances of the main chain and side chains. The distance constraints based on NOE were extracted from two-dimensional NOESY and three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY spectra with mixing times of 150 ms. By comparing the intensities of well resolved cross-peaks in a series of preliminary two-dimensional NOESY spectra obtained with different mixing times, i.e. 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 ms (data not shown), we judged that the mixing time of 150 ms did not cause severe spin diffusion during the NOE transfer of magnetization. Fig. 2 Asummarizes the sequential and medium-range NOE connectivities along with the secondary structures, 1Hα chemical shift indices (38.Wishart D.S. Sykes B. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 363-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar), amide hydrogen exchange rates, and3 J HNHα coupling constants observed for ChBDChiA1. The β-strand regions are characterized by the strong intensities of the NOE cross-peaks between α protons and the amide protons of the subsequent residues (d αN(i,i+ 1)). The locations of the β-strands are also indicated by positive deviations of the 1Hα chemical shift values from those observed in random coils, which are represented by the1Hα chemical shift index of +1 (38.Wishart D.S. Sykes B. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 363-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar), slow rates of exchange of the amide protons with the solvent, and3 J HNHα coupling constants larger than 8.5 Hz. Interstrand NOE connectivities were observed among Hα and HN atoms (1HN-1HN,1Hα-1HN, and1Hα-1Hα), as shown by the arrows in Fig. 2 B. Overall, 493 NOE-based distance, 20 hydrogen bond, and 33 dihedral angle constraints were collected and used for the structure calculations (TableI).Table IStructural statistics for ChBDChlA1Total number of distance constraints513 Intraresidual149 Sequential (‖i − j‖ = 1)128 Medium range (‖i − j‖ ≤ 4)51 Long range (‖i − j‖ > 4)165 Hydrogen bonds20Number of dihedral angle constraints33Maximum violation of distance constraints0.11 ÅMaximum violation of dihedral angle constraints1.3°Maximum violation of van der Waals distances0.0 År.m.s. deviations from experimental constraints Distance0.0068 ± 0.0011 Å Angle0.171 ± 0.056°r.m.s. deviations from idealized covalent geometry Bonds0.0019 ± 6.94 X 10−5 Å Angles0.550 ± 0.008° Impropers0.339 ± 0.004°X-PLOR potential energy (E total)74.6 ± 2.2PROCHECK Ramachandran plot statistics (residues Trp656–Tyr670, Lys673–Leu698) Residues in most favored regions70.0% Residues in additional allowed regions30.0% Residues in generously allowed regions0.0% Residues in disallowed regions0.0%r.m.s. deviations from the mean coordinate positions (residues Trp656–Leu698) Backbone heavy atoms0.326 Å All heavy atoms0.700 ÅThese statistics comprise the ensemble of the final 30 simulated annealing structures from Ala655 to Gln699 calculated with X-PLOR 3.851 (35.Brünger A.T.

Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar). Out of 100 calculated structures, 30 final structures, which showed the lowest energy values, no distance constraint violation of >0.3 Å, and no dihedral angle constraint violation of >5°, were selected for further analyses. Superpositioning of these 30 structures is shown in Fig. 3 A, and a summary of the constraints and structural statistics is given in TableI. The backbones converged well, as indicated by the r.m.s. deviation of 0.326 Å from the mean structure for the backbone C′, Cα, N atoms of all the residues except for the N-terminal Ala655 and C-terminal Gln699 residues. The r.m.s. deviation for all heavy atoms in the same regions is 0.700 Å. The Asn671 and Gly672 residues, whose amide signals could not be observed in 1H-15N HSQC spectra, are in the loop region connecting the β2- and β3-strands, and the calculated coordinates of the loop diverged due to the few constraints in the loop. Almost the same structures were obtained upon calculation with the program DYANA 1.5 (34.Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar) with the same constraints as those used in the X-PLOR calculation. The average DYANA target function value of the best 30 structures selected out of the 100 calculated ones was 0.32 ± 0.10 (one S.D.), and the r.m.s. deviations of all 60 structures that were calculated with X-PLOR and DYANA were 0.354 Å for the backbone atoms and 0.713 Å for all of the heavy atoms in the same regions as described above. ChBDChiA1 has a compact and globular structure, as shown in Fig. 3 B. It contains two antiparallel β-sheets (Fig. 2 C). One sheet is composed of three strands designated as β2(Gln666–Tyr670), β3(Lys673–Cys677), and β5(Trp696–Leu698), while the other is composed of two strands designated as β1(Thr660–Tyr662) and β4(His681–Ser683). No region characteristic of an α-helix exists. β5 consists of three residues and forms an antiparallel β-sheet with the three C-terminal residues of β3. Fig. 2 B shows the hydrogen bond networks and NOE connectivities among these five β-strands that were used for the structure calculation. The two antiparallel β-sheets formed by these hydrogen bond networks fold into the topology of a twisted β-sandwich with an angle of about 45° between the sheets. The β sheet formed by β2, β3, and β5 makes a flat surface on the molecule, and the loop connecting β4 and β5 runs on the opposite side to the surface. The core region is formed by the hydrophobic and aromatic residues shown in Fig. 3 A, i.e.Trp656 (10.6), Tyr662 (10.1), Val668 (1.7), Tyr670 (9.5), Tyr675(5.4), Cys677 (1.3), Leu695 (6.8), and Trp696 (3.1%), the values in parentheses indicating the solvent accessibility averaged over the 30 calculated structures for the side chains. This hydrophobic core and the hydrogen bond networks observed among the β-strands make the overall structure rigid and compact. Such a character was also expected from the presence of the amide hydrogen atoms that were not exchanged with the solvent for as long as 18 h at pH 6.0 and 298 K (the residues with closed circles in Fig. 2 A). ChBDChiA1 contains only three charged residues (+Lys673, +Lys676, and −Glu688), and the surface of the molecule is dominated by noncharged residues, as shown in Fig. 3 C.

Binding to cell surface heparan sulfate is indispensable for the biological activity of HB-GAM. In the present paper we have studied the structure of recombinant HB-GAM using heteronuclear NMR. These studies show that HB-GAM contains two β-sheet domains connected by a flexible linker. Both of these domains contain three antiparallel β-strands. In addition to this domain structure, HB-GAM contains the N- and C-terminal lysine-rich sequences that lack a detectable structure and appear to form random coils. Studies using CD and NMR spectroscopy suggest that HB-GAM undergoes a conformational change upon binding to heparin, and that the binding occurs primarily to the β-sheet domains of the protein. Search of sequence data bases shows that the β-sheet domains of HB-GAM are homologous to the thrombospondin type I repeat (TSR). Sequence comparisions show that the β-sheet structures found previously in midkine, a protein homologous with HB-GAM, also correspond to the TSR motif. We suggest that the TSR sequence motif found in various extracellular proteins defines a β-sheet structure similar to that found in HB-GAM and midkine. In addition to the apparent structural similarity, a similarity in biological functions is suggested by the occurrence of the TSR sequence motif in a wide variety of proteins that mediate cell-to-extracellular matrix and cell-to-cell interactions, in which the TSR domain mediates specific cell surface binding.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2933-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). HB-GAM is highly homologous with the midkine (MK) sequence (2.Merenmies J. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16721-16724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Matsubara S. Tomomura M. Kadomatsu K. Muramatsu T.J. J. Biol.

Commun. 1991; 175: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and these proteins thus form a two-member family of small extracellular proteins that are conserved in vertebrates. In developing tissues HB-GAM associates with extracellular matrix of axonal tracts and of synapses (5.Rauvala H. Vanhala A. Castrén E. Nolo R. Raulo E. Merenmies J. Panula P. Dev. Brain Res. 1994; 79: 157-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 6.Peng H.B. Ali A.A. Dai Z. Daggett D.F. Raulo E. Rauvala H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3027-3038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is also clearly expressed in developing basement membranes outside of brain (7.Mitsiadis T.A. Salmivirta M. Muramatsu T. Muramatsu H. Rauvala H. Lehtonen E. Jalkanen M. Thesleff I. Development. 1995; 121: 37-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in the cartilage matrix (8.Imai S. Kaksonen M. Raulo E. Kinnunen T. Fages C. Meng X. Lakso M. Rauvala H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1112-1128Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). N-syndecan (syndecan-3) acts as a receptor of HB-GAM in brain neurons in vitro (9.Raulo E. Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J. Nolo R. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12999-13004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and localizes in many anatomical areas to the same developing fiber tracts as HB-GAM (10.Nolo R. Kaksonen M. Raulo E. Rauvala H. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 191: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 11.Kinnunen A. Kinnunen T. Kaksonen M. Nolo R. Panula P. Rauvala H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 635-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The heparan sulfate structure of brain N-syndecan is exceptionally heparin-like, especially in its high content of 2-0-sulfo-iduronic acid residues, which is of importance in the HB-GAM binding carbohydrate epitope, the minimal size of which appears to be 10 monosaccharide residues (12.Kinnunen T. Raulo E. Nolo R. Maccarana M. Lindahl U. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2243-2248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The neurite outgrowth-promoting effect, based on HB-GAM/N-syndecan interaction, was very recently shown to be mediated by the cortactin/src-kinase signaling pathway to the cytoskeleton of neurites (13.Kinnunen T. Kaksonen M. Saarinen J. Kalkkinen N. Peng H.B. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10702-10708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). These findings have led to the concept that N-syndecan mediates HB-GAM-induced neurite growth (for review, see Ref. 14.Rauvala H. Peng H.B. Prog. Neurobiol. 1997; 52: 127-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Furthermore, very recent studies have revealed a role for HB-GAM and N-syndecan in the regulation of hippocampal long-term potentiation (15.Lauri S.E. Kaukinen S. Kinnunen T. Ylinen A. Imai S. Kaila K. Taira T. Rauvala H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1226-1235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a form of brain plasticity implicated in memory and learning. HB-GAM consists of 136 amino acid residues. It contains an abundance (24%) of cationic, mainly lysine, residues and 5 intrachain disulfide bonds (2.Merenmies J. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16721-16724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Raulo E. Julkunen I. Merenmies J. Pihlaskari R. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11408-11416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HB-GAM sequence is highly conserved across different species: >90% identity is observed among the sequences of chicken, rat, bovine, and human (2.Merenmies J. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16721-16724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Hampton B.S. Marshak D.R. Burgess W.H. Mol. Biol.

Science. 1990; 250: 1690-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The same sequence as that of HB-GAM was found for the mitogenic and neurite outgrowth-promoting protein designated pleiotrophin (18.Li Y.S. Milner P.G. Chauhan A.K. Watson M.A. Hoffman R.M. Kodner C.M. Milbrandt J. Deuel T.F. Science. 1990; 250: 1690-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The designations osteoblast-specific factor-1 (19.Tezuka K. Takeshita S. Hakeda Y. Kumegawa M. Kikuno R. Hashimoto-Gotoh T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), heparin binding neurotrophic factor (20.Bohlen P. Kovesdi I. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1991; 3: 143-157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and heparin affin regulatory peptide (21.Courty J. Dauchel M.C. Caruelle D. Perderiset M. Barritault D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) also refer to the protein having the same sequence as HB-GAM. To gain further insight into the function of HB-GAM, we have undertaken the study of the structure of this protein and its interaction with heparin by means of heteronuclear NMR. These studies show that HB-GAM contains two β-sheet domains that bind heparin. A search of data bases using the sequences of the β-sheet domains and of the full-length HB-GAM shows that the β-sheet domains are homologous to the thrombospondin type I repeat (TSR) motif that mediates cell surface binding in a number of extracellular matrix and cell surface proteins. The baculovirus-derived HB-GAM was used for 1H NMR and has been previously shown to be biologically active and identical to the tissue protein (16.Raulo E. Julkunen I. Merenmies J. Pihlaskari R. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11408-11416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To label HB-GAM with 15N and 13C, we used the glutathione S-transferase fusion system J (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in Escherichia coli (strain BL21(DE3)). The HB-GAM samples were obtained after thrombin cleavage of glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. The HB-GAM samples were purified with heparin affinity, glutathione-Sepharose, and ion exchange chromatography. The HB-GAM used in this study contains a Gly-Ser N-domain extension (numbered as -2, -1, respectively). TheE. coli and baculovirus derived proteins were shown to be essentially identical by matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization-time of flight mass spectroscopy and 1H NMR (two-dimensional NOESY and TOCSY) spectroscopy. Furthermore, the protein samples were characterized with peptide mapping to ensure that the disulfide bonds were correct in the E. coli-derived protein. In this analysis, the protein samples were digested with a proteinase (endoproteinase Lys C or trypsin), and the digested sample was divided into three identical fractions. The first fraction was analyzed with matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization-time of flight directly; the second one was alkylated and subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization-time of flight; and the third was reduced with dithiothreitol, alkylated, and analyzed with matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization-time of flight mass spectroscopy. The 15N and 13C double-labeled samples were grown in minimal media containing 0.5 g/liter15NH4Cl, 1.25 g/liter glucose, and 1 g/liter Isogro-13C, 15N-Powder growth medium (Isotec). The 15N-labeled samples were produced correspondingly, but without 13C labels. The NMR samples contained 1 mm HB-GAM in 95% 1H2O/5%2H2O, pH 4.7. Oligonucleotide primers were used to amplify individual β-sheet domains of HB-GAM. The primers for the N-terminal domain (amino acids 45–90) were 5′-AAGGATCCGACTGTGGAGAATGGCAA-3′ and 5′TGGAATTCCTAGTTGCAAGGGATCTTACATCT-3′. For the C-terminal domain (amino acids 97–142) primers 5′-AGGGATCCGCTGAGTGCAAATACCAG-3′ and 5′-TTGAATTCCTAGCCACAGGGCTTGGAGAT-3′ were used. The domain boundaries were determined using the HB-GAM secondary structure NMR coordination map. The PCR products were cloned into theBamHI-EcoRI cloning site of pGEX-2T and sequenced. Production of the separate domains was performed in E. coli strain BL21. The glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were harvested from bacterial lysates by glutathione-Sepharose and eluted by thrombin cleavage. The isolated recombinant domains were subjected to heparin affinity chromatography. A linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 2 m in 20 mm sodim phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, was used to compare the elution profiles of separate domains with that of intact HB-GAM produced similarly in E. coli. Porcine intestinal mucosal heparin (M r 14,000) was obtained from Celsus Laboratories (Cincinnati, OH). The heparin (10 g) was digested to 30% completion using heparin lyase I as reported previously (22.Pervin A. Gallo C. Jandick K.A. Han X.J. Linhardt R.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and fractioned by Sephadex G50 gel filtration chromatography into sized oligosaccharides. A single tetradecasaccharide (14-mer) was purified from the mixture using strong-anion exchange chromatography, and its purity was assessed as >90% by gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (23.Toida T. Hileman R.E. Smith A.E. Vlahova P.I. Linhardt R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32040-32047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and capillary electrophoresis (22.Pervin A. Gallo C. Jandick K.A. Han X.J. Linhardt R.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). One-dimensional 1H NMR and two-dimensional COSY NMR were used to examine the structure of this tetradecasaccharide (22.Pervin A. Gallo C. Jandick K.A. Han X.J. Linhardt R.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). 1H-15N-HSQC, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCO, HCCH-TOCSY, CC(CO)NH, 15N-edited TOCSY and NOESY, and 13C-edited NOESY (24.Grzesiek S.

Soc. 1994; 116: 11655-11666Crossref Scopus (498) Google Scholar) were acquired with Varian Unity 500 and 600 and Inova 750 spectrometers at 30 °C. Data were processed with cos2 functions in all dimensions and with linear prediction in 15N and13C domains in the triple resonance experiments. All spectra were processed on Silicon Graphics O2 workstations using Felix 97 software (Felix 97.0; Biosym/MSI, San Diego, CA). The15N T1 and T2 relaxation rates (26.Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Crossref Scopus (2437) Google Scholar) were measured using delays of 0.01, 0.07, 0.14, 0.26, 0.38, 0.53, 0.76, and 1.17 s for T1 and delays of 0.11, 0.14, 0.18, 0.24, 0.32, 0.40, 0.43, 0.48, and 0.58 s for T2. The heteronuclear NOE experiments were recorded with and without 2 s of saturation of the amide protons. The binding of heparin (M r 8000; Sigma) to HB-GAM was followed with circular dichroism (CD). The heparin stock solution was prepared to a 1 mm concentration at pH 6.0. A quartz cuvette with a 0.1-mm optical path was filled with 0.2 mm HB-GAM solution to 200 μl, and the CD spectra were recorded from 250 to 190 nm with a Jasco-720 spectropolarometer. The Gapped-BLAST and the position-specific-iterated BLAST programs (27.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60158) Google Scholar) were used for searching homologous sequences from the nonredundant protein sequence data base of the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Multiple alignment was constructed using the ClustalX program (28.Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35593) Google Scholar). Recombinant HB-GAM purified from the culture medium of Sf9 cells was used to record NMR spectra at 500 and 600 Mhz, because this protein has been previously shown to correspond in its biochemical and cell biological properties to tissue-derived HB-GAM (16.Raulo E. Julkunen I. Merenmies J. Pihlaskari R. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11408-11416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For 15N and13C labeling, expression systems in bacteria and yeast were explored. Of several expression systems tested, the glutathioneS-transferase gene fusion system in E. coli was found to produce reasonable amounts of HB-GAM that could be purified to apparent homogeneity, as described previously for the baculovirus-derived protein from Sf9 cells (16.Raulo E. Julkunen I. Merenmies J. Pihlaskari R. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11408-11416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NMR spectra and peptide maps (see “Experimental Procedures”) recorded from the bacterial recombinant were essentially identical compared with those using the baculovirus-derived protein produced in Sf9 cells, indicating native conformation for the protein produced in E. coli. Furthermore, dose-response curves of neurite outgrowth in brain neurons were essentially identical (data not shown) compared with the baculovirus-derived protein studied previously (16.Raulo E. Julkunen I. Merenmies J. Pihlaskari R. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11408-11416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore used the recombinant HB-GAM produced in E. coli for further NMR studies. The 750-MHz 1H-15N-HSQC spectrum of HB-GAM is shown in Fig. 1. A nearly complete backbone assignment was obtained for the structural parts of HB-GAM using triple resonance methods (24.Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 6291-6293Crossref Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 25.Yamazaki T. Lee W. Arrowsmith C.H. Muhandiram D.R. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem.

Thus, amide15N frequencies were obtained from a high-resolution 750-MHz 1H-15N-HSQC spectrum, followed by the collection of corresponding intra- and inter-residual Cα/Cβ connectivities from 500-MHz HNCACB and CBCA(CO)NH spectra. This information allowed in most cases the unique matching of the amino acid residues. The carbonyl shifts were obtained from HNCO. Side-chain proton and carbon chemical shifts were assigned using a combination of three spectra. Partial proton and carbon side-chain assignments obtained from 15N-edited TOCSY and CC(CO)NH were subsequently complemented with those from HCCH-TOCSY. Chemical shifts of all assigned 1H, 13C, and 15N nuclei have been deposited in BioMagResBank. Hα, Cα, and C′ chemical shift indices (31.Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar, 32.Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar) indicate that HB-GAM is composed of six β-strands; the consensus crystal structure image predicts β-strands for residues 18–27, 32–39, 48–57, 70–78, 83–91, and 101–110 (data not shown). The long-range NOE information (Fig. 2, obtained from 15N- and 13C-edited NOESY at 750 MHz) of HB-GAM in between the β-strands reveals a two-domain structure, similar to that suggested for MK (33.Iwasaki W. Nagata K. Hatanaka H. Inui T. Kimura T. Muramatsu T. Yoshida K. Tasumi M. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6936-6946Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Sequential NOE data are presented in Fig.3. Both domains consist of three antiparallel β-sheet structures. Heteronuclear-edited NOE data and dipolar coupling data recorded from a partially oriented HB-GAM in a liquid crystalline medium with pf1 phages (34.Hansen M.R. Mueller L. Pardi A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) suggest that the two domains are relatively independent and free to move with respect to each other in solution (data not shown). The linker region between the β-sheet domains of HB-GAM thus appears flexible, jeopardizing attempts to get a high-resolution structure of the whole molecule under standard NMR conditions.Figure 3Sequential NOE data of HB-GAM. The lines are scaled to the NOE intensities; bold lines represent strong NOE connectivities, and thin lines indicate weak connectivities.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The N-terminal (amino acids 1–14) and C-terminal (amino acids 111–136) areas of HB-GAM are highly flexible, as indicated by the long T2 15N relaxation rates and by the heteronuclear NOE intensities presented in Fig.4. For some parts of the flexible N and C termini it was not possible to obtain individual assignments because of strong overlap in 1H, 15N, and 13C frequencies (Fig. 1). Also, the linker (amino acids 59–66) shows some flexibility, as indicated by slightly longer 15N T2 and smaller NOE values. HB-GAM was initially isolated from crude extracts of brain by heparin affinity chromatography and shown to be displaced from heparin at 1 m NaCl in salt gradient elution, suggesting a strong binding (1.Rauvala H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2933-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). We have previously shown by microtitration calorimetry that the stoichiometry of HB-GAM/heparin interaction is 3 mol of HB-GAM/mol of heparin with a dissociation constant of 460 nm in solution (35.Fath M. VanderNoot V. Kilpeläinen I. Kinnunen T. Rauvala H. Linhardt R.J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Binding of HB-GAM to heparin was also evident from CD spectroscopy of heparin, HB-GAM, or HB-GAM plus heparin in solution (Fig.5). Furthermore, CD spectroscopy suggests that HB-GAM undergoes structural changes upon binding to heparin (Fig.5). Because the binding of HB-GAM to heparin is relatively tight, and a high molecular weight complex is simultaneously formed, we were not able to follow the movements of correlations in the1H-15N-HSQC spectrum of HB-GAM during titration with the heparin-derived 14-mer. The 500-MHz1H-15N-HSQC spectrum of the end point of the titration (at the HB-GAM/heparin molar ratio of 1:2) overlaid with the corresponding spectrum of HB-GAM alone is shown in Fig.6. The comparison of the1H-15N-HSQC spectra of HB-GAM with the HB-GAM·heparin complex reveals that the lysine-rich N- and C-terminal tails (although not fully assigned) are not involved in the heparin binding and remain unstructured (Fig. 6) also in the complex form. The signals from the fexible N- and C-terminal tails remain intense and narrow also in the complex form, despite the excess of heparin used and the high molecular weight of the complex. In contrast, the correlations from the β-sheet domains of HB-GAM have broadened significantly, most of them below the detection limit in the complex form (Fig. 6). Thus, although the lysine-rich tails are highly charged, they do not contribute to binding of HB-GAM to heparin, but the binding depends on the β-sheet domains. Based on NMR spectra, both of the β-sheet domains of HB-GAM bind to heparin in solution (Fig. 6). Furthermore, the two β-sheet domains of HB-GAM were expressed as separate recombinant proteins in E. coli and were shown to elute at a 0.6 m NaCl concentration in heparin affinity chromatography with salt gradient elution (Fig. 7). Both β-sheet domains of HB-GAM thus display a strong binding to heparin without the polylysine type tails.Figure 7Heparin affinity chromatography of intact HB-GAM and separate β-sheet domains. A heparin-Sepharose HiTrap 1-ml column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was equilibrated to 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. A gradient elution program was used to compare the elution profiles of intact HB-GAM (red), N-terminal β-sheet domain (blue), and C-terminal β-sheet domain (green). The NaCl gradient for each run was monitored as conductivity (magenta). The intact HB-GAM and its β-sheet domains elute at 1.2 and 0.6 m NaCl, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Reduction of the disulfide bonds of HB-GAM dramatically reduced heparin binding, in agreement with the NMR results suggesting that native HB-GAM structure is essential for the binding. Thus, whereas the native HB-GAM was displaced from heparin by 1 m NaCl when analyzed by salt gradient elution (1.Rauvala H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2933-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), the reduced HB-GAM only displayed weak binding and was eluted at low salt (∼0.2 m NaCl). As expected, NMR and CD spectroscopy (Fig. 5) suggest that the β-sheet structures of HB-GAM are partially destroyed by reduction of the intrachain disulfide bonds. The National Center for Biotechnology Information nonredundant sequence data base was searched with the mature HB-GAM protein sequence using the Gapped-BLAST program (27.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60158) Google Scholar). The HB-GAM sequence was found to align with the TSR repeats in the F-spondin sequence (E value = 0.043). A search using the position-specific-iterated BLAST program (27.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60158) Google Scholar) gave statistically significant matches with F-spondin and several other proteins that contain TSR domains (Fig. 8). Both β-sheet domains of HB-GAM aligned with with the TSR motif (Fig. 8). The lysine-rich unstructured tails of HB-GAM were not in the alignment. We then made a position-specific-iterated BLAST query using only the N- or C-terminal β-sheet sequences, and the first matches for both domains after the HB-GAM and MK sequences were the TSR domain sequences (Fig. 8). Search with the MK sequence also gave matches with F-spondin and other proteins having TSR motifs. HB-GAM and MK are thus composed of short N- and C-terminal tails and two TSR domains that are connected with a short linker (Fig. 9). The main conserved features in the TSR sequences are the cysteines, closely spaced tryptophans, and a cluster of basic residues (Fig. 8). The arrangement of intradomain cysteine bridges in HB-GAM (Fig. 2) and in MK (33.Iwasaki W. Nagata K. Hatanaka H. Inui T. Kimura T. Muramatsu T. Yoshida K. Tasumi M. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6936-6946Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) is consistent with that predicted for the TSR motif (Fig. 8and Ref. 36.Leung-Hagesteijn C. Spence A.M. Stern B.D. Zhou Y. Su M.W. Hedgecock E.M. Culotti J.G. Cell. 1992; 71: 289-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Tryptohans are conserved in the HB-GAM and MK N-terminal domains where their spacing is, however, reduced by 1 amino acid. In the C-terminal domains another tryptophan is replaced by phenylalanine. Our finding that the β-sheet domains of HB-GAM mediate heparin binding agrees with the view that these domains correspond to the TSR sequence motifs, because several TSR repeats have been shown to bind heparin and heparan sulfate. Peptides from thrombospondin TSR bind heparin and inhibit heparin-dependent interaction of cells with thrombospondin and laminin (37.Guo N.H. Krutzsch H.C. Negre E. Vogel T. Blake D.A. Roberts D.D.

The conserved tryptophans (Fig. 8) form a heparin binding motif in thrombospondin TSR domains (37.Guo N.H. Krutzsch H.C. Negre E. Vogel T. Blake D.A. Roberts D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3040-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It has been shown that peptides containing a WSXW sequence strongly inhibit heparin binding to thrombospondin (37.Guo N.H. Krutzsch H.C. Negre E. Vogel T. Blake D.A. Roberts D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3040-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 38.Guo N.H. Krutzsch H.C. Negre E. Zabrenetzky V.S. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19349-19355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, reducing the spacing of tryptophan residues did not significantly reduce the inhibitory activity of the peptides (38.Guo N.H. Krutzsch H.C. Negre E. Zabrenetzky V.S. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19349-19355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A cluster of basic residues downstream of tryptophans has also been shown to contribute to heparin binding in the TSR domain of the malaria CS protein (39.Gantt S.M. Clavijo P. Bai X. Esko J.D. Sinnis P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19205-19213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For the midkine C-terminal domain, it has been suggested that the conserved tryptophan in the first β-strand and downstream basic amino acids in the second β-strand are involved in formation of a heparin binding surface (33.Iwasaki W. Nagata K. Hatanaka H. Inui T. Kimura T. Muramatsu T. Yoshida K. Tasumi M. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6936-6946Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The conserved basic residues in the TSR domains are separated by 1 or 3 residues so that on the β-sheet their side chains are on the same side of the structure and thus could participate in forming a heparin binding site (Fig. 8). In an antiparallel β-sheet arrangement, similar to one seen in MK and HB-GAM, they would also be close to the conserved tryptophans. It appears that the TSR domains of different proteins share structural features explaining their heparin binding, but further charactization of the mode of binding is warranted. The present results show that HB-GAM contains two β-sheet domains, the sequences of which correspond to the TSR motif. Furthermore, our sequence analyses show that the β-sheet domains found recently in the homologous MK protein (33.Iwasaki W. Nagata K. Hatanaka H. Inui T. Kimura T. Muramatsu T. Yoshida K. Tasumi M. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6936-6946Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) also correspond to the TSR motif. The amino acid sequences of these four postulated TSR domains found in HB-GAM and MK are quite variable but retain the conserved cysteine/tryptophan motif. The finding that these four polypeptide sequences fold to a clearly similar structure composed of three antiparallel β-strands suggests a general rule for the TSR sequence motif. We are currently producing TSR domains from other proteins to study this hypothesis, because structures of other TSR domains, except for HB-GAM and MK, are not yet known. Structural data of the TSR domains of HB-GAM and MK also make molecular modeling of other TSR domains a worthy goal. It is noteworthy that many TSR domains are involved in interesting biological interactions (see below), some of which also possess potential for therapeutic applications. This underscores the importance of detailed structural data and molecular modeling studies based on resolved structures. TSR proteins have functions in specific cell surface interactions. Malaria parasites bind to the surface of hepatocytes and penetrate very rapidly and specifically using their surface proteins CS (44.Cerami C. Frevert U. Sinnis P. Takacs B. Clavijo P. Santos M.J. Nussenzweig V. Cell. 1992; 70: 1021-1033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and TRAP (45.Sultan A.A. Thathy V. Frevert U. Robson K.J. Crisanti A. Nussenzweig V. Nussenzweig R.S. Menard R. Cell. 1997; 90: 511-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that different species of malaria invariably express cell surface proteins having a TSR domain (41.Naitza S. Spano F. Robson K.J.H. Crisanti A. Parasitol. Today. 1998; 14: 479-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The TSR domain of the malaria sporozoites is used for gliding motility of the parasites, a prerequisite for infection and a potential target for drug development (41.Naitza S. Spano F. Robson K.J.H. Crisanti A. Parasitol. Today. 1998; 14: 479-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It is of interest that several proteins that interact with the neuron surface and are involved in neurite growth and guidance possess TSR domains (Fig. 9). In fact, HB-GAM was initially isolated (1.Rauvala H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2933-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) and cloned (2.Merenmies J. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16721-16724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a heparin-binding protein that enhances neurite growth. Other TSR proteins that are implicated in neurite growth and/or guidance include MK (46.Muramatsu H. Muramatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 652-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), UNC5 (36.Leung-Hagesteijn C. Spence A.M. Stern B.D. Zhou Y. Su M.W. Hedgecock E.M. Culotti J.G. Cell. 1992; 71: 289-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), F-spondin (47.Klar A. Baldassare M. Jessell T.M. Cell. 1992; 69: 95-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), and semaphorins F and G (48.Adams R.H. Betz H. Püschel A.W. Mech. Dev. 1996; 57: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Binding to heparin-type carbohydrates is known to be of importance for the neurite growth and guidance effects of HB-GAM, MK, and F-spondin. Based on the sequence similarities and probable structural similarities, we predict that heparin-type glycans are also important for biological roles of other TSR proteins, such as semaphorins F and G. Furthermore, thrombospondins interact with the surface of various cell types enhancing adhesion, spreading, and neurite outgrowth, migration, or proliferation (for review, see Ref.49.Bornstein P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Cell surface glycosaminoglycans provide a potential source of a large array of different structures serving as binding partners in specific cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions (50.Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). However, it is not known to what extent this structural diversity of glycosaminoglycans is used to regulate biological interactions. The occurrence of TSR domains in a large number of various proteins throughout the animal kingdom and their similarity in binding to heparin-type glycans suggest that this domain exploits the structural diversity of heparin epitopes in various biological interactions.

https://openalex.org/W2095898657,"To better understand the mechanism of divergent electron transfer from ubiquinol to the iron-sulfur protein and cytochrome b L within the cytochromebc 1 complex, we have examined the effects of antimycin on the presteady state reduction kinetics of thebc 1 complex in the presence or absence of endogenous ubiquinone. When ubiquinone is present, antimycin slows the rate of cytochrome c 1 reduction by ∼10-fold but had no effect upon the rate of cytochromec 1 reduction in bc 1complex lacking endogenous ubiquinone. In the absence of endogenous ubiquinone cytochrome c 1, reduction was slower than when ubiquinone was present and was similar to that in the presence of ubiquinone plus antimycin. These results indicate that the low potential redox components, cytochrome b Hand b L, exert negative control on the rate of reduction of cytochrome c 1 and the Rieske iron-sulfur protein at center P. If electrons cannot equilibrate from cytochrome b H and b L to ubiquinone, partial reduction of the low potential components slows reduction of the high potential components. We also examined the effects of decreasing the midpoint potential of the iron-sulfur protein on the rates of cytochrome b reduction. As the midpoint potential decreased, there was a parallel decrease in the rate ofb reduction, demonstrating that the rate of breduction is dependent upon the rate of ubiquinol oxidation by the iron-sulfur protein. Together these results indicate that ubiquinol oxidation is a concerted reaction in which both the low potential and high potential redox components control ubiquinol oxidation at center P, consistent with the protonmotive Q cycle mechanism.

Trumpower B.L. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), the mechanism of ubiquinol oxidation at center P has not been fully elucidated. With the determination of the crystal structure of the cytochrome bc 1 complex (4.Xia D., Yu, C.A. Kim H. Xian J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L., Yu, L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1997; 277: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar, 5.Zhang Z.L. Huang L.S. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y.I. Kim K.K. Hung L.W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar), a more extensive examination of the structure-function relationships of the Q cycle mechanism is possible. It is generally accepted that the mechanism of ubiquinol oxidation at center P involves a divergent oxidation in which the iron-sulfur protein oxidizes ubiquinol to semiquinone and the semiquinone reduces cytochrome b L (1.Trumpower B.L. Gennis R.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 675-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 3.Brandt U. Trumpower B.L. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). It is unclear, however, whether the oxidation of ubiquinol occurs through semiquinone in a sequential mechanism or whether ubiquinol is oxidized by the iron-sulfur protein and cytochrome b L in a concerted reaction. Earlier experiments suggested the presence of a transient semiquinone at center P (6.De Vries S. Albracht S.P.J. Berden J.A. Slater E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11996-11998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with a sequential mechanism, although recent experiments suggest otherwise (7.Jünemann S. Heathcote P. Rich P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21603-21607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). There have been two proposals for concerted reaction mechanisms at center P. Link (8.Link T.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) proposed a “proton-gated affinity change” mechanism in which stabilization of ubisemiquinone by anti-ferromagnetic coupling to the reduced iron-sulfur protein raises the potential of the iron-sulfur cluster such that the cluster cannot be oxidized by cytochrome c 1 until the semiquinone is oxidized. Jünemann et al. (7.Jünemann S. Heathcote P. Rich P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21603-21607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) suggested that the potential of the ubiquinol/ubisemiquinone couple at center P is more positive than that of the iron-sulfur cluster and that oxidation of the semiquinone is required to lower the potential of the couple. In both of these mechanisms ubisemiquinone must be oxidized to allow a thermodynamically linked reaction to occur. In one case this is required in order to allow reduction of cytochromec 1 by the Rieske cluster (8.Link T.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and in the other, to allow reduction of the Rieske cluster by the ubiquinol/ubisemiquinone couple (7.Jünemann S. Heathcote P. Rich P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21603-21607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the cytochrome bc 1complex suggest that movement of the iron-sulfur protein is necessary for divergent electron transfer to cytochrome c 1and cytochrome b (5.Zhang Z.L. Huang L.S. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y.I. Kim K.K. Hung L.W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar), and recent experiments have confirmed that mobility of the extra-membrane domain of the iron-sulfur protein is essential for function (9.Tian H. White S., Yu, L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7146-7152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Concerted electron transfer mechanisms can accommodate iron-sulfur protein movement either for thermodynamic reasons or if movement of the Rieske center makes the first electron transfer dependent upon the second. Similarly, mechanisms that propose occupancy of two ubiquinol molecules at center P (10.Ding H.G. Robertson D.E. Daldal F. Dutton P.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3144-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 11.Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) can be concerted. We have examined the effects of antimycin and endogenous ubiquinone on the presteady state rates of cytochrome b andc 1 reduction. We also examined the effects of decreasing the midpoint potential of the iron-sulfur protein on the presteady state reduction kinetics of the bc 1complex. Our results indicate that oxidation of ubiquinol at center P occurs through a concerted mechanism in which both the iron-sulfur protein and cytochrome b L must be oxidized.

Antimycin, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and menaquinone were purchased from Sigma. Yeast extract and peptone were from Difco. The yeast Δcoq2 mutant was obtained from Dr. Catherine Clarke (UCLA). This mutant lacks ubiquinone due to deletion of the gene for the polyprenyl transferase that transfers the isoprenoid side chain to p-hydroxybenzoate at an early step in the ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway (12.Ashby M.N.

The Δcoq2 yeast mutant was grown in 80 liters of yeast extract/peptone/dextrose medium, and the mutants with iron-sulfur mutations Y185F, S183T, S183A, and S183A/Y185F (14.Denke E. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Hatzfeld O.M. Snyder C.H. Link T.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9085-9093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) were grown in 80 liters of minimal medium plus dextrose and harvested by centrifugation. Cytochrome bc 1 complex was isolated as described previously (13.Snyder C.H. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31209-31216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Kinetic measurements were performed at room temperature by stopped-flow rapid-scanning spectroscopy using the OLIS Rapid-Scanning Monochromator (On-Line Instrument Systems, Inc., Bogart, GA) equipped with a 1200 lines/mm of grating blazed at 500 nm. This produced a spectrum of 75-nm width, centered at 555 nm, with a resolution of 0.4 nm. The dead time of the instrument was ∼2 ms, and the end of this period was chosen as time zero. Data was collected at 1000 scans/s. Reactions were started by mixing 2 μm bc 1 complex in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, containing 250 mm sucrose, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 1.0 mg/ml bovine serum albumin against an equal volume of buffer containing menaquinol. A fresh solution of menaquinol substrate was prepared from menaquinone before each kinetic experiment, as described previously (13.Snyder C.H. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31209-31216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). An oxidized spectrum was obtained by mixing the oxidized bc 1 complex against buffer and averaging the data set to a single scan. For each experiment three data sets were averaged, and the oxidized spectrum was subtracted from each scan. From the three-dimensional data set comprised of wavelength, absorbance, and time, we extracted the time course of cytochrome b and c 1reduction at 563.3 and 554.6 nm, respectively, using software from OLIS. The kinetic plots were analyzed by a “successive integration” method (15.Matheson E.B.C. Anal. Instrum. 1987; 16: 345-474Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar) incorporated into the OLIS software. This software establishes whether the reaction consists of one or more kinetic phases and assigns first order rate constants to the exponentials. Second order rate constants were then calculated from the slopes of the curves obtained by plotting the first order rate constants against menaquinol concentration using Fig. P, v 2.2a software from Biosoft, Ferguson, MO. In the proton-motive Q cycle mechanism, oxidation of ubiquinol at center P in the bc 1 complex delivers the two electrons divergently to two separate redox chains within the enzyme: a high potential chain that includes the Rieske iron-sulfur protein and cytochrome c 1 and a low potential chain that includes the di-heme cytochrome b H andb L (Fig. 1). Whether and, if so, how these two thermodynamically separate redox chains influence the activity of each other has not been extensively examined. We recently showed that endogenous ubiquinone residing at center N rapidly reoxidizes cytochrome b H (13.Snyder C.H. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31209-31216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and it is generally accepted that this reaction is inhibited by antimycin (1.Trumpower B.L. Gennis R.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 675-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 2.Mitchell P. J. Theor. Biol. 1976; 62: 327-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 3.Brandt U. Trumpower B.L. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). To test whether the low potential chain affects reduction of the high potential chain, we examined the effects of antimycin or ubiquinone residing at center N on reduction of cytochromec 1 by menaquinol. In the absence of inhibitors and in the presence of endogenous ubiquinone, the reduction of cytochrome c 1 by 25 μm menaquinol is monophasic, with a rate of 7.9 s−1 (Fig.2), whereas the reduction of cytochromeb is triphasic, as was previously observed (13.Snyder C.H. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31209-31216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). When antimycin was added, the rate of cytochrome c 1reduction slowed 4-fold to 1.8 s−1, and cytochromeb reduction became a biphasic reaction, with each phase comprising 50% of the total absorbance change and rates of 19 s−1 and 1.9 s−1 (Fig. 2). Thus, antimycin binding at center N slows the rate of cytochromec 1 reduction through center P, and the rate matches the slow phase of the biphasic b reduction. We also examined cytochrome b reduction in a Δcoq2 mutant. This mutant is completely devoid of ubiquinone due to deletion of the gene for the enzyme that attaches the isoprenoid side chain (12.Ashby M.N. Kutsunai S.Y. Ackerman S. Tzagoloff A. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4128-4136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reduction of cytochrome b in thebc 1 complex from the Δcoq2 mutant is no longer triphasic (13.Snyder C.H. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31209-31216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Rather, in the absence of endogenous ubiquinone b, reduction is rapid and monophasic (Fig. 2,lower left). With 25 μm menaquinol, cytochromeb reduction occurred at 47 s−1. Cytochromec 1 reduction was considerably slower than the rate of cytochrome b reduction and occurred at 2.9 s−1. When antimycin was present, the reduction of cytochrome b in the absence of endogenous ubiquinone became biphasic, with each phase comprising 50% of the total absorbance change and rates of 18 s−1, and 3.4 s−1, respectively (Fig. 2,lower right). Antimycin changes the pattern of cytochromeb reduction in the bc 1 complex from the Δcoq2 mutant from monophasic to biphasic with rates that are similar to those observed with wild-type complex in the presence of antimycin. This similarity in rates of breduction is evident in the traces in the lower right andupper right panels of Fig. 2. The biphasic reduction of cytochrome b in thebc 1 complex from the Δcoq2 mutant in the presence of antimycin (Fig. 2, lower right) differs notably from that in the mutant in the absence of antimycin (Fig. 2,lower left), which is rapid and apparently monophasic. Also, the amount of b that is reduced in thebc 1 complex from the Δcoq2 mutant is significantly greater than in the wild-typebc 1 complex (Fig. 2, upper left). The amount of b reduced in the wild-type enzyme in the presence of antimycin (Fig. 2, upper right) is similar to that reduced in the bc 1 complex from the Δcoq2 mutant in the absence or presence of antimycin. The explanation for these differences in b reduction in the presence of antimycin and in the absence of endogenous ubiquinone is discussed below. Cytochrome c 1 reduction in thebc 1 complex from the Δcoq2 mutant was monophasic in the presence of antimycin and occurred at 3.1 s−1 (Fig. 2, lower right), compared with 2.9 s−1 in the bc 1 complex from the Δcoq2 mutant in the absence of ubiquinone (Fig. 2,lower left). These results indicate that when there is no endogenous ubiquinone, antimycin does not slow the rate of cytochromec 1 reduction. The rate ofc 1 reduction in the bc 1complex from the wild-type yeast in the presence of antimycin (1.8 s−1) is comparable with the rates in thebc 1 complex from the Δcoq2 mutant in the absence (2.9 s−1) or presence of antimycin (3.1 s−1), allowing for some variation in activities of different enzyme preparations. Also, in the bc 1complexes from both the wild-type yeast and the Δcoq2mutant in the presence of antimycin, where the reduction ofb is biphasic, the rate of c 1reduction matches the slow phase of b reduction. To more accurately determine the rates of cytochromec 1 reduction in the presence of antimycin and in the absence of endogenous ubiquinone, the rates were measured at multiple menaquinol concentrations, and second order rate constants for cytochrome c 1 reduction were calculated from the plots shown in Fig. 3. With wild-type enzyme, in which endogenous ubiquinone is present, the second order rate constant for cytochrome c 1 reduction varied, declining ∼4.5 fold from 6.9 × 105m−1 s−1 to 1.55 × 105m−1 s−1 as the concentration of menaquinol increased. The reason for the variable rate constant in the wild-type bc 1 complex in the absence of antimycin is discussed below. When antimycin was added, the rate constant decreased by 10-fold to 6.6 × 104m−1 s−1. With thebc 1 complex from the Δcoq2 mutant, the second order rate constant for c 1 reduction was 1.1 × 105m−1s−1, and when antimycin was added, the rate constant was unchanged. From these rate constants it is clear that in the presence of endogenous ubiquinone antimycin slows the rate ofc 1 reduction, but in the absence of endogenous ubiquinone, antimycin has no effect. The absence of endogenous ubiquinone appears to mimic the effect of antimycin on presteady state reduction of c 1 by menaquinol when ubiquinone is present. Usingbc 1 complexes in which the midpoint potential of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein was altered by site-directed mutations, we previously showed that there is a direct correlation between midpoint potential of the iron-sulfur protein and the catalytic activity of the enzyme (14.Denke E. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Hatzfeld O.M. Snyder C.H. Link T.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9085-9093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The mutations chosen for these studies did not change the stability of the protein or cause any structural change in the environment of the iron-sulfur cluster, as assessed by various spectroscopic methods (14.Denke E. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Hatzfeld O.M. Snyder C.H. Link T.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9085-9093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We also previously established that menaquinol reacts directly with thebc 1 complex at center P and not through endogenous ubiquinone (13.Snyder C.H. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31209-31216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16.Snyder C. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the present study we have examined the effects of iron-sulfur protein mid-point potential on the presteady state reduction kinetics of cytochromes b andc 1. In these experiments antimycin was included to isolate the reaction at center P, so that cytochrome breduction is linked to iron-sulfur protein reduction. With wild-type enzyme, in which iron-sulfur protein Em,7 = +285 mV (14.Denke E. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Hatzfeld O.M. Snyder C.H. Link T.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9085-9093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), cytochrome b reduction was biphasic and occurred at 58 s−1 and 9.6 s−1 (Fig.4, top left). Cytochromec 1 reduction was monophasic and occurred at 8.4 s−1. With the bc 1 complex containing iron-sulfur protein with a Y185F mutation (Em,7= +217 mV), b reduction was biphasic and occurred at 44 s−1 and 11.7 s−1 (Fig. 4, top right), whereas c 1 reduction was monophasic and occurred at 12.1 s−1. The decrease in the fast phase of b reduction in the bc 1 complex with the Y185F iron-sulfur protein compared with the rate in the wild-type enzyme is consistent with the decrease in the potential difference between the iron-sulfur protein and the substrate menaquinol. The increase in the rate of c 1reduction is also consistent with the decrease in iron-sulfur protein midpoint potential, which would be expected to increase the rate of electron transfer from the iron-sulfur protein toc 1. In the bc 1 complex containing the S183A iron-sulfur protein mutation (Em,7 = 155 mV) and thebc 1 complex containing the S183A/Y185F double mutation (Em,7 = 105 mV), reduction of both cytochromeb and c 1 was monophasic. With the S183A iron-sulfur protein mutation, the rate of b reduction was 15 times slower than the fast phase of b reduction in the wild-type enzyme, whereas the rate of c 1reduction was 2 times slower (Fig. 4). With thebc 1 complex containing the S183A/Y185F iron-sulfur protein double mutation, the rates of both b andc 1 reduction were 1.0 s−1, which are 58 times and 8 times slower than the corresponding rates in the wild-type enzyme. To demonstrate the effects of iron-sulfur protein midpoint potential on the rate of b reduction, second order rate constants were calculated and plotted versus iron-sulfur protein midpoint potential (Fig. 5). For this plot the midpoint potentials of the iron-sulfur proteins at pH 7 were used (14.Denke E. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Hatzfeld O.M. Snyder C.H. Link T.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9085-9093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, we also checked the mid-point potentials at pH 6.0 of the wild-type protein and the S183A and Y185F proteins and confirmed that the mutations do not eliminate the pH dependence of the midpoint potential. For the wild-type bc 1 complex the rate constant for b reduction was 8.2 × 105m−1 s−1. There is a direct correlation between the rate of b reduction and the midpoint potential of the iron-sulfur protein. For the enzymes with the S183A and the S183A/Y185F double mutations the rate constants decreased 13.4- and 75-fold, respectively. These results demonstrate that cytochromeb reduction is linked to and limited by the oxidation of quinol by the iron-sulfur protein. The oxidation of ubiquinol at center P has been thought to occur by a sequential mechanism in which the iron-sulfur protein oxidizes the quinol to semiquinone, which then reduces cytochromeb L (1.Trumpower B.L. Gennis R.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 675-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 3.Brandt U. Trumpower B.L. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that ubiquinol oxidation occurs by a concerted mechanism that requires that both the iron-sulfur protein and cytochrome b L be oxidized and that cytochrome b L reduction precedes iron-sulfur protein reduction of cytochromec 1. In the presteady state experiments, two molecules of menaquinol are sequentially oxidized at center P. During the first turnover, the iron-sulfur protein and cytochromeb L are reduced (reactions 1a–1c in Fig. 1). The iron-sulfur protein will remain predominately reduced since its potential is higher than that of cytochrome c 1. However, cytochromeb L will immediately reduce cytochromeb H, which then reduces ubiquinone to ubisemiquinone at center N (reactions 2 and 3 in Fig. 1). The second turnover at center P is dependent upon the redox state of cytochrome b L and the iron-sulfur protein and will only occur when both are oxidized. After the second turnover, both the iron-sulfur protein and cytochromec 1 are reduced, and the second electron in the low potential chain reduces semiquinone to ubiquinol at center N (reaction 4 in Fig. 1). When ubiquinone is absent or when antimycin occupies center N, the single electron introduced during the first turnover will remain in the low potential chain. If the second turnover at center P is not dependent upon the redox state of the low potential chain and solely dependent upon the iron-sulfur protein, then the rate of cytochromec 1 reduction should remain unchanged. However, we have shown that when ubiquinone is absent or when antimycin is present, the rate of cytochrome c 1 reduction is dramatically slowed. Furthermore, antimycin had no additional slowing effect when ubiquinone is absent. These results show that equilibration of an electron between cytochrome b H andb L in the low potential chain slows reduction of the high potential chain. This suggests that ubiquinol oxidation at center P occurs by a concerted mechanism in which the redox status of the low potential chain exerts reciprocal control on reduction of the high potential chain. This same effect accounts for the decline in the second order rate constant for c 1 reduction in the wild-typebc 1 complex as the concentration of menaquinol increases. We previously showed that menaquinol reduces the endogenous ubiquinone by a transhydrogenase reaction at center N, and this reaction is slower than the direct reduction of b andc 1 through center P (13.Snyder C.H. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31209-31216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It would be expected that as the menaquinol concentration increases, the endogenous ubiquinone would become partly reduced, resulting in equilibration of an electron between ubiquinone and the low potential chain and a reciprocal slowing of reduction of the high potential chain. Consequently, as the concentration of menaquinol increases, the second order rate constant for c 1 reduction in the wild-type enzyme approaches the rate constants seen in the presence of antimycin or absence of ubiquinone. The slowing effect of antimycin on presteady state reduction of cytochrome c 1 that we have described here was first reported by Degli-Esposti and Lenaz (17.Degli-Esposti M. Lenaz G. FEBS Lett. 1982; 277: 49-53Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar), although they interpreted this result as a block of electron transfer between cytochrome b and c 1 and inconsistent with the protonmotive Q cycle mechanism. We attribute this effect of antimycin to lack of equilibration of ferro-cytochromeb H with ubiquinone through center N (reactions 4 and 5 in Fig. 1), as evidenced by duplication of the effect in bc 1 complex that lacks ubiquinone, and explain these results in terms of a concerted oxidation mechanism in the Q cycle. Elsewhere we have shown that the inhibitory effect of antimycin on catalytic activity of thebc 1 complex is distinct from the slowing effect manifested during presteady state reduction of the enzyme (18.Bowyer J.R. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2245-2251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have also shown that there is a direct correlation between the midpoint potential of the iron-sulfur protein and the rate of cytochrome b reduction, the other half of the reciprocal control implicit in a concerted mechanism whereby the high potential chain controls reduction of the low potential chain. These results agree with previous findings that the oxidation of ubiquinol by the iron-sulfur protein is the rate-limiting step under conditions of catalytic turnover and that the midpoint potential of the iron-sulfur protein is quantitatively the predominant determinant of that rate (14.Denke E. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Hatzfeld O.M. Snyder C.H. Link T.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9085-9093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The effects of iron-sulfur protein midpoint potential on rates of cytochrome b reduction are incompatible with linear mechanisms of the type QH2 → [b H , b L] → ISP →c 1 → c, in which ubiquinol reduces cytochrome b H, which then reduces the iron-sulfur protein via cytochrome b L (19.Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9283-9288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). If ubiquinol reduces cytochrome b directly, the midpoint potential of the iron-sulfur protein should have no effect upon the rate of b reduction. However, our results clearly show that as the midpoint potential of the iron-sulfur protein decreases, the rate of b reduction decreases. We observed that the amount of cytochrome b that is reduced in the bc 1 complex from the Δcoq2mutant is greater than in the wild-type bc 1complex (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the addition of antimycin to the wild-type enzyme caused the extent of b reduction to be identical to that in the Δcoq2 mutant. These differences are due to reoxidation of cytochrome bthrough center N, which is obviated by the absence of endogenous ubiquinone or inhibited by antimycin when ubiquinone is present (13.Snyder C.H. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31209-31216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). When antimycin is present, reduction of cytochrome b is biphasic, both in the absence or presence of endogenous ubiquinone. This is because when antimycin occupies center N, the first electron to enter the low potential chain cannot equilibrate with ubiquinone but remains in the b cytochromes. Entry of a second electron into the low potential chain is then limited by the distribution of the first electron between the two b hemes if they cannot equilibrate with ubiquinone. Consequently, in these presteady state experiments antimycin inhibits entry of the second electron into the high potential chain but has no effect on the first turnover of the enzyme. The basis for the concerted mechanism of ubiquinol oxidation can be seen in a thermodynamic profile of the redox components of thebc 1 complex as shown in Fig.6. Reciprocal control of ubiquinol oxidation by the low potential and high potential redox components of the bc 1 complex results from thermodynamic coupling of the electron transfer from ubiquinol to iron-sulfur protein to electron transfer from ubisemiquinone to cytochromeb L. The essential feature of this coupling is that the potential of the Q⨪/QH2 couple is too high to reduce the Rieske iron-sulfur cluster unless the potential is lowered by removal of Q⨪ by reduction of cytochromeb L as suggested by Jünemann et al. (7.Jünemann S. Heathcote P. Rich P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21603-21607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). If a conservatively estimated 10-fold lowering of the semiquinone:quinol ratio is required to bring the Q⨪/QH2 couple within the redox range of the Rieske center (Em,7 = +285 mV), this would require that Em,7 (Q⨪/QH2) be at least +340 mV. The resulting low potential of the Q/Q⨪ couple (−160 mV) would provide a significant kinetic advantage to reduction of heme b L (Em,7 = −60 mV) by ubisemiquinone. The exergonic nature of this reaction and the proximity of the semiquinone to heme b L(5.Zhang Z.L. Huang L.S. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y.I. Kim K.K. Hung L.W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar) would ensure that this electron transfer is extremely rapid provided heme b L is oxidized. Several consequences follow from the potentials of the semiquinone couples associated with a concerted mechanism of this type. If Em (Q⨪/QH2) = +340 mV, then the equilibrium constant for formation of ubisemiquinone from quinone and quinol would be ∼4.6 × 10−9. In EPR experiments in which the concentration of bc 1 complex is typically 10–50 μm, this equilibrium would have to be shifted 8 orders of magnitude to detect one equivalent of semiquinone. Clearly, this paramagnetic species, if it exists, is below the limits of detection by EPR spectroscopy. The formation of superoxide anion by the bc 1complex, a reaction that occurs at center P and is stimulated by antimycin (21.Ksenzenko M. Konstantinov A.A. Khomutove G.B. Tikhonov A.N. Ruuge E.K. FEBS Letts. 1983; 155: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), also depends on the potentials of the semiquinone couples and, by inference, the stability of the semiquinone. This reaction most likely results from aberrant reduction of oxygen instead of b L by ubisemiquinone. The one-electron reduction of oxygen requires a relatively strong reductant, since Em,7(O2/O2−) = −330 mV in aqueous solvents (22.Fee J.A. Valentine J.S. Michelson A.M. McCord J.M. Fridovich I. Superoxide and Superoxide Dismutases. Academic Press, Inc., New York1977: 19-60Google Scholar). If one assumes Em (Q/Q⨪) = −280 mV is sufficiently low to allow the observed rates of superoxide anion formation, it would infer that Em (Q⨪/QH2) = +460 mV and that the stability constant of the reacting ubisemiquinone is extremely low, ∼4.6 × 10−13. These considerations suggest that the semiquinone that reacts with oxygen is highly unstable. The thermodynamic profile in Fig. 6 also illustrates why cytochromeb reduction in the bc 1 complex from the wild-type yeast and in the enzyme with the Y185F iron-sulfur mutation is biphasic, whereas b reduction in the enzymes with the S183A and S183A/Y185F iron-sulfur mutations is monophasic. Oxidation of the second menaquinol molecule at center P is limited by the distribution of the first electron in the high potential chain between iron-sulfur protein and cytochrome c 1. Only when the iron-sulfur protein is oxidized can the second molecule of menaquinol reduce the iron-sulfur protein and cytochromeb L. The midpoint potential of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein is pH-dependent, and this pH dependence is also manifested in the iron-sulfur proteins carrying site-directed mutations. At pH 6 the midpoint potential is +305 mV in the wild-type protein and +250 mV in the iron-sulfur protein with the Y185F mutation (23.Link T.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1185: 81-84Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 24.Snyder C.H. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Link T.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). With both of these iron-sulfur proteins the equilibrium of the first electron in the high potential chain between the iron-sulfur protein and cytochrome c 1 lies more toward the iron-sulfur protein. This causes b reduction to be biphasic. The fast phase of b reduction is linked to the optically invisible reduction of the Rieske center, whereas the rate of the second, slow phase matches that of c 1 reduction (Fig. 4). The midpoint potential of the iron-sulfur protein with the S183A mutation, Em = +185 mV at pH 6 (24.Snyder C.H. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Link T.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), is lower than that ofc 1 (+240 mV), and the midpoint potential of the S183A/Y185F iron-sulfur protein is even lower (14.Denke E. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Hatzfeld O.M. Snyder C.H. Link T.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9085-9093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Thus, in the bc 1 complexes from these mutants, the first electron entering the high potential chain will be predominately located in cytochrome c 1, and cytochrome b reduction will proceed as fast as the menaquinol can be oxidized at center P. The latter reaction is slowed so much by the decrease in iron-sulfur protein midpoint potential that entry of a second electron into the low potential chain is not limited by the distribution of the first electron between the two bhemes. Consequently, in the bc 1 complexes with the S183A and the S183A/Y185F iron-sulfur protein mutations, reduction of b is slow and monophasic. From these results, we propose a mechanism for the divergent oxidation of ubiquinol at center P that incorporates iron-sulfur protein mobility and concerted electron transfer. The overall mechanism can be summarized by a minimum of four steps designated 1a-1d, the first three of which are concerted as described in Fig. 1. The concerted reaction begins when ubiquinol replaces the ionizable proton from the imidazole nitrogen of histidine-181, which is one of the ligands to the redox active iron of the Rieske cluster (25.Iwata S. Saynowits M. Link T.A. Michel H. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 567-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), to form a ubiquinol-imidazolate complex (reaction 1a in Fig. 1). Formation of a ubiquinol-imidazolate complex in this manner circumvents prerequisite ionization of ubiquinol, which has a pK a = 11.25 (26.Rich P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 53-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). It is this reaction that is responsible for the pK a = 6.5–6.7 component of the bell-shaped activity versus pH curves documented in both bovine and yeast bc 1 complexes by Brandt and Okun (27.Brandt U. Okum J.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11234-11240Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The ubiquinol-imidazolate complex is the electron donor for the redox active iron (reaction 1b in Fig. 1). This electron transfer does not occur unless the resulting semiquinone is simultaneously removed by reduction of cytochromeb L (reaction 1c in Fig. 1), which only occurs when the iron-sulfur protein is in proximity to cytochromeb L. This linkage is the basis of the concerted reaction. As noted above, the low potential of the Q/Q⨪ couple and the proximity of the semiquinone to hemeb L cause this reaction to be extremely fast, provided that b L is oxidized. Binding of ubiquinol only occurs when the iron-sulfur protein is proximal to cytochrome b, since formation of the ubiquinol-imidazolate complex (reaction 1a) is dependent on reduction of b L by the semiquinone (reaction 1c). If either cytochromeb L or iron-sulfur protein is reduced, ubiquinol oxidation cannot occur, and ubiquinol cannot bind. As cytochromeb is reduced and ubiquinone dissociates, the reduced iron-sulfur protein moves to the cytochrome c 1position, and electron transfer to c 1 ensues (reaction 1d in Fig. 1). In this manner association of ubiquinol and dissociation of ubiquinone are linked to the movement of the iron-sulfur protein between the interfaces of cytochromeb and cytochrome c 1. The overall rate of the concerted reaction can be influenced by several constituent reactions. The rate of electron transfer into the cluster is determined by the increment in redox potential between the ubiquinol-imidazolate complex and the iron-sulfur cluster, and this increment is the predominant determinant of the catalytic activity of the enzyme (14.Denke E.

In addition to the dependence on midpoint potential of the Rieske protein, the rate of ubiquinol oxidation is also partly determined by the rate of formation of the ubiquinol-imidazolate complex, reflected in the pH dependence of the ubiquinol-cytochromec reductase reaction (27.Brandt U.

Mammalian functional homologues for all yeast COPII components, except for Sec31p, have been reported. We have cloned a mammalian cDNA whose product (Sec31A) is about 26% identical to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sec31p. Data base searches also revealed another partial sequence encoding a polypeptide (Sec31B) that is 40% identical to Sec31A. Northern analysis revealed that Sec31A transcripts are ubiquitously and abundantly expressed, while Sec31B transcripts are particularly enriched in the testis and thymus, but present in very low levels in other tissues. Sec31A is localized to vesicular structures that scatter throughout the cell but are concentrated at the perinuclear region. The structures marked by Sec31A contain Sec13, a component of COPII that is well characterized to mark the ER exit sites. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that Sec31A colocalizes with Sec13 in structures with extensive vesicular-tubular profiles. Antibodies raised against a C-terminal portion of Sec31A co-precipitate Sec13 and inhibit ER-Golgi transport of temperature-arrested vesicular stomatitis G protein in a semi-intact cell assay. Cytosol immunodepleted of Sec31A failed to support vesicular stomatitis G protein transport, which can be rescued by a high molecular weight fraction of the cytosol containing both Sec31A and Sec13.

Vesicle formation from yeast microsomal membranes has been reconstituted in vitro with three purified components from yeast cytosol, Sar1p, Sec23p·Sec24p complex, and Sec13p·Sec31p complex (9.Salama N. Yeung R.T. Schekman R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4073-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Together, these proteins form the COPII coat complex (10.Barlowe C. Orci L. Yeung T. Hosobuchi M.

They represent a set of coat proteins functioning in the early secretory pathway which are distinct from the COPI coat complex, first discovered in mammalian cells and have been proposed to mediate anterograde and retrograde transport in the secretory pathway (11.Barlowe C.

The first mechanistic understanding of the function of various components of COPII with regard to vesicle formation came from the yeast system (14.Kuehn M.J. Herrmann J.M. Schekman R. Nature. 1998; 391: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In the initiation of COPII vesicle budding, the small GTPase Sar1p (6.Nakano A. Muramatsu M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2677-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) is first recruited onto the ER membrane, at least in part, through a guanine nucleotide exchange reaction catalyzed by the ER membrane protein Sec12p (6.Nakano A. Muramatsu M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2677-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Sar1p on the membrane then recruits the Sec23p·Sec24p complex (15.Hicke L. Barlowe C. Schekman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Sec23p is a GTPase-activating protein of Sar1p (16.Yoshihisa T. Barlowe C. Schekman R. Science. 1993; 259: 1466-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The resulting Sar1p-Sec23p·Sec24p complex appears to be important for cargo binding (14.Kuehn M.J. Herrmann J.M. Schekman R. Nature. 1998; 391: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Although tightly associated with Sec23p in the cytosol, Sec24p apparently does not influence the GTPase-activating protein activity of Sec23p and its exact function is unclear (15.Hicke L. Barlowe C. Schekman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Subsequent recruitment of the WD-40 repeat containing (17.Garcia-Higuera I. Fenoglio J. Li Y. Lewis C.

Most of the corresponding mammalian homologs of yeast COPII components have now been cloned, except for Sec31p.

Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), although there exist yeast proteins homologous to Sec13p (28.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol.

We now report the existence of two mammalian proteins that are homologous to yeast Sec31p, one (Sec31A) that is abundantly and ubiquitously expressed while the other (Sec31B) is enriched in the testis and thymus. The morphological, biochemical, and functional characterization of Sec31A suggest that it is indeed a component of mammalian COPII involved in ER-Golgi transport. Data base searches were performed with the various Basic Local Alignment Search Tools (BLAST) algorithms (27.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J.

Library screening, cloning, and DNA sequencing were performed using standard methods as described (29.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). TheEcoRI-NotI insert of an EST clone (GenBank accession number AA423899) was 32P-labeled and used as a probe to screen a human pancreas UniZap cDNA library (Strategene) by DNA in situ hybridization. Positive clones with insert sizes larger than 3 kilobase were sequenced. Polymerase chain reactions were carried out using high fidelity Pfu polymerase from Strategene. Fragments of the cDNA obtained were generated by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pGEX-4T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for the production of fusion proteins in bacteria. Northern blot analyses were performed using human multiple tissue Northern (MTN) blots from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). A full-length cDNA is used as a probe for Sec31A. For Sec31B, a fragment of about 500 base pairs corresponding to a non-homologous region of Sec31B to Sec31A was generated by polymerase chain reaction and used as a probe. Polyclonal antibody against mammalian Sec13 has been described previously (8.Tang B.L. Peter F. Krijnse-Locker J. Low S.H. Griffiths G. Hong W. Mol. Cell.

Polyclonal antibodies against Sec31A in this study were obtained by immunization of mice and rabbits with a soluble glutathione S-transferase fusion construct corresponding to the C-terminal 180 amino acids of the Sec31 coding region. Cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (8.Tang B.L. Peter F. Krijnse-Locker J. Low S.H.

Briefly, normal rat kidney cells were grown on 10-cm dishes to confluence and infected with the temperature-sensitive strain of the vesicular stomatitis virus, VSVts045 at 32 °C for 3–4 h. The cells were then pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml) at the restrictive temperature (40 °C) for 10 min and perforated on ice by hypotonic swelling and scraping. These semi-intact cells were then incubated in a complete assay mixture of 40 μl containing 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 90 mmpotassium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm EGTA, 1.8 mm calcium chloride, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 0.2 IU of rabbit muscle creatine phosphokinase, 25 μg of rat liver cytosol, and 5 μl (25–30 μg) of protein for 1–2 × 105) of semi-intact cells. For a standard assay, samples were incubated for 90 min at 32 °C and transport terminated by transferring to ice. The membranes were collected by a brief spin and solubilized in 60 μl of 0.2% SDS, 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5. After boiling for 5 min, the samples were digested overnight at 37 °C in the presence of 2.5 units of endoglycosidase H (endo H), and the reaction was terminated by adding 5× concentrated gel sample buffer. The samples were analyzed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and quantified using the PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). For antibody inhibition of transport assay, antibodies were added into the complete assay mixture and incubated on ice for 60 min to allow the antibodies to first diffuse completely into the semi-intact cells. Data base searches using the yeast Sec31p sequence (7.Salama N.R. Chuang J.S. Schekman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 36.Zieler H.A. Walberg M. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3227-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) revealed several human EST clones encoding polypeptides with significant homology to Sec31p outside the WD-40 repeat region. We screened a human pancreas cDNA library using the insert from one of these ESTs (GenBank number AA423899) as a probe. DNA sequencing of positive clones revealed an open reading frame of 1218 amino acids. Alignment of the amino acid sequences of this mammalian protein with Sec31p is shown in Fig.1 A. It shares 25.8% identity with Sec31p, with homology throughout the entire coding region. Five WD-40 or WD-40-like repeats are present at the N terminus. There is a region enriched in proline residues in the C-terminal half. These features are similar to the domain profile of Sec31p. Although the homology between this protein and Sec31p is not as high as those found between Sar1p as well as Sec23p and their mammalian homologues (about 50%), the domain similarities suggest that this protein is a candidate for a mammalian homologue of Sec31p. We have therefore tentatively named this protein Sec31A. Data base search using the Sec31A sequence also revealed homology with a S. pombe and a Caenorhabditis elegans protein (Fig. 1 B). These proteins also contained a region of WD-40 repeats at the N terminus and a stretch of proline-rich sequence in the C-terminal half. The most recent data base search also revealed identical full-length human clones, an alternatively spliced product, and a rat orthologue cDNA. Most interestingly, we have also identified a partial human cDNA (DKFZp434M183) encoding a 915-residue polypeptide (tentatively named Sec31B) that is about 40% identical to the C-terminal two-thirds of Sec31A. DKFZp434M183 was cloned from testis and subsequently made available to us by the Resource Center, German Human Genome Project, German Cancer Research Center. Northern blot analysis for Sec31A revealed a transcript of about 4 kilobases in length that is abundantly and ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined (Fig. 2). Ubiquitous expression is indeed a feature expected of an essential molecule like Sec31. We have also investigated the expression pattern of Sec31B using a polymerase chain reaction-generated fragment to a region that bears no homology to Sec31A. The Sec31B transcript is about 6.5 kilobases and is present at very low levels in most tissues compared with Sec31A. Further analysis with a different tissue panel showed that the Sec31B transcripts are particularly enriched in the thymus and testis. This finding explains our failure in finding other ESTs (except those from the same testis library) corresponding to Sec31B. Sec31A bears a relatively low homology to yeast Sec31p, while the homology of mammalian Sar1 and Sec23 to their respective yeast counterparts is much higher. This relatively weak homology brings into question as to whether Sec31A is a functional homologue of Sec31p. To facilitate our morphological, biochemical, and functional characterization of Sec31A, antibodies were raised in both mice and rabbits using a recombinant fragment representing the C-terminal portion Sec31A. Both mouse (not shown) and rabbit antisera detected a protein of about 150 kDa in all primate and rodent cells examined (Fig.3 A), which is in agreement with the size of the in vitro translated product. Indirect immunofluorescence revealed that Sec31A is associated with vesicular structures that are concentrated at the perinuclear region but are also found scattered at the cell periphery (Fig. 3 B). The staining pattern of Sec31A is highly reminiscent of that for mammalian Sar1 (20.Kuge O. Dasher C. Orci L. Rowe T. Amherdt M. Plutner H. Ravazzola M. Tanigawa T. Rothman J.E. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), Sec13 (8.Tang B.L. Peter F. Krijnse-Locker J. Low S.H. Griffiths G. Hong W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 256-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), Sec23A (22.Pagano A. Letourneur F. Garcia-Estefania D. Carpentier J.-L. Orci L. Paccaud J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7833-7840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and Sec24 (22.Pagano A. Letourneur F. Garcia-Estefania D. Carpentier J.-L. Orci L. Paccaud J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7833-7840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), which is characteristic of ER exit sites (37.Hong W. Tang B.L. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Indeed, double labeling using mouse antiserum against Sec31A and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Sec13 showed that Sec31A colocalized well with Sec13 (Fig.4 A). Colocalization of Sec31A with an established component of mammalian COPII (Sec13) strongly supports the notion that Sec31A is also a COPII component. Coat components in both yeast and mammalian cells are recruited onto the membrane in a GTP-dependent manner. In the cases of COPI and COPII, component recruitment is initiated, respectively, by the binding and activation of the small GTPases Arf and Sar1 by their respective guanine nucleotide exchange proteins on the membrane. The localization of Sec31A on Sec13 positive membrane structures prompted us to examine if its membrane recruitment is GTP-dependent. The membrane labeling is lost or greatly diminished when cells are permeabilized with digitonin and washed extensively (Fig.4 B). This indicates that Sec31A is not tightly associated with the membrane. The very prominent localization of the protein on the membrane under steady state conditions in vivo is probably dependent on constant recruitment from the cytosol. When the permeabilized and washed cells are incubated with cytosol, binding of the protein to specific membrane structures can be observed, suggesting that there is a specific recruitment process rather than nonspecific binding. The signal observed, however, is weak compared with that in normal, unpermeabilized cells. The level of membrane association of Sec31A is greatly enhanced, approximating that in normal cells, when 0.1 μm of the nonhydrolysable GTP analog GTPγS is added to the incubation. These results indicate that recruitment of Sec31A onto membrane structures marked by Sec13 is GTP-dependent. We further examined the subcellular localization of Sec31A at the ultrastructural level. Double immunogold labeling of Sec31A and Sec13 revealed that they are both enriched in structures with a vesiculated membrane profile around the Golgi apparatus (Fig.5). This is consistent with the results obtained at the light microscopy level. Examination at a higher magnification showed that the structures in which both Sec13 and Sec31A are concentrated appear to consist of buds, vesicles, and tubules. These structures are likely to be the sites of COPII vesicle budding from the ER. The colocalization of Sec31A with Sec13 led us to examine whether the two proteins interact in vivo. As shown in Fig.6, antibodies against Sec31A co-precipitates the 36-kDa Sec13. In the reciprocal experiment, antibodies against Sec13 (8.Tang B.L. Peter F. Krijnse-Locker J. Low S.H. Griffiths G. Hong W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 256-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) co-precipitates the 150-kDa Sec31A. This interaction between Sec31A and Sec13 manifested by co-immunoprecipitation is specific because Sec23, another COPII component in the cytosol, does not co-precipitate with either Sec31A or Sec13 under the same conditions. We further examined the Sec13·Sec31A complex by gel filtration. When rat liver cytosol was subjected to gel filtration in a Superose 6 medium (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), the majority of Sec13 as well as Sec31A were fractionated to high molecular weight fractions of about 600–700 kDa (Fig. 6 E). A very small fraction of each is also found in low molecular weight fractions with sizes corresponding to monomeric forms of the respective proteins. In view of the fact that Sec13 and Sec31A exists essentially in a complex in the cytosol, we have estimated their interaction stoichiometry based on the incorporation of [35S]methionine into the polypeptides. HeLa cells starved in medium without methionine was subsequently incubated for 5 h in medium containing 0.25 mCi/ml [35S]methionine. Lysates of the cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibody against Sec13 and antibody against Sec31A. When resolved on a SDS-PAGE gel, both immunoprecipitates contain bands corresponding to Sec13 (36 kDa) and Sec31A (150 kDa) in similar ratios, and subsequent quantitation of the bands by scintillation counting revealed an approximate 1:1 stoichiometry of the two proteins. The subcellular colocalization and biochemical interaction between the Sec31A and Sec13 strongly suggest that Sec31A may represent the functional counterpart of yeast Sec31p. We have therefore sought further functional evidence for the involvement of Sec31A in ER-Golgi transport. We used a permeabilized cell system monitoring the transport of temperature-synchronized vesicular stomatitis virus (ts045 strain) G protein (VSVG) (8.Tang B.L. Peter F. Krijnse-Locker J. Low S.H.

As shown in Fig.7 A, the fusion protein between the C-terminal 180 amino acids of Sec31A and GST (GST-Sec31A) inhibited VSVG transport, as does GST-Sec22B (34.Zhang T. Wong S.H. Tang B.L. Xu Y. Hong W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 435-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), whereas GST itself had no effect. Antibodies raised against GST-Sec31A also inhibited transport, as do antibodies against Bet1 (35.Zhang T. Wong S.H. Tang B.L. Xu Y. Peter F. Subramaniam V.N. Hong W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and Sec22B (34.Zhang T. Wong S.H. Tang B.L. Xu Y. Hong W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 435-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), whereas control rabbit IgG has no effect. The inhibitory activity of Sec31A antibodies could be inactivated by heat denaturation (not shown). The fact that antibodies against Sec31A inhibit ER-Golgi transport as do antibodies against SNARE molecules like Bet1 (35.Zhang T. Wong S.H. Tang B.L. Xu Y. Peter F. Subramaniam V.N. Hong W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), Sec22B (34.Zhang T. Wong S.H. Tang B.L. Xu Y. Hong W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 435-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and GS28 (38.Subramaniam V.N. Peter F. Philp R. Wong S.H. Hong W. Science. 1996; 272: 1161-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) strongly suggest that Sec31A is involved in ER-Golgi transport. We next examine if the presence of Sec31A in the cytosol is essential for ER-Golgi transport. To do this, we immunodepleted Sec31A from rat liver cytosol and compared the efficacy of the Sec31A-depleted cytosol in supporting VSVG transport to cytosol mock-depleted with rabbit IgG. As shown in Fig. 7 B, Sec31A-depleted cytosol was unable to support VSVG transport to any significant level even at high concentrations. Sec31A, in complex with Sec13, is likely to be the missing ingredient from the Sec31A-depleted cytosol that resulted in lost of transport activity. To prove this, we checked if the high molecular weight fraction enriched in Sec31A and Sec13 could restore the transport activity of Sec31A-depleted cytosol. As shown in Fig. 7 C, the Sec31A depleted-cytosol and the high molecular size fraction by themselves do not support transport. However, addition of the high molecular size fraction to Sec31A-depleted cytosol efficiently restores its transport activity, to a level comparable to that of normal cytosol. The above results suggest that Sec31A is essential for the ER-Golgi transport of VSVG. Sec31p was first discovered as a 150-kDa protein interacting with Sec13p in the yeast cytosol (39.Pryer N.K. Salama N. Schekman R. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and was shown biochemically to be essential for vesicle formation from the ER (9.Salama N. Yeung R.T. Schekman R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4073-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 39.Pryer N.K. Salama N. Schekman R. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The SEC31 gene was subsequently cloned by complementation of the temperature sensitiveSec31-1 allele (7.Salama N.R. Chuang J.S. Schekman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). SEC31 was also cloned separately as WEB1, allele-specific mutations of which lead to growth dependence on the adenovirus E1A protein (36.Zieler H.A. Walberg M. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3227-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this report, we described two mammalian proteins that are homologous to Sec31p. Sec31A is abundantly and ubiquitously expressed, while Sec31B is enriched in the thymus and testis. Although sharing a mere 26% homology to yeast Sec31p, three lines of evidence suggest that Sec31A is a functional counterpart of Sec31p. First, Sec31A colocalized well with Sec13. Without any recognizable hydrophobic sequences that would serve as a membrane anchor, Sec31A nevertheless showed membrane staining patterns which are very similar to that of other known mammalian COPII components (8.Tang B.L. Peter F. Krijnse-Locker J. Low S.H. Griffiths G. Hong W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 256-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 20.Kuge O. Dasher C. Orci L. Rowe T. Amherdt M. Plutner H. Ravazzola M. Tanigawa T. Rothman J.E. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 21.Paccaud J.P. Reith W. Carpentier J.L. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Schekman R. Orci L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1535-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 22.Pagano A. Letourneur F. Garcia-Estefania D. Carpentier J.-L. Orci L. Paccaud J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7833-7840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This suggests that they were recruited to the same membrane structures, a fact that is further verified by the observation at the ultrastructural level that both Sec31A and Sec13 are present in vesicular-tubular structures characteristic of the ER exit sites. Moreover, like Sec13 and other COPII components, recruitment of Sec31A to membranes is GTP-dependent, and recruitment in permeabilized cells is greatly enhanced by the nonhydrolysable analog GTPγS. Second, Sec31A exists in a protein complex with Sec13. In the cytosol, antibodies against Sec31A and antibodies against Sec13 can reciprocally co-immunoprecipitate one another. On the other hand, Sec23, whose yeast counterpart Sec23p has been shown to be in a different complex (the Sec23p-Sec24p complex) in the cytosol (15.Hicke L. Barlowe C. Schekman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), could not be co-immunoprecipitated by either antibodies. Sec31A also cofractionates with Sec13 to a high molecular weight fraction, as determined by gel filtration analysis of rat liver cytosol. It is interesting to note that the high molecular weight complex of Sec31A and Sec13 could not be formed easily in vitro, for example, by simply mixing thein vitro translation products of Sec31A and Sec13 (data not shown). The cytosolic environment may therefore aid complex formationin vivo, perhaps also with the help of chaperone proteins. Finally, we demonstrated that Sec31A is essential for ER-Golgi transport. Both the C-terminal 180-amino acid fusion protein as well as antibodies against Sec31A inhibited ER-Golgi transport of VSVG in a semi-intact cell system. Immunodepletion of Sec31A from the cytosol impaired its ability to support transport. This impairment could be rescued by the high molecular fractions containing Sec31A and Sec13. Taken together, the evidence for Sec31A being a mammalian equivalent of yeast Sec31p is compelling. It appears that most mammalian COPII components have more isoforms than their yeast counterparts. This is probably a reflection of the higher level of sophistication and complexity in the mammalian machinery and also perhaps a need to delegate the recruitment of specific subsets of cargo proteins to combinations of different COPII components. It is not difficult to envisage that in cells specializing in the secretion of particular proteins, there may exist cell type-specific isoforms of a general component of the transport machinery. However, it is not clear at present if the thymus and testis-enriched Sec31B functions in COPII vesicle formation. While this report is under review, Shugrue et al. (40.Shugrue C.A. Kolen E.R. Peters H. Czernik A. Kaiser C. Matovcik L. Hubbard A.L. Gorelick F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4547-4556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported the cloning and characterization of a rat protein, p137, that bears about 90% identity to Sec31A. The rat protein is also ubiquitously expressed in rat tissues and is very likely the rat orthologue of human Sec31A. The coat protein complexes responsible for vesicle budding in the early secretory pathway share a similar feature in the mechanism of membrane recruitment, via the activation and membrane recruitment of a small GTPase. The components of the COPI complex exist in the cytosol as a seven-polypeptide complex (known as the coatomer) and is recruiteden bloc onto the membrane via activation of Arf (41.Hara-Kuge S.O. Orci L. Amherdt M. Ravazzola M. Wieland F.T. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In contrast, COPII proteins exist as smaller subcomplexes in the cytosol and are sequentially recruited onto the membrane (9.Salama N. Yeung R.T. Schekman R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4073-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 14.Kuehn M.J. Herrmann J.M. Schekman R. Nature. 1998; 391: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 42.Aridor M. Weissman J. Bannykh S. Nuoffer N. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Although the Sec23-24 complex together with activated Sar1 are apparently important for the recruitment of cargo proteins to the budding sites (14.Kuehn M.J. Herrmann J.M. Schekman R. Nature. 1998; 391: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 42.Aridor M. Weissman J. Bannykh S. Nuoffer N. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), the role of subsequent binding of Sec13·Sec31 complex is unknown. It is speculated that these proteins perhaps serve a function analogous to that of clathrin triskelons in clathrin-coated vesicles (43.Hirst J. Robinson M.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 173-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), in that they may cluster bound components together with cargo molecules into the shape of coated vesicles. In support of this, yeast Sec31p has been shown to interact directly with both Sec23p and Sec24pin vitro as well as in the context of the yeast two-hybrid system (44.Shaywitz D.A. Espenshade P.J. Gimeno R.E. Kaiser C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25413-25416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It may also be relevant to note that the native Sec13·Sec31 complex is large, presumably multimeric, and will be well suited for the proposed function. It has also been shown that yeast Sec31p interacts with Sec16p, a peripheral membrane protein tightly associated with the ER membrane (44.Shaywitz D.A. Espenshade P.J. Gimeno R.E. Kaiser C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25413-25416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Sec16p, which also binds to Sec23p and Sec24p, is a large multidomain protein which may serve a docking function in bringing all the COPII components together (45.Gimeno R.E. Espenshade P.J. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although the mammalian homologue of Sec16p has not yet been cloned, its existence was recently demonstrated as a band immunologically related to Sec16p in a GST-Sec23 pull-down experiment (46.Tani K. Mizoguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Hatsuzawa K. Tagaya M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20505-20512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It is interesting that the domain responsible for interacting with Sec16p was mapped to the C terminus of Sec31p, as it may account for the transport inhibitory effect of the C-terminal fusion protein as well as the antibodies against this region of Sec31A. The mechanism of inhibition, however, is probably more than a simple inhibition of binding or recruitment, as the antibody does not inhibit the recruitment of the Sec13·Sec31 complex onto membranes in vitro (data not shown). The Sec13p·Sec31p complex in the yeast cytosol appears to consist of only those two proteins (39.Pryer N.K. Salama N. Schekman R. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and we have not yet been able to identify any other proteins that may be associated with the Sec13·Sec31A complex in rat liver cytosol. It may be that interactions of other proteins with the Sec13·Sec31A complex in the cytosol are not robust enough to be detected by coprecipitation methods. However, both Sec13 and Sec31A may well interact with proteins other than Sec23 and Sec24 when recruited onto the membrane. In fact, our immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled total cell lystes with either antibodies against Sec13 or Sec31A revealed several bands with molecular sizes distinct from Sec23, Sec24, or Sar1 (data not shown). There is a precedence for interactions of COPII components with other proteins in a Sar1-independent manner. Sec23A has been recently shown to interact directly with p125, a protein with homology to phospholipid-modifying proteins (46.Tani K. Mizoguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Hatsuzawa K. Tagaya M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20505-20512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Yeast Sec24p has been shown to interact specifically with the cis-Golgi syntaxin Sed5p (47.Peng R. Grabowski R. De Antoni A. Gallwitz D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3751-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The WD-40 repeats at the N terminus of Sec31 are known motifs for protein-protein interaction. This domain of Sec31p presumably interacts with Sec13p (36.Zieler H.A. Walberg M. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3227-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), but may well bind other proteins. The C-terminal half of Sec31A contains a proline-rich region with several SH3 binding consensus sites (XPXXP) (48.Mongiovi A.M. Romano P.R. Panni S. Mendoza M. Wong W.T. Musacchio A. Cesareni G. Paolo Di Fiore P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5300-5309Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). As the last complex of COPII to be recruited onto membranes prior to vesicle formation, it makes sense to link this complex to regulatory mechanisms. It would not, therefore, be surprising if Sec31 interacts with other proteins regulating COPII vesicle formation. We thank Dr Jean-Pierre Paccaud (University of Geneva Medical Center, Switzerland) for antiserum against human Sec23A."

Despite important advances in protein chemistry, current understanding of the structure-function relationship is still very limited. This precludes in most cases knowledge-based modification of the protein structure to achieve a desired function. An alternative approach, directed evolution, has been proposed as a strategy for protein engineering. Directed evolution follows the traditional scheme of alternating steps of mutation and selection used for the development of industrial strains with improved properties, but in this case the subject of the mutagenesis is a defined gene or set of genes, and the selection is applied to the function(s) encoded. This method has some requirements as follows: the gene encoding the protein to be modified has to be functionally expressed in a suitable microbial host, and there must be an effective screening procedure for the desired activity or function (1.Kuchner O. Arnold F.H. Trends Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 523-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The properties of the β-glucosidase encoded by the bglAgene of Paenibacillus (formerly Bacillus)polymyxa are very well suited to the requirements of directed evolution. This enzyme (henceforth BglA) can be assayed forEscherichia coli colonies grown on Petri dishes, with different chromogenic substrates. Enzymes with novel properties can be screened for using conditions which differentiate the wild-type enzyme from a mutant with a given property (i.e. resistance to thermal denaturation) (2.López-Camacho C. Salgado J. Lequerica J.L. Madarro A. Ballestar E. Franco L. Polaina J. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of BglA is known (3.Sanz-Aparicio J. Hermoso J.A. Martinez-Ripoll M. Lequerica J.L. Polaina J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), which helps investigation of the structural basis of the newly isolated mutations. Protein thermal resistance is an important issue beyond its obvious industrial interest, because the understanding of the basic physicochemical principles necessarily aids the comprehension of other aspects of the structure-function relationship. Recent reports based on experimental data and theoretical considerations point to increased number of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges as the two main factors contributing to thermal stability (4.Vogt G.

Other factors are also important such as increased internal hydrophobicity, minimization of the surface/volume ratio, fewer internal cavities, stabilization of the secondary structure elements, and minimization of loops (6.Goldman A. Structure. 1995; 3: 1277-1279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 11.Querol E. Perez-Pons J.A. Mozo-Villarias A.

This paper describes the continuation of previous work in which we isolated and characterized thermoresistant forms of BglA, obtained after random chemical mutagenesis (2.López-Camacho C. Salgado J. Lequerica J.L. Madarro A. Ballestar E. Franco L. Polaina J. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 13.Sanz-Aparicio J. Hermoso J.A. Martinez-Ripoll M. González B. López-Camacho C. Polaina J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1998; 33: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We now report the use of an alternative, PCR1-based random mutagenesis procedure to obtain new mutants. These novel mutant forms of BglA have been combined, by a directed evolution strategy, to produce a highly stable thermoresistant β-glucosidase. Conditions for maintenance and expression of the bglA gene from P. polymyxa in E. coli have been described previously (2.López-Camacho C. Salgado J. Lequerica J.L. Madarro A. Ballestar E. Franco L. Polaina J. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The cloning vector used was ΔpUC18. This plasmid was obtained from pUC18 (14.Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (11465) Google Scholar) by deletion of a 575-base pair fragment corresponding to the lacZ gene. The use of the modified vector was convenient to avoid the detection of artifactual β-glycosidase activity when 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-glucoside (X-Gal) was used as a substrate. Random mutagenesis of the bglA gene was carried out by error-prone PCR amplification (15.Liao X. Wise J.A. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 88: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 16.Fromant M. Blanquet S. Plateau P. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 32: 347-353Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The template DNA for the mutagenic amplification was plasmid pLGBGA (2.López-Camacho C. Salgado J. Lequerica J.L. Madarro A. Ballestar E. Franco L. Polaina J. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which contains the bglA gene cloned in the pUC18 vector. Direct and reverse pUC universal primers were used for the amplification. Four parallel reactions were carried out for each mutagenic experiment. Each one of these four reactions contained an excess of a particular dNTP (0.5 mm) respective to the other dNTPs (0.2 mm). The reaction mixtures were subjected to 25 cycles of amplification with Biotaq DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The amplified material was digested with EcoRI and HindIII and ligated into the ΔpUC18 vector. The ligation mixtures were used to transform E. coli DH5α selecting for ampicillin-resistant colonies. The transformant colonies were screened for thermoresistant β-glucosidase activity (17.López-Camacho C. Polaina J. Mutat. Res. 1993; 301: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by the procedure of Mikaelian and Sergeant (18.Mikaelian I. Sergeant A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 376Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Purification of wild-type and mutant bglA-encoded β-glucosidase activities from E. coli cultures was carried out as described previously (2.López-Camacho C. Salgado J. Lequerica J.L. Madarro A. Ballestar E. Franco L. Polaina J. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of β-glucosidases was performed with polyclonal antibodies raised against pure BglA, (Gramsch Laboratories, Schwabhaussen, Germany). Immunolabeled protein bands were coupled with anti-rabbit IgG-alkaline phosphatase and visualized by treatment with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The structural models of the different mutations were constructed on the basis of the reported crystal structure of native β-glucosidase A (3.Sanz-Aparicio J. Hermoso J.A. Martinez-Ripoll M. Lequerica J.L. Polaina J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), with Protein Data Base code1BGA. Amino acid sequence changes were incorporated using the graphics program O (19.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) running on a Silicon Graphics workstation. Side chain conformation was chosen from the data base of more common conformers (20.Ponder J.W. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 775-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar) and adjusted manually. The open reading frame of the bglA gene ofP. polymyxa was amplified by PCR under conditions devised to introduce about 3–10 nucleotide changes per kilobase. The amplified material was ligated into ΔpUC18 and used to transform E. coli DH5α selecting for AmpR colonies. The transformants were screened for β-glucosidase activity, after incubation at a temperature that caused inactivation of the wild-type enzyme. Plasmid was extracted from positive clones (presumptively expressing thermoresistant BglA), and the mutations responsible for the observed phenotype were mapped within suitable restriction fragments and identified by DNA sequencing. Table Ilists the mutations thus characterized and the corresponding amino acid substitutions. The repeated recovery of the same mutations in independent mutagenesis experiments indicated that we had obtained all thermoresistant mutations that could be recovered by this procedure. Two of the mutations GAG → AAG (E96K) and ATG → ATA (M416I) (where boldface letters indicate the mutated base) had been previously isolated by chemical mutagenesis (2.López-Camacho C. Salgado J. Lequerica J.L. Madarro A. Ballestar E. Franco L. Polaina J. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The other four were characterized for the first time. The PCR mutagenesis allowed the recovery of two transversions, AAT → AAA (N437K) and AAT →CAT (N437H). This type of mutation is very rarely produced by conventional procedures of chemical mutagenesis. Since the three-dimensional structure of BglA is available (3.Sanz-Aparicio J. Hermoso J.A. Martinez-Ripoll M. Lequerica J.L. Polaina J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), it was possible to map the mutations to their specific spatial location and to the element of secondary structure to which they are associated (TableI).Table IRandomly generated mutations leading to enhanced stability of BglAAmino acid substitutionBase change (codon)Secondary structure at positionLocationIndependent isolationsE96KGAG →AAGHelixSurface3T385AACA → GCAHelixNear surface3N411SAAT → AGTLoopSurface1M416IATG → ATALoopBuried1N437KAAT → AAAHelixNear surface2N437HAAT → CATHelixNear surface1 Open table in a new tab Fig. 1 shows plots of thermal inactivation at 50 °C for wild-type BglA and the six isolated mutants. One of these (T385A) did not show any increase of thermal resistance compared with the wild-type enzyme. The outstanding property of this mutant, which explained why it was isolated in the screening for thermoresistant enzymes, was a large increase of β-glucosidase content in the E. coli host. BglA belongs to the well characterized family 1 glycosyl hydrolases (21.Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2624) Google Scholar, 22.Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 695-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). This family includes enzymes from thermophylic microorganisms. The three-dimensional structure of BglA and other enzymes of the family are known, including one from the thermophylic archaea Sulfolobus solfataricus (3.Sanz-Aparicio J. Hermoso J.A. Martinez-Ripoll M. Lequerica J.L. Polaina J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 24.Aguilar C.F. Sanderson I. Moracci M. Ciaramella M. Nucci R. Rossi M. Pearl L.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 789-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). As an alternative approach to random mutagenesis, we tried to improve the thermoresistance of BglA by rational design. By using an alignment of sequences, we identified amino acids present in BglA and homologous enzymes from mesophilic species but absent in homologous sequences from thermophyles. Among these, we planned substitutions that could have a beneficial effect on thermoresistance. For instance, oxidation of Cys and Met or deamination of Asn and Gln cause enzyme denaturation, and the replacement of these residues can give rise to a more resistant enzyme. Based on these considerations we tested the effect of several amino acid substitutions: N52D, C117W, Q145E, Q256K, M290F, R331E, and M375V. None of them had any appreciable effect on the thermoresistance of the enzyme. Crude extracts of E. coli DH5α cultures expressing the P. polymyxa bglA gene with the T385A mutation showed about 20 times more specific β-glucosidase activity than extracts of the same strain and plasmid, with the wild-type gene. Kinetic parameters of both mutant and wild-type enzymes were the same (TableII). The difference between the two cultures is illustrated in Fig.2 A that shows a Western blot of protein from crude extracts of parallel E. coli cultures expressing either one of the two bglA alleles. The presence of the mutant enzyme in a much higher amount explains why it was isolated in a hunt for thermoresistant enzymes. The T385A substitution was originated by an ACA → GCA replacement. The first codon is relatively infrequent in E. coli (RSCU = 0.10), whereas the second one is much more common (RSCU = 1.09) (25.Sharp P.M. Cowe E. Higgins D.H. Shields D.C. Wolfe K.H. Wright F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 8207-8211Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Therefore, a possible cause for the increase of enzyme content in the mutant would be an improvement of the translation efficiency. To test this, the ACA wild-type codon was changed to the synonymous ACC codon (RSCU = 1.91) by site-directed mutagenesis. This mutation caused a 5–10 times increase of the specific activity that was associated with a corresponding increase of the enzyme content in cell extracts (Fig. 2 B). We also tested the change of the wild-type ACA codon to the infrequent GCC codon (RCSU = 0.18). This double mutation also leads to the T385A substitution. Unexpectedly, specific activity and the amount of enzyme in cell extracts were similar to those observed for the ACA to ACCreplacement (Fig. 2 C). The increased expression of the protein in this mutant cannot therefore be attributed to mutation to a more abundant codon.Table IIKinetic constants of wild-type and mutant β-glucosidasesEnzymeK mK catK cat/K mmms −1s −1 mm −1Wild type0.91314.5T385A1.63220.0E96K0.82228.0E96K/M416I1.22016.5N437K1.02727.0E96K/M416I/N437K1.43525.0E96K/T385A/N411S/M416I/N437K1.32116.0 Open table in a new tab Looking for clues to explain the structural basis of the effect associated to the T385A substitution, we have analyzed the environment of this position. The –R group of Thr385 is oriented toward a cavity situated in the internal space of the protein (Fig.3). A greater stability associated with the T385A replacement would agree with the more hydrophobic nature and the higher volume of the alanine side chain. It is known that refilling of internal cavities with hydrophobic groups protein stability (26.Xu J. Baase W.A. Baldwin E. Matthews B.W. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 158-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). To test this idea, we carried out alternative amino acid replacements at positions: T385L, T385I, and T385F. All three replacements led to a similar increase of specific activity (5–10 times over that of the wild type), which was associated with corresponding increase of intracellular enzyme content (Fig. 2). The different amino acid substitutions that had been identified as responsible for the increased thermoresistance of BglA were associated in different combinations, and the effect in the resulting enzymes was determined. Results presented in Table III and Fig.4 show that coupling several point mutations in the same gene caused a remarkable increase in the thermal resistance of the resulting enzyme. However, this effect was associated with a decrease in the specific activity and enzyme content in E. coli. The decrease was most severe in the case of the triple mutant E96K/M416I/N437K with about 5 times lower enzyme content than the wild type. Mutation T385A had the capability to compensate the negative effect caused by the combination of thermoresistant mutations. The enzyme carrying the E96K/M416I/N437K/T385A combination showed maximal thermal resistance, like the E96K/M416I/N437K triple mutant (Table III), as well as a high intracellular enzyme level, comparable with that of the T385A single mutant (Fig. 2 A).Table IIItm at different temperatures of wild-type and mutant β-glucosidasesMutationst m50 °C60 °C65 °CminNone (WT)200E96K620T385A200N411S300M416I400N437K3030N437H1530E96K/M416I1030E96K/M416I/N437K>90255E96K/M416I/N437K/T385A>90255E96K/M416I/N437K/T385A/N411S>90>9012t m is the incubation time of the enzyme at a given temperature which results in a 50% irreversible thermal inactivation. Open table in a new tab t m is the incubation time of the enzyme at a given temperature which results in a 50% irreversible thermal inactivation. The crystal structure of BglA is known (3.Sanz-Aparicio J. Hermoso J.A. Martinez-Ripoll M. Lequerica J.L. Polaina J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The monomer displays the (α/β)8barrel topology characteristic of family 1 glycosyl hydrolases, with the active center placed in a wide cavity defined along the axis of the barrel. The native enzyme has an octameric quaternary structure, which can be described as a tetramer of dimers with 4-fold symmetry. The two active sites of each dimer face each other separated by the equator of the structure. Fig. 5 A shows the secondary structure elements of the subunits and five of the isolated mutations with respect to the overall folding. The structural basis of the effect caused by the E96K mutation (Fig. 5 B) has been characterized (13.Sanz-Aparicio J. Hermoso J.A. Martinez-Ripoll M. González B. López-Camacho C. Polaina J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1998; 33: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Glu96 is located at the N terminus of helix 2 of the barrel, and its replacement by Lys allows the formation of an ion pair with Asp28, situated in one of the loops surrounding the active center. The ion pair links segments that are 68 amino acids apart in the sequence. Asn411 is part of a loop on the surface of the monomer, near the active center cavity. Its side chain is only hydrogen-bonded to water molecules and is fully accessible to the solvent. The analysis of the amino acid composition of thermophilic proteins reveals a tendency toward a low content of certain “thermolabile” residues such as Asn, Gln, Cys, or Met (11.Querol E. Perez-Pons J.A. Mozo-Villarias A. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 12.Vieille C. Zeikus J.G. Trends Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 183-189Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 27.Daniel R.M. Dines M. Petach H.H. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The substitution of Asn by Ser, also a polar residue, does not disturb the chemical environment of the loop and avoids the vulnerability of the Asn side chain. The Met416 residue is in a loop, totally buried in a hydrophobic cavity (Fig. 5 C), and makes contacts to Leu71, Met357, and the aromatic rings of Tyr432 and Tyr435. Its substitution by Ile should favor thermostability because of the improved packing efficiency conferred by the isoleucine side chain. Interestingly, Met416 is a unique feature of BglA, since other family 1 enzymes have Ile, Val, or Phe at this position. Single mutations of the Asn437 residue are those with a greatest effect in thermoresistance (Table III). Asn437 is located at the end of the last helix before the C terminus of the chain (Fig. 5, A and D). This helix is close to the loop His40-Asn50 of a neighboring subunit, but the side chain of Asn437 is not hydrogen-bound to this loop. The replacement of asparagine by histidine in the interfacial surface allows the formation of an intermolecular ion pair to the Asp49 side chain. This might help in preventing protein inactivation by subunit dissociation, as it often occurs in oligomeric proteins. Furthermore, the longer side chain of lysine enables a bifurcated salt bridge from the terminal amine moiety of lysine to both Asp49 and Asn47 of the other subunit, thus introducing a stronger intermolecular interaction between subunits. This is consistent with the improved thermoresistance of the N437K as compared with N437H mutant. Advances in protein chemistry and the resolution of an elevated number of three-dimensional structures of thermoresistant enzymes have revealed determinant factors of this property. It should be possible, at least in theory, to increase the thermal resistance of an enzyme by a planned modification of its primary structure. Nevertheless, this is a difficult approach that has only been successfully accomplished in a few cases (28.Van den Burg B. Vriend G. Veltman O.R. Venema G. Eijsink G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2056-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 29.Burlacu-Miron S. Perrier V. Gilles A.M. Pistotnik E. Craescu C.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 19982-19987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this work we have used an alternative way, the isolation and characterization of randomly generated mutations and their combination, to achieve a substantial increment of the thermoresistance of the enzyme. This requires an effective method to generate a wide range of random mutations and a procedure for their identification. The error-prone PCR mutagenesis proved to be useful, allowing us to expand the range of mutations of the bglAgene previously obtained by chemical mutagenesis (2.López-Camacho C. Salgado J. Lequerica J.L. Madarro A. Ballestar E. Franco L. Polaina J. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). One of the mutations isolated in the screening for thermoresistant enzyme variants conferred unexpected properties. Thermal resistance and kinetic parameters of the enzyme with the T385A replacement were the same as those of the wild type. The only significant difference was that the enzyme was present in the cell in a much higher amount. Our results indicate that the main cause of this effect is the amino acid replacement and not other factors such as codon change. The high content of the T385A enzyme in the cell led to a substantial level of residual activity, after the incubation at high temperature used in the screening for thermoresistant activity, and explains why this mutant was isolated. Proteins have a certain degree of instability as a physiological requirement to allow turnover. An accumulation of enzyme will result from any mutation that would displace the conformational equilibrium toward a state less prone to be degraded by the proteolytic machinery. The properties of the T385A mutation suggest that it increase the “physiological stability” of the enzyme. Not all the structural modifications of an enzyme that may improve a desired characteristic (i.e. higher temperature resistance) are expected to suit physiological conditions. This fact is illustrated by some of the mutants studied here. The combination of E96K, M416I, and N437K led to a highly thermoresistant enzyme, but it was produced by E. coli in much lower amount than the wild type. This effect can be envisaged as the opposite of that caused by the T385A substitution. Regardless of the astounding impression caused by the existence of living organisms thriving at the temperature of boiling water, the structural difference between homologous proteins that have optimal performances at very different temperatures may be rather trivial. Several reports in the literature have shown that the change of a few amino acids was sufficient to achieve important changes in thermostability (28.Van den Burg B. Vriend G. Veltman O.R. Venema G. Eijsink G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2056-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 30.Kawamura S. Abe Y. Ueda T. Masumoto K. Imoto T. Yamasaki N. Kimura M. J. Biol.

Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In other instances, the comparative analysis of three-dimensional structure of highly thermoresistant proteins and their mesophilic homologs led to the identification of a few key residues responsible for the difference (8.Korndöfer I. Steipe B. Huber R. Tomschy A. Jaenicke R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 32.Lebbink J.H.G. Knapp S. van der Oost J. Rice D. Ladenstein R. de Vos W.M. J.

Biol. 1997; 270: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The conformation of proteins is maintained by a large number of weak interactions. The net free energy of stabilization of a protein (that is the difference between the stabilizing and destabilizing forces) is relatively small. The additional stabilizing energy required to achieve the properties of highly stable proteins is the same order, equivalent to only a few weak interactions (27.Daniel R.M. Dines M. Petach H.H. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is conceivable that the combination of just a few mutations may lead to the recovery of a thermoresistant enzyme. Our results agree with these observations. We have isolated a few thermoresistant mutations and found the structural basis of their effect. The combination of only four of these mutations caused a remarkable increase of the thermal resistance of BglA: from no detectable activity at 55 °C to a half-life time of 12 min at 65 °C. This suggests a cooperative rather than additive effect of the mutations, although a precise definition of their interactions will require spectroscopic or calorimetric assessment of the protein stability.

Transient expression of PLD1 or PLD2 in COS-7 cells revealed that only PLD1 was stimulated by PMA (13.Colley W.C. Sung T.C. Roll R. Jenco J. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Therefore, PLD1 is regarded as the isozyme of PLD under PKC regulation. Although PKC activates PLD1 without a phosphorylation process in vitro, phosphorylations at multiple residues of PLD1 occur in cells upon PMA-stimulation (14.Kim Y. Han J.M. Park J.B. Lee S.D.

Serine 2, threonine 147, and serine 561 of PLD1 have been determined as the sites being directly phosphorylated by PKC (14.Kim Y. Han J.M. Park J.B. Lee S.D. Oh Y.S. Chung C. Lee T.G. Kim J.H.

Mutations of each of these phosphorylation sites revealed that the phosphorylation at these sites was required for the activation of PLD1 transiently expressed in COS-7 cells (14.Kim Y. Han J.M.

PLD is a membrane-associated enzyme, and its product, PA, which is a functionally important product, is a lipid. Therefore, learning more about the localization of the enzyme and its product PA is important to the understanding of its function. PLD activities have been reported for diverse subcellular organelles including plasma membrane, Golgi vesicles, endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles, and the nuclear membrane (15.Balboa M.A. Balsinde J.

There are consequently the following questions to be answered: which isozyme of PLD localizes to a certain organelle, how is the isozyme differentially regulated, and what is its role? The ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF), which is a key regulatory molecule in membrane traffic, was identified as an activator of PLD1 (9.Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Sung T.-C. Rudge S.A. Rose K.

However, more intense investigations are required to reveal details of molecular mechanism of regulation and the roles of any particular PLD isozyme in each subcellular location. Here we report the results of our study of the location of the PLD1 phosphorylation process using immunocytochemical methods as well as biochemical fractionation. For the first time, we show experimental evidence for the specific location of PLD1 phosphorylation and the phosphorylation-dependent activation of PLD1 executed directly by PKC.

Anti-Grp 78 (BiP) polyclonal antibody was from StressGen Biotechnologies Corp. (Collegeville, PA). Phosphopeptides were synthesized by Bio-Synthesis (Lewisville, TX). COS-7 cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated bovine calf serum. S2A, T147A, and S561A mutants had been prepared as described previously (14.Kim Y. Han J.M. Park J.B. Lee S.D. Oh Y.S. Chung C. Lee T.G. Kim J.H. Park S.K. Yoo J.S. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10344-10351Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The S2A/T147A/S561A triple mutant was constructed utilizing the single point mutants. Briefly, the ScaI fragment of S2A, theEcoRI fragment of T147A, and the EcoRV fragment of S561A were subcloned into the corresponding sites of pCDNA3.1-wild type rat PLD1b, which had been identified as a shorter splice variant of PLD1a, lacking 38 amino acids while retaining properties similar to PLD1a (10.Hammond S.M.

Transfection of wild type and mutant rat PLD1b was done with LipofectAMINE following the manufacturer's instructions. CEM fractions were prepared as described previously (24.Kim J.H. Han J.M.

In brief, 2.5 × 106 COS-7 cells/100-mm dish were transfected with 5 μg of pCDNA3.1 expression vector containing rPLD1b cDNA. 24 h after transfection, the cells were starved for 24 h. 48 h after transfection, the cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and then treated with PMA for 15 min. The COS-7 cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 2 ml of 500 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11.0. The cell suspension was homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer and Polytron tissue grinder and subjected to sonication. The homogenate was adjusted to 40% sucrose by addition of 80% sucrose prepared in MBS buffer (25 mm MES-NaOH (pH 6.5), 150 mm NaCl) and placed in the bottom of a tube. 4 ml of 30% and then 4 ml of 5% sucrose in MBS buffer were layered on top, and the sample was centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 6 h in an SW41 rotor (Beckman Instruments). 1-ml fractions were collected from the top, yielding a total of 12 fractions. Sterol-M-β-CD complexes were prepared as described by Pike et al. (25.Pike L.J. Miller J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22298-22304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Briefly, 6 mg of sterol was dissolved in 80 μl of isopropyl alcohol:chloroform (2:1). M-β-CD (200 mg) was dissolved in 2.2 ml of water and heated to 80 °C with stirring in a water bath. The sterol was then added in small aliquots and the solution stirred until clear. This solution now contained 6.8 mm sterol. A PLD1 phosphopeptide including threonine 147 (TKRHpTFRRQN, corresponding to rat PLD1 residues 143–152) was coupled to carrier protein keyhole limpet hemocyanin with glutaraldehyde. Hybridoma monoclones producing anti-phospho-PLD1 antibody were obtained by fusion of Sp2/O-Ag14 mouse myeloma cells with spleen cells derived from BALB/c mice immunized with the peptide-hemocyanin conjugate. Standard fusion, screening, and cloning procedures were followed (26.Hallow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 139-242Google Scholar). Recombinant (His)6-PLD1b and PKCα were expressed in baculovirus infected Sf9 cells and purified as described previously (14.Kim Y. Han J.M. Park J.B. Lee S.D. Oh Y.S. Chung C. Lee T.G. Kim J.H. Park S.K. Yoo J.S. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10344-10351Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The purified PLD1b was phosphorylated by PKCα as described before (14.Kim Y. Han J.M. Park J.B. Lee S.D. Oh Y.S. Chung C. Lee T.G. Kim J.H. Park S.K. Yoo J.S. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10344-10351Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was done as described previously (27.Kim Y. Kim J.E. Lee S.D. Lee T.G. Kim J.H. Park J.B. Han J.M. Jang S.K. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1436: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 1% sodium cholate) containing protease inhibitors (0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin) and phosphatase inhibitors (30 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 30 mmNa4O7P2). After centrifugation (12,000 × g for 15 min), equal amounts of soluble extract were incubated with 2 μg of anti-C-terminal PLD1 antibody and 25 μl of resin volume of immobilized protein A. The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated in 6% SDS-polyacrylamide standard gels (20 × 20 cm) according to Laemmli (28.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting and analysis was done as described previously (27.Kim Y. Kim J.E. Lee S.D. Lee T.G. Kim J.H. Park J.B. Han J.M. Jang S.K. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1436: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Culture supernatant of hybridoma cells secreting anti-phospho-PLD1, 0.4 μg/ml anti-C-terminal PLD1 antibody, anti-PKCα polyclonal antibody (1:10,000), anti-caveolin antibody (1:2000), or anti-Grp 78 (1:100) were used as primary antibodies. COS-7 cells were grown on coverslips, and GFP, GFP-PLD1b, or PLD1b were expressed as described previously (27.Kim Y. Kim J.E. Lee S.D. Lee T.G. Kim J.H. Park J.B. Han J.M. Jang S.K. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1436: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). After stimulation with 100 nm PMA, the cells were fixed in 3.7% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were then washed with PBS and incubated in blocking buffer (1% goat serum in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100) at 4 °C for 1 h. Subsequently the cells were incubated with culture supernatant of hybridoma cells secreting anti-phospho-PLD1 or 2 μg/ml anti-C-terminal PLD1 antibody overnight at 4 °C. After three washes with PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100 (10 min each), the cells were incubated with secondary antibodies: rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse antibody or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody. After washing three times with PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100, the slides were mounted and examined by a fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Inc., Melville, NY). Previously we had studied the PKC-dependent regulatory mechanism of PLD1. Treatment with PMA, an activator of PKC, resulted in phosphorylation at multiple residues of PLD1. Among them, serine 2, threonine 147, and serine 561 were identified as direct phosphorylation sites by PKC (14.Kim Y. Han J.M. Park J.B. Lee S.D. Oh Y.S. Chung C. Lee T.G. Kim J.H. Park S.K. Yoo J.S. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10344-10351Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Single mutations of each of those sites partially attenuated PMA-induced PLD1 activity (14.Kim Y. Han J.M. Park J.B. Lee S.D. Oh Y.S. Chung C. Lee T.G. Kim J.H. Park S.K. Yoo J.S. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10344-10351Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We now constructed a triple mutant (S2A/T147A/S561A) of those phosphorylation sites and investigated the PMA-induced PLD1 activity. Under similar expression conditions (compare transfection with 1 μg of wild type DNA and with 0.2 μg of triple mutant DNA in Fig. 1 B), only a negligible amount of activity was seen for the triple mutant as compared with wild type PLD1 (Fig. 1). This suggests that phosphorylation by PKC is a major activation mechanism for PMA-dependent PLD1 activity. However, more expression of the triple mutant protein (more than 2-fold) raised the activity to about half that of wild type (Fig. 1). Other unidentified PKC phosphorylation site on PLD1 or indirect involvement of PKC may contribute to the residual activity by the triple mutant. Phosphorylation of some proteins can result in changes in the proteins mobility (band shift) in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Because PLD1 is phosphorylated on multiple residues, we examined band shifting of PLD1 after PMA stimulation. After transfection of PLD1 into COS-7 cells, the immunoblot analysis of the expressed proteins showed smeared but distinctly several bands of PLD1. To better analyze these multiple bands, we separated the PLD1 bands in a long 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. In the lysates of resting cells, we observed two major bands of PLD1 (Fig.2 A). When we incubated the cells with inorganic 32P and immunoprecipitated the PLD1, only the upper band was labeled with 32P (data not shown). This indicates that phosphorylation of PLD1 occurs also under resting condition. Treatment of the cells with PMA caused band shifts indicating changes in the mobility of PLD1 in SDS-PAGE. More than two shifted bands in the middle of the region between the two basal bands appeared (Fig. 2 A). The triple phosphorylation mutant showed a reduced upper band and increased lower band under both resting and stimulated conditions, indicating that some of those shifted bands of wild type PLD1 were generated by PKC phosphorylation. All of the smeared upper bands of immunoprecipitated PLD1 could be abolished by the treatment of the immunoprecipitate with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which is one of the major types of protein serine/threonine phosphatase (Fig. 2 B). This suggested that the band shifts were caused by phosphorylation of PLD1 at multiple sites of serine or threonine. The band shifts of PLD1 involve complex phosphorylations mediated by other kinases as well as PKC. Therefore, band shifts alone are inadequate markers of PLD1 phosphorylation by PKC. To generate specific antibodies against the PKC phosphorylation site of PLD1, we raised antibodies against three phosphopeptides, which each included either serine 2, threonine 147, or serine 561. From among these peptides, we successfully got a monoclonal antibody (phospho-PLD1 antibody) only against the peptide phosphorylated at threonine 147. This phospho-PLD1 antibody recognized specifically PKCα-phosphorylated PLD1 in vitro, while it did not react with unphosphorylated PLD1 (Fig.3 A). The antibody also recognized in vivo phosphorylated PLD1, which was induced by treatment with PMA (Fig. 3 B). A smear and two distinct bands were recognized by the phospho-PLD1 antibody only after treatment with PMA, suggesting that the PKC-phosphorylated PLD1 existed in multiple states of phosphorylation. Previously PLD1 was thought to exist at multiple subcellular locations including the plasma membrane and vesicular structures such as endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, endosome, secretory vesicles, and/or lysosomes (13.Colley W.C.

Acta. 1999; 1436: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We tried to pinpoint the subcellular location where PLD1 was activated by PKCα. We have shown earlier that some portion of expressed PLD1 existed in the plasma membrane and in particular in the caveolin-enriched low density membranes to which PKCα translocated after stimulation with PMA (24.Kim J.H. Han J.M. Lee S.D. Kim Y. Lee T.G. Park J.B. Lee S.D. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3763-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 27.Kim Y. Kim J.E. Lee S.D. Lee T.G. Kim J.H. Park J.B. Han J.M. Jang S.K. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1436: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, direct phosphorylation of PLD1 by PKC is a critical step in PMA-induced PLD1 activation. We next transiently expressed PLD1 in COS-7 cells, resolved the CEM fraction, and checked the location of PLD1 phosphorylation. Caveolin was highly enriched in the CEM fraction, and the endoplasmic reticulum chaperon protein (BiP) was excluded from CEM fraction, indicating good preparation. Although PLD1 is present in both CEM and non-CEM, phosphorylation of PLD1 by PKC was detectable only in the CEM fraction to which PKCα translocated (Fig.4 A). When we resolved the proteins of the CEM fraction and those of a representative sample of the non-CEM fractions (pooling fractions from 8 to 12), band shifts also occurred only in the CEM fraction (Fig. 4 B). These results indicated that the direct phosphorylation of PLD1 by PKC occurred in the CEM portion. The CEM fraction is composed of membrane domains that are enriched in cholesterol and glycosphingolipid content (29.Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2610) Google Scholar, 30.Fiedler K. Kobayashi T. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6365-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Cholesterol depletion of the CEM fraction leads to a loss of compartmentalization of caveolin and other signal-related molecules in the low density fractions (25.Pike L.J. Miller J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22298-22304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined what effect cholesterol depletion would have on the compartmentalization of phosphorylated PLD1. M-β-CD is a cholesterol-binding agent that removes cholesterol from intact cells (25.Pike L.J. Miller J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22298-22304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments, 5 mm M-β-CD had no effect on the compartmentalization of caveolin for up to 90 min (data not shown). However, when we treated COS-7 cells with 5 mmM-β-CD for 2 h, more than half of the caveolin moved to the non-CEM fractions (Fig. 5). The treatment for 2 h was not toxic to the cells, as determined by trypan blue exclusion (data not shown). Under the same conditions, the amount of PLD1 and translocated PKCα was also reduced in the CEM fraction and was quantitatively recovered in non-CEM fractions. While phosphorylated PLD1 was reasonably reduced in the CEM fraction, it was, surprisingly, increased in non-CEM fractions. Whereas M-β-CD can remove cholesterol from cell membranes, the soluble complex of cholesterol and M-β-CD can mediate the incorporation of cholesterol into membranes. Treatment of cells with the cholesterol complex reversed the cyclodextrin-induced loss of compartmentalization of PLD1, phosphorylated PLD1, and translocated PKCα (Fig. 5).

The results show that myogenic inhibition in 10T1/2-MRF4 cells, by both bFGF and TGF-β, requires activation of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase/MAP kinase-ERK kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, and resultant FIK up-regulation. We show that FIK is instrumental in MEK-dependent suppression of acetylcholine receptor channel expression but that MEK activation and FIK up-regulation are not essential to suppression of myosin heavy chain and myotube formation. These data indicate that Ras/MEK/ERK induction of FIK is pivotal to regulation of certain myogenic events by both receptor tyrosine kinases and TGF-β receptor, and this is also the first demonstration of chronic FIK up-regulation by the TGF-β receptor family. Furthermore, the results define the physiologic signaling requirements for growth factor-stimulated FIK up-regulation, whereas previous work has concentrated on constitutive FIK up-regulation in cells stably transfected with oncoprotein signaling molecules. This study, together with earlier work showing that FIK positively regulates cell proliferation, establishes this member of the IK channel family as a multifunctional, growth factor-regulated signaling molecule.

These cells overexpress the muscle-specific regulatory transcription factor MRF4,1 which is activated upon growth factor withdrawal to produce a terminal muscle phenotype (3.Rhodes S.J. Konieczny S.F. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2050-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). One growth factor in particular, bFGF, is a potent inhibitor of MRF4-mediated myogenesis, although the exact signaling requirements for this action have not been elucidated. We have shown that another significant physiological action of bFGF in 10T1/2-MRF4 cells is to stimulate the expression of an intermediate conductance calcium-activated potassium channel, FIK. FIK in turn modulates and specifically controls proliferation and differentiation in this and other cell types (4.Peña T.L. Rane S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21909-21916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 5.Peña T.L. Rane S.G. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 172: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus FIK may be a critical component of growth factor signaling pathways that regulate proliferation and differentiation in skeletal muscle myoblasts. The signaling requirements for growth factor-stimulated FIK up-regulation are also not known, although FIK is constitutively up-regulated in response to Ras or Raf oncoprotein expression (6.Huang Y. Rane S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31183-31189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), strongly hinting at a role for the Ras/MEK/ERK system in growth factor modulation of FIK. bFGF signaling via Ras has also been proposed to suppress myogenesis (7.Kong Y. Johnson S.E. Taparowsky E.J. Konieczny S.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5205-5213Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 8.Olson E.N. Spizz G. Tainsky M.A. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1997; 17: 3547-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar); therefore, these two lines of work suggest that growth factor-stimulated FIK up-regulation depends on Ras/MEK/ERK activation and that Ras/MEK/ERK-dependent up-regulation of FIK is a general mechanism for myogenic suppression by receptor tyrosine kinase ligands typified by bFGF. Like bFGF, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is known to activate multiple signaling paths including the Ras/MEK/ERK and p38 MAP kinase pathways, and it regulates a multitude of cell biological functions (10.Florini J.R.

TGF-β also acts as a potent inhibitor of myoblast differentiation in the BC3H1, C2C12, and L6 myoblast cell lines (10.Florini J.R. Roberts A.B. Ewton D.Z. Falen S.L. Flanders K.C. Sporn M.B. J. Biol.

We asked if MEK-dependent up-regulation of FIK could also explain TGF-β-mediated myogenic inhibition in 10T1/2-MRF4 cells. A positive result would further validate a general role for Ras/MEK/ERK-dependent up-regulation of FIK in growth factor-mediated myogenic suppression. In addition, the results would broaden our understanding of which receptor families and which signaling events can regulate the IK channel family. Experiments were performed using C3H10T1/2 cells constitutively overexpressing a rat MRF4 cDNA (3.Rhodes S.J. Konieczny S.F. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2050-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). 10T1/2-MRF4 cultures were grown on gelatin-coated dishes as undifferentiated myoblasts in serum-replete medium (basal medium Eagle, 15% fetal bovine serum), or they were differentiated via serum withdrawal as described previously (4.Peña T.L. Rane S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21909-21916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For electrophysiology cells were seeded onto 35-mm dishes and grown to confluence in serum-replete medium and then switched to low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 2% horse serum (HS). Growth factors, bFGF, or epidermal growth factor (EGF) (20 ng/ml), TGF-β (5 ng/ml), the FIK blocker charybdotoxin (ChTX), or the p38, or MEK inhibitors SB202190 (10 μm) or PD98059 (25 μm) were then added as noted. For proliferation experiments cells were seeded at 5 × 104/well (24-well plates) in low glucose DMEM supplemented with 2% HS for 5 h. This was followed by addition of the appropriate growth factor with or without PD98059 to the media. Cells were treated and counted daily using a hemocytometer, and trypan blue exclusion was used to ensure counts of only viable cells. All cultures were maintained in a humidified, 5% CO2atmosphere at 37 °C. Cells were grown to confluence as described above and switched to low glucose DMEM supplemented with 2% HS and stimulated with bFGF, EGF, or TGF-β (with or without 200 nm ChTX, 25 μm PD98058, or 10 μm SB202190) for 48 h. Cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (in mm: 150 NaCl, 1.9 NaH2PO4:H2O, and 8.1 Na2HPO4), pH 7.3, fixed with a 90% methanol solution and then incubated with the anti-myosin mouse monoclonal antibody MF-20 as described previously (5.Peña T.L. Rane S.G. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 172: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Myosin staining was compared with that of non-treated control cells (2% HS) for which staining was set to a value of 100. All cells were photographed under bright-field at × 100. The standard bath solution used for recording whole-cell FIK channel and acetylcholine (ACh) receptor channel currents contained (in mm) 138 NaCl, 9 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, and 10 HEPES. The patch pipette solution for these recordings contained (in mm) 150 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 0.1 EGTA. A23187 (Sigma), bFGF, EGF, TGF-β (Austral Biologicals), ChTX (BACHEM Bioscience), PD98059 (New England Bio Labs), and SB202190 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) were stored as frozen stocks, and aliquots of each were diluted to final concentrations on the day of use. Acute application of compounds to cells during patch clamp recording was accomplished via pressure ejection of solution from blunt-tipped pipettes. All solutions were at pH 7.3, and electrophysiology and immunocytochemistry experiments were done at room temperature, 22–25 °C. Patch clamp apparatus, techniques, and cell preparation were as described previously (4.Peña T.L. Rane S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21909-21916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 5.Peña T.L. Rane S.G. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 172: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Whole-cell FIK currents were measured during voltage steps to 0 mV (from −70mV) while intracellular calcium levels were increased by extracellular application of A23187 (1 μm). Whole-cell ACh receptor currents were recorded at −70 mV in response to extracellular application of 100 μm ACh. The analog compensation circuitry of the patch clamp amplifier was used to estimate whole-cell capacitances (expressed in picofarads). Whole-cell currents were normalized to cell capacitance, an indirect measure of membrane area, and expressed as mean ± S.E. current densities in picoamperes/picofarads. bFGF up-regulates FIK in 10T1/2-MRF4 cells (4.Peña T.L. Rane S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21909-21916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and increased FIK channel activity stimulates proliferation and suppresses myogenesis. To date, additional growth factor-activated signaling systems that modulate FIK, and thus may regulate muscle cell growth and differentiation, have not been identified. Like bFGF, TGF-β also acts as a potent inhibitor of myogenic differentiation, although it has not been tested on 10T1/2-MRF4 cells. TGF-β activates multiple signaling paths including the Ras/MEK/ERK and p38 signaling cascades, but it is not known which of these downstream pathways contribute to TGF-β-mediated myogenic inhibition. To address these issues we first examined if TGF-β could up-regulate FIK and, if so, by which signaling cascade. This information would then allow us to look at the possible involvement of FIK in TGF-β-induced myogenic suppression. We also looked at FIK and growth regulation in response to EGF, because of the distinctly different actions of this Ras/MEK/ERK activator versus those of bFGF. In 10T1/2-MRF4 and NIH3T3 cells, bFGF up-regulation of FIK persists for the duration of peptide exposure. EGF, however, only transiently up-regulates FIK in 3T3 cells, and it is an inefficient mitogen (6.Huang Y. Rane S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31183-31189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized, therefore, that EGF would also inefficiently stimulate FIK and the proliferative capacity of 10T1/2-MRF4 cells and for these reasons would fail to suppress myogenesis. FIK channel levels were compared for 10T1/2-MRF4 cells stimulated with TGF-β, EGF, or bFGF. Fig. 1 Ashows that 24-h TGF-β up-regulated FIK. Mean FIK current density in TGF-β-treated cells (13.5 ± 1.9 pA/pF, n = 18) was greater than the density observed in non-treated controls (2% HS) (6.8 ± 2.4 pA/pF, n = 12) (4.Peña T.L. Rane S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21909-21916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) but much less than the density in bFGF-stimulated cells (22.9 ± 2.5 pA/pF,n = 10). TGF-β also failed to stimulate 10T1/2-MRF4 cell growth (Fig. 1 B). EGF poorly up-regulated FIK and, as predicted, failed to stimulate growth in 10T1/2-MRF4 cells. Fig.1 A shows that 24-h EGF-treated cells had significantly lower FIK current densities (5.7 ± 2.5 pA/pF, n = 7) than cells stimulated with either bFGF or TGF-β. 48-h EGF exposure gave a FIK density of 4.8 ± 2.3 pA/pF (n = 8). Thus chronic EGF application does not elevate FIK levels beyond those observed in the absence of growth factor treatment. Since bFGF and TGF-β activate both Ras/MEK/ERK and p38 MAP kinase signaling pathways, we next asked if these pathways are also involved in growth factor up-regulation of FIK, as this would also suggest that they contribute to myogenic suppression. FIK current densities were determined for 24-h growth factor-stimulated 10T1/2-MRF4 cells, with or without the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (25 μm) or the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB202190 (10 μm and 25 μm). Fig. 1 A shows that for all growth factor treatments the MEK inhibitor PD98059 significantly decreased or completely inhibited FIK up-regulation (0.0 ± 0.0 pA/pF,n = 10, EGF; 4.8 ± 1.0 pA/pF, n = 8 TGF-β; 2.4 ± 0.8 pA/pF, n = 9, bFGF). FIK current traces from cells stimulated with TGF-β with or without PD98059 also clearly reveal that the MEK inhibitor blocks FIK up-regulation (Fig. 1 C). As predicted, PD98059 also inhibited proliferation of bFGF-stimulated cells, and the measured growth rate was less than in EGF- or TGF-β-stimulated or in non-treated control cells (Fig. 1 B). Interestingly, the p38 inhibitor SB202190 had no effect on FIK currents measured from cells stimulated with either bFGF (23.5 ± 1.7 pA/pF, n= 10, 10 μm or 20.8 ± 4.0 pA/pF, n= 16, 25 μm) or TGF-β (13.0 ± 1.8 pA/pF,n = 14, 10 μm or 9.7 ± 2.5 pA/pF,n = 11, 25 μm), suggesting that FIK up-regulation is not dependent on the p38 pathway. Our previous work showed that expression of oncogenic Ras constitutively up-regulates FIK in a Raf-dependent manner (6.Huang Y. Rane S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31183-31189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but that work did not directly address a role for MEK nor did it address the basis for FIK up-regulation in the context of growth factor (rather than oncogene)-mediated signaling. We can now conclude that growth factor up-regulation of FIK requires signaling through Ras/MEK/ERK and not p38 MAP kinase. Furthermore, these results suggest that activation of Ras/MEK/ERK is necessary for 10T1/2-MRF4 proliferation. The failure of EGF and TGF-β to stimulate cell growth may reflect less robust activation of this pathway, relative to bFGF-mediated activation, and therefore less FIK channel up-regulation. However, additional anti-proliferative signaling actions of TGF-β cannot be completely ruled out at this time. These results provide the first indication that the TGF-β receptor family up-regulates FIK and that TGF-β or bFGF activation of Ras/MEK/ERK share a common regulatory function, induction of the FIK channel. Having shown that TGF-β up-regulates FIK, we asked if TGF-β also suppresses myogenesis in the 10T1/2-MRF4 system, as it does in other muscle cell lines. To test for myogenic inhibition, 10T1/2-MRF4 cells were switched to differentiating medium (2% HS) with or without TGF-β for 48 h and then assayed for expression of ACh receptor channels and MHC. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings and immunocytochemistry were used to assay for ACh receptor currents and myosin expression, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, only 7% of TGF-β-stimulated cells expressed MHC. Similarly, the ACh receptor channel current density was significantly lower (4.0 ± 2.7 pA/pF,n = 10) in TGF-β-treated cells than compared with control cells (131.7 ± 22.8 pA/pF, n = 25) (Fig.2). These data parallel the results obtained with bFGF-treated cells in which only 3% of the cells express MHC, and a complete absence of ACh receptor channel expression is observed (0.0 ± 0.0 pA/pF,n = 6) (Fig. 3). Additionally, bFGF- or TGF-β-treated cells exhibited no evidence of myotube formation (Figs. 2 and 3), suggesting that both bFGF and TGF-β act as potent myogenic suppressors in 10T1/2-MRF4 cells.Figure 3bFGF and EGF regulation of muscle differentiation in 10T1/2-MRF4 cells. Immunocytochemistry for myosin heavy chain expression in 10T1/2-MRF4 cells grown for 48 h in bFGF with or without PD98059 or SB202190. The column graphs represent cumulative whole-cell ACh current densities from 24-h stimulated cells for the same treatment conditions, combined with the matching ACh raw traces. EGF does not maintain Ras/MEK/ERK signaling and therefore fails to suppress MHC and ACh receptor expression. Inhibition of Ras/MEK/ERK, but not p38 signaling, reverses bFGF suppression of ACh receptor expression.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next asked if blocking FIK channel activity could override myogenic suppression induced by TGF-β and evoke an MRF4-dependent ACh receptor channel and MHC expression pattern. TGF-β suppression of ACh receptor expression was overcome by addition of 200 nmChTX to the growth medium (Fig. 2). The average ACh current density for cells treated with TGF-β plus ChTX (123.8 ± 25.2 pA/pF,n = 18) was significantly greater than the density for cells treated with TGF-β alone (4.0 ± 2.7 pA/pF,n = 10). This value for TGF-β plus ChTX was comparable to the density observed in cells treated 24 h with EGF plus ChTX (171.6 ± 31.5 pA/pF, n = 32) or with bFGF plus ChTX (176.2 ± 49.6 pA/pF, n = 4) (4.Peña T.L. Rane S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21909-21916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Interestingly, TGF-β-stimulated cells treated with ChTX failed to exhibit significant MHC expression (5%) or formation of multinucleate muscle fibers, suggesting that FIK up-regulation suppresses only certain myogenic events. The ability of PD98059 to inhibit bFGF- and TGF-β-stimulated FIK up-regulation and bFGF-stimulated cell growth (Fig. 1, A andB) suggests a role for Ras/MEK/ERK in these processes. In order to test this, we used PD98059 to ask if MEK activation was also essential to growth factor-mediated myogenic inhibition. A positive result would again suggest that bFGF and TGF-β share a common signaling pathway (i.e. Ras/MEK/ERK) to up-regulate FIK and suppress differentiation in 10T1/2-MRF4 cells. Fig. 3 shows that PD98059 treatment of bFGF-stimulated cells reversed bFGF inhibition of ACh receptor channel expression, resulting in a mean ACh current density (142.6 ± 41.7 pA/pF, n = 10) comparable to that of non-treated control cells (131.7 ± 22.8 pA/pF,n = 25). The level of ACh receptor currents also increased with PD98059 treatment of TGF-β-stimulated cells (168.4 ± 55.3 pA/pF, n = 9) (Fig. 2). However, PD98059 treatment of bFGF- or TGF-β-stimulated cells failed to evoke MHC expression (8 and 5%, respectively) or multinucleate muscle fiber formation (Figs. 2 and 3). These data suggest that functional FIK channel expression underlies growth factor inhibition of muscle differentiation, as measured by ACh receptor expression in 10T1/2-MRF4 cells. Furthermore, the effects of ChTX or PD98059 treatment on FIK channel activity are not sufficient to drive complete myogenic differentiation, thus supporting a role for FIK in controlling early (ACh receptor channel expression) rather than late (MHC expression and fiber formation) myogenic events. Thus, these data support the idea that bFGF and TGF-β, through activation of the MEK signaling cascade, regulate FIK activity and thereby alter cell growth (in the case of bFGF) and early myogenic events (summarized in TableI).Table IEffects of growth factor signaling on FIK channel expression, cellular proliferation, and myogenic differentiation in 10T1/2-MRF4 cellsGrowth conditionFIKaFibroblast-type, intermediate conductance potassium channel current density.ProliferationACh-RbAcetylcholine receptor channel current density.Fibers/MHCcMultinucleated myofiber counts/myosin heavy chain immunostaining.2% HS−−++, +bFGF++−−, −bFGF + FIK blockdFIK functional block with charybdotoxin.+−+−, −bFGF + PD98059−−+−, −EGF−−++, +TGF-β+−−−, −TGF-β + FIK block+−+−, −TGF-β + PD90859−−+−, −a Fibroblast-type, intermediate conductance potassium channel current density.b Acetylcholine receptor channel current density.c Multinucleated myofiber counts/myosin heavy chain immunostaining.d FIK functional block with charybdotoxin. Open table in a new tab Since FIK channel activity is necessary for both bFGF- and TGF-β-induced myogenic suppression (Figs. 2 and 3), we hypothesized that the low FIK channel activity in EGF-treated cells would be insufficient to suppress differentiation in 10T1/2-MRF4 cells. Fig. 3confirms that EGF failed to suppress ACh channel expression (115.6 ± 35.1 pA/pF, n = 28). ACh channel expression was further increased to 171.6 ± 35.1 pA/pF, n = 32, by ChTX block of the low levels of EGF-induced FIK. In addition to increased ACh channel current densities, 82% of EGF-treated cells stained positive for MHC and fused into multinucleate myofibers (Fig.3). These results suggest that the failure of EGF to suppress myogenesis results in part from the absence of elevated FIK channel activity. bFGF and TGF-β play critical roles in regulating the onset of myogenic differentiation. The similarities between the myogenic inhibitory actions of these growth factors suggest that they may share a common signaling pathway. This study identifies Ras/MEK/ERK, and excludes p38, as the signaling path for growth factor-mediated myogenic suppression by these growth factors. Moreover, we demonstrate that activation of Ras/MEK/ERK by bFGF or TGF-β produces persistent FIK up-regulation and that this enhanced FIK expression is necessary for myogenic suppression in 10T1/2-MRF4 cells. This connection between FIK up-regulation specifically and myogenic inhibition in general is further strengthened by studying the action of EGF. EGF activation of Ras/MEK/ERK produces only transient FIK up-regulation in 10T1/2-MRF4 (and other fibroblast) cells (6.Huang Y. Rane S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31183-31189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with its poor myogenic suppressive action. We show here that the myogenic inhibitory action of Ras/MEK/ERK-induced FIK up-regulation is restricted to the suppression of only certain muscle-specific genes such as the ACh receptor channel, the expression of which we have shown precedes other myogenic events such as myosin expression and myotube formation (4.Peña T.L. Rane S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21909-21916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The selective inhibition of early versus late myogenic events may indicate a critical role for FIK in the physiological control of myogenesis by bFGF and TGF-β. These results suggest a novel model for the role of Ras/MEK/ERK and FIK in bFGF and TGF-β regulation of myogenesis (Fig.4). Much remains to be learned about the mechanisms involved in bFGF- and TGF-β-regulated myoblast proliferation and differentiation. Although the results of the present study show that bFGF and TGF-β share a common signaling path and evoke the same myogenic inhibitory action, they have contrasting effects on myoblast proliferation. bFGF stimulates myoblast proliferation, and this positive mitogenic effect can be abrogated by either ChTX block of FIK (4.Peña T.L. Rane S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21909-21916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 5.Peña T.L. Rane S.G. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 172: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) or by PD98059 block of Ras/MEK/ERK signaling. Thus, bFGF stimulates proliferation via the same signaling path required for myogenic suppression (Fig. 4). The finding that bFGF-induced FIK up-regulation is required to both stimulate proliferation and suppress myogenesis suggests a dual function of FIK in regulating mitogenic and myogenic events. Thus, it is possible that bFGF suppresses myogenesis by maintaining myoblasts in a proliferative state, thereby inhibiting the expression of muscle-specific genes and the fusion of myoblasts into multinucleate myotubes. We report the first evidence in 10T1/2-MRF4 cells that TGF-β, unlike bFGF, has no mitogenic action. The suppression by TGF-β of myogenic differentiation, coupled with its failure to stimulate proliferation, suggests that TGF-β-induced myogenic suppression does not depend on the ability to drive mitogenesis. These data are in agreement with the action of TGF-β in other muscle cell lines in which myogenic suppression has been shown to be independent of cell proliferation (10.Florini J.R. Roberts A.B. Ewton D.Z. Falen S.L. Flanders K.C. Sporn M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16509-16513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Olson E.N. Sternberg E. Hu J.S. Spizz G. Wilcox C. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1799-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Since bFGF and TGF-β both signal through Ras/MEK/ERK to up-regulate FIK, and this signaling is necessary for suppression of ACh channel expression, we propose that FIK regulates myogenesis independently of its effects on cell proliferation. These data also support the idea that growth factor-mediated FIK expression serves as a general mechanism for suppressing myogenesis. Our studies identify a critical role for FIK in regulating the fundamental cell biological events of proliferation and differentiation. They provide the first evidence for Ras/MEK/ERK-mediated coupling between receptor tyrosine kinase and TGF-β receptor families and FIK in the physiological control of early myogenic events. Additional evidence for the role of Ras/MEK/ERK in myogenesis has been demonstrated in a study by Bennett and Tonks (17.Bennett A.M. Tonks N.K. Science. 1997; 278: 1288-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), in which ERK inactivation was found to be necessary for the removal of growth factor-induced suppression of myogenesis in C2C12 cells. It also has been suggested that activation of additional signaling pathways distinct from Ras/MEK/ERK may be necessary for complete myogenic suppression (9.Ramocki M.B. Johnson S.E. White M.A. Ashendel C.L. Konieczny S.F. Taparowsky E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3547-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The finding that blocking either Ras/MEK/ERK signaling or FIK channel activity only partially relieves bFGF- or TGF-β-induced myogenic suppression supports the idea that additional mechanisms may exist to regulate later myogenic events. FIK, however, clearly mediates the transition between proliferation and differentiation in 10T1/2-MRF4 cells. FIK also positively regulates proliferation in other cells types (18.Leonard R.J. Garcia M.L. Slaughter R.S. Reuben J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10094-10098Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 19.Lewis R.S. Cahalan M.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 623-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may have a corollary inhibitory effect on differentiation in these cells as well as in other tissues in which it is expressed (20.Ishii T.M.

Munc18-2 is a Sec1 homologue enriched in epithelial cells and forms a complex with syntaxin 3, a t-SNARE localized to the apical plasma membrane. We generated here a set of Munc18-2 point mutants with substitutions in conserved amino acid residues. The mutants displayed a spectrum of different syntaxin binding efficiencies. The in vitro andin vivo binding patterns were highly similar, and the association of the Munc18-2 variants with syntaxin 3 correlated well with their ability to displace SNAP-23 from syntaxin 3 complexes when overexpressed in Caco-2 cells. Even the Munc18-2 mutants that do not detectably bind syntaxin 3 were membrane associated in Caco-2 cells, suggesting that the syntaxin interaction is not the sole determinant of Sec1 protein membrane attachment. Overexpression of the wild-type Munc18-2 was shown to inhibit the apical delivery of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA). Interestingly, mutants unable to bind syntaxin 3 behaved differently in the HA transport assay. While one of the mutants tested had no effect, one inhibited and one enhanced the apical transport of HA. This implies that Munc18-2 function in apical membrane trafficking involves aspects independent of the syntaxin 3 interaction.

The SNARE proteins present on the transport vesicles (v-SNAREs; related to the neuronal synaptobrevin/VAMP proteins) and the target membranes (t-SNAREs; homologues of the neuronal syntaxin and SNAP-25 proteins) assemble into stable core complexes through formation of coiled coil helix bundles, a process which is closely connected to the fusion of membrane bilayers (3.Mayer A.

Proteins of the Sec1 family (reviewed in Ref. 6.Halachmi N. Lev Z. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) are suggested to play a crucial role in the control of SNARE complex assembly. These proteins bind with high affinity to specific syntaxins, thus modulating the capability of these t-SNAREs to interact with their cognate SNARE partners.

On the other hand, a wealth of evidence shows that Sec1 action is required for normal physiological function of the intracellular trafficking pathways: loss-of-function mutations in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, andDrosophila melanogaster Sec1-related proteins have been demonstrated to lead to specific blocks in vesicle transport, the phenotypic effects often implying disturbance in consumption of transport vesicles (13.Bryant N.J.

Three mammalian Sec1 homologues are suggested to control specific vesicle transport events at the plasma membrane of different cell types: Munc18/n-Sec1/rbSec1 is a predominantly neuronal protein, which binds the neuronal syntaxins 1A and 1B as well as syntaxins 2 and 3, and is essential for neurotransmission (21.Garcia E.P.

The ubiquitously expressed Munc18c binds to syntaxins 2 and 4, and has been shown to regulate glucose transporter trafficking in adipocytes through modulation of the function of syntaxin 4-based SNARE complexes (11.Tamori Y.

Furthermore, a protein (denoted as PSP) probably representing human Munc18c was suggested to control platelet granule exocytosis (32.Reed G.L. Houng A.K. Fitzgerald M.L. Blood. 1999; 93: 2617-2626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The exact mode of action of the Sec1 proteins is even today unclear, but recent work has provided us with valuable clues to the principles of Sec1 function: Dulubova et al. (33.Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) demonstrated by NMR spectroscopy that syntaxin 1A can adopt two different conformations, one of which (the “closed” conformation) binds Munc18 and appears to be crucial for the exocytic event. The results suggest that syntaxin undergoes a conformational switch from a Munc18-bound closed form to an “open” conformation present in the SNARE core complex. How is Sec1 protein function linked to upstream regulatory signals? There is increasing evidence that one mechanism controlling the Sec1-syntaxin binding is phosphorylation of the Sec1 proteins, which appears to dissociate them from the t-SNARE, thus permitting positive interactions of syntaxin with other components of the vesicle docking/fusion apparatus (32.Reed G.L. Houng A.K. Fitzgerald M.L. Blood. 1999; 93: 2617-2626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Fletcher A.I. Shuang R. Giovannucci D.R. Zhang L. Bittner M.A. Stuenkel E.L. J. Biol.

Furthermore, certain proteins are capable of directly displacing Sec1 homologues from syntaxin: these include the synaptic protein tomosyn (37.Fujita Y. Shirataki H. Sakisaka T. Asakura T. Ohya T.

In addition, the DOC2 proteins binding to Munc18 have capacity to modulate the Munc18-syntaxin interaction (39.Verhage M. de Vries K.J. Roshol H. Burbach J.P. Gispen W.H. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 453-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The yeast Sec1 homologue Vps45p apparently forms a functional link between the small Rab GTPases involved in transport vesicle tethering (40.Waters M.G. Pfeffer S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling, and the SNARE machinery (41.Peterson M.R. Burd C.G. Emr S.D. Curr.

Cell. 1999; 10: 1873-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Furthermore, through interactions with the Mint proteins (43.Okamoto M. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31459-31464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), Munc18 is suggested to be involved in the coupling of vesicle exocytosis to a protein scaffold that organizes specific cell adhesion sites such as the synapse (44.Butz S. Okamoto M. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1998; 94: 773-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, P. Novick and colleagues (45.Carr C.M. Grote E. Munson M. Hughson F.M. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) recently presented data suggesting that, rather than binding to uncomplexed syntaxin, the S. cerevisiae Sec1p preferentially associates with the exocytic SNARE core complex. This indicates that different members of the Sec1 protein family may display different modes of action, or that the role of Sec1 proteins in the intracellular fusion events is more complex than we have previously surmised. The Sec1-syntaxin interactions crucial for membrane trafficking have been mainly addressed through genetic manipulation of syntaxin (23.Pevsner J. Hsu S.C. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar,33.Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). In the present study we mutagenized the epithelially enriched Sec1 homologue Munc18-2 to reveal structural characteristics important for its interaction with syntaxin 3 and displacement of SNAP-23 from syntaxin 3 complexes. Furthermore, the functional effects of wild-type Munc18-2 and selected mutants on apical membrane trafficking in polarized Caco-2 cells were characterized. The results establish the role of Munc18-2 as a controller of membrane trafficking at the apical plasma membrane of epithelial cells. The human colon carcinoma cell line Caco-2 was cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies), 2 mm l-glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For HA transport assay Caco-2 cells were grown on Costar Transwell polycarbonate filters according to Pinto et al. (46.Pinto M. Robine-Leon S. Appay M.D. Kedinger M. Triadou N. Dussaulx E. Lacroix B. Simon-Assman P. Haffen K. Fogh J. Zweibaum A. Biol. Cell. 1983; 47: 323-330Google Scholar). Fresh medium was changed to the filters every day, and the polarized cells were used 7 days after reaching confluency. The rabbit antiserum against Munc18-2 and the affinity purified anti-syntaxin 3 antibody have been characterized (9.Riento K. Galli T. Jansson S. Ehnholm C. Lehtonen E. Olkkonen V.M. J.

The polyclonal antiserum against influenza virus A H1N1 envelope glycoproteins was a gift from Dr. Ilkka Julkunen (National Public Health Institute, Helsinki, Finland). The N-terminalmyc-tagged canine Munc18-2 cDNA in pBluescript SK(−) was mutagenized using the QuickChange™ system (Stratagene). The sequence changes were verified by dideoxy sequencing using the U. S. Biochemical Corp. Sequenase 2.0 kit. 1 μg of glutathioneS-transferase (GST, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or GST-syntaxin 3ΔC (9.Riento K. Galli T. Jansson S. Ehnholm C. Lehtonen E. Olkkonen V.M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2681-2688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in 50 mm sodium carbonate, pH 9.6, were coated on MaxiSorb 96-well plates (Nunc) for 16 h at 4 °C. Unspecific binding was blocked with 0.2% gelatin, 0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). myc-Munc18-2 mutant constructs were in vitro translated in the presence of [35S]methionine using the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The lysates were dialyzed extensively against PBS to remove free label, and the radioactivity in the preparations was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The purity of the labeled in vitrotranslation products and the radioactivity in the specific Munc18-2 bands was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImager quantitation using the Fujifilm BAS-1500 apparatus. Equal amounts of radioactive Munc18-2 or its mutant forms (25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 × 103)cpm/well) were incubated in the coated wells for 30 min at 37 °C. After thorough washes with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS the amount of bound label was quantified with a Wallac MicroBeta counter. To obtain the specific binding, the counts/min values of the GST-coated wells were subtracted from those of the GST-syntaxin 3ΔC coated ones. For verification of specificity of the assay, N-terminal His6-tagged Munc18-2 was produced in Sf9 cells using the Bac to Bac system (Life Technologies Inc.) and purified on Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The purified protein, or bovine serum albumin as a control, were added in increasing amounts to the in vitro translated35S-labeled wild-type Munc18-2 before applying the specimens in the coated wells. After assessing the linearity of signal over the counts/min range studied for all the Munc18-2 variants, the actual measurements were carried out using 150,000 cpm of Munc18-2 radioactivity per well. For expression studies in Caco-2 cells the myc-Munc18-2 mutant cDNAs were transferred as BamHI fragments from pBluescript to pSFV1 (48.Liljeström P. Garoff H. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 1356-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Constructs carrying the human amyloid precursor protein cDNA or the influenza A WSN/33 HA cDNA were gifts from Dr. P. Tienari (Dept. of Neurology, University of Helsinki, Finland) and Dr. P. Gleeson (Dept. of Pathology and Immunology, Monash University Medical School, Australia), respectively. A cDNA encoding the human CLN3 protein was kindly provided by Dr. Irma Järvelä (Dept. of Human Molecular Genetics, National Public Health Institute, Finland). For constructs carrying two inserts under independent 26 S promotors (49.Suomalainen M. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4879-4889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the Munc18-2 inserts together with promotor and partial nsP4 open reading frame sequences were removed from pSFV1 using EagI, the cohesive ends filled-in, andXbaI. These fragments were cloned into pSFV1/influenza HA digested with BglII, followed by fill-in, andXbaI. Recombinant Semliki Forest viruses were prepared in baby hamster kidney cells, and infections were carried out as described (50.Olkkonen V.M. Dupree P. Simons K. Liljeström P. Garoff H. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Prior to infection of Caco-2 cells grown on plastic the cells were treated for 10 min with 5 mm EGTA in PBS at 37 °C (9.Riento K. Galli T. Jansson S. Ehnholm C. Lehtonen E. Olkkonen V.M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2681-2688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Filter grown Caco-2 cells were infected directly from the basal side by placing the filter units on a droplet of virus dilution on Parafilm. After 1 h incubation at 37 °C, the filter units were moved to fresh complete medium. To assess the level of Munc18-2 overexpression, samples of the cells were directly lysed in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and the quantity of Munc18-2 relative to that in cells infected with the control (amyloid precursor protein) SFV was determined by Western blotting, 35S-protein A, and Fujifilm BAS-1500 quantitation. For analysis of Munc18-2 stability, Caco-2 cells grown on plastic were infected with recombinant SFVs for 4 h. Thereafter the cells were pulse labeled with [35S]Met and Cys (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AGQ0080; 30 μCi/3 cm dish) for 30 min using a medium containing 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, and either lysed after PBS washes in the EDTA-containing immunoprecipitation buffer described in Ref. 9.Riento K. Galli T. Jansson S. Ehnholm C. Lehtonen E. Olkkonen V.M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2681-2688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar or chased for 2 h with excess unlabeled Met and Cys. Themyc-Munc18-2 proteins were immunoprecipitated using the 9E10 anti-myc mAb, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, autoradiography, and Fujifilm BAS-1500 quantitation. Caco-2 cells grown on 6-cm plastic dishes were infected with recombinant Semliki Forest viruses for 4 h. After PBS washes the cells were scraped in 250 mm sucrose, 140 mm KCl, 10 mmHepes, pH 7.4, and broken by repeated passages through a 21-gauge needle. After removal of intact cells and nuclei, sucrose was added to 2 m (total volume of 2.5 ml), and overlaid with 2 ml of 1.7 m sucrose and 0.5 ml of 0.8 m sucrose, 140 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes. The gradients were centrifuged at 130,000 × g in a SW50.1 rotor for 17 h, 10 °C. Fractions of 1 ml were collected, proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and the specimens were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Munc18-2, anti-syntaxin 3, or anti-gelsolin. Filter-grown Caco-2 cells were infected with recombinant SFVs expressing both HA and a Munc18-2 variant (or in the control virus the CLN3 protein) for 5 h, labeled with [35S]Met and Cys (70 μCi/12-mm filter) for 2 h in a medium containing 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, followed by a 2-h chase. For surface immunoprecipitation of HA the cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS with 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2 (PBS+) and placed on ice. The cells were incubated with anti-H1N1 antibody diluted in serum-free culture medium on either the apical or the basolateral side of the filter at 4 °C for 1 h. Unbound antibody was removed by washes with cold 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS+, and PBS+. The cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 25 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin A, on ice. After removal of insoluble material in a microcentrifuge, Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added in the lysates (incubation overnight at +4 °C). For total HA immunoprecipitation, anti-H1N1 antibody and Protein A-Sepharose were directly added in lysates of pulsed and chased cells. The bound proteins were, after thorough washes of the matrix with the lysis buffer, detached by boiling in reducing Laemmli sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and quantified by the Fujifilm BAS-1500 system. In order to gain further insight to the function of Munc18-2, a set of mutants with substitutions in parts conserved in the Sec1 protein family was generated (Fig. 1, TableI). Most of the mutations correspond to ones characterized in functional terms in the literature for other Sec1-related proteins, while others were designed in conserved residues based on sequence alignment and secondary structure prediction without pre-existing functional information. A multiple sequence alignment generated using the GCG Pileup program was used in the mutant design, and the PHD software (Columbia University) was used for protein secondary structure considerations.Table IThe properties of the Munc 18–2 mutants compared to the wt proteinMutantCorresponds toStabilityBinding to Syn3 in vitroBinding to Syn3 in vivoSNAP23 displacementwt Munc 18–2+++a+++ >80%.+++++++++G416EG443E,sec1–1 bNovick et al.

The G416E corresponds to the temperature-sensitive (ts) S. cerevisiae sec1–1 mutation G443E causing post-Golgi secretion arrest at the restrictive temperature (16.Novick P. Field C. Schekman R.

R405P corresponds to the S.c. sec1–11 ts mutation R432P resembling sec1-1 in phenotype (52.Aalto M.K. Ruohonen L. Hosono K. Keränen S. Yeast. 1991; 7: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).2 E467K was designed as a counterpart of theS.c. SLY1-20 mutation E532K described by Dascher et al. (53.Dascher C. Ossig R. Gallwitz D. Schmitt H.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 872-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) as a dominant single copy suppressor of deletion ofYPT1. This identification is, however, not absolutely positive, since the sequences of Sly1p and the other Sec1 family members are markedly divergent in this region (Fig. 1). P242S and H293Y correspond to mutations described in the Drosophila Rop protein (P254S and H302Y). They display different phenotypes in the fly, causing an increase in evoked neurotransmission and a dramatic reduction in both evoked and spontaneous neurotransmitter release, respectively (20.Wu M.N. Littleton J.T. Bhat M.A. Prokop A. Bellen H.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In addition, three entirely novel mutants were generated. The K314L/R315L double mutation destroys a pair of conserved basic residues predicted to localize in a solvent accessible loop, G541E substitutes a highly conserved glycine predicted to be buried in the fold of Munc18-2, and P187A substitutes a highly conserved proline which can be envisioned to create a kink that affects the positioning of neighboring secondary structure units. The previous observation that Munc18-2 and syntaxin 3 form a complex in epithelial cells (9.Riento K. Galli T. Jansson S. Ehnholm C. Lehtonen E. Olkkonen V.M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2681-2688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) prompted us to analyze the association of the Munc18-2 variants with syntaxin 3. An in vitro assay was set up to measure the amount of in vitro translated [35S]Met-labeled Munc18-2 bound to syntaxin 3 coated on 96-well plates (Fig. 2 A). The specificity of the assay was confirmed by competition of the signal by unlabeled Munc18-2 produced in insect cells, and the assay was highly linear in the entire radioactivi"
https://openalex.org/W1524405192,"In this study, Gβ specificity in the regulation of Gβγ-sensitive phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) and phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) isozymes was examined. Recombinant mammalian Gβ1–3γ2 complexes purified from Sf9 membranes stimulated PI3Kγ lipid kinase activity with similar potency (10–30 nm) and efficacy, whereas transducin Gβγ was less potent. Functionally active Gβ5γ2 dimers were purified from Sf9 cell membranes following coexpression of Gβ5 and Gγ2-His. This preparation as well as Gβ1γ2-His supported pertussis toxin-mediated ADP-ribosylation of Gαi1. Gβ1γ2-His stimulated PI3Kγ lipid and protein kinase activities at nanomolar concentrations, whereas Gβ5γ2-His had no effect. Accordingly, Gβ1γ2-His, but not Gβ5γ2-His, significantly stimulated the lipid kinase activity of PI3Kβ in the presence or absence of tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides derived from the p85-binding domain of the platelet derived-growth factor receptor. Conversely, both preparations were able to stimulate PLCβ2 and PLCβ1. However, Gβ1γ2-His, but not Gβ5γ2-His, activated PLCβ3. Experimental evidence suggests that the mechanism of Gβ5-dependent effector selectivity may differ between PI3K and PLCβ. In conclusion, these data indicate that Gβ subunits are able to discriminate among effectors independently of Gα due to selective protein-protein interaction.

In conclusion, these data indicate that Gβ subunits are able to discriminate among effectors independently of Gα due to selective protein-protein interaction. transducin Gβγ phosphoinositide 3-kinase phospholipase C 5-P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 4,5-P3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate nitrilotriacetic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis bovine brain Gβγ N-[2-hydroxy- 1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine G-protein-coupled receptors are part of a major signal recognition system in mammalian cells that perceives a vast variety of external physical and chemical entities (1.Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). These stimuli provoke cellular responses, thereby regulating almost any cellular function, including secretion, cell movement, growth, and differentiation. Accordingly, hundreds of ligands interact with >1000 of these heptahelical receptor proteins (2.Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17299-17302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 3.Wess J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 80: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In turn, ligand-occupied G-protein-coupled receptors couple to dozens of heterotrimeric G-protein combinations, which transduce the incoming signal into the cell (4.Gether U. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17979-17982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 5.Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Both GTP-bound Gα and Gβγ modulate an ever increasing number of enzymes, transporters, or ion channels (6.Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). On the G-protein level, signaling is controlled by the GTPase activity of Gα; stimulated by G-protein-coupled receptors; and fine-tuned by modulatory elements, including RGS (regulators of G-proteinsignaling) proteins (7.Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Hence, the guanine nucleotide-sensitive signal transduction machinery represents a highly complex network that also cross-talks to other systems such as growth factor-linked signaling systems. Different levels of finicky organization are required for a synchronized function. These include spatial and temporal expression of constituents as well as their specific and selective interaction. Accordingly, studies in living cells employing antisense RNA have demonstrated a remarkable specificity in the interaction between receptors and G-proteins (8.Kalkbrenner F. Dippel E. Wittig B. Schultz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1314: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, signaling specificity in whole cells appears to be significantly higher as compared with isolated and reconstituted components, which points to additional factors such as cell compartmentation or cell-specific protein expression patterns (9.Neubig R.R. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 10.Degtiar V. Harhammer R. Nürnberg B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 502: 321-333Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, selective protein-protein interactions obviously represent the first step in signaling specificity. Gα heterogeneity correlates with specificity in G-protein-effector coupling. This is reflected by the subdivision of Gα isoforms into four subfamilies that activate (Gαs) or inhibit (Gαi/o) adenylyl cyclases, stimulate phospholipase Cβ isozymes (Gαq), or regulate Rho proteins (Gα12/13). A corresponding structure-function relationship is missing for Gβγ dimers despite the existence of 7 Gβ and 12 Gγ isoforms, which are grouped into two and three subfamilies, respectively, and probably form hundreds of distinct combinations. Only TDβγ1(Gβ1γ1) differs, being consistently less potent in its ability to regulate effectors as compared with most other Gβγ combinations (6.Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). This difference is thought to be due to the C15 farnesyl moiety of Gγ1, whereas more potent isoforms are C20 geranylgeranylated. Hence, the lipophilic modification is assumed as an important criterion determining the potency by which Gβγ complexes modulate effectors. Furthermore, Gβ1–4 isoforms show a high amino acid sequence identity from 79 to 90%, which may in part explain the observed low level of effector specificity. Nevertheless, major contact sites with effectors are located on the Gβ subunit, which represent the structural basis to establish selective protein-protein interactions (11.Ford C.E. Skiba N.P. Bae H. Daaka Y. Reuveny E. Shekter L.R. Rosal R. Weng G. Yang C.S. Iyengar R. Miller R.J Jan L.Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Hamm H.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1271-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Gβ5, the youngest member of the Gβ subunit family, appears to be an exception. Its amino acid sequence exhibits only 53% identity to other Gβ isoforms with an insertion of additional 13 amino acids at the N terminus (12.Watson A.J. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22150-22156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This region is thought to be important for dimerization with Gγ as well as effector coupling, recommending Gβ5 as the candidate isoform to examine signaling specificity. In fact, a rather unique coupling pattern of Gβ5 has been reported. It not only binds to Gγ, but also dimerizes with RGS-6, -7, -9, and -11 proteins through interaction with a Gγ-like domain (13.Snow B.E. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Lee S.F. Wall M.A. Chung S.

Reconstitution experiments indicated that Gβ5 complexed to Gγ may selectively interact with Gαq-coupled receptors through specific association of Gβ5 with Gαq proteins (18.Fletcher J.E. Lindorfer M.A. DeFilippo J.M. Yasuda H. Guilmard M. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 636-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 19.Lindorfer M.A. Myung C.-S. Savino Y. Yasuda H. Khazan R. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34429-34436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Moreover, Gβγ transfection studies have suggested differences in the regulation of downstream signaling pathways such as mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase by Gβ5γ2 as compared with Gβ1γ2 (20.Zhang S. Coso O.A. Collins R. Gutkind J.S. Simonds W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20208-20212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms for this unusual behavior remain unclear. To examine the possibility of a so far unrecognized Gβ5-dependent specificity in effector regulation, we tested purified preparations of Gβ5complexed to Gγ2 for their ability to regulate PI3K and PLCβ isozymes. Heterodimeric Gβ5γ2 was functionally active, as it supported pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of purified Gαi1. However, Gβ5γ2 did not stimulate the lipid and protein kinase activities of PI3Ks. As a consequence, Gβ5γ2 also failed to activate voltage-operated calcium channels in rat portal vein myocytes. Surprisingly, Gβ5γ2 exhibited a remarkable specificity within different PLCβ isozymes. It potently and efficiently stimulated PLCβ2, and it stimulated PLCβ1, but not PLCβ3, with similar potency but less efficacy, suggesting that Gβ subunits are able to discriminate among highly related isozymes. Construction of recombinant baculoviruses for expression of PI3K subunits and PLCβ isoforms has been described (21.Camps M. Carozzi A. Schnabel P. Scheer A. Parker P.J. Gierschik P.

PLCβ2Δ, a deletion mutant of human PLCβ2 lacking a C-terminal region necessary for stimulation by Gαq, is indistinguishable from wild-type PLCβ2 in terms of its interaction with PI-4,5-P2, Ca2+, and Gβγ dimers (22.Illenberger D. Schwald F. Pimmer D. Binder W. Maier G. Dietrich A. Gierschik P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6241-6249Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The cDNA of human PLCβ3 cloned into theEcoRI site of a pBluescript vector was kindly provided by M. van Asseldonk (Department of Human Genetics, University Hospital Nijmegen, Nijmegen, The Netherlands) (25.Sinke R.J. Geurts van Kessel A.G. Genomics. 1995; 25: 568-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The construct was digested with EcoRI and ligated into this site in the pVL1393 transfer vector. Recombinant baculoviruses were produced as described previously. Expression and isolation of PI3K and PLCβ isoforms were carried out according to published protocols (22.Illenberger D. Schwald F. Pimmer D. Binder W. Maier G. Dietrich A. Gierschik P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6241-6249Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 24.Maier U. Babich A. Nürnberg B. J. Biol.

Purification of native Gβγ complexes and TDβγ from membranes isolated from bovine brains and retinal rod outer segments, respectively, have been described elsewhere (26.Gierschik P. Camps M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 27.Exner T. Jensen O.N. Kleuss C. Mann M. Nürnberg B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1327-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Baculoviruses encoding recombinant Gβ isoforms and Gγ2 were generated and characterized as detailed previously (28.Leopoldt D.

Membrane-associated recombinant Gβxγ2 complexes were purified by combined affinity and subunit exchange chromatography, followed by anion-exchange chromatography on Mono Q columns according to published protocols (30.Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Recombinant Gβxγ2-His complexes were obtained by affinity chromatography on a Ni2+-NTA column as outlined below (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Phosphate-buffered saline-washed cells (multiplicity of infection of 1 virus/subunit/cell) were resuspended in ice-cold buffer A (110 mm NaCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/mll-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 0.2 mmPefabloc® SC (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany)). Cells were disrupted by N2 cavitation (30 min at 4 °C, 25 bar) or by forcing the cell suspension through a 22-gauge needle (five times) and subsequently through a 26-gauge needle (10 times). The lysate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 2 min to remove nuclei and intact cells. Membranes were recovered at 80,000 × g for 30 min and subsequently extracted for 1 h with 0.9% sodium cholate and 0.5% Lubrol for isolation of recombinant Gβ1γ2-His or recombinant Gβ5γ2-His, respectively. The cleared extracts (100,000 × g, 1 h) were diluted five times with buffer B (20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Lubrol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 25 mm imidazole) and incubated with Ni2+-NTA-agarose (1 ml of slurry/7.5 × 108 infected cells) prewashed with buffer B for 1 h. The mixture was loaded onto a column cartridge and extensively washed with buffer B containing 20 mmimidazole. Thereafter, bound insect Gα subunits were eluted with buffer C (20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm MgCl2, 0.9% sodium cholate (recombinant Gβ1γ2-His) or 0.05% Lubrol (recombinant Gβ5γ2-His), 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 10 μm GDP, 30 μmAlCl3, and 10 mm NaF). Subsequently, hexahistidine-tagged Gβγ dimers were released from the matrix using a gradient of imidazole (20–150 mm, steps of 10 mm) in buffer D (20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium cholate (recombinant Gβ1γ2-His) or 0.37% octyl thioglucoside (recombinant Gβ5γ2-His), and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Purified proteins were quantified by Coomassie Blue staining following SDS-PAGE with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Integrity of recombinant Gβγ dimers was analyzed by rechromatography and pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gαi1 (27.Exner T. Jensen O.N. Kleuss C. Mann M. Nürnberg B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1327-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide used in this study, CGGY(P)MDMSKDESVDY(P)VPMLDM, was based on that of the human platelet-derived growth factor receptor (31.Stephens L. Smrcka A. Cooke F.T. Jackson T.R. Sternweis P.C. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1994; 77: 83-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) and kindly donated by Dr. Andreas Steinmeyer (Schering AG, Berlin). A non-phosphorylated peptide served as a control and had no effect on PI3K enzymatic activity. Generation and characterization of antisera against p101 and Gβ subunits (AS 398 and AS 422) were detailed elsewhere (28.Leopoldt D. Harteneck C. Nürnberg B. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch.

The polyclonal anti-p110β and monoclonal anti-p85 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Heidelberg, Germany). Antisera specific for human PLCβ2 and PLCβ3were a kind gift of Dr. P. J. Parker and were prepared as described elsewhere (34.Carozzi A.J. Kriz R.W. Webster C. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Preparations containing PLCβ2, PLCβ3; p110β, p110γ, p101, or p85α; Gβ and Gγ proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore, Eschborn, Germany). Visualization of specific antisera was performed using the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Experimental conditions for determination of Gβγ and PI3K association on lipid vesicles were similar to measurement of the enzymatic activity of PI3K. In brief, 35 μl of PI-4,5-P2-containing lipid vesicles (320 μm phosphatidylethanolamine, 300 μmphosphatidylserine, 140 μm phosphatidylcholine, 30 μm sphingomyelin, and 50 μmPI-4,5-P2) in buffer E (40 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 7 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmβ-glycerophosphate, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) were mixed with different concentrations of Gβγ complexes or vehicles only. After incubation on ice for 10 min, equal amounts of PI3Kβ (5 μl) were added and thoroughly mixed. After an additional 10 min on ice, 10 μl of reaction buffer (buffer E containing 40 μm ATP) were added, followed by incubation at 30 °C for 15 min. The mixture was put on ice and centrifuged for 2 min at 800 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant and pellet were separated and supplemented with electrophoresis sample buffer according to Laemmli (35.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Thirty μl of either solution were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Semiquantitative analysis was realized by immunoblotting using specific antisera against p110β and Gβ subunits. As a control, PI3Kβ lipid kinase activities were measured in parallel experiments. The results confirmed sensitivity of PI3Kβ lipid kinase activity to Gβ1γ2-His, but not to Gβ5γ2-His. The lipid kinase activity of PI3K isoforms was determined as detailed previously (23.Leopoldt D.

It was ensured that the effects of Gβγ on PI3K activity were not affected by their vehicles due to suppression of enzymatic activity by detergents. This was performed as described (24.Maier U.

The assay volume was 25 μl (2–3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/tube) and usually contained 7 mm Mg2+. Lipid vesicles were devoid of PI-4,5-P2. The reaction was stopped with 25 μl of ice-cold twice concentrated sample buffer according to Laemmli (35.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Following separation on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Dried membranes were exposed to Fuji imaging plates, and autoradiographic signals were quantitated with a Fuji BAS 1500 imager (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany). These were quantified as described previously (22.Illenberger D. Schwald F. Pimmer D. Binder W. Maier G. Dietrich A. Gierschik P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6241-6249Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In brief, 5 μl of purified Gβγ were supplemented with 10 μl of soluble fraction of insect cells; infected with baculoviruses encoding PLCβ isoforms (0.3–4.0 μg of protein/sample); and incubated for 5 or 30 min at 25 °C in a volume of 60 μl containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 70 mm KCl, 3 mm EGTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 33 μm[3H]PI-4,5-P2 (5 Ci/mol), and 536 μm phosphatidylethanolamine. In control experiments, we ascertained that soluble fractions from wild-type baculovirus-infected insect cells exhibited no Gβγ-sensitive PLC activity. Crucial experiments were repeated using purified PLCβ2Δ (22.Illenberger D. Schwald F. Pimmer D. Binder W. Maier G. Dietrich A. Gierschik P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6241-6249Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and showed results identical to those obtained with soluble fractions of PLCβ2Δ baculovirus-infected insect cells. Isolated myocytes from rat portal vein were obtained by enzymatic dispersion as described previously (36.Lepretre N. Mironneau J. Morel J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29546-29552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at density of ∼103cells/mm2 on glass slides in physiological solution and used the same day. Reconstitution experiments including voltage clamp and membrane current recordings were carried out exactly as described previously (32.Viard P. Exner T. Maier U. Mironneau J. Nürnberg B. Macrez N. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Cell capacitance was determined in each cell tested, and current density was expressed as the maximal Ba2+current amplitude per capacitance unit (pA/picofarads). Experiments were performed at 30 ± 1 °C. The physiological solution used to record Ba2+ currents contained 130 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm BaCl2, 11 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) with NaOH. The basic pipette solution contained 130 mm CsCl, 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm Na2ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3) with CsOH. Bovine serum albumin (0.1%) was added in the pipette solution to increase protein infusion and had no effect by itself on the current charge density. Averaged data are given as means ± S.D. if not stated otherwise. Statistical significance was tested with Student's t test for paired or unpaired data. The starting point of this study was the intriguing observation that in COS cells, Gβ5, in contrast to Gβ1, failed to signal to the mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathways following cotransfection with Gγ2 (20.Zhang S.

In this cell line, different PI3Ks have been identified as essential elements in the activation of mitogenic signaling cascades by G-protein-coupled receptors (37.Hawes B.E.

By doing so, we readily noticed significant differences in the sensitivity of heterodimeric PI3Kβ and PI3Kγ to bovine brain Gβγ (Gβγbov) complexes (Fig. 2 A). Whereas the lipid kinase activity of PI3Kγ was activated by Gβγbov with EC50 values lower than 20 nm, the corresponding values for PI3Kβ were calculated to be at least 100 nm. In contrast, both enzymes showed a similar sensitivity to Gβγ when stimulated in the absence of their particular non-catalytic subunit,i.e. p101 for p110γ and p85 for p110β (Fig.2 B). Furthermore, p110β was activated by Gβγ with identical EC50 values regardless of which substrate was used, i.e. phosphatidylinositol or PI-4,5-P2(data not shown). As expected, the presence of the p85 adaptor did not affect Gβγ-induced stimulation of p110β. In its heterodimeric state, PI3Kβ produced PI-3,4,5-P3 much more efficiently when co-stimulated with phosphotyrosyl peptides resembling an intracellular p85-binding region of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (data not shown, but see below). Taken together, these results confirm and extend our previous findings that the Gβγ complex directly interacts with the catalytic subunit of different PI3Ks and that the non-catalytic p101 subunit of PI3Kγ sensitizes p110γ for Gβγ in a PI-4,5-P2-dependent fashion (24.Maier U. Babich A. Nürnberg B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29311-29317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar).Figure 2Different sensitivities of G-protein-regulated class I PI3Ks to Gβγ. A, purified recombinant heterodimeric PI3Kβ (○) and PI3Kγ (●) were stimulated with increasing concentrations of bovine brain Gβγ using PI-4,5-P2 as a substrate. 32P-Labeled lipid products were isolated and quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are means ± S.D. of -fold stimulation. Basal activities were 0.047 ± 0.003 and 0.138 ± 0.014 mol·min−1·mol−1 for PI3Kβ and PI3Kγ, respectively. B, the same experimental conditions were used as described for A, except that recombinant monomeric p110β (○) and p110γ (●) were employed. The basal activities were found to be 1.05 ± 0.14 and 0.25 ± 0.03 mol·min−1·mol−1 for p110β and p110γ, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since Gβγbov purified from Gi/o proteins represents a mixture of Gβ and Gγ isoforms, we expressed defined Gβγ subsets in Sf9 cells. Earlier studies have revealed that the Gγ subunit affects the ability of the Gβγ complex to modulate effectors (40.Boyer J.L. Graber S.G. Waldo G.L. Harden T.K. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2814-2819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Myung C.-S. Yasuda H. Liu W.W. Harden T.K. Garrison J.C. J. Biol.

We therefore coexpressed Gβ isoforms with Gγ2, which was previously shown to associate efficiently with Gβ isoforms, and subsequently purified membrane-associated G-proteins from Sf9 cells by using the approach introduced by Kozasa and Gilman (30.Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Thereafter, purified recombinant Gβ1γ2, Gβ2γ2, and Gβ3γ2 as well as native TDβγ were tested for their ability to stimulate the lipid kinase activity of PI3Kγ (Fig.3). The results demonstrated stimulatory activity of all four preparations tested, allowing several immediate conclusions. First, no marked differences in the potency between the three Gβ isoforms complexed to Gγ2 were visible. Second, as noticed for other effector systems, TDβγ was less potent (EC50 > 500 nm) than Gβγ combinations containing a Gγ predicted to be geranylgeranylated. Third, EC50 values of ∼30 nm were found for Gβxγ2 preparations, indicating that recombinant Gβγ dimers exhibited potencies almost indistinguishable from that of native Gβγbov. It should be noted that despite some reports describing Gβ3γ2 as an unfavorable combination (42.Schmidt C.J. Thomas T.C. Levine M.A. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13807-13810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Pronin A.N. Gautam N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast, we could not examine the shorter splice variant of Gβ3,i.e. Gβ3(s), since, in our hands, it did not form a complex with Gαi1-His and Gγ2. Purified Gβ3γ2 stimu"

The attachment sites of l-Ara4N and pEtN in EV3 and EV6 are demonstrated unequivocally to be at positions 4′ and 1, respectively, by selective inverse decoupling difference spectroscopy (SIDDS) (37.Ribeiro A.A.

Our results indicate that thel-Ara4N and pEtN substituents are not always located at the same sites on lipid A species, even in closely related samples. The fact that both l-Ara4N and pEtN can be attached at either the 1 or the 4′ phosphates suggests that there may be multiple (or bifunctional) enzymes for transferring each of these substituents to lipid A precursors. Our new NMR methods should facilitate the re-evaluation of all lipid A structures for which l-Ara4N and pEtN substituents have been proposed previously (5.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar, 14.Galanos C.

Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18503-18514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 0.5 mg sample of lipid IIA or IIIA was dissolved in chloroform/methanol (4:1, v/v) and applied in a thin line to a 20 × 20-cm Silica Gel 60 TLC plate. The plate was developed in the solvent chloroform/pyridine/88% formic acid/water (40:60:16:5, v/v). While the plates were drying at room temperature, the lipid bands could be seen transiently as white zones. These bands were marked with a pencil, and the plates were then allowed to dry completely at room temperature for ∼20 min before each marked zone was scraped off with a clean razor blade. The purified band from each plate was then extracted from the silica chips for 40 min with 24.0 ml of an acidic single-phase Bligh-Dyer mixture (41.Bligh E.G. Dyer J.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (42382) Google Scholar, 42.Nishijima M. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7837-7844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which consists of chloroform/methanol/50 mm ammonium acetate adjusted to pH 1.5 with HCl (1:2:0.8, v/v). The silica chips were removed by low-speed centrifugation, and the supernatant was passed through a small plug of glass wool inside a Pasteur pipette. The filtered extract was then converted to a two-phase Bligh-Dyer mixture by the addition of 6.0 ml each of chloroform and 50 mm ammonium acetate (pH 1.5). The lower phase was collected and neutralized by addition of 24 drops of pyridine. Lastly, 30 drops of methanol were added to clear the solution, and the sample was dried under a stream of N2. To remove residual small silica particles and metal ions introduced by the preparative TLC as well as any minor breakdown products, lipids IIA and IIIA were further purified by step elution from a DEAE-cellulose minicolumn, as described previously (12.Zhou Z. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18503-18514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 2-ml DEAE-cellulose column (Whatman DE52) was prepared in the acetate form and washed with 40 ml of chloroform/methanol/water (2:3:1, v/v) (12.Zhou Z. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R. J.

Approximately 1 mg of lipid IIAor IIIA was dissolved in 10 ml of chloroform/methanol/water (2:3:1, v/v) and loaded onto a column. The column was washed with 10 ml each of chloroform/methanol/water (2:3:1, v/v) and chloroform/methanol/60 mm neutral ammonium acetate (2:3:1, v/v). Lipid IIA or IIIA was then eluted with 24 ml of chloroform/methanol/120 mm neutral ammonium acetate (2:3:1, v/v), and 3-ml fractions were collected. To visualize the emerging compounds, 20 μl of each fraction was spotted onto a 10 × 20-cm Silica Gel 60 TLC plate, which was developed in the solvent chloroform/pyridine/88% formic acid/water (40:60:16:5, v/v). The elution profile was then visualized by spraying with ethanol/p-anisaldehyde:H2SO4:acetic acid (89:2.5:4:1, v/v) (34.Christ W.J. McGuinness P.D. Asano O. Wang Y. Mullarkey M.A. Perez M.

The DEAE-cellulose fractions of interest were converted to a neutral two-phase Bligh-Dyer mixture by adjusting the solvent ratios as described previously for the purification of EV3 and EV6 (12.Zhou Z. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18503-18514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Both the lower and upper phases were saved. Each upper phase was extracted once with 4.0 ml of a fresh lower phase from a neutral two-phase Bligh-Dyer mixture. The relevant lower phases containing the purified lipids were pooled and dried under N2. All samples were stored at −20 °C. Lipid compounds (1–8 mg) were usually dissolved in 0.6 ml of CDCl3/CD3OD/D2O (2:3:1, v/v) and transferred into 5-mm NMR tubes. NMR spectra were obtained at 25 °C using a Varian Unity 500 spectrometer equipped with a Sun Sparc 2 data system and a 5-mm Varian inverse probe. The 2H signal of CD3OD was used for a field frequency lock. The pulse sequences from Varian were modified to allow a long, low-power transmitter pulse for solvent signal elimination at a frequency different from the nonselective high power pulses at the quadrature frequency. One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 500 MHz with a 6 KHz spectral window digitized into 40K data points (digital resolution of 0.3 Hz/point or ∼0.0006 ppm/point), a pulse angle of 67° (6 μs), an acquisition time of 4.8 s, and a relaxation delay of 2 s. Proton chemical shifts were referenced to internal tetramethylsilane (δH = 0.000 ppm). COSY spectra were recorded in absolute value mode (43.Bax A.R.F. Morris G.A. J. Magn. Reson. 1981; 42: 164-168Google Scholar, 44.Bax A. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1981; 44: 542-561Google Scholar) with a 6 KHz spectral window, 2K data points (a digital resolution of 6 Hz/point or ∼0.01 ppm/point), 1-s relaxation delay, and 32 scans/increment. Typically, 512 time increments were collected and zero-filled to 2K points with a sine-bell weighting in both dimensions before Fourier transformation and symmetrization of the 2D matrix. NOESY data (45.Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachmann P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4552Crossref Scopus (4827) Google Scholar) were collected in the phase-sensitive mode using the hypercomplex method with two sets of 256 time-incremented spectra, 48 scans/increment, 1-s relaxation delay, and a mixing time of 450 ms. The 2D matrix was processed with Gaussian weighting in both dimensions and zero-filled to 2K × 2K. The 2D NOESY matrix was not symmetrized. Directly detected 1H-decoupled 31P NMR spectra were recorded at 202.37 MHz with a spectral window of 12143.3 Hz digitized into 25,280 data points (digital resolution of 1 Hz/point or ∼0.005 ppm/point), a 60° pulse flip angle (8 μs), and a 1.6-s repeat time. 31P chemical shifts were referred to 85% H3PO4 (δP = 0.000 ppm).1H-31P 2D chemical shift correlation spectra were recorded using HMQC (46.Byrd R.A. Summers M.F. Zon G. Fouts C.S. Marzilli L.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 504-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) without 31P decoupling and coupling delays set at 71 ms (7.0 Hz optimization). Two sets of 256 time increments were obtained in the phase-sensitive mode using 2K points in t2, processed using Gaussian functions, and zero-filled to a final size of 2K × 2K. In these experiments, 128 transients were obtained per time increment, and the relaxation delay was 1 s. SIDDS was implemented as 1H-detected31P-decoupled heteronuclear NMR experiments, as described previously (37.Ribeiro A.A. Zhou Z. Raetz C.R.H. Magn. Reson. Chem. 1999; 37: 620-630Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 31P resonance of interest was selectively irradiated on- and off-resonance using 1 s of low-power, continuous wave excitation (estimated 0.2 mW and about 4 db on the Unity 500 spectrometer) during the acquisition period, while detecting the 1H NMR spectrum at high digitization. To improve the quality of free induction decay subtraction in the generation of 31P-decoupled 1H-detected NMR difference spectra, NMR samples were thermally equilibrated in the magnet for over 1 h before recording data. The 1H difference spectra were recorded in an interleaved manner with four scans accumulated for each free induction decay and looping aroundn times to achieve a good signal:noise ratio with 4n scans per free induction decay. E. coli K-12 lipid A and its precursors readily dissolve in chloroform/methanol (4:1, v/v or 2:1, v/v) (31.Ray B.L. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a specific and potent angiogenic factor and contributes to the development of solid tumors by promoting tumor angiogenesis. Therefore, it is a prime therapeutic target for the development of antagonists for treatment of cancer. We identified from peptide libraries arginine-rich hexapeptides that inhibit the interaction of VEGF165 with VEGF receptor (IC50 = 2–4 μm). They have no effect on binding of basic fibroblast growth factor to cellular receptor. The hexapeptides inhibit the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells induced by VEGF165 without toxicity. The peptides bind to VEGF and inhibit binding of both VEGF165and VEGF121, suggesting that the peptides interact with the main body of VEGF but not the heparin-binding domain that is absent in VEGF121. The identified peptides block the angiogenesis induced by VEGF165 in vivo in the chick chorioallantoic membrane and the rabbit cornea. Furthermore, one of the hexapeptides, RRKRRR, blocks the growth and metastasis of VEGF-secreting HM7 human colon carcinoma cells in nude mice. Based on our results, the arginine-rich hexapeptides may be effective for the treatment of various human tumors and other angiogenesis-dependent diseases that are related to the action of VEGF and could also serve as leads for development of more effective drugs.

In physiological states such as embryonic development of vascular system, wound healing, and the female reproductive system, neovascularization is turned on for a brief periods and then completely inhibited by a balance of stimulatory and inhibitory factors (1.Liotta L.A. Steeg P.S. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cell. 1991; 64: 327-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2639) Google Scholar). These finely tuned controls may fail and result in the induction of normal blood vessels to grow at accelerated rate in a harmful way during the development of many diseases including solid tumor growth and metastasis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetic retinopathy, and various inflammatory disorders (2.Kohn E.C.

Therefore, angiogenesis could be a rate-determining step not only for tumor expansion but also for the onset of malignancy. Numerous angiogenic factors have been identified, but many of these factors possess only very little or no direct mitogenicity on vascular endothelial cells (7.Bussolino F. Mantovani A. Persico P.

Thus, the VEGF/VEGF receptor system is an attractive target for inhibition of tumor angiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis (25.Martiny-Baron G. Marme D. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1995; 6: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The information available to date suggests that direct, structure-based rational design of small molecule inhibitors would be difficult to succeed. However, the development of small molecule drug candidates from combinatorial library of small peptides has proven remarkably successful (26.Gho Y.S. Lee J.E. Oh K.S. Bae D.G. Chae C.-B. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3733-3740PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Park J.Y. Kim I.J. Lee M.H. Seo J.K. Suh P.G. Cho B.Y. Ryu S.H. Chae C.-B.

In this study, we have identified from soluble hexapeptide libraries arginine-rich peptides that can block the interaction between VEGF165 and the VEGF receptors on the surface of endothelial cells. The arginine-rich hexapeptides inhibit VEGF-induced proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells by direct interaction with VEGF165. The inhibition is concentration-dependent, and the peptides do not have any cytotoxic effect on HUVE cells. Furthermore, the basic peptides show significant inhibition of angiogenesis induced by VEGF in the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and the rabbit cornea neovascularization assays. They also inhibit growth and metastasis of VEGF-secreting HM7 human colon carcinoma cells in nude mice without cytotoxicity against the cells. These studies show that the peptides can be used for the treatments of various angiogenesis-dependent diseases including growth and metastasis of human tumors. The peptides will also serve as lead compounds for development of more effective anti-angiogenic molecules. Fetal bovine serum, bovine calf serum, antibiotics, medium 199, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were from Life Technologies, Inc. Tissue culture dishes and plastic-wares were obtained from Falcon Plastics. Tissue culture trays (24-well) were from Costar. Recombinant human VEGF was from R & D Systems or purified from Escherichia coli. Bovine basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals.125I-VEGF165 (2057 Ci/mmol),125I-bFGF (1200 Ci/mmol), Na125I, and methyl-[3H]thymidine (76 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Fertilized chicken eggs (day 0) were from Pullmuone Co. Thermanox coverslip (13 mm round) were from Nunc. All the other reagents and chemicals were from Sigma. All the materials used in this report were verified as analytical grade. The peptide library (PS-SPCL) was synthesized at the Peptide Library Support Facility of Pohang University of Science and Technology in Korea, according to the method suggested by Pinillaet al. (28.Pinilla C. Appel J.R. Blanc P. Houghten R.A. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 901-905PubMed Google Scholar). HUVE cells (Clonetics) were cultured as described previously (29.Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (6001) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, HUVE cells were grown and maintained in gelatin-coated dishes in medium 199 supplemented with 20% bovine calf serum, 50 μg/ml of heparin, 6 μg/ml of endothelial cell growth supplement, 5 ng/ml of bFGF, and antibiotics. HM7 human colon carcinoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal bovine serum. All cultures were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air/5% CO2, passaged in a split ratio of 1:2 or 1:3, and all experiments with HUVE cells were carried out between passages 5 and 9. HUVE cells expressing VEGF and bFGF receptors were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well in gelatin-coated 24-well plates, incubated at 37 °C for 2 days, washed with warm binding buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in serum-free medium 199 (∼180 mm of salt), and incubated at 37 °C for 2–3 h. The cultures were then transferred to 4 °C on an oscillating platform set at 1 cycle/s. Various concentrations of radiolabeled VEGF or bFGF were added in 200 μl of binding buffer, and the binding was allowed to proceed at 4 °C for 3 h. Nonspecific binding was determined by binding experiments in the presence of 100-fold excesses of nonlabeled VEGF or bFGF. At the end of the incubation, the cells were washed twice with cold binding buffer followed by washing in cold PBS containing 0.1% BSA. Subsequently, the cells were solubilized by the addition of 0.5 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCI, pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 20 min on an oscillating platform set at 2 cycles/s, and the receptor-bound radioactivity was determined in a γ counter. All experiments were carried out in duplicate and at least twice. The variation between duplicate determinations in an experiment was less than 10%. For screening of peptide libraries, the procedures described for the binding of125I-VEGF165 to HUVE cells were followed. After washing HUVE cells in 24-well plates with warm binding buffer, 0.2 ng of 125I-VEGF165 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and various concentrations of peptide pools or peptides were mixed in 200 μl of binding buffer with or without an excess of nonlabeled VEGF165 (20 ng/well) and preincubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The binding was allowed to proceed at 4 °C for 3 h. The peptide pools or peptides that showed inhibitory effect on the binding of 125I-VEGF165 to its receptors on the surface of HUVE cells were determined. Hexapeptide (100 ng/well) in 20% acetic acid was added to each well of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate and dried overnight. The wells were washed and blocked three times with PBS containing 0.1% BSA at room temperature. To each well was added125I-VEGF165 (0.2 ng/well) in 50 μl of PBS containing 0.1% BSA with or without an excess of nonlabeled VEGF165 (500 ng/well) or various amounts of each peptide. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, each well was washed with PBS containing 0.1% BSA at room temperature four times, and the bound125I-VEGF165 was solubilized with 150 μl of 0.1 n NaOH. The bound radioactivity was determined in a γ counter. To investigate the interaction of RRKRRR with heparin at the physiological salt concentration, heparin-Sepharose beads (100 μg; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were incubated with 300 μl of 100 μm RRKRRR in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, in the presence or absence of 0.18m NaCl at room temperature for an hour. The unbound peptide was recovered by transfer of each mixture into a spin column (Sigma) and brief centrifugation. The remaining beads were washed twice with 125 μl of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, at room temperature for 5 min, and the bound peptide was eluted by incubation of the bead with 125 μl of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 m NaCl at room temperature for 30 min and brief centrifugation, twice. To each well of a 96-well plate, 100 μl of each peptide solution was added with equal volume of 0.05% fluorescamine (Sigma) in acetone and incubated at room temperature for 30 min in the dark area. The amount of bound and unbound peptide was quantitated from standard curve prepared with the known amount of RRKRRR by using a microplate fluorometer (excitation, 386 nm, and emission, 480 nm; Cambridge Technology). Various forms of VEGF cDNAs (VEGF165, VEGF121, VEGF8–121, VEGF109, and VEGF8–109) were amplified from human liver cDNA library (CLONTECH) by polymerase chain reaction with appropriate primers. The resulting DNAs were inserted into a bacterial expression vector pRSET A (Invitrogen). Thereafter, the sequences of the inserted cDNAs were verified by DNA sequencing. Each of the five VEGF expression vectors were transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLsysS carrying an inducible T7 RNA polymerase gene, and the transformants were cultured, induced atA 600 = 0.5 with 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside at 37 °C for 3 h, and harvested. Inclusion bodies containing bacterial-expressed VEGFs were purified, solubilized, and refolded as previously reported (30.Siemeister G. Schnurr B. Mohrs K. Schachtele C. Marme D. Martiny-Baron G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and the refolded VEGF dimers were purified with Mono-S cation exchange fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for VEGF165 dimer and Mono-Q anion exchange fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for other forms of VEGF dimers. Thereafter, all forms of VEGF dimers are further purified by more than 90% homogeneity with C4 reverse phase HPLC column (Phenomenex), lyophilized, stored at −70 °C, and quantitated by protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). All of the five VEGF dimers appear to be properly folded because they can bind to VEGF receptors expressed on the surface of HUVE cells and have mitogenic activity on HUVE cells. Purified human recombinant VEGF165, 121, 8–121,109, and 8–109 (5 μg each) were iodinated, using an IODO-Bead (Pierce) and 0.5 mCi of Na125I according to the manufacturer's instructions, and free iodine was removed by extensive rounds of dialysis at 4 °C. Radiolabeled VEGFs were quantitated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with mouse monoclonal anti-human VEGF antibody (R & D Systems). Specific activities of radiolabeled VEGF165, 121, 8–121,109, and 8–109 were 2094, 1107, 571, 1373, and 601 Ci/mmol, respectively. Growth assay of HUVE cells was carried out according to the procedure described by Kondo et al. (31.Kondo S. Asano M. Suzuki H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 1234-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) with some modifications. HUVE cells were seeded in a gelatin-coated 48-well culture plate at a density of 104cells/well in 300 μl of the growth medium, and incubated at 37 °C for 2 days. The plate was washed three times with warm, serum-free medium 199, and incubated in 200 μl of serum-free medium 199 containing 10 ng/ml of VEGF and various concentrations of hexapeptide for a day. Thereafter, 10 μl of methyl-[3H]thymidine (0.5 μCi) was added to each well, and the cells were incubated for a day. Cells were washed four times with PBS containing 0.1% BSA, solubilized with 150 μl of 0.4 n NaOH at room temperature for 20 min, and then neutralized with 30 μl of 2.0 n HCl. The radioactivity was determined in a liquid scintillation counter. All experiments were carried out in triplicate and at least twice. The CAM assay has been extensively used to study the effect of angiogenic and antiangiogenic compounds in vivo (32.Jakob W. Jentzsch K.D. Mauersberger B. Heder G. Exp. Pathol. 1978; 15: 241-249Google Scholar). Fertilized chicken eggs were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified air and designated as day 0. Ovalbumin (2 ml) was removed from each egg on day 3, and a window was made into the eggshell. The embryos were checked for normal development on day 4–5. The window was sealed with cellotape, and the eggs were further incubated until day 9. The lyophilized VEGF165 (R & D Systems) and the samples to be tested were dissolved in salt-free, sterile distilled water, and 10 ng of VEGF165 plus various amounts of test samples in 3 μl were placed on a [¼] piece of 13-mm thermanox coverslip. After air drying, the inverted coverslips were placed on a relatively avascular area of 9-day-old chick CAM. Following another 2 days of incubation, negative or positive response, i.e. the appearance of the typical “spokewheel” pattern (33.Folkman J. Cancer Res. 1974; 34: 2109-2113PubMed Google Scholar), was assessed under a microscope and then photographed. Male New Zealand White rabbits weighing 3 kg were used for corneal neovascularization experiment. Intramuscular ketamine anesthesia (44 mg/kg) was supplemented by retrobulbar infiltration with 2% lidocaine. The eye was moved forward and secured in position by fingers. With a Bard-Parker #11 blade, a superficial incision 3 mm long was made on the corneal dome to one side of its center. The incision was then continued down into, but not through, the cornea. A #15 blade was inserted and an oblong pocket was fashioned within the corneal stroma, and then the peripheral pockets ended 3 mm from the limbus. Recombinant human VEGF165 (10 ng, R & D Systems) with or without 1 μg of EEFDDA or RRKRRR was added on the sterile 3.0-mm-diameter thermanox disc, and it was dried overnight in the clean bench. The disc was deposited in the bottom of each pocket, which is then sealed spontaneously. All procedures were performed under sterile condition. Sixteen days later, when the neovascularization was prominent, the corneal vessels were photographed with photo slit lamp (Nikon, FS-2, Japan). Six animals were used for each group. Confluent HM7 human colon cancer cell cultures were harvested by brief trypsinization (0.05% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA in Hanks' balanced salt solution without calcium and magnesium), washed three times with calcium and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline solution, and resuspended at a final concentration of 5 × 106 cells/ml in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The presence of single-cell suspensions was confirmed by a phase-contrast microscopy, and cell viability was determined by Trypan blue exclusion, and only single-cell suspensions of >90% viability were used. Equal volumes of normal physiologic saline or each of the two peptides (EEFDDA or RRKRRR) at a concentration of 0.5 μg/μl were mixed with the cell suspensions. 5 × 106 viable tumor cells containing normal saline or each of the peptides in 100 μl were injected subcutaneously over the right scapular region of pathogen-free, 4-week-old male athymic nude mice (BALB/c/nu/nu). From the following day, mice received subcutaneous injection of each of the peptides (50 μg in 100 μl of saline) or control normal physiologic saline (100 μl) until 15 days after tumor cell implantation. Mice were surveyed regularly, and tumors were measured with a caliper, and volumes were determined using the following formula: volume = 0.5 × (width)2 × length. Each experimental group consisted of six to seven animals, and a p of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The inhibitory effect of the peptides on colonization of colon cancer cells in the liver after entry into the hepatic portal system was tested in a splenic injection model (34.Bresalier R.S. Niv Y. Byrd J.C. Duh Q.-Y. Toribara N.W. Rockwell R.W. Dahiya R. Kim Y.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1037-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Tumor cells were grown to confluency in 75-cm2tissue culture flasks, harvested as described for tumor growth inhibition assay, and resuspended in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at a concentration of 107 cells/ml. Equal volumes of normal physiologic saline or each of the three peptides (EEFDDA, KKKKKK, or RRKRRR) at a concentration of 0.5 μg/μl were mixed with the cell suspension. Four-week-old male athymic nude mice were anesthetized with diethyl ether by inhalation, and the spleen was exteriorized through a flank incision. One million cells containing normal saline or each of the three peptides in 100 μl were slowly injected into the lower polar side of the splenic pulp through a 27-gauge needle followed by splenectomy 1 min later. From the following day, mice received subcutaneous injections of each three peptides (50 μg in 100 μl) or control normal physiologic saline (100 μl) for 3 weeks after splenic tumor cell injection. Animals were scarified 4 weeks later, the livers were removed and weighed, and tumor nodules were counted. All experiments were performed with six to seven animals per group. A p of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. HM7 cells (5 × 103cells/well) were plated to each well of a 96-well culture plate. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, varying concentrations of the basic peptides diluted in 100 μl of serum-free culture medium were added to each well. Following incubation for three additional days, the number of viable cells was determined using cell titer 96 nonradioactive proliferation assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each experiment was carried out in triplicate, and the average value was used to determine the percentage of viability. Cytotoxic effects on HUVE cells were performed as described above under “Cell Proliferation Assay” in the absence of VEGF. Values of results are expressed as the means and standard deviation of the mean, and significance is established by Student's t test. In all analyses, the level of statistical significance was more than 95% confidence level (p < 0.05). In this study we attempted to identify the peptide sequences that inhibit binding of VEGF to the cell surface receptor from mixtures of random sequences of peptide (peptide library). The identified peptides would then be investigated for their effect on the VEGF-induced proliferation of endothelial cells and angiogenesis. The peptide library used in this study was PS-SPCL originally developed by Houghten and his group (28.Pinilla C. Appel J.R. Blanc P. Houghten R.A. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 901-905PubMed Google Scholar). In this library system, each position of a hexapeptide pool is fixed with a known amino acid, and the other five positions are coupled with random mixtures of 20 amino acids. For each position, 20 peptide pools are possible, and a total of 120 peptide pools can be made. By assaying 120 pools, the amino acids important at each position of active peptides can be determined. Based on this information, reiterative synthesis of peptides can be conducted to identify the sequences of most active peptides. With the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures,” we observed specific binding of125I-VEGF165 to HUVE cells grown in a 24-well plate. There are two types of binding sites, one with dissociation constant (K D) of 3 pm (∼2000 sites/cell) and the other with K D of 50 pm (∼6000 sites/cell). The results are in agreement with those reported by others (30.Siemeister G. Schnurr B. Mohrs K. Schachtele C. Marme D. Martiny-Baron G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Nonspecific binding was less than 5%. Subconfluent HUVE cells were incubated with125I-VEGF and various concentrations of each peptide pool or hexapeptide with a defined sequence. The soluble hexapeptide library PS-SPCL was prepared with 19 amino acids lacking cysteine because the presence of cysteine causes inter- and intra-cross-linking of peptides. Thus, the libraries (2.8 × 108 hexapeptides) are composed of 19 × 6 pools in which each pool contain about 2.5 × 106 diversities. Fig.1 shows the general pattern of inhibition of the binding of VEGF to its receptor by PS-SPCL, and the amino acids at each position of the hexapeptides that show significant contribution to the inhibition are listed in Table I.

Previously, we suggested that channel and exchanger are associated (Bauer, P. J., and Drechsler, M. (1992) J. Physiol.(Lond.) 451, 109–131). This suggestion has been thoroughly examined using a variety of biochemical approaches. First, we took advantage of the fact that cGMP-gated channels bind calmodulin (CaM). Using CaM affinity chromatographic purification of the channel in 10 mm CHAPS, a significant fraction of exchanger was co-eluted with the channel indicating a binding affinity between channel and exchanger. Binding of channel and exchanger was examined more directly by cross-linking of proteins in the rod outer segment membranes. Activation of the channel with cyclic 8-bromo-GMP lead to exposure of a cysteine, which allowed cross-linking of the channel to the exchanger with the thiol-specific reagentdl-1,4-bismaleimido-2,3-butanediol. Cleavage of the cross-links and electrophoretic analysis indicated that a cross-link between the α-subunit of the channel and the exchanger formed. Furthermore, a cross-link between two adjacent α-subunits of the channel was found, suggesting that the α-subunits of the native channel are dimerized. Further support for an interaction between α-subunit and exchanger was obtained by in vitroexperiments. Specific binding of the exchanger to the α-subunit but not to the β-subunit of the channel was observed in Western blots of purified channel incubated with purified exchanger. This study suggests that two exchanger molecules bind to one cGMP-gated channel and, more specifically, that binding of exchanger molecules occurs at the α-subunits, which in the native channel are dimerized.

Whereas most of this dark current in rod photoreceptors is carried by Na+ ions, about 15% of the current is because of influx of Ca2+ ions, and about 5% is because of an influx of Mg2+ ions in rod photoreceptors (4.Nakatani K.

Na+ ions are primarily responsible for the light-induced voltage signal of the photoreceptor, whereas Ca2+ ions function intracellularly as a second messenger in sensitivity regulation and recovery. Ca2+ is extruded out of the cell by a Na/Ca-K exchanger, which utilizes both the Na+ inward and the K+ outward gradient as driving forces for the uphill Ca2+ transport (7.Schnetkamp P.P.M. Basu D.K. Szerencsei R.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C153-C157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Cervetto L. Lagnado L. Perry R.J. Robinson D.W. McNaughton P.A. Nature. 1989; 337: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Closure of the cGMP-gated channels upon photon excitation of the cell leads to a drop in the internal Ca2+ concentration (9.Ratto G.M. Payne R. Owen W.G. Tsien R.W. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 3240-3246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Gray-Keller M.P. Detwiler P.B. Neuron. 1994; 13: 849-861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 11.McCarthy S.T.

This negative Ca2+ signal plays a key role in light adaptation of photoreceptors (12.Fain G.L. Matthews H.R.

If locally excited by a flash of light, adaptation in rod outer segment is a spatially restricted phenomenon (17.Lamb T.D. McNaughton P.A. Yau K.-W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1981; 319: 463-496Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Very recently, it has been shown that the spatial spread of adaptation upon excitation of a rod photoreceptor by two photon absorption and the intracellular Ca2+ diffusion kinetics is largely consistent with the hypothesis that Ca2+ is a messenger of adaptation (18.Gray-Keller M.P. Denk W. Shraiman B. Detwiler P.B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 519: 679-692Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In several neuronal and neurosecretory cells, Ca2+signaling has been established to be a local event occurring only in very restricted microdomains (19.Augustine G.J. Neher E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 450: 247-271Crossref Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 20.Roberts W.M. Nature. 1993; 363: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 21.Roberts W.M. J.

Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 259-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). For rod photoreceptors, we have recently demonstrated that Na/Ca-K exchangers form dimers in the plasma membrane of the rod outer segment (24.Schwarzer A. Kim T.S.Y. Hagen V. Molday R.S. Bauer P.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13667-13676Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, we suggested from a Ca2+ flux study that exchanger and channel are associated indicating that possibly in photoreceptors, too, Ca2+signaling may be restricted to the close vicinity of the channel (1.Bauer P.J. Drechsler M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 451: 109-131Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We report here biochemical evidence supporting the idea that the Na/Ca-K exchanger is bound to the cGMP-gated channel in the plasma membrane of rod photoreceptors. Short reports of this study have been given (25.Schwarzer A. Bauer P.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112 (abstr.): 20Google Scholar, 26.Schwarzer A. Schauf H. Bauer P.J. Biophys. J. 2000; 78 (abstr.): 142Google Scholar). Purified ROS1 were prepared by discontinuous sucrose flotation as described (27.Bauer P.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1988; 401: 309-327Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the ROS that contained 5 mg of rhodopsin were pelleted in 600 mmsucrose for 30 min at 15,000 × g at 4 °C (buffer: 10 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 7.0 with KOH, 300 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmCaCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol), shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use. ROS membranes were prepared by hypotonic lysis of purified ROS in 0.5 mm Tris, 0.5 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and the protease inhibitors 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2.2 μg/mltrans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido(4-guanidino)butane. To avoid bleaching of rhodopsin, cross-linking with ROS membranes was carried out in dim red light. Cross-linking with the dimaleimide BMDB 2This is identical to the recently described reagent BMBD (24.Schwarzer A. Kim T.S.Y. Hagen V. Molday R.S. Bauer P.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13667-13676Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar); this reagent is now commercially available from Pierce, Calbiochem, or Fluka. and modification of cysteine groups with NEM were carried out as described previously (24.Schwarzer A. Kim T.S.Y. Hagen V. Molday R.S. Bauer P.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13667-13676Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Biotinylation of cysteines was carried out by incubation of the ROS membranes at room temperature in 200 μm biotinmaleimide (buffer: 10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). The reaction was terminated after 15 min by adding 10 mm dithiothreitol (final concentration). Purification of the cGMP-gated channel and of the thiol-specific cross-links of the channel was carried out by CaM affinity chromatography following the protocol of Hsu and Molday (28.Hsu Y.-T. Molday R.S. Nature. 1993; 361: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) with some modifications. ROS membranes (containing 30 mg of rhodopsin) were solubilized in 30 ml of 18 mmCHAPS (buffer: 10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol) for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged for 30 min at 48,300 × g. The supernatant was loaded on 4 ml of CaM-agarose (Sigma, P-4385), and nonbound proteins were eluted with ∼15 ml of 15 mm CHAPS in the same buffer but with 200 mm NaCl and 1 mm CaCl2 (wash buffer). Bound proteins were eluted with 15 mm CHAPS in the same buffer but with 150 mm NaCl and with 2 mmEDTA instead of CaCl2 (elution buffer). To purify the cGMP-gated channel by CaM affinity chromatography for functional reconstitution into PC vesicles, 2 mg/ml PC was present throughout, and the CaCl2 concentration was 0.5 mm in the solubilization and the wash buffers. Moreover, a significant fraction of exchanger was co-purified if the CHAPS concentration was lowered to 10 mm throughout the CaM affinity chromatography (see Fig. 1). Functional reconstitution was carried out as described in Ref. 29.Cook N.J. Hanke W. Kaupp U.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 585-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar with some modifications. Briefly, final concentrations of 10 mg/ml PC and 10 mmCaCl2 were added to the bound fraction, and the solution was adjusted to 100 mm KCl, 10 mm CHAPS. The detergent was removed by dialysis for 20 h at 4 °C against 4 liters of 5 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol with one change of the dialysis buffer. To examine the binding affinity between the solubilized exchanger and the cGMP-gated channel, the solubilization and purification by CaM chromatography was carried out in 10 mm CHAPS and 1 mg/ml PC, leaving the other conditions unchanged (see “CaM Affinity Chromatography”). After the addition of 12 mm CaCl2, the bound fraction was subjected to a second CaM affinity chromatography. External Ca2+ was removed by passage of the suspension through Chelex 100 in the K-form (Bio-Rad) using a Swinnex-13 filter holder (Millipore) with a 3-μm pore size Nuclepore filter. Samples of 1 ml were added to a stirring cuvette (OS119–004, Hellma, Müllheim, Germany), and 50 μm arsenazo III were added. Changes in the Ca2+ concentration were monitored as absorption difference between 652 and 700 nm in a dual wavelength spectrophotometer (Aminco DW-2000; SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL). Ca2+ calibration and determination of initial Ca2+ fluxes was carried out as described previously (30.Bauer P.J. Schauf H. Schwarzer A. Brown J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C558-C565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After biotinylation of ROS membranes (see above), the exchanger was purified in three consecutive chromatographic steps: by DEAE cellulose ion exchange, by AF red affinity, and by concanavalin A-Sepharose affinity chromatography, as described (29.Cook N.J. Hanke W. Kaupp U.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 585-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 31.Cook N.J. Kaupp U.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11382-11388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A Western blot of the cGMP-gated channel, purified as described above, was incubated for 16 h at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline (136 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 6.5 mmNa2HPO4, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 1% (w/v) nonfat milk and 0.02% Tween-20 in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated to purified biotinylated exchanger in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.02% Tween-20 for 1 h. After thorough washings, this blot was labeled either with streptavidin coupled to horseradish peroxidase or with antibodies against the exchanger or against α- or β-subunit of the channel. Streptavidin, but not the exchanger molecules, could be removed from the blot by the same procedure as the antibodies (i.e. by incubation for 45 min at 65 °C in 2% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 62 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8) thus allowing the same blot to be labeled several times (24.Schwarzer A. Kim T.S.Y. Hagen V. Molday R.S. Bauer P.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13667-13676Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis on a linear 3.5–7.5% gradient polyacrylamide gel and Western blotting were performed as described previously (24.Schwarzer A. Kim T.S.Y. Hagen V. Molday R.S. Bauer P.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13667-13676Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Protein content was determined following the Amido Black procedure (32.Kaplan R.S. Pedersen P.L. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) using filters of nitrocellulose 0.45-μm pore size (HATF, Millipore). Based on a Ca2+ flux study, we suggested in a previous report that the cGMP-gated channel and the Na/Ca-K exchanger are associated in the plasma membrane of rod photoreceptors (1.Bauer P.J. Drechsler M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 451: 109-131Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To examine this suggestion, we asked if under certain conditions this association persists after solubilization in detergent. If so, then we should expect that extraction of the channel by affinity chromatography would result in a selective enrichment of exchanger. In agreement with an earlier report (28.Hsu Y.-T. Molday R.S. Nature. 1993; 361: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), we found that cGMP-gated channels purified by CaM-agarose affinity chromatography contained virtually no exchanger if ROS membranes were solubilized in 18 mm CHAPS and 200 mm NaCl (not shown). However, a significant amount of exchanger was detected in the bound fraction of the CaM-agarose column if the detergent and the salt concentration were lowered to 10 mm CHAPS and 100 mm NaCl, as shown in Fig. 1. Although the nonbound protein fraction contained most of the exchanger and some channel protein, the bound channel was eluted together with a significant amount of exchanger (Fig. 1, lanes a and b). The fractions collected immediately before elution of the bound proteins (i.e. after a 15-ml wash period) did not contain any detectable amount of channel or exchanger (not shown). Even a second CaM affinity chromatography of the channel did not completely remove the exchanger (Fig. 1, lane d). Because highly purified exchanger did not bind on a CaM-agarose column (data not shown), this observation supports our hypothesis that the exchanger interacted with the channel protein. The presence of exchanger in cGMP-gated channel eluted from a CaM affinity column was also evident from Ca2+ flux studies. ROS membranes were solubilized in 10 or 15 mm CHAPS; the cGMP-gated channel was extracted by CaM affinity chromatography and reconstituted in the presence of Ca2+ into PC vesicles by dialysis to remove the detergent. If these vesicle preparations were assayed for Na+- and cGMP-induced Ca2+ fluxes, there was very little Na+-induced Ca2+ flux in vesicles prepared with channel, which was solubilized and eluted at 15 mm CHAPS (Fig. 2, curve a), but there was a substantial Na+-induced Ca2+ flux in vesicles prepared with channel that was solubilized and eluted at 10 mm CHAPS (Fig. 2, curve b); the cGMP-induced Ca2+ fluxes were similar in both preparations. To examine more directly if the cGMP-gated channel and Na/Ca-K exchanger are associated in the rod photoreceptor plasma membrane, chemical cross-linking of adjacent proteins was used. We used the novel cleavable dimaleimide reagent BMDB, which cross-links adjacent cysteines (24.Schwarzer A. Kim T.S.Y. Hagen V. Molday R.S. Bauer P.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13667-13676Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Fig.3 shows a Western blot of rod outer segment membranes upon cross-linking with the dimaleimide BMDB in the absence (lane c) and presence of 8-Br-cGMP (lane d); as a control, lanes a and b show the non-cross-linked membranes in the absence and presence of 8-Br-cGMP, respectively. The same Western blot has been consecutively labeled with antibodies against the α-subunit (B) and the β-subunit (C) of the channel and with antibodies against the Na/Ca-K exchanger (D). Between successive labelings, the antibodies had been removed from the blotting membrane, as described under “Materials and Methods.” If cross-linking with BMDB was carried out in the absence of 8-Br-cGMP, no cross-linking band of the α-subunit of the channel was labeled (Fig. 3 B, lane c). In contrast, the β-subunit of the channel was almost quantitatively cross-linked to other proteins (C, lane c). The numerous cross-linking bands of the β-subunit have not been analyzed in detail; however, these bands were not because of cross-links between the β-subunit and exchanger, because the exchanger cannot be cross-linked to the channel under these conditions (24.Schwarzer A. Kim T.S.Y. Hagen V. Molday R.S. Bauer P.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13667-13676Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These bands were also not because of cross-links between the β-subunit and the α-subunit of the cGMP-gated channel, as will be shown below. The weak band at about 105 kDa in Fig.3 C was presumably because of the β′-subunit, which is the β-subunit lacking the cytoplasmic glutamic acid-rich protein domain. The cross-linking bands of the exchanger at 490 and 420 kDa (D, lane c) have been thoroughly studied previously; the 490-kDa band was due to the homodimer of the exchanger, and the 420-kDa band was due to the cross-link of the exchanger with a 150-kDa exchanger fragment (24.Schwarzer A. Kim T.S.Y. Hagen V. Molday R.S. Bauer P.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13667-13676Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the presence of 8-Br-cGMP, a distinct cross-linking band of the α-subunit was visible at about 130 kDa, i.e. at about twice the molecular mass of the monomeric α-subunit (Fig.3 B, lane d; non-cross-linked control: lane b). On the other hand, the cross-linking band pattern of the β-subunit showed no obvious cGMP-dependent change (Fig.3 C, lanes c and d). In contrast, comparing the cross-linking bands of the exchanger obtained in the presence of 8-Br-cGMP with the cross-linking bands obtained in the absence of 8-Br-cGMP (i.e. lane d with cin D) revealed three additional bands in lane dcentered at about 330, 465, and 545 kDa (arrowheads). Although these additional cross-linking bands were weak, they were consistently found if cross-linking of ROS membranes had been carried out with dimaleimides in the presence of 8-Br-cGMP. This experiment suggested (a) that upon 8-Br-cGMP binding to the channel at least one cysteine of the channel became accessible to thiol-specific reagents, which was not accessible in the absence of 8-Br-cGMP and (b) that cross-links between the cGMP-gated channel and exchanger formed that were not labeled with the antibodies against the α- or β-subunits of the channel. Both suggestions will be investigated below. To examine the first presumption, the experiment was extended in the following way. Before cross-linking, the accessible cysteines were blocked with NEM either in the absence (Fig.4, lane b) or in the presence (Fig. 4, lane c) of 8-Br-cGMP. Then, excess reagent was thoroughly washed off, and the proteins were cross-linked with BMDB in the presence of 8-Br-cGMP. As a control, non-NEM-treated membranes were cross-linked with BMDB as well, both in the absence and presence of 8-Br-cGMP (lanes d and e, respectively). As expected, BMDB treatment of NEM-modified membranes did not yield any cross-linking bands of the β-subunit of the channel or of the exchanger; therefore, lanes b and c inC and D of Fig. 4 are indistinguishable from nontreated membranes (lane a), whereas cross-links were observed for membranes that had not been modified with NEM (Fig. 4,lanes d and e). Remarkably, the α-subunit of the channel could still be cross-linked with BMDB in the presence of 8-Br-cGMP if the membranes had been treated with NEM in the absence of 8-Br-cGMP (Fig. 4 B, lane b) but not if they had been treated with NEM in the presence of 8-Br-cGMP (Fig. 4 B,lane c). This finding indicates that 8-Br-cGMP binding leads to the exposure of at least one additional cysteine of the α-subunit but not of the β-subunit of the channel. The additional bands of the exchanger at 330, 465, and 545 kDa, which we observed in Western blots upon cross-linking with BMDB in the presence of 8-Br-cGMP, suggested that cross-links between channel and exchanger formed (see Fig. 3 D,lane d, and Fig. 4 D, lane e). However, no corresponding bands in one of the channel subunits were detected. Therefore, either the exchanger was cross-linked to some protein other than the channel or the affinity of the antibody against the channel subunit, which was covalently bound to the exchanger, was abolished after cross-linking. To discriminate between these two possibilities, the BMDB cross-links were cleaved in the polyacrylamide gel matrix, and the bands were analyzed by electrophoresis in a second polyacrylamide gel. Fig. 5 shows the electrophoretic analysis of BMDB-treated ROS membranes after cleavage of the cross-link bridges. ROS membranes were cross-linked with BMDB either in the absence (A and B) or presence of 8-Br-cGMP (Cand D) and electrophoresed on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel; the gel lanes were cut out, subjected to oxidative cleavage of the cross-linked proteins, and analyzed on a second polyacrylamide gel, as described (24.Schwarzer A. Kim T.S.Y. Hagen V. Molday R.S. Bauer P.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13667-13676Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The blots were labeled with the antibody PMc 2G11 against the α-subunit of the channel. If the ROS membrane proteins had been cross-linked with BMDB in the absence of 8-Br-cGMP, the Western blot of this two-dimensional electrophoresis yielded only a single spot at 63 kDa for the α-subunit of the channel (Fig.5 B). This finding corroborates our conclusion (see above) that in the absence of 8-Br-cGMP, BMDB does not yield any cross-link of the α-subunit of the channel; this means in particular that also no cross-link formed between the α- and the β-subunit of the channel. However, if cross-linking of ROS membranes was carried out in the presence of 8-Br-cGMP, there were several weak spots originating from the bands at 130, 330, 465, and 545 kDa of the first dimension electrophoresis gel in addition to the strong spot at 63 kDa (Fig.5 D). The 130-kDa spot indicated that the α-subunits of the channels were cross-linked to dimers. The positions of the latter three molecular masses were identical to the ones determined for the additional cross-linking bands of the exchanger (Fig. 3 D,lane d) thus strongly suggesting that these cross-links were because of cross-links between the exchanger and the channel α-subunit. It should be noted that during oxidative cleavage of the cross-links in the one-dimensional gel, some protein was unavoidably lost, particularly proteins with lower molecular mass. For this reason, the spots originating from cross-links of the α-subunit were rather weak in Fig. 5 D. This experiment has been repeated four times with similar results. Finally, we infer that the immunoreactivity of the channel α-subunit against the monoclonal antibody PMc 2G11 was lost upon cross-linking of this subunit to the exchanger because the spots at 330, 465, and 545 kDa of the α-subunit were only detected after cleavage of the cross-links. A complex between the channel and the exchanger was further examined by purification of the channel after chemical cross-linking. The ROS membranes were first cross-linked with BMDB in the presence of 8-Br-cGMP and then solubilized in CHAPS, and the channel was purified by CaM affinity chromatography (28.Hsu Y.-T. Molday R.S. Nature. 1993; 361: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows the solubilized ROS membrane proteins and the bound fraction eluted with 2 mm EDTA from the CaM column. A great amount of bound protein (11 μg) was applied on lane b of Fig. 6 to enable detection of the weak bands, too. It is apparent from the Western blots shown in Fig. 6 (B and C) that lane bnot only contained channel protein but also a significant amount of exchanger. The exchanger protein was labeled mainly in the additional bands at 330, 465, and 545 kDa, which were obtained upon cross-linking of the membranes in the presence of 8-Br-cGMP (Fig. 6 C,lane b). These bands were enriched, whereas the proteins of the strong bands of lane a at 250, 420, and 490 kDa were eluted in the nonbound fraction (not shown) and, therefore, almost completely absent in lane b. Moreover, although the α-subunit, the 130-kDa cross-link, and several other cross-linking bands between 63 and 150 kDa of the channel were labeled, none of the cGMP-dependent cross-linking bands of the exchanger were detected with the antibody PMc 2G11 against the α-subunit of the channel, again supporting our inference that the monoclonal antibody PMc 2G11 against the α-subunit does not recognize bands because of the cross-links between the α-subunit and the exchanger. In the following, we examined whether there is a direct interaction between the α-subunit of the channel and the exchanger. The cGMP-gated channel was purified by CaM affinity chromatography, and the subunits were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto a protein-immobilizing membrane. This blot was incubated with purified exchanger that had been biotinylated at the thiol groups. If probed with streptavidin horseradish peroxidase, this blot exhibited a distinct band at the location of the α-subunit of the channel (Fig.7, lane b) indicating a binding affinity of the exchanger to the α-subunit. The background was due to unspecific binding of the exchanger to the membrane; interestingly, there was significantly less background staining at the location of the β-subunit of the channel indicating that the exchanger did not bind to this subunit. As a control experiment, a second blot of the purified channel was prepared that had not been incubated in biotinylated exchanger; after streptavidin horseradish peroxidase treatment of this blot, no labeling could be detected in the enhanced chemiluminescence assay (not shown). The bound streptavidin (but not the exchanger) of the blot shown in Fig. 7, lane b, could be completely washed off under denaturing conditions, so that no labeling was detected anymore in the enhanced chemiluminescence assay (not shown). This blot was reprobed repeatedly with antibodies against the α-subunit (lane c) and the β-subunit (lane a) of the channel and with antibodies against the exchanger (lane d). Similar tolane b, lane d of Fig. 7 showed a distinct band at 63 kDa indicating again the binding of exchanger to the α-subunit of the channel. These findings were fully reproducible in five experiments. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the exchanger binds to the α-subunit but not to the β-subunit of the channel. Previously, we reported Ca2+ flux experiments that suggested that the cGMP-gated channel and Na/Ca-K exchanger were associated in the plasma membrane of bovine photoreceptors (1.Bauer P.J. Drechsler M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 451: 109-131Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is now strongly corroborated by the following biochemical findings reported in this study: (a) if purification of the channel by CaM affinity chromatography was carried out in 10 mm CHAPS, a significant fraction of exchanger was co-purified, which could not be fully removed by a second CaM affinity chromatography step; (b) channel and exchanger could be partially cross-linked with dimaleimides; (c) the cross-links between channel and exchanger were specific because these bands were only observed if cross-linking was performed in the presence of 8-Br-cGMP; and (d) when the subunits of the purified channel were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted, the exchanger bound preferentially to the α-subunit but not to the β-subunit of the channel. For the following reasons, thiol-specific cross-linking of channel and exchanger was likely to be specific. Both exchanger and channel constitute only a minor protein fraction of the plasma membrane of photoreceptors, the major protein being rhodopsin; on a molar basis, rhodopsin exceeds channel and exchanger by more than a factor of ten. Moreover, each rhodopsin molecule contains 10 cysteines, whereas the Na/Ca-K exchanger contains only 6 cysteines, the α-subunit of the channel contains 6 cysteines, and the β-subunit contains 15 cysteines. Therefore, if unspecific cross-linking occurred, one should expect to obtain also cross-links between rhodopsin and channel or cross-links between rhodopsin and exchanger. However, Western blots of cross-linked and purified exchanger and channel were not labeled with the monoclonal antibody, Rho 1D4, against rhodopsin (not shown). Thiol-specific cross-linking in the presence of 8-Br-cGMP resulted in three additional bands because of cross-links between channel and exchanger and in a cross-linking band, which indicate a dimer of the channel α-subunit. The cross-linking bands of the exchanger at 330, 465, and 545 kDa indicate cross-links of one α-subunit either to the exchanger monomer or to the cross-link between the 150-kDa exchanger fragment with the exchanger or to the exchanger dimer, respectively. Both, the multitude of possible cross-links and the reaction kinetics may be responsible for the low cross-linking efficiency. Although the cGMP-gated channel is composed of α- and β-subunits we did not observe a cross-link between these two channel subunits by thiol-specific cross-linking. Instead, the β-subunit yielded a huge number of cross-links, which were not because of covalent bonds of the β-subunit with the α-subunit or with the exchanger. We did not analyze these cross-links further; we infer that channel and exchanger were only part of a still larger supramolecular assembly. This presumption is strongly supported by a very recent study showing that in rod photoreceptors, glutamic acid-rich proteins interact with components of the cGMP-signaling pathway (33.Körschen H.G. Beyermann M. Müller F. Heck M. Vantler M. Koch K.-W. Kellner R. Wolfrum U. Bode C. Hofmann K.P. Kaupp U.B. Nature. 1999; 400: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the channel and exchanger retained some binding affinity even after solubilization in CHAPS, which depended on the detergent concentration. Interestingly, a similar dependence on the CHAPS concentration has been reported for the channel activity upon reconstitution in lipid vesicles (34.Cook N.J. Zeilinger C. Koch K.-W. Kaupp U.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 17033-17039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An indication of an interaction of channel and exchanger was also reported recently (35.Molday R.S. Molday L.L. Vision Res. 1998; 38: 1315-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Moreover, even after SDS denaturation and electrophoretic separation of the channel subunits, the exchanger bound clearly to the α-subunit but not to the β-subunit. The latter result fits nicely with the finding that the α-subunit but not the β-subunit of the channel could be cross-linked with the exchanger. Recently, we reported that in photoreceptor plasma membranes, the Na/Ca-K exchanger could be cross-linked as a dimer, but there was no indication for dimerization of the exchanger molecules upon solubilization in CHAPS or Triton X-100 (24.Schwarzer A. Kim T.S.Y. Hagen V. Molday R.S. Bauer P.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13667-13676Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Here, we show that (a) the exchanger bound to the α-subunit of the channel and (b) the α-subunits formed a dimer in the channel. Moreover, even after solubilization the binding affinity of the exchanger to the α-subunit of the channel was evident. These findings suggest that the close proximity of two exchanger molecules in the plasma membrane enabling thiol-specific linking to a homodimer was probably because of binding of two exchanger molecules to the α-subunit dimer of the channel rather than to a significant binding affinity between two exchanger molecules themselves. This consideration implies that all exchanger molecules were bound to the channel because the exchanger could be almost completely cross-linked by disulfide bridges (24.Schwarzer A. Kim T.S.Y. Hagen V. Molday R.S. Bauer P.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13667-13676Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) suggesting a molar ratio of exchanger to channel of 2:1. This inference is in general agreement with previous studies in which this ratio was reported to be about 1.5:1 (36.Reid D.M. Friedel U. Molday R.S. Cook N.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1601-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and 2:1 (1.Bauer P.J. Drechsler M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 451: 109-131Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The cGMP-gated channel was suggested to have a tetrameric structure (37.Liu D.T. Tibbs G.R. Siegelbaum S.A. Neuron. 1996; 16: 983-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar,38.Varnum M.D. Zagotta W.N. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2667-2679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) with the CaM binding site being localized on the β-subunit (39.Grunwald M.E., Yu, W.-P., Yu, H.-H. Yau K.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9148-9157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar,40.Weitz D. Zoche M. Müller F. Beyermann M. Körschen H.G. Kaupp U.B. Koch K.-W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2273-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Moreover, CaM binding was found to be slightly cooperative with a Hill coefficient of 1.3 (41.Bauer P.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 494: 675-685Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar) indicating that there are two β-subunits/channel. Taken together, the complex of exchanger and channel appears to have the structure x2α2β2, if x denotes one exchanger molecule, and α2β2, the subunit assembly of one channel molecule. The results reported here strongly support the hypothesis inferred from the previous study (1.Bauer P.J. Drechsler M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 451: 109-131Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar) that the cGMP-gated channel and exchanger are associated in rod outer segment plasma membranes. The close proximity of source and sink of the cytosolic Ca2+ in rod outer segments suggests that Ca2+ signaling may constitute a local process in photoreceptors. However, it should be stressed that Ca2+ influx into rod outer segment is a permanent process in the nonexcited photoreceptor. If the Ca2+ ions entering the rod outer segment should be kept in a microdomain near the channel, one should expect that (a) the kinetic parameters governing Ca2+ diffusion are consistent with such a mechanism and (b) the target molecules for the Ca2+ signaling pathway are close to the channel as well. The latter expectation is supported by a recent report (33.Körschen H.G. Beyermann M. Müller F. Heck M. Vantler M. Koch K.-W. Kellner R. Wolfrum U. Bode C. Hofmann K.P. Kaupp U.B. Nature. 1999; 400: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Further studies are required to examine if Ca2+ signaling in photoreceptors is in fact a local process. We thank Drs. J. E.

(1999) Exp. Cell Res. 247, 148–159). Nuclei isolated from mimosine-arrested HeLa cells initiate semiconservative DNA replication upon incubation in cytosolic extracts from proliferating human cells. Initiation occurs in the absence and presence of a nuclear membrane. The cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitors roscovitine and olomoucine inhibit initiation of DNA replication, indicating a dependence of initiation on Cdk activity. Cell fractionation shows that cyclins A, E, and Cdk2 are bound to nuclei from mimosine-arrested cells. Exogenously added human cyclin A·Cdk2 and cyclin E·Cdk2 complexes, but not cyclin B1/Cdk1 or cyclin D2/Cdk6, can overcome inhibition of initiation by roscovitine in vitro. Depleting Cdk2 from cytosolic extract does not prevent initiation, demonstrating that cyclin·Cdk2 complexes are not required in the soluble extract, but are provided by the nuclei. Initiation depends further on an essential and soluble activity present in cytosolic extracts from proliferating cells, but not from mimosine-arrested cells, acting together with nuclear cyclin/Cdk2 activity.

Once DNA replication has initiated, control mechanisms ensure that the entire genomic DNA is replicated precisely once, and after completion, one replicated genome segregates to each of the two daughter cells during mitosis (for reviews, see Refs.1.Laskey R.A.

Cell fusion experiments in mammalian somatic cells established that G1, but not G2 phase nuclei, initiate DNA replication prematurely when exposed to an S phase cytosolic environment (7.Rao P.N. Johnson R.T. Nature. 1970; 225: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Key regulators of initiation were identified in genetic and cytological experiments in vivo. Roles for cyclin-dependent protein kinases (Cdks)1 and their G1 and S phase-specific regulatory subunits cyclin D, E, and A in inducing DNA replication have been documented (8.Girard F. Strausfeld U.

The analysis of initiation of DNA replication in vivo was recently complemented by a biochemical approach through the establishment of cell-free systems from human and mammalian cells (17.Krude T. Jackman M. Pines J. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1997; 88: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 18.Stoeber K. Mills A.D. Kubota Y. Marheineke K. Krude T. Romanowski P.

Biol. 1998; 10: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). DNA replication is initiated in nuclei isolated from human G1, but not G2 phase cells when incubated in S phase cytosolic extract and S phase-specific nuclear factors. A nuclear extract could be substituted by purified recombinant cyclins A and E, complexed to their kinase partner Cdk2, to initiate DNA replication, directly demonstrating functional roles for these nuclear cyclin·Cdk complexes (17.Krude T. Jackman M. Pines J. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1997; 88: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). These cyclin/Cdks were essential, but not sufficient, as nuclei also required soluble factors present in a cytosolic extract from S phase cells to initiate replication (17.Krude T. Jackman M. Pines J. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1997; 88: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). For an assembly of replication-competent chromatin in eukaryotic G1 phase nuclei, an evolutionarily conserved series of molecular events is required involving the origin-recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6 protein, and the mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins (reviewed in Refs. 2.Romanowski P. Madine M.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 184-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 3.Romanowski P.

Chem. 1997; 272: 23637-23644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In mammalian cell-free systems, competence to initiate DNA replication in S phase cytosol is observed when template nuclei are prepared from late G1 phase cells after release from a block either in mitosis (17.Krude T. Jackman M. Pines J. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1997; 88: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) or quiescence (18.Stoeber K. Mills A.D. Kubota Y. Marheineke K. Krude T. Romanowski P. Laskey R.A. Williams G.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7219-7229Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), followed by transit through early G1 phase in vivo. Upon release from quiescence, competence of G1phase nuclei to initiate in vitro coincides with maximum expression of Cdc6 protein, and addition of recombinant Cdc6 protein advances the onset of replication competence in vitro (18.Stoeber K. Mills A.D. Kubota Y. Marheineke K. Krude T. Romanowski P. Laskey R.A. Williams G.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7219-7229Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, human cells undergoing mitotic proliferation contain Cdc6 protein at all stages of the cell cycle (22.Saha P. Chen J. Thome K.C. Lawlis S.J. Hou Z.H. Hendricks M. Parvin J.D. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2758-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 23.Jiang W. Wells N.J. Hunter T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 396-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and the state of DNA replication competence therefore depends on other factors as well. Late G1 phase nuclei from cells synchronized by release from either mitosis or quiescence are relatively undefined heterogeneous and dynamic populations as a result of cells passing the state of competence at the time of preparation (17.Krude T. Jackman M. Pines J. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1997; 88: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 18.Stoeber K. Mills A.D. Kubota Y. Marheineke K. Krude T. Romanowski P. Laskey R.A. Williams G.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7219-7229Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A significant step toward molecular and temporal dissection of the establishment of DNA replication forks in human somatic cells would therefore be the availability of defined populations of homogeneous template nuclei reversibly arrested in a state of replication initiation competence. A recently established cell-free system for the initiation of nuclear DNA replication in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae made use of cells reversibly synchronized at defined points in the cell division cycle (25.Pasero P. Braguglia D. Gasser S.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1504-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Template nuclei from yeast mutants blocked at defined points in late G1 phase initiated DNA replication at high percentages upon incubation in S phase nuclear extracts (25.Pasero P. Braguglia D. Gasser S.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1504-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Because such cell cycle mutants are currently not available as synchronization tools for human cells, I sought to achieve analogous arrest of human cells in late G1 phase by chemical synchronization. The plant amino acid mimosine is a versatile agent for blocking DNA replication in proliferating eukaryotic somatic cells but the literature on its mode of action is controversial. Depending on cell type and concentration of mimosine, evidence for blocking both initiation and elongation steps of DNA replication has been reported (26.Lalande M. Exp. Cell. Res. 1990; 186: 332-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 27.Watson P.A. Hanauske-Abel H.H. Flint A. Lalande M.

In the case of human cultured cells, however, this controversy has been clarified because the different effects of mimosine depend on its concentration in the cell culture medium during treatment (34.Krude T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 148-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). At concentrations below 0.5 mm, mimosine interferes with elongation steps of DNA replication, and treatment results in populations of cells enriched in S phase after establishment of replication forks (34.Krude T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 148-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In contrast, at concentrations of 0.5 mm and above, mimosine additionally prevents entry into S phase, resulting in a population of cells arrested in late G1 phase, before establishment of active DNA replication forks in vivo (34.Krude T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 148-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Importantly, the late G1phase arrest in vivo is fully reversible and cells enter S phase upon removal of mimosine (27.Watson P.A. Hanauske-Abel H.H. Flint A. Lalande M. Cytometry. 1991; 12: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 34.Krude T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 148-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In this paper, I characterize the ability of nuclei from mimosine-arrested human cells to initiate DNA replication in human cell extracts. Nuclei prepared from these cells efficiently initiate semiconservative DNA replication upon incubation in cytosolic extracts from proliferating cells, even in the absence of a nuclear membrane. Initiation depends on a cytosolic extract from proliferating cells and, furthermore, on cyclin E/Cdk2 and/or cyclin A/Cdk2 activity which are present in the nuclei from mimosine-arrested cells. The data suggest that the competence of nuclei from mimosine-arrested cells to initiate replication is characterized by the presence of the cell cycle-regulated cyclin/Cdk2 proteins in cis and initiation is triggered by a different activity in trans. HeLa-S3 cells were cultured as monolayers and synchronized in G1, S, and G2 phase exactly as described (17.Krude T. Jackman M. Pines J. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1997; 88: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Synchronization in mitosis was performed as described (35.Marheineke K. Krude T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15279-15286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Cells were arrested in late G1 phase by adding 0.5 mm mimosine (Sigma) from a 10 mm stock solution to proliferating cells for 24 h (34.Krude T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 148-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Cell synchronization in interphase was determined by flow cytometry of isolated nuclei. One million nuclei were directly stained with propidium iodide (5 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.4% Triton X-100) and analyzed by FACScan (Becton Dickinson) using the Lysis II-software. Data are presented as histograms showing relative DNA content (x axis) and cell number (yaxis). Nuclei from mimosine-arrested cells were prepared by hypotonic treatment, followed by Dounce homogenization and centrifugation exactly as described (34.Krude T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 148-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Concentrations of nuclei were determined with a hemocytometer. Nuclei were stored at −80 °C for up to 3 months without loss of DNA replication competence. For permeabilization, nuclei were incubated in 0.1% Triton X-100 in SuNaSpBSA (250 mm sucrose, 75 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm spermine trihydrochloride, 0.15 mm spermidine tetrahydrochloride, 3% bovine serum albumin) at 4 °C in a rotator for 20 min and washed two times in SuNaSpBSA without Triton X-100. Cytosolic and nuclear extracts from asynchronously proliferating and synchronized cells were prepared exactly as described (17.Krude T. Jackman M. Pines J. Laskey R.A.

Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad Protein assay using bovine serum albumin as standard. Cytosolic extracts were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored up to 4 months at −80 °C without loss of replication initiation activity. DNA replication initiation reactions (17.Krude T. Jackman M. Pines J. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1997; 88: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) contained the following components: HeLa cell cytosolic extract (100 μg of protein, unless indicated otherwise); a buffered mixture of rNTPs and dNTPs including either biotin-16-dUTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or [α-32P]dATP as tracers (17.Krude T. Jackman M. Pines J. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1997; 88: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar); and 2–5 × 105 nuclei from mimosine-arrested HeLa cells (34.Krude T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 148-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The final reaction volume of 50 μl was adjusted with replication buffer (20 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.8, 100 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol). Where indicated, reactions were also supplemented with S phase nuclear extract (50 μg of protein). Incubation time was 3 h, unless indicated otherwise. The Cdk-inhibitors roscovitine and olomoucine (both Calbiochem) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at 50 mm. When used, they were added to replication reactions at the final concentrations specified in the figure legends. Control reactions contained an equivalent volume of dimethyl sulfoxide. Recombinant cyclin A/Cdk2 and cyclin E/Cdk2 were prepared from SF9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus expression vectors (gifts of W. Krek, Friederich-Miescher-Institute, Basel). Purified human cyclin B1/Cdc2 was a gift of M. Jackman (Wellcome/CRC Institute, Cambridge) and cyclin D2/Cdk6 a gift of E. Laue and W. Zhang (Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge). For analysis by confocal fluorescence microscopy, nuclei were fixed and spun onto coverslips.

Immunoblots of cytosolic and nuclear extracts from HeLa cells were performed essentially as described (35.Marheineke K. Krude T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15279-15286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The following primary antibodies against human proteins were used: anti-Cdk1, anti-cyclin A, and anti-cyclin B1 (all gifts from J.

Immunoprecipitation of cyclin E from human cell extracts was performed with polyclonal antibody sc-198 (Santa Cruz) from a total of 150 μg of extract protein diluted in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (36.Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitate was washed in phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently analyzed by Western blotting using monoclonal antibody HE12. Sepharose beads coupled to human p9Cks1 protein (37.Pines J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1399-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) (a gift of M. Jackman, Wellcome/CRC Institute, Cambridge) were equilibrated and washed three times in replication buffer and concentrated by gravity sedimentation. Depletion of interphase cytosol was achieved by three successive rounds of (i) adding a fifth volume of the p9Cks1 beads, (ii) incubating the slurry for 20 min at 4 °C in a rotator, and (iii) removal of the beads by pelleting at 13,000 rpm in an Eppendorf 5415C centrifuge for 5 min. Mock depletions were performed in parallel in the absence of p9Cks1-Sepharose. Asynchronously proliferating human cells arrest in late G1 phase when a 0.5 mm concentration of the plant amino acid mimosine is added to the culture medium for 24 h (34.Krude T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 148-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Removal of mimosine from the culture medium in vivoresults in a synchronous entry into S phase in about 50–70% of the cells (27.Watson P.A. Hanauske-Abel H.H. Flint A. Lalande M. Cytometry. 1991; 12: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 34.Krude T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 148-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Our previous work has established that a proportion of late G1 phase nuclei prepared from cells released either from mitosis (17.Krude T. Jackman M. Pines J. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1997; 88: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) or quiescence (18.Stoeber K. Mills A.D. Kubota Y. Marheineke K. Krude T. Romanowski P. Laskey R.A. Williams G.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7219-7229Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) can serve as templates for initiation of DNA replication upon incubation in human S phase extracts. Therefore, I investigated whether the mimosine-dependent reversible arrest point of human cells before entry into S phase could be exploited for a preparation of more homogeneous populations of competent and defined template nuclei for efficient initiation of DNA replication in vitro. Nuclei were isolated from mimosine-arrested human cells and used as templates for DNA replication reactions in vitro (Fig.1). DNA synthesis was detected by incorporation of biotin-dUTP into genomic DNA and confocal fluorescence microscopy. Incubation of nuclei from mimosine-arrested cells in elongation buffer resulted in about 10% of the nuclei incorporating biotin-dUTP in vitro (Fig. 1 A). These nuclei represent a small proportion of contaminating true S phase nuclei present in the preparation that continue semiconservative DNA replication at sites established prior to preparation in vivo (34.Krude T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 148-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In contrast, addition of S phase cytosol to the reaction supported DNA synthesis in about 50–55% of the nuclei (Fig.1 B). Because 10% of the nuclei had initiated DNA replication in vivo before preparation (cf. Fig.1 A and Ref. 34.Krude T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 148-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), this result demonstrates that S phase cytosol triggers initiation in about of 40–45% of the nuclei that had been arrested by mimosine before establishment of DNA replication forksin vivo. The percentage of nuclei synthesizing genomic DNA depended on the amount of S phase cytosolic protein added and reached saturation at 100 μg (Fig. 1 C, columns 2, 5, and6). Addition of nuclear extract from S phase cells also increased the percentage of nuclei synthesizing DNA (Fig. 1 C, column 3). Addition of subsaturating amounts of both extracts together increased the percentage of nuclei synthesizing DNA in vitro in an additive fashion (Fig. 1 C, column 4). The maximum percentage of nuclei initiating DNA synthesis in vitro was about 60 in most preparations, over and above the contaminating proportion of S phase nuclei, corresponding to the percentage of cells entering S phase in vivo upon removal of mimosine. The fluorescent signal of DNA synthesis in nuclei from mimosine-arrested cells was not homogeneous within the nuclei (Fig.1 B). Replicating nuclei were therefore analyzed by confocal microscopy at higher magnification (Fig. 1, D-F). Against the background staining of nuclear DNA (Fig. 1, D andF, red signal), a clear pattern of many very small discrete intranuclear sites of DNA synthesis was detected (Fig. 1, Eand F, green signal). This pattern resembles the small replication foci found in very early S phase, which are located in the euchromatic regions of the nucleus (Fig. 1 F; see Refs.38.Nakayasu H. Berezney R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 39.Hozak P. Jackson D.A. Cook P.R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2191-2202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Krude T. Musahl C. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 309-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, for reference). These data suggest that nuclei from mimosine-arrested cells initiate DNA synthesis in S phase extractsin vitro at sites used in early S phase in vivo. In other eukaryotic DNA replication initiation systems, access of soluble initiation factors to the genomic DNA is regulated by the integrity of the nuclear membrane (1.Laskey R.A. Gorlich D. Madine M.A. Makkerh J.P.S. Romanowski P. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 18.Stoeber K. Mills A.D. Kubota Y. Marheineke K. Krude T. Romanowski P. Laskey R.A. Williams G.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7219-7229Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Therefore, I asked next whether removal of the nuclear membrane influences initiation of DNA synthesis in this system. Nuclei from mimosine-arrested HeLa cells were treated with 0.1% of the non-ionic detergent Triton X-100 to remove the nuclear membrane and used as templates for DNA replication in S phase cytosolic extracts (Fig. 2). Nuclear membrane permeability was measured by exclusion of fluorescent dextran. About 90% of the template nuclei were permeable, and remained permeable during the replication reaction in vitro (Fig.2 A). In comparison, without detergent treatment, typically 5–30% of the nuclei were permeable in a standard preparation by Dounce homogenization (data not shown). Importantly, about 40% of the permeable nuclei initiated DNA synthesis upon addition of S phase cytosol (Fig. 2 B), which is the same percentage as compared with untreated nuclei (cf. Fig. 1 C). Therefore, access of soluble initiation activity from S phase cytosolic extract to nuclei of mimosine-arrested cells is not influenced by the presence or absence of an intact nuclear membrane. These data establish that the terminal stages of initiation of human DNA synthesis in vitro as observed in nuclei from mimosine-arrested cells do not require the integrity of the nuclear membrane, consistent with observations made in extracts from Xenopus eggs (41.Walter J. Sun L. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). These data so far do not allow a distinction between initiation of semiconservative DNA replication or DNA repair synthesis in vitro. Therefore, initiation of DNA synthesis was analyzed by density substitution (Fig. 3). Nuclei from mimosine-arrested cells synthesized only background amounts of DNA upon incubation in elongation buffer (34.Krude T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 148-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), migrating between hemi- and unsubstituted densities (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, incubation in S phase cytosol resulted in the synthesis of hemisubstituted DNA products (Fig. 3 B). During this 2-h incubation in S phase cytosol, about 65 pmol of dNMP were incorporated into 105replicating nuclei (data not shown), indicating that about 4–5% of the genomic DNA was replicated. These data directly demonstrate that semiconservative DNA replication is initiated in mimosine-arrested nuclei by a soluble activity present in cytosolic S phase extract. These data raise the possibility that this soluble initiation activity is inhibited by 0.5 mm mimosine in vivo, causing cell-cycle arrest before onset of S phase (34.Krude T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 148-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and allowing efficient initiation of DNA replication in isolated nuclei upon incubation in S phase extracts. In the next experiments, I therefore characterized the competence of cytosolic extracts from mimosine-arrested cells to allow DNA replication in vitro. First, S phase nuclei were used as control templates for elongation of DNA replication in vitro(Fig. 4 A). As demonstrated before (34.Krude T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 148-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), S phase nuclei elongate DNA replication at pre-existing replication forks in either elongation buffer or in S phase cytosol (Fig. 4 A, white and black columns). Cytosolic extract from mimosine-arrested cells allowed elongation in the same percentage of S phase nuclei (Fig. 4 A, gray column), following the same incorporation kinetics as in S phase cytosol (data not shown). Density substitution confirmed synthesis of hemisubstituted DNA products in all of these three incubations (data not shown). These results demonstrate that cytosol from mimosine-arrested cells efficiently allows elongation of semiconservative DNA replication at established active replication forks in vitro. In contrast, cytosol from mimosine-arrested cells allowed initiation of DNA replication only in 15–20% of the nuclei from mim"

Chitin, a linear homopolymer of β-1,4-linkedN-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues, is a relatively minor component, representing only 1–2% of the dry weight of the wall of vegetative cells (1.Shaw J.A.P.C. Mol Bowers B. Silverman S.J. Valdivieso M.H. Duran A. Cabib E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of mannoprotein polysaccharides is well established; it initiates in the ER1 and continues in the Golgi with the transfer of additional mannose units (2.Orlean P. Cell Cycle Cell Biol. 1997; 3: 229-362Google Scholar). β-Glucan synthesis is believed to take place along the secretory pathway in the ER and Golgi compartments and in the plasma membrane (3.Cid V.J.

Cell. 1996; 7: 1907-1919Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 7.Ziman M. Chuang J.S. Tsung M. Hamamoto S. Schekman R. Mol. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 75-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), although the enzymatic synthesis of chitin has been studied extensively (9.Cabib E. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1987; 59: 59-101PubMed Google Scholar). Chitin synthesis requires the activities of several different chitin synthases and many different genes for the control of these enzymes (10.Bulawa C.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiology. 1993; 47: 505-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae possesses three chitin synthases. Chitin synthases I and II (CSI and CSII), the products of the CHS1and CHS2, are closely related proteins and require partial proteolysis for their activity in vitro. In contrast, chitin synthase III (CSIII), the product of CHS3 (recently renamed from CAL1/CSD2/DIT101/KTI2; Ref. 3.Cid V.J. Duran A. Del Rey F. Snyder M.P. Nombela C. Sanchez M. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 345-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is active without proteolytic treatment and is presumed to be the catalytic subunit of a complex containing the CHS4 (CAL2/CSD4) andCHS5 (CAL3) gene products, which are believed to play regulatory roles (10.Bulawa C.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiology. 1993; 47: 505-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 11.Bulawa C.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1764-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 12.Roncero C. Valdivieso M.H. Ribas J.C. Duran A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1950-1954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The three chitin synthases have unique functions. CSI and CSII make only a small portion (<10%) of the total chitin, whereas CSIII is responsible for the remainder (>90%). Hydropathy analysis of the Chs1p, Chs2p, and Chs3p sequences reveals the presence of putative multimembrane-spanning domains in each polypeptide (11.Bulawa C.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1764-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 13.Bulawa C.E. Slater M. Cabib E. Au-young J. Sburlati A. Adair Jr., W.L. Robbins P.W.

This is consistent with the idea that chitin synthases polymerize and extrude chitin chains across the plasma membrane using an intracellular source of the UDP-GlcNAc. Previous reports on chitin synthesis and the distribution of chitin synthases demonstrated the existence of chitosomes that are distinct from the plasma membrane, vacuole, and mature secretory vesicles (15.Flores Martinez A. Schwencke J. Bichem. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 946: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 16.Leal-Morales C.A. Bracker C.E. Bartnicki-Garcia S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8516-8520Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It is still not clear, however, whether the chitosome is the sole reservoir of chitin synthases (6.Ziman M. Chuang J.S. Schekman R.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1907-1919Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Previous reports on chitin synthase assays suggest the importance of growth phase on the regulation of chitin synthesis, where all three synthase activities can be detected in the cell lysates from the exponentially growing cells, and only CSI is detectable in lysates from stationary phase cells. These data suggest that the synthesis and/or turnover of CSII and CSIII are cell cycle-regulated (17.Orlean P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5732-5739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Sburlali A. Cabib E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15147-15152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report we describe the identification and characterization of a UDP-GlcNAc transporter that is required for chitin synthesis in S. cerevisiae. This study was motivated by a glycotechnology research project aimed at manipulating the protein glycosylation system of S. cerevisiae to produce mammalian-type oligosaccharides. We previously reported the production of human-compatible high mannose type Man5GlcNAc2 sugar chains (19.Chiba Y. Suzuki M. Yoshida S. Yoshida A. Ikennaga H. Takeuchi M. Jigami Y. Ichishima E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26298-26304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and the expression of rat UDP-GlcNAc:α-3-d-mannose β-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminnyltransferase I (20.Yoshida S. Suzuki M. Yamano S. Takeuchi M. Ikenaga H. Kioka N. Sakai H. Komano T. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). As a next step, we wished to evaluate the role of a UDP-GlcNAc transporter in our system toward in vivo GlcNAc addition as we had previously done for a UDP-Gal transporter toward in vivo galactose addition (21.Roy S.K. Yoko-o T. Ikenaga H. Jigami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2583-2590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar,22.Kainuma M. Ishida N. Yoko-o T. Yoshioka S. Takeuchi M. Kawakita M. Jigami Y. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The cloning of a Golgi UDP-GlcNAc transporter gene fromKluyveromyces lactis (23.Abeijon C. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5963-5972Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) revealed the existence of a homologue in S. cerevisiae with 40% identity and 70% similarity between their predicted amino acid sequences. The presence of such a gene in S. cerevisiae is unexpected because the sugar chains produced by this yeast lack terminal GlcNAc residues. Here we report that the S. cerevisiae ORF namedYEA4 (GenBank™ accession no. U18530) is a functional gene that encodes a UDP-GlcNAc transporter localized in the ER. We have both deleted and overexpressed the gene to analyze its in vivofunction. Measurements of sugar nucleotide transport activity in membrane vesicles prepared from wild type, null mutant, and overexpressed cells confirm its specificity for UDP-GlcNAc. FITC-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and Calcofluor white (CFW) staining show reduced amounts of cell surface chitin in cells deleted for YEA4. These data support the notion that Yea4p is involved in cell wall chitin synthesis through its UDP-GlcNAc transport activity localized in the ER membrane. Materials were obtained as follows: UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal), GDP-mannose (GDP-Man), UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc), chitinase (Serratia marcescens), and cytohelicase (Helix pomatia) were from Sigma. UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (45 Ci/mmol), UDP-[14C]GlcNAc (200 mCi/mmol), GDP-[14C]Man (251 mCi/mmol), and UDP-[3H]Glc (17.5 Ci/mmol) were from NEN Life Science Products.

The oligonucleotide primers were: 5′-CCCGAGCTCAAAAAAATGTGGAACTCACTAAAAGC-3′ and 5′-CATGCGGCCGCCTTTACTTTTCTTTATCGC-3′ (single and double underlines indicate SalI and NotI sites, respectively). PCR was carried out using 2.0 μmprimers and 10 ng of genomic DNA of S. cerevisiae strain YPH500 as a template in a 50-μl reaction mixture containingPwo polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The reactions were performed with 30 cycles of: 98 °C for 20 s, 54 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. The YEA4 PCR product was subcloned into pCR-Script Amp SK(+) (Stratagene). The entire YEA4 sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. For the preparation of HA epitope-tagged Yea4 protein, two complementary 162-mer oligonucletides that encode the sequences for a triple HA epitope tag and multiple cloning sites were synthesized by Nihon Seifun Co. Ltd. (Atsugi, Japan). The oligonucleotides were annealed and inserted between the BamHI and EcoRI sites of expression vector pYEX-BX (Amrad, Victoria, Australia), which directs gene expression under the CUP1 promoter, resulting in the 3xHA vector pYEX-3HA. pYEX-3HA was digested with SacI andNotI, and the YEA4 fragment cut withSacI and NotI was inserted to create plasmid pYEA4, which was used for the transformation of YPH500 yeast strain. Yeast harboring pYEA4 were cultured to an A 600of 1.0, and then copper sulfate was added to a final concentration of 1.0 mm. The cells were cultured for an additional 1 h and harvested. A precise deletion of YEA4coding sequences (Δyea4) was created by PCR-mediated one-step gene replacement with the selectable marker His3MX6 (his5 + of Schizosaccharomyces pombe) according to Longtine et al. (25.Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. DeMarini D.J. Shah N.G. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar).

Gene replacement was verified by genomic PCR using primers 5′-GGGAAGCTTGGGATGCAAGGGGAGGTAAGCCCTTTAACT-3′ and 5′-GGGAAGCTTATACACAGAGAAAACACAAAGATTGTTAGT-3′. The topology and integrity of the subcellular membrane vesicles was determined by measuring GDPase activity (5.Castro O. Chen L.Y. Parodi A.J. Abeijon C. Mol. Biol.

Briefly, incubation mixture in a final volume of 0.1 ml contained enzyme (20 μg of P3 fraction; see “Subcellular Fractionation”), CaCl2 (1 μmol), with or without Triton X-100 (100 μg), GDP (0.2 μmol) and immidazole buffer, pH 7.6 (20 μmol). Incubation was for 5 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of 10% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Released inorganic phosphate was determined by the Ames method (26.Ames B.N.

The absorbance was measured at 820 nm, and the amount of inorganic phosphate released was calculated from a calibration curve using KH2PO4 as a standard. Latency of GDPase was calculated according to Castro et al. (5.Castro O. Chen L.Y. Parodi A.J. Abeijon C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1019-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured with the BCA reagent (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Subcellular fractionation was done as described previously (21.Roy S.K. Yoko-o T. Ikenaga H.

Briefly, cells were grown at 30 °C in an appropriate medium to anA 600 of 3.0–3.5. The cells were washed with 10 mm NaN3 and resuspended in the spheroplast buffer (1.4 m sorbitol, 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaN3, 40 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and Zymolyase 100T, 1 mg/g wet cells). The cell suspension was incubated at 37 °C for 45 min with occasional gentle mixing. Spheroplasts were pelleted in a tabletop centrifuge (Beckman, GS 6KR) and washed twice with 1.0 mice-cold sorbitol to remove Zymolyase. The cells were then suspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.8 m sorbitol in 10 mmtriethanolamine, pH 7.2, and antiprotease mixture) and transferred to a 50-ml Dounce homogenizer (Wheaton Scientific, Millville, NJ) on ice and lysed with 20 strokes of a Teflon pestle. Low speed centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min yielded a large pellet (P1) containing unlysed cells and cell wall debris. The post 1,000 ×g supernatant (S1) was carefully collected and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C (Hitachi, Himac SCR20B, Japan), which yielded the P2 pellet and the S2 supernatant. The S2 fraction was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g (Beckman ultracentrifuge L-80 Optima, in 70.1 Ti rotor), yielding the P3 pellet and the S3 supernatant. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was conducted under reducing conditions, as described previously (27.Roy S.K. Dey S.K. Raha S.K. Chakrabarty S.L. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 1967-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Gels were run in the presence of prestained SDS-PAGE standards (Bio-Rad). Different subcellular fractions of whole cell lysate (30–150 μg of protein) were analyzed by Western blot analysis. Samples were incubated on ice for 10 min, and then trichloroacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 5% (v/v). Upon another 15-min incubation on ice, the mixture was centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min. The precipitate was washed vigorously with 1.0 ml of ice-cold acetone and centrifuged for 3 min. The washed pellet was dissolved in Laemmli's sample buffer (28.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar) and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gels (10%), followed by electroblotting of proteins onto 0.45-μm nitrocellulose paper (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and detection performed according to the method of Nakayama et al. (29.Nakayama K. Nagasu T. Shimma Y. Kuromitsu J. Jigami Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2511-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000) and anti-mouse IgG (1:1000) secondary antibodies were detected by nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sugar nucleotide transport was assayed as described previously (21.Roy S.K. Yoko-o T. Ikenaga H. Jigami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2583-2590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Different subcellular fractions (P2 and P3, 500 μg of protein) were incubated in 100 μl of reaction mixture (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.25 m sucrose, 5.0 mmMgCl2, 1.0 mm MnCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) with radiolabeled sugar nucleotides (as indicated in the figure legends). After incubation at 30 °C for 5 min, the samples were diluted with 3.0 ml of ice-cold stop buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.25 m sucrose, 150 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2) and placed on ice. Diluted samples were then applied onto a filtration apparatus (HA filters, 24-mm diameter, 0.45-μm pore size). The filters were washed with another 10 ml of ice-cold stop buffer. The filters were air-dried and placed in 15-ml counting vials, and 2.0 ml of ethylene glycol methyl ether was added. The vials were allowed to stand at room temperature with occasional shaking until the filters dissolved (about 30 min). Ten milliliters of scintillation mixture (Clear-sol) were added, and the samples were counted in a liquid scintillation counter (LS1701; Beckman, Fullerton, CA). The amount of radioactivity bound nonspecifically to the outside of the vesicles was determined by a time 0 assay for each sample. Preparation of cells for immunofluorescence was essentially as described by Pringle et al. (30.Pringle J.R. Adems A.E.M. Drubin D.G. Haarer B.K. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 565-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in YPD to mid-logarithmic phase (A 600 = 0.5–1.0) and fixed by addition of 37% (v/v) formaldehyde to 5% (v/v). The cultures were gently shaken at 25 °C for 20 min before centrifugation, and cells were resuspended in 5% formaldehyde buffered with 100 mmKH2PO4, 0.5 mm MgCl2(final pH 6.5) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The fixed cells were washed twice with SP (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1.0 m sorbitol), resuspended in SP-2ME (SP, 0.2% 2-mercaptoethanol, 15 mg/ml Zymolyase 100T) and converted to spheroplasts by incubating at 37 °C for 30 min. Spheroplasts were washed twice in SP and resuspended in SP with 0.1% Triton X-100, incubated for 10 min at room temperature, immediately centrifuged, and washed twice with SP. Fixed spheroplasts were attached to the polylysine-coated slides and blocked in BB (phosphate-buffered saline with 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.02% NaN3). Mouse anti-HA mAb (BAbCo, Berkeley, CA) was used at a 1:500 dilution. Rabbit anti-Anp1p (a generous gift from Sean Munro) was affinity-purified by pre-absorbing with total lysate prepared fromΔanp1::LEU2 cells and used at a 1:1000 dilution. Rabbit anti-Wbp1p (a generous gift from Stephan te Heesen) was used at a 1: 500 dilution. Alexa 488 goat anti-mouse and Alexa 568 goat anti-rabbit (Molecular Probe, Inc., OR) IgGs were used at 1:250 dilution as secondary antibodies. DNA was stained with 25 ng/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (in water) and examined with an Olympus BX-FLA fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Images were captured with a MicroMAX CCD camera system (Roper). Drug sensitivities were tested on fresh cultures by suspending a small number of cells (∼106 cells/ml) in sterile water and dropping 5–10 μl of suspension on different plates. YPD plates were supplemented with Calcofluor white (20 μg/ml), vanadate (2 mm), or neomycin (5 mm). For the quantitative measurement of chitin, the amount of GlcNAc released by chitinase was measured by a colorimetric method (13.Bulawa C.E. Slater M. Cabib E. Au-young J. Sburlati A. Adair Jr., W.L. Robbins P.W. Cell. 1986; 46: 213-225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Washed cells (350–400 mg wet weight) were suspended in 4.0 ml of 6% KOH and heated at 80°C for 90 min to remove the mannan layer of the cell wall. After the alkali treatment, 400 μl of glacial acetic acid was added; then, insoluble material was isolated by centrifugation, washed twice with water, and resuspended in 1.0 ml of 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.3). Chitinase from Serratia marcescens (Sigma) was added (0.4 unit), and the tubes were incubated at 30°C for 90 min. After centrifugation, 400 μl of the supernatant was treated with 50 μl of cytohelicase (Sigma) and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. A 100-μl aliquot of each sample was removed and assayed forN-acetylglucosamine by measuring A 585(31.Reissig J.L. Strominger J.L. Leloir L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 959-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). According to current dogma, there is no physiological need for S. cerevisiae cells to possess a UDP-GlcNAc transporter; S. cerevisiae cells lack the terminal GlcNAc residues in their sugar chains (2.Orlean P. Cell Cycle Cell Biol. 1997; 3: 229-362Google Scholar). However, we have recently reported the presence of UDP-Gal transport activity inS. cerevisiae (21.Roy S.K. Yoko-o T. Ikenaga H. Jigami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2583-2590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), an unexpected finding given thatS. cerevisiae cells do not add galactose to theirN- and O-linked oligosaccharides (2.Orlean P. Cell Cycle Cell Biol. 1997; 3: 229-362Google Scholar). This finding stimulated us to search for an S. cerevisiae protein homologous to known UDP-GlcNAc transporters. We found that the predicted YEA4 gene product shows 40–60% amino acid similarity to the K. lactis UDP-GlcNAc transporter, encoded by the K. lactis MNN2–2 gene (Fig.1). To test whether the YEA4gene product has UDP-GlcNAc transport activity, we overexpressed the gene and assayed the effects on cellular UDP-GlcNAc transport activity. The S. cerevisiae YEA4 gene potentially encodes a UDP-GlcNAc transporter homologue. We overexpressed the gene in yeast to analyze its protein function. An expression vector carryingYEA4 under the control of the CUP1 promoter (pYEA4) and the vector alone (pYEX-BX) were introduced into YPH500 cells (Table I). Three copies of the influenza HA epitope were inserted at a position corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of Yea4p for protein surveillance (Fig.2 A). To investigate the intracellular localization of Yea4–3xHAp, a subcellular fractionation experiment was performed according to the procedure described previously (21.Roy S.K. Yoko-o T. Ikenaga H. Jigami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2583-2590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Different subcellular fractions, P2 (10,000 × g pellet) and P3 (100,000 ×g pellet), were analyzed by Western blot. The results indicate that Yea4–3xHAp is mainly (85%) localized in the P2 fraction together with a minor (15%) localization in the P3 fraction (Fig.2 B). Using antibodies against marker proteins for different subcellular organelles (α-Dpm1p for ER membranes and α-Anp1p for Golgi membranes), we confirmed that Yea4–3xHAp is accumulated mainly in the ER enriched fraction (P2 pellet), but not in the Golgi enriched fraction (P3 pellet) (Fig. 2 B). To complement the biochemical studies described above, we performed an indirect immunofluorescence experiment using α-HA mAb, α-Wbp1p, and affinity-purified α-Anp1 antiserum. Each antibody preparation recognized a single protein corresponding to the predicted molecular mass on immunoblots of whole cell lysates (Fig. 2 B for α-HA and α-Anp1p, and data not shown for α-Wbp1p). Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy of Yea4–3xHAp-expressing cells revealed that this protein is localized in the ER (Fig.3 A), as judged by comparing the staining pattern of Yea4–3xHAp with those of ER and Golgi marker proteins, Wbp1p (32.te Hessen S. Janetzky B. Lehle L. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2071-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and Anp1p (33.Jungmann J. Munro S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), respectively (Fig. 3, Band D). The immunofluorescence staining of Yea4p-3xHAp was specific for the HA fusion, because the signals were not observed when the α-HA mAb was omitted (data not shown) or when the cells lacking the HA epitope (vector alone) were stained with α-HA mAb (Fig.3 C). The Yea4–3xHAp-expressing cells displayed a hallmark pattern of ER localization (Fig. 3 A), distinctly different from a punctate staining, which is typical of Golgi staining (Fig.3 D). 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole staining of nuclei also supported the ER localization of YEA4 gene product with Yea4–3xHAp localized to the nuclear periphery (data not shown). We next wished to determine whether the ER-localized Yea4p functions as a UDP-GlcNAc transporter. For these experiments we chose a biochemical approach, assaying in vitro UDP-GlcNAc transport activities in P2 and P3 membrane vesicles. The intactness and topology of these vesicles were confirmed by measuring luminal marker enzyme activities in the presence or absence of Triton X-100, according to Castroet al. (5.Castro O. Chen L.Y. Parodi A.J. Abeijon C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1019-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This control indicated that at least 95% of the vesicles were intact, maintaining the same topology as in vivo (data not shown). To investigate the in vivo role of YEA4, the gene was disrupted by the PCR-based gene deletion method (see “Experimental Procedures”). The sugar nucleotide transport activities were measured by P2 and P3 membrane vesicles prepared from wild type, yea4 null mutant (Δyea4), and Yea4–3xHAp-overexpressing cells. The transport activity was standardized on the basis of (i) protein concentration (Fig.4 A), (ii) incubation time (Fig. 4 B), (iii) substrate concentration (Fig.4 C), and (iv) incubation temperature (data not shown). In Yea4–3xHAp-expressing cells (Fig.5 A), most of the UDP-GlcNAc transport activity (85% of t"

The ST6Gal I is expressed as two isoforms with a single amino acid difference in their catalytic domains. The STcys isoform is stably retained in the cell and is predominantly found in the Golgi, whereas the STtyr isoform is only transiently localized in the Golgi and is cleaved and secreted from a post-Golgi compartment. These two ST6Gal I isoforms were used to explore the role of the bilayer thickness mechanism and oligomerization in Golgi localization. Analysis of STcys and STtyr proteins with longer transmembrane regions suggested that the bilayer thickness mechanism is not the predominant mechanism used for ST6Gal I Golgi localization. In contrast, the formation and quantity of Triton X-100-insoluble oligomers was correlated with the stable or transient localization of the ST6Gal I isoforms in the Golgi. Nearly 100% of the STcys and only 13% of the STtyr were found as Triton-insoluble oligomers when Golgi membranes of COS-1 cells expressing these proteins were solubilized at pH 6.3, the pH of the late Golgi. In contrast, both proteins were found in the soluble fraction when these membranes were solubilized at pH 8.0. Analysis of other mutants suggested that a conformational change in the catalytic domain rather than increased disulfide bond-based cross-linking is the basis for the increased ability of STcys protein to form oligomers and the stable localization of STcys protein in the Golgi.

ST6Gal I or α2,6-sialyltransferase endoplasmic reticulum Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium phosphate-buffered saline The ST6Gal I, or β-galactoside α2,6-sialyltransferase (ST),1 is a glycosyltransferase that has been localized to the trans cisternae of the Golgi and the trans Golgi network (1.Roth J. Taatjes D.J. Lucoq J.M. Weinstein J. Paulson J.C. Cell. 1985; 43: 287-295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Within these compartments it encounters the sugar nucleotide donor, CMP-NeuAc, and functions to add terminal sialic acid residues to the N-linked oligosaccharides of glycoproteins. The ST6Gal I is expressed as two isoforms that have a single amino acid difference at position 123 in the catalytic domain (2.Ma J. Qian R. Rausa III, F.M. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 672-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This single amino acid difference (Tyr → Cys) is the result of a single nucleotide change (A → G), which is likely the result of an RNA editing event (2.Ma J. Qian R. Rausa III, F.M. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 672-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The STtyr isoform is found in the Golgi, at low levels on the cell surface and is cleaved and secreted from COS-1 and HeLa cells with a half time of 3–6 h. In striking contrast, the STcys isoform is found in the Golgi in moderately expressing cells and is never observed at the cell surface or cleaved and secreted into the media of COS-1 or HeLa cells (2.Ma J. Qian R. Rausa III, F.M. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 672-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Several pieces of evidence suggest that the difference observed in STtyr and STcys processing relate to differences in the localization and trafficking of these proteins in the cell. First, decreasing the temperature of cells to 20 °C prevents the cleavage and secretion of the STtyr from COS-1 cells, suggesting that this isoform is only transiently localized in the Golgi and moves beyond the trans Golgi network into a post-Golgi compartment where cleavage occurs (2.Ma J. Qian R. Rausa III, F.M. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 672-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The presence of low levels of the STtyr protein at the cell surface also supports the idea that the STtyr is only transiently localized in the Golgi. In addition, it is unlikely that the presence of the Cys at position 123 eliminates cleavage per se because the major cleavage site is found in the stem region between Lys40 and Glu41 and because both isoforms are cleaved and secreted from Chinese hamster ovary cells (2.Ma J. Qian R. Rausa III, F.M. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 672-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 3.Kitazume-Kawaguchi S. Dohmae N. Takio K. Tsuji S. Colley K.J. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This latter observation also suggests that the ST6Gal I isoforms and/or the proteases responsible for cleavage are localized differently in different cell types.What is the basis for the differences in ST6Gal I isoform localization and processing? Two hypotheses have been formulated to explain the localization of proteins in the Golgi. The bilayer thickness hypothesis first stated by Bretscher and Munro (4.Bretscher M.S. Munro S. Science. 1993; 261: 1280-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar) and supported by the results of Munro (5.Munro S. EMBO J. 1991; 12: 3577-3588Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 6.Munro S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4695-4704Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) and Masibay et al. (7.Masibay A.S. Balaji P.J. Boeggeman E.E. Quasba P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9908-9916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is based on three observations. First, on average, Golgi proteins have shorter transmembrane regions than plasma membrane proteins (7.Masibay A.S. Balaji P.J. Boeggeman E.E. Quasba P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9908-9916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Munro S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Second, there is a gradient of cholesterol in membranes from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the plasma membrane with the highest levels found in the plasma membrane (9.Orci L. Montesano R. Meda P. Malaisse-Lagae F. Brown D. Perrelet A. Vassalli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Third, in vitro liposome studies have demonstrated that increasing the levels of cholesterol in a membrane increases its width (10.Nezil F.A. Bloom M. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 1176-1183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). From these observations, Bretscher and Munro (4.Bretscher M.S. Munro S. Science. 1993; 261: 1280-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar) proposed that Golgi membrane proteins, with their shorter transmembrane regions, are not able to partition into transport vesicles moving to the plasma membrane and are therefore essentially retained in the Golgi. The oligomerization/kin recognition hypothesis has several origins. First, Machamer (11.Machamer C.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1991; 1: 141-144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) proposed that proteins form oligomers in the specific microenvironments of the Golgi cisternae and that the insolubility or size of these oligomers prevents them from entering transport vesicles and trafficking to the plasma membrane. Nilsson and co-workers (12.Nilsson T. Slusarewicz P. Hoe M.H. Warren G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) later expanded on this idea with their kin recognition hypothesis in which they suggested that resident Golgi proteins form very large hetero-oligomers with proteins in the same cisternae and that the size of these oligomers prevents their partitioning into transport vesicles destined for the next compartment. Work done by Nilsson et al. (13.Nilsson T. Hoe M.H. Slusarewicz P. Rabouille C. Watson R. Hunte F. Watzele G. Berger E.G. Warren G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 562-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 14.Nilsson T. Rabouille C. Hui N. Watson R. Warren G. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1975-1989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that such hetero-oligomers were formed by the α-mannosidase II andN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I of the medial Golgi and that their formation correlated with the localization of these two glycosyltransferases in this compartment. Similar hetero-oligomers were not observed for the β1,4-galactosyltransferase or ST6Gal I (6.Munro S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4695-4704Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar).In this manuscript we demonstrate that the ability of the STtyr and STcys isoforms of the ST6Gal I to form insoluble oligomers correlates with the extent of their localization in the Golgi. In contrast, the length of the transmembrane region does not seem to impact Golgi localization or trafficking and processing of either isoform. We also investigate the effects of other ST6Gal I mutants and assess the potential role of STcys disulfide bond formation in Golgi localization. We conclude that the differences in the conformation of the lumenal domains of the two isoform rather than the ability of the STcys to form additional disulfide bonds leads to the increased ability of the STcys to form oligomers.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsTissue culture media and reagents, including Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), and Lipofectin were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.

Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26310-26319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The SA23 and SA29 chimeras of STtyr were constructed by replacing an internalBglII fragment (nucleotides 323–930) of STcys SA23 and SA29 mutants with the identical fragment from the STtyr cDNA. In these chimeric proteins, the transmembrane (or signal anchor) region of ST6Gal I (FSLFILVFLLFAVICVW) was replaced with sequences from the influenza neuraminidase transmembrane region (IFTIGSICMVVGIISLILQIGNF in the SA23 chimera or IFTIGSICMVVGIISLILQIGNIISIWIS in the SA29 chimera). To construct the STser, STphe, STtyr C129S, and STtyr N158Q mutants, we used the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the STtyr-pSVL plasmid as a template. The following oligonucleotides were used in the construction of the STtyr mutants: STphe, TATAAAGTATCCAAGGGACCGG and CCGGTCCCTTGAAGGATACTTTATA; STser, TATAAAGTATCCTCAAAGGGACCGG and CCGGTCCCTTTGAGGATACTTTATA; STtyr C139S, GCACTGCGTTCCCACCTTCGAGACC and GGTCTCGAAGGTGGGAACG- CAGTGC; and STtyr N158Q, GATTTTCCCTTCCAGACGACTGAGTGGG and CCCACTCAGTCGTCTGG- AAGGGAAAATC.Transfection of COS-1 CellsCOS-1 cells maintained in DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum were plated on 100-mm tissue culture dishes or on 12-mm coverslips and grown in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator until 50–70% confluent. Cells were transfected using the Lipofectin and Opti-MEM I with 55 μm β-mercaptoethanol according to the Life Technologies, Inc. instructions and as described previously (15.Dahdal R.Y. Colley K.J.

The cells were then trypsinized, washed once with PBS, and suspended in 5 volumes of homogenization medium (0.25 msucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm magnesium acetate, and 100 mm iodoacetamide). Following homogenization with a mini Dounce homogenizer, a Golgi-enriched fraction was isolated by subjecting the membrane mixtures to equilibrium sucrose density gradient centrifugation according to the method described by Xu and Shields (22.Xu H. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1169-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). All sucrose gradient solutions contained 100 mm iodoacetamide to prevent aberrant disulfide bond formation during membrane preparation procedures. The Golgi membrane-enriched fraction was collected, washed once with 100 mm iodoacetamide, and pelleted by centrifugation at 39,000 rpm for 1 h. The pellets were resuspended in 2 ml of MNT buffer of either pH 6.3 or pH 8.0. After a 10-min solubilization on ice, one half of the membrane lysate was transferred to a Beckman SW65 Ti ultracentrifuge tube for separation into soluble and pelleted material, whereas the other half of the cell lysate was reserved as the total protein control.

The cells were trypsinized, washed once with PBS, and suspended in five volumes of homogenization medium (0.25m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm magnesium acetate, and 100 mmiodoacetamide). Following homogenization with a mini Dounce homogenizer, membrane mixtures were subjected to equilibrium sucrose density gradients for the isolation of a Golgi-enriched fraction according to the method described by Xu and Shields (22.Xu H. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1169-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and as described above. To analyze the formation of disulfide bonded dimers and high molecular mass oligomers, the Golgi-enriched membrane fractions from cells expressing these proteins were treated with Laemmli sample buffer (20.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205998) Google Scholar) with or without 5% β-mercaptoethanol at 100 °C for 10 min. Samples were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting. ST proteins were detecting by immunoblotting as described above.DISCUSSIONIn this work, we have provided evidence that the ST6Gal I isoforms use an oligomerization based mechanism for their localization in the Golgi. Significant amounts of rat liver and rat hepatoma ST6Gal I are found as Triton X-100-insoluble oligomers when Golgi membranes are lysed at pH 5.8–6.3, the pH of the late Golgi cisternae, but not at higher pH values. Both the STtyr and STcys isoforms of the ST6Gal I are found in rat liver, but their ratio is not definitively known, so that their contribution to the pool of insoluble oligomers is not clear from these analyses. However, individual analysis of the STtyr and STcys isoforms reveals that the STcys, which is more stably localized in the Golgi, quantitatively forms or is stabilized as Triton X-100-insoluble oligomers when Golgi membranes are lysed with buffers of pH 6.3. In contrast, the STtyr, which is transiently localized in the Golgi, demonstrates a reduced ability to form these pH-dependent insoluble oligomers.Analysis of mutant proteins with changes at position 123 or nearby amino acids suggests that a conformational difference between the lumenal domains of the two isoforms rather than a difference in their ability to form disulfide-bonded complexes can account for differences in their ability to form Triton X-100-insoluble oligomers. First, the replacement of the Cys at position 123 with a Ser residue generates a protein that behaves much like the STcys isoform in that it is not effectively cleaved and secreted (Fig. 6). In contrast, the presence of a Phe residue in that position generates a protein that is cleaved and secreted at the same rate as the STtyr. Because the STser protein does not have an additional Cys residue in its lumenal sequences, this argues that a change in conformation is sufficient for more stable oligomerization. Second, a protein lacking one of the twoN-linked oligosaccharides of the ST6Gal I (STtyr N158Q) behaves like the STcys and STser and has a reduced level of cleavage and secretion. The absence of an oligosaccharide early in the folding process may alter the STtyr N158Q proteins conformation and, in addition, the absence of this oligosaccharide in the mature protein may promote oligomerization by exposing more hydrophobic sequences or allowing closer contact between monomers. Third, although the STcys and STtyr C139S do show some ability to form higher molecular mass disulfide bonded complexes, it is clear that their monomeric and dimeric forms predominate, so it is more likely that changes in the conformation of their lumenal domains allow increased oligomer formation. Notably, mutation of other Cys residues (at positions 181, 332, 350, 361, and 403) in the STtyr catalytic domain either markedly misfold the protein leading to its retention in the STcys or do not substantially alter its trafficking.3 At this point it is interesting to note that all the changes that lead to increased oligomerization and/or decreased cleavage and secretion are in the amino-terminal portion of the ST6Gal I catalytic domain (between amino acids 123 and 158). These results and observations suggest that the conformation of this portion of the catalytic domain is particularly important for the oligomerization of the enzyme and its localization and trafficking.Results presented in this work suggest that disulfide bond-based cross-linking of ST6Gal I protein that possesses an additional Cys residue in the lumenal domain is not likely to control oligomerization and ultimate Golgi localization. However, disulfide bonded dimer formation is important to consider because we observe that the majority of rat liver Golgi ST6Gal I in insoluble complexes at pH 5.8–6.3 appears to be in the disulfide-bonded dimer form (Fig. 3). All the proteins we analyzed showed the ability to form disulfide-bonded dimers, but this ability did not necessarily correlate with high levels of oligomerization and stable Golgi localization. One possibility is that ST6Gal I dimers form Triton X-100-insoluble oligomers more easily and stably than monomers and that this may be an initial step in a two-step oligomerization process. As a result, the presence of disulfide-bonded dimer in the insoluble oligomers of the rat liver Golgi enzyme may reflect a core of an oligomer that is more stable and less sensitive to the membrane solubilization conditions.Other researchers have obtained evidence that Golgi proteins are localized in the Golgi by an oligomerization or kin recognition mechanism.

Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) demonstrated that chimeric proteins containing the first transmembrane region of the coronavirus M (E1) glycoprotein are localized in the Golgi and that this is correlated with the formation of high molecular mass SDS-insoluble oligomers.

Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12170-12176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) suggest that homo-dimers and perhaps hetero-oligomers of the β1,4-galactosyltransferase correlate with its Golgi localization.

This mitogenic effect is dependent upon activation of a protein-tyrosine kinase cascade that results in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Because of suggestive evidence that 14,15-EET also activated Src in these cells, we stably transfected LLCPKcl4 with an expression construct of the C-terminal Src kinase (CSK), which inhibits Src family kinase activity. In vitroSrc kinase activity assays confirmed that in empty vector-transfected cells (Vector cells), 14,15-EET increased Src kinase activity, while in clones overexpressing CSK mRNA and immunoreactive protein (CSK cells), 14,15-EET-induced activation of Src was almost completely blocked (94% inhibition). Of interest, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and fetal bovine serum (FBS) also increased Src activity in Vector cells, but not in CSK cells, further confirming the ability of CSK overexpression to prevent Src activation. CSK cells failed to increase [3H]thymidine incorporation in response to exogenous 14,15-EET. In contrast, both EGF and FBS significantly increased [3H]thymidine incorporation in CSK cells. Immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies and immunoblotting with an antibody against extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) indicated that in CSK cells, 14,15-EET failed to activate ERK1 and ERK2; however, EGF- and FBS-induced activation of ERKs was not different from that seen in Vector cells. In Vector cells, the 14,15-EET-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of ERKs was blocked by pretreatment with 1 μm PP2, a selective inhibitor of Src kinases. The present study demonstrates that 14,15-EET exerts its mitogenic effects predominantly through a Src kinase-mediated pathway, which is the most upstream signaling step determined to date in the 14,15-EET-activated tyrosine kinase cascade in renal epithelial cells.

In addition to cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, the cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase pathway also catalyzes the in vivo metabolism of arachidonic acid to biologically active compounds. This pathway metabolizes arachidonic acid in two ways: epoxidation, producing 5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids and ω/ω-1 hydroxylation, resulting in the formation of 19- and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (1.Rahman M.

Polyclonal rabbit anti-CSK antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Polyclonal and monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Polyclonal anti-ERK antibodies and protein A-agarose beads were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Arachidonic acid was obtained from NuCheck-Prep, Inc. (Elysian, MN). (±)-14,15-Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid sulfonimide analog was synthesized as described previously (4.Chen J.-K. Falck J.R. Reddy K.M. Capdevila J. Harris R.C. J. Biol.

PP2 was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). All other chemicals were from Sigma. LLCPKcl4, an established renal proximal tubule epithelial cell line derived from pig kidney (29.Amsler K. Cook J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: C94-C101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was routinely cultured as described previously (4.Chen J.-K. Falck J.R. Reddy K.M. Capdevila J. Harris R.C. J. Biol.

In order to stably transfect CSK cDNA into LLCPKcl4 cells, the cDNAs containing the entire coding region of CSK were cut out from pcDNA-I vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) by EcoRI digestion and then ligated into the EcoRI site of the neomycin resistant gene-containing vector pIRES1neo (CLONTECH Laboratories Inc., Palo Alto, CA). The sense orientation to the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter was identified by restriction enzyme digestion analysis and further confirmed by sequencing analysis. One μg/ml CSK cDNA in pIRES1neo or empty pIRES1neo vector alone was used for stable transfection into LLCPKcl4 cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (30.Chen J.-K. Wang D.-W. Falck J.R. Capdevila J. Harris R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4764-4769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). After 7 passages in medium containing 600 μg/ml G418, G418-resistant clones were then isolated and screened by slot blot hybridization. Nine clones that expressed the highest levels of CSK mRNA were used to select further the highest levels of the immunoreactive CSK by immunoblotting with polyclonal antibodies against CSK. Two of the clones that expressed the highest levels of immunoreactive CSK, clones 13 and 26, along with LLCPKcl4 cells transfected with vector alone, were used for subsequent signaling studies. Stable transfection and selection of stable transfectants of mutant bacterial cytochrome P450 BM3 were conducted as described (30.Chen J.-K. Wang D.-W. Falck J.R. Capdevila J. Harris R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4764-4769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Nontransfected, pIRES1neo vector-transfected cells and CSK-transfected individual clones were grown in 6-mm dishes and made quiescent for 3 days, and then total cellular RNA was isolated as described previously (4.Chen J.-K. Falck J.R. Reddy K.M. Capdevila J. Harris R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29254-29261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). 10 μg of total RNA, as determined by absorbance at 260 nm, was slot blotted onto Nytran nylon membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) and immobilized with a UV cross-linker. [α-32P]cDNA probe was labeled to a specific activity of >2 × 108dpm/μg by random priming (Megaprime DNA labeling system; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After overnight hybridization, membranes were washed twice with 2× SSC (0.3 m NaCl and 0.03m sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min and 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min. Autoradiography was performed at −70 °C by exposing the washed membranes to Hyperfilm (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with intensifying screens. pIRES1neo vector-transfected and CSK-transfected cells were made quiescent and treated with indicated agents, washed twice with ice-cold Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed on ice for 30 min in RIPA buffer (4.Chen J.-K. Falck J.R. Reddy K.M. Capdevila J. Harris R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29254-29261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were clarified at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Target proteins were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 2 h with appropriate antibodies. Immune complexes were captured with 50 μl of protein A-agarose beads and washed four times with wash buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and 100 μmNa3VO4). Immunoprecipitates were resuspended and boiled in sample buffer before separation on a 7.5% or 12% SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and immunodetected with the indicated primary antibodies and the appropriate secondary antibodies as described previously (4.Chen J.-K. Falck J.R. Reddy K.M. Capdevila J. Harris R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29254-29261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Subconfluent cells in 24-well plates were made quiescent with serum-free medium. Agents were routinely added to the quiescent cells in triplicate or duplicate and incubated for 19 h, followed by addition of 2 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine to pulse the cells for an additional 2 h. Cells were then washed four times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, precipitated twice (30 min each time on ice) with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, briefly washed once with ice-cold ethanol, then lysed with 0.2 nNaOH, 0.5% SDS lysis buffer and incubated at 37 °C for at least 30 min, and radioactivity of incorporated [3H]thymidine was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA). Results were plotted as the number of counts per minute per well. Each experimental data point represents triplicate or duplicate wells from at least four different experiments. Src immunoprecipitates were prepared as described above and washed twice with kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 μm Na3VO4). Phosphorylation reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 1 mg/ml acid-denatured enolase as a substrate and allowed to proceed for 15 min at room temperature. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 10 μl of acetic acid. The amount of enolase phosphorylation was then determined by spotting an aliquot (25 μl) of the reaction mix onto P-81 cation exchange paper (Whatman), washing three times in 0.5% phosphoric acid, and measuring radioactivity in a scintillation counter. Data are presented as means ± S.E. for at least four separate experiments (each in triplicate or duplicate). Unpaired Student's t test was used for statistical analysis and for multiple group comparisons, analysis of variance and Bonferronit tests were used. A value of p < 0.05 compared with control was considered statistically significant. We stably transfected CSK cDNA, cloned in the mammalian expression vector pIRES1neo, into the LLCPKcl4 cell line, which was cloned from the parent LLC-PK1 cell line and selected for its expression of high levels of proximal tubule characteristics (31.Graham-Lorence S. Truan G. Peterson J.A. Falck J.R. Wei S. Helvig C. Capdevila J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1127-1135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). G418-resistant clones were then isolated and screened by for mRNA expression levels (data not shown), and selected for immunoreactive CSK expression with polyclonal antibodies against CSK (Fig.1). Two of the clones that overexpressed immunoreactive CSK, clones 13 and 26, along with LLCPKcl4 cells transfected with empty vector alone, were used for subsequent signaling studies. Cells transfected with empty vector alone and CSK-overexpressing cells were rendered quiescent and exposed to the indicated agents. Cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal antibody specifically against pp60c-src, and the immunoprecipitates were used for in vitro Src kinase activity assays. As shown in Fig.2, 14,15-EET increased Src kinase activity 3.1-fold in empty vector-transfected cells, whereas in the CSK-overexpressing cells, 14,15-EET-induced activation of Src kinase activity was almost completely blocked (94% inhibition). Of interest, EGF and FBS also significantly increased Src kinase activity in empty vector-transfected cells, but not in CSK-overexpressing cells (Fig. 2). This inhibition of EGF-, FBS- and 14,15-EET-induced activation of Src kinase confirmed the ability of CSK overexpression to prevent Src activation. 14,15-EET has previously been demonstrated to be a potent mitogen in the nontransfected LLCPKcl4 cells, and Src has been suggested to involved in the signal transduction (4.Chen J.-K. Falck J.R. Reddy K.M. Capdevila J. Harris R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29254-29261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To test the effects of CSK overexpression on the mitogenic properties of 14,15-EET, nontransfected cells, empty vector-transfected LLCPKcl4 cells, and CSK-overexpressing clones CSK and CSK 26, were made quiescent and exposed to 14,15-EET (20 μm), EGF (30 nm), FBS (2.5%), or vehicle prior to determination of [3H]thymidine incorporation. As indicated in Fig. 3, 14,15-EET significantly stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation in both nontransfected cells and empty vector-transfected cells. The EET effect was almost completely abolished by overexpression of CSK in these cells. These data suggest that pp60c-src and/or other Src family kinases (Yes, Fyn, Lyn) were required for the 14,15-EET-induced increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation. Interestingly, both EGF and FBS significantly stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation in the CSK-overexpressing clones as well as in nontransfected and empty vector-transfected cells, indicating that they can exert mitogenic effects through Src-independent signaling pathways while 14,15-EET's mitogenic effect is Src-dependent. We have reported that 14,15-EET activates both extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in this cell line, and both mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway are required for EET-induced mitogenesis (4.Chen J.-K. Falck J.R. Reddy K.M. Capdevila J. Harris R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29254-29261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In order to examine whether CSK overexpression affected the early signals activated by 14,15-EET, cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies and immunoblotted with anti-ERK antibody (Fig.4 A). In CSK-overexpressing cells, 14,15-EET failed to activate either 44-kDa ERK1 or 42-kDa ERK2, whereas EGF- and FBS-induced activation of both ERK1 and ERK2 were not different from that observed in the cells transfected with empty vector alone. Similar results were obtained when cell lysates were probed with antibodies specific for phosphorylated ERKs (Fig. 4 B). In empty vector-transfected cells, pretreatment of the cells for 30 min with PP2, a selective inhibitor of kinase activity of pp60c-src and other Src family kinases, at a concentration (1 μm) that did not affect basal ERK expression, markedly inhibited 14,15-EET-increased tyrosine phosphorylation of both ERK1 and ERK2 (Fig.5). Synthetic eicosanoids have been widely utilized for the experimental analysis of their cellular and organ functions. However, in many cases, this approach provides only limited information with regard to their mechanisms of action and the enzymatic steps responsible for their biosynthesis from endogenous precursors, activation, and disposition. This is of special relevance regarding P450-derived eicosanoids, since in most cultured cells, there is a rapid and progressive decrease in the expression of the P450 isoforms found in vivo. LLCPKcl4 cells have no detectable endogenous P450 expression (30.Chen J.-K. Wang D.-W. Falck J.R. Capdevila J. Harris R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4764-4769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In order to study further the involvement of Src kinase in endogenous EET signaling, we utilized stable LLCPKcl4 transfectants expressing a regio- and stereoselective 14S,15R-epoxygenase (14S,15R-EET, 99% of total products, 98% optical purity), the enantiomer that predominates in vivo in the kidney (30.Chen J.-K.

This protein is the bacterial cP450 BM3, in which phenylalanine 87 was replaced for valine (F87V BM3) (31.Graham-Lorence S. Truan G. Peterson J.A. Falck J.R. Wei S. Helvig C. Capdevila J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1127-1135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and catalyzes NADPH-dependent arachidonic acid oxidation as a self-contained catalytic unit (31.Graham-Lorence S.

In the F87V BM3-transfected cells, EGF increased [3H]thymidine incorporation to a significantly greater extent than in cells transfected with the vector alone, and 14,15-EET has been documented to function as an intracellular second messenger in response to EGF (30.Chen J.-K. Wang D.-W. Falck J.R. Capdevila J. Harris R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4764-4769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). F87V BM3 transfectants metabolize arachidonic acid to 14,15-EET after EGF administration (30.Chen J.-K. Wang D.-W. Falck J.R. Capdevila J. Harris R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4764-4769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, in vector-transfected cells, exogenous arachidonic acid was unable to induce ERK tyrosine phosphorylation and the specific inhibitor of pp60c-src kinase, PP2, did not affect EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ERKs. In contrast, in the F87V BM3-transfected cells, arachidonic acid addition dramatically stimulated ERK tyrosine phosphorylation, which was almost completely blocked by PP2 pretreatment (Fig. 6). Administration of EGF to F87V BM3-transfected cells increased ERK tyrosine phosphorylation to a significantly greater extent than in cells transfected with the empty vector alone. The Src kinase inhibitor, PP2, reduced EGF-stimulated ERK tyrosine phosphorylation in the F87V BM3-transfected LLCPKcl4 cells to the levels observed in the empty vector-transfected cells (Fig. 6). However, PP2 did not inhibit the EGF-stimulated ERK tyrosine phosphorylation in the vector-transfected cells, further indicating that this inhibitor did not nonspecifically inhibit ERK activation. These results indicate that Src kinase is activated by the EGF-induced increases in 14,15-EET biosynthesis from endogenous arachidonic acid pools. In summary, the present studies indicate that in renal epithelial cells, the epoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid, epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, exert their mitogenic effects predominantly through a pathway mediated by pp60c-src and/or other Src family kinases and that this Src kinase activity is the most upstream signaling protein determined to date in the 14,15-EET-activated tyrosine kinase cascade. EETs have also been shown to activate tyrosine kinase cascades and induce mitogenesis in smooth muscle, mesangial, and endothelial cells (33.Harris R.C. Homma T. Jacobson H.R. Capdevila J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 144: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 34.Graber M.N. Alfonso A. Gill D.L. J. Biol.

Prominent among these is the glycosome, a unique peroxisome-like microbody that accommodates glycolytic enzymes, as well as enzymes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation, glycerol metabolism, ether-lipid and pyrimidine biosynthesis, and purine salvage (1.Opperdoes F.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 127-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The hallmark enzyme of peroxisomes, catalase, however, is absent inTrypanosoma brucei, the etiologic agent of African sleeping sickness, and Leishmania spp., which cause a spectrum of diseases collectively known as leishmaniases (2.Kuzoe F.A. Acta Tropica. 1993; 54: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 3.World Health Organization“ Leishmaniases ” Bulletin 701. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland1984Google Scholar). Although the enzymatic contents of glycosomes and peroxisomes differ, both types of microbodies share common structural features including that they are surrounded by a single phospholipid membrane bilayer, lack DNA, exhibit similar morphologies, are electron dense, sediment to equivalent densities in isopycnic gradients, and are presumed to share common mechanisms of protein targeting and biogenesis (4.Michels P.A. Hannaert V. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Glycosomes appear to be indispensable to bloodstream forms of T. brucei, the causative agent of African sleeping sickness, because this stage of the parasite is entirely dependent upon glycolysis for ATP production (5.Hammond D.J. Aman R.A. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15646-15654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of the glycosome in Leishmania species is less clear, because this genus is capable of utilizing alternative fuel sources to produce cellular energy (6.Blum J.J. J. Protozool. 1990; 3B7: 505-510Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 7.Krassner S.M. Flory B. Acta Tropica. 1977; 34: 157-166PubMed Google Scholar). However, the multiplicity of key metabolic pathways that require glycosomal machinery for function suggests that proteins encompassed within this unique parasite organelle offer a number of potentially attractive targets for the therapy of trypanosomiasis or leishmaniasis. Glycosomal, as well as peroxisomal, proteins are nuclear encoded, synthesized on cytosolic polyribosomes, and subsequently imported post-translationally without modification into the glycosomal matrix. This translocation across the glycosomal and peroxisomal membrane is mediated by a variety of targeting signals. The first peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS)1 to be recognized and characterized was the COOH-terminal tripeptide, serine-lysine-leucine archetype or PTS-1. PTS-1 appears to be both necessary and sufficient for protein import (8.Gould S.J. Keller G.A. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and is a topogenic signal for proteins targeted to the peroxisome of mammals and yeast, the glyoxysome of plant cells, and the glycosome of trypanosomes andLeishmania (9.Gould S.J.

Mutational analysis has revealed that PTS-1 accommodates considerable acceptable degeneracy, because conservative substitutions at any of the three PTS-1 positions are tolerated (12.Sommer J.M. Cheng Q.L. Keller G.A. Wang C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Although the majority of glycosomal proteins contains a PTS-1, other targeting signals have been described. These include PTS-2, an NH2-terminal peptide found on T. brucei aldolase and hexokinase (13.Hannaert V. Irrthum A. Lambeir A. Opperdoes F.R. Michels P.A.M. Arch. Physiol.

LdPEX5 exhibited a high affinity, specific interaction with the PTS-1 of the L. donovani xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (XPRT) enzyme and has been localized predominantly to the leishmanial cytosol by confocal microscopy. Genetic experiments have implied that a functionalLdPEX5 gene is essential for parasite survival. [32P]dCTP (300 Ci/mmol) and GeneScreen Plus membrane were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. All restriction enzymes and DNA modifying enzymes were acquired from either Life Technologies, Inc. or Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Ready-To Go Beads (dCTP) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other reagents were of the highest quality commercially available. The wild type, L. donovani line, DI700, was grown as the extracellular promastigote form in completely defined Dulbecco's modified Eagle-Leishmania medium that was routinely supplemented with hemin and xanthine. Degenerate sense (5′-CAGGCSGAGAACGARMARGA-3′) and antisense (5′-GTSGCSCCNARYYTRTTCCA-3′) oligonucleotides were used as primers to amplify a 456-base pair (bp) fragment from L. donovani genomic DNA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology. PCR was performed on an MJ Research instrument with standard ingredients and Taq polymerase using a 5-min hot start at 94 °C followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 45 s. The PCR fragment was cloned into the Topo TA vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and sequenced on a Perkin Elmer-Applied Biosystems 377 DNA automated sequencer using dye terminator cycle methodology to verify that the translation product was homologous to PEX5 family members. The 456-bpPEX5 fragment was then used as a probe to isolate the full-length PEX5 from an L. donovani cosmid library using previously reported high stringency conditions of hybridization and washing (21.Hanson S. Adelman J. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2350-2359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The complete LdPEX5 open reading frame (ORF) was sequenced in both directions from overlappingPstI (3.2 kilobase) and EcoRI/BamHI (2.4 kilobase) fragments that had been subcloned into the pBluescript KS(+) vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and from the cosmid DNA directly, because neither restriction fragment encompassed the 5′ portion of the ORF. Total RNA was isolated from exponentially growing L. donovani DI700 promastigotes using the Qiagen Rneasy midi kit (Valencia, CA). 30 μg of RNA were loaded onto each lane of an 0.8% formaldehyde agarose gel, electrophoresed under standard conditions (22.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2 nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and transferred to a GeneScreen Plus nylon membrane. Northern blot analysis was then carried out with conventional protocols using the full-length LdPEX5ORF as a probe (22.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2 nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). L. donovani promastigote genomic DNA was digested overnight with a battery of restriction endonucleases of which several cut at least once within the LdPEX5 coding region. Southern blot analysis was performed under standard conditions (22.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2 nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and the GeneScreen Plus nylon membrane (NEN Life Science Products) was hybridized at high stringency to a probe spanning the completeLdPEX5 coding sequence. The 5′ end of the matureLdPEX5 mRNA was determined by sequencing a 794-bp fragment amplified from reversed transcribed RNA by PCR. cDNA was prepared from total RNA using random hexamer oligonucleotides and the Superscript reverse transcription kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). The sense primer, 5′-CCAACGCTATATAAGTATCAGTTTCTGTACTTTATTG-3′, in the PCR reaction was designed to the L. donovani mini-exon (23.Wilson K. Hanson S. Landfear S.M. Ullman B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) that is trans-spliced onto the 5′ end of all leishmanial mRNAs (24.Sutton R.E. Boothroyd J.C. Cell. 1986; 47: 527-535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), whereas the antisense primer 5′-CCTTCTCCTCGTCAATCAG-3′ was designed to amino acid residues 218–223 of the LdPEX5 sequence. PCR was performed using a 3-min hot start at 95 °C and 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, 62 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min with Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). The PCR product was subcloned into the Topo-TA vector, and the termini were sequenced to ascertain the spliced leader junction site of the LdPEX5 mRNA. TheLdPEX5 ORF was amplified from cosmid DNA by PCR usingTaq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI), a sense primer, 5′-ACACAAAACAAACGGCCATATGGACTGCAACACTG-3′, containing anNdeI site created at the initiation codon and an antisense primer 5′-GCTCTAGACTCTGTCTCTGCCTCGTGTAG-3′, with anXbaI site immediately downstream from the termination codon (restriction sites underlined). After 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 62 °C for 50 s, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min, the PCR product was ligated into the Topo TA vector, and the LdPEX5 sequence was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. The 1.87-kilobaseNdeI/XbaI fragment encompassing LdPEX5was then inserted into the NdeI/XbaI sites of the pBAce bacterial expression vector (25.Craig 3d, S.P. Yuan L. Kuntz D.A. McKerrow J.H. Wang C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2500-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) to generate pBAce-LdPEX5. A double-stranded His6 tag oligonucleotide with NdeI cohesive ends was generated by annealing a sense, 5′-TATGCACCACCACCACCACCACGCGGATGACGACGACAAGCA-3′, and an antisense, 5′-TATGCTTGTCGTCGTCATCCGCGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGCA-3′, oligonucleotide and subcloning this fragment into theNdeI site of the pBAce-LdPEX5 construct. Clones with a correctly oriented His6 tag insert were identified by digestion with EcoRI/PvuII and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The His6-tagged construct employed in protein production was designated pBAce-His 6 -LdPEX5. XL-1 BlueE. coli transformed with pBAce-His 6 -LdPEX5 were grown in low phosphate induction medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C for 20 h (25.Craig 3d, S.P. Yuan L. Kuntz D.A. McKerrow J.H. Wang C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2500-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) to yield the NH2-terminal tagged full-length His6-LdPEX5. Pellets from 1 l of bacterial culture were resuspended in 20 ml of 40 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl (binding buffer) containing mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the cells were lysed by two passes through a French Press. Clarified lysates were applied to a 1.5 × 8.0-cm Ni2+-NTA column (Qiagen) equilibrated in binding buffer at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The column was washed with 100 ml of binding buffer, and His6-LdPEX5 was eluted with a 20-ml 10–50 mm imidazole (pH 8.0) step gradient in binding buffer. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining (26.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680Crossref PubMed Scopus (206597) Google Scholar), and those containing a homogeneous protein migrating with an apparent molecular mass of 75 kDa were pooled, dialyzed at 4 °C against 3.0 l of 50 mm Tris pH 8.0, 20 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and concentrated to 5.0 mg/ml in a Centriprep 10 concentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA). The NH2 terminus of the recombinant protein was validated by amino acid sequencing on an Applied Biosystems 473 gas phase sequenator. For oligomerization studies a non-His-tagged version ofLdPEX5 was also overexpressed in E. coli using a pBAce-LdPEX5 expression construct containing only theLdPEX5 coding sequence. Cell pellets from 1-liter cultures were resuspended in 20 ml of 40 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and the cells were lysed with a French Press. Solid (NH4)2SO4 was added to the clarified lysates to a concentration of 20% and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The precipitate was harvested by centrifugation, redissolved in 3 ml of 100 mm Tris, pH 9.0, and dialyzed 16 h at 4 °C against 2 liters of 100 mm Tris, pH 9.0. The dialyzed LdPEX5 solution was clarified by centrifugation, and 5.0 mg of protein were loaded onto a Mono Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 100 mm Tris, pH 9.0, 100 mm NaCl at flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The column was developed with a 40-ml 200–500 mm NaCl linear gradient. Fractions containing a homogeneous 75-kDa band on SDS-PAGE were pooled and submitted for NH2-terminal analysis to verify that the protein was LdPEX5 (Protein Microchemistry Center, University of Victoria, Victoria, Canada). Polyclonal antisera against LdPEX5 were generated in rabbits by Cocalico Biologicals Inc. (Reamstown, PA) using His6-LdPEX5 as an immunogen and standard injection protocols. Antiserum titers were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) on microtiter plates (Beckton Dickinson Labware, Lincoln Park, NJ) coated with 1 μg of His6-LdPEX5/well using anti-LdPEX5 antisera diluted 1:200–1:100,000 and goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (27.Engvall E. Perlmann P. Immunochemistry. 1971; 83: 871-876Crossref Scopus (2834) Google Scholar). ELISA assays were developed with 2,2′azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline) sulfonic acid and H2O2. Immunoblotting was performed with 1 × 106 L. donovani promastigotes fractionated by SDS-PAGE after transfer of proteins to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (NEN Life Science Products) (28.Towbin H. Stahelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44841) Google Scholar). Blots were blocked with 3% fetal bovine serum (FBS) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Tween-20 and probed first with the LdPEX5 antisera diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer followed by the goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:5000) and developed with the Renaissance chemiluminescence reagent (NEN Life Science Products). The molecular and biochemical characterization of the L. donovani XPRT enzyme has been recently reported (29.Jardim A. Bergeson S.E. Shih S. Carter N. Lucas R.W. Merlin G. Myler P.J. Stuart K. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34403-34410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal tripeptide of XPRT is alanine-lysine-leucine (AKL), a tripeptide that conforms to the glycosomal PTS-1 (12.Sommer J.M. Cheng Q.L. Keller G.A. Wang C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 30.Sommer J.M. Wang C.C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 105-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A 408-bp 3′ fragment from XPRTwas amplified from the pBAce-XPRT L. donovani expression vector (29.Jardim A. Bergeson S.E. Shih S. Carter N. Lucas R.W. Merlin G. Myler P.J. Stuart K. Ullman B. J. Biol.

The PCR product was then ligated into the Topo-TA vector (Invitrogen) for sequencing. A 426-bpSalI/EcoRV fragment encompassing the 3′ portion of the L. donovani XPRT was excised from the Topo TA vector and cloned into the corresponding sites of pBAce-XPRT (29.Jardim A. Bergeson S.E.

Chem. 1999; 274: 34403-34410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) to create xprtΔAKL, an XPRT that lacked the AKL COOH-terminal tripeptide. XPRT and xprtΔAKLwere transformed into Sø609 (31.Jochimsen B. Nygaard P. Vestergaard T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1975; 143: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) E. coli and expressed in low phosphate induction medium, and the wild type and truncated XPRT proteins were purified to homogeneity as described (29.Jardim A. Bergeson S.E. Shih S. Carter N. Lucas R.W. Merlin G. Myler P.J. Stuart K. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34403-34410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A Pro-Bind flat bottom ELISA plate (Beckton Dickinson Labware, Lincoln Park, NJ) was coated with 3 μg/well of wild type XPRT or xprtΔAKL in 100 μl of PBS at 4 °C for 16 h. Unbound protein was removed by washing twice with PBS, and the plates were blocked with 200 μl of 3% FBS in PBS for 1 h at 25 °C. The blocking solution was discarded, and 100 μl of His6-LdPEX5 (0.8–800 nm) diluted in 3% FBS, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Unbound His6-LdPEX5 was discarded, and the wells were washed four times with 200 μl of 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS. LdPEX5 was quantitated by standard ELISA protocols using LdPEX5-specific rabbit antisera (1:1000) and goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:3000) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) diluted in PBS containing 3% FBS and 0.1% Tween 20. ELISA assays were developed using 2,2′azinobis(ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonic acid) as the chromogenic substrate. Plates were quantitated on a Dynatech Laboratories MR700 plate reader at 410 nm. LdPEX5 (1 mg/ml) was dissolved in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and digested with trypsin (50 μg/ml) at 25 °C for 2 h. 20-μl aliquots were removed every 20 min for analysis by SDS-PAGE. A 38-kDa protease-resistant core protein domain was transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (28.Towbin H. Stahelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44841) Google Scholar) for NH2-terminal sequencing. This core domain corresponded to the COOH-terminal portion of LdPEX5 and was designated CT-LdPEX5. A 1,173-bpNdeI/XhoI fragment from pBAce-His 6-LdPEX5 was subcloned into the corresponding sites of the pET 30b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) to yield NT-LdPEX5-His 6. This construct encoded the NH2-terminal domain (amino acids 1–391) of LdPEX5 with a COOH-terminal His6 tag. A COOH-terminal fragment ofLdPEX5 was amplified from pBAce-His 6-LdPEX5 using a sense primer, 5′-AAGGGAACTCCATATGCTGCAGAAGGTGACGAAC-3′, containing an NdeI restriction site and an antisense primer, 5′-CGCGGATCCTTAGACGTGGCCCTCAAGTCC-3′, with aBamHI site (restriction sites underlined) by PCR with 25 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min. The PCR product was subcloned into the Topo-TA vector and sequenced. A 966-bpNdeI/BamHI fragment was then cloned into theNdeI and BamHI sites of the pET 15b vector (Novagen) yielding His 6 -CT-LdPEX5, a DNA fragment encoding the majority of the COOH terminus of LdPEX5 (amino acids 303–625) preceded by an NH2-terminal His6 tag. The pET 30b NT-LdPEX5-His 6and pET 15b His 6 -CT-LdPEX5 constructs were transformed into the ER2566 strain of E. coli (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and expression was induced in 1 l cultures for 4 h at 37 °C with 0.8 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellets were resuspended in 20 ml of 40 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2 m NaCl containing EDTA-free mini tab protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell suspensions were lysed by French press, and the His6-tagged proteins were purified by Ni2+-NTA chromatography (Qiagen) according to company protocols. The subunit compositions of His6-LdPEX5, CT-LdPEX5, and NT-LdPEX5 were determined by gel permeation chromatography on a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column developed with 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The column was calibrated with a mixture of proteins, including ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (250 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (30 kDa), trypsin soybean inhibitor (24 kDa), and lysozyme (14 kDa). Proteins were monitored spectrophotometrically at 280 nm. Exponentially growingL. donovani were harvested and resuspended in PBS, allowed to adhere to glass coverslips coated with polylysine (Sigma) for 30 min, and fixed for 10 min at −20 °C with methanol. The coverslips were then washed three times in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and blocked with 3% FBS diluted in PBS. Preimmune and LdPEX5 antisera were diluted 1:2000 in blocking solution and incubated at 25 °C for 1 h. Goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to ALEXA 594 dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used as the secondary antibody, and the stained parasites were visualized on a Leica confocal laser scanning microscope as described (32.Shih S. Hwang H.-Y. Carter D. Stenberg P. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1534-1541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Log phase DI700 L. donovani promastigotes (1 × 1011) were mixed with an equal volume of silicon carbide powder (Sigma), resuspended in 10 ml of 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm sucrose, and mini-tab protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and lysed in a tight fitting Dounce homogenizer as reported (33.Heise N. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 89: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The lysed cell suspension was centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 10 min to remove the silicon carbide, unlysed cells, and nuclei. The supernatant was overlaid on a 25–60% discontinuous sucrose gradient and subjected to centrifugation at 200,000 × g on a Beckman type 50.2 TiV rotor for 2.5 h at 4 °C. 2-ml fractions were then collected from the bottom of the gradient, and each was assayed for pyruvate kinase and hexokinase (34.Decker L.A. Worthington Enzyme Manual. Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Freehold, NJ1977: 98-101Google Scholar) enzymes, cytosolic markers, and glycosomal markers, respectively (35.Hart D.T. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1984; 13: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To assay for native LdPEX5, 20-μl aliquots from each fraction were diluted to 100 μl with dH2O, applied to wells of an ELISA plate, and incubated at 37 °C for 20 h to adsorb proteins to the well. Native LdPEX5 was detected by ELISA as described above. A sense oligonucleotide, 5′-CAAGCTTCTTCAGCTACTCCGAACACA-3′ and an antisense primer, 5′-CGTCGACTGGAAACAGATAGGGAAGAG-3′, containing restriction sites for HindIII and SalI (underlined), respectively, were used to amplify a 610-bp 5′ flank ofLdPEX5 by PCR. Similarly, a 680-bp sequence 3′ to theXPRT coding region was amplified using the sense primer 5′-CCCCGGGGCTACACGAGGCAGAGACAGAG-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-CAGATCTTGAGCAGAGACGCAGGTAGA-3′ that encompassed SmaI and BglII restriction sites (underlined), respectively. To generate the knockout constructs, the 610-bp 5′ and 680-bp 3′ flanks were cloned into theHindIII/SalI and SmaI/BglII sites of the pX63HYG and pX63NEO vectors (36.Cruz A. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7170-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), which contain the hygromycin phosphotransferase and neomycin phosphotransferase resistance markers, respectively. The presence of the LdPEX5flanking regions and their orientation were confirmed by restriction mapping. The drug resistance cassettes were designated pX63-NEO-Δldpex5 and pX63-HYG-Δldpex5, and the linearized plasmids used for the transfections were designated X63-NEO-Δldpex5 and X63-HYG-Δldpex5.

Neuron. 1990; 5: 383-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The GlyR is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor in the post-synaptic membrane of spinal cord and lower brain. Upon binding the agonist glycine, the channel transiently opens, allowing passive flux of chloride, further hyperpolarizing the neuronal cell and thus reducing the probability of reaching an action potential. Like other members of the LGICS, the GlyR is a heteropentamer. Although the receptor is comprised of α (48 kDa) and β (58 kDa) subunits in vivo (2.Langosch D. Thomas L. Betz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7394-7398Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), recombinant GlyR α subunits can assemble as homopentamers and retain native-like pharmacological activity (3.Schmieden V.

This simplified experimental system offers substantial benefits for structural investigations; we have developed a baculovirus overexpression system for the production of functional α1 GlyR which may be purified (5.Cascio M.

Sigworth, and R. O. Fox, manuscript in preparation. for subsequent characterization. The current topological model for all members of the LGICS, derived primarily from hydropathy predictions, is characterized by a large extracellular, globular N-terminal domain (residues 1–218 in α1 GlyR) containing the agonist- and antagonist-binding sites, four TM α-helices, designated M1 to M4, and a large cytoplasmic loop between M3 and M4 (6.Devillers-Thiéry A.

Neuron. 1995; 15: 1231-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). This model persists to date despite some recent structural studies that suggest it may be inappropriate. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy studies of nAChR suggest approximately equal proportions of α-helix and β-structure in the membrane (8.Görne-Tschelnokow U. Strecker A. Kaduk C. Naumann D. Hucho F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 338-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and electron diffraction studies of nAchR arrays suggested a limited helical content within the membrane (9.Unwin N. Nature. 1995; 373: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Recent secondary structure predictions of nAChR place a mixture of β-sheets and α-helices in the TM domain (10.Le Novere N. Corringer P.-J. Changeux J.-P. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2329-2345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). CD studies conducted on reconstituted GlyR similarly indicate a low helical content for this receptor and suggest that there may be insufficient helicity to accommodate four transmembrane helices as well as any extramembranous helical content.2 Although these studies suggest that there are non-helical structures present in the transmembrane domain of the LGICS, the four TM helix model continues to be accepted in the absence of direct evidence refuting this model. Limited proteolysis has been utilized extensively to investigate membrane protein topology, most notably with bacteriorhodopsin. Since recent studies of bacteriorhodopsin have determined its structure at high resolution (11.Grigorieff N. Ceska T.A. Downing K.H. Baldwin J.M. Henderson R. J. Mol.

Biol. 1999; 291: 899-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar), one may evaluate the effectiveness of proteolytic studies in mapping topology. These studies were quite successful and, significantly, proteolytic cleavages were never detected within the hydrophobic interior of the bilayer (13.Fimmel S. Choli T. Dencher N.A. Büldt G. Wittman-Liebold B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 978: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It was also shown that, under appropriate conditions, proteolysis did not affect the structure of the transmembrane domain (14.Dumont M.E. Trewhella J. Engelman D.M. Richards F.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1985; 88: 233-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this study, we have used limited proteolysis coupled with mass spectrometry as tools to examine GlyR topology and critically test the current four-TM helix model. Similar to the studies with bacteriorhodopsin, we assume that limited proteolysis of GlyR powerfully defines the limits of integral membrane protein topology without compromising native protein-lipid bilayer interactions. In the past, identification of digest products primarily relied on Edman degradation of isolated fractions, but recent advances in mass spectrometry (MS) allow one to identify sensitively and rapidly proteolysis products. Electrospray ionization (ESI) MS can precisely identify a peptide by its molecular mass-to-charge ratio (m/z). By using collision-induced dissociation (CID) tandem MS one can deduce amino acid sequence information and/or identify post-translational modifications (15.Hunt D.F. Yates J.R. Shebanowitz J.

Given the homology among the LGICS, we consider the results of our GlyR studies to be paradigmatic for the entire superfamily, and conversely, we use biochemical evidence amassed for all members of the LGICS to assist in the interpretation of our experimental data. To our knowledge, this study is the first to use the capabilities of MS to map the topology of a membrane protein of unknown structure. Recombinant human α1 GlyR homopentamers were overexpressed using a baculovirus expression system and purified as described previously (5.Cascio M. Schoppa N.E. Grodzicki R.L. Sigworth F.J. Fox R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22135-22142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly,Sf9 insect cells were infected at multiplicity of infection >5 and harvested 3 days post-infection. Total membrane protein was isolated by lysis and ultracentrifugation. After low salt washing of the pellet to remove peripheral membrane proteins, the pelleted lipids and proteins were solubilized in buffer containing digitonin, deoxycholate, and mixed phospholipids. Mixed micelles containing native GlyR were affinity purified by binding to 2-aminostrychnine-agarose and elution with wash buffer containing 200 mm glycine. Triton X-100 (8 mm) was exchanged for digitonin while GlyR was bound to the affinity matrix. Purified GlyR was reconstituted into small unilamellar lipid vesicles by gel filtration chromatography on Sephadex G-100 with subsequent probe sonication of collected GlyR-enriched vesicle fractions using conditions in which the receptor was shown to retain activity.2 Digitonin was purchased from Aldrich, deoxycholate and Triton X-100 from Sigma, and egg lecithin phospholipids from J. T. Baker Inc. Purified and reconstituted α1 GlyR samples were proteolyzed with selected enzymes (trypsin, V8 protease, and endoproteinase Lys-C were obtained from Promega). All reaction samples were initially bath-sonicated to ensure the presence of the enzyme inside and outside of the vesicle. GlyR was incubated at 37 °C with the enzyme (1:200 enzyme:substrate) in an appropriate buffer (V8 protease in 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.8; endoproteinase Lys-C in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8; trypsin in 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4) for times ranging from 10 min to 24 h. Soluble and membrane-associated proteolysis products were separated by ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 150,000 × g. Pellets were washed with digest buffer, and lipid was extracted by isobutyl alcohol, isopropyl ether, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (4:3:2.5 by volume). Selected samples were reduced and alkylated with 4-vinylpyridine (18.Andrews P.C. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 524-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) before extraction. Control samples of undigested GlyR and empty vesicles were identically treated and analyzed to identify background peaks and contaminants. Masses were initially acquired by nanospray MS (Fisons Quatro ESI-MS) using a 75-micron diameter capillary column packed with Poros C4 or C18 reverse-phase 10 micron beads. Flow was driven by a Rainin HPLC on-line with a Fisons Quatro triple quadrupole. Flow splitting was achieved using an Accurate microflow processor with a final flow output of 400 nl/min. Further MS analysis was conducted on HPLC-separated proteolytic fragments using a Finnigan Ion-trap MS. HPLC analysis was conducted using a Waters 600E-486 HPLC and 250 × 4.6-mm Phenomenex C5 10-micron reverse phase (RP) column. MS/MS analysis was performed with the Fisons ESI-MS. The assignment of selected peptides was confirmed by selectively passing the respective ion species into the collision cell and inducing fragmentation into daughter ions. Observed masses were assigned to the GlyR sequence with the aid of Sherpa software (19.Taylor J.A. Walsh K.A. Johnson R.S. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 10: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Recombinant α1 GlyR was reconstituted into small unilamellar vesicles and digested with proteolytic enzyme for various times ranging from 10 min to 24 h. HPLC profiles and SDS-PAGE of digest products indicated that a large portion of GlyR remained undigested or only partially cleaved (data not shown). Soluble peptide products were separated from membrane-associated peptide products by ultracentrifugation. Membrane-associated products were delipidated prior to microcapillary RP-HPLC on-line with nanospray ESI-MS in order to rapidly separate and identify proteolytic fragments. In addition, conventional RP-HPLC was utilized to isolate fragments for ESI-tandem MS. The resulting accessibility data, when coupled with partitioning information (i.e. whether the peptide was recovered in soluble form or in lipid pellets), was used to map the topology of the GlyR. A representative trace of total ion current for a capillary RP-HPLC separation and a resulting MS spectrum and fragmentation of a selected mass ion by CID are shown in Fig.1. CID spectra of selected mass ions are shown in Fig. 2. Comparison of the cleavage pattern as a function of incubation times yielded no obvious correlations.Figure 2Selected CID spectra. For all spectra, the assigned internal fragments and a, b, andy ions are shown with the assigned charge shown in superscript (unless it is singly charged) and any adducts noted (e.g. K+ adduct, losses of hydration, carbonyl, or ammonium).

CID spectra are for membrane-associated peptides withm/z ratio of 601.3, assigned to residues 173–194 (A); 356.3, assigned to residues 181–192 (B); and 652.2, assigned to residues 224–234 (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Analyses of soluble digest products yielded a wide spectrum of fragments (Table I, part A, and Fig. 3). These peptides ionized easily relative to the membrane-associated fragments. Most of the postulated N-terminal domain (residues 1–218) was detected, and for the most part these fragments partition in the aqueous supernatant (Fig. 3 A). No peptides between residues 34 and 80 were detected in this study. However, any peptides isolated from this region would be expected to partition in the aqueous fractions since extracellularly accessible residues throughout this region have been identified by other investigators in both the GlyR and the nAchR. Within this region, α1 GlyR is glycosylated at Asn-38 (it is suspected that heterogeneity of the sugar moieties may be responsible for the absence of identifiable peptides in this region). There are recognition sites for GlyR-derived monoclonal antibodies (20.Schröder S. Hoch W. Becker C.-M. Grenningloh G. Betz H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and portions of this region are the main immunogenic region in the nAchR. Several Lys residues (corresponding to Pro-36, Asn-42, Ile-62, and Asn-69 in α1 GlyR) of nAchR subunits may be labeled with a soluble reagent (21.Watty A. Weise C. Dreger M. Franke P. Hucho F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and this area in nAchR has been identified as targets in earlier proteolytic studies (22.Moore C.R. Yates I.J.R. Griffin P.R. Shabanowitz J. Martino P.A. Hunt D.F. Cafiso D.S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9184-9191Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, the region between residues 149 and 191 was conspicuously absent from the soluble fractions and was solely identified as membrane-associated peptides (Table I, part B, and Fig. 3 A) and is discussed below.Table IMass ion peaks of proteolysis fragments and respective sequence assignmentsA.

Overlapping fragments in the region of 314–389 corresponding to the postulated cytoplasmic loop (residues 309–392) ionized very strongly and were detected in both soluble and membrane-associated fractions. This region is assigned to be entirely cytoplasmic since it flanks a phosphorylation site at Ser-391 (23.Ruiz-Gómez A. Vaello M.L. Valdivieso F. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 559-566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is the region of the gephyrin-binding site in the homologous β subunit (24.Meyer G. Kirsch J. Betz H. Langosch D. Neuron. 1995; 15: 563-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) (the peripherally associated gephyrin protein is a cytoskeletal linking element). Also, several other cytoplasmic proteins have been found to bind to various LGICS members in this region, and soluble peptides in this region have been identified in earlier proteolytic studies conducted on nAchR (22.Moore C.R. Yates I.J.R. Griffin P.R. Shabanowitz J. Martino P.A. Hunt D.F. Cafiso D.S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9184-9191Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Table I, part B, lists peptides assigned to masses identified in membrane-associated fractions. Membrane-associated peptides were empirically defined as ones that partitioned with the lipid pellet upon ultracentrifugation after proteolysis. Comparison with overlapping soluble proteolysis products allows one to reduce the assigned maximum length of a transmembrane segment (Fig. 3 B). A subset of membrane-associated peptides had comparable peptide products (not necessarily identical) that were also detected in the aqueous supernatant. Since peptides in these regions may be extracted from the membrane-associated compartment in the absence of detergents, it is assumed that they do not span the bilayer as a TM segment but rather are peripherally associated with the membrane surface or non-covalently associated with lipid-associated protein. Peptides that contained residues 81–91, 201–217, and 314–389 were of this class. It is difficult to assess the extent of the association since very low residual concentrations of these peptides may be detected because of their high ionization capacity and the sensitivity of MS (on the order of femtomoles). In control experiments where Staphylococcus aureus nuclease (kindly provided by Dr. R. O. Fox), a soluble protein, was proteolyzed in the presence of phospholipid, centrifuged, and washed, soluble proteolysis fragments could be detected in phospholipid pellet fractions by MS (data not shown). In these cases, the overall spectra of pelleted membrane-associated fractions were identical to that of the soluble fraction, but the total ion current was significantly diminished (consistent with a residual nonspecific presence). Unlike the case with nuclease where every mass peak was observed in both phases, GlyR digests primarily yielded similar overlapping fragments that specifically and consistently partitioned in only soluble or lipid-pellet fractions (TableI). Further investigation with GlyR will be required to resolve the nature of the associations for fragments that were detected in both phases. Another potential difficulty in interpreting the results of the proteolytic studies arises if small fractions of the reconstituted GlyRs are in a non-native fold. We consider this unlikely since all reconstituted receptors exhibit strychnine binding and competitive elution with glycine as a requisite step in affinity purification, and routine assay of the activity of the GlyR reconstituted in small unilamellar vesicles indicated that the protein retained total activity.2 Therefore, we assume all observed peaks arise from proteolysis of native receptors. We were also careful to select proteolytic conditions such that the majority of the GlyR remained undigested; cleavages reflect residue accessibility of native receptors and not secondary sites accessible due to subsequent unfolding of initial digest products to a non-native fold. However, since mass spectrometry is an exquisitely sensitive tool and non-quantitative under the experimental conditions, it remains a possibility that some mass species may arise from strongly ionized proteolytic fragments of denatured receptors. We also assume a 5-fold symmetry for the receptor, and we consider each α subunit in the pentamer to be identical and have equivalent accessibility profiles. Although this is not the case in heteromeric LGICS receptors (e.g. the two α subunits in the α2βγδ nicotinic acetylcholine receptor are not equivalent), we propose that any deviations from strict 5-fold symmetry in our homomeric assemblies would be minor and would not affect the interpretation of our results. Unexpectedly, overlapping fragments between residues 149 and 191 were detected solely in membrane-associated fractions. This region includes residues 160 and 161 that have been reported to be essential in maintaining strychnine antagonism (25.Vandenberg R.J. French C.R. Barry P.H. Shine J. Schofield P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1765-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Within this region, solvent accessibility is defined by cleavage sites detected after residues 157, 165, 169, 172, and 180. In addition, there is a disulfide linkage between cysteine residues 138 and 152. The following membrane-associated fragments were identified: 142–165, 144–200, 149–165, 158–165, 158–169, 173–191, 173–194 (see Fig.2 A for CID spectrum), and 181–192 (see Fig. 2 Bfor CID spectrum). From this pattern, amino acid stretches within residues 158–165 and 181–191 may minimally define the regions responsible for membrane association (fragments explicitly corresponding to residues 149–157, 166–169, 170–172, and 173–180 were not detected in either phase, and these residues were only detected as part of larger fragments that include either 158–165 and/or 181–191). Therefore, we cannot definitively determine the nature of the association of peptides outside the 158–165 and 181–191 region. One may hypothesize two topological scenarios for the region within 149–191. First, this region may include peptides that span the bilayer in an even number of times since this region is closely flanked by the extracellular disulfides at Cys-138 to Cys-152 and Cys-198 to Cys-209. This scenario is highly unlikely since soluble nAchR N-terminal domain monomers have been expressed and studied (26.West Jr., A.P. Bjorkman P.J. Dougherty D.A. Lester H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25468-25473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We have also overexpressed the N-terminal domain of the GlyR in soluble form (but under low salt conditions, overexpressed protein was found to partition mostly with cellular membranes).2 A second and more plausible scenario is that this region includes residues that are intimately associated with, but do not span, the bilayer. Of note, the sequence between residues 158 and 191 has homology to the sequence of the re-entrant loop reported in non-NMDA glutamate receptors (27.Sutcliffe M.J. Wo G.W. Oswald R.E. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1575-1589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (Fig.4). We speculate that this region may have a similar membrane association in the LGICS and may be a re-entrant loop. Regions flanking the loop may be membrane-associated due to protein-protein interactions with this loop. In any case, regardless of the nature of their association with the membrane, our results suggest an intimate association of the N-terminal extracellular domain with the transmembrane domain. Peptides located within the proposed M1, M3, and M4 regions were found to partition solely with the membrane component and, along with M2, are proposed to define transmembrane segments (peptides corresponding to M2 were not detected under any conditions). Several proteolytic cleavages were detected within regions that would be expected to be protected from proteolysis (i.e. sequestered within the bilayer) in the topology proposed by the four-TM helix model (Fig. 3 A). Cleavages after Tyr-223 and Ile-234 (secondary cleavage sites for trypsin after auto-proteolysis) require solvent accessibility at these sites, in contrast to the four-TM helix model (M1, residues 219–246) which places these residues within the hydrocarbon interior of the bilayer (the CID spectrum assigned to residues 224–234 is shown in Fig. 2 C). Unfortunately, the remainder of M1, as well as M2 and the linking residues (residues 219–222 and 235–284), were not detected in these studies. This may be due to the tendency for hydrophobic peptides to form aggregates, that do not ionize well. There is a large body of biochemical evidence that in the LGICS, M2 (residues 253–274) forms the ion channel pore as an amphiphilic helix oriented from cytoplasm to extracellular matrix with a central kinked region (28.Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 29.Wilson G.G. Karlin A. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1269-1281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 30.Xu M. Akabas M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21505-21508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in order to maintain the orientation of M2, there must be an odd number of passes through the bilayer prior to M2. Transmembrane structures are invariably β-barrels or α-helices since these secondary structures are capable of self-satisfying their backbone hydrogen bonding potential. Therefore, it may be possible to assign secondary structure to transmembrane segments based on length constraints (e.g. an α-helix requires a minimum length of approximately 20 amino acids to span the bilayer a single time). Given the accessibility profile (cleavages after residues 217, 222, and 234), no segments prior to M2 are sufficient in length to be α-helical and instead are modeled as β-sheets. Since β-barrel membrane proteins have been found to contain TM β-sheets as short as six residues (31.Buchanan S.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), our data cannot differentiate between a single pass or three passes prior to M2 with one (possibly the only) transmembrane segment within residues 224–234. Cysteine-scanning mutagenesis studies conducted on this region in the nAchR indicate that in the closed state, residues corresponding to Ile-224, Gln-225, Met-226, and Pro-229 of GlyR were accessible to chemical modification which blocked channel activity (7.Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1231-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). If these residues were in a TM α-helix, it is difficult to visualize how three adjacent residues (224–226) could be solvent-accessible. We propose that these residues are extramembranous and may line the extracellular vestibule region of the receptor near the mouth of the channel, with a transmembrane β-strand initiated after residue 226. Cleavages were also detected within the proposed M3 TM helix (282–308), after residues 284 and 300 (a CID spectrum assigned to residues 285–300 is shown in Fig. 1 C). Given that the region within residues 314–391 must be entirely cytoplasmic (discussed above), an odd number of passes though the bilayer is required between M2 and M4. Once again, our data do not allow us to discriminate whether there is a single pass or three passes through the membrane in this region (residues 285–313). MS analyses identified two V8 proteolytic fragments corresponding to residues 285–300 and 285–313 that partitioned solely with the lipid pellet. Since a fragment corresponding to 301–313 was never detected, but only observed within larger membrane-associated peptides (residues 285–313 and 285–326), it cannot be determined whether this region contains a membrane-spanning segment (i.e. it is possible that residues 301–313 may be extramembranous and partition with the bilayer as a consequence of its linkage to a TM segment localized in residues 285–300). Regardless, the length of residues 285–300 or 301–313 is inconsistent with bilayer-spanning α-helices, and it is proposed that any TM segments in this region are β-strands, with at least one strand localized within the region defined by residues 285–300. V8 protease digests also yielded a fragment corresponding to residues 389–416, consistent with the proposed transmembrane M4 α-helix (residues 393–411). No internal cleavages were detected within this region (although this region is primarily hydrophobic and offers few potential targets for proteolysis). Given the reported pattern of lipophilic photoactivable reagent incorporation within the M4 region of nAchR (32.Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3738-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), the presence of a phosphorylation site at Ser-391, and the extracellular location of the C terminus, it is expected that a single TM α-helix is located within residues 392–416. In summary, this study provides the first evidence that the four-TM α-helix model for GlyR topology and, by homology, for the entire LGICS is inappropriate. Although these studies do not provide any direct information regarding secondary structure, the accessibility data do place upper limits on the length of any TM segments and thus allow some assignment of inferred secondary structural elements. We propose that the formerly postulated TM helices M1 and M3 each contain one or three TM β-sheets given the short length of membrane-spanning peptides in these areas. By using biochemical information from other studies conducted on other members of the LGICS, our data are consistent with M2 and M4 being α-helices. Therefore, the TM domain of these neuroreceptors are expected to be a mix of α-helices and β-sheets. In addition, this study also provides the first evidence that the N-terminal domain includes regions that are intimately associated with the plasma membrane. Because of the limitations of using proteases as structural probes, the novel topology described herein contains some uncertainties but is invaluable in providing a wealth of biochemical data as a framework for re-evaluation of previous biochemical studies and for subsequent models. Studies are currently being conducted to more finely characterize the topology of the GlyR. We thank Jannette Heere, Scott Young, and Brian Gribble for excellent technical assistance.

https://openalex.org/W1981432946,"Kinesin-like calmodulin-binding protein (KCBP) is a novel member of the kinesin superfamily that is involved in cell division and trichome morphogenesis. KCBP is unique among all known kinesins in having a myosin tail homology-4 region in the N-terminal tail and a calmodulin-binding region following the motor domain. Calcium, through calmodulin, has been shown to negatively regulate the interaction of KCBP with microtubules. Here we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify the proteins that interact with the tail region of KCBP. A protein kinase (KCBP-interacting protein kinase (KIPK)) was found to interact specifically with the tail region of KCBP. KIPK is related to a group of protein kinases specific to plants that has an additional sequence between subdomains VII and VIII of the conserved C-terminal catalytic domain and an extensive N-terminal region. The catalytic domain alone of KIPK interacted weakly with the N-terminal KCBP protein but strongly with full-length KCBP, whereas the noncatalytic region did not interact with either protein. The interaction of KCBP with KIPK was confirmed using coprecipitation assays. Using bacterially expressed full-length and truncated proteins, we have shown that the catalytic domain is capable of phosphorylating itself. The association of KIPK with KCBP suggests regulation of KCBP or KCBP-associated proteins by phosphorylation and/or that KCBP is involved in targeting KIPK to its proper cellular location.

Biol. 1994; 6: 63-68Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 2.Shroer T.A. Sheetz M.P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 629-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 3.Vale R.D. Fletterick R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 745-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The first kinesin was identified as a protein likely to be responsible for fast anterograde axonal transport (4.Moore J.D. Endow S.A. BioEssays. 1995; 18: 207-219Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Kinesin is a tetramer consisting of two heavy chains (KHCs) and two light chains (KLCs) with the motor activity being in the heavy chains (5.Goodson H.V. Kang S.J. Endow S.A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1875-1884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Vale R.D. Goldstein L.S. Cell. 1990; 60: 883-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) The heavy chain consists of three domains: a motor domain that contains conserved ATP and microtubule binding sites, a stalk domain that forms an α-helical coiled-coil, and a globular tail that binds the light chains. KLPs show sequence similarity to the conserved motor domain of the KHC, which consists of 320–340 amino acids (7.Bloom G.S. Endow S.A. Protein Profile. 1994; 1: 1059-1116PubMed Google Scholar). In kinesin, the motor domain is in the amino-terminal region of the heavy chain, whereas in KLPs the motor domain is found in the amino-terminal, carboxyl-terminal, or middle region (3.Vale R.D. Fletterick R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 745-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 4.Moore J.D. Endow S.A. BioEssays. 1995; 18: 207-219Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Outside the motor domain there is little homology between KLPs, but many contain an α-helical region predicted to form a coiled-coil. The tail regions are not conserved with respect to kinesin heavy chain or among members of the same KLP subfamilies. It is widely believed that the tail regions of the KLPs may associate with accessory proteins important for function (7.Bloom G.S. Endow S.A. Protein Profile. 1994; 1: 1059-1116PubMed Google Scholar). The unique tail domains of the KLPs are thought to be responsible for the varied microtubule-based functions of the conserved motor domain (6.Vale R.D. Goldstein L.S. Cell. 1990; 60: 883-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). About 193 sequences containing the kinesin motor domain have been deposited into the data bases. Multiple KLPs have been identified in several organisms (Caenorhabditis elegans (19 KLPs), Drosophila melanogaster (14 KLPs), Homo sapiens (20 KLPs), Mus musculus (36 KLPs), andArabidopsis thaliana (21 KLPs)). The challenge facing researchers now is to elucidate the function of these multiple microtubule motor proteins and their regulation. Although it is widely believed that the tail region of KLPs performs its function(s) by interacting with other proteins, in most cases the proteins that interact with the tail region have not been identified. In the case of KHC, the tail region has been shown to interact with KLCs (8.Gauger A.K. Goldstein L.S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13657-13666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Johnson C.S. Buster D. Scholey J.M. Cell Motil.

Another protein called kinectin also interacts with KHC (11.Toyoshima I., Yu, H. Steuer E.R. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Kinectin was isolated from chick embryo brain microsomes and was localized to the cytoplasmic face of the microsomes. A cDNA clone for kinectin was isolated from a chick embryo cDNA library by immunoscreening with mAbs to kinectin (12.Yu H. Nicchitta C.V. Kumar J. Becker M. Toyoshima I. Sheetz M.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Studies using antibodies to kinectin inhibited plus-end-directed vesicle motility by approximately 90% and reduced kinesin binding to vesicles (13.Kumar J., Yu, H. Sheetz M.P. Science. 1995; 267: 1834-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Using yeast two-hybrid methods, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases MLK2 and MLK3 were found to interact with the kinesin, KIF3 (14.Nagata K. Puls A. Futter C. Aspenstrom P. Schaefer E. Nakata T. Hirokawa N. Hall A EMBO J. 1998; 17: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Another yeast two-hybrid interaction study showed an interaction between an actin-based vesicle-transport motor, MyoVA, and a microtubule-based motor, KhcU (15.Huang J.D. Brady S.T. Richards B.W. Stenolen D. Resau J.H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nature. 1999; 397: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Microtubule-based motility is known to be precisely regulated. This regulation could be due to the regulation of the motor protein, the microtubules or both components of the system (16.Thaler C.D. Haimo L.T. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1996; 164: 269-327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies on the regulation of kinesin and KLPs have focused mainly on phosphorylation of KHC, KLC, and kinesin-interacting proteins (7.Bloom G.S. Endow S.A. Protein Profile. 1994; 1: 1059-1116PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Thaler C.D. Haimo L.T. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1996; 164: 269-327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Haimo L.T.

Phosphorylation of these proteins can affect their motor activity or their ability to interact with organelles or other proteins. Phosphorylation has been shown to be involved in cell cycle regulation of kinesin and KLPs (18.Robertson A.M. Allan V.J. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1997; 3: 59-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 19.Nigg E.A. Blangy A. Lane H.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The protein kinase or family of kinases responsible for phosphorylation has not been established in all cases. Two kinases have been shown to phosphorylate specific KLPs. A human KLP, HsEg5, has been shown to be phosphorylated by the cyclin-dependent protein kinase, p34 cdc2, specifically during mitosis (20.Blangy A. Lane H.A. d'Herin P. Harper M. Kress M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 1159-1169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation controls the association of HsEg5 with the spindle apparatus. A murine protein kinase, PLK, which reaches its maximum activity at the onset of mitosis, appears to interact with and phosphorylate CHO1/mitotic kinesin-like protein 1 (21.Lee K.D. Hollenbeck P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5600-5605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Recently a KLP, kinesin-like calmodulin-binding protein (KCBP), was isolated from Arabidopsis and other flowering plants using a protein-protein interaction-based screening with calmodulin as a probe (22.Reddy A.S. Safadi F. Narasimhulu S.B. Golovkin M. Hu X. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7052-7060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 23.Reddy A.S. Narasimhulu S.B. Safadi F.

Biol. 1996; 31: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). KCBP has two unique domains: a calmodulin-binding domain at the C terminus following the motor domain and a myosin tail homology domain in the tail (22.Reddy A.S. Safadi F. Narasimhulu S.B. Golovkin M. Hu X. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7052-7060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 23.Reddy A.S. Narasimhulu S.B. Safadi F. Golovkin M.

Kluher Academic Publishers, New York2000Google Scholar). KCBP binds calmodulin in a calcium-dependent manner at physiological calcium concentration (22.Reddy A.S. Safadi F. Narasimhulu S.B. Golovkin M. Hu X. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7052-7060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and the binding of calmodulin inhibits KCBP from binding microtubules or dissociates the preformed KCBP-microtubule complex (28.Deavours B.E. Reddy A.S. Walker R.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 40: 408-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 29.Narasimhulu S.B. Kao Y.L. Reddy A.S. Plant J. 1997; 12: 1139-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 30.Narasimhulu S.B. Reddy A.S. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 957-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Until recently, no other KLP had been known to bind calmodulin, and a KCBP homologue had not been found in animals including C. elegans whose genome has been completely sequenced. Using a PCR screen for kinesins in sea urchin, Rogerset al. (31.Rogers G.C. Hart C.L. Wedaman K.P. Scholey J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) isolated a kinesin (kinesin-C) with a calmodulin-binding domain. Although it has sequence similarity in the motor and calmodulin-binding domains with KCBP, it does not contain the myosin tail homology-4 and talin-like regions present in the N-terminal portion of KCBP. Many KLPs are involved in chromosome distribution and spindle function. Some of the functions include separation of microtubule organizing centers for spindle formation, spindle assembly, spindle elongation, and maintenance of spindle bipolarity and spindle pole integrity (1.Hoyt M.A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 6: 63-68Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 7.Bloom G.S. Endow S.A. Protein Profile. 1994; 1: 1059-1116PubMed Google Scholar,32.Vernos I. Karsenti E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 4-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Vernos and Karsenti (32.Vernos I. Karsenti E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 4-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 33.Vernos I. Karsenti E. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 297-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) proposed that kinetochore KLPs may tether the ends of growing and shrinking microtubules to kinetochores during chromosome movements. Immunolocalization studies indicated the involvement of KCBP in cell division (34.Smirnova E.A. Reddy A.S. Bowser J. Bajer A.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 41: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 35.Bowser J. Reddy A.S. Plant J. 1997; 12: 1429-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It was also shown that KCBP is differentially active during the various phases of cell division in Tradescantia stamen hair cells (36.Voss J.W. Safadi F. Reddy A.S.N. Hepler P.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 373aCrossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). KCBP was found to be capable of bundling microtubules, suggesting the involvement of KCBP in establishing mitotic microtubule arrays during different stages of the cell cycle (37.Kao Y.L. Deavours B.E. Phelps K.K. Walker R.A. Reddy A.S. Biochem Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Genetic studies have shown that KCBP is essential for trichome morphogenesis (38.Oppenheimer D. Pollock M. Vacik J. Szymanski D. Ericson B. Feldmann K. Marks M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6261-6266Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 39.Krishnakumar S. Oppenheimer D.G. Development. 1999; 126: 3079-3088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). KCBP mutants (zwichel) had shorter and less branched trichomes (38.Oppenheimer D. Pollock M. Vacik J. Szymanski D. Ericson B. Feldmann K. Marks M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6261-6266Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Three extragenic suppressors (“suppressor of zwichel-3”; suz1,suz2, and suz3) that rescued trichome branch number defect were isolated (39.Krishnakumar S. Oppenheimer D.G. Development. 1999; 126: 3079-3088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic studies have shown that SUZ2 may interact with not only ZWI (KCBP) but also with FURCAI, a protein involved in trichome branching. These suppressor studies suggest that KCBP interacts with several other proteins in the cell (27.Reddy A.S. Sopory S.K. Oelmuller R. Maheshwari S.C. Signal Transduction in Plants: Current Advances. Kluher Academic Publishers, New York2000Google Scholar, 40.Reddy, A. S. (2000) Int. Rev. Cytol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Because the tail region of KLPs is implicated in interacting with other proteins as either cargo or regulator and because the genetic evidence suggests that KCBP interacts with other proteins (39.Krishnakumar S. Oppenheimer D.G. Development. 1999; 126: 3079-3088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we used the yeast two-hybrid screen to isolate proteins that interact with KCBP. Here we report that the N-terminal region of KCBP interacts with a protein kinase, termed KCBP-interacting protein kinase (KIPK). It has homology to a group of protein kinases that appears to be unique to plants. We have confirmed the interaction in vitro and have demonstrated autophosphorylation of KIPK. A. thaliana L. Heynh. ecotype Columbia was grown at 22 °C on a mixture of peat/perlite/vermiculite (1:1:1) under continuous light. Leaves, stems, and flowers were collected from 5–6-week-old plants. Roots were grown in liquid cultures as described earlier (41.Reddy A.S.N. Safadi F. Beyette J. Mykles D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Suspension-cultured cells from the same ecotype were grown in Murashige and Skogg salts supplemented with vitamins, 3% sucrose, and 0.5 μg/ml 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. The pAS1CYH2/N-terminal KCBP plasmid was constructed by cloning a SacI/NotI fragment (amino acids 12–1261) of Arabidopsis KCBP into pET32b (30.Narasimhulu S.B. Reddy A.S. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 957-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This plasmid was then cut with NcoI, releasing a 2.8-kilobase fragment (amino acids 12–924), which was ligated into pAS1CYH2 digested with NcoI. Full-lengthArabidopsis KCBP/pAS1CYH2 was made by cutting the pAS1CYH2/N-terminal KCBP with AvrII and SalI and dropping the fragment. Full-length Arabidopsis KCBP in pET28 (29.Narasimhulu S.B. Kao Y.L. Reddy A.S. Plant J. 1997; 12: 1139-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was also cut with AvrII and SalI. The fragment was isolated and ligated into the pAS1CYH2AvrII/SalI-cut plasmid. The expression plasmid for KIPK was constructed by excising KIPK from pACT-KIPK with XhoI and ligating it into pET32a (Novagen) also cut with XhoI. Preparation of KCBP N-terminal construct in pET28 and its expression was described previously (29.Narasimhulu S.B. Kao Y.L. Reddy A.S. Plant J. 1997; 12: 1139-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Subclones of KIPK were made using PCR-generated fragments. Primers were designed to amplify an N-terminal fragment from amino acids 1–347 and a C-terminal fragment from amino acids 323–744. A BamHI site was included in the 5′ primers, and a XhoI site was included in the 3′ primers. Primers used were KIPK1S (5′-CGGGATCCGATGCCTGTAAACGATAAACC-3′), KIPK1A (5′-CCGCTCGAGAGTGTCGTAAACCCAAAGAGCC-3′), KIPK2S (5′-CGGGATCCCATGTCGATGGATGTAGATGGG-3′), and KIPK2A (5′-CCGCTCGAGACTCAAGATGATCGCCTATGGC-3′). pET32b and the PCR-generated fragments were cut with BamHI andXhoI, ligated, and used to transform Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Subclones were cut from pET32b usingNcoI and XhoI and ligated intoNcoI/XhoI-cut pACT2. All clones were sequenced to confirm the accuracy of the PCR product and in-frame ligation. A motor domain subclone of KCBP was constructed by PCR amplification of a C-terminal fragment coding for amino acids 860–1261, including the motor domain, calmodulin binding domain, and a small portion of the coiled-coil region (23.Reddy A.S. Narasimhulu S.B. Safadi F. Golovkin M. Plant J. 1996; 10: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The primers included a site forBspHI, which when cut has ends compatible withNcoI. pAS1CYH2 was digested with NcoI, and the fragment was digested with BspHI; they were ligated and used to transform E. coli (DH5α) Competent cells were prepared by inoculating several colonies of yeast strain Y190 into YPD (12 g/liter peptone, 10 g/liter yeast extract, 2% dextrose) plus cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) or colonies of transformed Y190 in appropriate SD (6.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco), 2% dextrose, and 1× dropout solution minus Trp or minus Leu (CLONTECH)), vortexing vigorously, and incubating at 30 °C with shaking overnight. Cultures were then transferred to 50 ml of YPD/cycloheximide or SD lacking Trp or Leu and incubated at 30 °C overnight with shaking. Cultures were diluted with 250 ml of YPD and incubated at 30 °C with shaking at 250 rpm for 3 h. Cells were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of sterile water and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature. The pellet was then resuspended in 1.5 ml of freshly prepared, sterile 1× TE/LiAc (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm lithium acetate, pH 7.5). For library transformation of Y190-KCBP, 5 μg of anArabidopsis cDNA library, 0.1 mg of salmon sperm carrier DNA, and 0.1 ml of Y190-KCBP-competent cells were added to 16 separate tubes; the contents were mixed well. For transformation with plasmid DNA from constructs, 0.1 μg of plasmid DNA was mixed with 0.1 mg of salmon sperm carrier DNA, and 0.1 ml of competent cells was added to each tube. For double transformations, 0.1 μg of each construct was added to 0.1 mg of salmon sperm carrier DNA, and 0.1 ml of competent cells was added and transformed as described (CLONTECH manual). Approximately 100 μl of transformed cells was spread on SD plates containing 20 g/liter agar and −Trp dropout for pAS1CYH2 transformations, −Leu dropout for pACT transformations, and −Trp, −Leu, −His dropout plus 25 mm3-aminotriazole for transformations with the library or both pACT and pAS1CYH2 plasmids. Plates were incubated 3–8 days at 30 °C. Colonies were either patched to new plates or used as grown for assays. Sterile filters (Whatman number 5) were soaked in Z buffer/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside solution (prepared according to the CLONTECHmanual) and placed over the surface of the plates containing transformants. Filters were carefully lifted, transferred (colonies facing up) into liquid nitrogen, completely submerged for 10 s, and then allowed to thaw at room temperature. Filters were then placed on top of filters freshly soaked in Z buffer/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside solution and incubated at room temperature until blue color appeared. Yeast transformants were grown in 5 ml of the appropriate SD, and plasmids were isolated using a kit from Zymo Research according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. The culture was incubated at 30 °C with shaking until saturated. For protein isolation, overnight cultures of transformant yeast colonies were used to inoculate 100 ml of appropriate SD, which were grown overnight at 30 °C. Cells were spun at 5,000 rpm for 5 min and resuspended in a small portion of the medium. The cells were transferred to flat-bottom, O-ring screw cap microcentrifuge tubes and spun. After aspiration of the medium, the cells were resuspended in 40 μl of Laemmli buffer and 400 μl of acid-washed beads and vortexed two times for 1 min each. An additional 460 μl of Laemmli buffer was added, and tubes were transferred to boiling water for 3 min. Following chilling on ice, the tubes were spun at high speed for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was transferred to a clean tube and stored at −20 °C. Sequences on either side of the multiple cloning site of pACT were used to design primers for sequencing. Primers were 5′-TACCACTACAATGGATGATG-3′ (pACT5′) and 5′-GTTGAAGTGAACTTGCGGGG-3′, (pACT3′). The clone was sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method using double-stranded plasmid DNA as a template. Sequence data from the initial sequencing was used to construct subsequent primers to sequence the clone from end to end in both directions. Subclones were sequenced to verify in frame insertion of sequence. AnArabidopsis genomic DNA blot was prepared and probed with KIPK as described earlier (42.Golovkin M. Reddy A.S.N. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1637-1647PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA from different organs and tissues was isolated and purified on a CsCl cushion (43.Sambrook J. Fritsch F.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated by an oligo(dT)-cellulose column. First strand cDNA was synthesized using Promega's Reverse Transcription System (44.Day I.S. Reddy A.S. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The first strand cDNA was used in a PCR using primers specific to the C-terminal half of KIPK (KIPK2S and KIPK2A). The PCR product was separated electrophoretically on an 0.8% gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and probed with32P-labeled KIPK sequence. BL21(DE3) cells transformed with either pET28b-Arabidopsis KCBP or pET32a-Arabidopsis KIPK were cultured to anA 600 of approximately 0.6. Expression of protein was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a concentration of 0.2 mm. Induced cells were grown overnight at room temperature with constant shaking. Bacteria were harvested and resuspended in ice-cold 1× T7 tag bind/wash buffer (10× T7 buffer: 42.9 mm Na2HPO4, 14.7 mm KH2PO4, 27 mm KCl, 1.37M NaCl, 1% Tween 20, 0.02% sodium azide, pH 7.3) for KCBP protein or ice-cold 1× S tag bind/wash buffer (10× S tag buffer: 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) for KIPK protein. Lysozyme (200 μg/ml) and Complete Protease Inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added to each sample, and samples were placed on ice for 1 h and sonicated on ice five times for 15 s. Lysate was centrifuged at 18,000 rpm for 30 min. Protein was stored at 4 °C. Crude extract (2 ml) of KCBP protein was added to 150 μl of T7 tag antibody-agarose (Novagen) and incubated with shaking at room temperature for 30 min. The agarose beads were washed three times with 1× T7 tag bind/wash buffer, and 2 ml of KIPK crude protein was added to the agarose beads and incubated as above. KIPK crude protein alone was also added to T7 tag antibody-agarose beads that were not incubated with KCBP. Both sets of agarose beads were washed three times. Following the final wash, 75 μl of 1× sample loading buffer was added to the beads. Twenty-five μl was loaded on each of three polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed. One gel was stained, and two were blotted and probed with either T7 tag antibody or S tag protein. KIPK (full-length and subclone 2-catalytic domain) and amino-terminal KCBP proteins were expressed and isolated as above. The proteins were bound by S tag-agarose beads or T7 tag-agarose beads, respectively (Novagen). For one set of phosphorylation experiments, full-length KIPK protein bound to S tag beads was mixed with amino-terminal KCBP bound to T7 tag beads, subclone 1 (noncatalytic domain) protein bound to S tag beads, or water. Phosphorylation assays were performed in a buffer (20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 6 mm MgCl2) containing 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mm ATP, and [γ-32P]ATP at room temperature for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by adding protein sample buffer, and reaction mixtures were electrophoresed on acrylamide gels, blotted to a membrane, and exposed to a phosphor imaging screen. A second set of phosphorylation reactions was performed essentially as above except that the catalytic domain of KIPK bound to S tag beads was used. To identify KCBP-interacting proteins, we employed the yeast two-hybrid system (45.Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J.

To avoid isolation of tubulin and calmodulin, the N-terminal end of ArabidopsisKCBP comprising the “tail” and the coiled-coil region but not the motor or calmodulin binding domain was used as the “bait” in the screen. An A. thaliana cDNA library consisting of clones in pACT as fusions to the activation domain of Gal4 was screened using the amino-terminal domain (amino acids 12–806) of KCBP in pAS1CYH2 as a fusion to the DNA binding domain of Gal4. Approximately 106 transformants were plated on selection plates (synthetic complete minus His, Leu, and Trp). Transformants growing on these plates were screened for β-galactosidase activity using a filter assay (48.Schneider S. Buchert M. Hovens C.M.

https://openalex.org/W2039685495,"A monomeric form of human interleukin 10 (IL-10M1) has been engineered for detailed structure-function studies on IL-10 and its receptor complexes. Wild type IL-10 (wtIL-10) is a domain swapped dimer whose structural integrity depends on the intertwining of two peptide chains. wtIL-10 was converted to a monomeric isomer by inserting 6 amino acids into the loop connecting the swapped secondary structural elements. Characterization of IL-10M1 by mass spectroscopy, size exclusion chromatography, cross-linking, and circular dichroism shows that IL-10M1 is a stable alpha-helical monomer at physiological pH whose three-dimensional structure closely resembles one domain of wtIL-10. As previously reported, incubation of wtIL-10 with a soluble form of the IL-10Ralpha (sIL-10Ralpha) generates a complex that consists of 2 wtIL-10 molecules and 4 sIL-10Ralphas. In contrast, IL-10M1 forms a 1:1 complex with the sIL-10Ralpha. Characterization of the interaction using isothermal titration calorimetry confirmed the 1:1 stoichiometry and yielded a dissociation constant of 30 nm with an apparent binding enthalpy of -12.2 kcal/mol. Despite forming a 1:1 complex, IL-10M1 is biologically active in cellular proliferation assays. These results indicate that the 1:1 interaction between IL-10M1 and IL-10Ralpha is sufficient for recruiting the signal transducing receptor chain (IL-10Rbeta) into the signaling complex and eliciting IL-10 cellular responses."

MAGUKs play pivotal roles in the clustering and aggregation of receptors, ion channels, and cell adhesion molecules at the synapses. To investigate the physiological basis of hDlg interactions, we examined the self-association state of full-length hDlg as well as defined segments of hDlg expressed as recombinant proteins in bacteria and insect Sf9 cells.

Ultrastructural analysis of hDlg by low angle rotary shadow electron microscopy revealed that the full-length hDlg protein as well as its amino-terminal domain exhibits a highly flexible irregular shape. Further evaluation of the self-association state of hDlg using sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, and chemical cross-linking techniques confirmed that the oligomerization site of hDlg is contained within its amino-terminal domain.

The core primary structure of MAGUKs is composed of either one or three PDZ domains, a SH3 motif, and a carboxyl terminus domain homologous to the mammalian guanylate kinase (1.Woods D.F. Bryant P.J. Mech. Dev. 1993; 44: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). MAGUKs have been localized at the pre-synaptic and post-synaptic density and at the regions of cell to cell contact where they are thought to play an important role in the regulation of synaptic transmission and cell proliferation (6.Woods D.F.

This interaction is mediated by the binding of the HOOK domain of MAGUKs with the amino-terminal FERM domain of protein 4.1, thus providing a paradigm for localizing MAGUKs at the interface of membrane-cytoskeleton and at the sites of cell to cell contacts in epithelial cells (9.Lue R.A.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Unlike other MAGUKs, hDlg contains a unique amino-terminal domain of unknown function (9.Lue R.A. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9818-9822Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). As a result of alternative splicing-in of a 33-amino acid insertion-1, hDlg contains a proline-rich sequence near its amino terminus that has been shown to interact with the p56Lck tyrosine kinase (14.Hanada T. Lin L. Chandy K.G. Oh S.S. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26899-26904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The characterization of the PDZ domains of hDlg has established the ∼100-amino acid modules as sites of protein-protein interactions (15.Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 209-233PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). They either participate in homotypic association with other PDZ domains or recognize a consensus sequence T/SXV located at the carboxyl terminus of target protein (15.Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr.

The determination of their three-dimensional structure as well as elucidation of peptide sequences that bind to various PDZ domains has revealed the molecular basis of the specificity of PDZ domain interactions (17.Doyle D.A.

Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar). The third PDZ domain of PSD-95 binds a novel protein termed CRIPT that may anchor PSD-95 MAGUK to the tubulin-based cytoskeleton in excitatory synapses (20.Niethammer M. Valtschanoff J.G. Kapoor T.M. Allison D.W. Weinberg T.M. Craig A.M. Sheng M. Neuron. 1998; 20: 693-707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The first and second PDZ domains of hDlg form a conformationally stable module that binds to the carboxyl termini of several transmembrane and cytoplasmic proteins (5.Marfatia S.M. Morais Cabral J.H. Lin L. Hough C. Bryant P.J. Stolz L. Chishti A.H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 21.Lue R.A. Brandin E. Chan E.P. Branton D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1125-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The PDZ domain-mediated interaction of MAGUKs with ion channels, receptors, and cell adhesion proteins plays a critical role in the localization, aggregation, and clustering of these proteins at the synapses and neuromuscular junctions (22.Gomperts S.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 659-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Indeed, the co-expression of PSD-95/hDlg with ion channels and receptors in heterologous cells results in the clustering of ion channels and receptors at the cell surface, whereas these channels/receptors fail to assemble into clusters when expressed singly in heterologous cells (23.Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Further evidence for a direct role of MAGUKs in the clustering of ion channels and receptors comes from in vivo studies of theDrosophila discs large tumor suppressor (Dlg) protein (24.Tejedor F.J. Bokhari A. Rogero O. Gorczyca M. Zhang J. Kim E. Sheng M. Budnik V. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 152-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Dlg colocalizes with the Shaker-type K+ channels at the neuromuscular junction, and induces clustering of these ion channelsin vivo (24.Tejedor F.J. Bokhari A. Rogero O. Gorczyca M. Zhang J. Kim E. Sheng M. Budnik V. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 152-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the clustering of these channels is abolished in the Dlg loss-of-function mutants (24.Tejedor F.J. Bokhari A. Rogero O. Gorczyca M. Zhang J. Kim E. Sheng M. Budnik V. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 152-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Dlg has also been implicated in the clustering and stabilization of the transmembrane protein fasciclin II at the neuromuscular junctions (25.Thomas U. Kim E. Kuhlendahl S. Koh Y.H. Gundelfinger E.D. Sheng M. Garner C.C. Budnik V. Neuron. 1997; 19: 787-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar,26.Zito K. Fetter R.D. Goodman C.S. Isacoff E.Y. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1007-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Similarly, Dlg has been localized at the mammalian neuromuscular junctions and may function in the maintenance and organization of protein complexes at these junctions (27.Rafael J.A. Hutchinson T.L. Lumeng C.N. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Chamberlain J.S. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 2121-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The function of the centrally located SH3 domain of MAGUKs is poorly understood. These domains are predicted to recognize the proline-rich consensus sequence of proteins that presumably contribute to the formation of multiprotein complexes at the plasma membrane (28.Balda M.S. Anderson J.M. Matter K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 29.Hough C.D. Woods D.F. Park S. Bryant P.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3242-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The enzymatically inactive guanylate kinase-like domains of PSD-95 and hDlg interact with a family of closely related proteins termed GKAP/DAP-1β, SAPAP-1/DAP-1α, and SAPAP-2/DAP-2 (30.Kim E.

Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. Genes to Cells. 1997; 2: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The function of these proteins is not yet known. The observation that the multimeric APC tumor suppressor protein binds to hDlg raised an intriguing possibility that hDlg may self-associate in vivo(33.Matsumine A. Ogai A. Senda T. Okumura N. Satoh K. Baeg G.H. Kawahara T. Kobayashi S. Okada M. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. Science. 1996; 272: 1020-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The APC protein regulates cell proliferation by blocking the transition of cells from the Go/G1 phase to S phase (33.Matsumine A. Ogai A. Senda T. Okumura N. Satoh K. Baeg G.H. Kawahara T.

To investigate the self-association state of hDlg, we have examined the hydrodynamic properties of recombinant hDlg protein using a combination of biochemical and biophysical techniques. Here we report that the hDlg protein self-associates into dimeric and tetrameric species in solution, and that the self-association site is located within its unique amino-terminal domain. The following cDNA constructs encoding defined segments of hDlg were engineered (Fig. 1) (9.Lue R.A. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9818-9822Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). (i) Full-length hDlg1–926 (amino acids 1–926). (ii) Truncated hDlg termed hDlg201–904 (amino acids 201–904). This segment includes the three PDZ domains, the SH3 motif, the insertion-2, and the guanylate kinase-like domain. (iii) hDlg segment termed hDlg1–229 (amino acids 1–229) includes the unique amino-terminal domain and the proline-rich insertion-1 sequence. (iv) hDlg1–161 (Cys-66) (amino acids 1–161) segment contains the unique amino-terminal domain of hDlg. The cDNA for this segment was amplified using the primer pair Nf (sense, BamHI) 5′-GCTGGATCCATGCCGGTCCGGAAG; and Nr (antisense, EcoRI) 5′-GGCGAATTCCTTTATTGGTGAAAT. (v) Mutant hDlg1–161(C66S)segment where a single cysteine residue at position 66 was changed to serine by substituting guanine for cytosine using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Inc.). (vi) hDlg1–624 (amino acids 1–624) segment encodes a truncated form of hDlg lacking the carboxyl-terminal domain. This construct contained a substitution of cytosine to thymidine at position 2061 thus introducing a stop codon at amino acid 625 located within the SH3 domain. All cDNA constructs were cloned into pGEX-2T vector and verified by DNA sequencing. Recombinant fusion proteins carrying glutathione S-transferase (GST) at the amino terminus were expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α cells as described previously (35.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar). In addition, the cDNA constructs encoding hDlg1–161(Cys-66) and hDlg1–161(C66S) were subcloned into pFastBacHTb vector for expression in the insect Sf9 cells using the BAC-to-BAC Baculovirus Expression System (Life Technologies Inc.). The recombinant proteins expressed in Sf9 cells contained a histidine-tag attached to the amino terminus. Recombinant GST-hDlg fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose beads (35.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar). The GST portion of the fusion proteins was cleaved using thrombin (35.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar). Thrombin does not cleave recombinant proteins internally as has been demonstrated previously (5.Marfatia S.M. Morais Cabral J.H. Lin L. Hough C. Bryant P.J. Stolz L. Chishti A.H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The recombinant His-tagged proteins, designated asBVhDlg1–161(Cys-66) andBVhDlg1–161(C66S), were expressed in the insect Sf9 cells and affinity purified using Ni-NTA-agarose beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies Inc.). The recombinant fusion proteins were eluted from the beads using 100 mm imidazole. The amino-terminal His-tag sequence of the fusion proteins was then cleaved using the rTEV protease (Life Technologies Inc.). No internal cleavage site was predicted for rTEV protease, and incubation of cleaved proteins with rTEV protease for extended periods did not result in any further cleavage of the proteins. The cleaved recombinant hDlg proteins were dialyzed against buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 20 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 2.0 mmMgCl2) and purified on a Mono Q anion exchange column (fast protein liquid chromatography) using a linear gradient of NaCl (20–400 mm). The peak fractions containing pure protein were pooled, dialyzed, and concentrated in buffer B (20 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0 mmEGTA, 2.4 mm dithiothreitol). The dialyzed proteins were analyzed by gel permeation chromatography, electron microscopy, sedimentation velocity, and sedimentation equilibrium techniques. Purified hDlg proteins (30–60 μg) were analyzed by gel filtration chromatography on a Superose 12 column (HR 10/30; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer B at a flow rate of 15 ml/h. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (36.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207129) Google Scholar). Molecular mass standards were analyzed under the same conditions to generate a calibration curve. Peak fractions containing purified hDlg proteins were obtained from the Superose 12 column (fast protein liquid chromatography). Samples were analyzed using low angle rotary shadow electron microscopy (37.Tyler J.M. Branton D. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1980; 71: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Protein samples were reconstituted in 70% glycerol (phosphate-buffered saline), sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica, and rotary shadowed using platinum-carbon and carbon anodes. The replicas were floated and mounted on 400-mesh copper grids for electron microscopy (37.Tyler J.M. Branton D. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1980; 71: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Purified hDlg1–161(Cys-66)and BVhDlg1–161(Cys-66) proteins were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. Purified proteins at a concentration of 0.6–1.0 mg/ml were dialyzed in low salt buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1.0 mm2-mercaptoethanol), and analyzed on a Perceptive Biosystems Voyager MALDI instrument. Data were obtained by ionizing the protein sample in the presence of either sinapinic acid or 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid. The spectra were calibrated using two-point external calibration. Experiments were performed at 4 or 5 °C using a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with scanning absorbance optics. For sedimentation equilibrium runs samples were loaded into 12-mm path length Yphantis-type 6-channel centerpieces. The solution column height in each case was 1.5 mm. Rotor speeds were as follows: 10,000, 12,000 rpm (full-length hDlg1–926); 5,000 rpm (segment hDlg1–624); 7,000, 9,000, 11,000, and 15,000 rpm (segment hDlg1–229); 20,000 and 25,000 rpm (segment hDlg1–161(Cys-66) in the absence of DTT); 15,000 and 25,000 rpm (segment hDlg1–161(C66S) in the presence of DTT; segmentBVhDlg1–161(Cys-66) in the presence of DTT; segment BVhDlg1–161(C66S) in the absence of DTT). In all cases the rotor (An 60-Ti) was over-speeded to 40,000 or 47,000 rpm in order to deplete the solution column of macromolecular solute so that a true optical baseline could be obtained. The equilibrium solute distributions were recorded at either 280 or 277 nm, depending on the protein being studied. Equilibrium at each rotor speed was ascertained by the overlaying of scans acquired 3 h apart. The apparent whole cell weight average molecular mass (M w,app) was obtained by fitting the data with the equation describing the equilibrium distribution of a single thermodynamically ideal macromolecular solute (A r =A 0exp[H·M(r 2 − r02] + E) incorporated in the Beckman XL-A analysis software. This model is a subset of a broader model (Equation 1 (38.Kim H. Deonier R.C. Williams J.W. Chem. Rev. 1977; 77: 659-690Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar)) which was used initially to analyze self-interaction in solute systems where the elevated value ofM w,app above the known monomer molecular mass was indicative of some level of oligomeric behavior. Equation 1describes a self-associating system defined by up to three association constants (K a 2,K a 3,K a 4 in units of (absorbance)−(n-1) for oligomers composed ofn 2, n 3, andn 4 monomers,Ar=exp[lnA0+H·M(r2−r02)]+exp[n2lnA0+lnKa2Equation 1 +n2·H·M(r2−r02)]+exp[n3lnA0+lnKa3+n3·H·M(r2−r02)]+exp[n4lnA0+lnKa4+n4·H·M(r2−r02)]+Ewhere A r is the absorbance at radial positionr and A 0 the absorbance at a reference position r 0 (cm); H is the constant (1 − v̄ρ)ω2,v̄ is the partial specific volume of the macromolecule (ml/g); ρ is the solvent density (g/ml); ω is the rotor speed (radians/s); R is the gas constant (8.314 × 10−7 erg K−1 mol−1); T is the temperature (K); M is the molecular weight of the solute (g/mol); E is the optical baseline offset (obtained by over-speeding of the rotor). A system in which the elevation inM w,app is due solely to self-association should be describable by a single system of association constants. While the sedimentation equilibrium data for the hDlg proteins could be globally fitted with single self-association models the fits were improved if the K a values were allowed to vary for each data set. The need to use separate K a values can be indicative of the presence of incompetent monomer (i.e.monomer that cannot self-associate) or contaminant solute (or aggregate) that takes no part in the association but that nonetheless adopts an equilibrium solute distribution. The program PCNONLIN (39.Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar) which uses a more generalized form of Equation 1 was used to this end. For each hDlg segment a range of models was tested, starting with the simplest possible model that could conceivably result in the observed trend in reduced molecular weight data (i.e. M w,app). In each case data acquired for a range of loading concentrations and rotor speeds were fitted simultaneously with the chosen model. In most cases the association constants were then fitted separately in order to improve the fit. Fits obtained with this procedure were optimized by minimizing the variance and judged by the randomness and magnitude of the resultant residuals. Solvent densities were obtained from data tables (40.Weast R.C. Weast R.C. CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics. 67 Ed. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1986Google Scholar); partial specific volumes were calculated from the amino acid compositions of the protein solutes and data for the v̄ of these constituent amino acids (41.Perkins S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Sedimentation velocity data were acquired for three concentrations of segment hDlg1–161(C66S) in the presence of DTT, segmentBVhDlg1–161(Cys-66) in the presence of DTT, segment BVhDlg1–161(C66S) in the absence of DTT. Samples were loaded into double sector centerpieces. The rotor speed was 30,000 rpm for the highest concentration samples and 35,000 rpm for the lower two concentrations. Sixty scans were acquired in continuous scanning mode using 280 nm absorbance at 10-min intervals so that the data could be analyzed using the program DCDT (42.Stafford W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The best results were obtained by analysis of scans 21–40 alone. This yielded the unnormalized distribution function ĝ(s*) which is defined as follows.g^(s*)=∂c∂tcorrω2t2ln(rm/r)Equation 2 From this the weight average sedimentation, coefficient,s w, was derived,sw=1cp∫s*=0sp*s*g^(s*)ds*Equation 3 where c is concentration (in absorbance units),t is the equivalent time of sedimentation (s),r m is the radial position of the meniscus (cm),r is the radius (cm), c p is the concentration in the plateau region of the sedimentation velocity trace. The subscript corr indicates that the value of ∂c/∂t has been corrected as described by Stafford (43.Stafford W.F. Schuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhauser, Boston1994: 119-137Crossref Google Scholar). Copper phenanthroline catalyzed reversible cross-linking of hDlg proteins was carried out as described before (44.Siegel D.L. Branton D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 775-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The recombinant hDlg protein (30 μg) dialyzed in triethanolamine buffer (50 mm triethanolamine-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl) was incubated with 1.7 mmcopper sulfate and 3.4 mm O-phenanthroline either in the presence or absence of 24 mm DTT. After 2 h of incubation at room temperature, the oxidation reaction was stopped by the addition of 3.2 mm EDTA. The protein samples were incubated with SDS sample buffer in the absence of reducing agent for 20 min at 37 °C and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Amine cross-linking of the hDlg proteins was carried out using the NHS-esters, DSS (disuccinimidyl suberate) and BS3(bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate) (Pierce) as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, purified proteins were dialyzed against phosphate buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm EGTA), and incubated with an increasing concentration (up to 10-fold molar excess) of the cross-linker at room temperature for 30 min. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by the addition of 2.0 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, to a final concentration of 35.0 mm. The reaction mixture was incubated for 15 min at room temperature followed by the addition of SDS sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol. The cross-linked polypeptides were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. The full-length hDlg1–926 protein eluted as a considerably larger polypeptide (>440 kDa) from the Superose 12 column in contrast to its calculated molecular mass of 104 kDa (TableI). Based on this observation, the oligomerization state and molecular shape of the hDlg protein were investigated. A series of hDlg proteins were engineered and expressed as recombinant GST fusion proteins in bacteria (Fig.1). The GST portion was cleaved by thrombin, and recombinant proteins were purified by chromatography on the Mono Q anion-exchange column using the fast protein liquid chromatography. Purified hDlg proteins were then analyzed on a pre-calibrated gel filtration (Superose 12) column (Fig.2, Table I). The full-length hDlg1–926 protein eluted immediately after the void volume peak corresponding to an estimated size of ∼1400 kDa as calculated from the extrapolated calibration curve shown in Fig. 2. A similar elution behavior was observed for the hDlg1–624 segment lacking a portion of the SH3 motif and the carboxyl-terminal guanylate kinase-like domai"
https://openalex.org/W2030796996,"Lampreys, among the most primitive living vertebrates, have hemoglobins (Hbs) with self-association and ligand-binding properties very different from those that characterize the α2β2 tetrameric Hbs of higher vertebrates. Monomeric, ligated lamprey Hb self-associates to dimers and tetramers upon deoxygenation. Dissociation to monomers upon oxygenation accounts for the cooperative binding of O2 and its pH dependence. Honzatko and Hendrickson (Honzatko, R. B., and Hendrickson, W. A. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A 83, 8487–8491) proposed that the dimeric interface of the Hb resembles either the α1β2 interface of mammalian Hbs or the contacts in clam Hb where the E and F helices form the interface. Perutz (Perutz, M. F. (1989) Quart. Rev. Biophys. 2, 139- 236) proposed a version of the clam model in which the distal histidine swings out of the heme pocket upon deoxygenation to form a bond with a carboxyl group of a second monomer. The sedimentation behavior and oxygen equilibria of nine mutants of the major Hb component, PMII, from Petromyzon marinus have been measured to test these models. The results strongly support a critical role of the E helix and the AB corner in forming the subunit interface in the dimer and rule out the α1β2 model. The pH dependence of both the sedimentation equilibrium and the oxygen binding of the mutant E75Q indicate that Glu75 is one of two groups responsible for the Bohr effect. Changing the distal histidine 73 to glutamine almost completely abolishes the self-association of the deoxy-Hb and causes a large increase in O2 affinity. The recent x-ray crystallographic determination of the structure of deoxy lamprey Hb, reported after the completion of this work (Heaslet, H. A., and Royer, W. E. (1999) Structure 7, 517–526), shows that the dimer interface does involve the E helix and the AB corner, supporting the measurements and interpretations reported here.

Indeed, the low isoelectric points of the Hbs caused Svedberg and Eriksson (2.Svedberg T. Eriksson I.-B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1933; 55: 2834-2841Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar) to identify them with invertebrate Hbs for which they had revived the termerythrocruorin. 2Lankester (3.Lankester E.R. J. Anat. Physiol. 1868; 2: 114-116PubMed Google Scholar) designated “erythrocruorin” to include all red blood proteins of invertebrates, but soon abandoned the term (4.Lankester E.R. J. Anat. Physiol. 1869; 4: 119-129PubMed Google Scholar) after “hemoglobin,” first proposed by Hoppe-Seyler (5.Hoppe-Seyler F. Arch. Pathol. Anat. Physiol. Klinische Med. 1864; 29: 233-235Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), came into use.They found the Hbs to be monomeric, like myoglobins, rather than the tetramers characteristic of other vertebrates. However, Wald and Riggs (6.Wald G. Riggs A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1951; 35: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) found that oxygen equilibria of lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) Hb were strongly pH-dependent (Bohr effect), a surprising result at the time because oxygen equilibria of the monomeric myoglobins were pH-independent. Furthermore, they found that the oxygen equilibrium at pH 6.8 was slightly cooperative, with a Hill coefficient of 1.2, but dismissed this result as an artifact because cooperativity is impossible with monomeric Hbs. Briehl (7.Briehl R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 2361-2366Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) resolved this paradox by showing that deoxygenated lamprey Hb self-associates. Protonation accompanying the association accounts for the Bohr effect of O2 binding. Behlke and Scheler (8.Behlke J. Scheler W. FEBS Lett. 1970; 7: 177-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) showed with sedimentation velocity measurements that ligated Hb from a similar species of lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis) also self-associates, but only at low pH. Although the metHb was found to be monomeric, addition of metHb ligands such as azide or cyanide causes dimer formation at low pH (9.Behlke J. Scheler W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 15: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This property, oxidation-induced dissociation and ligand-dependent reassociation, absent in other vertebrate Hbs, but found in the Hbs of organisms of five invertebrate phyla, is another indication of the functional relationship of lamprey and invertebrate Hbs (10.Riggs A.F. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 1073-1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Andersen and Gibson (11.Andersen M.E. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4790-4799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Andersen M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 246: 4800-4806Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) showed by kinetic analysis of ligand binding by the Hb of P. marinus that the results could be accurately described by a model in which protonation of a single site per monomer with pK = 6.0 accompanied the formation of dimers of low O2 affinity. There was no need to include self-association beyond the dimer, so they concluded that higher aggregates may not be physiologically important. This conclusion was reinforced by sedimentation equilibria of the deoxy-Hb which indicated only very weak dimer-tetramer association. However, the conclusion that tetramers are physiologically insignificant was based on extrapolation of kinetic and sedimentation measurements at 10–60 μmconcentration to millimolar concentrations. Dohi et al. (13.Doi Y. Sugita Y. Yoneyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2354-2363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) extended the sedimentation measurements to concentrations of 3 mm with Hb from another species of lamprey,Entosphenus japonicus. Their results suggested that as much as 85% of the deoxy-Hb within red cells of this species would be tetrameric. The amino acid composition (13.Doi Y. Sugita Y. Yoneyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2354-2363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of E. japonicusglobin is virtually identical with that of P. marinus, which suggests that very few differences in amino acid sequence exist. The nature of the functionally important dimer of lamprey Hb has been uncertain. Although four different crystal forms of deoxy lamprey Hb have been identified (14.Hendrickson W.A. Love W.E. Murray G.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 829-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), none proved amenable to structure determination. Honzatko and Hendrickson (15.Honzatko R.B. Hendrickson W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8487-8491Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) proposed on the basis of model building that the interface in the deoxy-Hb dimer might resemble either the α1β2 interface charactistic of tetrameric vertebrate Hbs or that in the clam Scapharca in which the interface involves the E/F and A/B helices. Perutz (16.Perutz M.F. Quart. Rev. Biophys. 1989; 22: 139-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) noted that the pH dependence of O2 binding suggested participation of histidyl residues. Since the only two histidines present are the proximal and distal residues on each side of the heme, he proposed that the distal residue swings out of the heme pocket upon deoxygenation to form an electrostatic link with a carboxyl group of another monomer. This would raise the pK of the histidine and explain the Bohr effect. The goal of the present studies was to construct mutant Hbs by site-directed mutagenesis and measure the sedimentation and O2 binding properties in order to distinguish between two interface models. After completion of the experimental work, the x-ray structure of one form of dimeric deoxy-Hb of the adult has been reported which shows that the subunit interface is between the E helices and AB corners (17.Heaslet H.A. Royer W.E. Structure. 1999; 7: 517-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Our work now serves to confirm the functional significance of this structural feature (17.Heaslet H.A. Royer W.E. Structure. 1999; 7: 517-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Adult and larval lampreys (P. marinus) were obtained from the Hammond Bay Biological Station, Millersburg, MI. Blood from decapitated lampreys was collected in ice-cold 1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, with a small amount of heparin. Packed red cells, washed twice with this buffer, were frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The mRNA from adults was extracted with the Fast Track mRNA Isolation Kit, Version 3.5 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). mRNA (7 μl, 10 μg) was mixed with 3 μl of diethylpyrocarbonate-treated deionized water (dH2O) (3 μl) containing 500 ng of an oligo(dT) 28-mer containing an XbaI site at the 5′ end (number 1, TableI). The water was prepared by adding 100 μl of diethylpyrocarbonate (Sigma number D5758) to 100 ml of deionized water and shaking at 37 °C overnight. The annealing reaction was carried out by incubation of the mixture at 65 °C for 5 min, followed by cooling on ice. The following components were then added: RNasin (1 μl, 40 units/μl, Promega), 8 μl of 2.5 mm dNTP mixture, 10 μl of 5 × reverse transcription buffer (U. S. Biochemicals), 5 μl 0.1 mdithiothreitol (Life Technologies, Inc.), 14 μl diethylpyrocarbonate-dH2O, and 2 μl of reverse transcriptase (100 units/μl Moloney murine leukemia virus). After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, 5 μl of 3 m sodium acetate and 125 μl of 100% ethanol were added. After precipitation overnight at −20 °C, the resulting pellet was dissolved in 20 μl of diethylpyrocarbonate-dH2O.Table ISynthetic oligonucleotidesNo.SequenceaN: (A, C, G, T), R: puRine (A, G), H: (A, C, T), M (A, C).

Denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min was followed by 30 cycles of 1 min each at 94 °C for denaturing, 48 °C for annealing, 72 °C for elongation, and a final 15 min at 72 °C for complete elongation. Analysis of the PCR product by agarose gel electrophoresis showed a single band of 600 bp which was isolated by “Gene Clean” II Kit (BIO-101 Inc., Vista, CA) and cloned into the SmaI site of pUC19 and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method by using Sequenase Kit Version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical, Cleveland, OH). 5′ Rapid Amplification of 5′ cDNA End Kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to amplify the 5′ coding and untranslated sequences of the globin cDNA. Primer GSP1–5′ (number 3, Table I), complementary to the cDNA of PMII, was used in the reverse transcription reaction, and an oligo(dC) anchor sequence was added to the 5′ end of the cDNA using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase supplied in the RACE Kit. GSP1–5′ corresponds to residues 105–112 which are identical in PMI, II, and III (18.Hombrados I. Rodewald K. Neuzil E. Braunitzer G.

A nested PCR amplification was carried out using GSP2–5′ (Table I, number 4) and a deoxyinosine-containing Anchor Primer (AP) provided with the kit.

After obtaining the 5′ non-coding sequences of the cDNA, oligomer number 5, constructed to correspond to the 5′ non-coding region of both PMII and PMIII, together with oligo(dT), made amplifications of the complete cDNA sequences possible. The amplified cDNA products were blunt-ended by the addition of 1 μl of DNA Polymerase I Large Fragment (Klenow, 1 unit/μl, Promega) and incubating for 1 h at 37 °C. The amplified products were eluted after electrophoresis on a 1.0% agarose gel with the Gene Clean II Kit (BIO 101). Ligation with pUC19 cut with SmaI to give blunt ends was performed with the TaKaRa Ligation Kit (TaKaRa Biochemicals). The ligated product was cloned with MAX efficiency DH5α competent cells from Life Technologies, Inc. (catalog number 18258-012).

This was done by digesting pHE7 completely with NsiI and then partially digesting with NdeI to yield a 5.91-kilobase fragment that was purified by electrophoresis on a 0.7% agarose gel. The fragment was cut out and eluted from the gel with Gene Clean Kit (BIO 101, Inc.). The cDNA for globin component PMII was generated by PCR of the cDNA with two terminal primers (numbers 1001 and 1005, Table II) which are complementary to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the PMII cDNA and contain NdeI and NsiI sites, respectively. The resulting PCR product was ethanol precipitated, digested withNdeI and NsiI, and run on an agarose gel; the 450-bp product was eluted with the Gene Clean Kit and ligated to the 5.91-kilobase fragment of pHE 7 with the TaKaRa Ligation Kit (TaKaRa Biochemicals, Inc.). The 6.36-kilobase product (pHE7-PMHb) can coexpress both E. coli methionine aminoeptidase and the lamprey globin. The ligation product was used to transform JM109 competent cells (Promega, Madison, WI) and positive clones with inserts were selected. JM109 clone number 4 was used to express the lamprey PMII globin. The cDNA-derived amino acid sequence for clone 4 was identical to that of PMII (19.Hombrados I. Rodewald K. Allard M. Neuzil E. Braunitzer G. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1987; 368: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) except that position 86 was Val instead of Ala and is therefore designated PMII′. The recent crystallographic studies (17.Heaslet H.A. Royer W.E. Structure. 1999; 7: 517-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) indicate that this difference is unlikely to have any significant functional effect. All the mutagenesis utilized this clone. A single colony of JM109 cells with the pHE7 plasmid containing the cDNA for the globin was used to inoculate 2 ml of LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown for 8 h at 37 °C. A 160-μl aliquot of the culture was added to 40 ml of LB with ampicillin and grown overnight at 37 °C. A 10-ml aliquot of this culture was then added to 1 liter of TB with ampicillin in a 4-liter flask and shaken at 30 °C for about 5 h until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 1.0. Glucose (10 g/liter) and δ-aminolevulinic acid (20 mg/liter) was then added. Expression of Hb was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a concentration of 0.2 mm and continuing the incubation for 5 h at 30 °C. The centrifuged pellet from the culture was resuspended in 20 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C.Table IISynthetic oligonucleotides for site-directed mutagenesisNo.SequenceDescription (strand)1001AAGCAATCCATATGCCTATCGTCGACACTGPMII NH2-terminal primer with NdeI site (+)1005TGAATAGCCATGCATGTTTCATTAGTAGGCPMII COOH-terminal primer with NsiI site (−)1006GGGGAAGAACTGCTGAGCAGCE50Q (numbers 47–53(−))1007CCTCTCGGCCTGCCAGCGCACH73Q (numbers 70–76(−))1008TTCCAGGTCAACCCCCAGTACD112N (numbers 109–115(+))1009TGGCACGCCCAGAGGATCATCE75Q (numbers 72–78(+))1011aCATCGACGCCGTCAACGATGN79D (numbers 77–84(+))1012AGGATCATCCACGCCGTCAACN79H (numbers 76–82(+))1013AGAGGTCTCGTGATTGGAGTAY30H (numbers 27–33(−))1014aCCACACCAGAGGTCTTATAATTGE31K (numbers 28–36(−))1015GACACCGAGGAGATGAGCATGK93E (numbers 90–96(+))The underlined codons in the middle column refer to the changed codon for the site-directed mutagenesis except the TTA in oligomer 1005 which designates the stop codon.

The “Megaprimer” method of Sarkar and Sommer (22.Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar) was used. Nine internal oligomers were constructed in each of which a single nucleotide change was made (Table II). The procedure, described here for one mutant, as an example, utilizes two successive PCRs. Oligomers 1006 and 1001 (Table II) were used in the first PCR to amplify part of the cDNA sequence with incorporation of the altered codon in oligmer 1006. Oligomer 1001 contains an NdeI restriction site. The 100-μl PCR reaction mixture contained 50 ng of plasmid DNA from JM109#4, 1× Assay buffer from Fisher Biotech (10× buffer: 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, at 25 °C, 500 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, and 0.01% gelatin), 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 200 μg/ml dNTP, 100 pmol of each primer, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Fisher Biotech). Denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min was followed by 30 cycles (1 min each) at 94 °C denaturing, 54 °C for elongation, and a final 15 min at 72 °C for complete elongation. The amplified 170-bp product was electrophoresed in a 1.5% agarose gel and eluted with the QIA quick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN, Inc.). The 170-bp product was used as the megaprimer in the second PCR with oligomer 1005 (Table II). A good yield required the template DNA in the second PCR to be increased from 0.2 (22.Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar) to 2 μg (23.Datta A.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1187-1199Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 24.Barik S. Galinski M.S. BioTechniques. 1991; 10: 481-491PubMed Google Scholar). The 100 μl for the second PCR contained 2 μg of plasmid DNA (JM109#4), 1× Assay Buffer from Fisher Biotech, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 200 μmdNTP, 50 pmol each of the megaprimer and a terminal primer 1001 or 1005, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Fisher). After denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, 6 cycles were carried out at 94 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 2 min without the terminal primer which was then added, and 28 cycles of 94 °C (1 min), 52 °C (2 min), and 72 °C (2 min) were performed. The resulting 450-bp product was digested with NdeI andAsiI and inserted between these sites in the pHE7 expression vector. JM109 cells from a 1-liter culture overexpressing the recombinant Hbs were lysed on ice for 5 h in an 80-ml solution of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 40 units/ml DNase I, 3 units/ml RNase A, and 2 mg/ml lysozyme. The lysate was then frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed twice to break the cells. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm, 30 min (Sorvall rotor SS34). The reddish supernatant was saturated with CO, made 55% saturated with ammonium sulfate, and stirred on ice for 2 h. The precipitate was discarded, and the supernatant was made 95% saturated with ammonium sulfate and stirred for 2 h on ice. The pellet, obtained by centrifugation, was resuspended in a minimum volume of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and dialyzed (Spectropor tubing with 12,000–14,000 M rcutoff) against 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, for at least 36 h at 4 °C with three changes of buffer. The sample was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. The colored fractions were combined and concentrated to 5–10 ml with a Diaflo concentrator (YM-10 membrane, Amicon, Inc., MA). The concentrated eluate was dialyzed with three changes against the same Tris-EDTA buffer with pH increased to 8.8. The solution was applied to the same column equilibrated with this buffer, and the colored fractions were concentrated again to 5–10 ml and dialyzed further against 10 mm Tris and 0.5 mm EDTA at pH 9.8 for 36 h with 3 buffer changes. The recombinant Hbs were eluted with the same buffer containing 0.25 m NaCl. The buffers and solutions were kept saturated with CO. The final purified recombinant Hbs were stored at −80 °C. Amino acid sequencing at the University of Texas Microanalysis Center showed a quantitiatve yield of proline in the recombinant Hb. The amino-terminal peptidase evidently removed all the methionine. Prior studies (25.Li S.L. Riggs A. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 6149-6169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed no evidence in the native Hb for the formylation found in the Hb of the closely related L. fluviatilis (26.Fujiki N. Braunitzer G. Rudloff V. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1970; 351: 901-902PubMed Google Scholar). The CO-saturated recombinant Hbs were converted to HbO2 with light (Sungun, Sylvania) and O2 at 4 °C, diluted to ∼18 μm with 0.1m phosphate buffer of pH 6.0, 6.5, and 7.5, and dialyzed overnight against this buffer. The dialyzed samples (100 μl) were flushed with N2 and equilibrated for ∼1 h in an anaerobic chamber; then sodium dithionite (Miles Platting, Manchester, United Kingdom) was added to a concentration of 2 mg/ml, the same concentration used by Andersen (12.Andersen M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 246: 4800-4806Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Double-sector Epon charcoal-filled centerpieces with quartz windows were used in sedimentation equilibrium experiments at 20 °C with a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge 3The Beckman Optima XLA analytical ultracentrifuge is a component of the Center for Macromolecular Design of Texas A&M University, College Station, TX. Acquisition of the instrument was supported in part by grants from the National Science Foundation and the State of Texas. equipped with an An60Ti rotor and a photoelectric scanner. The Epon cells were evacuated in the entering chamber for the anaerobic chamber and then remained in the chamber about 1 h. Initial experiments with 200-μl samples required 44 h to reach equilibrium; 100-μl samples were used subsequently to reduce the equilibration time. The experiments were performed with an initial rotor speed of 24,000 rpm for 1 h followed by 16,000 rpm until equilibrium was reached. The averages of five spectra were recorded from 300 to 650 nm at one radial position at the start and at the end. The averages of 20 radial scans at 430 and 560 nm with a step size of 0.001 in absorbance were obtained after equilibrium was reached. Duplicate scans at 430 nm 3–4 h apart were overlaid to determine when equilibrium was reached (∼22 h for a 100-μl sample). The spectra at the start and end of an experiment showed maxima near 430 and 560 nm. The data were fitted by nonlinear least squares (27.Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R.

The absorbance of the reference sector at each radial position was subtracted from the absorbance of the sample sector to giveA r,total. This was necessary because the absorbance of the reference sector increased about 0.002 per 0.1 cm increase in r except at the extremes where the absorbance was higher. The reasons for this variation in the reference sector are not known. The reference radius, r o, was chosen at or just below the meniscus in the sample sector. The least-squares fitting of the data to Equation 1 determined the best values of three parameters: A o, K, and E. A o andA o2 K are the contributions of the monomer and dimer, respectively, to the total absorbance, corrected for the offset, E. The fitting gives the association constant in absorbance units which was converted tom−1 units by the relationK 1,2 (units, m−1) = K abs, εl, where the extinction coefficient, ε, for deoxy-Hb at 560 nm was measured to be 12.9 mm−1 cm−1 and the path length, l, in the centerpiece is 1.2 cm. The extinction coefficient was determined by measuring the absorption spectrum after determining the heme content by the alkaline hematin method (30.Wolf H.U. Lang W. Zander R. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1984; 136: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The initial equilibration time of 44 h with 200-μl samples at pH 6.0 resulted in some metHb formation which caused the calculated dimer-monomer dissociation constant to be spuriously high because metHb is monomeric. However, subsequent measurements with a 100-μl sample did not show metHb at pH 6.0, and no measurable metHb was observed at pH 6.5 or 7.5. None of the spectra showed increased absorption at 630 nm as would be expected for metHb; t"

We also sought to determine if differences in urokinase expression by cultured human lung carcinoma and non-malignant lung epithelial subtypes were attributable to post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. Urokinase was expressed by phenotypically diverse lung carcinoma cell lines as well as non-malignant small airway epithelial cells and bronchial epithelial cells. Using gel mobility shift and UV cross-linking assays, we identified a 30-kDa urokinase mRNA-binding protein that selectively bound to a 66-nucleotide protein-binding fragment of urokinase mRNA. The urokinase mRNA-binding protein is found in the cytosolic but not nuclear extracts of non-malignant lung epithelial cells; whereas, it is found in the nuclear but not cytosolic extracts of selected malignant carcinoma-derived cells that express relatively large amounts of urokinase. Chimeric β-globin/urokinase cDNA containing the urokinase mRNA-binding protein binding sequence destabilized otherwise stable β-globin mRNA. Our results demonstrate that urokinase gene expression in lung epithelial and lung carcinoma-derived cells is regulated at the post-transcriptional level. The mechanism involves an interaction between a 66-nucleotide sequence of the urokinase mRNA 3′-untranslated region with a newly recognized urokinase mRNA-binding protein to regulate urokinase mRNA stability."
https://openalex.org/W2115121837,"The structural organization of theDrosophila melanogaster gene encoding mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein (mtSSB) has been determined and its pattern of expression evaluated during Drosophiladevelopment. The D. melanogaster mtSSB gene contains four exons and three small introns. The transcriptional initiation site is located 22 nucleotides upstream from the initiator translation codon in adults, whereas several initiation sites are found in embryos. No consensus TATA or CAAT sequences are located at canonical positions, although an AT-rich sequence was identified flanking the major transcriptional initiation site. Northern analyses indicated that themtSSB transcript is present at variable levels throughout development. In situ hybridization analysis shows that maternally deposited mtSSB mRNA is distributed homogeneously in the early embryo, whereas de novotranscript is produced specifically at an elevated level in the developing midgut. Transfection assays in cultured Schneider cells with promoter region deletion constructs revealed that the proximal 230 nucleotides contain cis-acting elements required for efficient gene expression. Putative transcription factor binding sites clustered within this region include two Drosophila DNA replication-related elements (DRE) and a single putative E2F binding site. Deletion and base substitution mutagenesis of the DRE sites demonstrated that they are required for efficient promoter activity, and gel electrophoretic mobility shift analyses showed that DRE binding factor (DREF) binds to these sites. Our data suggest strongly that theDrosophila mtSSB gene is regulated by the DRE/DREF system. This finding represents a first link between nuclear and mitochondrial DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W2133582725,"Maurotoxin (MTX) is a 34-residue toxin that has been isolated from the venom of the chactidae scorpionScorpio maurus palmatus. The toxin displays an exceptionally wide range of pharmacological activity since it binds onto small conductance Ca2+-activated K+channels and also blocks Kv channels (Shaker, Kv1.2 and Kv1.3). MTX possesses 53–68% sequence identity with HsTx1 and Pi1, two other K+ channel short chain scorpion toxins cross-linked by four disulfide bridges. These three toxins differ from other K+/Cl−/Na+ channel scorpion toxins cross-linked by either three or four disulfide bridges by the presence of an extra half-cystine residue in the middle of a consensus sequence generally associated with the formation of an α/β scaffold (an α-helix connected to an antiparallel β-sheet by two disulfide bridges). Because MTX exhibits an uncommon disulfide bridge organization among known scorpion toxins (C1-C5, C2-C6, C3-C4, and C7-C8 instead of C1-C4, C2-C5, and C3-C6 for three-disulfide-bridged toxins or C1-C5, C2-C6, C3-C7, and C4-C8 for four-disulfide-bridged toxins), we designed and chemically synthesized an MTX analog with three instead of four disulfide bridges ([Abu19,Abu34]MTX) and in which the entire consensus motif of scorpion toxins was restored by the substitution of the two half-cystines in positions 19 and 34 (corresponding to C4 and C8) by two isosteric α-aminobutyrate (Abu) derivatives.

The solid phase technique has been used to obtain synthetic maurotoxin (sMTX) and it was found that both the natural and synthetic MTXs are equally lethal to mice by intracerebroventricular inoculation (LD50 of 80 ng/mouse). sMTX has been shown to be active in the nanomolar range on both voltage-gated K+ channels (Shaker B, Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.3) and onto rat brain apamin-sensitive small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (SK) (1.Kharrat R.

Meunier S. El Ayeb M. Van Rietschoten J. Darbon H. Proteins. 1997; 29: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure shows that the toxin contains a bent helix from residues 6 to 16 connected by a loop to a two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (residues 23–26 and 28–31), a conformation grossly similar to those of other scorpion toxins. The half-cystine pairings of sMTX were identified by enzyme proteolysis and found to be Cys3-Cys24, Cys9-Cys29, Cys13-Cys19, and Cys31-Cys34, consistent with experimental data obtained by Edman sequencing of the natural MTX (3.Kharrat R.

The structural and pharmacological features of MTX (less than 40 residues, 4 disulfide bridges, and binding onto K+ channels) suggest that MTX belongs to a new class of natural K+ channel blockers structurally intermediate between the Na+ (60–70 residues and 4 disulfide bridges) and K+ channel scorpion toxin families (less than 40 residues and 3 disulfide bridges) (4.Darbon H. Blanc E. Sabatier J.M. Darbon H. Sabatier J.M. Perspectives in Drug Discovery and Design: Animal Toxins and Potassium Channels. 15/16. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1999: 40-60Google Scholar). This class also includes Pi1 and HsTx1 from the venoms of the scorpionsPandinus imperator (5.Olamendi-Portugal T. Gomez-Lagunas F. Gurrola G.B. Possani L.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 977-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and Heterometrus spinnifer(6.Lebrun B. Romi-Lebrun R. Martin-Eauclaire M.-F. Yasuda A. Ishiguro M. Oyama Y. Pongs O. Nakajima T. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), respectively. These K+ channel-acting toxins share from 53 to 68% sequence identity with MTX but display slightly different pharmacological selectivities. For instance, Pi1 is inactive on rat Kv1.1 and Kv1.3 channels, whereas HsTx1 is inactive on apamin-sensitive SK channels in contrast to MTX (6.Lebrun B. Romi-Lebrun R. Martin-Eauclaire M.-F. Yasuda A. Ishiguro M. Oyama Y. Pongs O. Nakajima T. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). One interesting feature of MTX is that it has a unique disulfide bridge pattern among known scorpion toxins, including toxins from its own class such as Pi1 and HsTx1. In particular, it differs, first, from the classical three-disulfide-bridged toxins active on K+ channels by the presence of an extra disulfide bridge and, second, from all three- or four-disulfide-bridged toxins by a loss of the half-cystine pairings observed in classical three- or four-disulfide-bridged toxins (C1-C4, C2-C5, and C3-C6 pairings, or C1-C5, C2-C6, C3-C7, and C4-C8 pairings, respectively). The change concerns the two last disulfide bridges, and the pairings observed in MTX are of the type C1-C5, C2-C6, C3-C4, and C7-C8 instead. It has been proposed that the α/β scaffold of scorpion toxins is determined by a consensus sequence of the type [...]C[...]CXXXC[...](G/A/S)XC[...]CXC[...] for either three- or four-disulfide-bridged toxins, with two additional half-cystines located outside the motif in the latter case (2.Blanc E.

The detailed structural basis for this variability is still poorly apprehended. We noticed that this consensus sequence is, however, altered in the case of MTX since the first half-cystine residue located at the N terminus is absent, whereas a new one is inserted in the central part of the motif (position Cys19, Fig. 1). Despite this change in the proposed consensus sequence, it was unexpectedly found that MTX still adopts the α/β scaffold (2.Blanc E. Sabatier J.-M. Kharrat R. Meunier S. El Ayeb M. Van Rietschoten J. Darbon H. Proteins. 1997; 29: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, interesting differences result from this new disulfide bridge organization. In particular, it was found that, in this novel disulfide bridge pattern, the α-helix is connected by two disulfide bridges (Cys9-Cys29 and Cys13-Cys19) to two different strands of the β-sheet instead of connecting the α-helix to the same strand. These novel half-cystine pairings may nevertheless result in discrete conformational changes and/or positioning of certain residues of the toxin that could impact the pharmacological selectivity of MTX. To test this hypothesis, a three-disulfide-bridged structural analog of MTX was designed to fully restore the consensus sequence of the scorpion toxins. Accordingly, Cys19 and Cys34 that do not belong to the consensus sequence were replaced by isosteric α-aminobutyrate derivatives. Here, we report the chemical synthesis of [Abu19,Abu34]MTX, its half-cystine pairings, its three-dimensional structure in solution, and its biological and pharmacological activities. Our data indicate that there is indeed a rearrangement of the disulfide bridges in the MTX analog without a drastic alteration of the α/β scaffold, but with a marked reorientation of the α-helix regarding the β-sheet (angle of 50°) that may be sufficient to affect the pharmacological activity of the peptide. N α-Fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-l-amino acids, Fmoc-amide resin, and reagents used for peptide synthesis were obtained from Perkin-Elmer. Solvents were analytical grade products from SDS. Enzymes (trypsin and chymotrypsin) were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The [Abu19,Abu34]MTX was obtained by the solid phase technique (9.Merrifield R.B. Science. 1986; 232: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar) using a peptide synthesizer (model 433A, Applied Biosystems Inc.). Peptide chains were assembled stepwise on 0.25 meq of Fmoc-amide resin (0.65 meq of amino group/g) using 1 mmol of (Fmoc) amino acid derivatives (10.Sabatier J.M. Rochat H. Martin-Eauclaire M.F. Handbook of Toxinology, Animal Toxins: Tools in Cell Biology. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1999: 198-218Google Scholar). The side chain-protecting groups used for trifunctional residues were: trityl for Cys, Asn, and Gln;tert-butyl for Ser, Thr, Tyr, and Asp; pentamethylchroman for Arg, and tert-butyloxycarbonyl for Lys. The Fmoc-amino acid derivatives were coupled (20 min) as their hydroxybenzotriazole active esters in N-methylpyrrolidone (4-fold excess). The peptide resin (about 2.2 g) was treated for 2.5 h at room temperature with a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid/H2O/thioanisole/ethanedithiol (88:5:5:2, v/v) in the presence of crystalline phenol (2.25 g). After filtration of the mixture, the peptide was precipitated and washed by adding cold diethyloxide. The crude peptide was pelleted by centrifugation (3,000 × g; 10 min) and the supernatant was discarded. The reduced peptide was then dissolved at 2 mm in 0.2m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.3, and stirred under air to allow folding (48 h, room temperature). The target product, [Abu19,Abu34]MTX, was purified by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Perkin-Elmer, C18 Aquapore ODS 20 μm, 250 × 10 mm) by means of a 60-min linear gradient of 0.08% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and 0–35% acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid/H2O at a flow rate of 5 ml/min (λ = 230 nm). The homogeneity and identity of [Abu19,Abu34]MTX was assessed by: (i) analytical C18 reversed phase HPLC, (ii) amino acid analysis after acidolysis, and (iii) mass determination by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. The [Abu19,Abu34]MTX (800 μg) was incubated with a mixture of trypsin and chymotrypsin at 10% (w/w) in 0.2m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, for 12 h at 37 °C. The peptide fragments were then purified by reversed phase HPLC (Vydac, C18 5-μm column, 4 × 150 mm) with a 60-min linear gradient of 0.08% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, 0–60% acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid/H2O at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (λ = 230 nm), and freeze-dried prior to their analyses. The peptide fragments were hydrolyzed by acidolysis (6 nHCl/phenol), and their amino acid content was analyzed (Beckman, System 6300 amino acid analyzer). The peptides were further characterized by mass spectrometry analysis (RP-DE Voyager, Perseptive Biosystems), and Edman sequencing using a gas phase microsequencer (Applied Biosystems 470A). In standard HPLC conditions for analyzing phenylthiohydantoin-amino acid derivatives, diphenylthiohydantoin-cystine elutes at a retention time of 9.8 min. 4.0 mg of [Abu13,Abu34]MTX was dissolved in 0.5 ml of H2O/D2O (90/10 v/v), pH = 3 uncorrected for isotope effects. Proton two-dimensional NMR spectra was first routinely recorded at 300 K. All the data were collected on a Bruker DRX 500. Clean total correlation spectra (TOCSY) (11.Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn.

NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3487) Google Scholar) composite were acquired using the time proportional phase increment method with mixing time of 100 ms. The solvent-OH resonance was suppressed either by low power irradiation during the relaxation delay and, for NOESY spectra, during the mixing time, or using a watergate 3–9-19 pulse train (15.Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3487) Google Scholar) using a gradient at the magic angle obtained by applying simultaneously x, y, and zgradients prior to detection. For determination of amide proton exchange rates, the peptide was lyophilized twice and solubilized in 100% D2O. Immediately after solubilization, a series of NOESY spectra with a mixing time of 80 ms were recorded at 283 K, the first one during a time period of 1 h (1024 complex points with 256 experiments), followed by spectra of 10 h (1024 complex points with 512 experiments). All the data were processed using the Bruker software XWINNMR, running on a Silicon Graphic INDY R4000 workstation. The matrices were transformed with a zero filling to the next power of two in the acquisition dimension, and to 1024 points in the other. The signal was multiplied by a shifted sine-bell window, in both dimensions prior to Fourier transform, and a fifth-order polynomial base-line correction was applied. Spectra had finally a 12 ppm width with a digital resolution of 2.93 Hz/point in the ω2 dimension and 5.85 Hz/point in the ω1 dimension. The spectral analysis and structure calculation were performed as described previously (2.Blanc E. Sabatier J.-M. Kharrat R. Meunier S. El Ayeb M. Van Rietschoten J. Darbon H. Proteins. 1997; 29: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Steric energy calculations were aimed at determining the most energetically favored half-cystine pairings of [Abu19,Abu34]MTX. These calculations were based on the three-dimensional structure of MTX obtained from the Protein Data Bank (2.Blanc E. Sabatier J.-M. Kharrat R. Meunier S. El Ayeb M. Van Rietschoten J. Darbon H. Proteins. 1997; 29: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Half-cystines in positions 19 and 34 were substituted by Abu derivatives, and full minimization was performed for each sterically possible half-cystine pairing arrangements (12 found possible out of 15, the disulfide bridge 29–31 being excluded from the calculations because of steric impossibility; see Table II for the various combinations used). Minimizations were achieved using the molecular modeling program Insight II (Molecular Simulations Inc.), the Discover-based minimization, and the CVFF force field. The mathematical method used for minimizations was the gradient conjugate.Table IISteric energies of the 12 possible half-cystine pairing combinations of the three-disulfide-bridged [Abu 19, Abu 34 ]MTX as determined by molecular mechanics calculationsPotential disulfide bridge arrangements of [Abu19,34]-MTX (half-cystine pairings)Steric energykcal/mol3–24/9–29/13–31290.363–24/9–31/13–29299.243–9/13–29/24–31298.593–9/13–31/24–29352.513–13/9–29/24–31303.193–13/9–31/24–29372.433–29/9–13/24–31293.593–29/9–24/13–31291.643–29/9–31/13–24295.833–31/9–13/24–29330.003–31/9–24/13–29300.123–31/9–29/13–24296.80The most favored combination is shown in bold and corresponds to the experimentally determined disulfide bridge organization.

The peptide was tested in vivo for toxicity by determining the LD50 after intracerebroventricular injection into 20-g C57/BL6 mice. Groups of six mice per dose were injected with 5 μl of [Abu19,Abu34]MTX solution containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride. Rat brain synaptosomes (P2 fraction) were prepared as described by Gray and Whittaker (16.Gray E.G. Whittaker V.P. J. Anat. 1962; 96: 79-88PubMed Google Scholar). The protein content was determined by a modified Lowry method. 125I-Apamin (2,000 Ci/mmol) was obtained according to Seagar et al. (17.Seagar M.J. Granier C. Couraud F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1491-1495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of 50 μl of 0.1 nm125I-apamin were added to 400 μl of synaptosome suspension (0.4 mg of protein/ml). Samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of one of a series of concentrations of [Abu19,Abu34]MTX (10−5 to 10−13m) in 500 μl final volume. The incubation buffer was 25 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm KCl, pH 7.2. The samples were centrifuged, and the resulting pellets were washed three times in 1 ml of the same buffer. Bound radioactivity was determined by counting (Packard Crystal II). The values expressed are the means of triplicate experiments ± S.D. Nonspecific binding, less than 10% of the total binding, was determined in the presence of an excess (10 nm) of unlabeled apamin. Stages V and VI Xenopus laevisoocytes were prepared for cRNA injection and electrophysiological recordings as described (18.De Waard M. Campbell K.P. J. Physiol. 1995; 485: 619-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes were prepared by removing the follicular cell layer by enzymatic treatment with 2 mg/ml collagenase IA (Sigma) in classical Barth's medium (in mm: 88 NaCl, 1 KCl, 0.82 MgSO4, 0.33 Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 CaCl2, 2.4 NaHCO3, 15 HEPES, pH 7.4 with NaOH). The plasmids were cut with SmaI (Shaker B), NotI (rat Kv1.1),XbaI (rat Kv1.2), and EcoRI (rat Kv1.3). The linearized plasmids were transcribed by means of a T7 or SP6 (mMessage mMachine kit, Ambion). The cRNA were stored frozen in H2O at −80 °C at 1 μg/μl. The cells were micro-injected 2 days latter with 50 nl of cRNA (0.2 μg/μl Shaker B, rat Kv1.1, rat Kv1.2, or rat Kv1.3 channels). To favor channel expression, cells were incubated at 16 °C into a defined nutrient oocyte medium (19.Eppig J.J. Dumont J.N. In Vitro. 1976; 12: 418-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) 2–6 days before current recordings. Standard two-microelectrode techniques were used at room temperature (18–23 °C) to record oocyte currents. Both current and voltage electrodes were filled with 140 mmKCl and had resistances comprising between 0.5 and 1 megaohm. The bath solution was clamped to 0 mV, which served as reference potential. Currents were recorded using a voltage-clamp amplifier (GeneClamp 500, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) interfaced with a 16-bit AD/DA converter (Digidata 1200A, Axon Instruments) for acquisition and voltage protocol application. Voltage pulses were delivered every 15 s from a holding potential of −80 mV. Current records were sampled at 10 kHz and low pass-filtered at 2 kHz using an eight-pole Bessel filter and stored on computer for subsequent analysis. The extracellular recording solution contained (in mm): 88 NaCl, 10 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 0.5 CaCl2, 0.5 niflumic acid, 5 HEPES, pH 7.4 (NaOH). Leak and capacitative currents were subtracted on-line by a P/4 protocol. Residual capacitative artifacts were blanked for display purposes. Toxin solutions were perfused in the recording chamber at a flow rate of 2 ml/min using a ValveBank4 apparatus (Automate Scientific Inc.). 0.1% bovine serum albumin was added to the recording and perfusion solutions to prevent [Abu19,Abu34]MTX loss to the plastic chamber and tubules and nonspecific binding onto the cell. Data analysis was performed using pCLAMP 6.0.3 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The results are presented as mean ± S.E. Fig. 1 illustrates the consensus sequence of the scorpion toxins independent of their length, primary structure, and pharmacological selectivity (7.Bonmatin J.M. Bonnat J.L. Gallet X. Vovelle F.

Toma F. Science. 1991; 254: 1521-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In three-disulfide-bridged toxins, the half-cystine pairings are so far of the type C1-C4, C2-C5, and C3-C6. In short chain four-disulfide-bridged toxins active on K+ channels, one of the two additional half-cystine residues is located inside the consensus motif, between C3 and C4, whereas the other one is placed after the C-terminal end of the motif (after C6). Of note, the two additional half-cystine residues found in long-chain four-disulfide-bridged scorpion toxins active on Na+ channels are located differently, i.e. at N- and C-terminal regions, outside the motif. In the K+channel toxins, the addition of two cysteines affects the disulfide bridge organization of the toxin. Two possibilities are observed so far in this toxin family: (i) toxins such as Pi1 and HsTx1 keep the general overlapping type of half-cystine pairings (see Fig. 1), whereas (ii) MTX presents partially rearranged half-cystine pairings. In particular, the two last bridges are not of an overlapping type in MTX but instead C3 is connected with the extra central half-cystine residue (Cys in position 19 in MTX amino acid sequence) and C6 with the outer C-terminal half-cystine residue (Cys in position 34). To assess the effect of the disulfide bridge rearrangement induced by the presence of these two extra half-cystine residues regarding toxin three-dimensional structure and pharmacological activity, we designed and chemically synthesized an analog of MTX in which Cys19 and Cys34 were replaced by isosteric α-aminobutyrate derivatives (Abu19 and Abu34, which are unable to associate covalently). In this analog, the two half-cystine residues were not engaged in the formation of the same disulfide bridge, and it can therefore be expected that there will be (i) a reduction in the number of disulfide bridges from four to three and (ii) a concomitant rearrangement in pairings of the remaining six half-cystine residues. These mutations aim to restore the entire consensus sequence and half-cystine pairings of three-disulfide-bridged scorpion toxins. Stepwise assembly of [Abu19,Abu34]MTX was achieved by means of Fmoc/t-butyl chemistry (10.Sabatier J.M. Rochat H. Martin-Eauclaire M.F. Handbook of Toxinology, Animal Toxins: Tools in Cell Biology. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1999: 198-218Google Scholar). The yield of assembly was 80%. The profiles of elution by C18reversed phase HPLC of the crude reduced peptide after final acidolysis are shown in Fig. 2 A(left panel). The crude peptide was folded/oxidized by 48 h exposure to air (Fig. 2 A,middle panel), and purified to homogeneity by C18 reversed phase HPLC (Fig. 2 A,right panel). The amino acid ratios of [Abu19,Abu34]MTX were in agreement with the deduced values (see Table I). Additionally, the mass spectrometry analysis by the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight technique gave an experimental M r (M + H)+ of 3579.3 for [Abu19,Abu34]MTX, which is close to the deduced M r (M + H)+ of 3579.2.Table IAmino acid content (uncorrected values) of [Abu 19, Abu 34 ] MTX after hydrolysis (118 °C, 20 h, N2 atmosphere) with 6 n HCl in the presence of 2% (w/v) phenolDeducedM r (M + H)+3579.2Experimental M r (M + H)+3579.3Amino acid analysis Asx2.8 (3) Thr1.9 (2) Ser2.7 (3) Glx1.0 (1) Gly2.9 (3) Ala1.9 (2) Cys + AbuND Val0.9 (1) Ile0.9 (1) Tyr1.8 (2) Lys4.8 (5) Arg0.9 (1) Pro1.9 (2)The deduced amino acid composition is given in brackets.

Deduced and experimental M r values are indicated. ND, not determined. Next, we attempted to determine by computer-assisted molecular modeling which disulfide bridge organization among the 15 theoretically possible combinations was the most energetically favored for [Abu19,Abu34]MTX. Three of these combinations, all based on the Cys29-Cys31pairing, were deliberately eliminated from the calculations because of the impossibility of this pairing to occur (the minimal pairing that can occur being the 14-membered disulfide ring requiring two residues between the two half-cystines). The most stable conformation (lowest steric energy) obtained was the one that can be found in scorpion toxins cross-linked by three disulfide bridges characterized so far,i.e. C1-C4, C2-C5, and C3-C6 (TableII). To now formerly establish the half-cystine pairings of oxidized [Abu19,Abu34]MTX, the analog was proteolyzed by a mixture of trypsin and chymotrypsin and the resulting peptide fragments were purified by HPLC. Amino acid analysis, mass spectrometry, and Edman sequencing techniques were used to identify the sequence of the peptides connected to each other by a disulfide bond. The results of the enzyme treatment are summarized in Fig.2 B. The half-cystine pairings were thereby mapped as Cys3-Cys24, Cys9-Cys29, and Cys13-Cys31 (Fig. 2 C). These findings demonstrate that, as expected by introducing the two point mutations in positions 19 and 34 of MTX, the standard overlapping disulfide bridge pattern found in natural three-disulfide-bridged scorpion toxins was restored. In the [Abu19,Abu34]MTX analog, the two first disulfide bridges (Cys3-Cys24 and Cys9-Cys29) are identical to those found in MTX, whereas the last one is a recombination between Cys13and Cys31 that initially belonged to two different disulfide bridges. Interestingly, all three disulfide bridges"

A. 1997; 94: 1745-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar)) share a conserved sequence motif, referred to as the Sec7 homology motif, and the ability to speed the off-rate of GDP from ARF proteins. In addition to these exchange factors, an activity has been described in crude Golgi membrane preparations with the ability to increase the binding of GTP or the slowly hydrolyzing analog GTPγS to ARF without increasing the rate of GDP release. This protease-sensitive ARF-activating protein has proven resistant to purification and has not been characterized further (25.Randazzo P.A. Yang Y.C. Rulka C. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9555-9563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to these specific protein interactions, the binding of GTP to ARFs is generally promoted by lipids, e.g.phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanol (26.Kahn R.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7906-7911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, other lipids, particularly phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), bind to ARFs, promote the release of GDP, and stabilize the nucleotide-free protein (27.Terui T. Kahn R.A. Randazzo P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28130-28135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the subsequent removal of PIP2 allows GTP to bind at a higher stoichiometry than was supported prior to exposure to high concentrations of PIP2 (27.Terui T. Kahn R.A. Randazzo P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28130-28135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to other families of GTPases, the extent of in vitro binding of GTP to ARFs is very low (typically <10%) (26.Kahn R.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7906-7911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,28.Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and this binding is highly dependent on the presence of a hydrophobic environment, which can be supplied for in vitroassays by either lipids or detergents. A mixture of 3 mmdimyristoyl-l-α-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and 2.5 mm sodium cholate is commonly used (26.Kahn R.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7906-7911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). An amphipathic α-helix at the N terminus of ARFs, absent in other GTPases, acts as an inhibitory domain that both limits GTP binding and confers the dependence on lipids (29.Kahn R.A. Randazzo P. Serafini T. Weiss O. Rulka C. Clark J. Amherdt M. Roller P. Orci L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13039-13046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of its role in GTP binding, phospholipid dependence, membrane binding, and potentially effector interactions, the N-terminal α-helix has been studied extensively (29.Kahn R.A. Randazzo P. Serafini T. Weiss O. Rulka C. Clark J. Amherdt M. Roller P. Orci L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13039-13046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Randazzo P.A. Terui T. Sturch S.

This isolated domain was first shown to be capable of assuming an α-helical structure in solution, but only when exposed to a hydrophobic environment (29.Kahn R.A. Randazzo P. Serafini T. Weiss O. Rulka C. Clark J. Amherdt M. Roller P. Orci L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13039-13046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later, this N-terminal domain of the protein was shown, by solution of the x-ray crystal structure, to form a helix in the intact protein when bound to GDP (33.Amor J.C. Harrison D.H. Kahn R.A. Ringe D. Nature. 1994; 372: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). This helix is held tightly in place by a series of hydrophobic interactions, provided by leucine and phenylalanine residues in the N-terminal domain, with a hydrophobic region of the protein core. Deletion of the N-terminal 17 residues by mutagenesis results in a protein that lacks ARF activity (29.Kahn R.A. Randazzo P. Serafini T. Weiss O. Rulka C. Clark J. Amherdt M. Roller P. Orci L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13039-13046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but that binds GTP at a high stoichiometry and independently of added lipids or detergents. ARFs are N-myristoylated at the N-terminal glycine, and the first dozen or so residues are thought to provide further energies that assist in the anchoring ofN-myristoylated ARF to membrane surfaces (32.Losonczi J.A. Prestegard J.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 706-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 34.Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 35.Ames J.B. Tanaka T. Stryer L. Ikura M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, the N terminus and myristate are proposed to be critical for ARF activities, as they are needed for the association and possibly orientation of the protein at the membrane interface. Because of its apparent role in membrane binding, it is generally thought that the N-terminal helix is not involved in protein-protein interactions. However, this conclusion is challenged by both functional biochemical data (30.Randazzo P.A. Terui T. Sturch S. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29490-29494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and results of two-hybrid assays with newly discovered ARF-binding proteins (14.Boman A. Kuai J. Zhu X. Chen J. Kuriyama R. Kahn R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 44: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).3 We speculated that interaction with protein factors may involve the N-terminal helix and in so doing relieve the inhibition of GTP binding. One prediction from this model is that the presence of the protein should promote a higher binding stoichiometry than observed in the presence of lipids. We sought to test this prediction using purified recombinant proteins. In so doing, we found that effectors can increase the binding stoichiometry of purified ARF by up to 25-fold, to 1 mol of GTP bound per mol of ARF protein. Further investigation of the GTP-binding properties of ARF proteins led to the surprising conclusions that ARFs exist in at least two, slowly interchangeable conformations and that one of these has a very low affinity for GTP. Also surprising is the conclusion that protein effectors of ARF signaling must interact specifically with this low affinity state to convert it into the higher affinity state. We believe that these results identify a novel feature of ARF interactions with effectors and reveal an even more complex picture of the actions of this family of GTPases with likely consequences to its actions in cells. [35S]GTPγS, [3H]GDP, 1,2-didecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoryl[3H]choline, and [adenine-2,8-3H]NAD were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Cholera toxin and cholera toxin A subunits (CTAs) were purchased from List Biological Laboratories, Inc. Dowex AG 1-X2 (100–200 mesh in the hydroxyl form) was obtained from Bio-Rad. Amylose resin was purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. All other reagents and chemicals were obtained from Sigma. All experiments shown or described were repeated at least twice with similar results. Binding of GTPγS to ARF was determined by the method described by Kahn and Gilman (26.Kahn R.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7906-7911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Kahn (28.Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). ARF was incubated at 30 °C in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mmMgCl2 (low Mg2+ condition) or 1.25 mm MgCl2 (high Mg2+ condition), 3 mm DMPC, 0.1% sodium cholate, and 100 μg/ml BSA) and 10 μm GTPγS ([35S]GTPγS, 2500 cpm/pmol). Duplicates of 10-μl samples were taken and diluted into 2 ml of ice-cold TNMD buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), followed by rapid filtration onto 25-mm BA85 nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schüll). Filters were then washed six times with 2 ml of TNMD buffer before counting. The rate of dissociation of GDP was determined by a previously described procedure (36.Weiss O. Holden J. Rulka C. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21066-21072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]GDP was first loaded onto ARF by incubation of 1 μm ARF at 30 °C in binding buffer under low or high magnesium conditions and 10 μm [3H]GDP (20,000 cpm/pmol). After 1 h of incubation, the dissociation kinetics were then determined by diluting the GDP 100-fold with unlabeled nucleotide; duplicate samples were taken; and binding was determined as described above. Dissociation rates were calculated using Microcal Origin Version 5.0. Curves were fitted to equations for single exponential decay with an offset. Activation of ARF was monitored by following changes in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence as described previously (26.Kahn R.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7906-7911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a Perkin-Elmer LS-5B luminescence spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength at 290 nm and an emission wavelength at 345 nm. All determinations were performed at room temperature (≈21 °C). Reactions were initiated by the addition of 1 μm ARF ± 6 μm LTA in binding buffer containing 10 μm GTPγS. Recombinant ARF1, Δ17ARF1, and ARF3 were purified as described previously (28.Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 37.Randazzo P.A. Weiss O. Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Partially myristoylated ARF3 (myrARF3) was purified from bacteria after coexpression of human ARF3 with yeast N-myristoyltransferase as described previously (38.Randazzo P.A. Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 394-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which resulted in a preparation that was ∼30% acylated. Recombinant GST-MKLP1-(649–960) and GST-GGA1-(145–639) were expressed as N-terminal truncations and fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase and purified from bacteria using a glutathione affinity column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol and as described for MKLP1 by Boman et al. (14.Boman A. Kuai J. Zhu X. Chen J. Kuriyama R. Kahn R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 44: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The expression system used to obtain POR1ΔN-MBP was a gift from Linda Van Aelst, and the protein was purified from bacteria using amylose resin following the protocol described previously (12.Van Aelst L. Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3778-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). LTA1 (residues 1–192 of LTA) was obtained either from treatment of LTA with trypsin or from bacteria expressing only LTA1 (kindly supplied by Juan Carlos Amor). Recombinant LTA(E112D) protein was expressed and purified as described by Cieplak et al. (18.Cieplak Jr., W. Mead D.J. Messer R.J. Grant C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30545-30550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This mutant has previously been shown to be less toxic as a result of its reduced ADP-ribosyltransferase activity, but its interactions with ARF proteins is unaltered. CTA was pre-activated by incubation at 30 °C for 10 min in buffer containing 50 mm glycine, pH 8.0, and 20 mmdithiothreitol. Reactions were performed as described previously (39.Moss J. Manganiello V.C. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 4424-4427Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and contained 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 4 μm NAD (6 nm[adenine-2,8-3H]NAD), 10 mmagmatine, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmMgCl2, 100 μm GTPγS, 3 mm DMPC, 0.1% cholate, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 1 μm ARF3, and 4 μm CTA. Assays were initiated by the addition of CTA; and after 10 min at 30 °C, duplicates of 0.1-ml samples were transferred to columns of Dowex AG 1-X2 for separation of ADP-ribosylagmatine from NAD. Phospholipase D activity was determined using a modification of the procedure of Lopez et al. (40.Lopez I. Arnold R.S. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12846-12852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). PLD1 was overexpressed in Hi5 cells, and membranes from these cells were used as a source of the enzyme. These membranes routinely had a 40-fold increase in PLD activity over untransfected Hi5 membranes, so it is primarily PLD1 that is being assayed. ARFs (10 μm) were pre-activated by incubation with 10 μm GTPγS at 30 °C for 6 h in high magnesium binding buffer with or without 10 μm POR1ΔN. The amount of activated ARF was monitored using the filter trapping assay with parallel incubations containing [35S]GTPγS. The reaction mixture was then diluted 10-fold into PLD assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm KCl, 1.67 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 69 μm[choline-3H]phosphatidylcholine, 28 μm PIP2, 593 μmphosphatidylethanol, 30 μm GTPγS, and 0.3 μg/μl Hi5 membrane protein). The reaction was performed at 37 °C for 15 min and stopped by the addition of 1 ml of chloroform/methanol/HCl (50:50:0.3) followed by 350 μl of 1 m HCl and 5 mm EGTA. A portion of the aqueous phase (500 μl) was analyzed for the release of [3H]choline. A blank was determined as the amount of product formed in the absence of any PLD, and this was subtracted from each sample. PLD activity was then expressed as the amount of choline released per min/μg of membrane protein. Normal rat kidney cells were grown in cell culture medium as described previously (41.Zhang C.J. Rosenwald A.G. Willingham M.C. Skuntz S. Clark J. Kahn R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). GGA1 was overexpressed in these cells after transfection with pcDNA3-GGA1 using Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to manufacturer's protocol. The open reading frame encoding full-length human GGA1 was subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) at unique EcoRI and XbaI sites. Expression of a single 78-kDa product was confirmed by Western blotting using GGA1-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody R79709 (15.Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Whisnant R.E. Kleuss C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22265-22271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), raised against the recombinant protein. After 21 h, cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% saponin, and labeled with GGA1-specific rabbit polyclonal (R79709) and ARF-specific mouse monoclonal (1D9) (42.Cavenagh M.M.

Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Cappel) were the secondary antibodies. Images were obtained using an Olympus BX-60 with a 100× objective and B-max filter cubes. Images were processed using Image Pro software. To test the prediction that an ARF effector could increase the binding of GTP to ARF, we first used LTA, as it has been shown to bind directly to ARF, has been well studied and characterized, and is available in large amounts as a recombinant protein (18.Cieplak Jr., W. Mead D.J. Messer R.J. Grant C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30545-30550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As described previously (28.Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), in our standard nucleotide binding assay (1 μm ARF, 3 mm DMPC, 0.1% cholate, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm MgCl2), purified recombinant human ARF3 bound [35S]GTPγS at only low stoichiometry (≈4% in the experiment shown in Fig. 1,open circles). The addition of an excess of LTA led to a time-dependent increase in the binding of GTPγS until the stoichiometry reached 1 mol of GTPγS bound per mol of ARF3 protein (100%), at which point this level of GTPγS binding was stable for several hours (Fig. 1, closed circles). We have expressed both the full-length LTA (240 amino acids; Fig. 1) and the LTA1 (residues 1–192; data not shown) proteins and found them equally potent in increasing the binding of GTP to ARF. A commercial preparation of CTA was also equally potent to LTA in this assay. The dramatic (25-fold) effect of LTA on the equilibrium level of GTP binding to ARF prompted us to test whether such an effect is an inherent property of other, perhaps all, ARF effectors. We expressed and purified the recombinant POR1-MBP fusion protein as described previously (12.Van Aelst L. Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3778-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, POR1-MBP (8 μm; open squares) promoted enhanced binding of GTPγS to ARF3, although to a lesser maximal extent than that seen with LTA (closed circles). With POR1-MBP, we typically observed maximal binding stoichiometries of between 50 and 80%. This may reflect a lower intrinsic activity for POR1-MBP than LTA. However, the POR1-MBP protein was insoluble above 2 mg/ml, and this prevented us from testing POR1-MBP at concentrations above 8 μm in our assay. We have noted that the maximal binding supported by POR1-MBP decreases with storage of the effector. We also tested two new ARF effectors, recently identified in our laboratory and also obtained from screening human cDNA libraries using two-hybrid assays: the C-terminal “tail” domain of MKLP1 and full-length GGA1. Each of these proteins also increased the levels of GTPγS over what could be achieved with ARF3 alone (Fig. 2). Each protein supported a different level of binding, with maximal effects varying between 5- and 10-fold. Other work in our laboratory led to the identification of a family of proteins as effectors of the essential function of ARFs in yeast (13.Zhang C. Cavenagh M.M. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19792-19796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and that bind directly to ARF. A fragment of the most active of these, Sat1, was expressed in and purified from bacteria. This deletion mutant (Sat1Δ5) is functional in yeast cells as an ARF effector (suppressor of the arf1-3 allele) of the essential role for ARF in mitotic growth and is active as an ARF GAP when yeast or mammalian ARF proteins are used as substrates. 4C. Zhang and R. A. Kahn, unpublished observations. Sat1Δ5 (8 μm) failed to promote enhanced GTP binding to ARF3 (data not shown) despite its ability to bind to mammalian ARFs. Thus, not all ARF-binding proteins have this effect on nucleotide binding; and some may have only a partial effect, promoting <100% occupancy of the nucleotide-binding site on ARF3. Interestingly, the only ARF-binding protein in this collection with ARF GAP activity, Sat1, was without effect on GTPγS binding. Note that BSA was included in the binding assay to decrease nonspecific binding of ARF to plastic. The omission of the BSA did not change the ability of ARF effectors to increase GTP binding. The inability of BSA or Sat1Δ5 to alter GTP binding to ARF is further evidence of the specificity of this phenomenon. Thus, the magnitude of the maximal effects observed for different ARF effectors was as follows: LTA = CTA = LTA1 > POR1-MBP > GGA1 > MKLP1 ≫ Sat1Δ5 ≈ BSA ≈ 0. A dependence of GTP binding on a hydrophobic environment, provided in the form of lipid vesicles, detergent(s), or mixed micelles, has been noted since ARFs were first found to bind guanine nucleotides (26.Kahn R.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7906-7911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This dependence is more marked in theN-myristoylated proteins, but is evident also in non-acylated ARF preparations. The effect of removing the DMPC/sodium cholate mixture from the binding reaction was investigated. As previously reported, equilibrium binding of GTPγS to human ARF3 was higher in the presence of 3 mm DMPC with 2.5 mmsodium cholate (DMPC/sodium cholate) (Fig.3, closed symbols) than in their absence (open symbols) for bothN-myristoylated (triangles) and non-acylated (squares and circles) proteins. Enhanced binding in the presence of POR1ΔN is evident in Fig. 3, and this effect can clearly be seen regardless of the presence of DMPC/sodium cholate or the N-myristoylation of ARF3. In the data shown in Fig. 3, the maximal effect of POR1 was only ∼40%, as the protein preparation was several weeks old. Thus, neither N-myristoylation nor the presence of a hydrophobic environment is required for the enhancement of activation by effectors. We next examined the effects of free magnesium ions on this effect, as this has been shown to have profound effects on GTP binding to ARF proteins. The use of a metal chelator (EDTA) to buffer the free metal ion concentration in nucleotide binding assays allows stable low levels of magnesium to be achieved. The concentration of free magnesium in our buffer (containing 0.5 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm EDTA) is in the low micromolar range, whereas that found in mammalian cell cytosol is thought to be in the high micromolar range. Increasing the free metal concentration by either omitting the EDTA or adding MgCl2 to excess over EDTA caused a slowing in the time required to reach equilibrium, yet the same binding stoichiometry was ultimately achieved in the presence of POR1ΔN (Fig.4). At the higher concentrations of magnesium, the off-rate of GDP was decreased markedly (see below and Fig. 5), leading directly to slower rates of GTPγS binding, as described previously (36.Weiss O. Holden J. Rulka C. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21066-21072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Note that this is not a true on-rate for GTP binding, as it is limited by the off-rate of GDP. On-rates for binding to nucleotide-free ARF have been reported only once before (36.Weiss O. Holden J. Rulka C. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21066-21072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as the protein is very unstable in this apo form.Figure 5Rate of GDP dissociation from ARF is not altered by the presence of effectors. ARF3 was loaded with [3H]GDP by exchange for 1 h at 30 °C in binding buffer with low free Mg2+ (circles) or high Mg2+ (squares). After adding unlabeled GDP to a final concentration of 1 mm either with buffer (closed symbols) or with 6 μmPOR1ΔN (open symbols), samples were taken at the indicated times, and the amount of remaining bound [3H]GDP was determined by nitrocellulose filter trapping as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The inset shows the log of specifically bound GDP as a function of time and"

Two of them were water-soluble, and the rest were soluble in 3m urea. The soluble ones interacted with GroEL in a manner similar to that of a natural substrate; they stimulated the ATPase cycle of GroEL and GroEL/GroES and inhibited GroEL-assisted folding of other protein.

The cavity surface of GroEL ring is lined with hydrophobic residues that can bind non-native polypeptides that expose regions of hydrophobic surface (16.Aoki K. Taguchi H. Shindo Y. Yoshida M.

GroEL protects these non-native substrate proteins from irreversible aggregation and improves the final yield of productive folding in a co-chaperonin GroES- and ATP-dependent manner. A wide range of proteins, unrelated in their primary sequences and native tertiary structures, can bind to GroEL (25.Ewalt K.L. Hendrick J.P. Houry W.A. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1997; 90: 491-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 26.Sakikawa C. Taguchi H. Makino Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol.

Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Because GroEL cannot interact with proteins in the native state, there should be specific local structural features that are recognized by GroEL and are commonly found in many proteins in the non-native, but not native, state. However, it remains yet unclear what kinds of structural features of these proteins are recognized by GroEL. Studies using a variety of proteins as a model of substrate protein have been carried out, but they have led to several different proposals on the GroEL-recognizable structural features, ranging from a fully unfolded to native-like conformation (28.Clark A.C.

Nature. 1992; 355: 455-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), although it was shown that an all or mainly β-sheet protein (Fab fragment, pepsin, and green fluorescent protein) could bind to GroEL (16.Aoki K.

On the other hand, binding of GroEL to unfolded proteins without an ordered secondary structure, apocytochrome c (33.Hoshino M. Kawata Y. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 575-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and α-casein (21.Lin Z. Schwarz F.P. Eisenstein E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1011-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), was demonstrated. In the crystal structure of the isolated apical domain of truncated GroEL with a 17-residue NH2-terminal tag, the region identified previously as a polypeptide binding site of GroEL indeed held a peptide stretch of the tag (residues −1 to −7) region with a nearly fully extended configuration probably as a mimic of the natural substrate protein (17.Buckle A.M. Zahn R. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3571-3575Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Generally, natural proteins have an inherent propensity to form secondary (and tertiary) structures. This may cause ambiguity in the search for a GroEL-recognizable structure because it is not easy to exclude the possibility that the folding state of the substrate protein changes upon binding to GroEL. Even such a possibility exists that a portion of the bound protein which is not involved directly in the binding is allowed to fold some secondary structure. Recently Yomo and his colleagues (43.Prijambada I.D. Yomo T. Tanaka F. Kawama T Yamamoto K. Hasegawa A. Shima Y. Negoro S. Urabe I. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) reported that the plasmid library generates numerous artificial proteins, each of which has a unique and randomly chosen amino acid sequence. These proteins are free from evolutional constraints and, except for very rare probability, have no propensity to fold into a certain structure (44.Yamauchi A. Yomo T. Tanaka F. Prijambada I.D. Ohhashi S. Yamamoto K. Shima Y. Ogasahara K. Yutani K. Kataoka M. Urabe I. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of this, we used seven different artificial proteins with 138∼141 amino acids as model substrate proteins of GroEL and found that all of them are able to bind to GroEL. Thus the secondary structure as well as specific sequence motif of the substrate proteins are not necessary for recognition by GroEL. Bovine apo-α-LA1 (type III, Ca2+-depleted), α-casein (from bovine milk), and rhodanese (type II, from bovine liver) were purchased from Sigma. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-T7 tag antibody was purchased from Novagen. pEL237E carrying a gene of the GroEL mutant (L237E), which is unable to bind polypeptide (18.Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using an oligonucleotide GCAACAGCTTCTTCAACCGGTAGCATTTCGCGG. Single-stranded DNA of pET-EL derived from pET21c (Novagen) was obtained by infecting E. coli CJ236 cells with helper phage M13K07 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purification of GroEL from E. coli JM109 cells bearing the expression plasmid pKY206 (45.Ito K. Akiyama Y. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2243-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and GroES was described in Ref. 26.Sakikawa C. Taguchi H. Makino Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21251-21256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar. The GroEL fractions of a butyl-Toyopearl column (Tosoh) were concentrated with ultrafiltration (Amicon) with a 100-kDa cutoff filter (YM100) and were diluted with a buffer containing 20% methanol. This concentration-dilution procedure was repeated three times. GroEL fractions were dialyzed overnight in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and stored at −20 °C after the addition of glycerol (final concentration, 25%). GroES fractions were dialyzed overnight in 20 mm Na-Pi, pH 7.5, and stored at −80 °C. The mutant GroEL (L237E) was purified from E. coli BL21(DE3) cells bearing the pEL237E by the same procedures except that the ammonium sulfate concentration in the lysis buffer and the column buffer was 15% saturation. Proteins with random sequences, RP3-42 and RP3-45, were expressed as soluble proteins in E. coli and purified as follows. E. coli KP3998 expressing the protein was harvested, washed with 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 30 mm NaCl and suspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, containing proteinase inhibitor mixture (CompleteTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The suspension was incubated at 65 °C for 25 min, centrifuged, and the proteins contained in the supernatant were precipitated with a 33% saturation of ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was dissolved in buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and dialyzed to the same buffer. This lysate was applied to a QAE-Toyopearl 550C column (Tosho) equilibrated with buffer A and eluted with a 0–0.2 m NaCl gradient. Fractions containing random sequence proteins were pooled and applied to a butyl-Toyopearl 650 column equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with buffer A and then with water. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of ethanol. Fractions containing random sequence proteins were dialyzed to 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and stored at −80 °C. Random sequence proteins expressed as insoluble proteins were partially purified (>80%) as inclusion bodies by washing with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100. These inclusion bodies were solubilized in 3m urea and stored at −20 °C. Concentrations of RP3-42, RP3-45, rLA, and α-casein were determined spectrophotometrically. Extinction coefficients at 280 nm used for RP3-42, RP3-45, rLA, and α-casein were as in Refs. 44.Yamauchi A. Yomo T. Tanaka F. Prijambada I.D. Ohhashi S. Yamamoto K. Shima Y. Ogasahara K. Yutani K.

Concentrations of wild-type and mutant GroEL and GroES were determined with the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using known concentrations of wild-type GroEL and GroES determined by quantitative amino acid analysis as standards. Concentrations of other proteins were determined with the Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin standard (Pierce). Circular dichroism was measured with a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter at room temperature. A quartz cell with a path length of 0.1 cm was used for far (195–250 nm) ultraviolet regions. The mean residue ellipticity, [θ], was calculated from the equation [θ] = θ/(10 lcn), where θ is the observed ellipticity in millidegrees, l the path length in cm,c is the molar concentration of the protein, andn is the number of amino acid residues in the sequence. Fluorescence spectra of tryptophan by excitation light at 295 nm were measured with a fluorometer (FP-777, Jasco) at 25 °C. Binding of 1-anilino-8-naphtalenesulfonate (ANS) to proteins was assessed by fluorescence (excitation at 370 nm). The solution contained 18 μm proteins and 50 μm ANS in buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and emission spectra (400–700 nm) were measured. ATPase activities were assayed by measuring the amount of produced inorganic phosphate with malachite green (48.Geladopoulos T.P. Sotiroudis T.G. Evangelopoulos A.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The reaction was started by the addition of ATP (final concentration, 2 mm) to the assay solution containing buffer B, 0.5 μm GroEL, and, when indicated, 1 μm RP3-42, 1 μm RP3-45, 1 μmα-casein, 1 μm rLA, and 1 μm GroES. The assay solution was preincubated for 10 min at 25 °C prior to the addition of ATP. The reactions were terminated by the addition of perchloric acid after incubations at 25 °C for 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 40 min. The reaction was linear as a function of time for 10 min. Thus the ATPase activity was obtained from this term. The solution was treated with a malachite green reagent, and the absorbance at 630 nm was measured. 1 μl of random sequence proteins (1 mg/ml) with or without 3 m urea was diluted to 400 μl of buffer B containing 40 μg of GroEL. Then the solution was concentrated with an ultrafiltration centrifuge device (Ultarfree-MC, 100-kDa cutoff filter, Millipore) to approximately 20 μl. This concentrated solution was electrophoresed on 6% polyacrylamide gel without SDS and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Random sequence proteins were detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti T7-tag antibody. Blots were developed with nitro blue tertazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (49.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.74Google Scholar). An expression plasmid library encoding artificial genes for proteins with 138∼141 amino acid residues was made as described previously (43.Prijambada I.D. Yomo T. Tanaka F. Kawama T Yamamoto K. Hasegawa A. Shima Y. Negoro S. Urabe I. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences were nearly random, although randomness was restricted by three factors: the appearance of stop codons was avoided, a T7 epitope tag sequence (11 residues) and linker sequence (6 residues) were introduced at the NH2-terminal region for detection of the proteins, and multiple cloning restriction sites were put into the COOH-terminal region for easy genetic handling. The amino acid sequence at the region of multiple cloning sites (22 residues) of each expressed protein was one of three common sequences arising from three different reading frames. The remaining ∼90-amino acid sequence contained 20 kinds of amino acids and was nearly random. We transformed E. coli by the plasmid library, chose seven colonies expressing proteins, and deduced the amino acid sequences from nucleotide sequences (Fig. 1). Five transformants produced proteins as inclusion bodies that we solubilized in 3m urea, designated as RP3-04, -06, -34, -54, and -64 (insoluble RPs). 2In the original paper (43.Prijambada I.D. Yomo T. Tanaka F. Kawama T Yamamoto K. Hasegawa A. Shima Y. Negoro S. Urabe I. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), RP3-04 and RP3-54 were classified as soluble. However, in this report, these were classified as insoluble because of purification from inclusion bodies. The remaining two, RP3-42 and RP3-45, were expressed as soluble proteins and purified without exposure to urea (soluble RPs). Structures of soluble RPs have been studied previously, and it was suggested that they are rather compact like the molten globule but did not contain a marked secondary structure (44.Yamauchi A. Yomo T. Tanaka F. Prijambada I.D. Ohhashi S. Yamamoto K. Shima Y. Ogasahara K. Yutani K. Kataoka M. Urabe I. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Indeed, CD spectra of soluble RPs (Fig. 2) were very similar to the spectrum of α-casein, a model unfolded protein with no secondary structure. Reference proteins, native holo-LA, and rLA in a lesser degree, showed an α-helix signal, a trough around 222 nm. RP3-42 and -45 did not have a trough at 222 nm or at 214 nm, a β-sheet signal. Another indication of disordered structures of soluble RPs was a deep trough at 190 nm (50.Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1906) Google Scholar). Exposure of the hydrophobic surface to the bulk water phase was assessed by binding of ANS. The relative fluorescence of ANS at 466 nm at the same protein concentration (18 μm) was 100% (apo-LA, a typical molten globule), 57% (RP3-45), 36% (holo-LA), and 18% (RP3-42). In 6 mguanidine HCl, all of the proteins showed no fluorescence (<5%). Taking into account the results from small angle x-ray scattering (44.Yamauchi A. Yomo T. Tanaka F. Prijambada I.D. Ohhashi S. Yamamoto K. Shima Y. Ogasahara K. Yutani K. Kataoka M. Urabe I. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), it was indicated that although soluble RPs lack the secondary structure, they have a compact shape with some hydrophobic surface (RP3-45>RP3-42).Figure 2CD spectra of substrate proteins.

Biol. 1996; 255: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), when substrate proteins such as α-casein and rLA were present, the catalytic cycle of GroEL and GroEL/GroES was accelerated, and the rate of ATP hydrolysis was enhanced (Fig.3). Similarly, RP3-42 and RP3-45 activated the ATPase activity of GroEL and GroEL/GroES. One of the known features of GroEL ATPase activity is the suppression by GroES, and this feature was retained for the natural and soluble RPs. GroEL/GroES-dependent folding of rhodanese from the guanidine HCl-denatured state was inhibited when RP3-42 was present. As the amount of RP3-42 increased, the yield of recovered rhodanese activity decreased, reaching 30% of the original activity in the presence of a 27 molar excess of RP3-42 over rhodanese (data not shown). Similar inhibition was observed for rLA, a well characterized model substrate protein of GroEL. Thus, the soluble RPs compete for the same binding site on GroEL with natural substrate protein. Based on these results we can conclude that GroEL recognizes random sequence proteins as natural substrate proteins. Because GroEL has no tryptophan residue, the change of the intrinsic fluorescence emission spectrum of the substrate protein induced by binding to GroEL reflects solely the change of the local environment around tryptophan residues of the substrate proteins. The binding of RP3-42 and -45 to GroEL caused an increase of fluorescent intensities of about 1.6-fold and blue shifts of the emission maximum from 350.5 to 341.5 nm (RP3-42) and from 347 to 342 nm (RP3-45) (Fig.4 A). Such an increase of fluorescence intensity and blue shift of the maximum emission wavelength were also observed when α-casein bound to GroEL (not shown). These changes are attributable to the increased hydrophobicity around tryptophan residues which results from interaction with hydrophobic residues of polypeptide binding sites of GroEL. We titrated the increase of fluorescence of RPs with varying amounts of GroEL (Fig.4 B). The dissociation constants (K d) were estimated by fitting the data to a simple titration equation, and the values of 17 nm (RP3-42) and 145 nm (RP3-45) were obtained. Interestingly, the binding affinity is not parallel to the extent of hydrophobic surface probed by ANS. The real reason for this apparent discrepancy is not known, but the acidic nature of RP3-45 (pI = 4.9) relative to RP3-42 (pI = 5.5) could attenuate the binding to GroEL, which is also acidic (pI = 4.5). The binding stoichiometry was calculated to be 1.75 and 2.05 mol/mol GroEL, respectively. Binding stoichiometry over the value 2 has been reported in Ref. 54.Clark A.C. Hugo E. Frieden C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5893-5901Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar. When the mixture of GroEL and dansyl-labeled RP3-42 was subjected to gel filtration high performance liquid chromatography, fluorescence was eluted at the position of GroEL, and the prior incubation of the mixture with ATP resulted in a loss of 65% of the fluorescence (data not shown). This indicates that ATP released GroEL-bound RP3-42 from GroEL like a natural substrate protein. The mixture of soluble RPs and GroEL was analyzed with native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.5 A). Both RPs were detected at the position of GroEL. The possibility that GroEL recognized the T7 tag and/or multicloning sequences of RPs, rather than randomized sequence, was excluded because we confirmed that native proteins (green fluorescent protein) with a T7 tag at the NH2 terminus and multicloning sequence at the COOH terminus did not bind to GroEL (data not shown). A GroEL mutant (L237E), in which Leu-237 was replaced by a glutamic acid residue, was shown previously to be unable to bind a natural substrate protein (18.Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L.

This ensured that soluble RPs bind to the normal polypeptide binding site of GroEL. Whether GroEL could bind insoluble RPs was examined by dilution of an RP solution in 3m urea into a GroEL solution followed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5 B). All of the RPs tested bound to GroEL, again failing to bind to mutant GroEL(L237E). Taken together, the results in this report show that secondary structure is not prerequisite for the substrate protein to bind GroEL. The same conclusion can be drawn from the studies using α-casein as a substrate protein and crystal structure of minichaperone in which a peptide with a roughly extended conformation occupied the polypeptide binding site of GroEL (17.Buckle A.M. Zahn R. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3571-3575Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). It should be added, however, that this does not exclude the possibility that some peptides that interact weakly with GroEL adopt a conformation of α-helix when binding to GroEL (37.Brazil B.T.

It is our current view that the polypeptide binding site of GroEL may be flexible enough to accept an α-helix form of peptides that expose hydrophobic residues but that an extended form of peptides with hydrophobic residues should be a more favorite substrate."

This number agrees with the number of potential zinc-binding sites among the 12 different subunits of the enzyme and with our observation that the ninth largest subunit alone is able to bind two zinc ions. The zinc-binding motif in the largest subunit of the enzyme was investigated using mutagenic analysis. Altering any one of the six conserved residues in the zinc-binding motif conferred either a lethal or conditional phenotype, and zinc blot analysis indicated that mutant forms of the domain had a 2-fold reduction in zinc affinity. Mutations in the zinc-binding domain reduced RNA polymerase II activity in cell-free extracts, even though protein blot analysis indicated that the mutant subunit was present in excess of wild-type levels. Purification of one mutant RNA polymerase revealed a subunit profile that was wild-type like with the exception of two subunits not required for core enzyme activity (Rpb4p and Rpb7p), which were missing. Core activity of the mutant enzyme was reduced 20-fold. We conclude that mutations in the zinc-binding domain can reduce core activity without altering the association of any of the subunits required for this activity.

RNA polymerase RNA polymerase II 5-fluoroorotic acid kilobase pair(s) maltose-binding protein nucleotide RNA polymerase lacking subunits Rpb4p and Rpb7p largest subunit of yeast RNAP II gene encoding the largest subunit of yeast RNAP II synthetic complete yeast peptone dextrose zinc-binding domain dithiothreitol wild type Zinc is an integral component of both bacterial and eukaryotic DNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RNAPs)1 and is essential for their function (1.Coleman J.E. Spiro T.G. Zinc Enzymes. John Wiley & Sons, Toronto1983: 219-252Google Scholar). The importance of zinc to the function of RNAP is not well understood; however, studies have suggested that it is required to maintain structure that is important for interactions with the other polymerase subunits and/or with DNA/RNA at the active site. Bacterial RNAP binds two zinc ions that are thought to play a structural role in the formation of the active polymerase (2.Solaiman D. Wu F.Y. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6369-6377Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). One of these two zinc ions is bound in the RNAP largest subunit (β′) by a non-canonical zinc-binding motif (814CX 73CX 6CX 2C898) (3.Markov D. Naryshkina T. Mustaev A. Severinov K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2439-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and the second zinc is thought to be bound by a zinc-binding motif in the amino-terminal end of the β′ subunit. Mutations in the non-canonical domain inhibit the ability of denatured β′ to bind zinc and fold in vitro into a state that is able to form a functional RNAP when added to the other subunits (3.Markov D. Naryshkina T. Mustaev A. Severinov K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2439-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The coordination of this zinc was confirmed by the recent crystal structure ofThermus aquaticus RNAP (4.Zhang G. Campbell E.A. Minakhin L. Richter C. Severinov K. Darst S.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 811-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). The second zinc-binding motif in the amino terminus of the β′ subunit has been implicated along with the carboxyl terminus of the second largest subunit (β) in maintaining the stability of the DNA-RNA-RNAP ternary complex in its elongating phase (5.Nudler E. Avetissova E. Markovtsov V. Goldfarb A. Science. 1996; 273: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the analogous 74-residue segment in the β′ subunit of T. aquaticus RNAP lacks electron density in the crystal structure (4.Zhang G. Campbell E.A. Minakhin L. Richter C. Severinov K. Darst S.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 811-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar) so the coordination of zinc by this domain cannot be confirmed. The β′ and β subunits of Escherichia coli RNAP are orthologs of the first and second largest subunits of eukaryotic RNAP polymerases I, II, and III (reviewed in Refs. 6.Sawadogo M. Sentenac A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 711-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 7.Young R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 689-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 8.Archambault J. Friesen J.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 703-724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the largest subunit of eukaryotic RNA polymerases has no equivalent to the β′ non-canonical zinc-binding motif, they do have an extended form of the bacterial β′ amino-terminal motif (see below) that has similarly been suggested to play a structure-related role. For instance, genetic evidence has implicated the zinc-binding motifs of the largest and second largest subunits of yeast RNAP I in mediating a functional interaction between these two subunits (9.Yano R. Nomura M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 754-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and a mutation in the zinc-binding motif of the largest subunit of RNAP III alters the association of three of the smaller subunits with the core enzyme (16.Werner M. Hermann-Le Denmat S. Treich I. Sentenac A. Thuriaux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The number of zinc ions bound to eukaryotic RNAP is uncertain. In a zinc-blotting assay, zinc binds to 6 of the 12 different subunits of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (10.Treich I. Riva M. Sentenac A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21971-21976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Carles C. Treich I. Bouet F. Riva M. Sentenac A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24092-24096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the number of zinc ions associated with this enzyme was measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy to be only 1 or 2 (12.Lattke H. Weser U. FEBS Lett. 1976; 65: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 13.Mayalagu S. Patturajan M. Chatterji D. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 190: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Here, we attempt to reconcile this apparent contradiction by measuring the zinc content of an affinity purified form of yeast RNAP II. We show that the 9th largest subunit (Rpb9p) alone is able to bind two zinc ions. Each of the subunits thought to bind zinc in yeast RNA polymerase II (see Refs. 10.Treich I. Riva M. Sentenac A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21971-21976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 11.Carles C. Treich I. Bouet F. Riva M. Sentenac A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24092-24096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and Table I) contains a zinc-binding motif of the structural type that forms a secondary structure, which in turn interacts with protein or with nucleic acids. These types of motifs include at least four potential coordinating amino acids, predominantly cysteines, and to a lesser extent histidines, and these potential ligands occur within a relatively small stretch of amino acids (14.Berg J.M. Shi Y. Science. 1996; 271: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar, 15.Vallee B.L. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5647-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar). One such motif (67CX 2CX 6CX 2HX 26CX 2C110) occurs in the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (Rpo21p; also called Rpb1p) and is conserved in the largest subunits of all three RNA polymerases from a variety of eukaryotes (16.Werner M. Hermann-Le Denmat S. Treich I. Sentenac A. Thuriaux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Part of this motif is also conserved in the amino terminus of the bacterial β′ subunit (17.Chatterji D. Guruprasad K. Curr. Sci. 1988; 57: 376-377Google Scholar). Amino acids Arg-47 to Asn-119 of Rpo21p containing this motif were expressed as a fusion protein in E. coli and were shown to bind zinc in a zinc-blotting assay (10.Treich I. Riva M. Sentenac A. J.

As a first step toward understanding the role of zinc in the largest subunit of RNAP II, we mutated those residues in the Rpo21p zinc-binding domain (ZBD) that are both well conserved and capable of coordinating zinc. We determined the effect of conservative substitutions in these residues on viability, the ability of the ZBD to bind zinc in vitro, and the activity and stability of RNAP II core enzyme. We conclude that mutations in the Rpo21p-ZBD are tolerated better than mutations in the analogous ZBD of the RNAP III largest subunit (16.Werner M. Hermann-Le Denmat S. Treich I. Sentenac A. Thuriaux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We also show that one mutation in the Rpo21p-ZBD has an effect on the basal activity of core RNAP II without altering association of any of the subunits required for this activity. RNA polymerase II was prepared using heparin-Sepharose, DEAE-Sephacel, affinity chromatography using 8WG16 monoclonal antibody (18.Thompson N.E. Steinberg T.H. Aronson D.B. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11511-11520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and high pressure liquid chromatography fractionation essentially as described previously (19.Edwards A.M. Darst S.A. Feaver W.J. Thompson N.E. Burgess R.R. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2122-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) with the following changes. Polymerase was prepared from 450 g of bakers' yeast cake stored at −70 °C. Protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2 mm benzamidine) and 10 mm DTT were included throughout the purification. The heparin-Sepharose column was washed with 5 column volumes of buffer A containing 150 mm KCl followed by 10 column volumes containing 200 mm KCl. DE52 resin was used in place of DEAE-Sephacel to remove nucleic acids. Flow-through from the DE52 column was applied directly to 8WG16-Sepharose beads in 500 mm ammonium sulfate and incubated for 4 h with one change of beads. The protein was eluted from the 8WG16-Sepharose beads at 23 °C and was purified further by high pressure liquid chromatography on an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Mono-Q column using a gradient of ammonium sulfate from 70 mm to 1 m in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm DTT (no protease inhibitors were included). RNA polymerase II lacking subunits 4 and 7 (RNAP IIΔ4/7) was a gift from Aled Edwards that was prepared from yeast strain rpb-4 as described previously (19.Edwards A.M. Darst S.A. Feaver W.J. Thompson N.E. Burgess R.R. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2122-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 20.Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. Young R.A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 71-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RNA polymerase II was prepared for atomic absorption spectroscopy and amino acid analysis by dialysis against three changes of 2 liters of buffer D (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm DTT, and 0.5 or 10 mm EDTA) over 6 h at 4 °C. This was followed by dialysis against three changes of 1 liter of metal-free buffer (100 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 1 mmDTT made metal-free by passage over a Chelex 100 ion exchange membrane (Bio-Rad)) over 12 h at 4 °C. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie staining revealed that RNA polymerase II subunits represented greater than 99% of the protein present (Fig.1). Zinc content was determined by Zeeman graphite-furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy at the Best Institute Trace Elements Laboratory (all RNAP IIΔ4/7 samples) or in Dr. J. E. Coleman's laboratory by Matthew Junker and Kevin Gardner (all RNAP II samples) using an Instrumentation Laboratory IL157 spectrophotometer. Zinc content was determined from a standard absorption curve for 1–15 μmzinc. Post-column, phenylisothiocyanate amino acid analysis of samples was performed at the Best Institute HSC/Amersham Pharmacia Biotech center with 25 nmol of norleucine added to assay recovery of the sample after hydrolysis. The concentration of protein was then calculated from the concentration of arginine, alanine, and leucine given the molar ratio of these amino acids to RNAP II or to RNAP IIΔ4/7 (see Refs. 8.Archambault J. Friesen J.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 703-724Crossref PubMed Google Scholarand 21.Kolodziej P.A. Woychik N. Liao S.M. Young R.A. Mol. Cell.

His-tagged Rpb9p, Rpb9p-Zn1 (amino acids Met-1 to Glu-47), and Rpb9p-Zn2 (amino acids Thr-55 to Ser-112) were prepared from E. coli by Sally Hemming (22.Awrey D.E. Weilbaecher R.G. Hemming S.A. Orlicky S.M. Kane C.M. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14747-14754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Each of the proteins retained three amino acids (Gly, Ser, and His) at the amino terminus after removal of the His tag. Zinc stoichiometry was determined for these proteins essentially as described above. Bacterial strains used for site-directed mutagenesis were the E. coli CJ236 (dut1 ung1 thi1 relA1 pCJ105(Cm r)) (23.Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ligation product selections and plasmid amplification were done in the E. coli strain XL1-Blue (recA − (recA1 lac− endA1 gyrA96 thi hsdR17 supE44 relA1{F′ proAB lacI Q lacZΔM15})) from Stratagene. Fusion proteins were made by the E. coli host TB1 (ara Δ(lac proAB) rpsL(phi80 lacZ ΔM15)hsdR) supplied by New England Biolabs. Bacterial media were prepared as described (24.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F.

S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are derivatives of W303–1a (see Table II). The plasmid shuffling scheme (see below) was based on yeast strain YF1703 (constructed by D. Jansma) in which the portion of the RPO21open reading frame extending from the AvrII site (nucleotide (nt) +166; where the A of the initiating methionine codon is +1) to theSnaBI site (nt +5200) has been replaced by aBamHI fragment containing the HIS3 gene. Viability of this strain is maintained on galactose by the maintenance plasmid, pYF1577 (a pAPS2-based (25.Percival-Smith A. Segall J. Mol. Cell.

Two unique sites in pYF1361 (SalI in the pBluescript II KS(+) polylinker and anSpeI site downstream of the zinc-binding motif) encompassed a 2.1-kb fragment containing about 1.5 kb of sequence upstream ofRPO21 and the 5′ end of the RPO21 open reading frame encoding amino acids Met-1 to Ser-221. This 2.1-kb,SalI-SpeI fragment was subcloned from pYF1361 to the polylinker of pBluescript II KS(−) to generate pYF1560. pYF1513 (constructed by D. Jansma) was made by subcloning the 7.2-kb,HindIII, yeast genomic fragment from pYF1361 to pFL39 (TRP1 CEN6 ARS) (30.Bonneaud N. Ozier K.O. Li G.Y. Labouesse M. Minvielle S.L. Lacroute F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar)) whose unique EcoRI site had been destroyed. This left the EcoRI and SpeI sites (nt −312 and +658 respectively; where the A of the initiating methionine codon is +1) in the yeast genomic fragment unique to the plasmid. All DNA manipulations were performed essentially as described (31.Struhl K. Ausebel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, Brooklyn, New York1987: 3.16.1-3.16–10Google Scholar). Antisense, single-stranded DNA was prepared from pYF1560 in E. coli strain CJ236 using the helper bacteriophage R408 as described (32.Russel M. Kidd S. Kelley M.R. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 45: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Second-strand synthesis using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (33.Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar) was primed using a mutagenic oligonucleotide designed to introduce the amino acid change(s) in Rpo21p listed in Fig.2. The double-stranded product was introduced into JF1754 (dut + ung +) to select against the wild-type product. Dideoxynucleotide chain termination method sequencing (34.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) was used to confirm the presence of only the expected mutation(s) between the EcoRI and SpeI sites. These 1-kb EcoRI-SpeI fragments were then subcloned to pYF1513 to replace the wild-type fragment and generate plasmids pYF1547 to pYF1559 carrying mutant allelesrpo21–27 to rpo21–39, respectively. These plasmids, expressing mutant alleles of RPO21 from the endogenous promoter, were introduced (28.Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Laboratory Course Manual for Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar) into the RPO21gene disruption yeast strain, YF1703, where the conferred phenotypes were assayed by plasmid-shuffling analysis (29.Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 232: 164-175Crossref Scopus (1083) Google Scholar); transformants were grown at 23 or 30 °C on SC-glucose medium supplemented with 5-FOA to select for loss of the URA3 maintenance plasmid, pYF1577. Finally, 5-FOAr colonies were streaked to YPD or SC-glucose medium lacking histidine and tryptophan at the following four different temperatures: 16, 23, 30, and 37 °C. These experiments were performed in parallel with pYF1513 (positive control) and pFL39 (negative control) transformants of YF1703. The resulting strains are YF2155 (pYF1513: RPO21) and YF2142-YF2154 (rpo21–27 to rpo21–39). Mutant alleles of RPO21 were introduced into the chromosome by transforming yeast strain YF1733 with plasmids pYF1547 to 1553 and pYF1513 cut with HindIII. Transformants able to grow on glucose medium were screened for an Ade− (pink colored) phenotype. Finally, transformants were selected in which the pYF1577 maintenance plasmid was lost on 5-FOA medium indicating those transformants (YF2063 to YF2070) in which the chromosomalrpo21::ADE2 allele had been replaced by the allele carried on the transforming plasmid DNA (rpo21–27 torpo21–33 and RPO21), respectively. At least two transformants of each allele were tested for growth phenotypes at 23, 30, and 37 °C on YPD medium. The sequence that encodes amino acids Arg-47 to Asn-119 of Rpo21p was amplified as a polymerase chain reaction fragment flanked by BamHI and PstI sites using Taq polymerase and the primers 5′-d(CCCCCGGATCCAGAGCGAAAATTGGTGGTC)-3′ and 5′-d(CCCCCCTGCAGCTAATTATGTTCATCCAGTAATAG)-3′ and either pYF1513 (RPO21), pYF1556 (rpo21–36), pYF1557 (rpo21–37), or pYF1559 (rpo21–39) as template. These fragments were then subcloned in frame to the 3′ end of the coding region for the maltose-binding protein (MBP) in the bacterial expression vector pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs). The resulting fusion proteins were expressed in TB1 E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography on agarose-maltose beads (New England Biolabs) as described by the manufacturer. Each of the protein preparations was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (35.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar); in each case, a single, Coomassie Blue-stained band was observed corresponding to the expected fusion protein product of 52 kDa. The ability of these proteins to bind zinc was assayed using an in vitrozinc-blotting assay previously described (10.Treich I. Riva M. Sentenac A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21971-21976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Negative controls from New England Biolabs included maltose-binding protein alone (MBP2*) and MBP fused to the β-galactosidase-α domain (MBP-LacZ). Preparation of whole-cell yeast extracts and protein blot analysis were performed essentially as described (27.Archambault J. Jansma D.B. Friesen J.D.

The first was the mouse monoclonal antibody 8WG16 (gift of Richard Burgess (37.Thompson N.E. Aronson D.B. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7069-7077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) which recognizes the hypo-phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal domain of Rpo21p (36.Patturajan M. Schulte R.J. Sefton B.M.

Through the generation and characterization of a series of chimeric PSTs, we have previously demonstrated two highly variable regions within their sequences to be responsible for determining their substrate phenotypes (Sakakibara, Y., Takami, Y., Nakayama, T., Suiko, M., and Liu, M.-C. (1998)J. Biol. Chem. 273, 6242–6247). By employing the site-directed mutagenesis technique, the present study aims to identify and quantitatively evaluate the specific amino acid residues critical to the substrate binding and catalysis in these two enzymes. Twelve mutated M-PSTs and seven mutated P-PSTs were generated, expressed, and purified. Enzymatic characterization showed that, of the twelve mutated M-PSTs, mutations at residues Asp-86, Glu-89, and Glu-146 resulted in a dramatic decrease inV max/K m with dopamine as substrate, being greater than 450 times for the D86A/E89I/E146A mutated M-PST. With p-nitrophenol as substrate, theV max/K m determined for the D86A/E89I/E146A-mutated M-PST increased more than 25 times and approached that determined for the wild-type P-PST. These results indicated that the concerted action of the three mutated residues (D86A, E89I, and E146A) is sufficient for the conversion of the substrate phenotype of M-PST to that of P-PST. Among the mutated P-PSTs, the I89E- and A146E-mutated P-PSTs displayed considerable deviations in V max/K m with dopamine or p-nitrophenol as substrate. No corresponding changes, however, were detected with the opposite compound as substrate. These results indicated that, in contrast to M-PST, mutations at Ala-86, Ile-89, and Ala-146 to the corresponding residues in M-PST are not sufficient for rendering the change of P-PST substrate phenotype to that of M-PST. For both M-PSTs and P-PSTs, mutations at Lys-48 or His-108 led to the loss of sulfotransferase activities, indicating their importance in the catalytic mechanism.

Jakoby W.B. Mulder G.J. Conjugation Reactions in Drug Metabolism. Taylor and Francis, Ltd., London1990: 107-161Google Scholar, 2.Falany C. Roth J.A. Jeffery E.H. Human Drug Metabolism: From Molecular Biology to Man. CRC Press, Inc. Boca Raton, FL1993: 101-115Google Scholar, 3.Weinshilboum R. Otterness D. Kaufmann F.C. Conjugation-Deconjugation Reactions in Drug Metabolism and Toxicity. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1994: 45-78Google Scholar). The responsible enzymes, collectively called the cytosolic sulfotransferases, in general catalyze the transfer of a sulfonate group from the active sulfate, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS),1 to a substrate compound containing a hydroxyl or an amino group (4.Lipmann F. Science. 1958; 128: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Based on their amino acid sequences, the cytosolic sulfotransferases found in vertebrates have been classified into two gene families: the phenol sulfotransferase (PST) family (designated SULT1) and the hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase family (designated SULT2) (5.Yamazoe Y. Nagata K. Ozawa S. Kato R. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1994; 92: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 6.Weinshilboum R.M. Otterness D.M. Aksoy I.A. Wood T.C. Her C. Raftogianis R.B. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The PST family presently consists of four subfamilies, PSTs (SULT1A), Dopa/tyrosine (or thyroid hormone) sulfotransferases (SULT1B), hydroxyarylamine (or acetylaminofluorene) sulfotransferases (SULT1C), and estrogen sulfotransferases (SULT1E) (5.Yamazoe Y. Nagata K. Ozawa S. Kato R. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1994; 92: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 6.Weinshilboum R.M. Otterness D.M. Aksoy I.A. Wood T.C. Her C. Raftogianis R.B. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). With the recent discovery of two new human hydroxysteroid sulfotransferases (7.Her C. Wood T.C. Eichler E.E. Mohrenweiser H.W. Ramagli L.S. Siciliano M.J. Weinshilboum R.M. Genomics. 1998; 53: 284-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), the hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase family now comprises two subfamilies designated, respectively, SULT2A and SULT2B. Although the various cytosolic sulfotransferases mentioned above utilize preferentially different compounds as substrates, they share the common requirement for PAPS being the sulfate donor (4.Lipmann F. Science. 1958; 128: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These enzymes, therefore, must in their structures contain binding sites for PAPS and specific substrate compounds. The structural determinants for the PAPS binding activity of the cytosolic sulfotransferases have been rather well characterized. Based on the analysis of aligned sulfotransferase sequences, two highly conserved regions (YPKSGTXW close to the N terminus and RKGXXGDWKNXFT near the C terminus) have been identified (6.Weinshilboum R.M. Otterness D.M. Aksoy I.A. Wood T.C. Her C. Raftogianis R.B. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Of these two regions, the latter resembles the so-called “P-loop” motif found in the sequences of many ATP- and GTP-binding proteins (8.Komatsu K. Driscoll W.J. Koh Y. Strott C.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 1178-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Considering that PAPS is a co-substrate for the sulfation reactions catalyzed by all cytosolic sulfotransferases, it has been proposed that these highly conserved regions may be involved in PAPS binding (5.Yamazoe Y. Nagata K. Ozawa S. Kato R. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1994; 92: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 6.Weinshilboum R.M. Otterness D.M. Aksoy I.A. Wood T.C. Her C. Raftogianis R.B. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 8.Komatsu K. Driscoll W.J. Koh Y. Strott C.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 1178-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Some supporting evidence came from an affinity labeling study using a rat aryl sulfotransferase (9.Zheng Y. Bergold A. Duffel M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30313-30319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which showed the labeling of two amino acid residues (Lys-65 and Cys-66) proximal to the conserved region near the N terminus as mentioned above. With regard to the conserved region near the C terminus, point mutations with alanines substituting for the critical glycine and lysine residues of the P-loop-related sequence in guinea pig estrogen sulfotransferase were shown to result in a dramatic decrease in sulfotransferase activity and an inability to photoaffinity label with [35S]PAPS (8.Komatsu K. Driscoll W.J. Koh Y. Strott C.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 1178-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Another site-directed mutagenesis study using plant flavonol 3-sulfotransferase also revealed the importance of the invariant arginine residue of the P-loop-related sequence in PAPS binding (10.Marsolais F. Varin L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30458-30463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). More recently, studies employing affinity chromatography in conjunction with 31P NMR further demonstrated the involvement of Lys-59, Arg-141, and Arg-277 of flavonol 3-sulfotransferase in the orientation/binding of PAPS (11.Marsolais M. Laviolette M. Kakuta Y. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. Auger M. Varin L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4066-4071Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Compared with the PAPS binding site, less information is available regarding the substrate binding domains of sulfotransferase enzymes. Studies using plant flavonol 3-sulfotransferase and flavonol 4-sulfotransferase, which display distinct substrate and position specificity, have revealed an internal region spanning amino acid residues 92–194 of flavonol 3-sulfotransferase as being responsible for its substrate and position specificity (12.Varin L. Marsolais F. Brisson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12498-12502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Another study using rat liver hydroxysteroid sulfotransferases as model enzymes showed that the central region spanning amino acid residues 102–164 is essential for the hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase activity (13.Tamura H. Morioka Y. Homma H. Matsui M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 341: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Precise structural determinants for the substrate specificity and/or catalytic activity for both these two sulfotransferase models, however, remain largely unknown. Through the generation and characterization of a series of chimeric PSTs, in comparison with wild-type human M-PST and P-PST, we have recently demonstrated two highly variable regions (Fig.1, designated I and II) present within the sequence spanning amino acid residues 84–148 to be critical for their distinct substrate phenotypes (14.Sakakibara Y. Takami Y. Nakayama T. Suiko M. Liu M.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6242-6247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). By employing the site-directed mutagenesis technique, we have embarked on the analysis of amino acid residues that are important for the substrate binding/catalysis of M-PST and P-PST. We report in this communication the results on the generation and characterization of a series of point-mutated M-PSTs and P-PSTs. Dopamine, p-nitrophenol (pNP), ampicillin, aprotinin, thrombin, adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), Taps, Trizma base, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside were products of Sigma. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit and XL1-BlueEscherichia coli competent cells were purchased from Stratagene. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Operon Technologies, Inc. pGEX-2TK glutathione S-transferase gene fusion vector and glutathione-Sepharose 4B were products of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. cDNAs encoding human M-PST or P-PST, packaged in pGEX-2TK vector, were prepared as described previously (14.Sakakibara Y. Takami Y. Nakayama T. Suiko M. Liu M.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6242-6247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Carrier-free sodium [35S]sulfate was from ICN Biomedicals. Recombinant human bifunctional ATP sulfurylase/adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate kinase was prepared as described previously (15.Yanagisawa K.

Chromatogram cellulose thin-layer chromatography plates were from Eastman Kodak Company. All other chemicals were of the highest grades commercially available. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene was used for the generation of point-mutated PSTs. Briefly, wild-type M-PST or P-PST cDNA packaged in pGEX-2TK prokaryotic expression vector was used as the template in conjunction with specific mutagenic primers (see TableI for the mutagenic primers used). The amplification conditions were 12 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 15 min at 68 °C. The mutated M-PST and P-PST sequences were verified by nucleotide sequencing (16.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52674) Google Scholar). pGEX-2TK vector harboring individual mutated PST sequence was transformed into competent XL1-Blue E. coli cells. The transformed cells, grown to A 600 nm = ∼0.5 in 1 liter of LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight at room temperature, were collected by centrifugation and homogenized in 20 ml of an ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) using an Aminco French press. The crude homogenate thus prepared was subjected to centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant collected was fractionated using 0.5 ml of glutathione-Sepharose, and the bound fusion protein was treated with 2 ml of a thrombin digestion buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2) containing 5 units/ml bovine thrombin. Following a 1-h incubation at room temperature with constant agitation, 5 μg of aprotinin were added to inactivate thrombin, and the preparation was subjected to centrifugation. The recombinant enzyme present in the supernatant collected was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to the enzymatic characterization as described below.Table IMutagenic oligonucleotide primers used for the generation of mutated human M-PSTs and P-PSTsFor mutated M-PSTs N85K5′-CCCTTCCTTGAGGTCAA A GATCCAGGGGAACCC-3′ D86A5′-CCTTGAGGTCAATG C TCCAGGGGAACCCTCAGG-3′ E89I5′-GGTCAATGATCCAGGG ATC CCCTCAGGGCTGGAGAC-3′ N85K/D86A5′-CCCTTCCTTGAGGTCAA A G C TCCAGGGGAACCCTCAGG-3′ D86A/E89I5′-CCTTGAGGTCAATG C TCCAGGG ATC CCCTCAGGGCTGGAG-3′ N85K/E89I5′-CCTTGAGGTCAA A GATCCAGGG AT ACCCTCAGGGCTGGAG-3′ E146A5′-CCATTTCCACCGTATGG C AAAGGCGCACCCTGAGC-3′ D86A/E89I/E146AaGenerated by using D86A/E89I- or K48M-mutated M-PST cDNA packaged in pGEX-2TK as template in conjunction with E146A or H108A mutagenic primers.

Sulfotransferase activities of purified point-mutated M-PSTs and P-PSTs were assayed using [35S]PAPS as the sulfate donor. The standard assay mixture, with a final volume of 30 μl, contained 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (or 50 mm Taps, NaOH, pH 8.0), 14 μm [35S]PAPS (15 Ci/mmol), and 10 μm pNP (or 10 μm dopamine). For kinetic studies, varying concentrations of pNP or dopamine were used. The reaction was started by the addition of the enzyme preparation, allowed to proceed for 10 min at 37 °C, and terminated by heating at 100 °C for 2 min. The precipitates formed were cleared by centrifugation. The clear supernatant was subjected to the analysis of35S-sulfated pNP or dopamine based on the thin-layer chromatography procedure previously established (17.Liu M.-C. Lipmann F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3695-3698Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). [35S]PAPS (15 Ci/mmol) was synthesized from ATP and [35S]sulfate using recombinant human bifunctional ATP sulfurylase/adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate kinase as described previously (15.Yanagisawa K.

SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on a 12% polyacrylamide gel using the method of Laemmli (18.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Protein determination was based on the method of Bradford (19.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Cytosolic sulfotransferase enzymes in general catalyze the transfer of a sulfonate group from PAPS, the sulfate donor, to the hydroxyl groups or amino groups of substrate compounds. Two essential components of their catalytic actions therefore are the PAPS binding activity (which is common among various sulfotransferases) and the substrate binding activity (which is unique for individual sulfotransferases). Whereas the structural determinants for the former, designated the “signature sequences” (TYPKSGTXW and RKGXXGDWKXXFT) (6.Weinshilboum R.M. Otterness D.M. Aksoy I.A. Wood T.C. Her C. Raftogianis R.B. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), have been rather well documented, not much information is currently available concerning the latter. In view of the fact that the human M-PST and P-PST are >93% identical in their primary sequences (20.Wood T.C. Aksoy I.A. Aksoy S. Weinshilboum R.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 1119-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 21.Zhu X. Veronese M.E. Sansom L.N. McManus M.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Roth J.A. Jeffery E.H. Human Drug Metabolism: From Molecular Biology to Man. CRC Press, Inc. Boca Raton, FL1993: 101-115Google Scholar, 3.Weinshilboum R. Otterness D. Kaufmann F.C.

Acta. 1997; 1355: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), these two enzymes serve as an excellent model for investigating the structural basis for their functional differences. The underlying rationale for the present study is that the distinct amino acid residues may be responsible for their differential substrate specificity and other properties. Whereas amino acid residues that are conserved not only between these two enzymes but also among the sulfotransferases from other vertebrates may be critical to the general catalytic process. Examining the aligned amino acid sequences of M-PST and P-PST (20.Wood T.C. Aksoy I.A. Aksoy S. Weinshilboum R.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 1119-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 21.Zhu X. Veronese M.E. Sansom L.N. McManus M.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), two variable regions, designated I and II, were noted (Fig. 1). We have therefore hypothesized that these two regions may contain the structural determinants for the substrate specificity and other distinct properties of these two homologous enzymes. Through the generation and characterization of a series of chimeric PSTs, in comparison with wild-type M-PST and P-PST, we have demonstrated unequivocally the substrate phenotypes of the two PSTs to be indeed determined by the two variable regions (14.Sakakibara Y. Takami Y. Nakayama T. Suiko M. Liu M.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6242-6247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A distinct feature of the two variable regions, upon closer examination of the aligned M-PST and P-PST sequences (cf. Fig. 1), is the presence of a good number of charged amino acid residues, e.g. Asp-86, Glu-89, His-143, Arg-144, Glu-146, and Lys-147 of M-PST, and Lys-85, His-144, and Lys-147 of P-PST. In view of the fact that the M-PST is more capable of catalyzing the sulfation of charged compounds such as dopamine (which contains a positively charged amino group) and Dopa (which contains both a positively charged α-amino group and a negatively charged α-carboxyl group) and that the P-PST utilizes preferentially uncharged phenolic compounds as substrates, it is possible that these charged residues may in fact account for their differential enzymatic properties. By employing the site-directed mutagenesis technique, we attempted in the present study to verify the roles of these charged amino acid residues in determining the distinctive substrate phenotypes of M-PST and P-PST, as well as those that are important for the general catalytic process of the sulfation reaction. Based on the procedure described under “Experimental Procedures,” wild-type M-PST and P-PST cDNAs and the point-mutated PST cDNAs packaged in pGEX-2TK prokaryotic expression vector were individually transformed into E. coli host cells for expressing the recombinant enzymes. As shown in Fig. 2, the recombinant wild-type and point-mutated PSTs fractionated from the homogenates of transformed E. coli cells using glutathione-Sepharose and cleaved off the bound fusion proteins by thrombin digestion appeared to be highly homogeneous upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It was noted that, despite their similar predicted molecular masses, there were considerable differences in electrophoretic mobility among wild-type M-PST and P-PST and the various point-mutated PSTs (cf. Fig. 1). It is at present unknown whether these differential electrophoretic mobilities are because of the charge differences between wild-type M-PST and P-PST, as well as the various mutated PSTs with charged amino acid residues being replaced by uncharged residues (or vice versa), resulting in the gain or loss of positive or negative charges. Another possibility is that, despite the SDS-denaturation in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol, the various wild-type and mutated M-PSTs and P-PSTs may still possess conformational differences that in turn contribute to their distinct electrophoretic mobilities. Although the reasons are unclear, this aberrant phenomenon has been well documented for wild-type, chimeric, and mutated human PSTs (14.Sakakibara Y. Takami Y. Nakayama T. Suiko M. Liu M.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6242-6247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 24.Veronese M.E. Burgess W. Zhu X. McManus M.E. Biochem.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10474-10479Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to examine whether these differences in electrophoretic mobility correlate with the distinct thermostability and/or other enzymatic properties of the mutated M-PSTs and P-PSTs. To characterize the point-mutated PSTs prepared, we first assayed the sulfotransferase activities of the mutated PSTs using dopamine (a preferred substrate for M-PST) and p-NP (a preferred substrate for P-PST). Of the nine mutated M-PSTs containing mutations within the two variable regions, three (D86A/E89I, E146A, and D86A/E89I/E146A) displayed dramatically lower activities toward dopamine. Interestingly, whereas the activity of D86A/E89I toward p-NP remained comparable to that of wild-type M-PST, E146A and D86A/E89I/E146A became nearly an order of magnitude more active. These results suggested that Glu-146 may play a critical role in determining the substrate phenotype of M-PST. The three mutated M-PSTs with mutations at Lys-48 and/or His-108 exhibited little or virtually no sulfotransferase activities toward either dopamine or pNP, indicating the possible involvement of these two residues in the catalytic mechanism of the sulfation reaction. It is to be pointed out that analysis of the crystal structure of mouse estrogen sulfotransferase has revealed that His-108 may act as the proton acceptor in the reaction mechanism of the sulfation of 17β-estradiol (28.Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. Nature Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of Lys-59 (Lys-48 in both M-PST and P-PST) of plant flavonol 3-sulfotransferase suggested its involvement in the proper orientation of the phosphosulfate group of the co-substrate, PAPS, for catalysis (11.Marsolais M. Laviolette M. Kakuta Y. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. Auger M. Varin L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4066-4071Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Of the seven mutated P-PSTs, three (A146E, I89E/A146E, and A86D/I89E/A146E) displayed dramatically lower activities toward pNP. In contrast to the mutated M-PSTs containing the E146A mutation, the mutated P-PSTs with the A146E mutation exhibited no increase in their activities toward dopamine. These results indicated that, unlike in the case of M-PST, mutation at Ala-146 is not sufficient to render any significant change in substrate phenotype of P-PST to that of M-PST. Similar to M-PST, however, the two mutated P-PSTs with mutations at Lys-48 or His-108 also resulted in the complete loss of the activities toward either dopamine or pNP. To examine more closely the mechanistic roles of the specific amino acid residues in these mutated PSTs, their kinetic constants were determined. As shown in Table II, wild-type M-PST and P-PST, as anticipated, displayed distinct substrate specificities, with the former having higherV max/K m for dopamine and the latter having higherV max/K m forp-nitrophenol. Of the twelve mutated M-PSTs, the nine mutated at residues present in the two variable regions exhibited different V max/K m values (with either dopamine or pNP as substrate) because of variations inK m and V max values in comparison with those of wild-type M-PST. Mutations at residues Asp-86, Glu-89, and Glu-146 resulted in an increase in K m, while with varying effects on V max, with dopamine as substrate. It is particularly notable that the mutation of Glu-146 to Ala resulted in a greater than 54 times increase inK m and two times decrease inV max. With combined mutations at Asp-86, Glu-89, and Glu-146 to the corresponding residues found in wild-type P-PST, the increase in K m and decrease inV max were even more dramatic, and the values determined with dopamine as substrate were very close to those determined for wild-type P-PST (cf. Table II). With pNP as substrate, the K m value decreased more than 22 times for both E146A- and D86A/E89I/E146A-mutated M-PSTs. For the D86A/E89I/E146A-mutated M-PST, the catalytic efficiency, as reflected by V max/K m, with pNP as substrate increased by 25 times and approached that determined for wild-type P-PST. These results combined indicated that residue Glu-146, similar to that reported in two other studies (25.Dajani R. Hood A.M. Coughtrie M.W.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 27.Brix L.A. Barnett A.C. Duggleby R.G. Leggett B. McManus M.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10474-10479Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), plays an important role in determining the substrate phenotype of M-PST. The concerted action of three mutated residues (D86A, E89I, and E146A), however, is required for the complete change in substrate phenotype of M-PST to that of P-PST. Of the two residues hypothesized to be involved in catalysis, mutation of Lys-48 to Met in M-PST resulted in a complete loss of sulfotransferase activity toward either dopamine or pNP. Mutation of His-108 to Ala, although exerting only a small increase inK m, resulted in an 18 times decrease inV max with dopamine as substrate, supporting its involvement in the catalytic process. Similar to the K48M and H108A mutated M-PSTs, mutations at Lys-48 and His-108 in P-PST also resulted in a complete loss of sulfotransferase activity toward either pNP or dopamine. Of the other five mutated P-PSTs, mutation of Ile-89 to Glu, whereas exerting little effects on the activity toward pNP, resulted in a greater than two times increase in V max with dopamine as substrate. Mutation of Ala-146 to Glu resulted in a greater than five time decrease inV max/K m with pNP as substrate. There was, however, no corresponding increase inV max/K m with dopamine as substrate. Interestingly, combined mutations at Ile-89 and Ala-146 resulted in a tremendous decrease of sulfotransferase activity toward pNP, causing difficulty in accurately determiningV max and K m with pNP as substrate. With an additional mutation at Ala-86, the A86D/I89E/A146E-mutated P-PST no longer displayed high enough sulfotransferase activities for reliable kinetic constant determination with either pNP or dopamine as substrate. These results combined indicated that, in contrast to M-PST, mutations at Ala-86, Ile-89, and Ala-146 to the corresponding residues found in M-PST are not sufficient for rendering the change in substrate phenotype of P-PST to that of M-PST.Table IIKinetic constants of wild-type and mutated M-PSTs and P-PSTs with dopamine and p-nitrophenol as substratesEnzymeDopaminep-NitrophenolK mV maxV max/K mK mV maxV max/K mmmnmol/min/mgmmnmol/min/mgWild-type M-PST0.4412.127.428.210.50.37 N85K0.7212.517.431.78.50.27 D86A1.335.003.7670.418.20.26 E89I1.1112.511.320.66.060.29 N85K/D86A3.647.692.1121.58.020.37 D86A/E89I14.322.21.5524.14.440.18 N85K/E89I0.5410.2018.934.56.890.20 E146A23.85.880.251.274.123.24D86A/E89I/E146A44.92.740.061.2111.49.39 H143Y1.1813.711.6031.310.90.35 K48M—aNot determined due to undetectable or low level of activity.————— H108A0.550.671.22——— K48M/H108A——————Wild-type P-PST47.62.890.060.538.8116.6 I89E45.56.290.140.466.2115.5 A146E90.97.520.081.274.123.23 K48M—————— H108A—————— A86D/I89E59.93.870.060.495.5011.2 I89E/A146E61.74.290.07———A86D/I89E/A146E——————Assay conditions were as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data shown represent mean values derived from three determinations.a Not determined due to undetectable or low level of activity.

Fig. 1) in determining the substrate phenotypes of M-PST and P-PST. Previous studies by us and others have demonstrated that M-PST and P-PST differ not only in substrate phenotype but also in thermostability, inhibitor sensitivity, manganese dependence, and stereoselectivity (2.Falany C.

It will be interesting to investigate whether (some of) the amino acid residues examined in the present study are also critical in determining these latter distinct properties between the two enzymes."

Proton release and uptake kinetics were measured directly at either surface by using the unique cysteine residue as attachment site for the pH indicator fluorescein.

For membrane-bound G-protein-coupled receptors analogous effects are expected to be of considerable functional significance. For this class of proteins ligand binding occurs mostly on the extracellular surface resulting in the active form of the receptor with binding and activation of the G-protein at the opposite cytoplasmic surface of the protein. The membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin (bR)1 shares the heptahelical bundle motif with G-protein-coupled receptors. In this report, we present evidence for long range interactions between the extracellular and cytoplasmic parts of bR based on evidence from the mutant R82A and its second site revertant R82A/G231C. Bacteriorhodopsin acts as a light-driven proton pump in the plasma membrane of the archaebacterium Halobacterium salinarium. A retinylidene chromophore is bound via a protonated Schiff base linkage to Lys-216. Upon flash excitation bR undergoes a cyclic photoreaction with distinct spectroscopic intermediates and proton translocation from one side of the membrane to the other (for reviews see Refs. 3.Lanyi J.K.

In the first half of this photocycle, the Schiff base becomes deprotonated during the transition to the M-intermediate, and in the same time range a proton is released at the extracellular surface (6.Alexiev U. Marti T. Heyn M.P. Khorana H.G. Scherrer P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13693-13699Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). During the second half of the photocycle, the Schiff base is reprotonated from Asp-96 (7.Otto H. Marti T. Holz M. Mogi T. Lindau M. Khorana H.G. Heyn M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the proton release pathway, Asp-85 has been identified as the primary acceptor of the proton from the Schiff base by site-directed mutagenesis and Fourier transform infrared difference spectroscopy (8.Braiman M.S.

In the three-dimensional structure of the unphotolyzed bR, a defined density for the arginine 82 side chain, has recently been resolved by x-ray crystallography at a resolution of 2.5 (17.Pebay-Peyroula E.

The proposed movement of this side chain toward the extracellular surface upon formation of the M-intermediate, based on computer calculations (18.Scharnagl C. Fischer S.F. Chem.

In R82A an accelerated deprotonation of the Schiff base and a reversed order of proton release and uptake, detected with pH indicator dyes in the aqueous solution, were already observed (20.Otto H. Marti T. Holz M. Mogi T. Stern L.J. Engel F. Khorana H.G. Heyn M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1018-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 21.Balashov S.P. Govindjee R.

Moreover, in R82A the pK a of Asp-85, which controls the purple to blue transition, is increased by about 5 pH units compared with wild type (wt) (22.Subramaniam S. Marti T. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). These dramatic changes are because of the replacement of the positively charged arginine by the neutral alanine. We have used time-resolved absorbance spectroscopy in combination with pH-sensitive dyes (pyranine in the aqueous bulk phase and fluorescein derivatives attached at specific sites on the protein surface) to detect the kinetics of the photocycle and of proton release and uptake. To detect proton concentration changes separately on each surface of the protein, the attachment site (single cysteine residue) for the pH indicator dye at the surface of the mutant protein R82A was varied. We have used the single cysteine residue in position 72 at the extracellular surface and in the positions 160 and 231 at the cytoplasmic surface as attachment sites. Fig.1 shows a tertiary structural model of bR based on x-ray crystallographic data (23.Essen L.-O. Siegert R. Lehmann W.D. Oesterhelt D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11673-11678Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The positions of the residues Gly-72, Arg-82, Ala-160, and Gly-231 are indicated. Unexpectedly, the cysteine mutation in position 231 at the end of helix G on the cytoplasmic surface leads to an almost complete restoration of the photocycle, pK a of Asp-85, and proton pumping in the double mutant R82A/G231C. The cysteine double mutant R82A/A160C, also with a cysteine mutation on the cytoplasmic surface (EF loop), has on the other hand still all the altered properties of the single mutant R82A. The reversion effect observed only at position Gly-231 suggests an interaction between helices C (Arg-82) and G (Gly-231). The second site revertant produced by the replacement of glycine by cysteine at the cytoplasmic surface of the protein far away from the location of the first mutation (R82A) can shed light on the molecular mechanisms that promote long range interactions in 7-helix transmembrane proteins. Such allosteric interactions are expected to be important for ligand binding and signal transduction in G-protein-coupled receptors (24.Thomas E.A. Carson M.J. Neal M.J. Sutcliffe G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14115-14119Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). 1,2-Dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and Tris-(hydroxy-methyl)-aminomethane (Tris) were obtained from Sigma.

Sephadex G-25 (fine) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 5-(iodoacetamido)fluorescein and 5-(bromomethyl)fluorescein (BMF) were from Molecular Probes. The preparation and expression of the bR mutants A160C and G231C inH. salinarium, in which cysteine replaces Ala-160 and Gly-231, respectively, and the preparation of R82A, in which alanine is substituted for arginine in position 82, has been reported (25.Alexiev U.

The bR double mutants R82A/A160C and R82A/G231C were prepared by following the described procedures (26.Krebs M.P. Mollaaghababa R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Solubilization of bR membrane fragments and regeneration of bR in DMPC/CHAPS micelles were performed as described (27.Liao M.-J. London E. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9949-9955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The regeneration procedure was modified according to Ref. 28.Scherrer P. Alexiev U. Marti T. Khorana H.G. Heyn M.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13684-13692Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar. After regeneration the retinal band is shifted back completely to 550 nm, resulting in 96–100% regeneration, using an estimated extinction coefficent of ε550 ≈ 56,000 m−1cm−1. Labeling with 5-(iodoacetamido)- and 5-(bromomethyl)-fluorescein and the determination of the labeling stoichiometry were performed as described (25.Alexiev U. Mollaaghababa R. Scherrer P.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13684-13692Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Flash spectroscopy and data analysis with a sum of exponentials were performed as described elsewhere (7.Otto H. Marti T. Holz M. Mogi T. Lindau M. Khorana H.G. Heyn M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9228-9232Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The excitation was with 10-ns pulses of 3–6 mJ of energy at 590 or 500 nm. Under these conditions about 15% of bR are cycling. Typically 30–50 time traces were averaged for the kinetics of the M-intermediate and 70–100 for the dye kinetics. Proton release and uptake were detected in the aqueous bulk medium of the purple membrane suspension, containing 4–15 μm bR in 150 mm KCl, by calculating the difference of the measured flash-induced absorbance changes at 450 nm between samples with and without 45 μm pyranine at pH 7.3 and 22 °C (25.Alexiev U.

Chem. 1995; 35: 401-414Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The light-induced proton concentration changes, detected in samples with fluorescein attached to cysteine residues in bR, were determined by calculating the measured flash-induced absorbance difference at 495 nm between samples with and without 10 mm Tris or MOPS buffer, pH 7.3, in 150 mm KCl at 22 °C (25.Alexiev U. Mollaaghababa R. Scherrer P. Khorana H.G. Heyn M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 29.Moltke S. Alexiev U. Heyn M.P. Isr. J. Chem. 1995; 35: 401-414Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Titration experiments and analysis were performed as described in (30.Alexiev U. Marti T. Heyn M.P. Khorana H.G. Scherrer P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To obtain the apparent pK a, the measured absorbance changes were fitted with the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.ΔA=ΔAmax/(1+10n(pKa−pH))Equation 1 ΔA max is the maximal absorbance difference, n is the number of protons involved in the transitions and pK a is the midpoint of the titration. The data plotted in Fig. 4 were fitted with the following equation described by Balashov et al. (21.Balashov S.P. Govindjee R. Kono M. Imasheva E. Lukashev E. Ebrey T.G. Crouch R.K. Menick D.R. Feng Y. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10331-10343Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar),ΔA=α/(α+β*γ)Equation 2 with α = 1 + 10(pH − pK3), β = 1 + 10(pH − pK2), and γ = 10(pH − pK1). The position of the maximum of the visible absorbance spectrum of bacteriorhodopsin reflects the charge distribution in the vicinity of the retinylidene chromophore. Fig.2 shows the absorption spectra of wt bR in the unphotolyzed state and that of the mutants R82A, G231C, and R82A/G231C in 150 mm KCl at pH 6. The chromophore absorbance maxima (λmax) of wt, G231C, and R82A/G231C are nearly identical (568, 568, and 567 nm, respectively, in the light-adapted form). In the single mutant R82A λmax is red shifted about 40 nm compared with wt to 602 nm. In the mutant R82A/G231C, the additional mutation G231C at the cytoplasmic surface (C terminus) restores the wt absorbance spectrum and, therefore, presumably the charge distribution in the vicinity of the chromophore. The absorption spectrum of unphotolyzed bR is characterized by a purple form with a λmax of 568 nm around neutral pH, as shown above, which changes to a blue form at acidic pH with a λmax of about 602 nm. In wt the pK a of this so called purple to blue transition is about 2.6 (in 150 mm KCl). It has been shown that this transition reflects the protonation state of the primary proton acceptor Asp-85 (22.Subramaniam S. Marti T. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 31.Metz G. Siebert F. Engelhard M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The purple to blue transition is directly affected by the proton concentration at the protein surface, which depends on the surface charge (30.Alexiev U. Marti T. Heyn M.P. Khorana H.G. Scherrer P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 32.Szundi I. Stoeckenius W. Biophys. J. 1989; 56: 369-383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Therefore, the apparent pK a of this transition is strongly dependent on ionic strength. We have compared the pK a values of the purple to blue transition in the various mutants at a given salt concentration. The pH titration curves of wt and the different mutants in 150 mm KCl are shown in Fig. 3. The absorbance changes at 628 nm are plotted as a function of pH. The data were fitted to Equation 1. In wild type the Hill coefficient of n ≈ 1.6 indicates a cooperative effect in the protonation/deprotonation reaction of the Asp-85 carboxyl group (33.Mowery P. Lozier R. Chae Q. Tseng Y.-W. Stoeckenius W. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 12: 88-118Google Scholar). In the bR mutant R82A, the pK a of the purple to blue transition is shifted from 2.6 to 7.3 (n = 0.8). In the double mutants R82A/G72C and R82A/A160C, the pK a values of the purple to blue transition are 7.2 and 7.3, respectively (data not shown),i.e. similar to that of the single mutant R82A. In the double mutant R82A/G231C, however, in which the second mutation is located at the cytoplasmic surface at the end of helix G, the pK a of the purple to blue transition is shifted completely back to the wild type value, even to a somewhat lower number (pK a = 2.1, n = 0.9). The single mutant G231C has a pK a of 2.7 (n = 1.1), similar to that of wild type. Note that for all mutants then value is close to 1 (0.8–1.1) and clearly smaller than for wild type (1.6). The pK a and n values are summarized in Table I.Table IpKa values and Hill coefficients (n) of the blue to purple transition of bR wild type and various mutantsbRpK anwt2.61.6G231C2.71.1R82A7.30.8R82A/G72C7.20.8R82A/A160C7.30.8R82A/G231C2.10.9The purple to blue transition was measured as the absorbance increase at 628 nm in the dark in 150 mm KCl at room temperature (22 °C). The pK a was fitted using Equation 1. The errors in pK a and n are approximately 0.05. Open table in a new tab The purple to blue transition was measured as the absorbance increase at 628 nm in the dark in 150 mm KCl at room temperature (22 °C). The pK a was fitted using Equation 1. The errors in pK a and n are approximately 0.05. For wt and the mutant R82A/G231C the pH titration was also performed in the regenerated form in CHAPS/DMPC micelles. Doing the titration with bR micelles has the advantage of having a higher fraction of the blue state at alkaline pH values than is the case with membranes. pH-dependent absorption spectra of wt and the mutant were recorded between pH 1 and 9.5. In Fig. 4the fraction of the blue membrane of the double mutant is plottedversus the pH. The titration data were analyzed according to the model proposed by Balashov et al. (21.Balashov S.P. Govindjee R. Kono M. Imasheva E. Lukashev E. Ebrey T.G. Crouch R.K. Menick D.R. Feng Y. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10331-10343Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) using Equation 2. The scheme in the inset of Fig. 4 describes the coupling between the pK values of residues Asp-85 and another group denoted X'H (probably Glu-204) and their dependence on the ionization state of each of the residues. The pK a values of wt and the double mutant R82A/G231C are presented in the scheme. The comparison of the pK a values clearly shows that in the double mutant R82A/G231C the pK a of Asp-85 in the presence of the protonated group X'H is shifted back from 6.9 in R82A (pK in micelles (30.Alexiev U. Marti T. Heyn M.P. Khorana H.G. Scherrer P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar)) to 3.0, i.e. lower than the wild type value (pK a = 4.7). This should be compared with the Asp-85 pK a value of 2.6 and 2.1 in membranes for wt and R82A/G231C, respectively (TableI). These results indicate that the electrostatic environments for these residues (Asp-85 and X'H) differ in the double mutant and in wt. Also the pK a of Asp-85 in the presence of the deprotonated group X'−(like in the M-state), pK a = 5.8, differs slightly from the wild type value (pK a = 6.3). Similar shifts are observed for the pK a of X'H in the double mutant R82A/G231C, i.e. the pK a of X'H in the presence of the deprotonated Asp-85 is 7.5 for wild type and 6.7 for the double mutant. The corresponding numbers in the membrane fragments are 9.6 and 9.0, respectively. The kinetics of light-dark adaptation of the chromophore in the unphotolyzed state of bR is also controlled by the protonation state of Asp-85 (12.Balashov S.P. Imasheva E.S. Govindjee R. Ebrey T.G. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 473-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In the light-adapted state the retinylidene chromophore is 100% in the all trans conformation. In the dark adapted state, the chromophore is in an equilibrium between the alltrans (34%) and 13-cis (66%) configurations (34.Scherrer P. Mathews M.K. Sperling W. Stoeckenius W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In wt-bR the pH dependence of the dark adaptation rate and the fraction of molecules in the blue state were shown to be the same (12.Balashov S.P. Imasheva E.S. Govindjee R. Ebrey T.G. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 473-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We have measured the dark adaptation rate for wt, R82A, G231C, and R82A/G231C at selected pH values (data not shown). wt and the single mutant G231C have similar values of kDA ≈ 2.3–2.5 × 10−4 s−1 at pH 6. In the double mutant R82A/G231C a slightly higher value of 3.3 × 10−4 s−1 (pH 6) was observed. The fastest rate was observed for R82A with kDA ≈ 120 × 10−4 s−1 at pH 7.3. In wt the fastest rates are measured at acidic pH, where also the highest fraction of blue membrane was observed. Therefore, the faster rate for R82A,kDA ≈ 120 × 10−4s−1, compared with wt, kDA ≈ 2.3 × 10−4 s−1, and the close values for wt, G231C, and R82A/G231C are in qualitative agreement with the results obtained from the blue to purple chromophore titration. The formation and decay of the M-intermediate represent the deprotonation and reprotonation, respectively, of the Schiff base during the photocycle. We believe that a low pK a of the proton acceptor Asp-85 and a wild type-like dark isomerization rate are prerequisites for wild type like photocycling and proton pumping (for further details see “Discussion”). Because, as shown in the previous section, these two prerequisites are fulfilled in the double mutant R82A/G231C, one may expect a restoration of wild type kinetics of the photocycle and of proton release and uptake. In Fig. 5 the time courses of the M-intermediate (absorbance changes measured at 410 nm) are shown for wild type, R82A, and R82A/G231C measured at the same protein concentrations in 150 mm KCl at pH 7.3 and 22 °C. The amplitudes of the M-intermediates are normalized to the wild type value, which was set to 1. For R82A and R82A/G231C the amplitude scaling factors were 5 and 1.15, respectively. The apparent time constants and amplitudes for the kinetics of the M-rise and decay are given in Tables II and III. The transient absorption spectra of Fig. 5 show that in comparison to wild type the rise of M in R82A is accelerated by approximately a factor of 10, whereas the decay is faster by less than a factor of 2. In the double mutant R82A/G231C on the other hand, the kinetics of the rise of M are virtually identical to that of wild type, and the decay is delayed by about a factor of 2. The major effect in R82A, the greatly altered rise of M, is thus restored in the double mutant. Fig.6 shows the photocycle kinetics at three selected wavelengths (410, 570, and 650 nm) of wild type and the mutants G231C and R82A/G231C. These three wavelengths were chosen because they are diagnostic for the kinetics of the M intermediate (410 nm) of the L intermediate and ground state depletion (570 nm) and of the K and O intermediates (650 nm). The data of Fig. 6 show that the photocycles of these three samples are closely similar until about 1 ms. Small differences are apparent in the second half of the cycle with a slow down of the later intermediates N and O in particular in G231C. A multiexponential global fit of the photocycle, measured at 17 different wavelengths between 370 and 690 nm with a sum of 7 exponentials, was applied for each mutant and wild type. The fit results in the following seven time constants for wild type, 1.2/40/138 μs and 0.71/2.11/6.18/15.2 ms; for G231C, 1.0/22/98 μs and 1.6/8.9/41/204 ms; and for R82A/G231C, 1/30/129 μs and 0.8/2.1/7.9/50 ms. These numbers confirm that in both mutants, G231C and R82A/G231C, the kinetics of the second half of the photocycle are somewhat slower than for wt (Fig. 6). The difference is smallest for the double mutant. The changed kinetics compared with wt may represent a different quasi-stationary equilibrium between M ↔ N/O → bR. The equilibrium between M, N, and O is pH-dependent (7.Otto H. Marti T. Holz M. Mogi T. Lindau M. Khorana H.G. Heyn M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9228-9232Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 35.Chizhov I. Chernavskii D.S. Engelhard M. Mueller K.-H. Zubov B.V. Hess B. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2329-2345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Therefore, the kinetics of the M-intermediate of wild type and R82A/G231C were measured in the pH range from 7 to 11. In Fig.7, A and B, the time traces of the M-intermediate are shown at the different pH values for wild type and R82A/G231C, respectively. Both samples contain the same concentration of bR as estimated from the absorbance at λmax = 568 nm in the light-adapted form at pH 6 (see Fig. 2). The total amplitude of the M-intermediates at pH 7 for a fixed flash intensity are different, 89 mOD for wild type and 70 mOD for R82A/G231C (amplitudes from a multiexponential fit; the apparent amplitudes in Fig. 7 are approximately 74 and 64 mOD, respectively). The overall conclusion, however, deduced from the multiexponential fits of the time traces shown in Fig. 7 is that the pH dependence of the M-decay kinetics in the double mutant and wild type is quite similar. The time constants of the fastest two components of the M-rise of R82A/G231C and wild type are identical in the observed pH range. Both the maximum amplitude and pK a of the slowest M-rise component of the double mutant, however, are different from wt. Fig.8, inset, shows the amplitudes in mOD of the slowest M-rise component as a function of pH. Normalizing to the highest amplitude at pH 7, the data are replotted in the main part of Fig. 8. This last component in the M-rise represents the remaining fraction of the protonated Schiff base after the K ↔ L ↔ M equilibrium is established (13.Richter H.-T. Brown L.S. Needleman R. Lanyi J.K.

The nucleosome core particle is composed of a central octamer of two molecules of each of the histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, surrounded by approximately two turns of DNA (1.van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1989Crossref Google Scholar). The core histones interact among themselves via their central globular domains, whereas the positively charged amino termini of these histones are accessible on the external surface of the nucleosome core particle (1.van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1989Crossref Google Scholar). Histone H1 binds outside the core particle to the linker DNA (20–60 base pairs), joining adjacent core particles to form the nucleosomal array. SLE autoantibodies can recognize a diverse array of epitopes located on the surface of the nucleosome. Some SLE antinuclear antibodies can recognize multimolecular determinants, whereas other antibodies are directed against individual components such as DNA or histones, reviewed in (2.Monestier M. Methods. 1997; 11: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Among antibodies to individual core histones, those reacting with histone H2B are a particularly frequent specificity (3.Hardin J.A. Thomas J.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Anti-H2B antibodies in SLE patients almost always recognize determinants that are located in the amino terminus (residues 1–25) of the histone molecule (9.Monestier M. Kotzin B.L. Rheum. Dis. Clin.

Novick K.E. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Positive hybridomas were cloned twice by limiting dilution, and isotypes were determined using anti-isotype reagents from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. mAbs were purified from culture supernatants by affinity chromatography on a recombinant protein G-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Three anti-H2B IgG mAbs were independently generated from three nonimmunized MRL/lpr mice. Some properties of two of these mAbs, LG2–2 (IgG2aκ) and LG11–2 (IgG2aκ), have been previously reported (6.Monestier M. Fasy T.M. Losman M.J. Novick K.E. Muller S. Mol.

Nucleosomes were prepared from calf thymus as described previously (15.Stemmer C. Richalet-Secordel P. van Bruggen M. Kramers K. Berden J. Muller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21257-21261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and purified on a 5–29% (w/v) sucrose gradient. The nucleosome preparations were characterized by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis, and the histone content was checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Thirteen synthetic peptides covering different segments within the region 1–25 of H2B were used in this work (TableI). They were synthesized using Fmoc chemistry as described previously (16.Neimark J. Briand J.P. Pept. Res. 1993; 6: 219-228PubMed Google Scholar). Calf thymus sequences were used for all syntheses. An additional cysteine residue was added to some peptides to allow their specific conjugation to carrier protein. In one series of analogues, the NH2 and COOH termini of the peptides were acetylated and carboxamidated, respectively. These blocked peptides were assembled using Fmoc chemistry on a Fmoc-2,4-dimethoxy-4′-(carboxymethyloxy)benzhydrylamine resin. Peptides were purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Perkin-Elmer preparative HPLC system on an aquapore ODS 20-μm column (100 × 10 mm) (17.Quesnel A. Briand J.P. J. Pept. Res. 1998; 52: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The elution was achieved by a linear gradient of aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (A) and 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in 80% acetonitrile, 20% water (B) at a flow rate of 6 ml/min with UV detection at 220 nm. The homogeneity of each peptide was assessed by analytical HPLC on a Beckman instrument with a nucleosil C18, 5-μm column (4.6 × 150 mm) using a linear gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and acetonitrile containing 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min. Peptide identity was established by mass spectrometry using a protein time-of-flight apparatus (Bruker Spectrospin, Wissembourg, France). Synthesis of control peptide 44–67 of the SmD1 protein was described previously (18.Barakat S. Briand J.P. Weber J.C. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Muller S. Clin. Exp.

The indirect ELISA procedure used to measure the binding of mAbs to nucleosome was as described previously (15.Stemmer C. Richalet-Secordel P. van Bruggen M. Kramers K. Berden J. Muller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21257-21261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) using microtiter plates (Falcon, Oxnard, CA; catalog number 3912) coated overnight with 50–400 ng/ml mononucleosomes in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH7.4. To study mAb binding to H2B synthetic peptides, ELISA plates were coated overnight at 37 °C with each peptide diluted in 0.05 m carbonate buffer, pH 9.6. In each assay, mAbs were also tested in a noncoated well incubated with coating buffer as a control. Saturation of plates was obtained by adding PBS containing 0.05% Tween (PBS-T) and 0.4% bovine serum albumin. The subsequent steps of the test were performed as described previously (12.Benkirane N. Guichard G. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Briand J.-P. Muller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11921-11926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) using mAbs diluted in PBS-T, 0.4% bovine serum albumin and rabbit anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase diluted 1:5000 in PBS-T. The final reaction was visualized by addition of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl benzidine in the presence of H2O2. Inhibition experiments were performed as described previously (12.Benkirane N. Guichard G.

Chem. 1995; 270: 11921-11926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) using peptide 1–25 H2B directly coated on the plastic at the appropriate concentration (0.1, 0.125, or 0.4 μm), and the mAbs were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and 1 h at 4 °C with the various competitor peptides (maximal peptide concentration tested in the fluid phase, 10 μm). The reaction was revealed as described above. IC50 values are defined as the amount (expressed in μm) of competitor peptide necessary to inhibit the maximal antibody binding by 50%. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from hybridoma cells using oligo(dT)-cellulose according to a previously described method (19.Badley J.E. Bishop G.A. St. John T. Frelinger J.A. Biotechniques. 1988; 6: 114-116PubMed Google Scholar). The variable region nucleotide sequences were determined by dideoxy sequencing as previously reported (20.Geliebter J. Focus. 1987; 9: 5-10Google Scholar, 21.Monestier M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 1725-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 22.Monestier M. Stemmer C. Ong G.L. Muller S. Mol. Immunol. 1997; 34: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The nucleic acid sequences were compared with immunoglobulin sequences in the GenBank™ data library (23.Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar). The variable region sequences were assigned to known gene families or germline genes by comparison with previously published sequences. All molecular modeling was performed on either a Silicon Graphics Personal IRIS 4D/25 or a Silicon Graphics Indigo2 workstation. Initial models were constructed using XABgen, a suite of programs for homology-based antibody model generation (24.Mandal C. Kingery B.D. Anchin J.M. Subramaniam S. Linthicum D.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25.Kingery B.D. Culberson C. Linthicum D.S. Biotechnol. Software J. 1996; 13: 20-27Google Scholar). A model of the antigen-binding site for each antibody, formed by the six complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops, was constructed using the heavy and light chain variable region sequences for each antibody. The output of the XABgen program, a model of the antigen-binding site in Protein Data Bank format, was used as the initial starting point for all further modeling. Refinement of all molecular models was performed using the DREIDING II force field and biograf software (BIOSYM/Molecular Simulations, Can Diego CA). The initial step in the refinement process involved minimizing the energy of the entire structure to convergence. After this, each structure was subjected to molecular dynamics calculations (200 ps), during which time only the atoms within the 6 CDR loops were permitted to move, while the motion of all the other atoms in the model was maintained constant. The energy of the entire structure was again minimized to convergence following the dynamics calculations. The next step in the process was to construct models of the antigenic peptides of interest, namely peptides 1–13 and 1–25 of H2B. Peptide models were generated in a manner similar to that used for generating a model of human immunodeficiency virus coat protein gp120 (26.Gabriel J.L. Mitchell W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4186-4190Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In general, a peptide was constructed using the peptide builder within the main biograf program, the energy of the resulting structure was minimized to convergence, and molecular dynamics calculations were performed on the entire peptide structure, again followed by energy minimization. The final step in our modeling procedure involved docking each peptide into the proposed binding site of the relevant antibody. Refinement of each antigen-antibody complex included the following. 1) The energy of the entire complex was minimized to convergence; 2) molecular dynamics calculations (100 ps) were performed, during which time only the atoms of the 6 CDR loops, and those of the peptide antigen were permitted to move, while the motion of all other atoms within the structure were maintained constant; 3) the energy of the entire complex was then again minimized. During the molecular dynamics calculations, the atomic positions of the peptide antigen and of the six CDR loops on each antibody were permitted to move. A comparison of the structure of the peptide antigen bound to its target before and after extensive molecular dynamics calculations resulted in an average root mean square difference of 5 Å. Thus, the peptide conformation within the antigen-antibody complex was significantly different from the original peptide structure indicating that the molecular dynamics procedure resulted in a sampling of the available peptide conformational space. In preliminary experiments (data not shown), we determined that the three mAbs described in this study (PR1–1, LG2–2, and LG11–2) specifically react with histone H2B but not with the other core histone molecules (H2A, H3, and H4) nor with DNA. Direct ELISA tests with overlapping peptides encompassing the whole H2B molecule indicated that all three mAbs recognized epitopes in the amino-terminal peptide 1–25 (data not shown). We therefore further characterized the reactivity of these mAbs against the histone H2B amino terminus. mAbs PR1–1 and LG2–2 strongly reacted with the amino-terminal peptide 1–13 but not with peptide 6–18. In contrast, mAb LG11–2 did not bind peptide 1–13 but strongly reacted with peptide 6–18 (TableII). We then tested the ability of various H2B amino-terminal peptides in solution to inhibit the interaction between the three mAbs and peptide 1–25 immobilized on the ELISA plate. As shown in Table III, the binding of PR1–1 mAb to peptide 1–25 was inhibited by peptides 1–25, 1–20, and 1–13 but not at all by peptides 1–6, 6–18, and 13–18, indicating thus that residues 1–13 are required for antibody recognition and that residues surrounding the serine residue at position 6 (Ser6) are important. Like PR1–1, LG2–2 binding was strongly inhibited by peptides 1–25, 1–20, and 1–13 but moderately by peptide 1–6 and not at all by peptides 6–18 and 13–18, indicating that residues 1–6 (with a few residues in the segment 7–13) constitute most of the epitope recognized by this mAb. Similar experiments were performed with LG11–2 (Table III). The binding of this antibody to peptide 1–25 was inhibited by peptides 1–25, 1–20, and 6–18 but not by peptides 1–13 and 13–18, therefore confirming that the central segment of the 1–25 peptide (residues 6–18) contains the major part of the LG11–2 epitope. No reaction was observed with any of these three antibodies against the unrelated control peptide 44–67 of SmD1 (Table III). The epitopes recognized by the anti-H2B mAbs in our study are present on “native” structures, since all three mAbs react with purified calf thymus mononucleosomes when tested by ELISA (Table IV). These determinants are also accessible in chromatin, since the mAbs reacted with HEp-2 nuclei by immunofluorescence staining (not shown).Table IIDirect ELISA reactivity of anti-H2B mAbs with histone H2B peptidesmAbPeptide 1–25Peptide 1–13Peptide 6–18PR1–12.801.700.10LG2–22.80>30.30LG11–2>30.15>3Microtiter plates were coated with 1 μm peptide and allowed to react with mAbs PR1–1 (1 μg/ml), LG2–2 (0.5 μg/ml), and LG11–2 (0.5 μg/ml).

Results are expressed as optical density values. The H2B amino terminus is characterized by the presence of several positively charged lysine residues that are probably important for interaction with DNA in the nucleosome. We have therefore evaluated the role of two of these residues, Lys5 and Lys11, by replacing them with alanine side chains in mutant 1–20 peptides. We also tested the importance of the first proline residue (Pro1) by similarly replacing it with an alanine. The results of the antibody inhibition binding assays to these modified peptides are listed in Table III. With respect to the two mAbs specific for peptide 1–13, the binding of PR1–1 is totally abolished when Pro1 is substituted with Ala1 and moderately affected when Lys11 is replaced with an alanine residue, whereas the Lys to Ala5 substitution has no effect on PR1–1 binding. As with PR1–1, LG2–2 reactivity is abolished by the Pro to Ala1 substitution and only moderately affected by the Lys to Ala11 replacement. In contrast with PR1–1, LG2–2 binding is only partially decreased by the Lys to Ala5 replacement. Previous results indicated that LG11–2 is specific for a determinant located between residues 6 and 18, and as expected, alanine substitution at position 1 (Pro1 to Ala1) does not affect binding. The Lys to Ala5substitution reduces LG11–2 binding only slightly, whereas reactivity is totally abolished by the Lys to Ala11 substitution. We further characterized the reactivity of LG11–2 mAb (which reacts with residues located within the segment 6–18 of histone H2B) using various analogues of the parent peptide 6–18 (Table I). These peptide analogues were acetylated at their NH2 termini and carboxamidated at their COOH termini, and three of them (named R1, R2, and R3) also included sequence alterations from the original 6–18 sequence. Blocked peptides can assume a three-dimensional conformation different from conventional peptides that may result in alteration of antibody recognition (27.Briand J.-P. Guichard G. Dumortier H. Muller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20686-20691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 28.Briand J.P. Benkirane N. Guichard G. Newman J.F. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Brown F. Muller S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12545-12550Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The results of these binding studies are shown in Table V. As expected from the results described earlier in this paper, neither PR1–1 nor LG11–2 reacted with any of the 6–18 analogs, since both antibodies require residues 1–6 for binding. In contrast, LG11–2, which reacts with peptide 6–18, also recognized the blocked 6–18 peptide (Table V). However, LG11–2 did not bind to any of the analogue peptides, R1, R2, or R3 (Table V). Of these three analogues, R1 is the closest to the original sequence since the only differences between R1 and 6–18 occur at the NH2 and COOH extremities, whereas the core sequence APKKGSKKA (residues 9–17) is identical in both peptides (Table I). The lack of binding of LG11–2 to this analogue suggests that the terminal residues of the 6–18 peptide may be involved in direct contact with the LG11–2 binding site or that some of these residues (e.g. Pro8, which was replaced in R1 by an acetylated alanine) play a critical role in the overall conformation of the epitope.Table VmAb binding to various blocked H2B peptidesmAb6–18 (C)6–18 (C) blockedR1 (C) blockedR2 (C) blockedR3 (C) blockedPR1–10.030.050.090.080.06LG2–20.070.020.090.060.06LG11–22.291.300.110.070.07Microtiter plates were coated with 1 μm peptide and allowed to react with mAbs PR1–1 (1 μg/ml), LG2–2 (0.5 μg/ml), and LG11–2 (0.5 μg/ml).

Results are expressed as optical density values. We then examined the heavy and light chain variable (V) region sequences of the three anti-H2B mAbs. The sequences of these V regions are available from GenBank™/EMBL under accession numbers X67621,X67624, AF143907, AF143908, AF143909, and AF143910. To our knowledge, these are the only anti-H2B antibody variable region sequences to have been reported. The V, D, and J gene segment usage of our mAbs is summarized in Table VI, and the amino acid sequences of the CDRs are listed in TableVII. The variable regions of these mAbs are encoded by different D, JH, Vκ, and Jκ gene segments, and although the J558 VH gene family is used by all three mAbs, they utilize three different germline VHgenes. Therefore, even though all three mAbs recognize determinants located in the amino terminus of histone H2B, they use different genetic elements to create their combining sites. To help us understand the interactions between these three mAbs and the H2B amino terminus, we modeled the structures of the three antibody-antigen complexes. Despite the uncertainties associated with these computational procedures, the predicted structures are a valuable aid, as they can provide a possible explanation for the binding interactions that have been experimentally determined. The structural elements used to generate the anti-H2B variable region models are listed in Table VIII, and the results of these modeling studies are depicted in Fig. 1.Table VIV gene and gene segment use in anti-H2B monoclonal antibodiesmAbIsotypeVH familyD geneJHgeneVκ subgroupJκ genePR1–1IgG2bκJ558Q52-C219/285LG2–2IgG2aκJ558SP2–9214LG11–2IgG2aκJ558421All three mAbs were obtained from independent fusions from three different MRL/lpr mice.

The D segment of mAb LG11–2 is only 6 nucleotides long and too short for its germline gene to be identified. The PR1–1 D segment is coded by the Q52 gene that has rearranged in inverted orientation. In the following descriptions of these interactions, the variable region residues are numbered on the line with the residue abbreviations according to the Kabat nomenclature (29.Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Foeller C. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. U. S. Government Printing Office, Bethesda, MD1991Google Scholar), and the H2B peptide residues are numbered in superscript characters (see Table I for the H2B sequence). Both PR1–1 and LG2–2 react with the peptide 1–13 of H2B. For PR1–1 (Fig. 1, A and B), the heavy chain interactions involve Tyr-27 (located just outside of CDR1) with Pro3, CDR2 Asp-52 with Lys11 and Lys12, and CDR2 Glu-56 with Lys11. Only one residue in the heavy chain CDR3 is involved, namely Asp-101 with Pro1. The light chain CDR1 is not implicated, whereas several CDR2 residues are involved, Tyr-49 with Lys5, Trp-50 with Pro8 and Pro10, Phe-55 with Pro1, and Thr-56 with Glu2. From the light chain CDR3, only Tyr-91 interacts with Ser6. For LG2–2 (Fig. 1, C and D), the heavy chain CDR1 residues Tyr-32 and Tyr-35 interact with Pro1 and Glu2, respectively. From the heavy chain CDR2, Tyr-50 interacts with Ser6, Lys-58 with Pro3 and Ser6, Glu-61 with Lys11, and Lys-62 with Pro10 and Lys11. Only one interaction was modeled with the heavy chain CDR3, Tyr-100 with Pro1 and Glu2. For the LG2–2 light chain, there was one CDR1 interaction, Gln-27 with Lys12, and no CDR2 interaction. In contrast, there were several interactions with light chain CDR3 residues, His-93 with Gly13, Val-94 with Lys12and Gly13, and Tyr-96 with Glu2, Lys5, and Ser6. For LG11–2, which reacts and was modeled with the peptide 1–25 of H2B, the main interactions of the heavy chain CDRs were with lysine residues at the center of the peptide, with Thr-28 and Thr-30 from CDR1 interacting with Lys16, Asp-31 from CDR1 interacting with Lys11, Lys16, and Lys20, whereas Asp-52 from the CDR2 interacts with Lys11 (Fig. 1,E and F). The light chain CDRs interact with determinants located at both peptide termini. Asp-55 and Tyr-49 from CDR2 interact with Pro1, whereas Tyr-32 from CDR1 interacts with Lys5. At the carboxyl terminus, interactions involve charged residues. From the light chain CDR1, Asp-27 interacts with Lys24, Asp-28 with Lys24 and Asp25, Lys-30 with Asp25, whereas Lys-53 from the CDR2 also interacts with Asp25. In our model, neither the heavy nor the light chain CDR3 plays any significant role in peptide binding. Despite the limitations and uncertainties inherent to the modeling process, these studies are in agreement with the results obtained by ELISA, indicating that Pro1 is required for the binding of both LG2–2 and PR1–1 and that Lys11 is important for the optimal binding of all three antibodies. Interestingly, the replacement of Lys5 with an alanine residue had moderate or no effect on antibody reactivity. This is also in good agreement with the model that indicates that this residue is only involved in distant hydrogen bonds, and this also suggests that the Lys to Ala5replacement does not dramatically affect the overall structure of the 1–20 H2B peptide recognized by the set of antibodies studied. A remarkable and unexpected feature of these modeling studies is that they suggest that the heavy chain CDR3s play only a limited role in direct binding to the histone H2B peptide (although these CDR3s can still play an important role by contributing to the overall V region structure). The heavy chain CDR3 is extremely diverse, since it results from the rearrangement of three different gene segments (VH, D, and JH) and from the extensive joining flexibility that takes place during this rearrangement process. The heavy chain CDR3 is centrally located within the antibody-combining site and is critical for antigen binding. For instance, in anti-chromatin autoantibodies directed against DNA or DNA-histone complexes, the heavy chain CDR3 often contains multiple cationic residues (usually arginine) that are critical for contact with the negatively charged DNA (reviewed in Refs. 2.Monestier M. Methods. 1997; 11: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar and 30.Radic M.Z. Weigert M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 487-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). For two of our mAbs (LG11–2 and PR1–1), the limited role of heavy chain CDR3 can be in part attributed to the very short lengths of their heavy chain CDR3s (4 residues). In contrast to these two mAbs, a survey of mouse heavy chain CDR3 sequences indicated that their average length is 8.7 (31.Wu T.T. Johnson G. Kabat E.A. Proteins. 1993; 16: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Our results are reminiscent of studies conducted with several anti-lysozyme antibodies that contained heavy chain CDR3s of various lengths (32.Amit A.G. Mariuzza R.A. Phillips S.E. Poljak R.J. Science. 1986; 233: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar, 33.Padlan E.A. Silverton E.W. Sheriff S. Cohen G.H. Smith-Gill S.J. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5938-5942Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 34.Sheriff S. Silverton E.W. Padlan E.A. Cohen G.H. Smith-Gill S.J. Finzel B.C. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8075-8079Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 35.Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1709-1719PubMed Google Scholar). These observations indicated that the involvement of the heavy chain CDR3 in lysozyme binding is proportional to its length. In contrast, as the heavy chain CDR3 shortens, the heavy chain CDR1 and CDR2 become gradually more involved and interact with a greater number of residues on the lysozyme molecule. Our analysis therefore supports the view that the length of the heavy chain CDR3 can dramatically influence the importance of the interactions of the other regions of the combining site. The results obtained in this study are important for our understanding of autoimmune phenomena. They support previous studies indicating that the autoantibodies to histone H2B are mostly directed against a unique segment of the molecule, namely the amino terminus domain. Our data also confirm that, despite its limited size, the H2B amino terminus includes several overlapping self-epitopes. There is a general consensus that self-reactive B cells in SLE are directly stimulated by nuclear antigens (2.Monestier M. Methods. 1997; 11: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 30.Radic M.Z. Weigert M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 487-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) and there is also increasing evidence that these self-antigens can be presented to the immune system as a result of the apoptotic process (36.Casciola-Rosen L.A. Anhalt G. Rosen A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1317-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). Therefore, these results suggest that the histone H2B amino-terminal domain is particularly exposed and immunogenic in chromatin that has been fragmented and adulterated following apoptotic cell death. Our study also helps us to understand the interactions that take place among the various CDR residues in the antibody variable regions and the sequential H2B epitope(s). The immune response to a linear determinant of histone H2B is particularly unique since other autoantibody responses in SLE often involve complex, multimolecular epitopes (37.Burlingame R.W. Rubin R.L. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1996; 23: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Future site-directed mutagenesis studies of the anti-H2B autoantibodies CDRs will allow us to elucidate the molecular basis of these interactions. We are grateful to Drs. Marko Radic and Frederic Brard for their insightful comments about the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2057525716,"Plasmids of the pT181 family encode initiator proteins that act as dimers during plasmid rolling circle (RC) replication. These initiator proteins bind to the origin of replication through a sequence-specific interaction and generate a nick at the origin that acts as the primer for RC replication. Previous studies have demonstrated that the initiator proteins contain separate DNA binding and nicking-closing domains, both of which are required for plasmid replication. The tyrosine residue at position 191 of the initiator RepC protein of pT181 is known to be involved in nicking at the origin. We have generated heterodimers of RepC that consist of different combinations of wild type, DNA binding, and nicking mutant monomers to identify the role of each of the two monomers in RC replication. One monomer with DNA binding activity was sufficient for the targeting of the initiator to the origin, and the presence of Tyr-191 in one monomer was sufficient for the initiation of replication. On the other hand, a dimer consisting of one monomer defective in DNA binding and the other defective in origin nicking failed to initiate replication. Our results demonstrate that the monomer that promotes sequence-specific binding to the origin must also nick the DNA to initiate replication. Interestingly, whereas Tyr-191 of the initiator was required for nicking at the origin to initiate replication, it was dispensable for termination, suggesting that alternate amino acids in the initiator may promote termination but not initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2141130029,"As an approach to targeted repression of genes of interest, we describe the development of human estrogen receptor (ER) α-KRAB repressor domain chimeras that are potent ligand-dependent repressors of the transcription of estrogen response element (ERE)-containing promoters and analyze their mechanisms of action. Repression by the KRAB domain was dominant over transactivation mediated by ER AF1 and AF2. An ERE and an ER ligand (estrogen or antiestrogen) were required for repression. Studies with several promoters and cell lines demonstrated that the presence of EREs, rather than the capacity for estrogen induction, determines the potential for repression of a gene by the KRAB-ERα-KRAB (KERK) chimera. A single consensus ERE was sufficient for repression, but the KERK chimera was unable to suppress transcription from the imperfect ERE in the native pS2 promoter. We recently reported mutations that enhance binding of a steroid receptor DNA-binding domain to the ERE. Introducing these mutations into wild-type ER enhanced transactivation from the pS2 ERE. Insertion of these mutations into KERK created the novel repressor KERK-3M, which is a potent repressor of both ER-induced and basal transcription on a promoter containing the pS2 ERE. These modified ER-KRAB chimeras should prove useful as new tools for the functional analysis and repression of ER-regulated genes."

Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3400-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). The chemically unstable prostaglandin H2 is quickly converted into various prostanoids by specific enzymes. The abundance and the nature of generated prostanoids depend on tissue and cell types (e.g.prostacyclin and thromboxane A2 are the principal products generated from prostaglandin H2 in endothelial cells and platelets, respectively) (2.Hamberg M. Svensson J. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2994-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (2819) Google Scholar, 3.Weksler B.B. Marcus A.J. Jaffe E.A. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 74: 3922-3926Crossref Scopus (486) Google Scholar). PGHS exists as two protein isoforms, PGHS-1 (or Cox-1) and PGHS-2 (or Cox-2), which are produced by two distinct genes. The gene for PGHS-1 is localized on chromosome 9, whereas that for PGHS-2 is on chromosome 1 (4.Kraemer S.A. Meade S.A. Dewitt D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 293: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). PGHS-1, constitutively expressed, produces prostaglandins and thromboxane A2 during physiologic activities such as homeostasis and gastroprotection. PGHS-2 is an inducible enzyme considered to be involved in the overproduction of prostanoids during inflammatory disorders (5.Inoue H. Tanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Rec. Commun. 1998; 244: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 6.Pouliot M. Gilbert C. Borgeat P. Poubelle P.E. Bourgoin S. Créminon C. Maclouf J. McColl S. Naccache P.H.

The expression of enzymatic activities at the membrane surface may be an important way for cells to communicate and interact with their environment. Protein phosphorylation is critical to the regulation of cellular functions (7.Haslam R.J. Lynham J.A. Fox J.E.B. Biochem. J. 1979; 178: 397-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 8.Imaoka T.

It is well known that intracellular PKA is important in the regulation of function of various cells (11.Booyse F.M. Marr J. Yang D.C. Guiliani D. Rfelson M.E. Biochim. Biophys.

Reynolds C.C. Johnson M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12627-12631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but little is known on ecto-PKA activity present at the plasma membrane. In a previous study, we have demonstrated (14.Hatmi M. Gavaret J.M. Elalamy I. Vargaftig B.B. Jacquemin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24776-24780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) the presence of an ecto-PKA activity at the surface of intact human platelets, and we have revealed its principal endogenous target as being CD36, a membrane glycoprotein interacting with adhesion molecules such as collagen and thrombospondin. The rate-limiting step for this ecto-phosphorylation activity depends on ATP and especially on cAMP. These nucleotides are intracellular constituents that may be released from platelets under well described conditions (15.Gordon J.L. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar) and may directly act on the surrounding endothelial cells. PGHS-2, which is involved in prostanoid synthesis in the course of inflammatory reactions, is regulated at the transcription level. It may be expressed by many nucleate cells upon challenge with PMA, LPS or inflammatory cytokines (16.Perkins D.J. Kniss D.A. Prostaglandins. 1997; 54: 727-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Finally, the increase of intracellular cAMP rate enhances PGHS-2 expression in various cell types (17.Nüsing R.M.

The objective of this study was to determine whether PMA-induced PGHS-2 expression in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs) is regulated by extracellular cAMP, through an ecto-PKA signaling pathway. We clearly demonstrate here that extracellular cAMP is able to reduce PGHS-2 expression in adherent HPMECs at the levels of mRNA, protein, and enzyme activity through an ecto-PKA signaling pathway. In addition, our findings outline the role of inducible endothelial PGHS-2 in the potential limitation of platelet activation during inflammatory processes. Reagents and materials were from the following sources: prostacyclin, cAMP, the stable prostaglandin (PG) H2 analogue U46619, PGE2, forskolin, arachidonic acid, ATP, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), kemptide (Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly), natural protein kinase inhibitor peptide PKI (Thr-Thr-Tyr-Ala-Asp-Phe-Ile-Ala-Ser-Gly-Arg-Thr-Gly-Arg-Arg-Asn-Ala-Ile-His-Asp), and anti-β actin antibody were purchased from Sigma. 6-keto-PGF1α kit, cAMP kit, anti-PGHS-1, and anti-PGHS-2 antibodies were from SPI-BIO (Massy, France). GF 109203X, a selective inhibitor of protein kinase C, was a kind gift from Dr. J. Kirilovsky (Glaxo, France). Nitrocellulose membranes (BA83) were from Schleicher & Schuell. [γ-32P]ATP and peroxidase-linked sheep anti-mouse IgG, ECL Western blotting detection system, biotinylated streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase complex, and biotinylated anti-mouse IgG antibody were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Reverse transcriptase and Taq polymerase were from Promega (Charbonnière, France) and Eurobio (Les Ulis, France), respectively. Oligodeoxynucleotides were from Genset (Paris, France). Monoclonal mouse IgG1 antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-goat polyclonal anti-mouse were from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark). The selective PGHS-2 inhibitor NS-398 was from Biomol (USA). Endothelial cell growth medium-microvascular medium, and microbeads coated with streptavidin and biotinylated specific endothelial lectin (Ulex Europaeus UEA I) were from TEBU (Le Perry-en Yvelines, France). Healthy distal human pulmonary fragments were from the Service de Chirurgie Cardiothoracique (Prof. J. P. Couetil, Hôpital Broussais, Paris, France) and taken after obtaining voluntary consent from patients. The lingula lung fragments were immersed in sterile minimum Eagle's medium. Cell isolation and culture techniques were derived from the method of Chenet al. (21.Chen S.F. Fei X. Li S.H. Microvasc. Res. 1995; 50: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, the tissue was carefully dissected and was minced thoroughly in a potter. Then, preparation was centrifuged at 4 °C and 500 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was resuspended in endothelial cell growth medium-microvascular medium, a selective medium for microvascular endothelial cells. HPMECs were cultured on dishes coated with 0.5% gelatin. The microvascular endothelial cells were identified according to morphological criteria (characteristic cobblestone morphology). They were purified from the primary culture by an immunomagnetic selection using the VarioMacs system (Myltenii) and microbeads coated with streptavidin and a biotinylated specific endothelial lectin, Ulex Europaeus UEA I. The cells were grown on gelatinized dishes in endothelial cell growth medium-microvascular medium. The endothelial nature of the cells was confirmed by detection of adhesive molecules, such as von Willebrand factor and VCAM-1 or ICAM-1. Blood obtained from healthy human volunteers who had not received any medication for at least 10 days was anticoagulated with one-sixth of its final volume by a mixture of citric acid, citrate, and dextrose (7, 93, and 139 mm, respectively, pH 6.4) containing heparin (20 IU/ml). Washed platelets were prepared according to Mustard et al. (22.Mustard J.F. Perry D.W. Ardli N.G. Packham M.A. Br. J. Haematol. 1972; 22: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), in which apyrase was omitted, and prostacyclin (10 nm) was added for the first two steps of washing procedure. Platelets were resuspended in Tyrode's buffer, and their number was adjusted to 5 × 108 cells/ml. Briefly, after different treatments, adherent HPMECs were washed and exposed to arachidonic acid (30 μm) for 10 min. Thereafter, aliquots of incubation media were stored at −20 °C for further 6-keto-PGF1α measurements. Amounts of 6-keto-PGF1α, a stable nonenzymatic hydrolysis product of prostacyclin, were monitored by a specific kit according to method of Pradelles et al. (23.Pradelles P. Grassi J. Maclouf J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). PGHS-2 activity was also evaluated by a bioactive functional method based on the ability of HPMEC transferable activity to inhibit platelet aggregation. Thus, media from arachidonic acid-activated endothelial cells were added to platelet suspensions (5.108platelets/ml) pretreated with aspirin (50 μm). Platelet aggregation was then triggered by the stable prostaglandin H2 analogue, U46619 (0.3 μm), and aggregating responses were followed for 8 min after the addition of the stimulating agent. Suspensions of HPMECs (400 μl, 107/ml) were exposed to PMA in the presence and in the absence of forskolin (50 μm) or PGE2 (50 μm) for 10 min, and then, 800 μl of ethanol were added. cAMP contained in each sample was determined by specific kit according to enzyme immunoassay method of Pradelles et al.(24.Pradelles P. Grassi J. Chabardes D. Guiso N. Anal. Chem. 1989; 61: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The adherent HPMECs were fixed with 3.7% formol and permeabilized with 80% acetone for 5 min. Then, they were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in a humid chamber for 1 h with a specific PGHS-2 antibody (10 μg/ml) or its corresponding isotype (10 μg/ml). After washing, samples were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-anti-mouse IgG antibody (20 μg/ml) for 1 h in a humid chamber at room temperature. The sections were examined using a Nikon Optiphot-2 microscope equipped with fluorescence and Nomarski optics, and photographs were taken with Ilford HP5, 400 ASA film using identical exposure times. Total cellular mRNA was prepared according to Chomczynski and Sacchi (25.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). RT-PCR techniques were used to generate human HPMEC PGHS-2 and β-actin PCR products of 305 and 263 base pairs, respectively. RT was performed with hexamers and superscript RT as described by the manufacturer. PCR amplifications for PGHS-2 were done using 35 cycles (94 °C for 45 s, 63 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 45 s) in 100 μl of buffer containing 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTPs, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 50 mm KCl, and 2 units of of Taq polymerase with the following primers: 5′-TTCAAATGA GATTGTGGGAAAATTGCT-3′ and 5′-AGATCATCTCTGCCTGAGTATCTTT-3′. PCR products were subjected to agarose gel (1.5%) electrophoresis and transferred onto nylon membranes. Blots were hybridized in 5× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 7% SDS, and 10× Denhart's reagent overnight at 49 °C, with a specific PGHS-2 γ-32P-labeled oligodeoxynucleotide (5′-AGACAGATCATAAGCGAGG-3′) that was previously prepared using T4 polynucleotide kinase reaction. The membranes were washed first with 0.1% SDS and 2× SSC at 49 °C for 20 min and then with 1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 49 °C for 20 min. Finally, filters were exposed to a PhosphorImager and quantified by ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnywale, CA). Protein kinase activity on kemptide was assayed in culture dishes containing HPMECs (107 cells) supplemented with [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi/sample), unlabeled ATP (5 μm), cAMP (5 μm), and paranitrophenyl phosphate (10 mm). Reactions were initiated by addition of kemptide (5 μm) and were continued for 10–15 min. In order to stop the reaction, 20 μl of each sample were placed in plastic tubes containing 10 μl of glacial acetic acid. Aliquots of 20 μl of the reaction mixture were deposited on Whatman P-81 phosphocellulose filter papers according to Glass et al. (26.Glass D.B. Masaracchia R.A. Feramisco J.R. Kemp B.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 566-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). After 30 s, the filter papers were introduced in 30% acetic acid containing 2 mm ATP for at least 60 min. The filter papers were washed three times for 15 min in acetic acid 15% and then introduced in ether/ethanol (v/v) and, finally, in ether and dried. Phosphorylation was evaluated by the determination of the radioactivity in each aliquot (filter paper) using a β-counter. Immunoblot analysis was performed according to Laemmli (27.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar). Briefly, after gel separation, cell proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes by semidry transfer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol). Membranes were blocked overnight with 5% nonfat dry milk in the following buffer (Tris 20 mm, pH 7.6, NaCl 140 mm, and 0.1% Tween 20). Blots were probed for 1 h with monoclonal antibodies anti-PGHS-1, anti-PGHS-2, or anti-β-actin (diluted to 1/1000). The primary antibodies were removed and immunoreactive bands were visualized using a peroxidase mouse immunoglobulin antibody (diluted to 1/10.000) followed by ECL reagent. Statistical significance between treated and control samples was determined using Student'st test for unpaired data. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. of three to five separate experiments. As expected, PMA strongly increased PGHS-2 expression in HPMECs with an optimum at 10 nm. In contrast, no significant variation was observed under the same conditions for the PGHS-1 isoform (Fig.1 A). This induction of PGHS-2 expression was abrogated by GF 109203X, a specific protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor (28.Sipma H. van der Zee L. van den Akker J. den Hertog A. Nelemans A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 730-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), whereas the PGHS-1 protein level remained unmodified. A time course study showed that the induction of PGHS-2 protein, unlike β-actin, increased during the cell incubation with PMA (10 nm) and reached a maximum at 24 h (Fig.1 B). As shown in Fig. 1 C, the elevation of intracellular cAMP levels evoked by PGE2 (50 μm) or forskolin (50 μm) increased PMA-induced PGHS-2 protein in HPMECs, under conditions where β-actin expression was not modified. In fact, the estimated relative amounts of PGHS-2 protein obtained from the quantitation of Western blot signals (PGHS-2/β-actin) were 1085 ± 46, 1307 ± 76, and 1255 ± 102 for PMA (10 nm) alone or in combination with forskolin (50 μm) or PGE2 (50 μm), respectively. A statistical significant increase (p < 0.05,n = 3) was noted when forskolin was used. Under the same conditions, the cAMP amounts generated 10 min after the PMA addition were 271 ± 27 pmol/107cells for forskolin plus PMA, 138 ± 48 pmol/107cells for PGE2 plus PMA, and 69 ± 11 pmol/107cells for control PMA-treated cells (n = 3). To investigate the possible modulating role of extracellular cAMP on the induction of PGHS-2 expression, cultured HPMECs were incubated with PMA (10 nm) alone or in combination with cAMP (5 μm) and ATP (5 μm). As shown, immunoblotting analysis (Fig.2 A) revealed that extracellular cAMP, which had no effect by itself, significantly inhibited PGHS-2 expression induced by PMA. Indeed, estimated relative values of PGHS-2 protein obtained from the quantitation of Western blot signals (PGHS-2/β-actin) were 529 ± 20 versus823 ± 8 for control PMA-treated cells (p < 0.01,n = 3). In related experiments, using immunofluorescence technique and an anti-PGHS-2 monoclonal antibody, we observed that PMA (10 nm) caused fluorescence staining of the adherent HPMECs. No significant staining was observed for quiescent cells (control). In accordance with immunoblotting results, cAMP added in combination with ATP, a substrate of phosphorylation, had no significant effect on the basal staining but greatly decreased the staining intensity caused by PMA (Fig. 2 B). PGHS activity was evaluated through the generation of 6-keto-PGF1α, a stable nonenzymatic hydrolysis product of prostacyclin. As established for other endothelial cell types, PMA enhances PGHS-2 activity. In the PMA-treated cells, the 6-keto-PGF1α generated following arachidonic acid addition was increased by about 7-fold as compared with that of untreated control cells. However, the addition of increasing concentrations of cAMP into the extracellular medium decreased progressively and significantly the 6-keto-PGF1α production (Fig.3 A). PKI, a specific PKA inhibitor (29.Cheng H-C. Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Smith A.J. Misconi L. Van Patten S.M. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 989-992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) prevented in the concentration-dependent manner this effect with an apparent calculated K i of 12 nm (Fig. 3 B). In another set of experiments using a functional assay, we evaluated PGHS activity through the ability of generated prostanoids, particularly prostacyclin, to inhibit platelet aggregation. As shown in Fig. 4, exposure of aspirinized platelets to media (50 μl) from PMA-treated HPMECs incubated with arachidonic acid (30 μm) inhibited aggregation triggered by thromboxane A2 mimetic, U46619 (0.3 μm). When HPMECs were treated with PMA in association with cAMP plus ATP, the inhibition of platelet aggregation by the culture medium did not occur. This effect due to the extracellular cAMP plus ATP on the PMA-induced HPMEC response was also prevented by PKI. Finally, NS-398 (30 μm), a specific potent inhibitor of PGHS-2 (30.Masferrer J.L. Zweifel B.S. Manning P.T. Hauser S.D. Leahy K.M. Smith W.G. Isakson P.C. Seibert K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3228-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar), abolished the generation of the inhibitory transferable activity induced by PMA. To assess whether extracellular cAMP also modulates PGHS-2 mRNA, we performed RT-PCR on total RNA prepared from HPMECs treated for 3–24 h under various conditions. Blots of PCR products hybridized with a PGHS-2-specific γ-32P-labeled oligodeoxynucleotide probe revealed products of 305 base pairs in HPMECs. As expected, treatment of the cells by PMA, increased PGHS-2 mRNA levels under conditions where only small amounts were detected in untreated control cells. PMA-induced PGHS-2 mRNA, which is increased in a time-dependent manner, reached a maximum at 6 h and then back to its basal level at 24 h (data not shown). The effect of PMA on the mRNA PGHS-2 expression was attenuated by extracellular cAMP. The spot quantification by ImageQuant of radioactive intensity, corresponding to relative PGHS-2 compared with β-actin, clearly established this effect (Fig.5). To investigate the existence of endothelial ecto-PKA activity by which cAMP may decrease PMA-induced PGHS-2 expression, kemptide, a specific PKA substrate (31.Kübler D. Pyerin W. Bill O. Hotz A. Sonka J. Kinzel V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14549-14555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was added to the extracellular medium. Thus, the incubation of kemptide (5 μm) with intact HPMECs in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi), ATP (5 μm) and cAMP (5 μm) resulted in an important incorporation of the radioactivity into this exogenous substrate. However, no significant increase of the kemptide phosphorylation occurred when exogenous cAMP was omitted or when specific PKA inhibitor peptide PKI was added to the extracellular medium (Fig. 6). Levels of PGHS-2 RNA messenger and polypeptide are undetectable in most tissues under physiological conditions, but they can be induced rapidly in a wide variety of cells in response to inflammatory stimuli (32.Mahboubi K. Young W. Ferreri N.R. Cytokine. 1998; 10: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 33.Crofford L.J. Tan B. McCarthy C.J. Hla T.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1776-1782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast, PGHS-1, which is expressed at relatively high levels in quiescent cells, remains essentially constant, even after exposure to mitogens (35.Habib A. Creminon C. Frobert Y. Grassi J. Pradelles P. Maclouf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23448-23454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Kujubu D.A. Fletcher B.S. Varnum B.C. Lim R.W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12866-12872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the expression of PGHS-2 was investigated at the mRNA, protein and enzyme activity levels. In accordance with the work of Vezza et al. (37.Vezza R. Habib A. Li H. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30028-30033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), increase of PGHS-2 expression was observed in response to the tumor promotor PMA in a concentration- and a time-dependent manner. However, PGHS-1 expression remained unchanged or increased only slightly in response to PMA. As expected, PMA-induced PGHS-2 expression in HPMECs was strictly dependent on PKC pathway, because GF 109203X, a selective PKC inhibitor (26.Glass D.B. Masaracchia R.A. Feramisco J.R. Kemp B.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 566-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), abrogated this response. It is important to outline that PMA-induced PGHS-2 mRNA, which peacked at 6 h, decreased during incubation. This effect can be attributed to mRNA instability because the 3′ untranslated region of PGHS-2 mRNA possesses repetitive AUUUA motifs, known for their ability to enhance mRNA degradation (38.O'Banion M.K. Winn V.D. Young D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4888-4892Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 39.Sirois J. Levy L. Simmons D.L. Richards J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12199-12206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Different studies reported that the increase of intracellular cAMP level enhanced PGHS-2 expression in various cell types (17.Nüsing R.M. Klein T. Pfeilschifter J. Ullrich V. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18.Minghetti L. Polazzi E. Nicolini A. Creminon C. Levi G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 934-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 19.Anteby E.Y. Johnson R.D. Huang X. Nelson D.M. Sadovsky Y. J. Clin. Endoc.

Chem. 1997; 272: 31065-31072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In agreement with these findings, we established that forskolin, which enhances intracellular cAMP level by stimulating adenylyl cyclase, significantly increases PGHS-2 expression in HPMECs. In contrast to findings reported for other cell types (17.Nüsing R.M. Klein T. Pfeilschifter J. Ullrich V. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18.Minghetti L.

Metab. 1997; 82: 2289-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 20.Fournier T. Fadok V. Henson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31065-31072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), the limited PGHS-2 protein increase, triggered by PGE2 or forskolin exposition, could be correlated to the lower amount of cAMP formed in HPMECs in response to either of these adenylyl cyclase activators. Indeed, in a comparative study, we have measured cAMP levels in both HPMECs and human blood platelets under adenylyl cyclase activation and/or cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase inhibition. In all cases, HPMECs generated only small amounts of cAMP compared with those produced by human blood platelets (data not shown). In contrast, using a murine macrophage cell line, Pang and Hoult (40.Pang L. Hoult J.R.S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) reported that adenylyl cyclase activators, such as PGE2, PGI2, and forskolin, suppressed the induction of PGHS-2 expression by endotoxin, suggesting that the cAMP effect was dependent from cell type. The effect of intracellular cAMP may be mediated by the cAMP response element, described at the promoter of human PGHS-2 gene (41.Kosaka T. Miyata A. Ihara H. Hara S. Sugimoto T. Takeda O. Takahashi E. Tanabe T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 42.Inoue H. Yokoyama C. Hara S. Tone Y. Tanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24965-24971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The main objective of this study was to determine whether extracellular cAMP, like intracellular cAMP, could up-regulate PGHS-2 expression. Surprisingly, cAMP added to extracellular medium induced a down-regulation of PGHS-2 expression in HPMECs at both mRNA and protein levels. Accordingly, the decrease by extracellular cAMP of PMA-induced PGHS-2 expression was abolished by PKI, a PKA-specific inhibitor (29.Cheng H-C. Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Smith A.J. Misconi L. Van Patten S.M. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 989-992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This result indicates that a consequent activation of an ecto-PKA is required for the molecular event leading to the decrease of PGHS-2 induction. Indeed, using intact cells, labeled ATP ([γ-32P]ATP), and exogenous peptide kemptide (a nonpermeant specific substrate for PKA (31.Kübler D. Pyerin W. Bill O. Hotz A. Sonka J. Kinzel V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14549-14555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), we clearly demonstrated the presence of a PKA activity at the outer surface of HPMEC membranes. In addition, the inability of PKI to cross plasmic membrane (29.Cheng H-C. Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Smith A.J. Misconi L. Van Patten S.M. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 989-992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) supports the outer surface location of the observed PKA. Moreover, this property precludes an intracellular effect of exogenous cAMP on PMA-induced PGHS-2 expression. This extracellular cAMP effect on PMA-induced PGHS-2 expression observed at the mRNA and protein levels was also noted for the enzymatic activity. Thus, NS-398, a selective inhibitor (30.Masferrer J.L. Zweifel B.S. Manning P.T. Hauser S.D. Leahy K.M. Smith W.G. Isakson P.C. Seibert K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3228-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar), abolished PMA-induced PGHS-2 activity in terms of both 6-keto-PGF1α formation and a released inhibitory activity on platelet aggregation (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the measured PGHS activity under PMA treatment is essentially attributable to PGHS-2 isoform. Moreover, they are consistent with the recent work of Brock et al.(43.Brock T.G. McNish R.W. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11660-11666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), demonstrating that PGHS-2 preferentially metabolizes arachidonic acid into PGE2 and prostacyclin, two adenylyl cyclase activators. Furthermore, the present study reports, for the first time, opposing effects of cAMP on the PGHS-2 expression. Indeed, following its availability, cAMP exerts an up-regulation when it is increased at the intracellular level and a down-regulation when it is present in the extracellular medium. These opposing effects of cAMP suggest different cellular signaling mechanisms. As a consequence, it is tempting to speculate that extracellular cAMP, which may be released under activation of blood platelets, for example, may reduce (through an ecto-PKA) PGHS-2 expression in HPMECs and thus attenuate an exacerbated inflammation. Taken together, results obtained here by immunoblotting, RT-PCR, and enzyme activity are in agreement and show that extracellular cAMP decreases PGHS-2 expression in HPMECs, through an ecto-PKA signaling pathway. Besides, they outline the potential role of the inducible endothelial PGHS-2 in the limitation of platelet activation during inflammatory process. At this stage, further work will be required to establish the mechanism by which extracellular cAMP down-regulates PGHS-2 expression. In particular, it will be important to identify the ectophosphoprotein target of PKA activity at the outer surface of HPMECs and to determine the intermediate events leading to the negative regulation of PGHS-2 gene mediated by this ecto-phosphoprotein.

https://openalex.org/W1967343272,"Efficient catalysis in the second step of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component reaction requires a lipoyl group to be attached to a lipoyl domain that displays appropriately positioned specificity residues. As substrates, the human dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase provides an N-terminal (L1) and an inner (L2) lipoyl domain. We evaluated the specificity requirements for the E1 reaction with 27 mutant L2 (including four substitutions for the lipoylated lysine, Lys173), with three analogs substituted for the lipoyl group on Lys173, and with selected L1 mutants. Besides Lys173 mutants, only E170Q mutation prevented lipoylation. Based on analysis of the structural stability of mutants by differential scanning calorimetry, alanine substitutions of residues with aromatic side chains in terminal regions outside the folded portion of the L2 domain significantly decreased the stability of mutant L2, suggesting specific interactions of these terminal regions with the folded domain. E1 reaction rates were markedly reduced by the following substitutions in the L2 domain (equivalent site-L1): L140A, S141A (S14A-L1), T143A, E162A, D172N, and E179A (E52A-L1). These mutants gave diverse changes in kinetic parameters. These residues are spread over >24 Å on one side of the L2 structure, supporting extensive contact between E1 and L2 domain. Alignment of over 40 lipoyl domain sequences supports Ser141, Thr143, and Glu179 serving as specificity residues for use by E1 from eukaryotic sources. Extensive interactions of the lipoyl-lysine prosthetic group within the active site are supported by the limited inhibition of E1 acetylation of native L2 by L2 domains altered either by mutation of Lys173 or enzymatic addition of lipoate analogs to Lys173. Thus, efficient use by mammalian E1 of cognate lipoyl domains derives from unique surface residues with critical interactions contributed by the universal lipoyl-lysine prosthetic group, key specificity residues, and some conserved residues, particularly Asp172 adjacent to Lys173."
