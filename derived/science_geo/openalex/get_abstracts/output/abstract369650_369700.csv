https://openalex.org/W2092869651,"Concern over climate change has led the U.S. to consider a cap-and-trade system to regulate emissions. Here we illustrate the land-use impact to U.S. habitat types of new energy development resulting from different U.S. energy policies. We estimated the total new land area needed by 2030 to produce energy, under current law and under various cap-and-trade policies, and then partitioned the area impacted among habitat types with geospatial data on the feasibility of production. The land-use intensity of different energy production techniques varies over three orders of magnitude, from 1.9-2.8 km(2)/TW hr/yr for nuclear power to 788-1000 km(2)/TW hr/yr for biodiesel from soy. In all scenarios, temperate deciduous forests and temperate grasslands will be most impacted by future energy development, although the magnitude of impact by wind, biomass, and coal to different habitat types is policy-specific. Regardless of the existence or structure of a cap-and-trade bill, at least 206,000 km(2) will be impacted without substantial increases in energy efficiency, which saves at least 7.6 km(2) per TW hr of electricity conserved annually and 27.5 km(2) per TW hr of liquid fuels conserved annually. Climate policy that reduces carbon dioxide emissions may increase the areal impact of energy, although the magnitude of this potential side effect may be substantially mitigated by increases in energy efficiency. The possibility of widespread energy sprawl increases the need for energy conservation, appropriate siting, sustainable production practices, and compensatory mitigation offsets."
https://openalex.org/W2099360322,"The psychotomimetics ketamine and MK-801, non-competitive NMDA receptor (NMDAr) antagonists, induce cognitive impairment and aggravate schizophrenia symptoms. In conscious rats, they produce an abnormal behavior associated with a peculiar brain state characterized by increased synchronization in ongoing gamma (30-80 Hz) oscillations in the frontoparietal (sensorimotor) electrocorticogram (ECoG). This study investigated whether NMDAr antagonists-induced aberrant gamma oscillations are correlated with locomotion and dependent on hyperlocomotion-related sensorimotor processing. This also implied to explore the contribution of intracortical and subcortical networks in the generation of these pathophysiological ECoG gamma oscillations.Quantitative locomotion data collected with a computer-assisted video tracking system in combination with ECoG revealed that ketamine and MK-801 induce highly correlated hyperlocomotion and aberrant gamma oscillations. This abnormal gamma hyperactivity was recorded over the frontal, parietal and occipital cortices. ECoG conducted under diverse consciousness states (with diverse anesthetics) revealed that NMDAr antagonists dramatically increase the power of basal gamma oscillations. Paired ECoG and intracortical local field potential recordings showed that the ECoG mainly reflects gamma oscillations recorded in underlying intracortical networks. In addition, multisite recordings revealed that NMDAr antagonists dramatically enhance the amount of ongoing gamma oscillations in multiple cortical and subcortical structures, including the prefrontal cortex, accumbens, amygdala, basalis, hippocampus, striatum and thalamus.NMDAr antagonists acutely produces, in the rodent CNS, generalized aberrant gamma oscillations, which are not dependent on hyperlocomotion-related brain state or conscious sensorimotor processing. These findings suggest that NMDAr hypofunction-related generalized gamma hypersynchronies represent an aberrant diffuse network noise, a potential electrophysiological correlate of a psychotic-like state. Such generalized noise might cause dysfunction of brain operations, including the impairments in cognition and sensorimotor integration seen in schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2133625859,"In metropolitan areas people travel frequently and extensively but often in highly structured commuting patterns. We investigate the role of this type of human movement in the epidemiology of vector-borne pathogens such as dengue. Analysis is based on a metapopulation model where mobile humans connect static mosquito subpopulations. We find that, due to frequency dependent biting, infection incidence in the human and mosquito populations is almost independent of the duration of contact. If the mosquito population is not uniformly distributed between patches the transmission potential of the pathogen at the metapopulation level, as summarized by the basic reproductive number, is determined by the size of the largest subpopulation and reduced by stronger connectivity. Global extinction of the pathogen is less likely when increased human movement enhances the rescue effect but, in contrast to classical theory, it is not minimized at an intermediate level of connectivity. We conclude that hubs and reservoirs of infection can be places people visit frequently but briefly and the relative importance of human and mosquito populations in maintaining the pathogen depends on the distribution of the mosquito population and the variability in human travel patterns. These results offer an insight in to the paradoxical observation of resurgent urban vector-borne disease despite increased investment in vector control and suggest that successful public health intervention may require a dual approach. Prospective studies can be used to identify areas with large mosquito populations that are also visited by a large fraction of the human population. Retrospective studies can be used to map recent movements of infected people, pinpointing the mosquito subpopulation from which they acquired the infection and others to which they may have transmitted it."
https://openalex.org/W1989199110,"Reports of reduced pain sensitivity in autism have prompted opioid theories of autism and have practical care ramifications. Our objective was to examine behavioral and physiological pain responses, plasma beta-endorphin levels and their relationship in a large group of individuals with autism.The study was conducted on 73 children and adolescents with autism and 115 normal individuals matched for age, sex and pubertal stage. Behavioral pain reactivity of individuals with autism was assessed in three observational situations (parents at home, two caregivers at day-care, a nurse and child psychiatrist during blood drawing), and compared to controls during venepuncture. Plasma beta-endorphin concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay. A high proportion of individuals with autism displayed absent or reduced behavioral pain reactivity at home (68.6%), at day-care (34.2%) and during venepuncture (55.6%). Despite their high rate of absent behavioral pain reactivity during venepuncture (41.3 vs. 8.7% of controls, P<0.0001), individuals with autism displayed a significantly increased heart rate in response to venepuncture (P<0.05). Moreover, this response (Delta heart rate) was significantly greater than for controls (mean+/-SEM; 6.4+/-2.5 vs. 1.3+/-0.8 beats/min, P<0.05). Plasma beta-endorphin levels were higher in the autistic group (P<0.001) and were positively associated with autism severity (P<0.001) and heart rate before or after venepuncture (P<0.05), but not with behavioral pain reactivity.The greater heart rate response to venepuncture and the elevated plasma beta-endorphin found in individuals with autism reflect enhanced physiological and biological stress responses that are dissociated from observable emotional and behavioral reactions. The results suggest strongly that prior reports of reduced pain sensitivity in autism are related to a different mode of pain expression rather than to an insensitivity or endogenous analgesia, and do not support opioid theories of autism. Clinical care practice and hypotheses regarding underlying mechanisms need to assume that children with autism are sensitive to pain."
https://openalex.org/W1988350436,"How do people respond to others' accidental behaviors? Reward and punishment for an accident might depend on the actor's intentions, or instead on the unintended outcomes she brings about. Yet, existing paradigms in experimental economics do not include the possibility of accidental monetary allocations. We explore the balance of outcomes and intentions in a two-player economic game where monetary allocations are made with a “trembling hand”: that is, intentions and outcomes are sometimes mismatched. Player 1 allocates $10 between herself and Player 2 by rolling one of three dice. One die has a high probability of a selfish outcome, another has a high probability of a fair outcome, and the third has a high probability of a generous outcome. Based on Player 1's choice of die, Player 2 can infer her intentions. However, any of the three die can yield any of the three possible outcomes. Player 2 is given the opportunity to respond to Player 1's allocation by adding to or subtracting from Player 1's payoff. We find that Player 2's responses are influenced substantially by the accidental outcome of Player 1's roll of the die. Comparison to control conditions suggests that in contexts where the allocation is at least partially under the control of Player 1, Player 2 will punish Player 1 accountable for unintentional negative outcomes. In addition, Player 2's responses are influenced by Player 1's intention. However, Player 2 tends to modulate his responses substantially more for selfish intentions than for generous intentions. This novel economic game provides new insight into the psychological mechanisms underlying social preferences for fairness and retribution."
https://openalex.org/W2007175840,"Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a secreted protein that is strongly induced in human and experimental heart failure. CTGF is said to be profibrotic; however, the precise function of CTGF is unclear. We generated transgenic mice and rats with cardiomyocyte-specific CTGF overexpression (CTGF-TG). To investigate CTGF as a fibrosis inducer, we performed morphological and gene expression analyses of CTGF-TG mice and rat hearts under basal conditions and after stimulation with angiotensin II (Ang II) or isoproterenol, respectively. Surprisingly, cardiac tissues of both models did not show increased fibrosis or enhanced gene expression of fibrotic markers. In contrast to controls, Ang II treated CTGF-TG mice displayed preserved cardiac function. However, CTGF-TG mice developed age-dependent cardiac dysfunction at the age of 7 months. CTGF related heart failure was associated with Akt and JNK activation, but not with the induction of natriuretic peptides. Furthermore, cardiomyocytes from CTGF-TG mice showed unaffected cellular contractility and an increased Ca2+ reuptake from sarcoplasmatic reticulum. In an ischemia/reperfusion model CTGF-TG hearts did not differ from controls. Our data suggest that CTGF itself does not induce cardiac fibrosis. Moreover, it is involved in hypertrophy induction and cellular remodeling depending on the cardiac stress stimulus. Our new transgenic animals are valuable models for reconsideration of CTGF's profibrotic function in the heart."
https://openalex.org/W1981311183,"Lantibiotics are small microbial peptide antibiotics that are characterized by the presence of the thioether amino acids lanthionine and methyllanthionine. Lantibiotics possess structural genes which encode inactive prepeptides. During maturation, the prepeptide undergoes posttranslational modifications including the introduction of rare amino acids as lanthionine and methyllanthione as well as the proteolytic removal of the leader. The structural gene (lanA) as well as the other genes which are involved in lantibiotic modification (lanM, lanB, lanC, lanP), regulation (lanR, lanK), export (lanT(P)) and immunity (lanEFG) are organized in biosynthetic gene clusters.Sequence comparisons in the NCBI database showed that Bacillus licheniformis DSM 13 harbours a putative lantibiotic gene cluster which comprises two structural genes (licA1, licA2) and two modification enzymes (licM1, licM2) in addition to 10 ORFs that show sequence similarities to proteins involved in lantibiotic production. A heat labile antimicrobial activity was detected in the culture supernatant and a heat stabile activity was present in the isopropanol cell wash extract of this strain. In agar well diffusion assays both fractions exhibited slightly different activity spectra against Gram-positive bacteria. In order to demonstrate the connection between the lantibiotic gene cluster and one of the antibacterial activities, two Bacillus licheniformis DSM 13 mutant strains harbouring insertions in the structural genes of the modification enzymes licM1 and licM2 were constructed. These strains were characterized by a loss of activity in the isopropanol extract and substractive MALDI-TOF predicted masses of 3020.6 Da and 3250.6 Da for the active peptides.In conclusion, B. licheniformis DSM 13 produces an antimicrobial substance that represents the two-peptide lantibiotic lichenicidin and that shows activity against a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains."
https://openalex.org/W1999543219,"Background The complement system, a key component that links the innate and adaptive immune responses, has three pathways: the classical, lectin, and alternative pathways. In the present study, we have analyzed the levels of various complement components in blood samples from dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) patients and found that the level of complement activation is associated with disease severity. Methods and Results Patients with DHF had lower levels of complement factor 3 (C3; p = 0.002) and increased levels of C3a, C4a and C5a (p<0.0001) when compared to those with the less severe form, DF. There were no significant differences between DF and DHF patients in the levels of C1q, immunocomplexes (CIC-CIq) and CRP. However, small but statistically significant differences were detected in the levels of MBL. In contrast, the levels of two regulatory proteins of the alternative pathway varied widely between DF and DHF patients: DHF patients had higher levels of factor D (p = 0.01), which cleaves factor B to yield the active (C3bBb) C3 convertase, and lower levels of factor H (p = 0.03), which inactivates the (C3bBb) C3 convertase, than did DF patients. When we considered the levels of factors D and H together as an indicator of (C3bBb) C3 convertase regulation, we found that the plasma levels of these regulatory proteins in DHF patients favored the formation of the (C3bBb) C3 convertase, whereas its formation was inhibited in DF patients (p<0.0001). Conclusion The data suggest that an imbalance in the levels of regulatory factors D and H is associated with an abnormal regulation of complement activity in DHF patients."
https://openalex.org/W1980034055,"Amoebae that make fruiting bodies consisting of a stalk and spores and classified as closely related to the myxogastrids have classically been placed in the taxon Eumycetozoa. Traditionally, there are three groups comprising Eumycetozoa: myxogastrids, dictyostelids, and the so-called protostelids. Dictyostelids and myxogastrids both make multicellular fruiting bodies that may contain hundreds of spores. Protostelids are those amoebae that make simple fruiting bodies consisting of a stalk and one or a few spores. Protostelid-like organisms have been suggested as the progenitors of the myxogastrids and dictyostelids, and they have been used to formulate hypotheses on the evolution of fruiting within the group. Molecular phylogenies have been published for both myxogastrids and dictyostelids, but little molecular phylogenetic work has been done on the protostelids. Here we provide phylogenetic trees based on the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU) that include 21 protostelids along with publicly available sequences from a wide variety of amoebae and other eukaryotes. SSU trees recover seven well supported clades that contain protostelids but do not appear to be specifically related to one another and are often interspersed among established groups of amoebae that have never been reported to fruit. In fact, we show that at least two taxa unambiguously belong to amoebozoan lineages where fruiting has never been reported. These analyses indicate that we can reject a monophyletic Eumycetozoa, s.l. For this reason, we will hereafter refer to those slime molds with simple fruiting as protosteloid amoebae and/or protosteloid slime molds, not as protostelids. These results add to our understanding of amoebozoan biodiversity, and demonstrate that the paradigms for understanding both nonfruiting and sporulating amoebae must be integrated. Finally, we suggest strategies for future research on protosteloid amoebae and nonfruiting amoebae, and discuss the impact of this work for taxonomists and phylogenomicists."
https://openalex.org/W1970789168,"Objective Intravenous adenosine induces temporary bradycardia. This is due to the activation of extracellular adenosine receptors (ARs). While adenosine can signal through any of four ARs (A1AR, A2AAR, A2BAR, A3AR), previous ex vivo studies implicated the A1AR in the heart-rate slowing effects. Here, we used comparative genetic in vivo studies to address the contribution of individual ARs to the heart-rate slowing effects of intravascular adenosine. Methods and Results We studied gene-targeted mice for individual ARs to define their in vivo contribution to the heart-rate slowing effects of adenosine. Anesthetized mice were treated with a bolus of intravascular adenosine, followed by measurements of heart-rate and blood pressure via a carotid artery catheter. These studies demonstrated dose-dependent slowing of the heart rate with adenosine treatment in wild-type, A2AAR−/−, A2BAR−/−, or A3AR−/− mice. In contrast, adenosine-dependent slowing of the heart-rate was completely abolished in A1AR−/− mice. Moreover, pre-treatment with a specific A1AR antagonist (DPCPX) attenuated the heart-rate slowing effects of adenosine in wild-type, A2AAR−/−, or A2BAR−/− mice, but did not alter hemodynamic responses of A1AR−/− mice. Conclusions The present studies combine pharmacological and genetic in vivo evidence for a selective role of the A1AR in slowing the heart rate during adenosine bolus injection."
https://openalex.org/W2131301185,"In mammals, complex songs are uncommon and few studies have examined song composition or the order of elements in songs, particularly with respect to regional and individual variation. In this study we examine how syllables and phrases are ordered and combined, ie ""syntax"", of the song of Tadarida brasiliensis, the Brazilian free-tailed bat. Specifically, we test whether phrase and song composition differ among individuals and between two regions, we determine variability across renditions within individuals, and test whether phrases are randomly ordered and combined. We report three major findings. First, song phrases were highly stereotyped across two regions, so much so that some songs from the two colonies were almost indistinguishable. All males produced songs with the same four types of syllables and the same three types of phrases. Second, we found that although song construction was similar across regions, the number of syllables within phrases, and the number and order of phrases in songs varied greatly within and among individuals. Last, we determined that phrase order, although diverse, deviated from random models. We found broad scale phrase-order rules and certain higher order combinations that were highly preferred. We conclude that free-tailed bat songs are composed of highly stereotyped phrases hierarchically organized by a common set of syntactical rules. However, within global species-specific patterns, songs male free-tailed bats dynamically vary syllable number, phrase order, and phrase repetitions across song renditions."
https://openalex.org/W4234562195,"Toxin-antitoxin (TA) modules are gene pairs specifying for a toxin and its antitoxin and are found on the chromosomes of many bacteria including pathogens. Here we report how each of five such TA systems in E. coli affect bacterial cell death differently in liquid media and during biofilm formation. Of all these systems, only the TA system mazEF mediated cell death both in liquid media and during biofilm formation. At the other extreme, as our results have revealed here, the TA system dinJ-YafQ is unique in that it is involved only in the death process during biofilm formation. Cell death governed by mazEF and dinJ-YafQ seems to participate in biofilm formation through a novel mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2145089809,"Myelination of white matter in the brain continues throughout adolescence and early adulthood. This cortical immaturity has been suggested as a potential cause of dangerous and impulsive behaviors in adolescence.We tested this hypothesis in a group of healthy adolescents, age 12-18 (N = 91), who underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to delineate cortical white matter tracts. As a measure of real-world risk taking, participants completed the Adolescent Risk Questionnaire (ARQ) which measures engagement in dangerous activities. After adjusting for age-related changes in both DTI and ARQ, engagement in dangerous behaviors was found to be positively correlated with fractional anisotropy and negatively correlated with transverse diffusivity in frontal white matter tracts, indicative of increased myelination and/or density of fibers (ages 14-18, N = 60).The direction of correlation suggests that rather than having immature cortices, adolescents who engage in dangerous activities have frontal white matter tracts that are more adult in form than their more conservative peers."
https://openalex.org/W2080852497,"In mammalian cells, endocytosis of the fluid phase and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) forms GEECs (GPI-AP enriched early endosomal compartments) via an Arf1- and Cdc42-mediated, dynamin independent mechanism. Here we use four different fluorescently labeled probes and several markers in combination with quantitative kinetic assays, RNA interference and high resolution imaging to delineate major endocytic routes in Drosophila cultured cells. We find that the hallmarks of the pinocytic GEEC pathway are conserved in Drosophila and identify garz, the fly ortholog of the GTP exchange factor GBF1, as a novel component of this pathway. Live confocal and TIRF imaging reveals that a fraction of GBF1 GFP dynamically associates with ABD RFP (a sensor for activated Arf1 present on nascent pinosomes). Correspondingly, a GTP exchange mutant of GBF1 has altered ABD RFP localization in the evanescent field and is impaired in fluid phase uptake. Furthermore, GBF1 activation is required for the GEEC pathway even in the presence of Brefeldin A, implying that, like Arf1, it has a role in endocytosis that is separable from its role in secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1987829365,"Following the 1971 ban of DDT in Bangladesh, malaria cases have increased steadily. Malaria persists as a major health problem in the thirteen south-eastern and north-eastern districts of Bangladesh. At present the national malaria control program, largely supported by the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM), provides interventions including advocacy at community level, Insecticide Treated Net (ITN) distribution, introduction of Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDT) and combination therapy with Coartem. It is imperative, therefore, that baseline data on malaria prevalence and other malaria indicators are collected to assess the effectiveness of the interventions and rationalize the prevention and control efforts. The objective of this study was to obtain this baseline on the prevalence of malaria and bed net use in the thirteen malaria endemic districts of Bangladesh.In 2007, BRAC and ICDDR,B carried out a malaria prevalence survey in thirteen malaria endemic districts of Bangladesh. A multi-stage cluster sampling technique was used and 9750 blood samples were collected. Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDT) were used for the diagnosis of malaria. The weighted average malaria prevalence in the thirteen endemic districts was 3.97%. In five south-eastern districts weighted average malaria prevalence rate was 6.00% and in the eight north-eastern districts weighted average malaria prevalence rate was (0.40%). The highest malaria prevalence was observed in Khagrachari district. The majority of the cases (90.18%) were P. falciparum infections. Malaria morbidity rates in five south-eastern districts was 2.94%. In eight north-eastern districts, morbidity was 0.07%.Bangladesh has hypoendemic malaria with P. falciparum the dominant parasite species. The malaria situation in the five north-eastern districts of Bangladesh in particular warrants urgent attention. Detailed maps of the baseline malaria prevalence and summaries of the data collected are provided along with the survey results in full, in a supplemental information."
https://openalex.org/W2136587108,"Empirical observations on how businesses respond after a major catastrophe are rare, especially for a catastrophe as great as Hurricane Katrina, which hit New Orleans, Louisiana on August 29, 2005. We analyzed repeated telephone surveys of New Orleans businesses conducted in December 2005, June 2006, and October 2007 to understand factors that influenced decisions to re-open amid post-disaster uncertainty.Businesses in the group of professional, scientific, and technical services reopened the fastest in the near term, but differences in the rate of reopening for businesses stratified by type became indistinguishable in the longer term (around two years later). A reopening rate of 65% was found for all businesses by October 2007. Discriminant analysis showed significant differences in responses reflecting their attitudes about important factors between businesses that reopened and those that did not. Businesses that remained closed at the time of our third survey (two years after Katrina) ranked levee protection as the top concern immediately after Katrina, but damage to their premises and financing became major concerns in subsequent months reflected in the later surveys. For businesses that had opened (at the time of our third survey), infrastructure protection including levee, utility, and communications were the main concerns mentioned in surveys up to the third survey, when the issue of crime became their top concern.These findings underscore the need to have public policy and emergency plans in place prior to the actual disaster, such as infrastructure protection, so that the policy can be applied in a timely manner before business decisions to return or close are made. Our survey results, which include responses from both open and closed businesses, overcome the ""survivorship bias"" problem and provide empirical observations that should be useful to improve micro-level spatial economic modeling of factors that influence business return decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2019737107,"Even though uncomplicated alcoholics may likely have episodic memory deficits, discrepancies exist regarding to the integrity of brain regions that underlie this function in healthy subjects. Possible relationships between episodic memory and 1) brain microstructure assessed by magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), 2) brain volumes assessed by voxel-based morphometry (VBM) were investigated in uncomplicated, detoxified alcoholics. Diffusion and morphometric analyses were performed in 24 alcohol dependent men without neurological or somatic complications and in 24 healthy men. The mean apparent coefficient of diffusion (ADC) and grey matter volumes were measured in the whole brain. Episodic memory performance was assessed using a French version of the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT). Correlation analyses between verbal episodic memory, brain microstructure, and brain volumes were carried out using SPM2 software. In those with alcohol dependence, higher ADC was detected mainly in frontal, temporal and parahippocampal regions, and in the cerebellum. In alcoholics, regions with higher ADC typically also had lower grey matter volume. Low verbal episodic memory performance in alcoholism was associated with higher mean ADC in parahippocampal areas, in frontal cortex and in the left temporal cortex; no correlation was found between regional volumes and episodic memory scores. Regression analyses for the control group were not significant. These findings support the hypothesis that regional microstructural but no macrostructural alteration of the brain might be responsible, at least in part, for episodic memory deficits in alcohol dependence."
https://openalex.org/W2055892637,"Anoikis, a detachment-induced apoptosis, is a principal mechanism of inhibition of tumor cell metastasis. Tumor cells can acquire anoikis resistance which is frequently observed in metastatic lung cancer. This phenomenon becomes an important obstacle of efficient cancer therapy. Recently, signaling mediators such as caveolin-1 (Cav-1) and nitric oxide (NO) have garnered attention in metastasis research; however, their role and the underlying mechanisms of metastasis regulation are largely unknown. Using human lung carcinoma H460 cells, we show that NO impairs the apoptotic function of the cells after detachment. The NO donors sodium nitroprusside and diethylenetriamine NONOate inhibit detachment-induced apoptosis, whereas the NO inhibitors aminoguanidine and 2-(4-carboxyphenyl) tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide promote this effect. Resistance to anoikis in H460 cells is mediated by Cav-1, which is significantly down-regulated after cell detachment through a non-transcriptional mechanism involving ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation. NO inhibits this down-regulation by interfering with Cav-1 ubiquitination through a process that involves protein S-nitrosylation, which prevents its proteasomal degradation and induction of anoikis by cell detachment.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3256-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Moreover, antisense-induced down-regulation of Cav-1 caused human prostate cancer cells more sensitive to apoptosis (15Li L.

Therefore, the role of Cav-1 in cancer progression remains controversial. caveolin-1 sodium nitroprusside aminoguanidine 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-imidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide dithiothreitol diaminofluorescein diacetate diethylene triamine fluorescein isothiocyanate propidium iodide sodium 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide reverse transcription phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Metastasis is a multistep process composed of cancer cell detachment, migration, extravasation, and adhesion of the detached cells to other target sites. A key mechanism in the regulation of metastasis is anoikis or detachment-induced apoptosis. Previous studies have shown that Cav-1 acts as a negative regulator of anoikis (17Fiucci G. Ravid D. Reich R. Liscovitch M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2365-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 18Ravid D. Maor S. Werner H. Liscovitch M.

Likewise, elevated NO and NO synthase levels have been associated in many human metastatic cancers including the lung (20Liu C.Y. Wang C.H. Chen T.C. Lin H.C. Yu C.T. Kuo H.P. Br. J.

However, the role of NO and its mechanism of metastasis regulation in association with Cav-1 are not well understood. Because resistance to anoikis is a key step in metastasis development and because Cav-1 has been implicated in this process, we investigated the potential regulation of Cav-1 by NO and studied its role in anoikis of human lung carcinoma cells. NO has been reported to have both pro- and anti-apoptotic effect on cells, depending on a variety of factors, including cell type, cellular redox status, and the flux and dose of local NO (28Heigold S. Sers C. Bechtel W. Ivanovas B. Schäfer R. Bauer G. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 929-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 29Iyer A.K. Azad N. Wang L. Rojanasakul Y. Nitric Oxide. 2008; 19: 146-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In human lung carcinoma cells, we previously reported that NO plays a suppressive role in apoptosis induced by a variety of agents, including Fas death ligand (30Chanvorachote P. Nimmannit U. Wang L.

However, the role of NO in cell anoikis and its potential regulation of Cav-1 have not been well investigated. Using molecular and pharmacological approaches, we report here that NO plays an important role in Cav-1 regulation and anoikis function of human lung cancer H460 cells. We also demonstrate for the first time that Cav-1 is down-regulated during cell anoikis through the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation pathway and that NO regulates this process by inducing S-nitrosylation of the protein which inhibits its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Thus, our study reveals the existence of a novel mechanism of anoikis regulation, which might be exploited in metastasis and cancer therapy. Human lung epithelial NCI-H460 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin. Cell cultures were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were passaged at preconfluent densities using a solution containing 0.05% trypsin and 0.5 mm EDTA. The NO donors sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and diethylene triamine (DETA) NONOate and the NO inhibitors 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (PTIO) and aminoguanidine (AG) were obtained from Sigma. These NO modulators are water-soluble and were prepared in a sterile culture medium before use. Diaminofluorescein diacetate (DAF-DA) and Hoechst 33342 were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Monoclonal antibody against Cav-1 and protein A-agarose were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against Akt and phospho-Akt Ser-473 and Thr-308 were from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Antibodies for ubiquitin, S-nitrosocysteine, β-actin, and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Sigma. The transfecting agent Lipofectamine 2000 was from Invitrogen. All other chemicals and reagents including annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), propidium iodide (PI), dithiothreitol (DTT), lactacystin, and LY294002 were from Sigma. Cellular NO production was determined by flow cytometry using DAF-DA as a fluorescent probe and by Griess assay, which measures the stable nitrite byproduct of NO in the culture medium. After detachment, cells (1 × 106/ml) were collected and incubated with 10 μm DAF-DA for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were then washed, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and analyzed for fluorescence intensity using FACSCaliber (BD Biosciences). Signals were obtained using a 488-nm excitation beam and a 538-nm band-pass filter. In some experiments cells were visualized for fluorescence intensity using a fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss Axiovert, Göttingen, Germany). For the Griess assay, cell supernatants were collected, and aliquots (100 μl) were mixed with 100 μl of Griess reagent (1% sulfanilamide, 0.1% naphthyl ethylenediamine dihydrochloride, 2% phosphoric acid) in a 96-well plate. After incubation for 10 min at 25 °C, the absorbance at 550 nm was measured on a microplate reader. Caveolin-1 plasmid (pEX_Cav-1-YFP) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Stable transfectant of Cav-1 was generated by culturing H460 cells in a 6-well plate until they reached 60% confluence. One microgram of cytomegalovirus-neo vector and 15 μl of Lipofectamine reagent with 2 μg of Cav-1 or control pcDNA3 plasmid were used to transfect the cells in the absence of serum. After 12 h the medium was replaced with culture medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. Approximately 36 h after the beginning of the transfection, the cells were digested with 0.03% trypsin, and the cell suspensions were plated onto 75-ml culture flasks and cultured for 24–28 days with G418 selection (600 μg/ml). The pooled stable transfectant was identified by Western blot analysis of Cav-1 and was cultured in G418-free RPMI 1640 medium for at least two passages before each experiment. Adherent H460 cells in culture were trypsinized into a single cell suspension and then seeded in 12-well tissue culture plates coated with 200 μl (6 mg/ml in 95% ethanol) of poly-2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate (poly-HEMA; Sigma) at the density of 1 × 105 cells/ml. Suspended cells were incubated at 37 °C for various times up to 24 h. Cells were then harvested, washed, and stained with annexin V-FITC and analyzed for fluorescence intensity by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. For Hoechst 33342 apoptosis assay, cells were incubated with 10 μm the Hoechst dye for 30 min at 37 °C, and the apoptotic cells having intensely condensed chromatin and/or fragmented nuclei were visualized under a fluorescence microscope. For cell survival assay, cells were similarly treated, harvested, washed, and incubated with 20 μm sodium 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) for 4 h at 37 °C. Optical density was then determined by V-max photometer (Molecular Devices, Inc., Menlo Park, CA) at a wavelength of 450 nm. Cell extracts were performed by incubating the cells in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm sodium chloride, 10% glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min on ice. Cell lysates were collected and assayed for protein content using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Equal amount of proteins per sample (40 μg) were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membranes (Pierce). The transferred membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. Membranes were washed 3 times with Tris-buffered saline, Tween 20 for 10 min and incubated with peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The immune complexes were detected by chemiluminescence (Supersignal West Pico; Pierce) and quantified by imaging densitometry using analyst/PC densitometry software (Bio-Rad). Cells were washed after treatments and lysed in lysis buffer for 30 min on ice. Cell lysates were collected and determined for protein content. Equal amounts of proteins per sample (60 μg) were immunoprecipitated with anti-Cav-1 antibody for 6 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were washed with 30 volumes of lysis buffer, resuspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled at 95 °C for 5 min. The immune complexes were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting as described above. Cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-Cav-1 antibody as described above. The immunoprecipitated protein was analyzed for S-nitrosylation by Western blot using anti-S-nitrosocysteine antibody and by fluorometric measurements as previously described (32Azad N. Vallyathan V. Wang L. Tantishaiyakul V. Stehlik C. Leonard S.S. Rojanasakul Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34124-34134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Briefly, immunoprecipitates were incubated with 200 μm HgCl2 and 200 μm diamino naphthalene in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline for 0.5 h at room temperature followed by the addition of 1 m NaOH. The fluorescent triazole product generated from the reaction between diamino naphthalene and NO released from S-nitrosylated Cav-1 was quantified by fluorometry at the excitation and emission wavelengths of 375 and 450 nm, respectively. Total RNA was extracted with Trizol (Invitrogen), and reverse transcription-PCR was performed with Access RT-PCR System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequences of the PCR primers were: Cav-1 forward, 5′-CGTAGACTCGGAGGGACATC-3′, and reverse, 5′-TTTCGTCACAGTGAAGGTGG-3′; for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, forward, 5′-GCTGAGAACGGGAAGCTTGT-3′, and reverse, 5′-GCCAGGGGTGCTAAGCAG-3′. Reaction products were analyzed after 30 amplification cycles, each of which involved consecutive 1-min steps at 94, 55, and 72 °C. The PCR products were electrophoresed in a 1.5% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed. The results obtained by conventional RT-PCR were verified by quantitative real-time PCR. One microgram of Trizol-extracted RNA was reverse-transcribed in a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 500 μm dNTP, 125 units of MultiScribe Reverse Transcriptase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 40 units of RNase inhibitor, 2.5 μm oligo(dT), 1× TaqMan reverse transcriptase buffer, and 5 mm MgCl2 at 48 °C for 40 min. The primers used in this study were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems): Cav-1 (#AI878826) forward 5′-CGAGAAGCAAGTGTACGACGC-3′, and reverse 5′-ACCACGTCATCGTTGAGGTG-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase forward, 5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3′, and reverse 5′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3′. Amplification was performed at the following cycling conditions: 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. A SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) was used with 1 ng of cDNA and with 100–400 nm primers. A negative control without any cDNA template was run with every assay. All PCR reactions were performed by using ABI PRISM 7900 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Relative mRNA levels were determined by using the comparative CT (threshold cycle) method (33Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127155) Google Scholar), where the caveolin-1 target is normalized to the control and compared with a reference sample (assigned a relative value of 1) by the equation: 2−ΔΔCT. Cells (0.5 × 106/well) were seeded in 6-well poly-HEMA-coated plates and treated with NO modulators as described under “Results.” After treatment, the cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and then permeabilized and blocked in a solution containing 0.5% saponin, 1% bovine serum, and 1.5% goat serum for 30 min. After primary antibody incubation with Cav-1 monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences) at 1:100 dilution for 1 h, cells were washed and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen) for 30 min. Cell nucleus was stained with ToPro-3 (Invitrogen), and the actin cytoskeleton was stained with Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen). Cells were cytospun onto a glass slide and mounted using the anti-fade reagent Fluoromont-G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL). Images were acquired by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510). Data were represented as the means ± S.D. from three or more independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test at a significance level of p < 0.05. NO has been shown to play an important role in the regulation of cancer cell metastasis; however, the underlying mechanism of this regulation is unclear. To test whether NO might regulate this process by inhibiting detachment-induced apoptosis or anoikis, which is a crucial step in the metastasis of cancer cells, we first investigated anoikis of human lung cancer H460 cells in response to various specific NO donors and inhibitors. Anoikis was induced by detaching the cells and incubating them in attachment-resistant poly-HEMA-coated plates for various times and analyzed for cell viability by XTT assay. Fig. 1A shows that detachment of the cells caused a time-dependent decrease in cell viability with ∼55 and 15% of the cells remaining viable after 6 and 12 h, respectively. Analysis of cell apoptosis by flow cytometry using FITC-labeled annexin V antibody shows a significant increase in annexin V-associated cellular fluorescence as early as 6 h after the detachment and reached a maximum at about 18 h (Fig. 1B). In contrast, analysis of cell necrosis using PI as a probe shows no significant increase in the PI signal over a 24-h period. These results suggest that apoptosis is the primary mode of cell death after detachment of H460 cells. Morphologic analysis of apoptotic cell death by fluorescence microscopy using Hoechst 33342 and annexin V-FITC further confirms the results (Fig. 1E). To investigate the role of NO in detachment-induced apoptosis, detached H460 cells were treated with various concentrations of NO donors and inhibitors, and their effect on cell survival was determined by XTT assay. Fig. 1C shows that treatment of the cells with NO donor, SNP, or DETA NONOate caused a dose-dependent decrease in cell death, whereas treatment of the cells with NO inhibitor, AG, or PTIO had an opposite effect. Analysis of cell apoptosis by annexin V-FITC and Hoechst 33342 assays similarly shows the inhibitory and promoting effect of the NO donors and inhibitors, respectively, on detachment-induced cell death (Fig. 1, D and E). The NO donors and inhibitors, when used at the indicated concentrations, had no significant effect on cell necrosis as determined by PI assay (Fig. 1D). To provide a relationship between cell death and NO modulation induced by the test agents, we analyzed cellular NO levels in response to various NO modulator treatments by colorimetric Griess assay and by flow cytometric and microscopic assays using DAF-DA as a fluorescent probe for NO. Fig. 2A shows the result of the Griess assay which measures the stable nitrite breakdown product of NO. Both NO inhibitors AG and PTIO significantly inhibited cellular nitrite production, whereas the NO donors SNP and DETA NONOate increased the production as compared with non-treated control. These results were confirmed by flow cytometric and microscopic assays of NO (Fig. 2, B and C), which show the induction and inhibition of cellular NO levels by the NO donor SNP and NO inhibitor PTIO, respectively. The role of Cav-1 in the regulation of cancer cell anoikis is unclear. We studied this role by stably transfecting H460 cells with Cav-1 or control plasmid and evaluated their effect on detachment-induced cell death. Transfected cells were detached, suspended in poly-HEMA-coated plates, and analyzed for cell survival at various times by XTT assay. Fig. 3A shows that Cav-1-transfected cells exhibited resistance to detachment-induced cell death as compared with control-transfected cells. Western blot analysis of Cav-1 expression in the transfected cells shows an increased expression of Cav-1 protein in the Cav-1-transfected cells compared with control-transfected cells (Fig. 3B). These results indicate the role of Cav-1 as a negative regulator of detachment-induced cell death in lung epithelial H460 cells. Because Cav-1 has been shown to regulate cell death and survival through a PI3K/Akt-dependent mechanism (16Li L. Ren C.H. Tahir S.A. Ren C. Thompson T.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 9389-9404Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 35Zundel W. Swiersz L.M. Giaccia A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1507-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 36Shack S. Wang X.T. Kokkonen G.C. Gorospe M. Longo D.L. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2407-2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we tested the effect of Cav-1 overexpression on Akt activity and examined its effect on detachment-induced cell death. Our results show that Cav-1 overexpression induced Akt activation as indicated by the increased phosphorylation of Akt (Thr-308 and Ser-473), whereas it had no effect on total Akt level (Fig. 3C). The induction of Akt phosphorylation was inhibited by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, suggesting that this induction was mediated through the PI3K pathway. Analysis of apoptosis shows that Cav-1 overexpression decreased detachment-induced cell death and that this effect was inhibited by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that Cav-1 exerts its anti-apoptotic effect during cell detachment through a mechanism that is dependent on PI3K/Akt activation. Fig. 3E shows that under a normal growth condition that allows cell attachment, Cav-1-overexpressing cells exhibited an increased growth rate over control-transfected cells. The lag phase before cell growth was significantly reduced in Cav-1-overexpressing cells. As compared with control-transfected cells, which grew as an epithelial monolayer, Cav-1-overexpressing cells formed cell mounds and grew as multilayer epithelial cells (Fig. 3F). This multilayer growth pattern is consistent with the increased growth rate of Cav-1-overexpressing cells. These results suggest that Cav-1 may function as a tumor promoter by enhancing cell growth. Having demonstrated the role of Cav-1 as a negative regulator of cell anoikis in H460 cells, we next investigated the expression profile of Cav-1 after cell detachment. Detached cells were suspended in attachment-resistant plates for various times and analyzed for Cav-1 protein and mRNA expression by Western blotting and RT-PCR, respectively. Fig. 4A shows that Cav-1 protein levels were significantly reduced in cells after detachment in a time-dependent manner. The reduction was strongly inhibited by lactacystin, a specific proteasome inhibitor, suggesting that detachment-induced Cav-1 down-regulation was mediated through proteasomal degradation. This result was confirmed by the observation that another proteasome inhibitor, MG132, also inhibited the decrease in Cav-1 protein expression (data not shown). Analysis of Cav-1 mRNA levels by RT-PCR shows that Cav-1 transcripts were relatively unchanged after cell detachment (Fig. 4B), whereas the protein levels were substantially reduced. The RT-PCR result was confirmed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, which shows no significant changes in the Cav-1 mRNA level after cell detachment (Fig. 4C). Thus, cell detachment appears to cause Cav-1 protein reduction through a transcription-independent mechanism. These results along with subsequent data showing the effect of cell detachment on Cav-1 ubiquitination support the role of ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation as an important mechanism of Cav-1 down-regulation induced by cell detachment. We further investigated the potential regulation of Cav-1 by NO. Cells were detached and suspended in HEMA-coated plates in the presence or absence of NO donors and inhibitors. Cav-1 protein expression was then determined by Western blotting. Fig. 4D shows that the NO donors SNP and DETA NONOate strongly inhibited detachment-induced Cav-1 down-regulation at the concentrations shown to induce an increase in cellular NO levels (Fig. 2). In contrast, the NO inhibitors AG and PTIO promoted this down-regulation (Fig. 4D). These results were confirmed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy which shows that Cav-1 fluorescence intensity was reduced after cell detachment and that the NO donor SNP was able to inhibit this reduction, whereas the NO inhibitor AG further reduced the signal intensity (Fig. 4E). Although these results are non-quantitative, they support the Western blot data and provide additional evidence for the suppressive role of NO in detachment-induced Cav-1 down-regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2044616456,"Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) have been increasingly implicated in regulation of cellular processes, but a functional role for Ubiquitin C-terminal Hydrolases (UCHs), which has been largely relegated to processing of small ubiquitinated peptides, remains unexplored. One member of the UCH family, UCH L1, is expressed in a number of malignancies suggesting that this DUB might be involved in oncogenic processes, and increased expression and activity of UCH L1 have been detected in EBV-immortalized cell lines. Here we present an analysis of genes regulated by UCH L1 shown by microarray profiles obtained from cells in which expression of the gene was inhibited by RNAi. Microarray data were verified with subsequent real-time PCR analysis. We found that inhibition of UCH L1 activates genes that control apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and at the same time suppresses expression of genes involved in proliferation and migration pathways. These findings are complemented by biological assays for apoptosis, cell cycle progression and migration that support the data obtained from microarray analysis, and suggest that the multi-functional molecule UCH L1 plays a role in regulating principal pathways involved in oncogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1999928896,"The 60-kDa heat shock protein (mHsp60) is a vital cellular complex that mediates the folding of many of the mitochondrial proteins. Its function is executed in cooperation with the co-chaperonin, mHsp10, and requires ATP. Recently, the discovery of a new mHsp60-associated neurodegenerative disorder, MitCHAP-60 disease, has been reported. The disease is caused by a point mutation at position 3 (D3G) of the mature mitochondrial Hsp60 protein, which renders it unable to complement the deletion of the homologous bacterial protein in Escherichia coli (Magen, D., Georgopoulos, C., Bross, P., Ang, D., Segev, Y., Goldsher, D., Nemirovski, A., Shahar, E., Ravid, S., Luder, A., Heno, B., Gershoni-Baruch, R., Skorecki, K., and Mandel, H. (2008) Am. J. Hum. Genet. 83, 30–42). The molecular basis of the MitCHAP-60 disease is still unknown. In this study, we present an in vitro structural and functional analysis of the purified wild-type human mHsp60 and the MitCHAP-60 mutant. We show that the D3G mutation leads to destabilization of the mHsp60 oligomer and causes its disassembly at low protein concentrations. We also show that the mutant protein has impaired protein folding and ATPase activities. An additional mutant that lacks the first three amino acids (N-del), including Asp-3, is similarly impaired in refolding activity. Surprisingly, however, this mutant exhibits profound stabilization of its oligomeric structure. These results suggest that the D3G mutation leads to entropic destabilization of the mHsp60 oligomer, which severely impairs its chaperone function, thereby causing the disease.

These results suggest that the D3G mutation leads to entropic destabilization of the mHsp60 oligomer, which severely impairs its chaperone function, thereby causing the disease. Type I chaperonins are essential molecular chaperones of the Hsp60 family found in eubacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts (1Levy-Rimler G. Bell R.E. Ben-Tal N. Azem A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). They are key players in mediating the correct folding of newly translated, translocated, and stress-denatured proteins. The folding function of chaperonins is executed by the coordinated action of two oligomeric proteins, Hsp60 (also named cpn60 and in bacteria GroEL) and its co-chaperonin Hsp10 (also named cpn10 and in bacteria GroES). The GroEL molecule is composed of 14 subunits that form a barrel-like structure that consists of two back-to-back stacked heptameric rings with a large cavity at each end termed the “Anfinsen cage.” GroES is a heptameric ring formed by ∼10-kDa subunits. The co-chaperonin binds to the chaperonin in the presence of ATP and Mg2+ via a short, unstructured, but highly conserved region known as the mobile loop (2Landry S.J. Taher A.

Nature. 1993; 364: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Due to the stability of the GroEL/ES oligomers and the ease with which they can be purified from bacteria, they have become the primary targets for study in the field of chaperonins. As a result, almost all of our knowledge concerning the structure and mechanism of chaperonins, both Hsp60 and Hsp10, is based largely on data from experiments on these E. coli proteins. The chaperonin reaction cycle starts when a non-folded protein substrate binds to the surface of the cavity of one of the GroEL rings. ATP-dependent GroES binding to that (cis) ring causes a dramatic conformational change that leads to a doubling of the cavity size and a switch in the cavity surface from being hydrophobic to hydrophilic. These conformational changes trigger the release of the encapsulated substrate protein into the cavity, where it can fold in a protected environment (4Hartl F.U.

Subsequent binding of ATP and GroES to the opposite (trans) ring promotes the release of GroES, ADP, and protein substrate from the cis ring into bulk solution.

Initial studies showed that, in contrast to wild-type mHsp60, the mutant, together with mHsp10, was not able to fully complement a deletion of the bacterial homologues, GroEL and GroES, in E. coli (24Magen D.

GroEL was purified as described previously (26Bonshtien A.L. Weiss C. Vitlin A. Niv A. Lorimer G.H. Azem A. J. Biol.

The engineered plasmid overexpresses mHsp60 containing an octa-histidine tag at its amino terminus that can be removed after treatment with tobacco etch virus protease. The Rosetta™ E. coli strain (Novagen) was used as an overexpression host for all constructs in this study. The complete purification protocol will be described elsewhere. Briefly, mHsp60 monomers were first purified using a nickel-agarose column. Following removal of the histidine tag and further purification on an ion exchange column, oligomers were reconstituted as described previously (28Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G. Bergmeier W. Weiss C.

Protein concentrations mentioned in this study refer to monomer concentrations and were determined using the bicinchoninic acid kit (Sigma catalog number BCA1). Due to cloning constraints, the various constructs used in this study contain minor differences at their amino termini. Fig. 1 details the various constructs examined in this study and the sequence of their amino termini. Cross-linking with glutardialdehyde was carried out to verify the oligomeric state of mHsp60. For this purpose, a given concentration of mHsp60 was incubated with 0.1% glutardialdehyde for 10 min at 25 °C in buffer A (50 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.5) 100 mm KCl, 30 mm MgCl2) or buffer B (100 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2). The cross-linking reaction was stopped by the addition of 3× SDS sample buffer containing 1 m urea and boiled for 5 min. The cross-linking products, containing 9 μg of protein, were separated on 2.4–12% acrylamide gradient SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. The refolding assay of HCl-denatured MDH was carried out as described previously (29Bonshtien A.L. Parnas A. Sharkia R. Niv A. Mizrahi I. Azem A. Weiss C.

The reactions were carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol at 25 °C. The mutation Asp-3 → Gly in the mature mHsp60 protein was recently suggested to be the cause for the MitCHAP-60 disease in humans (24Magen D. Georgopoulos C. Bross P. Ang D. Segev Y. Goldsher D.

Previous works revealed the importance of the corresponding region in the bacterial GroEL for its stability (32Horovitz A. Bochkareva E.S. Girshovich A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9957-9959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Horovitz A. Bochkareva E.S. Kovalenko O. Girshovich A.S. J. Mol.

Consequently, we first sought to examine the effect of the D3G mutation on the stability of the mHsp60 oligomer. For this purpose, wild-type mHsp60 and the D3G mutant were expressed in bacteria and purified. In the last step of purification, we used gel filtration to separate active oligomeric forms of the protein from unassembled potentially inactive monomers (14Levy-Rimler G. Viitanen P. Weiss C. Sharkia R. Greenberg A. Niv A. Lustig A. Delarea Y. Azem A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3465-3472Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 28Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G. Bergmeier W. Weiss C. Kessel M. Goloubinoff P. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All examined preparations eluted in two peaks corresponding to monomers and oligomers (supplemental Fig. 2S). The monomeric and oligomeric fractions were subjected to cross-linking following dilution to a protein concentration of 10 μm. It can be seen in Fig. 2 that wild-type mHsp60 is mainly a heptamer with a minor fraction of tetradecamers and monomers. In contrast, the D3G mutant is mainly in subheptameric forms with undetectable tetradecameric forms. Because both the wild-type mHsp60 and the D3G mutant eluted from the gel filtration column as oligomers, it appears that the mutant is less stable than the wild type and, therefore, dissociates more upon dilution. To further explore this possibility, we examined the oligomeric state of both proteins at different protein concentrations. The results presented in Fig. 3A demonstrate clearly that wild-type mHsp60 and the D3G mutant undergo dissociation when diluted to low concentrations, whereas at high protein concentrations, the oligomeric fraction is enriched. When ATP was included in the cross-linking reaction, the bands corresponding to the oligomeric forms were much stronger, and even the formation of tetradecamers could now be observed (Fig. 3B). These results are in accord with previously published results (14Levy-Rimler G. Viitanen P. Weiss C. Sharkia R. Greenberg A. Niv A. Lustig A. Delarea Y. Azem A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3465-3472Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Notably, the oligomers of the D3G mutant were much more sensitive to dilution than the wild-type oligomers. This is evident at the lowest concentrations examined (1 and 2.5 μm), in which the D3G mutant was completely dissociated into monomers, whereas a significant fraction of the wild-type mHsp60 was found as heptamers. As shown in Fig. 4, the dissociation of the D3G oligomer is also time-dependent. At 10 μm protein, complete dissociation of the D3G mutant was reached after 60 min, at which time only ∼30% of the wild-type protein was monomeric (Fig. 4A). At a protein concentration of 2.5 μm, dissociation of the oligomer to monomers was much more rapid. Ten minutes after dilution of proteins, all the D3G protein was found as monomers, whereas ∼30% of the wild-type protein was still oligomeric even after a 3-h incubation (Fig. 4B). Purified wild-type mHsp60 and the D3G mutant exhibited similar CD spectra (supplemental Fig. 4S), which suggests that the observed rapid dissociation of the D3G oligomers is not due to a drastic change in the secondary structure of the protein. We conclude that one main effect of the D3G mutation on mHsp60 is destabilization of the oligomeric structure of the protein.FIGURE 3The effect of protein concentration on the oligomeric state of wild-type (WT) mHsp60 and the D3G mutant.

We, therefore, examined the ATPase activity of the D3G mutant when compared with that of the wild-type mHsp60. Taking into consideration the above mentioned observed effect of protein concentration on the oligomeric state of the protein, we examined the ATPase activity at different protein concentrations (Fig. 5A). Wild-type mHsp60 was found to have ATPase activity with a rate constant of 0.44 min−1. This rate was the same at all protein concentrations examined (from 1 to 30 μm) and independent of protein concentration. Notably, the ATPase activity of the D3G mutant was found to differ from that of the wild-type protein in (i) its significantly lower rate and (ii) the dependence of the rate on the protein concentration. Even at high protein concentrations, when the D3G mutant was expected to assemble into oligomers, its ATPase activity was only ∼40% of that observed for the wild-type protein. This result suggests that the D3G mutation severely impairs the ATPase activity of mHsp60 in addition to destabilizing the oligomeric structure of the protein. We next asked how the altered structural and ATP hydrolysis properties of the D3G mutant affect its ability to refold denatured proteins. For this purpose, we examined the chaperone properties of D3G and wild-type mHsp60 using MDH as a model substrate (Fig. 6). When HCl-denatured MDH was refolded with the help of either GroEL or wild-type mHsp60, in the presence of mHsp10, the yields of refolding after 2 h were 82 and 88%, respectively. The refolding yield in the presence of the D3G mutant and mHsp10 was found to be smaller (∼60%). Notably, although the refolding yield that is obtained with GroEL in the absence of co-chaperonin and ATP was close to background levels and did not increase over time (not shown), the yields obtained with wild-type mHsp60 and the D3G mutant, in the absence of ATP and mHsp10, were higher and increased with increasing incubation time. Thus, after a 2-h incubation, the yields in the case of the wild type and the D3G mutant were 25 and 30%, respectively. The latter result can be explained by a “minichaperone effect” (35Altamirano M.M. Golbik R. Zahn R. Buckle A.M. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 3576-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 36Buckle A.M. Zahn R. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 3571-3575Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) due to the instability of the oligomeric structures of the D3G mutant and, although to a lesser extent, of the wild-type mHsp60. In other words, the chaperonins are able to bind unfolded proteins, but upon their dis-oligomerization, the unfolded substrate is released into solution in a form that is able, in vitro, to refold spontaneously. This explanation is supported by the observation that in the presence of ATP, which stabilizes the oligomeric state of mHsp60, the spontaneous refolding did not increase with increasing incubation time. Finally, another difference between the D3G mutant and wild-type mHsp60 is related to the rate of their protein folding activity. In the presence of both ATP and mHsp10, the maximum yield in the case of the wild-type protein was reached after 15 min, whereas in the case of the D3G mutant, it was reached after ∼45 min. In summary, the defective protein folding activity of the D3G mutant is reflected in both the yield and the rate when compared with the wild-type mHsp60. The most obvious explanation for the effect of the D3G mutation on the structural stability of mHsp60 is that Asp-3 participates in interactions that are important for the stabilization of the oligomeric structure of the protein (e.g. salt bridges). However, the known crystal structures of GroEL do not provide any support for such an explanation. An alternative explanation is that the amino terminus of mHsp60 becomes more unstructured and can adopt more conformations in the monomeric state when aspartate is replaced with glycine. The D3G mutation, therefore, increases the loss of conformational entropy upon oligomerization that leads to destabilization of the oligomeric form. We reasoned that a test for this explanation would be to examine the effect of deletion of the first three amino acids (including Asp-3) of the mature mHsp60. If the latter explanation is correct, then the deletion should not lead to destabilization of the mHsp60 oligomer, and its chaperone activity will be maintained. If, however, the former explanation is correct, then the deletion should result in a destabilizing effect, as in the case of the D3G mutation. The results presented in Fig. 2 show clearly that deletion of the first three amino acids of mHsp60 (N-del) creates a very stable oligomer, even when compared with the wild-type protein. Cross-linking products corresponding to subheptameric forms of the protein are barely observed. The N-del oligomer was also found to be more resistant to heat-induced aggregation in comparison with wild-type mHsp60 and the D3G mutant (supplemental Fig. 3S) and to have a CD spectrum exhibiting slightly more secondary structure than the wild type and the D3G mutant (supplemental Fig. 4S). Interestingly, the yield of refolded MDH that is obtained with the N-del protein was close to that obtained with the D3G mutant (Fig. 6). In summary, we found that deletion of the first three amino acids in mHsp60 leads to unexpected stabilization of the protein but reduced chaperone activity (∼50% of the wild-type activity), ruling out the possible participation of Asp-3 in stabilizing interactions. To gain more insight into the effect of the deletion mutant (N-del), we examined the ability of this mutant to hydrolyze ATP. When present alone, N-del was found to have a very low rate constant of ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 5A) of 0.036 min−1, which is ∼8 and 21% of those of the wild-type protein and the D3G mutant, respectively. Examining the ATPase activity of the wild type and the two mutants in the presence of mHsp10 yielded a very surprising result (Fig. 5B). In the case of the wild-type protein, the addition of mHsp10 resulted in 30% inhibition of its hydrolysis rate, whereas in the case of the D3G mutant, the ATPase activity was increased by 70% (although the co-chaperonin is expected to inhibit the ATPase activity by 50% (37Chandrasekhar G.N. Tilly K. Woolford C. Hendrix R. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12414-12419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Previous studies showed that mHsp10 stabilizes the oligomeric structure of the unstable mitochondrial and chloroplast chaperonins and, therefore, can cause an indirect activation of the ATPase activity as observed in the case of the D3G mutant (14Levy-Rimler G. Viitanen P. Weiss C. Sharkia R. Greenberg A. Niv A. Lustig A. Delarea Y. Azem A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3465-3472Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 29Bonshtien A.L. Parnas A. Sharkia R. Niv A. Mizrahi I. Azem A. Weiss C. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2009; 14: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the rate of ATP hydrolysis by the N-del mutant was enhanced by 650% when mHsp10 was included. As this mutant has a very stable oligomeric structure, this increase in ATPase activity cannot be explained by the stabilization effect of mHsp10 on the N-del mutant. How can deletion of the first three amino acids cause such a profound effect on the ATP hydrolysis properties of mHsp60? The allosteric regulation of ATP hydrolysis by mHsp60 requires a fine tuning of the strength of contacts between the subunits of the mHsp60 oligomer. Thus, it could be that the deletion leads to a very strong association between the subunits of the oligomer in a less active T state (38Yifrach O. Horovitz A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5303-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) that switches to the more active R state only upon the addition of ATP and mHsp10. Consequently, deletion of the three amino-terminal amino acids results in impaired ATP hydrolysis only in the absence of mHsp10. The aim of this study was to determine the molecular basis of the MitCHAP-60 disease caused by the D3G mutation. For this purpose, we studied the structural and functional properties of the purified D3G mutant and compared them with those of wild-type mHsp60 and a deletion mutant, in which the first three amino acids were removed. We demonstrated that at high protein concentrations, the D3G mutant can assemble into oligomers (heptamers and tetradecamers). However, the D3G oligomers are unstable when compared with wild-type mHsp60 and dissociate into monomers rapidly upon dilution. Interestingly, the deletion mutant was found to be much more stable than both the wild type and the D3G mutant. Taken together, our results suggest that the D3G mutation leads to entropic destabilization of the oligomer that may cause the MitCHAP-60 disease. Given, however, that the very stable deletion mutant has altered ATPase and protein folding activities, it is likely that the D3G mutation also has allosteric effects that remain to be identified. In summary, we suggest that the D3G mutation impairs the protein folding activity of mHsp60 by its profound destabilization effect on the mHsp60 oligomer and by disrupting its ATPase function by a yet to be determined mechanism."

Here we show for the first time, a method in which EMG signals generated by hand and forearm muscles during handwriting activity are reliably translated into both algorithm-generated handwriting traces and font characters using decoding algorithms. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of recreating handwriting solely from EMG signals – the finding that can be utilized in computer peripherals and myoelectric prosthetic devices. Moreover, this approach may provide a rapid and sensitive method for diagnosing a variety of neurogenerative diseases before other symptoms become clear."
https://openalex.org/W2016579980,"Background Growing evidence indicates that the functional state of microglial cells differs according to the pathological conditions that trigger their activation. In particular, activated microglial cells can express sets of Kv subunits which sustain delayed rectifying potassium currents (Kdr) and modulate differently microglia proliferation and ability to release mediators. We recently reported that hippocampal microglia is in a particular activation state after a status epilepticus (SE) and the present study aimed at identifying which of the Kv channels are functionally expressed by microglia in this model. Methodology/Principal Findings SE was induced by systemic injection of kainate in CX3CR1eGFP/+ mice and whole cell recordings of fluorescent microglia were performed in acute hippocampal slices prepared 48 h after SE. Microglia expressed Kdr currents which were characterized by a potential of half-maximal activation near −25 mV, prominent steady-state and cumulative inactivations. Kdr currents were almost abolished by the broad spectrum antagonist 4-Aminopyridine (1 mM). In contrast, tetraethylammonium (TEA) at a concentration of 1 mM, known to block Kv3.1, Kv1.1 and 1.2 subunits, only weakly reduced Kdr currents. However, at a concentration of 5 mM which should also affect Kv1.3 and 1.6, TEA inhibited about 30% of the Kdr conductance. Alpha-dendrotoxin, which selectively inhibits Kv1.1, 1.2 and 1.6, reduced only weakly Kdr currents, indicating that channels formed by homomeric assemblies of these subunits are not important contributors of Kdr currents. Finally, agitoxin-2 and margatoxin strongly inhibited the current. Conclusions/Significance These results indicate that Kv1.3 containing channels predominantly determined Kdr currents in activated microglia after SE."
https://openalex.org/W2072272565,"Delta-catenin was first identified because of its interaction with presenilin-1, and its aberrant expression has been reported in various human tumors and in patients with Cri-du-Chat syndrome, a form of mental retardation. However, the mechanism whereby delta-catenin is regulated in cells has not been fully elucidated. We investigated the possibility that glycogen-synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) phosphorylates delta-catenin and thus affects its stability. Initially, we found that the level of delta-catenin was greater and the half-life of delta-catenin was longer in GSK-3beta(-/-) fibroblasts than those in GSK-3beta(+/+) fibroblasts. Furthermore, four different approaches designed to specifically inhibit GSK-3 activity, i.e. GSK-3-specific chemical inhibitors, Wnt-3a conditioned media, small interfering RNAs, and GSK-3alpha and -3beta kinase dead constructs, consistently showed that the levels of endogenous delta-catenin in CWR22Rv-1 prostate carcinoma cells and primary cortical neurons were increased by inhibiting GSK-3 activity. In addition, it was found that both GSK-3alpha and -3beta interact with and phosphorylate delta-catenin. The phosphorylation of DeltaC207-delta-catenin (lacking 207 C-terminal residues) and T1078A delta-catenin by GSK-3 was noticeably reduced compared with that of wild type delta-catenin, and the data from liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analyses suggest that the Thr(1078) residue of delta-catenin is one of the GSK-3 phosphorylation sites. Treatment with MG132 or ALLN, specific inhibitors of proteosome-dependent proteolysis, increased delta-catenin levels and caused an accumulation of ubiquitinated delta-catenin. It was also found that GSK-3 triggers the ubiquitination of delta-catenin. These results suggest that GSK-3 interacts with and phosphorylates delta-catenin and thereby negatively affects its stability by enabling its ubiquitination/proteosome-mediated proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2091505123,"The general prevalence of sexual reproduction over asexual reproduction among organisms testifies to the evolutionary benefits of recombination, such as accelerated adaptation to changing environments and elimination of deleterious mutations. Documented instances of asexual reproduction in groups otherwise dominated by sexual reproduction challenge evolutionary biologists to understand the special circumstances that might confer an advantage to asexual reproductive strategies. Here we report one such instance of asexual reproduction in the ants. We present evidence for obligate thelytoky in the asexual fungus-gardening ant, Mycocepurus smithii, in which queens produce female offspring from unfertilized eggs, workers are sterile, and males appear to be completely absent. Obligate thelytoky is implicated by reproductive physiology of queens, lack of males, absence of mating behavior, and natural history observations. An obligate thelytoky hypothesis is further supported by the absence of evidence indicating sexual reproduction or genetic recombination across the species' extensive distribution range (Mexico-Argentina). Potential conflicting evidence for sexual reproduction in this species derives from three Mycocepurus males reported in the literature, previously regarded as possible males of M. smithii. However, we show here that these specimens represent males of the congeneric species M. obsoletus, and not males of M. smithii. Mycocepurus smithii is unique among ants and among eusocial Hymenoptera, in that males seem to be completely absent and only queens (and not workers) produce diploid offspring via thelytoky. Because colonies consisting only of females can be propagated consecutively in the laboratory, M. smithii could be an adequate study organism a) to test hypotheses of the population-genetic advantages and disadvantages of asexual reproduction in a social organism and b) inform kin conflict theory.For a Portuguese translation of the abstract, please see Abstract S1."
https://openalex.org/W1982970035,"It has been assumed that the unusual tail club of ankylosaurid dinosaurs was used actively as a weapon, but the biological feasibility of this behaviour has not been examined in detail. Ankylosaurid tail clubs are composed of interlocking vertebrae, which form the handle, and large terminal osteoderms, which form the knob.Computed tomographic (CT) scans of several ankylosaurid tail clubs referred to Dyoplosaurus and Euoplocephalus, combined with measurements of free caudal vertebrae, provide information used to estimate the impact force of tail clubs of various sizes. Ankylosaurid tails are modeled as a series of segments for which mass, muscle cross-sectional area, torque, and angular acceleration are calculated. Free caudal vertebrae segments had limited vertical flexibility, but the tail could have swung through approximately 100 degrees laterally. Muscle scars on the pelvis record the presence of a large M. longissimus caudae, and ossified tendons alongside the handle represent M. spinalis. CT scans showed that knob osteoderms were predominantly cancellous, which would have lowered the rotational inertia of the tail club and made it easier to wield as a weapon.Large knobs could generate sufficient force to break bone during impacts, but average and small knobs could not. Tail swinging behaviour is feasible in ankylosaurids, but it remains unknown whether the tail was used for interspecific defense, intraspecific combat, or both."
https://openalex.org/W1983175721,"Chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs) found in the environment is one of the most significant and widespread environmental health risks in the U.S. and throughout the world. It is associated with a broad range of health effects from cancer to diabetes as well as reproductive and developmental anomalies. This diversity of diseases can also result from disruption of metabolic and other cellular processes regulated by steroid hormone receptors via aberrant transcriptional regulation. Significantly, exposure to iAs inhibits steroid hormone-mediated gene activation. iAs exposure is associated with disease, but is also used therapeutically to treat specific cancers complicating an understanding of iAs action. Transcriptional activation by steroid hormone receptors is accompanied by changes in histone and non-histone protein post-translational modification (PTM) that result from the enzymatic activity of coactivator and corepressor proteins such as GRIP1 and CARM1. This study addresses how iAs represses steroid receptor-regulated gene transcription. PTMs on histones H3 and H4 at the glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-activated mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter were identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis following exposure to steroid hormone±iAs. Histone H3K18 and H3R17 amino acid residues had significantly different patterns of PTMs after treatment with iAs. Promoter interaction of the coactivator CARM1 was disrupted, but the interaction of GRIP1, a p160 coactivator through which CARM1 interacts with a promoter, was intact. Over-expression of CARM1 was able to fully restore and GRIP1 partially restored iAs-repressed transcription indicating that these coactivators are functionally associated with iAs-mediated transcriptional repression. Both are essential for robust transcription at steroid hormone regulated genes and both are associated with disease when inappropriately expressed. We postulate that iAs effects on CARM1 and GRIP1 may underlie some of its therapeutic effects and as well be associated with its toxic effects."
https://openalex.org/W2026412817,"Apolipoprotein E (apoE) and its receptor, very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), are involved in fat accumulation in adipocytes. Here, we investigated the effect of a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma agonist, rosiglitazone, on regulation of VLDLR expression both in white adipose tissue (WAT) of obese mice and in cultured adipocytes. Furthermore, to determine whether rosiglitazone directly regulates transcription of the VLDLR gene, we carried out luciferase assay with a reporter gene containing mouse VLDLR promoter region, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Four-day treatment with rosiglitazone increased the expression of VLDLR in WAT of ob/ob mice. Moreover, rosiglitazone increased the expression of VLDLR in cultured adipocytes. The PPAR-responsive element (PPRE)-directed mutagenesis analyses revealed that the PPRE motif in the VLDLR promoter region plays a significant role in transcriptional activation of the VLDLR gene in adipocytes. In addition, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that endogenous PPARgamma directly binds to this functional PPRE motif in the VLDLR promoter region. We also investigated the effects of rosiglitazone on insulin sensitivity and lipid accumulation in both ob/ob mice and apoE-deficient ob/ob mice. Rosiglitazone ameliorated insulin sensitivity in both ob/ob mice and apoE-deficient ob/ob mice, possibly through decreasing the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), increasing the expression of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) in WAT, and increasing plasma adiponectin concentration. In ob/ob mice, body weight and WAT weight were significantly higher in the mice treated with rosiglitazone than those treated with vehicle. However, in apoE-deficient ob/ob mice, no significant difference in body weight or WAT weight was observed between the vehicle-treated group and the rosiglitazone-treated group. Moreover, rosiglitazone did not increase body weight and WAT weight in VLDLR-deficient mice. These findings indicate that rosiglitazone directly increases VLDLR expression, thereby enhancing apoE-VLDLR-dependent lipid accumulation in adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2060861975,"Projection neurons of mammalian olfactory bulb (OB), mitral and tufted cells, have dendrites whose morphologies are specifically differentiated for efficient odor information processing. The apical dendrite extends radially and arborizes in single glomerulus where it receives primary input from olfactory sensory neurons that express the same odor receptor. The lateral dendrites extend horizontally in the external plexiform layer and make reciprocal dendrodendritic synapses with granule cells, which moderate mitral/tufted cell activity. The molecular mechanisms regulating dendritic development of mitral/tufted cells is one of the unsolved important problems in the olfactory system. Here, we focused on TrkB receptors to test the hypothesis that neurotrophin-mediate mechanisms contributed to dendritic differentiation of OB mitral/tufted cells.With immunohistochemical analysis, we found that the TrkB neurotrophin receptor is expressed by both apical and lateral dendrites of mitral/tufted cells and that expression is evident during the early postnatal days when these dendrites exhibit their most robust growth and differentiation. To examine the effect of TrkB activation on mitral/tufted cell dendritic development, we cultured OB neurons. When BDNF or NT4 were introduced into the cultures, there was a significant increase in the number of primary neurites and branching points among the mitral/tufted cells. Moreover, BDNF facilitated filopodial extension along the neurites of mitral/tufted cells.In this report, we show for the first time that TrkB activation stimulates the dendritic branching of mitral/tufted cells in developing OB. This suggests that arborization of the apical dendrite in a glomerulus is under the tight regulation of TrkB activation."

Here we identified G-protein-coupled receptor kinase-interacting proteins (GIT), GIT1 and GIT2, as novel IP3R-binding proteins.

IP3Rs are composed of five functional domains. The long NH2-terminal cytoplasmic region contains three domains, a coupling/suppressor domain, an IP3-binding core domain, and an internal coupling domain. The COOH-terminal region has a six-membrane spanning channel domain and a short cytoplasmic CTT “gatekeeper domain” that is critical for IP3R channel opening (2Mikoshiba K. J.

The Ca2+ response was quantitated as the area under the response curve (AUC). Data are presented as mean ± S.D. of at least five independent experiments. TUNEL staining was performed according to the protocol of Chemicon International. Coverslips were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories). Fluorescent images were obtained using a digital microscope (BZ-8000, Osaka, Japan). Data are presented as mean ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments. To understand the function of the CTT of IP3R (Fig. 1A), we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a mixture of embryonic and adult human brain cDNA libraries with the CTT of IP3R1 as bait to search for novel IP3R-binding molecules. Nineteen prey clones were obtained. Seven of these clones encoded protein 4.1N fragments (20Zhang S. Mizutani A. Hisatsune C. Higo T. Bannai H. Nakayama T. Hattori M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4048-4056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and 2 clones encoded the different lengths of the GIT1 fragment (Fig. 1B). The interaction between GIT1 and IP3R1/CTT was confirmed by a glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay (Fig. 1C) and also by an immunoprecipitation (IP) assay from mouse whole brain lysates using anti-IP3R1 (Fig. 1D) and anti-GIT1 antibodies (Fig. 1E). To determine whether both GIT1 and GIT2 bind to all three subtypes of IP3R, mRFP-fused GIT1 or GIT2 was coexpressed with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused IP3R1, IP3R2, or IP3R3, in HeLa cells, and IP was performed using anti-RFP antibody from the cell lysates. All three subtypes of IP3R were coprecipitated with GIT1 (Fig. 1F) and GIT2 (Fig. 1G), implying that both GIT1 and GIT2 bind to all three subtypes of IP3R. The interaction between the shorter GIT1 fragment identified from the yeast two-hybrid screen and full-length or serial deletions of the CTT of IP3R1, IP3R2, and IP3R3 were examined by a liquid yeast two-hybrid quantification assay to determine the minimal region responsible for IP3R binding to GIT. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, we found that the last 50 (IP3R1 and IP3R2) or 44 (IP3R3) residues within CTT showed 5–8-fold stronger binding to the GIT1 fragment as compared with the full-length CTT of the corresponding IP3R subtype. Thereafter, we called these peptides “IP3R/GITCOREs,” which means “GIT-binding cores in IP3Rs.” Within IP3R/GITCOREs, the first 10 residues in all three IP3R/GITCOREs and the last 14 residues in both IP3R1 and IP3R2 or the last 8 residues in IP3R3 are essential for the interaction (Fig. 2, A and B). All three purified GST-fused IP3R/GITCOREs pulled down the purified GIT1 protein fragment in vitro (Fig. 2, C and D), indicating that the IP3R/GITCORE is sufficient for GIT binding and that the interaction is direct. By searching functional protein motifs within the CTT of IP3Rs, we found that a potential coiled-coil domain, which is usually involved in protein-protein interaction, was localized in the CTT of all three IP3Rs, and that IP3R/GITCORE partially overlapped with the coiled-coil domain (Fig. 2E). These findings suggested that the coiled-coil domain within the CTT of IP3R is involved in the GIT-IP3R interaction. To determine the precise IP3R binding region in GIT, mRFP-fused full-length fragment or subfragments of GIT1 (Fig. 2F) were expressed in HeLa cells and subjected to a pull-down assay using GST-IP3R2/GITCORE. Peptides containing residues 691–721 of GIT1 bound to IP3R, whereas peptides not containing these residues failed to bind (Fig. 2G). Because these residues contain the second IQ-like motif, consisting of LQXXXR (where X represents any amino acid; Fig. 2, F and I), we further examined whether this IQ-like motif of GIT is involved in the binding. Several single, double, and triple point mutants within this IQ-like motif of mRFP-GIT1 (Fig. 2F) were expressed in HeLa cells and subjected to pull-down assay. We found that mRFP-L712A, L712A/Q713A, and L712A/Q713A/R717A abolished the interaction with GST-IP3R2/GITCORE (Fig. 2H). Thus, the Leu712 residue of GIT1 is critical for binding to IP3R. By comparing of the homology in the COOH-terminal region of GIT proteins, we found that the Leu712 of GIT1 is conserved in all GIT proteins of all species (Fig. 2I), which suggests that the GIT-IP3R interaction is evolutionarily conserved. Cytosolic Ca2+ elevation triggers the conformational change of IP3R (21Hamada K. Miyata T. Mayanagi K. Hirota J. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21115-21118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Alternatively, GIT contains putative EF-hand and IQ-like motifs for Ca2+ and calmodulin binding, respectively (Fig. 1B). We therefore investigated whether the GIT-IP3R interaction is regulated by a cytosolic Ca2+ concentration by a pull-down assay with GST-IP3R2/GITCORE against mRFP-GIT1 expressed in HeLa cells in the presence of various concentrations of Ca2+. We found that the amount of mRFP-GIT1 pulled down by GST-IP3R2/GITCORE increased with serial elevation of the Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 3A). To corroborate this observation in vivo, HeLa cells were stimulated with 10 μM ATP, an activator of purinergic receptors (Fig. 3B), or 1.0 μM thapsigargin (TG) (Fig. 3C), an inhibitor of the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, to increase cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, and the cell lysates were subjected to the IP assay using anti-GIT1 antibody. We found that both stimulants increased the amount of all three IP3R subtypes coprecipitated with GIT1. Thus, the above data suggested that an elevated cytosolic Ca2+ concentration favors GIT-IP3R association. We investigated whether GIT regulates the channel activity of IP3R by an in vitro Ca2+ release assay using mouse cerebellar microsomes to explore the functional consequences of the GIT-IP3R interaction. The microsomes were preincubated with or without recombinant wild-type or mutant GIT1, and the Ca2+ release activity was examined by addition of various concentrations of IP3. We found that wild-type GIT1 reduced Ca2+ release in response to low concentrations of IP3 (2–200 nm), which were in the range of physiological concentrations (22Luzzi V. Sims C.E. Soughayer J.S. Allbritton N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28657-28662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), whereas the L712A point mutant GIT1 markedly attenuated the ability to suppress Ca2+ release (Figs. 4, A and B). These results suggest that the GIT-IP3R interaction suppresses the channel activity of IP3R by reducing the apparent sensitivity of the channel to IP3. To investigate whether GIT also modulates IP3-gated Ca2+ release in intact cells, we imaged Ca2+ signals of HeLa cells expressing mRFP-fused wild-type or mutant GIT1, or mRFP alone in response to 3.0 μm ATP stimulation in an extracellular Ca2+-free medium. Whereas the Ca2+ response of cells expressing mRFP or mRFP-L712A was indistinguishable from that of non-expressing cells, cells expressing mRFP-GIT1 typically exhibited significantly smaller Ca2+ transients (Fig. 4, C and D). The difference in Ca2+ transients in cells expressing mRFP-GIT1 was not due to a decrease in Ca2+ store size within the ER because the amount of passive Ca2+ leakage elicited by TG was unchanged (Fig. 4, E and F). We also observed a similar effect of GIT1 overexpression on IP3-induced Ca2+ release in COS-7 cells (Fig. 4, G–J). Hence, we conclude that GIT generally inhibits the IP3-gated Ca2+ release in intact cells. Next, we used the RNA interference technique to examine the effect of endogenous GIT on IP3R channel activity. Because there are no suitable antibodies that specifically recognize GIT2 because of the high homology between GIT1 and GIT2 (13Hoefen R.J. Berk B.C. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1469-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), we used a pan-GIT antibody that almost equally recognizes GIT1 and GIT2 to detect the effect of knockdown of GIT2 in comparison with that of GIT1 (Fig. 5A). We found that GIT1 was robustly expressed in HeLa cells and was efficiently knocked down by GIT1 siRNA. The pan-GIT antibody did not detect any bands in the HeLa cell lysates treated with GIT1 siRNA (Fig. 5B), indicating that GIT2 expression was very low and under detection levels. Alternatively, in COS-7 cells, both GIT1 and GIT2 were robustly expressed and efficiently knocked down by GIT1 and GIT2 siRNA, respectively (Fig. 5C). The expression of all three IP3R subtypes was not affected by any of the siRNAs (Fig. 5, B and C). Therefore, we investigated the effects of GIT1 knockdown in HeLa cells and GIT1 and/or GIT2 knockdown in COS-7 cells on the IP3R Ca2+ release activity. The siRNA-transfected HeLa cells were consecutively stimulated with 0.3, 1.0, and 10 μm ATP in the presence of 2 mm extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 5D). We found that the knockdown of GIT1 in HeLa cells resulted in more cells showing discernible Ca2+ responses to the low ATP concentration (0.3 and 1.0 μm) (Fig. 5E). The average Ca2+ response (AUC) was greater in the GIT1 siRNA-transfected cells than in control cells at all ATP concentrations (Fig. 5H). Furthermore, when GIT1 was knocked down, more cells responded with Ca2+ oscillations and fewer cells responded with Ca2+ spikes to all ATP concentrations (Fig. 5, F and G). The knockdown of GIT1 in HeLa cells had no effect on the level of IP3 production and the Ca2+ leakage induced by TG (data not shown). These data imply that the knockdown of GIT1, the predominantly expressed form of GIT, in HeLa cells led to more intracellular Ca2+ oscillations and amplified IP3R channel Ca2+ release activity. In COS-7 cells, on the other hand, we found that both single knockdown of either GIT1 or GIT2 and double knockdown of GIT1 and GIT2 significantly amplify intracellular Ca2+ oscillations and IP3R Ca2+ release activity (Fig. 5, J–M). These findings demonstrate that knockdown of GIT proteins generally amplifies intracellular Ca2+ oscillations and IP3R Ca2+ release activity. We noticed that many cells transfected with GIT siRNAs died, and therefore we examined whether apoptosis occurred in these cells. The GIT1 siRNA-transfected HeLa cells showed a significantly increased number of TUNEL-positive cells as compared with non-siRNA and control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 6, A and C). The increased number of TUNEL-positive cells was abolished by preincubation with Z-VAD-fmk, a pan-inhibitor for caspases (Fig. 6, B and C), confirming the involvement of caspase activation in GIT1 siRNA-transfected cells. Cleaved caspase-9 and caspase-3 were consistently detected only in cells transfected with GIT1 siRNA (Fig. 6D, lane 3); Z-VAD-fmk efficiently blocked the activation of these two caspases (Fig. 6D, lane 6). It is known that apoptosis-inducible stimuli, such as STS (23Szalai G. Krishnamurthy R. Hajnóczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6349-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 24Nutt L.K. Chandra J.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2690-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), can induce IP3R Ca2+ release. We therefore examined the effect of GIT knockdown on STS-stimulated apoptosis to further investigate the role of GIT in apoptosis. Forty-eight hours after transfection with GIT1 siRNA, we treated the HeLa cells with 1 μm STS for 4 h and examined the number of apoptotic cells. We observed a significant increase in TUNEL-positive cells among the GIT1 siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 6, E and G). STS-stimulated apoptosis in the GIT1 siRNA-transfected cells was abolished by Z-VAD-fmk treatment (Fig. 6, F and G). In addition, Western blot analysis revealed the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 only in GIT1 siRNA-transfected cells that were treated with STS for 4 h (Fig. 6H, lane 9). Although the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 was detected even in control cells after STS treatment for 8 h (Fig. 6H, lanes 13–15), it was much stronger in cells transfected with GIT1 siRNA (Fig. 6H, lane 15). Activated caspase-9 and caspase-3 were not detected when the cells were pretreated with Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 6H, lanes 12 and 16–18). Altogether, these data demonstrate that GIT has a critical role in protection against caspase-dependent apoptosis. We then examined the effect of overexpression of the wild-type or L712A-mutant GIT on apoptosis in GIT1 siRNA-transfected HeLa cells to verify whether GIT inhibits apoptosis by modulating IP3R channel activity. We found that the overexpression of mRFP-GIT1 attenuated the acceleration of apoptosis in GIT1 siRNA-transfected cells induced by STS treatment for both 4 (Fig. 7A, lane 11) and 8 h (Fig. 7A, lane 17). In contrast, overexpression of mRFP-L712A abolished the attenuating effect: apoptosis observed in cells expressing mRFP-L712A (Fig. 7A, lanes 12 and 18) was similar in cells expressing mRFP alone (Fig. 7A, lanes 10 and 16). We also found that apoptosis in the control HeLa cells, triggered by 8 h STS treatment, was attenuated by the wild-type and not the mutant form of GIT1 (Fig. 7A, lanes 13–15). Furthermore, application of 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (Fig. 7B, lane 4) and xestospongin C (Fig. 7B, lane 5), two pharmacological inhibitors of IP3R, inhibited the acceleration of apoptosis in GIT1 siRNA-transfected cells. Altogether, we conclude that the inhibitory effect of GIT on caspase-dependent apoptosis is caused by the modulation of cytosolic Ca2+ dynamics achieved by the control of IP3R channel Ca2+ release activity through direct GIT-IP3R interaction. Here, we found that GIT functions as an anti-apoptotic modulator by inhibiting IP3R activity. Based on the following two observations, we conclude that GIT presumably inhibits channel activity by elevating the threshold of the IP3 concentration necessary for gating of the channel. First, purified GIT1 reduced IP3R channel activity in vitro in response to a low concentration of IP3 (Fig. 4, A and B). Second, knockdown of both GIT proteins resulted in more cells responding to a lower but not to a higher concentration of the IP3-generating agonist without a change in the level of IP3 production (Fig. 5, D–M; data not shown). Based on these data, we propose a model by which GIT regulates apoptosis through IP3R (Fig. 7, C–E). In resting cells, in which the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration is low (∼10−7 m), relatively small amounts of GIT bind to IP3R with low affinity and desensitize IP3R to IP3 that may exist in unstimulated cells, thereby inhibiting the opening of IP3Rs (Fig. 7C). When the cells are stimulated and the IP3 concentration rises, IP3R binds to IP3 and releases Ca2+ from the ER (Fig. 7D). Subsequently, the elevated cytosolic Ca2+ concentration enhances GIT-IP3R association, which in turn inhibits IP3R channel activity as a negative feedback (Fig. 7E), thereby inhibiting the elevation of excessive cytosolic Ca2+ and preventing the activation of the caspase cascade. Interestingly, several key regulators of apoptotic signaling, such as cytochrome c (9Boehning D. Patterson R.L. Sedaghat L. Glebova N.O. Kurosaki T. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1051-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), Bcl-2 (10Chen R. Valencia I. Zhong F. McColl K.S. Roderick H.L. Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Conway S.J. Holmes A.B.

Together with previous findings that cysteine mutation within the CTT (3Uchida K. Miyauchi H. Furuichi T. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16551-16560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) or deletion of the coiled-coil domain from the CTT (27Schug Z.T. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24431-24440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) impairs channel activity, the CTT of IP3R, by itself and with accessory proteins, plays a critical role in regulating IP3R channel opening. Because the CTT is reported to contribute to IP3R tetramer stability (27Schug Z.T. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24431-24440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), it would be interesting to study the relationship between the effect of accessory proteins on structural changes of IP3R and the channel activity. Why does GIT knockdown increase the number of cells showing Ca2+ oscillations in cells (Fig. 5, D, F, I, and K)? One possible explanation is the affinity of GIT for each IP3R subtype. Previous studies have found that each IP3R subtype has different biophysical properties; for example, IP3R1 and IP3R2 tend to generate Ca2+ oscillations, whereas IP3R3 acts as an anti-Ca2+ oscillatory unit in HeLa and COS-7 cells (28Hattori M. Suzuki A.Z. Higo T. Miyauchi H. Michikawa T. Nakamura T. Inoue T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11967-11975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). IP3R2 is required for long-lasting regular Ca2+ oscillations, whereas IP3R3 generates only monophasic Ca2+ responses in DT40 cells (29Miyakawa T. Maeda A. Yamazawa T. Hirose K. Kurosaki T. Iino M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Kuroda et al. (30Kuroda Y. Hisatsune C. Nakamura T. Matsuo K. Mikoshiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8643-8648Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that IP3R2 contributes to Ca2+ oscillation in osteoclasts, using IP3R knock-out mice. Although we should regard these results with caution because of the presence of so many regulatory factors of IP3R activity in vivo (for example, Ca2+, IP3, ATP, accessory proteins, and IP3R localization), these papers suggest that both IP3R2 and IP3R1, particularly IP3R2, generally contribute to the generation of Ca2+ oscillations in vivo. Judging from our data showing that GIT seems to bind to IP3R2 and IP3R1 with higher affinity compared with IP3R3 in vivo (Figs. 1, F and G, and 2A), GIT may predominantly inhibit IP3R1 and IP3R2 that contribute to the generation of Ca2+ oscillations in HeLa and COS-7 cells. Thus, GIT knockdown would increase the number of cells showing Ca2+ oscillations. The precise mechanism by which Ca2+ enhances the GIT-IP3R interaction (Fig. 3) is still unknown, although conformational changes in IP3R and/or GIT may underlie this Ca2+-dependent interaction. It was demonstrated that the NH2-terminal IP3 binding region, which was shown to bind to the S4–S5 linker near the CTT (27Schug Z.T. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24431-24440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), relocates from the corners of the square form to the corners of the radial wings of the windmill form in the presence of Ca2+ (21Hamada K. Miyata T. Mayanagi K. Hirota J. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21115-21118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This Ca2+-dependent spatial rearrangement of the NH2- and COOH-terminal regions of IP3R may at least in part facilitate the accessibility of GIT to the CTT of IP3R. Alternatively, Ca2+ may change the conformation of GIT. Because GIT has an IQ-like motif critical for IP3R binding (Fig. 2, F–I) and some interactions between proteins containing IQ-like motifs and their partners can be regulated by Ca2+ (31Bähler M. Rhoads A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), the putative Ca2+-binding EF-hand of GIT (Fig. 1B) might be responsible for the Ca2+-dependent GIT-IP3R interaction. Further studies on the structural and biochemical regulation of GIT and IP3R by Ca2+ will be necessary to elucidate the precise mode of their Ca2+-dependent interaction. Our data will shed light on the diverse physiological and pathological significance of GIT-dependent apoptotic processes in the future because apoptosis is not only essential for normal tissue development and homeostasis but also contributes to many forms of pathological cell loss. For example, the COOH-terminal fragment of GIT1, which was shown to bind to IP3R in this study, has been found in Huntington disease but not in the healthy brain (32Goehler H. Lalowski M. Stelzl U.

https://openalex.org/W2108843170,"Advances in mass spectrometry among other technologies have allowed for quantitative, reproducible, proteome-wide measurements of levels of phosphorylation as signals propagate through complex networks in response to external stimuli under different conditions. However, computational approaches to infer elements of the signaling network strictly from the quantitative aspects of proteomics data are not well established. We considered a method using the principle of maximum entropy to infer a network of interacting phosphotyrosine sites from pairwise correlations in a mass spectrometry data set and derive a phosphorylation-dependent interaction network solely from quantitative proteomics data. We first investigated the applicability of this approach by using a simulation of a model biochemical signaling network whose dynamics are governed by a large set of coupled differential equations. We found that in a simulated signaling system, the method detects interactions with significant accuracy. We then analyzed a growth factor mediated signaling network in a human mammary epithelial cell line that we inferred from mass spectrometry data and observe a biologically interpretable, small-world structure of signaling nodes, as well as a catalog of predictions regarding the interactions among previously uncharacterized phosphotyrosine sites. For example, the calculation places a recently identified tumor suppressor pathway through ARHGEF7 and Scribble, in the context of growth factor signaling. Our findings suggest that maximum entropy derived network models are an important tool for interpreting quantitative proteomics data."
https://openalex.org/W2160521852,"Background Plasmodium falciparum parasitization of erythrocytes causes a substantial increase in the levels of intracellular fatty acids, notably oleic acid. How parasites acquire this monounsaturated fatty acid has remained enigmatic. Here, we report on the biochemical and enzymatic characterization of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) in P. falciparum. Methodology/Principal Findings Metabolic labeling experiments allowed us to demonstrate the production of oleic acid from stearic acid both in lysates of parasites incubated with [14C]-stearoyl-CoA and in parasite-infected erythrocytes labeled with [14C]-stearic acid. Optimal SCD activity was detected in schizonts, the stage of maximal membrane synthesis. This activity correlated with a late trophozoite stage-specific induction of PFE0555w transcripts. PFE0555w harbors a typical SCD signature. Similar to mammalian SCDs, this protein was found to be associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, as determined with PFE0555w-GFP tagged transgenic P. falciparum. Importantly, these parasites exhibited increased rates of stearic to oleic acid conversion, providing additional evidence that PFE0555w encodes the plasmodial SCD (PfSCD). These findings prompted us to assess the activity of sterculic acid analogues, known to be specific Δ9-desaturase inhibitors. Methyl sterculate inhibited the synthesis of oleic acid both with parasite lysates and infected erythrocytes, most likely by targeting PfSCD. This compound exhibited significant, rapid and irreversible antimalarial activity against asexual blood stages. This parasiticidal effect was antagonized by oleic acid. Conclusion/Significance Our study provides evidence that parasite-mediated fatty acid modification is important for blood-stage survival and provides a new strategy to develop a novel antimalarial therapeutic based on the inhibition of PfSCD."
https://openalex.org/W2111375449,"Peptide libraries or antigenic determinants can be displayed on the surface of bacteria through insertion in a suitable outer membrane scaffold protein. Here, we inserted the well-known antibody epitopes 3xFLAG and 2xmyc in exterior loops of the transmembrane (TM) domain of OmpA. Although these highly charged epitopes were successfully displayed on the cell surface, their levels were 10-fold reduced due to degradation. We verified that the degradation was not caused by the absence of the C-terminal domain of OmpA. In contrast, a peptide that was only moderately charged (SA-1) appeared to be stably incorporated in the outer membrane at normal protein levels. Together, these results suggest that the display efficiency is sensitive to the charge of the inserted epitopes. In addition, the high-level expression of OmpA variants with surface-displayed epitopes adversely affected growth in a strain dependent, transient manner. In a MC4100 derived strain growth was affected, whereas in MC1061 derived strains growth was unaffected. Finally, results obtained using a gel-shift assay to monitor beta-barrel folding in vivo show that the insertion of small epitopes can change the heat modifiability of the OmpA TM domain from 'aberrant' to normal, and predict that some beta-barrels will not display any significant heat-modifiability at all."
https://openalex.org/W1987486570,"Post-translational stabilization of β-catenin is a key step in Wnt signaling, but the features of β-catenin required for stabilization are incompletely understood. We show that forms of β-catenin lacking the unstructured C-terminal domain (CTD) show faster turnover than full-length or minimally truncated β-catenins. Mutants that exhibit faster turnover show enhanced association with axin in co-transfected cells, and excess CTD polypeptide can compete binding of the β-catenin armadillo (arm) repeat domain to axin in vitro, indicating that the CTD may restrict β-catenin binding to the axin-scaffold complex. Fluorescent resonance energy transmission (FRET) analysis of cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-arm-CTD-yellow fluorescent protein β-catenin reveals that the CTD of β-catenin can become spatially close to the N-terminal arm repeat region of β-catenin. FRET activity is strongly diminished by the coexpression of β-catenin binding partners, indicating that an unliganded groove is absolutely required for an orientation that allows FRET. Amino acids 733–759 are critical for β-catenin FRET activity and stability. These data indicate that an N-terminal orientation of the CTD is required for β-catenin stabilization and suggest a model where the CTD extends toward the N-terminal arm repeats, shielding these repeats from the β-catenin destruction complex. Post-translational stabilization of β-catenin is a key step in Wnt signaling, but the features of β-catenin required for stabilization are incompletely understood.

The protein β-catenin serves two fundamental roles in the formation and maintenance of tissues. At the cell surface, β-catenin binds the cytoplasmic domain of cadherin-type adhesion receptors, allowing cells to engage their neighbors through robust intercellular adhering junctions. In the cytoplasm and nucleus, a cadherin-independent pool of β-catenin interacts with TCF 3The abbreviations used are: TCFT cell factorGSKglycogen synthase kinaseAPCadenomatous polyposis coliFRETfluorescent resonance energy transmissionarmarmadillo repeat domainGSTglutathione S-transferaseICATinhibitor of catenin and TCFCTDC-terminal domainCBDcatenin binding domainCFPcyan fluorescent proteinYFPyellow fluorescent proteinGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. -type transcription factors to activate genes that produce cells with distinct identities. The abundance of this cytosolic/nuclear pool of β-catenin is largely determined by the presence of extracellular Wnt factors, which initiate a signaling cascade that prevents the continual destruction of cadherin-free β-catenin.

The destruction of β-catenin is carried out by a highly coordinated series of phosphorylation events. In the absence of Wnt, the N terminus of β-catenin is sequentially phosphorylated by casein kinase 1α and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) (1Liu C. Li Y. Semenov M. Han C. Baeg G.H. Tan Y.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1443-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK at residues serine 33 and 37 allows recognition by the E3-ligase component βTrCP, which when part of the SCFβTrCP complex, catalyzes the ubiquitylation and rapid degradation of β-catenin (3Hart M. Concordet J.P. Lassot I. Albert I. del los Santos R. Durand H. Perret C. Rubinfeld B. Margottin F. Benarous R. Polakis P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 207-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation-dependent degradation of β-catenin depends on the scaffold protein, axin, and the tumor suppressor APC. Axin has binding sites for casein kinase 1α, GSK3β, β-catenin, and APC, so that phosphorylation of axin by casein kinase 1α and GSK3β increases binding to β-catenin (4Jho E. Lomvardas S.

Because phospho-APC binds to β-catenin with higher affinity than phospho-axin, it is thought that ordered phosphorylations within the axin-APC complex may control the flow of β-catenin through this complex (10Xing Y. Clements W.K. Kimelman D. Xu W. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2753-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 11Ha N.C. Tonozuka T. Stamos J.L. Choi H.J. Weis W.I. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Once β-catenin is bound to APC, APC ensures targeting of N-terminal-phosphorylated β-catenin (Ser(P)-33 and Ser(P)-37) to the proteasome by protecting this βTrCP recognition epitope from the phosphatase PP2A (13Su Y.

Understanding how β-catenin moves through the axin-APC-scaffold destruction complex requires an appreciation of β-catenin structure. β-Catenin belongs to the armadillo family of proteins, which are characterized by a central domain consisting of a repeating 42-amino acid motif, termed the “arm repeat” (14Riggleman B. Wieschaus E. Schedl P. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic analysis of the β-catenin central armadillo domain shows that its 12 arm repeats form a superhelix of helices that create a long positively charged groove (15Huber A.H. Nelson W.J. Weis W.I. Cell. 1997; 90: 871-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these positive charges are critical for β-catenin binding to many of its negatively charged unstructured ligands such as the cadherin adhesion receptor, axin and APC degradation machinery components, or TCF-DNA binding factors (10Xing Y.

Phosphorylation of these binding partners introduces additional negative charges that enhance interactions with the positively charged groove of β-catenin, thereby increasing binding affinity (10Xing Y.

Thus, the extent to which β-catenin is used in adhesive or nuclear signaling complexes will critically depend on the phosphorylation state of these major β-catenin ligands (for review, see Ref. 20Daugherty R.L. Gottardi C.J. Physiology. 2007; 22: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). During Wnt activation, GSK3β activity is locally inhibited within the axin complex (21Cselenyi C.S.

PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4926Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), allowing β-catenin to escape this phosphorylation-dependent degradation mechanism and accumulate in both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments (24Peifer M. Sweeton D. Casey M. Wieschaus E. Development. 1994; 120: 369-380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the accumulation of β-catenin is not sufficient for signaling (25Guger K.A. Gumbiner B.M. Dev. Biol. 2000; 223: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 26Staal F.J. Noort Mv M. Strous G.J. Clevers H.C. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), it is a key feature of Wnt activation. Given the number and variety of components that can impact β-catenin signaling at the level of the axin-scaffold phospho-destruction complex (for review, see Ref. 20Daugherty R.L. Gottardi C.J. Physiology. 2007; 22: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), knowing the intrinsic stabilizing features of β-catenin will be important for understanding how these various factors cross-regulate β-catenin signaling. A previous study found that forms of β-catenin lacking the C-terminal domain (CTD) failed to accumulate in flies, even during Wnt signaling (27Cox R.T. Pai L.M. Kirkpatrick C. Stein J. Peifer M. Genetics. 1999; 153: 319-332PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that the CTD negatively impacts β-catenin binding to axin and APC using the isothermal titration calorimetry method (19Choi H.J. Huber A.H. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1027-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), but how the CTD restricts β-catenin binding to axin has remained unresolved. Although the CTD plays an established role in recruiting factors required for gene expression, most interaction partners depend on the more proximal, structured elements of this region, such as helix C, which directly follows the 12th arm repeat (28Sierra J. Yoshida T. Joazeiro C.A. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 586-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 29Xing Y. Takemaru K. Liu J. Berndt J.D. Zheng J.J. Moon R.T. Xu W. Structure. 2008; 16: 478-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Functions for the more distal, unstructured region of the CTD remain poorly defined despite its contribution to β-catenin nuclear signaling (27Cox R.T. Pai L.M. Kirkpatrick C. Stein J. Peifer M. Genetics. 1999; 153: 319-332PubMed Google Scholar). The following study demonstrates that the CTD is required for the accumulation of β-catenin through shielding β-catenin from the axin-scaffold phospho-destruction complex. YFP cDNA was amplified by PCR from pEYFP vector (Clontech) and subcloned into BamHI and XbaI restriction sites of pECFP-C1 (Clontech) vector to generate pECFP-EYFP plasmid. β-Catenin fragments were amplified by PCR and cloned into XhoI and BamHI restriction sites of the pECFP-EYFP plasmid. Coding sequences of β-catenin amino acids 140–663 and ICAT were fused using PCR and also cloned into the XhoI and BamHI restriction sites of pECFP-EYFP. The coding sequence of peptide linker GGGGSGGGGS or PPPPPPPPPP was introduced into overlapping primer regions between β-catenin and ICAT. N-terminal FLAG-tagged full-length β-catenin and S33YD695 were kind gifts of Dr. Eric Fearon (University of Michigan). FLAG-tagged β-catenin truncations were amplified from FLAG-tagged full-length β-catenin constructs and cloned into pCDNA 3 vector (Invitrogen). β-Catenin amino acids 663–666 were changed to 4 prolines using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). To introduce alanine mutations into β-catenin residues 733–759 and 760–773, corresponding DNA sequences for the alanine stretches were synthesized (IDT), annealed in vitro, and PCR-fused into β-catenin fragments. Coding sequence of β-catenin armadillo repeats (amino acids 140–663) was amplified by PCR and inserted into BamHI and XbaI restriction sites of pm vector (Clontech). Coding sequences of β-catenin CTD (amino acids 664–781) and ICAT were also amplified using PCR and cloned into BamHI and XbaI restriction sites of pVP16 vector (Clontech). The coding sequence of β-catenin amino acids 520–781 was PCR-amplified and inserted into HindIII and XbaI restriction sites of p3xFLAG-CMV-10 vector (Sigma). pCS2+ Myc-Zebrafish β-catenin 1 (zβ-cat-1) and pCS2+ MycZebrafish β-catenin 2 (zβ-cat-2) plasmids are described in Bellipanni et al. (30Bellipanni G. Varga M. Maegawa S. Imai Y. Kelly C. Myers A.P. Chu F. Talbot W.S. Weinberg E.S. Development. 2006; 133: 1299-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). GST-ICAT, FLAG-ICAT, and Myc-Xenopus C-cadherin cyto-domain are described in Gottardi et al. (31Gottardi C.J. Gumbiner B.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2004; 286: C747-CC756Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). GST-axin-catenin binding domain (CBD) (amino acids 436–498) and His-β59 (β-catenin arm repeats 1∼12) were kindly provided by William Weis (Stanford University), and GST-β-catenin CTD (amino acids 695∼781) was provided by García de Herreros (Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona). GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL-21 cells (GE Healthcare) and purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads 4B (GE Healthcare) according to standard methods. The following antibodies were used for Western blots: mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (Sigma, F3165), mouse monoclonal anti-β-catenin clone 14 (BD Transduction Laboratories), rabbit polyclonal anti-GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-25778), mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc clone 9E10 (Sigma), anti-RGS-His (Qiagen), rabbit polyclonal anti-ICAT (31Gottardi C.J. Gumbiner B.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2004; 286: C747-CC756Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and goat anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, and rabbit anti-goat IgG-horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad). Cells were lysed in standard 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris pH 7.5, 1%Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). For immunoprecipitation and affinity precipitations, protein samples were incubated with a 1:200 ratio of specific antibody or GST fusion proteins for 2 h at 4 °C followed by 4 washes in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer, one wash in 0.1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (same composition as 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer except with 0.1% Triton X-100), and denatured by heating in SDS protein loading buffer. Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted. Immunoblots were developed in ECL solution (GE Healthcare) and exposed to Hyperfilm-ECL (GE Healthcare). 1 × 106 cells per well of HEK293T cells were seeded into 6-well dishes and transiently transfected with 1.0 μg of various FLAG-tagged β-catenin constructs. 24 h after transfection, cells were split into equal parts and cultured another 24 h before treatment with 20 μg/ml cycloheximide. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline at 0-, 1-, 2-, 4- and 6-h time points and lysed in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer. Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford assay. Equivalent protein amounts were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE. Western blots were performed using anti-FLAG and anti-GAPDH antibody. ECL Western blot films were scanned, and ImageJ software was used for quantification. Thresholds were set to eliminate the background, and the integrated densities were calculated. Ectopic expressed β-catenin levels obtained from anti-FLAG immunoblots were normalized to GAPDH levels obtained from the same blot re-probed with anti-GAPDH antibody. Protein levels at different time points were normalized to the 0-h time points, and protein turnover rates were shown in percentage remaining relative to the 0-h time points. Experiments were performed at least three times, and the final results were shown as the mean ± S.D. For [35S]methionine/cysteine metabolic labeling and pulse-chase experiments, transiently transfected Cos-7 cells were incubated in methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 30 min at 37 °C and subsequently labeled with 0.1mCi/ml PerkinElmer Life Sciences protein labeling mix (NEG772007MC) for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer at various time points, and equal amounts of proteins were incubated with 10 μg of GST-ICAT for 2 h at 4 °C. Sepharose beads were washed 4 times with 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer and once with 0.1% Triton X-100 buffer and boiled in SDS protein loading buffer. Protein samples were separated on SDS-PAGE, dried, and subjected to autoradiography and phosphorimage analysis (FujiFilm FLA-5100 Imager). Cos7 cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells per well and transfected accordingly. After 36 h, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in phosphate-free labeling media for 30 min. Cells were then labeled with 120 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 2 ml of labeling media for 3 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline twice, and lysed in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitations were performed using anti-FLAG antibody, separated on Criterion pre-cast gels (Bio-Rad), and subjected to autoradiography. Western blot was performed on ⅓ of each sample to confirm immunoprecipitation efficiency. A mammalian two-hybrid assay was performed in HEK293T cells according to Mammalian Matchmaker Two-hybrid Assay kit (Clontech) manual. Briefly, 0.1 μg of pM-arm (amino acid 140–663) and 0.1 μg of pVP16-CTD were co-transfected together with 0.3 μg GAL4-Luc reporter and 0.1 μg of Renilla luciferase plasmid. Cells were lysed 36 h after transfection, and luciferase activities were measured on a microplate dual-injector luminometer (Veritas) using the Dual-luciferase Assay kit (Promega). All transfections were performed in triplicate, and data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Cos-7 cells were transfected with the FRET constructs in 3.5-mm glass-bottom dishes (MatTek Corp.). After 48 h, acceptor photobleaching FRET was performed at the Northwestern University Cell Imaging Facility on a Zeiss LSM510 META system (Carl Zeiss Inc.) equipped with a 63 × 1.4 Plan-Apochromat oil-immersion objective. An argon laser was used to excite CFP and YFP at 458-nm wavelength, and emission signals were recorded in META detector λ detection mode. YFP signals of cells were bleached using a 514-nm laser line at 100% power for 100 iterations, and time series images were captured for both before and after bleach. FRET efficiency was calculated using the equation EFRET = ([CFPafter − CFPbefore] × YFPbefore)/([YFPbefore − YFPafter] × CFPafter) to normalize for the amount of YFP bleached, where CFPbefore and YFPbefore are the mean pre-bleach fluorescence intensities of CFP and YFP, respectively, and CFPafter and YFPafter are the mean post-bleach fluorescence intensities of CFP and YFP. Multiple cells from at least three different transfections were measured for each construct. A previous study found that β-catenin lacking its C terminus failed to accumulate in flies (27Cox R.T. Pai L.M. Kirkpatrick C. Stein J. Peifer M. Genetics. 1999; 153: 319-332PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether this reduced accumulation was because of enhanced protein turnover, we generated a panel of truncation mutants (Fig. 1A) and analyzed their half-lives using the cycloheximide chase method. β-Catenin lacking the entire C-terminal region distal to the 12th arm-repeat (amino acids 664–781, Δ664) is degraded more quickly than the full-length protein (Fig. 1, B and C). Similarly, a truncation mutant that retains Helix C (a structured region that “caps” the end of 12th arm repeat) and lacks only the unstructured region of the β-catenin C terminus (29Xing Y. Takemaru K. Liu J. Berndt J.D. Zheng J.J. Moon R.T. Xu W. Structure. 2008; 16: 478-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) displays a turnover rate comparable with the Δ664 mutant (Fig. 1D, Δ695 t½ = ∼2 h). Importantly, the instability of Δ695 can be fully rescued by preventing phosphorylation at serine 33 by GSK3β, which is known to comprise a recognition site for the SCFβ-TrCP ubiquitin ligase (3Hart M. Concordet J.P. Lassot I. Albert I. del los Santos R. Durand H. Perret C. Rubinfeld B. Margottin F. Benarous R. Polakis P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 207-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D; S33Y Δ695). Of note, the turnover of Δ695 is similar to the Δ664 mutant, and S33Y Δ695 is similar to full-length β-catenin. These data suggest that truncating the C terminus does not generate a grossly misfolded protein that is unstable but, rather, indicates that the flexible C-terminal region of β-catenin is intrinsically required for its stabilization. To understand how the C terminus promotes β-catenin stabilization, we first asked whether the C terminus could bind a factor required for β-catenin stability. Although the extreme C terminus of β-catenin contains a highly conserved PDZ binding domain motif, removing this domain had no obvious effects on β-catenin turnover compared with the full-length protein (Fig. 1, B and C). This suggests that the PDZ binding domain motif and its various potential binding partners (32Kanamori M. Sandy P. Marzinotto S. Benetti R. Kai C. Hayashizaki Y. Schneider C. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38758-38764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 33Nishimura W. Yao I. Iida J. Tanaka N. Hata Y. J.

Commun. 2000; 270: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) are dispensable for β-catenin stabilization. To rule out the possibility that other regions of the C terminus interact with a factor required for stabilization (Fig. 1E, schematic), we overexpressed the β-catenin CTD or arm repeats 10–12 and the CTD (arm10CTD) in HEK293T cells and looked for a reduction in the levels of endogenous cytosolic β-catenin. Cytosolic β-catenin can be selectively affinity-precipitated with the β-catenin binding partner, ICAT (GST-ICAT). ICAT is an 81-amino acid polypeptide that binds to the cadherin-free, cytosolic pool of β-catenin and restricts its access to TCFs and transcriptional activators (36Tago K. Nakamura T. Nishita M. Hyodo J. Nagai S. Murata Y. Adachi S. Ohwada S. Morishita Y. Shibuya H. Akiyama T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1741-1749PubMed Google Scholar, 37Daniels D.L. Weis W.I. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 573-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We have previously established that the GST-ICAT precipitable pool of β-catenin corresponds to the Wnt-activated signaling pool typically assessed by standard detergent-free fractionation methods (31Gottardi C.J. Gumbiner B.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2004; 286: C747-CC756Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 38Maher M.T. Flozak A.S. Stocker A.M. Chenn A. Gottardi C.J. J.

As seen in Fig. 1E, neither CTD construct reduced the accumulation of cytosolic β-catenin, as would be predicted if the C terminus sequestered a factor required for β-catenin stabilization. These CTD constructs did not affect base-line cytosolic levels of β-catenin (NaCl, control treated) or “activated” β-catenin using the Wnt pathway agonist and GSK3 inhibitor, lithium chloride (LiCl). Furthermore, overexpression of the C-terminal domain appears insufficient to drive interactions with binding partners that can be discerned by immuno- and affinity-precipitation analyses (supplemental Fig. S1 and Ref. 28Sierra J. Yoshida T. Joazeiro C.A. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 586-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Because the C terminus of β-catenin has been found to bind the central armadillo repeat region of β-catenin in some assays (27Cox R.T. Pai L.M. Kirkpatrick C. Stein J. Peifer M. Genetics. 1999; 153: 319-332PubMed Google Scholar, 39Castaño J. Raurell I. Piedra J.A. Miravet S. Duñach M. García de Herreros A. J. Biol.

Huber A.H. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1027-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), we asked whether the C terminus of β-catenin could antagonize the destruction of β-catenin by directly interacting with the arm repeat region of β-catenin and competing arm-repeat binding to axin. In agreement with previous studies (19Choi H.J. Huber A.H. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1027-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 39Castaño J. Raurell I.

To determine whether this difference in binding is mediated through the flexible C-terminal region of β-catenin, we incubated the arm-repeat region and the GST-axin-CBD in the presence of increasing amounts of the β-catenin CTD (residues 695–781). At high molar excesses, the β-catenin CTD polypeptide can interfere with axin binding to the arm repeat region, whereas an equivalent molar excess of GST protein shows little effect (Fig. 2B). These data raise the possibility that the CTD of β-catenin promotes β-catenin stabilization by directly interfering with the axin/β-catenin binding interaction. In Drosophila the C-terminal region of Armadillo was found to physically interact with the central arm repeat domain in a yeast two-hybrid screen (27Cox R.T. Pai L.M. Kirkpatrick C. Stein J. Peifer M. Genetics. 1999; 153: 319-332PubMed Google Scholar). Because direct “trans” binding between the CTD and arm-repeat domain has been difficult to observe using in vitro binding assays (19Choi H.J. Huber A.H. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1027-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether this interaction could be confirmed using a mammalian two-hybrid assay"

Correspondingly, their null mutants are often difficult to obtain, which impedes subsequent genetic and functional analysis. Here, we describe the development and utility of a theophylline-responsive riboswitch that enables target gene expression to be specifically “tuned” from low to high levels, which may be used to generate conditional hypomorphic mutants. Low levels of gene activity in the absence of the ligand (theophylline) permit cell survival, enabling gene activities to be investigated. Normal gene expression levels and wild-type phenotypes can be restored by the addition of the ligand. We demonstrate the utility of this approach with csrA, an essential gene in Escherichia coli that encodes the global regulatory protein CsrA. We placed the theophylline-responsive riboswitch immediately upstream of the csrA ribosome binding site, with the resulting mutant named switch-csrA. Hypomorphism of switch-csrA and its specific responsiveness to theophylline were verified by phenotypic examination and translation analysis. The utility of switch-csrA revealed a previously unidentified function for CsrA, namely its role as a repressor of cellular autoaggregation. Specifically, switch-csrA in the non-ligand-bound form produced low levels of CsrA, and its cells autoaggregated. Theophylline binding induced conformational changes in the riboswitch and permitted efficient csrA translation; consequently, autoaggregation did not occur. Our results indicate that CsrA modulates autoaggregation via the polysaccharide adhesin poly-β-1,6-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine. In summary, the use of ligand-responsive riboswitches to construct conditional hypomorphic mutants represents a novel approach for investigating the activities of essential genes, which effectively complements traditional genetic approaches.

In summary, the use of ligand-responsive riboswitches to construct conditional hypomorphic mutants represents a novel approach for investigating the activities of essential genes, which effectively complements traditional genetic approaches. In Escherichia coli, at least 620 open reading frames are required for viability in rich growth media (1Gerdes S.Y. Scholle M.D. Campbell J.W. Balázsi G. Ravasz E. Daugherty M.D. Somera A.L. Kyrpides N.C. Anderson I. Gelfand M.S. Bhattacharya A. Kapatral V. D'Souza M. Baev M.V. Grechkin Y. Mseeh F. Fonstein M.Y. Overbeek R. Barabási A.L. Oltvai Z.N. Osterman A.L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5673-5684Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). These essential genes are of particular interest because they play critical roles in basic cellular functions; they are potential components for creating a minimal genome (2Mushegian A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and their mutation provides a promising approach to drug target validation in antibacterial drug discovery. However, genetic studies of essential genes have been impeded by mutation-caused lethality. The effects of overexpressing essential genes may be easily examined, but investigating the effects of lowering their expression levels may be technically difficult to achieve. This problem may be solved by constructing insertional mutants or by deleting a section of the essential genes so that the resulting mutants are partially active in gene functions. However, the construction of such a hypomorphic mutant is not feasible when its integrity is essential for full gene functionality. Alternatively, one can construct conditional lethal amber mutations in essential genes (3Herring C.D. Blattner F.R. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2673-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). With this method, an amber stop codon is introduced into a target gene to construct a nonsense mutation, which results in the production of a truncated protein. A plasmid is used to produce an amber suppressor tRNA, which recognizes the amber stop codon and allows translation to “read through” the codon and produce a full-length protein. However, like the insertion mutation and partial gene deletion discussed above, the amber mutation produces truncated proteins, which are usually non-functional and therefore not ideal for constructing hypomorphic mutations. Another approach is to place the target gene under the control of an inducible promoter (4Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3978) Google Scholar, 5Judson N. Mekalanos J.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 740-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 6Timmermans J. Van Melderen L. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 1722-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) to turn gene expression on and off in response to the presence or absence of promoter inducers, respectively. However, with this method, the wild-type expression levels and the natural transcriptional regulation of the gene can be overridden by the inducible promoter. Here, we have developed a riboswitch-based approach for constructing hypomorphic mutations in essential genes. Our approach has several advantages over previously reported methods, in that the riboswitch-controlled hypomorphic mutants produce full-length functional proteins, the product levels are controlled within a “natural” expression range, and riboswitches enable the specific and reversible control of gene expression in a ligand-dependent manner. To test the feasibility of our methodology, we selected the csrA gene, which is known to be an essential gene in E. coli (6Timmermans J. Van Melderen L. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 1722-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We rationally designed a theophylline-responsive riboswitch with in vivo activity and used this to construct a hypomorphic mutation of csrA (hereafter referred to as switch-csrA). Results from β-galactosidase assays involving csrA-lacZ translational fusions constructed on the chromosome of the switch-csrA strain confirmed that only small amounts of CsrA were expressed in the absence of theophylline, but there were nearly wild type gene expression levels in the presence of the ligand. Examination of cell motility on semisolid agar further validated the riboswitch-controlled hypomorphy of csrA. In addition to controlling the csrA hypomorphic mutation, the use of the artificial riboswitch enabled us to identify a new function for the CsrA protein, namely that it acts as a repressor of cellular autoaggregation (AG). 3The abbreviations used are: AGautoaggregationPGApoly-β-1,6-N-acetyl-d-glucosamineRBSribosome binding sitesncRNAsmall noncoding RNAUTRuntranslated regioncmchloramphenicolkankanamycin. Analogously, the overproduction of the CsrB small non-coding RNA (sncRNA), which is an antagonist of CsrA, induced AG similar to that observed for the riboswitch-controlled hypomorphic mutant of csrA. Our results further indicate that CsrA mediates its effects upon AG by regulating the biosynthesis of the biofilm adhesin poly-β-1,6-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (PGA). Thereby, we demonstrate that ligand-responsive riboswitches can be effectively used to complement traditional approaches for investigating gene functions when null mutations are lethal. autoaggregation poly-β-1,6-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine ribosome binding site small noncoding RNA untranslated region chloramphenicol kanamycin.

The PCR product and pET32a(+) expression vector (Novagen) were co-transformed into E. coli DY330 that had previously been induced for λred recombination functions (7Yu D. Ellis H.M. Lee E.C.

Recombinants were selected for chloramphenicol resistance and verified by PCR and sequencing. The native promoter drove CsrB overproduction in MG1655 (without requiring induction). Primers used for csrB cloning are listed in Table 2. Total RNA was isolated from overnight cultures in LB medium. Subsequently, 2 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed in a total reaction volume of 20 μl. Each reaction was incubated at 55 °C for 50 min, followed by 15 min at 70 °C. 2 μl of the resulting reverse transcript products (cDNA) were then used for 22, 24, 26, 28, and 30 rounds of PCR (30 s each at 94, 55, and 72 °C) with Ex TaqDNA polymerase (Takara Bio Inc.) and primers complementary to csrB (RT-CsrB-F, 5′-GTCAGACAACGAAGTGAACATCAGG-3′; RT-CsrB-R, 5′-GGAGCACTGTATTCACAGCGCT-3′) and the 16 S rRNA gene (RT-16S-F, 5′-CTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3′; RT-16S-R, 5′-CTCCGTATTACCGCGGCTG-3′) to co-amplify the gene of interest and the internal control. PCR products were separated in 1.5% agarose gel. The loxP-cm-loxP-selectable cassette was inserted immediately after the stop codon of the lacZ gene on the MG1655 chromosome using λred recombination (as described above). Next, the lacZ-loxP-cm-loxP cassette was PCR-amplified and inserted (in frame) immediately prior to the stop codon of the target gene on the chromosome. The inserted lacZ fragment started from the eighth codon of the lacZ gene and was co-transcribed and translated with the fused genes. The expression of gene-lacZ fusions was quantified using a β-galactosidase assay, as described previously (9Jin Y. Watt R.M. Danchin A. Huang J.D. BMC Genomics. 2009; 10: 165Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In all of the lacZ fusion constructs used in this study, the endogeneous lacZ gene was not deleted. Our pilot studies showed that the endogeneous lacZ levels were extremely low, and therefore its presence did not affect our lacZ fusion results. Primers used to construct the lacZ fusions are listed in Table 2. Overnight cultures were diluted 1:200 and incubated at 37 °C, with shaking at 220 rpm, in liquid LB medium. When cells aggregated (visualized macroscopically by the clumping or “fluffing” of cells in liquid cultures), 100 μl of each cell suspension was transferred to flat-bottom 96-well plates (Iwaki, Tokyo, Japan), and the images of the cell aggregates were captured by scanning. To better visualize the cell aggregates, 1 μl of crystal violet (0.1%) was added to each cell suspension (100 μl) immediately prior to image capture. Overnight cultures in LB medium were used to assay cell motility. 2 μl of the bacterial suspensions were placed onto the centers of the motility plates (LB medium containing 0.3% agar). Plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 16–20 h. Motility was assessed by examining the colony sizes on the semisolid agar medium. Paired t tests were used to compare the two means obtained from β-galactosidase assays; one-way ANOVA was used for the comparison of multiple means. p values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. It has previously been reported that csrA is required for the growth of the E. coli DJ624 strain (a MG1655 derivative, lacX74 malP::lacIq) in LB medium (6Timmermans J. Van Melderen L. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 1722-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To determine whether the csrA gene was also essential in E. coli K-12 MG1655, extensive attempts were made to delete this gene in this strain. No csrA null mutants could be successfully constructed in LB, although a large number of recombineering experiments were performed. This indicated that the csrA gene was essential for the viability of E. coli MG1655 under the conditions used. We therefore selected the csrA gene for the development of a riboswitch-controlled conditional hypomorphic mutation, to investigate whether this approach could be used to facilitate the genetic study of essential genes. To construct such a hypomorphic mutation, we sought to rationally design a ligand-responsive riboswitch that would have the ability to modulate expression levels when placed immediately upstream of the ribosome binding site (RBS) of the target gene. This riboswitch should meet the following four criteria: (a) the riboswitch should adopt multiple conformations, and those with lower free energy would not permit gene expression, so that the target gene expression would be repressed in the absence of a specific ligand; (b) at least one of these riboswitch conformations would permit limited gene expression, so that the target gene expression would not be entirely “shut off” in the absence of the ligand; (c) the addition of the ligand would favor the formation of the conformation that permits gene expression, so that gene expression could be specifically derepressed by adding the ligand; and (d) in the ligand-bound form, the riboswitch could increase the target gene expression to nearly wild-type levels. Based on these criteria, we designed a theophylline-responsive riboswitch and integrated this directly upstream of the csrA RBS (Fig. 1). The resulting mutant was named switch-csrA. The secondary structures formed by the construct and their free energy were predicted using RNAstructure version 4.6 (10Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 911-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (3232) Google Scholar, 11Mathews D.H. Disney M.D. Childs J.L. Schroeder S.J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 7287-7292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). This cis regulatory element is composed of a theophylline aptamer (12Zimmermann G.R. Wick C.L. Shields T.P. Jenison R.D. Pardi A. RNA. 2000; 6: 659-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 13Win M.N. Smolke C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 14283-14288Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) and a short nucleotide sequence, such that four conformations (A, B, C, and D) coexist at equilibrium. In conformations A and B, the RBS is base-paired, and therefore the gene translation is blocked (14Brunel C. Romby P. Sacerdot C. de Smit M. Graffe M. Dondon J. van Duin J. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Springer M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 15Isaacs F.J. Dwyer D.J. Ding C. Pervouchine D.D. Cantor C.R. Collins J.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). In conformation C, the RBS is immediately adjacent to a stem loop. Consequently, gene expression levels are likely to be low, since it has previously been demonstrated that a stem-loop structure directly beside the RBS interferes with ribosome accessibility (16Suess B. Fink B. Berens C. Stentz R. Hillen W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1610-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In contrast, conformation D, in which the RBS is single-stranded, putatively allows for efficient ribosome binding and gene translation. According to the prediction of free energy using RNAstructure 4.6, conformations A (−21.9 kcal/mol) and B (−21.4 kcal/mol) have relatively lower free energy than conformations C (−21.0 kcal/mol) and D (−20.9 kcal/mol) and therefore are proposed to predominate in the absence of theophylline. Consequently, the overall csrA translation levels would be expected to be low. However, when theophylline binds to the riboswitch, the equilibrium distribution would be shifted to favor the formation of conformations C and D. Increased levels of the conformation D should significantly enhance the expression of csrA. To determine how effectively the riboswitch regulated the expression of CsrA, we constructed a chromosomal csrA-lacZ translational fusion and then integrated the riboswitch device into this construct, forming switch-csrA-lacZ. In the absence of theophylline but in the presence of 5 mm caffeine (serving as a control), switch-csrA-lacZ had significantly lower levels of β-galactosidase activity than csrA-lacZ. When caffeine was replaced with 5 mm theophylline, the levels of β-galactosidase activity in switch-csrA-lacZ increased significantly and were only marginally lower (p > 0.05) than those of the csrA-lacZ translational fusion (Fig. 2). This indicated that the binding of theophylline induced a conformational change in the riboswitch region, “freeing up” the ribosomal binding site for efficient CsrA expression. There were extremely low levels of β-galactosidase activity in the negative control, switch-csrA (which lacks the lacZ fusion), in the presence of either caffeine or theophylline (Fig. 2). This excluded the possibility that the addition of theophylline or caffeine influences (endogenous) lacZ expression levels either in the presence or absence of the riboswitch. Taken together, these results demonstrated that the riboswitch was specifically responsive toward theophylline and that in the absence of this ligand, the riboswitch significantly reduced csrA expression levels. To further validate the ability of the riboswitch to control csrA expression, we examined the motility phenotype of the switch-csrA strain, taking advantage of the fact that CsrA modulates the motility of E. coli cells (17Wei B.L. Brun-Zinkernagel A.M. Simecka J.W. Prüss B.M. Babitzke P. Romeo T. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). We found that switch-csrA cells were immotile in 0.3% semisolid LB agar in the absence of theophylline (Fig. 1). When theophylline was added, the cells regained their motility (Fig. 1), providing additional confirmation that the riboswitch could effectively regulate csrA expression. Interestingly, the switch-csrA cells that contained low levels of CsrA (i.e. grown in the presence of caffeine but without theophylline) flocculated when grown in LB medium (Fig. 3), which is a typical AG phenotype. The switch-csrA cells also autoaggregated when they were incubated in M63 medium containing 0.2% glucose in the absence of theophylline (data not shown). Conversely, the theophylline-treated cells, whose CsrA expression levels were comparable with those of the wild type, did not aggregate (Fig. 3). These results indicate that CsrA acts as a negative regulator of AG. The CsrB sncRNA has previously been demonstrated to antagonize the activities of the CsrA protein by sequestering it (18Liu M.Y. Gui G. Wei B. Preston 3rd, J.F. Oakford L. Yüksel U. Giedroc D.P. Romeo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17502-17510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Thus, CsrB-overproducing E. coli cells have lower levels of CsrA activity. We hypothesized that if AG was repressed by the CsrA protein, then CsrB overproduction would result in AG levels analogous to those observed for the switch-csrA cells (in the absence of theophylline). We cloned CsrB together with its native promoter into a high copy pET vector, forming plasmid pCsrB that constitutively transcribed CsrB in MG1655. reverse transcription-PCR verified that CsrB was abundantly produced in the cells carrying pCsrB, whereas this sncRNA was barely detectable in cells containing an empty vector control (Fig. 4). We observed that the plasmid-encoded CsrB induced AG in the wild-type MG1655 strain in LB (Fig. 3) as well as in M63 medium (data not shown). Thus, reducing intracellular CsrA activities via the overproduction of CsrB results in cellular AG. This supplies additional evidence that the AG phenotype observed for the switch-csrA strain is due to reduced CsrA levels and that CsrA negatively modulates AG. Ag43 (encoded by flu) (19Henderson I.R. Meehan M. Owen P. FEMS Microbiol.

However, we observed that CsrB overexpression driven by its native promoter conferred AG to a flu mutant (data not shown). Thus, Ag43 is not required for the AG phenotype discussed in this study. CsrA has been shown to regulate the expression of the glgCAP operon (20Baker C.S. Eöry L.A. Yakhnin H. Mercante J. Romeo T. Babitzke P. J.

Microbiol. 2008; 70: 236-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) at the post-transcriptional level. Of these targets, the pgaABCD operon encodes for proteins involved in the biosynthesis and translocation of the cell-bound polysaccharide PGA, which is a biofilm adhesin. We speculated that this adhesin might be a potential AG-inducing factor that was part of the CsrA-mediated AG pathway. To test this possibility, we first examined the effects that differing levels of CsrA had on the expression of a pga-lacZ translational fusion on the MG1655 chromosome. Overproducing CsrB, which sequesters the CsrA protein, significantly increased the levels of the pga-lacZ fusion (Fig. 5). This is consistent with the previously reported finding that CsrA negatively regulates the biosynthesis of PGA (22Wang X. Dubey A.K. Suzuki K. Baker C.S. Babitzke P. Romeo T. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1648-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). We also used recombineering (which is a homologous recombination-based technique) to accurately integrate a “cm-switch” cassette (comprising a chloramphenicol resistance gene adjacent to the riboswitch) immediately upstream of the RBS of the csrA gene of the mutant carrying the pga-lacZ fusion. The resulting mutant strain contained both the switch-csrA and pga-lacZ fusions, enabling us to examine how the riboswitch regulated the production of PgaAB. As predicted, the switch significantly up-regulated the levels of the pga-lacZ fusion in the absence of theophylline (i.e. in the presence of caffeine), putatively due to repressed csrA expression (Fig. 6). When theophylline was present, the pgaAB expression levels were comparable with those of cells that contained the pga-lacZ fusion but lacked the riboswitch (Fig. 6). Thus, both CsrB-overproducing cells and non-ligand-activated switch-csrA cells, which are both AG-positive, have increased levels of PGA production.FIGURE 6The theophylline-responsive switch in switch-csrA cells controls pga expression. β-Galactosidase levels (relative units) resulting from expression of a chromosomally located pga-lacZ translational fusion were measured for strains where CsrA levels are regulated by a theophylline-responsive riboswitch (pga-lacZ switch-csrA) or are under native control (pga-lacZ). β-Galactosidase activities were normalized to those of the (pga-lacZ) control in the presence of 5 mm caffeine (ca). PGA-LacZ levels were significantly increased in the pga-lacZ switch-csrA strain in the presence of 5 mm caffeine (CsrA repressed) and were relatively unaffected in the presence of 5 mm theophylline (th; CsrA de-repressed). Error bars, S.D. (*, p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then deleted pgaB to disrupt PGA expression in a switch-csrA background. No AG was evident in the pgaB switch-csrA mutant (Fig. 3). The disruption of PGA synthesis also blocked AG in the cells carrying pCsrB (i.e. overexpressing CsrB; Fig. 3). These results suggest that PGA is required for CsrA-mediated AG. Next, we replaced the pgaA 5′-untranslated region (UTR) with a chloramphenicol resistance gene (cat) fragment, in order to constitutively express the genes encoding the PGA biosynthesis and translocation machinery located downstream. The native promoter of the pga operon was left intact. The 5′-UTR of the pgaA mRNA harbors six CsrA-binding sites. By binding to these sites, CsrA represses the translation of the pgaABCD transcript (22Wang X. Dubey A.K. Suzuki K. Baker C.S. Babitzke P. Romeo T. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1648-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Thus, replacing the pgaA leader with the cat gene cassette should “protect” the pga operon against CsrA inhibition, thereby increasing the amounts of PGA biosynthesized. To test whether the hybrid cat-pga strain had increased levels of pgaABCD expression, we inserted the lacZ coding sequence immediately prior to the stop codon of pgaB (in frame) to construct a chromosomally located translational pga-lacZ fusion. β-galactosidase assays verified that replacing the pgaA leader with the cat fragment increased the levels of the pga-lacZ fusions ∼4-fold (Fig. 7). Furthermore, we observed that the hybrid cat-pga strain autoaggregated in liquid culture (Fig. 3), supplying additional evidence supporting the operation of PGA as an AG-promoting factor. Taken together, these results indicate that PGA plays a pivotal role in AG observed with switch-csrA. Here, we report the development of a new approach for making hypomorphic mutations in essential genes and successfully apply it to study the activities of the csrA gene in E. coli. To achieve this, we created a theophylline-responsive riboswitch that could be used to express CsrA at reduced levels within the cell, in a highly reproducible and controllable manner. Using this riboswitch-controlled hypomorphic mutation of csrA, we demonstrate that the CsrA protein negatively mediates AG of E. coli cells. Our results further indicate that PGA plays a pivotal role in the CsrA-mediated AG process. Essential genes encode critical cellular functions and thus tend to be of high scientific interest. However, they are often hard to study genetically, since their deletion is lethal and thus null mutations cannot be constructed. The creation of hypomorphic mutations is an alternative strategy by which the functions of essential genes may be investigated in vivo. Several approaches have been developed for this purpose, but each has its own disadvantages. Insertion mutagenesis, partial gene deletion, and amber mutations can result in the production of truncated proteins. However, a truncated protein may be completely inactive and thus not hypomorphic. There is the additional possibility that the functions of a truncated protein may differ significantly from those of its full-length counterpart. Another approach is to place the essential gene under the control of an inducible promoter (4Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3978) Google Scholar, 5Judson N. Mekalanos J.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 740-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 6Timmermans J. Van Melderen L. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 1722-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but then the native copy number and/or regulation of the gene may be disturbed. Given these considerations, we investigated the feasibility of using a cis-acting inhibitory RNA device to control the expression of essential genes at the translational level, so that the full-length proteins would be produced at reduced levels. The use of a riboswitch-based hypomorphic mutation has the additional benefit of leaving the native promoter intact, thus preserving the natural transcriptional levels and regulation of the target gene. Riboswitches are structured RNAs typically located in the 5′-UTR of bacterial mRNAs, which adopt altered conformations in response to an environmental signal in the form of a metabolite. The conformational changes result in the inhibition or activation of (downstream) target gene expression. Here, we engineered a riboswitch that adopts four putative conformations when inserted immediately upstream of the RBS of the csrA gene. csrA was chosen because it is an essential gene in E. coli K12 (6Timmermans J. Van Melderen L. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 1722-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and is a global regulator controlling a wide variety of biological processes, thus meriting further detailed investigation. In the absence of the theophylline ligand, conformations A and B predominate and interfere with ribosome binding. Only one of the two predicted theophylline-bound conformations (conformation D in Fig. 1) allows for relatively unimpeded csrA expression. Therefore, in the non-ligand-bound form, switch-csrA has low but not zero CsrA levels, whereas theophylline binding increases the csrA expression to nearly wild-type levels. The proposed control of the riboswitch over the downstream csrA expression was verified by csrA-lacZ translational fusions and by examining the cell motility phenotype. Thus, riboswitches, in addition to their more common applications in modular and universal gene regulation, can be used to construct more “subtle” hypomorphic gene mutants. Using our approach, analogous riboswitch-controlled conditional hypomorphic mutations may be constructed for other essential genes, enabling their functions to be dissected. Such riboswitches may be composed of a theophylline aptamer and a short nucleotide sequence, which, together with the RBS region of the essential gene of interest, would form multiple conformations at equilibrium (after transcription). The sequence of the theopylline aptamer would be conserved (12Zimmermann G.R. Wick C.L. Shields T.P. Jenison R.D. Pardi A. RNA. 2000; 6: 659-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 13Win M.N. Smolke C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 14283-14288Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), whereas the composition of short nucleotide sequence would be gene-specific. This short sequence should be designed such that the RBS of the target gene is blocked in the RNA conformations adopted in the absence of theophylline, thus repressing gene translation, but is “freed up” after theophylline binding, facilitating gene expression. It is noteworthy that the riboswitches used for constructing hypomorphic mutations should not completely “shut off” gene expression in the absence of ligand (i.e. when “switched off”), and gene expression levels should be restored to those of the wild-type cells in the presence of ligand (switched on). The switched on cells serve as a perfect control for their hypomorphic switched off counterparts. Notably, our use of the riboswitch-controlled hypomorphic mutation enabled us to identify an important new function of the CsrA protein; it represses AG in E. coli. AG is visualized macroscopically by the clumping or “fluffing” of cells in liquid cultures or by the cells settling (or flocculating) upon standing without agitation. AG is an important virulence factor, since it has been associated with bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation (24Sherlock O. Vejborg R.M. Klemm P. Infect.

These include the autotransporter protein family (19Henderson I.R. Meehan M. Owen P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 149: 115-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Sherlock O. Vejborg R.M. Klemm P.

Schoolnik G.K. Science. 1998; 280: 2114-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). As described earlier, the csrA deletion mutant is not viable, and therefore the regulatory role of CsrA in AG may have been easily overlooked by relying solely on traditional genetic techniques. In contrast, the switch-csrA strain, whose csrA expression was specifically repressed by the theophylline-responsive riboswitch, evidently displayed AG. The addition of theophylline, which increased the CsrA levels in the switch-csrA strain, abolished the AG phenotype. Thus, we demonstrate that riboswitch-controlled hypomorphs can be used to identify gene functions that traditional mutagenesis approaches may be unable to reveal. We thank D. L. Court for providing plasmid pSim6 for the recombineering experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2070575248,"Alternative splicing is regulated by cis sequences in the pre-mRNA that serve as binding sites for trans-acting alternative splicing factors. In a previous study, we used bioinformatics and molecular biology to identify and confirm that the intronic hexamer sequence UCUAUC is a nematode alternative splicing regulatory element. In this study, we used RNA affinity chromatography to identify trans factors that bind to this sequence. HRP-2, the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog of human heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins Q and R, binds to UCUAUC in the context of unc-52 intronic regulatory sequences as well as to RNAs containing tandem repeats of this sequence. The three Us in the hexamer are the most important determinants of this binding specificity. We demonstrate, using RNA interference, that HRP-2 regulates the alternative splicing of two genes, unc-52 and lin-10, both of which have cassette exons flanked by an intronic UCUAUC motif. We propose that HRP-2 is a protein responsible for regulating alternative splicing through binding interactions with the UCUAUC sequence."

The mechanisms of myo1c targeting and anchoring to specific regions on the membrane to support these functions are not well understood.

Laakso J.M. Lin T. Sept D. Ostap E.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4856-4865Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). myo1c also binds soluble inositol phosphates (e.g. inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)) with similar affinity. Point mutations of amino acids known to be essential for phosphoinositide binding in other PH domains inhibit myo1c binding to PtdIns(4,5)P2 in vitro, and these mutations disrupt membrane localization in vivo (13Hokanson D.E.

The affinity of myo1c for PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing membranes is increased by the presence of additional anionic phospholipids in the membrane. This increased affinity may be due to nonspecific electrostatic interactions between the anionic phospholipids and positively charged regions within the myo1c tail or regulatory domain (13Hokanson D.E.

However, high affinity membrane binding via these nonspecific electrostatic interactions (i.e. binding in the absence of PtdIns(4,5)P2) requires the membrane composition to contain a nonphysiological mole fraction (e.g. >40% phosphatidylserine) of anionic phospholipids (13Hokanson D.E.

Determining the kinetics of membrane attachment will provide insight into the relationship between membrane attachment and actin attachment lifetimes and will also provide details about the role of anionic lipids in regulating membrane attachment.

Lemmon (University of Pennsylvania) and has been described previously (19Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. O'Brien R. Sigler P.B. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 10472-10476Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). myo1cIQ-tail was co-expressed with calmodulin in Sf9 cells using a baculovirus expression system and purified as described previously (10Tang N. Lin T. Ostap E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42763-42768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 14Hokanson D.E. Ostap E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 3118-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, insect cells were co-infected with viruses containing the constructs for myo1cIQ-tail and calmodulin. Cells were harvested, lysed in Lysis Buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5% Igepal, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.01 mg/ml aprotinin, and 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin) and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer. Lysed cells were centrifuged, and the supernatant, to which DNase and RNase had been added, was sonicated. Lysate was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) and eluted with 125 mm imidazole. myo1cIQ-tail was further purified using Mono S and Mono Q FPLC columns (Amersham Biosciences). Purified myo1cIQ-tail was dialyzed overnight against HNa100 (10 mm HEPES, pH 7, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm DTT). BL21(DE3)PLysS cells were transformed with PLCδ-PH domain plasmid DNA, and protein was expressed and purified as described (20Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1994; 79: 199-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Cells were lysed in Lysis Buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm d-glucose, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 25 mm MES, pH 6). The lysate was sonicated and centrifuged. Supernatant was loaded onto a DEAE-cellulose (Sigma) column, which was pre-equilibrated with Buffer A (50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 25 mm MES, pH 6). The column was washed with Buffer A plus 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The flow-through, which contained the PLCδ-PH domain, and wash were then loaded onto an SP-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Sigma) pre-equilibrated with Buffer B (Buffer A without NaCl). The SP column was washed, and protein was eluted in Buffer B with a 0–500 mm NaCl gradient. Protein-containing fractions were ammonium sulfate-precipitated. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in labeling buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA) and loaded onto a pre-equilibrated Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (Amersham Biosciences). PLCδ-PH containing fractions were pooled and labeled with 5-fold molar excess of the thiol-reactive dye, 5-((((2-iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)amino)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (IAEDANS), in labeling buffer at room temperature for 6 h. To remove free dye, labeled protein was passed over a G-25 Fine column pre-equilibrated with HNa100. The efficiency of labeling was 80% as calculated assuming ϵ280 = 18,470 m−1 cm−1 for PLCδ-PH and ϵ336 = 5700 m−1 cm−1 for IAEDANS. LUVs were prepared as described previously (14Hokanson D.E. Ostap E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 3118-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, lipids were combined in the molar ratios indicated in Table 1. Solvent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen. For LUVs composed of complex lipid mixtures, solvent was removed in a rotovap following pre-equilibration at 30 °C to ensure a uniform lipid distribution (21Gambhir A. Hangyás-Mihályné G. Zaitseva I.

Dried lipid films were resuspended in HNa100 and briefly vortexed. Lipids underwent five cycles of freeze-thaw before brief bath sonication and 11 passes through 100 nm pore size nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman) in an extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids).TABLE 1Phospholipid composition of LUVsLipid mole fractionLUV radiusaValues were determined from dynamic light scattering measurements.

Open table in a new tab Hydrodynamic radii of LUVs were measured using dynamic light scattering (DLS; Table 1) (Dynamics version 5.26.37). Radii determined by DLS were used to calculate estimated molecular weights (Table 1) of the LUVs as described (22Lu Y. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8193-8200Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). All measurements were performed in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm DTT at 22 ± 0.1 °C. Experiments with myo1cIQ-tail included 1 μm free calmodulin. Association and dissociation transients were acquired using a stopped-flow instrument equipped with removable polarization optics (Applied Photophysics, Spectra Kinetic Work station version 4.54). Light scattering measurements were performed in an L-format with an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and a 320-nm long pass emission filter. A small mixing artifact that was due to light scattering by LUVs was subtracted from transients before fitting. An additional artifact was observed when high concentrations of inositol phosphates (i.e. concentrations >1 mm) were mixed with LUVs. Therefore, in InsP6-induced dissociation experiments, no more than 1 mm InsP6 was used, and a blank acquired in the absence of myo1cIQ-tail at each InsP6 concentration was subtracted from transients. Stopped-flow anisotropy measurements were carried out in a T-format with an excitation wavelength of 336 nm and a 475-nm long pass emission filter. Anisotropy was calculated as described (23Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999Crossref Google Scholar). The rate of myo1cIQ-tail binding to LUVs at each lipid concentration was determined in each experiment by averaging 2–6 individual traces and fitting to a two-exponential function (y = Afast (1 − e−kfast·t) + Aslow (1 − e−kslow·t). Rates reported for each total lipid concentration were from 1 to 4 experiments. A minimum of five lipid concentrations was assayed for each LUV composition, and the final myo1cIQ-tail concentration was 1000-fold below the total lipid concentration. Association transients were acquired under pseudo first-order conditions to obtain apparent second-order rate constants from the slope of a plot of kfast versus lipid concentration. Association rate constants are reported as a function of total lipid (ka-total) or LUV concentration (ka-LUV). Reported uncertainties are the standard errors of the fits. Dissociation rates and amplitudes were obtained by averaging the individual traces from each experiment and fitting to a single exponential function (y = Ad (1 − e−kd·t)). Average rates and standard deviations from multiple experiments (n = 2–7) are reported (Table 2). For experiments that require large quantities of soluble inositol phosphates (Figs. 1 and 4), myo1cIQ-tail-LUV complexes were mixed with InsP6 to induce dissociation. InsP6 and InsP3 bind myo1cIQ-tail with similar affinity (13Hokanson D.E. Laakso J.M. Lin T. Sept D. Ostap E.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4856-4865Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and InsP6 is substantially less expensive than InsP3.TABLE 2myo1cIQ-tail and PLCδ-PH dissociation rate constantsLUV compositionmyo1cIQ-tail kdAEDANS-PLCδ-PH kds−1s−12% PtdIns(4,5)P22.0 ± 0.3 (7)13 ± 0.65 (3)2% PtdIns(4,5)P2 + 1 mm Mg2+5.8 ± 0.1 (2)8% PtdIns(4,5)P20.16 ± 0.020 (3)2% PtdIns(4,5)P2 + 20% DOPS0.087 ± 0.020 (4)6.2 ± 0.070 (2)2% PtdIns(3,4,5)P32.8 ± 1.0 (6)2% PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 + 1 mm Mg2+9.1 ± 5.1 (3)2% PtdIns(4,5)P2 + Lipid Mix0.025 ± 0.0030 (3)8.3 ± 0.72 (2) Open table in a new tab FIGURE 4InsP6-induced dissociation of myo1cIQ-tail from phosphoinositide-containing LUVs. Pre-equilibrated solutions of myo1cIQ-tail and LUVs (50 μm total lipid) were rapidly mixed with 6.3–1000 μm InsP6, and dissociation was measured as a decrease in light scattering. myo1cIQ-tail concentration was 100 nm for 2% PtdIns(4,5)P2 LUVs and 625 nm for all other LUVs. Points are the observed rates, and insets are amplitudes of the transients obtained by fitting to a single exponential function. LUVs were composed of 0.5% PtdIns(4,5)P2 (open symbols) or 2% PtdIns(4,5)P2 (closed symbols) in the absence (top) or presence (bottom) of Lipid Mix (Table 1).

We determined that light scattering linearly reports the concentration of myo1cIQ-tail bound to LUVs by showing that the amplitude change upon dissociation is linearly related to protein concentrations between 58 and 460 nm at 115 μm total lipid concentration (Fig. 1). Transients were difficult to resolve below 58 nm myo1cIQ-tail (data not shown). Steady-state binding experiments show that myo1cIQ-tail does not bind 100% DOPC LUVs (13Hokanson D.E. Laakso J.M. Lin T. Sept D. Ostap E.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4856-4865Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 14Hokanson D.E. Ostap E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 3118-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and control stopped-flow experiments showed no significant transient changes in light scattering when inositol phosphates were mixed with 100 nm myo1cIQ-tail that was pre-equilibrated with 50 μm 100% DOPC LUVs (data not shown). The time course of 100 nm myo1cIQ-tail dissociation from 50 μm 2% PtdIns(4,5)P2 LUVs obtained by mixing with 25 μm InsP3 was best fit with a single exponential function with a rate of kd = 2.0 ± 0.30 s−1 (Fig. 2 and Table 2). The dissociation rate was 8.5-fold faster when the mole percentage of PtdIns(4,5)P2 was decreased to 0.5% (kd = 17 ± 0.38 s−1) and was 12-fold slower when the mole percentage of PtdIns(4,5)P2 was increased to 8% (kd = 0.16 ± 0.020 s−1; Table 2). The dissociation rate decreased 23-fold (kd = 0.087 ± 0.020 s−1) when 20% DOPS was included with 2% PtdIns(4,5)P2 (Fig. 2), and placement of 2% PtdIns(4,5)P2 in a physiological Lipid Mix (24Corbin J.A. Dirkx R.A. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 16161-16173Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) that contained POPS, phosphatidylinositol, POPE, POPC, and sphingomyelin (2% PtdIns(4,5)P2 + Lipid Mix) resulted in an even slower rate of myo1cIQ-tail dissociation (kd = 0.025 ± 0.0030 s−1; Fig. 2). The dramatic decrease in the membrane detachment rate occurs even though myo1cIQ-tail does not bind LUVs composed of <40% DOPS (14Hokanson D.E. Ostap E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 3118-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) or Lipid Mix (data not shown) in the absence of PtdIns(4,5)P2 with an appreciable affinity. myo1cIQ-tail binds LUVs that contain 60% DOPS in the absence of PtdIns(4,5)P2 (10Tang N.

Cell. 2006; 17: 4856-4865Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), but InsP3 does not induce dissociation from these LUVs (data not shown). Taken together, these results support our model for the presence of two membrane-binding sites within the myo1cIQ-tail (13Hokanson D.E. Laakso J.M. Lin T. Sept D. Ostap E.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4856-4865Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 14Hokanson D.E. Ostap E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 3118-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), a phosphoinositide-specific binding site, and a site that binds anionic phospholipids via delocalized electrostatic interactions. We compared the kinetics of myo1cIQ-tail dissociation from 2% PtdIns(4,5)P2 LUVs with the kinetics of the well characterized phospholipase-Cδ PH domain (19Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. O'Brien R.

Cell. 1995; 83: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Dissociation of PLCδ-PH from 2% PtdIns(4,5)P2 LUVs did not result in a large enough light scattering change to be detected in our stopped-flow experiments (data not shown), so we measured changes in fluorescence anisotropy of PLCδ-PH labeled with IAEDANS (AEDANS-PLCδ-PH) upon LUV dissociation. Dissociation of AEDANS-PLCδ-PH from 2% PtdIns(4,5)P2 LUVs followed a single exponential time course (Fig. 3, top) with a rate (13.0 ± 0.65 s−1) that was faster than measured for myo1cIQ-tail (Table 2). Addition of 20% DOPS to 2% PtdIns(4,5)P2 LUVs decreased the dissociation rate 2-fold (6.2 ± 0.070 s−1), and placement of 2% PtdIns(4,5)P2 in a physiological Lipid Mix slowed dissociation only 1.5-fold (8.3 ± 0.72 s−1; Fig. 3 and Table 2). Thus, the effect of additional anionic charge on the AEDANS-PLCδ-PH dissociation rate was substantially smaller than observed for myo1cIQ-tail, which is consistent with a single phosphoinositide-specific binding site (26Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). We examined the time courses of myo1cIQ-tail-LUV dissociation as a function of the soluble inositol phosphate concentration. Amplitudes of the dissociation transients show that >6.3 μm InsP6 completely displaces 100 nm myo1cIQ-tail from 50 μm 2% PtdIns(4,5)P2 LUVs (Fig. 4, top), as predicted by steady-state competition measurements (13Hokanson D.E. Laakso J.M. Lin T. Sept D. Ostap E.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4856-4865Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the dissociation rates increase hyperbolically with increasing InsP6 concentrations (Fig. 4), which, under these experimental conditions, is not consistent with a simple competitive binding mechanism as shown in Scheme 1, where, kd is a rate-limiting dissociation step. Experiments performed with 6.3–25 μm InsP3 have the same dissociation time courses as those acquired with InsP6 (data not shown). Additionally, control experiments indicate that the inositol phosphate-induced rate increases are not the result of increases in ionic strength caused by the addition of InsP3 or InsP6 (data not shown). The hyperbolic increase in the dissociation rate suggests a two-step dissociation reaction, which may result from the two membrane-binding sites in the myo1cIQ-tail. Therefore, we acquired dissociation transients at a high myo1cIQ-tail to accessible PtdIns(4,5)P2 ratio (5:1) to minimize the number of phosphoinositides bound to myo1cIQ-tail via nonspecific electrostatic interactions (Fig. 4, top). The amplitudes of the dissociation transients indicate that InsP6 completely displaces 0.63 μm myo1cIQ-tail from 50 μm 0.5% PtdIns(4,5)P2 LUVs. The rates increase hyperbolically with the InsP6 concentration substantially faster than measured in experiments using 2% PtdIns(4,5)P2 LUVs (Fig. 4, top). The dissociation reaction was modeled as shown in Sch"
https://openalex.org/W2096205139,"Background Agri-environment schemes play an increasingly important role for the conservation of rare plants in intensively managed agricultural landscapes. However, little is known about their effects on gene flow via pollen dispersal between populations of these species. Methodology/Principal Findings In a 2-year experiment, we observed effective pollen dispersal from source populations of Centaurea jacea in restored meadows, the most widespread Swiss agri-environment scheme, to potted plants in adjacent intensively managed meadows without other individuals of this species. Potted plants were put in replicated source populations at 25, 50, 100 m and where possible 200 m distance from these source populations. Pollen transfer among isolated plants was prevented by temporary bagging, such that only one isolated plant was accessible for flower visitors at any one time. Because C. jacea is self-incompatible, seed set in single-plant isolates indicated insect mediated effective pollen dispersal from the source population. Seed set was higher in source populations (35.7±4.4) than in isolates (4.8±1.0). Seed set declined from 18.9% of that in source populations at a distance of 25 m to 7.4% at 200 m. At a distance of 200 m seed set was still significantly higher in selfed plants, indicating long-distance effective pollen dispersal up to 200 m. Analyses of covariance suggested that bees contributed more than flies to this long-distance pollen dispersal. We found evidence that pollen dispersal to single-plant isolates was positively affected by the diversity and flower abundance of neighboring plant species in the intensively managed meadow. Furthermore, the decline of the dispersal was less steep when the source population of C. jacea was large. Conclusions We conclude that insect pollinators can effectively transfer pollen from source populations of C. jacea over at least 200 m, even when “recipient populations” consisted of single-plant isolates, suggesting that gene flow by pollen over this distance is very likely. Source population size and flowering environment surrounding recipient plants appear to be important factors affecting pollen dispersal in C. jacea. It is conceivable that most insect-pollinated plants in a network of restored sites within intensively managed grassland can form metapopulations, if distances between sites are of similar magnitude as tested here."
https://openalex.org/W2066558779,"Background The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is activated in parallel with the motor system during cyclical and effortful imagined actions. However, it is not clear whether the ANS is activated during motor imagery of discrete movements and whether this activation is specific to the movement being imagined. Here, we explored these topics by studying the baroreflex control of the cardiovascular system. Methodology/Principal Findings Arterial pressure and heart rate were recorded in ten subjects who executed or imagined trunk or leg movements against gravity. Trunk and leg movements result in different physiological reactions (orthostatic hypotension phenomenon) when they are executed. Interestingly, ANS activation significantly, but similarly, increased during imagined trunk and leg movements. Furthermore, we did not observe any physiological modulation during a control mental-arithmetic task or during motor imagery of effortless movements (horizontal wrist displacements). Conclusions/Significance We concluded that ANS activation during motor imagery is general and not specific and physiologically prepares the organism for the upcoming effortful action."
https://openalex.org/W2120144952,"Although B. bronchiseptica efficiently infects a wide range of mammalian hosts and efficiently spreads among them, it is rarely observed in humans. In contrast to the many other hosts of B. bronchiseptica, humans are host to the apparently specialized pathogen B. pertussis, the great majority having immunity due to vaccination, infection or both. Here we explore whether immunity to B. pertussis protects against B. bronchiseptica infection. In a murine model, either infection or vaccination with B. pertussis induced antibodies that recognized antigens of B. bronchiseptica and protected the lower respiratory tract of mice against three phylogenetically disparate strains of B. bronchiseptica that efficiently infect naïve animals. Furthermore, vaccination with purified B. pertussis-derived pertactin, filamentous hemagglutinin or the human acellular vaccine, Adacel, conferred similar protection against B. bronchiseptica challenge. These data indicate that individual immunity to B. pertussis affects B. bronchiseptica infection, and suggest that the high levels of herd immunity against B. pertussis in humans could explain the lack of observed B. bronchiseptica transmission. This could also explain the apparent association of B. bronchiseptica infections with an immunocompromised state."

The primary signal for rhodopsin is the 11-cis to all-trans photoisomerization of retinal covalently bound to the apoprotein opsin through a protonated Schiff base to Lys296.

Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 3063-3071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although of fundamental importance for GPCR activation, the potential implication of lipid protein interactions in “proton switching” is not clear. A functional role of Glu-134 in lipid interactions has been originally derived from IR spectra where E134Q replacement abolished changes of lipid headgroup vibrations in the MIIGt complex (19Fahmy K. Sakmar T.P. Siebert F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10607-10612Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Computational approaches emphasized the “strategic” location of the D(E)RY motif (27Huber T. Botelho A.V. Beyer K. Brown M.F. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 2078-2100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and the Glu-134 carboxyl pKa may critically depend on the lipid protein interface (28Periole X. Ceruso M.A. Mehler E.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6858-6864Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, the implications for proton switching are not evident, and the theoretical interest is contrasted by the lack of experimental data addressing the effect of the lipidic phase on side chain protonation, secondary structure, and membrane topology of the D(E)RY motif. We have studied the coupling between conformation and protonation in single transmembrane segments derived from H3 of bovine rhodopsin. We have assessed the “modular” function of the D(E)RY motif by determining parameters not evident from the crystal structures, i.e. the pKa of the conserved carboxyl, its linkage to helical structure, and the effect of protonation on side chain to lipid headgroup distance. We show that the D(E)RY motif encodes an autonomous “proton switch” controlling side chain exposure and helix formation in the low dielectric of a lipidic phase. The data ascribe a functional role to lipid protein interactions that couple the chemical potential of protons to an activity-promoting GPCR conformation in a ligand-independent manner. 1,2-Dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (PS), l-α-phosphatidylcholine (PC), cholesterol (CH), n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside (OG), and n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DM) were from Sigma. 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(5-dimethylamino-1-naphthalenesulfonyl) (dansyl-PE) was from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Fourier transform IR (FTIR) spectra were obtained with peptides (∼10 mg/ml) in 5% DM, 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, using a vector 22 spectrometer (Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany) at 2 cm−1 resolution. 30 μl of the sample were transferred into a Bio-ATR-II cell (Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany) and the pH changed from 8.8 to 3 by dialysis (100 mm sodium phosphate). Pure buffer spectra were used as spectral references to calibrate the pH-dependent absorption strength and frequency of the phosphate stretching modes. Therefore, a very sensitive real time monitor of pH changes could be implemented. Circular dichroism spectra were recorded at room temperature with a J-815 instrument (Jasco, Gross-Umstadt, Germany) at ∼4 liters/min N2 flow rate from 200 to 260 nm in 0.1-cm cuvettes on DM-solubilized peptides (0.2–0.3 mg/ml). Ellipticity (θ) was recorded in millidegrees. Fluorescence measurements were performed with an LS55 spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 200-μl cuvettes at 285 nm for Trp excitation and emission recorded from 290 to 450 nm (slit width of 5 nm). Peptide-containing micelles were prepared by solubilization of 1–2 mg of peptide in ∼200 μl of 5% DM followed by 30-fold dilution in 100 mm phosphate buffer of different pH. “Lipid-doped” peptide-containing micelles were prepared by dissolving ∼2 mg of peptide in 5% DM (∼600 μl) and mixing with the appropriate vacuum-dried amounts of dansyl-PE and PS in a molar ratio of 1:2.5:1, respectively. 20 μl aliquots were diluted 30-fold in a series of phosphate buffers (100 mm) allowing duplicate recording of emission spectra at each pH. Peptide-containing vesicles were prepared by mixing 1–2 mg of peptide solubilized in ∼ 800 μl of 5% OG with PS, dansyl-PE, and PC in the ratio 1:2.5:2.5, respectively, with a final total lipid:peptide ratio of 50–80. The detergent was removed by 15 h of flow cell dialysis, and the suspension was sonicated and freeze-thawed 10 times and diluted in 100 mm phosphate buffer. Cholesterol-containing vesicles were prepared in parallel from the same stock by supplementing an aliquot of the OG-solubilized mixture with cholesterol to a final total lipid:cholesterol ratio of 1:0.2. Peptides were synthesized and high pressure liquid chromatography-purified (free of trifluoroacetate) by ThermoFisher (Ulm, Germany) with C and N termini amidated and acetylated, respectively. Peptides of the following sequences were derived from amino acids 108–138 in H3 of rhodopsin: H3E, TGC NLA(E) GFF ATL GGA(E) IAL WSL VVL AIE RYV V; H3E27Q, TGC NLA(E) GFF ATL GGA(E) IAL WSL VVL AIQ(E) RYV V; H3E27D, TGC NLA(E) GFF ATL GGA(E) IAL FSL VVL AID RYV W; H3W19F/V31W, TGC NLA(E) GFF ATL GGA(E) IAL F(W)SL VVL AIE RYV W(V); H3W19F/V31W/E27Q, TGC NLA(E) GFF ATL GGA(E) IAL F(W)SL VVL AIQ(E) RYV W(V); native amino acids in parentheses were replaced by the preceding ones. The helicity of the peptides was assessed by infrared spectroscopy and circular dichroism measurements. As shown in Fig. 1, the degree of helicity depends strongly on even very subtle changes in the sequence. In the context of the most native-like sequence in peptide H3E, the additional shift of the tryptophan from position 19 to 31 as well as the further replacement of the Glu-134 homologue by glutamine does not interfere with a predominantly helical secondary structure (inset). Spectral decomposition of the integral IR absorption in the amide I range into gaussian/lorentzian curves shows 70–80% α-helical structure for H3E and H3W19F/V31W/E27Q with peak frequencies at 1654–1656 cm−1. The CD spectra of the latter peptides (Fig. 1, inset) were converted to mean residue ellipticity in degrees·dmol−1·cm−2 as θres = 100·θ/(c·l·n), where c is the molar concentration of the peptide; l is optical path length (0.1 cm), and n is the number of amino acids in the peptide (here 31). The fraction p of helical structure was calculated as p = −θres222/(39,500·(1–2.57/ν)) as described (29Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1964) Google Scholar). Consistency requires that the average number ν of peptide bonds in helical conformation complies with ν/31 = p, which was obtained for ν = 22 and p = 0.71. Thus, ∼22 out of the total of 31 amino acids in each of the two peptides are on average in a helical conformation that is on the lower side of the range estimated by FTIR spectroscopy and suggests that 4–5 disordered amino acids form the C- and N-terminal helical ends. In contrast to the largely helical peptides H3W19F/V31W and H3W19F/V31W/E27Q, the related pair of sequences H3E and H3E27Q shows helicity only for H3E. Three independent synthesis rounds using different technologies failed to produce peptides H3E27Q and H3E27D with helical structures upon detergent solubilization. The CD spectra of these peptides are rather featureless (Fig. 1, inset), and their IR absorption shows only a small fraction of helical structure (1656 cm−1) relative to a predominating amide I mode at low frequency indicative of aggregation. Thus, under the conditions of the FTIR and CD experiments, the replacement of Glu-27 by Gln allows helix formation only in the presence of the additional W19F replacement. Therefore, the proton-induced conformational switch was studied by FTIR in the least modified sequence, i.e. H3E, whereas the negative control was provided by H3W19F/V31W/E27Q. For ICL2, AIE RYV W(V)VC KPM SNF RFG, this peptide was derived from amino acids 132–149, containing the C-terminal end of H3 and its cytosolic extension. The linkage between conformation and carboxyl protonation in the D(E)RY motif was studied in the peptide H3E corresponding to amino acids 108 to 138 of rhodopsin. The native residues Glu-113 and Glu-122 were replaced by alanines, rendering the carboxylate in the Glu-134 homologue (i.e. Glu-27 in the peptide) the only carboxyl in H3E. The symmetric carboxylate stretching mode of Glu-27 (1401 cm−1) and the narrow amide I absorption at 1656 cm−1 (typical of the helical secondary structure of the peptide backbone) were used to monitor by FTIR spectroscopy the side chain protonation and secondary structure, respectively. Fig. 2A shows the absolute IR absorption and the pH-induced difference spectra, obtained by dialysis-coupled attenuated total reflectance-FTIR difference spectroscopy (30Fahmy K. Recent Research Developments in Biophysical Chemistry.in: Pandalai S.G. Vol. 2. Research Sign post, Trivandrum, Kerala, India2001: 1-17Google Scholar). Spectra recorded at different pH values were subtracted from a reference spectrum acquired at pH 8.8, where the Glu-134 homologue is fully ionized (maximal absorption at 1401 cm−1). The stretching vibrations of the buffer phosphates between 1200 and 800 cm−1 served as a pH monitor. The macroscopic pKa of Glu-27 was identified by the spectrum with half-maximal intensity of the 1401 cm−1 band. The latter was obtained at pH 5.9, i.e. 1–2 pH units above the pK of a glutamate side chain in aqueous solution. Also the peptide backbone exhibited pH-dependent transitions, giving rise to changes of the amide II band around 1550 cm−1 (overlapping with the antisymmetric carboxylate stretching mode at ∼1560 cm−1) and the amide I absorption at 1656 cm−1. The structural change was evaluated using the titration spectra in Fig. 2B. The inset in Fig. 2B shows that the 1656/1638 cm−1 absorption change correlates linearly with the carboxylate absorption at 1401 cm−1. The secondary structural change is coupled to side chain protonation with a common pKa of 5.9, with a more helical structure favored at acidic pH. The integral intensity change at 1656 cm−1 corresponds to 3–5% of the total amide I absorption of H3E (Fig. 2A), indicating that side chain protonation extends the helical structure by an average of 1–2 peptide bonds. This process was abolished upon E27Q replacement in the peptide H3W19F/V31W/E27Q (readily adopting a helical structure in contrast to the alternative negative control sequence H3E27Q, see “Experimental Procedures”), which did not exhibit the pH-sensitive 1656/1638 cm−1 difference band (Fig. 2B). Thus, the H3 secondary structure is controlled by the protonation state of the carboxyl in the D(E)RY motif. The functionality of the proton-dependent rearrangement of the C-terminal structure in the H3W19F/V31W background containing the Glu-134 homologue is shown below and proves its independence from the altered location of the Trp. The upshift of the pKa relative to that of a glutamate in water indicates that side chain protonation at the H3 C terminus is stabilized by the concomitant helix extension. To prove the localization of the structural transition, a Trp was C-terminally attached, replacing the Val-138 homologue of rhodopsin, and for the purpose of specificity, Trp-19 (corresponding to the native Trp-126) was replaced by Phe, resulting in the construct H3W19F/V31W, which shows a pH-sensitive emission in the 300–400 nm range (Fig. 3). Trp-31 is two residues away from the tyrosine of the D(E)RY motif. It acts as an energy acceptor for the excited state of tyrosine, which shows appreciable emission only in the absence of Trp-31 or in the presence of the more distant Trp-19 (Fig. 3, inset A). The Trp-dominated emission in H3W19F/V31W provides a sensitive fluorescence monitor of structural transitions in the D(E)RY motif due to both the geometrical constraints for FRET and the hydrophobicity dependence of Trp emission itself. The pH-induced emission difference spectra show that in the ionized state of Glu-27 (positive lobe at 365 nm) the emission of Trp-31 is shifted to longer wavelengths versus the protonated state (negative lobe at 320 nm). This could reflect reduced quenching of tyrosine as well as exposure of Trp to a more hydrophobic environment at pH <6. The half-maximal emission change from the D(E)RYVW sequence is interpolated to pH 5.6 and is lost upon E27Q replacement. This parallels the infrared results and supports the localization of the detected secondary structure formation within the direct vicinity of the D(E)RY motif. The protonation-induced blue shift of the Trp emission maximum is also observed with H3W19F/V31W in DOPC vesicles (Fig. 3), although with an ∼50% reduced amplitude that is probably caused by the presence of zwitterionic (i.e. more hydrophilic) headgroups as compared with the neutral phase boundary of the DM micelle. Due to the strong light scatter in the near-UV light caused by the vesicles, the signal to noise ratio is also ∼5-fold reduced. In contrast to the systematic pH dependence of Trp emission shown for the TM3-derived peptides, an unsystematic pH dependence was obtained from the peptide ICL2 (Fig. 3, inset B) containing the D(E)RY motif and the ensuing second cytosolic loop of rhodopsin (Ala-132 to Gly-149 with V138W replacement). Side chain neutralization and helix extension in the vicinity of the D(E)RY motif is expected to alter the hydrophobic length of the H3 segment. To test whether these coupled processes affect the distance between the H3 C terminus and the phase boundary in a micellar or lipidic environment, the C-terminal Trp of the peptide H3W19F/V31W was employed as a donor fluorphore whose emission is quenched by a dansyl group (via FRET) in measurements, including dansyl-labeled phosphatidylethanolamine (dansyl-PE). Fig. 4 (inset) shows that excitation at 285 nm of “dansyl-PE-doped” peptide-containing micelles evokes emission from Trp and dansyl at 345 and 524 nm, respectively. Trp emission was typically 10–30% of that in the absence of dansyl-PE. The 524 nm emission increased upon acidification, whereas Trp emission decreased, indicating a more efficient energy transfer when Glu-27 is protonated. dansyl absorption and emission are intrinsically pH-independent in the pH 4–10 range (31Lowe M.P. Parker D. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 2001; 317: 163-173Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 32Koike T. Watanabe T. Aoki S. Kimura E. Shiro M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 12696-12703Crossref Scopus (263) Google Scholar). To correct for the different amounts of dansyl-PE-labeled micelles or vesicles in the different samples, however, the residual Trp emission was normalized with respect to the fluorescence efficiency upon direct excitation of dansyl-PE at 336 nm in these systems. Therefore, the residual Trp emission from samples derived from the same stock of a given lipidic composition but transferred to different buffers is scaled to the same total concentration of vesicles in each buffer. The evaluation is restricted to the quenching of the donor fluorescence, i.e. to the residual Trp emission at 345 nm. This allows comparing the pH sensitivity of dansyl-mediated quenching of Trp-31 emission in micelles and vesicles consisting of PC, PS, and cholesterol at different pH values (Fig. 4) and independently of the determination of absolute FRET efficiency. For better comparison of the apparent pKa values obtained from fits to Henderson-Hasselbach curves, the traces (and original data) were scaled to the fitted signal level at pH 9 for each sample. The quenching of Trp-31 exhibited an apparent pKa of 6 ± 0.3, which was independent of the assessed lipid composition and of the presence of cholesterol within the accuracy of the experiment. Trp fluorescence was more efficiently quenched at acidic pH indicating that upon neutralization of Glu-27 the C terminus moves from an aqueous to a more hydrophobic environment near the lipid headgroups. This agrees with the slight blue shift of the Trp emission (causing a negligible change of the overlap integral between dansyl absorption and the Trp emission of <0.5%) and would favor the deactivation of the excited state of Trp-31 upon shortening of the averaged donor to acceptor distance. Alternatively, the C-terminal Trp may become rotationally constrained if it gets partially immersed in the lipidic phase. This could also reduce Trp emission if a more favorable alignment with the dansyl electronic transition moment is achieved. The same mechanistic conclusion would apply; the H3W19F/V31W C terminus moves from an exposed to a more lipid-immersed state with Glu-27 protonated, whereas the opposite transition contradicts the data. No attempt was made to determine and compare absolute FRET efficiencies in the different lipidic compositions by further evaluation of the dansyl emission at 524 nm in relation to Trp quenching. The unknown effect on the rotational freedom of both the C-terminal Trp and the dansyl group in the different lipidic compositions would render a more detailed analysis ambiguous. The high pKa of carboxyl protonation in micelles and vesicles implies that the protonated state of the Glu-134 couples to a free enthalpy-delivering reaction. The coupling depends on the α-helix preceding the D(E)RY motif in a hydrophobic phase as it is not seen in ICL2 (Fig. 3). The low dielectric constant in vesicle membranes and in the interior of a micelle could promote both stabilization of the protonated side chain and of helical secondary structure. Therefore, we have asked whether a hydrophobicity-mediated proton switch is consistent with thermodynamic estimates of helix stability and charge-dependent partitioning of a carboxyl side chain at a phase boundary. The coupling of conformation to protonation is described by the microscopic equilibria defined in Fig. 5A. Peptide conformations with an exposed (E) or buried (B) state of the ionized carboxylate of Glu-27 interconvert with the equilibrium constant KC and their protonated counterparts (EH and BH) with the equilibrium constant KCH. State function properties require that the free enthalpy difference for the conformational transition in the protonated versus the ionized state (i.e. ΔΔG = −RT ln KCH/KC) equals that of transferring a neutral versus an ionized glutamic acid side chain from an aqueous to a hydrophobic medium (i.e. ΔΔG = −RT ln KB/KE). Free enthalpies ΔGtr have been determined for water to octanol transfers (33Wimley W.C. Creamer T.P. White S.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5109-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The reported ΔΔG of 14.7 kJ (3.52 kcal) for glutamic acid provides an estimate of the enthalpy available to link protonation to conformation by a purely hydrophobicity-driven mechanism. These transfer enthalpies do indeed reproduce the measured pKa of 5.9 for protonation/helix extension with a ΔGc of 6 kJ for the transition of the ionized state from the exposed to the buried conformation. The resulting free energy surface of the system is shown in Fig. 5B. Upon acidification, the system moves along the “valley” from less than 10% protonation with >80% of the carboxylates exposed to the aqueous phase at pH 7 (microscopic pKB of the buried state) to more than 90% protonation with >80% of the neutral side chains buried at pH 4.4 (microscopic pKE of the exposed state). The equilibrium states trace out a trajectory that runs roughly diagonally through the conformation/protonation plane reproducing the linearity between the measured amide I and carboxylate absorption changes. Breakage of the ionic lock at the cytosolic H3/H6 interface in the transition to the Gt-activating state of rhodopsin is linked to protonation of Glu-134 in the class-conserved D(E)RY motif in H3. This constitutes one of the two proton switches that control rhodopsin activation (34Mahalingam M. Martínez-Mayorga K. Brown M.F. Vogel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Several effects of UV radiation on Dendritic cells (DCs) functions have been described. However, gene expression changes induced by UV radiation in DCs have not been addressed before. In this report, we irradiated human monocyte-derived DCs with solar-simulated UVA/UVB and analyzed regulated genes on human whole genome arrays. Results were validated by RT-PCR and further analyzed by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Solar-simulated UV radiation up-regulated expression of genes involved in cellular stress and inflammation, and down-regulated genes involved in chemotaxis, vesicular transport and RNA processing. Twenty four genes were selected for comparison by RT-PCR with similarly treated human primary keratinocytes and human melanocytes. Several genes involved in the regulation of the immune response were differentially regulated in UVA/UVB irradiated human monocyte-derived DCs, such as protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type E (PTPRE), thrombospondin-1 (THBS1), inducible costimulator ligand (ICOSL), galectins, Src-like adapter protein (SLA), IL-10 and CCR7. These results indicate that UV-exposure triggers the regulation of a complex gene repertoire involved in human-DC–mediated immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2166326954,"ABSTRACT Although evidence is accumulating for promising anticancer properties of host-defense peptides (HDPs), their potential therapeutic use suffers from limitations inherent to peptide pharmaceuticals, including poor bioavailability and potential toxicity. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that HDP mimics might generate improved anticancer derivatives. Oligomers of acyl-lysyl (OAKs) varying with respect to charge, hydrophobicity, and backbone length were screened against prostate adenocarcinoma cell line TRAMP-C2 using the XTT assay. A promising 11-mer sequence, designated α12-3β12, was further characterized in terms of selectivity (using human primary fibroblasts and malignant cells), mechanism of action and its relation to multidrug resistance (using 7 ABC multidrug efflux transporters), and antitumor efficacy (as assessed in C57BL/6J mice bearing TRAMP-C2 tumors). The OAK exerted rapid and selective cytotox-icity against malignant cells, apparently via an intracel-lular multitarget mode of action, thereby overcoming major modalities of chemoresistance. Both systemic and local administrations of α12-3β12 to tumor-bearing mice significantly inhibited tumor progression and were associated with an improved toxicity profile when compared to doxorubicin. Moreover, a combination of α12-3β12 with doxorubicin can lead to tumor eradication. Collectively, the current findings establish the potential of an HDP-mimetic approach for developing simplified yet robust antitumor agents that bear a key advantage of overcoming MDR phenomena.

https://openalex.org/W2037939939,"3-Methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder of leucine catabolism. MCC is a heteromeric mitochondrial enzyme composed of biotin-containing alpha (MCCA) and smaller beta (MCCB) subunits encoded by MCCA and MCCB, respectively. We report studies of the c.1054G-->A mutation in exon 11 of MCCB detected in the homozygous state in a patient with MCC deficiency. Sequence analysis of MCCB cDNA revealed two overlapping transcripts, one containing the normal 73 bp of exon 11 including the missense mutation c.1054G-->A (p.G352R), the other with exon 11 replaced by a 64-bp sequence from intron 10 (cryptic exon 10a) that maintains the reading frame and is flanked by acceptable splice consensus sites. In expression studies, we show that both transcripts lack detectable MCC activity. Western blot analysis showed slightly reduced levels of MCCB using the transcript containing the missense mutation, whereas no MCCB was detected with the transcript containing the cryptic exon 10a. Analysis of the region harboring the mutation revealed that the c.1054G-->A mutation is located in an exon splice enhancer sequence. Using MCCB minigene constructs to transfect MCCB-deficient fibroblasts, we demonstrate that the reduction in utilization of exon 11 associated with the c.1054G-->A mutation is due to alteration of this exon splice enhancer. Further, we show that optimization of the weak splice donor site of exon 11 corrects the splicing defect. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a point mutation disrupting an exon splice enhancer that causes exon skipping along with utilization of a cryptic exon."
https://openalex.org/W2108219708,"IkappaBzeta is a novel member of the IkappaB family of NFkappaB regulators, which modulates NFkappaB activity in the nucleus, rather than controlling its nuclear translocation. IkappaBzeta is specifically induced by IL-1beta and several TLR ligands and positively regulates NFkappaB-mediated transcription of genes such as IL-6 and NGAL as an NFkappaB binding co-factor. We recently reported that the IL-1 family cytokines, IL-1beta and IL-18, strongly synergize with TNFalpha for IFNgamma production in KG-1 cells, whereas the same cytokines alone have minimal effects on IFNgamma production. Given the striking similarities between the IL-1R and IL-18R signaling pathways we hypothesized that a common signaling event or gene product downstream of these receptors is responsible for the observed synergy. We investigated IkappaBzeta protein expression in KG-1 cells upon stimulation with IL-1beta, IL-18 and TNFalpha. Our results demonstrated that IL-18, as well as IL-1beta, induced moderate IkappaBzeta expression in KG-1 cells. However, TNFalpha synergized with IL-1beta and IL-18, whereas by itself it had a minimal effect on IkappaBzeta expression. NFkappaB inhibition resulted in decreased IL-1beta/IL-18/TNFalpha-stimulated IFNgamma release. Moreover, silencing of IkappaBzeta expression led to a specific decrease in IFNgamma production. Overall, our data suggests that IkappaBzeta positively regulates NFkappaB-mediated IFNgamma production in KG-1 cells."

The universal sulfuryl group donor for SULT-catalyzed sulfation is adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS), whereas the reaction products are a sulfated product and adenosine 3′,5′-diphosphate (PAP). Although SULT-catalyzed kinetic mechanisms have been studied since the 1980s, they remain unclear. Human SULT1A1 is an important phase II drug-metabolizing enzyme. Previously, isotope exchange at equilibrium indicated steady-state ordered mechanism with PAPS and PAP binding to the free SULT1A1 (Tyapochkin, E., Cook, P. F., and Chen, G. (2008) Biochemistry 47, 11894–11899). On the basis of activation of SULT1A1 by para-nitrophenyl sulfate (pNPS), an ordered bypass mechanism has been proposed where pNPS sulfates PAP prior to its release from the E·PAP complex regenerating E·PAPS. Data are consistent with uncompetitive substrate inhibition by naphthol as a result of formation of the E·PAP·naphthol dead-end complex; formation of the complex is corroborated by naphthol/PAP double inhibition experiments. pNPS activation data demonstrate an apparent ping-pong behavior with pNPS adding to E·PAP, and competitive inhibition by naphthol consistent with formation of the E·PAP·naphthol complex. Exchange against forward reaction flux (PAPS plus naphthol) beginning with [35S]PAPS and generating [35S]naphthyl sulfate is also consistent with pNPS intercepting the E·PAP complex.

Sulfation of xenobiotics is mainly associated with detoxification, biotransformation of a relatively hydrophobic xenobiotic into a more water-soluble sulfuric ester that is readily excreted. However, in some cases sulfation can also cause bioactivation of procarcinogens and promutagens, leading to possible toxic effects (10Coughtrie M.W. Johnston L.E. Drug Metab.

Although many SULT isoforms have been isolated and characterized, their biological functions and catalytic mechanisms are still not well understood. Human phenol sulfotransferase (SULT1A1) is one of the major detoxifying enzymes for phenolic xenobiotics; it also catalyzes the sulfation of endogenous hydroxyl biosignaling molecules. It has very broad substrate specificity and high activity toward most phenolic compounds. SULT1A1 is also widely distributed in the human body. On the basis of isotope exchange at equilibrium, we showed that the kinetic mechanism for human SULT1A1 is steady-state-ordered with PAPS binding to the protein first, and PAP released last (13Tyapochkin E.

Inhibition of SULT1A1 has been observed by the substrate, naphthol. There are a number of different mechanisms that have been proposed for substrate inhibition, but the mechanism remains unclear. A ternary complex formed between substrate and the enzyme·PAP complex is the most likely possibility in an ordered mechanism, but binding to free enzyme is also possible (12Duffel M.W. Jakoby W.B. J.

Abeta(42), in contrast to Abeta(40), is thought to be the pathogenic form triggering the pathological cascade in AD. In order to unravel overall gene regulation we monitored the transcriptomic responses to increased or decreased Abeta(40) and Abeta(42) levels, generated and derived from its precursor C99 (C-terminal fragment of APP comprising 99 amino acids) in human neuroblastoma cells. We identified fourteen differentially expressed transcripts by hierarchical clustering and discussed their involvement in AD. These fourteen transcripts were grouped into two main clusters each showing distinct differential expression patterns depending on Abeta(40) and Abeta(42) levels. Among these transcripts we discovered an unexpected inverse and strong differential expression of neurogenin 2 (NEUROG2) and KIAA0125 in all examined cell clones. C99-overexpression had a similar effect on NEUROG2 and KIAA0125 expression as a decreased Abeta(42)/Abeta(40) ratio. Importantly however, an increased Abeta(42)/Abeta(40) ratio, which is typical of AD, had an inverse expression pattern of NEUROG2 and KIAA0125: An increased Abeta(42)/Abeta(40) ratio up-regulated NEUROG2, but down-regulated KIAA0125, whereas the opposite regulation pattern was observed for a decreased Abeta(42)/Abeta(40) ratio. We discuss the possibilities that the so far uncharacterized KIAA0125 might be a counter player of NEUROG2 and that KIAA0125 could be involved in neurogenesis, due to the involvement of NEUROG2 in developmental neural processes."
https://openalex.org/W2161023750,"Background Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine was a common first line drug therapy to treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria, but increasing therapeutic failures associated with the development of significant levels of resistance worldwide has prompted change to alternative treatment regimes in many national malaria control programs. Methodology and Finding We conducted an in vivo therapeutic efficacy trial of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine at two locations in the Peruvian Amazon enrolling 99 patients of which, 86 patients completed the protocol specified 28 day follow up. Our objective was to correlate the presence of polymorphisms in P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase and dihydropteroate synthase to in vitro parasite susceptibility to sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine and to in vivo treatment outcomes. Inhibitory concentration 50 values of isolates increased with numbers of mutations (single [108N], sextuplet [BR/51I/108N/164L and 437G/581G]) and septuplet (BR/51I/108N/164L and 437G/540E/581G) with geometric means of 76 nM (35–166 nM), 582 nM (49-6890- nM) and 4909 (3575–6741 nM) nM for sulfadoxine and 33 nM (22–51 nM), 81 nM (19–345 nM), and 215 nM (176–262 nM) for pyrimethamine. A single mutation present in the isolate obtained at the time of enrollment from either dihydrofolate reductase (164L) or dihydropteroate synthase (540E) predicted treatment failure as well as any other single gene alone or in combination. Patients with the dihydrofolate reductase 164L mutation were 3.6 times as likely to be treatment failures [failures 85.4% (164L) vs 23.7% (I164); relative risk = 3.61; 95% CI: 2.14 – 6.64] while patients with the dihydropteroate synthase 540E were 2.6 times as likely to fail treatment (96.7% (540E) vs 37.5% (K540); relative risk = 2.58; 95% CI: 1.88 – 3.73). Patients with both dihydrofolate reductase 164L and dihydropteroate synthase 540E mutations were 4.1 times as likely to be treatment failures [96.7% vs 23.7%; RR = 4.08; 95% CI: 2.45 – 7.46] compared to patients having both wild forms (I164 and K540). Conclusions In this part of the Amazon basin, it may be possible to predict treatment failure with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine equally well by determination of either of the single mutations dihydrofolate reductase 164L or dihydropteroate synthase 540E.

https://openalex.org/W2117185915,"Background The Bacillus subtilis genes dnaD and dnaB are essential for the initiation of DNA replication and are required for loading of the replicative helicase at the chromosomal origin of replication oriC. Wild type DnaD and DnaB interact weakly in vitro and this interaction has not been detected in vivo or in yeast two-hybrid assays. Methodology/Principal Findings We isolated second site suppressors of the temperature sensitive phenotypes caused by one dnaD mutation and two different dnaB mutations. Five different intragenic suppressors of the dnaD23ts mutation were identified. One intragenic suppressor was a deletion of two amino acids in DnaD. This deletion caused increased and detectable interaction between the mutant DnaD and wild type DnaB in a yeast two-hybrid assay, similar to the increased interaction caused by a missense mutation in dnaB that is an extragenic suppressor of dnaD23ts. We isolated both intragenic and extragenic suppressors of the two dnaBts alleles. Some of the extragenic suppressors were informational suppressors (missense suppressors) in tRNA genes. These suppressor mutations caused a change in the anticodon of an alanine tRNA so that it would recognize the mutant codon (threonine) in dnaB and likely insert the wild type amino acid (alanine). Conclusions/Significance The intragenic suppressors should provide insights into structure-function relationships in DnaD and DnaB, and interactions between DnaD and DnaB. The extragenic suppressors in the tRNA genes have important implications regarding the amount of wild type DnaB needed in the cell. Since missense suppressors are typically inefficient, these findings indicate that production of a small amount of wild type DnaB, in combination with the mutant protein, is sufficient to restore some DnaB function."
https://openalex.org/W2112413282,"Understanding motion perception continues to be the subject of much debate, a central challenge being to account for why the speeds and directions seen accord with neither the physical movements of objects nor their projected movements on the retina. Here we investigate the varied perceptions of speed that occur when stimuli moving across the retina traverse different projected distances (the speed-distance effect). By analyzing a database of moving objects projected onto an image plane we show that this phenomenology can be quantitatively accounted for by the frequency of occurrence of image speeds generated by perspective transformation. These results indicate that speed-distance effects are determined empirically from accumulated past experience with the relationship between image speeds and moving objects."
https://openalex.org/W2054604696,"Thrombospondin-1 is a trimeric, modular calcium-binding glycoprotein. The subunit is composed of an N-terminal module; oligomerization domain; stalk modules including a von Willebrand factor type C module, three properdin or thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR) modules, and two thrombospondin-type EGF-like modules; and a C-terminal signature domain comprising single copies of the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like, wire, and lectin-like modules. Conformational changes in the signature domain influence ligand binding to the N-terminal modules. Interactions have been demonstrated among the modules of the signature domain and the thrombospondin-type EGF-like modules. We have extended this analysis to the rest of the stalk modules. Differential scanning calorimetry revealed interactions between the most C-terminal TSR module and the EGF-like modules. Calorimetry and differences in expression levels of single versus tandem modules indicated that the three TSRs interact with each other as well. No evidence of interactions between the von Willebrand factor type C and TSR modules were detected by differential scanning calorimetry, circular dichroism, or intrinsic fluorescence. These results indicate that the TSR and thrombospondin-type EGF-like stalk modules act as a unit that may relay conformational information between the N-terminal and C-terminal parts of the protein."
