https://openalex.org/W1964155494,The effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine and iproniazid on pregnancy in mice and rabbits were investigated. 5-Hydroxytryptamine can interrupt pregnancy at all stages in mice but is particularly effective early and late in pregnancy. Iproniazid exerts its action essentially in the first half of pregnancy. 5-Hydroxytryptamine produces striking hemorrhage in the placenta.

https://openalex.org/W2001689970,By time-lapse cinematography it was found that Schwann cells in tissue cultures of dorsal root ganglia from newborn rats show a contraction rate of approximately 4 to 18 minutes. This activity is of the order of magnitude reported for oligodendroglia.

https://openalex.org/W75334843,"The formation of pentose phosphate from hexose monophosphate involves either the oxidative pathway from glucose 6phosphate through 6-phosphogluconate or the series of nonoxidative transfer reactions catalyzed by transketolase and transaldolase, in which sedoheptulose 7-phosphate is an intermediate (1). In mammalian tissues the nonoxidative pathway appears to play a major role (2-5), accounting for the synthesis of more than 50% of the ribose of ribonucleic acid and the acidsoluble nucleotides. Pentose phosphate synthesis from hexose monophosphate by the nonoxidative pathway has been presumed to involve the following sequence of reactions (1) :"

https://openalex.org/W2021535879,"Systemic gamma-aminobutyric acid produces a rapid, sustained, but transiently reversible blockade of evoked axodendritic excitatory postsynaptic potentials in neonatal cortex when the ""barrier"" operating to restrict its passage has been altered by various experimental procedures. The data obtained under these conditions indicate the existence of well-developed synaptic pathways in the superficial neuropil of immature cortex."

https://openalex.org/W1994684104,OCCASIONALLY crops of barley and other cereals in the mid-western States of America have been infected with one of several species of Fusarium that cause a condition known as ‘scab’. Such grain often contains an emetic principle1 which renders it unsuitable for feeding to animals having simple stomachs.

https://openalex.org/W2038190347,"THE development of a plaque technique for titrating vaccinia virus on monolayers of chick embryo cells without an agar overlay1 has furthered the investigation of cell-virus interaction in this system and has produced evidence of an ‘eclipse phase’ under certain experimental conditions. The essential prerequisite was that the inoculum, consisting of an elementary body suspension prepared from a rabbit skin-passaged strain of vaccinia by the method of Hoagland, Smadel and Rivers2, was treated ultrasonically before use. Following the infection of monolayers by contact with this inoculum for 5 min. there was a rapid loss of infectivity of adsorbed virus, estimated to be probably about 30–40 per cent of the amount adsorbed, occurring within 10 min. from the first contact between virus and cells. Thereafter the rate of loss was slower, a further 70 per cent of the virus present at the end of the first 10 min. disappearing during 4–6 hr. The titre of virus in the culture began to rise at 7–8 hr. due to production of new virus."

Destruction of nervous tissue at these foci is progressive, and colloidal masses in the vascular lumina of the hypothalamus appear to become fixed in the capillaries of the hypophyseal anterior lobe. Inflammatory reactions are never associated with the lesions, and the latter are larger and more numerous in older animals in warmer environments."

https://openalex.org/W2042079658,VOSE and Koontz1 have suggested that because mixed legume-grass herbage contains a higher level of strontium than grass it would be desirable to restrict dairy cows to an all-grass diet if the level of strontium-90 in milk ever rose to a level giving cause for concern. In the same communication these authors report that the uptake of strontium by herbage is directly related to the uptake of calcium.
https://openalex.org/W1965639611,"DIODONE (3,5-di-iodo-4-pyridone-N-acetic acid), shown by Elsom et al. 1, Landis et al. 2, and Smith et al. 3 to be an effective agent for the estimation of renal plasma flow and tubular function, has been used extensively in physiological studies. In 1945, Smith et al. 4 showed that p-aminohippuric acid was in some ways superior to diodone for these estimations in man because the urine and plasma blanks are small, and because diodone penetrates human red blood cells whereas p-aminohippuric acid does not. The red cells of dogs are permeable to both reagents."
