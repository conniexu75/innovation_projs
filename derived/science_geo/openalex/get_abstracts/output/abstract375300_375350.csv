https://openalex.org/W2106566258,"Columns, Connections, and Correlations What is the nature of interactions between neurons in neural circuits? The prevalent hypothesis suggests that dense local connectivity causes nearby cortical neurons to receive substantial amounts of common input, which in turn leads to strong correlations between them. Now two studies challenge this view, which impacts our fundamental understanding of coding in the cortex. Ecker et al. (p. 584 ) investigated the statistics of correlated firing in pairs of neurons from area V1 of awake macaque monkeys. In contrast to previous studies, correlations turned out to be very low, irrespective of the stimulus being shown to the animals, the distances of the recording sites, and the similarity of the neuron's receptive fields or response properties. In an accompanying modeling and recording paper, Renart et al. (p. 587 ) demonstrate how it is possible to have zero noise correlation, even among cells with common input."
https://openalex.org/W2150752051,"Platelet Microparticles Drive Inflammatory Arthritis Platelets are best known for their critical role in blood clot formation during wound repair, but an appreciation for their role in inflammatory processes is growing. Platelet-derived cellular microparticles (MPs) are small membrane vesicles released from platelets in response to cell activation that can transport biomolecules throughout the body that have also been implicated in inflammatory processes. Boilard et al. (p. 580 ; see the Perspective by Zimmerman and Weyrich ) have now found that platelet-derived MPs probably contribute to the inflammatory processes underlying rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease. The majority of MPs in synovial fluid from patients with various types of inflammatory arthritis were platelet-derived and, importantly, platelet-derived MPs were lacking in synovial fluid from osteoarthritis patients. Furthermore, platelet depletion abrogated disease development in a mouse model of inflammatory arthritis."
https://openalex.org/W2019406135,"Secondary Selectivity Organic molecules consist principally of rings and chains of methylene (secondary) CH 2 groups, intermittently adorned with oxygen or nitrogen centers and more heavily substituted carbons at the junctions. Synthetic transformations would be most efficient if the C–H bonds in any particular methylene group along the framework could be targeted for selective modification. However, for the most part, these carbon centers prove remarkably hard to differentiate for reactive purposes. Chen and White (p. 566 ) now show that an iron catalyst can direct peroxide to oxidize specific secondary C–H bonds preferentially, and with reasonable efficiency, in a range of complex molecules. The observed selectivities follow predictable trends correlated with the electronic and steric environment of the target site."
https://openalex.org/W2015329538,"Recombinant Infectious Prions Prion diseases are a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders that include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cows. The prion hypothesis states that the infectious agent of these diseases is an aberrant conformational isoform of the normal prion protein (PrP C ), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell surface protein enriched in the central nervous system. The final proof for the prion hypothesis is to convert bacterially expressed recombinant PrP into an infectious prion, but this has been difficult to achieve. F. Wang et al. (p. 1132 , published online 28 January; see the Perspective by Supattapone ) put recombinant PrP purified from bacteria into mice and obtained all the characteristics of the infectious agent in prion disease. The recombinant form is not only resistant to proteinase-K, but also shows infectivity in cultured cells and causes rapid disease progression in wild-type mice, yielding both the behavioral and the neuropathological symptoms."

https://openalex.org/W2008207297,"To Degrade or Not to Degrade Regulating the turnover of proteins within the cell is of fundamental importance to almost every physiological process. Hwang et al. (p. 973 , published online 28 January; see the Perspective by Mogk and Bukau ) now find that acetylated N-terminal methionine (Met) is a degradation signal. This degron is recognized by Saccharomyces cerevisiae Doa10, a transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligase that resides in the endoplasmic reticulum and inner nuclear membrane. The removal of N-terminal Met by Met-aminopeptidases generates N-terminal residues that are often N-terminally acetylated. Doa10 selectively binds to the resulting N-degrons, which may represent the most prevalent class of cellular protein degradation signals."
https://openalex.org/W2137029526,"The nature of the pseudogap phase is a central problem in the quest to understand high-Tc cuprate superconductors. A fundamental question is what symmetries are broken when that phase sets in below a temperature T*. There is evidence from both polarized neutron diffraction and polar Kerr effect measurements that time- reversal symmetry is broken, but at temperatures that differ significantly. Broken rotational symmetry was detected by both resistivity and inelastic neutron scattering at low doping and by scanning tunnelling spectroscopy at low temperature, but with no clear connection to T*. Here we report the observation of a large in-plane anisotropy of the Nernst effect in YBa2Cu3Oy that sets in precisely at T*, throughout the doping phase diagram. We show that the CuO chains of the orthorhombic lattice are not responsible for this anisotropy, which is therefore an intrinsic property of the CuO2 planes. We conclude that the pseudogap phase is an electronic state which strongly breaks four-fold rotational symmetry. This narrows the range of possible states considerably, pointing to stripe or nematic orders."

https://openalex.org/W2103230759,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an emerging infectious agent that can cause severe disease in humans and against which there is presently no vaccine. Akahata et al. now describe their development of a virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine that elicits neutralizing antibodies against CHIKV and can protect nonhuman primates from infection. Their VLP-based approach may facilitate development of a CHIKV vaccine for human use. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has infected millions of people in Africa, Europe and Asia1,2 since this alphavirus reemerged from Kenya in 2004. The severity of the disease and the spread of this epidemic virus present a serious public health threat in the absence of vaccines or antiviral therapies. Here, we describe a new vaccine that protects against CHIKV infection of nonhuman primates. We show that selective expression of viral structural proteins gives rise to virus-like particles (VLPs) in vitro that resemble replication-competent alphaviruses. Immunization with these VLPs elicited neutralizing antibodies against envelope proteins from alternative CHIKV strains. Monkeys immunized with VLPs produced high-titer neutralizing antibodies that protected against viremia after high-dose challenge. We transferred these antibodies into immunodeficient mice, where they protected against subsequent lethal CHIKV challenge, indicating a humoral mechanism of protection. Immunization with alphavirus VLP vaccines represents a strategy to contain the spread of CHIKV and related pathogenic viruses in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2010328983,"Background Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) offer significant potential to improve the diagnosis of malaria, and are playing an increasing role in malaria case management, control and elimination. Peru, along with other South American countries, is moving to introduce malaria RDTs as components of malaria control programmes supported by the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and malaria. The selection of the most suitable malaria RDTs is critical to the success of the programmes. Methods Eight of nine microscopy positive P. falciparum samples collected in Iquitos, Peru tested negative or weak positive using HRP2-detecting RDTs. These samples were tested for the presence of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 and their flanking genes by PCR, as well as the presence of HRP proteins by ELISA. To investigate for geographic extent of HRP-deleted parasites and their temporal occurrence a retrospective study was undertaken on 148 microscopy positive P. falciparum samples collected in different areas of the Amazon region of Peru. Findings Eight of the nine isolates lacked the pfhrp2 and/or pfhrp3 genes and one or both flanking genes, and the absence of HRP was confirmed by ELISA. The retrospective study showed that 61 (41%) and 103 (70%) of the 148 samples lacked the pfhrp2 or pfhrp3 genes respectively, with 32 (21.6%) samples lacking both hrp genes. Conclusions This is the first documentation of P. falciparum field isolates lacking pfhrp2 and/or pfhrp3. The high frequency and wide distribution of different parasites lacking pfhrp2 and/or pfhrp3 in widely dispersed areas in the Peruvian Amazon implies that malaria RDTs targeting HRP2 will fail to detect a high proportion of P. falciparum in malaria-endemic areas of Peru and should not be used. RDTs detecting parasite LDH or aldolase and quality microscopy should be use for malaria diagnosis in this region. There is an urgent need for investigation of the abundance and geographic distribution of these parasites in Peru and neighbouring countries."

With 192 intense laser beams focused into a centimeter-scale cavity, a major challenge has been to create a symmetric implosion and the necessary temperatures within the cavity for ignition to be realized (see the Perspective by Norreys ). Glenzer et al. (p. 1228 , published online 28 January) now show that these conditions can be met, paving the way for the next step of igniting a fuel-filled capsule. Furthermore, Li et al. (p. 1231 , published online 28 January) show how charged particles can be used to characterize and measure the conditions within the imploding capsule. The high energies and temperature realized can also be used to model astrophysical and other extreme energy processes in a laboratory settings."
https://openalex.org/W2106891871,"Long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) mark the explosive death of some massive stars and are a rare sub-class of type Ibc supernovae. They are distinguished by the production of an energetic and collimated relativistic outflow powered by a central engine (an accreting black hole or neutron star). Observationally, this outflow is manifested in the pulse of gamma-rays and a long-lived radio afterglow. Until now, central-engine-driven supernovae have been discovered exclusively through their gamma-ray emission, yet it is expected that a larger population goes undetected because of limited satellite sensitivity or beaming of the collimated emission away from our line of sight. In this framework, the recovery of undetected GRBs may be possible through radio searches for type Ibc supernovae with relativistic outflows. Here we report the discovery of luminous radio emission from the seemingly ordinary type Ibc SN 2009bb, which requires a substantial relativistic outflow powered by a central engine. A comparison with our radio survey of type Ibc supernovae reveals that the fraction harbouring central engines is low, about one per cent, measured independently from, but consistent with, the inferred rate of nearby GRBs. Independently, a second mildly relativistic supernova has been reported."
https://openalex.org/W2014379402,"Packing Puzzle The packing of a large number of spheres is a well-studied problem with maximal packing based on the arrangement of nearest neighbors. With much smaller numbers of particles, it is the free energy that governs which packing arrangements dominate. Meng et al. (p. 560 ; see the Perspective by Crocker ) looked at the assembly of colloidal clusters where the number of particles was limited from 2 to 10. For five particles or fewer, only one packing arrangement was found. For six or more particles, while a number of similar energy structures could form, the probability of formation was biased toward those structures with the greater number of nearest-neighbor connections."
https://openalex.org/W1992866464,"Climate warming tends to cause a net release of CO2, which in turn causes an amplification of warming. Estimates of the magnitude of this effect vary widely, leading to a wide range in global warming projections. Recent work suggested that the magnitude of this positive feedback might be about 40 parts per million by volume of CO2 per °C of warming. David Frank and colleagues use three Antarctic ice cores and a suite of climate reconstructions to show that the feedback is likely to be much smaller, with a median of only about 8 p.p.m.v. CO2 per °C. Anthropogenic global warming is likely to be amplified by positive feedback from the global carbon cycle; however, the magnitude of the climate sensitivity of the global carbon cycle, and thus of its positive feedback strength, is under debate. By combining a probabilistic approach with an ensemble of proxy-based temperature reconstructions and pre-industrial CO2 data from three ice cores, this climate sensitivity is now shown to be much smaller than previously thought. The processes controlling the carbon flux and carbon storage of the atmosphere, ocean and terrestrial biosphere are temperature sensitive1,2,3,4 and are likely to provide a positive feedback leading to amplified anthropogenic warming3. Owing to this feedback, at timescales ranging from interannual to the 20–100-kyr cycles of Earth's orbital variations1,5,6,7, warming of the climate system causes a net release of CO2 into the atmosphere; this in turn amplifies warming. But the magnitude of the climate sensitivity of the global carbon cycle (termed γ), and thus of its positive feedback strength, is under debate, giving rise to large uncertainties in global warming projections8,9. Here we quantify the median γ as 7.7 p.p.m.v. CO2 per °C warming, with a likely range of 1.7–21.4 p.p.m.v. CO2 per °C. Sensitivity experiments exclude significant influence of pre-industrial land-use change on these estimates. Our results, based on the coupling of a probabilistic approach with an ensemble of proxy-based temperature reconstructions and pre-industrial CO2 data from three ice cores, provide robust constraints for γ on the policy-relevant multi-decadal to centennial timescales. By using an ensemble of >200,000 members, quantification of γ is not only improved, but also likelihoods can be assigned, thereby providing a benchmark for future model simulations. Although uncertainties do not at present allow exclusion of γ calculated from any of ten coupled carbon–climate models, we find that γ is about twice as likely to fall in the lowermost than in the uppermost quartile of their range. Our results are incompatibly lower (P < 0.05) than recent pre-industrial empirical estimates of ∼40 p.p.m.v. CO2 per °C (refs 6, 7), and correspondingly suggest ∼80% less potential amplification of ongoing global warming."
https://openalex.org/W2064158892,"Benzene represents the showcase of Hückel aromaticity. The silicon analog, hexasilabenzene, has consequently been targeted for decades. We now report an intensely green isomer of Si6R6 (R being 2,4,6-triisopropylphenyl) with a tricyclic structure in the solid state featuring silicon atoms with two, one, and no substituents outside the ring framework. The highly dispersed 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance shifts in solution ranging from +125 to -90 parts per million indicate an inhomogeneous electron distribution due to the dismutation of formal oxidation numbers as compared with that of benzene. Theoretical analysis reveals nonetheless the cyclic delocalization of six mobile electrons of the pi-, sigma- and non-bonding type across the central four-membered ring. For this alternative form of aromaticity, in principle applicable to many Hückel aromatic species, we propose the term dismutational aromaticity."
https://openalex.org/W1991311961,"Promoting Axon Formation How do neurons initiate one axon and lots of dendrites? Using an in vitro assay involving stripes of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), Shelly et al. (p. 547 ) show that an increase in cAMP initiates axon formation while an increase in cGMP initiates dendrites. Moreover, cAMP and cGMP reciprocally inhibit each other via the activation of specific phosphodiesterases, as well as protein kinase A and protein kinase G. Finally, long-range self-inhibition of cAMP can explain why only one axon, yet multiple dendrites, is initiated in single hippocampal neurons in culture. Locally increasing cAMP in one neurite causes long-range cAMP reduction in the rest of the neurites, accompanied by corresponding reciprocal changes in cGMP."
https://openalex.org/W1966198395,"Although the rat is extensively used as a laboratory model, the inability to utilize germ line-competent rat embryonic stem (ES) cells has been a major drawback for studies that aim to elucidate gene functions. Recently, zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) were successfully used to create genome-specific double-stranded breaks and thereby induce targeted gene mutations in a wide variety of organisms including plants, drosophila, zebrafish, etc.We report here on ZFN-induced gene targeting of the rat interleukin 2 receptor gamma (Il2rg) locus, where orthologous human and mouse mutations cause X-linked severe combined immune deficiency (X-SCID). Co-injection of mRNAs encoding custom-designed ZFNs into the pronucleus of fertilized oocytes yielded genetically modified offspring at rates greater than 20%, which possessed a wide variety of deletion/insertion mutations. ZFN-modified founders faithfully transmitted their genetic changes to the next generation along with the severe combined immune deficiency phenotype.The efficient and rapid generation of gene knockout rats shows that using ZFN technology is a new strategy for creating gene-targeted rat models of human diseases. In addition, the X-SCID rats that were established in this study will be valuable in vivo tools for evaluating drug treatment or gene therapy as well as model systems for examining the treatment of xenotransplanted malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2093707751,"We show in bryophytes that abscisic acid (ABA) pretreatment of moss (Physcomitrella patens) cells confers desiccation tolerance. In angiosperms, both ABA and the transcriptional regulator ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 3 (ABI3) are required to protect the seed during desiccation. ABA was not able to protect moss cells in stable deletion lines of ABI3 (DeltaPpabi3). Hence, moss has the same functional link between ABA, ABI3, and the desiccation tolerance phenotype that is found in angiosperms. Furthermore, we identified 22 genes that were induced during ABA pretreatment in wild-type lines. When their expression was compared with that of DeltaPpabi3 during ABA pretreatment and immediately after desiccation, a new target of ABI3 action appears to be in the recovery period."
https://openalex.org/W2022165424,"Vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) generates vitamin K hydroquinone to sustain gamma-carboxylation of many blood coagulation factors. Here, we report the 3.6 A crystal structure of a bacterial homologue of VKOR from Synechococcus sp. The structure shows VKOR in complex with its naturally fused redox partner, a thioredoxin-like domain, and corresponds to an arrested state of electron transfer. The catalytic core of VKOR is a four transmembrane helix bundle that surrounds a quinone, connected through an additional transmembrane segment with the periplasmic thioredoxin-like domain. We propose a pathway for how VKOR uses electrons from cysteines of newly synthesized proteins to reduce a quinone, a mechanism confirmed by in vitro reconstitution of vitamin K-dependent disulphide bridge formation. Our results have implications for the mechanism of the mammalian VKOR and explain how mutations can cause resistance to the VKOR inhibitor warfarin, the most commonly used oral anticoagulant."

https://openalex.org/W2086307439,"In vivo studies suggest that replication forks are arrested by encounters with head-on transcription complexes. Yet, the fate of the replisome and RNA polymerase (RNAP) after a head-on collision is unknown. We found that the Escherichia coli replisome stalls upon collision with a head-on transcription complex, but instead of collapsing, the replication fork remains highly stable and eventually resumes elongation after displacing the RNAP from DNA. We also found that the transcription-repair coupling factor Mfd promotes direct restart of the fork after the collision by facilitating displacement of the RNAP. These findings demonstrate the intrinsic stability of the replication apparatus and a previously unknown role for the transcription-coupled repair pathway in promoting replication past a RNAP block."

Choiniere et al. (p. 571 ; see news story by Stone) now describe a more complete early specimen, dating to about 160 million years ago, which supports the conclusion that Alvarezsauroidea are a basal group of the clade containing both birds and their close theropod relatives. The fossil also helps to reveal the evolution of this group's peculiar forelimb, which includes one enlarged functional finger."

In addition, pharmacodynamic studies on HER2/neu expression levels in response to therapeutic doses of PU-H71 (a specific inhibitor of heat-shock protein 90 [Hsp90]) were conducted.Trastuzumab was functionalized with desferrioxamine B (DFO) and radiolabeled with [(89)Zr]Zr-oxalate at room temperature using modified literature methods. ImmunoPET and biodistribution experiments in female, athymic nu/nu mice bearing sub-cutaneous BT-474 (HER2/neu positive) and/or MDA-MB-468 (HER2/neu negative) tumor xenografts were conducted. The change in (89)Zr-DFO-trastuzumab tissue uptake in response to high- and low-specific-activity formulations and co-administration of PU-H71 was evaluated by biodistribution studies, Western blot analysis and immunoPET. (89)Zr-DFO-trastuzumab radiolabeling proceeded in high radiochemical yield and specific-activity 104.3+/-2.1 MBq/mg (2.82+/-0.05 mCi/mg of mAb). In vitro assays demonstrated >99% radiochemical purity with an immunoreactive fraction of 0.87+/-0.07. In vivo biodistribution experiments revealed high specific BT-474 uptake after 24, 48 and 72 h (64.68+/-13.06%ID/g; 71.71+/-10.35%ID/g and 85.18+/-11.10%ID/g, respectively) with retention of activity for over 120 h. Pre-treatment with PU-H71 was followed by biodistribution studies and immunoPET of (89)Zr-DFO-trastuzumab. Expression levels of HER2/neu were modulated during the first 24 and 48 h post-administration (29.75+/-4.43%ID/g and 41.42+/-3.64%ID/g, respectively). By 72 h radiotracer uptake (73.64+/-12.17%ID/g) and Western blot analysis demonstrated that HER2/neu expression recovered to baseline levels.The results indicate that (89)Zr-DFO-trastuzumab provides quantitative and highly-specific delineation of HER2/neu positive tumors, and has potential to be used to measure the efficacy of long-term treatment with Hsp90 inhibitors, like PU-H71, which display extended pharmacodynamic profiles."

Understanding adsorption on nanotubes and other graphitic materials is key to many sensing and storage applications. Here we show that nanotube resonators offer a powerful new means of investigating fundamental aspects of adsorption on carbon, including the collective behaviour of adsorbed matter and its coupling to the substrate electrons. By monitoring the vibrational resonance frequency in the presence of noble gases, we observe the formation of monolayers on the cylindrical surface and phase transitions within these monolayers, and simultaneous modification of the electrical conductance. The monolayer observations also demonstrate the possibility of studying the fundamental behaviour of matter in cylindrical geometry."

https://openalex.org/W2042659157,"Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) provides pivotal cell survival and differentiation signals during inner ear development throughout evolution. Homozygous mutations of human IGF1 cause syndromic sensorineural deafness, decreased intrauterine and postnatal growth rates, and mental retardation. In the mouse, deficits in IGF-I result in profound hearing loss associated with reduced survival, differentiation and maturation of auditory neurons. Nevertheless, little is known about the molecular basis of IGF-I activity in hearing and deafness.A combination of quantitative RT-PCR, subcellular fractionation and Western blotting, along with in situ hybridization studies show IGF-I and its high affinity receptor to be strongly expressed in the embryonic and postnatal mouse cochlea. The expression of both proteins decreases after birth and in the cochlea of E18.5 embryonic Igf1(-/-) null mice, the balance of the main IGF related signalling pathways is altered, with lower activation of Akt and ERK1/2 and stronger activation of p38 kinase. By comparing the Igf1(-/-) and Igf1(+/+) transcriptomes in E18.5 mouse cochleae using RNA microchips and validating their results, we demonstrate the up-regulation of the FoxM1 transcription factor and the misexpression of the neural progenitor transcription factors Six6 and Mash1 associated with the loss of IGF-I. Parallel, in silico promoter analysis of the genes modulated in conjunction with the loss of IGF-I revealed the possible involvement of MEF2 in cochlear development. E18.5 Igf1(+/+) mouse auditory ganglion neurons showed intense MEF2A and MEF2D nuclear staining and MEF2A was also evident in the organ of Corti. At P15, MEF2A and MEF2D expression were shown in neurons and sensory cells. In the absence of IGF-I, nuclear levels of MEF2 were diminished, indicating less transcriptional MEF2 activity. By contrast, there was an increase in the nuclear accumulation of FoxM1 and a corresponding decrease in the nuclear cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1).We have defined the spatiotemporal expression of elements involved in IGF signalling during inner ear development and reveal novel regulatory mechanisms that are modulated by IGF-I in promoting sensory cell and neural survival and differentiation. These data will help us to understand the molecular bases of human sensorineural deafness associated to deficits in IGF-I."
https://openalex.org/W2089939786,"Sex Avoidance Strategy In metazoans, sex, as a means of reproduction, is almost universal, with popular theories suggesting that the high rate of genome mixing that sex promotes helps protect us from deleterious mutations and/or rapidly evolving parasites. Asexual organisms are both rare and often evolutionarily short-lived. If this rarity is due to failure to deal with parasites, then bdelloid rotifers, which have been abstaining from sex for millions of years, must be able to dodge the parasite bullet in some arrange-other way. Wilson and Sherman (p. 574 ; see the cover) suggest that bdelloid rotifers do so by being both so resistant to desiccation and so amenable to dispersal on the air that their parasites can neither survive such punishing conditions nor spread as far nor as fast, allowing the asexual bdelloids to start afresh in (parasite-free) pastures anew."
https://openalex.org/W2131008301,"In multicellular organisms, the surface barrier is essential for maintaining the internal environment. In mammals, the barrier is the stratum corneum. Fatty acid transport protein 4 (FATP4) is a key factor involved in forming the stratum corneum barrier. Mice lacking Fatp4 display early neonatal lethality with features such as tight, thick, and shiny skin, and a defective skin barrier. These symptoms are strikingly similar to those of a human skin disease called restrictive dermopathy. FATP4 is a member of the FATP family that possesses acyl-CoA synthetase activity for very long chain fatty acids. How Fatp4 contributes to skin barrier function, however, remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we characterized two Caenorhabditis elegans genes, acs-20 and acs-22, that are homologous to mammalian FATPs. Animals with mutant acs-20 exhibited defects in the cuticle barrier, which normally prevents the penetration of small molecules. acs-20 mutant animals also exhibited abnormalities in the cuticle structure, but not in epidermal cell fate or cell integrity. The acs-22 mutants rarely showed a barrier defect, whereas acs-20;acs-22 double mutants had severely disrupted barrier function. Moreover, the barrier defects of acs-20 and acs-20;acs-22 mutants were rescued by acs-20, acs-22, or human Fatp4 transgenes. We further demonstrated that the incorporation of exogenous very long chain fatty acids into sphingomyelin was reduced in acs-20 and acs-22 mutants. These findings indicate that C. elegans Fatp4 homologue(s) have a crucial role in the surface barrier function and this model might be useful for studying the fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying human skin barrier and relevant diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2096904495,"Background We conducted a Phase I dose-escalation trial of ADMVA, a Clade-B'/C-based HIV-1 candidate vaccine expressing env, gag, pol, nef, and tat in a modified vaccinia Ankara viral vector. Sequences were derived from a prevalent circulating HIV-1 recombinant form in Yunnan, China, an area of high HIV incidence. The objective was to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of ADMVA in human volunteers. Methodology/Principal Findings ADMVA or placebo was administered intramuscularly at months 0, 1 and 6 to 50 healthy adult volunteers not at high risk for HIV-1. In each dosage group [1×107 (low), 5×107 (mid), or 2.5×108 pfu (high)] volunteers were randomized in a 3∶1 ratio to receive ADMVA or placebo in a double-blinded design. Subjects were followed for local and systemic reactogenicity, adverse events including cardiac adverse events, and clinical laboratory parameters. Study follow up was 18 months. Humoral immunogenicity was evaluated by anti-gp120 binding ELISA, immunoflourescent staining, and HIV-1 neutralization. Cellular immunogenicity was assessed by a validated IFNγ ELISpot assay and intracellular cytokine staining. Anti-vaccinia binding titers were measured by ELISA. ADMVA was generally well-tolerated, with no vaccine-related serious adverse events or cardiac adverse events. Local or systemic reactogenicity events were reported by 77% and 78% of volunteers, respectively. The majority of events were of mild intensity. The IFNγ ELISpot response rate to any HIV antigen was 0/12 (0%) in the placebo group, 3/12 (25%) in the low dosage group, 6/12 (50%) in the mid dosage group, and 8/13 (62%) in the high dosage group. Responses were often multigenic and occasionally persisted up to one year post vaccination. Antibodies to gp120 were detected in 0/12 (0%), 8/13 (62%), 6/12 (50%) and 10/13 (77%) in the placebo, low, mid, and high dosage groups, respectively. Antibodies persisted up to 12 months after vaccination, with a trend toward agreement with the ability to neutralize HIV-1 SF162 in vitro. Two volunteers mounted antibodies that were able to neutralize clade-matched viruses. Conclusions/Significance ADMVA was well-tolerated and elicited durable humoral and cellular immune responses.

https://openalex.org/W2166577816,"Two groups working independently report the observation of mildly relativistic outflows from seemingly ordinary type Ibc and type Ic supernovae. Soderberg et al. detected luminous radio emission from the type Ibc supernova SN 2009bb, implying an expansion velocity of 0.85 times the speed of light, and a minimum energy comparable to those of the radio afterglows of nearby γ-ray bursts. Paragi et al. observed mildly relativistic expansion (at 0.6 times the speed of light or more) for a small fraction of the ejecta from the type Ic supernova SN2007gr. These discoveries are relevant to the long-standing question of what makes a small fraction of supernova explosions eject material at relativistic speeds, producing the γ-ray bursts characteristic of the explosion of a massive star. Soderberg et al. conclude that only about 1% of type Ibc supernovae harbour central engines and Paragi et al. that most or all type Ic supernovae produce mildly relativistic jets, but as they account for only a small fraction of the total energy, they are very hard to detect. Type Ic supernovae have drawn attention since 1998 owing to their sparse association with long duration γ-ray bursts (GRBs). Although the GRB central engine generates ultra-relativistic jets, no relativistic outflows have yet been found in type Ib/c supernovae explosions. Here, radio observations reveal a mildly relativistic expansion in a nearby type Ic supernova, SN 2007gr. The class of type Ic supernovae have drawn increasing attention since 1998 owing to their sparse association (only four so far) with long duration γ-ray bursts (GRBs)1,2,3,4. Although both phenomena originate from the core collapse of a massive star, supernovae emit mostly at optical wavelengths, whereas GRBs emit mostly in soft γ-rays or hard X-rays. Though the GRB central engine generates ultra-relativistic jets, which beam the early emission into a narrow cone, no relativistic outflows have hitherto been found in type Ib/c supernovae explosions, despite theoretical expectations5,6,7 and searches8. Here we report radio (interferometric) observations that reveal a mildly relativistic expansion in a nearby type Ic supernova, SN 2007gr. Using two observational epochs 60 days apart, we detect expansion of the source and establish a conservative lower limit for the average apparent expansion velocity of 0.6c. Independently, a second mildly relativistic supernova has been reported9. Contrary to the radio data, optical observations10,11,12,13 of SN 2007gr indicate a typical type Ic supernova with ejecta velocities ∼6,000 km s-1, much lower than in GRB-associated supernovae. We conclude that in SN 2007gr a small fraction of the ejecta produced a low-energy mildly relativistic bipolar radio jet, while the bulk of the ejecta were slower and, as shown by optical spectropolarimetry14, mildly aspherical."
https://openalex.org/W2057487103,"We conducted a Phase I dose escalation trial of ADVAX, a DNA-based candidate HIV-1 vaccine expressing Clade C/B' env, gag, pol, nef, and tat genes. Sequences were derived from a prevalent circulating recombinant form in Yunnan, China, an area of high HIV-1 incidence. The objective was to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of ADVAX in human volunteers.ADVAX or placebo was administered intramuscularly at months 0, 1 and 3 to 45 healthy volunteers not at high risk for HIV-1. Three dosage levels [0.2 mg (low), 1.0 mg (mid), and 4.0 mg (high)] were tested. Twelve volunteers in each dosage group were assigned to receive ADVAX and three to receive placebo in a double-blind design. Subjects were followed for local and systemic reactogenicity, adverse events, and clinical laboratory parameters. Study follow up was 18 months. Humoral immunogenicity was evaluated by anti-gp120 binding ELISA. Cellular immunogenicity was assessed by a validated IFNgamma ELISpot assay and intracellular cytokine staining. ADVAX was safe and well-tolerated, with no vaccine-related serious adverse events. Local and systemic reactogenicity events were reported by 64% and 42% of vaccine recipients, respectively. The majority of events were mild. The IFNgamma ELISpot response rates to any HIV antigen were 0/9 (0%) in the placebo group, 3/12 (25%) in the low-dosage group, 4/12 (33%) in the mid-dosage group, and 2/12 (17%) in the high-dosage group. Overall, responses were generally transient and occurred to each gene product, although volunteers responded to single antigens only. Binding antibodies to gp120 were not detected in any volunteers, and HIV seroconversion did not occur.ADVAX delivered intramuscularly is safe, well-tolerated, and elicits modest but transient cellular immune responses.Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00249106."
https://openalex.org/W1971887681,"Voltage-gated ion channels are main players involved in fast synaptic events. However, only slow intracellular mechanisms have so far been described for controlling their localization as real-time visualization of endogenous voltage-gated channels at high temporal and spatial resolution has not been achieved yet. Using a specific extracellular antibody and quantum dots we reveal and characterize lateral mobility as a faster mechanism to dynamically control the number of endogenous ether-a-go-go (Eag)1 ion channels inside synapses. We visualize Eag1 entering and leaving synapses by lateral diffusion in the plasma membrane of rat hippocampal neurons. Mathematical analysis of their trajectories revealed how the motion of Eag1 gets restricted when the channels diffuse into the synapse, suggesting molecular interactions between Eag1 and synaptic components. In contrast, Eag1 channels switch to Brownian movement when they exit synapses and diffuse into extrasynaptic membranes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the mobility of Eag1 channels is specifically regulated inside synapses by actin filaments, microtubules and electrical activity. In summary, using single-particle-tracking techniques with quantum dots nanocrystals, our study shows for the first time the lateral diffusion of an endogenous voltage-gated ion channel in neurons. The location-dependent constraints imposed by cytoskeletal elements together with the regulatory role of electrical activity strongly suggest a pivotal role for the mobility of voltage-gated ion channels in synaptic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2048155677,"T cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TC-PTP / PTPN2) is an enzyme that is essential for the proper functioning of the immune system and that participates in the control of cell proliferation, and inflammation. We previously observed that TC-PTP−/− mice display various immunodeficiencies, hypersensitivity to LPS and die within three weeks of birth due to anemia and widespread inflammation. A recent analysis of the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCC) genome wide scan data, reported in 2007, indicated a potential role for TC-PTP in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To further investigate the potential role of TC-PTP in IBD, we studied heterozygous TC-PTP mutant mice challenged with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in their drinking water. In comparison to control animals, we observed significant changes in the colon mucosa of DSS-treated TC-PTP+/− mice, in the ratio of colon to body weight, as well as an up-regulation of mRNA transcripts for IL-6, IL-23, 1L-12β, IFN-γ, TNF-α. Moreover, up-regulation of serum IL-6 levels in DSS-treated TC-PTP+/− mice confirms that mice with a single copy of the TC-PTP gene display increased susceptibility to systemic inflammation due to bowel epithelial erosion resulting from DSS challenge. Our findings support the lack of modulation of Janus kinases 1 and 3 (Jak1, Jak3), and the downstream signal transducer and activator of transcription 1,3 and 5 (Stat1, Stat3, Stat 5) by PTPN2 in the development of IBD like condition. Pathological and molecular analysis reveal that the deficiency of TC-PTP results in pro-inflammatory condition in the bowel of heterozygous TC-PTP+/− mice. These novel findings in TC-PTP hemi-deficiency support the hypothesis that TC-PTP is an important regulator of inflammatory cytokine signaling and that it may be implicated in the pathophysiology of IBD."
https://openalex.org/W2141314730,"Over the past three decades, populations of the dominant shallow water Caribbean corals, Acropora cervicornis and A. palmata, have been devastated by white-band disease (WBD), resulting in the listing of both species as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. A key to conserving these threatened corals is understanding how their populations are genetically interconnected throughout the greater Caribbean. Genetic research has demonstrated that gene flow is regionally restricted across the Caribbean in both species. Yet, despite being an important site of coral reef research, little genetic data has been available for the Florida Acropora, especially for the staghorn coral, A. cervicornis. In this study, we present new mitochondrial DNA sequence data from 52 A. cervicornis individuals from 22 sites spread across the upper and lower Florida Keys, which suggest that Florida's A. cervicornis populations are highly genetically interconnected (FST = −0.081). Comparison between Florida and existing mtDNA data from six regional Caribbean populations indicates that Florida possesses high levels of standing genetic diversity (h = 0.824) relative to the rest of the greater Caribbean (h = 0.701±0.043). We find that the contemporary level of gene flow across the greater Caribbean, including Florida, is restricted ( = 0.117), but evidence from shared haplotypes suggests the Western Caribbean has historically been a source of genetic variation for Florida. Despite the current patchiness of A. cervicornis in Florida, the relatively high genetic diversity and connectivity within Florida suggest that this population may have sufficient genetic variation to be viable and resilient to environmental perturbation and disease. Limited genetic exchange across regional populations of the greater Caribbean, including Florida, indicates that conservation efforts for A. cervicornis should focus on maintaining and managing populations locally rather than relying on larval inputs from elsewhere."
https://openalex.org/W1968292163,"Background Friedreich ataxia is a neurodegenerative disease caused by the lack of frataxin, a mitochondrial protein. We previously demonstrated that frataxin interacts with complex II subunits of the electronic transport chain (ETC) and putative electronic transfer flavoproteins, suggesting that frataxin could participate in the oxidative phosphorylation. Methods and Findings Here we have investigated the effect of riboflavin and its cofactors flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans models of frataxin deficiency. We used a S. cerevisiae strain deleted for the yfh1 gene obtained by homologous recombination and we assessed growth in fermentable and non-fermentable cultures supplemented with either riboflavin or its derivates. Experiments with C. elegans were performed in transient knock-down worms (frh-1[RNAi]) generated by microinjection of dsRNA frh-1 into the gonads of young worms. We observed that FAD rescues the phenotype of both defective organisms. We show that cell growth and enzymatic activities of the ETC complexes and ATP production of yfh1Δ cells were improved by FAD supplementation. Moreover, FAD also improved lifespan and other physiological parameters in the C. elegans knock-down model for frataxin. Conclusions/Significance We propose that rescue of frataxin deficiency by FAD supplementation could be explained by an improvement in mitochondrial respiration. We suggest that riboflavin may be useful in the treatment of Friedreich ataxia."
https://openalex.org/W1985629065,"The plasticity in the medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC) of rodents or lateral prefrontal cortex in non human primates (lPFC), plays a key role neural circuits involved in learning and memory. Several genes, like brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cAMP response element binding (CREB), Synapsin I, Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CamKII), activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc), c-jun and c-fos have been related to plasticity processes. We analysed differential expression of related plasticity genes and immediate early genes in the mPFC of rats during learning an operant conditioning task. Incompletely and completely trained animals were studied because of the distinct events predicted by our computational model at different learning stages. During learning an operant conditioning task, we measured changes in the mRNA levels by Real-Time RT-PCR during learning; expression of these markers associated to plasticity was incremented while learning and such increments began to decline when the task was learned. The plasticity changes in the lPFC during learning predicted by the model matched up with those of the representative gene BDNF. Herein, we showed for the first time that plasticity in the mPFC in rats during learning of an operant conditioning is higher while learning than when the task is learned, using an integrative approach of a computational model and gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2090586041,"Background Endochondral ossification, the process through which long bones are formed, involves chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophic differentiation in the cartilage growth plate. In a previous publication we showed that pharmacological inhibition of the PI3K signaling pathway results in reduced endochondral bone growth, and in particular, shortening of the hypertrophic zone in a tibia organ culture system. In this current study we aimed to investigate targets of the PI3K signaling pathway in hypertrophic chondrocytes. Methodology/Principal Findings Through the intersection of two different microarray analyses methods (classical single gene analysis and GSEA) and two different chondrocyte differentiation systems (primary chondrocytes treated with a pharmacological inhibitor of PI3K and microdissected growth plates), we were able to identify a high number of genes grouped in GSEA functional categories regulated by the PI3K signaling pathway. Genes such as Phlda2 and F13a1 were down-regulated upon PI3K inhibition and showed increased expression in the hypertrophic zone compared to the proliferative/resting zone of the growth plate. In contrast, other genes including Nr4a1 and Adamts5 were up-regulated upon PI3K inhibition and showed reduced expression in the hypertrophic zone. Regulation of these genes by PI3K signaling was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. We focused on F13a1 as an interesting target because of its known role in chondrocyte hypertrophy and osteoarthritis. Mouse E15.5 tibiae cultured with LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) for 6 days showed decreased expression of factor XIIIa in the hypertrophic zone compared to control cultures. Conclusions/Significance Discovering targets of signaling pathways in hypertrophic chondrocytes could lead to targeted therapy in osteoarthritis and a better understanding of the cartilage environment for tissue engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2071335889,"Background Feeding innovation occurs when individuals choose a novel, unknown type of food and/or acquire new feeding skills. Here we studied feeding innovation and social transmission of the new feeding habit in canaries. Adult canaries eat a wide variety of seeds but avoid larger ones such as those of sunflowers. We determined whether adults of both sexes are equally prone to innovate when confronted with sunflower seeds and whether free-interactions facilitate transmission of the new feeding habit in a sex-dependent manner. Methodology/Principal Findings First we determined which sex was more innovative, i.e., was more successful at husking and eating the novel seeds. Males were clearly more innovative than females. Due to this, experienced males served as model for either male or female observers in three different conditions (free interaction with a demonstrator, visual interaction with a demonstrator placed behind a transparent wall and access to seeds in the presence of a non-demonstrating bird). During free interactions, the new feeding habit was only transmitted to females. In contrast, transmission of seed handling to male observers only occurred if demonstrator and observer were separated by the transparent wall. Indeed, aggressive behaviors between males prevented social transmission during free interactions. Finally, we studied the influence of the less innovative females in feeding-habit transmission. First, we obtained female demonstrators by making them freely interact with male demonstrators. Once they acquired innovative responses to sunflower seeds we studied feeding-habit transmission towards male and female observers. Observers of both sexes learned during free interactions with female demonstrators. No aggressive behavior occurred. Males were also able to learn after visual interactions with the female demonstrator. Conclusions/Significance Our results show that the most innovative individuals (males) are not always the best demonstrators, and that social relationship and sex are crucial factors for the spread of a new feeding habit among canaries. These factors determine the kind of interaction between individuals and the time spent together, thus affecting the transmission of novel habits within the population."

https://openalex.org/W2159259066,"Many diseases are believed to be related to abnormal protein folding. In the first step of such pathogenic structural changes, misfolding occurs in regions important for the stability of the native structure. This destabilizes the normal protein conformation, while exposing the previously hidden aggregation-prone regions, leading to subsequent errors in the folding pathway. Sites involved in this first stage can be deemed switch regions of the protein, and can represent perfect binding targets for drugs to block the abnormal folding pathway and prevent pathogenic conformational changes. In this study, a prediction algorithm for the switch regions responsible for the start of pathogenic structural changes is introduced. With an accuracy of 94%, this algorithm can successfully find short segments covering sites significant in triggering conformational diseases (CDs) and is the first that can predict switch regions for various CDs. To illustrate its effectiveness in dealing with urgent public health problems, the reason of the increased pathogenicity of H5N1 influenza virus is analyzed; the mechanisms of the pandemic swine-origin 2009 A(H1N1) influenza virus in overcoming species barriers and in infecting large number of potential patients are also suggested. It is shown that the algorithm is a potential tool useful in the study of the pathology of CDs because: (1) it can identify the origin of pathogenic structural conversion with high sensitivity and specificity, and (2) it provides an ideal target for clinical treatment."
