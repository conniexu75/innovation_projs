https://openalex.org/W1972483153,"The inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis is well established but the agent(s) that incite inflammation in the artery wall remain largely unknown. Germ-free animals are susceptible to atherosclerosis, suggesting that endogenous substances initiate the inflammation. Mature atherosclerotic lesions contain macroscopic deposits of cholesterol crystals in the necrotic core, but their appearance late in atherogenesis had been thought to disqualify them as primary inflammatory stimuli. However, using a new microscopic technique, we revealed that minute cholesterol crystals are present in early diet-induced atherosclerotic lesions and that their appearance in mice coincides with the first appearance of inflammatory cells. Other crystalline substances can induce inflammation by stimulating the caspase-1-activating NLRP3 (NALP3 or cryopyrin) inflammasome, which results in cleavage and secretion of interleukin (IL)-1 family cytokines. Here we show that cholesterol crystals activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in phagocytes in vitro in a process that involves phagolysosomal damage. Similarly, when injected intraperitoneally, cholesterol crystals induce acute inflammation, which is impaired in mice deficient in components of the NLRP3 inflammasome, cathepsin B, cathepsin L or IL-1 molecules. Moreover, when mice deficient in low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) were bone-marrow transplanted with NLRP3-deficient, ASC (also known as PYCARD)-deficient or IL-1alpha/beta-deficient bone marrow and fed on a high-cholesterol diet, they had markedly decreased early atherosclerosis and inflammasome-dependent IL-18 levels. Minimally modified LDL can lead to cholesterol crystallization concomitant with NLRP3 inflammasome priming and activation in macrophages. Although there is the possibility that oxidized LDL activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in vivo, our results demonstrate that crystalline cholesterol acts as an endogenous danger signal and its deposition in arteries or elsewhere is an early cause rather than a late consequence of inflammation. These findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and indicate new potential molecular targets for the therapy of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2155069722,"Climate change does not occur uniformly around the world: instead, in a process called polar amplification, the Arctic warms more rapidly than the tropics or mid-latitudes. Recent work published in Nature suggested that upper-atmospheric transport processes accounted for much of the recent polar amplification, but this conclusion proved controversial. Using updated reanalysis data from the past two decades, James Screen and Ian Simmonds now show that reductions in sea ice cover and thickness, rather than upper atmosphere processes, are responsible for most of the recent polar amplification. These findings reinforce suggestions that strong positive ice–temperature feedbacks are at work in the Arctic, and suggest that rapid warming and sea ice melting are likely to continue in the near future. Climate change does not occur symmetrically; instead, in a process called polar amplification, polar areas warm faster than the tropics. Recent work indicated that transport processes in the upper atmosphere account for much of the recent polar amplification, but this conclusion proved controversial. Here, updated reanalysis data have been used to show that reductions in sea ice are instead responsible. The rise in Arctic near-surface air temperatures has been almost twice as large as the global average in recent decades1,2,3—a feature known as ‘Arctic amplification’. Increased concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases have driven Arctic and global average warming1,4; however, the underlying causes of Arctic amplification remain uncertain. The roles of reductions in snow and sea ice cover5,6,7 and changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation8,9,10, cloud cover and water vapour11,12 are still matters of debate. A better understanding of the processes responsible for the recent amplified warming is essential for assessing the likelihood, and impacts, of future rapid Arctic warming and sea ice loss13,14. Here we show that the Arctic warming is strongest at the surface during most of the year and is primarily consistent with reductions in sea ice cover. Changes in cloud cover, in contrast, have not contributed strongly to recent warming. Increases in atmospheric water vapour content, partly in response to reduced sea ice cover, may have enhanced warming in the lower part of the atmosphere during summer and early autumn. We conclude that diminishing sea ice has had a leading role in recent Arctic temperature amplification. The findings reinforce suggestions that strong positive ice–temperature feedbacks have emerged in the Arctic15, increasing the chances of further rapid warming and sea ice loss, and will probably affect polar ecosystems, ice-sheet mass balance and human activities in the Arctic2."
https://openalex.org/W2121627664,"A phase transition describes the sudden change of state in a physical system, such as the transition between a fluid and a solid. Quantum gases provide the opportunity to establish a direct link between experiment and generic models which capture the underlying physics. A fundamental concept to describe the collective matter-light interaction is the Dicke model which has been predicted to show an intriguing quantum phase transition. Here we realize the Dicke quantum phase transition in an open system formed by a Bose-Einstein condensate coupled to an optical cavity, and observe the emergence of a self-organized supersolid phase. The phase transition is driven by infinitely long-ranged interactions between the condensed atoms. These are induced by two-photon processes involving the cavity mode and a pump field. We show that the phase transition is described by the Dicke Hamiltonian, including counter-rotating coupling terms, and that the supersolid phase is associated with a spontaneously broken spatial symmetry. The boundary of the phase transition is mapped out in quantitative agreement with the Dicke model. The work opens the field of quantum gases with long-ranged interactions, and provides access to novel quantum phases."

https://openalex.org/W2049836150,"The nucleolytic activity of animal Argonaute proteins is deeply conserved, despite its having no obvious role in microRNA-directed gene regulation. In mice, Ago2 (also known as Eif2c2) is uniquely required for viability, and only this family member retains catalytic competence. To investigate the evolutionary pressure to conserve Argonaute enzymatic activity, we engineered a mouse with catalytically inactive Ago2 alleles. Homozygous mutants died shortly after birth with an obvious anaemia. Examination of microRNAs and their potential targets revealed a loss of miR-451, a small RNA important for erythropoiesis. Though this microRNA is processed by Drosha (also known as Rnasen), its maturation does not require Dicer. Instead, the pre-miRNA becomes loaded into Ago and is cleaved by the Ago catalytic centre to generate an intermediate 3' end, which is then further trimmed. Our findings link the conservation of Argonaute catalysis to a conserved mechanism of microRNA biogenesis that is important for vertebrate development."

https://openalex.org/W2066603745,"Ultracold polar molecules offer the possibility of exploring quantum gases with interparticle interactions that are strong, long-range, and spatially anisotropic. This is in stark contrast to the dilute gases of ultracold atoms, which have isotropic and extremely short-range, or ""contact"", interactions. The large electric dipole moment of polar molecules can be tuned with an external electric field; this provides unique opportunities such as control of ultracold chemical reactions, quantum information processing, and the realization of novel quantum many-body systems. In spite of intense experimental efforts aimed at observing the influence of dipoles on ultracold molecules, only recently have sufficiently high densities been achieved. Here, we report the observation of dipolar collisions in an ultracold molecular gas prepared close to quantum degeneracy. For modest values of an applied electric field, we observe a dramatic increase in the loss rate of fermionic KRb molecules due to ultrcold chemical reactions. We find that the loss rate has a steep power-law dependence on the induced electric dipole moment, and we show that this dependence can be understood with a relatively simple model based on quantum threshold laws for scattering of fermionic polar molecules. We directly observe the spatial anisotropy of the dipolar interaction as manifested in measurements of the thermodynamics of the dipolar gas. These results demonstrate how the long-range dipolar interaction can be used for electric-field control of chemical reaction rates in an ultracold polar molecule gas. The large loss rates in an applied electric field suggest that creating a long-lived ensemble of ultracold polar molecules may require confinement in a two-dimensional trap geometry to suppress the influence of the attractive dipolar interactions."

https://openalex.org/W1970851569,"Dynamin is an atypical GTPase that catalyses membrane fission during clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The mechanisms of dynamin's basal and assembly-stimulated GTP hydrolysis are unknown, though both are indirectly influenced by the GTPase effector domain (GED). Here we present the 2.0 A resolution crystal structure of a human dynamin 1-derived minimal GTPase-GED fusion protein, which was dimeric in the presence of the transition state mimic GDP.AlF(4)(-).The structure reveals dynamin's catalytic machinery and explains how assembly-stimulated GTP hydrolysis is achieved through G domain dimerization. A sodium ion present in the active site suggests that dynamin uses a cation to compensate for the developing negative charge in the transition state in the absence of an arginine finger. Structural comparison to the rat dynamin G domain reveals key conformational changes that promote G domain dimerization and stimulated hydrolysis. The structure of the GTPase-GED fusion protein dimer provides insight into the mechanisms underlying dynamin-catalysed membrane fission."
https://openalex.org/W2059262955,"Horizontal transfer (HT), or the passage of genetic material between non-mating species, is increasingly recognized as an important force in the evolution of eukaryotic genomes. Transposons, with their inherent ability to mobilize and amplify within genomes, may be especially prone to HT. However, the means by which transposons can spread across widely diverged species remain elusive. Here we present evidence that host-parasite interactions have promoted the HT of four transposon families between invertebrates and vertebrates. We found that Rhodnius prolixus, a triatomine bug feeding on the blood of various tetrapods and vector of Chagas' disease in humans, carries in its genome four distinct transposon families that also invaded the genomes of a diverse, but overlapping, set of tetrapods. The bug transposons are approximately 98% identical and cluster phylogenetically with those of the opossum and squirrel monkey, two of its preferred mammalian hosts in South America. We also identified one of these transposon families in the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis, a cosmopolitan vector of trematodes infecting diverse vertebrates, whose ancestral sequence is nearly identical and clusters with those found in Old World mammals. Together these data provide evidence for a previously hypothesized role of host-parasite interactions in facilitating HT among animals. Furthermore, the large amount of DNA generated by the amplification of the horizontally transferred transposons supports the idea that the exchange of genetic material between hosts and parasites influences their genomic evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1978743770,"The GTPase dynamin catalyses the scission of clathrin-coated pits at the plasma membrane, but the mechanisms of dynamin-mediated membrane fission remain poorly understood. Here, Gao et al. study a dynamin-like GTPase called MxA, which plays an important role in innate immune responses. They present the crystal structure of the stalk region of MxA that is composed of the middle domain and the GTPase effector domain (GED). A structural model of MxA oligomerization and stimulated GTP hydrolysis is presented, which has functional implications for all members of the dynamin family. Dynamin is a protein that catalyses the scission of clathrin-coated pits at the plasma membrane. The mechanisms of dynamin-catalysed scission remain poorly understood. Here, the structure of the stalk region of human MxA, a dynamin-like protein, is presented. A structural model of MxA oligomerization and stimulated GTP hydrolysis is put forward that has functional implications for all members of the dynamin family. The interferon-inducible dynamin-like myxovirus resistance protein 1 (MxA; also called MX1) GTPase is a key mediator of cell-autonomous innate immunity against pathogens such as influenza viruses1. MxA partially localizes to COPI-positive membranes of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum–Golgi intermediate compartment2. At the point of infection, it redistributes to sites of viral replication and promotes missorting of essential viral constituents3,4. It has been proposed that the middle domain and the GTPase effector domain of dynamin-like GTPases constitute a stalk that mediates oligomerization and transmits conformational changes from the G domain to the target structure5,6,7; however, the molecular architecture of this stalk has remained elusive. Here we report the crystal structure of the stalk of human MxA, which folds into a four-helical bundle. This structure tightly oligomerizes in the crystal in a criss-cross pattern involving three distinct interfaces and one loop. Mutations in each of these interaction sites interfere with native assembly, oligomerization, membrane binding and antiviral activity of MxA. On the basis of these results, we propose a structural model for dynamin oligomerization and stimulated GTP hydrolysis that is consistent with previous structural predictions and has functional implications for all members of the dynamin family."
https://openalex.org/W2077798795,"Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase (PIKK) family and is a major regulator of translation, cell growth, and autophagy. mTOR exists in two distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, that differ in their subunit composition. In this study, we identified KIAA0406 as a novel mTOR-interacting protein. Because it has sequence homology with Schizosaccharomyces pombe Tti1, we named it mammalian Tti1. Tti1 constitutively interacts with mTOR in both mTORC1 and mTORC2. Knockdown of Tti1 suppresses phosphorylation of both mTORC1 substrates (S6K1 and 4E-BP1) and an mTORC2 substrate (Akt) and also induces autophagy. S. pombe Tti1 binds to Tel2, a protein whose mammalian homolog was recently reported to regulate the stability of PIKKs. We confirmed that Tti1 binds to Tel2 also in mammalian cells, and Tti1 interacts with and stabilizes all six members of the PIKK family of proteins (mTOR, ATM, ATR, DNA-PKcs, SMG-1, and TRRAP). Furthermore, using immunoprecipitation and size-exclusion chromatography analyses, we found that knockdown of either Tti1 or Tel2 causes disassembly of mTORC1 and mTORC2. These results indicate that Tti1 and Tel2 are important not only for mTOR stability but also for assembly of the mTOR complexes to maintain their activities."
https://openalex.org/W2100328448,"Protected areas are fundamental to biodiversity conservation, but there is growing recognition of the need to extend beyond protected areas to meet the ecological requirements of species at larger scales. Landscape-scale conservation requires an evaluation of management impact on biodiversity under different land-use strategies; this is challenging and there exist few empirical studies. In a conservation landscape in northern Republic of Congo we demonstrate the application of a large-scale monitoring program designed to evaluate the impact of conservation interventions on three globally threatened species: western gorillas, chimpanzees and forest elephants, under three land-use types: integral protection, commercial logging, and community-based natural resource management. We applied distance-sampling methods to examine species abundance across different land-use types under varying degrees of management and human disturbance. We found no clear trends in abundance between land-use types. However, units with interventions designed to reduce poaching and protect habitats--irrespective of land-use type--harboured all three species at consistently higher abundance than a neighbouring logging concession undergoing no wildlife management. We applied Generalized-Additive Models to evaluate a priori predictions of species response to different landscape processes. Our results indicate that, given adequate protection from poaching, elephants and gorillas can profit from herbaceous vegetation in recently logged forests and maintain access to ecologically important resources located outside of protected areas. However, proximity to the single integrally protected area in the landscape maintained an overriding positive influence on elephant abundance, and logging roads--even subject to anti-poaching controls--were exploited by elephant poachers and had a major negative influence on elephant distribution. Chimpanzees show a clear preference for unlogged or more mature forests and human disturbance had a negative influence on chimpanzee abundance, in spite of anti-poaching interventions. We caution against the pitfalls of missing and confounded co-variables in model-based estimation approaches and highlight the importance of spatial scale in the response of different species to landscape processes. We stress the importance of a stratified design-based approach to monitoring species status in response to conservation interventions and advocate a holistic framework for landscape-scale monitoring that includes smaller-scale targeted research and punctual assessment of threats."

https://openalex.org/W2164276007,"We have previously identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase-inducible degrader of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) (Idol) as a post-translational modulator of LDLR levels. Idol is a direct target for regulation by liver X receptors (LXRs), and its expression is responsive to cellular sterol status independent of the sterol-response element-binding proteins. Here we demonstrate that Idol also targets two closely related LDLR family members, VLDLR and ApoE receptor 2 (ApoER2), proteins implicated in both neuronal development and lipid metabolism. Idol triggers ubiquitination of the VLDLR and ApoER2 on their cytoplasmic tails, leading to their degradation. We further show that the level of endogenous VLDLR is sensitive to cellular sterol content, Idol expression, and activation of the LXR pathway. Pharmacological activation of the LXR pathway in mice leads to increased Idol expression and to decreased Vldlr levels in vivo. Finally, we establish an unexpected functional link between LXR and Reelin signaling. We demonstrate that LXR activation results in decreased Reelin binding to VLDLR and reduced Dab1 phosphorylation. The identification of VLDLR and ApoER2 as Idol targets suggests potential roles for this LXR-inducible E3 ligase in the central nervous system in addition to lipid metabolism."

In this study, we performed a comprehensive detection of potential pathogens by de novo sequencing using a next-generation DNA sequencer on total RNAs extracted from an autopsy lung of a patient who died of viral pneumonia with A/H1N1/2009. Among a total of 9.4×106 40-mer short reads, more than 98% appeared to be human, while 0.85% were identified as A/H1N1/2009 (A/Nagano/RC1-L/2009(H1N1)). Suspected bacterial reads such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and other oral bacteria flora were very low at 0.005%, and a significant bacterial infection was not histologically observed. De novo assembly and read mapping analysis of A/Nagano/RC1-L/2009(H1N1) showed more than ×200 coverage on average, and revealed nucleotide heterogeneity on hemagglutinin as quasispecies, specifically at two amino acids (Gly172Glu and Gly239Asn of HA) located on the Sa and Ca2 antigenic sites, respectively. Gly239 and Asn239 on antigenic site Ca2 appeared to be minor amino acids compared with the highly distributed Asp239 in H1N1 HAs. This study demonstrated that de novo sequencing can comprehensively detect pathogens, and such in-depth investigation facilitates the identification of influenza A viral heterogeneity. To better characterize the A/H1N1/2009 virus, unbiased comprehensive techniques will be indispensable for the primary investigations of emerging infectious diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2053021047,"Heme is a required prosthetic group in many electron transfer proteins and redox enzymes. The human BK channel, which is a large-conductance Ca2+ and voltage-activated K+ channel, is involved in the hypoxic response in the carotid body. The BK channel has been shown to bind and undergo inhibition by heme and activation by CO. Furthermore, evidence suggests that human heme oxygenase-2 (HO2) acts as an oxygen sensor and CO donor that can form a protein complex with the BK channel. Here we describe a thiol/disulfide redox switch in the human BK channel and biochemical experiments of heme, CO, and HO2 binding to a 134-residue region within the cytoplasmic domain of the channel. This region, called the heme binding domain (HBD) forms a linker segment between two Ca2+-sensing domains (called RCK1 and RCK2) of the BK channel. The HBD includes a CXXCH motif in which histidine serves as the axial heme ligand and the two cysteine residues can form a reversible thiol/disulfide redox switch that regulates affinity of the HBD for heme. The reduced dithiol state binds heme (Kd = 210 nm) 14-fold more tightly than the oxidized disulfide state. Furthermore, the HBD is shown to tightly bind CO (Kd = 50 nm) with the Cys residues in the CXXCH motif regulating affinity of the HBD for CO. This HBD is also shown to interact with heme oxygenase-2. We propose that the thiol/disulfide switch in the HBD is a mechanism by which activity of the BK channel can respond quickly and reversibly to changes in the redox state of the cell, especially as it switches between hypoxic and normoxic conditions.

IntroductionLarge-conductance Ca2+ and voltage-activated K+ channels, also known as Slo or BK channels, play important roles in many physiological phenomena, including oxygen sensing, vasodilation, synaptic transmission, and hormone secretion (1Salkoff L.

Physiology. 2009; 24: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In the carotid body, the BK channel was found to be involved in the hypoxic response (3Liu H. Moczydlowski E. Haddad G.G. J.

BK channels (for big K+) have the largest single-channel conductance of all K+-selective channels and are activated synergistically by intracellular Ca2+ and membrane potential (1Salkoff L. Butler A. Ferreira G. Santi C. Wei A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 921-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 5Cui J. Yang H. Lee U.S. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66: 852-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). When open, K+ efflux by the BK channel hyperpolarizes the cell membrane potential. Like other voltage-gated K+ channels, the human BK channel complex is composed of four pore-forming α (Slo1) subunits that contain transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions (6Lu R. Alioua A. Kumar Y. Eghbali M. Stefani E. Toro L. J. Physiol. 2006; 570: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Each α subunit includes a seven-helix transmembrane segment (S0) and a voltage-sensing domain (S1–S4) and contributes one-fourth of the ion conduction pore (S5–S6) (7Adelman J.P. Shen K.Z.

At the C-terminal end of the BK channel, there is a large more than 700-residue cytoplasmic region, which contains two homologous domains termed “regulators of conductance of potassium” (RCK1 and RCK2) 2The abbreviations used are: RCKregulators of conductance of potassiumHO2heme oxygenase-2DTTdithiothreitolDTNB5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)EPRelectron paramagnetic resonanceHBDheme binding domainHBPheme-binding peptideZnPPzinc protoporphyrin. that form a gating ring that is essential for Ca2+ activation of the channel (8Xia X.M.

Res. 2005; 97: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Heme binding under hypoxic conditions strongly inhibits the channel, whereas under normoxic conditions, CO, which is generated by heme oxygenase-2 (HO2) during heme degradation, activates the BK channel. Thus, the substrate (heme) and the product (CO) of heme degradation by HO2 are implied in regulating channel activity. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293 cells overexpressing the BK channel indicate that HO2 can form a complex with the BK channel (15Williams S.E. Wootton P. Mason H.S. Bould J. Iles D.E. Riccardi D. Peers C. Kemp P.J. Science. 2004; 306: 2093-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). In addition, knocking out HO2 expression significantly reduces channel activity (15Williams S.E. Wootton P. Mason H.S. Bould J. Iles D.E. Riccardi D. Peers C. Kemp P.J. Science. 2004; 306: 2093-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar).One of the aims of this work is to further explore the interactions between the BK channel and HO2, heme, and CO. This is significant because both heme and CO serve as signaling molecules in various physiological processes in cells, including circadian rhythm, oxygen utilization, and T cell activation (18Kim H.P. Ryter S.W. Choi A.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2006; 46: 411-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 19Barañano D.E. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 10996-11002Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Although heme degradation in mammals is catalyzed by both the inducible HO1 and the constitutive HO2 isozymes (20Maines M.D. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2005; 7: 1761-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), HO2 is the major isozyme in neural tissues and is the sole CO source in neurons (21Boehning D. Snyder S.H. Science. 2002; 298: 2339-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).The BK channel appears to be unique as a heme-regulated ion channel. A segment that links RCK1 and RCK2 has been implicated in heme binding (14Tang X.D. Xu R. Reynolds M.F. Garcia M.L. Heinemann S.H. Hoshi T. Nature. 2003; 425: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 16Horrigan F.T. Heinemann S.H. Hoshi T. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 7-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This linker region contains a CXXCH (X is any amino acid) motif that is highly conserved in all BK channels, and replacement of the Cys or His residues by Ser or Arg, respectively, abolish the sensitivity of the BK channel to heme and CO (14Tang X.D. Xu R. Reynolds M.F. Garcia M.L. Heinemann S.H. Hoshi T. Nature. 2003; 425: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). CO also binds to the complex between heme and a synthetic 23-residue heme-binding peptide (HBP) containing residues 601–623 of the BK channel and including the CXXCH motif (17Jaggar J.H. Li A.

Mutagenesis studies demonstrate that an Asp and two His residues within the RCK1 domain are required for the stimulatory action of CO on the BK channel, suggesting another layer of regulation (22Hou S. Xu R. Heinemann S.H. Hoshi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 4039-4043Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).In our work described here, a soluble 134-residue linker region, which we refer to as the HBD, between RCK1 and RCK2 was cloned, expressed, and purified to address the heme binding properties of the human BK channel. We characterized the HBD using EPR and UV-visible spectroscopy. Our results demonstrate that His616 in the 612CXXCH615 motif serves as the axial heme ligand. The Cys residues were shown to form a thiol/disulfide redox switch that regulates the affinities of the channel for heme and CO. In this paper, “oxidized” and “reduced” refer to the state of the disulfide bonds of the Cys612-Cys615; the redox state of the iron in the heme will be explicitly identified as Fe3+-heme or Fe2+-heme. Reduction of the disulfide bond in the CXXCH motif enhances the affinity of HBD for heme by ∼14-fold. In addition, replacement of the Cys residues by Ser decreases the CO affinity by over 50-fold. We propose that thiol/disulfide redox modulation of the affinity for heme and CO is one way that the BK channel can rapidly respond to the switch between hypoxic and normoxic conditions.DISCUSSIONThe rapid physiological response to hypoxia is mediated by the carotid body, which is an arterial O2 chemoreceptor organ (34Lopez-Barneo J. Pardal R. Ortega-Sáenz P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 259-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The rapid inhibition of ion channel activity in glomus cells of the carotid body by hypoxia was first demonstrated in 1988 (35López-Barneo J. López-López J.R. Ureña J. González C. Science. 1988; 241: 580-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Under normoxic conditions, the glomus cell membrane is hyperpolarized due to the pumping of K+ through the open BK channel, whereas inhibition of channel activity initiates a wave of depolarization that results in increased ventilation by the lungs (34Lopez-Barneo J. Pardal R. Ortega-Sáenz P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 259-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The involvement of the human BK channel in the physiological responses to hypoxia and the regulation of these responses by heme and CO have been well documented (14Tang X.D. Xu R. Reynolds M.F. Garcia M.L. Heinemann S.H. Hoshi T. Nature. 2003; 425: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 36Kumar P.

Biol. 1996; 410: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Both ferric and ferrous heme inhibit the BK channel, whereas CO stimulates channel activity (16Horrigan F.T. Heinemann S.H. Hoshi T. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 7-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In addition, co-immunoprecipitation experiments and immunocytochemical analyses indicate that HO2 binds directly to the BK channel (15Williams S.E. Wootton P. Mason H.S. Bould J. Iles D.E. Riccardi D. Peers C. Kemp P.J. Science. 2004; 306: 2093-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism(s) by which heme inhibits and CO activates the BK channel in response to hypoxic and normoxic conditions, respectively, remains unclear. Mechanisms by which the functions of HO2 and the BK-channel could be coupled include the direct activation of the BK-channel by CO, regulation of heme availability by HO2 and protein-protein associations. Our results indicate that a thiol/disulfide redox switch in the HBD of the BK channel affects binding of both heme and CO as well as HO2-HBD interactions.Regarding CO activation, two contrasting mechanisms have been recently proposed. Based on the findings that CO affects the binding of Fe2+-heme, but not Fe3+-heme, to the HBD and that mutation of Cys615 and His616 in the CXXCH motif abolish both heme-dependent inhibition and CO-induced activation of the channel, it was proposed that the effects of CO are mediated by binding to heme (17Jaggar J.H. Li A. Parfenova H. Liu J. Umstot E.S. Dopico A.M. Leffler C.W. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). On the other hand, because substitutions of residues (two His and an Asp) in the high-affinity RCK1 high-affinity Ca2+ sensor domain disrupt CO-dependent activation of the BK channel (using the CO donor [Ru(CO)3Cl2]2) without affecting the inhibition by heme, and because substitutions in the CXXCH motif (of His and Cys) disrupt heme binding without abrogating activation by CO, it was suggested that CO directly interacts with the His and Asp residues in the RCK1 domain in a heme-independent manner (22Hou S. Xu R. Heinemann S.H. Hoshi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 4039-4043Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).Our results demonstrate that a thiol/disulfide redox switch in the human BK channel regulates binding of both heme and CO. Previous studies have indicated that Cys residues can affect the regulation and/or activity of the human BK channel. Substitution of Cys911 with Gly decreased the sensitivity of the channel to a CO donor (the tricarbonyldichlororuthenium (II) dimer) by 2-fold; furthermore, cysteine oxidation (39Brazier S.P.

Res. Commun. 2006; 342: 1389-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and reaction of some cysteine-specific reagents, e.g. DTNB, 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate, and p-chloromercuribenzoate (41Tang X.D. Daggett H. Hanner M. Garcia M.L. McManus O.B. Brot N. Weissbach H. Heinemann S.H. Hoshi T. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 253-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), has been reported to decrease BK channel activity. Here we have shown that residues Cys612 and Cys615 in a CXXCH motif between the two RCK domains interconvert between the thiol and disulfide states according to a midpoint reduction potential of −184 mV, whereas the His residue (His616) serves as an axial heme ligand. This arrangement allows robust control of heme binding, such that the dithiol(ate) state of either the HBP or the HBD binds Fe3+-heme 90- or 14-fold tighter, respectively, than the oxidized disulfide form. The Kd value for the complex between the reduced (disulfide) state of the HBD and Fe3+-heme is 0.21 μm, which is similar to the Ki value (∼0.1 μm) for inhibition of the BK channel by Fe(III)-heme (14Tang X.D. Xu R. Reynolds M.F. Garcia M.L. Heinemann S.H. Hoshi T. Nature. 2003; 425: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Importantly, the Kd value for the oxidized HBP of 14.5 μm (or 2.8 μm for the HBD) is well outside the range of intracellular free heme concentrations of 20–100 nm (42Sassa S. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2004; 6: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 43Liu S.C. Zhai S. Palek J. Blood. 1988; 71: 1755-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Garrick M.D. Scott D. Kulju D.

Nutr. 2006; 38: 138-155Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar)). Because the ambient intracellular redox potential ranges from −170 to −325 mV (32Dooley C.T. Dore T.M. Hanson G.T. Jackson W.C. Remington S.J. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22284-22293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 33Jones D.P. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 348: 93-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar), the CXXC motif in the HBD should undergo redox interconversion under physiologically relevant conditions, e.g. normoxia and hypoxia. Therefore, when the HBD converts to the oxidized state, the BK channel would be expected to release its bound heme.Heme and CO elicit opposite effects on activity of the BK channel. Our results indicate that CO interacts directly with heme in the HBD, forming a high affinity Fe2+-CO complex (Kd = 0.05 μm), which could be considered to favor the former of the two mechanisms of CO activation described above (17Jaggar J.H. Li A. Parfenova H. Liu J. Umstot E.S. Dopico A.M. Leffler C.W. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In comparison, the hemes in NPAS2 (Kd = 1 μm) and a bacterial CO sensor (CooA) (Kd = 11 μm) bind CO with significantly lower affinity (47Dioum E.M. Rutter J. Tuckerman J.R. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. McKnight S.L. Science. 2002; 298: 2385-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 48Yamashita T. Hoashi Y. Watanabe K. Tomisugi Y. Ishikawa Y. Uno T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21394-21400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). If the HBD is the sole CO binding site within the BK channel, one possible explanation for the importance of the RCK1 domain in the CO response is that allosteric effects may couple binding of Ca2+ and CO to separate sites. Because it is highly unlikely that CO can bind directly to the implicated amino acid residues (His365, His394, and Asp367) in the RCK1 domain in a metal-independent manner, one possibility is that the His and Asp residues in RCK1 ligate a low-valent metal ion, e.g. Fe2+ or Cu1+, which forms a CO binding site. There is evidence that Zn2+ can activate the BK channel and that His365 and Asp367 are required for this activation, suggesting that these residues can bind metal ions. A large class of metalloenzymes, e.g. oxygenases, contains a 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad motif in which a single metal ion (Zn2+ or Fe2+) is coordinated by two His residues and one Asp (or Glu) in a motif that often consists of HXDXnH (X can be any residue and n represents a variable number of residues) (49Hausinger R.P. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 39: 21-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 50Koehntop K.D. Emerson J.P. Que Jr., L. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2005; 10: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), which matches the sequence in RCK1 (His365-X-Asp367-X22-His394). Although we are unaware of CO binding to the metal center of a protein containing the 2-His-1-carboxylate facial motif, the structure of isopenicillin N synthase has been solved with bound NO (51Roach P.L. Clifton I.J. Hensgens C.M. Shibata N. Schofield C.J. Hajdu J. Baldwin J.E. Nature. 1997; 387: 827-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), a CO analog. If this site does indeed bind Zn2+, being a d10 metal ion, it would not be able to bind CO; however, there are examples of Zn2+ or Fe2+ competing for binding to a metal binding site, e.g. carbonic anhydrase (52Macauley S.R. Zimmerman S.A. Apolinario E.E. Evilia C. Hou Y.M. Ferry J.G. Sowers K.R. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 817-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, further studies are required to clarify the relationship between CO and the potential metal binding sites in the RCK1 domain.As was observed for heme binding, affinity of the HBD-Fe2+-heme for CO appears to be regulated by the CXXC motif. Surprisingly, the affinity of Fe2+-heme in the C612S/C615S variant, which was expected to mimic the reduced protein, is 50-fold weaker than that of the native protein (Kd = 2.68 μm). How Cys612 and Cys615 affect CO binding is unclear. Perhaps one of the Cys residues undergoes ionization, which would alter the microenvironment of the heme in a way that Ser could not. Besides the Cys residues in the CXXCH motif, Cys628 and Cys630 form the other intramolecular disulfide bond in HBD. We have been unable to address the properties of these residues because the single and double (C628S/C630S) variants were unable to be purified, suggesting that these residues may play a structural role.The results of our intrinsic fluorescence quenching experiments indicate that the HBD interacts directly with HO2. These results support earlier co-immunoprecipitation and immunocytochemical analyses indicating that HO2 binds directly to the BK channel (15Williams S.E. Wootton P. Mason H.S. Bould J. Iles D.E. Riccardi D. Peers C. Kemp P.J. Science. 2004; 306: 2093-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). This interaction could allow HO2 to locally influence both the heme and CO concentrations to which the BK channel is exposed. The influence of the CXXC motif on heme and CO binding suggests that this motif functions as a thiol/disulfide redox switch. Interestingly, a similar redox regulatory mechanism has been recently identified in human HO2; however, with an opposite redox regulatory modality (24Yi L. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21056-21067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 25Yi L. Jenkins P.M. Leichert L.I. Jakob U. Martens J.R. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 20556-20561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). HO2 has low affinity for heme when the Cys residues in a heme response motif are in the reduced (free thiol) state; however, when they switch to the oxidized (disulfide) state, the affinity for heme markedly increases (24Yi L. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21056-21067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 25Yi L. Jenkins P.M. Leichert L.I. Jakob U. Martens J.R. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 20556-20561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, it is most significant that redox switches in both HO2 and the BK channel respond in a seemingly coordinated way to redox changes, with HO2 releasing heme under redox conditions that optimize heme binding to HBD and HBD releasing heme under oxidizing conditions that stimulate heme degradation by HO2.Fig. 7 describes a working hypothesis for how HO2 and the BK channel system may coordinately respond to altering intracellular redox conditions and to the related shifts between hypoxia and normoxia. Under hypoxic conditions, where the redox potential would decrease, the thiol/disulfide switches in HO2 and the BK channel would convert to the dithiol states, with HO2 having low affinity and BK channel having high affinity for Fe3+-heme. The combined effects of low heme affinity and limited O2 concentration would decrease heme degradation activity by HO2, resulting in a local increase in heme and decrease in CO concentrations. Furthermore, the decrease in intracellular redox potential associated with hypoxia would promote binding of heme to the BK channel. Thus, these coordinated effects of high heme and low CO would promote closing of the BK channel. Under normoxic conditions, the redox active thiols of HO2 and the BK channel would exist in oxidized states, with HO2 having high affinity and BK channel having low affinity for Fe3+-heme. Furthermore, the increased O2 levels would stimulate degradation of heme to generate CO, which would activate the channel. It is likely that CO binding to the HBD would be one of the most rapid responses to the re-establishment of normoxic conditions, which would be followed by release of heme from the BK channel, due to its low heme affinity when the CXXC motif is in the oxidized state. The redox-based control of BK channel proposed here would of course be interfaced with the many other inputs into regulation of ion channel function, including the major roles of Ca2+ and membrane potential and other modulatory properties of the RCK domains.In conclusion, our research provides strong evidence for a thiol/disulfide switch in the BK channel that involves Cys residues in the CXXCH motif of a HBD. This switch regulates affinity of the HBD for heme and CO and for HO2. We speculate that this redox-linked alteration in properties of the HBD has important physiological roles, including the ability to regulate the activity of the human BK channel in response to intracellular hypoxic/normoxic conditions. IntroductionLarge-conductance Ca2+ and voltage-activated K+ channels, also known as Slo or BK channels, play important roles in many physiological phenomena, including oxygen sensing, vasodilation, synaptic transmission, and hormone secretion (1Salkoff L.

Physiology. 2009; 24: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In the carotid body, the BK channel was found to be involved in the hypoxic response (3Liu H. Moczydlowski E. Haddad G.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 4Lewis A. Peers C. Ashford M.L. Kemp P.J. J. Physiol. 2002; 540: 771-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). BK channels (for big K+) have the largest single-channel conductance of all K+-selective channels and are activated synergistically by intracellular Ca2+ and membrane potential (1Salkoff L. Butler A.

Life Sci. 2009; 66: 852-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). When open, K+ efflux by the BK channel hyperpolarizes the cell membrane potential. Like other voltage-gated K+ channels, the human BK channel complex is composed of four pore-forming α (Slo1) subunits that contain transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions (6Lu R. Alioua A. Kumar Y. Eghbali M. Stefani E. Toro L. J. Physiol. 2006; 570: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Each α subunit includes a seven-helix transmembrane segment (S0) and a voltage-sensing domain (S1–S4) and contributes one-fourth of the ion conduction pore (S5–S6) (7Adelman J.P. Shen K.Z.

At the C-terminal end of the BK channel, there is a large more than 700-residue cytoplasmic region, which contains two homologous domains termed “regulators of conductance of potassium” (RCK1 and RCK2) 2The abbreviations used are: RCKregulators of conductance of potassiumHO2heme oxygenase-2DTTdithiothreitolDTNB5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)EPRelectron paramagnetic resonanceHBDheme binding domainHBPheme-binding peptideZnPPzinc protoporphyrin. that form a gating ring that is essential for Ca2+ activation of the channel (8Xia X.M.

https://openalex.org/W1980613381,"With muscle wasting, caspase-3 activation and the ubiquitin-proteasome system act synergistically to increase the degradation of muscle proteins. Whether proteasome activity is also elevated in response to catabolic conditions is unknown. We find that caspase-3 increases proteasome activity in myotubes but not in myoblasts. This difference is related to the cleavage of specific 19 S proteasome subunits. In mouse muscle or myotubes, caspase-3 cleaves Rpt2 and Rpt6 increasing proteasome activity. In myoblasts, caspase-3 cleaves Rpt5 to decrease proteasome activity. To confirm the caspase-3 dependence, caspase-3 cleavage sites in Rpt2, Rpt6, or Rpt5 were mutated. This prevented the cleavage of these subunits by caspase-3 as well as the changes in proteasome activity. During differentiation of myoblasts to myotubes, there is an obligatory, transient increase in caspase-3 activity, accompanied by a corresponding increase in proteasome activity and cleavage of Rpt2 and Rpt6. Therefore, differentiation changes the proteasome type from sensitivity of Rpt5 to caspase-3 in myoblasts to sensitivity of Rpt2 and Rpt6 in myotubes. This novel mechanism identifies a feed-forward amplification that augments muscle proteolysis in catabolic conditions. Indeed, we found that in mice with a muscle wasting condition, chronic kidney disease, there was cleavage of subunits Rpt2 and Rpt6 and stimulation of proteasome activity."
https://openalex.org/W2120411875,"Skeletal muscle activity requires substantial increases in blood flow, and the underlying vasodilation involves endothelial activity, but the contribution of the endothelium-dependent hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) is only poorly defined. In EDHF signaling, endothelial hyperpolarization mediated by the Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels SK3 and IK1 is a key step and also initiates gap junction-dependent conducted dilations. We assessed the role of SK3, IK1, and connexin40 (Cx40) in muscular contraction-induced dilations in the microcirculation in vivo. Hitherto, arterioles were observed in the electrically stimulated cremaster skeletal muscle of anesthetized mice lacking SK3, IK1, or Cx40 using intravital microscopy. Genetic deficiency of SK3, but not of IK1, strongly attenuated dilations to muscular contraction. Similarly, pharmacologic blockade of SK3 by the specific blocker UCL1684 impaired such dilations in wild-type and IK1-deficient mice. In contrast, IK1 was required for acetylcholine-induced dilations. Genetic deficiency of Cx40 also attenuated dilations induced by muscular contraction but not by acetylcholine. These data support the concept that endothelial hyperpolarization through activation of SK3 contributes to exercise hyperemia and the hyperpolarization ascends the vascular tree through gap junctions formed by Cx40 to orchestrate dilation. The differential impact of SK3- and IK1-deficiency on dilations to distinct stimuli suggests stimulus-dependent activation of these endothelial channels."

https://openalex.org/W2026386244,"Ectodomain shedding of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the two proteases alpha- and beta-secretase is a key regulatory event in the generation of the Alzheimer disease amyloid beta peptide (Abeta). At present, little is known about the cellular mechanisms that control APP shedding and Abeta generation. Here, we identified a novel protein, transmembrane protein 59 (TMEM59), as a new modulator of APP shedding. TMEM59 was found to be a ubiquitously expressed, Golgi-localized protein. TMEM59 transfection inhibited complex N- and O-glycosylation of APP in cultured cells. Additionally, TMEM59 induced APP retention in the Golgi and inhibited Abeta generation as well as APP cleavage by alpha- and beta-secretase cleavage, which occur at the plasma membrane and in the endosomes, respectively. Moreover, TMEM59 inhibited the complex N-glycosylation of the prion protein, suggesting a more general modulation of Golgi glycosylation reactions. Importantly, TMEM59 did not affect the secretion of soluble proteins or the alpha-secretase like shedding of tumor necrosis factor alpha, demonstrating that TMEM59 did not disturb the general Golgi function. The phenotype of TMEM59 transfection on APP glycosylation and shedding was similar to the one observed in cells lacking conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) proteins COG1 and COG2. Both proteins are required for normal localization and activity of Golgi glycosylation enzymes. In summary, this study shows that TMEM59 expression modulates complex N- and O-glycosylation and suggests that TMEM59 affects APP shedding by reducing access of APP to the cellular compartments, where it is normally cleaved by alpha- and beta-secretase."
https://openalex.org/W2080239089,"Free radicals generated by oxidative stress cause damage that can contribute to numerous chronic diseases. Mammalian cells respond to this damage by increased transcription of cytoprotective phase II genes, which are regulated by NRF2. Previously, it has been shown that NRF2 protein levels increase after oxidative stress because its negative regulator, KEAP1, loses its ability to bind NRF2 and cause its proteasome-mediated degradation during oxidative stress. Here, we show that CRIF1, a protein previously known as cell cycle regulator and transcription cofactor, is also able to negatively regulate NRF2 protein stability. However, in contrast to KEAP1, which regulates NRF2 stability only under normal reducing conditions, CRIF1 regulates NRF2 stability and its target gene expression under both reducing and oxidative stress conditions. Thus, CRIF1-NRF2 interactions and their consequences are redox-independent. In addition, we found that CRIF1, unlike KEAP1 (which only interacts with N-terminal region of NRF2), physically interacts with both N- and C-terminal regions of NRF2 and promotes NRF2 ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated NRF2 protein degradation. Free radicals generated by oxidative stress cause damage that can contribute to numerous chronic diseases. Mammalian cells respond to this damage by increased transcription of cytoprotective phase II genes, which are regulated by NRF2. Previously, it has been shown that NRF2 protein levels increase after oxidative stress because its negative regulator, KEAP1, loses its ability to bind NRF2 and cause its proteasome-mediated degradation during oxidative stress. Here, we show that CRIF1, a protein previously known as cell cycle regulator and transcription cofactor, is also able to negatively regulate NRF2 protein stability. However, in contrast to KEAP1, which regulates NRF2 stability only under normal reducing conditions, CRIF1 regulates NRF2 stability and its target gene expression under both reducing and oxidative stress conditions. Thus, CRIF1-NRF2 interactions and their consequences are redox-independent.

https://openalex.org/W1994861481,"Cell surface pili are polymeric protein assemblies that enable bacteria to adhere to surfaces and to specific host tissues. The pili expressed by Gram-positive bacteria constitute a unique paradigm in which sortase-mediated covalent linkages join successive pilin subunits like beads on a string. These pili are formed from two or three distinct types of pilin subunit, typically encoded in small gene clusters, often with their cognate sortases. In Group A streptococci (GAS), a major pilin forms the polymeric backbone, whereas two minor pilins are located at the tip and the base. Here, we report the 1.9-Å resolution crystal structure of the GAS basal pilin FctB, revealing an immunoglobulin (Ig)-like N-terminal domain with an extended proline-rich tail. Unexpected structural homology between the FctB Ig-like domain and the N-terminal domain of the GAS shaft pilin helps explain the use of the same sortase for polymerization of the shaft and its attachment to FctB. It also enabled the identification, from mass spectral data, of the lysine residue involved in the covalent linkage of FctB to the shaft. The proline-rich tail forms a polyproline-II helix that appears to be a common feature of the basal (cell wall-anchoring) pilins. Together, our results indicate distinct structural elements in the pilin proteins that play a role in selecting for the appropriate sortases and thereby help orchestrate the ordered assembly of the pilus.

Together, our results indicate distinct structural elements in the pilin proteins that play a role in selecting for the appropriate sortases and thereby help orchestrate the ordered assembly of the pilus. Pili (or fimbriae) are hair-like protein appendages common in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. In many instances, pili are crucial for pathogenesis, because they mediate adhesion and enable colonization of a host (1Proft T. Baker E.N. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66: 613-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In Gram-positive pathogens such as Corynebacterium diphtheriae or Streptococcus pyogenes, the genes for the pilus assembly are arranged in pathogenic islets that encode one major pilin, one or two minor (ancillary) pilins, and pilus-specific sortases (2Ton-That H. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1429-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 3Mora M. Bensi G. Capo S. Falugi F. Zingaretti C. Manetti A.G. Maggi T. Taddei A.R. Grandi G.

The latter catalyze covalent polymerization of the major pilins by the formation of intermolecular amide bonds between the C terminus of one subunit and a lysine residue on the next (2Ton-That H. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1429-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 4Telford J.L. Barocchi M.A. Margarit I. Rappuoli R. Grandi G. Nat. Rev.

This covalent shaft assembly is a hallmark of the Gram-positive pilus structure. Another striking feature of the pilus shaft is the occurrence of intramolecular isopeptide (amide) bonds in the major pilins that confer stability on these subunits and on the pilus assembly (6Kang H.J. Coulibaly F. Clow F. Proft T. Baker E.N. Science. 2007; 318: 1625-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 7Budzik J.M. Marraffini L.A. Souda P. Whitelegge J.P. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. Proc.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 16967-16971Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The minor pilins, in contrast, are less well characterized, and questions arise as to their roles and modes of incorporation into the pili, due to the fact that some pili (e.g. those for Bacillus cereus) have only one minor pilin, whereas most others have two (9Oh S.Y. Budzik J.M. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 13703-13704Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The best characterized of the three-component pili are those from C. diphtheriae. In the prototypical pili from this organism, the pilus-specific sortase SrtA polymerizes the major pilin SpaA to form a pilus shaft, which carries the minor pilin SpaC on its tip (2Ton-That H. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1429-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Another minor pilin, SpaB, is incorporated at the base of the pilus and is tethered to the peptidoglycan by the so-called housekeeping sortase SrtF (10Mandlik A. Das A. Ton-That H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 14147-14152Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus, SpaB anchors the pilus structure to the cell wall. This pattern, in which a major pilin forms the polymeric pilus shaft, with minor pilins as the cap and the cell wall anchor, has emerged as a consistent paradigm for the three-component pili of other Gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus agalactiae (11Nobbs A.H.

Wilson, M. J. Banfield, and M. A. Kehoe, submitted for publication. At the structural level, three-dimensional structures are available for the shaft-forming major pilins of S. pyogenes, C. diphtheriae, and Bacillus cereus (6Kang H.J. Coulibaly F. Clow F. Proft T. Baker E.N. Science. 2007; 318: 1625-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 8Kang H.J. Paterson N.G. Gaspar A.H. Ton-That H. Baker E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In contrast, much less is known so far of the structural determinants that underlie the incorporation of minor pilins at the tip and the base. Here, we focus on the important human pathogen S. pyogenes (group A streptococcus (GAS)). 5The abbreviations used are: GASGroup A streptococciFCTfibronectin- and collagen-binding protein and T-antigenAP1-2, ancillary pilins 1 and 2BPbackbone pilinSeMetselenomethioninePPIIpolyproline-IIr.m.s.root mean square. GAS colonizes host epithelia, causing benign but very common diseases such as acute tonsillitis and pharyngitis, but can also invade underlying soft tissues to cause lethal invasive disease such as streptococcal toxic shock syndrome or necrotizing fasciitis (16Cunningham M.W. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 13: 470-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). The search for GAS vaccine candidates led to the discovery of pilus structures on this bacterium (3Mora M. Bensi G. Capo S. Falugi F. Zingaretti C. Manetti A.G. Maggi T. Taddei A.R. Grandi G. Telford J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 15641-15646Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). These pili are essential for adhesion of S. pyogenes to pharyngeal cell lines, human tonsil explants, and primary keratinocytes and appear to be involved in biofilm formation (17Abbot E.L. Smith W.D.

Group A streptococci fibronectin- and collagen-binding protein and T-antigen -2, ancillary pilins 1 and 2 backbone pilin selenomethionine polyproline-II root mean square. GAS pilin proteins are encoded by genes of the highly variable FCT region, of which nine types have been described so far (19Falugi F. Zingaretti C. Pinto V. Mariani M. Amodeo L. Manetti A.G. Capo S. Musser J.M. Orefici G. Margarit I. Telford J.L. Grandi G. Mora M. J. Infect. Dis. 2008; 198: 1834-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Except for FCT-1, these encode three pilin proteins, of which the major pilin (usually designated FctA or backbone pilin (BP)) forms the shaft, with the two minor pilins at the tip and the base; Cpa or ancillary pilin 1 (AP1) forms the cap and FctB or ancillary pilin 2 (AP2) acts as the cell wall anchor of the pilus (19Falugi F. Zingaretti C. Pinto V. Mariani M. Amodeo L. Manetti A.G. Capo S. Musser J.M. Orefici G. Margarit I. Telford J.L. Grandi G. Mora M. J. Infect.

Coulibaly F. Clow F. Proft T. Baker E.N. Science. 2007; 318: 1625-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The same lysine residue of the BP is also used to incorporate Cpa/AP1 at the tip of the pilus, as has been shown for several strains (21Quigley B.R. Zähner D. Hatkoff M. Thanassi D.G. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 72: 1379-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).4 The second minor pilin, FctB/AP2 (Spy0130 in GAS M1 strain SF370), has also been reported to be covalently linked to the pilus structure (3Mora M. Bensi G. Capo S. Falugi F. Zingaretti C. Manetti A.G. Maggi T. Taddei A.R. Grandi G. Telford J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Graviss E.A. Telford J.L. Grandi G. Margarit I. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 64: 968-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and has been located in the cell wall by immunoelectron microscopy (3Mora M. Bensi G. Capo S. Falugi F. Zingaretti C. Manetti A.G. Maggi T. Taddei A.R. Grandi G. Telford J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 15641-15646Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Importantly, it has been shown recently that a Δspy0130 knock-out mutant still forms pili, but that these are not attached to the cell wall and are instead released into the culture medium.4 A ΔfctB knock-out in a GAS serotype M49 strain similarly results in loss of pili from the cell wall (22Nakata M. Köller T. Moritz K. Ribardo D. Jonas L. McIver K.S. Sumitomo T. Terao Y. Kawabata S. Podbielski A. Kreikemeyer B. Infect. Immun. 2009; 77: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These experiments identify FctB/AP2 as the cell wall anchor of GAS pili. Neither the structure of AP2, nor its mode of attachment to the shaft of the pilus, has as yet been determined, however. Our long term goal is to obtain a complete atomic description of the GAS pilus assembly. Building on our crystal structure of the GAS backbone pilin (6Kang H.J. Coulibaly F. Clow F. Proft T. Baker E.N. Science. 2007; 318: 1625-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) we here address the structure of the basal pilin AP2, which anchors the GAS pilus to the cell wall. After unsuccessful attempts to crystallize the AP2 subunit from the M1 strain (Spy0130), we have solved the high resolution structure of its FctB homolog from GAS strain 90/306S. The structure reveals an Ig-like domain with an extended proline-rich tail. Structural homology with the N-terminal domain of Spy0128, the GAS BP subunit from the M1 strain, points to a conserved lysine on AP2 as the site of the covalent linkage between AP2 and BP, a linkage that we have also confirmed by mass spectral analysis of native M1 pili. The FctB structure further identifies the polyproline tail as an important structural determinant in anchoring the pilus to the cell wall. The fctB gene without the predicted signal peptide and the C-terminal membrane association helix was cloned by PCR from the GAS strain 90/306S. This strain is a T9 serotype (from its fctA sequence; data not shown) but is of unknown M serotype. The FctB protein was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography and gel filtration as described before (23Linke C. Young P.G. Kang H.J. Proft T. Baker E.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2010; 66: 177-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). FctB substituted with selenomethionine (SeMet-FctB) was expressed according to a protocol described by Van Duyne et al. (24Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). SeMet-FctB was purified as described for native FctB (23Linke C. Young P.G. Kang H.J. Proft T. Baker E.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2010; 66: 177-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), except that 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol was added to lysis, wash, and elution buffer, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol to Tris-buffered saline and 10 mm dithiothreitol to the standard storage buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.3 mm NaN3). Native FctB crystals were grown by mixing 1–2 μl of protein solution (27 mg/ml) with 1–2 μl of precipitant (100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.1–6.5, 0.9–1 m sodium citrate) at 18 °C (23Linke C. Young P.G. Kang H.J. Proft T. Baker E.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2010; 66: 177-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). SeMet-FctB crystals were grown under the same conditions by streak-seeding from crystals of native FctB. Crystals of native FctB and SeMet-FctB were transferred to cryoprotectant (100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 1 m sodium citrate, 20% (v/v) glycerol) prior to flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected in-house (23Linke C. Young P.G. Kang H.J. Proft T. Baker E.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst.

The small size of the beam allowed data to be collected from different regions within a crystal, which were found to have quite variable diffraction properties. All data sets (Table 1) were processed as described before (23Linke C. Young P.G. Kang H.J. Proft T. Baker E.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst.

Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3719) Google Scholar). In a single isomorphous replacement approach, AutoSHARP (26Vonrhein C. Blanc E. Roversi P. Bricogne G. Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 364: 215-230PubMed Google Scholar) was used to find and refine the selenomethionine sites in SeMet-FctB (1 per molecule). Three sites were found, two of which were very close together and had occupancies of 0.39 each (0.87 for the third site). Initial phases were derived from these sites using AutoSHARP and were improved by density modification on the initial electron density map. The resulting electron density was suitable for automated model-building with BUCCANEER (27Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Coulibaly F. Clow F. Proft T. Baker E.N. Science. 2007; 318: 1625-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The Spy0130 model was superimposed on the N-terminal domain of Spy0128 where it abuts the C terminus of the next molecule in the crystal, and the model of the C-terminal domain of Spy0125 was similarly superimposed on the C-terminal domain of Spy0128 to dock against the N-terminal domain of the next molecule. FctB and Spy0130 from S. pyogenes strain SF370 were purified as described previously (23Linke C. Young P.G. Kang H.J. Proft T. Baker E.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2010; 66: 177-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Both were dialyzed thoroughly against 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and diluted to 3–4 μm. CD spectra were recorded on a PiStar-180 (Applied Photophysics) spectrometer at ambient temperature. Pili were purified from S. pyogenes strain SF370 and analyzed as described before (6Kang H.J. Coulibaly F. Clow F. Proft T. Baker E.N. Science. 2007; 318: 1625-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell wall extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE, and bands containing pili were cut out and digested using trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI). The fragments were analyzed using a Q-STAR XL Hybrid MS/MS system (Applied Biosystems). Peptides were identified manually or with a Mascot search engine version 2.0.05 (Matrix Science). Our original goal was to determine the structure of Spy0130, the basal pilin from the M1 strain SF370, for which we had mass spectral data from the native pili. When all attempts to crystallize Spy0130 failed, however, we turned to its homologue from a local isolate of GAS strain 90/360S. The latter is of unknown M serotype but was typed as T9 from its fctA sequence, and PCR analysis of the FCT islet showed it to have the same gene order as FCT-2, FCT-3, and FCT-4 strains. Its fctA and fctB genes are >97% identical to those from the M9 strain 2720, which is an FCT-4-containing strain (19Falugi F. Zingaretti C. Pinto V. Mariani M. Amodeo L. Manetti A.G. Capo S. Musser J.M. Orefici G. Margarit I. Telford J.L. Grandi G. Mora M. J. Infect. Dis. 2008; 198: 1834-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Constructs for Spy0130 and for FctB from strain 90/306S were expressed in E. coli and purified, with high quality crystals being obtained for FctB (23Linke C. Young P.G. Kang H.J. Proft T. Baker E.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2010; 66: 177-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The construct used encompasses the mature protein from the signal peptidase cleavage site through to the LPLAG sortase cleavage motif. The crystal structure of FctB was solved by single isomorphous replacement using in-house diffraction data from SeMet-substituted crystals of FctB. The solvent content of the crystals was 68% and enabled successful density modification despite low phasing power (Table 1). The structure was refined at 1.9-Å resolution to an R factor of 15.9% (Rfree = 18.2%) (Table 2). The asymmetric unit contains two molecules, A and B, of which molecule A lacks only the first two N-terminal residues, whereas molecule B lacks interpretable electron density for one N-terminal and the 7 C-terminal residues 133–139. Here, we take molecule A as the representative model for FctB. The structure of FctB consists of a compact, all-β domain (residues 3–120) with an immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) fold, followed by an extended proline-rich tail that forms a polyproline-II (PPII)-like helix (Fig. 1A). The Ig-like domain is formed by a 5-stranded β-sheet (C-B-E-F-G1) and a 3-stranded β-sheet (D-A-G2) that pack to give a β-sandwich. Strand G is interrupted by an omega (Ω)-loop (residues 102–111) that enables this strand to transfer its hydrogen bonding from one sheet to the other. Beyond Leu-120, the C-terminal 19 residues form an extended structure that projects from the globular Ig-like domain (Fig. 1). This C-terminal tail has a high frequency of proline residues, which occur with significant regularity; residues 123–137 have the sequence PXPPXXPXXPXXPXXP. For the most part, the electron density for this region is surprisingly good, especially in molecule A (Fig. 1B), and the structure is well defined. The overall shape of the FctB molecule strongly resembles the low resolution model derived for Spy0130, based on SAXS data (37Solovyova A.S. Pointon J.A. Race P.R. Smith W.D. Kehoe M.A. Banfield M.J. Eur. Biophys. J. 2010; 39: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), This model has approximate dimensions of 105 × 25 × 14 Å, agreeing well with those of FctB (80 × 30 × 20 Å). It also displays a very similar division into two elongated domains of different width (37Solovyova A.S. Pointon J.A. Race P.R. Smith W.D. Kehoe M.A. Banfield M.J. Eur. Biophys. J. 2010; 39: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), consistent with a globular IgG-like domain and a tail-domain. These data, coupled with the 33% sequence identity for the two proteins (supplemental Fig. S3) suggest that FctB and Spy0130 share the same structure, an IgG-like domain linked to a proline-rich tail domain. Searches of the Protein Data Bank with SSM (34Krissinel E. Henrick K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3118) Google Scholar) show that the closest structural homolog of FctB is the N-terminal domain of the major pilin Spy0128 from S. pyogenes serotype M1 (PDB identifier 3B2M) (6Kang H.J. Coulibaly F. Clow F. Proft T. Baker E.N. Science. 2007; 318: 1625-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). FctB aligns with this domain with a root-mean-square (r.m.s.) difference in Cα atom positions of 1.78 Å over 96 residues (Fig. 2A). Like the N-terminal domain of Spy0128, the overall fold and the topology of FctB are related to the inverse IgG fold of the CnaB repeat domains of the staphylococcal collagen-binding protein Cna (38Deivanayagam C.C. Rich R.L. Carson M. Owens R.T. Danthuluri S. Bice T. Höök M. Narayana S.V. Structure. 2000; 8: 67-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). The two β-sheets of the Ig-like domain of FctB are linked by a 2.8-Å hydrogen bond between Asn-13 Oδ1 and Gln-67 Nϵ2 in the hydrophobic core. The side chains of Asn-13 and Gln-67 make further hydrogen bonds with the peptide oxygen of Gly-44 and peptide nitrogen of Asp-78, respectively, creating a hydrogen network through the hydrophobic core that bridges four strands of the two β-sheets. This hydrogen bond network in FctB takes the place of the intramolecular isopeptide bond that stabilizes the N-terminal domain of Spy0128 (6Kang H.J. Coulibaly F. Clow F. Proft T. Baker E.N.

Although bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) maintain pluripotency of undifferentiated mouse ES cells, the role of autocrine Nodal signaling is less clear. Pharmacological, molecular, and genetic methods were used to further understand the roles and potential interactions of these pathways. Treatment of undifferentiated ES cells with SB431542, a pharmacological inhibitor of Smad2 signaling, resulted in a rapid reduction of phosphorylated Smad2 and altered the expression of several putative downstream targets. Unexpectedly, inhibition of the Nodal signaling pathway resulted in enhanced BMP signaling, as assessed by Smad1/5 phosphorylation. SB431542-treated cells also demonstrated significant induction of the Id genes, which are known direct targets of BMP signaling and important factors in ES cell pluripotency. Inhibition of BMP signaling decreased the SB431542-mediated phosphorylation of Smad1/5 and induction of Id genes, suggesting that BMP signaling is necessary for some Smad2-mediated activity. Because Smad7, a known inhibitory factor to both Nodal and BMP signaling, was down-regulated following inhibition of Nodal-Smad2 signaling, the contribution of Smad7 to the cross-talk between the transforming growth factor-β pathways in ES cells was examined. Biochemical manipulation of Smad7 expression, through shRNA knockdown or inducible gene expression, significantly reduced the SB431542-mediated phosphorylation of Smad1/5 and induction of the Id genes.

It is from the inner cell mass that the germ layers arise to produce all cell types of the adult. The capacity of ES cells to either self-renew or differentiate into cells of the three germ layers provides an excellent tool for studying early embryonic development, including self-renewal and pluripotency (1Evans M.J. Kaufman M.H. Nature. 1981; 292: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (6481) Google Scholar). Some of the essential factors controlling ES cell pluripotency have been identified; however, additional work is necessary to identify other functional signaling pathways that impinge upon the ES cell phenotype, to determine genes that are regulated by these pathways, and to discover how the various pathways interact.

Additionally, under serum-free culture conditions, signaling through the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway is essential for maintaining mouse ES cell pluripotency (4Qi X. Li T.G. Hao J. Hu J.

The central requirement for active BMP signaling in maintaining ES cells under serum-free conditions is clear, yet its regulation and interactions with other pathways are important questions in ES cell biology. BMPs are members of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β superfamily, whose diverse members play vital roles in embryonic development and in ES cell biology (10Pucéat M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 74: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 11Kitisin K. Saha T. Blake T. Golestaneh N. Deng M. Kim C. Tang Y. Shetty K. Mishra B. Mishra L. Sci. STKE. 2007; 2007: cm1Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The ligands, including TGF-β, Activin, Nodal, and the BMPs, bind to the extracellular domain of the type II receptors. Binding induces activation of type I receptors, including the Activin receptor-like kinases (ALKs) 1–7 (12Miyazawa K. Shinozaki M. Hara T. Furuya T. Miyazono K. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 1191-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Activin and Nodal signal via ALK4, ALK5, and ALK7, whereas the BMPs convey signaling through ALK2, ALK3, and ALK6. In the canonical signaling pathway model, intracellular transduction is mediated by phosphorylation of receptor-regulated Smad proteins via activated type I receptors. Smad2 and Smad3 are activated by Activin and Nodal signaling, whereas Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 are substrates for BMP-activated receptors (13Massagué J. Seoane J. Wotton D. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2783-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1927) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated Smads (pSmad) form heteromeric complexes with co-mediator Smad4, enter the nucleus, and interact with co-activators and transcription factors to affect gene transcription. Moreover, inhibitory Smads (Smad6 and Smad7) inhibit activation of receptor-regulated Smad proteins and function as feedback modulators of pathway activity (14Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Morén A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.E. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). ES cells have an active Nodal-Smad2 signaling axis (15Watabe T. Miyazono K. Cell Res. 2009; 19: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Nodal is highly expressed in ES cells, suggesting significant autocrine activity of this pathway. Stimulation of ES cells with recombinant Activin or Nodal enhances Smad2 phosphorylation and increases ES cell proliferation (16Ogawa K. Saito A. Matsui H. Suzuki H. Ohtsuka S. Shimosato D. Morishita Y. Watabe T. Niwa H. Miyazono K. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Alternatively, pharmacological inhibition of pSmad2 signaling and inhibition by Smad7 overexpression decrease ES cell proliferation (16Ogawa K. Saito A. Matsui H. Suzuki H. Ohtsuka S. Shimosato D. Morishita Y. Watabe T. Niwa H. Miyazono K. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Transcriptional targets of Smad2 in ES cells include many feedback regulatory factors such as Smad7, Lefty, and Bambi (17Guzman-Ayala M. Lee K.L. Mavrakis K.J. Goggolidou P. Norris D.P. Episkopou V. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e4268Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, the actions of downstream target genes of Nodal-Smad2 signaling and interactions with other critical signaling pathways are not known. In this work, we sought to define the activity of Nodal signaling and its interaction with the BMP pathway in undifferentiated mouse ES cells. Using pharmacological, molecular, and genetic methods, these efforts demonstrated that inhibition of Nodal signaling indirectly enhanced the activation of the BMP substrates Smad1/5 and increased the expression of downstream BMP target genes. Nodal signaling regulated Smad7 expression, which feeds back to inhibit both the Nodal and BMP pathways in ES cells. This work uncovered an interdependence of the Nodal-Smad2 and BMP-Smad1/5 signaling pathways in undifferentiated ES cells and defines potential mechanisms for these pathways in ES cell maintenance. E14Tg2A (E14) ES cells were maintained on feeder-free, gelatin-coated plates in ES media as described before (18Skarnes W.C.

Cell. 2003; 115: 281-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar, 20Ying Q.L. Smith A.G. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 365: 327-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), supplemented with 103 units/ml LIF and 10 ng/ml BMP4 (R&D). ES cells were treated with 10 ng/ml BMP4, 10 ng/ml Activin (R&D), 5 μm SB431542 (Sigma), 0.5 μm A-83-01, and 5 μm dorsomorphin (Sigma) at the noted concentration and for 24 h unless specifically noted otherwise. DMSO was applied at the same volume as SB431542, A-83-01, or dorsomorphin as a vehicle control. Analyses of time-course treatments of SB431542 and BMP4 were performed by application of each treatment to sustained cultures; thus, over the length of the time course the media stayed constant and only the treatments were added at each time point. Standard protocols (19Nagy A. Gertsenstein M. Vintersten K. Behringer R. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2003: 359-397Google Scholar) were used to generate homozygous Smad2m1Mag ES cells from blastocysts. In brief, timed matings were performed by crossing Smad2m1Mag heterozygous females with Smad2m1Mag heterozygous males (21Vivian J.L. Chen Y. Yee D. Schneider E. Magnuson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 15542-15547Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) carrying the Rosa26-lacZ allele (22Friedrich G. Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). Blastocysts were flushed from these matings, and inner cell mass outgrowths were cultured in ES media on gelatin-coated dishes to establish cell lines. DNA was isolated for genotyping of the Smad2m1Mag allele, and X-Gal staining (23Vivian J.L. Klein W.H. Hasty P. BioTechniques. 1999; 27: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) was performed to identify cell lines carrying the Rosa26-lacz allele. Two lines of each genotype were used for the analysis. RNA was isolated using Qiagen columns and initially analyzed with the Mouse Genome 430A Array from Affymetrix. Microarray data were deposited to the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE17879). For gene expression analysis, cDNA was synthesized (Applied Biosystems), and quantitative real-time PCR analysis was performed using TaqMan primer sets with the 7500 Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Specific ABI TaqMan Primer/Probe assay identification numbers are available upon request. Cells were lysed using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer with Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktails (Pierce) for Western analysis. Primary antibodies for pSmad2 (Millipore), Smad2 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), pSmad1/5/8 (Cell Signaling), Smad1 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Smad7 (R&D), and FLAG (Sigma) were incubated overnight at 4 °C and followed with incubation of appropriate secondary antibodies. E14 ES cells were plated 1 day prior to transfection on gelatin-coated 24-well plates and transfected with pGL2-Id1 Luciferase (−1585 to +88 of promoter; Addgene plasmid 16048 (24Tournay O. Benezra R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 2418-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar)), and pGL4.74 [hRluc/TK] (Promega) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Following transfection, ES media was change to defined media with LIF and BMP4 for 24 h. Cells were then grown in defined media with LIF and treated with BMP4, SB431542, or BMP4 plus SB431542 for an additional 24 h. Firefly luciferase activity in cell lysates was measured and normalized to expression of TK-Renilla luciferase. The Activin-responsive reporter pGL3-CAGA12-luciferase (25Pardali K. Kurisaki A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 29244-29256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) was co-transfected with pGL4.74 [hRluc/TK] into control and Smad2m1Mag homozygous ES cells. The cells were grown in defined media with LIF and 20 ng/ml BMP4 and treated with Activin or SB431542 for the final 24 h. Lysates were analyzed for luciferase readings. Two methods were utilized for knockdown of specific target genes. For knockdown of Nodal and TGF-β1, specific siRNAs (Dharmacon) were transfected via lipofection following the manufacturer's instructions. Changes in gene expression were compared with a non-targeting siRNA after 48 h. For knockdown of Smad7, plasmids expressing shRNAs (Open Biosystems) were transfected into ES cells via lipofection and screened for efficient knockdown. The hairpin targeting 5′-CTCCAGATACCCAATGGATTT-3′ (bp 920–940, TRCN0000096053) produced the strongest Smad7 knockdown and was used in subsequent experiments. A non-targeting hairpin (26Ro S. Hwang S.J. Ordög T. Sanders K.M. BioTechniques. 2005; 38: 625-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) was cloned into pLKO.1. The non-targeting and Smad7 shRNAs were transfected into ES cells. One day after transfection, the cells were passaged and plated in defined media with LIF, BMP4, and puromycin to select for cells with transient expression of pLKO.1 constructs. After selection, the ES cells were treated with appropriate media conditions for 24 h after which the cells were harvested for RNA or protein analyses. CRE-mediated recombination was used to generate an ES cell line with doxycycline-inducible Smad7, as described previously (27Kyba M. Perlingeiro R.C. Daley G.Q. Cell. 2002; 109: 29-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). In brief, a cDNA encoding FLAG-Smad7 was cloned into the engineered PALP targeting vector, and the resulting construct was co-electroporated with a Cre-expressing plasmid (pOG231, Addgene Plasmid 17736 (28O'Gorman S. Fox D.T. Wahl G.M. Science. 1991; 251: 1351-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar)) in Ainv15 cells. The Ainv15 cell line, derived from E14 mES cells, contains a reverse tetracycline transactivator for the tet-ON system in the Rosa26 locus and a tet response element, a loxP site, and a neomycin resistance gene lacking an initiation codon in the Hprt locus (27Kyba M.

Nature. 1987; 326: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). After selection in media supplemented with G418, clones with appropriate recombination were confirmed via PCR genotyping, tested for doxycycline-inducible expression, and karyotyped. For RNA and protein analyses, cells were treated with doxycycline for 6 h prior to treatment with SB431542 and then co-treated with doxycycline and SB431542 for 24 h. Results were graphed to represent means ± S.E. of the mean. RNA analyses were performed in at least triplicate samples. Student t-tests were performed to determine statistical significance of the data with a p value of <0.05 considered statistically significant. To determine the target genes of Smad2 signaling in undifferentiated ES cells, changes in gene expression were examined following treatment with recombinant Activin or SB431542 under defined media culture conditions (20Ying Q.L. Smith A.G. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 365: 327-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). SB431542 specifically inhibits ALK4/5/7 receptor signaling as a competitive inhibitor of ATP binding to the kinase domain and has no effect on BMP-regulated ALKs or other kinase pathways (30Inman G.J.

In mouse ES cells, recombinant Activin has been shown to produce stronger Smad2 phosphorylation at lower concentrations than commercially available recombinant Nodal (16Ogawa K. Saito A. Matsui H.

Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar); thus, Activin was used to stimulate the Smad2 pathway in this analysis. In non-manipulated ES cells grown in serum-free media, substantial pSmad2 was observed via Western analysis (Fig. 1A), demonstrating an autocrine signaling activity for this pathway. Activin stimulation increased pSmad2 in ES cells after 2 h, while treatment with SB431542 for 24 h virtually eliminated pSmad2. Total Smad2 expression remained unchanged through these manipulations. Changes in gene expression in ES cells treated with Activin or SB431542 was first analyzed through Affymetrix microarrays and then confirmed using real-time quantitative PCR (rtPCR, Fig. 1B). The inhibition of Smad2 signaling resulted in more numerous and larger magnitude changes in gene expression than Smad2 pathway stimulation. This observation is consistent with the idea that Smad2 signaling is active via autocrine mechanisms in mouse ES cells. No changes in the expression of the core pluripotency factors such as Nanog and Pou5f1 (Oct4) were observed in the short timeframe examined in these expression analyses (data not shown). Inhibition of Smad2 signaling acted both to repress and derepress gene expression. Altered in Smad2 activity produced the greatest gene expression changes in the Lefty genes, secreted Nodal antagonists that are highly expressed in ES cells and play vital roles in left/right asymmetry in the developing embryo (32Tabibzadeh S. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 1998-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Loss of pSmad2 reduced the expression of the Lefty genes to an amount greatly reduced from basal expression, whereas stimulation of pSmad2 increased Lefty1 and Lefty2 expression 3-fold, the greatest observed increase in gene expression associated with Activin treatment. Inhibition of Smad2 signaling via SB431542 significantly diminished the expression of multiple other developmentally regulated genes, including Brachyury (T), Follistatin (Fst), Fgf8, Spsb1, Pitx2, and Mixl1, and significantly attenuated the expression of components of the TGF-β family signaling pathway, including Nodal and Smad7. Interestingly, inhibition of Smad2 signaling enhanced the expression of the Id genes, transcriptional modulators that have been shown to be vital in BMP-mediated ES cell pluripotency (5Ying Q.L. Nichols J. Chambers I. Smith A. Cell. 2003; 115: 281-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar). Smad2 inhibition induced Id1, Id2, and Id3 expression over 2-fold, whereas Activin treatment had the opposite effect and reduced Id gene expression by almost half (Fig. 1B). Treatment with SB431542 also derepressed the expression of Ascl2 (Mash2) and Gata2, genes that are not expressed in undifferentiated ES cells. Although the developmental expression of Ascl2 and Gata2 is complex, both genes are highly expressed in the developing trophectoderm. These results define a cohort of developmentally important genes that are regulated by Smad2 signaling in undifferentiated mouse ES cells. The microarray and biochemical results suggest an active autocrine signaling pathway mediated by Smad2 in ES cells. The microarray data were examined to determine which of the TGF-β1-related ligands are expressed in ES cells and could mediate this signaling. The Nodal ligand had by far the strongest mRNA expression in ES cells of all ALK4/5/7 ligands, suggesting the autocrine Smad2 activation is mediated by expression and secretion of Nodal. However, the TGF-β1 ligand demonstrated low expression in ES cells. To confirm that Nodal is the major mediator of pSmad2 activity in ES cells, Nodal and TGF-β1 expression were reduced through siRNA transfection, and known Smad2 gene targets were analyzed. siRNA knockdown of Nodal significantly down-regulated Lefty1, a highly responsive target of Smad2 signaling, whereas TGF-β1 knockdown had no effect of Lefty1 expression (Fig. 1C). Thus, treatment of ES cells with SB431542 primarily inhibits autocrine Nodal signaling. To confirm the activity of the Nodal-Smad2 axis via non-pharmacological methods, we generated ES cells that carry a homozygous Smad2 mutation, Smad2m1Mag (21Vivian J.L. Chen Y. Yee D. Schneider E. Magnuson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 15542-15547Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Previous in vivo analysis has shown that the Smad2m1Mag mutation is a severe reduction of the functional allele. The reduced function of this Smad2 mutation was confirmed with the homozygous mutant ES cells by chimeric analysis and via protein interaction analysis (supplemental Fig. 1). The transcriptional activity of the Smad2m1Mag allele was assayed via transient transfection of the CAGA12 luciferase reporter, which is responsive to TGF-β and Activin but not BMP stimulation (25Pardali K. Kurisaki A. Morén A. ten Dijke P. Kardassis D. Moustakas A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29244-29256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 33Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar). Smad2m1Mag ES cells activated the CAGA12 reporter significantly less than control cells and failed to enhance reporter activity in response to Activin stimulation (p < 0.05, Fig. 1D). The basal CAGA12 reporter activity in Smad2m1Mag ES cells may be from the low level of Smad3 present in ES cells (33Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar, 34Zhao X. Nicholls J.M. Chen Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3272-3280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To determine if Smad2m1Mag mutant ES cells also exhibited similar gene expression defects as SB431542-treated ES cells, expression of Smad7, Lefty1, and the Id genes were analyzed in the mutant ES cells. Smad2 mutant ES cells expressed significantly lower Smad7 and Lefty1 mRNA than control heterozygous cells (p < 0.05, Fig. 1E). Correspondingly, Id1 expression was significantly up-regulated over 1.5-fold (p < 0.05). Although Id2 and Id3 also had increased expression, the changes did not reach statistical significance. Thus, gene expression changes after pharmacological inhibition of Nodal signaling are consistent with genetic perturbation of Smad2 signaling. Overall, these data support an autocrine signaling pathway in undifferentiated ES cells mediated by Nodal and Smad2 that regulates the expression of a substantial number of genes. Several of the genes identified as being regulated by Smad2 signaling in ES cells include regulators of the Nodal-Smad2 signaling axis itself. Although changes in expression of Lefty1, Lefty2, and Nodal will feedback to affect signaling through the Nodal pathway, modulation of Follistatin and Smad7 have the ability to affect multiple pathways, including BMP-mediated activity (35Balemans W. Van Hul W. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 231-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Yan X. Liu Z. Chen Y. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. 2009; 41: 263-272Crossref Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Given the importance of the BMP signaling pathway in maintaining ES cell pluripotency (5Ying Q.L. Nichols J. Chambers I. Smith A. Cell. 2003; 115: 281-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar), we wanted to determine if modulation of Nodal signaling affected the BMP signaling axis in undifferentiated ES cells. The level of intracellular BMP signaling activity was monitored by examining the phosphorylation of Smad1/5 following inhibition of Nodal signaling in a detailed time course. Treatment with SB431542 significantly decreased pSmad2 levels after 0.5 h (Fig. 2A). Surprisingly, Smad1/5 phosphorylation increased after 3 h of SB431542 treatment. Previous work has indicated that SB431542 is a specific inhibitor of ALK4/5/7 kinase activity and has no affect on the type I BMP receptors that modulate Smad1/5 phosphorylation (30Inman G.J. Nicolás F.J. Callahan J.F. Harling J.D. Gaster L.M. Reith A.D. Laping N.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar); thus, this effect is not due to direct pharmacological modulation of the BMP receptor kinase activity. The temporal lag of increase in Smad1/5 phosphorylation compared with the decrease in Smad2 phosphorylation suggests that the enhanced phosphorylation of Smad1/5 in response to Nodal inhibition is likely indirect. To verify the change in phosphorylation of BMP-regulated Smads in response to inhibition of Nodal signaling, a second small molecule inhibitor of ALK4/5/7, A-83-01, was used. A-83-01 is a more potent inhibitor of the ALK4/5/7 receptors that prevents phosphorylation of Smad2 but has no effect on type I BMP receptors (37Tojo M. Hamashima Y. Hanyu A. Kajimoto T. Saitoh M. Miyazono K. Node M. Imamura T. Cancer Sci. 2005; 96: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Treatment with either 5 μm SB431542 or 0.5 μm A-83-01 induced similar increases in pSmad1/5 levels after 24 h (supplemental Fig. 2A). The enhancement of pSmad1/5 in response to SB431542 was also observed in cells grown in defined media lacking BMP4 supplementation in the media. Also, stimulation with recombinant Activin, with or without BMP4 supplement, lowered the phosphorylation state of Smad1/5. Thus, multiple modes of Smad2 signal perturbation reveal changes in BMP signaling. Inhibitory Smad7 is able to antagonize both Nodal and BMP signaling and participate in the cross-talk between the pathways (36Yan X. Liu Z. Chen Y. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. 2009; 41: 263-272Crossref Sco"
https://openalex.org/W2103092041,"The molecular mechanism underlying the post-Golgi transport of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) remains poorly understood. Here we determine the role of Rab8 GTPase, which modulates vesicular protein transport between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and the plasma membrane, in the cell surface targeting of alpha(2B)- and beta(2)-adrenergic receptors (AR). Transient expression of GDP- and GTP-bound Rab8 mutants and short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of Rab8 more potently inhibited the cell surface expression of alpha(2B)-AR than beta(2)-AR. The GDP-bound Rab8(T22N) mutant attenuated ERK1/2 activation by alpha(2B)-AR, but not beta(2)-AR, and arrested alpha(2B)-AR in the TGN compartment. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed that both alpha(2B)-AR and beta(2)-AR physically interacted with Rab8 and glutathione S-transferase fusion protein pulldown assays demonstrated that Rab8 interacted with the C termini of both receptors. Interestingly, mutation of the highly conserved membrane-proximal C terminus dileucine motif selectively blocked beta(2)-AR interaction with Rab8, whereas mutation of residues Val(431)-Phe(432)-Asn(433)-Gln(434), Pro(447)-Trp(448), Gln(450)-Thr(451), and Trp(453) in the C terminus impaired alpha(2B)-AR interaction with Rab8. Furthermore, transport inhibition by Rab8(T22N) of a chimeric beta(2)-AR carrying the alpha(2B)-AR C terminus was similar to alpha(2B)-AR. These data provide strong evidence indicating that Rab8 GTPase interacts with distinct motifs in the C termini of alpha(2B)-AR and beta(2)-AR and differentially modulates their traffic from the TGN to the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2023288863,"Peroxynitrite is formed in macrophages by the diffusion-limited reaction of superoxide and nitric oxide. This highly reactive species is thought to contribute to bacterial killing by interaction with diverse targets and nitration of protein tyrosines. This work presents for the first time a comprehensive analysis of transcriptional responses to peroxynitrite under tightly controlled chemostat growth conditions. Up-regulation of the cysteine biosynthesis pathway and an increase in S-nitrosothiol levels suggest S-nitrosylation to be a consequence of peroxynitrite exposure. Genes involved in the assembly/repair of iron-sulfur clusters also show enhanced transcription. Unexpectedly, arginine biosynthesis gene transcription levels were also elevated after treatment with peroxynitrite. Analysis of the negative regulator for these genes, ArgR, showed that post-translational nitration of tyrosine residues within this protein is responsible for its degradation in vitro. Further up-regulation was seen in oxidative stress response genes, including katG and ahpCF. However, genes known to be up-regulated by nitric oxide and nitrosating agents (e.g. hmp and norVW) were unaffected. Probabilistic modeling of the transcriptomic data identified five altered transcription factors in response to peroxynitrite exposure, including OxyR and ArgR. Hydrogen peroxide can be present as a contaminant in commercially available peroxynitrite preparations. Transcriptomic analysis of cells treated with hydrogen peroxide alone also revealed up-regulation of oxidative stress response genes but not of many other genes that are up-regulated by peroxynitrite. Thus, the cellular responses to peroxynitrite and hydrogen peroxide are distinct."

Here, we are reporting crystal structures of budding yeast Ufd2 in complex with the UBL domains of Rad23 and Dsk2 and the molecular details of their interaction interfaces. We identify a novel sequence pattern in the N-terminal UBL-binding region of budding yeast Ufd2, which is conserved in lower eukaryotes and is distinct from any known UBD identified so far. Moreover, despite engaging the same binding region, residue-specific differences exist in the interactions of the UBL domains of Rad23 and Dsk2 with Ufd2, which are coupled to subtle differences in their overall binding affinities. Mutational analyses of the binding surface of the UBL domains and a closer inspection of the thermodynamic contributions of those residues point to adaptive evolution as a factor shaping these interfaces. Cloning, site-directed mutagenesis, protein expression, and purification are described in the supplemental Experimental Procedures. For crystallization of the Ufd2·Rad23-UBL and Ufd2·Dsk2-UBL complexes, Ufd2 was incubated with Rad23-UBL or Dsk2-UBL at a molar ratio of 1:1.5 (77 μm Ufd2 and 115.5 μm UBL) for 1 h at 4 °C in the presence of 2 mm dithiothreitol. Crystals were grown by vapor diffusion in hanging drops containing equal volumes of protein in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol and a reservoir solution consisting of 16–18% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3500 and 200 mm K3-citrate, pH 8.3, equilibrated against the reservoir solution. Crystals were cryo-protected by soaking in mother liquor containing 15–20% (v/v) glycerol. They belong to space group P212121 with approximate cell dimensions of a = 65 Å, b = 126 Å, and c = 181 Å with one complex per asymmetric unit. Crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen, and data collection was performed at 100 K. Data were collected at beamlines ID14–4 (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), Grenoble, France) and BL 14.1 (Berliner Elektronenspeicherring-Gesellschaft für Synchrotronstrahlung (BESSY), Berlin, Germany) and processed using Mosflm and Scala (39Leslie A.G.W.

For subsequent calculations, the CCP4 suite was utilized (41Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) with exceptions as indicated.

Because Phaser could not find a solution for the UBL domain with different search models, this domain was fitted manually into the electron density using human ubiquilin 3 (PDB entry 1YQB) for the Ufd2·Rad23-UBL complex and the Dsk2-UBL domain (PDB entry 2BWF) for the Ufd2·Dsk2-UBL complex as a model.

DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). For pulldown assays, GST-tagged Ufd2 and variants were immobilized on glutathione (GSH) beads. In all experiments, 20 μl of GSH beads were incubated with 0.95 μm purified Ufd2 in 400 μl of phosphate-buffered saline buffer with 1 mm dithiothreitol and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 1 h. WT-Ufd2 and GST alone were included as controls. After centrifugation (1250 × g, 30 s), beads were washed five times with 400 μl of binding buffer. Purified UBL proteins (0.95 μm) in a total volume of 400 μl of binding buffer were added to immobilized Ufd2 and treated in the same way as in the first step. Immobilized proteins were analyzed by 17% (v/v) SDS-PAGE or by immunoblotting with an anti-His antibody. Proteins were extensively dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline buffer (pH 7.4, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) followed by degassing. In all experiments, 75–150 μm Rad23- and Dsk2-UBL proteins were titrated as the ligand into the sample cell containing 5–10 μm Ufd2. A volume of 10 μl of ligand was added at a time with a total number of 30 injections, resulting in a final molar ratio of ligand-to-protein varying between 3:1 and 4:1. All experiments were performed using a VP-ITC instrument (MicroCal, GE Healthcare) at 25 °C. Buffer-to-buffer, buffer-to-Ufd2, as well as Rad23-UBL/Dsk2-UBL-to-buffer titrations were performed as described above. Corrected data were analyzed with a single-site binding model using software supplied by the ITC manufacturer and non-linear least squares fitting to calculate the dissociation constant (Kd). SPR binding assays were performed alternatively on BIAcore X or BIAcore T100 instruments (GE Healthcare) at 25 °C in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 50 μm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.005% (v/v) Surfactant P20. 100 response units of His-tagged Rad23- or Dsk2-UBL were captured on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) sensor chip. GST-tagged Ufd2 for comparative binding assays and untagged Ufd2 for affinity analysis were applied to the UBL surfaces in random duplicates at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. After each cycle, the surface was regenerated using 350 mm EDTA in running buffer to remove bound Ni2+ and captured proteins. The BIAcore T100 evaluation software was used to calculate the steady state affinity constants. Data were plotted using GraphPad Prism. For comparative assays, the relative binding responses of the mutants to WT proteins were determined by obtaining the maximum response for each interaction at the end of each injection. Although Rad23 and Dsk2 interact with Ufd2 via their UBL domains (22Kim I. Mi K. Rao H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3357-3365Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 26Richly H. Rape M. Braun S. Rumpf S. Hoege C. Jentsch S. Cell. 2005; 120: 73-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), yeast two hybrid assays could only identify the isolated N-terminal fragment (residues 1–380) of Ufd2 as its UBL-interacting region (26Richly H. Rape M. Braun S. Rumpf S. Hoege C. Jentsch S. Cell. 2005; 120: 73-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Additional details regarding the Ufd2-UBL interactions have not been unraveled so far. To further characterize the interactions of Ufd2 with the UBLs of Rad23 and Dsk2, we performed GST pulldown assays with GST-tagged full-length Ufd2 and C-terminally His-tagged UBLs (Fig. 1A). Both UBLs were readily captured using immobilized GST-Ufd2. In contrast, the UBL domain of Ddi1, a third UBL-UBA protein, does not interact with Ufd2 (Fig. 1A) (22Kim I. Mi K. Rao H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3357-3365Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The differential binding of the Rad23- and Dsk2-UBLs to the proteasomal subunits Rpn1 and Rpn10 has been described (25Ishii T.

Hence, we used SPR interaction analysis to search for quantitative differences in their interactions. Steady state affinity analysis of Ufd2 on both Rad23-UBL (Fig. 1B, left panel, and 1C) and Dsk2-UBL surfaces (Fig. 1B, right panel, and 1C) provided a Kd of 55 ± 3 nm for the interaction of Rad23-UBL and a lower affinity for Dsk2-UBL with a Kd of 418 ± 56 nm. The binding of the UBLs of Rad23 and Dsk2 to Ufd2 was also analyzed by ITC to allow for a complete thermodynamic characterization (Fig. 1D). These studies resulted in a Kd of 70 ± 6 nm for the interaction of Rad23-UBL with Ufd2 and for the binding of Dsk2-UBL to Ufd2 in a 2–3-fold higher Kd of 175 ± 19 nm. Although there is an excellent agreement between SPR and ITC for the Rad23-Ufd2 interaction, the two methods show an ∼2-fold difference for the Dsk2-Ufd2 interaction. More importantly, the enthalpic and entropic components to the free energy are highly different between the two UBLs. The interaction of Rad23-UBL and Ufd2 is more exothermic (ΔH = −17.3 kcal/mol) when compared with Dsk2-UBL (ΔH = −10.1 kcal/mol). However, this is offset by a substantial decrease in entropy for Rad23-UBL (−TΔS = 7.4 kcal/mol), whereas the entropic contribution is minimal for the Dsk2-UBL interaction (−TΔS = 0.8 kcal/mol). We solved the structures of Ufd2 in complex with Rad23-UBL carrying either an N-terminal or a C-terminal His tag, which showed no significant structural differences. Due to better data quality, the structure of Ufd2 with a C-terminal His-tagged UBL is presented here. The Ufd2·Rad23-UBL complex was refined at 2.4 Å resolution to a crystallographic R-factor of 20.3% and a free R-factor of 25.7% (Table 1). As described previously (49Tu D. Li W. Ye Y. Brunger A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 15599-15606Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), Ufd2 is composed of an N-terminal variable domain, a core domain, and a C-terminal U-box domain with a fold similar to that of RING (really interesting new gene) domains, which are present in certain Ub ligases (Fig. 2A). Despite some conformational variability of the U-box domain, our Ufd2 structure in the complex is quite similar (1.5 Å root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation for 954 Cα atoms) to the published Ufd2 structure (49Tu D.

Open table in a new tab The N-terminal variable region of Ufd2 that binds to the UBL domain consists of eight α-helices. Helices α1 to α4 are arranged in a four-helix bundle, whereas helices α5 and α6 interact with α3 and α4 through hydrophobic contacts that are partly mediated by their connecting loops (Fig. 2B). The structure of Rad23-UBL is comprised of a five-stranded β-sheet, one α-helix, and one 310-helix (Fig. 2B). It displays a high degree of similarity with Ub (PDB entry 1UBQ, 1.1 Å r.m.s. deviation for 72 Cα atoms, z-score 14, 25% sequence identity) and the UBL domain of hHR23A (PDB entry 1P98, 1.6 Å r.m.s. deviation for 72 Cα atoms, z-score 11.3, 26% sequence identity), one of the two human homologs of budding yeast Rad23. Subsequently, we solved the structure of Ufd2 with Dsk2-UBL by molecular replacement. The UBL domain in the Ufd2·Dsk2-UBL complex exhibits increased flexibility; in particular, with a C-terminally tagged UBL domain, the first 30 amino acids of this domain were largely disordered (data not shown). With an N-terminally tagged protein, the Ufd2·Dsk2-UBL structure was refined at 2.4 Å resolution to a crystallographic R-factor of 21.0% and a free R-factor of 27.0% (Table 1). Both Rad23-UBL and Dsk2-UBL structures can be superimposed with an r.m.s. deviation of 1.1 Å for 71 aligned residues (z-score 13.6, 30% sequence identity). The Ufd2·UBL interface in the structure of the complex buries a total molecular surface of about 1260 Å2, which is comprised to ∼590 Å2 of the molecular surface of Ufd2 (∼1.3% of the total surface area) and ∼670 Å2 from UBL (∼14.6% of the total surface area). This interface is composed of almost equal parts of non-polar residues (38%), polar residues (33%), and charged residues (29%); however, there are only one salt bridge (UBL-Lys-10 Nζ–Ufd2-Glu-49 Oϵ1 with a distance of 2.6 Å) and two direct hydrogen bonds (UBL-Ser-47 Oγ–Ufd2-Arg-92 Nη2, UBL-Gln-52 Nϵ2–Ufd2-Glu-141 O at distances of 2.3 and 3.2 Å, respectively) present (Fig. 3A). Three UBL segments are contacting Ufd2 (Fig. 3A). Segment I is located in the loop connecting β-strands one and two, segment II involves β-strands three and four, and segment III is located in β-strand five. Ufd2 residues from helix α2 and α4 as well as the loop connecting α4 with α5 contribute to the Ufd2·UBL interface. These residues contact the hydrophobic surface of the UBL β-sheet in the region of β-strands 3, 4, and 5. Participating residues from Ufd2 include Leu-44, Tyr-97, Val-100, and Trp-107, which are located in the hydrophobic UBL pocket formed by residues Phe-9, Ile-45, Val-50, Val-69, and Met-71 of Rad23 (Fig. 3, A and B). For comparison, the principal recognition determinants in Ub are: 1) the hydrophobic pocket formed by the side chains of Leu-8 (Phe-9 in Rad23), Ile-44 (Ile-45 in Rad23), His-68 (Val-69 in Rad23), and Val-70 (Met-71 in Rad23) and 2) the main chain amide group of Gly-47 (Gly-48 in Rad23), which is involved in hydrogen bonding (50Ohno A. Jee J. Fujiwara K. Tenno T. Goda N. Tochio H. Kobayashi H. Hiroaki H. Shirakawa M. Structure. 2005; 13: 521-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Although the hydrophobic patch of Rad23-UBL is also crucial for its interaction with Ufd2, the main chain of Gly-48 does not form a hydrogen bond. Instead, the β-turn (Ser47–Gly48) connecting β-strands 3 and 4 is stabilized by the aforementioned strong hydrogen bond between Ufd2-Arg-92 and UBL-Ser-47, whereas Ufd2-Gly-96 and Ufd2-Tyr-97 contact UBL-Gly-48 (Fig. 3A). The aromatic ring of Ufd2-Tyr-97 is involved in a stacking interaction with the peptide bond between UBL residues 47 and 48 in this β-turn. The importance of interface residues was analyzed by mutagenesis experiments. Eleven residues from Ufd2 and nine from Rad23-UBL were each replaced with Ala. With the exception of the Rad23-UBL-G48A variant that showed a reduced expression, all Ufd2 and Rad23-UBL variants behaved like the WT protein during and after purification, indicating that they were correctly folded (data not shown). Initially, the contribution of these residues was studied by GST pulldown and comparative SPR binding assays (Table 2, supplemental Figs. S1 and S2A). In SPR studies, the relative binding responses of mutants to WT proteins were determined and compared. The majority of Rad23-UBL single mutants revealed reduced binding to Ufd2 with Rad23-UBL-I45A displaying the most prominent binding defect. The contribution of the remaining residues to the interaction is augmented in double mutants (supplemental Fig. S1C). Analysis of the Ufd2 variants by SPR showed a largely reduced binding of the residues located in the hydrophobic region of the UBL-binding pocket (Leu-44, Tyr-97, Val-100, and Phe-107) and Asp-40 (Table 2 and supplemental Fig. S2A).TABLE 2ITC and SPR parameters of Ufd2, Rad23-UBL, Dsk2-UBL, and variantsUfd2WT-UBLITCSPRaFor comparative SPR assays, the relative binding responses of the mutants to wt proteins were determined by obtaining the maximum response for each interaction at the end of injection.

Open table in a new tab ITC studies confirmed these results and allowed for a quantitative analysis (Table 2, supplemental Fig. S3 and supplemental Table S2). The most significant effect for Ufd2 was observed for all residues located in the hydrophobic UBL pocket. Mutation of Val-100 and Phe-107 to Ala completely abolished binding, the Y97A variant strongly reduced binding (1900-fold), and the I104A and L44A variants showed significantly decreased affinities (20- and 120-fold, respectively). Although not directly involved in complex formation (Fig. 3A), the Ufd2-D40A variant showed a 110-fold reduced affinity (Table 2), which probably is the result of the missing intramolecular hydrogen bond between Ufd2-Asp-40 and Ufd2-Tyr-97 (Oδ2–OH 2.5 Å). This hydrogen bond seems to be crucial for proper positioning of the aromatic side chain of Tyr-97 in the interface region and might be important to align helices α2 and α4 for inter"

Carbohydrates, whose structural diversity exceeds by far the number of protein folds, are ubiquitous molecules that alone, or in form of glycoconjugates, mediate many biological processes (1Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4987) Google Scholar). This extreme variety results from the diverse stereochemistry of the monosaccharide building blocks, from the enormous number of intersugar linkages they can form and to the fact that these molecules can decorate cell surface, large macromolecules (sugars themselves, proteins, nucleic acids), or small metabolites (lipids, antibiotics, etc). The breadth of the biological functions of carbohydrates, from the classical energetic and structural roles, is now well acknowledged although the mechanisms of the sugar code are not known in detail. They include the control of the correct protein folding and activity (2Caramelo J.J. Parodi A.J. Semin Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 18: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the mediation of molecular recognition events regulating cell-cell interactions (such as host-pathogen, cancer metastasis, etc.), cell signal transduction (nucleo-cytoplasm communication, differentiation, immune response, etc.) (for reviews see Refs. 1Varki A.

The number of CAZyme families is continuously increasing, thanks to the advent of new DNA sequencing techniques and subsequent sophisticated computer-aided sequence annotation procedures combined with new biochemical characterization. Interestingly, although the number of CAZy sequences increased 14-fold in the last 8 years, the number of enzymatic and structural characterization only doubled in the same time span, with at present <10% of total proteins in the CAZy database that have been characterized enzymatically (5Cantarel B.L.

This contrast clearly shows that, in comparison with highly automated sequencing techniques, enzymatic characterization of novel CAZymes is a longer and laborious process representing the limiting step for the full exploitation of genome sequencing efforts. Here, we report the cloning, the heterologous expression and the detailed enzymatic characterization of a novel GH from the hyperthermophilic Archaeon S. solfataricus. This enzyme, encoded by the ORF SSO1353 displays sequence similarity to several unknown proteins from the three domains of life (Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya) and, more distantly, to human non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase, also known as β-glucosidase 2 (GBA2) (6Boot R.G.

The enzymatic characterization of the product of gene sso1353 allowed us to demonstrate the retaining reaction mechanism followed by the enzyme, to evaluate its substrate specificity toward β-linked aromatic glucosides and xylosides, and to identify the catalytic amino acids in the active site. These results allowed us propose the role possibly played in vivo by this enzyme, which is expressed from a gene situated downstream of that coding for an endoglucanase in different Sulfolobus species. Finally, by virtue of the established commonalities within glycoside hydrolase families, the mechanistic data obtained with SSO1353 can be extended to all members of the newly created GH116 family including human GBA2.

The SSO1353 ORF was cloned by amplification of S. solfataricus, strain P2, chromosomal DNA via PCR by using the following synthetic oligonucleotides: 1353Fw, 5′-ggaattccatatggttacatatactgataagg-3′, 1353Rv, 5′-tacatgccatggctagaataggaagctcc-3′, which introduce an NdeI and NcoI sites at the 5′, just before the first ATG, and at the 3′-ends of the ORF, respectively. The program was as follows: 5 min at 95 °C, 1,5 min at 50 °C, and 4 min at 72 °C; 30 cycles at 95 °C for 45 s, 50 °C for 1,5 min, and 72 °C for 4 min; final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The resulting DNA fragment was cloned in the pET29a plasmid (Novagen), obtaining the vector pET1353, in which the SSO1353 ORF is under the control of the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside inducible T7 RNA polymerase promoter that drives high expression levels in bacterial hosts. The ORF obtained after amplification was controlled by DNA sequencing. The mutants E335G, D406G, D458G, D462G were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis from the pET1353 plasmid, by following the instructions of the manufacturer. The mutagenic oligonucleotides were the following (mismatches are underlined): E335Gmut, 5′-ATGGACAGTTCTGTGGTGCTCCGTAAATCGCA-3′; E335Grev, 5′-AGCACCACAGAACTGTCCATATTTAGGTAC-3′; D406Gmut, 5′-TTCTCCTCCCAGATGGAAGGGTATGAATCCGA-3′; D406Grev, 5′-CCTTCCATCTGGGAGGAGAAGTAGTACCAT-3′; D458Gmut, 5′-ATTCATGGAGGGAGAGATGGGCAATGCTTTTG-3′; D458Grev, 5′-CCATCTCTCCCTCCATGAATGGTAAATTCC-3′; D462Gmut, 5′-AGAGATGGACAATGCTTTTGGCGCTACCATCA-3′; D462Grev, 5′-CAAAAGCATTGTCCATCTCTCCCTCCATGA-3′. The genes containing the desired mutation were identified by direct sequencing and completely resequenced. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)Ril/pET1353 wild type and mutants were grown in 2 liters of LB at 37 °C supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml). Gene expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when the culture reached an A600 of 1.0. Growth was allowed to proceed for 16 h, and cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g. The resulting cell pellet was thawed, resuspended in 3 ml g−1 cells of 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and homogenized by French cell pressure treatment. After centrifugation for 30 min at 10,000 × g, the crude extract was incubated with Benzonase (Novagen) for 1 h at room temperature and then heat-fractionated for 30 min at 55 and 75 °C and for 20 min at 85 °C. The supernatant obtained after heat fractionations, equilibrated in 1 m ammonium sulfate, was applied to a HiLoad 26/10 phenyl Sepharose high performance (Amersham Biosciences), which had been equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, 1 m ammonium sulfate. After washing with 2 column volumes with the loading buffer, the protein was eluted with a linear gradient of water at a flow rate of 3 ml min−1; the protein eluted in 100% water. Active fractions were pooled, equilibrated in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl and concentrated by ultrafiltration on an Amicon YM30 membrane (cut off 30,000 Da). For the wild-type enzyme, after concentration, the sample was loaded onto a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 prep grade column (Amersham Biosciences). Active fractions were pooled and concentrated; protein concentration was determined with the method of Bradford (8Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). The SSO1353 wild type and mutants were 95% pure by SDS-PAGE and were stored at 4 °C. The molecular mass of native SSO1353 wild type was determined by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 FPLC column (Amersham Biosciences); molecular weight markers were albumin (66,000), alcohol dehydrogenase (150,000), β-amylase (200,000), and apoferritin (443,000). The standard assay for SSO1353 activity was performed in 50 mm sodium citrate buffer at pH 5.5 at 65 °C on the indicated substrates. Typically, in each assay we used 1–10 μg of SSO1353 in the final volume of 1.0 ml. Kinetic constants of SSO1353 wild type and D462G mutant on aryl glycosides 4Np-Glc, 4Np-Xyl, and 2Np-Glc were measured at standard conditions at 65 °C by using concentrations of substrate ranging between 1 and 150 mm. The ϵmm extinction coefficients at 405 nm for 2- and 4-nitrophenol under standard conditions and 65 °C were 1.1 and 3.3 mm−1 cm−1, respectively. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the hydrolysis of 1 μmol of substrate in 1 min at the conditions described. The metal dependence of the wild-type enzyme was evaluated using 5 mm 4Np-Xyl as substrate in the presence of 1 mm EDTA and 5 mm MgCl2 or MnCl2, in standard conditions. The activity of the wild-type enzyme on different aryl glycosides was tested in 50 mm sodium citrate buffer at pH 5.5 at 65 °C. Typically, in each assay we used 70 μg of SSO1353 in a final volume of 0.2 ml. The reaction was started by adding the enzyme, and it was stopped by adding 0.8 ml of 1 m iced sodium carbonate. The optical density of the solution was measured at 420 nm at room temperature. The molar extinction coefficients of 4-nitrophenol and 2-nitrophenol, measured at 420 nm, at room temperature and in 1 m sodium carbonate buffer were 17.2 and 4.7 mm−1 cm−1, respectively. In all of the assays, spontaneous hydrolysis of the substrate was subtracted by using appropriate blank mixtures without the enzyme. The chemically rescued activity of the D462G mutant was measured in 50 mm sodium citrate buffer at pH 5.5 on 40 mm 2Np-Glc at 65 °C as described above; where indicated, the assay mixture was supplemented with the indicated concentrations of sodium azide as external nucleophile. In all of the assays, spontaneous hydrolysis of the substrate was subtracted by using appropriate blank mixtures without the enzyme. Aliquots of the reaction mixtures were analyzed on a silica gel 60 F254 TLC by using ethyl acetate/methanol/water (70:20:10 v/v) as eluant and were detected by exposure to 4% α-naphthol in 10% sulfuric acid in ethanol followed by charring. The β-d-glucosyl azide isolated from the enzymatic reaction mixture of the D462G mutant was identified by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. NMR: δ 4.75 H-1 (d, 3JH1,H2 = 8.8 Hz), δ 91.4 C-1; δ 3.25 H-2 (t), δ 74.0 C-2; δ 3.51 H-3 (t), δ 76.9 C-3; δ 3.41 H-4 (t), δ 70.5 C-4; δ 3.53 H-5 (m), δ 79.0 C-5; δ 3.73 H-6a (dd), δ 3.90 H-6b (dd), 61.6 C-6. The activity of the wild-type enzyme in the presence of 0.5–2.0 mg ml−1 Triton X-100 or CHAPS was determined on 20 mm 4Np-Glc as described above. The activity of the wild type on β-d-oligosaccharides of glucose (G3 to G5) (5 mm) and xylose (X2 to X5) (2.5 mm) was tested in 50 mm sodium citrate buffer at pH 5.5, by using 12–63 μg of enzyme, at 65 °C in a final volume of 0.2 ml. Aliquots of the reaction mixtures were analyzed by TLC by using ethyl acetate/acetic acid/isopropanol/formic acid/water (50:20:10:2:30 v/v) (for G3-G5) or acetone/isopropylic alcohol/water (60:30:15 v/v) (for X2–X5) as the eluant and were detected as described above. The activity of the wild type on glucocerebroside (Matreya), octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (Sigma), and gangliosides, measured at the same conditions was analyzed by TLC by using chloroform/methanol/CaCl2 15 mm (60:40:9 v/v). The steady-state kinetic constants of the wild type on MU-Glc and MU-Xyl were calculated by following a slight modified method already described (9Mackenzie L.F. Brooke G.S. Cutfield J.F. Sullivan P.A. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3161-3167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, the enzyme activity was determined fluorimetrically with MU-Glc (0.1–6 mm) and MU-Xyl (0.025–5 mm) as substrates in 50 mm sodium citrate buffer at pH 5.5, by using 1 μg of the enzyme. Assays (0.25 ml final volume) were conducted for 1–5 min at 65 °C, and the reaction was stopped with 0.5 ml of 0.1 m glycine-NaOH buffer, pH 10.3. The formation of the methylumbelliferone was measured by emission at 450 nm with excitation at 384 nm. In all of the assays, spontaneous hydrolysis of the substrate was subtracted by using appropriate blank mixtures without the enzyme. All kinetic data were calculated as the average of at least two experiments and were plotted and refined with the program GraFit (10Leatherbarrow R.J. Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, UK1992Google Scholar). The effect of the inhibitor 2,4-dinitrophenyl-β-d-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-glucopyranoside (2,4DNp-2F-Glc) (Sigma) was analyzed as previously performed by Shaikh et al. (11Shaikh F.A. Müllegger J. He S. Withers S.G. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 2441-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, wild-type SSO1353 (0.1 μg/μl) was incubated at 45 °C in mixtures containing 0.3, 3.0, 7.0, and 18.0 mm concentrations of inhibitor and 50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.5. An identical mixture containing all the reagents with the exception of the enzyme was prepared as control. At time intervals, aliquots from the two mixtures were withdrawn and used to measure the enzymatic activity and as blank, respectively. Assays were performed on 60 mm 2Np-Glc in standard conditions. Initial rates at each time point were elaborated as described in Ref. 11Shaikh F.A. Müllegger J. He S. Withers S.G. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 2441-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar to measure the inactivation parameters Ki and ki with GraFit (10Leatherbarrow R.J. Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, UK1992Google Scholar). To determine the effect of the inhibitors N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ) and conduritol β-epoxide (CBE), SSO1353 (11 μg) was incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of the inhibitors (0.1–5 mm for NB-DNJ and 0.1–2 mm for CBE) in 50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.5, for 30 min at 45 °C, in a final volume of 80 μl. Identical mixtures containing all the reagents with the exception of the inhibitor were used to determine the 100% of activity. After incubation, the samples were diluted 3-fold in 5 mm MU-Glc, 50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.5 in a final volume of 0.25 ml, and assayed as described above. Wild-type SSO1353 (7–148 μg), was incubated in 50 mm sodium citrate buffer pH 5.5 with 5 mm 4Np-Xyl or 4Np-Glc, or both, at 5 mm each, at 65 °C for 16 h in a final volume of 0.2–1 ml. Identical mixtures containing all the reagents but the enzyme were prepared as control. Where specified, after incubation, 50 μg of the β-glycosidase from S. solfataricus (Ssβ-gly) were added to aliquots (90 μl) of the reaction mixtures and further incubated 2 h at 65 °C. All the reactions were examined by TLC by using ethyl acetate/methanol/water (70:20:10 v/v) as eluant as described above. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in D2O at 600 MHz with a spectrometer equipped with a cryo probe, in the FT mode at 303 K. 1H chemical shifts are expressed in δ relative to HOD signal (4.72 ppm). The linkage analysis of the oligosaccharide was obtained by methylation according to Ciucanu procedure, as already reported (12Perugino G. Falcicchio P. Corsaro M.M. Matsui I. Parrilli M. Rossi M. Moracci M. Biocat. Biotrans. 2006; 24: 23-29Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The sample obtained was injected into GC-MS and partially methylated alditol acetates were recognized from their EI-MS spectra and by comparison with pure synthetic standards. Partially methylated alditol acetates were analyzed on an Agilent Technologies gas chromatograph 6850A equipped with a mass selective detector 5973N and a Zebron ZB-5 capillary column (Phenomenex, 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., flow rate 1 ml/min, He as carrier gas). The temperature program was: 90 °C for 1 min, 90 °C → 140 °C at 25 °C min−1, 140 °C → 200 °C at 5 °C min−1, 200 °C → 280 °C at 10 °C min−1, 280 °C for 10 min. The reaction mixture was purified by reverse phase chromatography (Polar-RP 80A, Phenomenex, 4 μ, 250 × 10 mm) on an Agilent HPLC instrument 1100 series, using H2O/CH3OH 6/4 with 20 mm trifluoroacetic acid (final concentration) as eluant. The eluted products were first analyzed by positive ions reflectron MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The trisaccharide β-Xyl-(1→4)-β-Xyl-O-4-Np showed a pseudomolecular ion (M+Na)+ at m/z 425.94 (calculated m/z 426.10) and the methylation analysis indicated the presence of terminal xylopyranose and 4-substituted xylopyranose. NMR: δ 5.24 H-1A (d, JH-1,H-2 = 7.3 Hz), δ 101.0 C-1A; 3.66 H-2A (t), δ 73.7 C-2A; δ 3.72 H-3A (t), δ 74.5 C-3A; δ 3.89 H-4A (m), δ 77.4 C-4A; δ 4.19 Ha-5A (dd), δ 3.62 Hb-5A (t), δ 64.3 C-5A; δ 4.49 H-1B (d, JH-1,H-2 = 7.3 Hz), δ 103.1 C-1B; 3.29 H-2B (t), δ 74.0 C-2A; δ 3.44 H-3B (t), δ 76.9 C-3B; δ 3.62 H-4B (m), δ 70.4 C-4B; δ 3.99 Ha-5B (dd), δ 3.32 Hb-5B (t), δ 66.5 C-5B. The trisaccharide β-Xyl-(1→4)-β-Xyl-(1→4)-β-Xyl-O-4-Np showed a pseudomolecular ion in a MALDI-TOF-MS (M+Na)+ at m/z 557.82 (calculated m/z 558.15); methylation analysis: terminal xylopyranose and 4-substituted xylopyranose. NMR: δ 5.25 H-1A (d, JH-1,H-2 = 7.3 Hz), δ 101.2 C-1A; 3.66 H-2A (t), δ 73.8 C-2A; δ 3.72 H-3A (t), δ 74.6 C-3A; δ 3.90 H-4A (m), δ 77.3 C-4A; δ 4.19 Ha-5A (dd), δ 3.62 Hb-5A (t), δ 64.3 C-5A; δ 4.51 H-1B (d, JH-1,H-2 = 7.3 Hz), δ 103.0 C-1B; 3.31 H-2B (t), δ 74.0 C-2A; δ 3.56 H-3B (t), δ 75.0 C-3B; δ 3.80 H-4B (m), δ 77.6 C-4B; δ 4.12 Ha-5B (dd), δ 3.39 Hb-5B (t); δ 64.3 C-5B; δ 4.47 H-1C (d, JH-1,H-2 = 7.3 Hz), δ 103.1 C-1C; δ 3.26 H-2C (t), δ 74.1 C-2C; δ 3.43 H-3C (t), δ 76.9 C-3C; δ 3.63 H-4C (m), δ 70.4 C-4C; δ 3.97 Ha-5C (dd), δ 3.31 Hb-5C (t); δ 66.5 C-5C. Samples were analyzed using a triple quadrupole time of flight instrument (QSTAR Elite, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA/Toronto, Canada) equipped with a nanoflow electrospray ion source. Pulled silica capillary (170 μm outer diameter/100 μm inner diameter, tip 30 μm inner diameter) was used as nanoflow tip. For the analysis of intact proteins, 4 μg of samples were purified using ZipTip C4 (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Proteins were eluted by 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. Purified proteins (10 μm) were loaded into the ion source at 300 nl/min flow rate using a syringe pump. Single-stage ESI mass spectra were acquired in the range of m/z 300–2000. For protein molecular mass determination three independent measurements were performed. The expected mass error on the average molecular mass of intact proteins was about ±0.01%. For data acquisition and Bayesian protein reconstruction the Analyst QS 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA/Toronto, Canada) was used. Wild-type SSO1353 (22 μg, 0.3 nmol) was incubated with 2.9 mm 2,4-dinitrophenyl-β-d-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-glucopyranoside (2,4DNp-2F-Glc) (Sigma) at 1:1000 enzyme/inhibitor ratio in 50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.5 at 45 °C. An identical mixture containing all the reagents with the exception of the inhibitor was prepared as control. At time intervals, aliquots from the two mixtures were withdrawn and assayed on 60 mm 2Np-Glc in standard conditions. Samples (0.086 μg/μl) were enzymatically digested in the acidified inhibition buffer (formic acid to 5% (v/v) final concentration, pH 2) using pepsin from porcine stomach mucosa (3,260 units/mg, Sigma-Aldrich) at 1:20 enzyme to substrate ratio at 37 °C for 30 min. Resulting peptide mixtures (5 μl) were loaded, purified, and concentrated on a monolithic trap column (200 μm inner diameter × 5 mm, LCPackings, Sunnyvale, CA) at 25 μl/min flow rate and separated by nanoflow reverse-phase chromatography on a PS-DVB monolithic column (200 μm inner diameter × 5 cm, LCPackings) at 300 nl/min using an UltiMateTM 3000 HPLC (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA). The following solvents and gradient conditions were used: solvent A: 2% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid and 0.025% trifluoroacetic acid, solvent B: 98% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid and 0.025% trifluoroacetic acid, gradient: 5–50% B in 40 min, 50–98% B in 6 s. Eluting peptides were directly analyzed by nano-ESI-MS in positive ion mode using information-dependent acquisition (IDA). The two most abundant multiply charged ions were automatically selected and subjected for collision induced dissociation experiments. Nitrogen was used as collision gas. Tandem mass spectra were analyzed by manual inspection and by the use of Mascot Server (version 2.2). Peak lists for Mascot containing all acquired MS/MS spectra were generated by Analyst QS 2.0 software using the default parameters. Mascot was set up to search database containing a single protein (SSO1353) sequence extracted from NCBInr and was run with a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.1 Da and a parent ion tolerance of 50 ppm. MS/MS ion score cut-off was set to 10. No enzyme was specified. 2F-Glc was defined as variable modification in Mascot searches. Three independent inhibition experiments were performed and on each resulting samples two analytical measurements were run. Gapped BLAST searches (13Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59933) Google Scholar) were performed against the non-redundant protein set at the NCBI and against classified and unclassified sequences present in carbohydrate-active enzymes database (CAZy) (5Cantarel B.L. Coutinho P.M. Rancurel C. Bernard T. Lombard V. Henrissat B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D233-D238Crossref PubMed Scopus (4141) Google Scholar). A total of 90 sequences were used to define new family. This family includes proteins from archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic origin, several already collected in CAZy by similarity to human non-lysosomal bile acid β-glucosidase 2 (Gba2), but not yet assigned to a family. This family was designated as glycoside hydrolase family 116 and will be released in CAZy. The sequences were aligned with Muscle 3.7 (14Edgar R.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1792-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (30533) Google Scholar), and the resulting alignments were subsequently manipulated and analyzed with an in-house modified version of Jalview (15Waterhouse A.M. Procter J.B. Martin D.M. Clamp M. Barton G.J. Bioinformatics. 2009; 25: 1189-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (5782) Google Scholar). 3P. M. Coutinho and B. Henrissat, unpublished data. Estimated sequence distances were determined by maximum likelihood using LG distances (16Le S.Q. Gascuel O. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2008; 25: 1307-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (2031) Google Scholar) and constructed a distance tree using the Ward hierarchical clustering method (17Ward J.H. J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 1963; 58: 236-244Crossref Scopus (13441) Google Scholar). The inspection of the genomic sequence of the archaeon S. solfataricus, strain P2, revealed an ORF downstream of the gene sso1354 encoding for an endoglucanase (Fig. S1) (18Maurelli L. Giovane A. Esposito A. Moracci M. Fiume I. Rossi M. Morana A. Extremophiles. 2008; 12: 689-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Sso1353 is presently annotated as an hypothetical protein while the other ORFs in this cluster, sso1351, sso1352, and sso1355, are a putative permease, a transcriptional regulator, and a carboxypeptidase, respectively. ORFs sso1354 and sso1353 are transcribed in the same direction and are separated by 57 bp in which the latter ORF is preceded by a putative promoter formed by an AT-rich box A (centered at −30 nt from ATG) and a TFB-responsive element (centered at −38 nt) (not shown). Northern blot analysis showed that sso1353 is expressed as an isolated gene (not shown) and the absence of a clear Shine-Dalgarno-like motif in the intergenic region suggests that sso1353 gene is translated as a leaderless gene (19Torarinsson E. Klenk H.P. Garrett R.A. Environ Microbiol. 2005; 7: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Initial gapped BLAST searches (13Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59933) Google Scholar) revealed that SSO1353 is similar to proteins of unknown function from Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya and, to a lesser extent, to eukaryotic non-lysosomal bile acid β-glucosidases. The higher sequence identity scores (>31%) were with archaeal proteins with the highest (86%) with loci sso1948 from S. solfataricus, strain P2, and M1425_092"
https://openalex.org/W2048516545,"Background CXCL14 is a chemoattractant for macrophages and immature dendritic cells. We recently reported that CXCL14-deficient (CXCL14−/−) female mice in the mixed background are protected from obesity-induced hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. The decreased macrophage infiltration into visceral adipose tissues and the increased insulin sensitivity of skeletal muscle contributed to these phenotypes. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we performed a comprehensive study for the body weight control of CXCL14−/− mice in the C57BL/6 background. We show that both male and female CXCL14−/− mice have a 7–11% lower body weight compared to CXCL14+/− and CXCL14+/+ mice in adulthood. This is mainly caused by decreased food intake, and not by increased energy expenditure or locomotor activity. Reduced body weight resulting from the CXCL14 deficiency was more pronounced in double mutant CXCL14−/−ob/ob and CXCL14−/−Ay mice. In the case of CXCL14−/−Ay mice, oxygen consumption was increased compared to CXCL14+/−Ay mice, in addition to the reduced food intake. In CXCL14−/− mice, fasting-induced up-regulation of Npy and Agrp mRNAs in the hypothalamus was blunted. As intracerebroventricular injection of recombinant CXCL14 did not change the food intake of CXCL14−/− mice, CXCL14 could indirectly regulate appetite. Intriguingly, the food intake of CXCL14−/− mice was significantly repressed when mice were transferred to a novel environment. Conclusions/Significance We demonstrated that CXCL14 is involved in the body weight control leading to the fully obese phenotype in leptin-deficient or Ay mutant mice. In addition, we obtained evidence indicating that CXCL14 may play an important role in central nervous system regulation of feeding behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2114562248,"The serpin ZPI is a protein Z (PZ)-dependent specific inhibitor of membrane-associated factor Xa (fXa) despite having an unfavorable P1 Tyr. PZ accelerates the inhibition reaction approximately 2000-fold in the presence of phospholipid and Ca(2+). To elucidate the role of PZ, we determined the x-ray structure of Gla-domainless PZ (PZ(DeltaGD)) complexed with protein Z-dependent proteinase inhibitor (ZPI). The PZ pseudocatalytic domain bound ZPI at a novel site through ionic and polar interactions. Mutation of four ZPI contact residues eliminated PZ binding and membrane-dependent PZ acceleration of fXa inhibition. Modeling of the ternary Michaelis complex implicated ZPI residues Glu-313 and Glu-383 in fXa binding. Mutagenesis established that only Glu-313 is important, contributing approximately 5-10-fold to rate acceleration of fXa and fXIa inhibition. Limited conformational change in ZPI resulted from PZ binding, which contributed only approximately 2-fold to rate enhancement. Instead, template bridging from membrane association, together with previously demonstrated interaction of the fXa and ZPI Gla domains, resulted in an additional approximately 1000-fold rate enhancement. To understand why ZPI has P1 tyrosine, we examined a P1 Arg variant. This reacted at a diffusion-limited rate with fXa, even without PZ, and predominantly as substrate, reflecting both rapid acylation and deacylation. P1 tyrosine thus ensures that reaction with fXa or most other arginine-specific proteinases is insignificant unless PZ binds and localizes ZPI and fXa on the membrane, where the combined effects of Gla-Gla interaction, template bridging, and interaction of fXa with Glu-313 overcome the unfavorability of P1 Tyr and ensure a high rate of reaction as an inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W2024329084,"Survivin and Plk1 kinase are important mediators of cell survival that are required for chromosome alignment, cytokinesis, and protection from apoptosis. Interference with either survivin or Plk1 activity manifests many similar outcomes: prometaphase delay/arrest, multinucleation, and increased apoptosis. Moreover, the expression of both survivin and Plk1 is deregulated in cancer. Given these similarities, we speculated that these two proteins may cooperate during mitosis and/or in cell death pathways. Here we report that survivin and Plk1 interact during mitosis and that Plk1 phosphorylates survivin at serine 20. Importantly, we find that overexpression of a non-phosphorylatable version, S20A, is unable to correct chromosomes connected to the spindle in a syntelic manner during prometaphase and allows cells harboring these maloriented chromosomes to enter anaphase, evading the spindle tension checkpoint. By contrast, the constitutive phosphomimic, S20D, completes congression and division ahead of schedule and, unlike S20A, is able to support proliferation in the absence of the endogenous protein. Despite the importance of this residue in mitosis, its mutation does not appear to affect the anti-apoptotic activity of survivin in response to TRAIL. Together, these data suggest that phosphorylation of survivin at Ser<sup>20</sup> by Plk1 kinase is essential for accurate chromosome alignment and cell proliferation but is dispensable for its anti-apoptotic activity in cancer cells."

Apoptosis resistance depends on the increased expression and stabilization of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (cIAPs) and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP). Here we investigated the role of XIAP in experimental pulmonary infection of mice with C. pneumoniae. XIAP knock out (KO) mice were sensitized for C. pneumoniae infection compared with wild type mice. XIAP was involved in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of nitric oxide (NO) and endotoxin shock. Hyper-secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and lower NO in LPS-treated KO mouse macrophages revealed its regulatory role in inflammatory responses. Unexpectedly, activating stimuli like LPS, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, or interferon-gamma very efficiently induced apoptotic cell death in KO macrophages but not in wild type macrophages. Cell survival transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65 levels were reduced in lungs and pulmonary macrophages of infected KO mice. Furthermore, a reduced CD8 T cell population and their increased sensitivity for concanavalin A and chlamydial HSP60 stimulation revealed a defect in CD8 T cells in XIAP KO mice. These data demonstrated a role of XIAP for the integrity of both innate and cellular immune responses during C. pneumoniae infection."
https://openalex.org/W2131009179,"MTA1 (metastasis-associated protein 1), an integral component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex, has recently been implicated in the ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage response. However, whether MTA1 also participates in the UV-induced DNA damage checkpoint pathway remains unknown. In response to UV radiation, ATR (ataxia teleangiectasia- and Rad3-related) is the major kinase activated that orchestrates cell cycle progression with DNA repair machinery by phosphorylating and activating a number of downstream substrates, such as Chk1 (checkpoint kinase 1) and H2AX (histone 2A variant X). Here, we report that UV radiation stabilizes MTA1 in an ATR-dependent manner and increases MTA1 binding to ATR. On the other hand, depletion of MTA1 compromises the ATR-mediated Chk1 activation following UV treatment, accompanied by a marked down-regulation of Chk1 and its interacting partner Claspin, an adaptor protein that is required for the phosphorylation and activation of Chk1 by ATR. Furthermore, MTA1 deficiency decreases the induction of phosphorylated H2AX (referred to as gamma-H2AX) and gamma-H2AX focus formation after UV treatment. Consequently, depletion of MTA1 results in a defect in the G(2)-M checkpoint and increases cellular sensitivity to UV-induced DNA damage. Thus, MTA1 is required for the activation of the ATR-Claspin-Chk1 and ATR-H2AX pathways following UV treatment, and the noted abrogation of the DNA damage checkpoint in the MTA1-depleted cells may be, at least in part, a consequence of dysregulation of the expression of these two pathways. These findings suggest that, in addition to its role in the repair of double strand breaks caused by ionizing radiation, MTA1 also participates in the UV-induced ATR-mediated DNA damage checkpoint pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2055236327,"Evidence accumulates that in clinically relevant cell death, both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathway synergistically contribute to organ failure. In search for an inhibitor of apoptosis that provides effective blockage of these pathways, we analyzed viral proteins that evolved to protect the infected host cells. In particular, the cowpox virus protein crmA has been demonstrated to be capable of blocking key caspases of both pro-apoptotic pathways. To deliver crmA into eukaryotic cells, we fused the TAT protein transduction domain of HIV to the N terminus of crmA. In vitro, the TAT-crmA fusion protein was efficiently translocated into target cells and inhibited apoptosis mediated through caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3 after stimulation with α-Fas, etoposide, doxorubicin, or staurosporine. The extrinsic apoptotic pathway was investigated following α-Fas stimulation. In vivo 90% of TAT-crmA-treated animals survived an otherwise lethal dose of α-Fas and showed protection from Fas-induced organ failure. To examine the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, we investigated the survival of mice treated with an otherwise lethal dose of doxorubicin. Whereas all control mice died within 31 days, 40% of mice that concomitantly received intraperitoneal injections of TAT-crmA survived. To test the ability to comprehensively block both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathway in a clinically relevant setting, we employed a murine cardiac ischemia-reperfusion model. TAT-crmA reduced infarction size by 40% and preserved left ventricular function. In summary, these results provide a proof of principle for the inhibition of apoptosis with TAT-crmA, which might provide a new treatment option for ischemia-reperfusion injuries.

https://openalex.org/W2081202103,"Whether signal transduction pathways regulate epigenetic states in response to environmental cues remains poorly understood. We demonstrate here that Smad3, signaling downstream of transforming growth factor β, interacts with the zinc finger domain of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), a nuclear protein known to act as “the master weaver of the genome.” This interaction occurs via the Mad homology 1 domain of Smad3. Although Smad2 and Smad4 fail to interact, an alternatively spliced form of Smad2 lacking exon 3 interacts with CTCF. CTCF does not perturb well established transforming growth factor β gene responses. However, Smads and CTCF co-localize to the H19 imprinting control region (ICR), which emerges as an insulator in cis and regulator of transcription and replication in trans via direct CTCF binding to the ICR. Smad recruitment to the ICR requires intact CTCF binding to this locus. Smad2/3 binding to the ICR requires Smad4, which potentially provides stability to the complex. Because the CTCF-Smad complex is not essential for the chromatin insulator function of the H19 ICR, we propose that it can play a role in chromatin cross-talk organized by the H19 ICR.

Genomic imprinting is manifested by the translation of gametic marks into the parent of origin-dependent gene expression patterns. The neighboring Igf2 (insulin-like growth factor 2) and H19 genes are generally considered the paradigms of genomic imprinting because their expression is monoallelic from opposite parental alleles and governed by shared enhancers (1Ohlsson R.

CTCF has a central domain comprised by 11 zinc fingers, flanked by long N- and C-terminal domains. Although CTCF interacts with only the unmethylated, maternal H19 ICR allele, it also protects this region from de novo methylation.

Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) is a secreted cytokine with vital functions during embryogenesis, adult tissue homeostasis, and disease pathogenesis, such as with cancer (10Massagué J. Cell. 2008; 134: 215-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2936) Google Scholar, 11Wu M.Y. Hill C.S. Dev. Cell. 2009; 16: 329-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). TGFβ signals via Smad proteins (Smad2 and Smad3) that are phosphorylated by the cell surface TGFβ type I receptor and rapidly move to the nucleus in association with the common mediator Smad4, where they regulate transcription (12Moustakas A. Heldin C.H. Development. 2009; 136: 3699-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Smad3, upon phosphorylation by the TGFβ type I receptor and entry to the nucleus, binds efficiently to the DNA sequence 5′-CAGACA-3′, also known as the Smad-binding element (SBE) (13Shi Y. Wang Y.F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massagué J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Despite the established role of TGFβ and its family members in developmental processes, connections between TGFβ signaling and control of the epigenome have not been made. Here we describe a novel cross-talk between CTCF and the Smad pathway of TGFβ. CTCF forms complexes with Smads, and together they are recruited to the H19 ICR. Smad recruitment requires prior CTCF binding to the ICR. Although TGFβ signaling regulates expression of Igf2, this feature involves only the already active paternal allele. Although this observation rules out an effect on chromatin insulator function, we propose that TGFβ signaling may influence cross-talk between chromatin fibers. This proposal is in keeping with the co-adaptor function of the Smad complex and hence its ability to establish interactions within and between chromosomes. Mouse mammary epithelial NMuMG, human mammary carcinoma MDA-MB-468, human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2, and human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection and cultured as described previously (14Kowanetz M.

For short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of endogenous CTCF, NMuMG or HepG2 cells at 80% confluency were transfected with CTCF siRNA (Dharmacon Inc.) using Dharmafect reagent (Dharmacon Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. siRNAs were transfected at a concentration of 5–20 nm in 6-well plates for 48 h, and in some experiments, after 24 h, the treatment with siRNA was repeated (double treatment). For stimulation experiments with TGFβ1, the cells were starved by replacing the medium with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% serum for 8 h minimum before the end of the siRNA treatment. The CTCF siRNA pool was from Dharmacon Inc. (L-20165-00-0020, human CTCF, NM_006565) and contained four siRNAs: ON-targetplus SMARTpool siRNA J-20165-07, GAUGAAGACUGAAGUAAUG; ON-targetplus SMARTpool siRNA J-20165-08, GGAGAAACGAAGAAGAGUA; ON-targetplus SMARTpool siRNA J-20165-09, GAAGAUGCCUGCCACUUAC; and ON-targetplus SMARTpool siRNA J-20165-10, GAACAGCCCAUAAACAUAG. The nonsilencing siRNA controls used in this study were either siScrambled or siLuciferase from Dharmacon Inc. Associations between transfected FLAG-tagged CTCF and Myc6-tagged Smad2, Smad3, or Smad4 in HEK293T cells and between endogenous CTCF and Smad3 in HepG2 cells were monitored as described previously by co-immunoprecipitation assays in total cell lysates (17Morén A.

The sequence of the double-stranded 4× CAGA oligonucleotide is: 5′-CAGACAGTCAGACAGTCAGACAGTCAGACAGT-3′ (sense strand) and 5′-ACTGTCTGACTGTCTGACTGTCTGACTGTCTG-3′ (antisense strand). The FLAG-tagged CTCF cDNA from pCDNA3-FLAG-CTCF was subjected to in vitro transcription and translation using the TnT quick coupled transcription/translation system, following the supplier's instructions (Promega). Briefly, 1 μg of plasmid was incubated for 1 h at 30 °C in a reaction mix containing the rabbit reticulocyte lysate, T7 RNA polymerase, nucleotides, salts, recombinant RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor, and 20 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). A control without plasmid in the reaction mix was used to monitor for unspecific translation products. Cell extracts from NMuMG cells or reticulocyte lysates after in vitro translation were incubated in the presence of GST-Sepharose beads to wash away the unspecific binding by incubating on a rotating wheel for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing with lysis buffer containing increasing amounts of NaCl, the beads were washed with lysis buffer, and the final pellet was directly resuspended in the sample buffer, loaded on acrylamide gel, and subjected to electrophoresis. The amount and the quality of GST fusion proteins incubated with the lysates were monitored on a gel stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. GST pulldown from transfected NMuMG cell extracts was analyzed by anti-FLAG immunoblotting. GST pulldown from in vitro translated plasmids was analyzed after drying the acrylamide gel and phosphorimaging (with a FUJIFILM FLA-3000 unit and associated software) to visualize the radioactively labeled proteins. Approximately 106 subconfluent NMuMG cells or the corresponding number of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with or without 4 h of stimulation with 5 ng/ml TGFβ1 were cross-linked at 37 °C for 10 min using 1% paraformaldehyde. The cross-linking was quenched with 0.125 m glycine, and the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors. After centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in 200 μl of SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) and incubated on ice for 10 min. The chromatin was sheared by sonication (with a Branson Digital Sonifier) to an average size of 1 kb as described previously (22Schübeler D. Scalzo D. Kooperberg C. van Steensel B. Delrow J. Groudine M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) and precleared by incubating with Sepharose A or G 4 Fast Flow from Amersham Biosciences with slow rotation overnight at 4 °C. The Sepharose beads were previously washed three times in 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mg/ml herring sperm DNA from Invitrogen. At this step, a fraction of the precleared chromatin was kept as input material, and each ChIP reaction (∼10 μg of chromatin) was incubated with 1 μg of antibody at 4 °C for 4 h. After this, 60 μl of Sepharose A/G 4 Fast Flow beads were added to each reaction. The chromatin antibody-Sepharose bead complexes were washed as follows: 30 min in low salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl), 15 min in high salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl), 15 min in LiCl wash buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Igepal-CA630, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and twice for 20 min in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). The DNA-protein complexes were eluted with 2× 250 μl of freshly made elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3). To reverse the cross-links, 20 μl of 5 m NaCl was added to each of the samples, which were incubated at 65 °C overnight. The proteins were degraded by proteinase K (Amersham Biosciences), and DNA was extracted by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction, purified, and resuspended in water. All of the ChIP experiments were repeated three times or more. The DNA obtained from the chromatin immunoprecipitation was analyzed together with a sample to which no antibody had been added and a dilution of the input material (130) using quantitative (Q) real time PCR. Q-PCR primers and TaqMan probes (Table 1) were designed to amplify and analyze the wild type and mutated H19 ICR. All of the Q-PCR analyses were done in triplicate and repeated a minimum of three times. All of the reactions were performed using iCycler iQTM0 170–8740 and iQ Supermix (Bio-Rad), with the following cycling conditions: 95 °C for 3 min and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s and 65 °C for 45 s.TABLE 1Q-PCR primer and probe sequencesClone 704 forward primer5′-GAT TAC ATC AGT TAG GGG TC-3′Clone 704 reverse primer5′-GCC ACC ACC TGT ATT GGC AG-3′KvDMR (Kcnq1) forward primer5′-GTG TGC TTT TCT CTG CAT GG-3′KvDMR (Kcnq1) reverse primer5′-CAG GAC AAA CAC TGA GGA GG-3′H19 ICR CTCF-binding site 3 forward primer5′-GCT GTT ATG TGC AAC AAG GG-3′H19 ICR CTCF-binding site 3 reverse primer5′-AAG TTG GCA GCA TTT GGG C-3′TaqMan probe complementary to wild type H19 ICR5′-TAC CGC GCG GTG GCA GCA TAC TCC TAA AT-3′TaqMan probe complementary to 142* H19 ICR5′-CGG ATG CTA CCG CGC GAT ATC AGC ATA CT-3′Xist forward primer5′-GTC GCC AAC CTA ATG CAG AAG-3′Xist reverse primer5′-AAA CGA GCA AAC ATG GCT GG-3′ Open table in a new tab HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with TGFβ/Smad-responsive promoter-reporter pCAGA12-MLP-luc and p800-PAI-1-luc constructs in the presence of mock (pCDNA3) or pCDNA3-FLAG-CTCF plasmids for 24 h prior to stimulation with TGFβ1 for another 16 h. pCMV-galactosidase was co-transfected as control for normalization.

The primers used for PCR amplification were: human PAI-1, sense, 5′-GAGACAGGCAGCTCGGATTC-3′, and antisense, 5′-GGCCTCCCAAAGTGCATTAC-3′; human GAPDH, sense, 5′-GGAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGTA-3′, and antisense, 5′-GGCAACAATATCCACTTTACCA-3′; human SMAD7, sense, 5′-ACCCGATGGATTTTCTCAAACC-3′, and antisense, 5′-GCCAGATAATTCGTTCCCCCT-3′; mouse Snail1, sense, 5′-CCACTGCAACCGTGCTTTT-3′, and antisense, 5′-CACATCCGAGTGGGTTTGG-3′; mouse Pai-1, sense, 5′-GGCAGATCCAAGATGCTATGG-3′, and antisense, 5′-TCATTCTTGTTCCACGGCC-3′; and mouse Gapdh, sense, 5′-TGTGTCCGTCGTGGATCTGA-3′, and antisense, 5′-CCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTGA-3′. The levels of H19 and Igf2 mRNA were analyzed using TaqMan gene expression probes Mm00469706_g1 (H19) and Mm00439565_g1 (Igf2) purchased from Applied Biosystems and performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations using MEF 142* × SD7 and SD7 × 142* mRNA. The 4-h stimulated samples were then further studied for allele-specific expression of H19 and Igf2 as described previously (15Pant V. Mariano P. Kanduri C. Mattsson A. Lobanenkov V. Heuchel R. Ohlsson R. Genes. Dev. 2003; 17: 586-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and visualized using the Bioanalyzer 5100 from Agilent. In more detail, diagnostic BglII restriction digestions of the amplified cDNA take advantage of a mouse strain-specific polymorphism on the H19 transcribed sequence. BglII digestion of H19 cDNA encoded by the chromosome carrying the mutations (mut) on the CTCF-binding sites (M. musculus domesticus strain) is expected to give rise to a single 521-bp DNA fragment, whereas cDNA encoded from the chromosome carrying the wild type CTCF-binding sites (M. musculus spretus strain) is expected to give rise to two DNA fragments of 384 and 137 bp. BsaAI digestion of Igf2 cDNA encoded by the chromosome carrying the mutations (mut) on the CTCF-binding sites (M. musculus domesticus strain) is expected to give rise to a single 602-bp DNA fragment, whereas cDNA encoded from the chromosome carrying the wild type CTCF-binding sites (M. musculus spretus strain) is expected to give rise to two DNA fragments of 473 and 129 bp. A previous report suggested the possibility that Smad proteins might form physical complexes with CTCF on the β-amyloid gene enhancer (23Burton T. Liang B. Dibrov A. Amara F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 713-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We tested the generality of this hypothesis by expressing CTCF and the three Smads of the TGFβ pathway (Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4) in human embryonic kidney cells and performing co-immunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 1A). A sustained TGFβ stimulus was provided to the cells by co-transfecting a constitutively active form of the TGFβ type I receptor (ALK5T204D). CTCF co-precipitated with Smad3, but not with Smad2 or Smad4, even in the absence of receptor activation, and such activation weakly enhanced the CTCF-Smad complex. These data were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assays of endogenous CTCF and Smad3 in human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells (Fig. 1B) and in embryonic kidney cells (data not shown). We could also detect the endogenous CTCF-Smad3 complex in these cells even in the absence of stimulation with TGFβ (Fig. 1B). Because CTCF is integrated into the chromatin, these results suggest that a certain pool of Smad3 always exists in the nucleus and is capable of making contacts with factors that are tightly bound to DNA, such as CTCF. Using a panel of GST fusions to the CTCF domains, we found that Smad3 preferentially interacts with the central CTCF zinc finger domain (Fig. 1C). Further GST pulldown assays confirmed the specificity of interaction between CTCF and Smad3 (Fig. 2A), and use of recombinant proteins confirmed that CTCF interacts directly with Smad3 but not with Smad2 or Smad4 (Fig. 2B). Incubation with both recombinant Smad3 and Smad4 led to a significantly stronger complex with CTCF (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the presence of Smad4 stabilizes or enhances formation of this ternary protein complex. GST pulldown assays with two deletion mutants of Smad3 indicated that CTCF interacts with the N-terminal conserved domain of Smad3 (Fig. 3A), known as Mad homology 1 (MH1 domain; Fig. 1D), which binds to specific DNA sequences and also carries the Smad nuclear localization signal (11Wu M.Y. Hill C.S. Dev. Cell. 2009; 16: 329-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar).FIGURE 3CTCF interacts with the MH1 domain of Smad3, and exon 3 in Smad2 prohibits this interaction. Shown are GST pulldown assays of in vitro translated, [35S]methionine/cysteine-labeled FLAG-CTCF with the indicated GST-Smad3 deletion mutants (A) and GST-Smad2/Smad3 swapping mutants (B). The conditions and presentation are exactly as described for Fig. 2B. In B, M indicates the molecular size marker lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The MH1 domains of Smad2 and Smad3 are structurally identical except for the presence of two short amino acid sequence inserts, one named GAG and the second named TID, in Smad2 (Fig. 1D) (24Dennler S. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The TID insert corresponds to exon 3 of Smad2, which can be alternatively spliced, thus forming a natural Smad2 variant that highly resembles Smad3. The presence of the TID insert (exon 3) explains why full-length Smad2 fails to bind to DNA or to the importins that import Smad3 into the nucleus (18Kurisaki A. Kose S. Yoneda Y. Heldin C.H. Moustakas A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 24Dennler S. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the Smad2-specific GAG and/or TID peptide sequences might interfere with its interaction with CTCF. To test this hypothesis we repeated the GST pulldown assays with a new panel of Smad2/Smad3 MH1 domain swapping mutants (Fig. 3B). Engineering peptide insert TID into the sequence of wild type Smad3 abolished the interaction with CTCF (Fig. 3B). Conversely, deleting only peptide insert TID from Smad2 made this protein capable of binding to CTCF, whereas the presence or absence of the N-terminal peptide insert GAG had no effect (Fig. 3B). Thus, CTCF can specifically form complexes with Smad3 or an alternatively spliced form of Smad2 that lacks exon3. The specificity of interaction between the CTCF zinc finger domain and the Smad3 MH1/DNA-binding domain suggested that CTCF might regulate the function of Smad3 during TGFβ signaling. A classic target of TGFβ/Smad3 signaling is the PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor 1) gene (25Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). DNA affinity precipitation experiments showed that phosphorylated Smad3 could be readily detected bound to a SBE DNA sequence derived from the PAI-1 enhancer; co-expression of CTCF did not perturb such binding to DNA (Fig. 4A). Transcriptional reporter assays using the same PAI-1 enhancer SBE element fused to the luciferase cDNA, which is established as a potent Smad3-dependent reporter (25Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar), failed to show any significant impact of CTCF overexpression on the responsiveness of this promoter to TGFβ (Fig. 4B). A longer, 800-bp enhancer-promoter fragment of PAI-1 fused to luciferase also confers strong responsiveness to TGFβ. However, co-expression of CTCF did not significantly change this response (Fig. 4C), in agreement with the DNA binding data of Fig. 4A. At the endogenous level, potent knockdown of CTCF (Fig. 5A) in the mouse mammary epithelial NMuMG cell line exhibited weak enhancement of the expression of the mouse Pai-1 gene and no measurable effects at all on Snail expression, as revealed by real time Q-PCR (Fig. 5B). Similar results were gathered from a well established human cell model for TGFβ/Smad responses, human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells, where efficient knockdown of endogenous CTCF (Fig. 5C) weakly enhanced expression of human PAI-1 and did not at all perturb the expression pattern of the SMAD7 gene (Fig. 5D). These results suggested that the functional importance of the Smad3-CTCF interaction may involve cellular processes other than mainstream Smad3-dependent gene responses. However, it is also possible that CTCF might exert a weak repressive effect on a subset of TGFβ-responsive genes, such as PAI-1. Given the strong link between CTCF and the epigenetics of imprinted chromatin domains, we hypothesized that Smads might get recruited to CTCF-bound imprinted loci based on their ability to interact with CTCF. To this end, we performed Q-PCR analysis after ChIP in the mouse mammary epithelial cell system described above (Fig. 6). The ChIP-Q-PCR analysis showed that CTCF, as established before (26Chao W.

https://openalex.org/W2091925127,"<i>N</i>-Methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are expressed at excitatory synapses throughout the brain and are essential for neuronal development and synaptic plasticity. Functional NMDA receptors are tetramers, typically composed of NR1 and NR2 subunits (NR2A–D). NR2A and NR2B are expressed in the forebrain and are thought to assemble as diheteromers (NR1/NR2A, NR1/NR2B) and triheteromers (NR1/NR2A/NR2B). NR2A and NR2B contain cytosolic domains that regulate distinct postendocytic sorting events, with NR2A sorting predominantly into the degradation pathway, and NR2B preferentially trafficking through the recycling pathway. However, the interplay between these two subunits remains an open question. We have now developed a novel approach based on the dimeric feature of the α- and β-chains of the human major histocompatibility complex class II molecule. We created chimeras of α- and β-chains with the NR2A and NR2B C termini and evaluated endocytosis of dimers. Like chimeric proteins containing only a single NR2A or NR2B C-terminal domain, major histocompatibility complex class II-NR2A homodimers sort predominantly to late endosomes, whereas NR2B homodimers traffic to recycling endosomes. Interestingly, NR2A/NR2B heterodimers traffic preferentially through the recycling pathway, and NR2B is dominant in regulating dimer trafficking in both heterologous cells and neurons. In addition, the recycling of NR2B-containing NMDARs in wild-type neurons is not significantly different from NR2A<sup>−/−</sup> neurons. These data support a dominant role for NR2B in regulating the trafficking of triheteromeric NMDARs <i>in vivo</i>. Furthermore, our molecular approach allows for the direct and selective evaluation of dimeric assemblies and can be used to define dominant trafficking domains in other multisubunit protein complexes."

The present study explored whether the ET1-receptor ETB influences suicidal erythrocyte death. To this end, [Ca(2+)](i) (Fluo3-fluorescence) and phosphatidylserine exposure (annexin V-binding) were determined utilizing FACS analysis. Energy depletion increased [Ca(2+)](i) and phosphatidylserine-exposure, effects significantly blunted by ET1 (IC(50) approximately 100 nM) and the ETB receptor-agonist sarafotoxin 6c (IC(50) approximately 10 nM) but not by ET2 and ET3. ET1 and sarafotoxin significantly delayed the kinetics of suicidal erythrocyte death following energy depletion. ETB stimulation did not blunt the effect of Ca(2+)-ionophore ionomycin (1 microM) on phosphatidylserine exposure. The in vivo significance was tested using rescued ETB-knockout (etb(-/-)) and wild-type (etb(+/+)) mice. The number of phosphatidylserine-exposing erythrocytes, of reticulocytes and spleen size were significantly larger in etb(-/-) mice than in etb(+/+)-mice. The etb(-/-) erythrocytes were more susceptible to the eryptotic effect of oxidative stress and more rapidly cleared from circulating blood than etb(+/+) erythrocytes. Finally, the spleens from etb(-/-) mice were enlarged and contained markedly more phosphatidylserine-exposing erythrocytes than spleens from etb(+/+) mice. The observations disclose a novel function of ET1, i.e., protection from suicidal erythrocyte death."
https://openalex.org/W1997166517,"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a key role in immune system homeostasis and tolerance to antigens, thereby preventing autoimmunity, and may be partly responsible for the lack of an appropriate immune response against tumor cells. Although not sufficient, a high expression of forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) is necessary for their suppressive function. Recent reports have shown that histones deacetylase inhibitors increased FOXP3 expression in T cells. We therefore decided to investigate in non-Tregs CD4-positive cells, the mechanisms by which an aspecific opening of the chromatin could lead to an increased FOXP3 expression. We focused on binding of potentially activating transcription factors to the promoter region of FOXP3 and on modifications in the five miRs constituting the Tregs signature. Valproate treatment induced binding of Ets-1 and Ets-2 to the FOXP3 promoter and acted positively on its expression, by increasing the acetylation of histone H4 lysines. Valproate treatment also induced the acquisition of the miRs Tregs signature. To elucidate whether the changes in the miRs expression could be due to the increased FOXP3 expression, we transduced these non-Tregs with a FOXP3 lentiviral expression vector, and found no changes in miRs expression. Therefore, the modification in their miRs expression profile is not due to an increased expression of FOXP3 but directly results from histones deacetylase inhibition. Rather, the increased FOXP3 expression results from the additive effects of Ets factors binding and the change in expression level of miR-21 and miR-31. We conclude that valproate treatment of human non-Tregs confers on them a molecular profile similar to that of their regulatory counterpart."
https://openalex.org/W2068487912,"Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), a key enzyme of gluconeogenesis and photosynthetic CO(2) fixation, catalyzes the hydrolysis of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) to produce fructose 6-phosphate, an important precursor in various biosynthetic pathways. All known FBPases are metal-dependent enzymes, which are classified into five different classes based on their amino acid sequences. Eukaryotes are known to contain only the type-I FBPases, whereas all five types exist in various combinations in prokaryotes. Here we demonstrate that the uncharacterized protein YK23 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae efficiently hydrolyzes FBP in a metal-independent reaction. YK23 is a member of the histidine phosphatase (phosphoglyceromutase) superfamily with homologues found in all organisms. The crystal structure of the YK23 apo-form was solved at 1.75-A resolution and revealed the core domain with the alpha/beta/alpha-fold covered by two small cap domains. Two liganded structures of this protein show the presence of two phosphate molecules (an inhibitor) or FBP (a substrate) bound to the active site. FBP is bound in its linear, open conformation with the cleavable C1-phosphate positioned deep in the active site. Alanine replacement mutagenesis of YK23 identified six conserved residues absolutely required for activity and suggested that His(13) and Glu(99) are the primary catalytic residues. Thus, YK23 represents the first family of metal-independent FBPases and a second FBPase family in eukaryotes."

In this study we discovered that an α-crystallin type small heat-shock protein (α-Hsp), HspL, is a molecular chaperone for VirB8, a T4SS assembly factor. HspL is a typical α-Hsp capable of protecting the heat-labile model substrate citrate synthase from thermal aggregation. It forms oligomers in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro. Biochemical fractionation revealed that HspL is mainly localized in the inner membrane and formed large complexes with certain VirB protein subassemblies. Protein-protein interaction studies indicated that HspL interacts with VirB8, a bitopic integral inner membrane protein that is essential for T4SS assembly. Most importantly, HspL is able to prevent the aggregation of VirB8 fused with glutathione S-transferase in vitro, suggesting that it plays a role as VirB8 chaperone. The chaperone activity of two HspL variants with amino acid substitutions (F98A and G118A) for both citrate synthase and glutathione S-transferase-VirB8 was reduced and correlated with HspL functions in T4SS-mediated DNA transfer and virulence. This study directly links in vitro and in vivo functions of an α-Hsp and reveals a novel α-Hsp function in T4SS stability and bacterial virulence."

Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 117-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). One of these, Cav3.2, is coded for by the CACNA1H gene and is distinctive in its sensitivity to Ni2+ (12Lee J.H. Gomora J.C. Cribbs L.L. Perez-Reyes E. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 3034-3042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The T-type Ca2+ channel in bovine AZF cells is blocked by Ni2+ with an IC50 of 20 μm, characteristic of Cav3.2 (1Mlinar B. Biagi B.A. Enyeart J.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 217-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In whole cell patch clamp recordings, ACTH has no rapid effect on the activity of pre-existing Cav3.2 channels (supplemental Fig. S1). It is not known whether ACTH exerts long term control over CACNA1H gene expression in these cells.The signaling mechanisms by which ACTH produces rapid and delayed effects in the adrenal cortex are complex. Early studies identified cAMP as the principal intracellular messenger for ACTH in AZF cells (13Haynes Jr., R.C. Berthet L. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 225: 115-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Grahame-Smith D.G. Butcher R.W. Ney R.L. Sutherland E.W. J. Biol.

Accordingly, bovine AZF cells express a high affinity MC2R melanocortin receptor coupled to adenylate cyclase through Gs (17Penhoat A. Jaillard C. Saez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 4978-4981Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 18Raikhinstein M. Zohar M. Hanukoglu I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1220: 329-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Until recently, nearly all of the actions of cAMP in eukaryotic cells were believed to be mediated through the activation of PKA. However, two cAMP-activated guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Epac1 and Epac2 also known as cAMP-GEFI and cAMP-GEFII) that activate Rap1 and Rap2 GTPases have been identified (19de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar, 20Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). Epac proteins regulate a variety of cellular processes by mechanisms that, in some cases, include regulation of gene expression (21Borland G. Smith B.O. Yarwood S.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2009; 158: 70-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 22Bos J.L. Trends Biochem.

Physiol. 2006; 577: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Although Epac1 is widely expressed, Epac2 is robustly expressed mainly in selected areas of the brain and the adrenal glands of rats and humans (19de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar, 20Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E.

Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar).Elucidating the signaling pathways by which ACTH and cAMP function in the adrenal cortex has been facilitated by the discovery of cAMP derivatives that, at appropriate concentrations, selectively activate Epacs or PKA (24Enserink J.M. Christensen A.E. de Rooij J. van Triest M. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Døskeland S.O. Blank J.L. Bos J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 25Holz G.G.

Chem. 2003; 278: 38548-38556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These derivatives have been used to independently study the role of these cAMP-activated proteins in the regulation of cell function. In this regard, we previously found that cAMP inhibits the activity of bTREK-1 K+ channels by a mechanism that is independent of PKA but mimicked by Epac-specific cAMP analogs (ESCAs) (27Enyeart J.J. Mlinar B. Enyeart J.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 28Liu H. Enyeart J.A. Enyeart J.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2008; 132: 279-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Recently, we discovered that the most widely used ESCA 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-2′-O-methyl-cAMP (8CPT-2′-OMe-cAMP), after a delay of many hours, stimulated large increases in the expression of steroid hydroxylase mRNAs and cortisol synthesis by a cAMP-, PKA-, and Epac-independent mechanism. These effects were mediated by one or more metabolites of the parent compound through an unknown signaling pathway (29Enyeart J.A. Enyeart J.J. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e6088Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).In addition to its cAMP-dependent actions, ACTH produces effects in AZF cells by mechanisms that may be completely independent of cAMP. At concentrations that produce little or no measurable increase in cAMP synthesis, ACTH and its O-nitrophenyl,sulfenyl derivative NPS-ACTH stimulate large increases in corticosteroid secretion by rat and bovine cells (30Moyle W.R. Kong Y.C. Ramachandran J. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2409-2417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Yamazaki T. Kimoto T. Higuchi K. Ohta Y. Kawato S. Kominami S. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4765-4771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Currently, few reports exist describing the signaling mechanisms that regulate T-type Ca2+ channel expression in specific cells. Two patch clamp studies on rat adrenal chromaffin and AZF cells have provided seemingly contradictory results. In chromaffin cells, it was reported that exposing cells for 3–5 days to 8CPT-cAMP or the ESCA 8CPT-2′-OMe-cAMP enhanced the expression of a Ni2+-sensitive T-type Ca2+ current through activation of Epac proteins (32Novara M. Baldelli P. Cavallari D. Carabelli V. Giancippoli A. Carbone E. J. Physiol. 2004; 558: 433-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In contrast, in rat AZF cells, it was reported that prolonged treatment with a different 8-substituted cAMP analog, the PKA and Epac activator 8-Br-cAMP, or forskolin failed to enhance the expression of the T-type Ca2+ current (33Barbara J.G. Takeda K. J. Physiol. 1995; 488: 609-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Neither of these studies measured the effect of these specific cAMP analogs on CACNA1H mRNA.In this study, we examined the regulation of CACNA1H mRNA and corresponding Cav3.2 Ca2+ currents in AZF cells by ACTH, cAMP analogs, and their metabolites using Northern blot and patch clamp techniques. It was discovered that ACTH and metabolites of chlorophenylthio-cAMP analogs induce the expression of CACNA1H mRNA and Ca2+ current. In contrast, other cAMP analogs enhanced the expression of CACNA1H mRNA but not the associated current.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDMEM/F12, antibiotics, and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Invitrogen.

Isolated AZF cells were obtained and prepared as previously described (34Enyeart J.J. Gomora J.C. Xu L. Enyeart J.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). After isolation, the cells either were resuspended in DMEM/F12 (1:1) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and the antioxidants 1 μm tocopherol, 20 nm selenite and 100 μm ascorbic acid (DMEM/F12+) and plated for immediate use or were resuspended in fetal bovine serum, 5% Me2SO, divided into 1-ml aliquots, and stored in liquid nitrogen for future use. To ensure cell attachment, the dishes were treated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C and then rinsed with warm, sterile phosphate-buffered saline immediately before adding cells.

At the end of the incubation period, total RNA was extracted using RNeasy columns (Qiagen), electrophoresed on a denaturing gel, and transferred to a nylon transfer membrane (GeneScreen Plus; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The probes were generated by reverse transcription-PCR using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI), specific primers for bovine CACNA1H, and total RNA isolated from bovine AZF cells as described above. CACNA1H primers (GGGGAGAGCCTGGCGGGAAGA and GGGTCTCCTGAGGGCACTGTGGACT) were selected from GenBankTM accession number XM_581124.4 (Predicted: Bos taurus calcium channel, voltage-dependent, T-type, α1H subunit (CACNA1H)) mRNA. This ∼800-bp probe is specific for bovine CACNA1H mRNA and has low homology to either CACNA1G or CACNA1I. The CACNA1H probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random primer labeling (Prime-It II; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Northern autoradiograms were imaged using a Typhoon 9200 variable mode imager and quantitated using ImageQuant TL v2003.3 software (GE Healthcare). The mRNA values are presented as the means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments normalized to densitometric values for the corresponding 18 S rRNA bands.Ca2+ Current RecordingPatch clamp recordings of voltage-gated Ca2+ currents from bovine AZF cells were made in the whole cell configuration as previously described (1Mlinar B. Biagi B.A. Enyeart J.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 217-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The standard pipette solution was 120 mm CsCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 11 mm 1,2,-bis(2-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 10 mm HEPES, and 1 mm MgATP with pH titrated to 7.2 with CsOH. The external solution consisted of 117 mm tetra-ethylammonium chloride, 5 mm CsCl, 20 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, and 5 mm glucose, with pH adjusted to 7.4 with tetraethylammonium hydroxide. All of the solutions were filtered through 0.22-μm cellulose acetate filters.Recording Conditions and ElectronicsAZF cells were used for patch clamp experiments 24–144 h after plating. Typically, cells with diameters of <15 μm and capacitances of 10–15 pF were selected. Coverslips upon which cells were plated (Bellco, Vineland NJ) were transferred from 35-mm culture dishes to a recording chamber (volume, 1.5 ml) that was continuously perfused by gravity at a rate of 3–5 ml/min. For whole cell recordings, patch electrodes with resistances of 1.0–2.0 MΩ were fabricated from Corning 0010 glass (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). These electrodes routinely yielded access resistances of 1.5–4.0 MΩ and voltage-clamp time constants of <100 μs. Ca2+ currents were recorded at room temperature (22–25 °C) according to the procedure of Hamill et al. (35Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15091) Google Scholar) using a List EPC-7 patch clamp amplifier. Pulse generation and data acquisition were done using a personal computer and PCLAMP software with Digidata 1200 interface (Axon Instruments, Inc., Burlingame, CA). The currents were digitized at 2–10 KHz after filtering with an 8-pole Bessel filter (Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA). Linear leak and capacity currents were subtracted from current records using summed scaled hyperpolarizing steps of ¼ pulse amplitude. The data were analyzed using PCLAMP (CLAMPFIT 9.2) and SigmaPlot (version 11.0) software. For selected experiments (supplemental Fig. S1), ACTH (200 pm) was applied by bath perfusion, controlled manually by a six-way rotary valve.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have reported several novel findings regarding the physiological mechanisms that regulate Cav3.2 expression in bovine AZF cells. First, ACTH induces the expression of CACNA1H mRNA and Ca2+ current through mechanisms that are, at most, only partially dependent on cAMP. cAMP analogs that activate PKA and Epac, as well as those that activate only PKA, increase the expression of CACNA1H mRNA, but not the associated Ca2+ current. Epac activation alone is not sufficient to induce the expression of either mRNA or current. Chlorophenylthio-cAMP analogs potently induce the expression of CACNA1H mRNA and ionic current after conversion to one or more active metabolites. It is possible that ACTH and the cAMP metabolites stimulate the expression of CACNA1H mRNA and current through a common cAMP-independent mechanism.ACTH and Cav3.2 ExpressionACTH reversed the spontaneous time-dependent decrease in Cav3.2 current typically observed in cultured bovine AZF cells and induced a delayed increase in expression of functional channels that lasted for at least 6 days. With respect to temporal pattern, maximum increases in Cav3.2 current were similar to those observed for ACTH-induced increases in steroid hydroxylase proteins and bTREK-1 current in these same cells (6Simpson E.R.

https://openalex.org/W2072717981,"Class 1 cytokines bind two receptors to create an active heterotrimeric complex. It has been argued that ligand binding to their receptors is an ordered process, but a structural mechanism describing this process has not been determined. We have previously described an obligate ordered binding mechanism for the human prolactin/prolactin receptor heterotrimeric complex. In this work we expand this conceptual understanding of ordered binding to include three human lactogenic hormones: prolactin, growth hormone, and placental lactogen. We independently blocked either of the two receptor binding sites of each hormone and used surface plasmon resonance to measure human prolactin receptor binding kinetics and stoichiometries to the remaining binding surface. When site 1 of any of the three hormones was blocked, site 2 could not bind the receptor. But blocking site 2 did not affect receptor binding at site 1, indicating a requirement for receptor binding to site 1 before site 2 binding. In addition we noted variable responses to the presence of zinc in hormone-receptor interaction. Finally, we performed Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) analyses where receptor binding at subsaturating stoichiometries induced changes in FRET signaling, indicative of binding-induced changes in hormone conformation, whereas at receptor:hormone ratios in excess of 2:1 no additional changes in FRET signaling were observed. These results strongly support a conformationally mediated obligate-ordered receptor binding for each of the three lactogenic hormones."
https://openalex.org/W1976594621,"Salla disease and infantile sialic acid storage disorder are human diseases caused by loss of function of sialin, a lysosomal transporter that mediates H(+)-coupled symport of acidic sugars N-acetylneuraminic acid and glucuronic acid out of lysosomes. Along with the closely related vesicular glutamate transporters, sialin belongs to the SLC17 transporter family. Despite their critical role in health and disease, these proteins remain poorly understood both structurally and mechanistically. Here, we use substituted cysteine accessibility screening and radiotracer flux assays to evaluate experimentally a computationally generated three-dimensional structure model of sialin. According to this model, sialin consists of 12 transmembrane helices (TMs) with an overall architecture similar to that of the distantly related glycerol 3-phosphate transporter GlpT. We show that TM4 in sialin lines a large aqueous cavity that forms a part of the substrate permeation pathway and demonstrate substrate-induced alterations in accessibility of substituted cysteine residues in TM4. In addition, we demonstrate that one mutant, F179C, has a dramatically different effect on the apparent affinity and transport rate for N-acetylneuraminic acid and glucuronic acid, suggesting that it may be directly involved in substrate recognition and/or translocation. These findings offer a basis for further defining the transport mechanism of sialin and other SLC17 family members."
https://openalex.org/W2078038447,"A hallmark of prion diseases is the conversion of the host-encoded prion protein (PrPC where C is cellular) into an alternatively folded, disease-related isoform (PrPSc, where Sc is scrapie), the accumulation of which is associated with synapse degeneration and ultimately neuronal death. The formation of PrPSc is dependent upon the presence of PrPC in specific, cholesterol-sensitive membrane microdomains, commonly called lipid rafts. PrPC is targeted to these lipid rafts because it is attached to membranes via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. Here, we show that treatment of prion-infected neuronal cell lines (ScN2a, ScGT1, or SMB cells) with synthetic glycosylphosphatidylinositol analogues, glucosamine-phosphatidylinositol (glucosamine-PI) or glucosamine 2-O-methyl inositol octadecyl phosphate, reduced the PrPSc content of these cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, ScGT1 cells treated with glucosamine-PI did not transmit infection following intracerebral injection to mice. Treatment with glucosamine-PI increased the cholesterol content of ScGT1 cell membranes and reduced activation of cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 (PLA2), consistent with the hypothesis that the composition of cell membranes affects key PLA2-dependent signaling pathways involved in PrPSc formation. The effect of glucosamine-PI on PrPSc formation was also reversed by the addition of platelet-activating factor. Glucosamine-PI caused the displacement of PrPC from lipid rafts and reduced expression of PrPC at the cell surface, putative sites for PrPSc formation. We propose that treatment with glucosamine-PI modifies local micro-environments that control PrPC expression and activation of PLA2 and subsequently inhibits PrPSc formation.

PrPSc represents the major component of infectious scrapie prions. The conversion of PrPC to PrPSc is accompanied by changes in biological and biochemical properties, including reduced solubility and an increased resistance to proteases (3.Prusiner S.B.

More specifically, the formation of PrPSc in neuronal cell lines was dependent on the specific intracellular trafficking pathways of PrPC (8.Gilch S. Winklhofer K.F. Groschup M.H. Nunziante M.

One of the factors that determines the intracellular trafficking of PrPC is the localization of PrPC at the cell surface within detergent-resistant membrane microdomains, commonly called lipid rafts (10.Pike L.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Cholesterol synthesis inhibitors affect the formation of lipid rafts required for PrPSc formation (11.Taraboulos A.

Bull. 2007; 30: 835-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, many neuronal processes are sensitive to changes in membrane cholesterol, and cholesterol synthesis inhibitors are regarded as crude pharmacological tools. Because lipid rafts exist as heterogeneous subsets (10.Pike L.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar), we examined the potential of compounds to alter specific lipid raft subsets involved in PrPSc formation. The majority of PrPC molecules are linked to membranes via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (14.Stahl N. Borchelt D.R. Hsiao K. Prusiner S.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 229-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar), which targets proteins to lipid rafts (15.Major S. Reizman H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Replacing the GPI anchor attached to PrPC with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the CD4 molecule reduced PrPSc formation in vitro (11.Taraboulos A. Scott M. Semenov A. Avrahami D. Laszlo L. Prusiner S.B. Avraham D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) suggesting that the GPI anchor attached to PrPC might affect PrPSc formation. In other studies, transgenic mice producing PrPC without a GPI anchor produced high amounts of infectious PrPSc in the absence of clinical scrapie (16.Chesebro B. Trifilo M. Race R. Meade-White K. Teng C. LaCasse R. Raymond L. Favara C. Baron G. Priola S. Caughey B. Masliah E. Oldstone M. Science. 2005; 308: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). However, the loss of the GPI anchor affected both the glycosylation of PrPC and its expression at the cell surface (16.Chesebro B. Trifilo M. Race R. Meade-White K. Teng C. LaCasse R. Raymond L. Favara C. Baron G. Priola S. Caughey B. Masliah E. Oldstone M. Science. 2005; 308: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Because these factors can affect PrPSc production (17.Tuzi N.L. Cancellotti E. Baybutt H. Blackford L. Bradford B. Plinston C. Coghill A. Hart P. Piccardo P. Barron R.M. Manson J.C. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e100Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), it is not clear whether the effects of removing the entire GPI anchor in these mice was a direct effect of the loss of the GPI anchor or an indirect effect resulting from altered glycosylation. Such observations indicate that the full role of the GPI anchor in PrPSc formation is not fully understood. The basic structure of GPI anchors contains a conserved core consisting of ethanolamine phosphate in an amide linkage to the carboxyl terminus of the protein, three mannose residues, and glucosamine linked to phosphatidylinositol (PI) (15.Major S. Reizman H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 18.Ikezawa H. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2002; 25: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Many variations on this core structure have been found, and the GPI attached to PrPC has been reported to contain high amounts of sialic acid, galactose, and mannose (19.Stahl N. Baldwin M.A. Hecker R. Pan K.M. Burlingame A.L. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5043-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) as illustrated in Fig. 1. Some GPI anchors are more than a simple mechanism of attaching proteins to the cell membranes and have cell signaling functions. For example, GPIs from the protozoan Plasmodium falciparum stimulate macrophages (20.Vijaykumar M. Naik R.S. Gowda D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6909-6912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), whereas other GPIs stimulate lipogenesis in adipocytes (21.Frick W. Bauer A. Bauer J. Wied S. Müller G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13421-13436Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and GPIs isolated from PrPC stimulate phospholipase A2 (PLA2) (22.Bate C. Williams A. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Because PLA2 affected the formation of prions (23.Bate C. Reid S. Williams A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36405-36411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we used synthetic GPI analogues to examine the relationship between GPI anchors, lipid rafts, cell activation, and prion formation. We report that two synthetic GPI anchor analogues altered the composition of cell membranes in three prion-infected neuronal cell lines, reduced cell signaling and the formation of PrPSc, and greatly diminished infectivity of ScGT1 cells. Prion-infected ScN2a, ScGT1, and SMB cells and their uninfected controls (N2a, GT1, or SMB-PS cells) were grown in Ham's F-12 medium containing 2 mm glutamine, 2% fetal calf serum, and standard antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). To determine the effect of compounds on PrPSc formation, ScN2a, SMB, or ScGT1 cells were plated in 6-well plates (105 cells/well) and cultured in the presence or absence of test compounds. Cells were grown with daily changes of media, and the amount of cell-associated PrPSc was evaluated after 7 days. Cells were washed twice in PBS before cell extracts were obtained. Spent medium was collected to see if PrPSc was released into the culture supernatant. These were concentrated by centrifugation with a 10-kDa filter and diluted to an equivalent of 106 cells/ml. Primary cortical neurons were prepared from the brains of mouse embryos (day 15.5) after mechanical dissociation and cell sieving. Neuronal precursors were plated (500,000 cells/well in 24-well plates coated with 5 μg/ml poly-l-lysine) in Ham's F-12 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum for 2 h. Cultures were shaken (600 rpm for 5 min), and nonadherent cells were removed by two washes in PBS. Neurons were grown in neurobasal medium containing B27 components (PAA) for 7 days and subsequently incubated with test compounds. Immunolabeling studies showed that after 7 days cultures contained less than 5% glial cells (about 3% glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive and less than 1% MAC-1-positive cells). To determine the short term effects of GPI anchor analogues, cells were plated in 6-well plates (106 cells/well) and allowed to adhere overnight. The following day, cells were washed and incubated for 24 h in the presence or absence of different concentrations of test compounds as shown. Cells were subsequently washed five times with warm PBS before further use. At the end of treatment, cells were homogenized in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS at 106 cells/ml, and nuclei and large fragments were removed by centrifugation (300 × g for 5 min). Mixed protease inhibitors (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, aprotinin, leupeptin, bestatin, pepstatin A, and E-46 (Sigma)) and a phosphatase inhibitor mixture, including PP1, PP2A, microcystin LR, cantharidin, and p-bromotetramisole (Sigma), were added to some cell extracts. To determine the amount of PrPSc in cell extracts, they were digested with 1 μg/ml proteinase K (1 h at 37 °C) to remove PrPC. Digestion of noninfected GT1 cell extracts with proteinase K (as above) completely reduced the PrP signal, i.e. complete digestion of PrPC. The soluble material split into two samples, one of which was heated to 95 °C for 5 min and tested in a PrP-specific ELISA (see below). The other sample was mixed 1:1 with Laemmli buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min. This fraction was run on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred onto a Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by semi-dry blotting. Membranes were blocked using 10% milk powder, and PrP was detected by incubation with a mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) ICSM18 (d-Gen), followed by biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Dako) and ExtrAvidin-peroxidase (Sigma). Detection of bound antibody was by the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). Nondigested samples were boiled in Laemmli buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol for 5 min and run on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred onto a Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by semi-dry blotting. Membranes were blocked using 10% milk powder, and β-actin was detected by incubation with a mouse mAb (clone AC-74, Sigma), followed by biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse IgG and ExtrAvidin-peroxidase. Detection of bound antibody was by the enhanced chemiluminescence kit. To differentiate between the normal membrane and lipid rafts, cells were homogenized in an ice-cold buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, and mixed protease inhibitors at 106 cells/ml (as above), and nuclei and large fragments were removed by centrifugation (300 × g for 5 min at 4 °C). The subsequent postnuclear supernatant was incubated on ice (4 °C) for 1 h and centrifuged (16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C). The supernatant was reserved as the normal cell membrane, whereas the insoluble pellet was homogenized in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS, and mixed protease inhibitors at an equivalent of 106 cells/ml and centrifuged (10 min at 16,000 × g), and the soluble material was reserved as DRMs/lipid rafts. Cells were harvested with a Teflon scraper and homogenized at 1 × 106 cells/ml in a buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and mixed protease inhibitors. Particulate membrane fragments and nuclei were removed by centrifugation (1000 × g for 5 min). Membranes were washed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and resuspended in an ice-cold buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA. 5–40% sucrose solutions were prepared and layered to produce a gradient. Solubilized membranes were layered on top and centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 18 h at 4 °C. Serial 1-ml aliquots were collected from the bottom of gradients. The amount of GM-1 ganglioside (GM-1) in whole cell extracts or detergent-resistant membranes cells was determined by incubating cells with 100 ng/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-cholera toxin subunit B (Sigma), 1 × 106 cells for 1 h. Cells were washed and cell extracts collected as above. Extracts were transferred into Sterlin 96-well black microplates, and fluorescence was measured using excitation at 495 nm and measuring emission at 521 nm. Values were expressed as a percentage of the amount of fluorescein isothiocyanate-cholera toxin subunit B added. The amount of PrP present in cell extracts was determined by ELISA using commercially available mAbs as described previously (24.Wadsworth J.D. Joiner S. Linehan J.M. Cooper S. Powell C. Mallinson G.

Nunc Maxisorb immunoplates were coated with 0.5 μg/ml mAb ICSM18, which recognizes amino acids 146–159 of PrP (25.White A.R. Enever P. Tayebi M. Mushens R. Linehan J. Brandner S. Anstee D. Collinge J. Hawke S. Nature. 2003; 422: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Samples were applied and detected with biotinylated mAb ICSM35 (d-Gen) (which recognizes an epitope between amino acids 91 and 110) (26.Beringue V. Mallinson G. Kaisar M. Tayebi M. Sattar Z. Jackson G. Anstee D. Collinge J. Hawke S. Brain. 2003; 126: 2065-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Biotinylated mAb was detected using ExtrAvidin-alkaline phosphatase and 1 mg/ml 4-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma). Absorbance was measured on a microplate reader at 405 nm, and the amount of PrP in cell extracts was calculated by reference to a standard curve of recombinant murine PrP (Prionics); its limit of detection was 0.05 ng/ml. The activation of cPLA2 is accompanied by phosphorylation of the 505 serine residues and measured by phospho-specific antibodies. The amount of activated cPLA2 in cell extracts was measured by ELISA as described previously (27.Bate C. Tayebi M. Williams A. BMC Biol. 2008; 6: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Nunc Maxisorb immunoplates were coated with 0.5 μg/ml mAb anti-cPLA2, clone CH-7 (Upstate), for 1 h and blocked with 10% fetal calf serum. Samples were incubated for 1 h, and the amount of activated cPLA2 was detected using a rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-cPLA2 (Cell Signaling Technology). Bound antibodies were detected with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG, ExtrAvidin-alkaline phosphatase, and 1 mg/ml 4-nitrophenyl phosphate. Absorbance was measured at 405 nm, and the amounts of activated cPLA2 were calculated from a standard curve using nonlinear regression. Samples were expressed as “units cPLA2,” where 100 units was defined as the amount of activated cPLA2 in 106 untreated cells. A standard curve was generated from this sample using sequential log 2 dilutions (range 100 to 1.56 units/well). The amounts of PrPC expressed at the cell surface were determined by treating cells with 0.2 unit of phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C for 1 h at 37 °C (106 cells/ml). PI-phospholipase C is cell-impermeable and acts on the GPI anchors that tether PrPC to the cell surface. The amount of PrPC released into culture supernatants following PI-phospholipase C digestion was measured by PrP ELISA. GPIs were isolated from GT1 neuronal cells solubilized in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. Nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation and the postnuclear supernatant incubated with antibodies to PrPC (ICSM18, d-Gen), Thy-1, or CD55 (Serotec). mAb-protein complexes were precipitated following the addition of protein G-agarose (Sigma). Precipitates were washed five times with PBS and digested with proteinase K (100 μg/ml at 37 °C for 24 h) resulting in GPI anchors attached to the terminal amino acid. The released GPIs were extracted with water-saturated butan-1-ol, washed with water five times, and lyophilized, and stock solutions were dissolved in ethanol at 2 μm. A preparation in which ICSM18 was incubated with recombinant PrP (lacking a GPI anchor) and treated as above was used as a control. Extracted GPIs were applied to Silica Gel 60 high performance TLC plates (Whatman) and developed using a mixture of chloroform/methanol/water (4:4:1, v/v). GPI anchors were detected by immunoblotting as described previously (22.Bate C. Williams A. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Plates were soaked in 0.1% poly(isobutyl methacrylate) in hexane, dried, and blocked with PBS containing 5% milk powder. They were probed with a mAb that binds to phosphatidylinositol, washed with PBS/Tween, and incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to peroxidase (Sigma) for 1 h. The bound antibody was washed and visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit. Cholesterol and protein content were determined in cell extracts (106 cells/ml). Protein concentrations were measured using a micro-BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The amount of cholesterol was measured using the Amplex Red cholesterol assay kit (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cholesterol was oxidized by cholesterol oxidase to yield hydrogen peroxide and ketones. The hydrogen peroxide reacts with 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine (Amplex Red reagent) to produce highly fluorescent resorufin, which is measured by excitation at 550 nm and emission detection at 590 nm. By performing the assay with and without cholesterol esterase, the assay can also determine the amount of esterified cholesterol within samples. Treated ScGT1 cells were detached and counted, washed twice with PBS, and then put through one rapid freeze-thaw cycle. The homogenate was precipitated by centrifugation (16,000 × g for 30 min), washed twice with PBS, and finally homogenized in sterile 0.9% (w/v) saline at 2.5 × 106 cell eq/ml. C57/Bl mice under halothane anesthesia were injected intracerebrally with 30 μl (7.5 × 104 cell eq) of this homogenate. Mice were monitored for clinical signs of scrapie until reaching a pre-defined clinical end point. All animal work was conducted according to local and national guidelines. The GPI analogues glucosamine 2-O-methyl inositol octadecyl phosphate and glucosamine-PI were supplied by Dr. A. Crossman, Dundee, Scotland, UK. PI, galactosamine, glucosamine, mannose, arachidonic acid, platelet-activating factor (PAF), carbamyl-PAF (C-PAF), lyso-PAF, lysophosphatidic acid, lyso-phosphatidylcholine, and lyso-phosphatidylethanolamine were obtained from Sigma. Comparison of treatment effects was carried out using one- and two-way analysis of variance techniques as appropriate. For all statistical tests, significance was set at the 1% level. The effect of GPI analogues on PrPSc formation was determined by daily treatment of ScGT1 cells with GPI-related compounds. After 7 days, the amount of PrPSc in proteinase K-digested cell extracts was determined by ELISA. Glucosamine-PI, glucosamine 2-O-methyl inositol octadecyl phosphate, and PI all caused a dose-dependent reduction in the amount of PrPSc these cells contained. The concentration of glucosamine-PI required to reduce PrPSc levels by 50% was 40 nm, and the same effect required 800 nm glucosamine 2-O-methyl inositol octadecyl phosphate (Fig. 2A). Treatment with 5 μm glucosamine-PI or glucosamine 2-O-methyl inositol octadecyl phosphate did not affect the survival of ScGT1 cells as measured by thiazyl blue tetrazolium (data not shown). Immunoblots were used to verify ELISA data; these showed that although the amount of PrPSc in glucosamine-PI treated cells was reduced, there were no significant differences in the amount of β-actin (Fig. 2B). ScGT1 cells treated for 7 days with 1 μm glucosamine-PI did not contain detectable levels of PrPSc, and these cells remained clear of PrPSc for a further 2 months after the cessation of treatment (data not shown). The PrPSc content of ScGT1 cells was not affected by glucosamine, galactose, or mannose. Moreover, the effect of 1 μm glucosamine-PI was not replicated by the combination of 1 μm glucosamine and 1 μm PI; PrPSc levels in these cells were not significantly different from that of vehicle-treated ScGT1 cells (10.6 ng/106 cells ± 1.2 (mean average ± S.D.) compared with 10.2 ± 0.8, n = 9, p = 0.7). The amounts of PrPSc in two other prion-infected cell lines (ScN2a and SMB cells) were also reduced following treatment with 1 μm glucosamine-PI or glucosamine 2-O-methyl inositol octadecyl phosphate, but not by treatment with 50 μm glucosamine, galactosamine, galactose, or mannose (Table 1). At the concentrations used, none of the compounds affected the viability or the growth rate of cell lines.TABLE 1GPI anchor analogues reduced the PrPSc content of ScN2a and SMB cellsTreatmentPrPSc (pg/106 cells)ScN2aSMBNone2128 ± 956057 ± 639Vehicle control2096 ± 1405988 ± 4581 μm glucosamine-PI<50aAmount of PrPSc is significantly less than that of vehicle-treated cells (p < 0.01).<50aAmount of PrPSc is significantly less than that of vehicle-treated cells (p < 0.01).1 μm glucosamine-O-methyl inositol octadecyl phosphate186 ± 120aAmount of PrPSc is significantly less than that of vehicle-treated cells (p < 0.01).748 ± 161aAmount of PrPSc is significantly less than that of vehicle-treated cells (p < 0.01).50 μm glucosamine2318 ± 925789 ± 63450 μm galactosamine1988 ± 2216255 ± 58950 μm galactose2090 ± 3206425 ± 66350 μm mannose2150 ± 3376271 ± 713a Amount of PrPSc is significantly less than that of vehicle-treated cells (p < 0.01).

To examine this possibility, the amount of PrPSc in the supernatants of treated ScGT1 cells was also measured. There were no significant differences in the amount of PrPSc in supernatants from cells treated with a vehicle control, galactosamine, glucosamine, galactose, or mannose.

None of the eight mice inoculated with homogenates from cells treated with glucosamine-PI had died by day 600 (Fig. 3). Such observations indicate that treatment with these GPI anchor analogues reduced infectivity as well as reducing PrPSc.

Hypoxia is a reduction in the normal level of tissue oxygen tension that occurs in many disease processes including cancer. It arises in solid tumors due to a mismatch between tumor growth and angiogenesis and is associated with an aggressive phenotype, resistance to radiation therapy and chemotherapy, as well as poor patient prognosis (1Brahimi-Horn M.C.

In a large scale analysis of RNA expression using microarrays in transformed mouse endothelial cells, we found that the majority of the genes induced in hypoxia require Net and HIF1α, suggesting that the functions of these factors are closely linked (18Gross C.

In our current study, we compared Net and HIF1α regulation in response to hypoxia in cells in which Net is a negative regulator (16van Riggelen J. Buchwalter G. Soto U. De-Castro Arce J. Hausen H.Z.

These cells (called “444”) are one of the components of a cell-based model of cervical cancer progression (19Stanbridge E.J.

We demonstrate that the hypoxia-induced signaling pathways that involve Net and HIF1α have distinct features and that there are interconnections between Net and HIF1α at various levels. These results suggest that Net and HIF1α cross-talk in response to hypoxia and that the functional status of either factor will influence the way the complementary factor orchestrates the physiological outcome. Non-malignant hybrids (444) made between HeLa and normal human fibroblasts (E. J.

For plasmid transfection experiments, 444 and HeLa cells were transfected with Jet-Pei (Polyplus Transfection). HEK293T were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. For small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection experiments, 444 cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as described previously (14Buchwalter G. Gross C. Wasylyk B. Mol. Cell.

The following chemicals were used: cobalt chloride (CoCl2; Alfa Aesar), iron chloride (FeCl2; Sigma), 2-oxoglutarate (Sigma), and ascorbic acid (Sigma). The siRNAs are as follows: human Net, PHD1, PHD2, PHD3, HIF1α siRNA (siGENOME SMARTpool reagent; Dharmacon Inc.); and GL2 luciferase control siRNA (14Buchwalter G. Gross C. Wasylyk B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10853-10862Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The plasmids are as follows: pcDNA3-FLAG-PHD1, pcDNA3-FLAG-PHD2 and pcDNA3- FLAG-PHD3, pcDNA3-(HA)-HIF-1, pcDNA3(Hygro)-GHO, pcDNA3(Hygro)-GHO(P→A), pcDNA3, and pSG5-puroFLAGNt (see supplemental information). For preparation of nuclear cell extracts and immunoblotting, see supplemental information. Antibodies and dilutions are as follows: anti-mouse Net antibody number 2620 (1/1000) for overexpression experiments; anti-rabbit Net antibody number 2005 (1/1000) for detection of endogenous levels; rabbit anti-HIF1α (1/500, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies); anti-FLAG® M2 (1/2000, Sigma, St.-Quentin-Fallavier, France); and anti-mouse hemagglutinin (HA), anti-TBP (1/1000, Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire (IGBMC) core facilities), and mouse anti-actin (1/2000, Sigma). For detection of FLAG-PHDs in co-immunoprecipitation experiments, mouse-TrueBlot ULTRA horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was used as the secondary antibody (1:2000, Clinisciences). For densitometric quantification, the TINA 2.09 (Raytest Isotopenmessgeräte GmbH, Straubenhardt, Germany) software was used. The quantitative RT-PCR was performed with the LightCycler 480 system (Roche diagnostics) and the SYBR Green I (Roche Diagnostics) protocol. Amplification specificity was verified by melting curve analyses, and the data were quantified with the LightCycler software. Oligonucleotides were as follows: RPLPO, 5′-CCGGATATGAGGCAGCAGTT-3′ and 5′-GAAGGCTGTGGTGCTGATGG-3′; Net, 5′-AGTCCACTGCTCTCCAGCAT-3′ and 5′-GCCAGACGTCATCAGGATTT-3′. The QuantiTect primers for PHD1, PHD2, PHD3, and HIF1α were provided by Qiagen. Co-transfected 444 and HeLa cells were washed thrice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.3 m KCl, 0.25 mm EDTA, 0.125 mm EGTA, 0.025% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Immune complexes were formed by incubation of the lysates overnight at 4 °C with anti FLAG (M2) agarose. The beads were washed four times with immunoprecipitation buffer, resuspended in non-denaturant Laemmli sample buffer, and processed for immunoblotting. 35S-labeled in vitro translated GHO, GHO(P→A), and Net were prepared using rabbit reticulocyte lysates (TnT Quick kit, Promega). After 45 min of reaction, the translation mixtures were supplemented or not with 100 μm FeCl2, 1 mm 2-oxoglutarate, and 5 mm ascorbate for 45 min at 30 °C. Reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. HeLa and HEK293T cells were transfected with FLAG-Net or GHO. 48 h after transfection, the cells were treated with 200 μm CoCl2 for 5 h and then washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in Laemmli sample buffer for HEK293T or lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, 1% Nonidet P-40) for HeLa. Total cell extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting. To study the integration of Net in the hypoxia/PHD/HIF1α signaling pathway, we compared the hypoxic regulation of Net and HIF1α in nuclear extracts of 444 cells in 1% O2. As we have shown previously, Net detected with the polyclonal antibody polyclonal antibody 2005 migrates as a series of bands (Fig. 1A) that result from post-translational modification by phosphorylation and possibly other modifications (8Gross C. Buchwalter G. Dubois-Pot H. Cler E. Zheng H. Wasylyk B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4133-4141Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 21Wasylyk C. Zheng H. Castell C. Debussche L. Multon M.C. Wasylyk B. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 1275-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We confirmed that these bands are down-regulated by siRNAs against Net in 444 (data not shown), similar to other cell lines we have studied (8Gross C. Buchwalter G. Dubois-Pot H. Cler E. Zheng H. Wasylyk B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4133-4141Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 21Wasylyk C. Zheng H. Castell C. Debussche L. Multon M.C. Wasylyk B. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 1275-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As reported previously, there is an additional non-identified band (n.i.) that is variable and is not down-regulated by Net siRNAs. It does not compromise the measurements of Net levels by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, Net protein levels decrease drastically after 12 h of hypoxia. In contrast, HIF1α protein levels follow a bell-shaped curve with a transient increase, peaking between 4 and 8 h of hypoxia, followed by a progressive decrease. We observed similar regulation of Net and HIF1α protein levels under hypoxia in total cell extracts (data not shown). To exclude that transcription accounts for the changes, we measured Net and HIF1α mRNA by real-time qRT-PCR. There were non-significant small variations in Net and HIF1α mRNA, which could not account for the observed changes at the protein level (Fig. 1C). Our results indicate that there are three time phases in the kinetics: 1) normoxia, high Net levels and low HIF1α levels; 2) early hypoxia (4–8 h), high levels of Net and HIF1α; and 3) late hypoxia (12–24 h), degradation of Net and HIF1α (Fig. 1B). PHDs require oxygen, iron, ascorbate, and 2-oxoglutarate to hydroxylate HIF1α on Pro-564 in normoxia (22Hausinger R.P. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 39: 21-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Iron-displacing transition metals, such as cobalt, act as strong inhibitors of the activity of PHDs (Fig. 2A). To investigate possible hydroxylation of Net, we compared the effect of modulating the activity of the PHDs in different systems on the mobility of Net in comparison with GHO (Gal4-HIF1α-(531–652)), which contains Pro-564 (23Huang J. Zhao Q. Mooney S.M. Lee F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39792-39800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 24Pan Y. Mansfield K.D. Bertozzi C.C. Rudenko V. Chan D.A.

As expected from previous reports, 35S-labeled GHO produced by in vitro transcription and translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate migrated as a doublet upon SDS-PAGE. Adding iron, ascorbate, and 2-oxoglutarate to the reaction induced a shift of migration, converting the slowly migrating non-hydroxylated species to the rapidly migrating hydroxylated form. The shift was not observed with GHO(PA), in which Pro-564 is mutated to Ala (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, 35S-labeled Net also migrated as a doublet, and the addition of the three cofactors shifted the mobility to the more rapidly migrating form (Fig. 2B). In transfected HEK293T cells, the hypoxia mimic, 200 μm CoCl2, decreased the mobility of GHO, as expected from lack of hydroxylation. Similarly, the migration of full-length Net was also decreased in HeLa cells. The migration of β-actin remained unchanged, showing that the shift was not due to nonspecific effects on migration (Fig. 2C). Taken together our data suggest that Net undergoes post-translational modifications that are induced by regulators of PHDs activity. To investigate whether the PHDs regulate Net protein stability in 444 cells in normoxia, we either down-regulated the PHDs with specific siRNAs or overexpressed them with expression vectors. The PHDs were efficiently down-regulated, as shown by qRT-PCR (Fig. 3A). In normoxia, Net protein levels in the nucleus were decreased by down-regulation of PHD1 and PHD3 and increased by down-regulation of PHD2 (Fig. 3, B and C). When we overexpressed the three PHD isoforms, the opposite effect was observed. PHD1 and PHD3 increased and PHD2 decreased Net protein levels (Fig. 3, D and E). We did not find any significant differences in Net mRNA levels (data not shown), demonstrating that the three PHDs are involved in the regulation of Net protein stability in normoxia. We then investigated how different levels of the PHDs would affect Net levels in hypoxia. The knockdown of PHD2 (Fig. 4, A and B) globally increased Net levels, and in particular, delayed Net down-regulation in late hypoxia (12 and 18 h) when compared with cells transfected with control siRNA targeting luciferase. Overexpression of PHD2 (Fig. 4, C and D) decreased Net levels, which was observed in particular early in hypoxia (4–8 h). These results indicate that the loss of Net during hypoxia requires PHD2. Down-regulation of PHD1 and to some extent PHD3 (Fig. 4, A and B) globally decreased Net levels, which was particularly evident early in hypoxia (4–8 h). Overexpression of PHD1 and PHD3 prevented loss of Net during hypoxia, which was most evident late in hypoxia (12 and 18 h). These results indicate that PHD1 and PHD3 help maintain Net levels during hypoxia. These opposing effects of PHD2 and PHD1 and PHD3 suggest that their relative levels of expression could fine-tune the dynamics of the response to hypoxia in terms of the levels of Net. To compare the role of the three PHDs in the regulation of HIF1α in the same experimental conditions as Net, we down-regulated and overexpressed the PHD isoforms in hypoxia. Silencing PHD2 and PHD3 significantly increased HIF1α protein level throughout the time course (Fig. 5, A and B). PHD1 down-regulation had no significant effects on HIF1α protein levels in normoxia and early hypoxia (up to 8 h; 8 h was not statistically significant) but delayed degradation of HIF1α in late hypoxia (12–18 h, Fig. 5, A and B). Overexpression of PHD2 and PHD3 strongly inhibited HIF1α levels throughout the time course, which was the opposite of down-regulation (Fig. 5, C and D). Overexpression of PHD1 decreased HIF1α induction early in hypoxia (4 h), a time at which down-regulation had no effect. This would be expected from an increased activity of PHD1 due to overexpression. PHD1 overexpression also had an effect at 12 h (Fig. 5D), which is apparently paradoxical because down-regulation had the same effect. This suggests that there are complex regulatory mechanisms that involve factors other than PHD1 expression levels. In contrast to Net regulation, both PHD2 and PHD3 play a similar role in all three time phases of hypoxia, whereas PHD1 appears to be mainly involved in the late phase. Taken together our results show that both Net and HIF1α are regulated by PHDs but in different manners. To investigate cross-talk between Net and HIF1α, we analyzed their reciprocal protein levels after inhibition by siRNA in normoxia (0 h) and early (6 h) and late (12 and 24 h) hypoxia. We found that down-regulation of Net impaired stabilization of HIF1α in early hypoxia and its degradation in late hypoxia when compared with the control (Fig. 6A). Down-regulation of HIF1α inhibited down-regulation of Net in late hypoxia (Fig. 6C). Overexpression of Net resulted in higher and prolonged induction of HIF1α (Fig. 6E). There were no significant changes at the mRNA level, as shown by qRT-PCR (Fig. 6, B, D, and F, right panels). These results indicate that Net is required for rapid induction of HIF1α by hypoxia, whereas HIF1α is necessary for Net degradation in hypoxia. We investigated whether Net and HIF1α knockdown would affect expression of PHD at the mRNA level in normoxia (0 h) and early (6 h) and late (12 and 24 h) hypoxia. The specific siRNAs were efficient because they decreased Net and HIF1α mRNA levels by at least 80% (Fig. 7, A and E). Hypoxia stimulated the expression of PHD2 2–3-fold and PHD3 about 6-fold, as expected (Fig. 7, C, D, G, and H), but did not affect PHD1 levels (Fig. 7, B and F). Net down-regulation had no significant effect on PHD1 and PHD2 levels in normoxia and hypoxia (Fig. 7, B and C) but decreased hypoxic induction of PHD3 (Fig. 7D). HIF1α down-regulation inhibited hypoxic induction of both PHD2 and PHD3 mRNA levels (Fig. 7, G and H) but had no significant effect on PHD1 levels (Fig. 7F). These results show that the Net and HIF1α regulate different PHDs; Net regulates PHD3, whereas HIF1α regulates both PHD2 and PHD3. In addition, the subsequent effects of the PHDs on the levels of Net and HIF1α suggest that transcriptional regulation could contribute to the cross-talk between Net and HIF1α at the protein level. We also investigated physical interactions between Net and the PHDs. 444 cells were co-transfected with Net and one of the three isoforms of FLAG-tagged PHDs or with the empty vector pcDNA3 as a control. The PHDs were immunoprecipitated with FLAG antibody-coupled beads, and co-precipitated Net was detected by Western blotting. We found that, in normoxia, Net specifically interacted with PHD1 and PHD3 but not detectably with PHD2 (Fig. 8, A and C). Similar results were obtained with co-expressed Net and the three PHDs in HeLa cells (data not shown). Interestingly, under hypoxic mimic conditions (CoCl2), Net interacted with PHD2 as well as with PHD1 and PHD3 (Fig. 8, B and C). We also investigated whether Net interacts with HIF1α. We co-expressed HIF1α and FLAG-Net in HeLa cells and immunoprecipitated FLAG-Net using FLAG (M2) antibody-coupled beads. HIF1α specifically co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-Net (Fig. 8D), indicating that Net physically interacts with HIF1α under these conditions. Taken together these data indicate that the PHDs, Net, and HIF1α can interact at the protein level and that the complexes that form depend upon hypoxia and the presence of HIF1α. In this study, we compared the hypoxia/PHDs/Net and hypoxia/PHDs/HIF1α pathways in human non-tumorigenic human papillomavirus-positive 444 cells. These cells were used because Net repression of the c-fos oncogene appears to account for their non-transforming properties (16van Riggelen J. Buchwalter G. Soto U. De-Castro Arce J. Hausen H.Z. Wasylyk B. Rösl F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3286-3294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Hypoxia is a mechanism by which Net repression can be relieved (8Gross C. Buchwalter G. Dubois-Pot H. Cler E. Zheng H. Wasylyk B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4133-4141Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), indicating that the 444 cell line is a good model to investigate the consequences of hypoxia-induced loss of Net on transformation. In addition, there are related transformed (HeLa, CGL3) and non-transformed (IMR90 fibroblasts) cells (19Stanbridge E.J. Lancet. 1976; 1: 525Abstract PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 20Stanbridge E.J. Nature. 1976; 260: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), which could be used to study the effects of transformation on the role of Net in hypoxia. We show that hypoxia regulates Net and HIF1α in 444 cells and that there are similarities and differences in this regulation. They exhibit similar mobility shifts in response to modulators of PHD activity. However the three PHDs regulate Net and HIF1α protein stability in different ways, suggesting that the hypoxia-Net and -HIF1α pathways are distinct. However, the two pathways are interlinked at the level of regulation of PHD expression and protein-protein interactions (see Fig. 9 for a schematic representation). These links could account for our previous observations that Net and HIF1α share a large number of target genes (18Gross C. Dubois-Pot H. Wasylyk B. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 1333-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Our results show that Net and HIF1α are differently regulated during the time course of hypoxia, suggesting that they have different roles in the hypoxic response. Net levels are high in normoxia and early hypoxia, whereas HIF1α is induced in early hypoxia. Both factors are degraded in late hypoxia. HIF1α induction is required for the cellular response to hypoxia, and its degradation in late hypoxia protects cells against necrotic cell death and adapts them to chronic hypoxia (26Ginouvès A. Ilc K. Macías N. Pouysségur J. Berra E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 4745-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The intricate link between Net and HIF1α suggests that Net modulates these functions of HIF1α. The PHDs are known to hydroxylate HIF1α on specific proline residues and thus regulate its stability (7Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M. Salic A. Asara J.M. Lane W.S.

Science. 2001; 292: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (4391) Google Scholar), which causes a characteristic shift in mobility on SDS-PAGE (23Huang J. Zhao Q. Mooney S.M. Lee F.S. J. Biol.

Biol. 2007; 27: 912-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Net undergoes similar mobility shifts using in vitro and in vivo assays, indicating that it may also be hydroxylated. The multiple Net bands in SDS-PAGE might correspond to different post-translational modifications (21Wasylyk C. Zheng H. Castell C. Debussche L. Multon M.C. Wasylyk B.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5063-5072Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), including hydroxylation. PHDs hydroxylate a number of proteins. PHD1 is involved in proline hydroxylation of RbpI, the large subunit of RNA polymerase II (28Mikhaylova O. Ignacak M.L. Barankiewicz T.J. Harbaugh S.V. Yi Y. Maxwell P.H. Schneider M. Van Geyte K.

The kinase activity of IκB kinase β may be inhibited by hydroxylation by PHD1 and PHD2 (29Cummins E.P. Berra E. Comerford K.M. Ginouves A. Fitzgerald K.T. Seeballuck F. Godson C. Nielsen J.E.

The stability of activating transcriptional factor 4 (ATF4) (30Köditz J. Nesper J. Wottawa M. Stiehl D.P. Camenisch G. Franke C. Myllyharju J. Wenger R.H. Katschinski D.M.

Chem. 2007; 282: 12410-12418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) is regulated by PHD3. However, it has not been proven directly that either protein is hydroxylated. We did not detect hydroxylated prolines in Net by mass spectroscopy, but these studies are not conclusive and are hampered by the proline-rich nature of the protein. 7H. Dubois-Pot-Schneider, B. Wasylyk, and A. van Dorsselaer, unpublished results. We have shown that the three PHDs affect Net in different ways (Fig. 9). PHD1 and PHD3 contribute to stabilization, whereas PHD2 is involved in Net degradation. In addition, we demonstrate that Net physically interacts with PHD2 in hypoxia, whereas PHD1 and PHD3 bind to Net in normoxia and hypoxia. In contrast, PHD2 and PHD3 regulate HIF1α stabilization in early and late hypoxia, whereas PHD1 appears to be involved in HIF1α degradation in late hypoxia. HIF1α has been reported to be mainly regulated by PHD2, although some studies suggest that all three isoforms can hydroxylate HIF1α with different efficiency (32Berra E. Benizri E. Ginouvès A. Volmat V. Roux D. Pouysségur J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4082-4090Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). Other proteins are also differentially regulated by the PHDs. PHD3 binds to myogenin and increases its stability (31Fu J. Menzies K. Freeman R.S. Taubman M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12410-12418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and also induces oxygen-dependent degradation of ATF4 (30Köditz J. Nesper J. Wottawa M. Stiehl D.P. Camenisch G. Franke C. Myllyharju J. Wenger R.H. Katschinski D.M. Blood. 2007; 110: 3610-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). PHD1 and PHD2 co-immunoprecipitate with Rpb1 in response to oxidative stress, but PHD1 is necessary for RbpI hydroxylation and consequent degradation, whereas PHD2 has an inhibitory effect on this process (28Mikhaylova O. Ignacak M.L. Barankiewicz T.J. Harbaugh S.V. Yi Y. Maxwell P.H. Schneider M. Van Geyte K. Carmeliet P. Revelo M.P. Wyder M. Greis K.D. Meller J. Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 2701-2717Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We present evidence that the Net and HIF1α pathways are interconnected at several levels. Changes in the initial protein levels of Net influence hypoxic regulation of HIF1α, suggesting that Net acts as a ‘rheostat,‘ which modulates the HIF1α-mediated hypoxic response in the cell. Induction of PHD2 and PHD3 in hypoxia partially counterbalances the diminution of oxygen, leading to increased hydroxylation and consequently proteasomal degradation of HIF1α (33Stiehl D.P. Wirthner R. Köditz J. Spielmann P. Camenisch G. Wenger R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23482-23491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Net inhibition down-regulates PHD3 in hypoxia and may thereby delay degradation of HIF1α. Similarly, HIF1α inhibition prevents the hypoxic induction of PHD2, which appears to be involved in Net down-regulation in late hypoxia. This could explain why HIF1α inhibition stabilizes Net in late hypoxia. However, the cross-talk between Net and HIF1α might also be a result of their physical interaction. We found that HIF1α down-regulation inhibits the hypoxic induction of PHD2 and PHD3 mRNA levels (Fig. 9), as expected from previous studies (33Stiehl D.P. Wirthner R. Köditz J. Spielmann P. Camenisch G. Wenger R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23482-23491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 34Aprelikova O. Chandramouli G.V. Wood M. Vasselli J.R. Riss J.

Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 947-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Net down-regulation decreased PHD3 mRNA induction in hypoxia, suggesting that Net is a positive transcriptional regulator of its expression. In contrast, Net represses PHD2 and PHD3 expression in transformed mouse skin endothelial cells (SEND) (18Gross C. Dubois-Pot H. Wasylyk B. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 1333-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), indicating that the role of Net in the hypoxic response is cell type-specific. Our results show that Net physically interacts with PHD1 and PHD3 in normoxia and in hypoxia mimic (cobalt chloride; Fig. 9). These results suggest that Net could be a substrate for both enzymes. Interestingly, the interaction of PHD3 with myogenin increases its stability by preventing Von Hippel–Lindau-mediated degradation (31Fu J. Menzies K. Freeman R.S. Taubman M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12410-12418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), which indicates that Net stabilization by PHDs could be also mediated by hydroxylation-independent mechanism. Interestingly, we found that PHD2 binds to Net only in hypoxic mimic conditions, which could be related to its involvement in the degradation of Net in late hypoxia. Moreover, we found that Net and HIF1α physically interact. This interaction could involve the PHDs, perhaps through the formation of a multiprotein complex. An interesting possibility is that HIF1α stabilization in hypoxia results in the recruitment of PHD2, which is involved in the degradation of Net in late hypoxia. In summary, this study demonstrates that Net and HIF1α form different signaling pathways, which are intricately linked at several levels. Thus, we have added important insights into the understanding of the mechanism of hypoxic regulation of Net and its integration into HIF1α signaling. Pharmacological modulation of Net and HIF1α and the investigation of the effect on cell physiology will further increase our understanding of the complex interplay between both transcription factors in the regulation of cellular adaptation to hypoxia.

There are a number of conserved hydrophilic, ionizable residues in the active site, all of which must be important to the overall reaction. In an attempt to determine the contribution to binding and rate enhancement of each of the residues in the active site, mutations at each residue are being made, and double mutants are being made to estimate the interrelationship between residues. Here, we report the effects of mutations of active site glutamate residues, Glu78 and Glu122, on reactant binding and catalysis. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate E78Q, E122Q, E78Q/E122Q, E78A, E122A, and E78A/E122A mutant enzymes. Mutation of these residues increases the positive charge of the active site and is expected to affect the pKa values of the catalytic groups. Each mutant enzyme was completely characterized with respect to its kinetic and chemical mechanism. The kinetic mechanism remains the same as that of wild type enzymes for all of the mutant enzymes, with the exception of E78A, which exhibits binding of α-ketoglutarate to E and E·NADH. Large changes in V/KLys, but not V, suggest that Glu78 and Glu122 contribute binding energy for lysine. Shifts of more than a pH unit to higher and lower pH of the pKa values observed in the V/KLys pH-rate profile of the mutant enzymes suggests that the presence of Glu78 and Glu122 modulates the basicity of the catalytic groups.

In the direction of saccharopine oxidation, once NAD and saccharopine are bound, a group with a pKa of 6.2 accepts a proton from the secondary amine of saccharopine as it is oxidized. The imine of saccharopine is hydrolyzed via general base-catalyzed activation of a water molecule, via the intermediacy of carbinolamine intermediates. The base participating in the hydrolysis reaction has a pKa of 7.2. Finally, the ϵ-amine of lysine is protonated by the conjugate acid of the base with a pKa of 6.2, and products are released (1Xu H. West A.H. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12156-12166Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 9Xu H. Alguindigue S.S. West A.H. Cook P.F.

Isotope effects suggest that hydride transfer and hydrolysis of the imine contribute to rate limitation (9Xu H. Alguindigue S.S. West A.H. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 871-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Structures of SDH have been solved in the apoenzyme form (11Burk D.L. Hwang J. Kwok E. Marrone L. Goodfellow V. Dmitrienko G.I. Berghuis A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and with either AMP or oxalylglycine (OG), analogues of NAD and α-Kg, bound (10Andi B. Xu H. Cook P.F. West A.H. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 12512-12521Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A semiempirical structure of the E·NAD·saccharopine ternary complex was generated on the basis of E·AMP and E·OG structures (Fig. 1) (10Andi B. Xu H. Cook P.F. West A.H. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 12512-12521Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Given the semiempirical nature of the model, the relative positions of reactants and active site groups are estimates, and the overall model represents an open form of the enzyme, e.g. the distance for hydride transfer from the Cα proton of the glutamyl moiety to the 4 position of the nicotinamide ring is 4.7 Å, much too long for hydride transfer. There are a number of ionizable residues in the active site, and a multiple sequence alignment of the SDH from C. albicans, Pichia guilliermondii, S. cerevisiae, A. fumigatus, and C. neoformans indicated that all are conserved in all five organisms, consistent with their importance in the mechanism. In the ternary complex, Arg131 and Arg18 are likely ion-paired to two of the carboxylates of saccharopine. In addition, however, there are three lysine residues, Lys99 in the vicinity of the α-carboxylate of saccharopine, Lys77 in the vicinity of the secondary amine of saccharopine, and Lys13 near Lys77; three glutamates, Glu122 near Lys99, Glu78 near Lys77 and Lys13, and Glu16 near Arg18; and an imidazole, His96. In the ternary complex, the nicotinamide ring of NAD is positively charged, but in the vicinity of Asp319, the secondary amine of saccharopine is positively charged given its pKa of about 10 (9Xu H. Alguindigue S.S. West A.H. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 871-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The active site is positively charged, and this will certainly affect the pKa values of all of the ionizable residues in the site. In this paper the role of Glu78 and Glu122 was studied by changing them to glutamine or alanine. Eliminating these negatively charged residues will increase the positive charge in the site and should affect the pKa values of the remaining residues, including the catalytic groups. In addition, previous studies suggest that there is a neutral acid in the vicinity of the secondary amine of saccharopine, and Glu78 and Glu122 are candidates for this residue (9Xu H. Alguindigue S.S. West A.H. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 871-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Mutant enzymes were characterized via the pH dependence of kinetic parameters and isotope effects. Data are discussed in terms of the proposed mechanism of SDH. l-Saccharopine, l-lysine, α-Kg, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase, and bakers' yeast aldehyde dehydrogenase were obtained from Sigma. β-NADH, β-NAD, Luria-Bertani (LB) broth, LB-agar, and imidazole were purchased form U. S. Biochemical Corp. Ches, Hepes, Mes, Taps, Tris, and imidazole were from Research Organics. Ethanol-d6 (99% atom D) and D2O (99.9% atom D) were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. Ethyl alcohol (absolute, anhydrous) was from Pharmaco-Aaper. Isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside was from Invitrogen, and the GenElute plasmid miniprep kit was from Sigma. Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA)-agarose resin was from Qiagen. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene, and the plasmid purification kit was from Sigma. Bradford reagent (protein assay dye reagent concentrate) was obtained from Bio-Rad. All chemicals were obtained commercially, were of the highest grade available and were used without further purification. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the plasmid sdhHX1, which contains the S. cerevisiae LYS1 gene (1Xu H. West A.H. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12156-12166Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), as a template to change Glu78 and Glu122 to Gln and Ala. The forward and reverse primers used to generate the E78Q, E122Q, E78A, and E122A are listed in the Table 1. Double mutant enzymes were prepared using the E78Q forward and reverse primers and the E122Q mutant gene to generate E78Q/E122Q, whereas E78A forward and reverse primers were used with the E122A mutant gene to generate E78A/E122A. The PCR procedure was as follows. The reaction mixtures were first heated to 94 °C for 1 min to activate the Pfu polymerase Turbo enzyme. Denaturation of double-stranded plasmid DNA was done at 94 °C for 1.5 min. Depending on the melting temperatures of the respective primers, annealing was set at 50–60 °C for 2 min. Extension of the new DNA was carried out at 68 °C for 8 min. The cycle was repeated 18 times, and completion of existing transcripts was done at 68 °C for 20 min. Original methylated plasmid was then digested using the DpnI restriction enzyme. The presence of the new plasmid was estimated by agarose gel electrophoresis, taking samples before and after addition of DpnI, from the PCR mixture. The XL-1-Blue competent cell strain of Escherichia coli was then transformed with the plasmids containing mutations. The transformed cells were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin, 100 μg/ml. Plasmids were isolated and purified using the GenElute plasmid minipreparation kit. The entire gene was then sequenced for all six mutations at the Sequencing Core of the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City, OK.TABLE 1DNA sequences of the forward and reverse PCR primersPrimersaThe mutated codon is indicated in bold letters.DNA sequence from 5′ to 3′E78Q ForwardAGAATCATTATAGGTTTGAAGCAATGCCTGAAACCGATACTTTCE78Q ReverseGAAAGTATCGGTTTCAGGCATTGCTTCAAACCTATAATGATTCTE122Q ForwardCGGTACTCTATATGATTTGCAATTTTTGGAAAATGACCE122Q ReverseGGTCATTTTCCAAAAATTGCAAATCATATAGAGTACCGE78A ForwardCATTATAGGTTTGAAGCAAATGCCTGAAACCGE78A ReverseCGGTTTCAGGCATTTGCTTCAAACCTATAATGE122A ForwardCACGGTACTCTATATGATTTGGCATTTTTGGAAAATGACCAAGGTE122A ReverseACCTTGGTCATTTTCCAAAAATGCCAAATCATATAGAGTACCGTGa The mutated codon is indicated in bold letters. Open table in a new tab E. coli BL21 (DE3) RIL cells were transformed with plasmids containing the E78Q, E122Q, E78A, E122A, E78Q/E122Q, or E78A/E122A mutant gene. All mutant proteins were expressed as described previously (1Xu H. West A.H. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12156-12166Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), using isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for induction. Protein purification was also carried out as for wild type (WT) enzyme (1Xu H. West A.H. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12156-12166Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) with the exception that the imidazole concentration employed to elute the mutant protein depended on the mutant enzyme being purified. Proteins bound to the Ni-NTA column were eluted using an imidazole gradient, 30–300 mm, at pH 8. The E78Q mutant enzyme eluted at 150–180 mm imidazole, whereas remaining mutant proteins eluted at 180–300 mm imidazole. Purity of the proteins was assessed using SDS-PAGE with the gel stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. Protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay, by measuring the absorbance at 595 nm (12Bradford M.M. Williams W.L. Fed. Proc. 1976; 35: 274Google Scholar). The SDH reaction was monitored via the appearance or disappearance of NADH at 340 nm (ϵ340 = 6220 m−1cm−1) using a Beckman DU 640 spectrophotometer. All assays were carried out at 25 °C, and the temperature was maintained using a Neslab RTE-111 water bath. Rate measurements were carried out in 0.5 ml of 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.2. Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme to a mixture containing all other reaction components, and the initial linear portion of the time course was used to calculate the initial velocity. The amount of enzyme added was determined using an enzyme concentration series (v versus [E]) for each mutant enzyme. Initial velocity patterns were obtained for both the E78Q and E122Q mutant enzymes in both reaction directions, but only in the direction of saccharopine formation for the E78A, E122A, E78Q/E122Q, and E78A/E122A mutant enzymes. All data were collected at 25 °C in 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.2. In the direction of lysine formation, initial rates were measured for E78Q and E122Q mutant enzymes, as a function of saccharopine concentration (0.5–10 Km) at different fixed levels of NAD (0.5–10 Km). In the direction of saccharopine formation, initial velocities for E78Q and E122Q were measured as a function of lysine concentration (0.5–10 Km) at different fixed levels of α-Kg (0.5–10 Km) with NADH maintained near saturation (≥10 Km). Additionally, initial velocity studies were also carried out for WT SDH as described previously (1Xu H. West A.H. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12156-12166Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Lysine was added as the hydrochloride salt. As a result of the high concentrations of lysine used, as high as 1.2 m, the effect of added NaCl on the initial rate was tested; no effect was found. Pairwise analyses were performed for E78A, E122A, E78Q/E122Q, and E78A/E122A, as described previously (1Xu H. West A.H. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12156-12166Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), in the direction of saccharopine formation. One substrate was varied (0.5–10 Km) at different fixed concentrations of the second one (0.5–10 Km), maintaining the third substrate near saturation (≥10 Km). This experiment was carried out for all reactant pairs: Lys/α-Kg, NADH/α-Kg, and NADH/Lys. Inhibition patterns were measured for all mutant proteins at the extremes of pH (6 and 9) using OG, a structural analogue of α-Kg, as the dead-end inhibitor. Lysine was varied at different fixed concentrations of OG including zero, whereas NADH and α-Kg were maintained at saturation and at a low concentration (2 Km), respectively. To determine whether there was a change in the kinetic mechanism, a dead-end inhibition pattern was also obtained for the E78A/E122A mutant protein at pH 7.2. The initial rate was measured at different fixed levels of NADH (around Ki NADH), varying OG (0.5–5 Ki), with lysine and α-Kg maintained at 2 Km. A pattern was also obtained by varying Lys (0.5–10 Km), at different fixed levels of OG, at fixed α-Kg (1.5 Km) and with NADH near saturation (10 Km). The appKi for OG in all cases was first estimated by measuring the rate as a function of OG with other reactants fixed at Km, plotting 1/v versus I, and extrapolating 1/v to zero. To determine whether the mutations affected the pKa values observed in the pH-rate profile of the WT SDH, initial velocity was measured in the direction of saccharopine formation as a function of pH at 25 °C. The pH dependence of V, the V/KLys, and V/Kα-Kg was measured as a function of pH (pH 5Garrad R.C. Bhattacharjee J.K. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7379-7384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Johansson E.

Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 12512-12521Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The V/K values were obtained by measuring the initial rate as a function of one substrate with all others maintained at saturation. Experiments were carried out for only the single mutant proteins, varying α-Kg with the other two substrates fixed at saturation (≥10 Km). For both double mutant enzymes, lysine inhibited the reaction at low concentrations of α-Kg, and thus V/Kα-Kg was not determined. The pH was maintained using the same buffers over the same pH range, as before (1Xu H. West A.H. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12156-12166Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). No buffer effects were observed on any mutant enzyme. The pH was recorded before and immediately after measuring the initial velocity at 25 °C; no significant differences were detected. Isotope effects were measured for all mutant enzymes in the pH-independent region of their pH-rate profiles (pH 5 for E78A; pH 9.5 for E78Q, E122Q, E122A and E78A/E122A; and pH 7.2 for E78Q/E122Q). Effects were measured in the direction of saccharopine formation, using NADD as the deuterated substrate (1Xu H. West A.H. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12156-12166Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). DV2 and D(V2/KLys) were obtained for all mutant proteins, by measuring the initial rates in triplicate, as a function of lysine concentration (0.5–10 Km), at saturating levels of α-Kg (10 Km) and NADH(D) (10 Km). 4R-4-2H NADH and NADH were prepared as described previously (13Viola R.E. Cook P.F. Cleland W.W. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 96: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, ethanol-d6 (or ethanol) and NAD were incubated with alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases in 6 mm Taps, pH 9, at room temperature, for 1–2 h. The pH was maintained at pH 9 using 0.1 n KOH throughout the reaction time course. After 2 h, the reaction was quenched by vortexing with a few drops of carbon tetrachloride, and the aqueous layer was separated. The purity of the final NADH(D) was estimated by measuring the absorbance ratio at 260/340 nm; a ratio of 2.27 ± 0.06 was obtained similar to the value of 2.15 ± 0.05 for pure compound (13Viola R.E. Cook P.F. Cleland W.W. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 96: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The concentrations of NADH(D) were estimated using a ϵ340 of 6220 m−1cm−1. The initial rates measured using the same concentrations of commercial NADH and the NADH prepared as above, were similar. The NADH(D), was used immediately after preparation without further purification. The isotope effects were obtained by direct comparison of initial rates, in triplicate, in D2O and H2O, in the pH(D)-independent region of the pH-rate profiles (14Schowen K.B. Schowen R.L. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 551-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). For rates measured in D2O, substrate preparation and pH(D) adjustments were done as described previously (1Xu H. West A.H. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12156-12166Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Initial rates were measured varying lysine at fixed saturating levels of NADH and α-Kg (≥10 Km). Reactions were initiated by adding a small amount of each of the mutant enzymes in H2O. Multiple isotope effects were determined in the direction of saccharopine formation, for all mutant enzymes, by direct comparison of the initial rates in H2O and D2O as above, varying lysine at a fixed saturating concentration of NADD and α-Kg (≥10 Km). Initial rate data were first analyzed graphically, using double reciprocal plots of initial velocities versus substrate concentrations and suitable secondary and tertiary plots to determine the quality of the data and the proper rate equation for data fitting. Data were then fitted using the appropriate equations according to Cleland (15Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar). and the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm (16Bishop C.M. Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1995: 290-291Google Scholar), supplied with the EnzFitter program from BIOSOFT, Cambridge, U.K. Kinetic parameters and their corresponding standard errors were estimated using a simple weighting method. Data obtained from the initial velocity patterns, in the absence of added products, were fitted using either Equation 1 for a sequential mechanism or Equation 2 with the constant term absent, or Equation 3 for competitive inhibition by B, in a sequential mechanism. Data obtained from dead-end inhibition patterns were fitted using Equations 4 and 5 for competitive and parabolic competitive inhibition by OG, respectively. Noncompetitive and uncompetitive inhibition data were fitted using Equations 6 and 7, respectively.

All other parameters are as defined above. The active site figure of SDH was prepared using PyMOL version 0.99 (18Delano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. Delano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2004Google Scholar). Expression of the E78Q, E122Q, E78Q/E122Q, E78A, E122A, and E78A/E122A mutant enzymes was nearly three times lower than that of the WT SDH using the same conditions employed for WT. The E78Q mutant enzyme was eluted from the Ni-NTA column with buffer containing 150–180 mm imidazole at pH 8, whereas all others eluted at ≥180 mm imidazole. Purity of the proteins was assessed using SDS-PAGE, and all of the mutant proteins were estimated to be >98% pure. The amount of purified enzyme obtained from a 1-liter culture for E78Q, E122Q, E78A, E122A, E78Q/E122Q, and E78A/E122A was 1, 0.7, 4, 3, 2.7, and 3.7 mg, respectively. His-tagged mutant SDH proteins are active and stable for months when kept at 4 °C in 100 mm Tris and 300 mm KCl at pH 8. Double reciprocal initial velocity patterns were obtained at pH 7, in both reaction directions, for the E78Q and E122Q mutant enzymes as discussed under “Experimental Procedures.” However, the cost of saccharopine prohibited measuring initial rate data for all of the mutant enzymes in the direction of Lys formation, and data were obtained only in the direction of saccharopine formation for the remaining mutant enzymes. Initial velocity patterns intersect to the left of the 1/v axis (data not shown), consistent with the sequential mechanism proposed for the WT enzyme. For the E78Q/E122Q mutant enzyme, the NADH/Lys pair exhibited a parallel double reciprocal plot, whereas the Lys/α-Kg pair illustrated inhibition by lysine at low α-Kg levels. The Michaelis constants for Lys and α-Kg increased 25- and 18-fold, respectively, for E78Q/E122Q. V2/KLysEt decreased about 60-fold for E122Q, whereas the V/K values for lysine and α-Kg decreased at least 22-fold for E78Q/E122Q. Kinetic parameters are summarized in Table 2.TABLE 2Kinetic parameters for the E78Q, E122Q, and E78Q/E122QKinetic parameters at pH 7.2SDH-WTE"
