https://openalex.org/W1983315064,"The neural basis of time perception is unknown. Here we show that neurons in the posterior parietal cortex (area LIP) represent elapsed time relative to a remembered duration. We trained rhesus monkeys to report whether the duration of a test light was longer or shorter than a remembered ""standard"" (316 or 800 ms) by making an eye movement to one of two choice targets. While timing the test light, the responses of LIP neurons signaled changes in the monkey's perception of elapsed time. The variability of the neural responses explained the monkey's uncertainty about its temporal judgments. Thus, in addition to their role in spatial processing and sensorimotor integration, posterior parietal neurons encode signals related to the perception of time."
https://openalex.org/W1994475466,"Lesion and pharmacological intervention studies have suggested that in both human patients and animals the hippocampus plays a crucial role in the rapid acquisition and storage of information from a novel one-time experience. However, how the hippocampus plays this role is poorly known. Here, we show that mice with NMDA receptor (NR) deletion restricted to CA3 pyramidal cells in adulthood are impaired in rapidly acquiring the memory of novel hidden platform locations in a delayed matching-to-place version of the Morris water maze task but are normal when tested with previously experienced platform locations. CA1 place cells in the mutant animals had place field sizes that were significantly larger in novel environments, but normal in familiar environments relative to those of control mice. These results suggest that CA3 NRs play a crucial role in rapid hippocampal encoding of novel information for fast learning of one-time experience."

https://openalex.org/W2142847927,"To investigate the role of the myelin-associated protein Nogo-A on axon sprouting and regeneration in the adult central nervous system (CNS), we generated Nogo-A-deficient mice. Nogo-A knockout (KO) mice were viable, fertile, and not obviously afflicted by major developmental or neurological disturbances. The shorter splice form Nogo-B was strongly upregulated in the CNS. The inhibitory effect of spinal cord extract for growing neurites was decreased in the KO mice. Two weeks following adult dorsal hemisection of the thoracic spinal cord, Nogo-A KO mice displayed more corticospinal tract (CST) fibers growing toward and into the lesion compared to their wild-type littermates. CST fibers caudal to the lesion-regenerating and/or sprouting from spared intact fibers-were also found to be more frequent in Nogo-A-deficient animals."
https://openalex.org/W1977841940,"After injury, axons of the adult mammalian brain and spinal cord exhibit little regeneration. It has been suggested that axon growth inhibitors, such as myelin-derived Nogo, prevent CNS axon repair. To investigate this hypothesis, we analyzed mice with a nogo mutation that eliminates Nogo-A/B expression. These mice are viable and exhibit normal locomotion. Corticospinal tract tracing reveals no abnormality in uninjured nogo-A/B(-/-) mice. After spinal cord injury, corticospinal axons of young adult nogo-A/B(-/-) mice sprout extensively rostral to a transection. Numerous fibers regenerate into distal cord segments of nogo-A/B(-/-) mice. Recovery of locomotor function is improved in these mice. Thus, Nogo-A plays a role in restricting axonal sprouting in the young adult CNS after injury."
https://openalex.org/W2056610728,"The failure of regeneration of severed axons in the adult mammalian central nervous system is thought to be due partly to the presence of endogenous inhibitors of axon regeneration. The nogo gene encodes three proteins (Nogo-A, -B, and -C) that have been proposed to contribute to this inhibition. To determine whether deletion of nogo enhances regenerative ability, we generated two lines of mutant mice, one lacking Nogo-A and -B but not -C (Nogo-A/B mutant), and one deficient in all three isoforms (Nogo-A/B/C mutant). Although Nogo-A/B-deficient myelin has reduced inhibitory activity in a neurite outgrowth assay in vitro, tracing of corticospinal tract fibers after dorsal hemisection of the spinal cord did not reveal an obvious increase in regeneration or sprouting of these fibers in either mouse line, suggesting that elimination of Nogo alone is not sufficient to induce extensive axon regeneration."

https://openalex.org/W2095402256,"Calcium is a second messenger in virtually all cells and tissues. Calcium signals in the nucleus have effects on gene transcription and cell growth that are distinct from those of cytosolic calcium signals; however, it is unknown how nuclear calcium signals are regulated. Here we identify a reticular network of nuclear calcium stores that is continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum and the nuclear envelope. This network expresses inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptors, and the nuclear component of InsP3-mediated calcium signals begins in its locality. Stimulation of these receptors with a little InsP3 results in small calcium signals that are initiated in this region of the nucleus. Localized release of calcium in the nucleus causes nuclear protein kinase C (PKC) to translocate to the region of the nuclear envelope, whereas release of calcium in the cytosol induces translocation of cytosolic PKC to the plasma membrane. Our findings show that the nucleus contains a nucleoplasmic reticulum with the capacity to regulate calcium signals in localized subnuclear regions. The presence of such machinery provides a potential mechanism by which calcium can simultaneously regulate many independent processes in the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2053358664,"Sensory deprivation during a critical period reduces spine motility and disrupts receptive field structure of layer 2/3 neurons in rat barrel cortex. To determine the locus of plasticity, we used laser scanning photostimulation, allowing us to rapidly map intracortical synaptic connectivity in brain slices. Layer 2/3 neurons differed in their spatial distributions of presynaptic partners: neurons directly above barrels received, on average, significantly more layer 4 input than those above the septa separating barrels. Complementary connectivity was found in deprived cortex: neurons above septa were now strongly coupled to septal regions, while connectivity between barrel regions and layer 2/3 was reduced. These results reveal competitive interactions between barrel and septal circuits in the establishment of precise intracortical circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2026899274,"Recent studies indicate that active zones (AZs)-sites of neurotransmitter release-may be assembled from preassembled AZ precursor vesicles inserted into the presynaptic plasma membrane. Here we report that one putative AZ precursor vesicle of CNS synapses-the Piccolo-Bassoon transport vesicle (PTV)-carries a comprehensive set of AZ proteins genetically and functionally coupled to synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Time-lapse imaging reveals that PTVs are highly mobile, consistent with a role in intracellular transport. Quantitative analysis reveals that the Bassoon, Piccolo, and RIM content of individual PTVs is, on average, half of that of individual presynaptic boutons and shows that the synaptic content of these molecules can be quantitatively accounted for by incorporation of integer numbers (typically two to three) of PTVs into presynaptic membranes. These findings suggest that AZs are assembled from unitary amounts of AZ material carried on PTVs."

https://openalex.org/W2144454171,"Intracellular free Ca2+ regulates diverse cellular processes, including membrane potential, neurotransmitter release, and gene expression. To examine the cellular mechanisms underlying the generation of circadian rhythms, nucleus-targeted and untargeted cDNAs encoding a Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent protein (cameleon) were transfected into organotypic cultures of mouse suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the primary circadian pacemaker. Circadian rhythms in cytosolic but not nuclear Ca2+ concentration were observed in SCN neurons. The cytosolic Ca2+ rhythm period matched the circadian multiple-unit-activity (MUA)-rhythm period monitored using a multiple-electrode array, with a mean advance in phase of 4 hr. Tetrodotoxin blocked MUA, but not Ca2+ rhythms, while ryanodine damped both Ca2+ and MUA rhythms. These results demonstrate cytosolic Ca2+ rhythms regulated by the release of Ca2+ from ryanodine-sensitive stores in SCN neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2070583923,"The extraordinary cellular heterogeneity of the mammalian nervous system has largely hindered the molecular analysis of neuronal identity and diversity. In order to uncover mechanisms involved in neuronal differentiation and diversification, we have monitored the expression profiles of individual neurons and progenitor cells collected from dissociated tissue or captured from intact slices. We demonstrate that this technique provides a sensitive and reproducible representation of the single-cell transcriptome. In the olfactory system, hundreds of transcriptional differences were identified between olfactory progenitors and mature sensory neurons, enabling us to define the large variety of signaling pathways expressed by individual progenitors at a precise developmental stage. Finally, we show that regional differences in gene expression can be predicted from transcriptional analysis of single neuronal precursors isolated by laser capture from defined areas of the developing brain."
https://openalex.org/W2017759961,"ADAMTS1 is a metalloprotease previously shown to inhibit angiogenesis in a variety of in vitro and in vivo assays. In the present study, we demonstrate that ADAMTS1 significantly blocks VEGFR2 phosphorylation with consequent suppression of endothelial cell proliferation. The effect on VEGFR2 function was due to direct binding and sequestration of VEGF165 by ADAMTS1. Binding was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and cross-linking analysis. Inhibition of VEGF function was reversible, as active VEGF could be recovered from the complex. The interaction required the heparin-binding domain of the growth factor, because VEGF121 failed to bind to ADAMTS1. Structure/function analysis with independent ADAMTS1 domains indicated that binding to VEGF165 was mediated by the carboxyl-terminal (CT) region. ADAMTS1 and VEGF165 were also found in association in tumor extracts. These findings provide a mechanism for the anti-angiogenic activity of ADAMTS1 and describe a novel modulator of VEGF bioavailability.

Extracellular matrix proteins can significantly modulate growth factor signaling. This occurs to a large extent, but not exclusively, from direct non-covalent interactions that mediate selective anchorage of growth factors to the extracellular milieu (1Vlodavsky I. Folkman J.

Several extracellular matrix molecules have been shown to bind and sequester growth factors, as well as to enhance signaling by altering presentation to receptor binding sites (4Gengrinovitch S.

Angiogenesis is particularly sensitive to this type of regulation due to the critical role of paracrine growth factors in endothelial cell migration and proliferation.

Cancer. 2002; 2: 795-803Google Scholar). Haploinsufficiency of this gene is incompatible with development due to major vascular abnormalities, as demonstrated by inactivation of the gene through homologous recombination (14Carmeliet P. Ferreira V. Breier G. Pollefeyt S. Kieckens L. Gertsenstein M. Fahrig M. Vandenhoeck A. Harpal K. Eberhardt C. Declercq C. Pawling J. Moons L. Collen D. Risau W. Nagy A.

Isoforms of VEGF are secreted by diverse cell types including smooth muscle, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells. These proteins function by activation of two tyrosine kinase receptors, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, as well as by binding to non-receptor tyrosine kinase coreceptors such as neuropilin 1 and 2 on endothelial cells (16Shibuya M. Cell Struct. Funct. 2001; 26: 25-35Google Scholar, 17Neufeld G. Cohen T. Gengrinovitch S. Poltorak Z. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 9-22Google Scholar). ADAMTS1 was the first member of a growing family of ADAMTS extracellular proteases characterized by the presence of disintegrin-like metalloprotease and a variable number of thrombospondin-like domains (18Vazquez F.

J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 556-562Google Scholar). Once secreted, ADAMTS1 activation requires furin cleavage and removal of the pro-domain. The active protease can undergo a secondary processing event that separates the catalytic subunit from the thrombospondin (TSP) repeats (20Kuno K. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13912-13917Google Scholar, 21Rodriguez-Manzaneque J.C. Milchanowski A.B. Dufour E.K. Leduc R. Iruela-Arispe M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33471-33479Google Scholar). These TSP motifs in TSP1 and TSP2 have been shown to block angiogenesis by several, and likely not independent, mechanisms (22Taraboletti G. Belotti D. Borsotti P. Vergani V. Rusnati M. Presta M. Giavazzi R. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 471-479Google Scholar, 23Rodriguez-Manzaneque J.C. Lane T.F. Ortega M.A. Hynes R.O. Lawler J. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We demonstrated previously that ADAMTS1 is able to suppress capillary growth using multiple in vivo and in vitro assays (18Vazquez F. Hastings G. Ortega M.A. Lane T.F. Oikemus S. Lombardo M. Iruela-Arispe M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23349-23357Google Scholar). Interestingly, the ability of ADAMTS1 to inhibit neovascularization in vivo was greater than that of endostatin and TSP1 at the same molar ratio. The findings are intriguing and appear in marked contrast to the current paradigm that MMPs are pro-migratory and pro-angiogenic (25Egeblad M. Werb Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 161-174Google Scholar, 26Coussens L.M. Fingleton B. Matrisian L.M. Science. 2002; 295: 2387-2392Google Scholar, 27Vihinen P. Kahari V.M. Int. J.

In an effort to determine the mechanism(s) responsible for the angiostatic properties of ADAMTS1, we investigated its effects on endothelial cell growth and found that ADAMTS1 was able to drastically decrease VEGFR2 phosphorylation by a mechanism that involved direct binding and sequestration of VEGF165. The interaction was also verified in vivo using xenograft assays engineered to express ADAMTS1. Our results demonstrate that ADAMTS1 binds to VEGF165, and that this impacts the bioavailability of VEGF with consequences to receptor phosphorylation, endothelial proliferation, and angiogenesis. Cells—Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC), human embryonic kidney 293T cells expressing full-length human ADAMTS1 or vector alone (18Vazquez F. Hastings G. Ortega M.A. Lane T.F. Oikemus S. Lombardo M. Iruela-Arispe M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23349-23357Google Scholar), and breast tumor-derived T47D cells expressing deletion ADAMTS1 constructs were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC, provided by Dr. Judith Berliner, Department of Pathology, UCLA) were grown in medium 199 containing 20% fetal calf serum, endothelial cell growth supplement (20 μg/ml), and heparin (90 μg/ml) (Sigma). Porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAE) transfected with VEGFR2 or vector alone (provided by Dr. Gera Neufeld, Technicon, Israel) were grown in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Generation of Monoclonal Antibodies against ADAMTS1—Balb/c mice were immunized by intraperitoneal injections of purified ADAMTS1 (10 μg) (21Rodriguez-Manzaneque J.C. Milchanowski A.B. Dufour E.K. Leduc R. Iruela-Arispe M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33471-33479Google Scholar) and complete Freud coadjuvant (300 μl). Additional immunizations were done with incomplete Freud coadjuvant at days 15 and 33 (intraperitoneal injection) and intravenously at day 45. At day 48, spleenocytes were obtained from immunized mice and fused with SP2 myeloma cells at a 4:1 ratio following established techniques (29Luque A. Gomez M. Puzon W. Takada Y. Sanchez-Madrid F. Cabanas C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11067-11075Google Scholar). Conditioned media from hybridoma cultures were screened by ELISA against purified ADAMTS1 coated to plastic. Further characterization of positive clones was performed by immunoprecipitation, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry. From 101 positive wells, twelve hybridomas were cloned by repeated limiting dilution based on epitopes and specific properties.

A pulse of 1 μCi/well of [3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences) was applied over the last 8 h prior to harvesting. Cells were washed and fixed in 10% trichloroacetic acid. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine was determined by scintillation counting, as described previously (30Iruela-Arispe M.L. Sage E.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 52: 414-430Google Scholar). Phosphorylation Assays—Subconfluent cells were incubated overnight in serum-free medium and subsequently preincubated for 5 min with 0.1 mm Na3VO4 to inhibit phosphatase activity. Cultures were then washed once and pretreated with 1.5 ml of conditioned media from 293T cells expressing ADAMTS1 or vector alone for 15 min at 37 °C. The concentration of ADAMTS1 in the conditioned media ranges between 5.85 μg/ml (66 nm) and 16.7 μg/ml (191 nm). These values were obtained by ELISA against a standard curve of purified ADAMTS1 (data not shown). Cells were stimulated for 6 min at 37 °C with specified concentration of VEGF165. The incubation was terminated by removal of the medium and washes with cold phosphate-buffered saline/0.2 mm Na3VO4. Cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 2.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml of aprotinin) at 4 °C for 15 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 30 min at 14,000 × g. Equal amounts of cell lysate were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Phosphorylated proteins were detected by immunoblotting using antiphosphotyrosine antibodies (polyclonal or mAb PY20, BD Transduction Laboratories) followed by secondary antibodies coupled with horseradish peroxidase and visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Pierce). Protein-loading control was assessed by Western blot using anti-VEGFR2 (A-3, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and or anti-enolase antibodies. Immunoprecipitation—Cell lysates were precleared with 40 μl of protein G-agarose (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were discarded by centrifugation, and the supernatant was incubated with 1 μg/ml of the antiphosphotyrosine antibody (PY20) overnight at 4 °C followed by addition of protein G-agarose for 1 h under continuous agitation. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and extracted in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer by boiling 5 min, fractionated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE, and further analyzed by Western blot with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies. ADAMTS1 was immunoprecipitated from tumor lysates (450 μg) as described above using the mAb 5C6D5. The presence of coimmunoprecipitated VEGF was assessed by Western blot using polyclonal anti-VEGF, 375 (generous gift from Don Senger, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston). Levels of ADAMTS1 were determined by Western analysis (mAb 5C6D5). Radiolabeling of VEGF—VEGF165 was labeled with 125I-Na using iodogen as coupling agent. Briefly, VEGF165 (2 μg) was incubated in 200 μl of borate buffer (0.01 m Na2B4O7, 0.14 m NaCl, pH 8.2) with 0.3 mCi of 125I-Na (Amersham Biosciences) in IODO-GEN-precoated iodination tubes (Pierce) 5 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by transfer to a fresh tube containing 40 μl of 0.4 mg/ml tyrosine in borate buffer for 1 min at room temperature and adding 200 μl of 1 mg/ml IK in phosphate-buffered saline/1% BSA. 125I-VEGF165 was separated from free iodine using size exclusion chromatography on Sephadex-G25 columns (Amersham Biosciences). The specific radioactivity of the purified iodinated VEGF165 was 18,886 cpm/ng. Quality and integrity of the labeled VEGF was assessed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography of the dried gel. Binding Assays—Subconfluent cells were incubated at low serum (2% serum for HAEC and 0.1% for PAE and PAE-VEGFR2 cells) for 5 h at 37 °C, rinsed in binding buffer (media containing 20 mm HEPES, 0.2% gelatin) and equilibrated at 4 °C for 15 min. Indicated concentrations of 125I-VEGF165 were added to the wells in a final volume of 350 μl of binding buffer in the presence or absence of ADAMTS1. After 1 h of incubation at 4 °C, cells were washed four times in binding buffer and solubilized in 500 μl of lysis buffer (2% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mg/ml BSA). Bound protein was assessed on a γ-counter. Nonspecific binding was calculated in the presence of 20-fold excess of cold VEGF165. Specific binding was determined by subtracting nonspecific binding from total binding. Purification of ADAMTS1 and Evaluation of VEGF Levels—Recombinant ADAMTS1 protein was purified from conditioned media of stable 293T cells expressing ADAMTS1 by heparin and Zn2+-chelate affinity chromatography (21Rodriguez-Manzaneque J.C. Milchanowski A.B. Dufour E.K. Leduc R. Iruela-Arispe M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33471-33479Google Scholar). Conditioned media from 293T cells transfected with the vector alone was used as control. Presence of VEGF in the ADAMTS1 fractions was assessed by Western blot (Chemicon). Levels of ADAMTS1 were tested using the mAb 5D4E11B5 after stripping of the same membrane. Gel Permeation Chromatography—ADAMTS-VEGF complexes purified by heparin chromatography were concentrated to 1 ml and dialyzed into 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm 1-decanesulfonic acid sodium salt (DSS). Sample was loaded onto a Superdex 75 HR 10/30, previously equilibrated in 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.3% Zwittergent 3–12. Chromatography was carried out at 4 °C with a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min (at 1100 psi). Fractions of 300 μl were collected and evaluated by Western blots. Binding of VEGF to Immobilized ADAMTS1—ADAMTS1 was immunoprecipitated from conditioned media of stably transfected 293T cells using the mAb 5C6D5. Protein A beads were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100, 1% BSA, 1 mm CaCl2,1mm MgCl2, and equilibrated in binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% BSA, 1 mm CaCl2,1mm MgCl2). Soluble ligands: VEGF165 (50 ng) (R&D Systems) and/or heparin (50 ng) (Sigma), were added to the pellets in a final volume of 500 μl of binding buffer, and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were subsequently washed three times with binding buffer. Proteins bound to the immunoconjugates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the presence of coimmunoprecipitated VEGF was analyzed by Western blots. Immunoprecipitated ADAMTS1 was tested reproving the same membrane with the mAb 5D4E11B5. Cross-linking Experiments Using Purified Proteins—Purified ADAMTS1 (1.25 μg) was incubated with VEGF165 (25 ng) in the presence or absence of heparin (50 ng) in 75 μl of binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.2) for 2 h at room temperature. Bound proteins were cross-linked with disuccinimydil suberate (1.5 mm) (Pierce) for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 20 mm Tris, 50 mm glycine, 2 mm EDTA (pH7.4) for 15 min at room temperature. The samples were processed by SDS-PAGE, and protein complexes, indicating protein-protein interaction, were visualized by Western blots. Cross-linking Experiments Using Conditioned Media—Subconfluent 293T or T47D cells expressing full-length or different deletion constructs of ADAMTS1 or pCDNA (negative control) grown on 24-well plates were washed twice with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated in 300 μl of serum-free media for 18 h in the presence or absence of VEGF165 (150 ng) or VEGF121 (125 ng) (provided by Dr. Gera Neufeld) with or without heparin (1.5 μg). Conditioned media was collected, and the interacting proteins were cross-linked and analyzed as described above. Xenograft Tumor Assays and Tumor Protein Extraction—Control and ADAMTS1 tumors were generated in 6-week-old male nude mice (Charles River Laboratories) by subcutaneous flank injection of both T47D control (empty vector) or ADAMTS1 (5 × 106 cells/injection). When tumors reached 1,500 mm3, mice were euthanized, and dissected tumors were diced, sieved, and solubilized in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 2.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin) at 4 °C for 1 h. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 1 h at 14,000 × g. Expression of the Carboxyl-terminal (CT) Region of ADAMTS1 in T47D Cells—The construct for expression of the CT region of ADAMTS1 corresponding to Pro549–Ser951 was obtained by PCR of the full-length cDNA. A KpnI site was introduced at the 5′-end by site-directed mutagenesis using the following forward oligo: 5′TTTTCATGGTACCTGGGGAATGTGGG-3′. The reverse oligo used was 5′-ACTGCATTCTGCCTTTGTGCAAAAGTC-3′. The resulting PCR product was cloned into the pSecTag2/Hygro B vector (Invitrogen) using KpnI/EcoRV. Stable transfectant clones were generated using this plasmid in T47D cells by calcium phosphate transfection and selected with hygromycin-B (300 μg/ml). ADAMTS1 Inhibits the Mitogenic Effect of VEGF165Affecting VEGFR2 Phosphorylation—In a previous report we showed that ADAMTS1 antagonizes endothelial cell proliferation induced by a combination of FGF-2 and VEGF165 (18Vazquez F. Hastings G. Ortega M.A. Lane T.F. Oikemus S. Lombardo M. Iruela-Arispe M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23349-23357Google Scholar). To further dissect the mechanism of action of ADAMTS1, we repeated these experiments using each growth factor independently and in combination. Addition of recombinant ADAMTS1 decreased cell proliferation induced by FGF2 (49% ± 16%) and FGF-2 + VEGF165 (78% ± 18%). Proliferative signals mediated by VEGF165 were completely blocked in the presence of ADAMTS1 (Fig. 1A). The mitogenic action of all VEGF isoforms is mediated through binding to the 205-kDa receptor tyrosine kinase VEGFR2 (31Bernatchez P.N. Soker S. Sirois M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31047-31054Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether activation of VEGFR2 was affected by ADAMTS1. VEGFR2 phosphorylation was strongly inhibited by ADAMTS1 in several endothelial cell cultures including PAE-VEGFR2 (Fig. 1B), BAEC (Fig. 1C) and human aortic endothelial cells (data not shown). Stimulation of BAEC with increasing concentrations of VEGF165 resulted in a dose-dependent phosphorylation of VEGFR2 and ADAMTS1 reduced the levels of phospho-VEGFR2 in all cases (Fig. 1D). Together these results imply a direct link between VEGF165 signaling and the anti-angiogenic effects mediated by ADAMTS1. As a possible explanation for the ADAMTS1 inhibition of VEGFR2 phosphorylation, we tested whether binding of VEGF165 to the endothelial cell surface was affected by ADAMTS1. 125I-VEGF165 bound to HAEC (Fig. 2A) and PAEVEGFR2 cells (Fig. 2B) in a concentration-dependent manner; however it did not bind to VEGFR2-deficient cells (PAE) (Fig. 2B). It has been documented that saturation binding occurs at 10 ng/ml with VEGF165 (32Bikfalvi A. Sauzeau C. Moukadiri H. Maclouf J. Busso N. Bryckaert M. Plouet J. Tobelem G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 149: 50-59Google Scholar). The specific binding of 125I VEGF165 (16 ng/ml) to HAEC (Fig. 2A) was 14.7%, while saturation binding in PAE-VEGFR2 was lower, 8.9% after incubation with 12 ng/ml of radioiodinated VEGF (Fig. 2B). Presence of purified ADAMTS1 reduced 125I-VEGF165 specific binding by 69% (Fig. 2C). VEGF Co-purifies with ADAMTS1—It has been reported that TSP repeats in thrombospondin 1 and in connective tissue growth factor bind to VEGF165 and modulate its activity on endothelial cells (33Gupta K. Gupta P. Wild R. Ramakrishnan S. Hebbel P. Angiogenesis. 1999; 3: 147-158Google Scholar, 34Inoki I. Shiomi T. Hashimoto G. Enomoto H. Nakamura H. Makino K. Ikeda E. Takata S. Kobayashi K. Okada Y. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 219-221Google Scholar, 35Criscuolo G.R. Merrill M.J. Oldfield E.H. J. Neurosurg. 1988; 69: 254-262Google Scholar). The CT of ADAMTS1 contains three domains that share significant homology to the TSP repeats of the TSP1 molecule (18Vazquez F. Hastings G. Ortega M.A. Lane T.F. Oikemus S. Lombardo M. Iruela-Arispe M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23349-23357Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the possibility of an interaction between ADAMTS1 and VEGF165 as a regulatory mechanism to explain the effect of ADAMTS1 on VEGFR2 phosphorylation and the binding to the endothelial cell surface. We found that indeed VEGF (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–3) was present in the samples containing ADAMTS1 (Fig. 3A, lanes 5–7) after purification from heparin affinity chromatography (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 5) and from chromatography on a Zn2+-chelate affinity column (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 6, 3 and 7). Although detection of VEGF in the first purification step was not surprising, since VEGF interacts avidly with heparin (34Inoki I. Shiomi T. Hashimoto G. Enomoto H. Nakamura H. Makino K. Ikeda E. Takata S. Kobayashi K. Okada Y. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 219-221Google Scholar, 36Ferrara N. Henzel W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 161: 851-858Google Scholar); its presence after Zn2+ chromatography was unexpected since this growth factor does not bind to Zn2+. To ascertain the degree of purification of VEGF from these two chromatography procedures in the absence of ADAMTS1, conditioned media from parental cell lines transfected with vector alone was subjected to the same chromatography purification. As expected, VEGF was eluted from heparin column at 1 m (Fig. 3B), whereas no binding was detected on Zn2+-chelate affinity chromatography in the absence of ADAMTS1 (Fig. 3C). 293T cells have been shown previously to secrete VEGF; our results concur with those findings (37Mukhopadhyay D. Akbarali H.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 733-738Google Scholar, 38Tian X. Song S. Wu J. Meng L. Dong Z. Shou C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 505-512Google Scholar). These results provide evidence that VEGF binds to ADAMTS1. The two molecules can be dissociated and purified from one another by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 4A). When bound to ADAMTS1, VEGF165 was unable to phosphorylate VEGFR2 (Fig. 4B, sample A). However, VEGF165 regained its activity when dissociated from the protease (Fig. 4B, sample 13). ADAMTS1 Binds to VEGF165—The interaction of ADAMTS1 with VEGF165 was also evaluated by co-immunoprecipitation and cross-linking assays. Conditioned media was collected from cells that were stably transfected with either vector alone (pCDNA) or ADAMTS1 and immunoprecipitated with anti-ADAMTS1 antibodies. The immunocomplexes were subsequently incubated with VEGF165, and binding was evaluated by Western blots. VEGF165 was detected in the ADAMTS1 immunocomplexes and addition of exogenous heparin increased binding of ADAMTS1 to VEGF165 (Fig. 5A). No VEGF165 was bound to immunoprecipitated complexes when media conditioned from cells expressing vector alone was used (Fig. 5A). Cross-linking experiments were conducted with disuccinimydil suberate to evaluate physical proximity of ADAMTS1 and VEGF165. Heterodimeric complexes of about 250 and 130 kDa were detected with VEGF antibodies in the presence of ADAMTS1 (Fig. 5B). VEGF antibodies also recognized 130-kDa species in the ADAMTS1 preparations, indicating presence of VEGF in ADAMTS1 preparations as demonstrated previously (Fig. 3). We predict that the 130-kDa form corresponds to the sum of ADAMTS1 (87 kDa) and VEGF (43 kDa). Addition of heparin enhanced the formation of the high molecular weight complexes; however, the presence of heparin was not a requirement (Fig. 5B). To ascertain whether ADAMTS1-VEGF165 complexes were formed in vivo, we incubated 293T cells transfected with ADAMTS1 or empty vector with purified VEGF165 and heparin. Evaluation of VEGF after cross-linking revealed a shifted band of about 130 kDa only in the ADAMTS1-conditioned media (Fig. 5C). Under these experimental conditions, formation of the complex ADAMTS1-VEGF165 required heparin. To ensure the presence of ADAMTS1 in the 130-kDa band, the same blot was re-probed with anti-ADAMTS1 antibodies (Fig. 5C, blot to the right). Indeed a 130-kDa band was found only in the presence of VEGF165 and overlapped with the band identified by the VEGF antisera. Cross-linking experiments were also performed with VEGF121; however, no interaction was found (Fig. 5D). These results indicated that the carboxyl-terminal heparin-binding domain of VEGF participates in an interaction with ADAMTS1. ADAMTS1 and VEGF Form Complexes in Vivo—The in vitro data implied that one possible mechanism for ADAMTS1 activity is binding and inactivation of VEGF165 function. Therefore, we investigated whether ADAMTS1 and VEGF formed complexes in vivo. The experiments were performed using xenograft tumor lysates from T47D mammary carcinoma cells expressing either ADAMTS1 or vector alone (pCDNA). As previously described, we found that biochemical evaluation of VEGF from tissues/tumors reveals multiple bands immunoreactive with several independent VEGF antibodies (Fig. 6A) (39Goldbrunner R.H.

https://openalex.org/W2054378529,"Brain dopaminergic transmission is a critical component in numerous vital functions, and its dysfunction is involved in several disorders, including addiction and Parkinson's disease. Responses to dopamine are mediated via G protein-coupled dopamine receptors (D1-D5). Desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors is mediated via phosphorylation by members of the family of G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRK1-GRK7). Here we show that GRK6-deficient mice are supersensitive to the locomotor-stimulating effect of psychostimulants, including cocaine and amphetamine. In addition, these mice demonstrate an enhanced coupling of striatal D2-like dopamine receptors to G proteins and augmented locomotor response to direct dopamine agonists both in intact and in dopamine-depleted animals. The present study indicates that postsynaptic D2-like dopamine receptors are physiological targets for GRK6 and suggests that this regulatory mechanism contributes to central dopaminergic supersensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2025838418,"Prostate cancer (CaP) is initially androgen sensitive and responsive to hormone ablation therapy. However, cancer growth recurs despite androgen deprivation in the majority of cases of advanced disease. The molecular basis of this progression still remains unknown. The significance of androgen receptor (AR) coactivator proteins in this androgen-dependent malignancy is only beginning to emerge. In the present study, we examined the role of Tat interactive protein, 60 kDa (Tip60), an AR coactivator, in CaP progression. In hormone refractory CaP biopsies, we observed a nuclear accumulation of Tip60 expression in contrast to a more diffuse distribution pattern observed in benign prostate hyperplasia and primary CaP. Furthermore, in both the prostate xenograft model CWR22 and the LNCaP CaP cell line, we observed that androgen withdrawal promoted upregulation of Tip60 as well as nuclear accumulation. In contrast, androgen exposure resulted in decreased Tip60 expression that was more closely linked to a cytoplasmic presence. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed Tip60's recruitment to the PSA gene promoter in both androgen-dependent and -independent cell lines. Thus, in vitro and in vivo data support a possible role for Tip60 in the molecular pathway leading to the development of androgen-independent CaP following long-term androgen deprivation therapy."

https://openalex.org/W1491610362,"Failure of axon regeneration in the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS) is at least partly due to inhibitory molecules associated with myelin. Recent studies suggest that an axon surface protein, the Nogo receptor (NgR), may play a role in this process through an unprecedented degree of crossreactivity with myelin-associated inhibitory ligands. Here, we report the 1.5 A crystal structure and functional characterization of a soluble extracellular domain of the human Nogo receptor. Nogo receptor adopts a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) module whose concave exterior surface contains a broad region of evolutionarily conserved patches of aromatic residues, possibly suggestive of degenerate ligand binding sites. A deep cleft at the C-terminal base of the LRR may play a role in NgR association with the p75 coreceptor. These results now provide a detailed framework for focused structure-function studies aimed at assessing the physiological relevance of NgR-mediated protein-protein interactions to axon regeneration inhibition."

https://openalex.org/W2003393686,"G protein-coupled potassium channels (GIRK/Kir3.x) are key determinants that translate inhibitory chemical neurotransmission into changes in cellular excitability. To understand the mechanism of channel activation by G proteins, it is necessary to define the structural rearrangements in the channel that result from interaction with Gβγ subunits. In this study we used a combination of fluorescence spectroscopy and through-the-objective total internal reflection microscopy to monitor the conformational rearrangements associated with the activation of GIRK channels in single intact cells. We detect activation-induced changes in FRET consistent with a rotation and expansion of the termini along the central axis of the channel. We propose that this rotation and expansion of the termini drives the channel to open by bending and possibly rotating the second transmembrane segment."
https://openalex.org/W2079118385,"In rodents, each main olfactory bulb contains two mirror-symmetric glomerular maps, a feature not found in the initial topographic maps of other sensory systems. Targeting tracer injections to identified glomeruli revealed that isofunctional odor columns-translaminar assemblies connected to a given glomerulus-were specifically and reciprocally interconnected through a mutually inhibitory circuit with exquisite topographic specificity. Thus, instead of containing two mirror-symmetric maps, we propose that the olfactory bulb contains a single integrated map in which isofunctional odor columns are connected through an intrabulbar link, analogous to the specific horizontal connections linking iso-orientation columns in primary visual cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2003218106,"p130 is a member of the retinoblastoma family of pocket proteins, which includes pRB and p107. Unlike pRB and p107, p130 protein levels decrease dramatically following its hyperphosphorylation starting in the mid-G1 phase of the cell cycle. However, the mechanism leading to p130 downregulation is unknown. We have found that the proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin, inhibited p130 downregulation in T98G cells progressing through the G1/S transition and S phase and that p130 is multiubiquitylated in 293 cells. We have previously shown that ectopic expression of both cyclin D and E induces phosphorylation and downregulation of p130. Since the SKP1/Cul1/SKP2 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex mediates ubiquitylation of substrates previously phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinases, we investigated the potential role of this ubiquitin ligase in mediating p130 downregulation. We found that p130 interacts with SKP1, Cul-1 and SKP2 in human 293 cells. We also found that ectopic coexpression of SKP2 and p130 leads to dose-dependent downregulation of p130, reduces p130 protein half-life and induces p130 ubiquitylation in these cells. Moreover, adenoviral-mediated expression of SKP2 accelerates downregulation of endogenous hyperphosphorylated p130 in mitogen-stimulated T98G cells and primary WI38 fibroblasts. We conclude that p130 is a substrate of the SCF(SKP2) ubiquitin ligase and this E3 ligase regulates p130 abundance during the cell cycle."

https://openalex.org/W2032586424,"The Raf/MEK/ERK kinase cascade is pivotal in transmitting signals from membrane receptors to transcription factors that control gene expression culminating in the regulation of cell cycle progression. This cascade can prevent cell death through ERK2 and p90Rsk activation and phosphorylation of apoptotic and cell cycle regulatory proteins. The PI3K/Akt kinase cascade also controls apoptosis and can phosphorylate many apoptotic and cell cycle regulatory proteins. These pathways are interwoven as Akt can phosphorylate Raf and result in its inactivation, and Raf can be required for the antiapoptotic effects of Akt. In this study, the effects of activated Raf (Raf-1, A-Raf and B-Raf) and PI3K/Akt proteins on abrogation of cytokine dependence in FL5.12 hematopoietic cells were examined. Activated Raf, PI3K or Akt expression, by themselves, did not readily relieve cytokine dependence. The presence of activated Raf and PI3K/Akt increased the isolation of factor-independent cells from 400- to 2500-fold depending upon the particular combination examined. The individual effects of activated Raf and Akt on proliferation, apoptosis and autocrine growth factor synthesis were further examined with hormone-inducible constructs (ΔRaf-1:AR and ΔAkt:ER*(Myr+). Activation of either Raf or Akt hindered cell death; however, both proliferation and maximal synthesis of autocrine cytokines were dependent upon activation of both signaling pathways. The effects of small molecular weight inhibitors on DNA synthesis and cytokine gene expression were also examined. The PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, inhibited growth and cytokine gene expression. This effect could be synergistically increased by addition of the MEK inhibitor UO126. These cells will be useful in elucidating the interactions between Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt cascades in proliferation, apoptosis, and leukemogenesis, as well as evaluating the efficacy of signal transduction inhibitors that target these cascades."
https://openalex.org/W2057788484,"BRCA1, the gene responsible for approximately half of all cases of hereditary breast cancer and almost all cases of combined hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, has been implicated in the maintenance of genomic stability through DNA repair. This function is mediated, at least in part, through two tandem BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) repeats. The role of BRCA1 in the development of ovarian cancer is poorly understood, partially owing to the lack of ovarian cancer cell lines with defective BRCA1. The purpose of this study was to further characterize an endometrioid ovarian cancer cell line, SNU-251, which was previously reported to carry a nonsense mutation (from G to A) at amino acid 1815 of BRCA1. In addition, we examined the role of BRCA1 in the cell cycle and in the responses to the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel and ionizing radiation. Loss of the C-terminal 49 amino acids due to this point mutation did not affect the expression of the truncated BRCA1 protein, but caused a loss of transcriptional activation of the endogenous p21(WAF1/CIP1) gene, and could not sustain arrest in the G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle. The BRCA1 mutation in SNU-251 cells inhibited BRCA1 subnuclear assembly for DNA-damage repair and increased cellular sensitivity to ionizing radiation and paclitaxel. This sensitivity was reversed by reintroduction of ectopic wild-type BRCA1. Our results suggest that the deletion of the C-terminal 49 amino acids of BRCA1 results in a loss of BRCA1 function in the SNU-251 cell line. BRCA1 helps to mediate the resistance to both radiation and paclitaxel. Therefore, SNU-251 may be a useful model for studying the molecular mechanism of BRCA1 in the resistance of ovarian cancer to ionizing radiation and chemotherapy treatment and in the development of hereditary human ovarian cancer."

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7844-7848Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar, 15Thompson J.A. Itskovitz-Eldor J. Shapiro S.S. Waknitz M.A. Swiergiel J.J. Marshal V.S. Jones J.M. Science. 1998; 282: 1145-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (12479) Google Scholar). Therefore, cloning of α2,3-sialyltransferase determining synthesis of MSGb5 may contribute to understanding not only of testicular carcinogenesis and malignant progression of RCC and breast carcinoma but also of mouse embryogenesis and stem cell research. To clone the cDNA of α2,3-sialyltransferase responsible for synthesis of MSGb5, which is the first ganglioside in the globo-series ganglioside pathway (Fig. 1), we utilized a transient expression cloning system in COS-7 cells according to the procedure by Seed and Aruffo (16Seed B. Aruffo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3365-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). By means of this system combined with polymerase chain reaction targeted to sialylmotif, cDNA coding the gene that determines the expression of MSGb5 was isolated with mAb RM1, from a cDNA library of human RCC cell line ACHN. The cloned cDNA was found to be identical to ST3Gal II (17Kim Y.-J. Kim K.-S. Kim S.-H. Kim C.-H. Ko J.H. Choe I.-S. Tsuji S. Lee Y.-C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commum. 1996; 228: 324-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) in sequence. Analyses of the newly expressed gangliosides and the sialyltransferase activity in transfected cells indicate that ST3Gal II is a SSEA-4 (MSGb5) synthase. We also found that the ST3Gal II mRNA level was indeed increased in most RCC cell lines and renal tumor tissues examined. Materials—Asialo-GM1, GM1, GM2, and GD1a were purchased from Sigma. Globopentaosylceramide (Gb5), monosialosyl globopentaosylceramide (MSGb5), and GM3 were prepared from pooled renal tumor tissues as described previously (18Saito S. Levery S.B. Salyan M.E.K. Goldberg R.I. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5644-5652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells and Monoclonal Antibodies—The human RCC cell line ACHN was purchased from Dainihonseiyaku Co. (Osaka, Japan). Human RCC cell lines SMKT-R2, -R3, and -R4 were kindly provided by Dr. N. Miyao (Sapporo Medical College) (19Miyao N. Tsukamoto T. Kumamoto Y. Urol. Res. 1989; 17: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 20Ohtani N. Tsukamoto T. Kumamoto Y. Miyao N. Jpn. J. Urol. 1991; 82: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and TOS-1, -2, and -3 and 3LN were established in our laboratory (21Satoh M. Moosavi Nejad F. Nakano O. Ito A. Kawamura S. Ohyama C. Saito S. Orikasa S. Tohoku J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). COS-7 and COS-1 cells were obtained from Human Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan), and CV-1 cells were from Riken Cell Bank (Wako, Japan). Mouse IgM was purchased from Sigma. The mouse IgM anti-SSEA3 mAb (MC631) was purchased from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank at the University of Iowa. The mouse IgM anti-MSGb5 mAb RM1 (18Saito S. Levery S.B. Salyan M.E.K. Goldberg R.I. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5644-5652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was purified by ionic exchange chromatography (Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan). Goat anti-mouse IgM was purchased from Zymed Laboratories, Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Construction of cDNA Library—Double-stranded cDNAs were synthesized with oligo(dT) primers using poly(A+) RNA prepared from human ACHN cells. After addition of BstXI adapters (Invitrogen), the cDNA was size-fractionated (>0.4 kb) and ligated into expression vector pME18S, which was kindly provided by Dr. Maruyama (Tokyo Medical and Dental College). The library contained 2 × 106 independent clones in Escherichia coli strain DH10B (Invitrogen). Isolation of a Human α2,3-Sialyltransferase cDNA Clone—TLC immunostaining and fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis showed that COS-7 cells express Gb5 and the precursor of MSGb5 but not MSGb5 (Fig. 2). Eight samples of 7 × 106 COS-7 cells were transfected with 30 μg of plasmid DNA each in HEPES-buffered saline (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.05, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mm Na2HPO4, 6 mm glucose) by electroporation using a Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad) at 220 V and 975 microfarad. Three days after transfection, the exponentially growing cells were harvested, blocked with 5% fetal calf serum in PBS for 1 h, and incubated with anti-MSGb5 mAb RM1 (10 μg/ml) for 1 h. The cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in a Petri dish (Falcon 1007) coated with anti-mouse IgM goat IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Plasmid DNA was rescued from adherent cells by Hirt extraction (22Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (3352) Google Scholar) and used to transform E. coli DH10B (Invitrogen) by electroporation. Adherent cells were observed under the inverted microscope to increase from 100–200/dish after the first round of transfection and panning and about 500–1000 after the second round to ∼1 × 104 after the fifth round. After seven rounds of transfection and panning, we tried to isolate a cDNA clone that directs synthesis of MSGb5 by sibling selection but failed to identify positive transfectants. We then employed PCR with degenerate primers to detect a sialylmotif (23Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1497-1500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) that might be concentrated as the round of transfection and panning advanced. The primers were sense 5′-TGCCGSCGCTGYGTGGTBGTGGGG and the antisense 5′-GGTGGTYYKGSWSCCAACATC (S = C, G; Y = C, T; B = C, G, T; K = G, T; W = A, T). PCR was carried out with Ampli Taq Gold (Perkin-Elmer) by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1min. The PCR product was gradually concentrated as the cycles of transfection and panning advanced. The concentrated PCR product was isolated and cloned to pBluescript, and the 14 samples were sequenced. All of the samples of PCR product were identical to the sialylmotif of ST3Gal II in sequence. Then we isolated a cDNA of 2.3 kilobase pairs (named pME-Gb5ST) identical to ST3Gal II in sequence using the amplified PCR product as a probe. PCR of the β-Galactoside α2,3-Sialyltransferase cDNAs—So far the three β-galactoside α2,3-sialyltransferases including ST3Gal II have been reported (17Kim Y.-J. Kim K.-S. Kim S.-H. Kim C.-H. Ko J.H. Choe I.-S. Tsuji S. Lee Y.-C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commum. 1996; 228: 324-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 24Kitagawa H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol.

To determine which sialyltransferase was most enriched during the cycles of transfection and panning, we examined the level of the three sialyltransferase cDNA (ST3Gal I, ST3Gal II, and ST3Gal IV) by PCR in the plasmids extracted from the adherent cells every cycle of transfection and panning. The primers were sense 5′-CCCGAATTCAAGATGGTGACCCTGCGGAAG and antisense 5′-CCCTCTAGATCATCTCCCCTTGAAGATAAG for ST3Gal I, sense 5′-CCCGGATCCGGCCTGCAGCGCCTCAGCAAG and antisense 5′-CCCGGATCCGCCCCGGTGCCCGATAGATGG for ST3Gal II, and sense 5′-ATGTGTCCTGCAGGCTGGAAGCTC and antisense 5′-TCAGAAGGACGTGAGGTTCTTGAT for ST3Gal IV. PCR was carried as described above for ST3Gal I and ST3Gal IV and by 30 cycles for ST3Gal II. DNA Sequence—The cDNA was sequenced with a model 4200L-2 DNA autosequencer (LI-COR) using a Thermo Sequenase cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences) with fluorescence-labeled M13 forward and reverse primers. Construction of the Sialyltransferase Ligated into pCEP4 Vector—To examine whether the Gb5ST cDNA encodes the enzyme in RCC cell lines, the cDNA was excised from pME-Gb5ST with XhoI and subcloned into pCEP4 vector (Invitrogen), and the sense and the antisense Gb5ST cDNA ligated into pCEP4 were respectively obtained. Construction of a Soluble Form of the Sialyltransferase—A truncated form of Gb5ST, which lacks 55 amino acids from the NH2 terminus of the open reading frame, was prepared by PCR as described previously using a5′ primer containing an in-frame BamHI site and a 3′ primer located 50 bp downstream of the stop codon with BamHI site (17Kim Y.-J. Kim K.-S. Kim S.-H. Kim C.-H. Ko J.H. Choe I.-S. Tsuji S. Lee Y.-C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commum. 1996; 228: 324-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The PCR fragment was subcloned into BamHI site of the pSVL vector containing the protein A (pSVL-protA) kindly provided by Dr. J. C. Paulson (Scripps Research Institute) to yield expression plasmid pSVL-protA-Gb5ST. Expression of a Soluble Form of the Sialyltransferase and the Enzyme Activity Assay—The expression plasmid (1 μg) was transfected into COS-1 cells on a 60-mm culture dish using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen). After 48 h, the cell culture medium collected from three dishes was combined (15 ml), and 5 ml of the culture medium was concentrated by ultrafiltration using a Centricon 10 (Amicon). The remaining 10 ml of the culture medium was mixed with 100 μl of equilibrated IgG-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), followed by gentle shaking for 12 h at 4 °C. The Sepharose beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The beads were then resuspended in 200 μl of serum-free medium and used for sialyltransferase assay. A part (5 ml) of the medium after incubation with the beads was also collected and concentrated as described above. The original culture medium concentrated, the culture medium concentrated after incubation with the beads, and the beads after incubation with the original culture medium were assayed for sialyltransferase activity using glycolipids as acceptor substrate. The reaction mixture contained 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100, 50 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm 2,3-dehydro,2-deoxy-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Sigma), 10 μlof1mm CMP-[14C]NeuAc (Amersham Biosciences), 23.5 μl of the concentrated culture medium or 10 μl of the beads plus 13.5 μl of the medium, and 0.1 mm acceptor in total volume of 50 μl. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the reaction was terminated by adding 200 μl of PBS. The product was isolated by C18 Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA) and subjected to chromatography on a high performance thin layer chromatography plate (Baker) with a solvent system of chloroform, methanol, and water (50:40:10) containing 0.05% CaCl2. The radioactivity on a plate was visualized with a BAS 2000 image analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). Stable Transfection with the Sense or Antisense Gb5ST cDNA Ligated into pCEP4 —The sense or antisense Gb5ST cDNA was stably transfected into ACHN cells to examine whether the sense cDNA further increases MSGb5 level and whether the antisense cDNA down-regulates MSGb5 level. For transfection, Effectene transfection reagent was used as recommended by the supplier. Stable transfectants were selected under hygromycin (300 μg/ml). RNA Preparation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was prepared respectively from RCC cell lines, nontumor kidney tissues, and renal tumor tissues by the acid guanidium-phenol-chloroform method (26Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). 5 μg of total RNA from cell line or 15 μg of that from surgically obtained tissue was separated on 1.0% agarose-formaldehyde gel and then transferred to Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The truncated form of ST3Gal II was used as a probe. The membrane was hybridized with labeled cDNA probe at 65 °C in a solution containing 136 mm Na2HPO4, 158 mm NaH2PO4, 7% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA and then washed in 2× SSC solution containing 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. The radioactivity was visualized with a BAS 2000 image analyzer (Fuji Film). We obtained the informed consent from the patients prior to the experiments. FACS Analysis—Cells untreated or transfected with the plasmids were harvested by 0.02% EDTA in PBS, incubated with primary antibody for 90 min on ice, washed twice with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, and then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat F(ab′)2 directed to mouse IgG and IgM (Tago, Burlingame, CA) for 45 min on ice. After washing twice, the cells resuspended in PBS were subjected to FACS analysis. Isolation and Analysis of Gangliosides from Cells—Purification of gangliosides and TLC immunostaining were performed as described before (18Saito S. Levery S.B. Salyan M.E.K. Goldberg R.I. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5644-5652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular Cloning of a MSGb5 (SSEA-4) Synthase—In the expression cloning of sialyltransferase, the host cells that express acceptor, but no or little if any sialyl-acceptor (product) and a ligand highly specific for the product are required. COS-7 cells were positively stained by anti-SSEA-3 mAb but not by RM1 (anti-MSGb5 mAb) as demonstrated in Fig. 2. Therefore, we used COS-7 cells as a recipient host for the expression cloning of MSGb5 synthase and mAb RM1 as a specific ligand for the product (MSGb5). We identified a cDNA directing MSGb5 synthesis with combination of PCR using degenerate primers targeted to sialylmotif. The PCR product was gradually concentrated as the cycles of transfection and panning advanced (Fig. 3a). Using the amplified PCR product as a probe, a cDNA of 2.3 kilobase pairs (named pME-Gb5ST) identical to ST3Gal II in nucleotide sequence was obtained. Because so far the three β-galactoside α2,3-sialyltransferases (ST3Gal I, ST3Gal II, and ST3Gal IV) have been cloned, we examined which sialyltransferase cDNA was concentrated after each round of transfection and panning. Although the PCR product of ST3Gal II was concentrated, those of ST3Gal I and ST3Gal IV were rather lost after repeating the procedures of transfection and panning (Fig. 3b). Expression of MSGb5 Synthase cDNA—To investigate whether the cloned cDNA directs MSGb5 expression, the expression plasmids pME-Gb5ST and pCEP4-Gb5ST were transiently transfected into COS-7 and ACHN cells, respectively. Because COS-7 cells were found to have high sialidase activity, COS-7 cells transiently transfected by pME-Gb5ST were cultured with sialidase inhibitor, 2,3-dehydro,2-deoxy-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Sigma) (200 μm). The culture medium with the inhibitor was changed every 24 h before FACS analysis. After 48 h the cells were harvested, incubated with RM1, and subjected to FACS analysis. With sialidase inhibitor, COS-7 cells transfected with Gb5ST cDNA showed a significant increase of MSGb5 compared with those transfected with vector (Fig. 4), which was reproducible in four experiments even though the difference was not remarkable (10–14%). On the other hand, the increase of MSGb5 was only 2–5% for COS-7 cells without sialidase inhibitor and ∼7% for ACHN cells compared with those transfected with vector (data not shown). To confirm that the cDNA clone encodes MSGb5 synthase, we constructed a soluble recombinant form of the enzyme. As shown in Fig. 5 (a and b), the concentrated cell culture medium from COS-1 cells transiently transfected with the plasmid (pSVL-protA-Gb5ST) showed the transfer activity of [14C]NeuAc to Gb5, asialo-GM1, and GM1a, but no radioactivity was detected toward the other glycolipids. To further verify that the sialyltransferase activity toward Gb5 was derived from pSVL-protA-Gb5ST, the culture medium after incubation with IgG-Sepharose beads and the beads after incubation with the original culture medium were used for sialyltransferase assay. Sialyltransferase activity was only detected for the fractions adsorbed to the beads but not in the nonadsorbed factions (the culture medium after incubation with the beads) (Fig. 5c). In this experiment, less than 40% of the total activity in the culture medium was recovered in the adsorbed fractions, the low recovery being probably due to partial inhibition of the reactions by the beads themselves. These data indicate that the secreted proteins encoded by the cDNA directly catalyze MSGb5 formation. The antisense Gb5ST cDNA ligated into pCEP4 was then stably transfected into ACHN cells to confirm whether the antisense cDNA down-regulates the MSGb5 level. FACS analysis showed that expression of MSGb5 was suppressed in the stable transfectants with the antisense cDNA (Fig. 6a). To further confirm that the level of MSGb5 was decreased, TLC analysis was carried out. Total glycolipids corresponding to the same wet weight (10 mg) from the stable transfectants were subjected to chromatography on the TLC plate and stained by orcinol sulfuric acid. MSGb5 level from each transfectant was determined by comparing with standard MSGb5, the concentration of which was calculated in advance. The densitometric analysis were performed using Scion image (Scion Co.), and the values were normalized to Gb5 showing almost the same level in all the transfectants. The assessed amounts of MSGb5 from the stable transfectants were 71 (vector), 48 (AS-Gb5ST-1), and 52 (AS-Gb5ST-2) pmol/total glycolipid from 10 mg of cell pellets, respectively. (Fig. 6b). Thus, TLC confirmed the significant decrease in MSGb5 synthesis by the antisense cDNA. Unexpectedly, precursor (Gb5) accumulation was not observed with the antisense cDNA compared with vector (Fig. 6b). In an attempt to further increase MSGb5 level in ACHN cells, stable transfection with the sense cDNA was performed. However, isolation of stable transfectants with the sense cDNA has not been successful because of reduced viabilities. ST3Gal II Level in RCC Cell Lines and Renal Tumor Tissues—To examine whether the sialyltransferase is involved in renal carcinogenesis, we analyzed the levels of ST3Gal II mRNA along with those of MSGb5 in human RCC cell lines. A high level of ST3Gal II mRNA was detected in all human RCC cell lines except SMKT-R2, although levels of ST3Gal II mRNA were not necessarily consistent with those of MSGb5 (Fig. 7). When the ST3Gal II mRNA level was examined in nontumor kidney and renal tumor tissues, the level was higher in all six cases of RCC than nontumor kidney tissues (Fig. 8).Fig. 8Increased level of ST3Gal II mRNA in human RCC cases. Northern blotting of ST3Gal II mRNA was conducted in human RCC tissues. N, nontumor kidney; T, primary renal tumor. Each pair of N and T is from the same case.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The present study described the isolation of a cDNA clone directing synthesis of MSGb5 (SSEA-4), which was found to be identical to ST3Gal II. Although COS-7 cells which express Gb5 but not MSGb5 seemed to be an appropriate recipient cells, we failed to isolate a MSGb5 synthase gene by the conventional expression cloning and sibling selection method. The major problem may be due to high sialidase activity in COS-7 cells that may reduce the amount of the product (MSGb5). Nevertheless, the gradual increase of cells (COS-7 cells expressing SSEA-4) adherent to the Petri dish was observed under the microscope during the expression cloning procedure, and therefore we attempted to isolate a positive clone by utilizing the adherent cells. For this purpose we used the information of the sialylmotif (23Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1497-1500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) with the expectation that if a sialyltransferase cDNA directs synthesis of MSGb5, enrichment of this cDNA should be observed as the round advances. With degenerate primers, we found that only a sialylmotif identical to that of ST3Gal II was concentrated but not the other types of β-galactoside α2,3-sialyltransferase. In confirmation of the clone directing MSGb5 synthesis, we transfected the cDNA into COS-7 cells and ACHN cells. Only a slight increase of MSGb5 was observed in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the ST3Gal II cDNA, but the addition of a sialidase inhibitor resulted in a significant increase (10–14%) of MSGb5. Detection of a higher amount of the product with the inhibitor is probably due to protection from degradation. We do not know at present why transfection of the sense cDNA in COS-7 cells led to a smaller amount of MSGb5 synthesis than expected even with a sialidase inhibitor. However, these results indicate that in addition to the specific antibody RM1, the sialylmotif was a powerful tool to identify the clone with a slight increase of MSGb5 expression. On the other hand, the MSGb5 level was suppressed in the stable transfectants with the antisense Gb5ST cDNA in RCC cell line ACHN. Unexpectedly, anticipated accumulation of Gb5 was not observed in these stable transfectants compared with that with vector. A possible mechanism for this result may be due to physiological importance to maintain Gb5 under a certain level in ACHN cells. Transfection of the soluble recombinant form of ST3Gal II demonstrated the sialyltransferase activity toward Gb5, asialo-GM1, and GM1a in the culture medium. Concentration of the activity with IgG-Sepharose beads indicates that it is derived from soluble recombinant form of ST3Gal II (pSVL-protA-Gb5ST). Thus, the results of our study shows that ST3Gal II has a role of catalyzing transfer of sialic acid to Galβ1,3GalNAc epitope of Gb5 in addition to that of asialo-GM1 and GM1a (17Kim Y.-J. Kim K.-S. Kim S.-H. Kim C.-H. Ko J.H. Choe I.-S. Tsuji S. Lee Y.-C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commum. 1996; 228: 324-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), which suggests that the different glycolipid series, i.e. globo- and ganglio-series, could be sialylated by the same enzyme. Recently α2,3-sialylation of GalNAcβ1,3Gal determinant by ST3Gal II was demonstrated (28Toivonen S. Aitio O. Renkonen O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37141-37148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), indicating that ST3Gal II is a multifunctional enzyme. The fact that levels of ST3Gal II mRNA are not necessarily consistent with those of MSGb5 in RCC cell lines may also suggest that the enzyme plays the other roles. The level of ST3Gal II mRNA was not necessarily consistent with that of MSGb5 in each RCC cell line. This may also mean that not only sialyltransferase but also the other glycosyltransferases involved in synthesis of globo-series glycolipid (29Kojima Y. Fukumoto S. Furukawa K. Okajima T. Wiels J.

Berger E.G. Hennet T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22631-22634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) or sialidases determine the level of MSGb5. Interestingly all but one of the RCC cell lines examined possessed a high level of ST3Gal II mRNA. Moreover, the levels of ST3Gal II mRNA were higher in all six cases of human RCC tissues than nontumor kidney tissues, which possessed little if any ST3Gal II mRNA. Along with the fact that ST3Gal II mRNA level was very low in normal kidney (17Kim Y.-J. Kim K.-S. Kim S.-H. Kim C.-H. Ko J.H. Choe I.-S. Tsuji S. Lee Y.-C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commum. 1996; 228: 324-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), an increased level of this sialyltransferase mRNA may be related to carcinogenesis of the kidney, although further studies on many cases are necessary. However, surgically obtained renal tissues could not exhibit the exact levels of mRNA, because the time from ligation of renal artery to extirpation usually requires 1 to 2 h or more in radical nephrectomy, and thus mRNAs in renal tissues surgically obtained might be degradated. We have to take this possibility into consideration in analyzing the mRNA level in human materials. We previously demonstrated that the higher gangliosides are related to the metastatic potential of human RCC (11Saito S. Orikasa S. Ohyama C. Satoh M. Fukushi Y. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 49: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 12Saito S. Orikasa S. Satoh M. Ohyama C. Ito A. Takahashi T. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1997; 88: 562-569Google Scholar, 18Saito S.

In this regard decreased motility of ACHN cells stably transfected with pCEP4 antisense Gb5ST was observed compared with those stably transfected with pCEP4 only, 2H. Aoki, S. Saito, A. Ito, K. Mitsuzuka, M. Satoh, and Y. Arai, unpublished results. consistent with the findings by Steelant et al. (13Steelant W.F. Kawakami Y. Ito A. Handa K. Bruyneel E.A. Mareel M. Hakomori S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, increased levels of ST3Gal II mRNA may be involved not only in carcinogenesis of kidney but also in the malignant progression of human RCC. This may indicate that at the time of carcinogenesis, as suggested by increased level of ST3Gal II mRNA, renal carcinoma cells may be ready for the next malignant progression. Studies on the levels of ST3Gal II mRNA in many cases of RCC and on the roles of the enzyme will further shed light on the nature of carcinogenesis as well as the malignant potential of RCC. So far there has been only a study on sialyltransferase in human RCC (32Saito S. Yamashita S. Endoh M. Yamato T. Hoshi S. Ohyama C. Watanabe R. Ito A. Satoh M. Wada T. Paulson J.C. Arai Y. Miyagi T. Oncol. Rep. 2002; 9: 1251-1255PubMed Google Scholar). Down-regulation of ST3Gal IV mRNA was associated with the malignant progression of RCC, and the cases with high level of ST3Gal IV mRNA showed a favorable prognosis (32Saito S. Yamashita S. Endoh M. Yamato T. Hoshi S. Ohyama C. Watanabe R. Ito A. Satoh M. Wada T. Paulson J.C. Arai Y. Miyagi T. Oncol. Rep. 2002; 9: 1251-1255PubMed Google Scholar). In this context, the expression level of ST3Gal II mRNA is likely in inverse relation with that of ST3Gal IV mRNA in human RCC. Because regulated expression of sialyltransferases was observed in human normal tissues (24Kitagawa H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17872-17878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), regulation mechanisms of sialyltransferase expression were assumed to be involved in carcinogenesis. Elucidation of the mechanisms may be essential to understand the nature of the malignant progression. The monoclonal antibody MC631 developed by D. Solter and B. B. Knowles was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank developed under the auspices of the NICHD, National Institutes of Health and maintained by the University of Iowa Department of Biological Sciences (Iowa City, IA)."
https://openalex.org/W2127406085,"The annotated sequence of chromosome 2 of Plasmodium falciparum was examined for genes encoding proteins that may be of interest for vaccine development. We describe here the characterization of a protein with an altered thrombospondin Type I repeat domain (PfSPATR) that is expressed in the sporozoite, asexual, and sexual erythrocytic stages of the parasite life cycle. Immunoelectron microscopy indicated that this protein was expressed on the surface of the sporozoites and around the rhoptries in the asexual erythrocytic stage. An Escherichia coli-produced recombinant form of the protein bound to HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner and antibodies raised against this protein blocked the invasion of sporozoites into a transformed hepatoma cell line. Sera from Ghanaian adults and from a volunteer who had been immunized with radiation-attenuated P. falciparum sporozoites specifically recognized the expression of this protein on transfected COS-7 cells. These data support the evaluation of this protein as a vaccine candidate. The annotated sequence of chromosome 2 of Plasmodium falciparum was examined for genes encoding proteins that may be of interest for vaccine development.

Subramanian G.M. Collins F.H. Venter J.C. Nature. 2002; 415: 702-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Chromosome 2 was the first chromosome of P. falciparum to be sequenced, and initial analysis indicated that there were 209 genes on this chromosome (9Gardner M.J. Tettelin H. Carucci D.J.

In an effort to discover additional protein candidates for vaccine development, we sought to characterize one of the genes from chromosome 2 of P. falciparum, which had been annotated as a putative secreted protein containing a thrombospondin Type I repeat (TSR) 1The abbreviations used are: TSR, thrombospondin Type I repeat; PfCSP, Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein; PfSPATR, Plasmodium falciparum-secreted protein with altered thrombospondin repeat; EGF, epidermal growth factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase. domain (9Gardner M.J.

In addition to a TSR domain, we found that the predicted protein also possessed a cysteine-rich signature that could represent a Type II EGF-like domain. The orthologue of this protein is present in the murine malaria parasite Plasmodium yoelii and named “secreted protein with altered thrombospondin repeat” or SPATR (20Kappe S.H. Gardner M.J. Brown S.M. Ross J. Matuschewski K. Ribeiro J.M. Adams J.H. Quackenbush J. Cho J. Carucci D.J. Hoffman S.L. Nussenzweig V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We report that this protein is expressed at several stages of the life cycle, that it binds to hepatoma cells, and that antibodies to this protein inhibit P. falciparum sporozoite invasion of liver cells. Reverse Transcription-PCR and Cloning—Total RNA was isolated from P. falciparum sporozoites, synchronized erythrocytic stages (ring, trophozoite, and schizont), and gametocytes using a High Pure RNA Isolation Kit (Roche Diagnostics). 2 μg of RNA from each of these stages was reverse transcribed using random hexamers and Superscript II RNase H– reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). 5 μl of the reverse transcribed product of each of the above stages was subjected to PCR using PfSPATR-specific primers. Primer design was based on the published sequence with GenBank™ accession number AE001404 (9Gardner M.J. Tettelin H. Carucci D.J. Cummings L.M. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Shallom S. Mason T. Yu K.

Science. 1998; 282: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amplified products were cloned into TA Cloning vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification—For protein expression, a 690-bp cDNA encoding the mature form of PfSPATR (without signal sequence) was cloned as a BamHI and EcoRI fragment into pGEX-3X (Amersham Biosciences), a GST-based Escherichia coli expression vector. The recombinant protein was expressed in BL21 Escherichia coli cells, and the expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The protein was purified on a glutathione-agarose column as per the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Generation of Anti-PfSPATR Serum in Mice—Outbred CD-1 mice were immunized intraperitoneally with 10 μg of the purified protein in Freund's complete adjuvant and boosted 3 and 6 weeks after the first immunization with 10 μg of protein in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Sera were collected 12 days after the third dose. Anti-GST antibodies were depleted by passing the sera through an immobilized GST column (Pierce), which was confirmed by Western blot. Immunofluorescence Assay—Spots of P. falciparum sporozoites and smears of erythrocytic stages and gametocytes were made on glass slides. Anti-PfSPATR serum at 1:20 to 1:6400 dilutions were added and incubated in a moist chamber at 37 °C. After 1 h, unbound material was removed by washing, and anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate was added. Unbound conjugate was removed, and the slides were observed under UV light in a fluorescence microscope. Pre-immune mice sera were used as controls. Immunoelectron Microscopy—Immunoelectron microscopy was carried out on sporozoites isolated from infected mosquito salivary glands and in vitro cultured blood stages of P. falciparum (Clone 3D7) using 1:40 anti-PfSPATR antiserum as described (21Nguyen T.V. Fujioka H. Kang A.S. Rogers W.O. Fidock D.A. James A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26724-26731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Pre-immune sera were used as control. Expression of PfSPATR on COS-7 Cells—DNA encoding the full-length open reading frame of PfSPATR was cloned in plasmid pRE4 (22Cohen G.H. Wilcox W.C. Sodora D.L. Long D. Levin J.Z. Eisenberg R.J. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1932-1940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a mammalian expression vector, and the endotoxin-free plasmid was transfected into COS-7 cells using Lipofectin. Expression of PfSPATR was evaluated by immunofluorescence using murine anti-PfSPATR antibodies and human serum samples obtained from 1) naturally immune adult, lifelong residents of P. falciparum hyperendemic area in Ghana, 2) malaria-naive volunteers immunized with irradiated P. falciparum sporozoites, and 3) their controls exposed to the bite of uninfected mosquitoes (23Hoffman S.L. Goh L.M. Luke T.C. Schneider I. Le T.P. Doolan D.L. Sacci J. de la Vega P. Dowler M. Paul C. Gordon D.M. Stoute J.A. Church L.W. Sedegah M. Heppner D.G. Ballou W.R. Richie T.L. J. Infect. Dis. 2002; 185: 1155-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). All sera were used at dilutions ranging from 1:50 to 1:400. The use of human serum samples for this experiment was approved by the institutional review board at the Naval Medical Research Center. Cell Binding Assay—The hepatoma cell line HepG2 was used to evaluate the binding activity of PfSPATR. Cells were seeded in a 96-well plate a day before the start of the experiment. The next day the recombinant proteins, 0 to 1.00 μm, were added to the paraformaldehyde-fixed cells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Unbound material was removed followed by the addition of murine anti-protein antibodies. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody was added, and the bound protein was measured by a fluorescence-based assay using 4-methyllumbelliferyl phosphate as substrate (24Rathore D. McCutchan T.F. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In Vitro Inhibition of Sporozoite Invasion (ISI) in HepG2 Cells—The ISI assay was performed as described (19Rathore D. Sacci J.B. de la Vega P. McCutchan T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7092-7098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50,000 HepG2 cells were placed in each of the eight wells of tissue culture slides 2 days before the experiment. P. falciparum (NF54) sporozoites were isolated from mosquito salivary glands using a discontinuous gradient as described (25Pacheco N.D. Strome C.P. Mitchell F. Bawden M.P. Beaudoin R.L. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). 20,000 sporozoites were added to the cells along with anti-PfSPATR serum at a final dilution of 1:50 in the presence (20 or 10 μg/ml) or absence of PfSPATR protein. Anti-P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) monoclonal antibody, NFS1, at a concentration of 10 μg/ml was added as a positive control (NFS1 monoclonal antibody was diluted 1:600 to achieve this concentration). After a 3-h incubation at 37 °C, the numbers of sporozoites that had invaded the hepatoma cells were counted. Percent inhibition was calculated by the following formula: [(mean number of invaded sporozoites in negative controls) – (mean number of invaded sporozoites in test) / (mean number of invaded sporozoites in negative controls)] × 100. Selection, Cloning, and Expression of PfSPATR—Analysis of the published DNA sequence of chromosome 2 of P. falciparum identified a 1069-nucleotide sequence containing a two-exon gene encoding a 250-amino acid long putative secreted protein with an altered TSR domain (Fig. 1). Application of reverse transcriptase-PCR to assess its expression in sporozoites, infected erythrocytes (rings, trophozoites, schizonts, and gametocytes) revealed that the gene is transcribed in all the evaluated stages of the parasite life cycle (Fig. 2). The amplified fragment was 753 bp in length, and sequencing of the cDNA confirmed that the correct mRNA had been amplified (data not shown). To obtain recombinant PfSPATR protein, a 690-bp cDNA fragment encoding the mature protein was cloned in plasmid pGEX-3X, a GST-based E. coli expression vector. The construct was expressed in BL21 cells and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Although the coding sequence had a high AT content, a characteristic feature of P. falciparum genes, we could detect the expression of the fusion protein on a Coomassie Blue-stained polyacrylamide gel (data not shown). The fusion protein was purified to homogeneity on a glutathione-agarose column (data not shown). Purified protein was used to immunize outbred CD-1 mice, and anti-PfSPATR serum was obtained.Fig. 2Transcription of PfSPATR gene at different stages of the P. falciparum life cycle. The reaction was performed in the absence (–RT) and presence (+RT) of reverse transcriptase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Localization of PfSPATR Protein in Different Parasite Stages—To determine whether the transcribed mRNA was associated with protein expression, we evaluated the cellular expression and localization of PfSPATR at different stages of the parasite life cycle. Immunofluorescence assays using anti-PfSPATR antibodies produced in mice demonstrated binding in all of the evaluated stages, viz. sporozoites, asexual erythrocytic stages, and gametocytes, suggesting that the protein is expressed in several stages of parasite life cycle (Fig. 3). The strongest reactivity was observed against sporozoites where the protein was detectable even at dilutions of 1:6400 of the antiserum. Sporozoites and asexual erythrocytic stages were further evaluated by immunoelectron microscopy to determine the specific location of PfSPATR. In longitudinal and cross-sections, PfSPATR was localized on the surface of sporozoites and was not detected in the intracellular organelles such as micronemes (Fig. 4, A and B). In asexual erythrocytic stages, PfSPATR was detectable around the rhoptries and to a lesser extent on the infected erythrocyte membrane (Fig. 4C). Western blot using anti-PfSPATR antiserum on sporozoite and blood-stage parasite lysates detected PfSPATR protein at its expected size of ∼30 kDa (data not shown).Fig. 4Localization of PfSPATR in P. falciparum by immunoelectron microscopy.

Employing a plasmid expressing PfSPATR to transiently transfect COS-7 cells, it was found that the protein was expressed on the surface of the cells and was readily recognized by the anti-PfSPATR serum (Fig. 5A) but not by the pre-immune serum (Fig. 5B). Sera from a malaria-naive volunteer who had been immunized with radiation-attenuated P. falciparum sporozoites (Fig. 5C) and five clinically immune adults (Fig. 5, E–I) from a region of Ghana with intense P. falciparum-malaria transmission recognized the PfSPATR expressed on COS-7 cells. However, serum from a volunteer who was also immunized with irradiated sporozoites but had low anti-sporozoite antibodies (Fig. 5D) as characterized by immunofluorescence assay and sera from two nonimmune adults (Fig. 5, J and K) did not recognize PfSPATR expression. Biological Function of PfSPATR—As PfSPATR showed strong surface localization on sporozoites, we investigated its possible involvement in cell-cell interaction by evaluating its potential for binding to the human hepatocyte cell line, HepG2. The protein demonstrated potent binding to HepG2 cells that was dose-dependent (Fig. 6) and comparable with that of Pf-CSP. In contrast, serum albumin used as a negative control showed no binding (data not shown). This result suggested that PfSPATR could function as another parasite ligand involved in the interaction of sporozoites with liver cells and that a receptor for PfSPATR was present on HepG2 cells. In Vitro Inhibition of Sporozoite Invasion—As PfSPATR efficiently bound HepG2 cells, we investigated the ability of antibodies against PfSPATR to prevent sporozoite invasion of human liver cells. Anti-PfSPATR serum at a final dilution of 1:50 inhibited sporozoite invasion by more than 80%. Nonimmune control serum showed no inhibition suggesting that the inhibitory property of anti-PfSPATR serum was specific. The inhibitory activity was comparable with that of an anti-PfCSP monoclonal antibody that prevented invasion by more than 90% at 10 μg/ml. This invasion inhibition was antigen-specific as shown by the addition of free recombinant protein in the assay, which completely reversed the inhibition (Fig. 7). We investigated a protein of P. falciparum that is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 2 of the parasite (9Gardner M.J. Tettelin H. Carucci D.J. Cummings L.M. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Shallom S. Mason T. Yu K. Fujii C. Pederson J. Shen K. Jing J. Aston C. Lai Z. Schwartz D.C. Pertea M. Salzberg S. Zhou L. Sutton G.G. Clayton R. White O. Smith H.O. Fraser C.M. Adams M.D. Venter J.C. Hoffman S.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on protein sequence homology, the protein had been suggested to possess an altered TSR domain toward the carboxyl terminus (20Kappe S.H. Gardner M.J. Brown S.M. Ross J. Matuschewski K. Ribeiro J.M. Adams J.H. Quackenbush J. Cho J. Carucci D.J. Hoffman S.L. Nussenzweig V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9895-9900Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The central motif present in most TSR-family proteins is WSXW (where “X” can be any amino acid) followed by CSXTCG (26Lawler J. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1635-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). As the CSXTCG motif is absent in the SPATR sequence, it has been referred to as an “altered thrombospondin domain” (20Kappe S.H. Gardner M.J. Brown S.M. Ross J. Matuschewski K. Ribeiro J.M. Adams J.H. Quackenbush J. Cho J. Carucci D.J. Hoffman S.L. Nussenzweig V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9895-9900Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In Plasmodium, TSR-containing genes show synteny linkage conservation between different species (27Carlton J.M. Vinkenoog R. Waters A.P. Walliker D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 93: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Along with the altered TSR domain, the protein has a 15-amino acid region (72NSRNCWCPRGYILCS86) that has characteristics suggestive of a Type II EGF-like signature sequence. The BLOCKS protein domain data base and search tool (www.blocks.fhcrc.org) that predicted this characteristic indicated that the PfSPATR sequence was not typical of the Type II EGF signature sequence found in a diverse range of proteins (28Henikoff S. Henikoff J.G. Genomics. 1994; 19: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Interestingly, no other protein domain data base and search tool predicted this Type II EGF-like signature. Although the precise roles of the TSR and potential EGF domains are as yet unclear, these domains are located in the extracellular region of membrane-bound proteins or in proteins known to be secreted (29Davis C.G. New Biol. 1990; 2: 410-419PubMed Google Scholar). Although TSR (13Ozaki L.S. Svec P. Nussenzweig R.S. Nussenzweig V. Godson G.N.

We found that the PfSPATR gene is transcribed during the sporozoite and the major erythrocytic stages of the parasite life cycle (Fig. 2). Sporozoites for our studies were produced in mosquitoes, and the erythrocytic stage parasites were produced in cultures of erythrocytes, so there could not have been any cross-contamination. The expressed sequence matched perfectly with the predicted gene structure of the protein, which also verified the predicted exon-intron boundaries of the gene (Fig. 1). Only a few Plasmodium proteins have been reported to be expressed during multiple stages of the parasite life cycle (33Florens L. Washburn M.P. Raine J.D. Anthony R.M. Grainger M. Haynes J.D. Moch J.K. Muster N. Sacci J.B. Tabb D.L. Witney A.A. Wolters D. Wu Y. Gardner M.J. Holder A.A. Sinden R.E. Yates J.R. Carucci D.J. Nature. 2002; 419: 520-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). We evaluated the cellular expression of PfSPATR by immunofluorescence assay and by immunoelectron microscopy and found that the protein is present in the sporozoite, asexual erythrocytic, and gametocyte stages of the life cycle (Figs. 3 and 4). In sporozoites it was exclusively located on the surface, whereas in asexual blood stages it was present around the rhoptries of merozoites and on the membrane of infected erythrocytes (Fig. 4). The presence of this protein on the surface of the parasite in different stages led us to investigate whether this protein was recognized by the host immune system in P. falciparum-infected individuals. The PfSPATR protein that was expressed on the cell surface of transfected COS-7 cells was recognized by sera from naturally infected clinically immune adult Africans, indicating that this protein was recognized by the host immune system (Fig. 5). The fact that the serum from an individual immunized with irradiated sporozoites recognized the protein corroborates the expression and immunogenicity of the protein during the early pre-erythrocytic stage of the parasite infection in humans. Serum from a volunteer with low levels of anti-sporozoite antibodies and control sera from two nonimmune donors did not recognize PfS-PATR expression on COS-7 cells indicating that this reaction was specific. The expression of PfSPATR protein on the sporozoite surface and its recognition by the host immune system in infected individuals led us to investigate its biological role in the parasite life cycle. Other known Plasmodium antigens with similar properties have been shown to be involved in cell-cell interactions (16Cerami C. Frevert U. Sinnis P. Takacs B. Clavijo P. Santos M.J. Nussenzweig V.

We hypothesized a role for this protein in the binding of sporozoites to liver cells, a property known to be associated with other sporozoite proteins possessing a TSR domain. PfSPATR bound to human liver cells, and its binding was comparable with that of PfCSP, the predominant sporozoite surface protein (Fig. 6). The binding of PfSPATR appeared to be specific and is presumed to be involved in the sporozoite invasion of liver cells as evidenced by inhibition of invasion by anti-PfSPATR antibodies and reversal of inhibition by the addition of recombinant PfSPATR protein (Fig. 7). It will be interesting to determine whether there are anti-PfSPATR antibodies that block the invasion-inhibiting activity of anti-PfSPATR antibodies as has been demonstrated for MSP-19 (34Guevara Patino J.A. Holder A.A. McBride J.S. Blackman M.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1689-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The presence of antibodies that partially inhibit the sporozoite invasion of hepatocytes does not indicate that an individual will be protected against P. falciparum infection. If a mosquito injects 20 sporozoites and 19 of them are inhibited from invading hepatocytes by antibodies to PfSPATR or against any other sporozoite protein, the subject will not be protected against developing P. falciparum infection, because within 1 week a single successfully invaded sporozoite can give rise to 10,000 merozoites each of which can invade erythrocytes. Immunization of volunteers with a number of PfCSP-recombinant protein vaccines has elicited antibodies to sporozoites that successfully inhibit sporozoite invasion of hepatoma cells in vitro but fail to protect the volunteers against challenge (35Hoffman S.L. Edelman R. Bryan J.P. Schneider I. Davis J. Sedegah M. Gordon D. Church P. Gross M. Silverman C. Hollingdale M. Clyde D. Sztein M. Losonsky G. Paparello S. Jones T.R. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1994; 51: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, we know from passive transfer studies in mice and monkeys (36Charoenvit Y. Mellouk S. Cole C. Bechara R. Leef M.F. Sedegah M. Yuan L.F. Robey F.A. Beaudoin R.L. Hoffman S.L. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1020-1025PubMed Google Scholar) that antibodies against sporozoites can completely protect against sporozoite challenge. In those cases, the invasion-inhibitory activity was generally >95%. We are currently investigating the potential of anti-SPATR antibodies to protect against infection in the P. yoelii rodent malaria model. The SPATR protein is present in multiple Plasmodium species. It is present in the transcriptome of P. yoelii sporozoites (20Kappe S.H. Gardner M.J. Brown S.M. Ross J. Matuschewski K. Ribeiro J.M. Adams J.H. Quackenbush J. Cho J. Carucci D.J. Hoffman S.L. Nussenzweig V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9895-9900Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and we have also identified its orthologue in Plasmodium knowlesi and Plasmodium vivax species. 2R. Chattopadhyay, unpublished results. The presence of this protein in human, simian, and rodent malaria parasite species suggests that the protein plays an important role in the biology of the parasite. Numerous efforts are currently under way to develop an effective vaccine against malaria (37Richie T.L. Saul A. Nature. 2002; 415: 694-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The complex life cycle of the parasite with distinct sets of antigens expressed during various stages of development has made vaccine design and development a major challenge to malaria researchers. We have described herein a molecule that holds potential for investigation as a malaria vaccine candidate. Its multistage expression by sporozoites, asexual erythrocytic forms, and gametocytes, along with its possible role in liver cell invasion, suggests that PfSPATR could be a valuable new vaccine component.

https://openalex.org/W2085714974,"Bfl-1 is an antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member and a mouse A1 homologue. The mouse A1 has been reported to have three isoforms, but little is known about human Bfl-1. By reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis, we have identified Bfl-1S (short form), an alternative splice variant of Bfl-1. The Bfl-1S primary sequence contains four conserved Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains and a positive-charged C-terminus containing KKRK amino acids. The expression of Bfl-1S mRNA was detected predominantly in normal lymph nodes and in B-lymphoid leukemia cells. Confocal microscopic analysis using green fluorescence protein fusion proteins demonstrated that Bfl-1S is localized in the nucleus by its C-terminus as an intrinsic nuclear localization sequence. Bfl-1S acts as an antiapoptotic agent in coexpression experiments with Bax, a proapoptotic molecule. The expression of Bfl-1S provided significant resistance against staurosporine (STS) treatments in Molt-4 human T-leukemia cells. Bfl-1S also significantly inhibited the cleavage of Bid, and of caspases 3 and 8 against STS treatment. These results indicate that Bfl-1S is a novel human Bcl-2 family member that possesses antiapoptotic function."

Early in vivo studies and more recent CGH analyses have revealed amplification of chromosome 5p in advanced stage carcinoma of the uterine cervix (CaCx). In the present study, a panel of established CaCx-derived cell lines were analysed by M-FISH to identify recurrent karyotypic abnormalities. Amplification of 5p was observed in 11 of 13 CaCx cell lines harbouring HR (high-risk) HPV. The region of 5p undergoing amplification was confirmed using human band-specific paints. The F-box protein Skp2 is present at 5p13 and its protein is present at increased levels in many cancers of an advanced stage. The HPV16-harbouring cell line W12 shows progressive morphological abnormality with in vitro passage, culminating in an invasive phenotype. The expression of Skp2 at different stages of this progression was investigated utilizing Western blot and TaqMan quantitative PCR. At medium to late passage, gain of 5p as an isochromosome was observed. Increased expression of Skp2 and a reduction in the expression of its target p27 correlated with increasing passage in this line."
https://openalex.org/W2044917486,"Sequence analysis of the noncoding first exon (exon 1) of the Syk gene demonstrated the presence of a previously cloned CpG island (GenBank #Z 65706). Transient transfection analysis in Daudi cells demonstrated promoter activity (18-fold increase over parental luciferase plasmid) for a 348 bp BstXI–BsrBI fragment containing this island. This region exhibits a high GC content (∼75%), contains several SP1 binding sites and a potential initiator sequence, but lacks a strong TATA consensus. Bisulfite sequencing and methylation-specific PCR (MSP) of this region demonstrated that the Syk promoter CpG island was largely unmethylated in B-lineage leukemia cell lines, control peripheral blood cells, human thymocytes and CD3+ T lymphocytes. However, dense methylation was seen in four T-lineage leukemia cell lines, Jurkat, H9, Molt 3 and HUT 78. MSP screening of leukemia cells from six T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients demonstrated methylation of the Syk promoter CpG island in one T-lineage ALL patient. Promoter methylation was correlated with reduced to absent expression of Syk mRNA and SYK protein in the T-lineage leukemia cell lines. Treatment of the leukemia lines Ha and Molt 3, with the methylation inhibitor, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR) resulted in increased Syk mRNA expression. The presence of a methylated promoter sequence in these T-lineage leukemia cell lines and in one T-lineage patient suggests a potential role for SYK as a tumor suppressor in T-ALL."
https://openalex.org/W1982007931,"Activated telomerase is frequently detected in cancer cells and is able to maintain and stabilize the integrity of telomeres; it also contributes to unlimited divisions in cancer cells. Recently, a new generation of selective anticancer strategies is under development targeting the blockage of telomerase activity either at the protein level or telomerase RNA. Here, we report suppression of the malignant phenotype by the expression of the full-length antisense human telomerase RNA (hTR) delivered by a novel hybrid vector recombining adenovirus and adeno-associated virus (vAd-AAV). The hybrid vector vAd-AAV retained the unique traits from two parental viruses, such as high efficiency of gene transfer in mammalian cells and the ability to integrate into the genomic DNA of host cells. The stable expression of antisense hTR in MCF-7 cells significantly suppressed telomerase activity and progressively shortened telomere length for 30 population doublings (PD30). Expression of antisense hTR leads to a telomere-based growth arrest and the induction of spontaneous apoptosis. Antisense hTR decreased soft agar colony formation and reduced the cell proliferation, leading to exit from the cell cycle at G1 at PD15. The expression of antisense hTR also sensitized MCF-7 cells to apoptosis induced by sodium butyrate or serum starvation. Our study demonstrates that delivering antisense hTR by the hybrid Ad/AAV vector is an effective antineoplastic gene therapeutic strategy, which significantly suppresses the malignant phenotype and enhances apoptosis of human breast cancer cells."

https://openalex.org/W2090029689,"Previous studies have shown that the viral Jun (v-Jun) oncoprotein induces marked alterations in cell cycle control, which are associated with, and may be caused by, increased cdk2 kinase activity. Since p21 CIP1 is an important regulator of cdk2, we investigated whether aberrant expression of this cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor might contribute to cell cycle deregulation by v-Jun. We find that the basal levels of p21 CIP1 mRNA and protein expression are greatly reduced in chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF) transformed by v-Jun, and that v-Jun blocks the increases in p21 CIP1 expression that normally accompany growth inhibition induced by serum deprivation or confluency in untransformed CEF. Importantly, ectopic expression of p21 CIP1 in v-Jun-transformed CEF inhibits both cdk2 kinase activity and cell cycle progression, indicating that these alterations in p21 CIP1 expression are likely to be functionally significant for growth deregulation. We also investigated the mechanism through which v-Jun disturbs p21 CIP1 expression and the possible involvement of a known p21 CIP1 regulator, p53, as an intermediate in this process. This analysis revealed that repression is mediated primarily at the level of p21 CIP1 gene transcription, however the mechanism is complex; both p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms contribute as judged by analysis of p21 CIP1 promoter mutants and other assays of p53 transcriptional activity."
https://openalex.org/W2004730096,"Mice expressing SV40 T-Antigen in liver under control of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase promoter were generated. By altering the carbohydrate content of the diet, TAg expression, the rate of hepatocyte proliferation and apoptosis, and hence hepatocarcinogenesis, could be regulated. Carbohydrate-mediated suppression of TAg resulted in slow hepatic growth that progressed to focal hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after a long latency period. In contrast, induction of TAg by feeding mice a low carbohydrate diet resulted in massive hepatomegaly that progressed rapidly to diffuse multifocal HCC. Hepatic TAg expression could be efficiently repressed by switching mice from the low to the high-carbohydrate diet, which if instigated prior to the development of HCC, resulted in rapid regression through a p53-independent reduction in hepatocyte proliferation and an increase in hepatocyte apoptosis. Although liver growth was accompanied by compensatory hepatocyte apoptosis, an apoptotic deficit developed following chronic exposure to high levels of TAg. This was associated with Akt phosphorylation and increased expression of the antiapoptotic molecules bfl-1/A1, TIAP, and A20. Mice were resistant to Fas-induced hepatocellular apoptosis due to severely impaired caspase activation and failed activation of the mitochondrial amplification loop. This model will be useful to investigate oncogene-mediated disruption of the cell cycle and apoptosis, and to determine which processes constitute fixed, or reversible aspects of the tumorigenic process."
