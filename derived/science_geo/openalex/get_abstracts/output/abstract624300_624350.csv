https://openalex.org/W2904139947,"Most patients with cancer either do not respond to immune checkpoint blockade or develop resistance to it, often because of acquired mutations that impair antigen presentation. Here we show that loss of function of the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 in tumour cells profoundly sensitizes tumours to immunotherapy and overcomes resistance to checkpoint blockade. In the absence of ADAR1, A-to-I editing of interferon-inducible RNA species is reduced, leading to double-stranded RNA ligand sensing by PKR and MDA5; this results in growth inhibition and tumour inflammation, respectively. Loss of ADAR1 overcomes resistance to PD-1 checkpoint blockade caused by inactivation of antigen presentation by tumour cells. Thus, effective anti-tumour immunity is constrained by inhibitory checkpoints such as ADAR1 that limit the sensing of innate ligands. The induction of sufficient inflammation in tumours that are sensitized to interferon can bypass the therapeutic requirement for CD8+ T cell recognition of cancer cells and may provide a general strategy to overcome immunotherapy resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2894482543,"The electrical Hall effect is the production, upon the application of an electric field, of a transverse voltage under an out-of-plane magnetic field. Studies of the Hall effect have led to important breakthroughs, including the discoveries of Berry curvature and topological Chern invariants1,2. The internal magnetization of magnets means that the electrical Hall effect can occur in the absence of an external magnetic field2; this 'anomalous' Hall effect is important for the study of quantum magnets2-7. The electrical Hall effect has rarely been studied in non-magnetic materials without external magnetic fields, owing to the constraint of time-reversal symmetry. However, only in the linear response regime-when the Hall voltage is linearly proportional to the external electric field-does the Hall effect identically vanish as a result of time-reversal symmetry; the Hall effect in the nonlinear response regime is not subject to such symmetry constraints8-10. Here we report observations of the nonlinear Hall effect10 in electrical transport in bilayers of the non-magnetic quantum material WTe2 under time-reversal-symmetric conditions. We show that an electric current in bilayer WTe2 leads to a nonlinear Hall voltage in the absence of a magnetic field. The properties of this nonlinear Hall effect are distinct from those of the anomalous Hall effect in metals: the nonlinear Hall effect results in a quadratic, rather than linear, current-voltage characteristic and, in contrast to the anomalous Hall effect, the nonlinear Hall effect results in a much larger transverse than longitudinal voltage response, leading to a nonlinear Hall angle (the angle between the total voltage response and the applied electric field) of nearly 90 degrees. We further show that the nonlinear Hall effect provides a direct measure of the dipole moment10 of the Berry curvature, which arises from layer-polarized Dirac fermions in bilayer WTe2. Our results demonstrate a new type of Hall effect and provide a way of detecting Berry curvature in non-magnetic quantum materials."
https://openalex.org/W2903960245,"Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are synthetic receptors that target and reprogram T cells to acquire augmented antitumor properties1. CD19-specific CARs that comprise CD28 and CD3ζ signaling motifs2 have induced remarkable responses in patients with refractory leukemia3-5 and lymphoma6 and were recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration7. These CARs program highly performing effector functions that mediate potent tumor elimination4,8 despite the limited persistence they confer on T cells3-6,8. Extending their functional persistence without compromising their potency should improve current CAR therapies. Strong T cell activation drives exhaustion9,10, which may be accentuated by the redundancy of CD28 and CD3ζ signaling11,12 as well as the spatiotemporal constraints imparted by the structure of second-generation CARs2. Thus, we hypothesized that calibrating the activation potential of CD28-based CARs would differentially reprogram T cell function and differentiation. Here, we show that CARs encoding a single immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif direct T cells to different fates by balancing effector and memory programs, thereby yielding CAR designs with enhanced therapeutic profiles."
https://openalex.org/W2905335418,"Microglia, the specialized innate immune cells of the CNS, play crucial roles in neural development and function. Different phenotypes and functions have been ascribed to rodent microglia, but little is known about human microglia (huMG) heterogeneity. Difficulties in procuring huMG and their susceptibility to cryopreservation damage have limited large-scale studies. Here we applied multiplexed mass cytometry for a comprehensive characterization of postmortem huMG (103 - 104 cells). We determined expression levels of 57 markers on huMG isolated from up to five different brain regions of nine donors. We identified the phenotypic signature of huMG, which was distinct from peripheral myeloid cells but was comparable to fresh huMG. We detected microglia regional heterogeneity using a hybrid workflow combining Cytobank and R/Bioconductor for multidimensional data analysis. Together, these methodologies allowed us to perform high-dimensional, large-scale immunophenotyping of huMG at the single-cell level, which facilitates their unambiguous profiling in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2903957639,"The coexistence of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles in the neocortex is linked to neural system failure and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. However, the underlying neuronal mechanisms are unknown. By employing in vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging of layer 2/3 cortical neurons in mice expressing human Aβ and tau, we reveal a dramatic tau-dependent suppression of activity and silencing of many neurons, which dominates over Aβ-dependent neuronal hyperactivity. We show that neurofibrillary tangles are neither sufficient nor required for the silencing, which instead is dependent on soluble tau. Surprisingly, although rapidly effective in tau mice, suppression of tau gene expression was much less effective in rescuing neuronal impairments in mice containing both Aβ and tau. Together, our results reveal how Aβ and tau synergize to impair the functional integrity of neural circuits in vivo and suggest a possible cellular explanation contributing to disappointing results from anti-Aβ therapeutic trials."

Of these genes, 124 reach exome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10-7) for DNM. Intersecting these results with copy number variation (CNV) morbidity data shows an enrichment for genomic disorder regions (30/253, likelihood ratio (LR) +1.85, P = 0.0017). We identify genes with an excess of missense DNMs overlapping deletion syndromes (for example, KIF1A and the 2q37 deletion) as well as duplication syndromes, such as recurrent MAPK3 missense mutations within the chromosome 16p11.2 duplication, recurrent CHD4 missense DNMs in the 12p13 duplication region, and recurrent WDFY4 missense DNMs in the 10q11.23 duplication region. Network analyses of genes showing an excess of DNMs highlights functional networks, including cell-specific enrichments in the D1+ and D2+ spiny neurons of the striatum."

https://openalex.org/W2905176374,"We screened for novel circuits in the mouse brain that promote wakefulness. Chemogenetic activation experiments and electroencephalogram recordings pointed to glutamatergic/nitrergic (NOS1) and GABAergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Activating glutamatergic/NOS1 neurons, which were wake- and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep-active, produced wakefulness through projections to the nucleus accumbens and the lateral hypothalamus. Lesioning the glutamate cells impaired the consolidation of wakefulness. By contrast, activation of GABAergic VTA neurons elicited long-lasting non-rapid-eye-movement-like sleep resembling sedation. Lesioning these neurons produced an increase in wakefulness that persisted for at least 4 months. Surprisingly, these VTA GABAergic neurons were wake- and REM sleep-active. We suggest that GABAergic VTA neurons may limit wakefulness by inhibiting the arousal-promoting VTA glutamatergic and/or dopaminergic neurons and through projections to the lateral hypothalamus. Thus, in addition to its contribution to goal- and reward-directed behaviors, the VTA has a role in regulating sleep and wakefulness."
https://openalex.org/W2904237875,"Accumulation of tau and amyloid-β are two pathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study using the histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) mark in 669 aged human prefrontal cortices; in contrast with amyloid-β, tau protein burden had a broad effect on the epigenome, affecting 5,990 of 26,384 H3K9ac domains. Tau-related alterations aggregated in large genomic segments reflecting spatial chromatin organization, and the magnitude of these effects correlated with the segment's nuclear lamina association. Functional relevance of these chromatin changes was demonstrated by (1) consistent transcriptional changes in three independent datasets and (2) similar findings in two mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we found that tau overexpression in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons altered chromatin structure and that these effects could be blocked by a small molecule predicted to reverse the tau effect. Thus, we report broad tau-driven chromatin rearrangements in the aging human brain that may be reversible with heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2905504964,"Transcriptomic analyses of postmortem brains have begun to elucidate molecular abnormalities in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, a crucial pathway involved in synaptic development, RNA editing, has not yet been studied on a genome-wide scale. Here we profiled global patterns of adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing in a large cohort of postmortem brains of people with ASD. We observed a global bias for hypoediting in ASD brains, which was shared across brain regions and involved many synaptic genes. We show that the Fragile X proteins FMRP and FXR1P interact with RNA-editing enzymes (ADAR proteins) and modulate A-to-I editing. Furthermore, we observed convergent patterns of RNA-editing alterations in ASD and Fragile X syndrome, establishing this as a molecular link between these related diseases. Our findings, which are corroborated across multiple data sets, including dup15q (genomic duplication of 15q11.2-13.1) cases associated with intellectual disability, highlight RNA-editing dysregulation in ASD and reveal new mechanisms underlying this disorder. An overall downregulation of RNA editing was observed in postmortem brains from people with autism, which was consistent across brain regions and genetic disorder subtypes. These changes were regulated by the RNA-binding proteins FMRP and FXR1P."
https://openalex.org/W2903117173,"Excitatory neurons are preferentially impaired in early Alzheimer’s disease but the pathways contributing to their relative vulnerability remain largely unknown. Here we report that pathological tau accumulation takes place predominantly in excitatory neurons compared to inhibitory neurons, not only in the entorhinal cortex, a brain region affected in early Alzheimer’s disease, but also in areas affected later by the disease. By analyzing RNA transcripts from single-nucleus RNA datasets, we identified a specific tau homeostasis signature of genes differentially expressed in excitatory compared to inhibitory neurons. One of the genes, BCL2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3), a facilitator of autophagy, was identified as a hub, or master regulator, gene. We verified that reducing BAG3 levels in primary neurons exacerbated pathological tau accumulation, whereas BAG3 overexpression attenuated it. These results define a tau homeostasis signature that underlies the cellular and regional vulnerability of excitatory neurons to tau pathology. Neuron types vulnerable to tau accumulation (excitatory neurons) in AD brain are intrinsically less able to maintain tau homeostasis than neuron types that are resistant (inhibitory neurons)."
https://openalex.org/W2904109453,"The nucleotide ppGpp is a highly conserved regulatory molecule in bacteria that helps tune growth rate to nutrient availability. Despite decades of study, how ppGpp regulates growth remains poorly understood. Here, we developed and validated a capture-compound mass spectrometry approach that identified >50 putative ppGpp targets in Escherichia coli. These targets control many key cellular processes and include 13 enzymes required for nucleotide synthesis. We demonstrated that ppGpp inhibits the de novo synthesis of all purine nucleotides by directly targeting the enzyme PurF. By solving a structure of PurF bound to ppGpp, we designed a mutation that ablates ppGpp-based regulation, leading to dysregulation of purine-nucleotide synthesis following ppGpp accumulation. Collectively, our results provide new insights into ppGpp-based growth control and a nearly comprehensive set of targets for future exploration. The capture compounds developed should also enable the rapid identification of ppGpp targets in any species, including pathogens. A mass-spectrometry-based approach to identify E. coli targets of ppGpp finds 56 putative targets including enzymes involved in nucleotide synthesis, such as PurF, which is directly inhibited by ppGpp, regulating adenosine and guanine nucleotide synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2904760082,"Accumulation of abnormally phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43) is the main pathology in affected neurons of people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Morphological diversity and neuroanatomical distribution of pTDP-43 accumulations allowed classification of FTLD cases into at least four subtypes, which are correlated with clinical presentations and genetic causes. To understand the molecular basis of this heterogeneity, we developed SarkoSpin, a new method for biochemical isolation of pathological TDP-43. By combining SarkoSpin with mass spectrometry, we revealed proteins beyond TDP-43 that become abnormally insoluble in a disease subtype–specific manner. We show that pTDP-43 extracted from brain forms stable assemblies of distinct densities and morphologies that are associated with disease subtypes. Importantly, biochemically extracted pTDP-43 assemblies showed differential neurotoxicity and seeding that were correlated with disease duration of FTLD subjects. Our data are consistent with the notion that disease heterogeneity could originate from alternate pathological TDP-43 conformations, which are reminiscent of prion strains. Using a newly developed biochemical method for aggregated protein extraction, Laferrière and colleagues uncover different neurotoxic types of pathologic TDP-43 assemblies in the brains of subjects with distinct subtypes of frontotemporal dementia."
https://openalex.org/W2904473855,"Activating BRAF mutants and fusions signal as RAS-independent constitutively active dimers with the exception of BRAF V600 mutant alleles which can function as active monomers1. Current RAF inhibitors are monomer selective, they potently inhibit BRAF V600 monomers but their inhibition of RAF dimers is limited by induction of negative cooperativity when bound to one site in the dimer1-3. Moreover, acquired resistance to these drugs is usually due to molecular lesions that cause V600 mutants to dimerize4-8. We show here that PLX8394, a new RAF inhibitor9, inhibits ERK signaling by specifically disrupting BRAF-containing dimers, including BRAF homodimers and BRAF-CRAF heterodimers, but not CRAF homodimers or ARAF-containing dimers. Differences in the amino acid residues in the amino (N)-terminal portion of the kinase domain of RAF isoforms are responsible for this differential vulnerability. As a BRAF-specific dimer breaker, PLX8394 selectively inhibits ERK signaling in tumors driven by dimeric BRAF mutants, including BRAF fusions and splice variants as well as BRAF V600 monomers, but spares RAF function in normal cells in which CRAF homodimers can drive signaling. Our work suggests that drugs with these properties will be safe and useful for treating tumors driven by activating BRAF mutants or fusions."

https://openalex.org/W2951158388,"Preference-based decisions are essential for survival, for instance, when deciding what we should (not) eat. Despite their importance, preference-based decisions are surprisingly variable and can appear irrational in ways that have defied mechanistic explanations. Here we propose that subjective valuation results from an inference process that accounts for the structure of values in the environment and that maximizes information in value representations in line with demands imposed by limited coding resources. A model of this inference process explains the variability in both subjective value reports and preference-based choices, and predicts a new preference illusion that we validate with empirical data. Interestingly, the same model explains the level of confidence associated with these reports. Our results imply that preference-based decisions reflect information-maximizing transmission and statistically optimal decoding of subjective values by a limited-capacity system. These findings provide a unified account of how humans perceive and valuate the environment to optimally guide behavior. Polanía et al. show that, similarly to sensory signals, subjective preferences guiding choice are represented by the brain in a manner that accounts for regularities of the environment, thereby optimizing use of limited neural processing resources."
https://openalex.org/W2905222095,"We investigated locus coeruleus (LC) modulation of thalamic feature selectivity through reverse correlation analysis of single-unit recordings from different stages of the rat vibrissa pathway. LC activation increased feature selectivity, drastically improving thalamic information transmission. We found that this improvement was dependent on both local activation of α-adrenergic receptors and modulation of T-type calcium channels in the thalamus and was not due to LC modulation of trigeminothalamic feedforward or corticothalamic feedback inputs. Tonic spikes with LC stimulation carried three times the information as did tonic spikes without LC stimulation. Modeling confirmed norepinephrine regulation of intrathalamic circuit dynamics led to the improved information transmission. Behavioral data demonstrated that LC activation increased the perceptual performance of animals performing tactile discrimination tasks through LC–norepinephrine optimization of thalamic sensory processing. These results suggest a new subdimension within the tonic mode in which brain state can optimize thalamic sensory processing through modulation of intrathalamic circuit dynamics. Locus coeruleus (LC) activation enhanced thalamic feature selectivity & perceptual performance. Electrophysiology and modeling suggest this improvement is due to reduction in Ca2+ T-channel activity by LC regulation of intrathalamic circuit dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2904379191,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by abnormalities in B cell and T cell function, but the role of disturbances in the activation status of macrophages (Mϕ) has not been well described in human patients. To address this, gene expression profiles from isolated lymphoid and myeloid populations were analyzed to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes between healthy controls and patients with either inactive or active SLE. While hundreds of DE genes were identified in B and T cells of active SLE patients, there were no DE genes found in B or T cells from patients with inactive SLE compared to healthy controls. In contrast, large numbers of DE genes were found in myeloid cells (MC) from both active and inactive SLE patients. Among the DE genes were several known to play roles in Mϕ activation and polarization, including the M1 genes STAT1 and SOCS3 and the M2 genes STAT3, STAT6, and CD163. M1-associated genes were far more frequent in data sets from active versus inactive SLE patients. To characterize the relationship between Mϕ activation and disease activity in greater detail, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify modules of genes associated with clinical activity in SLE patients. Among these were disease activity-correlated modules containing activation signatures of predominantly M1-associated genes. No disease activity-correlated modules were enriched in M2-associated genes. Pathway and upstream regulator analysis of DE genes from both active and inactive SLE MC were cross-referenced with high-scoring hits from the drug discovery Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) to identify new strategies to treat both stages of SLE. A machine learning approach employing MC gene modules and a generalized linear model was able to predict the disease activity status in unrelated gene expression data sets. In summary, altered MC gene expression is characteristic of both active and inactive SLE. However, disease activity is associated with an alteration in the activation of MC, with a bias toward the M1 proinflammatory phenotype. These data suggest that while hyperactivity of B cells and T cells is associated with active SLE, MC potentially direct flare-ups and remission by altering their activation status toward the M1 state."
https://openalex.org/W2904073127,"Larus gull species have proven adaptable to urbanization and due to their generalist feeding behaviors, they provide useful opportunities to study how urban environments impact foraging behavior and host-associated microbiota. We evaluated how urbanization influenced the foraging behavior and microbiome characteristics of breeding herring gulls (Larus argentatus) at three different colonies on the east coast of the United States. Study colonies represented high, medium and low degrees of urbanization, respectively. At all colonies, gulls frequently foraged at landfills and in other urban environments, but both the use of urban environments and gull foraging metrics differed with the degree of urbanization. Gulls at the more urban colonies used urban environments more frequently, showed higher rates of site fidelity and took shorter trips. Gulls at less urban colonies used a greater diversity of habitat types and foraged offshore. We observed high microbial diversity at all colonies, though microbial diversity was highest at the least urban colony where gulls used a wider variety of foraging habitats. This suggests that gulls may acquire a wider range of bacteria when visiting a higher variety of foraging sites. Our findings highlight the influence of urban habitats on gull movements and microbiome composition and diversity during the breeding season and represent the first application of amplicon sequence variants, an objective and repeatable method of bacterial classification, to study the microbiota of a seabird species."
https://openalex.org/W2904555327,"Glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most aggressive primary brain tumors, with an average survival of less than 15 months. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop novel therapeutic strategies for GBM. This study aimed to assess the prognostic value of miR-4516 and investigate its oncogenic functions and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms in GBM. To determine the correlation between miR-4516 expression and overall survival of patients with GBM, total RNAs were isolated from 268 FFPE tumor samples, miR expression was assayed (simultaneously) using the nCounter human miRNA v3a assay followed by univariable and multivariable survival analyses. Further, in vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to define the role of miR-4516 in GBM tumorigenesis and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Upon multivariable analysis, miR-4516 was correlated with poor prognosis in GBM patients (HR = 1.49, 95%CI: 1.12–1.99, P = 0.01). Interestingly, the significance of miR-4516 was retained including MGMT methylation status. Overexpression of miR-4516 significantly enhanced cell proliferation and invasion of GBM cells both in vitro and in vivo. While conducting downstream targeting studies, we found that the tumor-promoting function of miR-4516, in part, was mediated by direct targeting of PTPN14 (protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 14) which, in turn, regulated the Hippo pathway in GBM. Taken together, our data suggest that miR-4516 represents an independent negative prognostic factor in GBM patients and acts as a novel oncogene in GBM, which regulates the PTPN14/Hippo pathway. Thus, this newly identified miR-4516 may serve as a new potential therapeutic target for GBM treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2903763445,"Biological electron transfer is challenging to directly regulate using environmental conditions. To enable dynamic, protein-level control over energy flow in metabolic systems for synthetic biology and bioelectronics, we created ferredoxin logic gates that utilize transcriptional and post-translational inputs to control energy flow through a synthetic electron transfer pathway that is required for bacterial growth. These logic gates were created by subjecting a thermostable, plant-type ferredoxin to backbone fission and fusing the resulting fragments to a pair of proteins that self-associate, a pair of proteins whose association is stabilized by a small molecule, and to the termini of a ligand-binding domain. We show that the latter domain insertion design strategy yields an allosteric ferredoxin switch that acquires an oxygen-tolerant [2Fe-2S] cluster and can use different chemicals, including a therapeutic drug and an environmental pollutant, to control the production of a reduced metabolite in Escherichia coli and cell lysates."
https://openalex.org/W2903676745,"Among RNA 5′-cap structures, γ-phosphate monomethylation is unique to a small subset of noncoding RNAs, 7SK and U6 in humans. 7SK is capped by methylphosphate capping enzyme (MePCE), which has a second nonenzymatic role as a core component of the 7SK ribonuclear protein (RNP), an essential regulator of RNA transcription. We report 2.0- and 2.1-Å X-ray crystal structures of the human MePCE methyltransferase domain bound to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) and uncapped or capped 7SK substrates, respectively. 7SK recognition is achieved by protein contacts to a 5′-hairpin-single-stranded RNA region, thus explaining MePCE’s specificity for 7SK and U6. The structures reveal SAH and product RNA in a near-transition-state geometry. Unexpectedly, binding experiments showed that MePCE has higher affinity for capped versus uncapped 7SK, and kinetic data support a model of slow product release. This work reveals the molecular mechanism of methyl transfer and 7SK retention by MePCE for subsequent assembly of 7SK RNP. Structural analysis of the human MePCE methyltransferase domain in complex with 7SK in the presence of SAH or SAM reveals that MePCE has higher affinity for capped 7SK and holds it for subsequent assembly of 7SK RNP."
https://openalex.org/W2904216015,"This paper examines search and rescue and backcountry medical response constraints in the Canadian Arctic and potential for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to aid in response and preparedness. Semi-structured interviews (n = 18) were conducted with search and rescue responders, Elders, and emergency management officials to collect data on current emergency response and potential for UAV use. UAV test flights (n = 17) were undertaken with community members. We analyzed five years of weather data to examine UAV flight suitability. Numerous challenges face Arctic search and rescue and backcountry emergency response. Changing social and environmental conditions were described as increasing vulnerability to backcountry emergencies. Responders desired additional first aid and emergency training. Legal and weather restrictions were found to limit where, when and who could fly UAVs. UAVs were demonstrated to have potential benefits for hazard monitoring but not for SAR or medical response due to legal restrictions, weather margins, and local capacity. We find that communities are ill-prepared for ongoing SAR demands, let alone a larger disaster. There are numerous limitations to the use of consumer UAVs by Arctic communities. Prevention of backcountry medical emergencies, building resilience to disasters, and first responder training should be prioritized over introducing UAVs to the response system."

We consider nine epigenomic features across 115 cell types and measure information about function as a reduction in entropy under a probabilistic evolutionary model fitted to human and nonhuman primate genomes. Several epigenomic features yield more information in combination than they do individually. We find that the entropy in human genetic variation predominantly reflects a balance between mutation and neutral drift. Our cell-type-specific FitCons scores reveal relationships among cell types and suggest that around 8% of nucleotide sites are constrained by natural selection."
https://openalex.org/W2904791466,"Late wilt, a disease severely affecting maize fields throughout Israel, is characterized by relatively rapid wilting of maize plants before tasseling and until shortly before maturity. The disease's causal agent is the fungus Harpophora maydis, a soil-borne and seed-borne pathogen, which is currently controlled using reduced sensitivity maize cultivars. In a former study, we showed that Azoxystrobin (AS) injected into a drip irrigation line assigned for each row can suppress H. maydis in the field and that AS seed coating can provide an additional layer of protection. In the present study, we examine a more cost-effective protective treatment using this fungicide with Difenoconazole mixture (AS+DC), or Fluazinam, or Fluopyram and Trifloxystrobin mixture, or Prothioconazole and Tebuconazole mixture in combined treatment of seed coating and a drip irrigation line for two coupling rows. A recently developed Real-Time PCR method revealed that protecting the plants using AS+DC seed coating alone managed to delay pathogen DNA spread in the maize tissues, in the early stages of the growth season (up to the age of 50 days from sowing), but was less effective in protecting the crops later. AS+DC seed coating combined with drip irrigation using AS+DC was the most successful treatment, and in the double-row cultivation, it reduced fungal DNA in the host tissues to near zero levels. This treatment minimized the development of wilt symptoms by 41% and recovered cob yield by a factor of 1.6 (to the level common in healthy fields). Moreover, the yield classified as A class (cob weight of more than 250 g) increased from 58% to 75% in this treatment. This successful treatment against H. maydis in Israel can now be applied in vast areas to protect sensitive maize cultivars against maize late wilt disease."
https://openalex.org/W2903576205,"The future protection of marine biodiversity through good conservation planning requires both the identification of key habitats with unique ecological characteristics and detailed knowledge of their human utilization through fisheries. Demersal fisheries are important disturbers of benthic habitats. They often have a heterogeneous spatial distribution, pressurizing particular habitats with high abundances of target species. For the North Sea, we quantified the commonness/rarity of habitats in relation to the environmental determinants of so-called fishing hotspots, to support better-informed conservation planning of benthic habitats in this intensively used continental shelf.We first distinguished 9 main seascapes in the study area based on seabed morphology. Secondly, we determined average fishing intensity and fishing hotspots using VMS-data for the three dominant Dutch fisheries from 2008 to 2015: beam-trawlers targeting sole Solea solea (Beam-Sole), beam-trawlers targeting plaice Pleuronectes platessa (Beam-Plaice), and otter-trawlers targeting Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus and demersal fish (Otter-Mix). Within the seascapes subjected to >80% of the fishing activity, nineteen environmental factors (summarized by PCA) were used to ecologically characterize fishing hotspot locations using MaxEnt response modelling.We found that all three fisheries target highly specific, uncommon habitats. Beam-Sole fishers targeted warmer, shallow, dynamic, nearshore habitats, and within these specifically the depressions between sand ridges. Beam-Plaice fishers mainly targeted the exposed, non-muddy flanks of the Dogger Bank and similar large-scale elevations (50-75 km) where especially the ridges of smaller sand banks are used. Otter-Mix fisheries concentrated in areas with low bed shear stress, located in muddy, relatively deeper areas.This study is the first to provide insight in benthic habitat types that are frequently targeted by fishers in the North Sea. We demonstrated unequal exploitation pressure between seabed habitats, with the majority of hotspots in the less common habitats. Our results hence contribute to a more effective, ecologically informed planning for the protection and monitoring of all seabed habitats and biodiversity of the North Sea."
https://openalex.org/W2952061642,"The success of terrestrial carbon sequestration projects for rural development in sub-Saharan Africa lies in the (i) involvement of local populations in the selection of woody species, which represent the biological assets they use to meet their daily needs, and (ii) information about the potential of these species to store carbon. Although the latter is a key prerequisite, there is very little information available. To help fill this gap, the present study was undertaken in four pilot villages (Kou, Dao, Vrassan and Cassou) in Ziro Province, south-central Burkina Faso. The objective was to determine carbon storage potential for top-priority woody species preferred by local smallholders. We used (i) participatory rural appraisal consisting of group discussions and key informant interviews to identify priority species and functions, and (ii) landscape assessment of carbon stocks in the preferred woody species. Results revealed 79 priority tree and shrub species grouped into six functions, of which medicine, food and income emerge as the most important ones for the communities. For these functions, smallholders overwhelmingly listed Vitellaria paradoxa, Parkia biglobosa, Afzelia africana, Adansonia digitata, Detarium microcarpum, and Lannea microcarpa among the most important tree species. Among the preferred woody species in Cassou and Kou, the highest quantity of carbon was stored by V. paradoxa (1180 ±209 kg C ha-1 to 2089±522 kg C ha-1) and the lowest by Grewia bicolor (5±1.2 kg C ha-1). The potential carbon stored by the preferred tree communities was estimated at 587.9 Mg C ha-1 (95% CI: 456.7; 719.1 Mg C ha-1) in Kou and256.8 Mg C ha-1 (95% CI: 67.6; 324.4 Mg C ha-1) in Cassou. The study showed that the species that farmers preferred most stored more carbon than species that were less preferred."

Habitual standing posture was assessed in each group, using a three-dimensional motion analysis system, force plates, and a spinal mouse. Kinetic and posture angle factors were compared between participants with and without low back pain. The relationship between specific features of standing posture and low back pain was analyzed using logistic regression.The intervertebral disc compressive force and the low back moment were significantly greater in the group with low back pain than in the group without low back pain. The intervertebral disc compressive force was the factor most strongly associated with low back pain during static standing.Logistic regression analysis identified intervertebral disc compressive force as an independent variable associated with low back pain. This finding suggests that increased intervertebral disc compressive force may promote development of low back pain in standing posture."
https://openalex.org/W2904397432,"Recent studies have suggested that maternal high-fat (HF) diet caused inflammation changes in adipose tissue; however, it remains unclear if maternal diet intervention before pregnancy rescues such effects in offspring. To address this question, female mice were continued on a normal-fat (NF group), or a HF diet (HF group) or transitioned from a HF diet to a NF diet at 1 (H1N group), 5 (H5N group) or 9 weeks (H9N group) prior to pregnancy. Among the three intervention groups, the H9N offspring displayed less and steady body weight gain, and maintained glucose tolerance, whereas the H1N and H5N offspring showed exacerbate these phenotypes. The H1N and H5N, but not the H9N offspring, displayed adipocyte hypertrophy associated with increased expression of genes involved in fat deposition. The H1N and H5N, but not the H9N adipose tissue, displayed increased macrophage infiltration with enhanced expression of inflammatory cytokine genes. In addition, overactivation of the NF-κB and the JNK signaling were observed in the H1N adipose tissue. Overall, our study showed that a long-term but not a short- or medium-term diet intervention before pregnancy released offspring adipose tissue inflammation induced by maternal HF diet, which adds details in our understanding how the maternal environment either promotes or discourages onset of disease in offspring. Clinically, this study is of great value for providing evidence in the design of clinical trials to evaluate the urgently required intervention strategies to minimize the intergenerational cycle of obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2905541268,"Resistance training (RT) is performed at distinct levels of intensity from the beginning to the end of exercise sets, increasing the sensation of effort as the exercise progress to more vigorous levels, commonly leading to changes on the facial expression of RT practitioners. The objective of this study is to evaluate changes in facial expressions using the Facial Action Coding System(FACS) and the activation of facial muscles by surface electromyography(sEMG) at two different levels of effort during resistance exercise and to investigate the correlation between facial expression and exercise intensity and fatigue. Eleven healthy male participants [23±6years; 1.77±6 m; 78±10kg] performed a set of arm curl exercise at 50% and 85% 1RM until muscle fatigue. The Surface electromyography (sEMG activity was recorded simultaneously in areas of the epicranius muscle (EM) and zygomatic major muscle (ZM). Facial expression was recorded and blindly scored by five experienced examiners. Scores (0–5) were based on the level of activity of the ZM (lip corner puller—Action Unit 12-FACS) during exercise. Facial expression and sEMG data were obtained during the exercise at the first repetition and at muscle failure. The root mean square (RMS) of the sEMG amplitude of the EM was significantly increased between the first and last repetition (50%1RM:p = 0.002,d = 1.75; and 85%1RM:p = 0.002,d = 1.54). The RMS values for the ZM were significantly increased between the first and last repetition (50%1RM:p<0.001,d = 2.67; 85%1RM:p<0.001,d = 0.50). The RMS values for the ZM were also increased in 85%1RM compared to values obtained from 50%1RM (p = 0.001,d = 1.12) at the first repetition. AU12 scores and RMS values were not statistically different between 85%1RM and 50%1RM at the last repetition. Furthermore, there was a strong correlation (r = 0.61;p = 0.045) between AU12 scores and the sEMG peak for the ZM. In conclusion, changes in facial expression may be directly correlated with different resistance exercise intensities and fatigue."
https://openalex.org/W2904084754,"Microarray technology fails in detecting point mutations present in a small fraction of cells from heterogeneous tissue samples or in plasma in a background of wild-type cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). The aim of this study is to overcome the lack of sensitivity and specificity of current microarray approaches introducing a rapid and sensitive microarray-based assay for the multiplex detection of minority mutations of oncogenes (KRAS, NRAS and BRAF) with relevant diagnostics implications in tissue biopsies and plasma samples in metastatic colorectal cancer patients. In our approach, either wild-type or mutated PCR fragments are hybridized in solution, in a temperature gradient, with a set of reporters with a 5' domain, complementary to the target sequences and a 3' domain complementary to a surface immobilized probe. Upon specific hybridization in solution, which occurs specifically thanks to the temperature gradients, wild-type and mutated samples are captured at specific location on the surface by hybridization of the 3’ reporter domain with its complementary immobilized probe sequence. The most common mutations in KRAS, NRAS and BRAF genes were detected in less than 90 minutes in tissue biopsies and plasma samples of metastatic colorectal cancer patients. Moreover, the method was able to reveal mutant alleles representing less than 0,3% of total DNA. We demonstrated detection limits superior to those provided by many current technologies in the detection of RAS and BRAF gene superfamily mutations, a level of sensitivity compatible with the analysis of cell free circulating tumor DNA in liquid biopsy."
https://openalex.org/W2904842758,"A smart grid, considered the next-generation type of power grid, combines a traditional power grid with information and communication technologies to effectively facilitate power generation and ensure transmission security and reliability in real-time. Only authorized consumers should be able to access the smart grid because the information gathered by smart meters includes users’ private information. However, smart grid security is still a challenge. Motivated by this challenge, in this paper, we propose a heterogeneous signcryption (HSC) scheme for secure communication between smart meters and the utility. We demonstrate that this scheme is indistinguishable against adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks (IND-CCA2), existentially unforgeable against adaptive chosen-message attacks (EUF-CMA) and ciphertext-anonymous against adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks (ANON-CCA2) under the computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) problem in the random oracle model. Our scheme simultaneously achieves confidentiality, integrity, authentication, non-repudiation and ciphertext anonymity in a single logical step. It supports heterogeneous systems, allowing a meter in an identity-based cryptography (IBC) environment to transmit electrical usage data to a utility in a public key infrastructure (PKI) environment. Compared with other existing related schemes, our scheme has the lowest communication overhead and energy consumption for the smart grid. Based on these features, our scheme is highly suitable for secure power transmissions in a smart grid."
https://openalex.org/W2904180088,"Inflammatory and microenvironmental factors produced by cancer cells are thought to directly or indirectly promote cancer cell growth. Prostaglandins, including prostaglandin E2, have key roles as a microenvironment factor in influencing the development of tumors, and are produced by the rate limiting enzyme cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2). In this study, we used canine melanoma cells treated with the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and investigated the transcriptional factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling in IL-1β-induced COX-2 expression. IL-1β induced prostaglandin E2 release and COX-2 mRNA expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In the cells treated with the NF-κB inhibitors BAY11-7082 and TPC-1, IL-1β-mediated prostaglandin E2 release and COX-2 mRNA expression were inhibited. IL-1β also provoked phosphorylation of p65/RelA and p105/NF-κB1, which are members of the NF-κB families. The IL-1β-induced phosphorylation of p65 and p105 was attenuated in the presence of both NF-κB inhibitors. In melanoma cells transfected with siRNA of p65 or p105, IL-1β-mediated COX-2 mRNA expression was inhibited. These findings suggest that canonical activation of NF-κB signaling plays a crucial role for inflammatory states in melanoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2951359451,"Zombi pea (Vigna vexillata (L.) A. Rich) is an underutilized crop belonging to the genus Vigna. Two domesticated forms of zombi pea are cultivated as crop plants; seed and tuber forms. The cultivated seed form is present in Africa, while the cultivated tuber form is present in a very limited part of Asia. Genetics of domestication have been investigated in most of cultivated Vigna crops by means of quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. In this study, we investigated genetics of domestication in zombi pea by QTL analysis using an F2 population of 139 plants derived from a cross between cultivated tuber form of V. vexillata (JP235863) and wild V. vexillata (AusTRCF66514). A linkage map with 11 linkage groups (LGs) was constructed from this F2 population using 145 SSR, 117 RAD-seq and 2 morphological markers. Many highly segregation distorted markers were found on LGs 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 11. Most of the distorted markers were clustered together and all the markers on LG8 were highly distorted markers. Comparing this V. vexillata linkage map with linkage maps of other four Vigna species demonstrated several genome rearrangements in V. vexillata. QTL analysis for 22 domestication-related traits was investigated by inclusive composite interval mapping in which 37 QTLs were identified for 18 traits; no QTL was detected for 4 traits. Number of QTLs detected in each trait ranged from 1 to 5 with an average of only 2.3. Five QTLs for tuber width and three QTLs for tuber weight. Interestingly, 2 QTLs each for tuber width and tuber weight detected on LG2 and LG4 were located at similar position and wild allele increased tuber width and weight. This indicated wild germplasm having small tuber have potential to increase yield of large tuber cultivated type. Large-effect QTLs (PVE > 20%) were on LG4 (pod length), LG5 (leaf size and seed thickness), and LG7 (for seed-related traits). Comparison of domestication-related QTLs of the zombi pea with those of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), azuki bean (Vigna angularis), mungbean (Vigna radiata) and rice bean (Vigna umbellata) revealed that there was conservation of some QTLs for seed size, pod size and leaf size between zombi pea and cowpea and that QTLs associated with seed size (weight, length, width and thickness) in each species were clustered on same linkage."
https://openalex.org/W2904362408,"Background HIV-1 molecular epidemiology amongst men who have sex with men (MSM) in sub-Saharan Africa remains not well characterized. We aimed to determine HIV-1 subtype distribution, transmission clusters and transmitted drug resistance (TDR) in acute and early infected MSM from Coastal Kenya. Methods Analysis of HIV-1 partial pol sequences from MSM recruited 2005–2017 and sampled within six months of the estimated date of infection. Volunteers were classified as men who have sex with men exclusively (MSME) or with both men and women (MSMW). HIV-1 subtype and transmission clusters were determined by maximum-likelihood phylogenetics. TDR mutations were determined using the Stanford HIV drug resistance database. Results Of the 97 volunteers, majority (69%) were MSMW; 74%, 16%, 9% and 1% had HIV-1 subtypes A1, D, C or G, respectively. Overall, 65% formed transmission clusters, with substantial mixing between MSME and MSMW. Majority of volunteer sequences were either not linked to any reference sequence (56%) or clustered exclusively with sequences of Kenyan origin (19%). Eight (8% [95% CI: 4–16]) had at least one TDR mutation against nucleoside (n = 2 [2%]) and/or non-nucleoside (n = 7 [7%]) reverse transcriptase inhibitors. The most prevalent TDR mutation was K103N (n = 5), with sequences forming transmission clusters of two and three taxa each. There were no significant differences in HIV-1 subtype distribution and TDR between MSME and MSMW. Conclusions This HIV-1 MSM epidemic was predominantly sub-subtype A1, of Kenyan origin, with many transmission clusters and having intermediate level of TDR. Targeted HIV-1 prevention, early identification and care interventions are warranted to break the transmission cycle amongst MSM from Coastal Kenya."
https://openalex.org/W2826166138,"Tensor networks are powerful factorization techniques which reduce resource requirements for numerically simulating principal quantum many-body systems and algorithms. The computational complexity of a tensor network simulation depends on the tensor ranks and the order in which they are contracted. Unfortunately, computing optimal contraction sequences (orderings) in general is known to be a computationally difficult (NP-complete) task. In 2005, Markov and Shi showed that optimal contraction sequences correspond to optimal (minimum width) tree decompositions of a tensor network's line graph, relating the contraction sequence problem to a rich literature in structural graph theory. While treewidth-based methods have largely been ignored in favor of dataset-specific algorithms in the prior tensor networks literature, we demonstrate their practical relevance for problems arising from two distinct methods used in quantum simulation: multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) datasets and quantum circuits generated by the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). We exhibit multiple regimes where treewidth-based algorithms outperform domain-specific algorithms, while demonstrating that the optimal choice of algorithm has a complex dependence on the network density, expected contraction complexity, and user run time requirements. We further provide an open source software framework designed with an emphasis on accessibility and extendability, enabling replicable experimental evaluations and future exploration of competing methods by practitioners."

We obtained optic nerve head (24 radial B scans) and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (3.5-mm circle scan) images in one randomly selected eye of each subject.After adjustment for BMO area and age, there were no significant differences in mean global MRW (P = 0.63) or RNFLT (P = 0.07) among the three groups. Regionally, there were no significant differences in either MRW or RNFLT in most sectors, except in the superonasal sector, in which both MRW and RNFLT were thinner among ED (P = 0.04, P<0.001, respectively). RNFLT was also thinner in ED in the inferonasal sector (P = 0.009). In all races, global MRW decreased and global RNFLT increased with BMO area. AD subjects had higher rates of global RNFLT decay with age (-0.32 μm/year) compared to ED and MD subjects (-0.10 μm/year and -0.08 μm/year, respectively; P = 0.01 and P = 0.02, respectively).While we found no significant differences in global MRW and RNFLT among the three races, age-related thinning of the RNFLT was significantly higher in the AD subgroup, which warrants further study."
https://openalex.org/W2904422464,"Purpose Long-term side effects of the treatments are common in survivors of irradiated pediatric brain tumors. Ionizing radiation in combination with surgery and chemotherapy during childhood may reduce vertebral height and bone mineral density (BMD), and cause growth failure. The aim of this study was to evaluate the late consequences of tumor treatments on vertebrae in survivors of childhood brain tumors. Methods 72 adult survivors (mean age 27.8 years, standard deviation 6.7) of irradiated childhood brain tumor were studied by spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for vertebral abnormalities from the national cohort of Finland. Patients were treated in five university hospitals in Finland between the years 1970 and 2008. Subject height and weight were measured and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. The morphology and height/depth ratio of the vertebrae in the middle of the kyphotic thoracic curvature (Th8) and lumbar lordosis (L3) were examined. Vertebrae were analyzed by Genant’s semiquantative (SQ) method and spinal deformity index (SDI) was calculated. BMD was measured by using dual X-ray absorptiometry. Results 4.2% (3/72) of the patients had undiagnosed asymptomatic vertebral fracture and 5.6% (4/72) of patients had radiation-induced decreased vertebral body height. Male patients had flatter vertebrae compared with females. Patient age at the time of irradiation, BMI and irradiation area correlated to vertebral morphology differentially in males and females. BMD had no association with the vertebral shape. Patients who had received craniospinal irradiation were shorter than the general population. Conclusion Childhood brain tumor survivors had a high number of vertebral abnormalities in young adulthood. Irradiation was associated with abnormal vertebral morphology and compromised final height. Male gender may predispose vertebrae to the side effects of irradiation."
https://openalex.org/W2904560886,"Understanding multi-agent cooperative behavior is challenging in various scientific and engineering domains. In some cases, such as team sports, many cooperative behaviors can be visually categorized and labeled manually by experts. However, these actions which are manually categorized with the same label based on its function have low spatiotemporal similarity. In other words, it is difficult to find similar and different structures of the motions with the same and different labels, respectively. Here, we propose an automatic recognition system for strategic cooperative plays, which are the minimal, basic, and diverse plays in a ball game. Using player's moving distance, geometric information, and distances among players, the proposed method accurately discriminated not only the cooperative plays in a primary area, i.e., near the ball, but also those distant from a primary area. We also propose a method to classify more detailed types of cooperative plays in various situations. The proposed framework, which sheds light on inconspicuous players to play important roles, could have a potential to detect well-defined and labeled cooperative behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2904981813,"Despite good clinical outcomes associated with curved intertrochanteric varus osteotomy for the treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head, post-operative leg-length discrepancy is frequently reported and might reduce patient satisfaction. Although previous report showed that varus angulation affected post-operative leg-length discrepancy, sufficient varus angulation is the most important factor for obtaining a lateral intact portion. Therefore, to ensure better postoperative outcomes, detection of other parameters associated with leg shortening may prove useful. This study aimed to detect other factors influencing post-operative leg-length discrepancy and to develop a theory for pre-operative planning. The study included 42 hips of 36 patients with osteonecrosis of the femoral head [25 men and 11 women; mean age at the time of surgery, 33.8 years (range, 17 to 53 years)]. Patients were assessed their clinical and radiological results bofore and after surgery. Additionally, a mathematical model was developed to predict leg shortening after curved intertrochanteric varus osteotomy based on the degree of varus angulation and the distance between the femoral head and osteotomy arc centers. Predicted and actual leg shortening in patients were compared to verify the accuracy of our model. Post-operatively, mean varus angle was 21.7° (range, 15 to 38°) and mean leg shortening was 1.7 mm (range, -5.1 to 11.4 mm). Univariate analysis showed that varus angulation and lateral shift of the osteotomy arc might influence the degree of leg shortening. Furthermore, mathematically predicted leg shortening significantly correlated with actual leg shortening (r = 0.905, p < 0.001), suggesting the usefulness of our model for predicting complications of curved intertrochanteric varus osteotomy. This study indicates the importance of not positioning the center of the osteotomy arc lateral from the center of the femoral head to minimize leg shortening after curved intertrochanteric osteotomy."
https://openalex.org/W2903818085,"Background Canadian penitentiaries have recently been shown to be obesogenic. However, little is known about the eating habits of inmates who gained weight while living in the prison environment. Methods This retrospective cohort study examined the reported food intake of inmates during incarceration in federal penitentiaries. During a face to face interview, anthropometric measures (2016–2017) were taken and compared to anthropometric data at the beginning of incarceration (mean follow-up of 5.0 ± 8.3 years). Self-reported data on food intake were collected via a food frequency questionnaire. Results Inmates who gained the most weight (15.7 kg) during incarceration reported not eating vegetables. They were followed by inmates who gained 14.3 kg and reported not eating fruit. Other inmates who gained a significant amount of weight reported not eating cereal, dairy or legumes. Moreover, inmates’ weight gain was also assessed by special diets: inmates following a religious diet (4.5 kg) or a diet of conscience (-0.3 kg) gained less weight than inmates not following a diet (5.8 kg). In comparison to other types of diets, inmates on a medical diet gained the most weight (7.5 kg). Furthermore, inmates who gained significant weight (8.0 kg) also reported not purchasing healthy foods from the commissary store (or “canteen”), whereas inmates who gained less weight (4.8 kg) reported purchasing healthy foods from the commissary store (or “canteen”). The observed weight gain was positively associated with food purchased from the commissary store (or “canteen”), but was not associated with the feeding system of the penitentiary (tray, cafeteria or meal plan). Discussion Food intake during incarceration is a modifiable risk factor that could be the target of weight management interventions with inmates. Our findings suggest that inmates who gained the most weight also reported having low intake of foods deemed healthy (vegetables, fruit, cereal, dairy and legumes) from food services and from the commissary store (or “canteen”) purchases."
https://openalex.org/W2904118799,"Objective We tested the hypothesis that the expression of IL-33 in MS is dynamic and is likely to reflect the clinical and radiological changes during the course of RRMS. Methods MS with either clinical or radiological relapses were recruited for the study and followed for one year. IL-33 and a panel of genes was measured by q PCR and flow cytometry at different time points. Results Among 22 RRMS patients, 4 patients showed highest levels of IL-33 at the time they were recruited to the study (Month 0); in 14 patients highest levels of IL-33 were seen between 6–11 months after relapse and in 4 patients maximal levels of IL-33 were seen 12 months after relapse. A similar pattern of IL-33 kinetics was seen when IL-33 was measured by flow cytometry in an additional cohort of 12 patients. The timing of the improvement clinically did not correlate with IL-33 expression with highest expression levels either preceding or following clinical recovery. From our whole genome RNA-sequencing data we found a strong correlation between expression levels of IL-33 and a ~2000 mRNA genes. However, none of these genes encoded proteins involved in either innate or adaptive immunity. Rather, many of the genes that correlated highly with IL-33 encoded to proteins involved in DNA repair or mitochondrial function and mRNA splicing pathways. Interpretation Given the neuro-reparative and remodeling functions attributed to IL-33, it is likely that some of the novel genes we have uncovered may be involved in repair and recovery of the CNS in MS."
https://openalex.org/W2950921809,"Spermidine N-acetyltransferase (SpeG) acetylates and thus neutralizes toxic polyamines. Studies indicate that SpeG plays an important role in virulence and pathogenicity of many bacteria, which have evolved SpeG-dependent strategies to control polyamine concentrations and survive in their hosts. In Escherichia coli, the two-component response regulator RcsB is reported to be subject to Nε-acetylation on several lysine residues, resulting in reduced DNA binding affinity and reduced transcription of the small RNA rprA; however, the physiological acetylation mechanism responsible for this behavior has not been fully determined. Here, we performed an acetyltransferase screen and found that SpeG inhibits rprA promoter activity in an acetylation-independent manner. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that SpeG can physically interact with the DNA-binding carboxyl domain of RcsB. We hypothesize that SpeG interacts with the DNA-binding domain of RcsB and that this interaction might be responsible for SpeG-dependent inhibition of RcsB-dependent rprA transcription. This work provides a model for SpeG as a modulator of E. coli transcription through its ability to interact with the transcription factor RcsB. This is the first study to provide evidence that an enzyme involved in polyamine metabolism can influence the function of the global regulator RcsB, which integrates information concerning envelope stresses and central metabolic status to regulate diverse behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2904323502,"Background Among U.S. residents, tuberculosis (TB) disease disproportionally affects non-U.S.-born persons and varies substantially by country of birth. Yet TB disease incidence rates by country of birth are not routinely reported despite these large, known health disparities. This is in part due to the technical challenges of using standard regression analysis with a communicable disease. Here, we estimate tuberculosis disease incidence rates by country of birth and demonstrate methods for overcoming these challenges using TB surveillance data from Los Angeles County which has more than 3.5 million non-U.S.-born residents. Methods Cross-sectional data on 5,447 cases of TB disease from Los Angeles County were combined with population estimates from the American Community Survey to calculate TB disease incidence rates for 2005 through 2011. Adjusted incidence rates were modelled using Poisson and negative binomial regressions. Bayesian models were used to account for the uncertainty in population estimates. Results The unadjusted incidence rate among non-U.S.-born persons was 15 per 100,000 person-years in contrast to the rate among U.S-born persons, 2 per 100,000. The unadjusted incidence rates were 44 and 12 per 100,000 person-years among persons born in the Philippines and Mexico, respectively. In adjusted analysis, persons born in the Philippines were 2.6 (95% CI: 2.3–3.1) times as likely to be reported as a TB case than persons born in Mexico. Bayesian models showed similar results. Conclusion This study confirms substantial disparities in TB disease by country of birth in Los Angeles County. Accounting for age, gender, years in residence and year of diagnosis, persons from the Philippines, Vietnam and several other countries had much higher rates of reported TB disease than other foreign countries. We demonstrated that incidence rates by country of birth can be estimated using available data despite technical challenges."
https://openalex.org/W2904513444,"Analytical CT reconstruction is popular in practice because of its computational efficiency, but it suffers from low reconstruction quality when an insufficient number of projections are used. To address this issue, this paper presents a new analytical method of backprojection Wiener deconvolution (BPWD). BPWD executes backprojection first, and then applies a Wiener deconvolution to the whole backprojected image. The Wiener filter is derived from a ramp filter, enabling the proposed approach to perform reconstruction and denoising simultaneously. The use of a filter after backprojection does not differentiate between real sampled projections and interpolated ones, introducing reconstruction errors. Therefore a weighted ramp filter was applied to increase the contribution of real sampled projections in the reconstruction, thus improving reconstruction quality. Experiments on synthetic data and real phase-contrast x-ray images showed that the proposed approach yields better reconstruction quality compared to the classical filtered backprojection (FBP) method, with comparable reconstruction speed."
https://openalex.org/W2905360623,"Compared to the general population, HIV-infected patients are at higher risk of developing non-AIDS-defining cancers. Chronic HCV infection has also been associated with a higher risk than that of the general population of developing cancers other than hepatocarcinoma. Evaluation of the impact of HCV-related factors on non-AIDS-defining and non HCV-liver (NANL) related cancers among HIV/HCV co-infected patients are scarce. The aim of this study was to identify the impact of HIV/HCV clinical characteristics on NANL related cancers in a large cohort of HIV/HCV-coinfected patients followed from 2005 to 2017. Cox proportional hazards models with delayed entry were used to estimate factors associated with NANL related cancer. Among 1391 patients followed for a median of 5 years, 60 patients developed NANL related cancers, yielding an incidence rate of 8.9 per 1000 person-years (95% CI, [6.6-11.1]). By final multivariable analysis, after adjustment for sex, tobacco or alcohol consumption, baseline CD4 cell count and HCV sustained viral response (SVR), age and a longer duration since HIV diagnosis were independently associated with a higher risk of NANL related cancer (aHR for each additional year 1.10, 95% CI 1.06-1.14, p<0.0001 and 1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.11, p = 0.02, respectively). Duration of HCV infection, cirrhosis, HCV viral load, genotype and SVR were not associated with the occurrence of NANL related cancer. Among HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, age and the duration of HIV infection were the only characteristics found to be associated with the occurrence of NANL related cancer. In contrast, no association was observed with any HCV-related variables."
https://openalex.org/W2905409790,"The bacterium Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is the etiological agent of Contagious Porcine Pleuropneumonia, a disease responsible for economic losses in the swine industry worldwide. A. pleuropneumoniae is capable of producing proteinaceous exotoxins responsible for inducing hemorrhagic lesions, one of which is ApxI. Few studies have conducted an in-depth evaluation of polymorphisms of the nucleotides that make up the ApxI toxin gene. Here we analyze the polymorphisms of the apxIA gene region of A. pleuropneumoniae serovar 5 isolated from swine in different regions in Brazil and report the results of molecular sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Analysis of the apxIA gene in 60 isolates revealed the presence of genetic diversity and variability. The polymorphisms in the nucleotide sequences determined the grouping of the Brazilian sequences and five more sequences from the GenBank database into 14 different haplotypes, which formed three main groups and revealed the presence of mutations in the nucleotide sequences. The estimation of selection pressures suggests the occurrence of genetic variations by positive selective pressure on A. pleuropneumoniae in large groups of animals in relatively small spaces. These conditions presumably favor the horizontal dissemination of apxIA gene mutations within bacterial populations with host reservoirs. As a result, the same serovar can demonstrate different antigenic capacities due to mutations in the apxIA gene. These alterations in sequences of the apxIA gene could occur in other areas of countries with intense swine production, which could lead to differences in the pathogenicity and immunogenicity of each serovar and have implications for the clinical status or diagnosis of A. pleuropneumoniae."
