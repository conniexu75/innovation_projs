Previous studies demonstrated that Skn-1a/Pou2f3, a POU homeodomain transcription factor is expressed in these Trpm5-expressing chemosensory cells, and is necessary for their generation. Trpm5-expressing cells have recently been found in trachea, auditory tube, urethra, thymus, pancreatic duct, stomach, and large intestine. They are considered to be involved in protective responses to potential hazardous compounds as Skn-1a-dependent bitter taste cells, respiratory solitary chemosensory cells, and intestinal tuft cells are. In this study, we examined the expression and function of Skn-1a/Pou2f3 in Trpm5-expressing cells in trachea, auditory tube, urethra, thymus, pancreatic duct, stomach, and large intestine. Skn-1a/Pou2f3 is expressed in a majority of Trpm5-expressing cells in all tissues examined. In Skn-1a/Pou2f3-deficient mice, the expression of Trpm5 as well as marker genes for Trpm5-expressing cells were absent in all tested tissues. Immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated that two types of microvillous cells exist in trachea, urethra, and thymus, Trpm5-positive and Trpm5-negative cells. In Skn-1a/Pou2f3-deficient mice, a considerable proportion of Trpm5-negative and villin-positive microvillous cells remained present in these tissues. Thus, we propose that Skn-1a/Pou2f3 is the master regulator for the generation of the Trpm5-expressing microvillous cells in multiple tissues."

Platelet activity can be inferred by platelet volume indices (PVIs), which include platelet distribution width (PDW), mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width-to-platelet count ratio (PDW/P), and mean platelet volume-to-platelet count ratio. Platelets and platelet-related markers, such as the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, have been found to be significant prognostic factors in patients with breast cancer. However, the role of PVIs for predicting survival in breast cancer remains unknown; hence, we performed this retrospective analysis of 275 patients with breast cancer. PVIs were compared with clinicopathological variables, and were assessed to identify independent indicators associated with disease-free survival (DFS) using the Cox proportional hazards model. An elevated PDW/P significantly correlated with age and HER2 status. Univariate analysis revealed that elevated PDW, MPV, and PDW/P as well as tumor size, nuclear grade, and lymph node involvement were significantly associated with inferior DFS rates (tumor size: p<0.01; nuclear grade, lymph node involvement, PDW, MPV, and PDW/P: p<0.05). On multivariate analysis, a large tumor size and elevated PDW/P were significant prognostic factors for DFS, with hazard ratios of 3.24 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.24–8.47) and 2.99 (95% CI: 1.18–7.57), respectively (p<0.05). Our study is the first to reveal that an elevated PDW/P significantly reduces DFS in patients with breast carcinoma. Measuring the PDW/P is simple, relatively inexpensive, and almost universally available using routine blood counts; this makes it an attractive biomarker for improved risk assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2772947399,"Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is a widely used model cyanobacterium, whose substrains can vary on both genotype and phenotype levels. Previously described phenotypic variations include ability of mixotrophic growth, ability of movement on agar plates and variations in pigments composition or cell size. In this study, we report for the first time significant variation among Synechocystis substrains in complex cellular traits such as growth rate, photosynthesis efficiency, cellular dry weight and cellular composition (including protein or carbohydrates content). We also confirmed previously reported differences in cell size. Synechocystis cultures were cultivated in controlled environment of flat panel photobioreactors under red, blue and white light of intensities up to 790 μmol(photons) m-2 s-1, temperatures 23°C-60°C, input CO2 concentrations ranging from 400 to 15 000 ppm and in BG11 cultivation medium with and without addition of NaCl. Three Synechocystis substrains were used for the comparative experiments: GT-L, GT-B (Brno, CZ) and PCC-B (Brno, CZ). Growth rates of Synechocystis GT-B were inhibited under high intensities of red light (585-670 nm), and growth rates of both substrains GT-B and PCC-B were inhibited under photons of wavelengths 485-585 nm and 670-700 nm. Synechocystis GT-B was more sensitive to low temperatures than the other two tested substrains, and Synechocystis GT-L was sensitive to the presence of NaCl in the cultivation media. The results suggest that stress sensitivity of commonly used Synechocystis substrains can strongly vary, similarly as glucose tolerance or motility as reported previously. Our study further supports the previous statement that emphasizes importance of proper Synechocystis substrains selection and awareness of phenotypical differences among Synechocystis substrains which is crucial for comparative and reproducible research. This is highly relevant for studies related to stress physiology and development of sustainable biotechnological applications."
https://openalex.org/W2771573479,"Introduction Prior studies demonstrated marked increases in Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in the United States (U.S.) in recent years. The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiology of initial and recurrent CDI in a national Veterans Health Administration (VHA) cohort over a 12-year period. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of all adult VHA beneficiaries with CDI (ICD-9-CM code 008.45) plus a positive CDI stool test between October 1, 2002 and September 30, 2014. Data were obtained from the VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure. Recurrence was defined as a second ICD-9-CM code plus a new course of CDI therapy following a minimum three-day gap after the initial therapy was completed. CDI incidence and outcomes were presented descriptively and longitudinally. Results Overall, 30,326 patients met study inclusion criteria. CDI incidence increased from FY 2003 (1.6 per 10,000) to FY 2013 (5.1 per 10,000). Thereafter, CDI incidence decreased through FY 2014 (4.6 per 10,000). A total of 5,011 patients (17%) experienced a first recurrence and, of those, 1,713 (34%) experienced a second recurrence. Recurrence incidence increased 10-fold over the study period, from (0.1 per 10,000) in FY 2003, to (1.0 per 10,000) in FY 2014. Overall, 30-day mortality and median hospital length of stay (LOS) decreased among initial episodes over the study period. Mortality was higher for initial episodes (21%) compared to first recurrences (11%) and second recurrences (7%). Median hospital LOS was longer for first episodes (13 days) compared to first (9 days) and second recurrences (8 days). Conclusions Initial and recurrent CDI episodes increased among veterans over a 12-year period. Outcomes, such as mortality and hospital LOS improved in recent years; both of these outcomes are worse for initial CDI episodes than recurrent episodes."
https://openalex.org/W2774040950,"Many outstanding questions about the evolution and function of fish morphology are linked to swimming dynamics, and a detailed knowledge of time-varying forces and torques along the animal’s body is a key component in answering many of these questions. Yet, quantifying these forces and torques experimentally represents a major challenge that to date prevents a full understanding of fish-like swimming. Here, we develop a method for obtaining these force and torque data non-invasively using standard 2D digital particle image velocimetry in conjunction with a pressure field algorithm. We use a mechanical flapping foil apparatus to model fish-like swimming and measure forces and torques directly with a load cell, and compare these measured values to those estimated simultaneously using our pressure-based approach. We demonstrate that, when out-of-plane flows are relatively small compared to the planar flow, and when pressure effects sufficiently dominate shear effects, this technique is able to accurately reproduce the shape, magnitude, and timing of locomotor forces and torques experienced by a fish-like swimmer. We conclude by exploring of the limits of this approach and its feasibility in the study of freely-swimming fishes."
https://openalex.org/W2773227838,"Rice cultivation has been challenged by increasing food demand and water scarcity. We examined the responses of water use, grain yield, and water productivity to various modes of field water managements in Chinese double rice systems. Four treatments were studied in a long-term field experiment (1998–2015): continuous flooding (CF), flooding—midseason drying—flooding (F-D-F), flooding—midseason drying—intermittent irrigation without obvious standing water (F-D-S), and flooding—rain-fed (F-RF). The average precipitation was 483 mm in early-rice season and 397 mm in late-rice season. The irrigated water for CF, F-D-F, F-D-S, and F-RF, respectively, was 263, 340, 279, and 170 mm in early-rice season, and 484, 528, 422, and 206 mm in late-rice season. Grain yield for CF, F-D-F, F-D-S, and F-RF, respectively, was 4,722, 4,597, 4,479, and 4,232 kgha-1 in early-rice season, and 5,420, 5,402, 5,366, and 4,498 kgha-1 in late-rice season. Compared with CF, F-D-F consumed more irrigated water, which still decreased grain yield, leading to a decrease in water productivity by 25% in early-rice season and by 8% in late-rice season. Compared with F-D-F, F-D-S saved much irrigated water with a small yield reduction, leading to an increase in water productivity by 22% in early-rice season and by 26% in late-rice season. The results indicate that CF is best for early-rice and FDS is best for late-rice in terms of grain yield and water productivity."
https://openalex.org/W2771486503,"The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of diabetes control induced by Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy(RY) vs Billroth-I reconstruction(BI) after distal gastrectomy in patients with early gastric cancer(EGC) and type 2 diabetes(T2DM). Forty EGC patients with T2DM, aged 20–80 years, who were expected to undergo curative distal gastrectomy were randomized 1:1 to RY(n = 20) or BI(n = 20). Diabetes medication status, biochemical and hormonal data including blood glucose, HbA1c, insulin, C-peptide, HOMA-IR, ghrelin, leptin, GLP-1, PYY, and GIP were evaluated for 12 months after surgery. Although pre- and postoperative 12-month fasting and postprandial glucose levels did not show a significant difference, HbA1c, C-peptide, and HOMA-IR levels were significantly improved at 12 months after surgery in both BI and RY groups. Sixty percent of RY patients and 20% of BI patients decreased their medication satisfying FBS<126 mg/dL and HbA1c<6.5% and 5% of BI patients stopped their medication satisfying the criteria of FBS<126 mg/dL and HbA1c<6.0%. The improvement patterns were more sustainable with less fluctuation in RY than in BI. On hormonal analysis, ghrelin and leptin levels were decreased and PYY and GIP levels were increased at 12 months after surgery in both groups without significant difference according to the reconstruction type and diabetic improvement status except ghrelin. In gastric cancer surgery, RY reconstruction showed better and more durable diabetes control compared to BI during the first year after surgery. Gastric cancer surgery led to decreased ghrelin and leptin and increased PYY and GIP, which might have a role in improving insulin resistance and glucose homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2774827227,"Forest inventories require estimates and measures of uncertainty for subpopulations such as management units. These units often times hold a small sample size, so they should be regarded as small areas. When auxiliary information is available, different small area estimation methods have been proposed to obtain reliable estimates for small areas. Unit level empirical best linear unbiased predictors (EBLUP) based on plot or grid unit level models have been studied more thoroughly than area level EBLUPs, where the modelling occurs at the management unit scale. Area level EBLUPs do not require a precise plot positioning and allow the use of variable radius plots, thus reducing fieldwork costs. However, their performance has not been examined thoroughly. We compared unit level and area level EBLUPs, using LiDAR auxiliary information collected for inventorying 98,104 ha coastal coniferous forest. Unit level models were consistently more accurate than area level EBLUPs, and area level EBLUPs were consistently more accurate than field estimates except for large management units that held a large sample. For stand density, volume, basal area, quadratic mean diameter, mean height and Lorey's height, root mean squared errors (rmses) of estimates obtained using area level EBLUPs were, on average, 1.43, 2.83, 2.09, 1.40, 1.32 and 1.64 times larger than those based on unit level estimates, respectively. Similarly, direct field estimates had rmses that were, on average, 1.37, 1.45, 1.17, 1.17, 1.26, and 1.38 times larger than rmses of area level EBLUPs. Therefore, area level models can lead to substantial gains in accuracy compared to direct estimates, and unit level models lead to very important gains in accuracy compared to area level models, potentially justifying the additional costs of obtaining accurate field plot coordinates."
https://openalex.org/W2773706440,"Background Children spend a significant portion of their days in sedentary behavior (SB) and on average fail to engage in adequate physical activity (PA). The school built environment may influence SB and PA, but research is limited. This natural experiment evaluated whether an elementary school designed to promote movement impacted students’ school-time SB and PA. Methods Accelerometers measured SB and PA at pre and post time-points in an intervention group who moved to the new school (n = 21) and in a comparison group experiencing no school environmental change (n = 20). Difference-in-difference (DD) analysis examined SB and PA outcomes in these groups. Measures were also collected post-intervention from an independent, grade-matched group of students in the new school (n = 21). Results As expected, maturational increases in SB were observed. However, DD analysis estimated that the intervention attenuated increase in SB by 81.2 ± 11.4 minutes/day (p<0.001), controlling for time in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). The intervention was also estimated to increase daily number of breaks from SB by 23.4 ± 2.6 (p < .001) and to increase light physical activity (LPA) by 67.7 ± 10.7 minutes/day (p<0.001). However, the intervention decreased MVPA by 10.3 ± 2.3 minutes/day (p<0.001). Results of grade-matched independent samples analysis were similar, with students in the new vs. old school spending 90.5 ± 16.1 fewer minutes/day in SB, taking 21.1 ± 2.7 more breaks from SB (p<0.001), and spending 64.5 ± 14.8 more minutes in LPA (p<0.001), controlling for time in MVPA. Students in the new school spent 13.1 ± 2.7 fewer minutes in MVPA (p<0.001) than their counterparts in the old school. Conclusions This pilot study found that active school design had beneficial effects on SB and LPA, but not on MVPA. Mixed results point to a need for active classroom design strategies to mitigate SB, and quick access from classrooms to areas permissive of high-intensity activities to promote MVPA. Integrating active design with programs/policies to promote PA may yield greatest impact on PA of all intensities."
https://openalex.org/W2774124527,"This study investigated the acute effects of fatiguing foot muscle exercises on the maximum muscle strength of the foot and postural control ability. Eighteen healthy young individuals performed fatiguing foot muscle strength exercises, and their toe flexor and ankle plantar flexor strength and postural control ability were measured before and after the exercises. Postural control ability was evaluated using the path of the center of pressure (COP) during three balance tasks: double-leg standing with eyes open; double-leg standing with eyes closed; and single-leg standing with eyes open. After the exercises, the muscle strength of both the toe and ankle plantar flexor significantly decreased. Under all of the conditions, most COP variables did not significantly differ before and after the exercises; however, the total length and mean velocity in the single-leg standing with eyes open significantly decreased after the exercises. Postural sway velocities in the anteroposterior direction of double-leg standing with eyes closed and in both anteroposterior and mediolateral directions of single-leg standing with eyes open significantly decreased after the exercises. The associations between relative changes in muscle strength after the exercise and relative changes in COP variables after the exercise were not found. These results indicate that postural control while standing could be maintained even though foot muscle strength is decreased after fatiguing foot muscle exercises."
https://openalex.org/W2774432807,"Evolutionary studies often assume that energy is the primary resource (i.e. ""currency"") at the heart of the survival-reproduction trade-off, despite recent evidence to the contrary. The evolutionary consequences of having a single trade-off currency versus multiple competing currencies are unknown. Using simulations, we modeled the evolution of either a single physiological currency between reproduction and survival, or of multiple such currencies. For a wide array of model specifications varying functional forms and strengths of the trade-offs, we show that the presence of multiple currencies (e.g. nutrients, time) generally results in the evolution of higher lifetime reproductive success through partial circumvention of such trade-offs. Evolution of the underlying physiology is also more highly contingent with multiple currencies. These results challenge the paradigm of a single survival-reproduction trade-off as central to life history evolution, suggesting greater roles for physiological constraints and contingency, and implying potential selection for evolution of multiple trade-off currencies."
https://openalex.org/W2772739091,"The natural history and treatment outcome of hepatitis B viruses (HBV) infection is largely dependent on genotype, subgenotype, and the presence or absence of virulence associated mutations. We have studied the prevalence of genotype and subgenotype as well as virulence and drug resistance associated mutations and prevalence of recombinant among HBV from Bangladesh. A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted among treatment naïve chronic HBV patients attending at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka, Bangladesh for HBV viral load assessment between June and August 2015. Systematical selected 50% of HBV DNA positive patients (every second patient) were enrolled. Biochemical and serological markers for HBV infection and whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on virus positive sample. Genotype, subgenotype, virulence, nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) resistance (NAr) mutations, and the prevalence of recombinant isolates were determined. Among 114 HBV DNA positive patients, 57 were enrolled in the study and 53 HBV WGS were generated for downstream analysis. Overall, 38% (22/57) and 62% (35/57) of patients had acute and chronic HBV infections, respectively. The prevalence of genotypes A, C, and D was 18.9% (10/53), 45.3% (24/53), and 35.8% (19/53), respectively. Among genotype A, C and D isolates subgenotype A1 (90%; 9/10), C1 (87.5%; 21/24) and D2 (78.9%; 15/19) predominates. The acute infection, virulence associated mutations, and viral load was higher in the genotype D isolates. Evidence of recombination was identified in 22.6% (12/53) of the HBV isolates including 20.0% (2/10), and 16.7% (4/24) and 31.6% (6/19) of genotype A, C and D isolates, respectively. The prevalence of recombination was higher in chronic HVB patients (32.2%; 10/31 versus 9.1%; 2/22); p<0.05. NAr mutations were identified in 47.2% (25/53) of the isolates including 33.9% novel mutations (18/53). HBV genotype C and D predominated in this population in Bangladesh; a comparatively high prevalence of recombinant HBV are circulating in this setting."
https://openalex.org/W2774695061,"Purpose Despite plausible mechanisms, the clinical significance of long-term proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use to colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between PPI use and CRC development. Methods We conducted a population-based prospective cohort study using the Korean nationwide claims database merged with national health examination data. The study cohort included a total of 451,284 participants who were tracked to identify cases of CRC since 2007. We assessed and standardized PPI use before the index date using the Defined Daily Dose system. We calculated the hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals to assess the association between PPI use and CRC occurrence using Cox proportional hazard regression models with adjustment for potential confounders. We performed subgroup analyses of the effect of PPI exposure on CRC development stratified by the CRC risk. Results There were 5,304 cases of CRC during the study period of 2,908,152 person-years. PPI use was not associated with CRC risk overall. The incidence of CRC was higher among individuals who were elderly, male, more obese, and drank alcohol more frequently and among those who had more comorbidities. Further subgroup analyses revealed that the hazard effect of PPI use increased linearly in a dose-dependent manner with the number of CRC risk factors for which the risk level was considered low. Conclusion Within the low-risk population, PPI use was associated with an increased risk of CRC, although the association did not weigh the effects of conventional risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2771425514,"B18R protein of Vaccinia virus binds to type I interferons and inhibits activation of interferon-mediated signal transduction. Cells which have unimpaired interferon signaling such as primary cell cultures or some industrially important cell lines are capable of development of an antiviral state. An establishment of the antiviral state limits replication of RNA-viruses and can suppress replication of RNA vectors. The interferon inhibitor B18R effectively prevents the establishment of the antiviral state. For this reason, B18R has become a ubiquitous component of protocols for epigenetic reprogramming which use transfections of RNA replicons or mRNA. Despite wide practical applicability, commercially available B18R is predominantly produced in cell cultures and little information has been published on a production and use of bacterially expressed B18R. Objectives of this study were to produce B18R in an E.coli expression system and to confirm the product's biological activity by using it to maintain RNA-vectors in cell cultures capable of the antiviral state. The described method allows the expression and efficient refolding to obtain 10-100 mg of B18R from a small-scale culture and the production process is economically attractive compared to a use of an eukaryotic expression. To check for a presence of the biological activity of bacterially-expressed B18R the protein was used to support persistence of an autonomously replicating RNA-vector in a cell culture which is capable of the antiviral state. A RNA-containing virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE) can serve as an efficient vector for heterologous expression in cell cultures, although its replication is sensitive to the effects of type I interferons which limit a range of cell lines for a use with this vector. The VEE replicon was utilized to direct an expression of recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). The producing replicon could persist in HEK293 cells for sufficiently long time only in presence of B18R, whereas addition of B18R not only allowed persistence of the replicon but also increased production from the replicon. A model product granulocyte colony stimulating factor accumulated to 35.5 μg/ml during a 7 day experiment. This work describes efficacious expression and refolding of the viral cytokine inhibitor and demonstrates a utility of bacterially-expressed B18R."
https://openalex.org/W2771282604,"Boosted Regression Trees. Excellent for data-poor spatial management but hard to use Marine resource managers and scientists often advocate spatial approaches to manage data-poor species. Existing spatial prediction and management techniques are either insufficiently robust, struggle with sparse input data, or make suboptimal use of multiple explanatory variables. Boosted Regression Trees feature excellent performance and are well suited to modelling the distribution of data-limited species, but are extremely complicated and time-consuming to learn and use, hindering access for a wide potential user base and therefore limiting uptake and usage. BRTs automated and simplified for accessible general use with rich feature set We have built a software suite in R which integrates pre-existing functions with new tailor-made functions to automate the processing and predictive mapping of species abundance data: by automating and greatly simplifying Boosted Regression Tree spatial modelling, the gbm.auto R package suite makes this powerful statistical modelling technique more accessible to potential users in the ecological and modelling communities. The package and its documentation allow the user to generate maps of predicted abundance, visualise the representativeness of those abundance maps and to plot the relative influence of explanatory variables and their relationship to the response variables. Databases of the processed model objects and a report explaining all the steps taken within the model are also generated. The package includes a previously unavailable Decision Support Tool which combines estimated escapement biomass (the percentage of an exploited population which must be retained each year to conserve it) with the predicted abundance maps to generate maps showing the location and size of habitat that should be protected to conserve the target stocks (candidate MPAs), based on stakeholder priorities, such as the minimisation of fishing effort displacement. Gbm.auto for management in various settings By bridging the gap between advanced statistical methods for species distribution modelling and conservation science, management and policy, these tools can allow improved spatial abundance predictions, and therefore better management, decision-making, and conservation. Although this package was built to support spatial management of a data-limited marine elasmobranch fishery, it should be equally applicable to spatial abundance modelling, area protection, and stakeholder engagement in various scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W2775117248,"This study aimed to investigate the effects of three major representative exercises (resistance, flexibility, and walking) on quality of life (QoL) in a population of community-dwelling older adults.This cross-sectional study used public data from the Sixth Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2014 (n = 1,586 older people). Demographic factors, three types of exercise, five EuroQoL subsets (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression), and QoL scores (EQ-VAS) were investigated. The independent associations between each exercise and the five QoL subsets were determined using odds ratios (OR) adjusted for three demographic factors (age group, sex, and area of residence), using multivariate logistic regression analysis.The EQ-VAS scores of the exercisers was significantly higher than those of the non-exercisers for all exercise types. Subjects with problems in mobility dimension performed less exercise of all types of than those with normal mobility (resistance: OR, 0.687; flexibility: OR, 0.733, and walking: OR, 0.489). The self-care dimension was independently correlated with flexibility (OR, 0.558) and walking (OR, 0.485).All types of exercisers showed higher QoL scores than non-exercisers. Among the QoL dimensions, mobility and self-care were independently associated with flexibility and walking exercise in this older people, suggesting that engaging in regular flexibility and walking exercise is important for achieving higher QoL in the older people."
https://openalex.org/W2775194168,"Potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 15 (Kctd15) was previously found to have a role in early neural crest (NC) patterning, specifically delimiting the region where NC markers are expressed via repression of transcription factor AP-2a and inhibition of Wnt signaling. We used transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) to generate null mutations in zebrafish kctd15a and kctd15b paralogs to study the in vivo role of Kctd15. We found that while deletions producing frame-shift mutations in each paralog showed no apparent phenotype, kctd15a/b double mutant zebrafish are smaller in size and show several phenotypes including some affecting the NC, such as expansion of the early NC domain, increased pigmentation, and craniofacial defects. Both melanophore and xanthophore pigment cell numbers and early markers are up-regulated in the double mutants. While we find no embryonic craniofacial defects, adult mutants have a deformed maxillary segment and missing barbels. By confocal imaging of mutant larval brains we found that the torus lateralis (TLa), a region implicated in gustatory networks in other fish, is absent. Ablation of this brain tissue in wild type larvae mimics some aspects of the mutant growth phenotype. Thus kctd15 mutants show deficits in the development of both neural crest derivatives, and specific regions within the central nervous system, leading to a strong reduction in normal growth rates."

The current study investigated the association between changes in BMI and all-cause, CV, and non-CV mortality in a large cohort of middle-aged adults.A total of 379,535 adults over 40 years of age without pre-existing CV disease or cancer at baseline were enrolled to undergo a series of at least three health examinations of biennial intervals. Changes in BMI between baseline, midpoint follow-up, and final health examination during mean 9.3 years were defined according to the pattern of BMI change as follows: stable, sustained gain, sustained loss, and fluctuation. The relationship between BMI change category and mortality was assessed by multivariate Cox regression reporting hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI).During a mean follow-up of 10.7 years for mortality, 12,378 deaths occurred from all causes, of which 2,114 were CV and 10,264 were non-CV deaths. Sustained BMI gain was associated with the lower risk of all-cause (HR 0.89, 95% CI: 0.83-0.95), CV (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72-0.98), and non-CV mortality (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.84-0.96) compared with stable BMI. Conversely, sustained BMI loss (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.19-1.32) and fluctuation (HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.08-1.19) displayed a higher risk of all-cause mortality compared with stable BMI, which was mainly attributable to the increase in non-CV mortality.Sustained BMI gains were associated with reduced risk of all-cause, CV, and non-CV mortality in middle-aged healthy adults."
https://openalex.org/W2772396503,"The association between migraine and narcolepsy remains controversial. We aim to investigate whether migraine is associated with an increased risk of developing narcolepsy in children.In this longitudinal study, nationwide medical-claims data of pediatric patients (0-17y) with migraine are identified using the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) between 1997 and 2010 in Taiwan. Two cohorts are selected: migraine cases (n = 8,923) and propensity score-matched non-migraine controls (n = 35,692). Children with previous history of narcolepsy or headache before the index date are excluded. Cohorts are followed until the end of 2012, their withdrawal from the NHI program, or incidence of narcolepsy (ICD-9-CM: 347). Cox proportional hazards regression models are used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals of developing narcolepsy in children with migraine compared to their non-migraine controls.A total of 13 incident cases with narcolepsy are observed during follow-up, with incidence rates of 0.1915 and 0.0278 per 1,000 person-years in migraine and non-migraine children, respectively. After a mean follow-up period of 4.68 and 5.04 years in the case and control cohort, respectively, the former exhibited a greater risk of developing narcolepsy compared to the latter (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 5.30, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.61, 17.4; p = 0.006). This finding persisted after controlling for potential confounders like baseline comorbidities and concurrent medication uptake, and in our analyses with migraine subtypes.Migraine is an independent risk factor for narcolepsy development in children. Further studies are needed to validate our findings and to explore the exact pathophysiological mechanisms linking migraine and narcolepsy."
https://openalex.org/W2772937956,"Conifers have complex defense responses to initial attacks by insects and pathogens that can have cascading effects on success of subsequent colonizers. However, drought can affect a plant’s ability to respond to biotic agents by potentially altering the resources needed for the energetically costly production of induced defense chemicals. We investigated the impact of reduced water on induced chemical defenses of jack pine (Pinus banksiana) seedlings from initial attack by biotic agents and resistance to subsequent challenge inoculation with a pathogenic fungal associate of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae), Grosmannia clavigera. Applications of phytohormones (methyl salicylate and methyl jasmonate) and G. clavigera were used for initial induction of defenses. Monoterpene concentrations varied with initial induction from fungal and phytohormone application while watering treatment had no effect. Seedlings treated with G. clavigera and methyl jasmonate had the greatest monoterpene concentrations compared to the control and methyl salicylate-treated seedlings. However, the monoterpene response to the challenge inoculation varied with watering treatments, not with prior induction treatments, with lower monoterpene concentrations in fungal lesions on seedlings in the low to moderate watering treatments compared to normal watering treatment. Furthermore, prior induction from phytohormones resulted in systemic cross-induction of resistance to G. clavigera under normal watering treatment but susceptibility under low watering treatment. Seedlings stressed by low water conditions, which also had lower stomatal conductance than seedlings in the normal watering treatment, likely allocated resources to initial defense response but were left unable to acquire further resources for subsequent responses. Our results demonstrate that drought can affect interactions among tree-infesting organisms through systemic cross-induction of susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W2773930134,"Background Clinical accuracy of IGRAs remains unclear on patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs). Here, we assess the impact of immunosuppressants and IMIDs on QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFN-G-IT) and T-SPOT.TB accuracy. Methods Patients with IMIDs who required latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) screening were enrolled and classified into: (i) 50 patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases, (ii) 50 patients with psoriasis and (iii) 30 patients with Crohn’s disease. A total of 44 healthy individuals without immunosuppression were also included as controls. Tuberculin skin test (TST), T-SPOT.TB and QFN-G-IT assays were performed. IGRAs were performed following manufacturer’s instructions. Results Immunosuppressant’s intake was more frequent on patients with Crohn’s disease and psoriasis. Positive IGRAs and TST results were reduced in Crohn’s disease patients, whereas rate of indeterminate T-SPOT.TB results was increased in this group with respect to the other IMIDs analysed and controls. When IFN-γ response was studied, the levels of this cytokine after mitogen stimulation were significantly lower in Crohn’s and inflammatory rheumatic diseases than in psoriasis. Interestingly, psoriatic patients were the only ones not receiving corticosteroids. Furthermore, a negative correlation was observed between the IFN-γ secreted after mitogen stimulation and corticosteroids dose. Conclusions IMIDs seem to negatively affect the clinical accuracy of IGRAs, being Crohn’s disease patients the most affected individuals due to their concomitant drug-profile and impaired immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2774490912,"Environmental factors or adverse growth conditions that may reduce cell function or viability are considered stress. The cell ability to sense and respond to environmental stresses determine its function and survival destiny. We recently defined Neuroglobin (NGB), a heme-protein, as a compensatory protein in the 17β-Estradiol (E2) anti-apoptotic activity and as a sensor of oxidative stress in both neurons and breast cancer cells. Here, the possibility that NGB levels could represent a pivotal regulator of integrated response of cancer cells to stress has been evaluated. Data obtained in neuroblastoma and in breast cancer cell lines evidence that nutrient deprivation significantly up-regulated NGB levels at different time points. However, the analysis of autophagy activation led to exclude any possible role of stress- or E2-induced NGB in the upstream regulation of general autophagy. However, the over-expression of Flag-NGB in ERα stable transfected HEK-293 cells completely affects nutrient deprivation-induced decrease in cell number. In addition, reported results indicate that modulation of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 level may play a key role in the protective NGB function against energetic stress. Overall, these data define a role of NGB as compensatory protein in the cell machinery activated in response to stress and as general stress adaptation marker of cancer cells susceptible to oxidative stress, oxygen and, as demonstrated here for the first time, even to nutrient willingness. Despite the lacking of any direct NGB role on autophagic flux activated by energetic stress, NGB upregulation appears functional in delaying stress-related cell death allowing an appropriate cell response and adaptation to the changing extracellular conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2775330882,"Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are in numerous cell therapy clinical trials, including for injured myocardium. Acquisition of cardiomyocyte characteristics by MSCs may improve cardiac regeneration but the mechanisms regulating this process are unclear. Here, we investigated whether the pluripotency transcription factor OCT4 is involved in the activation of cardiac lineage genetic programs in MSCs. We employed our established co-culture model of MSCs with rat embryonic cardiomyocytes showing co-expression of cardiac markers on MSCs independent of cell fusion. Bone marrow-derived MSCs were isolated from transgenic mice expressing GFP under the control of the cardiac-specific α-myosin heavy chain promoter. After 5 days of co-culture, MSCs expressed cardiac specific genes, including Nkx2.5, atrial natriuretic factor and α-cardiac actin. The frequency of GFP+ cells was 7.6±1.9%, however, these cells retained the stromal cell phenotype, indicating, as expected, only partial differentiation. Global OCT4 expression increased 2.6±0.7-fold in co-cultured MSCs and of interest, 87±5% vs 79±4% of MSCs expressed OCT4 by flow cytometry in controls and after co-culture, respectively. Consistent with the latter observation, the GFP+ cells did not express nuclear OCT4 and showed a significant increase in OCT4 promoter methylation compared with undifferentiated MSCs (92% vs 45%), inferring that OCT4 is regulated by an epigenetic mechanism. We further showed that siRNA silencing of OCT4 in MSCs resulted in a reduced frequency of GFP+ cells in co-culture to less than 1%. Our data infer that OCT4 expression may have a direct effect on partial cardiomyocyte reprogramming of MSCs and suggest a new mechanism(s) associated with MSC multipotency and a requirement for crosstalk with the cardiac microenvironment."

The area under the curve (AUC) representing the contractility of smooth muscle strips was calculated.(1) The four living probiotics inhibited the contractility of human colonic muscle strips only at high concentration (1010 CFUs/mL, all P<0.05). (2) The sonicated cell fractions from the four probiotics obviously inhibited human colonic smooth muscle strips in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.01). (3) The CFS from the four probiotics also inhibited colonic smooth muscle strips in a dose-dependent manner (all P<0.05). (4) The inhibition effect of CFS from Streptococcus thermophilus and Enterococcus faecalis decreased obviously when pretreated with NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA, 10-5 mol/L) (P<0.05), but not the Bifidobacterium longum and Lactobacillus acidophilus (P>0.05).Four common probiotics related products, including the sonicated cell fractions and the CFS, obviously inhibited human colonic smooth muscles strips contraction in a dose-dependent manner. Only high concentration living probiotics (1010 CFUs/mL) can inhibit the colonic smooth muscles strips contraction. The NO pathway may be partly involved in the inhibitory effect of CFS from Streptococcus thermophilus and Enterococcus faecalis."

However, its renoprotective effect and safety remain uncertain in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). From January 1, 2000 through June 30, 2009, we enrolled 14,117 pre-dialytic stage 5 CKD patients with serum creatinine >6mg/dL and hematocrit <28% under the treatment with erythropoiesis stimulating agents and RAS blockade. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) against the commencement of long-term dialysis and all-cause mortality for ACEI/ARB users. Over a median follow-up of 7 months, 9,867 patients (69.9%) required long-term dialysis and 2,805 (19.9%) died before progression to end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. In comparison with the ARB-only users, dual blockade with ACEIs and ARBs was associated with a significantly higher risk of (1) death in all CKD patients (HR = 1.49, [95%CI, 1.30–1.71]; P = 0.02) and in diabetic subgroup (HR = 1.58, [95%CI, 1.34–1.86]; P = 0.02); (2) composite endpoint of long-term dialysis or death in diabetic subgroup (HR = 1.10, [95%CI, 1.01–1.20]; P = 0.04); (3) hyperkalemia-associated hospitalization in non-diabetic subgroup (HR, 2.74, [95%CI, 1.05–7.15]; P = 0.04). However, ACEIs users were associated with higher mortality than ARBs users in all CKD patients (HR = 1.17, [95%CI, 1.07–1.27]; P = 0.03) and in diabetic subgroup (HR = 1.32, [95%CI, 1.18–1.48]; P = 0.03). Monotherapy of RAS blockade, especially ARB, is more effective and safer than dual RAS blockade in pre-dialytic stage 5 CKD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2774681187,"Background and aims We developed a bio-artificial liver (BAL) using a radial-flow bioreactor and rescued mini-pig models with lethal acute liver failure (ALF). The point of the rescue is the recovery from hepatic encephalopathy (HE). HE on ALF has sometimes resulted in brain death following brain edema with astrocyte swelling. Several factors, including ammonia and glutamine, have been reported to induce astrocyte swelling and injury. However, many clinicians believe that there are any other factors involved in the development of HE. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify novel HE-inducible factors, particularly those inducing astrocyte dysfunction. Methods Mini-pig plasma samples were collected at three time points: before the administration of toxins (α-amanitin and LPS), when HE occurred after the administration of toxins, and after treatment with extracorporeal circulation (EC) by the BAL. To identify the causative factors of HE, each plasma sample was subjected to a comparative proteome analysis with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. To assess the direct effects of candidate factors on the astrocyte function and injury, in vitro experiments with human astrocytes were performed. Results Using a proteome analysis, we identified alpha-1 antichymotrypsin (ACT), which was increased in plasma samples from mini-pigs with HE and decreased in those after treatment with EC by BAL. In in vitro experiments with human astrocytes, ACT showed growth-inhibitory and cytotoxic effects on astrocytes. In addition, the expression of water channel protein aquaporin-4, which is induced in injured astrocytes, was increased following ACT treatment. Interestingly, these effects of ACT were additively enhanced by adding arginine-vasopressin (AVP) and were canceled by adding an AVP receptor antagonist. Conclusions These results suggest that ACT is involved in astrocyte injury and dysfunction in concert with AVP during the development of acute HE."

Paired samples (endometrium and peripheral blood) from the same subjects were precisely timed on the 7th days after luteal hormone surge (LH+7). RNA sequencing was applied to investigate the transcriptome profiles. Results The results of transcriptome in peripheral blood cannot be used to characterize women with RIF and unexplained RM. There was a medium level correlation between transcriptome in peripheral blood and endometrium during the window of implantation. Conclusion The differential transcriptome patterns in blood are not representative of those in endometrium, and the blood transcriptome cannot differentiate among the women with RIF, RM or fertile."

EqHV and EPgV have been identified to circulate in the equine population worldwide, whereas TDAV has not been detected in equines since the first reported case. To date, no studies have focused on investigating EqHV, EPgV and TDAV in commercial equine sera or equine blood products in China. Considering the potential threat of EqHV, EPgV and TDAV to biosecurity and considering their possible influences on research results, equine sera for cell culture propagation and pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) were purchased from different companies in China and investigated for EqHV, EPgV and TDAV in this study. By performing nested PCR or two rounds of PCR targeting the viral NS3 gene, four serum samples were confirmed to be EqHV-, EPgV-, or TDAV-RNA positive; all of the PMSG samples were negative for these three viruses. Subsequent sequencing results indicated that the serum samples contained multiple viral variants of EqHV, EPgV or TDAV, and a genetic analysis based on the partial NS3 gene of the three equine viruses was performed. Our study is the first to confirm the presence of EqHV, EPgV and TDAV in equine sera for cell culture propagation that is commercially available in China and provides the first demonstration of the presence of TDAV in China."

Several previous studies reported severe cases of angina, but no appropriate tests to evaluate myocardial perfusion for patients with CPAF have been established. We evaluated the hemodynamic characteristics of CPAF using thallium-201 (Tl-201) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).Tl-201 SPECT was performed in 17 patients with CPAF, but without evidence of coronary artery disease on coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) (age, 58.5±13.3 years; 8 men). Quantitative analysis of scintigraphic data was performed. Additionally, perfusion abnormalities were compared with CCTA findings. Medical records were obtained to define clinical data, diagnostic findings, symptoms, management, follow-up data, and major adverse cardiac events (MACE).Six patients (35.2%) showed perfusion abnormalities on SPECT studies and could be classified as follows: 3 patients, no reversible ischemia (3/17, 17.6%); 1 patient, mild ischemia (1/17, 5.8%); and 2 patients, moderate ischemia (2/17, 11.7%). During the follow-up, ten patients (58.8%) improved under medical management and 5 patients (29.4%) underwent surgical ligation for CPAF with symptomatic improvement in 4 patients. Seven patients performed follow-up myocardial perfusion SPECT, and symptomatic improvement correlated well with scintigraphic perfusion improvement in 6 patients No MACE was observed.Tl-201 myocardial perfusion SPECT might be useful for determining the hemodynamic status and for risk stratification in patients with CPAF."

The screening was based on first trimester cut-offs of ≥1:30 (IPD indicated), 1:31 to 1:899 (second trimester screening indicated) and ≤1:900 (no further action), and a second trimester cut-off of ≥1:250. From January 2014, analysis of fetal cells from peripheral maternal blood was also offered to women with positive screening results. For fetal Down syndrome, the overall detection rate was 96.8% for a false-positive rate of 2.8% resulting in an odds of being affected given a positive result (OAPR) of 1:11, equivalent to a positive predictive value (PPV) of 8.1%. Additional chromosome abnormalities were also identified resulting in an OAPR for any chromosome abnormality of 1:6.6 (PPV 11.9%). For a sub-set of cases with positive contingent test results, FISH analysis of circulating fetal cells in maternal circulation identified 7 abnormal and 39 as normal cases with 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity. We conclude that contingent screening using conventional Combined and second trimester screening tests is effective but can potentially be considerably enhanced through the addition of fetal cell analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2771726122,"The present study examines the relationships between changes in bonding and bridging types of social capital and depressive states among middle-aged adults in Japan using a nationally representative sample. Data was collected from a nationwide, population-based survey conducted from 2005 to 2013 in nine annual waves. A total of 16,737 middle-aged men and 17,768 middle-aged women provided data. They reported about depressive states, measured by Kessler 6 scores, and bonding and bridging types of social capital, measured by reported participation in different social activities. Latent growth modeling was conducted to examine relations between changes in bonding and bridging types of social capital and depressive states within individuals across the nine waves. The results showed that, for both men and women, increases in bonding social capital were associated with decreases in depressive states, while changes in bridging social capital were not related to changes in depressive states. In addition, the results showed that changes in bonding social capital, but not bonding social capital at the baseline, affected changes in depressive states. Future studies should take changes in social capital as an independent variable into consideration."
https://openalex.org/W2773443696,"A protein’s amino acid sequence dictates the folds and final structure the macromolecule will form. We propose that by identifying critical residues in a protein’s atomic structure, we can select a critical stability framework within the protein structure essential to proper protein folding. We use global computational mutagenesis based on the unfolding mutation screen to test the effect of every possible missense mutation on the protein structure to identify the residues that cannot tolerate a substitution without causing protein misfolding. This method was tested using molecular dynamics to simulate the stability effects of mutating critical residues in proteins involved in inherited disease, such as myoglobin, p53, and the 15th sushi domain of complement factor H. In addition we prove that when the critical residues are in place, other residues may be changed within the structure without a stability loss. We validate that critical residues are conserved using myoglobin to show that critical residues are the same for crystal structures of 6 different species and comparing conservation indices to critical residues in 9 eye disease-related proteins. Our studies demonstrate that by using a selection of critical elements in a protein structure we can identify a critical protein stability framework. The frame of critical residues can be used in genetic engineering to improve small molecule binding for drug studies, identify loss-of-function disease-causing missense mutations in genetics studies, and aide in identifying templates for homology modeling."

https://openalex.org/W2772048282,"Adventure racing athletes need run carrying loads during the race. A better understanding of how different loads influence physiological determinants in adventure racers could provide useful insights to gauge training interventions to improve running performance. We compare the maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max), the cost of transport (C) and ventilatory thresholds of twelve adventure running athletes at three load conditions: unloaded, 7 and 15% of body mass. Twelve healthy men experienced athletes of Adventure Racing (age 31.3 ± 7.7 years, height 1.81 ± 0.05 m, body mass 75.5 ± 9.1 kg) carried out three maximal progressive (VO2max protocol) and three submaximal constant-load (running cost protocol) tests, defined in the following quasi-randomized conditions: unloaded, 7% and, 15% of body mass. The VO2max (unload: 59.7 ± 5.9; 7%: 61.7 ± 6.6 and 15%: 64.6 ± 5.4 ml kg-1 min-1) did not change among the conditions. While the 7% condition does neither modify the C nor the ventilatory thresholds, the 15% condition resulted in a higher C (5.2 ± 0.9 J kg-1 m-1; P = 0.001; d = 1.48) than the unloaded condition (4.0 ± 0.7 J kg-1 m-1). First ventilatory threshold was greater at 15% than control condition (+15.5%; P = 0.003; d = 1.44). Interestingly, the velocities on the severe-intensity domain (between second ventilatory threshold and VO2max) were reduced 1% equivalently to 1% increasing load (relative to body mass). The loading until 15% of body mass seems to affect partially the crucial metabolic and ventilatory parameters, specifically the C but not the VO2max. These findings are compatible with the concept that interventions that enhance running economy with loads may improve the running performance of adventure racing’s athletes."
https://openalex.org/W2774022715,"Perception of synchrony between one's own action (a finger tap) and the sensory feedback thereof (a visual flash or an auditory pip) can be recalibrated after exposure to an artificially inserted delay between them (temporal recalibration effect: TRE). TRE might be mediated by a compensatory shift of motor timing (when did I tap?) and/or the sensory timing of the feedback (when did I hear/see the feedback?). To examine this, we asked participants to voluntarily tap their index finger at a constant pace while receiving visual or auditory feedback (a flash or pip) that was either synced or somewhat delayed relative to the tap. Following this exposure phase, they then performed a simple reaction time (RT) task to measure the sensory timing of the exposure stimulus, and a sensorimotor synchronization (SMS) task (tapping in synchrony with a flash or pip as pacing stimulus) to measure the point of subjective synchrony between the tap and pacing stimulus. The results showed that after exposure to delayed auditory feedback, participants tapped earlier (~21.5 ms) relative to auditory pacing stimuli (= temporal recalibration) and reacted faster (~5.6 ms) to auditory stimuli. For visual exposure and test stimuli, there were no such compensatory effects. These results indicate that adjustments of audio-motor synchrony can to some extent be explained by a change in the speed of auditory sensory processing. We discuss this in terms of an attentional modulation of sensory processing."

https://openalex.org/W2775336077,"Athletes as well as elderly or hospitalized patients use dietary protein supplementation to maintain or grow skeletal muscle. It is recognized that high quality protein is needed for muscle accretion, and can be obtained from both animal and plant-based sources. There is interest to understand whether these sources differ in their ability to maintain or stimulate muscle growth and function. In this study, baseline muscle performance was assessed in 50 adult Sprague-Dawley rats after which they were assigned to one of five semi-purified ""Western"" diets (n = 10/group) differing only in protein source, namely 19 kcal% protein from either milk protein isolate (MPI), whey protein isolate (WPI), soy protein isolate (SPI), soy protein concentrate (SPC) or enzyme-treated soy protein (SPE). The diets were fed for 8 weeks at which point muscle performance testing was repeated and tissues were collected for analysis. There was no significant difference in food consumption or body weights over time between the diet groups nor were there differences in terminal organ and muscle weights or in serum lipids, creatinine or myostatin. Compared with MPI-fed rats, rats fed WPI and SPC displayed a greater maximum rate of contraction using the in vivo measure of muscle performance (p<0.05) with increases ranging from 13.3-27.5% and 22.8-29.5%, respectively at 60, 80, 100 and 150 Hz. When the maximum force was normalized to body weight, SPC-fed rats displayed increased force compared to MPI (p<0.05), whereas when normalized to gastrocnemius weight, WPI-fed rats displayed increased force compared to MPI (p<0.05). There was no difference between groups using in situ muscle performance. In conclusion, soy protein consumption, in high-fat diet, resulted in muscle function comparable to whey protein and improved compared to milk protein. The benefits seen with soy or whey protein were independent of changes in muscle mass or fiber cross-sectional area."
https://openalex.org/W2771352522,"Campylobacter jejuni is the most common cause of bacterial gastroenteritis. Major reservoirs are warm-blooded animals, poultry in particular, but Campylobacter can also be transmitted via water. In this paper, we have taken a closer look at the biology and potential virulence of C. jejuni water isolates. Seven C. jejuni isolates from incoming surface water at water plants in Sweden were characterized with whole genome sequencing and phenotypical testing. Multi locus sequence typing analysis revealed that these isolates belonged to groups known to include both common (ST48CC) and uncommon (ST1275CC, ST683, ST793 and ST8853) human pathogens. Further genomic characterization revealed that these isolates had potential for arsenic resistance (due to presence of arsB gene in all isolates), an anaerobic dimethyl sulfoxide oxidoreductase (in three isolates) and lacked the MarR-type transcriptional regulator gene rrpB (in all but one isolate) earlier shown to be involved in better survival under oxidative and aerobic stress. As putative virulence factors were concerned, there were differences between the water isolates in the presence of genes coding for cytolethal distending toxin (cdtABC), Type VI secretion system and sialylated LOS, as well as in biofilm formation. However, all isolates were motile and could adhere to and invade the human HT-29 colon cancer cell line in vitro and induce IL-8 secretion suggesting potential to infect humans. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first study where C. jejuni water isolates have been characterized using whole genome sequencing and phenotypical assays. We found differences and shared traits among the isolates but also potential to infect humans."

We investigated the potential to use a molecular age biomarker to estimate age in short-tailed shearwaters (Ardenna tenuirostris). We quantified DNA methylation in several A. tenuirostris genes that have shown age-related methylation changes in mammals. In birds ranging from chicks to 21 years of age, bisulphite treated blood and feather DNA was sequenced and methylation levels analysed in 67 CpG sites in 13 target gene regions. From blood samples, five of the top relationships with age were identified in KCNC3 loci (CpG66: R2 = 0.325, p = 0.019). In feather samples ELOVL2 (CpG42: R2 = 0.285, p = 0.00048) and EDARADD (CpG46: R2 = 0.168, p = 0.0067) were also weakly correlated with age. However, the majority of markers had no clear association with age (of 131 comparisons only 12 had a p-value < 0.05) and statistical analysis using a penalised lasso approach did not produce an accurate ageing model. Our data indicate that some age-related signatures identified in orthologous mammalian genes are not conserved in the long-lived short tailed shearwater. Alternative molecular approaches will be required to identify a reliable biomarker of chronological age in these seabirds."

This study therefore defined typical isoniazid exposure parameters after two months of treatment among fully-adherent patients in both hair and plasma (plasma area under the concentration-time curve, AUC, estimated using pharmacokinetic data collected 0, 2, 4, and 6 hours after drug administration). We found that INH levels in hair among highly-adherent individuals did not correlate well with plasma AUC or trough concentrations, suggesting that each measure may provide incremental and complementary information regarding drug exposure in the context of TB treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2771735308,"PDE3s belong to the phosphodiesterases family, where the PDE3A isoform is the major subtype in platelets involved in the cAMP regulation pathway of platelet aggregation. PDE3A inhibitors have been designed as potential antiplatelet agents. In this work, a homology model of PDE3A was developed and used to obtain the binding modes of bicyclic heteroaromatic pyridazinones and pyrazolones. Most of the studied compounds adopted similar orientations within the PDE3A active site, establishing hydrogen bonds with catalytic amino acids. Besides, the structure-activity relationship of the studied inhibitors was described by using a field-based 3D-QSAR method. Different structure alignment strategies were employed, including template-based and docking-based alignments. Adequate correlation models were obtained according to internal and external validations. In general, QSAR models revealed that steric and hydrophobic fields describe the different inhibitory activities of the compounds, where the hydrogen bond donor and acceptor fields have minor contributions. It should be stressed that structural elements of PDE3A inhibitors are reported here, through descriptions of their binding interactions and their differential affinities. In this sense, the present results could be useful in the future design of more specific and potent PDE3A inhibitors that may be used for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2771954190,"Eccentric exercise results in an adaptation which attenuates muscle damage from subsequent exercise—termed the “repeated-bout effect (RBE).” Purpose: Study examined antagonist co-activation and motor-unit recruitment strategy, assessed via dEMG, concomitant to the RBE. Methods: Nine participants performed 5 sub-maximal isometric trapezoid (ramp-up, hold, ramp-down) contractions at force levels corresponding to 50% and 80% of maximal isometric strength (MVC). Surface EMG signals of the biceps brachii were decomposed into individual motor-unit action potential trains. The relationship between mean firing rate (MFR) of each motor-unit and its recruitment threshold (RT) was examined using linear regression. Eccentric exercise was then performed until biceps brachii MVC had decreased by ~40%. Surface EMG of the biceps and triceps were collected during eccentric exercise. MVC, range-of-motion (ROM), and delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) were measured 24-hours, 72-hours, and 1-week following eccentric exercise. Three weeks later all procedures were repeated. Results: Changes in MVC (-32±14% vs -25±10%; p = 0.034), ROM (-11% vs 6%; p = 0.01), and DOMS (31.0±19mm vs 19±12mm; p = 0.015) were attenuated following the second bout of exercise. Triceps EMG was reduced (16.8±9.5% vs. 12.6±7.2%; p = 0.03) during the second bout of eccentric exercise. The slope (-0.60±0.13 vs -0.70±0.18; p = 0.029) and y-intercept (46.5±8.3 vs 53.3±8.8; p = 0.020) of the MFR vs. RT relationship was altered during contractions at 80% of MVC prior to the second bout of eccentric exercise. No changes were observed at 50% of MVC. Conclusion: A reduction in antagonist co-activation during the second bout of eccentric exercise suggests less total force was required to move an identical external load. This finding is supported by the increased negative slope coefficient and an increased y-intercept of the linear relationship between RT and MFR."
https://openalex.org/W2772231388,"The main objective of this study is to determine the current use of lung cancer diagnostic procedures in two large hospitals in the Netherlands, to explore deviations in guideline adherence between the hospitals, and to estimate the budget impact of the diagnostic work-up as well as the over- and underutilization.A state transition model for the diagnostic pathway for lung cancer patients was developed using existing clinical practice guidelines (CPG) combined with a systematic literature. In addition to the CPGs depicting current practice, diagnostic utilization was gathered in two large hospitals representing an academic tertiary care hospital and a large regional teaching hospital for patients, who were selected from the Netherlands cancer registry.The total population consisted of 376 patients with lung cancer. Not in all cases the guideline was followed, for instance in the usage of MR brain with stage III lung cancer patients (n = 70). The state-transition model predicts an average budget impact for the diagnostic pathway per patient estimated of € 2496 in the academic tertiary care hospital and € 2191 in the large regional teaching hospital.The adherence to the CPG's differed between hospitals, which questions the adherence to CPG's in general. Adherence to CPG's could lead to less costs in the diagnostic pathway for lung cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2773502167,"International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes have been used to ascertain individuals who are obese. There has been limited research about the predictive value of ICD-coded obesity for major chronic conditions at the population level. We tested the utility of ICD-coded obesity versus measured obesity for predicting incident major osteoporotic fracture (MOF), after adjusting for covariates (i.e., age and sex). In this historical cohort study (2001–2015), we selected 61,854 individuals aged 50 years and older from the Manitoba Bone Mineral Density Database, Canada. Body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m2 was used to define measured obesity. Hospital and physician ICD codes were used to ascertain ICD-coded obesity and incident MOF. Average cohort age was 66.3 years and 90.3% were female. The sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value for ICD-coded obesity using measured obesity as the reference were 0.11 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.10, 0.11), 0.99 (95% CI: 0.99, 0.99) and 0.79 (95% CI: 0.77, 0.81), respectively. ICD-coded obesity (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.83; 95% CI: 0.70, 0.99) and measured obesity (adjusted HR 0.83; 95% CI: 0.78, 0.88) were associated with decreased MOF risk. Although the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) estimates for incident MOF were not significantly different for ICD-coded obesity versus measured obesity (0.648 for ICD-coded obesity versus 0.650 for measured obesity; P = 0.056 for AUROC difference), the category-free net reclassification index for ICD-coded obesity versus measured obesity was -0.08 (95% CI: -0.11, -0.06) for predicting incident MOF. ICD-coded obesity predicted incident MOF, though it had low sensitivity and reclassified MOF risk slightly less well than measured obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2774272613,"Direct smear microscopy of sputum forms the mainstay of TB diagnosis in resource-limited settings. Stained sputum smear slides can serve as a ready-made resource to transport sputum for molecular drug susceptibility testing. However, bio-safety is a major concern during transport of sputum/stained slides and for laboratory workers engaged in processing Mycobacterium tuberculosis infected sputum specimens. In this study, a bio-safe USP (Universal Sample Processing) concentration-based sputum processing method (Bio-safe method) was assessed on 87 M. tuberculosis culture positive sputum samples. Samples were processed for Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) smear, liquid culture and DNA isolation. DNA isolated directly from sputum was subjected to an IS6110 PCR assay. Both sputum DNA and DNA extracted from bio-safe ZN concentrated smear slides were subjected to rpoB PCR and simultaneously assessed by DNA sequencing for determining rifampin (RIF) resistance. All sputum samples were rendered sterile by Bio-safe method. Bio-safe smears exhibited a 5% increment in positivity over direct smear with a 14% increment in smear grade status. All samples were positive for IS6110 and rpoB PCR. Thirty four percent samples were RIF resistant by rpoB PCR product sequencing. A 100% concordance (κ value = 1) was obtained between sequencing results derived from bio-safe smear slides and bio-safe sputum. This study demonstrates that Bio-safe method can address safety issues associated with sputum processing, provide an efficient alternative to sample transport in the form of bio-safe stained concentrated smear slides and can also provide information on drug (RIF) resistance by direct DNA sequencing."
https://openalex.org/W2774674744,"Purpose To develop and assess a three-dimensional (3D) self-gated technique for the evaluation of myocardial infarction (MI) in mouse model without the use of external electrocardiogram (ECG) trigger and respiratory motion sensor on a 3T clinical MR system. Methods A 3D T1-weighted GRE sequence with stack-of-stars sampling trajectories was developed and performed on six mice with MIs that were injected with a gadolinium-based contrast agent at a 3T clinical MR system. Respiratory and cardiac self-gating signals were derived from the Cartesian mapping of the k-space center along the partition encoding direction by bandpass filtering in image domain. The data were then realigned according to the predetermined self-gating signals for the following image reconstruction. In order to accelerate the data acquisition, image reconstruction was based on compressed sensing (CS) theory by exploiting temporal sparsity of the reconstructed images. In addition, images were also reconstructed from the same realigned data by conventional regridding method for demonstrating the advantageous of the proposed reconstruction method. Furthermore, the accuracy of detecting MI by the proposed method was assessed using histological analysis as the standard reference. Linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis were used to assess the agreement between the proposed method and the histological analysis. Results Compared to the conventional regridding method, the proposed CS method reconstructed images with much less streaking artifact, as well as a better contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) between the blood and myocardium (4.1 ± 2.1 vs. 2.9 ± 1.1, p = 0.031). Linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated that excellent correlation was obtained between infarct sizes derived from the proposed method and histology analysis. Conclusion A 3D T1-weighted self-gating technique for mouse cardiac imaging was developed, which has potential for accurately evaluating MIs in mice at 3T clinical MR system without the use of external ECG trigger and respiratory motion sensor."
https://openalex.org/W2775453458,"Objective Although musculoskeletal effects in resistance training are well described, little is known about structural and functional cardiac adaption in formerly untrained subjects. We prospectively evaluated whether short term high intensity (resistance) training (HI(R)T) induces detectable morphologic cardiac changes in previously untrained men in a randomized controlled magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study. Materials and methods 80 untrained middle-aged men were randomly assigned to a HI(R)T-group (n = 40; 43.5±5.9 years) or an inactive control group (n = 40; 42.0±6.3 years). HI(R)T comprised 22 weeks of training focusing on a single-set to failure protocol in 2–3 sessions/week, each with 10–13 exercises addressing main muscle groups. Repetitions were decreased from 8–10 to 3–5 during study period. Before and after HI(R)T all subjects underwent physiologic examination and cardiac MRI (cine imaging, tagging). Results Indexed left (LV) and right ventricular (RV) volume (LV: 76.8±15.6 to 78.7±14.8 ml/m2; RV: 77.0±15.5 to 78.7±15.1 ml/m2) and mass (LV: 55.5±9.7 to 57.0±8.8 g/m2; RV: 14.6±3.0 to 15.0±2.9 g/m2) significantly increased with HI(R)T (all p<0.001). Mean LV and RV remodeling indices of HI(R)T-group did not alter with training (0.73g/mL and 0.19g/mL, respectively [p = 0.96 and p = 0.87]), indicating balanced cardiac adaption. Indexed LV (48.4±11.1 to 50.8±11.0 ml/m2) and RV (48.5±11.0 to 50.6±10.7 ml/m2) stroke volume significantly increased with HI(R)T (p<0.001). Myocardial strain and strain rates did not change following resistance exercise. Left atrial volume at end systole slightly increased after HI(R)T (36.2±7.9 to 37.0±8.4 ml/m2, p = 0.411), the ratio to end-diastolic LV volume at baseline and post-training was unchanged (0.47 vs. 0.47, p = 0.79). Conclusion 22 weeks of HI(R)T lead to measurable, physiological changes in cardiac atrial and ventricular morphologic characteristics and function in previously untrained men.

https://openalex.org/W2772594162,"CDKN2A coding region germline variants are associated with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PC) susceptibility. Recently, we described functional germline 5’UTR CDKN2A variants from melanoma patients affecting the post-transcriptional regulation of p16INK4a mRNA that is dependent, at least in part, on an Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) in the 5’UTR region. Here we describe a 5’UTR c.-201_-198delinsCTTT CDKN2A variant (frequency 0.0028 based on 350 PC patients), which seems to be private to PC, since it has never been found in public databases nor in thousands of melanoma patients tested. Functional analyses confirmed IRES activity of the 5’UTR in BX-PC3 PC cells and revealed a functional impact of the identified variant. Using gene reporter assays we observed reduced translation potential in cells treated with the mTOR inhibitor Torin1, a condition that favors the assessment of IRES activity. At the endogenous gene level we quantified allelic imbalance among polysome-associated mRNAs using a patient-derived cell line heterozygous for the c.-201_-198delinsCTTT. Overall, we conclude that this very rare private variant can be considered a potential mutation, specifically associated with PC. Our data indicate that sequencing of the entire 5'UTR of CDKN2A should be included in routine screening of PC cases with suspected inherited susceptibility."
