https://openalex.org/W4288052200,"Multiple studies have established associations between human gut bacteria and host physiology, but determining the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations has been challenging1-3. Akkermansia muciniphila has been robustly associated with positive systemic effects on host metabolism, favourable outcomes to checkpoint blockade in cancer immunotherapy and homeostatic immunity4-7. Here we report the identification of a lipid from A. muciniphila's cell membrane that recapitulates the immunomodulatory activity of A. muciniphila in cell-based assays8. The isolated immunogen, a diacyl phosphatidylethanolamine with two branched chains (a15:0-i15:0 PE), was characterized through both spectroscopic analysis and chemical synthesis. The immunogenic activity of a15:0-i15:0 PE has a highly restricted structure-activity relationship, and its immune signalling requires an unexpected toll-like receptor TLR2-TLR1 heterodimer9,10. Certain features of the phospholipid's activity are worth noting: it is significantly less potent than known natural and synthetic TLR2 agonists; it preferentially induces some inflammatory cytokines but not others; and, at low doses (1% of EC50) it resets activation thresholds and responses for immune signalling. Identifying both the molecule and an equipotent synthetic analogue, its non-canonical TLR2-TLR1 signalling pathway, its immunomodulatory selectivity and its low-dose immunoregulatory effects provide a molecular mechanism for a model of A. muciniphila's ability to set immunological tone and its varied roles in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W4288052074,"Abstract Device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) enables the generation of secret keys over an untrusted channel using uncharacterized and potentially untrusted devices 1–9 . The proper and secure functioning of the devices can be certified by a statistical test using a Bell inequality 10–12 . This test originates from the foundations of quantum physics and also ensures robustness against implementation loopholes 13 , thereby leaving only the integrity of the users’ locations to be guaranteed by other means. The realization of DIQKD, however, is extremely challenging—mainly because it is difficult to establish high-quality entangled states between two remote locations with high detection efficiency. Here we present an experimental system that enables for DIQKD between two distant users. The experiment is based on the generation and analysis of event-ready entanglement between two independently trapped single rubidium atoms located in buildings 400 metre apart 14 . By achieving an entanglement fidelity of $$ {\mathcal F} \,\ge 0.892(23)$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <mml:mrow> <mml:mi>ℱ</mml:mi> <mml:mspace /> <mml:mo>≥</mml:mo> <mml:mn>0.892</mml:mn> <mml:mrow> <mml:mo>(</mml:mo> <mml:mrow> <mml:mn>23</mml:mn> </mml:mrow> <mml:mo>)</mml:mo> </mml:mrow> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> and implementing a DIQKD protocol with random key basis 15 , we observe a significant violation of a Bell inequality of S = 2.578(75)—above the classical limit of 2—and a quantum bit error rate of only 0.078(9). For the protocol, this results in a secret key rate of 0.07 bits per entanglement generation event in the asymptotic limit, and thus demonstrates the system’s capability to generate secret keys. Our results of secure key exchange with potentially untrusted devices pave the way to the ultimate form of quantum secure communications in future quantum networks."
https://openalex.org/W4288052217,"Cryptographic key exchange protocols traditionally rely on computational conjectures such as the hardness of prime factorisation to provide security against eavesdropping attacks. Remarkably, quantum key distribution protocols like the one proposed by Bennett and Brassard provide information-theoretic security against such attacks, a much stronger form of security unreachable by classical means. However, quantum protocols realised so far are subject to a new class of attacks exploiting implementation defects in the physical devices involved, as demonstrated in numerous ingenious experiments. Following the pioneering work of Ekert proposing the use of entanglement to bound an adversary's information from Bell's theorem, we present here the experimental realisation of a complete quantum key distribution protocol immune to these vulnerabilities. We achieve this by combining theoretical developments on finite-statistics analysis, error correction, and privacy amplification, with an event-ready scheme enabling the rapid generation of high-fidelity entanglement between two trapped-ion qubits connected by an optical fibre link. The secrecy of our key is guaranteed device-independently: it is based on the validity of quantum theory, and certified by measurement statistics observed during the experiment. Our result shows that provably secure cryptography with real-world devices is possible, and paves the way for further quantum information applications based on the device-independence principle."
https://openalex.org/W4288051932,"Ultracold polar molecules offer strong electric dipole moments and rich internal structure, which makes them ideal building blocks to explore exotic quantum matter1-9, implement quantum information schemes10-12 and test the fundamental symmetries of nature13. Realizing their full potential requires cooling interacting molecular gases deeply into the quantum-degenerate regime. However, the intrinsically unstable collisions between molecules at short range have so far prevented direct cooling through elastic collisions to quantum degeneracy in three dimensions. Here we demonstrate evaporative cooling of a three-dimensional gas of fermionic sodium-potassium molecules to well below the Fermi temperature using microwave shielding. The molecules are protected from reaching short range with a repulsive barrier engineered by coupling rotational states with a blue-detuned circularly polarized microwave. The microwave dressing induces strong tunable dipolar interactions between the molecules, leading to high elastic collision rates that can exceed the inelastic ones by at least a factor of 460. This large elastic-to-inelastic collision ratio allows us to cool the molecular gas to 21 nanokelvin, corresponding to 0.36 times the Fermi temperature. Such cold and dense samples of polar molecules open the path to the exploration of many-body phenomena with strong dipolar interactions."

https://openalex.org/W4288051653,"In response to hormones and growth factors, the class I phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) signalling network functions as a major regulator of metabolism and growth, governing cellular nutrient uptake, energy generation, reducing cofactor production and macromolecule biosynthesis1. Many of the driver mutations in cancer with the highest recurrence, including in receptor tyrosine kinases, Ras, PTEN and PI3K, pathologically activate PI3K signalling2,3. However, our understanding of the core metabolic program controlled by PI3K is almost certainly incomplete. Here, using mass-spectrometry-based metabolomics and isotope tracing, we show that PI3K signalling stimulates the de novo synthesis of one of the most pivotal metabolic cofactors: coenzyme A (CoA). CoA is the major carrier of activated acyl groups in cells4,5 and is synthesized from cysteine, ATP and the essential nutrient vitamin B5 (also known as pantothenate)6,7. We identify pantothenate kinase 2 (PANK2) and PANK4 as substrates of the PI3K effector kinase AKT8. Although PANK2 is known to catalyse the rate-determining first step of CoA synthesis, we find that the minimally characterized but highly conserved PANK49 is a rate-limiting suppressor of CoA synthesis through its metabolite phosphatase activity. Phosphorylation of PANK4 by AKT relieves this suppression. Ultimately, the PI3K-PANK4 axis regulates the abundance of acetyl-CoA and other acyl-CoAs, CoA-dependent processes such as lipid metabolism and proliferation. We propose that these regulatory mechanisms coordinate cellular CoA supplies with the demands of hormone/growth-factor-driven or oncogene-driven metabolism and growth."

https://openalex.org/W4288051933,"Invasive fungal pathogens are major causes of human mortality and morbidity1,2. Although numerous secreted effector proteins that reprogram innate immunity to promote virulence have been identified in pathogenic bacteria, so far, there are no examples of analogous secreted effector proteins produced by human fungal pathogens. Cryptococcus neoformans, the most common cause of fungal meningitis and a major pathogen in AIDS, induces a pathogenic type 2 response characterized by pulmonary eosinophilia and alternatively activated macrophages3–8. Here, we identify CPL1 as an effector protein secreted by C. neoformans that drives alternative activation (also known as M2 polarization) of macrophages to enable pulmonary infection in mice. We observed that CPL1-enhanced macrophage polarization requires Toll-like receptor 4, which is best known as a receptor for bacterial endotoxin but is also a poorly understood mediator of allergen-induced type 2 responses9–12. We show that this effect is caused by CPL1 itself and not by contaminating lipopolysaccharide. CPL1 is essential for virulence, drives polarization of interstitial macrophages in vivo, and requires type 2 cytokine signalling for its effect on infectivity. Notably, C. neoformans associates selectively with polarized interstitial macrophages during infection, suggesting a mechanism by which C. neoformans generates its own intracellular replication niche within the host. This work identifies a circuit whereby a secreted effector protein produced by a human fungal pathogen reprograms innate immunity, revealing an unexpected role for Toll-like receptor 4 in promoting the pathogenesis of infectious disease. Cryptococcus neoformans secretes CPL1 protein, which induces alternative activation of macrophages via Toll-like receptor 4 in mice and is essential for fungal virulence."
https://openalex.org/W4288051156,"Aberrations in nuclear size and shape are commonly used to identify cancerous tissue. However, it remains unclear whether the disturbed nuclear structure directly contributes to the cancer pathology or is merely a consequence of other events occurring during tumorigenesis. Here, we show that highly invasive and proliferative breast cancer cells frequently exhibit Akt-driven lower expression of the nuclear envelope proteins lamin A/C, leading to increased nuclear deformability that permits enhanced cell migration through confined environments that mimic interstitial spaces encountered during metastasis. Importantly, increasing lamin A/C expression in highly invasive breast cancer cells reflected gene expression changes characteristic of human breast tumors with higher LMNA expression, and specifically affected pathways related to cell-ECM interactions, cell metabolism, and PI3K/Akt signaling. Further supporting an important role of lamins in breast cancer metastasis, analysis of lamin levels in human breast tumors revealed a significant association between lower lamin A levels, Akt signaling, and decreased disease-free survival. These findings suggest that downregulation of lamin A/C in breast cancer cells may influence both cellular physical properties and biochemical signaling to promote metastatic progression."

https://openalex.org/W4288045341,"Sexual behavior is fundamental for the survival of mammalian species and thus supported by dedicated neural substrates. The ventrolateral part of ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) is an essential locus for controlling female sexual behaviors, but recent studies revealed the molecular complexity and functional heterogeneity of VMHvl cells. Here, we identify the cholecystokinin A receptor (Cckar)-expressing cells in the lateral VMHvl (VMHvllCckar) as the key controllers of female sexual behaviors. The inactivation of VMHvllCckar cells in female mice diminishes their interest in males and sexual receptivity, whereas activating these cells has the opposite effects. Female sexual behaviors vary drastically over the reproductive cycle. In vivo recordings reveal reproductive-state-dependent changes in VMHvllCckar cell spontaneous activity and responsivity, with the highest activity occurring during estrus. These in vivo response changes coincide with robust alternation in VMHvllCckar cell excitability and synaptic inputs. Altogether, VMHvllCckar cells represent a key neural population dynamically controlling female sexual behaviors over the reproductive cycle."
https://openalex.org/W4288052133,"Biological processes depend on the differential expression of genes over time, but methods to make physical recordings of these processes are limited. Here we report a molecular system for making time-ordered recordings of transcriptional events into living genomes. We do this through engineered RNA barcodes, based on prokaryotic retrons1, that are reverse transcribed into DNA and integrated into the genome using the CRISPR-Cas system2. The unidirectional integration of barcodes by CRISPR integrases enables reconstruction of transcriptional event timing based on a physical record through simple, logical rules rather than relying on pretrained classifiers or post hoc inferential methods. For disambiguation in the field, we will refer to this system as a Retro-Cascorder."
https://openalex.org/W4288051761,"Abstract Working memory—the brain’s ability to internalize information and use it flexibly to guide behaviour—is an essential component of cognition. Although activity related to working memory has been observed in several brain regions 1–3 , how neural populations actually represent working memory 4–7 and the mechanisms by which this activity is maintained 8–12 remain unclear 13–15 . Here we describe the neural implementation of visual working memory in mice alternating between a delayed non-match-to-sample task and a simple discrimination task that does not require working memory but has identical stimulus, movement and reward statistics. Transient optogenetic inactivations revealed that distributed areas of the neocortex were required selectively for the maintenance of working memory. Population activity in visual area AM and premotor area M2 during the delay period was dominated by orderly low-dimensional dynamics 16,17 that were, however, independent of working memory. Instead, working memory representations were embedded in high-dimensional population activity, present in both cortical areas, persisted throughout the inter-stimulus delay period, and predicted behavioural responses during the working memory task. To test whether the distributed nature of working memory was dependent on reciprocal interactions between cortical regions 18–20 , we silenced one cortical area (AM or M2) while recording the feedback it received from the other. Transient inactivation of either area led to the selective disruption of inter-areal communication of working memory. Therefore, reciprocally interconnected cortical areas maintain bound high-dimensional representations of working memory."
https://openalex.org/W4288051803,"Single atoms or ions on surfaces affect processes from nucleation1 to electrochemical reactions2 and heterogeneous catalysis3. Transmission electron microscopy is a leading approach for visualizing single atoms on a variety of substrates4,5. It conventionally requires high vacuum conditions, but has been developed for in situ imaging in liquid and gaseous environments6,7 with a combined spatial and temporal resolution that is unmatched by any other method-notwithstanding concerns about electron-beam effects on samples. When imaging in liquid using commercial technologies, electron scattering in the windows enclosing the sample and in the liquid generally limits the achievable resolution to a few nanometres6,8,9. Graphene liquid cells, on the other hand, have enabled atomic-resolution imaging of metal nanoparticles in liquids10. Here we show that a double graphene liquid cell, consisting of a central molybdenum disulfide monolayer separated by hexagonal boron nitride spacers from the two enclosing graphene windows, makes it possible to monitor, with atomic resolution, the dynamics of platinum adatoms on the monolayer in an aqueous salt solution. By imaging more than 70,000 single adatom adsorption sites, we compare the site preference and dynamic motion of the adatoms in both a fully hydrated and a vacuum state. We find a modified adsorption site distribution and higher diffusivities for the adatoms in the liquid phase compared with those in vacuum. This approach paves the way for in situ liquid-phase imaging of chemical processes with single-atom precision."
https://openalex.org/W4288068340,"The COVID-19 pandemic was one of the most devastating health crises the world has seen. One of its mental health consequences includes fear of being infected, which could lead to anxiety. This study aimed to assess the fear related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated factors among the adult population in Lebanon.A cross-sectional study was conducted in Lebanon between February 26th and April 29th, 2021. Data was collected through an online survey among adults aged 18 years and older. Information on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the participants, fear and death anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic, depression, and anxiety were collected. Multivariable linear regression analyses were carried out to identify the predictors of fear related to the COVID-19 pandemic.A total of 1840 participants were included in the analysis of which 62.9% were females and 62.2% were single. The age of the participants ranged from 18 to 70 years with a mean of 26.6 ±8.8 years. Of the total participants, 41.9% felt uncomfortable thinking about the novel Coronavirus and 35.4% of candidates became nervous/anxious when watching the news about COVID-19 on social media. About one-third of the participants (33.7%) were afraid of COVID-19 and 23.8% were afraid of losing their life because of the disease. Concerning somatic symptoms of fear, 7.9% reported increased heart races or palpitations whenever they thought about getting infected with COVID-19, 3.7% complained about sleep disturbances while 2.5% developed tremors or sweating in their hands when they thought about Coronavirus. In addition, Death anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic was one of the most fear-related factors (B = 0.191, 95% CI (0.172 to 0.211), P-value < 0.0001).This study provides insights on the impact of COVID-19 on individuals at the level of fear in Lebanon. Death anxiety was identified as the most significant predictor of fear related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering the negative psychological effects of fear, it is necessary to educate the adults on how to deal with death anxiety and implement psychological interventions and counseling programs to relieve fear and improve the mental health of Lebanese adults."
https://openalex.org/W4288051665,"Emissions of the critical ozone-depleting and greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) from soils and industrial processes have increased considerably over the last decades1-3. As the final step of bacterial denitrification, N2O is reduced to chemically inert N2 (refs. 1,4) in a reaction that is catalysed by the copper-dependent nitrous oxide reductase (N2OR) (ref. 5). The assembly of its unique [4Cu:2S] active site cluster CuZ requires both the ATP-binding-cassette (ABC) complex NosDFY and the membrane-anchored copper chaperone NosL (refs. 4,6). Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of Pseudomonas stutzeri NosDFY and its complexes with NosL and N2OR, respectively. We find that the periplasmic NosD protein contains a binding site for a Cu+ ion and interacts specifically with NosL in its nucleotide-free state, whereas its binding to N2OR requires a conformational change that is triggered by ATP binding. Mutually exclusive structures of NosDFY in complex with NosL and with N2OR reveal a sequential metal-trafficking and assembly pathway for a highly complex copper site. Within this pathway, NosDFY acts as a mechanical energy transducer rather than as a transporter. It links ATP hydrolysis in the cytoplasm to a conformational transition of the NosD subunit in the periplasm, which is required for NosDFY to switch its interaction partner so that copper ions are handed over from the chaperone NosL to the enzyme N2OR."
https://openalex.org/W4288051870,"Doped Mott insulators exhibit some of the most intriguing quantum phases of matter, including quantum spin liquids, unconventional superconductors and non-Fermi liquid metals1-3. Such phases often arise when itinerant electrons are close to a Mott insulating state, and thus experience strong spatial correlations. Proximity between different layers of van der Waals heterostructures naturally realizes a platform for experimentally studying the relationship between localized, correlated electrons and itinerant electrons. Here we explore this relationship by studying the magnetic landscape of tantalum disulfide 4Hb-TaS2, which realizes an alternating stacking of a candidate spin liquid and a superconductor4. We report on a spontaneous vortex phase whose vortex density can be trained in the normal state. We show that time-reversal symmetry is broken in the normal state, indicating the presence of a magnetic phase independent of the superconductor. Notably, this phase does not generate ferromagnetic signals that are detectable using conventional techniques. We use scanning superconducting quantum interference device microscopy to show that it is incompatible with ferromagnetic ordering. The discovery of this unusual magnetic phase illustrates how combining superconductivity with a strongly correlated system can lead to unexpected physics."
https://openalex.org/W4288068195,"COVID-19 exposure in Central Asia appears underestimated and SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence data are urgently needed to inform ongoing vaccination efforts and other strategies to mitigate the regional pandemic. Here, in a pilot serologic study we assessed the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody-mediated immunity in a multi-ethnic cohort of public university employees in Karaganda, Kazakhstan. Asymptomatic subjects (n = 100) were recruited prior to their first COVID-19 vaccination. Questionnaires were administered to capture a range of demographic and clinical characteristics. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected for SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR testing. Serological assays were performed to detect spike (S)-reactive IgG and IgA and to assess virus neutralization. Pre-pandemic samples were used to validate the assay positivity thresholds. S-IgG and -IgA seropositivity rates among SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative participants (n = 100) were 42% (95% CI [32.2–52.3]) and 59% (95% CI [48.8–69.0]), respectively, and 64% (95% CI [53.4–73.1]) of the cohort tested positive for at least one of the antibodies. S-IgG titres correlated with virus neutralization activity, detectable in 49% of the tested subset with prior COVID-19 history. Serologically confirmed history of COVID-19 was associated with Kazakh ethnicity, but not with other ethnic minorities present in the cohort, and self-reported history of respiratory illness since March 2020. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 exposure in this cohort was ~15-fold higher compared to the reported all-time national and regional COVID-19 prevalence, consistent with recent studies of excess infection and death in Kazakhstan. Continuous serological surveillance provides important insights into COVID-19 transmission dynamics and may be used to better inform the regional public health response."
https://openalex.org/W4288426984,"Background Postoperative sepsis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with infective endocarditis undergoing surgical therapy. Blood purification using hemoadsorption therapy shows promising results in the treatment of sepsis. In this study, the clinical effects of intraoperative hemoadsorption in high-risk patients with infective endocarditis were evaluated. Methods Eligible candidates were high-risk patients with infective endocarditis undergoing cardiac surgery between January 2014 and December 2019. Patients with intraoperative hemoadsorption (hemoadsorption) were compared to patients without hemoadsorption (control). The endpoints were the incidence of postoperative sepsis, sepsis-associated death and in-hospital mortality. Additionally, postoperative vasopressor need, systemic vascular resistance indices and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores were compared. Results After propensity score matching, 70 high-risk patients were included. Postoperative sepsis occurred in 14 patients in the hemoadsorption group and in 16 patients in the control group, p = 0.629. Four patients died due to postoperative sepsis in the hemoadsorption group, while 11 postoperative septic patients died in the control group, p = 0.041. In-hospital mortality was 34% in the hemoadsorption group versus 43% in the control group, p = 0.461. On ICU-admission and the first postoperative day, the cumulative vasopressor need was 0.17 versus 0.25 μg/kgBW/min, p = 0.123 and 0.06 versus 0.11 μg/kgBW/min, p = 0.037, and the systemic vascular resistance index was 1448 versus 941 dyn·s·cm -5 , p = 0.013 and 1156 versus 858 dyn·s·cm -5 , p = 0.110 in the hemoadsorption versus control group, respectively. Postoperative course of SOFA score normalized significantly ( p = 0.01) faster in the hemoadsorption group. Conclusions In high-risk cardiac surgical patients with infective endocarditis, intraoperative hemoadsorption significantly reduced sepsis-associated mortality. Furthermore, intraoperative hemoadsorption resulted in significant faster recovery of hemodynamics and organ function. Intraoperative hemoadsorption seems to attenuate the severity of postoperative sepsis."

Aging, especially cellular senescence, is a critical risk factor for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Here, we aim to investigate the role of eHSP90α on cellular senescence in IPF. Our results found that eHSP90α was upregulated in bleomycin (BLM)-induced mice, which correlated with the expression of senescence markers. This increase in eHSP90α mediated fibroblast senescence and facilitated mitochondrial dysfunction. eHSP90α activated TGF-β signaling through the phosphorylation of the SMAD complex. The SMAD complex binding to p53 and p21 promoters triggered their transcription. In vivo, the blockade of eHSP90α with 1G6-D7, a specific eHSP90α antibody, in old mice attenuated the BLM-induced lung fibrosis. Our findings elucidate a crucial mechanism underlying eHSP90α-induced cellular senescence, providing a framework for aging-related fibrosis interventions."

Since the technical datasheets provide general information and limited working details, this research presents a thorough study on the performance of each scanner related explicitly to indoor mapping operations. A series of scanning experiments have been performed for the characterization of each scanner using statistical analysis. During the testing, all the scanning data has been recorded using Robot Operating System (ROS) and then computed in offline processing. In initial tests, each scanner’s drift effect on range measurements has been tested and presented in the relevant section of the paper. In continuation, the effect of various scanning distances on measurement accuracy has been evaluated and discussed. Later the impact of various materials typically found in indoor vicinities and their respective properties of color and smoothness have been tested and provided in the paper. Finally, a Kalman Filtering based mathematical formulation has been utilized to calibrate each scanner and to reduce the measuring uncertainties as observed in various tests for each scanner."
https://openalex.org/W4288447209,"Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common febrile illness caused by enteroviruses in the Picornaviridae family. The major symptoms of HFMD are fever and a vesicular rash on the hand, foot, or oral mucosa. Acute meningitis and encephalitis are observed in rare cases. HFMD epidemics occur annually in Japan, usually in the summer season. Relatively large-scale outbreaks have occurred every two years since 2011. In this study, the epidemic patterns of HFMD in Japan are predicted four weeks in advance using a deep learning method. The time-series data were analyzed by a long short-term memory (LSTM) approach called a Recurrent Neural Network. The LSTM model was trained on the numbers of weekly HFMD cases in each prefecture. These data are reported in the Infectious Diseases Weekly Report, which compiles the national surveillance data from web sites at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan, under the Infectious Diseases Control Law. Consequently, our trained LSTM model distinguishes between relatively large-scale and small-scale epidemics. The trained model predicted the HFMD epidemics in 2018 and 2019, indicating that the LSTM approach can estimate the future epidemic patterns of HFMD in Japan."

So far, post-COVID complications were treated by rehabilitation, oxygen therapy and immunotherapy. Effects of neurofeedback on post-COVID complications and their potential interrelatedness have not been studied yet. In this pilot study, we investigated the effectiveness of neurofeedback (Othmer method) for treatment of fatigue, anxiety, and depression after COVID-19.10 participants met inclusion criteria for having positive anamnesis of at least one of the following complications following COVID-19: fatigue, anxiety, and depression which were measured by questionnaires. ANOVA was used for calculating differences in questionnaire score before and after neurofeedback. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to calculate correlations between anxiety, depression and fatigue.After five neurofeedback sessions, there came to significant reduction of severity of post-COVID anxiety and depression persisting for at least one month. Effect of neurofeedback on fatigue was insignificant. Severity of anxiety, fatigue and depression as well as reductions in depression and fatigue were positively correlated with each other.These findings showed effectiveness neurofeedback for reducing anxiety and depression after COVID-19 and for studying correlations between neurological complications after COVID-19. However, since our pilot clinical trial was open-label, it is hard to differentiate between neurofeedback-specific and unspecific effects on our participants. Future randomized controlled trials with more robust sample are necessary to investigate feasibility of neurofeedback for post-COVID neurological complications.

https://openalex.org/W4288444737,"Stinging nettle root and leaf extracts were tested for their effect on prostatic smooth muscle contractility. Root extract did not affect electrical field stimulation induced-nerve mediated contractions of isolated rat prostates. On the other hand, leaf extract attenuated electrical field stimulation-induced contractions at all frequencies. Similarly, contractions elicited by exogenous administration of ATP and αβ-methylene ATP were inhibited by leaf extract, whereas contractions elicited by exogenous administration of noradrenaline or acetylcholine were unaffected. The active component was present within the aqueous phase of the leaf extract. In mouse mating studies, stinging nettle leaf extract (50 mg p.o. daily) reduced male fertility by 53% compared to vehicle-treated male mice. Cardiovascular parameters were unaffected by administration of stinging nettle leaf extract ( p ≥ 0.057). Treated mice exhibited normal mating behaviour. Bladder and testes weighed less in stinging nettle leaf extract treated mice. All other organs and total body weight were unaffected. It is concluded that stinging nettle leaf extract reduces contractility of genitourinary smooth muscle by acting as an antagonist at postjunctional P2X1-purinoceptors. These data indicates that blocking sperm transport through pharmacological blockade of P2X1-purinoceptors via oral administration is consistent with an effective and convenient biological strategy male contraception."
https://openalex.org/W4288051680,"GeneXpert MTB/RIF is a reliable molecular diagnostic tool capable of detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and identifying genetic determinants of rifampicin (RIF) resistance. This study aimed to assess physicians’ diagnostic decision-making processes for TB based on GeneXpert MTB/RIF results and how this affected the initiation of multidrug resistance (MDR) treatment. This study employed a mixed method: data were collected retrospectively from the medical records of TB patients and in-depth interviews were conducted with healthcare workers in areas with a high TB burden in Thailand. A total of 2,030 complete TB records from 2 patient groups were reviewed, including 1443 suspected cases with negative smear results and 587 with high risk of MDR-TB. GeneXpert MTB/RIF was routinely used to assist the physicians in their decision-making for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and the initiation of MDR-TB treatment. The physicians used it as a “rule-in test” for all patients with negative chest X-rays (CXR) and smear results, to ensure timely treatment. Approximately one-fourth of the patients with negative CXR/smear and GeneXpert MTB/RIF results were diagnosed with PTB by the physicians, who based their decisions on other evidence, such as clinical symptoms, and did not use GeneXpert MTB/RIF as a “rule-out test.” GeneXpert MTB/RIF proved effective in early detection within a day, thereby radically shortening the time required to initiate second-line drug treatment. Despite its high sensitivity for detecting PTB and MDR-TB, GeneXpert MTB/RIF had contradictory results (false positive and/or false negative) for 21.8% of cases among patients with negative smear results and 41.1% of cases among patients with high risk of MDR-TB. Therefore, physicians still used the results of other conventional tests in their decision-making process. It is recommended that GeneXpert MTB/RIF should be established at all points of care and be used as the initial test for PTB and MDR-TB diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W4288052022,"Introduction Acetabular fractures pose high demands on the surgeon and in the case of osteosynthetic treatment, anatomical reconstruction has the highest priority to achieve a good outcome. However, especially in older patients with poor bone quality, even anatomical reconstruction is no guarantee for a good clinical outcome and may nevertheless end in early osteoarthritis. Primary arthroplasty therefore has an increasing importance in the treatment of these patients. The aim of this study was to biomechanically compare fracture gap displacement and failure load as an assessment measure of the primary stability of conventional plate osteosynthesis with the treatment using a sole multi-hole cup for acetabular fractures. Methods Six hemi-pelvises each with anterior column and posterior hemi-transverse (ACPHT) fracture were treated with either plate osteosynthesis or a multi-hole cup. The tests were carried out in a standardised test set-up with cyclic loading in various stages between 150 N and 2500 N. The fracture gap displacement was recorded with optical 3D measuring and the failure load was determined after the cyclic measurement. Results With increasing force, the fracture gap displacement increased in both procedures. In each group there was one treatment which failed at the cyclic loading test and a bone fragment was broken out. The primary stability in arthroplasty was comparable to that of the standard osteosynthesis. Conclusions The results found seem promising that the primary arthroplasty with a sole multi-hole cup and corresponding screw fixation achieves an initial stability comparable to osteosynthesis for typical ACPHT fractures. However, further clinical studies are needed to prove that the cups heal solidly into the bone."
https://openalex.org/W4288066657,"Reproductive health program managers seek information about existing and potential clients’ motivations, behaviors, and barriers to services. Using sequence and cluster analysis of contraceptive calendar data from the 2016–17 Burundi Demographic and Health Survey, we identified discrete clusters characterizing patterns in women’s contraceptive and pregnancy behaviors over the previous 5 years. This study pairs these clusters with data on factors typically targeted in social behavior change interventions: knowledge, attitudes, and women’s interactions with media and health services, to create composite profiles of women in these clusters. Of six clusters, three are characterized by contraceptive use and three are characterized by its absence. Media exposure and attitudes regarding sex preference, wife beating, and self-efficacy largely do not explain cluster membership. Contraceptive knowledge is positively associated with two clusters (Family Builder 1 and Traditional Mother) and negatively associated with a third (Quiet Calendar). Clusters also differ in their members’ fertility desires, contraceptive intentions, and interactions with health services. Two “Family Builder” clusters are both characterized by the presence (but not timing) of multiple pregnancies in their calendar histories, but differ in that women with high contraceptive knowledge, intentions to use contraception, and well-articulated family size ideals are characteristic of one cluster (Family Builder 1), and low contraceptive knowledge, no use of contraception, and vague family size preferences are characteristic of the other (Family Builder 2). These results can guide reproductive health programs as they target social and behavioral change and other interventions to the unique subpopulations they seek to serve."
https://openalex.org/W4288431130,"This study investigated the impact of retinal fluid tolerance on retinal thickness and visual acuity in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration after 18 months of treatment using intravitreal aflibercept. This retrospective study was based on the medical records of 90 eyes presenting persistent or recurrent retinal fluid retention after 3 months of aflibercept loading injections. We defined the fluid tolerance ratio as the sum of fluid-tolerance duration divided by the total duration of retinal fluid observed throughout the follow-up period. Eyes were categorized into strict, intermediate, and relaxed group based on their fluid tolerance ratio (= 0, &lt;30%, &gt; = 30%, respectively). The mean total follow-up time was 556 days. The relaxed group required fewer injections than the strict group (4.92 vs 7.50 injections, P &lt; 0.01) and presented a similar reduction in retinal thickness (-57.50 vs -71.65 μm, P = 0.83). Nonetheless, the two groups were similar in terms of final visual acuity (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution 0.72 vs 0.70, P = 0.95) and visual gains (4.21 vs -1.12 letters, P = 0.56). These results indicate that in the setting of limited medical resources, a fluid-tolerant approach provides comparable gains in visual acuity. Reducing the number of injections may also improve adherence to therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4288431918,"We propose a deep learning system to automatically detect four explainable emphysema signs on frontal and lateral chest radiographs. Frontal and lateral chest radiographs from 3000 studies were retrospectively collected. Two radiologists annotated these with 4 radiological signs of pulmonary emphysema identified from the literature. A patient with ≥2 of these signs present is considered emphysema positive. Using separate deep learning systems for frontal and lateral images we predict the presence of each of the four visual signs and use these to determine emphysema positivity. The ROC and AUC results on a set of 422 held-out cases, labeled by both radiologists, are reported. Comparison with a black-box model which predicts emphysema without the use of explainable visual features is made on the annotations from both radiologists, as well as the subset that they agreed on. DeLong's test is used to compare with the black-box model ROC and McNemar's test to compare with radiologist performance. In 422 test cases, emphysema positivity was predicted with AUCs of 0.924 and 0.946 using the reference standard from each radiologist separately. Setting model sensitivity equivalent to that of the second radiologist, our model has a comparable specificity (p = 0.880 and p = 0.143 for each radiologist respectively). Our method is comparable with the black-box model with AUCs of 0.915 (p = 0.407) and 0.935 (p = 0.291), respectively. On the 370 cases where both radiologists agreed (53 positives), our model achieves an AUC of 0.981, again comparable to the black-box model AUC of 0.972 (p = 0.289). Our proposed method can predict emphysema positivity on chest radiographs as well as a radiologist or a comparable black-box method. It additionally produces labels for four visual signs to ensure the explainability of the result. The dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6373392."
https://openalex.org/W4288439555,"Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC), which has potential zoonotic risk, can cause severe systemic infections such as septicemia and meningitis in poultry. Colibactin is a hybrid non-ribosomal peptide/polyketide secondary metabolite produced by bacteria, which induces double-strand DNA breaks and chromosome instability in eukaryotic cells. ClbA is a 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase) that is essential for colibactin and plays a role in siderophore synthesis. However, whether ClbA is associated with meningitis development in APEC is unclear. In this study, we abolished the clbA gene in the APEC XM strain, investigated the effect of clbA on colibactin synthesis and evaluated the pathogenic capacity of colibactin on meningitis development. Deletion of clbA reduced DNA damage to cells and hindered the normal synthesis of colibactin. Compared with the mice infected by wild-type APEC XM, the clbA deletion mutant infected mice had significant reduction in a series of characteristics associated with meningitis including clinical symptoms, bacterial loads of blood and brain, disruption of the blood brain barrier and the expression of inflammatory factors in the brain tissue. Complementation of ClbA recovered some APEC XM virulence. We conclude that ClbA is obligatory for the synthesis of colibactin and is responsible for the development of meningitis in mice infected by APEC."

Unlike previous presidential elections, there was a decrease in physical events and advertisements for the candidates; in turn, the online presence of presidential candidates is significantly increased. Farsi Twitter played a specific role in this matter, as it became the platform for creating political content. In this study, we found traces of organizational activities in Farsi Twitter. Our investigations reveals that the discussion network of the 2021 election is heterogeneous and highly polarized. However, unlike other elections, candidates' supporters are very close, and ""Anti-voters"" who endorse boycotting the election is at the discussions opposite end. Furthermore, high presence of the bot activity is observed among the most influential users in all of the involved communities."
https://openalex.org/W4288051711,"Automated monitoring of vegetation health in a landscape is often attributed to calculating values of various vegetation indexes over a period of time. However, such approaches suffer from an inaccurate estimation of vegetational change due to the over-reliance of index values on vegetation's colour attributes and the availability of multi-spectral bands. One common observation is the sensitivity of colour attributes to seasonal variations and imaging devices, thus leading to false and inaccurate change detection and monitoring. In addition, these are very strong assumptions in a citizen science project. In this article, we build upon our previous work on developing a Semantic Vegetation Index (SVI) and expand it to introduce a semantic vegetation health monitoring platform to monitor vegetation health in a large landscape. However, unlike our previous work, we use RGB images of the Australian landscape for a quarterly series of images over six years (2015-2020). This Semantic Vegetation Index (SVI) is based on deep semantic segmentation to integrate it with a citizen science project (Fluker Post) for automated environmental monitoring. It has collected thousands of vegetation images shared by various visitors from around 168 different points located in Australian regions over six years. This paper first uses a deep learning-based semantic segmentation model to classify vegetation in repeated photographs. A semantic vegetation index is then calculated and plotted in a time series to reflect seasonal variations and environmental impacts. The results show variational trends of vegetation cover for each year, and the semantic segmentation model performed well in calculating vegetation cover based on semantic pixels (overall accuracy = 97.7%). This work has solved a number of problems related to changes in viewpoint, scale, zoom, and seasonal changes in order to normalise RGB image data collected from different image devices."
https://openalex.org/W4288051862,"Combining preoperative spirometry with the Assess Respiratory Risk in Surgical Patients in Catalunia (ARISCAT) risk scale can reduce post-operative complications and improve patient survival. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of performing spirometry or not in conjunction with the ARISCAT scale, to reduce post-operative complications and improve survival among adult patients undergoing elective surgery in Mexico.A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) was performed to compare the specific cost and health outcomes associated with the combined use of the ARISCAT scale and preoperative spirometry (Group 1), and the use of the ARISCAT scale without preoperative spirometry (Group 2). The health outcomes evaluated were post-operative complications and survival. The perspective was from the health care provider (Hospital General de México) and direct medical costs were reported in 2019 US dollars. A decision tree with a time horizon of eight months was used for each health outcome and ARISCAT risk level.The combined use of the ARISCAT scale and spirometry is more cost-effective for reducing post-operative complications in the low and moderate-risk levels and is cost-saving in the high-risk level, than use of the ARISCAT scale without spirometry. To improve patient survival, ARISCAT and spirometry are also more cost-effective at the moderate risk level, and cost-saving for high-risk patients, than using the ARISCAT scale alone.The use of preoperative spirometry among patients with a high ARISCAT risk level was cost-saving, reduced post-operative complications, and improved survival. Our findings indicate an urgent need to implement spirometry as part of preoperative care in Mexico, which is already the standard of care in other countries."
https://openalex.org/W4288051904,"Despite the tremendous evidence of the harmful effects of maternal filicide on the lives of offenders, there is a scarcity on studies of their negative emotions and personal wellbeing especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Thus, this study was primarily aimed at assessing the prevalence of negative emotions experienced by filicide mothers and how they were associated with personal wellbeing in Rwanda. With an institutional-based cross-sectional study design, we measured the symptoms of anxiety, anger, shame, guilt, depression and personal well-being in a convenient sample of 55 filicidal mothers (mean age = 26.69; SD = 6.88) who were incarcerated in Nyarugenge prison. SPSS (version 24) was used to compute descriptive, Pearson correlation, independent t-test and regression analyses. The results indicated that the rates of shame were (100%), guilt (98.2%), anxiety (92.7%), depression (92.7%), low happiness and satisfaction with life (81.8%), and anger was (76.4%) in the current sample. Based on age category, there was no significant difference in anger scores, depression, guilt, shame and personal well-being scores between young and adult filicide mothers (p>.05). Young filicide mothers (M = 14.55, SD = 4.03), on the other hand, had higher anxiety scores than adult filicide mothers (M = 11.57, SD = 4.72), t = 2.52, p = .015. Finally, anxiety (β = -.507, t = -3.478, p = .001) and age (β = -.335, t = -2.685, p < .001) were negatively associated with personal well-being. The results emerged from this study highlight that filicide mothers experience substantial negative emotions and poor personal wellbeing regardless of their age category. However, poor personal wellbeing was associated with anxiety and age. Based on these results, mental health professionals should examine their mental state with respect to negative emotions and initiate programs that decrease the emotions as well as increase personal well-being."
https://openalex.org/W4288051953,"Background Screening program participants with iron overload (IO) phenotypes without HFE p.C282Y/p.C282Y are incompletely characterized. Methods We studied white participants who had IO phenotypes without p.C282Y/p.C282Y in post-screening clinical examinations (CE). We defined IO phenotypes as a) elevated serum ferritin (SF) and transferrin saturation (TS) at screening and CE, and b) absence of IO treatment, anemia, transfusion &gt;10 units, alcohol intake &gt;30 g/d, hepatitis B or C, and pregnancy. We defined IO-related disease as elevated alanine or aspartate aminotransferase (ALT/AST) or swelling/tenderness of 2nd/3rd metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints. All participants had HFE p.C282Y and p.H63D genotyping. Results There were 32 men and 26 women (mean age 54±16 y). Median food/supplemental iron intakes were 14.3/0.0 mg/d. Relative risks of HFE genotypes were 12.9 (p.C282Y/p.H63D), 3.0 (p.H63D/p.H63D), 1.9 (p.C282Y/wt), 0.9 (p.H63D/wt), and 0.5 (wt/wt) compared to 42,640 white screening participants without IO phenotypes or p.C282Y/p.C282Y. Regression on SF revealed positive associations: MCV (p = 0.0006; β coefficient = 0.4531); swelling/tenderness of MCP joints (p = 0.0033; β = 0.3455); and p.H63D/wt (p = 0.0015; β = 0.4146). IO-related disease (18 elevated ALT/AST, one swelling/tenderness of MCP joints) occurred in 19 participants (7 men, 12 women). Median MCV was higher in participants with IO-related disease (97 fL vs. 94 fL; p = 0.0007). Logistic regression on IO-related disease revealed a significant association with diabetes (p = 0.0416; odds ratio 18.9 (95% confidence interval 1.0, 341.1)). Conclusions In the present 58 screening program participants who had IO phenotypes without HFE p.C282Y/p.C282Y, relative risks of HFE genotypes p.C282Y/p.H63D, p.H63D/p.H63D, and p.C282Y/wt were significantly higher than in 42,640 white screening participants with neither IO phenotypes nor p.C282Y/p.C282Y. SF was significantly associated with MCV, swelling/tenderness of 2nd/3rd MCP joints, and p.H63D/wt. IO-related disease was significantly associated with MCV and diabetes."

In particular, to our knowledge, there has been little report concerning Ethiopian lactating women regarding their micronutrient intake. Our objective was to assess micronutrient intake inadequacy and its associated factors among lactating women in Bahir Dar city, Northwest Ethiopia, 2021.Community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from February 15 to March 05, 2021. Four hundred thirteen respondents were selected through systematic random sampling. Data were collected by interviewer-administered semi-structured questionnaire and a single multiphasic 24 hours dietary recall was used to assess dietary assessment. Data entry and analysis were carried out using EpiData and SPSS respectively. The ESHA food processor, Ethiopian food composition table, and world food composition table have used the calculation of nutrient values of the selected micronutrient. The nutrient intakes were assessed by Nutrient Adequacy Ratio (NAR) and Mean Adequacy Ratio (MAR). Multivariable binary logistic regression analysis was done to identify the factors of overall micronutrient intake inadequacy.The overall prevalence of micronutrient intake inadequacy across 12 nutrients was 39.9% [95% CI (34.9, 45.0)]. The inadequate intake of vitamin A was 98.2%. Similarly, the inadequate intake of B vitamins ranges from 13.4% to 68.5%. The insufficient intakes of calcium, iron, and zinc were 70.9%, 0%, and 4.7%, respectively. Around 36 and 91.6% of the respondents had inadequate intake of selenium and sodium, respectively. On multivariable logistic regression analysis; Being divorced was 2.7 times more likely to have overall micronutrient intake inadequacy than being married [AOR = 2.71, 95% CI (1.01, 7.33)]. The odds of overall micronutrient intake inadequacy were 2.6 higher in merchants than in housewives [AOR = 2.63, 95% CI (1.40, 4.93)]. Lactating women who had poor nutritional knowledge were 2.7 times more likely to have overall micronutrient intake inadequacy than those who had good nutritional knowledge [AOR = 2.71, 95% CI (1.47, 4.99)].Overall, the micronutrient intake in lactating women was lower than the recommended levels. Therefore; educating lactating women about appropriate dietary intake is essential."
https://openalex.org/W4288077386,"Sedatives/anesthetics are important medical tools to facilitate medical care and increase patients' comfort. Increasingly, there is recognition that sedatives/anesthetics can modulate immune functions. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are major pattern recognition receptors involved in the recognition of microbial components. TLR7 recognizes single-strand RNA virus such as influenza and SARS-CoV2 viruses and initiates interferon (IFN) responses. IFN production triggered by TLR7 stimulation is a critical anti-viral response. For example, patients with TLR7 variants including loss-of- function variants were associated with severe COVID-19. Taken together, it is important to determine if sedatives/anesthetics mitigate TLR7 function. We have previously showed that TLR7-mediated activation was not affected by volatile anesthetics. However, we found that propofol attenuated TLR7 activation among intravenous sedatives in the reporter assay. TLR7 agonist R837 stimulation increased TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-β mRNA levels in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells, while these levels were attenuated by propofol. Our murine lung slice experiments showed that propofol attenuated IFN production. R837 increased IFN-β expression in the lungs, and propofol attenuated IFN-β expression in an in vivo model of R837 intranasal instillation. We also found that propofol directly bound to and hindered its association of TLR7 with MyD88. Our analysis using fropofol, propofol derivative showed that the hydroxyl group in propofol was important for propofol–TLR7 interaction."
https://openalex.org/W4288080568,"Hypokalemia causes ectopic heartbeats, but the mechanisms underlying such cardiac arrhythmias are not understood. In reduced serum K+ concentrations that occur under hypokalemia, K2P1 two-pore domain K+ channels change ion selectivity and switch to conduct inward leak cation currents, which cause aberrant depolarization of resting potential and induce spontaneous action potential of human cardiomyocytes. K2P1 is expressed in the human heart but not in mouse hearts. We test the hypothesis that K2P1 leak cation channels contribute to ectopic heartbeats under hypokalemia, by analysis of transgenic mice, which conditionally express induced K2P1 specifically in hearts, mimicking K2P1 channels in the human heart. Conditional expression of induced K2P1 specifically in the heart of hypokalemic mice results in multiple types of ventricular ectopic beats including single and multiple ventricular premature beats as well as ventricular tachycardia and causes sudden death. In isolated mouse hearts that express induced K2P1, sustained ventricular fibrillation occurs rapidly after perfusion with low K+ concentration solutions that mimic hypokalemic conditions. These observed phenotypes occur rarely in control mice or in the hearts that lack K2P1 expression. K2P1-expressing mouse cardiomyocytes of transgenic mice much more frequently fire abnormal single and/or rhythmic spontaneous action potential in hypokalemic conditions, compared to wild type mouse cardiomyocytes without K2P1 expression. These findings confirm that K2P1 leak cation channels induce ventricular ectopic beats and sudden death of transgenic mice with hypokalemia and imply that K2P1 leak cation channels may play a critical role in human ectopic heartbeats under hypokalemia."
https://openalex.org/W4288426074,"Stratified random sampling is an effective sampling technique for estimating the population characteristics. The determination of strata boundaries and the allocation of sample size to the strata are two of the most critical factors in maximizing the precision of the estimates. Most surveys are conducted in an environment of severe budget constraints and a specific time is required to finish the survey. So cost and time are two important objectives that are taken under consideration in most surveys. The study suggested Mathematical goal programming model for determining optimum stratum boundaries for an exponential study variable under multiple objectives model when cost and time are under consideration. Compared to other techniques, Goal programming has many advantages in resources planning. Determining the required resources to satisfy the desired goals and the effectiveness of the available resources as well as providing best solutions under different amounts of resources are examples of the advantages of Goal programming. In addition the paper used data on Covid-19 to evaluate the performance of the suggested model for the exponential distribution. The study divided the number of new cases diseases into small, medium and high numbers. It also compared the results with the findings in the reports of the World Health Organization. The suggested mathematical goal programming revealed that Egypt was exposed to three waves of infection during the interval (5/3/2020 to 12/8/2021). These results are identical to the actual reality of covid-19 waves in Egypt."
https://openalex.org/W4288427203,"Background Ethiopia is among sub-Saharan African countries with a high number of malaria cases each year, with most of the landmass favoring the breeding of the vectors. There have been extensive efforts to control and prevent the transmission of malaria, which is part of the country’s prevention-based health policy. Objective This study aimed to determine malaria prevalence and associated risk factors among patients visiting Mizan-Tepi University Teaching Hospital (MTUTH). Materials and methods A cross-sectional study was conducted from September to December 2021 among patients visiting MTUTH, Southwest Ethiopia. A pretested structured questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic data, and a capillary blood sample was collected after obtaining written informed consent from the study participants. The data were entered into Epi-data manager (v4.0.2.101) and analyzed with SPSS version 25.0, with a P-value of &lt; 0.05 set as a significance. Results A total of 439 patients participated, of which 20.7% (91) were positive for malaria parasites, with a higher prevalence observed among the age group interval of 25–34 years (5.5%). Inadequate access to insecticide-treated bed net (ITN) 23.9% (105) and a low level of ITN usage 20.5% (90) were recorded. Patients living in areas of stagnant water were more likely to get infected with the malaria parasite (AOR = 16.191, 95% CI: 9.137, 28.692) compared to those who live away from stagnant water, and individuals living in houses not sprayed with insecticides were more susceptible to malaria infection (AOR = 0.215, 95% CI: 0.128, 0.360). Conclusion The overall malaria prevalence in this study was 20.7% (91), which proves that malaria remains a major threat to the communities in the study area, with Plasmodium falciparum contributing to most of the cases. Improving the habits of ITN usage and indoor residual spray through health education may help to reduce the impact of malaria in the study area."
https://openalex.org/W4288429399,"Background The criteria for brain death determination have not been unified globally, and there is no global consensus on the apnea test, which is essential for determining brain death. Since the apnea test is associated with many complications, we aimed to determine an optimal duration of the apnea test. Methods We analyzed the results of the apnea test performed for brain death determination between August 2013 and February 2021 at a single institution in South Korea. Elevations in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide and mean arterial blood pressure fluctuations over time in the apnea test were recorded. Results In the 1 st and 2 nd tests, the mean partial pressure of carbon dioxide increased by more than 20 mmHg at 3 min after the apnea test compared to before the test ( P &lt; 0.05). At 4 min in the 1 st test and 5 min in the 2 nd test, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide exceeded 60 mmHg ( P &lt; 0.05). The fluctuation in the mean arterial blood pressure observed for 5 min during the apnea test was not significant. There was no significant fluctuation in the mean arterial blood pressure over time in the apnea test between patients with normal chest radiography findings and those with abnormal chest radiography findings ( P = 0.888). Conclusions Our study proposes that a short-term apnea test protocol is valid for the preservation of organs for donation."

The purpose of this study was to compare in-hospital clinical outcomes between low-dose prasugrel (3.75 mg/day) and clopidogrel, as part of triple antithrombotic therapy, using a large database in Japan. Methods Patients with ischemic heart disease who underwent PCI between January 2015 and December 2019, and were prescribed triple therapy with aspirin, a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel or low-dose prasugrel), and OAC (direct oral anticoagulant: DOAC or vitamin K antagonist: VKA), were selected from the Diagnosis Procedure Combination database. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcomes were myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, bleeding stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding, and blood transfusion. Results Overall, 5,777 patients were eligible in this analysis. The patients were divided into 4 subgroups according to the type of P2Y12 inhibitor and OAC: clopidogrel/DOAC (n = 1,628), clopidogrel/VKA (n = 1,334), prasugrel/DOAC (n = 1,607), and prasugrel/VKA (n = 1,208). There was no significant difference in the incidence of death and gastrointestinal bleeding among the 4 subgroups. The prasugrel/DOAC group had significantly lower incidence of MI (OR 0.566, 95% CI 0.348–0.921). The incidence of ischemic stroke was significantly lower in the prasugrel/DOAC group (OR 0.701, 95% CI 0.502–0.979), and significantly higher in the clopidogrel/VKA group (OR 1.680, 95% CI 1.273–2.216). Need for blood transfusion was less frequent in the prasugrel/DOAC group (OR 0.729, 95% CI 0.598–0.890), and more frequent in both the clopidogrel/VKA group (OR 1.424, 95% CI 1.187–1.708) and the prasugrel/VKA group (OR 1.633, 95% CI 1.367–1.950). Conclusions Combination of low-dose prasugrel and DOAC was associated with lower incidence of MI, ischemic stroke, and blood transfusion. Low-dose prasugrel may be feasible as part of triple therapy in patients undergoing PCI."

Time to recovery is an indicator of the severity of sepsis, and risk factors varied significantly according to study population and settings. Moreover, published literature regarding the time to recovery of neonatal sepsis is scarce.The aim of this study was to assess the time to recovery of neonatal sepsis and determinant factors among neonates admitted in the Public Hospitals of Central Gondar Zone, Northwest Ethiopia.An institution-based prospective follow-up study design was conducted among 631 neonates with sepsis. A structured, pre-tested, interviewer-administered questionnaire was used. The median time to recovery, life-table, the Kaplan Meier curve, and the log-rank test were computed. Both bi-variable and multivariable Cox regression models were applied to analyze the data.Of all septic neonates, 511 successfully recovered.

The above-mentioned factors could be used for the early identification of neonates with sepsis at risk for protracted illness and it could guide prompt referral to higher centers in primary health sectors. This also will provide prognostic information to clinicians and families as longer recovery time has economic and social implications in our country."
https://openalex.org/W4288439548,"Understanding the complexities of sexual relationships is essential to understand the risky sexual behaviours among young people in Ugandan universities. Nine focus group discussions conducted with 31 males and 33 female students in 2014 utilising the grounded theory approach explored the role of sexual relationships in their lives. ‘ Relationships in campus are situationships’ emerged as the core category and referred to the variety of sexual interactions within relationships among young people in a Ugandan university. The study findings indicated that sexual interactions often follow a sexual script that undergoes transitions to negotiate various situations. The sexual scripts in these situationships were strongly influenced by local socio-cultural norms and global aspirations among young people. Students often discussed these sexual scripts within a wider discourse on transactional sexual relationships. The motivations for transactional sexual relationships ranged from ‘fulfilling aspirations’ of various kinds on the one hand to ‘being forced into trading sex’ to overcome socio-economic vulnerabilities. Sexual relationships were facilitated by the perception of a university as a sexualized space in which one may enjoy a period of emerging adulthood characterized by exploration in relationships, access to alcohol and prolonged delay in assuming the traditional adult roles of marriage and family. The sexual scripts at the cultural level were grounded in traditional gender roles although at the same time, were under transition during university life with the growing influence of globalization and consumerism in the Ugandan society. Young men and young women must be engaged to critically challenge the implicit assumptions about sexual interactions within various situations that may put them at risk for poor sexual health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4288444182,"This study aimed to determine the effects of zoledronic acid (ZOL) on OA in rats and explored the molecular mechanism of osteoclast activation in early OA. A knee OA rat model was designed by surgically destabilizing the medial meniscus (DMM). Seventy-two male rats were randomly assigned to Sham+phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), DMM+PBS, and DMM+ZOL groups; rats were administered with 100 μg/Kg ZOL or PBS, twice weekly for 4 weeks. After 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks of OA induction, the thickness of the hyaline and calcified cartilage layers was calculated using hematoxylin and eosin staining, degenerated cartilage stained with Safranin O-fast green staining was evaluated and scored, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-stained osteoclasts were counted, changes in subchondral bone using micro-computed tomography were analyzed, and PINP and CTX-I levels were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Using these results, 18 male rats were randomly assigned to three groups. Four weeks after surgery, Wnt5a, RANKL, CXCL12, and NFATc1 protein levels were measured in subchondral bone using western blotting, and mRNA levels of genes related to osteoclastogenesis in subchondral bone were measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Bone marrow-derived macrophages were isolated as osteoclast precursors, and cell differentiation, migration, and adhesion were assessed by TRAP staining and Transwell assays, revealing that DMM induced knee OA in rats. Progressive cartilage loss was observed 12 weeks after OA induction. Subchondral bone remodeling was dominated by bone resorption during early OA (within 4 weeks), whereas bone formation was increased 8 weeks later. ZOL suppressed bone resorption by inhibiting Wnt5a signaling in early OA, improved the imbalance of subchondral bone remodeling, reduced cartilage degeneration, and delayed OA progression. Additionally, ZOL delayed OA progression and reduced cartilage degeneration via a spatiotemporal effect in DMM-induced OA. Osteoclast activity in early OA might be associated with Wnt5a signaling, indicating a possible novel strategy for OA treatment."
