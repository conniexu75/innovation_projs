https://openalex.org/W1497345935,"The amino acid sequences of both the alpha and beta subunits of human chorionic gonadotropin have been determined. The amino acid sequence of the alpha subunit is: Ala - Asp - Val - Gln - Asp - Cys - Pro - Glu - Cys-10 - Thr - Leu - Gln - Asp - Pro - Phe - Ser - Gln-20 - Pro - Gly - Ala - Pro - Ile - Leu - Gln - Cys - Met - Gly-30 - Cys - Cys - Phe - Ser - Arg - Ala - Tyr - Pro - Thr - Pro-40 - Leu - Arg - Ser - Lys - Lys - Thr - Met - Leu - Val - Gln-50 - Lys - Asn - Val - Thr - Ser - Glu - Ser - Thr - Cys - Cys-60 - Val - Ala - Lys - Ser - Thr - Asn - Arg - Val - Thr - Val-70 - Met - Gly - Gly - Phe - Lys - Val - Glu - Asn - His - Thr-80 - Ala - Cys - His - Cys - Ser - Thr - Cys - Tyr - Tyr - His-90 - Lys - Ser. Oligosaccharide side chains are attached at residues 52 and 78. In the preparations studied approximately 10 and 30% of the chains lack the initial 2 and 3 NH2-terminal residues, respectively. This sequence is almost identical with that of human luteinizing hormone (Sairam, M. R., Papkoff, H., and Li, C. H. (1972) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 48, 530-537). The amino acid sequence of the beta subunit is: Ser - Lys - Glu - Pro - Leu - Arg - Pro - Arg - Cys - Arg-10 - Pro - Ile - Asn - Ala - Thr - Leu - Ala - Val - Glu - Lys-20 - Glu - Gly - Cys - Pro - Val - Cys - Ile - Thr - Val - Asn-30 - Thr - Thr - Ile - Cys - Ala - Gly - Tyr - Cys - Pro - Thr-40 - Met - Thr - Arg - Val - Leu - Gln - Gly - Val - Leu - Pro-50 - Ala - Leu - Pro - Gin - Val - Val - Cys - Asn - Tyr - Arg-60 - Asp - Val - Arg - Phe - Glu - Ser - Ile - Arg - Leu - Pro-70 - Gly - Cys - Pro - Arg - Gly - Val - Asn - Pro - Val - Val-80 - Ser - Tyr - Ala - Val - Ala - Leu - Ser - Cys - Gln - Cys-90 - Ala - Leu - Cys - Arg - Arg - Ser - Thr - Thr - Asp - Cys-100 - Gly - Gly - Pro - Lys - Asp - His - Pro - Leu - Thr - Cys-110 - Asp - Asp - Pro - Arg - Phe - Gln - Asp - Ser - Ser - Ser - Ser - Lys - Ala - Pro - Pro - Pro - Ser - Leu - Pro - Ser-130 - Pro - Ser - Arg - Leu - Pro - Gly - Pro - Ser - Asp - Thr-140 - Pro - Ile - Leu - Pro - Gln. Oligosaccharide side chains are found at residues 13, 30, 121, 127, 132, and 138. The proteolytic enzyme, thrombin, which appears to cleave a limited number of arginyl bonds, proved helpful in the determination of the beta sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1491275120,"When the 100,000 X g supernatant fractions of several rat organs are incubated with all-trans-[3H]retinoic acid, a binding component for retinoic acid with a sedimentation coefficient of 2 S can be detected by sucrose gradient centrifugation. This tissue binding protein for retinoic acid is distinct from the tissue binding protein for retinol which has been previously described. The tissue retinoic acid-binding protein has been partially purified from rat testis and this partially purified protein would appear to have a molecular weight of 14,500 as determined by gel filtration and high binding specificity for all-trans-retinoic acid. Binding of [3H]retinoic acid is not diminished by a 200-fold molar excess of retinal, retinol, or oleic acid but is reduced by a 200-fold excess of unlabeled retinoic acid. Tissue retinoic acid-binding protein can be detected in extracts of brain, eye, ovary, testis, and uterus but is apparently absent in heart muscle, small intestine, kidney, liver, lung, gastrocnemious muscle, serum, and spleen. This distribution is different than that observed for the tissue retinol-binding protein. Tissue retinol-binding protein was also purified extensively from rat testis. The partially purified protein has an apparent molecular weight of 14,000 and high binding specificity for all-trans-[3H]retinol as only unlabeled all-trans-retinol but not retinal, retinoic acid, retinyl acetate, retinyl palmitate, or oleic acid could diminish binding of the 3H ligand under the conditions employed. The partially purified protein has a fluorescence excitation spectrum with lambda max at 350 nm. In contrast, the retinol-binding protein isolated from rat serum and described by others has a fluorescence excitation spectrum with lambda max at 334 nm and an apparent molecular weight of 19,000. When partially purified tissue retinol-binding protein is extracted with heptane, the heptane extract has a fluorescence excitation spectrum similar to that of all-trans-retinol."
https://openalex.org/W1547211724,"The polyadenylic acid-containing messenger ribonucleic acids of eukaryotic cells are rapidly isolated and deproteinized in a simple and gentle one-step procedure. The polyribosome fraction, dissolved in 0.5 M NaCl/0.5 percent sodium dodecyl sulfate, is passed through an oligo(dT)-cellulose column which is then washed with the solvent until proteins and contaminating ribonucleic acids are fully removed. Deproteinized messenger ribonucleic acid is then eluted by lowering the ionic strength. This method gives highly purified and active messenger ribonucleic acids from all tissues tested. The yield is approximately 1.5 to 2 percent of the polyribosomal ribonucleic acid. Messenger ribonucleic acids are assayed in a rabbit reticulocyte-derived, messenger-dependent, cell-free protein-synthesizing system modified from Crystal et al. (Crystal, R. G., Nienhuis, A. W., Elson, N. A., and Anderson, W.F. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 5357-5368). This system synthesizes proteins at an almost linear rate for at least 2 hours. During this period, each globin messenger ribonucleic acid directs the synthesis of several globin molecules. Each active ribosome synthesizes a globin molecule every 6 to 7 min, but only a small fraction of the ribosomes or messengers are active at any instant. Translation occurs mainly on di- and monoribosomes although larger sized polysomes also occur. Several lines of evidence suggest that globin messenger ribonucleic acid requires before it can be utilized and that a messenger activation step of protein synthesis initiation is rate-limiting in this cell-free system."
https://openalex.org/W1544647282,"The Na+-dependent transport of D-glucose was studied in brush border membrane vesicles isolated from the rabbit renal cortex. The presence of a Na+ gradient between the external incubation medium and the intravesicular medium induced a marked stimulation of D-glucose uptake. Accumulation of the sugar in the vesicles reached a maximum and then decreased, indicating efflux. The final level of uptake of the sugar in the presence of the Na+ gradient was identical with that attained in the absence of the gradient, suggesting that equilibrium was established. At the peak of the overshoot the uptake of D-glucose was more than 10-fold the equilibrium value. These results suggest that the imposition of a large extravesicular to intravesicular gradient of Na+ effects the transient movement of D-glucose into renal brush border membranes against its concentration gradient. The stimulation of D-glucose uptake into the membranes was specific for Na+. The rate of uptake was enhanced with increased concentration of Na+. Increasing Na+ in the external medium lowered the apparent Km for D-glucose. The Na+ gradient effect on D-glucose transport was dissected into a stimulatory effect when Na+ and sugar were on the same side of the membrane (cis stimulation) and an inhibitory effect when Na+ and sugar were on opposite sides of the membrane (trans inhibition). The uptake of D-glucose, at a given concentration of sugar, reflected the sum of the contributions from a Na+-dependent transport system and a Na+-independent system. The relative stimulation of D-glucose uptake by Na+ decreased as the sugar concentration increased. It is suggested, however, that at physiological concentrations of D-glucose the asymmetry of Na+ across the brush border membrane might fully account for uphill D-glucose transport. The physiological significance of the findings is enhanced additionally by observations that the Na+-dependent D-glucose transport system in the membranes in vitro possessed the sugar specificities and higg phlorizin sensitivity characteristic of more intact preparations. These results provide strong experimental evidence for the role of Na+ in transporting D-glucose across the renal proximal tubule luminal membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1575934899,"Actin is the principal constituent of the thin filaments of muscle, and in order to provide information basic to understanding the molecular basis of actin function we have studied its amino acid sequence. The isolation, compositions, and sequences of cyanogen bromide peptides, ranging in size from 3 to 44 residues, have previously been reported (ELZINGA, M. (1971) Biochemistry 10, 224-229, and other papers in the present series). The peptides have been aligned by isolation and characterization of tryptic peptides that contain methionine. The isolation of one of the CNBr peptides (CB-14) was complicated by the presence of a Met-Thr bond that was only partially split under standard conditions for cyanogen bromide cleavage in formic acid. In this paper conditions are described for increasing the cleavage at this bond. CB-14 is a tetrapeptide, Thr-Gln-Ile-Hse, and this sequence completes the characterization of the actin cyanogen bromide peptides. Finally, the position of CB-14 in the actin sequence as residues 120 to 123 was established by isolation of a chymotryptic overlap peptide. The complete sequence of the 374 residues of actin is presented."

https://openalex.org/W2099327434,"Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of nucleolar proteins of rat liver revealed marked changes at various times after partial hepatectomy. Some of the non-histone protein spots including A11, A24, A25, C13, and C14 decreased in size and density. Others, including A15, B13, B16, B18, B24-25, B27, B33, B34, C1, C2, C8, C11, C17, and C23-24 were markedly increased in size and density. In vitro labeling of the nucleoli using [gamma-32P]ATP and subsequent analysis of the proteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and autoradiography indicated that the uptake of 32P into proteins increased greatly during regeneration. In addition, the relative labelling of various spots changed throughout the regeneration process. With spot B33 as a reference, there was increased labeling of spots A1P, B2, B5, B24-25, C2, and C23-24 at 8 hours after hepatectomy. On the other hand, the labeling of spots A8P, A16, A20, B9, and B13 decreased at 8 hours after hepatectomy. Since the primary role of the nucleolus is the snythesis of ribosomal precursors, these changes in protein content and phosphorylation are presumably primarily associated with the increased processing and transport of peribosomal ribonucleoproteins in regenerating liver."

https://openalex.org/W1588279144,"Basement membrane biosynthesis in vitro was studied in a rapidly growing embryonic tissue, the rat parietal yolk sac. This tissue consists of a thick, nonvascular basement membrane (Reichert's membrane) separating two cellular layers (parietal endoderm and trophoblast). Morphologically, Reichert's membrane appeared similar to other basement membranes. Previous analysis of the amino acid and carbohydrate composition of acellular Reichert's membrane showed it to be typical of basement membranes isolated from other tissues and species. Analysis of [14-C]proline incorporation and hydroxy [14-C]proline synthesis during the third quarter ogestation in vitro showed that basement membrane collagen synthesis in the parietal yolk sac was maximal around the 14th day of gestation. At this time, basement membrane collagen represented nearly 10% of the newly synthesized protein. The collagen synthesized in this system was characteristic of basement membrane collagen in that about 11% of the total hydroxy [14-C]proline was present as the 3-isomer. In addition, after incubation in the presence of [14-C]lysine, 83 to 94% of the hydroxy[14-C]lysine was glycosylated, with the predominant form being glucosylgalactosylhydroxy[14-C]lysine. When the parietal endoderm and trophoblast were incubated separately with [14-C]proline, it was determined that the former was solely responsible for the synthesis of basement membrane collagen since essentially all of the 4-hydroxy[14-C]proline was associated with this cell type. Autoradiographic experiments with [3-H]glucosamine also served to localize the synthesis of noncollagen basement membrane glycoprotein components to the parietal endoderm. As with the results reported for basement membrane collagen secretion in embryonic chick lens cells, there appeared to be approximately a 60-min delay between the incorporation of [14-C]proline into protein and the secretion of collagen as measured by the appearance of 4-hydroxy[14-C]proline in the culture medium. Experiments utilizing [3H]glucosamine to monitor glycoprotein synthesis did not show a delay between the incorporation of [3H]glucosamine and the secretion of nondialyzable 3-H into the medium. The results obtained using the parietal yolk sac system to study basement membrane biosynthesis were compared to those previously obtained using the kidney glomerular and embryonic chick lens systems. It was concluded that the parietal yolk sac system is superior for a number of reasons: (a) the extracellular matrix appeared to contain only basement membrane components; there was no contamination by acid mucopolysaccharides or other types of collagen; (b) only a single cell type appeared to be responsible for the synthesis of basement membrane components; and (c) a relatively large percentage of the newly synthesized protein was basement membrane collagen."
https://openalex.org/W1554694411,"Kidney alkaline phosphatase was purified to homogeneity. It is a glycoprotein of about 172,000 molecular weight. Analyses of the subunit structure by sedimentation equilibrium in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate indicate that the alkaline phosphatase is a dimer comprising two very similar or identical subunits of about 87,000 molecular weight. The native enzyme contains 4.5 +/- 0.2 g atoms of zinc per mol of protein. Reconstitution experiments from the apophosphatase show that binding of 4 Zn2+ per mol of dimer is essential for full activity. The kinetic data of Zn2+ binding to the apoprotein require at least a two-step mechanism, in which one of the steps corresponds to a conformational change within the enzyme. This paper also presents data concerning amino acid composition, sugar content, enzyme stability, absorbance index, and sedimentation velocity."
https://openalex.org/W2135571644,"Bovine hepatic gamma-glutamyl hydrolase (conjugase) has been purified to homogeneity. A feature of the purification procedure was the use of high affinity macromolecular polyanion enzyme inhibitors which formed tight complexes with the enzyme altering its solubility, gel filtration, and ion exchange properties. The enzyme, which cleaves the gamma-glutamyl bonds of pteroylpolyglutamates, has a molecular weight of 108,000. It is a glycoprotein with an acid pH optimum, properties consistent with its lysosomal localization. Zinc is essential for enzyme stability. The presence of highly reactive sulfhydryl groups was evident from the extreme sensitivity to oxidizing agents and organomercurials. Very little thermal denaturation occurs below 65 degrees, but the enzyme is extremely sensitive to 0uffer anions, in keeping with the polyanionic nature of the substrate. In order to study the mechanism of action of the enzyme, a wide range of pteroylpolyglutamates, N-t-Boc polyglutamates and free polyglutamates were synthesized containing L-[U-14C]glutamic acid residues in different positions. Two pteroyltriglutamate derivatives were also synthesized in which an alpha bond replaced one of the two available gamma bonds. Time course studies of the products of the action of conjugase on these various substrates enabled us to draw the following conclusions about the enzyme: (a) peptide bond cleavage occurred only at gamma-glutamyl bonds and the presence of a COOH-terminal gamma bond was essential for enzyme action; (b) bond cleavage occurred with equal facility at internal points of the peptide chain and the enzyme should therefore be more appropriately classified as an acid hydrolase; (c) longer chain gamma-glutamyl peptides were preferentially attacked by the enzyme, the cleavage of diglutamyl peptides being extremely slow; and (d) cleavage of gamma bonds was independent of the NH2-terminal pteroyl moiety. Studies with polyanions such as the glycosaminoglycans and dextran sulfate supported the concept that the polyanion structure of the substrate was a major factor in substrate-active site interaction."

https://openalex.org/W1505092179,"As a part of a study of the complete amino acid sequence of actin we have determined the sequences of five cyanogen bromide peptides, which together contain 158 amino acid residues, including the two ends of the molecule. The five peptides are: CB-13 (residues 1 to 44 in the intact chain), CB-11 (residues 83 to 119), CB-12 (residues 228 to 268), CB-8 (residues 283 to 298), and CB-9 (residues 355 to 374). Each of the peptides except CB-11 has one sulfhydryl group, and these peptides thus account for 4 of the 5 cysteines in actin. The reactivity of actin --SH groups toward N-ethylmaleimide was investigated, and it was found that Cys-373 (in CB-9 adjacent to the COOH-terminal phenylalanine) is the first to react with this reagent."
https://openalex.org/W1507518002,"UDP-D-Galactose:D-xylose galactosyltransferase, a membrane-bound enzyme which catalyzes the second glycosyl transfer reaction in the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate chains, has been solubilized and partially purified from embryonic chick cartilage. Solubilization was effected by treatment of a particulate fraction of a homogenate (sedimenting between 10,000 and 100,000 times g) with the nonionic detergent Nonidet P-40 (0.5%) and KCl (0.5 M) or by the alkali-detergent method described previously (Helting, T. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 815-822). The applicability of the salt-detergent procedure as a general method for solubilization of membrane-bound glycosyltransferases was tested by assay of four other glycosyltransferases involved in chondroitin sulfate synthesis (UDP-D-xylose:core protein xylosyltransferase, UDP-D-galactose:4-O-beta-D-galactosyl-D-xylose galactosyltransferase, UDP-D-glucuronic acid: 3-O-beta-D-galactosyl-D-galactose glucuronosyltransferase, and UDP-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine: (GlcUA-GalNAc-4-sulfate)4 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase). In each case, greater than 70% of the activity was solubilized and, on gel chromatography on Sephadex G-200, the enzymes appeared largely in included positions and partially separated from each other. After partial purification by gel chromatography on Sephadex G-200, UDP-D-galactose:D-xylose galactosyltransferase was purified further by chromatography on one of several affinity matrices, i.e. xylosylated core protein of cartilage proteoglycan coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose, a core protein matrix saturated with UDP-D-xylose:core protein xylosyltransferase or UDP-D-xylose:core protein xylosyltransferase covalently bound to Sepharose. The specific activities of the enzyme preparations obtained by these procedures were approximately 1000-fold greater than that of the crude homogenate."
https://openalex.org/W2254020618,"The two stages in the activation of human plasminogen by urokinase have been examined kinetically in order to evaluate the significance of each stage in the activation process. The cleavage of the preactivation peptide from the NH2 terminus of native plasminogen (NH2-terminal glutamic acid) is clearly catalyzed by urokinase and is the rate-limiting first step in activation (Stage 1); this reaction is 20-fold slower than the conversion of the intermediate plasminogen (NH2-terminal lysine) to plasmin (Stage 2). Both lysine and its analogoue, epsilon-aminocaproic acid, exert two effects on the activation of native plasminogen. At low concentrations of these agents, activation is greatly accelerated. Analysis of activation in the presence and absence of these agents by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis indicates that the activation pathway is the same in both cases with the formation of a transient intermediate plasminogen; only the kinetics of proteolysis are altered. This enhancement in the rate of activation results solely from acceleration of the Stage 1 reaction; Stage 2 is essentially unaffected at low concentrations. Stage 1 is maximally enhanced (75-fold) at either 0.0025 M epsilon-aminocaproic acid or 0.025 M lysine and occurs 4 times more rapidly than Stage 2, which becomes the rate-limiting step at these concentrations. Plasmin also cleaves the preactivation peptide from native plasminogen and this reaction rate is enhanced by the same concentrations of lysine and epsilon-aminocaproic acid. These data suggest that lysine and epsilon-aminocaproic acid, which are known to bind to plasminogen and significantly alter its conformation, may thereby enhance preactivation peptide cleavage and consequently, plasminogen activation. At high concentrations, both Stages 1 and 2 are similarly inhibited by these agents, which suggests that this effect may be exerted by the direct inhibition of urokinase. The relative rates of preactivation peptide cleavage by the enzymes urokinase, plasmin, thrombin, and ancrod were also determined. Urokinase is 10 times more effective than plasmin in catalyzing this reaction and 1.8 X 10(4) times more effective than thrombin, while ancrod does not exert an effect. No plasmin is formed by either thrombin or ancrod."
https://openalex.org/W1489232234,"The polyadenylic acid-containing messenger ribonucleic acid from rabbit reticulocyte polyribosomes, isolated by a rapid and very gentle procedure (Krystosek, A., Cawthon, M. L., and Kabat, D. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 6077-6084), sediments in a sucrose gradient in three sharp peaks, at 9 S, 17 to 18 S, and 28 S. The alpha and beta globin messenger activity follows the absorbance profile in the sucrose gradients and has its major peak at 17 to 18 S. The larger messengers are more active than 9 S messenger by approximately 2-fold per mass unit of ribonucleic acid or by at least 8-fold per molecule. The major 17 to 18 S form of globin messenger was examined further and was shown to be a 1:1 complex of 9 S messenger and 18 S ribosomal ribonucleic acid. The effect of 18 S ribosomal ribonucleic acid on translation of purified 9 S globin messenger was analyzed in a messenger-dependent protein-synthesizing system (Krystosek, A., Cawthon, M. L., and Kabat, D. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 6077-6084). In the absence of exogenous ribosomal ribonucleic acid, 9 S messenger is inefficiently translated; a large excess of messenger is required to saturate the system; and globin is synthesized mainly on di- and monoribosomes. Exogenous liver or reticulocyte 18 S ribosomal ribonucleic acid potentiates 9 S messenger translation and renders it at least 10 times more efficient. The potentiation reaction can also be accomplished by increasing the concentration of ribosomes in the assay system. However, transfer or messenger ribonucleic acids cannot carry out this reaction. It is proposed that 9 S globin messenger ribonucleic acid is an inactive molecule which is normally potentiated by specific reversible base pairing with an accessible region of ribosomal ribonucleic acid contained in a 40 S ribosomal subunit. The potentiated messenger interacts with initiation factors and with other ribosomal subunits to synthesize protein. Potentiation is the first specific function in protein synthesis demonstrated for the ribosomal ribonucleic acid portion of ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1515400394,"Previous studies have shown that mouse fetal erythroid precursor cells isolated by an immunological technique synthesize little or no globin and contain little, if any, globin mRNA, as assayed in a cell-free system (translatable mRNA). After culture for 10 hours in the presence of erythropoietin, there is a marked increase in globin synthesis and in translatable globin mRNA. The present studies were designed to measure directly the content of globin mRNA sequences during erythroid cell differentiation, by molecular hybridization with 3H-labeled DNA complementary to globin mRNA. The results indicate that few, if any, globin mRNA sequences are present in the total RNA of erythroid precursor cells. There is little or no pool of untranslated globin mRNA in these cells. After 10 hours of culture with erythropoietin, there is an increase in globin mRNA content, as ;easured by a change in the Cot1/2 values obtained by cDNA: mRNA hybridization with (Co) representing the concentration of RNA. Between 0 and 22 hours of culture, there is a 250-fold rise, and between 22 and 44 hours, a further 2-fold increase in globin mRNA content. During the 44 hours in culture, the number of cells in culture increases 2- to 3-fold. The number of globin mRNA molecules rises in erythroid precursor cells to an average value of 1800 molecules/cell during 22 hours of culture. In cultures without added erythropoietin, the absolute number of cells decreases, however, cells presumably induced to differentiate by exposure to erythropoietin in vivo continue to differentiate in vitro, accumulating globin mRNA and initiating globin synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1499867396,"Alpha Hydroxylation of lignoceric acid (n-tetracosanoic acid) to cerebronic acid (2-hydroxylignoceric acid) by postnuclear preparations of brains from developing rat, mouse, and several neurological mouse mutants was studied. The preparations of brains from jimpy and myelin synthesis deficiency (msd) mice were found to synthesize cerebronic acid at less than 10 percent of their control rates, and those from quaking and dilute-lethal approximately 30 and 50 percent, respectively. The apparent low rate of in vitro hydroxylation by brains of the mutant mice appeared to be due to decreased synthesis rather than increased oxidation of cerebronic acid. Mixing experiments eliminated the possibility of an inhibitor in the mutant or an activator in normal animals. The preparations of brains from wabbler-lethal, ducky, and weaver mice showed normal activity. The developmental pattern of the hydroxylase activity was examined in quaking, jimpy, and their control mice. In normal brains the hydroxylase activity was low in the immediate postnatal period, increased sharply between 10 and 20 days after birth, and fell to a low level following maturation of the brain. The hydroxylase activity in quaking mice changed similarly during brain development but at a much reduced level. The brains of jimpy mice had barely detectable hydroxylase activity which changed little with age and reached a peak at about 15 days postpartum. The subnormal hydroxylase activity in brains of quaking mice and the near absence in brains of jimpy and msd mice correlate with the observations that myelin deficiency is more severe in jimpy and msd than in quaking. These results suggest a close association of the synthesis of cerebronic acid with the synthesis of the characteristic myelin lipid that is cerebroside (N-acyl sphingosine beta-D-galactoside)."
https://openalex.org/W1527085147,"KB cells were synchronized by a double thymidine block procedure. An investigation was made of the activities of alpha-L-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.51), alpha-D-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.22), beta-D-galactosidase (ec 3.2.1.23), alpha-D-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.20), beta-D-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21), alpha-D-mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.24), beta-D-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.53), and beta-D-N-acetylglucosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.52) from synchronized cultures, using appropriate artificial substrates. Ceramide glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.45) and ceramide trihexosidase levels (EC 3.2.1.47) were also investigated at various stages in the cell cycle, using appropriate glycosphingolipid substrates. Whereas each of these enzymes exhibited some activity throughout the cell cycle, peak activity (2- to 6-fold increase) occurred late in the S phase. Two molecular forms of ceramide glucosidase (optimal activity at pH 4.0 and pH 6.0) and two forms of ceramide trihexosidase (pH 4.0 and pH 7.5) were identified. Peak levels of the forms that preferred the relatively acid pH occurred earlier in the S phase of the cell cycle than those of the forms that were more active at the higher pH. The possibility that the forms with optimal activity at pH 4 are precursors of those with optimal activity at pH 6 to 7.5 is discussed. Precipitation of beta-galactosidase of synchronized KB cells with specific antibody revealed that changes in the activity of this enzyme during the cell cycle were the result of fluctuations in the amount of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1535649243,"Studies are reported on the influence of Triton X-100 on the molecular weight and functional properties of the acetylcholine receptor. Results are presented principally for receptors purified from Torpedo californica and Torpedo marmorata with a limited number of observations on the receptor from Electrophorus electricus. In equilibrium dialysis measurements Trito, X-100 greatly reduced acetylcholine binding to the high affinity sites of the receptor from T. californica, but had only a small effect on the sites of lower affinity. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments on receptor in the absence of added Triton X-100 revealed average apparent molecular weight values of 510,000 for receptor from T. californica and 665,000 for T. marmorata. Under those conditions 0.113 mg of residual Triton X-100 were found per mg of protein as determined by using 3H-labeled Triton X-100. The sedimentation data indicated the presence of more than one molecular species, involving a unit with an apparent molecular weight of 330,000 and higher aggregates. Upon addition of Triton X-100, the higher aggregates were reduced, and above 0.1 percent Triton X-100 the 330,000 unit was the principal component present for receptor from all three species examined. Various structural models are considered in the light of this value, the polypeptide size from Na dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, and the protomer size determined by the molecular weight of an acetylcholine binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1577694634,"The turnover of rat liver lysosomal proteins was studied by a double isotope-labeling technique. The cellular fractions investigated included soluble lysosomal proteins, lysosomal membrane proteins, highly purified lysosomal beta-glucuronidase, and for comparison, microsomal proteins and soluble cytoplasmic proteins. Both normal lysosomes and Triton WR-1339-filled lysosomes (tritosomes) were studied, with similar results. It was found that (a) the turnover rate of lysosomal proteins, of both the soluble and membranous compartments, was very similar to that of the proteins of the microsomal and soluble cytoplasmic fractions, and (b) the turnover rate of lysosomal proteins was asynchronous. The latter conclusion was based on two lines of evidence: (a) lysosomal beta-glucuronidase had a distinctly slower turnover rate than the average rate of the soluble lysosomal proteins, and (b) subunits of the proteins of the soluble lysosomal fraction as separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate. Sephadex G-200 gel filtration showed different rates of degradation."

https://openalex.org/W1499887880,"Cultures of chick tendon fibroblasts were capable of normal ATP production and protein synthetic activity even though the normally high rate of glycolysis was markedly reduced by substitution of pyruvate for glucose. Iodoacetate and 2-deoxyglucose reduced ATP levels and protein synthesis even in the presence of pyruvate. Under these conditions, both inhibitors were shown to have effects on the energy metabolism of cells which were apparently unrelated to an inhibition of glycolysis. Selective inhibition of either glycolysis, by incubation in glucose-free medium, or of oxidative phosphorylation, by incubation with an uncoupler, was shown to have little effect on cellular ATP levels or intracellular transport and secretion of collagen. However, inhibition of both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation resulted in decreased cellular ATP levels and an inhibition of collagen secretion. This effect was not due to a requirement for continued protein synthesis, since inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide or puromycin had little effect on collagen secretion. The ATP requirement for intracellular transport and secretion is discussed in relation to the secretory pathway for collagen."

All of the pea ctDNA molecules that were examined had identical gross base sequences. Denaturation maps were constructed at denaturation levels of 2.5%, 22%, and 44%. These denaturation maps showed that the circular pea ctDNA contained six small AT-rich regions on one-half of the DNA molecule, and two small GC-rich regions on the other half of the DNA molecule. The structure of pea ctDNA circular dimers was also examined. The results showed that the pea ctDNA circular dimers consisted of two monomer length units integrated in tandem repeat."
https://openalex.org/W1515900351,"We investigated how changes in tryptophan pyrrolase activity and tryptophan loads affect the breakdown of tryptophan was estimated by injecting rats with [ring-2-14-C]tryptophan and measuring respiratory 14-CO2. We concluded, contrary to previous reports, that induction of tryptophan pyrrolase definitely will increase the rate of tryptophan breakdown. Tryptophan loads also increase tryptophan breakdown even in circumstances where there is no increase in tryptophan pyrrolase activity, presumably by increasing the saturation of the enzyme. After a tryptophan load (50 mg per kg) the increase in liver tryptophan concentration lasts only 30 min. The rapid return of liver tryptophan to normal may be due partly to the high turnover rate of liver tryptophan. We estimate that tryptophan pyrrolase degrades tryptophan in vivo at a rate that is equivalent to the whole liver tryptophan concentration in 7.5 min or less."

https://openalex.org/W1610251264,"The alpha,beta eliminations of NH3 from L-histidine and 4-fluoro-L-histidine by histidine ammonia-lyase appear to occur by similar mechanisms, although a large difference in Vmax for the two reactions was observed. Both reactions were shown to be reversible with an equilibrium constant of 4 to 5. The presteady state kinetics of the deamination of 4-fluoro-L-histidine indicates that the rate-determining step precedes the dissociation of ammonia from the enzyme. The isotope effect of 1.4 to 2.0 observed with 4-fluoro-DL-[beta-2-H2]histidine or DL-[beta-2-H2]histidine or DL-[beta-2-H2]histidine indicates that the C-H bond breakage is at least partially rate-determining for the deamination of both substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1571909580,"The enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate:uridine-5-diphospho-N-acetyl-2-amino-2-deoxyglucose-3-enolpyruvyltransferase, which catalyzes the transfer of enolpyruvate from phosphoenolpyruvate to uridine diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine with the liberation of Pi, was found to form a covalent intermediate with the enolpyruvate moiety. Radioactivity from [1-14-C]phosphoenolpyruvate in the forward reaction and from UDP-GlNAc-[1-14-C]enolpyruvate in the reverse reaction was incorporated into the enzyme and remained bound to the protein after precipitation with ammonium sulfate or treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate and heat. This incorporation from UDP-GlcNAc-[1-14-C]enolpyruvate took place in the absence of Pi. When [32-P,1-14C]phosphoenolpyruvate was used, only 14-C appeared to be incorporated. In the forward reaction, the incorporation was contingent on the removal of UDP-GlcNAc from the transferase. Consistent with the formation of an enzyme-enolpyruvate intermediate, exchange of UDP-[6-3-H]GlcNAc with UDP-GlcNAc-enolpyruvate was observed in the absence of Pi. Nonstoichiometric incorporation of 3H from 3H2O into the product, UDP-GlcNAc-enolpyruvate, was observed and was shown to be due to a product isotope effect. Based on these observations, a mechanism of action for this enzyme is proposed which involves synchronous addition-elimination followed by a second addition-elimination step."

https://openalex.org/W1596835813,"The binding of Ni-2+ and Mn-2+ to thiamin phosphate and thiamin pyrophosphate (thiamin-PP) has been compared with the binding of these ions to oxythiamin phosphate and oxythiamin pyrophosphate, analogues of thiamin in which the C-4 amino group has been replaced by an -OH group. The replacement of the NH2 group results in reduced basicity of N-1 of the pyrimidine ring of oxythiamine derivatives. The effects of pD, ligand concentration, and temperature on the binding of metal ions to N-1 have been studied by observing the metal ion-induced shifting and broadening of the C-6-H signal of these compounds. The results indicate the following: (a) the metal ion is held near N-1, resulting in a folded conformation, because of a favorable bonding interaction between N-1 and the metal ion rather than for general conformational reasons alone; and (b) the amount of folded conformation present in the different pyrophosphate complexes at neutral pH follows the order: Ni-2+-thiamin-PP greater than Mn-2+-thiamin-PP greater than Mn-2+-oxythiamin-PP and Ni-2+-oxythiamin-PP It is concluded that the strength of the metal ion-pyrimidine interaction in the folded conformation depends strongly both on the coordination affinity of the metal ion and on the basicity of N-1. Since the interaction of the phosphate-bound metal ion with the pyrimidine ring in the Mg-2+-thiamin-PP complex is probably weaker than the corresponding interaction in the Mn-2+-thiamin-PP complex, these results predict that the Mg-2+-thiamin-PP complex in solution, at neutral pH, exists predominantly in an unfolded conformation."

https://openalex.org/W1515418841,"A phosphopeptide which contains 14 residues including phosphoserine and which is derived from the NH2-terminal region of skeletal muscle glycogen phosphorylase (Nolan, C., Novoa, W. B., Krebs, E. G., and Fischer, E. H. (1964) Biochemistry 3, 542-551) has been shown to induce the enzymic properties of phosphorylase a in phosphorylase b and b'. When phosphorylase b is incubated with the phosphorylated tetradecapeptide, the following changes occur: (1) the enzyme becomes partially catalytically active in the absence of AMP; (2) the allosteric interactions of the enzyme are altered, as evidenced by the fact that phosphorylase b does not bind AMP cooperatively, and is no longer inhibited by glucose-6-P; and (3) the enzyme, normally present as a dimer, associates to a tetramer. Phosphorylase b' is a modified form of phosphorylase in which the phosphorylation site has been removed by limited tryptic attack. In the presence of phosphopeptide, 86% of the total enzyme activity can be induced in the absence of AMP. The properties of phosphorylases b and b' with phosphopeptide, cited above, are all characteristics of the phosphonenzyme, phosphorylase a. In addition, evidence is presented that these effects are specific. They are not the result of the polycationic nature of the peptide since they cannot be duplicated by spermine, and the phosphate group must also be present for the peptide to effect changes on the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1579348509,"A calorimetric study of the thermodynamic parameters for the binding of adenosine, AMP, ADP, and ATP to L-glutamate dehydrogenase shows that the variation of deltaG0 of binding is quite small and is correlated qualitatively both with the effectiveness of these ribonucleotides as activators of the L-glutamate dehydrogenase reaction and with size (for the first three). Much larger variations are observed for the deltaH0 of binding largely compensated by changes in deltaS0, with a zig-zag dependence on the number of phosphate groups. For comparison, the binding parameters are also obtained for the deoxyribose analogs of these compounds as well as cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate and purine riboside. Salt concentration and buffer composition were shown to affect mainly the entropy changes for ADP binding; and the deltaCp values for binding of AMP and ADP to the enzyme are quite small. It is suggested that the general area of the enzyme surface which includes the binding sites for ADP and its analogs contains a number of functional groups, each capable of an energetically small interaction with some group on one or more of the ligands, but so located that even the largest ligand cannot interact with all of them simultaneously. Each ligand minimizes the free energy of the system by selecting the best pattern of such individual interactions permitted by its geometry. Such a pattern of microheterogeneity of ligand-protein interactions may be a major source of the known specificity of binding in biological systems."
https://openalex.org/W1577546768,"Reaction of tetranitromethane with the lone tyrosine residue of bovine neurophysin I and II, tyrosine-49, gave nitro derivatives of these proteins which were obtained in a highly purified form by preparative electrophoresis. Equilibrium dialysis experiments indicated clearly that oxytocin binding remained essentially unaffected by the chemical modification of tyrosine-49. However, in the case of (8-lysine)vasopressin, the nitrated protein was found to bind only 1 hormone molecule in contrast to the 2 vasopressin molecules bound by the native protein. Ultraviolet absorption difference spectroscopy measurements between 250 nm and 300 nm indicated that upon binding of (2-phenylalanine, 8-lysine)vasopressin, tyrosine-49 of native neurophysin undergoes a change of microenvironment from less to more polar surroundings. Studies of the nitrotyrosyl-49 chromophore of neurophysin by ab sorption spectroscopy in the absence and presence of oxytocin or (8-lysine)vasopressin confirmed this finding. Since dimethylsulfoxide solvent perturbation studies suggested that in the Cys(Me)-Phe-Ile-NH2-neurophysin I complex, tyrosine-49 is more exposed to solvent than in neurophysin I alone, it is concluded that this residue is unmasked by conformational changes upon complex formation."
https://openalex.org/W279266329,"In each of three separate experiments, female guinea pigs in groups of 20 were given 4 units of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) each day for 3 days, while controls were given saline. Na125I was injected on the 3rd day, and the animals were killed 22 hours later. The pooled throids of each group were homogenized, and thyroglobulin was purified by one of the following methods: gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 followed by density gradient ultracentrifugation, two sequential filtrations on 4 percent agarose, or filtration on 4 percent agarose followed by Sephadex G-200. TSH administration was associated with the folling changes in thyroglobulin: (1) an increase in the ratio of tri-iodothyronine to thyroxine; (2) a decrease in dissociation of the 19 S to the 12 S form; (3) an alteration in its pattern on gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea; and (4) changes in its amino acid composition, with significant increases in the content of lysine (by 15 percent), isoleucine (by 15 percent), and methionine (by 7 percent) relative to leucine. Over-all, there were no significant changes in the content of iodine, fucose, hexosamine, or sialic acid. These data show that TSH can alter the composition of thyroglobulin independently of its effects on iodine content. We suggest that these changes may stem from alterations in the subunit composition of thyroglobulin. There were also small but significant variations in amino acid composition among the three preparations of thyroglobulin from saline-treated animals and among the three from the TSH-treated. This finding shows that thyroglobulin can be heterogeneous in its protein portion as well as in its iodine content."

Experimental evidence is presented to support the following conclusions. (a) Long chain 1,2-alkanediols serve as direct precursors of the 2-hydroxyalkyl moieties of both choline and ethanolamine glycerophosphatides. (b) 1,2-Alkanediols are oxidized to 1-hydroxy-2alkanones which serve as precursors of the 2-oxoalkyl moieties of the glycerophosphatides. (c) Oxidations of hydroxy groups and reductions of oxo groups do not occur at the phospholipids, but are confined to 1,2-alkanediols and 1-hydroxy-2-alkanones, respectively.

Amino acid analysis of this form of the enzyme (isoenzyme 2) reveals an absence of cystine or cysteine, and sedimentation studies indicate a molecular weight of 20,800. The NH2-terminal sequence was determined by Edman degradation of the intact protein and the COOH terminus by selective tritiation and by carboxypeptidase treatment. After the action of trypsin on the citraconylated protein, seven of the expected nine peptides were purified from the digest, and after cyanogen bromide treatment of the unmodified protein, all seven of the anticipated peptides were isolated. The amino acid composition of all of these peptides has been established as well as their complete or partial sequences. From the results it was possible to order these peptides within the sequence and to establish the sequence of the NH2-terminal 60 residues and the COOH-terminal 11 residues."

As was previously reported (ISHIMURA, Y., NORZAKI, M., HAYAISHI, O., TAMURA, M., AND YAMAZAK-I I. (1970) J. Biol. Chem. 245, 3593-3602), we observe that the fully reduced form of pseudomonad tryptophan oxygenase during steady state catalysis exists predominantly as the L-tryptophan ferroheme-O2 enzyme complex (lambdamax = 415 nm, 540 nm, 570 nm). However, during steady state catalysis by a half-reduced form of both the pseudomonad and hepatic enzymes, the predominant species present manifest absorption spectra indicative of ternary complexes in which all the heme exists as ferriheme (Soret, 407 nm), there being no trace of a ferroheme-O2 complex. Carbon monoxide is a competitive inhibitor with respect to molecular oxygen of catalysis by either the half-reduced or fully reduced forms of pseudomonad tryptophan oxygenase. During steady state catalysis in the presence of CO, the fully reduced form of the enzyme exists as a mixture of the oxyferroheme (Soret = 415 nm) and carboxyferroheme (Soret = 421 nm) enzyme complexes. However, if the same experiment is repeated with the half-reduced form of the pseudomonad enzyme, all of the enzyme is in the ferriheme state, even though CO is inhibiting this form of the enzyme to the same degree as it does the fully reduced form. We conclude that for the half-reduced form of pseudomonad tryptophan oxygenase the substrate, O2, and the inhibitor, CO, are not binding to the heme moieties, but are bound elsewhere, presumably to the Cu(I) moieties. Examination of the kinetic mechanisms of the half-reduced and fully reduced forms of pseudomonad tryptophan oxygenase using the inhibitors carbon monoxide and 5-fluorotryptophan confirmed that the fully reduced enzyme binds L-tryptophan before O2 (FORMAN, H., AND FEIGELSON, P. (1971) Biochemistry 10, 760-763) and that for the half-reduced enzyme O2 binds first. In the presence of 5-fluorotryptophan a relatively stable oxyferroheme enzyme complex was generated with the fully reduced form of pseudomonad tryptophan oxygenase. Thus, saturation of the catalytic site alone either with the substrate, L-tryptophan, or the competitive inhibitor, 5-fluorotryptophan, enhances binding of O2 to the ferroheme moieties of the enzyme. The resistance of this complex to photolysis indicates that the bound molecular oxygen is predominantly present as superoxide, O2-minus."

Tryptic digestion of actin followed by isolation of the methionine-containing overlap peptides permitted the unique alignment of most, but not all of the cyanogen bromide peptides. However, maleylation of the actin molecule followed by tryptic digestion and isolation of methionine-containing peptides from maleylated actin permitted the proper placement of the remaining cyanogen bromide peptides. The ordering of cyanogen bromide peptides, together with the amino acid sequence of the individual peptides, constitutes the entire amino acid sequence of rabbit skeletal muscle actin (ELZINGA, M., COLLINS, J.
