https://openalex.org/W2000014089,"Free polysomes and a mixture of free and membrane-attached polysomes were isolated separately from rat liver, and each was added to a cell-free, protein-synthesizing system. The free polysomes showed a greater capacity than the mixed polysome population for incorporation of (14)C-leucine into ferritin, whereas the reverse was true for (14)C-leucine incorporation into albumin."

https://openalex.org/W1567675832,"Abstract Deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase has been purified from nuclei of rapidly dividing sea urchin embryos, Strongylocentrotus franciscanus and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. No gross differences between the enzymes from the two species were observed. The DNA polymerases are heat-labile and are stabilized in the presence of polyglycols. This enhanced stabilization was exploited throughout the purification procedure. The enzymes, purified more than 300-fold, have a molecular weight of approximately 150,000. However, under certain conditions larger aggregates have also been noted. No DNase activity was detected in the most purified fraction. The DNA polymerase activity is totally dependent on the presence of added DNA. For maximum activity the presence of all four deoxynucleoside triphosphates and Mg++ are required. Native double stranded DNA is a more effective primer than single stranded DNA. Native DNA which has been degraded to a limited extent with pancreatic deoxyribonuclease is the most efficient primer."

https://openalex.org/W1570350390,"Abstract The neutral salt-soluble collagen which accumulates in the tissues of animals treated with penicillamine does not differ from normal in amino acid composition, specific optical rotation, and melting temperature. It has higher intrinsic viscosity, possibly due to a contamination with higher molecular weight aggregates originating from the depolymerization of insoluble collagen. In contrast to the aldehyde-deficient lathyritic collagen, the penicillamine collagen has an aldehyde content greater than normal and rapidly forms stable cross-links in vitro. Binding studies, involving film and equilibrium dialysis, revealed a significant interaction between collagen and compounds with a free α-aminothiol structure. The binding capacity of various collagens tested is proportional to their aldehyde content, and reduction with NaBH4 eliminates this interaction. Reduction of these aldehydes, amidination of the e-amino groups of lysine and hydroxylysine, or addition of sodium bisulfite (10-4 m) causes neutral salt-soluble collagen to behave like lathyritic collagen. It is postulated that the inhibition of cross-linking caused by penicillamine in vivo and in vitro involves a reversible interaction with the aldehydes present in tropocollagen to form a thiazolidine type complex, since compounds with adjacent free sulfhydryl and amino groups are necessary for activity. The solubilizing effect exhibited by α-amino-β-thiols on an incompletely cross-linked form of insoluble collagen as well as the generation of soluble collagen with a high aldehyde content can be attributed to the splitting of a Schiff's base intermediate. The structure which is responsible for the initial stabilization of the collagen fiber can be reduced with NaBH4, rendering the collagen insoluble in penicillamine."

The purified enzyme gives a single band on polyacrylamide disc electrophoresis and will not hydrolyze methyl butyrate, triolein, or secondary alcohol esters. Data are presented that strongly suggest that the cholesterol ester-synthesizing and -hydrolyzing activities in pancreatic juice are a function of the same enzyme. The pH optima are 6.2 for synthesis and pH 6.6 for hydrolysis of cholesterol esters. Using an equimolar mixture of fatty acids, the relative rates of cholesterol ester formation were oleate, 100; linoleate, 71; palmitate, 56; stearate, 43; and laurate, 11. For cholesterol ester hydrolysis, with a micellar substrate system, the rates were oleate, 100; palmitate, 107; stearate, 104; and linoleate, 55. Data are also presented on the effects of ions and inhibitors, and on the cofactor function of bile salts in the enzymatic reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1516091922,"Abstract The dicarboxylic acid shuttle in adipose tissue and its role in the conversion of pyruvate to glyceride-glycerol has been studied in rat epididymal fat pads in vitro. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and pyruvate carboxylase have also been measured in rat liver and the adaptive response of these enzymes to alterations in diet has been compared to alterations of these enzymes in adipose tissue from the same animals. Fasting for 24 hours caused a 5-fold increase in the activity of P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase in adipose tissue and a 3-fold increase in the activity of the enzyme in liver. Fasting for periods longer then 24 hours reduced the increase in P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase in adipose tissue. Actinomycin D blocked this increase in activity in adipose tissue but had no effect in liver. Refeeding the animals for 24 hours after fasting for 24 hours reduced the activity of P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase to levels below those of normal fed rats. The stimulatory effect of fasting on P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase activity in adipose tissue but not liver was markedly age-dependent, being reduced in older rats. Pyruvate carboxylase, unlike P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase, was found in both the mitochondria and cytosol of liver and adipose tissue. Fasting, and fasting followed by refeeding, had no effect on pyruvate carboxylase activity in adipose tissue but fasting caused a 2-fold increase in the activity of the enzyme in rat liver cytosol without affecting the mitochondrial enzyme. The conversion of pyruvate-3-14C (25 mm) to glyceride-glycerol by rat epididymal fat pads in vitro was increased by fasting. Actinomycin D blocked this increase, and refeeding the animals after fasting reduced the incorporation to levels below those found in adipose tissue from normal fed rats. At a pyruvate concentration of 25 mm, fatty acid synthesis was not significantly different in adipose tissue from normal and 24-hour-fasted rats. At lower pyruvate concentrations (0.25 mm) relatively more pyruvate was incorporated into glyceride-glycerol than into fatty acids in adipose tissue from fasted rats. In an attempt to measure the relative contribution of pyruvate and glucose carbon to the synthesis of glyceride-glycerol and fatty acid, adipose tissue was incubated with both substrates together at varying concentrations with only one of the substrates labeled and with insulin present. These experiments showed that glucose was more effective than pyruvate as a precursor of glyceride-glycerol while the converse was found for fatty acid synthesis. On the basis of these results it is suggested that P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase and pyruvate carboxylase are important catalytically for the formation of glyceride-glycerol from pyruvate in adipose tissue, and that this pathway may have physiological importance during fasting."
https://openalex.org/W1519782453,"The fully alkylated derivatives of harbor seal and porpoise apomyoglobin have been subjected to chymotryptic hydrolysis. In each case, the products were completely soluble at pH 2.0 in contradistinction to the tryptic hydrolysates. The purified peptides have been subjected to sequence analysis and amide identification and, in conjunction with the tryptic peptides, aligned to produce the complete sequence of each myoglobin. The resulting structures, when compared to the established sperm whale structure, indicate a close similarity among all three proteins. The sperm whale protein differs from that of seal in 26 positions but from that of porpoise in only 15 positions. The seal and porpoise proteins differ at 17 positions. All of the amino acid replacements were confined to 29 positions, leaving 124 of 153 positions in the sequence invariant in the three proteins. The relation of these data to other, partial sequences is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1560226854,"Abstract A kinase which catalyzes the phosphorylation of uridine and cytidine to uridine 5'-phosphate and cytidine 5'-phosphate, respectively, has been purified 97-fold from extracts of the Novikoff ascites rat tumor. Several nucleoside triphosphates may be used as phosphate donors; among them ATP, dUTP, dGTP, and dATP are the most effective. In contrast, UTP and CTP are potent inhibitors of the kinase. Studies on kinetics showed that the inhibition by CTP was competitive with respect to concentration of ATP and not competitive with respect to concentration of phosphate acceptor. Upon aging of the enzyme, the inhibitory effect of CTP was partially lost and CTP became effective as a phosphate donor; the catalytic activity of the enzyme was retained. From the evidence presented, it has been proposed that there exist at least three distinct binding sites on the surface of the enzyme molecule; one for the phosphate donor, one for the phosphate acceptor, and a third one for the regulatory ligand. These findings may have physiological implications in that the anabolism of pyrimidine ribonucleosides is regulated by the terminal products of the pathway, UTP and CTP."
https://openalex.org/W1519115497,"Abstract Anterior and posterior portions of the lens capsules of calf and cow eyes were obtained free of cellular material by a procedure which included ultrasonic treatment. Sugar analyses indicated that approximately 11% of the dry weight of the capsules was in the form of monosaccharide residues, which were identified as glucose, galactose, mannose, fucose, hexosamines, and sialic acids. Small amounts of hexuronic acids were also present. The hexosamines consisted of glucosamine and galactosamine, which were present in the ratios of 92:8 in the calf anterior capsule and 93:7 in the calf posterior capsule. The sialic acids consisted of both N-glycolyl- and N-acetylneuraminic acids in the ratio of 60:40 in the anterior calf capsule and 65:35 in the posterior calf capsule. Distinct differences with age were noted in the composition of the lens capsule. Cow capsules contained larger amounts of glucose and galactose, and smaller levels of mannose and hexosamine than those from calves. Decreases in the sialic acid content were observed in the older animals while the fucose remained constant with age. The posterior portions of the capsules of both age groups contained less glucose and galactose than the anterior parts, but more sialic acid and hexuronic acid. The peptide portion of the capsules was characterized by the occurrence of a large amount of glycine (approximately one-fourth of the amino acid residues), as well as of hydroxyproline (10% of the amino acid residues) and hydroxylysine (4% of the amino acid residues). In addition, all of the commonly occurring amino acids were present, including cystine, methionine and tryptophan. Amide analyses indicated that nearly half of the dicarboxylic amino acids were in the uncharged form; in the anterior calf capsule 45% of these amino acids were in the amide form. An accounting of the charged groups of the capsules indicated that each had a net positive charge; the anterior calf capsule had a positive charge of 25 per 1000 amino acid residues. Of particular note in the amino acid composition of the lens capsules was the occurrence of very high hydroxylysine to lysine and hydroxyproline to proline ratios, which increased still further with age. While the composition of these lens capsules place them in the collagen group of proteins, they appear most closely related to other extracellular membranes, such as the renal glomerular basement membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1595166360,"Abstract Continued maximal levels of incorporation of amino acids into protein in rat thymus cell suspensions require added glucose, a requirement only partially satisfied by other readily metabolized carbohydrate substrates such as pyruvate and lactate. Effects of substrates on incorporation rates correlate with their ability to generate small elevations in ATP above the levels in controls without substrate. The stimulatory effect of glucose occurs prior to its conversion to intracellular pyruvate. The effects of glucose, and other carbohydrates as well, also correlate with glucose 6-phosphate levels. The data suggest a stimulatory role for glycolytic intermediates on amino acid incorporation, mediated possibly through the effects of glycolysis on adenine nucleotides. Cortisol addition leads to an early inhibition of only the carbohydrate-dependent amino acid incorporation into protein. This hormone effect is associated with a cortisol inhibition of the ability of glucose and other carbohydrates to generate ATP, the effects on ATP in some instances preceding the effects on incorporation. With glucose as substrate, effects of cortisol on amino acid incorporation may be attributed to a prior inhibition of glucose uptake; with lactate and pyruvate as substrate, effects on substrate uptake and on the initial metabolic steps were not found. Although the inhibition of glucose uptake is not the unique action of cortisol, the results suggest that hormonal inhibition at this site has considerable physiological significance."

https://openalex.org/W1523272172,"Abstract The position of the O-sulfates in heparin was investigated by methylation procedures. Heparin was converted to the acetamido derivative and permethylated with dimethyl sulfate in aqueous alkali. Other methylation methods in organic solvents were also used. The carboxyl groups in the uronic acid moieties were then reduced and the resulting permethylated polysaccharide was hydrolyzed. The products were identified either as crystalline derivatives or by chromatography and specific color reactions. These were characterized as 3-O-methyl-d-glucose, 2,3-di-O-methyl-d-glucose, 3-O-methyl-d-glucosamine, glucosamine, and 3,6-di-O-methylglucosamine. On the basis of the amounts isolated, it is concluded that about one-third of the glucuronic acid moieties in heparin are sulfated on carbon atom 2 whereas the rest are not sulfated. Most of the glucosamine in heparin contains sulfate ester groups on carbon 6. Glucosamine units which are not sulfated and 3,6-di-O-sulfoglucosamine units are also present in small proportions. It is proposed that the degree of sulfation of the individual units in the heparin polymer is not uniform and that it may vary in different parts of the chain."
https://openalex.org/W1539699294,"Abstract [3α-3H]-Δ8-Cholesten-3β-ol has been prepared by chemical synthesis. With this labeled substrate, the conversion of Δ8-cholesten-3β-ol to Δ7-cholesten-3β-ol by rat liver microsomes has been studied in deuterated medium. The results of experiments with combined gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry indicate that the reaction proceeds with the uptake of 1 atom of solvent hydrogen and therefore provide no evidence in support of a mechanism involving an intramolecular shift of hydride from carbon atom 7 to carbon atom 9. A method for the separation of the acetate derivatives of a number of sterols on columns of neutral alumina-Super Cel-silver nitrate has been described. With this method the amount of endogenous Δ7-cholesten-3β-ol in rat liver microsomes has been estimated."
https://openalex.org/W1543585939,"Abstract Much evidence indicates that ribosomal RNA in animal cells is first synthesized as a 45 S precursor which is cleaved to form a 32 S molecule and a molecule of 18 S rRNA. The 32 S molecule is subsequently converted to 28 S rRNA. From this model it follows that the two classes of rRNA should be produced in equimolar amounts. When newly synthesized RNA in growing human lymphocytes was labeled with Urd-3H, the ratio of radioactive 18 S:32-28 S rRNA was consistent with equimolar production of the two rRNA classes, as expected. However, nongrowing lymphocytes showed an apparent deficiency of new 18 S rRNA relative to the amount of 32-28 S rRNA produced. The deficiency was found to be the result of temporary retention in the nucleus of newly synthesized 32 S and 28 S rRNA which had no counterpart 18 S molecules. The extent of the 18 S deficiency was estimated from methylation studies, and was found to be about 50%. Thus, in resting lymphocytes, about half of the 18 S rRNA molecules originally synthesized are lost, presumably through degradation, if the model for rRNA production outlined above is correct. The apparent wastage of 18 S rRNA was reduced or eliminated after the lymphocytes were stimulated to grow. It is proposed that the wastage of rRNA in resting lymphocytes is part of a control mechanism which regulates lymphocyte growth by limiting the accumulation of ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1498570388,"Abstract The enzymatic conversion of the carcinogenic arylhydroxamic acid, N-hydroxy-2-fluorenylacetamide, to the o-amidophenols, N-(1-hydroxy-2-fluorenyl)acetamide and N-(3-hydroxy-2-fluorenyl)acetamide, referred to as the isomerization of N-hydroxy-2-fluorenylacetamide, by cell fractions of rat liver has been studied. Cell fractions prepared from the livers of normal rats were unable to perform the reaction. Isomerization was stimulated by 3-methylcholanthrene and several other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons administered 24 hours preceding the preparation of the cell fractions. Since dl-ethionine inhibited the stimulation of the formation of the o-amidophenols by 3-methylcholanthrene and since the inhibition was counteracted by the concurrent administration of dl-methionine, the isomerization appeared to be an induced enzymatic reaction. The isomerization proceeded optimally at a pH near 7 in phosphate buffer, Tris buffer, or deionized water and, in contrast to the microsomal p-hydroxylation of N-2-fluorenylacetamide, did not require a NADPH-generating system. N-2-Fluorenylacetamide, the substrate for the NADPH-dependent formation of the p-amidophenols, N-(7-hydroxy-2-fluorenyl)acetamide and N-(5-hydroxy-2-fluorenyl)acetamide, did not serve as a substrate for the isomerization. The isomerization was dependent on the synergistic action of two components. One of these was inducible and associated with the microsomal fraction of rat liver. The second component, localized in the soluble fraction of normal rat liver, was not dialyzable and, upon gel filtration of the soluble fraction on polyacrylamide gel, was eluted with the macromolecules excluded from the gel. Resolution of the soluble fraction on DEAE-cellulose into five subfractions and assay of each fraction indicated that the highest activity was associated with a group of proteins eluted with dilute sodium phosphate buffer at pH 4.6. The formation of the reduced metabolites, N-2-fluorenylacetamide and 2-fluorenamine, by each fraction paralleled the formation of the o-amidofluorenols. These results and the further observation that the products of the isomerization and of the reduction were present, in all fractions, in a constant proportion suggested a common intermediate for both reactions. On the basis of these data, the isomerization has been tentatively formulated as a two-step reaction. In the first step N-hydroxy-2-fluorenylacetamide is dehydroxylated to a positively charged amidonium ion by an enzyme in the soluble fraction of rat liver. The second step in which hydroxyl ions add to the electrophilic carbon atoms 1 and 3 of the resonance forms of the amidonium ion yields the o-amidofluorenols. The induced microsomal enzyme is presumed to participate in this step of the reaction. Alternatively, hydride ions may be transferred to the positively charged nitrogen of the amidonium ion to give N-2-fluorenylacetamide and, via deacetylation, 2-fluorenamine."
https://openalex.org/W1554713351,"The activity of monoseleno- and diseleno-dicarboxylic acids, and of some acid amides, was determined with respect to the prevention of dietary liver necrosis, a selenium-responsive deficiency disease in rats. Results were quantitatively compared to those obtained with selenite-selenium as a standard. The effective dose level of most of these substances is in the range of a few micrograms of selenium per 100 g of diet. The dose level producing 50% protection, ED50, of selenite-selenium is approximately 20 parts per billion. In the series of symmetrical monoseleno-dicarboxylic acids, HOOC—(CH2)n—Se—(CH2)n—COOH, the first three members (acetic to butyric acid) show very low activity. From valeric to undecanoic acid a clear-cut alternating effect is observed; the even numbered acids are rather inactive, and those with uneven numbers are potent. Results with analogous diseleno-dicarboxylic acids, HOOC —(CH2)n—Se—Se—(CH2)n—COOH, are basically different. There is no alternating effect. The first three members are biologically active, with an optimum at the C3 level. In both the mono- and the diseleno-dicarboxylic acid series a minimum of potency is seen at chain length C7, and a maximum at chain length C10 to C11. Branching of the carbon chain reduces activity. Introduction of two methyl groups at the same carbon, forming a quaternary carbon atom, eliminates biological potency almost entirely. Tests of monoseleno-dicarboxylic acids of unsymmetrical structure show that activity is not simply an additive function. Some unsymmetrical substances are more active than either of their symmetrical parent compounds. The most active substances presented in this study are monoseleno-11,11′-di-n-undecanoic acid, diseleno-4,4′-di-n-valeric acid, and diseleno-11,11′-di-n-undecanamide. Their potencies were 169, 138, and 180% of that of selenite-selenium, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1574614762,"Abstract The binding of small molecules to macromolecules can be studied by nuclear magnetic resonance since the width of a resonance can often be related to rotational correlation times and exchange rates for bound and unbound species. Line widths for carbon-linked protons of analogues of carbamyl phosphate (carbamyl-P) in the presence of the catalytic subunit of aspartate transcarbamylase are a measure of the rotational freedom of the bound analogues. The protons of phosphonacetamide are broadened considerably in the presence of the subunit, while those of N-methyl phosphonacetamide and methyl phosphonate are not, indicating that an interaction between the [see PDF for structure] group of the analogue and the enzyme limits rotation about the P—C bond in the first instance but not in the latter two. The resonance line width for the methylene protons of 0.025 m succinate, a competitive inhibitor of aspartate, is 0.48 Hz in the absence of enzyme at pH 7, increases slightly when catalytic subunit (20 mg per ml) is added, but increases to 2.00 Hz upon the further addition of 0.025 m carbamyl-P. In this case, the broadening is due primarily to an increase in the lifetime of the succinate-enzyme complex, induced by carbamyl-P. Some analogues of carbamyl-P, for example phosphonacetamide and acetyl phosphate, induce broadening but others, including N-methyl phosphonacetamide, N-methyl carbamyl phosphate, and methyl phosphonate, do not. Only analogues which are not larger than carbamyl-P and which have a carbonyl group in addition to a phosphate or phosphonate dianion induce the broadening of the succinate line. The resonance for the protons of malonate, another inhibitor of aspartate, is also broadened by carbamyl-P and phosphonacetamide in the presence of the catalytic subunit. Dissociation constants determined at pH 7 confirm that carbamyl-P is the most effective analogue in inducing succinate binding at this pH. In addition to line widths, chemical shifts of the bound species have been determined for some of the analogues. The chemical shifts suggest that an aromatic ring is near the binding site for phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1578336597,"Abstract The reaction of fumarase with several alkylating agents has been examined. The structural similarity between these compounds and the natural substrates for the enzyme, fumarate and malate, suggested that reaction might occur with structures in the active sites. Of all the compounds tested, only iodoacetate and 4-bromocrotonate inactivated fumarase by modification of structures other than the thiol groups. Because the thiol groups appear to fulfill a structural role in the enzyme, it is possible that iodoacetate and bromocrotonate react specifically with fumarase. The enzyme is inactivated to an extent of 80 to 90% when only 3 to 6 eq of each compound have reacted with the enzyme. Inactivation by each compound is reduced markedly by substrates and competitive inhibitors, and extensive structural changes do not occur after inactivation. S-Carboxymethylmethionine and 3-carboxymethylhistidine are the major derivatives found after inactivation with iodoacetate. The distribution of these carboxymethyl derivatives among the tryptic peptides of iodoacetate-inactivated fumarase has been examined. From 80 to 85% of the S-carboxymethylmethionine and 3-carboxymethylhistidine present in the modified enzyme have been recovered in three unique peptides."

This enzymatic activity was shown to be widely distributed. The tautomerase was separated from several other enzyme activities, including p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate keto-enol tautomerase. Several spectrophotometric assays for oxalacetate tautomerization were developed in the directions of both enolization and ketonization. The sensitivities of each system to changes in pH, ionic strength, and protein concentration were compared. The most useful method for following oxalacetate ketonization is the reaction coupled to the malate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reduction of the keto form of oxalacetate to malate. This coupled assay gives direct evidence for the keto form of oxalacetate as the substrate for malate dehydrogenase. By a similar coupled enzymatic reaction this conclusion has been extended to citrate synthase, glutamate-oxalacetate transaminase, and oxalacetate decarboxylase. A number of activators and inhibitors for the enzymatic tautomerization of oxalacetate are presented."

https://openalex.org/W1518113049,"Abstract The impairment by inositol deprivation of the α-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) transport system of KB cells was studied under various experimental conditions. Kinetic studies under nonsteady state conditions showed that inositol deprivation causes a decrease of the Vmax of AIB influx and efflux without affecting the respective Km values. The Km for AIB influx is 0.4 to 0.5 mm, whereas for AIB efflux it is 6.2 to 6.8 mm, in both normal and inositol-deficient cells. The AIB efflux coefficients are much lower in deficient cells at all levels of intracellular AIB. When AIB exchange fluxes were studied under steady state conditions it was found that inositol deprivation causes a decrease of the influx coefficient and the Vmax. Active AIB transport requires the presence of extracellular Na+. The effect of decreasing the extracellular Na+ concentration is to increase the Km for AIB uptake without affecting the Vmax. This increase is greater in normal (11.0 mm) than in deficient cells (1.5 mm). Active AIB transport and accumulation are inhibited by ouabain. Half-maximal inhibition is obtained at 0.35 µm for AIB uptake and 0.1 µm for AIB accumulation, with both types of cells. The fraction of AIB transport sensitive to ouabain is 62% in normal and 38% in deficient cells. However, ouabain abolishes active transport in both types of cells. It is suggested that inositol deprivation impairs AIB transport because of structural alterations at the carrier sites of the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2009321937,"IN 1965 Jacobs et al.1 found seven of 196 males at Carstairs, the Scottish State Hospital, had a chromosome complement of 47, XYY and studies of the inmates of similar institutions in England2, Australia3, Denmark4 and the USA5 have confirmed this. The height of many males with a double Y chromosome was 180 cm or more. This raises the question, is there a similar high incidence of 47, XYY males among the inmates of prisons? Reports relating to prisons and other penal institutions2,6–8 have shown considerable variation in the incidence of 47, XYY males (Table 1)."

https://openalex.org/W2063513599,"FOLLOWING the work of Lohnis1, the occurrence of heat-resistant spores in aerobic nitrogen-fixing bacteria has been the subject of some controversy. The chief protagonist in recent years has been Bisset, who claimed that endospores could be demonstrated in Rhizobium from wild leguminous plants2 and in strains of tropical origin3. Bisset4 suggested that Rhizobium and Azotobacter are aberrant sporing bacilli, related to Clostridium, which has several nitrogen-fixing species, and especially to Bacillus polymyxa, which is also capable of fixing nitrogen5. Although occasional support has been given to this concept6,7, most investigators have found neither spores nor heat resistance in these bacteria. It is notable that, apparently without exception, these studies have been made on strains of Rhizobium from cultivated temperate crop plants, and thereby serve only to confirm. Bisset7apos;s finding that few of these produce spores."

https://openalex.org/W1973016616,"THERE are two principal types of gross eye movements, saccadic (flickering movements) and smooth (continuous compensatory or pursuit movements). Of the two, smooth movements have by far the lower velocity limit. An increasingly popular technique for investigation of the smooth system's performance has been to elicit pursuit of targets moving in sinusoidal motion for a range of test frequencies. One outstanding investigation1 using this method puts the smooth pursuit system's saturation point at some 20°–30°/s (that is appropriate up to only 1.0–1.5 Hz for a peak to peak target amplitude of 8.8°). This contrasts, incidentally, with the saccadic system's known ability2 to exceed 700°/s of appropriate velocity (during flicks between two fixation points)."
