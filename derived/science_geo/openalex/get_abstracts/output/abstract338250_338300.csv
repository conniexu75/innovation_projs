https://openalex.org/W2014482494,"An ecosystem perturbation experiment in which inorganic fertilizer was added to two successional old fields of different ages indicated that stability, expressed as resistance to modification by enrichment, increased during succession only at the primary trophic level. The perturbation was propagated throughout the arthropod herbivores and carnivores. Both herbivores and carnivores were less stable in the older field. In contrast to current ecological theory, greater diversity at a trophic level was accompanied by lower stability at the next higher level."
https://openalex.org/W1974268504,"Excavations have demonstrated that stone artifacts occur stratified within beds of Lower Pleistocene (or end Pliocene) age. At one site a low-density scatter of worked stone objects occurs together with small but significant quantities of broken-up bones. Potassium-argon dates indicate an age greater than 2 million years; thus, this may be the oldest known hominid occupation site. More than 20 hominid fossils have been recovered from various sedimentary formations in the area."
https://openalex.org/W2031445328,Oxygen isotopic analysis of different size groups of shells of pelagic foraminiferal species shows that some species deposit their shells at constant depths while others deposit them at increasing or decreasing depths. These patterns show regional variations. Globigerinoides rubra and Globigerinoides sacculifera remain the most convenient species for oxygen isotopic determination of the past surface temperatures of the ocean.

https://openalex.org/W2066631372,"Outside of China, the countries of southern and eastern Asia contain 30 percent of the world's population but only 2 percent of the known fossil fuel resources. Economic growth has resulted in increasing imports of petroleum and petroleum products. Because of the tenfold rise in oil prices since 1972, several of these countries are faced with two dilemmas-one short range and one long range. Unless they can discover more fossil fuel resources within their own borders, they must either incur dangerously growing foreign exchange deficits or drastically slow their economic growth. Research and development in energy production, conversion, and conservation should eventually allow local energy sources, of which the most promising is biomass energy, to be substituted for imported fuels. But diverting scarce land and water to plantations of fast-growing trees or other kinds of biomass may seriously limit food production in these crowded countries."
https://openalex.org/W2127798170,"Most studies of energy supply and demand ignore either global inter-dependence or the long time spans necessary to adjust to new energy sources. The International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis has therefore studied on a global scale, for seven major world regions, the balance between energy supply and demand for the next 50 years. Reported here are the results for two benchmark scenarios. In the ""low"" scenario world energy consumption increases from today's 8.2 terawatt-year per year to 22 terawatt-year per year in 2030; in the ""high"" scenario, consumption increases to 35 terawatt-year per year. The study showed that time will be the limiting constraint in adapting the energy supply infrastructure to changing resource availability; resources will be available until the second half of the next century, but a strong shift will be required to low-grade fossil fuels such as shale oil and tar sands. Each scenario studied indicated increased environmental problems associated with increased use of fossil fuels, and potential geopolitical problems associated with the world distribution of resources."
https://openalex.org/W2084648525,"Rocks of the rim and upper walls of Scripps Submarine Canyon are intensely burrowed by marine invertebrates. Important excavators are bivalves, polychaetes, and sipunculoids whose activities culminate in a network of passageways and eventual disintegration of the rocks. In many localities erosion by animals is more important than erosion by physical and chemical processes."
https://openalex.org/W2112650862,"For the next 20 years there is likely to be a slowing of population growth rates for all areas of the world except Africa. The present population of developed countries is expected to increase by about 12 percent by the year 2000; that of all developing countries is expected to increase by about 50 percent. The momentum of population growth is strong; a few analysts suggest that growth may cease at 8 billion, but a figure of more than 10 billion seems much more likely."
https://openalex.org/W4238957667,"In contrast to the approaches to resource management and preservation of the past decade, a new perspective on environmental problems is emerging. Six major trends in scientific thinking are (i) increased efforts to examine environments in holistic frameworks, (ii) greater attention to life support systems, (iii) enlarged canvass of the range of choices in resource management, (iv) refinement in methods of risk assessment, (v) streamlined methods for monitoring environmental change, and (vi) more emphasis on the global framework."
https://openalex.org/W3208997995,"Up to the present time six classes of radio stars have been established. The signals are almost always very faint and drastically variable. Hence their discovery has owed as much to serendipity as to the highly sophisticated equipment and techniques that have been used. When the variations are regular, as with the pulsars, this characteristic can be exploited very successfully in the search for new objects as well as in the detailed study of those that are already known. The detection of the most erratically variable radio stars, the flare stars and the x-ray stars, is primarily a matter of luck and patience. In the case of the novas, one at least knows where and oughly when to look for radio emission. A very sensitive interferometer is clearly the best instrument to use in the initial detection of a radio star. The fact that weak background sources are frequently present makes it essential to prove that the position of a radio source agrees with that of a star to within a few arc seconds. The potential of radio astronomy for the study of radio stars will not be realized until more powerful instruments than those that are available today can be utilized. So far, we have been able to see only the most luminous of the radio stars."
