https://openalex.org/W1483640295,"Procedures are described for the isolation of two forms of rabbit liver microsomal liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 (P-450LM) in homogeneous state. They are designated by their relative electrophoretic mobilities on polyacrylamide gel in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate as P-450LM2 and P-450LM4. P-450LM2, which was isolated from phenobarbital-induced animals, has a subunit molecular weight of 48,700. The best preparations contain 20 nmol of the cytochrome per mg of protein and 1 molecule of heme per polypeptide chain. P-450LM4, which is induced by beta-naphthoflavone but is also present in phenobarbital-induced and untreated animals, was isolated from all three sources and found to have a subunit molecular weight of 55,300. The best preparations contain 17nmol of the cytochrome per mg of protein and 1 molecule of heme per polypeptide chain. Some of the purified preparations of the cytochromes, although electrophoretically homogeneous, contain apoenzyme due to heme loss during purification. The purified proteins contain no detectable NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase, cytochrome b5, or NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase, and only low levels of phospholipid (about 1 molecule per subunit). Amino acid analysis indicated that P-450LM2 and P-450LM4 are similar in composition, but the latter protein has about 60 additional residues. The COOH-terminal amino acid of P-450LM2 is arginine, as shown by carboxypeptidase treatment, whereas that of P-450LM4 is lysine. NH2-terminal amino acid residues could not be detected. Carbohydrate analysis indicated that both cytochromes contain 1 residue of glucosamine and 2 of mannose per polypeptide subunit. The optical spectra of the oxidized and reduced cytochromes and carbon monoxide complexes were determined. Oxidized P-450LM2 has maxima at 568, 535, and 418 nm characteristic of a low spin hemeprotein, and P450LM4 from beta-naphthoflavone-induced, phenobarbital-induced, or control microsomes has maxima at 645 and 394 nm, characteristic of the high spin state. The spectrum of -450lm4 becomes similar to that of P-450LM2 at high protein concentrations or upon the addition of detergent (Renex), whereas the spectrum of P-450LM2 is unaffected by the protein concentration or the presence of detergent. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometry of the purified cytochromes indicated that oxidized -450lm2 is in the low spin state, whereas P-450LM4 is largely, but not entirely, in the high spin state."
https://openalex.org/W2005583856,"The neural changes accompanying sensitization of the gill-withdrawal reflex in Aplysia are associated with presynaptic facilitation at monosynaptic connections between sensory neurons and motor cells. To analyze the molecular mechanisms underlying the facilitation, the pharmacological actions of serotonin, octopamine, and dopamine were examined. Only serotonin enhanced synaptic transmission between the sensory and the motor neurons. A serotonin antagonist, cinanserin, reversibly blocked the synaptic facilitation. The action of serotonin may be mediated by adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Exposing the ganglion to dibutyryl cyclic AMP or injecting cyclic AMP into the cell body enhances the synaptic action of a sensory neuron. The mechanism of presynaptic facilitation, therefore, may include activation of one or more serotonergic neurons, which enhance the release of a neurotransmitter by increasing the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP in the terminals of the sensory neurons."

https://openalex.org/W1589072283,"High affinity binding sites for angiotensin II in bovine and rat brain membranes have been identified and characterized using monoiodinated Ile5-angiotensin II of high specific radioactivity. Degradation of labeled and unlabeled peptide by washed brain particulate fractions was prevented by adding glucagon to the final incubation medium and including a proteolytic enzyme inhibitor (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) in preincubation and incubation procedures. 125I-Angiotensin II binding can be studied using either centrifugation or filtration techniques to separate tissue-bound radioactivity. 125I-Angiotensin II binding to calf brain membranes is saturable and reversible, with a dissociation binding constant of 0.2 nM at 37 degrees. A similar binding constant is found in rat brain membranes. Analogues and fragments of angiotensin II compete for these brain binding sites with potencies which correlate with both their in vivo potencies and their binding inhibition protencies at adrenal cortex angiotensin II receptors. Angiotensin I is 1 to 2 orders of magnitude weaker than angiotensin II; the 3-8 hexapeptide and 4-8 pentapeptide are much weaker still. (desAsp1) angiotensin II (angiotensin III) is slightly more potent than angiotensin II, as are several antagonists of angiotensin II with aliphatic amino acids substituted at position 8. In calf brain 125I-angiotensin II binding is restricted almost exclusively to the cerebellum (cortex and deep nuclei). In rat brain, angiotensin II binding is highest in the thalamus-hypothalamus, midbrain, and brainstem, areas which are believed to be involved in mediating angiotensin II-induced central effects. These findings illustrate the presence of high affinity specific binding sites for angiotensin II in rat and bovine brain and suggest a physiological role for angiotensin peptides in the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1592735689,"The beta-adrenergic catecholamine isoproterenol produces a large, rapid, but often a transient, elevation in cellular content of cyclic AMP. We have used the S49 mouse lymphoma cell line, in which genetic variants with specific defects in the pathway of cyclic AMP generation and function have been isolated, to study the increase and subsequent decrease in cyclic AMP levels (termed refractoriness) following incubation of cells with isoproterenol. In wild type S49 cells, isoproterenol produces a peak response in the cellular content of cyclic AMP within 30 min, but the cyclic AMP level falls rapidly thereafter, approaching basal levels by 6 h. Neither inactivation of the drug nor secretion of a nonspecific inhibitor of adenylate cyclase appears to account for the refractoriness. Because isoproterenol refractory cells can still be stimulated by cholera toxin, refractoriness to isoproterenol does not represent a generalized decrease in cellular cyclic AMP response. Particulate preparations from refractory cells have a selective loss of isoproterenol-responsive adenylate cyclase activity, but their activation constants and stereoselectivity for (-)- and (+)-isoproterenol are unaltered. In addition, refractory cells have decreased specific binding of the beta-adrenergic antagonist [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol. This decrease appears to represent a reduction in the number, but not the affinity, of beta-adrenergic receptor sites. Similar studies in an S49 clone that lacks the enzyme cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase yield essentially identical findings. Because kinase-deficient cells do not induce the cyclic AMP-degrading enzyme phosphodiesterase after the cellular content of cyclic AMP is increased, induced of phosphodiesterase cannot account for refractoriness to isoproterenol. Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase does not appear to be required for either the decrease in beta-adrenergic receptors and isoproterenol-responsive adenylate cyclase, nor does it appear to be required for the development of refractoriness to isoproterenol. In contrast, an S49 clone lacking hormone-responsive adenylate cyclase activity but retaining beta-adrenergic receptors does not appear to lose receptors after being incubated with isoproterenol, either alone or together with dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Therefore, in this clone, receptor occupancy alone or in combination with elevated cyclic AMP levels is insufficient to cause refractoriness. Refractoriness thus appears to require intact adenylate cyclase. This suggests that adenylate cyclase may exert regulatory controls on beta-adrenergic receptors in addition to generation of cyclic AMP."
https://openalex.org/W2160014551,"Gonadotropin receptor sites and adenylate cyclase activity were analyzed in luteinized rat ovaries following injection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Gonadotropin binding capacity and hormonal stimulation of adenylate cyclase declined rapidly to a minimum at 6 to 12 h, remained depressed for 4 days, and returned to the control level between 5 and 7 days. Total adenylate cyclase activity measured in the presence of fluoride fell by 50% within a few hours but returned to normal by 24 h. A close correlation was observed between the number of gonadotropin receptors and the ability of adenylate cyclase to be stimulated by hormone. Assay of tissue-bound hormone showed that the initial loss of hormone sensitivity and binding capacity was associated with occupancy of luteinizing hormone receptor sites, but that the prolonged changes in these activities were not attributable to receptor occupancy. These studies have demonstrated that induction of a refractory or desensitized state in ovarian adenylate cyclase by gonadotropin results from the loss of specific hormone receptor sites."

https://openalex.org/W1533935767,"The adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase purified from bovine cardiac muscle catalyzes the transfer of up to 2 mol of 32P from [lambda-32P]ATP to seryl residues in its cyclic nucleotide-binding protein component (Erlichman, J., Rosenfeld, R., and Rosen, O. M. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 5000-5003). We now present three lines of evidence to support our conclusions that the undissociated holoenzyme does not catalyze the phosphorylation of exogenous substrates but can undergo self-phosphorylation by an intramolecular reaction: (a) addition of either cAMP-binding protein or the protein kinase inhibitor (Walsh, D. A., Ashby C. D., Gonzales, C., Calkins, D., Fischer, E. H., and Krebs, D. G. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 241, 1977-1985) does not inhibit self-phosphorylation as it does phosphorylation of exogenous substrates in the presence or absence of cAMP; (b) addition of catalytic subunit to an excess of cyclic nucleotide-binding protein results in phosphorylation equivalent to the amount of holoenzyme so generated; (c) the rate of self-phosphorylation is not affected by dilution of the holoenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1565005789,"Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectra have been recorded for beef heart cytochrome oxidase and a number of its inhibitor complexes. The resting enzyme exhibits a derivate shape Faraday C term in the Soret region, characteristic of low spin ferric heme, which accounts for 50% of the total oxidase heme a. The remaining heme a (50%) is assigned to the high spin state. MCD temperature studies, comparison with the MCD spectra of heme a-imidazole model compounds, and ligand binding (cyanide, formate) studies are consistent with these spin state assignments in the oxidized enzyme. Furthermore, the ligand binding properties and correlations between optical and MCD parameters indicate that in the resting enzyme the low spin heme a is due solely to cytochrome a3+ and the high spin heme a to cytochrome a33+. The Soret MCD of the reduced protein is interpreted as th sum of two MCD curves: an intense, asymmetric MCD band very similar to that exhibited by deoxymyoglobin which we assign to paramagnetic high spin cytochrome a3(2+) and a weaker, more symmetric MCD contribution, which is attributed to diamagnetic low spin cytochrome a2+. Temperature studies of the Soret MCD intensity support this proposed spin state heterogeneity. Ligand binding (CO, CN-) to the reduced protein eliminates the intense MCD associated with high spin cytochrome a3(2+); however, the band associated with cytochrome a2+ is observed under these conditions as well as in a number of inhibitor complexes (cyanide, formate, sulfide, azide) of the partially reduced protein. The MCD spectra of oxidized, reduced, and inhibitor-complexed cytochrome oxidase show no evidence for heme-heme interaction via spectral parameters. This conclusion is used in conjunction with the fact that ferric, high spin heme exhibits weak MCD intensity to calculate the MCD spectra for the individual cytochromes of the oxidase as well as the spectra for some inhibitor complexes of cytochrome a3. The results are most simply interpreted using the model we have recently proposed to account for the electronic and magnetic properties of cytochrome (Palmer, G., Babcock, F.T., and Vcikery, L.E. (1976) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 73, 2206-2210)."
https://openalex.org/W2027530345,"Slow decreases of ionic conductance across neuronal cell membranes, which generate slow synaptic potentials, can increase the effectiveness of synaptic transmission. Slow conductance decreases sufficient magnitude increase the amplitude of monosynaptic fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials in B cells of the bullfrog sympathetic ganglion. By this postsynaptic mechanism, activation of one synaptic pathway can cause an increase in transmission, lasting several minutes, across another synapse. This may provide an important mechanism for synaptic integration and control of neuronal interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1541460729,"The hormonal control of [14C]glucose synthesis from [U-14C-A1dihydroxyacetone was studied in hepatocytes from fed and starved rats. In cells from fed rats, glucagon lowered the concentration of substrate giving half-half-maximal rates of incorporation while it had little or no effect on the maximal rate. Inhibitors of gluconeogenesis from pyruvate had no effect on the ability of the hormone to stimulate the synthesis of [14C]glucose from dihydroxyacetone. The concentrations of glucagon and epinephrine giving half-maximal stimulation from dihydroxacetone were 0.3 to 0.4 mM and 0.3 to 0.5 muM, respectively. The meaximal catecholamine stimulation was much less than the maximal stimulation by glucagon and was mediated largely by the alpha receptor. Insulin had no effect on the basal rate of [14C]clucose synthesis but inhibited the effect of submaximal concentration of glucagon or of any concentration of catecholamine. Glucagon had no effect on the uptake of dihydroxyacetone but suppressed its conversion to lactate and pyruvate. This suppression accounted for most of the increase in glucose synthesis. In cells from gasted rats, where lactate production is greatly reduced and the rate of glucose synthesis is elevated, glucagon did not stimulate gluconeogenesis from dihydroxyacetone. Findings with glycerol as substrate were similar to those with dihyroxyacetone. Ethanol also stimulated glucose production from dihydroxyacetone while reducing proportionately the production of lactate. Ethanol is known to generate reducing equivalents fro clyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and presumably thereby inhibits carbon flux to lactate at this site. Its effect was additive with that of glucagon. Estimates of the steady state levels of intermediary metabolites and flux rates suggested that glucagon activated conversion of fructose diphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate and suppressed conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate. More direct evidence for an inhibition of pyruvate kinase was the observation that brief exposure of cells to glucagon caused up to 70% inhibition of the enzyme activity in homogenates of these cells. The inhibition was not seen when the enzyme was assayed with 20 muM fructose diphosphate. The effect of glucagon to lower fructose diphosphate levels in intact cells may promote the inhibition of pyruvate kinase. The inhibition of pyruvate kinase may reduce recycling in the pathway of gluconeogenesis from major physiological substrates and probably accounts fromsome but not all the stimulatory effect of glucagon."
https://openalex.org/W1605420831,"Endogenous protein kinase activity was detected in the outer plasma membrane of 373 and SV40 transformed 3T3 cells. When intact cells were incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP, there was a transfer of [32P]phosphate into an acid-insoluble product. The reaction was: (a) linear as a function of time (up to 30 min), (b) proportional to the number of cells present and (c) dependent on temperature and Mg2+ concentration. The acid-insoluble product was susceptible to pronase but not RNase or DNase. More specifically, phosphomonoester bonds to serine and threonine were identified. There was less than 3% hydrolysis of the [gamma-32P]ATP during the reaction; moreover, free [32P]phosphate failed to substitute for the ATP. The reaction product was located on the cell surface, as evidenced by the fact that it could be removed by mild trypsin treatment of intact 3T3 cells. Further evidence for the surface location of the kinase was shown by its activity in phosphorlating exogenous substrate, histone, and phosvitin. The level of phosphorylation increased by 2- to 4-fold prior to the start of S phase when quiescent 3T3 cells were stimulated to reinitiate growth by the addition of serum. The SV40 3T3 cells had from 5- to 10-fold more activity per cell than the quiescent 3T3 cells. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and radioautography show at least 25 phosphorylated proteins; the surface label pattern of 3T3 cells differs from that of SV40-transformed 3T3 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1600743624,"The Ca2+ binding component (TnC) of troponin has been selectively labeled with either a spin label, N-(1-oxyl-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidinyl) iodoacetamide, or with a fluorescent probe, S-mercuric-N-dansyl cysteine, presumably at its single cysteine residue (Cys-98) in order to probe the interactions of TnC with divalent metals and with other subunits of troponin. The modified protein has the same Ca2+ binding properties as native TnC (Potter, J. D., and Gergely, J. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 4628), viz. two Ca2+ binding sites at which Mg2+ appears to compete (Ca2+-Mg2+ sites, KCa = 2 X 10(7) M-1) and two sites at which Mg2+ does not compete (Ca2+-specific sites, KCa = 2 X 10(5) M-1). Either Ca2+ or Mg2+ alters the ESR spectrum of spin-labeled TnC in a manner that indicates a decrease in the mobility of the label, Ca2+ having a slightly greater effect. In systems containing both Ca2+ and Mg2+ the mobility of the spin label is identical with that in systems containing Ca2+ alone. The binding constants for Ca2+ and Mg2+ deduced from ESR spectral changes are 10(7) and 10(3) M-1, respectively, and the apparent affinity for Ca2+ decreases by about an order of magnitude on adding 2 mM Mg2+. Thus, the ESR spectral change is associated with binding of Ca2+ to one or both of the Ca2+-Mg2+ sites. Addition of Ca2+ to the binary complexes of spin-labeled TnC with either troponin T (TnT) or troponin I (TnI) produces greater reduction in the mobility of the spin label than in the case of spin-labeled TnC alone, and in the case of the complex with TnI the affinity for Ca2+ is increased by an order of magnitude. The fluorescence of dansyl (5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)-labeled TnC is enhanced by Ca2+ binding to both high and low affinity sites with apparent binding constants of 2.6 X 10(7) M-1 and 2.9 X 10(5) M-1, respectively, calculated from the transition midpoints. The presence of 2 mM Mg2+, which produces no effect on dansyl fluorescence itself, in contrast to its effect on the spin label, shifts the high affinity constant to 2 X 10(6) M-1. Spectral changes produced by Ca2+ binding to the TnC-TnI complex furnish evidence that the affinity of TnC for Ca2+ is increased in the complex. The reactivity of Cys-98 to the labels and to 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Nbs2) is decreased by Ca2+ or Mg2+ both with native TnC and in 6 M urea. The reaction rate between Cys-98 and Nbs2 decreases to one-half the maximal value at a Ca2+ concentration that suggests binding to the Ca2+-Mg2+ sites. Formation of a binary complex between TnI and TnC reduces the rate of reaction, and there is a further reduction by Ca2+. The effect of Ca2+ takes place at concentrations that are 1 order of magnitude lower than in the case of TnC alone. These results suggest that the Ca2+ binding site adjacent to Cys-98 is one of the Ca2+-Mg2+ binding sites."

https://openalex.org/W1604887498,"Thyroid hormone-responsive tissues contain chromatin proteins that are concentrated in chromatin subfractions enriched in DNA. These receptors appear to be DNA-binding proteins. In the present study, we utilized a DNA-cellulose binding assay to further examine the interactions of solubilized receptors with DNA. [125I]Triiodothyronine associates with receptors bound to DNA-cellulose, whereas free [I]triiodothyronine and [125I]triiodothyronine associated with other proteins does not. The DNA-receptor interactions appear to be strong enough to exist at physiological ionic strength since binding is 50% maximal ag 0.175 M NaCl and is only partly inhibited by Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the 1 to 5 mM range. Most, if not all, of the receptors are capable of DNA binding, and there are at least 80,000 receptor binding sites/diploid DNA (assuming one triiodothyronine binding site/receptor). Binding of the receptor-[125I]triiodothyronine complexes to other DNAs and analogs was examined using a competition assay. There is similar binding by native and denatured DNA, gy eukaryotic DNA from different species and by prokaryotic DNA (Bacillus subtilis). Binding by natural DNAs is more avid than by cytoplasmic RNA, nuclear RNA, poly(dA-dT)-poly(dA-dT), or poly(dG-dC)-poly(dG-dC). Under these conditions, binding by tRNA and poly(dA) is insignificant, and the nucleotide monomers ATP and GTP have no detectable binding. These studies support the idea that the thyroid hormone receptor is a DNA-binding protein and that the interaction is a major determinant for receptor localization in chromatin. The competition studies suggest that the polynucleotide composition and/or conformation can have marked influences on the binding, and that multiple orders of binding affinity can exist. The presence of specific sequences cannot be excluded. However, the finding that receptors bind extensively and tightly to DNA suggests that receptors in chromatin may randomly bind to any available DNA, resulting in some of the receptors being at physiologically unimportant sites. If so, the several thousand hormone receptors present in each target cell may be required to enhance the possibility that some of the receptors are present at the actual sites of action."

https://openalex.org/W1590299690,"A derivative of the flavoprotein pig heart lipoamide dehydrogenase has been described recently (Thorpe, C., and Williams, C.H. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 3553-3557), in which 1 of the 2 cysteine residues generated on reduction of the intrachain active center disulfide bridge is selectively alkylated with iodoacetamide. This monolabeled enzyme exhibits a spectrum of oxidized bound flavin. The addition of 1 mM NAD+ to this derivative at pH 8.3 causes a decrease in absorbance of approximately 50% at 448 nm, with a concomitant increase at 380 nm. These spectral changes are complete within 3 ms and are reversible. NAD+ titrations generate isosbestic points at 408, 374, and 327 nm; allowing values for the apparent dissociation constant for NAD+ and the extent of bleaching at infinite ligand to be obtained from double reciprocal plots. Between pH 6.1 and 8.8, the apparent KD decreases from 320 to 35 muM, whereas the extrapolated delta epsilon 448 values remain approximately constant at 1/2 epsilon 448. Direct measurement of NAD+ binding by gel filtration at pH 8.8 indicates that the spectral changes are associated with a stoichiometry of 1.2 mol of NAD+ bound/2 mol of FAD. The modified protein is a dimer containing 1 FAD and 1 alkylated cysteine residue/subunit; the native enzyme is also dimeric. The visible spectrum of the species absorbing at 380 nm, approximated by correction for the residual oxidized FAD, shows a single maximum at 384 nm, epsilon 384 = 8.7 mM-1cm-1. Comparison of this spectrum with that of model compounds of known structure suggests that it may represent a reversible covalent flavin adduct induced on binding NAD+."

https://openalex.org/W1517684414,"The transfer of pyrene between high density lipoproteins was studied as a model of lipid exchange. When high density lipoprotein containing pyrene was mixed with unlabeled lipoprotein, pyrene excimer fluorescence decreased with a half-time of approximately 3 ms. The rate of pyrene transfer was invariant over a 100-fold range of unlabeled lipoprotein concentrations. Since a decrease in excimer fluorescence indicates a decrease in the microscopic concentrations of pyrene, the observed fluorescence change relfects pyrene transfer to unlabeled lipoproteins, and, therefore, dilution of the pyrene molecules. When high density lipoprotein labeled with pyrene was rapidly diluted 1:14 into buffer, a small decrease in excimer fluorescence was observed. The half-time of this fluorescence change was also about 3 ms and represents the half-time for the dissociation of pyrene from high density lipoprotein into water. The latter observation, coupled with the invariant exchange rate with lipoprotein concentration suggests strongly that the limiting step in the transfer of pyrene between high density lipoproteins is the dissociation of pyrene into solvent. Finally, regardless of mechanism, the exchange of pyrene, and presumably other hydrophobic aromatic compounds, among serum high density lipoproteins is extremely fast. This result indicates that these types of compounds can be rapidly assimilated and transported through the body by plasma lipoproteins."

From the difference spectrum against the oxidized oxidase, Compound I is characterized by a maximum at 605 nm, Compound II at 578 nm, and Compound III by double peaks at around 600 and 580 nm. In the Soret region, Compound I shows a peak at 435 nm and a trough at 412 nm, Compound III exhibits a peak at 442 to 443 nm and a trough at 418 nm. In the absence of cytochrome c, the spontaneous decay of Compound I precedes that of Compound II; the first order rate constants have been found to be 4 X 10(-3) s(-1) and 8 X 10(-4) s(-1) for Compounds I and II, respectively. Compound III, however, does not revert back to the oxidized form even after several hours. The decay of Compound I is accelerated in the presence of ferrocytochrome c by a factor of 10(3) to 10(4) depending on the concentration of the latter. The time for sequential differentiation between Compound I and Compound II becomes less clear in the presence than in the absence of ferrocytochrome c. On the contrary ferricytochrome c does not show such an accelerating effect.

https://openalex.org/W1607019546,"Contact of rat platelets with thrombin or the divalent cation ionophore A-23187, in the presence of extracellular calcium, resulted in the secretion of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) phosphodiesterases. Significant association of calcium with platelets occurred during platelet surface contact with thrombin. Thrombin concentration to induce association of calcium virtually agreed with that to release the enzyme. The finding that A-23187 (5 to 20 muM) also provoked a rapid and marked association of extracellular calcium with platelets suggests that calcium mobilization into the intracellular environment may account, at least in part, for this association between platelet and calcium. Two different phosphodiesterases, a relatively specific cyclic AMP and a relatively specific cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase were secreted from platelets into the plasma in soluble form. The amounts of the phosphodiesterases secreted were dose- or time-dependent on thrombin (0.1 to 2 units) or A-23187 (5 to 20 muM) within 30 min. The enzyme release by thrombin was completely inhibited by heparin but the release by A-23187 was not. The two phosphodiesterases secreted seemed to correspond to the two enzymes isolated from platelet homogenates in many respects. Rat platelets contained, at least, three cyclic 3':5'-nucleotide phosphodiesterases, namely, two relatively specific cyclic AMP phoshodiesterases and a relatively specific cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase which were clearly separated from each other by Sepharose 6B or DEAE-cellulose column chromatography or sucrose gradient centrifugation. The two platelet cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase (Mr = 180,000 and 280,000) had similar apparent Km values of 0.69 and 0.75 muM with different sedimentation coefficient values of 4.9 S and 7.1 S, respectively. They did not hydrolyze cyclic GMP significantly. A cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase (Mr - 260,000) exhibited abnormal kinetics for cyclic GMP with an apparent Km value of 1.5 muM and normal kinetics for cyclic AMP with a Km of 300 muM. The properties of a platelet cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase (Mr = 180,000) and a platelet cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase were found to agree with those of the two phosphodiesterases released from platelets by thrombin or A-23187. Depletion of extracellular calcium by an addition of citrate, EDTA, or ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) to the blood or platelet suspension resulted in a loss of the activity of the smaller form of platelet cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase (Mr = 180,000) and addition of calcium restored the activity of this cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase. Thus, calcium seemed to be involved in the mechanism of an occurrence of this smaller form of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase as well as the secretion of this enzyme. Contact of human platelets with thrombin also resulted in the secretion of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase which was dependent on the concentration of calcium. No species difference was observed in this respect."
https://openalex.org/W1591023429,"The role of phospholipids in the binding of 125I-choriogonadotropin to bovine corpus luteum plasma membranes has been investigated with the use of purified phospholipase A and phospholipase C to alter membrane phospholipids. The phospholipase C-digested plasma membrane preparation showed 85 to 90% inhibition of 125I-choriogonadotropin binding activity when 70% of the membrane phospholipid was hydrolyzed. Similarly treatment of plasma membranes with phospholipase A resulted in 45 to 55% hydrolysis of membrane phospholipid and almost 75% inhibition of receptor activity. Both these enzymes hydrolyzed membrane-associated phosphatidylcholine to a greater extent than phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine. Phosphorylaminoalcohols of phospholiphase C end products were completely released into the medium, while phospholipase A by-products remained associated with plasma membranes. Addition of a phospholipids suspension or liposomes to plasma membranes pretreated with phospholipase A and C did not restore gonadotropin binding activity. Soluble phosphorylcholine, phosphorylethanolamine, and phosphorylserine and insoluble diglyceride products of phospholipase C action had no effect on receptor activity. In contrast, end products of the phospholipase A action, such as lysophosphatides and fatty acids, inhibited both on the membrane-associated and solubilized receptor activity. Lysophosphatidylcholine was the most effective end product inhibiting the binding of gonadotropin to the receptor, followed by lysophosphatidylethanolamine and lysophosphatidylserine. The inhibitory effects of phospholipase A or lysophosphatides were completely reversed upon removal of membrane-bound phospholipid end products by washing the membranes with defatted bovine serum albumin. However, phospholipase C inhibition could not be overcome by defatted albumin washings. Solubilization of plasma membranes with detergents which had been pretreated with phospholipase C partially restored the inhibited activity. It is concluded that the phospholipase-mediated inhibition of gonadotropin binding activity was due to hydrolysis and alterations of the phospholipid environment in the case of phospholipase C and by direct inhibition by end products in the case of phospholipase A."

https://openalex.org/W2051378632,A highly sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay has been developed for the major structural protein of an oncornavirus etiologically associated with bovine lymphosarcoma. This test can be used to identify cattle which have been exposed to the bovine leukemia virus and may thus develop or transmit the disease. Analysis of randomly obtained serums indicates that infection with this virus is widespread among cattle.

Furthermore, increases in plasma renin activities that occur in rats with intact kidneys during experimental hypotension appear to be too low to provide the basis for the observed elevations in water intake. These findings question the contribution of the renin-angiotensin system to thirst under normal physiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2093815677,"When rat cardiac and skeletal muscle are explored by immunocytochemical procedures designed to show sites of localization of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP), distinct staining patterns for the two nucleotides are seen. Antibody to cyclic AMP is found in the area of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, while antibody to cyclic GMP is found with a periodic distribution corresponding to that of the A band. This suggests a role for cyclic GMP in the regulation of myosin."
https://openalex.org/W1491930938,"The ability of bovine corpus luteum plasma membranes to bind 125I-choriogonadotropin has been examined after prior treatment of the membranes with phospholipases A, C, and D. Treatment of the purified membranes with low concentrations of phospholipases A and C resulted in the inhibition of the binding of 125I-choriogonadotropin to its receptors, whereas phospholipase D had no effect. Receptor activity was decreased by low concentrations of phospholipase A from either bee venom, Vipera russelli or Crotalus terrificus terrificus. Similarly, low concentrations of phospholipase C from Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium welchii also inhibited the binding activity while comparatively higher concentrations of phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus were required to achieve comparable inhibition. The time required to produce 50% inhibition of in vitro binding by phospholipases A and C was found to be 6 and 23 min, respectively. Upon either removal or chelation of calcium ions by ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) both enzymes were completely inhibited as evidenced by the complete retention of the membrane binding activity. The decrease in the specific binding of choriogonadotropin to membranes after phospholipase digestion resulted in a decrease in the number of binding sites and was not accompanied by a change in the affinity of the hormone-receptor complex. The rates of association and dissociation of the 125I-choriogonadotropin-receptor complex and the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) were nearly identical in untreated and phospholipase-treated membranes. Phospholipases did not have any effect on the preformed hormone-receptor complex or on solubilized receptor. Filtration through Sepharose 6B of solubilized 125I-choriogonadotropin-receptor complex from untreated membranes or membranes which had been pretreated with phospholipase C prior to carrying out hormone binding did not alter the profile (Kav 0.38). Gel filtration of membranes treated with phospholipase A showed two peaks of bound radioactivity with distribution coefficients (Kav) of 0.08 and 0.35, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1492661185,"Evidence is presented based on requirements for exchange in the partial reactions, initial velocity and exchange kinetics and product inhibition, that the pyruvate, phosphate dikinase reaction of propionibacteria occurs by a nonclassical Tri Uni Uni Ping Pong mechanism. The mechanism involves a pyrophosphoryl enzyme, a phosphoryl enzyme, and the free enzyme, and three functionally distinct and independent substrate sites. On the first site, there is pyrophosphorylation of the enzyme by ATP with subsequent release of AMP. The pyrophosphoryl moiety then reacts at the second site with Pi yielding the product PPi and the phosphoryl from of the enzyme. At the third site pyruvate is phosphorylated yielding P-enolpyruvate and the free enzyme. The three catalytic sites are proposed to be linked by a histidyl residue which functions as a pyrophosphoyrl- and phosphoryl-carrier between the three sites. This proposal is based on the following observations. (A) The patterns of the double reciprocal plots of the initial velocities were all parallel; (b) product inhibition between each pair of substrates and products of the three partial reactions were competitive, i.e. ATP against AMP, Pi against PPi, and pyruvate against P-enolpyruvate; (c) the other product inhibitions, with one exception, were noncompetitive as required by the nonclassical ping-pong mechanism; (d) ATP or P-enolpyruvate was required for the Pi in equilibrium PPi exchange reaction which is in accord with the participation of a pyrosphosphoryl or phosphoryl form of the enzyme in this exchange; (e) the ATP in equilibrium AMP exchange and pyruvate in equilibrium P-enolpyruvate exchange did not require additional substrates. In addition, the inhibition and participation in the exchange reactions of the alpha,beta and beta,gamma-methylene analogues of ATP and of the methylene analogue of inorganic pyrophosphate were investigated and the results were in accord with the proposed mechanism. The combined evidence provides a well documented example of a three site nonclassical Tri Uni Uni Ping Pong mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2049179348,"The eclosion hormone triggers a stereotyped preprogrammed pattern of behavior in silk moths. The effects of the hormone were duplicated by the injection of dibutyryl adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate, adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cyclic AMP), or guanosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) into theophylline-treated pharate moths. Treatment with theophylline reduced the latency of the response to a low dose of hormone, presumably by blocking phosphodiesterase. Endogenous levels of cyclic AMP, but not cyclic GMP, increased significantly in the central nervous system within 10 minutes after hormone injection. We conclude that an early step leading to the release of the eclosion motor program is an increase in cyclic AMP in target neurons of the central nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W1971359871,"High-field (63.4 kilogauss) Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 13C in natural abundance has been used to study the structural organization and molecular dynamics of constituent lipids of normal human very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL). The same method was used to study the abnormal beta-VLDL of two type III hyperlipoproteinemia patients having markedly differing ratios of VLDL cholesterol to triglyceride (0.3 and 0.6, respectively). Resolution obtained at 63.4 kilogauss has made possible the assignment of several additional resonances of cholesterol ring carbon atoms, not resolved in earlier studies at lower fields, in the VLDL spectra. The rotational reorientation of the ring portion of cholesteryl esters in VLDL (normal) and beta-VLDL (abnormal) is not highly anisotropic and is similar to that for cholesteryl esters disolved in excess triolein. The rotations of cholesteryl esters in LDL are more highly anisotropic and significantly more restricted. The results suggest that the structural organization of the lipid components in beta-VLDL resembles that found in normal VLDL but differs significantly from that for normal LDL."
https://openalex.org/W1553458618,"Adenylate cyclase activities in membranes prepared from Rous sarcoma-transformed chicken embryo fibroblasts are 2 to 4 times lower than in membranes prepared from normal chicken embryo fibroblasts. Adenylate cyclase activities were solubilized from normal and transformed membranes with five different nonionic detergents. In all cases, the specific activities of the enzyme solubilized from normal and transformed preparations were essentially identical. These data suggest that the microenvironment of adenylate cyclase in transformed membranes may be wholly or partially responsible for the decreased activities of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1506577885,"An endonuclease activity has been purified approximately 800-fold from nuclei of 3T3 cells infected with polyoma virus. The purfied enzyme catalyzes an endonucleoytic cleavage of single- and double-stranded DNA and single-stranded RNA. Evidence that the activity towards these substrates resides in the same protein molecule is provided by the finding that they co-sediment in sucrose gradients and have identical rates of heat inactivation. Studies on the DNase activity shows that the rate of hydrolysis of single-stranded T7 DNA is 100-fold greater than that for double-stranded T7 DNA. Single-stranded DNA is extensively hydrolyzed to low molecular weight acid-insoluble products. With duplex DNA as substrate, only a limited number of single strand breaks are introduced. A limit digest with polyoma DNA (component I) as substrate results in the introduction of four breaks per strand. The phosphdiester bond interruptions can be repaired by polynucleotide ligase. Approximately 80% of the 5' termini present at the point of phosphodiester bond cleavage are purine nucleotides. Additional studies have demonstrated that a similar endonuclease is present in nuclei of uninfected cells and that this enzyme purified 400-fold has catalytic properties identical with those of the endonuclease from infected cells."
https://openalex.org/W1521714865,"The interaction of various spin-labeled compounds with the murine thymocyte adenylate cyclase-cyclic AMP system was investigated. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra from spin-labeled compounds were used to calculate the order parameter, S, and indicated that the thymocyte plasma membrane is a relatively rigid structure. Increasing concentrations of spin-labeled stearates, but not their corresponding methyl esters, resulted in increased membrane fluidity, partial lysis, and concomitant complete inhibition of cholera toxin-mediated increases in cyclic AMP content. Upon subsequent isolation of plasma membranes from these cells, cholera toxin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was also completely inhibited. Direct addition of spin-labeled stearates, but not spin-labeled methyl stearates, to thymocyte homogenates caused a dramatic reduction of basal, cholera toxin-, isoproterenol-, NaF-, and prostaglandin E1-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. Inhibition was complete within the first minute of addition to homogenates and required approximately 0.2 mM spin-labeled stearate I(12,3) for half-maximal inhibition. This inhibition occurred in the presence or absence of an ATP-regenerating system and was not readily reversible. Furthermore, since the membrane cyclic phosphodiesterase activity was not altered by spin-labeled stearates, their inhibition was attributed to a direct action of stearate spin labels on adenylate cyclase. Neither stearate, methyl stearate, spin-labeled methyl stearates nor 2,2,6,6,-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (Tempo) altered cell viability or enzyme activities at the concentrations studied. Spin-labeled stearates seemed to intercalate into different areas of the plasma membrane than their corresponding methyl esters. Furthermore, the action of spin-labeled stearates appeared to be on the exterior of the plasma membrane rather than the interior. These results illustrate the presence of multilipid domains and the importance of selected lipids and lipid-protein interactions in the adenylate cyclase-cyclic AMP system. Thymocyte adenylate cyclase is described in terms of a current model for membrane proteins."
