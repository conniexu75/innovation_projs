https://openalex.org/W2073607297,"Glutamate released by activated microglia induces excitoneurotoxicity and may contribute to neuronal damage in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis. In addition, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) secreted from activated microglia may elicit neurodegeneration through caspase-dependent cascades and silencing cell survival signals. However, direct neurotoxicity of TNF-α is relatively weak, because TNF-α also increases production of neuroprotective factors. Accordingly, it is still controversial how TNF-α exerts neurotoxicity in neurodegenerative diseases. Here we have shown that TNF-α is the key cytokine that stimulates extensive microglial glutamate release in an autocrine manner by up-regulating glutaminase to cause excitoneurotoxicity. Further, we have demonstrated that the connexin 32 hemichannel of the gap junction is another main source of glutamate release from microglia besides glutamate transporters. Although pharmacological blockade of glutamate receptors is a promising therapeutic candidate for neurodegenerative diseases, the associated perturbation of physiological glutamate signals has severe adverse side effects. The unique mechanism of microglial glutamate release that we describe here is another potential therapeutic target. We rescued neuronal cell death in vitro by using a glutaminase inhibitor or hemichannel blockers to diminish microglial glutamate release without perturbing the physiological glutamate level. These drugs may give us a new therapeutic strategy against neurodegenerative diseases with minimum adverse side effects.

Central nervous system inflammation, including microglial activation, likely contributes to the neurotoxicity observed in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis (1Block M.L.

Microglia have been shown to act not only as antigen-presenting cells but also effector cells that can injure other cells in the central nervous system directly in vitro and in vivo (8Kempermann G. Neumann H. Science. 2003; 302: 1689-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus, inhibition of microglial activation is considered a therapeutic candidate for several neurodegenerative diseases. On the other hand, microglia also have neuroprotective effects mediated by neurotrophin release, glutamate uptake, and sequestering of neurotoxic substances (8Kempermann G. Neumann H. Science. 2003; 302: 1689-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 9Zietlow R. Dunnett S.B. Fawcett J.W. Eur. J.

Therefore, any therapeutic approach should inhibit the deleterious effects of microglia without diminishing their protective role. We sought to identify the source of these toxic factors produced by activated microglia. Recently, we demonstrated that activated microglia release large amounts of glutamate and that microglial neurotoxicity is mediated primarily by NMDA 3The abbreviations used are: NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; IL, interleukin; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor; TNFR, TNF receptor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; IκB, inhibitor of NF-κB; Cx, connexin; EAAT, excitatory amino acid transporter; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling; MTS, 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium; DON, 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine; THA, dl-threo-β-hydroxyaspartic acid; AAA, l-2-aminoadipic acid; GA, 18α-glycyrrhetinic acid; RT, reverse transcription; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase. 3The abbreviations used are: NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; IL, interleukin; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor; TNFR, TNF receptor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; IκB, inhibitor of NF-κB; Cx, connexin; EAAT, excitatory amino acid transporter; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling; MTS, 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium; DON, 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine; THA, dl-threo-β-hydroxyaspartic acid; AAA, l-2-aminoadipic acid; GA, 18α-glycyrrhetinic acid; RT, reverse transcription; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase.receptor signaling (13Takeuchi H.

In addition to glutamate, activated microglia release pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, interferon (IFN)-γ, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (14Sawada M. Kondo N.

TNF-α from activated microglia is a major neurotoxic cytokine that induces neurodegeneration through the silencing of cell survival signals and caspase-dependent cascades, including promotion of Fas ligand signals (1Block M.L.

However, direct neurotoxicity by TNF-α is relatively weak, because it also activates neuroprotective factors, including MAPK and expression of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (23Ghezzi P. Mennini T.

In this study, we have demonstrated that TNF-α is the key cytokine that stimulates extensive microglial glutamate release in an autocrine manner by up-regulating glutaminase to cause excitoneurotoxicity. Moreover, glutamate originating from microglia is released through the connexin (Cx)32 hemichannel of the gap junction more significantly than glutamate transporters such as excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT) and transport system X -c. We rescued neuronal cell death in vitro by using a glutaminase inhibitor or hemichannel blockers to diminish microglial glutamate release without perturbing physiological glutamate level. Thus, these drugs may give us a new therapeutic strategy against neurodegenerative diseases with minimum adverse side effects. Cell Culture—All reagents except those specifically mentioned were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The protocols for animal experiments were approved by the Animal Experiment Committee of Nagoya University. Microglia in 24-well multidishes at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well were prepared from newborn C57BL/6 mice with the “shaking off” method as described previously (25Suzumura A. Mezitis S.G. Gonatas N.K. Silberberg D.H. J. Neuroimmunol. 1987; 15: 263-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The purity of the cultures was >99% as determined by Fc receptor-specific immunostaining. Cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS), 5 μg/ml bovine insulin, and 0.2% glucose. Neuron cultures were prepared from C57BL/6 mice at embryonic day 17 as described previously (13Takeuchi H. Mizuno T. Zhang G. Wang J. Kawanokuchi J. Kuno R. Suzumura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10444-10454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Briefly, cortices were dissected and freed of meninges. Cortical fragments were dissociated into single cells using dissociation solution, and they were resuspended in Neuron Medium (serum-free conditioned medium from 48-h rat astrocyte confluent cultures based on Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 with N2 supplement (Sumitomo Bakelite, Akita, Japan). Primary neuronal cells were plated on 12-mm polyethyleneimine-coated coverslips (Asahi Techno Glass Corporation, Chiba, Japan) in 24-well multidishes at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well. The purity of the cultures was >95% as determined by NeuN-specific immunostaining. To assess the direct neurotoxicity of pro-inflammatory cytokines, neurons at 10-13 days in vitro were incubated with Neuron Medium (Sumitomo Bakelite) containing 1 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 100 ng/ml IL-1β, 100 ng/ml IL-6, 100 ng/ml IL-10, 100 ng/ml IFN-γ, or 100 ng/ml TNF-α (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Cultures were evaluated 24 h after stimulation. To assess microglial neurotoxicity, microglia were also cultured in the same media conditions described above. After a 24-h incubation, microglia-conditioned medium was applied to each well containing 5 × 104 neurons at 10-13 days in vitro. Neurons were evaluated 24 h after medium exchange. To assess neuroprotective effect, activated microglia treated with LPS or TNF-α were incubated with each drug as follows: 100 μg/ml anti-mouse TNF-α-neutralizing antibody (TECHNE Corporation, Minneapolis, MN); 20 μg/ml anti-mouse TNFR1-neutralizing antibody (R&D Systems); 20 μg/ml anti-mouse TNFR2 neutralizing antibody (R&D Systems); p38 MAPK inhibitor, 10 μm SB203580 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA); 10 μm JNK inhibitor (Calbiochem); MEK inhibitor, 10 μm PD98059 (Calbiochem); 100 μg/ml IκB kinase inhibitor (Calbiochem); glutaminase inhibitor, 1 mm DON; EAAT inhibitor, 100 μm THA; transporter system X -c inhibitor, 2.5 mm AAA; gap junction inhibitor, 100 μm carbenoxolone disodium (CBX; gap junction inhibitor), 50 μm GA; Cx32 mimetic peptide, 0.25 mg/l 32gap 24 (GHGDPLHLEEVKC, intracellular loop, position 110-122 of Cx32, Thermo Electron GmbH, Ulm, Germany); Cx32 mimetic peptide, 0.25 mg/l 32gap 27 (SRPTEKTVFT, extracellular loop 2, position 182-191 of Cx32, Thermo Electron GmbH); Cx43 mimetic peptide, 0.25 mg/l 43gap 27 (SRPTEKTIFII, extracellular loop 2, position 201-210 of Cx43, Thermo Electron GmbH). The purity of all connexin mimetic peptides was >98%. After a 24-h incubation, microglia-conditioned medium was applied to each well containing 5 × 104 neurons at 10-13 days in vitro. Evaluations of neuronal cultures were performed 24 h after medium exchange. Assessment of Neuritic Beading—To assess neuritic beading, neurons were observed with phase-contrast microscopy 24 h after stimulation as described previously (13Takeuchi H. Mizuno T. Zhang G. Wang J. Kawanokuchi J. Kuno R. Suzumura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10444-10454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). More than 200 neurons in duplicate wells were assessed blindly in three independent trials. The ratio of bead-bearing neurons was calculated as a percentage of total cells. Assessment of Cell Death—Cell death was assessed by the dye exclusion method with propidium iodide (Molecular Probes) as described previously (13Takeuchi H. Mizuno T. Zhang G. Wang J. Kawanokuchi J. Kuno R. Suzumura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10444-10454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 26Takeuchi H. Kobayashi Y. Ishigaki S. Doyu M. Sobue G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50966-50972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). More than 200 neurons in duplicate wells were assessed blindly in three independent trials with a conventional fluorescent microscope. The ratio of dead cells was calculated as a percentage of propidium iodide-positive cells among total cells. To detect apoptosis, we used the TUNEL assay with the in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) as described previously (13Takeuchi H. Mizuno T. Zhang G. Wang J. Kawanokuchi J. Kuno R. Suzumura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10444-10454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 26Takeuchi H. Kobayashi Y. Ishigaki S. Doyu M. Sobue G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50966-50972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). TUNEL assay was carried out 24 h after stimulation according to the manufacturer's protocol. As a positive control, neurons were incubated with 10 nm staurosporin for 24 h. More than 200 neurons in duplicate wells were assessed blindly in three independent trials under a conventional fluorescent microscope. The ratio of apoptotic cells was calculated as a percentage of TUNEL-positive cells among total cells. Assessment of Mitochondrial Impairment—To assess mitochondrial viability, we used the MTS assay with the CellTiter 96 Aqueous One-solution assay (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol as described previously (13Takeuchi H. Mizuno T. Zhang G. Wang J. Kawanokuchi J. Kuno R. Suzumura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10444-10454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar,26Takeuchi H. Kobayashi Y. Ishigaki S. Doyu M. Sobue G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50966-50972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Absorbance at 490 nm was measured in a multiple plate reader. Assays were carried out in six independent trials. Assessment of Intracellular ATP Levels—To measure intracellular ATP levels, we used a luminometric assay with the ApoSENSOR cell viability assay kit (BioVision, Mountain View, CA) as described previously (13Takeuchi H. Mizuno T. Zhang G. Wang J. Kawanokuchi J. Kuno R. Suzumura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10444-10454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Assays were carried out in six independent trials. ATP concentration was calculated as a percentage of control. Assessment of Glutamate Release—To measure extracellular glutamate concentrations, we used the Glutamate Assay Kit colorimetric assay (Yamasa Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) as described previously (13Takeuchi H. Mizuno T. Zhang G. Wang J. Kawanokuchi J. Kuno R. Suzumura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10444-10454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Assays were carried out in six independent trials. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR Analysis of Microglial Glutaminase—To examine mRNA expression of microglial glutaminase by RT-PCR analysis, 1 × 106 microglia plated on 24-well multidishes were treated with 1 μg/ml LPS or 100 ng/ml TNF-α for 12 h. Total RNA was extracted from microglia using the RNeasy Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). cDNAs encoding mouse glutaminase and GAPDH were generated by RT-PCR using Super Script II (Invitrogen) and Ampli TaqDNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems) with the following primers: glutaminase (sense), 5′-GTCACGATCTTGTTTCTCTGTG-3′; glutaminase (antisense), 5′-GTCCAAAGAGCAGTGCTTCATCCATG-3′; GAPDH (sense), 5′-ACTCACGGCAAATTCAACG-3′; and GAPDH (antisense), 5′-CCCTGTTGCTGTAGCCGTA-3′. Flow Cytochemistry—The expression level of the microglial gap junction was detected with flow cytometry. 5 × 104 microglia plated on 24-well multidishes were treated with 1 μg/ml LPS or 100 ng/ml TNF-α for 24 h. Cells were labeled with mouse monoclonal anti-mouse Cx32 or Cx43 antibody (1:200, Chemicon, Temecula, CA) for 20 min at 4 °C followed by labeling with Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody (1:300, Molecular Probes) for 20 min at 4 °C. Fluorescence signals were measured with a flow cytometer (Cytomics FC500, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Statistical Analysis—All results were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance with a Tukey-Kramer post hoc test using Statview software version 5 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). First, we examined neuronal damage caused by microglial cytokines by applying the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ, and TNF-α and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 to neurons or microglia. As LPS treatment induces release of these cytokines from microglia, we applied LPS to these cells. Recently, we demonstrated that neuritic beading, focal beadlike swellings in dendrites and axons, is an early pathological feature of neuronal cell dysfunction that precedes neuronal death (13Takeuchi H. Mizuno T. Zhang G. Wang J. Kawanokuchi J. Kuno R. Suzumura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10444-10454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We quantified neuronal damage as the ratio of neuritic bead-bearing cells to those with normal morphology, as well as the ratio of dead cells to living ones. Direct application of LPS, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and anti-inflammatory cytokines to neurons induced little neuritic beading (Fig. 1A, white bars) or neuronal death (Fig. 1B, white bars). TNF-α only weakly induced neuritic beading and neuronal death. Interferon-γ also induced some neuritic beading but resulted in little neuronal death. In contrast, conditioned medium from microglia treated with LPS or TNF-α induced numerous beads in most neurites and marked neuronal death (Fig. 1, A and B, black bars; Fig. 1, G and H). Consistent with these findings, LPS- or TNF-α-treated microglia had changed morphologically to the large amoeboid shape and appeared activated (Fig. 1, D and E). As described previously (13Takeuchi H. Mizuno T. Zhang G. Wang J. Kawanokuchi J. Kuno R. Suzumura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10444-10454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 27Bal-Price A. Brown G.C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6480-6491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Brown G.C. Bal-Price A. Mol. Neurobiol. 2003; 27: 325-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), very little apoptotic neuronal cell death was detected by TUNEL assay (data not shown). This neuronal damage was almost completely inhibited by the NMDA receptor antagonist MK801 (Fig. 1, A and B). These observations are consistent with a critical role for glutamate in the neuronal damage by LPS- and TNF-α-activated microglia. Moreover, neuronal damage by LPS- and TNF-α-activated microglia is likely to be excitoneurotoxicity through NMDA receptor signaling. Next we examined extracellular glutamate concentrations in our microglial cultures. Only conditioned media from microglia treated with LPS or TNF-α contained higher levels of glutamate (Fig. 2A), which is consistent with a previous report (35Piani D. Fontana A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3578-3585PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that NMDA receptor signaling induces a rapid drop in intracellular ATP levels by inhibiting mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV activity (13Takeuchi H. Mizuno T. Zhang G. Wang J. Kawanokuchi J. Kuno R. Suzumura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10444-10454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Conditioned media from LPS- or TNF-α-treated microglia also induced a rapid drop in intracellular ATP levels and mitochondrial dysfunction in neurons (Fig. 2, B and C). These findings are consistent with extracellular glutamate elevation. TNF-α is a ligand for TNFR1 and TNFR2. TNF-α promotes further microglial TNF-α production in an autocrine manner through TNFR1 signaling (29Kuno R. Wang J. Kawanokuchi J. Takeuchi H. Mizuno T. Suzumura A. J. Neuroimmunol. 2005; 162: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We assessed whether this TNF-α autocrine loop participates in microglial neurotoxicity and which TNF receptor mediates microglial glutamate release. First, LPS- or TNF-α-treated microglia were incubated with or without neutralizing antibodies for TNF-α or TNFR for 24 h. Subsequently, each microglial conditioned medium was applied to the neurons. Assessments were performed 24 h after medium exchange. TNF-α induced microglial glutamate release and subsequent neuronal damage in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3). Thereafter, neutralizing TNF-α with function-blocking antibodies reduced LPS- and TNF-α-induced microglial glutamate release and subsequent neuronal damage. Blockade of TNFR1 with function-blocking antibodies also suppressed LPS- and TNF-α-induced microglial glutamate release and subsequent neuronal damage, whereas blockade of TNFR2 had no effect (Fig. 3). Thus, TNF-α, acting through TNFR1 in an autocrine manner, is the key cytokine that promotes glutamate release from activated microglia in response to LPS to cause excitoneurotoxicity. TNF-α activates NF-κB through at least three MAPK pathways, including the p38 MAPK pathway, MEK1/2 pathway, and JNK pathway. However, none of the MAPK inhibitors we examined affected TNF-α-induced glutamate release and neurotoxicity (Fig. 4). Further, the inhibition of NF-κB activation with an IκB kinase inhibitor did not have significant effects on TNF-α-induced glutamate release and neurotoxicity. Thus, NF-κB does not appear to mediate glutamate release; other unknown pathways may be involved. In general, cells utilize two pathways to synthesize glutamate (30Newsholme P. Newsholme E.A. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 31Newsholme E.A. Calder P.C. Nutrition. 1997; 13: 728-730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Yudkoff M. Glia. 1997; 21: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 33Nissim I. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F493-F497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In one route of synthesis, glutamate dehydrogenase converts α-ketoglutaric acid to glutamate. Cellular homeostasis of glutamate levels is maintained primarily by this glutamate dehydrogenase pathway. In the other, glutaminase produces glutamate from glutamine. Cellular uptake of glutamine is through glutamine transporters. We assessed the contribution of the glutaminase pathway to TNF-α-induced microglial glutamate release by using a glutamine-free culture medium. Glutamine starvation abolished the effect of TNF-α treatment (Fig. 4A). It also inhibited the TNF-α-induced neurotoxicity of microglial conditioned media almost completely (Fig. 4, B and C). In a separate experiment, the glutaminase inhibitor DON suppressed TNF-α-induced glutamate release and subsequent neurotoxicity to levels similar to glutamine starvation. RT-PCR analysis revealed that both LPS and TNF-α up-regulated the mRNA expression of glutaminase in microglia (Fig. 5A). We conclude that TNF-α-induced glutamate synthesis in microglia is primarily through the glutaminase pathway. Next, we focused on glutamate release. Glutamate is considered to be secreted through exocytosis or glutamate transporters such as EAATs and transporter system X -c (34Nicholls D. Attwell D. Trends Pharmacol.

Acta. 2005; 1711: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Additionally, TNF-α reportedly enhances the expression of hemichannels on microglia (41Eugenin E.A. Eckardt D. Theis M. Willecke K. Bennett M.V.L. Sáez J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4190-4195Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the effects of gap junction and glutamate transporter inhibitors in our culture system. The gap junction inhibitors carbenoxolone disodium and GA markedly reduced TNF-α-induced microglial glutamate release and subsequent neurotoxicity more significantly than the transporter system X -c inhibitor AAA, whereas the EAAT inhibitor THA did not (Fig. 4). These data support a model in which the hemichannel of the gap junction is another main source of glutamate release from microglia besides transporter system X -c. Thereafter, we examined the effect of the hemichannel-specific blocker using connexin mimetic peptides in our system as described previously (42De Vuyst E. Decrock E. Cabooter L. Dubyak G.R. Naus C.C. Evans W.H. Leybaert L. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Blockade of Cx32 with 32gap27 or 32gap27 strikingly diminished TNF-α-induced microglial glutamate release and subsequent neurotoxicity, whereas blockade of Cx43 with 43gap27 did not (Fig. 4). Interestingly, flow cytometric analysis of either LPS- or TNF-α-treated microglia exhibited up-regulated cell surface expression of Cx32 (Fig. 5B), whereas neither LPS nor TNF-α affect microglial surface expression of Cx43 (data not shown). Hence, Cx32 hemichannels of gap junctions is the novel principal site of TNF-α-induced glutamate release from microglia. In this study, we provide the first evidence that TNF-α is the key cytokine that promotes excitoneurotoxicity by inducing microglial glutamate release in an autocrine manner (Fig. 6). Recent studies have reported that TNF-α enhances excitotoxicity through synergistic stimulation of TNFR and NMDA receptor (43Floden A.M. Li S. Combs C.K. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2566-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and by inhibition of astroglial glutamate uptake through the glutamate transporter (44Zou J.Y. Crews F.T. Brain Res. 2005; 1034: 11-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). We observed that TNF-α directly induces glutamate release from microglia and subsequent excitotoxic neuronal death. We demonstrated that glutamine starvation and a glutaminase inhibitor strikingly reduce glutamate release to the control levels. Cellular homeostasis of glutamate levels may be maintained primarily by the glutamate dehydrogenase pathway (30Newsholme P. Newsholme E.A. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 31Newsholme E.A. Calder P.C. Nutrition. 1997; 13: 728-730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Yudkoff M. Glia. 1997; 21: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 33Nissim I. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F493-F497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data reveal that TNF-α stimulates microglia to produce large amounts of redundant glutamate through up-regulation of glutaminase but not glutamate dehydrogenase. Thus, inhibition of glutaminase did not suppress the glutamate production of control cultures. In other words, the glutaminase inhibitor only affected induced glutamate synthesis but did not perturb essential glutamate production. Therefore, glutaminase inhibitors may prevent neurotoxicity by activated microglia specifically without serious adverse effects. Further, we demonstrated that the Cx32 hemichannel of gap junction is another principal source of TNF-α-induced glutamate release from microglia besides transporter system X -c. Moreover, TNF-α enhances the surface expression of Cx32 hemichannels. Activated microglia can undergo dramatic morphological change and dynamic movement. Accordingly, gap junctions of activated microglia may be more openly exposed to the extracellular space than those of other central nervous system cells. Thus, inhibitors of gap junctions may be more effective in suppressing glutamate release from microglia, and this specificity may translate into fewer adverse side effects during treatment. Treatment with TNF-α-neutralizing antibodies is an effective therapy for autoimmune diseases (45Illei G.G. Lipsky P.E. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 712-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This therapy, however, has serious adverse side effects, including an increased risk for infections such as tuberculosis. Thus, TNF-α-neutralizing therapy is not readily applicable to neurodegenerative diseases, even though TNF-α may play an important role in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Blockade of NMDA receptors is another promising therapy for neurodegenerative diseases (46Parsons C.G. Danysz W. Quack G. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 735-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). However, adverse effects increase in a dose-dependent manner. The present study provides two new possibilities for therapeutic targets, the enzyme glutaminase and gap junctions. Inhibitors directed against these targets may be specific therapeutic candidates for activated microglia-mediated neurodegenerative diseases (Fig. 6). We are planning more thorough studies to investigate this issue. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that TNF-α induces microglial glutamate release from Cx32 hemichannels of gap junctions through the up-regulating glutaminase to promote excitoneurotoxicity. Either the glutaminase inhibitor or gap junction inhibitors may be a novel effective strategy for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases with minimum adverse side effects."

We investigated the potential role of a Nox2-containing NADPH oxidase in aldosterone-induced fibrosis and the involvement of this mechanism in AngII-induced effects. Nox2-/- mice were compared with matched wild-type controls (WT). In WT mice, subcutaneous (s.c.) AngII (1.1 mg/kg/day for 2 wk) significantly increased NADPH oxidase activity, interstitial fibrosis (11.5+/-1.0% vs. 7.2+/-0.7%; P<0.05), expression of fibronectin, procollagen I, and connective tissue growth factor mRNA, MMP-2 activity, and NF-kB activation. These effects were all inhibited in Nox2-/- hearts. The mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone inhibited AngII-induced increases in NADPH oxidase activity and the increase in interstitial fibrosis. In a model of mineralocorticoid-dependent hypertension involving chronic aldosterone infusion (0.2 mg/kg/day) and a 1% Na Cl diet (""ALDO""), WT animals exhibited increased NADPH oxidase activity, pro-fibrotic gene expression, MMP-2 activity, NF-kB activation, and significant interstitial cardiac fibrosis (12.0+/-1.7% with ALDO vs. 6.3+/-0.3% without; P<0.05). These effects were inhibited in Nox2-/- ALDO mice (e.g., fibrosis 6.8+/-0.8% with ALDO vs. 5.8+/-1.0% without ALDO; P=NS). These results suggest that aldosterone-dependent activation of a Nox2-containing NADPH oxidase contributes to the profibrotic effect of AngII in the heart as well as the fibrosis seen in mineralocorticoid-dependent hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W2030951856,"Thyroid hormones affect cardiac growth and phenotype; however, the mechanisms by which the hormones induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy remain uncharacterized. Tri-iodo-l-thyronine (T3) treatment of cultured cardiomyocytes for 24 h resulted in a 41 ± 5% (p < 0.001) increase in [3H]leucine incorporation into total cellular protein. This response was abrogated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, wortmannin. Co-immunoprecipitation studies showed a direct interaction of cytosol-localized thyroid hormone receptor TRα1 and the p85α subunit of PI3K. T3 treatment rapidly increased PI3K activity by 52 ± 3% (p < 0.005), which resulted in increased phosphorylation of downstream kinases Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). This effect was abrogated by pretreatment with wortmannin or LY294002. Phosphorylation of p70S6K, a known target of mTOR, occurred rapidly following T3 treatment and was inhibited by rapamycin and wortmannin. In contrast, phosphorylation of the p85 variant of S6K in response to T3 was not blocked by LY294002, wortmannin, or rapamycin, thus supporting a T3-activated pathway independent of PI3K and mTOR. 40 S ribosomal protein S6, a target of p70S6K, and 4E-BP1, a target of mTOR, were both phosphorylated within 15–25 min of T3 treatment and could be inhibited by wortmannin and rapamycin. Thus, rapid T3-mediated activation of PI3K by cytosolic TRα1 and subsequent activation of the Akt-mTOR-S6K signaling pathway may underlie one of the mechanisms by which thyroid hormone regulates physiological cardiac growth."
https://openalex.org/W2026259043,"Myocardial infarction is a manifestation of necrotic cell death as a result of opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). Receptor-mediated cardioprotection is triggered by an intracellular signaling pathway that includes phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase, guanylyl cyclase, protein kinase G (PKG), and the mitochondrial KATP channel (mitoKATP). In this study, we explored the pathway that links mitoKATP with the MPT. We confirmed previous findings that diazoxide and activators of PKG or protein kinase C (PKC) inhibited MPT opening. We extended these results and showed that other K+ channel openers as well as the K+ ionophore valinomycin also inhibited MPT opening and that this inhibition required reactive oxygen species. By using isoform-specific peptides, we found that the effects of KATP channel openers, PKG, or valinomycin were mediated by a PKCϵ. Activation of PKCϵ by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or H2O2 resulted in mitoKATP-independent inhibition of MPT opening, whereas activation of PKCϵ by PKG or the specific PKCϵ agonist ψϵ receptor for activated C kinase caused mitoKATP-dependent inhibition of MPT opening. Exogenous H2O2 inhibited MPT, because of its activation of PKCϵ, with an IC50 of 0.4 (±0.1) μm. On the basis of these results, we propose that two different PKCϵ pools regulate this signaling pathway, one in association with mitoKATP and the other in association with MPT.

A major component of ischemia-reperfusion injury is necrotic cell death, manifested at the organ level as infarction. Necrotic cell death is widely thought to be the consequence of opening the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), 2The abbreviations used are: MPT, mitochondrial permeability transition; mitoKATP, the mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K+ channel; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; TEA+, tetraethylammonium cation; 5-HD, 5-hydroxydecanoic acid; PMA, 12-phorbol 13-myristate acetate; PKC, protein kinase C; PKG, protein kinase G isoform 1α; TPP+, tetraphenylphosphonium ion; ROS, reactive oxygen species; RACK, receptor for activated C kinase; RR, ruthenium red; Dzx, diazoxide; MPG, N-2-mercaptopropionylglycine. 2The abbreviations used are: MPT, mitochondrial permeability transition; mitoKATP, the mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K+ channel; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; TEA+, tetraethylammonium cation; 5-HD, 5-hydroxydecanoic acid; PMA, 12-phorbol 13-myristate acetate; PKC, protein kinase C; PKG, protein kinase G isoform 1α; TPP+, tetraphenylphosphonium ion; ROS, reactive oxygen species; RACK, receptor for activated C kinase; RR, ruthenium red; Dzx, diazoxide; MPG, N-2-mercaptopropionylglycine. as proposed originally by Crompton et al. (1Crompton M. Ellinger H. Costi A. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 357-360PubMed Google Scholar) and recently by Di Lisa et al. (2Di Lisa F. Menabo R. Canton M. Barile M. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2571-2575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Strong protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury is afforded by a brief preliminary ischemic period, a phenomenon known as ischemic preconditioning, which was also shown to reduce MPT opening (3Hausenloy D.J. Maddock H.L. Baxter G.F. Yellon D.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 55: 534-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 4Hausenloy D.J. Tsang A. Yellon D.M. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2005; 15: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear how MPT opening is prevented when cardioprotection is triggered by ischemic preconditioning or pharmacological mitoKATP openers such as diazoxide. In this regard, Korge et al. (5Korge P. Honda H.M. Weiss J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3312-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) have made important progress. They simulated ischemia in isolated mitochondria with anoxia and then exposed them to elevated Ca2+ and phosphate (Pi). These conditions caused MPT opening and cytochrome c loss, which were blocked by diazoxide or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Both effects were negated by 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD), indicating that the protective effect of PKC in blocking MPT pore opening operates through mitoKATP opening. Kim et al. (6Kim J.S. Ohshima S. Pediaditakis P. Lemasters J.J. Hepatology. 2004; 39: 1533-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) showed that MPT was inhibited by cyclic GMP in the presence of a cytosolic extract, implicating a guanylyl cyclase-dependent signaling pathway. Baines et al. (7Baines C.P. Song C.X. Zheng Y.T. Wang G.W. Zhang J. Wang O.L. Guo Y. Bolli R. Cardwell E.M. Ping P. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) showed that mice with cardiac-specific expression of recombinant PKCϵ showed inhibition of MPT opening in heart mitochondria and identified a multiprotein complex in mitochondria containing PKCϵ, adenine nucleotide translocator, the voltage-dependent anion channel, and hexokinase. Adenine nucleotide translocator, voltage-dependent anion channel, hexokinase, and cyclophilin D are hypothesized to be constituents of MPT (8Crompton M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 529: 11-21Crossref Scopus (276) Google Scholar). These findings take on greater significance with our recent demonstration that protein kinase G (PKG) opens mitoKATP and that this effect is mediated via an endogenous mitochondrial PKCϵ (9Costa A.D. Garlid K.D. West I.C. Lincoln T.M. Downey J.M. Cohen M.V. Critz S.D. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). We showed that addition of PKG + cGMP to isolated mitochondria from rat heart, brain, or liver resulted in increased K+ influx comparable with that induced by diazoxide or cromakalin and that these effects were blocked by PKCϵ-specific inhibitors. We now show that exogenous PKG + cGMP inhibits MPT and that this protective effect is blocked by inhibitors of PKG, PKCϵ, and mitoKATP. Thus, mitoKATP is an obligatory intermediate in the PKG-dependent inhibition of MPT. We show that valinomycin mimics the effects of PKG, PKCϵ, or mitoKATP activators, establishing that this protective effect of mitoKATP opening is due specifically to K+ influx into the mitochondrion. Moreover, inhibition of MPT by mitoKATP opening or valinomycin is blocked by an ROS scavenger and by PKCϵ inhibitors, indicating that a mitoKATP-dependent increase in mitochondrial ROS production is the signal transmitted to the PKCϵ-MPT interaction. Activation of endogenous PKCϵ by PMA or H2O2 also inhibits MPT opening, and this effect does not involve mitoKATP opening. The latter results suggest that two different PKCϵ-containing subcomplexes modify these mitochondrial functions. These and other recent findings from our group lead to a preliminary model of the mitochondrial segment of the cardioprotective signaling pathway that inhibits MPT opening and cell necrosis. Mitochondrial Isolation—Heart, liver, and brain mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation from male Sprague-Dawley rats (220–240 g) exactly as described previously (9Costa A.D. Garlid K.D. West I.C. Lincoln T.M. Downey J.M. Cohen M.V. Critz S.D. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Mitoplasts were prepared by digitonin permeabilization of the outer membrane (10Schnaitman C. Greenawalt J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1968; 38: 158-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Measurement of Light Scattering—Matrix swelling is the standard technique for assaying the MPT. As described previously (11Beavis A.D. Brannan R.D. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13424-13433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Garlid K.D. Beavis A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13434-13441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), light scattering changes of mitochondrial suspensions (0.1 mg/ml) were followed at 520 nm and 30 °C and are reported as β, which is inverse absorbance normalized for protein concentration, Ps, as shown in Equation 1, β=Ps×(1/A−1/A∞)(Eq. 1) Rates of light scattering change, reflecting rates of matrix swelling, were obtained by taking the linear term of a second-order polynomial fit of the light scattering trace, calculated over the initial 2 min following MPT induction by the uncoupler (from 60–180 s after mitochondrial addition). Data in this paper are summarized in bar graphs as “Ca2+-induced swelling rate (%),” which is calculated by taking Ca2+-induced swelling rates in the absence and the presence of 1 μm cyclosporin A as 100 and 0%, respectively. Statistical significance of the difference of the means was assessed using unpaired Student's t test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant and is indicated in each figure by an asterisk. (All asterisks indicate comparison of that particular mean with Fig. 1B, column Ca2+.) Except where noted, assay medium contained K+ salts of Cl– (120 mm), HEPES, pH 7.2 (10 mm), succinate (10 mm), and phosphate (5 mm). Where indicated, tetraethylammonium (TEA+) or Li+ salts replaced K+ salts. All traces were also supplemented with MgCl2 (0.5 mm), 5 μm rotenone, 0.67 μm oligomycin, and 50 μm Na+/K+-ATP. In K+-free media, Tris salts of ATP were used. Osmolality of all media ranged between 275 and 280 mosm. Assay of MPT—In vitro studies of MPT have traditionally been performed in media containing sucrose, to support irreversible swelling, and lacking Mg2+ and ATP, which inhibit MPT (13Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). However, in order to study interactions among mitoKATP, PKC, and MPT, it was necessary to employ salt media containing Mg2+ and ATP. By using these media, we observed that high [Ca2+] caused a robust MPT opening after a variable time lag of 1–3 min duration. Bernardi and co-workers (14Petronilli V. Cola C. Massari S. Colonna R. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21939-21945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that the time lag is primarily a population effect, reflecting the fraction of mitochondria that have been recruited at a given time, and they showed that it is possible to synchronize MPT opening by sequential additions of Ca2+, ruthenium red (RR), and CCCP. This protocol was followed in all of the experiments reported here. Mitochondria (0.1 mg of mitochondrial protein/ml) were added to medium at 30 °C (t = 0). CaCl2 was added at 20 s; RR (0.5 μm, to block further Ca2+ uptake) was added at 40 s; and CCCP (250 nm, to initiate MPT) was added at 60 s. Free Ca2+ concentrations were calculated using the Free-ware computer program BAD4 (15Brooks S.P. Storey K.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Immunodetection of PKCϵ—Samples (80 μg) from crude mitochondria, Percoll-purified mitochondria, and mitoplasts made from Percoll-purified mitochondria were precipitated using methanol/chloroform (Ref. 16Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3108) Google Scholar with minor modifications) and resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking with 3% gelatin in Tris-buffered saline, immunoblots were exposed to anti-PKCϵ antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories) in a 1:500 dilution followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (immunoblot assay kit goat anti-mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase; Bio-Rad). A colorimetric assay was used to visualize antigen-antibody reactions following the manufacturer's instructions. Chemicals—Protein kinase G isoform Iα, cGMP, KT5823, Gö6983, and Ro318220 were purchased from Calbiochem. PKC isoform-specific peptides were synthesized by EZ Biolabs (Westfield, IN), according to the published amino acid sequences (17Chen L. Hahn H. Wu G. Chen C.H. Liron T. Schechtman D. Cavallaro G. Banci L. Guo Y. Bolli R. Dorn II, G.W. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11114-11119Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were from Sigma. The PKG1α concentration and activity used in this study was comparable with that used in our previous paper, and the concentration present in cells (see Ref. 9Costa A.D. Garlid K.D. West I.C. Lincoln T.M. Downey J.M. Cohen M.V. Critz S.D. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar and references therein). In the present experiments the enzyme had a specific activity of 10 units/μg (1 unit is the amount of enzyme required to transfer 1 pmol of phosphate from ATP to the synthetic substrate GRT-GRRNSI per min at 30 °C). We used 25 ng/ml, corresponding to 1.5 × 10–10 mol/liter. PKG in smooth muscle cells is ∼1 × 10–7 mol/liter and slightly lower in cardiomyocytes (9Costa A.D. Garlid K.D. West I.C. Lincoln T.M. Downey J.M. Cohen M.V. Critz S.D. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Regulation of MPT by mitoKATP—A typical set of experiments carried out in K+ medium (see “Materials and Methods”) is shown in Fig. 1A. That the Ca2+-dependent swelling (Fig. 1A, trace marked none) is because of MPT opening is confirmed by the fact that it was inhibited by cyclosporin A. The KATP channel opener diazoxide (Dzx) also inhibited MPT opening, and 5-HD (Fig. 1A, Dzx + 5HD) blocked this inhibition. In this and the experiments that follow, we added mitoKATP openers and blockers either before or immediately after the mitochondria and before adding Ca2+. Fig. 1B summarizes the results of experiments carried out as in Fig. 1A. It can be seen that both selective (diazoxide) and nonselective (cromakalim and nicorandil) mitoKATP channel openers inhibited MPT opening and that this inhibition was blocked by the mitoKATP blocker 5-HD (18Jaburek M. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Paucek P. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13578-13582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as by the nonselective mitoKATP blocker tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+) (19Mironova G.D. Negoda A.E. Marinov B.S. Paucek P. Costa A.D.T. Grigoriev S.M. Skarga Y.Y. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32562-32568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Importantly, valinomycin also inhibited MPT opening at a concentration that increases K+ flux to the same extent as a KATP channel opener (20Costa A.D.T. Quinlan C. Andrukhiv A. West I.C. Garlid K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: H406-H415Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). As expected, this effect of valinomycin was not blocked by 5-HD. We conclude from these results that mitoKATP opening inhibits MPT in isolated heart mitochondria and that the inhibition is a consequence of mitoKATP-dependent K+ influx. mitoKATP Opening Inhibits MPT via ROS Activation of PKCϵ—The preceding results raised the following question How does increased K+ uptake into the matrix cause inhibition of MPT? We have shown that net K+ influx leads to matrix alkalinization and thereby to increased ROS production (20Costa A.D.T. Quinlan C. Andrukhiv A. West I.C. Garlid K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: H406-H415Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 21Garlid K.D. Basic Res. Cardiol. 2000; 95: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 22Andrukhiv A. Costa A.D.T. Garlid K.D. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2005; 38: 813Google Scholar). It is known that increased ROS activates protein kinases (23Korichneva I. Hoyos B. Chua R. Levi E. Hammerling U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44327-44331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar); and it has been reported that PKCϵ inhibits MPT opening in heart mitochondria (5Korge P. Honda H.M. Weiss J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3312-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 7Baines C.P. Song C.X. Zheng Y.T. Wang G.W. Zhang J. Wang O.L. Guo Y. Bolli R. Cardwell E.M. Ping P. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we hypothesized that a PKC may be an intermediate in this process. We investigated the effects of ROS scavengers and PKC inhibitors on mitoKATP-mediated MPT inhibition, with the results shown in Fig. 2. These data show that diazoxide-mediated inhibition of MPT opening was blocked by the free radical scavenger MPG, by the PKC inhibitors chererythrine and Ro318220, and by the PKCϵ-specific inhibitor peptide ϵV1–2 (17Chen L. Hahn H. Wu G. Chen C.H. Liron T. Schechtman D. Cavallaro G. Banci L. Guo Y. Bolli R. Dorn II, G.W. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11114-11119Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Moreover, MPT inhibition mediated by valinomycin was also inhibited by MPG or ϵV1–2. MPT inhibition by diazoxide was not blocked by the PKCδ inhibitor Gö6983, by the PKCδ-specific inhibitor peptide δV1–1, or by the scrambled peptide analogue of ϵV1–2 (not shown). On the basis of these findings, we conclude that mitoKATP opening inhibits MPT via PKCϵ which is activated by valinomycin- or mitoKATP-dependent ROS production. PKG-mediated MPT Inhibition Occurs via mitoKATP, ROS, and PKCϵ—We showed recently that addition of PKG + cGMP to isolated rat heart mitochondria causes PKCϵ-dependent opening of mitoKATP (9Costa A.D. Garlid K.D. West I.C. Lincoln T.M. Downey J.M. Cohen M.V. Critz S.D. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). This finding, together with the results contained in Figs. 1B and 2, suggests that PKG + cGMP should inhibit MPT in a mitoKATP- and ROS-dependent manner. This is indeed the case, as shown in Fig. 3. Inhibition of MPT by PKG + cGMP was blocked by the PKG-specific inhibitor KT5823, by the mitoKATP blockers 5-HD, glibenclamide, and TPP+, by the ROS scavenger MPG, and by the PKCϵ inhibitors chelerythrine and peptide ϵV1–2. PKG-induced MPT inhibition was not blocked by the PKCδ inhibitor peptide δV1–1. Moreover, neither heat-inactivated PKG nor PKG in the absence of cGMP had any effect on MPT (data not shown). From these experiments, we conclude that PKG inhibits MPT via mitoKATP opening and that this effect is mediated by PKCϵ and ROS. Evidence for Two PKCϵs, One Upstream and the Other Downstream of mitoKATP—The finding in Fig. 2 that the peptide ϵV1–2 blocks mitoKATP inhibition of MPT leads us to conclude that PKCϵ is downstream of mitoKATP; however, the finding that PKCϵ is required for mitoKATP opening by PKG + cGMP (9Costa A.D. Garlid K.D. West I.C. Lincoln T.M. Downey J.M. Cohen M.V. Critz S.D. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) implies that PKCϵ is upstream of mitoKATP. Fig. 4 contains data that address the question of how PKCϵ can be both upstream and downstream of mitoKATP. In both Fig. 4A (K+ medium) and Fig. 4B (TEA+ medium), we see that MPT was inhibited by the PKCϵ activators PMA and H2O2. MPT was not inhibited by the inactive αPMA (data not shown). Inhibition by PMA and H2O2 was prevented by the PKCϵ-specific peptide inhibitor ϵV1–2 but not by glibenclamide (Fig. 4, A and B) or 5-HD (data not shown). Thus, PKCϵ activation by PMA or H2O2 can inhibit MPT directly, without intervention of mitoKATP. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that PMA and H2O2 have identical effects in K+ medium (Fig. 4A) and TEA+ medium (Fig. 4B). Note in particular that the peptide ϵV1–2 is still able to block PMA or H2O2 inhibition of MPT in K+-free medium, showing that a PKCϵ exists that can modulate MPT without the intervention of mitoKATP. The data in Fig. 4A are in apparent disagreement with the findings of Korge et al. (5Korge P. Honda H.M. Weiss J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3312-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), who found that 5-HD blocked PMA protection just as it did diazoxide protection. A possible explanation for this result is that mitoKATP was not sufficiently blocked before addition of PMA, and therefore MPT was blocked via the mitoKATP-dependent pathway. We can obtain the same result if we add PMA simultaneously with 5-HD. In our protocols, PMA was added 4 s after 5-HD. Under these conditions, glibenclamide (or 5-HD; data not shown) consistently fails to inhibit the protective effect of PMA or H2O2, as shown in Fig. 4A. Again, this ability of PMA or H2O2 to inhibit MPT by a mitoKATP-independent pathway is confirmed by the findings in TEA+ medium (Fig. 4B). In contrast to the results with PMA or H2O2, PKCϵ activation by PKG + cGMP (9Costa A.D. Garlid K.D. West I.C. Lincoln T.M. Downey J.M. Cohen M.V. Critz S.D. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) or by the pseudo-RACK peptide ψϵRACK cannot inhibit MPT directly and requires mitoKATP opening as an intermediate. This is evidenced by the fact that the effects of these agents were abolished by glibenclamide (Fig. 4A) or 5-HD (not shown). (The K½ for ΨϵRACK in opening mitoKATP was about 0.2 μm, and 2 mm ΨϵRACK was also ineffective in blocking MPT in the presence of glibenclamide.) These findings suggest that two different PKCϵ pools are involved in this part of the mitochondrial signaling pathway, one in association with mitoKATP and the other in association with MPT. This conclusion is confirmed by experiments performed in K+-free medium (Fig. 4B), in which diazoxide, or PKG + cGMP, or ψϵRACK was ineffective in inhibiting MPT. H2O2-induced Inhibition of H2O2-induced MPT Opening—MPT onset in vivo is thought to be an interplay between Ca2+, ROS, and the anti-oxidant system (glutathione peroxidase in heart mitochondria) (24Kowaltowski A.J. Castilho R.F. Vercesi A.E. FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 12-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 25Antunes F. Han D. Cadenas E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1260-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In the presence of phosphate, MPT can be elicited with high concentrations of Ca2+ and the low amounts of H2O2 that are normally produced by the respiratory chain. In the 1st two bars of Fig. 5, 100 μm free Ca2+ caused MPT opening; however, when 2 μm H2O2 was added prior to the Ca2+, MPT opening was inhibited. MPT can also be induced by a combination of low Ca2+ and high H2O2 (24Kowaltowski A.J. Castilho R.F. Vercesi A.E. FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 12-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows that 2 μm free Ca2+ was insufficient to open MPT, whereas 2 μm Ca2+ plus 100 μm H2O2 caused MPT opening. Interestingly, pretreatment with a low concentration (2 μm) of H2O2 inhibited the onset of MPT. The protection afforded by low preconditioning concentrations of H2O2 is mediated by activation of the MPT-associated PKCϵ, as shown by reversal of the inhibition by the specific inhibitor peptide ϵV1–2. Furthermore, this protection is independent of mitoKATP activity, as evidenced by the inability of 5-HD to inhibit it (Fig. 5). In further experiments not shown, we have estimated the concentration dependence of H2O2 inhibition of MPT and found that the IC50 is 400 ± 100 nm (n = 4). mitoKATP-dependent Inhibition of MPT via ROS and PKCϵ in Isolated Liver and Brain Mitochondria—The pathway that transmits the signal from extra-mitochondrial PKG to mitoKATP is also present in rat brain and rat liver mitochondria (9Costa A.D. Garlid K.D. West I.C. Lincoln T.M. Downey J.M. Cohen M.V. Critz S.D. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 6 show that the pathways in rat liver mitochondria are exactly the same as those described for rat heart mitochondria in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4. Similarly, in experiments with n = 2–4 for each condition, we observed identical behavior in isolated rat brain mitochondria (not shown). Therefore, this signaling pathway appears to be a general phenomenon in mammalian mitochondria. Immunodetection of PKCϵ in Rat Heart Mitochondria—Crude and Percoll-purified heart mitochondria and mitoplasts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for immunodetection with anti-PKCϵ antibodies (1:500). Percoll purification removes contaminants, including microsomes and peroxisomes (26Mickelson J.R. Greaser M.L. Marsh B.B. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7, similar amounts of PKC were detected in Percoll-purified mitochondrial and mitoplasts, whereas a higher amount was found in non-Percoll-purified mitochondria, perhaps reflecting contamination with sarcolemmal membranes and cytoplasmic proteins (26Mickelson J.R. Greaser M.L. Marsh B.B. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, we conclude that heart mitochondria contain endogenous PKCϵ. The finding that PKCϵ is retained in mitoplasts indicates that this PKCϵ is either associated with the outer surface of the inner membrane or in the matrix or both. In the biology of ischemia, mitoKATP opening has come to be seen as protective and MPT opening as harmful. The relationships between these two phenomena have been explored, but previously there has been no clear picture of the overall process. Korge et al. (5Korge P. Honda H.M. Weiss J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3312-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) have shown that activation of mitoKATP results in inhibition of MPT. Korge et al. (5Korge P. Honda H.M. Weiss J.N.

Lemasters J.J. Hepatology. 2004; 39: 1533-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) have shown that activation of a cytosolic PKG resulted in inhibition of MPT. In view of our recent results showing that PKG opens mitoKATP via PKCϵ (9Costa A.D. Garlid K.D. West I.C. Lincoln T.M. Downey J.M. Cohen M.V. Critz S.D. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and that mitoKATP activation stimulates ROS production (22Andrukhiv A. Costa A.D.T. Garlid K.D. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2005; 38: 813Google Scholar), we can now propose a complete picture of a signaling pathway present in mitochondria that extends the abovementioned findings. The data in this paper show that mitoKATP opening inhibits MPT opening in heart, liver, and brain mitochondria and that it does so via K+ flux, increased ROS, and PKCϵ (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). We confirm and extend the findings of Korge et al. (5Korge P. Honda H.M. Weiss J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3312-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and Baines et al.

The rather complex sequence of reactions is contained in Fig. 8, which also displays the agonists and antagonists on which the sequence is based. Fig. 9 contains a descriptive diagram of the interrelationships among mitoKATP, PKCϵ, and MPT. Our data indicate that two different PKCϵ pools are involved. PKCϵ1 is upstream of mitoKATP and is required for opening of mitoKATP by PKG + cGMP (see Ref. 9Costa A.D. Garlid K.D. West I.C. Lincoln T.M. Downey J.M. Cohen M.V. Critz S.D. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar and the diagrams in Figs. 8 and 9). PKCϵ2 is downstream of mitoKATP and is required for mitoKATP-mediated inhibition of MPT (Figs. 2 and 3 and the diagrams in Figs. 8 and 9). The remainder of the “Discussion” will explore the basis of these conclusions and the proposed mechanisms.FIGURE 9The cardioprotective signaling pathway in mitochondria. In step 1, activated PKG, which cannot cross the outer mitochondrial membrane, phosphorylates a protein at the external surface of the outer membrane. This leads by an unknown mechanism to activation of PKCϵ1, which is presumably bound to the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane. In step 2, PKCϵ1 phosphorylates mitoKATP, causing it to open and catalyze net K+ influx (step 3) (9Costa A.D. Garlid K.D. West I.C. Lincoln T.M. Downey J.M. Cohen M.V. Critz S.D. Circ.

The circadian clock mechanism in the mouse is driven by interacting positive and negative transcriptional feedback loops (1Lowrey P.L. Takahashi J.S. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum.

Previously, we showed in the liver clock that the promoter regions of mPer1 and mPer2 undergo rhythmic acetylation of histone H3 that correlates with their transcriptional activation (16Etchegaray J.-P. Lee C. Wade P.A. Reppert S.M. Nature. 2003; 421: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). We proposed that at the time of transcriptional inhibition the mCRY proteins disrupt a CLOCK·BMAL1·coactivator complex thereby reducing histone acetyltransferase activity. As histone deacetylase activity is constantly associated with the CLOCK·BMAL1 nuclear complex, the balance between acetylation and deacetylation of H3 on circadian promoters appears to be regulated by the rhythmic regulation of histone acetyltransferase activity, with deacetylation predominating during transcriptional repression. Other groups have also reported H3 acetylation rhythms at circadian promoters (17Curtis A.M. Seo S.B. Westgate E.J. Rudic R.D. Smyth E.M. Chakravarti D. FitzGerald G.A. McNamara P. J. Biol.

As multiprotein complexes, the PcG proteins of flies and mammals can be divided into at least two distinct groups, the Pc-repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and PRC2 (22Cao R. Zhang Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). The current model of transcriptional repression by PcG proteins proposes that the binding of the PRC2 to responsive promoters initiates histone deacetylation and the methylation of lysine 27 in H3 (H3K27). H3K27 di- and trimethylation then recruit the PRC1 that represses gene expression by inhibiting transcriptional initiation (23Gil J. Bernard D. Peters G.

Nature. 2003; 421: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). DNA was isolated from the immunoprecipitates and subjected to quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using primer pairs directed to the promoter regions of mPer1 of mPer2, as described (16Etchegaray J.-P. Lee C. Wade P.A. Reppert S.M. Nature. 2003; 421: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Each qPCR was performed using the ABI-PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) with a SyberGreen Master Mix (Qiagen). To ensure specific amplification, every run was followed by a dissociation phase analysis (7000 SDS, Applied Biosystems). The data were normalized to input control, which consisted of PCR reactions from cross-linked chromatin before immunoprecipitation.RNA Interference Assays—Small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides targeting mEzh2 were transfected into NIH 3T3 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). mEZH2 protein expression in the presence or absence of siRNA oligonucleotides was visualized by Western blot analysis using anti-EZH2 antibody. The percentage of siRNA knockdown was determined by normalizing the levels of mEZH2 to Tubulin (Sigma).Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs targeting mEzh2 were cloned into the lentivirus vector, and pLL3.7. Lentiviruses carrying mEzh2-shRNA constructs were made in HEK 293T cells and purified by Millipore filtration (0.45 mm) followed by ultracentrifugation as described by Rubinson and colleagues (33Rubinson D.A.

NIH 3T3 cells were infected with these mEzh2-shRNA lentiviruses and after 48 h, cells were subjected to formaldehyde cross-linking as described by Cao and Zhang (34Cao R. Zhang Y. Mol.

Chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIP) using anti-EZH2 or anti-trimethyl-H3K27 were performed as described above.

The mPer2-luc reporter construct was generated by cloning the 5′ region from -1.8 to +0.1 kb of the mPer2 promoter into the pGL3 R2.1 plasmid (Promega), which expresses a destabilized form of luciferase. The region from -318 to +5of mBmal1 was subcloned into the pGL3 R2.1 plasmid to generate the Bmal1-luc reporter. Oligonucleotides encoding shRNA sequences were cloned into the pLL3.7 expression plasmid (kindly provided by Luk Van Parijs, MIT) (33Rubinson D.A. Dillon C.P. Kwiatkowski A.V. Sievers C. Yang L.

Cell. 1998; 93: 929-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar). The medium was then replaced with serum-free medium containing 0.1 mm luciferin. Luciferase activity was recorded in real time by counting each culture for 1 min, at 15-min intervals, using a photomultiplier tube assembly (LM2400, Hamamatsu) that was housed within an incubator maintained at 37 °C with 95% air/5% CO2.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONmEZH2 Is a Component of the CLOCK·BMAL1 Complex in Vivo—Immunoprecipitation studies revealed that mEZH2 is present within clock-relevant protein complexes throughout the circadian cycle (Fig. 1). mEZH2 interaction with clock proteins was examined by incubating liver nuclear extracts with CLOCK, BMAL1, or EZH2 antisera and probing the immune complexes for interactions by Western blot analysis. These studies focused on circadian times (CT) before (CT 06 and 09) and during (CT 15 and 18) the expected peaks in negative feedback of the circadian clockwork in the liver (3Lee C. Etchegaray J.-P. Cagampang F.R. Loudon A.S. Reppert S.M. Cell. 2001; 107: 855-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitated CLOCK was most abundant at CT 18 (Fig. 1A), as described previously (3Lee C. Etchegaray J.-P. Cagampang F.R. Loudon A.S. Reppert S.M. Cell. 2001; 107: 855-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). BMAL1 and mEZH2 co-purified with CLOCK at all times examined. The negative circadian clock regulators mPER1, mPER2, mCRY1, and mCRY2 co-purified with CLOCK chiefly at CT 18, consistent with the roles of the mPER and mCRY proteins in negative transcriptional regulation (3Lee C. Etchegaray J.-P. Cagampang F.R. Loudon A.S. Reppert S.M. Cell. 2001; 107: 855-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitated BMAL1 was also most abundant in the nucleus at CT 15 and 18 and co-purified the other proteins examined, including mEZH2, in a pattern similar to that found in CLOCK immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1B). mEZH2 co-precipitated CLOCK and BMAL1 at the four times examined (Fig. 1C), while mEZH2 co-precipitated mCRY1 at CT 15 and 18. mEZH2 association with CLOCK or BMAL1 did not exhibit a prominent circadian variation, as its association was relatively constant over the circadian cycle, suggesting a non-oscillatory pattern of H3K27 methylation on CLOCK·BMAL1-regulated promoters.Recruitment of mEZH2 and the Methylation of H3K27 at the mPer1 and mPer2 Promoters—We next determined whether mEZH2 is bound to the mPer1 and mPer2 promoters and whether the binding correlates with the methylation of H3K27, as mEZH2 primarily methylates H3 at lysine 27 (22Cao R. Zhang Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 23Gil J. Bernard D. Peters G. DNA Cell Biol. 2005; 24: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This was examined in liver nuclei using formaldehyde-cross-linked ChIP, followed by qPCR analysis of the chromatin complexes. The mPer1 and mPer2 promoters were evaluated because their protein products are rate-limiting for negative feedback and for perpetuating the clockwork oscillation (3Lee C. Etchegaray J.-P. Cagampang F.R. Loudon A.S. Reppert S.M. Cell. 2001; 107: 855-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar).As a positive control, we found rhythmic binding of pol II to each promoter (Fig. 2A), which is synchronous with the circadian rhythm in steady state RNA levels of mPer1 and mPer2, as described previously (16Etchegaray J.-P. Lee C. Wade P.A. Reppert S.M. Nature. 2003; 421: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). mEZH2 binding to each promoter did not vary over time (p > 0.05, one-way analysis of variance). This is consistent with the co-precipitation of mEZH2 with the CLOCK·BMAL1 complex throughout the circadian cycle (see Fig. 1). We then examined the di- and trimethylation patterns of H3K27 on the mPer1 and mPer2 promoters, as both states are associated with repressive histone methylation (32Peters A.H. Kubicek S. Mechtler K. O'Sullivan R.J. Derijck A.A. Perez-Burgos L. Kohlmaier A. Opravil S. Tachibana M. Shinkai Y. Martens J.H. Jenuwein T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1577-1589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). The di- and trimethylation patterns of H3K27 exhibited a significant, but shallow, circadian variation on the mPer1 promoter (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2A); the methylation state rhythms were synchronous, but antiphase to the rhythm in pol II binding, suggesting involvement of H3K27 methylation in transcriptional repression of the clockwork. There were no significant circadian variations in the di- or trimethylation patterns of H3K27 on the mPer2 promoter, however. These patterns of di- and trimethylation of H3K27 are consistent with the apparent non-rhythmic promoter recruitment of mEZH2 (Fig. 2A) and the co-precipitation of mEZH2 with CLOCK·BMAL1 (Fig. 1).FIGURE 2mEZH2 is bound to the mPer1 and mPer2 promoters and is associated with the di- and trimethylation of H3K27. A, mPer1 and mPer2 promoter profiles. Nuclei fractions were purified from liver tissues collected at the circadian times indicated and used for ChIP. The top graph shows location of primers. The bottom four graphs show quantitative PCR values for pol II binding, EZH2 binding, dimethyl-H3K27, and trimethyl-H3K27. The data are plotted relative to the mean value (1.0) for each antibody. Each value is the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. p values were calculated using one-way analysis of variance. B, RNAi-mediated knockdown of endogenous mEZH2. NIH 3T3 cells were infected with a lentivirus-based construct expressing shRNA sequences targeting mEzh2, and protein expression was assessed by Western blot analysis. The graph shows the quantification of mEzh2 knockdown by each shRNA lentivirus construct. Band intensities were analyzed by densitometry and normalized to those of α-Catenin. Values are mean ± S.E. of three experiments. The targeted sequences are: mEzh2-shRNAi-A, 5′-AAGCACAATGCAACACCAA-3′; mEzh2-shRNAi-B, 5′-GCTTTGGACAACAAGCCTT-3′; mEzh2-shRNAi-C, 5′-AATGCTCTTGGTCAATATA-3′. C, effect of shRNA lentilvirus targeting constructs on the recruitment of mEZH2 to the mPer1 and mPer2 promoters analyzed by ChIP according to the procedure described by Cao and Zhang (34Cao R. Zhang Y. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 57-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). D, effect of shRNA lentivirus targeting constructs on the trimethylation of H3K27 on the mPer1 and mPer2 promoters. ChIP experiments were performed as described for C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To provide a more direct link between mEZH2 and the methylation of H3K27 on clock gene promoters, we analyzed mEZH2 binding to the mPer1 and mPer2 promoters in NIH 3T3 cells using RNAi. We first evaluated the ability of lentivirus-mediated expression of three shRNA constructs to reduce mEZH2 expression (supplemental Fig. S1). Two of the shRNA sequences, mEzh2-shRNA-A and mEzh2-shRNA-B, decreased endogenous mEZH2 levels by 70%, while the third sequence (mEzh2-shRNA-C) was without effect (Fig. 2B); similar dose-dependent reduction in mEZH2 was found using siRNA constructs (supplemental Fig. S2). We then showed by ChIP and qPCR that the lentivirus-mediated RNAi knockdown of mEZH2 levels caused a corresponding decrease (∼70%; p < 0.01) in mEZH2 binding and trimethyl-H3K27 levels at both the mPer1 and mPer2 promoters (Fig. 2, C and D). These data are consistent with the notion that mEZH2 bound to the clock gene promoters methylates H3K27.EZH2 Enhances mCRY-mediated Transcription Repression— As the methylation of H3K27 is associated with transcriptional repression in other systems (22Cao R.

This was evaluated using a luciferase reporter-based system to assay CLOCK·BMAL1-mediated transcription from the mPer1 or mPer2 promoters in cultured HeLa cells.Study of the mPer1 promoter showed that human EZH2 (hEZH2) overexpression enhanced the dose-dependent transcriptional repression by mCRY1 (Fig. 3A, red bars) using very low concentrations of mCRY1 that at their highest level have a small (<20%) repressive effect in the absence of hEZH2 (Fig. 3A, lanes 3-6). Furthermore, a mutation in the histone methyltransferase domain of hEZH2 (ΔhEZH2) (41Kuzmichev A. Nishioka K. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2893-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar) impaired its ability to enhance mCRY1-mediated transcription repression in cell culture (Fig. 3A, green bars). When mEZH1, a structural homolog of EZH2 that is not a component of the PRC2 (22Cao R. Zhang Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar) was overexpressed in cell culture, it was unable to enhance mCRY1-mediated transcriptional repression (Fig. 3A, lanes 7-10), showing the specificity of EZH2 enhancement. Similar responses were found in experiments using mCRY2 and the mPer1 promoter (supplemental Fig. S3A). The mCRY1-mediated transcription repression was also enhanced by hEZH2, but not mEZH1 or ΔhEZH2, in experiments using the mPer2 promoter (supplemental Fig. S3B). Taken together, these data support a role for EZH2 in the negative limb of the circadian clock mechanism by augmenting mCRY-mediated transcription repression.FIGURE 3mEZH2 is essential for mCRY-mediated transcriptional repression in cell culture. A, mEZH2 overexpression. HeLa cells were co-transfected with mPer1 reporter (25 ng) in the presence (+) or absence (-) of expression plasmids (100 ng of CLOCK and BMAL1; 400 ng of mEZH1, hEZH2, and ΔhEZH2). Increasing concentrations of the mCRY1 plasmid were transfected: 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.5 ng. Each value is the mean ± S.E. of three replicates. The results shown are representative of three independent experiments. B, effect of EZH2-RNAi-mediated knockdown on the expression of mPer2 reporter.

Phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α)atSer51 is a molecular signal that inhibits translation in response to activation of any of four diverse eIF2α stress kinases. We used gene targeting to replace the wild-type Ser51 allele with an Ala in the eIF2α gene to test the hypothesis that translational control through eIF2α phosphorylation is a central death stimulus in eukaryotic cells. Homozygous eIF2α mutant mouse embryo fibroblasts were resistant to the apoptotic effects of dsRNA, tumor necrosis factor-α, and serum deprivation. TNFα treatment induced eIF2α phosphorylation and activation of caspase 3 primarily through the dsRNA-activated eIF2α kinase PKR. In addition, expression of a phospho-mimetic Ser51 to Asp mutant eIF2α-activated caspase 3, indicating that eIF2α phosphorylation is sufficient to induce apoptosis. The proapoptotic effects of PKR-mediated eIF2α phosphorylation contrast with the anti-apoptotic response upon activation of the PKR-related endoplasmic reticulum eIF2α kinase, PERK. Therefore, divergent fates of death and survival can be mediated through phosphorylation at the same site within eIF2α. We propose that eIF2α phosphorylation is fundamentally a death signal, yet it may promote either death or survival, depending upon coincident signaling events.

We propose that eIF2α phosphorylation is fundamentally a death signal, yet it may promote either death or survival, depending upon coincident signaling events. One of the most perplexing problems in modern biology is to understand how the cell chooses between adaptation and apoptotic demise in response to stressful insults. Because there are multiple interacting anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic signaling pathways, it is assumed that the sum of these signaling cascades dictates the final outcome. When one pathway becomes predominant, a delicate balance is perturbed and either an adaptive or a lethal response ensues. Advances in our knowledge of how this commitment occurs will lead to a greater understanding of cell growth and differentiation as well as the etiology of various disease states.Numerous phosphorylation events are known to regulate the overall rate of protein synthesis or translation of selective mRNAs. However, the most dominant influence is mediated through phosphorylation at Ser51 on the α-subunit of heterotrimeric eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) 3The abbreviations used are: eIF2α, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 α-subunit; PKR, protein kinase dsRNA-dependent; HRI, heme-regulated inhibitor protein kinase; GCN2, general control of nitrogen protein kinase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PERK, PKR-like ER kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; IFN, interferon; IKK, inhibitor of NF-κB kinase; TNFR1, tumor necrosis factor-α receptor 1; Act D, actinomycin D; CHX, cycloheximide; IAPs, inhibitors of apoptosis; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; UPR, unfolded protein response; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblasts; CHAPS, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA. 3The abbreviations used are: eIF2α, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 α-subunit; PKR, protein kinase dsRNA-dependent; HRI, heme-regulated inhibitor protein kinase; GCN2, general control of nitrogen protein kinase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PERK, PKR-like ER kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; IFN, interferon; IKK, inhibitor of NF-κB kinase; TNFR1, tumor necrosis factor-α receptor 1; Act D, actinomycin D; CHX, cycloheximide; IAPs, inhibitors of apoptosis; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; UPR, unfolded protein response; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblasts; CHAPS, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA.(1Dever T.E. Cell. 2002; : 108, 545-556PubMed Google Scholar). eIF2 is required to deliver MettRNAi to the 40 S ribosomal subunit. Physiological conditions that induce eIF2α Ser51 phosphorylation regulate global as well as specific mRNA translation. Phosphorylation of eIF2α at Ser51 inactivates eIF2 and reduces the efficiency of AUG initiation codon recognition, thereby attenuating translation initiation. However, reduced AUG initiation codon recognition can increase the initiation efficiency at selective AUG codons, thereby altering initiation site utilization to regulate both the quantity and quality of proteins produced (2Kaufman R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 152-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).Four protein kinases phosphorylate eIF2α at Ser51 in response to different stress stimuli: 1) the dsRNA-activated protein kinase PKR is a major component of the interferonmediated antiviral response and is activated by binding to dsRNA produced during viral infection (3Kaufman R.J. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York2000: 503-528Google Scholar); 2) the general control of nitrogen metabolism kinase GCN2 responds to amino acid depletion (4Hinnebusch A. Hershey J.W. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1996: 199-244Google Scholar); 3) the heme-regulated inhibitor kinase HRI responds to heme deprivation to couple globin synthesis with available heme (5Han A.P. Yu C. Lu L. Fujiwara Y. Browne C. Chin G. Fleming M. Leboulch P. Orkin S.H. Chen J.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6909-6918Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar); and 4) the PKR-related endoplasmic reticulum (ER) kinase PERK responds to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER in a subpathway of the unfolded protein response (6Ron D. Harding H. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York2000: 547-560Google Scholar). Generally, eIF2α phosphorylation provides a fundamental mechanism to couple the rate of protein synthesis with the capacity to fold proteins under conditions of different physiological stress, such as nutrient deprivation or viral infection.Although the mechanism by which phosphorylation of eIF2α inhibits protein synthesis is well characterized, the cellular responses to eIF2α phosphorylation remain elusive. Recent studies support the idea that eIF2α phosphorylation promotes survival under conditions of oxidative stress and accumulation of unfolded proteins in the lumen of the ER (7Lu P.D. Jousse C.

In contrast, eIF2α phosphorylation was proposed to mediate apoptosis in response to PKR activation (9Hsu L.C. Park J.M. Zhang K. Luo J.L. Maeda S. Kaufman R.J. Eckmann L. Guiney D.G. Karin M.

In this study, we addressed how eIF2α phosphorylation influences the balance between survival and apoptosis upon activation of PKR.Treatment of cells with interferon and dsRNA is cytotoxic, and data support the hypothesis that this toxicity is mediated through PKR activation and induction of apoptosis (13Lengyel P.

Although a number of different signal transduction and transcriptional programs are influenced through PKR activation (for review see Ref. 14Barber G.N. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the most well characterized PKR substrate is eIF2α.

These studies provide compelling evidence for an anti-proliferative effect of PKR-mediated eIF2α phosphorylation in growth inhibition. However, the interpretation of these results is confounded because of the diverse effects that PKR activation has on multiple stress signaling pathways. Therefore, to date there is no direct evidence to support the hypothesis that eIF2α phosphorylation is necessary and/or sufficient for apoptosis.We propose that PKR activation with subsequent eIF2α phosphorylation is a primary mechanism that 1) inhibits initiation of protein synthesis, and 2) contributes to apoptosis in response to a variety of physiological and environmental stimuli. To test this hypothesis, we have studied apoptosis induced by dsRNA, TNFα, or serum deprivation in cells that harbor a homozygous S51A knock-in mutation at the phosphorylation site in eIF2α (23Scheuner D. Song B. McEwen E. Liu C. Laybutt R. Gillespie P. Saunders T. Bonner-Weir S. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1165-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). Here, we show that apoptosis induced by TNFα, the interferon pathway, and serum deprivation requires PKR-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2α. In addition, expression of a Ser51 to Asp phospho-mimetic mutant of eIF2α was sufficient to activate caspase 3 in the absence of any apoptosis-inducing stimuli. The results demonstrate that translational inhibition through eIF2α phosphorylation contributes to and can be sufficient to activate an apoptotic response.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmid DNA Transfection—The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cDNA cloned in pCDNA3 was kindly provided by Dr. M. Keifer, (LXR Biotechnologies). The eIF2α expression vectors were previously described (24Wu S. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1756-1763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Transfection of eIF2α expression plasmids into HeLa cells was performed as described (25Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4809) Google Scholar). After transfection, the cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified essential medium (DMEM) and incubated at 5% CO2 for 2 days in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum-containing antibiotics. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), harvested using Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) with complete protease inhibitors (Roche), and incubated on ice for 15 min followed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was collected, and protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar).In Vitro Transcription and Translation of PARP—In vitro transcription and translation of PARP was performed in the presence of [35S]methionine/cysteine (Redivue PRO-MIX, Amersham Biosciences.) using the TnT kit (Promega Biotech) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cleavage of in vitro translated PARP was previously described (27Martin S.J. Amarante-Mendes G.P. Green D.R. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 406: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography using EN3HANCE (Dupont). Briefly, a 50-μl reaction containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, 20 μg of cell extract protein from transfected COS-1 cells, and 2 μl of in vitro translated [35S]methionine/cysteinelabeled PARP were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Then, 25 μl of 3× SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to each sample followed by heating at 90 °C for 5 min. The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. After electrophoresis, the gels were fixed, soaked for 45 min in EN3HANCE (Dupont), dried, and subjected to autoradiography. ImageJ (Version 1.31 for Mac OS X, NIH) was used to quantitate band intensities.Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts—MEFs from wild-type, eIF2α S51A mutant, Hri-/-, and Pkr-/- 14.5 day embryos were prepared from breeding heterozygous mutant mice as previously described (23Scheuner D.

The eIF2α Ser51 phosphospecific antibody was obtained from BioSource (Camarillo, CA) and PKR antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Bryan Williams (Cleveland Clinic). Phosphospecific PKR antibody (3075) and PKR antibody (3072), (Fig. 3, E and F, supplemental Fig. S2), were obtained from Cell Signaling. The antibody that recognizes total eIF2α was previously described (23Scheuner D. Song B. McEwen E. Liu C. Laybutt R. Gillespie P. Saunders T. Bonner-Weir S. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1165-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). Anti-TNFR1 antibody (SC-8436) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. All Western blotting was performed with chemiluminescence detection and quantitation of film band intensities was performed with ImageJ (Version 1.31 for Mac OS X, NIH).Measurement of Translation Rates—MEFs were cultured as described above. After overnight culture, subconfluent cultures were treated with culture medium containing TNFα, okadaic acid (OA), or poly(rI-C) as described. Cells were washed two times with PBS and incubated in methionine/cysteine-free medium including 200 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (Redivue PRO-MIX, Amersham Biosciences) in the continued presence of the described stimulus for 15 min. Cells were washed two times with ice-cold PBS and cell lysates were prepared in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing complete protease inhibitors as described above for immunoblot analysis. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar). Trichloroacetic acid precipitation was performed by spotting samples on Whatman filter paper with subsequent washing in ice-cold 20% trichloroacetic acid, 10% trichloroacetic acid, and 100% ethanol. Filters were dried and liquid scintillation counting was performed.Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from MEFs at 12 h after cell plating using the TRIzol method (Invitrogen), and RNA was dissolved in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water containing 1 unit/μl RNase inhibitor (Roche). Reverse transcription reactions were performed with i-Script (Bio-Rad) and then diluted 25-fold with water for real-time PCR in an i-Cycler machine using 9 μl of diluted reverse transcriptase product and iQ SYBR Green Supermix in a 20-μl reaction (Bio-Rad). The amplification primers used for TNFR1 detection were forward (5′-CATCCCCAAGCAAGAGTCATG-3′) and reverse (5′-GCTACAGACGTTCACGATGC-3′) and the primers used for β-actin amplification were forward (5′-CCTCTATGCCAACACAGTGC-3′) and reverse (5′-GTACTTGCGCTCAGGAGGAG-3′).Cell Survival—Cells were cultured on 10-cm tissue culture dishes. At 24 h after plating, apoptosis was induced by treatment with culture medium containing 100 μg/ml poly(rI-C) (Amersham Biosciences) for 16-18 h or 1 ng/ml TNFα (Invitrogen) for 18-21 h including 50 ng/ml actinomycin D (Act D) (Sigma) during both incubations. Serum deprivation was performed by washing cells three times with serum-free DMEM followed by 14-23 h of incubation in DMEM containing 0.01% serum. In the morphological studies, cells were cultured on coverslips coated with 1% gelatin, treated as described, and fixed with 10% formalin (Sigma) prior to phase contrast microscopy. Cell viability was quantified by trypan blue dye exclusion. For nuclear staining, cells were plated, treated for induction of apoptosis, and then fixed with cold 70% ethanol at 4 °C for 1 h. The cells were then washed with PBS and incubated in ice-cold PBS containing 0.5 mg/ml RNase and 50 μg/ml propidium iodide for 15 min in the dark. Samples were mounted onto glass slides with ProLong Gold (Molecular Probes) and viewed using an Olympus BX51 microscope.Caspase 3 Assay—Adherent and floating cells were washed three times with PBS, collected at 1,200 × g and resuspended in 100-200 μl of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. The samples were lysed by four freeze-thaw cycles, centrifuged at 10,000 rpm, and the supernatant was collected for caspase 3 fluorometric assay using 70-80 μg of protein extracts as described by the supplier (Promega CaspACE Fluorometric Assay System, Madison, WI). Addition of the supplied caspase 3 inhibitor peptide to the cell lysates inhibited all activity (supplemental Fig. S1). A SPECTRAmax Gemini XS spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) was used with excitation, emission, and cutoff wavelengths of 368λ, 467λ, and 420λ respectively. Protein concentrations were determined using a detergent-compatible assay (Bio-Rad).IKK Assay—IKK activity was measured by an immune complex kinase assay as previously described (31DiDonato J.A.

We have prepared a cross-linked trapped p53 core domain dimer bound to decamer DNA and have determined its structure by x-ray crystallography to 2.3Å resolution. The p53 core domain subunits bind nearly symmetrically to opposite faces of the DNA in a head-to-head fashion with a loophelix motif making sequence-specific DNA contacts and bending the DNA by about 20° at the site of protein dimerization. Protein subunit interactions occur over the central DNA minor groove and involve residues from a zinc-binding region. Analysis of tumor derived p53 mutations reveals that the dimerization interface represents a third hot spot for mutation that also includes residues associated with DNA contact and protein stability. Residues associated with p53 dimer formation on DNA are poorly conserved in the p63 and p73 paralogs, possibly contributing to their functional differences. We have used the dimeric protein-DNA complex to model a dimer of p53 dimers bound to icosamer DNA that is consistent with solution bending data and suggests that p53 core domain dimer-dimer contacts are less frequently mutated in human cancer than intra-dimer contacts.

Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar) with anywhere from 0 (icosamer) to 20 base pairs between them, although an icosamer is more commonly found in vivo (8.Wei C.L. Wu Q. Vega V.B. Chiu K.P. Ng P. Zhang T. Shahab A. Yong H.C. Fu Y. Weng Z. Liu J. Zhao X.D. Chew J.L. Lee Y.L. Kuznetsov V.A. Sung W.K. Miller L.D. Lim B. Liu E.T. Yu Q. Ng H.H. Ruan Y.

While individual p53DBD subunits can interact with a pentamer sequence, lower order complexes in the presence of a icosamer sequence are not observed, demonstrating that cooperative p53DBD interactions occur on DNA (9.Balagurumoorthy P. Sakamoto H. Lewis M.S. Zambrano N. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Appella E. Harrington R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8591-8595Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 10.Wang Y.

Other studies also reveal that p53DBD exists in both a latent and active DNA-binding form that can be detected in vivo (11.Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 12.Halazonetis T.D. Kandil A.N.

This is consistent with structural studies showing that nascent p53DBD forms dimers that are incompatible with simultaneous DNA binding (14.Zhao K. Chai X. Johnston K. Clements A. Marmorstein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12120-12127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), suggesting that the p53DBD, in the context of full-length p53, changes quaternary structure for DNA binding as a dimer of dimers. The functional importance of the p53 dimer is further supported by the observation that replacement of the p53 tetramerization domain with the dimerization domain of GCN4 affords near wild type p53 tumor suppression activity in vivo (15.Pietenpol J.A.

The only molecular insights into the mode of DNA recognition by p53 were provided over a decade ago with the structure determination of the p53 core domain monomer bound to DNA (16.Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar). While this structure provided important insights into DNA recognition by p53, many questions still remain, leading to several studies aimed at assembling a p53 multimer on DNA but only resulting in several models of this complex (17.Rippin T.M.

Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar) to trap a p53DBD dimer bound to DNA for structure determination by x-ray crystallography (Fig. 1, A and B). The structure reveals the molecular details of cooperative dimeric p53 binding to DNA that involves a zinc-binding domain. A hot spot for tumor-derived mutations also maps to the dimerization region reinforcing its functional importance. Implications for DNA binding by the p63 and p73 paralogs and for DNA binding by a p53 dimer of dimers are discussed. Mouse p53 Core Domain Purification—The mouse p53 core domain was purified essentially as described previously with minor modification (14.Zhao K. Chai X. Johnston K. Clements A. Marmorstein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12120-12127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pRSET A (Invitrogen) bacterial expression vector encoding the p53DBD (residues 92-292) was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE-3). Cells were grown in LB medium at 37 °C, and when cultures reached an absorbance at 595 nm of ∼0.4-0.6, cells were induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside supplemented with 100 μm Zn(OAc)2 and grown overnight at 15 °C. Cells were isolated by centrifugation and resuspended in low salt buffer A (20 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.1, 100 mm NaCl, 10 μm ZnOAc2, and 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride). The cells were sonicated, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant containing soluble mouse p53DBD was loaded onto a SP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) ion exchange column that was washed with low salt buffer A and eluted with a 0.1-1.0 m NaCl gradient. Peak fractions containing p53DBD were pooled, concentrated, and further purified by gel filtration using a Superdex-75 preparative column (Amersham Biosciences). Peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml for storage at -80 °C until use. Preparation of DNA with a Cross-linkable Tether—The convertible nucleoside strategy (25.Xu Y. Zheng Q. Swann P.F. J. Org. Chem. 1992; 57: 3839-3845Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 26.MacMillan A.M. Verdine G.L. Tetrahedron. 1991; 47: 2603-2616Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 27.Macmillan A.M. Verdine G.L. J. Org. Chem. 1990; 55: 5931-5933Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar) was used to attach a sulfurbearing linker onto the N4 atom of cytosine 8. Synthetic DNA (5′-GCGTGAGCATGCTriTCAC-3′) bearing the triazolyl group on N4 of cytosine was obtained from Trilink Biotechnologies (San Diego, CA) containing the phenoxyacetyl protecting groups on the adenosine and guanosine bases, the isobutyrylprotecting group on the unmodified cytosines and a 5′-dimethoxytrityl group. The DNA, supplied on resin, was treated with 0.5 m cystamine HCl (Sigma) at pH 13 for approximately2hto cleave from resin. The supernatant was separated from the resin by centrifugation and then incubated at 55 °C for 18 h to remove the base protecting groups. The DNA was dialyzed in deionized water overnight using Spectrapor 2000 MWCO dialysis tubing (Spectrum Laboratories) to remove unreacted reagents, lyophilized to dryness, and redissolved in 500 μ l of deionized water. The DNA was further purified by reversephase HPLC 2The abbreviation used is: HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. using a Dynamax 300 Å Pure DNA column as described by the vendor (Varian). HPLC fractions containing DNA were dialyzed overnight in deionized water to remove residual trifluroacetic acid and acetonitrile. The resulting solid was dissolved in ∼40 μl of deionized water and quantitated by UV absorbance, and the products were confirmed by matrixassisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry yielding an observed molecular weight of 5015.30 daltons consistent with the predicted molecular mass of 5018.11 daltons. The DNA duplex was annealed by heating to 80 °C and slowly cooling to 4 °C for storage until use. Preparation of the p53DBD Dimer-DNA Complex—Duplex DNA and protein were mixed in a 1:2 molar ratio in crosslinking buffer (20 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.1, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride) to a volume of 2 ml and incubated at 21 °C for 3 h. The cross-linked protein-DNA complex was purified by fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration using a Superdex-75 preparative column. Fractions corresponding to the protein-DNA complex were capped with 40 mm methane methylthiolsulfonate and analyzed using a denaturing, non-reducing SDS-PAGE gel to confirm the homogeneity of a cross-linked p53DBD-DNA complex. Fractions containing pure complex were pooled and concentrated using a Vivaspin concentrator with a 30,000 MWCO membrane (Viva Science) to a concentration of about 7.5 μm as determined by UV absorbance and stored at -80 °C until use for crystallization. To determine the extent of nonspecific cross-linking, a C274S p53DBD mutant was prepared and incubated with duplex DNA in cross-linking buffer under identical conditions and the resulting mixture was run on a denaturing, non-reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel to confirm the absence of DNA cross-linking to the p53DBD C274S mutant. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination—Crystals were prepared using hanging drop vapor diffusion against a reservoir containing 0.2 m NH4Cl, 0.01 m CaCl2, 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 28% polyethylene glycol 4000 and appeared after 2 days, growing to a maximum size of 0.4 × 0.05 × 0.025 mm after 4-5 days. Crystals were flash-frozen in 0.2 m NH4Cl, 0.01 m CaCl2, 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 28% polyethylene glycol 4000, and 15% glycerol. Data collection was initially carried out on a Rigaku Raxis IV detector with a rotating copper anode. Phases were initially obtained at 4 Å resolution with molecular replacement using the program Molrep (28.Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4175) Google Scholar) and a human p53 core domain model bound to its cognate pentamer sequence (1TSR) as a search model, yielding a solution with a correlation coefficient of 48.1% and an Rfactor of 44.8%. Further inspection of the solution revealed that the two p53DBD-pentamer complexes were aligned to form a continuous decamer helix. In addition, Fo - Fc electron density corresponding to where the phosphates should be to connect the two pentamers was observed, although none was input into the starting model. Crystals were diffracted to a maximum useful resolution of 2.3 Å at Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source beamline F-1 and were indexed and scaled using HKL2000 (29.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar), respectively. The molecular replacement model was refined to 2.3 Å in CNS (30.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) and employed simulated annealing or minimization with NCS (relating the two halves of the homodimer complex) and DNA restraints. The NCS restraints were decreased over time and eventually dropped. Between refinement cycles, the model underwent manual rebuilds with the program Coot (31.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar) or O (32.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowen S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Toward the end of refinement, individual B-factors, two Tris molecules, and solvent molecules were added. The final model was checked for errors using a composite omit map and Procheck (33.Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Analysis of the DNA was done using the program 3DNA (34.Lu X.J. Olson W.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5108-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Figures were generated using Pymol (35.DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System.

Open table in a new tab Overall Structure of Dimeric Mouse p53DBD in Complex with DNA—Crystals of a p53 dimer bound to DNA were formed using the mouse p53DBD (residues 92-292) (Fig. 1C) and a 14-base pair duplex with 2-base overhangs containing a centered decamer sequence recognition site for a p53 dimer (Fig. 1D). The crystals formed in the space group P212121 and contain a p53DBD dimer and DNA duplex per asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the p53 monomer-DNA complex as a search model and refined to a resolution of 2.3 Å (Table 1). The structure of the p53DBD dimer bound to DNA reveals that the protein subunits bind nearly symmetrically to opposite faces of the DNA, approximately one-half turn around the DNA-helical axis apart and with each protein subunit interacting with a DNA pentamer (Fig. 1, A and B). The two p53DBD subunits form dimerization contacts over the central DNA minor groove via a zinc-binding domain. The DNA adopts B-form geometry with a bend of about 20° at the site of protein dimerization. Except for a disordered L1 loop region (residues 114-118) in each subunit of the dimer (Fig. 1C), the overall fold of the p53DBD core is similar to previously published structures of the nascent human (36.Joerger A.C.

Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1291-1296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and mouse core domains (14.Zhao K. Chai X. Johnston K. Clements A. Marmorstein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12120-12127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and the human core domain bound as a monomer to DNA (16.Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar). Briefly, the core domain contains a sandwich of antiparallel β-sheets with the H1 and H2 helices on one end of the molecule. The longer H2 helix, along with the proceeding loop, interacts with the DNA major groove of the pentamer sequence, while the shorter H1 helix, along with the preceding L2 loop and the L3 loop, ligate a zinc ion that together forms the p53DBD dimerization interface over the DNA minor groove. Thirteen or 15 of the 16 bases on each strand of the DNA are visible in the electron density map forming a 13-base pair duplex in which two of the 5′-nucleotides on one strand are flipped out at one end of the DNA helix. The ends of the DNA make protein lattice contacts and do not arrange themselves in an extended helix within the crystal lattice as is often observed in DNA-protein cocrystals. Comparison with the Monomeric Human p53DBD in Complex with DNA—Not surprisingly, a superposition of a p53DBD subunit bound to a p53 pentamer with the previously published p53 core domain monomer bound to DNA (1TSR) shows a high degree of structural similarity with root mean square deviations of 0.732 or 0.748 Å, for Cα atoms of the protein (Chains A and B, respectively) and 1.213 or 1.171 Å for all non-hydrogen atoms of the decamer sequence of DNA, (Chains C and D, respectively) (Fig. 2A). In addition, nearly identical protein-DNA interactions are observed (Fig. 2, B and C). This occurs despite the fact that the sulfur atom of Cys274 is cross-linked to the N4 atom of cytosine 8 and 8′ through a sulfur-bearing three-carbon linker that has a maximal length of 7.5 Å (23.Huang H. Harrison S.C. Verdine G.L. Biol. Chem. 2000; 7: 355-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Indeed, the two cross-linked atoms are about 3.8 Å apart, only about 0.6 Å further than the corresponding atomic distances in 1TSR, and the linker is not visible in the electron density map (Fig. 2B). These observations suggest that the tether remains flexible and accommodates native protein-DNA interactions. In particular, like in 1TSR, within the loop H2 region, Arg277 makes base specific contacts with guanosine 7 in the DNA major groove and residues Ala276, Arg277, and Arg280 (residues 280, 281, and 283 in human) make analogous DNA backbone contacts (Fig. 2C). In addition, residues Ser238 and Arg245 (residues 241 and 248 in human) from the L3 loop make interactions to the DNA minor groove. The one region that shows significant deviation in protein-DNA contacts between the p53DBD dimer-DNA complex and 1TSR is the L1 loop (Fig. 2D). In 1TSR, Lys120 from the human protein makes base-specific contacts to a purine base in the major groove (the equivalent to adenosine 2 in the p53DBD dimer-DNA structure). In the p53DBD dimer-DNA complex, residues 114-118 of the L1 loop harboring the corresponding lysine (Lys117) are disordered in both protein subunits of the complex. Interestingly, the L1 loop shows considerable flexibility in the mouse and human p53DBD domains in the absence of DNA; and in the worm p53 homologue, CEP-1, the L1 loop has recessed conformation that is not in position to make DNA contacts (38.Huyen Y. Jeffrey P.D. Derry W.B. Rothman J.H. Pavletich N.P. Stavridi E.S. Halazonetis T.D. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 1237-1243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Moreover, although mutations of other residues that contact DNA are the most frequently observed to be mutated in human cancers, the frequency of Lys120 mutations is rather low. Taken together, these data suggest that the L1 loop does not make a significant contribution to DNA binding by p53. Otherwise, this structural comparison reveals that p53 dimer formation on DNA does not significantly alter the protein-DNA contacts made by each p53 subunit. A comparison of the DNA conformation within the p53DBD dimer-DNA complex and 1TSR reveals that protein dimer binding on DNA induces a bend of about 20°, and this is in contrast to the essentially straight decamer DNA observed in 1TSR (Fig. 2E). This bend is centered around the dimerization region of the protein illustrating that dimer formation induces DNA bending. Based on this observation, we extrapolate that the p53 tetramer bound to DNA may induce a DNA bend of about 2 × 20°, or 40°, which is consistent with solution studies (9.Balagurumoorthy P. Sakamoto H. Lewis M.S. Zambrano N. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Appella E. Harrington R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8591-8595Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 18.Nagaich A.K. Zhurkin V.B. Sakamoto H. Gorin A.A. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Appella E. Harrington R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14830-14841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Interactions at the p53DBD Dimer Interface—Previously reported structural studies on the p53 core domain had noted a zinc ion that is ligated by three cysteine residues and one histidine residue from the H1 helix and L2 and L3 loops (Fig. 1, A and C). The resulting zinc-binding domain was proposed to play a role in maintaining p53 core domain stability, consistent with solution studies showing that disruption of this domain destabilized the p53 protein (39.Rainwater R. Parks D. Anderson M.E. Tegtmeyer P. Mann K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3892-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The p53DBD dimer-DNA structure reveals that this zinc-binding domain also plays a pivotal role in p53DBD dimer formation on DNA. The zinc domains of the dimer interact over the minor groove between the two DNA pentamer sites, forming a clamp-like structure over the DNA. Dimer interactions involve van der Waals, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic interactions. van der Waals interactions are made between Pro174 and His175 from the H1 helices of opposing subunits of the dimer (Fig. 3A). An intermolecular salt bridge is mediated by the NH1 atom of Arg178 and the OD1 atom of Glu177 from the H1 helices of the dimer (Fig. 3B). Additionally, the NH2 atoms of both Arg178 residues are observed at close enough distances to the NE atoms (3.31 and 3.46 Å) to participate in dipole-dipole interactions. The Arg178 salt bridge interaction with Glu177 may serve to localize the positive charge of Arg178 toward the NH1 and NH2 atoms allowing an electron pair to localize at the NE atoms, thereby creating a dipole within Arg178. Additionally, there are water-mediated (W75 and W141) hydrogen bonding interactions in the inter-dimer interface via the backbone carbonyl of Met240 from both monomers. Correlating with our finding that the H1 helix plays a particularly important role in p53DBD dimer formation on DNA, previously reported NMR studies of a human p53DBD dimer bound to DNA also observed involvement of residues in the H1 helix in dimer formation (17.Rippin T.M. Freund S.M.V. Veprintsev D.B. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 21.Klein C. Planker E. Diercks T. Kessler H. Kunkele K.P. Lang K. Hansen S. Schwaiger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49020-49027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The functional importance of the observed p53DBD dimer interactions on DNA is supported by recently reported in vitro studies. In these studies, mutation of Arg181 and His178 in human p53 (corresponding to mouse residues 175 and 178) to alanine decreases the cooperative DNA binding of p53DBD and an Arg181 mutation to Glu completely abolished DNA binding, even in the presence of a glutathione S-transferase dimerization domain fusion (22.Dehner A. Klein C. Hansen S. Muller L. Buchner J. Schwaiger M. Kessler H. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2005; 44: 5247-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition, residues that form the p53DBD dimer interface on DNA, Pro174, His175, Glu177, and Arg178 (residue numbers 177, 178, 180, and 181 in human) are found to be mutated in human cancers (Figs. 1C and 3C). These observations reinforce the importance of the observed dimer interactions for p53 function in vivo. Taken together with previous structural studies, it appears that tumor-derived p53 core domain mutations fall into three classes, those that disrupt protein stability, protein-DNA interaction, or dimer formation on DNA. The greater mutational sensitivity of the residues that make protein-DNA contacts suggests that mutation of DNA contact residues are less easily compensated for by other p53 residues. Comparison with p63 and p73 Paralogs—The DNA-binding domain of p63, a paralog and evolutionary ancestor of p53, shares ∼60% identity with the p53DBD, which includes the residues that coordinate the zinc ion and that contact DNA (40.Yang A.N.

Chem. 2001; 276: 37390-37401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Despite this similarity, the isolated p63DBD domain alone cannot bind p53 response elements, while full-length p63 can (42.Klein C. Georges G. Kunkele A.P. Huber R. Engh R.A. Hansen S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37390-37401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In contrast, introduction of a glutathione S-transferase dimerization fusion allows p63DBD to bind cooperatively to p53 response elements, showing that p63 dimerization is a key component of its DNA binding properties. Interestingly, key residues for p53DBD dimerization, His175 and Arg178, are not present in p63. Instead, p63 contains an asparagine and leucine at these positions (Fig. 3D). p73, another p53 paralog, has identical sequence with p63 in the H1 helix. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that p63 and p73 do not make the same dimer interactions as the p53DBD on DNA and propose that this may represent an important functional distinction of these p53 paralogs. It is interesting to speculate that p53DBD dimer interactions could have evolved later to enhance DNA binding ability by “fixing” the positions of the p53DBD domain relative to each other when bound to DNA. It may have been evolutionarily economical for p53 to utilize an already existing structural feature (Zn2+-binding helix) to fine tune DNA binding. Functional Consequences of p53 Dimerization States—The p53DBD dimer interface that we observe in complex with DNA has not been observed in other crystal structures of the p53DBD in the absence of DNA, suggesting that this mode of p53DBD binding is facilitated by DNA binding and is unlikely to occur in the absence of DNA. Interestingly, several other reported crystal structures of the p53DBD in the absence of DNA also show significant dimer interactions in the crystal lattice, but each of these dimers is in a conformation that is incompatible for dimeric binding on DNA (14.Zhao K. Chai X. Johnston K. Clements A. Marmorstein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12120-12127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 37.Joerger A.C. Allen M.D. Fersht A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1291-1296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). Specifically, both the DNA-free mouse p53DBD and the human p53DBD monomer bound to DNA show dimer interactions in the crystal lattice that involves the H1 helix and the flanking loops of one subunit with the S6-S7 loop of another subunit (Fig. 4B). These dimer interactions bury a total solvent-excluded surface of 996 and 1432 Å2, respectively, while the dimeric p53DBD shows a solvent excluded surface of only 595 Å2 between the two protein subunits. This dimeric arrangement of the p53 core domain places the H2 DNA recognition helices of the dimer on the same side of the DNA, as opposed to opposite sides of the DNA as observed in the p53DBD dimer bound to DNA as reported here. This observation suggests that the p53DBD may exist as DNA-binding incompetent dimers in the absence of DNA and DNA competent dimers in the presence of p53 response elements. This proposal is consistent with equilibrium sedimentation data showing that nascent mouse p53DBD forms dimers with a dissociation constant of about 2 mm (14.Zhao K. Chai X. Johnston K. Clements A. Marmorstein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12120-12127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although this concentration far exceeds the cellular p53 concentration in the cell, the local p53DBD concentration within the intact p53 tetramer may be high enough to induce dimer formation. The signal that might induce a p53DBD dimer transition from a DNA-binding incompetent to DNA-binding competent form is unknown, although DNA binding alone is likely insufficient since crystallization attempts at trapping a p53 dimer bound to DNA in the absence of cross-linking has not been successful. 3R. Marmorstein, K. Zhao, and W. C. Ho, unpublished data. Taken together, the involvement of the zinc-binding region of the p53DBD, which includes the H1 helix and the surrounding loops, in each of the p53 dimerization states observed to date argues for its pivotal role in regulating the DNA binding function of p53. This is consistent with the high degree of mutational sensitivity of this region (Figs. 1C and 3C). Model for a p53 Dimer of Dimers—All p53 response elements contain two decamer sites that are bound by a dimer of p53 dimers. Although there is variability in the number of bases separating two decamer sites in nature, most sites have no intervening bases (icosamers) (8.Wei C.L. Wu Q. Vega V.B. Chiu K.P. Ng P. Zhang T. Shahab A. Yong H.C. Fu Y. Weng Z. Liu J. Zhao X.D. Chew J.L. Lee Y.L. Kuznetsov V.A. Sung W.K. Miller L.D. Lim B. Liu E.T. Yu Q. Ng H.H. Ruan Y. Cell. 2006; 124: 207-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). Interaction between two p53DBD dimers on DNA would be distinct from the interatomic interactions within the dimer itself, since the former would involve tail to tail interactions instead of the head to head interactions observed in the DNA-bound dimer. To obtain some insights into the nature of these dimer-dimer interactions, we modeled a p53DBD dimer of dimers on an icosamer site by translating the p53DBD dimer along the DNA by 10 base pairs and used the ends of the DNA outside the decamer site for superposition (Fig. 5A). This modeling assumes a duplication of the DNA bend observed for the p53DBD dimer-DNA structure, resulting in an overall bend of about 40°, which is consistent with published reports (43.Nagaich A.K. Zhurkin V.B. Durell S.R. Jernigan R.L. Appella E. Harrington R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1875-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this bend is not continuous but, instead, is comprised of two bends that occur at the junction of each p53 core domain dimer (Fig. 5B). This modeling reveals that a dimer of p53DBD dimers can be assembled on DNA without molecular clashes (Fig. 5). The modeling also shows that additional DNA bending or protein adjustments would result in tail-to-tail dimer interactions involving the S7-S8 and L2 loops of the p53DBD. The relative paucity of tumor-derived mutations in these areas (Figs. 1C,3C,5C, and 5D), however, argues against the relative functional importance of p53 dimer-dimer interactions on DNA. This is consistent with the variability of base pair length separating p53 decamer sites that is observed in nature. Interestingly, a mapping of the frequency of tumor derived mutations onto the surface of the p53 dimer of dimers bound to DNA reveals two spines of mutational sensitivity on the top surface of the p53 dimers that extend across the dimers (Fig. 5, C and D). This highlights a potential functionally important binding surface for either another part of p53 or other p53-associated proteins that might influence the dimerization function of p53. This structure now provides a scaffold for testing this hypothesis. In summary, this studies brings us significantly closer to understanding the molecular details of how a p53 dimer of dimers assembles on DNA to help mediate its tumor suppressor function. This structure also provides new avenues for the structure-based design of small molecule compounds that may shift the equilibrium of mutated p53 to the DNA-binding competent form for tumor suppressor activity.

A prominent binding motif linking the Na,K-ATPase to intracellular signaling effectors has, however, not yet been identified. Here we report that the N-terminal tail of the Na,K-ATPase catalytic α-subunit (αNT-t) binds directly to the N terminus of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor. Three amino acid residues, LKK, conserved in most species and most α-isoforms, are essential for the binding to occur. In wild-type cells, low concentrations of ouabain trigger low frequency calcium oscillations that activate NF-κB and protect from apoptosis. All of these effects are suppressed in cells overexpressing a peptide corresponding to αNT-t but not in cells overexpressing a peptide corresponding to αNT-tΔLKK. Thus we have identified a well conserved Na,K-ATPase motif that binds to the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor and can trigger an anti-apoptotic calcium signal.

The Na,K-ATPase is an integral plasma membrane protein that establishes the electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane in all mammalian cells. Ouabain is a steroid derivative that binds specifically to Na,K-ATPase. Several recent studies suggest that the ouabain·Na,K-ATPase complex may act as a signal transducer and transcription activator (1Aizman O. Uhlen P. Lal M. Brismar H. Aperia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

These effects have been ascribed to the activation of a number of intracellular signaling pathways (for review see Refs. 9Scheiner-Bobis G. Schoner W. Nat.

Most, if not all, of these pathways involve the release of calcium (Ca2+) from intracellular stores via the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R), 4The abbreviations used are: InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; InsP3R, InsP3 receptor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RPT, rat proximal tubule; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; AI, apoptotic index; A domain, actuator domain; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling. and results from recent studies indicate that Na,K-ATPase tethers the InsP3R into a Ca2+ regulatory complex (3Miyakawa-Naito A.

The exact mechanisms by which Na,K-ATPase activates the InsP3R remains to be elucidated. Here we report that the N-terminal tail of the Na,K-ATPase catalytic α-subunit binds to the N terminus of the InsP3R. Interaction between Na,K-ATPase and InsP3R modulates the Ca2+ oscillatory signal, which serves to protect the cell from apoptosis (11Li J. Zelenin S. Aperia A. Aizman O. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 1848-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The identification of a distinct motif in the Na,K-ATPase that via protein-protein interaction transmits this signal to the InsP3R has important implications for the many vital cell functions that are regulated by ouabain·Na,K-ATPase signaling. Cells and Tissue—Two types of cells were used. COS-7 cells, a cell line derived from fetal monkey kidney, were used in most protocols. Because transformed cells are not suitable for serum deprivation-induced apoptosis, rat proximal tubule (RPT) cells in primary culture were used in these protocols. COS-7 cells were purchased from the European Collection of Cell Cultures and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. RPT cells were prepared as described previously (1Aizman O. Uhlen P. Lal M. Brismar H. Aperia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13420-13424Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Briefly, the kidneys of 20-day-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were used, and the cells were cultured in supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium on glass coverslips for 24 h. Lysates from whole brain and kidney cortex from male adolescent Sprague-Dawley rats were used in co-immunoprecipitation studies. Plasmids and Transfection—All of the plasmids were propagated in Escherichia coli strain DH5α. All of the PCR products of cDNA fragments were generated in frame using Platinum® Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and were verified by nucleotide sequencing. GFP-Na,K-ATPase α1, and GFP-Na,K-ATPaseα1ΔNT-t were prepared as described previously (3Miyakawa-Naito A. Uhlen P. Lal M. Aizman O. Mikoshiba K. Brismar H. Zelenin S. Aperia A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50355-50361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The Na,K-ATPase α2 and α3 plasmids were kind gifts from Dr. Thomas Pressly (Texas Tech University) and Dr. Jerry Lingrel (University of Cincinnati). The PCR products of the GFP cDNA fragment were subcloned into the site of HindIII of the Na,K-ATPase α2 plasmid to generate GFP-Na,K-ATPase α2 and into the site of HindIII and SacII of the Na,K-ATPase α3 plasmid to generate GFP-Na,K-ATPase α3. The PCR product of mRFP was subcloned into the site of EcoRI and EcoRV of pcDNA4/MyC-His B (Invitrogen) to generate pcDNA4-mRFP (the original mRFP cDNA was a kind gift from Dr. Roger Tsien, University of California, San Diego). Truncated cDNA fragments corresponding to different lengths of the N-terminal fragments of rat Na,K-ATPase α1 were subcloned into the site of HindIII and BamHI of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) to generate GFP-αNT-t and GFP-αNT-tΔLKK, and into the site of EcoRV and XhoI of pcDNA4-mRFP to generate mRFP-αNT-t and mRFP-αNT-tΔLKK (both of these two plasmids contain a stop codon before the XhoI site). The PCR products corresponding to different lengths of the N-terminal fragments of human Na,K-ATPase α1 or rat Na,K-ATPase α3 were subcloned into the site of HindIII and BamHI of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) to generate GFP-hαNT-t, GFP-α3NT-t, and GFP-α3NT-tΔLKK (Table 1).TABLE 1Description of the plasmids used in this studyAbbreviationSequenceProtein and subtypeαNT-t6-37Na,K-ATPase α1αNT-tΔLKK6-34Na,K-ATPase α1Na,K-ATPaseα1ΔNT-t37-1023Na,K-ATPase α1Na,K-ATPaseα16-1023Na,K-ATPase α1hαNT-t6-37Na,K-ATPase α1 (human)α3NT-t1-27Na,K-ATPase α3α3NT-tΔLKK1-24Na,K-ATPase α3MGKGV-αNT-t1-37Na,K-ATPase α1MGKGV-α3NT-tα1: 1-5 + α3: 1-27Na,K-ATPase α1 and α3InsP3R(1-225)1-225InsP3R1InsP3R(1-343)1-343InsP3R1InsP3R(1-604)1-604InsP3R1InsP3R(226-604)226-604InsP3R1 Open table in a new tab The PCR products corresponding to the suppressor domain and the InsP3-binding domain (amino acids 1-604 of mouse InsP3R type-1) were subcloned into the site of BamHI and EcoRI of pGEX-KG (12Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar) to generate GST-InsP3R (1-604) and into BamHI and XhoI of pET-23a(+) (Novagen) to generate InsP3R (1-604)-His. GST-InsP3R (1-225), GST-InsP3R (1-343), and GST-InsP3R (226-604) were generated as previously described (13Ando H. Mizutani A. Matsu-ura T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10602-10612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected COS-7 cells were harvested for binding assay or used for Ca2+ imaging experiments 1-2 days after transfection. Purification of Recombinant Proteins and GST Pulldown Assays—The plasmids encoding GST or His fusion proteins were transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Stratagene). Harvested E. coli expressed with GST fusion proteins or GST alone was sonicated in buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Triton X-100). Adult whole rat brains were homogenized in buffer A. Harvested E. coli expressed with InsP3R (1-604)-His was sonicated in buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Triton X-100). The lysates of E. coli or rat brains were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were then subjected to another centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants from the second centrifugation were used for pulldown binding assay. The strategy for GST pulldown assay was modified from previous description (14Zhang S. Mizutani A. Hisatsune C. Higo T. Bannai H. Nakayama T. Hattori M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4048-4056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For each reaction, 200 μg of protein of solubilized lysates of E. coli expressed with GST fusion proteins or GST alone were incubated with 30 μl of 1:1 slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 1 h and then washed with Buffer C (4 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) three times. The spun down complexes of glutathione-Sepharose 4B, including the fusion proteins, were incubated with 200 μg of protein of solubilized lysates of rat brain for 2 h or overnight at 4 °C. The complexes were then spun down and washed with Buffer D (Buffer C + 50 mm NaCl) three times. The proteins were eluted by boiling in 60 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 3 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were probed with anti-GFP antibody or anti-Na,K-ATPase α1 antibody. For in vitro binding assays, GST or GST-αNT-t were eluted with reduced glutathione (Sigma). InsP3R (1-604)-His was purified with ProBond resin (Invitrogen). All three proteins were dialyzed in Buffer C. 15 μg of dialyzed GST, GST-αNT-t were incubated with 5-15 μg of InsP3R (1-604)-His for 2 h or overnight at 4 °C. The total volume for each reaction was 1 ml. The complexes were spun down and washed with Buffer D three times and then subjected to SDS-PAGE for Western blotting assay or Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Calcium Imaging and Power Spectrum Analysis—COS-7 cells were loaded with 5 μm Fura2/AM (Molecular Probes) at room temperature for 1 h. Calcium measurements were performed at ∼37 °C in a heated chamber (QE-1; Warner Instruments) with a cooled CCD camera (ORCA-ERG; Hamamatsu) mounted on an upright microscope (Axioskop 2 FS; Zeiss) with a40 × 0.8 NA water dipping lens. Excitation at 340 and 380 nm was performed with a monochromator (Polychrome IV; TILL Photonics). All of the devices were controlled, and the data were analyzed with computer software (MetaFluor; Molecular Devices). Sampling frequencies were between 0.05 and 0.1 Hz. All of the experiments were performed in physiological buffer (100 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1.1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm d-glucose, pH 7.4). To determine the number of oscillating cells, an oscillating cell was defined as a cell that displayed at least two well defined Ca2+ peaks, where each peak value was an increase in Ca2+ of more than 10% compared with the base line. Spectral analysis of Ca2+ oscillations was performed with MATLAB software as described previously (15Uhlen P. Sci. STKE 2004. 2004; : P115Google Scholar). The red fluorescent protein mRFP was used, because its spectral properties are better in combination with Fura2/AM compared with GFP. The Ca2+ imaging studies were preformed by an investigator blind to the transfection protocol. Detection and Quantification of Apoptotic Cells (TUNEL Staining)—We have previously found that ouabain protects from serum deprivation-induced apoptosis, but not from apoptosis triggered by 0.5 μm staurosporin (11Li J. Zelenin S. Aperia A. Aizman O. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 1848-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Because cell lines are resistant to serum deprivation-induced apoptosis, we used RPT cells in primary culture in this protocol. This cell type has previously been shown to respond to ouabain with Ca2+ oscillations and downstream NF-κB activation (1Aizman O. Uhlen P. Lal M. Brismar H. Aperia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13420-13424Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 3Miyakawa-Naito A. Uhlen P. Lal M. Aizman O. Mikoshiba K. Brismar H. Zelenin S. Aperia A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50355-50361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured with 10 or 0.2% fetal bovine serum for 24 h and treated with 10 nm ouabain. To obtain a semiquantitative estimation of the level of apoptosis, the TUNEL assay (ApopTag Red in situ apoptosis detection kit; Chemicon Int.) was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. The nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; 1.5 μg/ml). The cells were examined in a Leica TCS SP inverted confocal scanning laser microscope using a 40×/1.4 N.A. oilimmersion objective. ApopTag Red fluorescence was excited at 543 nm and detected with a 560-620-nm band pass filter. DAPI-stained cells were viewed with UV light. The apoptotic index (AI), i.e. number of apoptotic cells/total number of cells counted × 100, was determined by counting the number of ApopTag-positive cells over total number of cells, determined by DAPI staining. In each preparation 8-10 randomly selected areas were examined, and in each area 100-200 DAPI-stained cells were counted. Approximately 1000 DAPI-stained cells were counted in each preparation. NF-κB Activity Assay—NF-κB translocation to nucleus was used as an index of NF-κB activation and studied with immunocytochemistry. Immunocytochemistry was performed as previously described (1Aizman O. Uhlen P. Lal M. Brismar H. Aperia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13420-13424Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Rubidium Uptake—The dose-dependent effect of ouabain on Na,K-ATPase activity was determined by measuring ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake as described previously (16Cheng X.J. Fisone G. Aizman O. Aizman R. Levenson R. Greengard P. Aperia A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C893-C901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies and Chemicals—The following antibodies and chemicals were purchased: mouse anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (Clontech), anti-Na,K-ATPase α1 monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology), mouse anti-His monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen), Rabbit anti-NF-κB polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ouabain and bradykinin (Sigma), Fura2/AM (Invitrogen), and thapsigargin (Calbiochem). Statistics—The data are presented as the means ± S.E. Student's t test and one-way analysis of variance with a Bonferroni post hoc test was used, and significance was accepted at p < 0.05. Na,K-ATPase α1, α2, and α3-Subunits Interact with the N Terminus of the InsP3R—The InsP3R is a protein of 2749 residues. There are three functionally distinct regions within the InsP3R, the long N-terminal portion of the receptor, the channel-forming region, and the short C-terminal regulatory segment (Fig. 1A). To screen for an interaction between the Na,K-ATPase and the InsP3R, we first incubated glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused proteins encoding for various lengths of the N terminus of the InsP3R type 1 with lysates from whole rat brain or with lysates from COS-7 cells transfected with GFP-fused rat Na,K-ATPase α-subunits. Consistent interaction was found between the Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit and peptide fragments corresponding to residues 1-604 of InsP3R type 1. This fragment of InsP3R type 1 consists of a suppressor domain and an InsP3-binding domain (17Bosanac I. Yamazaki H. Matsu-Ura T. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Ikura M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 193-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and shares high homology with other subtypes of InsP3R. Because the main goal of this study was to identify an InsP3R-binding site in the Na,K-ATPase molecule, all of the subsequent studies were performed with peptide fragments corresponding to various lengths of the 1-604 portion of the InsP3R type 1. As shown in Fig. 1, GST fusion proteins encoding for various lengths of InsP3R (1-604) were incubated with lysates of whole rat brain and rat kidney cortex and pulled down with GSH-Sepharose (Fig. 1B). GST-InsP3R (1-604) and GST-InsP3R (1-343), which encodes the suppressor domain and the first 118 residues of the InsP3-binding domain, did pull down Na,K-ATPase α1 from lysates of whole rat brain and rat kidney cortex, whereas GST-InsP3R (1-225), which encodes only the suppressor domain, and GST-InsP3R (226-604), which encodes only the InsP3-binding domain, did not (Fig. 1B). To examine whether InsP3R (1-604) also assembles with other Na,K-ATPase α-isoforms, the GST fusion proteins were incubated with lysates of COS-7 cells transfected with GFP-fused rat Na,K-ATPase α1, α2, and α3. As shown in Fig. 1C, GST-InsP3R (1-343) and GST-InsP3R (1-604) were found to assemble with GFP-Na,K-ATPase α1, α2, and α3. GST-InsP3R (1-225), GST-InsP3R (226-604) and GST alone did not assemble with any of the α-isoforms. The N-terminal Tail of Na,K-ATPase α-Subunit Is Responsible for Binding to InsP3R (1-604)—Because it was suggested from previous studies that the N-terminal tail of the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit plays an important role for Na,K-ATPase signaling (3Miyakawa-Naito A. Uhlen P. Lal M. Aizman O. Mikoshiba K. Brismar H. Zelenin S. Aperia A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50355-50361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 4Yuan Z. Cai T. Tian J. Ivanov A.V. Giovannucci D.R. Xie Z. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4034-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), we examined whether GST-InsP3R (1-604) would assemble with a truncated form of the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit, where the first 32 residues of the N-terminal tail had been deleted (GFP-Na,K-ATPaseα1ΔNT-t) and/or with a peptide fragment, corresponding to the N-terminal tail of Na,K-ATPase α1 (GFP-αNT-t) (Fig. 2, A and B). These constructs were expressed in COS-7 cells, and pulldown assays were performed. As shown in Fig. 2C, GST-InsP3R (1-604) assembled with GFP-αNT-t. In contrast, GST-InsP3R (1-604) did not assemble with GFP-Na,K-ATPaseα1ΔNT-t. The Well Conserved Amino Acid Residues LKK in the N-terminal Tail of Na,K-ATPase α-Subunit Are Essential for the Interaction with InsP3R—Because the studies shown in Fig. 1C demonstrated that GST-InsP3R (1-604) also assembled with the Na,K-ATPase α2- and α3-isoforms, we next examined the homology of the N-terminal tail. The N-terminal tail of different isoforms and species displayed little homology, except for 3 amino acid residues, LKK, which are conserved in all of the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit isoforms examined (Fig. 3A). To study the role of the LKK residues for the Na,K-ATPase-InsP3R interaction, a peptide fragment corresponding to the N-terminal tail of the rat Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit in which the LKK residues were deleted was generated (GFP-αNT-tΔLKK). This fragment did not assemble with GST-InsP3R (1-604) (Fig. 3, B and C). In contrast, a peptide fragment corresponding to the human α1 N-terminal tail, which has little homology with the rat α1 N-terminal tail, except for the LKK motif, did assemble with GST-InsP3R (1-604) (Fig. 3, D and E). To further examine the role of the conserved LKK for the interaction, two different lengths of the N-terminal tail of rat Na,K-ATPase α3-subunit, with or without the conserved LKK, were constructed and used for pulldown assay. As shown in Fig. 3 (F and G), the fragment of the N-terminal tail of rat Na,K-ATPase α3-subunit with the conserved LKK did assemble with GST-InsP3R (1-604), whereas the fragment of the N-terminal tail of rat Na,K-ATPase α3-subunit lacking the conserved LKK did not. To determine whether the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit can bind directly to the InsP3R (1-604), InsP3R (1-604) was tagged with His (InsP3R (1-604)-His) (Fig. 4A) and expressed in E. coli. Purified InsP3R (1-604)-His was incubated with purified GST-αNT-t and then precipitated with GSH-Sepharose. As depicted in Fig. 4 (B and C), GST-αNT-t did bind to InsP3R (1-604)-His. The First Five Residues, Which Are Not Present in the Mature Na,K-ATPase α1-Subunit Protein, May Block Na,K-ATPase-InsP3R Interaction—The first five residues of rat Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit, MGKGV, are considered to be absent in the mature protein (18Pressley T.A. Allen J.C. Clarke C.H. Odebunmi T. Higham S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C825-C832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological significance of these five residues is unknown. To examine whether these five residues have an effect on Na,K-ATPase-InsP3R interaction, GFP-MGKGV-αNT-t were expressed in COS-7 cells, and pulldown assays were performed. The GFP fusion prevents the cleavage of MGKGV (18Pressley T.A. Allen J.C. Clarke C.H. Odebunmi T. Higham S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C825-C832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 (A and B), GFP-MGKGV-αNT-t did not assemble with GST-InsP3R (1-604), suggesting that these five residues of the Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit may inhibit the Na,K-ATPase-InsP3R interaction. To further test this possibility, we recombined these first five residues of the α1-subunit with the N-terminal tail of the α3-subunit. GFP-MGKGV-α3NT-t expressed in COS-7 cells was subjected to GST-InsP3R (1-604) for pulldown assay. As shown in Fig. 5 (C and D), GFP-MGKGV-α3NT-t did not assemble with GST-InsP3R (1-604). These findings indicate that these five amino acid residues of the Na,K-ATPase block the Na,K-ATPase-InsP3R interaction and interfere with the signaling function of Na,K-ATPase. Thus it will be an important topic for further studies to identify the mechanisms that regulate the translational modification of the Na,K-ATPase α1. Role of the Na,K-ATPase N Terminus for Ouabain-induced Ca2+ Oscillations—Next we examined the impact of the Na,K-ATPase N terminus for the functional interaction between Na,K-ATPase and the InsP3R. We have previously shown that ouabain enhances the interaction between Na,K-ATPase and the InsP3R and triggers an oscillatory Ca2+ response that is dependent on release of Ca2+ via the InsP3R. Those studies were performed mainly on rat renal cells in primary culture. A similar oscillatory response to ouabain is also observed in COS-7 cells (Fig. 6, A and B). The majority of ouabain-exposed cells displayed regular Ca2+ oscillations with an initial stable base line. The Ca2+ oscillations were analyzed using power spectral analysis and revealed an oscillatory period of 3.9 ± 0.2 min for 0.2 μm ouabain (66 cells from seven experiments) and 3.3 ± 0.1 min for 1 μm ouabain (95 cells from nine experiments) treatment (Fig. 6, C and D). The number of cells responding with Ca2+ oscillations increased dose-dependently with increasing ouabain concentration (Fig. 6E, open circles). The threshold concentration of ouabain required for triggering Ca2+ oscillations gave less than 10% inhibition of Rb+ uptake, used as an index of Na,K-ATPase dependent ion flux (Fig. 6E, filled circles). The off rate for ouabain to Na,K-ATPase is much slower than the on rate (19Kawamura A. Abrell L.M. Maggiali F. Berova N. Nakanishi K. Labutti J. Magil S. Haupert Jr., G.T. Hamlyn J.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5835-5844Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and if cells were exposed to 10-50 nm ouabain for several hours, Ca2+ oscillations were observed in 5-30% of COS-7 cells. Ouabain failed to induce Ca2+ oscillations in cells that had been treated with thapsigargin to deplete the endoplasmic stores of Ca2+ (Fig. 6F). The ouabain response was then studied in cells transfected with truncated form of the α-subunit, where the first 32 amino acid residues were deleted. The truncated α-subunit was fused to GFP. The number of GFP-positive cells responding with Ca2+ oscillations was significantly lower than the number of GFP-negative cells responding to ouabain (44.8 ± 7.9 and 70.1 ± 6.7%, respectively) (Fig. 6G). GFP-positive and GFP-negative cells on the same plate were compared. Cells expressing GFP alone showed a similar ouabain response as GFP-negative cells (data not shown). To study whether overexpression of αNT-t would result in a constitutive activation of InsP3R, leading to lower Ca2+ levels in ER, the Ca2+ content in ER was evaluated by estimating the release of Ca2+ from the ER following inhibition of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase by thapsigargin. As shown in Fig. 7A, the Ca2+ release from the ER was similar in cells overexpressing mRFP-αNT-t and mRFP-αNT-tΔLKK. Thereafter we examined whether the αNT-t peptide might act as an inhibitor of ouabain-induced Ca2+ oscillations. Overexpression of the fusion peptide mRFP-αNT-t resulted in a robust decline of the number of cells responding to 0.2 μm ouabain (37.3 ± 8.0% for mRFP-positive cells and 63.2 ± 4.7% for mRFP-negative cells) (Fig. 7B). In contrast, the number of ouabain responding cells was unaltered following overexpression of mRFP-αNT-tΔLKK (73.5 ± 7.9% for mRFP-positive cells and 73.6 ± 4.8% for mRFP-negative cells). To test whether the αNT-t peptide might act as an inhibitor of InsP3 activation of the InsP3R Ca2+ release channel, cells were exposed to bradykinin to stimulate the generation of endogenous InsP3. The number of responding cells (Fig. 7C) as well as the amplitude and full duration at half maximum of the intracellular Ca2+ peak (data not shown) was similar in wild-type cells and cells overexpressing mRFP-αNT-t and mRFP-αNT-tΔLKK. Ouabain Protection from Serum Deprivation-induced Apoptosis and Activation of NF-κB Is Mediated via the Na,K-ATPase α1-Subunit N-terminal Tail—Slow Ca2+ oscillations have been shown to activate the Ca2+-dependent transcription factor NF-κB (20Dolmetsch R.E. Xu K. Lewis R.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 933-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar). NF-κB has in many systems an anti-apoptotic effect (21Mogi M. Ozeki N. Nakamura H. Togari A. Bone. 2004; 35: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 22Nakanishi C. Toi M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar), and we have, in a recently completed study, shown that noninhibitory doses of ouabain protect from serum deprivation-induced apoptosis (11Li J. Zelenin S. Aperia A. Aizman O. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 1848-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Here we have examined whether expression of the αNT-t may attenuate the ouabain-induced protection from apoptosis. Because cell lines are fairly independent of growth factors, we used RPT cells in primary culture to provoke serum deprivation-induced apoptosis. This cell type has previously been shown to respond to low doses of ouabain with Ca2+ oscillations (3Miyakawa-Naito A. Uhlen P. Lal M. Aizman O. Mikoshiba K. Brismar H. Zelenin S. Aperia A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50355-50361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). RPT cells expressing GFP-αNT-t, GFP-αNT-tΔLKK, or GFP only were incubated with 10 nm ouabain for 24 h. NF-κB activation was estimated by measuring the ratio of NF-κB nuclear to cytosolic signal. In cells expressing GFP only or GFP-αNT-tΔLKK, exposure to ouabain caused a significant increase in NF-κB nuclear to cytosolic ratio (154.8 ± 3.0% and 129.3 ± 7.3%, respectively). In contrast, the ratio was not affected by ouabain in cells expressing GFP-αNT-t (93.0 ± 4.1%). To explore the ouabain-induced protection from apoptosis, the AI was measured. In each protocol AI was measured from more than 1000 cells. During control conditions AI ranges between 1 and 4%. In serum-deprived cells, the AI ranged between 10 and 15%. Ouabain failed to protect from serum deprivation-induced apoptosis in R"

However, many chemoreceptor genes, including bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs), show only marginal cell surface expression. Usually, these problems are circumvented by using chimeric receptors consisting of “export tags” and the receptor sequence itself. It seems likely that chemoreceptor cells express factors for cell surface targeting of native receptor molecules in vivo. For TAS2Rs, however, such factors are still unknown. The present study investigates the influence of RTP and REEP proteins on the functional expression of human TAS2Rs in heterologous cells. We expressed hTAS2Rs in HEK 293T cells and observed dramatic differences in responsiveness to agonist stimulation. By immunocytochemistry we show accumulation of the bitter β-glucopyranoside receptor hTAS2R16 in the Golgi compartment. Coexpression of RTP and REEP proteins changed the responses of some hTAS2Rs upon agonist stimulation, which is likely due to efficient cell surface localization as demonstrated by cell surface biotinylation experiments. The coimmunoprecipitation of hTAS2R16 and RTP3 or RTP4 suggests that the mechanism by which these cofactors influence hTAS2R16 function might involve direct protein-protein interaction. Finally, expression analyses demonstrate RTP and REEP gene expression in human circumvallate papillae and testis, both of which are sites of TAS2R gene expression.

Humans can detect and distinguish the five basic taste qualities salty, sour, sweet, umami, and bitter (1.Lindemann B. Nature. 2001; 413: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Gustatory stimuli are detected by taste receptor cells, which are organized in groups of 60-100 cells forming a taste bud. One to multiple taste buds are embedded within morphologically different types of taste papillae distributed over the tongue surface. Each taste bud exhibits a single apical porus exposing the microvilli of the receptor cells to the oral cavity (2.Miller I.J.J. Doty R.L. Handbook of Olfaction and Gustation. Dekker, New York1995: 521-547Google Scholar). The human TAS2R gene family of bitter receptors belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily and consists of ∼25 members (3.Meyerhof W. Rev.

The identification of activating bitter compounds for hTAS2R4, -10, -14, -16, -38, -43, -44, and -47 using functional expression assays revealed that they are tuned to detect many structurally related compounds or even a variety of diverse chemical structures (4.Behrens M.

Generation of Receptor Constructs—A fusion construct coding for the rat somatostatin receptor subtype 3 amino terminus, the hTAS2R16 open reading frame, and a HSV tag (5.Bufe B. Hofmann T. Krautwurst D. Raguse J.D. Meyerhof W. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) was used to generate the construct sst3-hTAS2R16FLAGhsv. By PCR-mediated recombination (18.Fang G. Weiser B. Visosky A. Moran T. Burger H. Nat.

Commun. 2004; 319: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar); hTAS2R38, 100 μm PTC (6.Bufe B. Breslin P.A. Kuhn C. Reed D.R. Tharp C.D. Slack J.P. Kim U.K. Drayna D. Meyerhof W. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 322-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar); hTAS2R43, 10 μm aristolochic acid (8.Kuhn C. Bufe B. Winnig M. Hofmann T. Frank O. Behrens M. Lewtschenko T. Slack J.P. Ward C.D. Meyerhof W. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10260-10265Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar); hTAS1R2/3, 1 mm stevioside (21.Winnig M. Bufe B. Meyerhof W. BMC Neurosci. 2005; 6: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar)), and changes in fluorescence were monitored. Dose-response curves of hTAS2R16 constructs cotransfected with RTP3 and RTP4 expression plasmids were performed in quadruplicates and reflect two independent experiments. The cells were stimulated with 10μm, 30 μm, 100 μm, 300 μm, 1 mm, 3 mm, 10 mm, and 30 mm salicin, respectively. For agonist profiling of hTAS2R16FLAG-hsv coexpressed with RTP3/4, a single experiment was performed in triplicate. The cells were stimulated with salicin, helicin, and arbutin (5.Bufe B. Hofmann T. Krautwurst D. Raguse J.D. Meyerhof W. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Because of artifacts observed in cells stimulated with higher than 10 mm helicin and arbutin, respectively, these responses were excluded. Immunocytochemistry—For immunocytochemistry of hTAS-2R16FLAG-hsv and subcellular marker proteins HEK 293T-Gα16gust44 cells were used. 24 h after transfection some wells were treated with 10 μg/ml brefeldin A for 2 h (Sigma) to cause dissociation of Golgi components before fixation. The cells were then rinsed twice with 37 °C warm PBS and fixed for 5 min at room temperature with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.2). After rinsing with TBS, the cells were permeabilized by 0.25% Triton X-100 in TBS (4 min at room temperature). The cells were then washed with TBS and incubated with blocking solution (5% normal horse serum in TBS) for 30 min at room temperature before primary antibodies (1:1000 mouse anti-FLAG M2, 1:1000 rabbit anti-FLAG, 1:100 rabbit anti-HA from Sigma; 1:100 mouse anti-EEA1, 1:100 mouse anti-GM130, 1:50 mouse anti-p230 from BD Biosciences; 1:200 rabbit anti-calnexin from Stressgen) were applied in blocking solution and left overnight at 4 °C on the cells. On the next day the cells were washed with TBS, treated with blocking solution, and incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies (1:4000 sheep antimouse Cy3, 1:2500 sheep anti-rabbit Cy3 from Sigma; 1:1000 goat anti-mouse Alexa488, 1:1000 goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 from Invitrogen) diluted in blocking solution. Finally, washes with TBS and a brief rinse with H2O were performed before the glass coverslips were mounted onto slides using a fluorescence stabilizing mounting medium (DakoCytomation, Hamburg, Germany). Confocal images were obtained using a Leica TCS-SP2 system (Leica, Mannheim, Germany). The settings for secondary antibodies coupled to the fluorophore Alexa488 were: laser emission wavelength, 488 nm; detection wavelength, 500-530 nm; and for antibodies coupled to Cy3: laser emission wavelength, 543 nm; detection wavelength, 580-640 nm. For cellular cotransfection of hTAS2R16FLAG-hsv with RTP3 and RTP4, the cDNAs of RTP3 and RTP4 were fused with amino-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tags by PCR using the following oligonucleotides: RTP3, 5′-TCTAAGCTTCCACCATGTATCCATATGACGTTCCTGACTATGCAATGGCTGGGGACACAGAAGTG-3′, and RTP4, 5′-TCTAAGCTTCCACCATGTATCCATATGACGTTCCTGACTATGCAATGGTTGTAGATTTCTGGAC-3′ in combination with a primer specific for the BGH poly(A) site of the vector. The resulting PCR products were subcloned into the pcDNA5FRT vector. Transfection and immunostaining of HEK 293T-Gα16gust44 cells were mainly done as before. Briefly, the cells were fixed, permeabilized, blocked, and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at +4 °C (1:2000 mouse anti-FLAG M2; 1:500 rabbit anti-HA). Treatment with secondary antibodies (1:2000 anti-rabbit Alexa488; 1:4000 anti-mouse Cy3) was done as before. Biotinylation of Cell Surface Proteins—To quantify the proportion of receptor proteins present at the plasma membrane in the presence or absence of RTP proteins, biotinylation experiments were performed. HEK 293T cells were either transfected with hTAS2R16-FLAG-FLAG alone or in combination with RTP3 and RTP4, respectively. 24 h after transfection the cells were washed twice with 1× PBS buffer (pH 8.0) and subsequently placed on ice for 20 min before 0.5 mg/ml NHS-PO4-Biotin (Pierce) in 1× PBS (ice-cold) was applied and left on the cells for 30 min. The cells were washed once with ice-cold 1× PBS; 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) to quench the reaction. After a second wash with ice-cold 1× PBS (pH 8.0), homogenization buffer (1× PBS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A; pH 7.2) was added, and the cells were scraped off the plates and subsequently homogenized using a Potter-Elvehjem. After incubating for 30 min on ice, the samples were centrifuged (16,000 × g at +4 °C for 30 min) to pellet cellular debris. Next, protein contents of the samples were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay. For affinity purification of the FLAG-tagged receptor, 10 μl of FLAG-agarose (Sigma) and 10 μl of neutravidin-agarose (Pierce), respectively, were added to 250 μg each of the whole cell protein extracts and incubated overnight (+4 °C, gentle agitation). Agarose beads were then washed five times with 500 μl of 1 × PBS (pH 7.2) containing protease inhibitors. FLAG-agarose beads were treated as before (see “Coimmunoprecipitation”), Neutravidin-agarose beads were resuspended directly in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. Western blotting and immunodetection of FLAG-tagged receptors was performed as described for the coimmunoprecipitation procedure. Expression Analyses—RT-PCR analyses of RTP, REEP, and hTAS2R mRNAs were essentially done as before (20.Behrens M. Venkatraman G. Gronostajski R.M. Reed R.R. Margolis F.L. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 1372-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Primer sequences (5′ to 3′) were: RTP1_for, AAGCGTGACCACAGATGAGTG; RTP1_rev, GAGCAGAAGTTCCAGCCTGAG; RTP-2_for, AAGCAGTACCTGGAGCAGCAC; RTP2_rev, AAGAAGGCAGGACTGAGGAAG; RTP3_for, ATGGCTGGGGACACAGAAGTG; RTP3_rev, CAGATGTGGTTTTGGCATGCG; RTP4_for, TGGACGCTGAAGTTGGATGGC; RTP4_rev, AGTGGATCTGGGTCTCGACTG; hTAS2R14_for, GCTTTGGCAATCTCTCGAATTAGC; hTAS2R14_rev, CTCTAAATTCTTTGTGACCTGAGGGC; hTAS2R16_for, CCTGGGAATTTTTTAATATCCTTACATTCTGGT; hTAS2R16_rev, GAAGCGCGCTTTCATGCTT; hTAS2R38_for, ACAGTGATTGTGTGCTGCTG; and hTAS2R38_rev, GCTCTCCTCAACTTGGCATT. Amplification of REEP1-6 cDNA was done using the same set of oligonucleotides as used for cDNA cloning. 10-μm sections of human circumvallate papillae from biopsy material were used for in situ hybridization analyses with homologous, digoxigenin-labeled RTP3 and RTP4 riboprobes. The sense and antisense probes corresponded to nucleotides 1-350 of the human RTP3 cDNA and to nucleotides 1-368 of the human RTP4 cDNA, respectively. In situ hybridization was performed mainly as described before (20.Behrens M. Venkatraman G. Gronostajski R.M. Reed R.R. Margolis F.L. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 1372-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), except for the duration of the RNase A digestion step, which has been shortened to 5 min. Coimmunoprecipitation—For immunoprecipitation of hTAS-2R16, the carboxyl-terminal HSV tag was replaced by an additional FLAG tag to improve affinity purification of the receptor further. HEK 293T-Ga16gust44 cells were cotransfected with hTAS2R16FLAG-FLAG and HA-RTP3 or HA-RTP4. Approximately 24 h after transfection cells were harvested, and the proteins were extracted. Briefly, the cells were homogenized on ice in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A using a glass homogenizer. After 30 min of incubation on ice, the cell debris was removed by centrifugation (30 min, 16,000 × g, +4 °C). Protein concentrations of supernatants were determined by Bio-Rad protein assay, and 1 mg of each protein extract was subjected to immunoprecipitation using either anti-FLAG agarose beads or anti-HA-agarose beads (Sigma). After extensive washing with TBS, bound proteins were eluted for 30 min at 56 °C with standard SDS-PAGE loading buffer without reducing agents. Following a brief centrifugation the supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes, and dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 200 mm. Next, the samples were heated to 95 °C for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting according to standard procedures. Detection of FLAG and HA epitopes was done using 1:1000 rabbit anti-FLAG/1:5000 sheep anti-rabbit coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) and 1:1000 mouse anti-HA (Covance, Berkeley, CA) with 1:5000 goat anti-mouse coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma), respectively, in combination with standard colorimetry. Functional Characterization of Recombinant hTAS2R16—To investigate the dependence of hTAS2R16 function in heterologous cells on the presence of export tags, we performed functional calcium imaging experiments comparing sst3-hTAS2R16FLAG-hsv with hTAS2R16FLAG-hsv. The dose-response curves obtained by stimulating receptor-transfected cells with different concentrations of the agonist salicin demonstrate the different responsiveness of both receptor variants. Compared with sst3-hTAS2R16FLAG-hsv (Fig. 1, circles), the construct hTAS2R16FLAG-hsv is much less sensitive (Fig. 1, triangles). However, high agonist concentrations lead to activation of hTAS2R16FLAG-hsv, showing that the receptor is functional. The signal amplitude obtained for hTAS2R16FLAG-hsv stimulated with 10 mm salicin is ∼15-fold smaller when compared with the sst tag-containing construct (Fig. 1, inset). Subcellular Localization of hTAS2R16—To investigate the reason for the decreased responsiveness of hTAS2R16FLAG-hsv, we performed immunocytochemical colocalization analyses using antibodies for subcellular marker proteins in combination with anti-FLAG staining of receptor transfected HEK 293T cells (Fig. 2). Coimmunostaining of hTAS2R16FLAG-hsv (red) with the ER-marker anti-calnexin (23.Wada I. Rindress D. Cameron P.H. Ou W.J. Doherty II, J.J. Louvard D. Bell A.W. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19599-19610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (green) (Fig. 2, A-C) shows limited colocalization. The lack of colocalization of the receptor with EEA1, a marker for early endosomes (24.Mu F.T. Callaghan J.M. Steele-Mortimer O. Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Campbell P.L. McCluskey J. Yeo J.P. Tock E.P.

Chem. 1995; 270: 13503-13511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar), argues against constitutive internalization as observed for the human α1a-adrenergic receptor or class 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (25.Bhattacharya M.

Schwinn D.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) as the reason for the predominant intracellular localization of the receptor (Fig. 2, D-F). Next, we used two markers for the Golgi apparatus. GM130 is a marker for the cis-compartment (27.Nakamura N. Rabouille C. Watson R. Nilsson T. Hui N. Slusarewicz P. Kreis T.E. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1715-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), whereas the p230 protein is associated with the trans-Golgi network (28.Erlich R. Gleeson P.A. Campbell P. Dietzsch E. Toh B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8328-8337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows overlapping signals between hTAS2R16FLAG-hsv and GM130 (G-J) and p230 (O-R), respectively, indicating that the receptor accumulates within the Golgi compartment. The proportions of hTAS2R16FLAG-hsv positive cells exhibiting colocalization with GM130 (Fig. 2J) or p230 (Fig. 2R) are ∼80 and ∼70%, respectively. To verify this observation we subjected the cells to brefeldin A treatment. This compound leads to a redistribution of cis- and medial-Golgi contents into the ER, whereas the trans-Golgi-network fuses with early endosomes (29.Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L. Tipper C. Amherdt M. Orci L. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1991; 67: 601-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 30.Wood S.A. Park J.E. Brown W.J. Cell. 1991; 67: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Immunostaining after brefeldin A treatment results in the separation of hTAS2R16FLAG-hsv and GM230 signals (Fig. 2, K-N), although ∼16% of the cells still show an overlap between both signals (Fig. 2N). The overlap between receptor and p230 (Fig. 2, S-V) persists despite brefeldin A treatment in ∼47% of the cells, demonstrating that hTAS2R16 accumulates within the trans-Golgi compartment. The absence of signals from negative control reactions (Fig. 2, W-Y) performed without the addition of primary antibodies demonstrate the specificity of immunostainings. Identification of Factors Involved in Cell Surface Targeting of Chemoreceptors in hTAS2R-expressing Tissues—Recently, it was reported that members of the RTP and REEP gene families improve cell surface expression of ORs (17.Saito H. Kubota M. Roberts R.W. Chi Q. Matsunami H. Cell. 2004; 119: 679-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). By RT-PCR analysis of a human CV, which is a site of bitter receptor gene expression (4.Behrens M. Brockhoff A. Kuhn C. Bufe B. Winnig M. Meyerhof W. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10260-10265Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), we detected expression of RTP2 and RTP4 and all six REEP genes (Fig. 3A). Another tissue expressing hTAS2R genes is testis, where we analyzed for hTAS2R14, -16, and -38 (Fig. 3C). In contrast to CV, RTP1-4 and REEP1, -4, -5, and -6 genes are expressed in testis (Fig. 3B). The presence of all three analyzed hTAS2R mRNAs in testis suggests additional functions for these receptors apart from their function in bitter taste. Coexpression of hTAS2Rs and RTP/REEP factors in the two tissues analyzed indicates a possible interaction of the corresponding proteins. By in situ hybridization with riboprobes specific for RTP3 and RTP4 mRNAs isolated, globular cells within or close to taste buds are labeled in Fig. 3D). The morphology, the relatively small number, and the location of these stained cells suggest that they might be basal cells. Functional Interaction between hTAS2Rs and Human RTPs/REEPs—To investigate whether RTP and REEP proteins improve functional heterologous expression of hTAS2R proteins, we performed calcium imaging experiments. The results of HEK 293T-Gα16gust44 cells cotransfected with either hTAS2R16FLAG-hsv, hTAS2R14, hTAS2R43, or the sweet taste receptor heteromer hTAS1R2/hTAS1R3 (31.Nelson G."
https://openalex.org/W1981705708,"Cathelicidin genes homologous to the human CAMP gene, coding for the host defense peptide LL-37, have been sequenced and analyzed in 20 primate species, including Great Apes, hylobatidae, cercopithecidae, callithricidae, and cebidae. The region corresponding to the putative mature antimicrobial peptide is subject to a strong selective pressure for variation, with evidence for positive selection throughout the phylogenetic tree relating the peptides, which favors alterations in the charge while little affecting overall hydrophobicity or amphipathicity. Selected peptides were chemically synthesized and characterized, and two distinct types of behavior were observed. Macaque and leaf-eating monkey RL-37 peptides, like other helical antimicrobial peptides found in insect, frog, and mammalian species, were unstructured in bulk solution and had a potent, salt and medium independent antimicrobial activity in vitro, which may be the principal function also in vivo. Human LL-37 and the orangutan, hylobates, and callithrix homologues instead showed a salt-dependent structuring and likely aggregation in bulk solution that affected antimicrobial activity and its medium dependence. The two types of peptides differ also in their interaction with host cells. The evolution of these peptides has thus resulted in distinct mechanisms of action that affect the direct antimicrobial activity and may also modulate accessory antimicrobial functions due to interactions with host cells.

Host defense peptides (HDPs), 4The abbreviations used are: HDP, host defense peptide; ML, maximum likelihood; TSB, tryptic soy broth; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PI, propidium iodide; HATU, O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate; TBTU, O-(benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate; PyBOP, 1H-benzotriazol-1-yl-oxy-tris(pyrrolidino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate; TFE, trifluoroethanol; NWM, New World Monkey. produced by epithelial and phagocytic cells, are an important component of innate immune defense at mucosal surfaces. Among these are the cathelicidin family of HDPs, which have been identified in several mammalian and non-mammalian species, and that are characterized by conserved pro-regions carrying highly variable antimicrobial sequences (1.Zanetti M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 75: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 2.Tomasinsig L. Zanetti M. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2005; 6: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Besides the direct capacity to inactivate microbes, some of these cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides have also been found to act as immune modulators and mediators of inflammation, influencing diverse processes such as cell proliferation and migration, wound healing, angiogenesis, and the release of cytokines and histamine (3.Bals R. Wilson J.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). For these reasons, they qualify as prototypes of innovative multifunctional drugs that may be used to treat infection and/or modulate immune response (4.Koczulla A.R. Bals R. Drugs. 2003; 63: 389-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Cathelicidins all include N-terminal signal peptides followed by cathelin-like domains (the pro-region), which are conserved across species, followed by the highly diverse C-terminal antimicrobial domains. In mammals, their structures range from cysteine-bridged hairpins to linear tryptophan-rich, prolinerich, or α-helical molecules, and their sizes range from a dozen to over 80 residues (1.Zanetti M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 75: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 2.Tomasinsig L. Zanetti M. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2005; 6: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 5.Zanetti M. Gennaro R. Romeo D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). The helical group is the most widespread, and its members generally display a broad-spectrum bactericidal activity (6.Tossi A. Sandri L. Giangaspero A. Biopolymers. 2000; 55: 4-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar, 7.Gennaro R. Zanetti M. Biopolymers. 2000; 55: 31-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism studies indicate that these peptides are generally unstructured in bulk solution, and adopt a helical conformation only in contact with membrane-like environments, whereas most of the published evidence indicates that they act by disrupting the bacterial membrane (7.Gennaro R. Zanetti M. Biopolymers. 2000; 55: 31-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 8.Oren Z. Shai Y. Biopolymers. 1998; 47: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar, 9.Shai Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). This type of cathelicidin HDP has been identified in rodents (rabbit rCAP-18, mouse and rat CRAMP, and guinea pig CAP-11), primates (human LL-37 and rhesus RL-37), bovids (bovine BMAP-27, -28, and -34, sheep SMAP-29 and -34, and goat MAP-28 and -34), horse (eCATH-1 to -3), and pig (PMAP-23, -36, and -37), and a putative member has recently been identified also in dog (2.Tomasinsig L. Zanetti M. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2005; 6: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The only cathelicidin gene present in humans (CAMP) is expressed in inflammatory and epithelial cells, and its product (hCAP-18) contains a 30-residue signal region, a 103-residue polypeptide corresponding to the conserved cathelin-like proregion, and the 37-residue peptide LL-37 at the C terminus, which becomes antimicrobially active on release from the proregion by the action of proteinase 3 (10.Sorensen O.E. Follin P. Johnsen A.H. Calafat J. Tjabringa G.S. Hiemstra P.S. Borregaard N. Blood. 2001; 97: 3951-3959Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). The mature HDP, which has been identified in plasma, in the airway surface fluid and in wound secretions, is induced by inflammatory or infectious stimuli and displays membrane-directed antimicrobial activity, in vitro (1.Zanetti M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 75: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 3.Bals R. Wilson J.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). However, this activity seems to be quite medium sensitive, and accompanied by a relatively high cytotoxicity, possibly related to its tendency to aggregate to form multimeric helical bundles (11.Turner J. Cho Y. Dinh N.N. Waring A.J. Lehrer R.I. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 2206-2214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Johansson J. Gudmundsson G.H. Rottenberg M.E. Berndt K.D. Agerberth B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3718-3724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in line with the widening role of antimicrobial peptides as effector molecules of innate immunity, LL-37 was also found to bind to formyl peptide receptor-like 1 (FPRL1), a G protein-coupled, 7-transmembrane cell receptor found on macrophages, neutrophils, and subsets of lymphocytes (13.Yang D. Chen Q. Schmidt A.P. Anderson G.M. Wang J.M. Wooters J. Oppenheim J.J. Chertov O. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Thus, apart from being an endogenous cytolytic antibiotic providing a first line of host defense, it also acts as a multifunctional immune mediator by modifying the local inflammatory response, and helping to activate adaptive immunity. In this respect, LL-37/hCAP-18 has also been found to induce a functionally important direct effect on endothelial cells, so that it links inflammation and host defense with angiogenesis (14.Koczulla R. von Degenfeld G. Kupatt C. Krotz F. Zahler S. Gloe T. Issbrucker K. Unterberger P. Zaiou M. Lebherz C. Karl A. Raake P. Pfosser A. Boekstegers P. Welsch U. Hiemstra P.S. Vogelmeier C. Gallo R.L. Clauss M. Bals R. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). The cathelin-like N-terminal pro-region, after release of the HDP by proteolytic cleavage, can also apparently contribute to innate host defense through inhibition of bacterial growth and limitation of cysteine-protease-mediated tissue damage (15.Zaiou M. Nizet V. Gallo R.L. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 810-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). As these dual functions are complementary to those of LL-37, the human cathelicidin represents an elegant multifunctional effector molecule for innate immune defense of the skin. The human CAMP gene consists of four exons (Fig. 1) and is localized on chromosome 3p21.3 (16.Gudmundsson G.H. Agerberth B. Odeberg J. Bergman T. Olsson B. Salcedo R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). It contains several potential binding sites for transcription factors (acute-phase response factor and nuclear factor for interleukin-6 expression) that are possibly involved in the regulation of gene expression (16.Gudmundsson G.H.

Borregaard N. Stahle-Backdahl M. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2561-2566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To study the evolution of this gene, we have sequenced the homologues of the entire CAMP gene coding region in 20 non-human primate species and compared it with the human sequence. This has provided information on how variations in the sequence of the C-terminal HDP affect its structural characteristics, and how this correlates with its functional characteristics, and in particular with the capacity to directly inactivate different types of bacteria and yeast. Moreover, we have investigated whether any of these variations could be due to a positive selective pressure, possibly derived from exposure to different biotas and/or pathogens. Materials—2-Chlorotrityl chloride resin, O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU), O-(benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU), and Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl) methoxycarbonyl)-protected amino acids were from Applied Biotech Italy (Milan, Italy). 1H-Benzotriazol-1-yl-oxy-tris(pyrrolidino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP) was from Novabiochem (Darmstadt, Germany). Mueller-Hinton broth and Bacto-agar were obtained from Difco Laboratories (Detroit, MI); o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, lysozyme, lysostaphin, and bovine serum albumin were from Sigma, CENTA was from Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany). All other reagents were of analytical grade. Buffers were prepared in double glass-distilled water. Non-human Primate DNA Samples—We have collected biological samples (muscles from deceased animals or hairs) for different non-human primate species at the Negara Zoo, Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur), and at the Mulhouse Zoo, France. Other DNA samples were obtained at the genomic primates DNA bank of the genetic service of the Department of Reproduction and Development Sciences (University of Trieste). A total of 20 non-human primate species and subspecies, including several individuals per species were analyzed (numbers indicated in parentheses). These were, among the catarrhini: three Great Ape species, Pan troglodytis, chimpanzee (3), Gorilla gorilla (3); and Pongo pygmaeus, orangutan (4); five hylobatidae (gibbon) species: Hylobates concolor (5), H. concolor gabriellae (2), Hylobates lar (2), H. concolor leucogenys (2), H. moloch (3); seven cercopithecidae (Old World Monkey) species, including five cercopithecinae species: the macaques M. fascicularis (25), M. mulatta (rhesus macaque) (7), M. tonkeana (5), the baboon Papio anubis (3), and the vervet monkey Cercopithecus aethiops (15); and two colobinae species (leaf-monkeys): Presbytis cristata (5) and P. obscurus (3). Among the platyrrhini (New World Monkeys), there were two callithricidae species, the marmoset Callithrix jaccus (30) and the tamarin Saguinus oedipus (2); three cebidae, including two spider monkey subspecies: Ateles fusciceps (3) and A. fusciceps robustus (1) and the capuchin monkey Cebus capucinus (5). DNA Extraction, PCR Amplification, and Sequencing—Genomic DNAs were extracted from the muscle tissue using the GenomePrep DNA extraction kit (Amersham Biosciences). DNA was extracted from hairs using the Chelex 100 method following standard protocols (18.Walsh P.S. Metzger D.A. Higuchi R. BioTechniques. 1991; 10: 506-513PubMed Google Scholar). Genomic amplification of LL-37 was performed using primers designed on the basis of the published human sequence (GenBank accession number NT_022517). Primer sequences were as follows (see Fig. 1): 1F, first exon, forward primer: 5′-AAGCAATAGCCAGGGGCTAAAGCAAACCC-3′; 1R, first exon, reverse primer: 5′-GGCATCTCCCCCTTTAAATGTGGTCC-3′; 2F, second exon, forward primer: 5′-GGGTAGGAATGGCTCAGTCCT-3′; 2R, second exon, reverse primer: 5′-TGGTGAAGCGGTGTATGGG-3′; 3F, third exon, forward primer: 5′-GAGGTCATGGCAAATGGTTTC-3′; 3R, third exon, reverse primer: 5′-AGAGTGTGGACCATCCAATGGGTCAAT-3′; 4F, fourth exon, forward primer: 5′-TCACTATCTCCGGGACTCTGTTTT-3′; 4R, fourth exon, reverse primer: 5′-CCTCCTCTCTCTCACCACAACTG-3′. The PCRs were carried out in a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applera Genomics, Foster City, CA) with 1 unit of Taq Gold (Applera Genomics), 0.4 mm dNTPs and variable concentrations of MgCl2 (from 1.5 to 2.5 mm). The amplification conditions were 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 54 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C for 45 cycles. PCR products were observed, under UV light, in a 2% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide. DNA sequencing of the amplicons was performed using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit 2.0 (Applied Biosystems). DNA sequences were detected and analyzed on an automated ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Sequence Analyses and Comparisons—Multiple alignments of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences were performed using the software CLUSTAL X. A phylogenetic tree was then obtained by Neighbor Joining analysis, using the PHYLIP software package, with the mouse CRAMP sequence as the out-group. Maximum likelihood (ML) analysis was performed with the PAML software package (19.Yang Z. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1997; 13: 555-556PubMed Google Scholar), comparing the log-likelihood ratios of the data using different NSsites models (20.Yang Z. Nielsen R. Goldman N. Pedersen A.M. Genetics. 2000; 155: 431-449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This type of analysis is able to identify amino acid residues with high posterior probabilities (greater than 0.95) of having evolved under positive selection. ω ratios for the tree were calculated by different models (free ratio, two and three ratio) (21.Yang Z. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1998; 15: 568-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). The global hydrophobicity and the amphipathicity for each deduced putative HDP sequence were calculated using a hydrophobicity index (Hi) scale derived from the normalized and filtered consensus of 163 published scales (22.Tossi A. Sandri L. Giangaspero A. Benedetti E. Pedone C. Peptides 2002: Proceedings of the 27th European Peptide Symposium. Edizioni Ziino, Naples, Italy2002: 416-417Google Scholar) arbitrarily ranged between maximum values of +10 for Phe and –10 for Arg. The hydrophobicity is given as the mean per residue value (H = (ΕHi/37). The mean hydrophobic moment (μHmax) was calculated as described by Eisenberg et al. (23.Eisenberg D. Weiss R.M. Terwilliger T.C. Nature. 1982; 299: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). The relative amphipathicity (μH/μHmax) for each peptide was then determined with respect to the value of the maximum hydrophobic moment for a perfectly amphipathic, 18-residue peptide composed only of Phe and Arg (μHmax = 6.4 with our scale). This relative measure of amphipathicity is less likely to vary according to the scale used than an absolute value. Peptide Synthesis and Characterization—Solid phase peptide syntheses were performed on a thermostated PE Biosystems Pioneer® automated peptide synthesizer loaded with 2-chlorotrityl chloride resin (substitution 0.22–0.27 milliequivalent/g). Insertion of the C-terminal amino acid was carried out manually according to the protocol provided in the synthesis notes section of the 2003 Novabiochem catalog (section 2.17). A 4-fold excess of 1:1:1.7 Fmoc-amino acid/TBTU/diisopropylethylamine and a version of the anti-aggregation solvent “magic mixture” (dimethylformamide/N-methylpyrrolidone (3:1, v/v), 1% Triton X-100, 1 m ethylene carbonate) were used for each coupling step. Double coupling with HATU or PyBOP was carried out at all positions. Peptides were cleaved from the resin and deprotected using a mixture consisting of trifluoroacetic acid, water, and triisopropylsilane (95:2.5:2.5, by volume). The crude peptides were purified with a Waters Delta-Pak® C18 column (5 μm, 300 Å, 25 mm × 100 mm) and the fraction containing the correct peptide was confirmed by ESI-MS (PE Sciex API 1). Peptide concentrations were estimated gravimetrically and confirmed using both spectrophotometric determination of phenylalanine (ϵ257 = 195.1) and colorimetric determinations using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) and the ninhydrin assay. Circular Dichroism—Structuring was probed by CD spectroscopy on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan), using 2-mm path length quartz cells and a default peptide concentration of 40 μm, under a series of conditions. All spectra are the mean of at least two trials, each with the accumulation of three scans. Helical content was estimated from the ellipticity at 222 nm, according to Chen et al. (24.Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). Antimicrobial Activity Assays—The antimicrobial activity of the synthetic peptides was determined against Escherichia coli ML-35, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus aureus 710A, Enterococcus faecalis A16, and a Candida albicans clinical isolate as the minimum inhibitory concentration using a microdilution susceptibility test as described previously (25.Tossi A. Scocchi M. Zanetti M. Gennaro R. Storici P. Romeo D. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 78: 133-150PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, serial 1:1 dilutions of each peptide were made in 96-well microtiter plates, to a final volume of 100 μl of tryptic soy broth (TSB) (5 or 20% (v/v) in SPB, pH 7.4, or in PIL buffer, pH 7.3) with ≈105 colony forming units/ml of bacteria in logarithmic phase. Plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight and the minimum inhibitory concentration was considered as the first well without visible growth. For antifungal assays, fungi were cultivated on solid Sabouraud/dextrose agar medium, and minimum inhibitory concentration values were determined in Sabouraud/dextrose medium (5 or 20% (v/v) in SPB or PIL buffers). The kinetics of bacterial killing was confirmed against both E. coli ML-35 and S. aureus 710A in the logarithmic phase (≈107 colony forming units/ml in PBS incubated at 37 °C). At different times, 50 μl of the bacteria/peptide suspension was diluted severalfold in ice-cold PBS, and the solution plated on nutrient agar and incubated overnight to allow colony counts. The permeabilization of the outer membrane of E. coli by the peptides was evaluated by following the unmasking of the periplasmic hydrolytic enzyme β-lactamase, using extracellular CENTA as substrate, whereas that of the cytoplasmic membrane by unmasking cytoplasmic β-galactosidase activity using extracellular o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate, as described previously (26.Tiozzo E. Rocco G. Tossi A. Romeo D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase constitutive, lactose-permease-deficient E. coli ML-35 pYC strain was used (≈107 colony forming units/ml), exposed to a 5 μm peptide concentration and 1.5 mm of either substrate, in PBS with or without addition of 20% (v/v) TSB. Permeabilization of the cytoplasmic membrane of S. aureus 710A was instead evaluated by following unmasking of cytoplasmic 6-phospho-β-galactosidase activity as described previously (27.Zelezetsky I. Pag U. Antcheva N. Sahl H.G. Tossi A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 434: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), using freshly synthesized o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside-6P and 5 μm peptide concentrations. Bacteria treated with lysostaphin (30 μg/ml) and egg white lysozyme (30 μg/ml) were taken to be 100% permeabilized. Cytotoxicity Assays—Hemolytic activity was determined as lysis of erythrocyte membranes by monitoring the release of hemoglobin at 415 nm, from 0.5% human erythrocyte suspensions (0.2 ml) in relation to complete (100%) hemolysis as determined by addition of 0.2% Triton X-100. Flow cytometric analysis were performed with an XL instrument (Coulter Instruments), suspensions of 106 lymphocytes in 1 ml of PIL buffer were exposed to peptides for 60 min at 37 °C as described previously (28.Zelezetsky I. Pacor S. Pag U. Papo N. Shai Y. Sahl H.G. Tossi A. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Fluorescence data from damaged cells showing permeability to PI was acquired in a monoparametric histogram (emission wavelength = 612 nm) and submitted to the Student-Newmann-Keuls test of variance. Amino Acid Sequence Analyses—The amino acid sequences for primate CAP-18 were deduced from the determined sequences of primate genes orthologous to CAMP (see supplemental Fig. S1). Like hCAP-18, the open reading frame in all cases consists of a putative 30-residue N-terminal signal sequence, the 103-residue pro-region (cathelin-like domain), with the four characteristic conserved cysteine residues involved in two disulfide bridges, and the mature C-terminal HDP of 37 amino acids (see Fig. 2 for the aligned, 170-residue full sequences). Of these, only the human (16.Gudmundsson G.H. Agerberth B. Odeberg J. Bergman T. Olsson B. Salcedo R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) and rhesus macaque (29.Zhao C. Nguyen T. Boo L.M. Hong T. Espiritu C. Orlov D. Wang W. Waring A. Lehrer R.I. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2695-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 30.Bals R. Lang C. Weiner D.J. Vogelmeier C. Welsch U. Wilson J.M. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 2001; 8: 370-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) sequences had been reported previously. Our rhesus sequence is in agreement with that of Zhao et al. (29.Zhao C. Nguyen T. Boo L.M. Hong T. Espiritu C. Orlov D. Wang W. Waring A. Lehrer R.I. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2695-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Among the deduced sequences, those from the Great Apes and the hylobatidae showed the highest similarity with the human one (91–96 and 90 –95%, respectively), followed by the Old World Monkeys (cercopithecidae, 91–92%) and then the New World Monkeys (78–84%). As expected, the majority of amino acid substitutions involved the putative antimicrobial HDP region, and only the peptide from our closest relative, the chimpanzee (PTR), is identical to human. Variation in the 37-residue HDP region with respect to other species ranges from 5 to 8% for the other Great Apes (gorilla GGO and orangutan PPY), 16 –24% for the hylobatidae (gibbons HCO, HCG, HCL, HMD, and HLE), 30 –32% for cercopithecidae (the macaques MMU, MFA, and MTO, the baboon PPA, the vervet CCA, and the silvered and dusky leaf monkeys PCR and POB), and over 43% for platyrrhine monkeys of the callithricidae (CJA and SOE) and cebidae families (CCA, AFU, and AFR). These substitutions, however, tend to be conservative, in the sense that the overall polar/hydrophobic residue distribution is maintained, as can best be appreciated by mapping them on a helical wheel (Edmundson) projection of the human peptide (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Substitution pattern for primate homologues of LL-37 shown on a helical wheel projection. The sequence of hssLL-37 is shown on the inside, and is divided into two stretches, residues 1–18 (left wheel) and 19 –36 (right wheel). Substituted residues in primate homologues are shown in the external rings, and substitution frequencies are qualitatively indicated by box and letter sizes. Non-polar residues are in open boxes, polar residues in dark gray boxes, charged residues in black boxes, and Gly/Pro in light gray boxes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) All the primate cathelicidin HDPs show an amphipathic distribution of residues over the whole sequence, with well defined polar and hydrophobic sectors. Residue variations between them tend to maintain this arrangement, as evidenced also by a limited variation in the relative amphipathicity (Fig. 2). The charge instead varies remarkably, from +4 in the orangutan and Ateles species to +10/+11 in two cercopithecidae species, the Asian leaf monkey Presbytis obscurus, and the African vervet monkey Cercopithecus aethiops, respectively. This is possible due to the interchanging of cationic, anionic, and neutral polar residues at specific positions (Fig. 3). It can thus be hypothesized that evolution works to vary the charge of these peptides while conserving the amphipathic structure. From positional residue frequencies in the sequence alignment, it is possible to derive a consensus sequence (Fig. 2, bottom) in which about half the residues are quite conserved, and interspersed throughout the sequence cluster more at the C terminus. A comparison of selected primate peptides with the HDPs from other mammalian cathelicidins that may be evolutionarily related to LL-37 (2.Tomasinsig L. Zanetti M. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2005; 6: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) are shown in Fig. 4. Conserved residues tend to coincide. A central cluster, corresponding to residues 19 –26 and bordering residues, is particularly conserved in all represented species. Other residues in stretches 9 –13 and 30 –36 also show some conservation with respect to rodents and dog sequences. It could thus be further hypothesized that these peptides may all have arisen from a common ancestral molecule, in which certain stretches have been conserved during evolution, whereas others have been allowed to vary. In this respect, the C-terminal part of the primate peptides, which is most conserved and coincides with conserved stretches in other mammals, may have a central structural and/or functional role. HDP Synthesis and Characterization—Six primate HDP sequences were selected for synthesis and characterization (Table 1). These were, apart from the reference human hssLL-37, the orangutan ppyLL-37, as the most different Great Ape peptide, and also one with the lowest charge; the gibbon hmdSL-37, as representative of the hylobatidae, the rhesus macaque mmuRL-37 and the highly cationic pobRL-37 as representatives of the cercopithecidae, and cjaRL-37 as representative of the New World Monkeys.TABLE 1Synthesized HDPs and their physico-chemical properties1 q, the charge.2 〈H〉, mean residue hydrophobicity.3 μHrel, relative amphipathicity.4 the composition of PIL buffer is described in Table 2. 1 q, the charge. 2 〈H〉, mean residue hydrophobicity. 3 μHrel, relative amphipathicity. 4 the composition of PIL buffer is described in Table 2. The capacity of the peptides to structure was then determined in a number of different conditions by circular dichroism. This took into account the reported behavior of LL-37, which assumes a helical conformation in the presence of biological membranes, but also in the presence of biologically relevant ions, in conditions that mimic human plasma (12.Johansson J.

https://openalex.org/W2107282732,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily that can promote cellular differentiation and organ development. PPARgamma expression has been reported in a number of pulmonary cell types, including inflammatory, mesenchymal, and epithelial cells. We find that PPARgamma is prominently expressed in the airway epithelium in the mouse lung. In an effort to define the physiological role of PPARgamma within the lung, we have ablated PPARgamma using a novel line of mice capable of specifically targeting the airway epithelium. Airway epithelial cell PPARgamma-targeted mice display enlarged airspaces resulting from insufficient postnatal lung maturation. The increase in airspace size is accompanied by alterations in lung physiology, including increased lung volumes and decreased tissue resistance. Genome-wide expression profiling reveals a reduction in structural extracellular matrix (ECM) gene expression in conditionally targeted mice, suggesting a disruption in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions necessary for the establishment of normal lung structure. Expression profiling of airway epithelial cells isolated from conditionally targeted mice indicates PPARgamma regulates genes encoding known PPARgamma targets, additional lipid metabolism enzymes, and markers of cellular differentiation. These data reveal airway epithelial cell PPARgamma is necessary for normal lung structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W1972811309,"Annexin A1 (ANXA1) has an important role in cell-cell communication in the host defense and neuroendocrine systems. In both systems, its actions are exerted extracellularly via membrane-bound receptors on adjacent sites after translocation of the protein from the cytoplasm to the cell surface of adjacent cells. This study used molecular, microscopic, and pharmacological approaches to explore the mechanisms underlying the cellular exportation of ANXA1 in TtT/GF (pituitary folliculo-stellate) cells. LPS caused serine-phosphorylation of ANXA1 (ANXA1-S27-PO4) and translocation of the phosphorylated protein to the cell membrane. The fundamental requirement of phosphorylation for membrane translocation was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy on cells transfected with wild-type or mutated (S27/A) ANXA1 constructs tagged with enhanced green fluorescence protein. The trafficking of ANXA1-S27-PO4 to the cell surface was dependent on PI3-kinase and MAP-kinase. It also required HMG-coenzyme A and myristoylation. The effects of HMG-coenzyme A blockade were overcome by mevalonic acid (the product of HMG-coenzyme A) and farnesyl-pyrophosphate but not by geranyl-geranylpyrophosphate or cholesterol. Together, these results suggest that serine-27 phosphorylation is essential for the translocation of ANXA1 across the cell membrane and also identify a role for isoprenyl lipids. Such lipids could target consensus sequences in ANXA1. Alternatively, they may target other proteins in the signal transduction cascade (e.g., transporters)."
https://openalex.org/W2158225515,"Neuropeptide S (NPS) has been recently recognized as the endogenous ligand for the previous orphan G-protein-coupled receptor GPR154, now referred to as the NPS receptor (NPSR). The NPS-NPSR receptor system regulates important biological functions such as sleeping/wakening, locomotion, anxiety, and food intake. To collect information on the mechanisms of interaction between NPS and its receptor, a classical structure-activity relationship study was performed. Human (h) NPS derivatives obtained by Ala and d-scan and N- and C-terminal truncation were assessed for their ability to stimulate calcium release in HEK293 cells expressing the human recombinant NPSR. The results of this study indicate that (i) the effect of hNPS is mimicked by the fragment hNPS-(1–10); (ii) Phe2, Arg3, and Asn4 are crucial for biological activity; (iii) the sequence Thr8-Gly9-Met10 is important for receptor activation, although with non-stringent chemical requirements; and (iv) the sequence Val6-Gly7 acts as a hinge region between the two above-mentioned domains. However, the stimulatory effect of hNPS given intracerebroventricularly on mouse locomotor activity was not fully mimicked by hNPS-(1–10), suggesting that the C-terminal region of the peptide maintains importance for in vivo activity.

Many drugs produce therapeutic activities by interacting with G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), 3The abbreviations used are: GPCRs, G-protein-coupled receptors; NPS, neuropeptide S; h, human; NPSR, neuropeptide S receptor; HEK, human embryonic kidney; FLIPR, fluorescence imaging plate reader; WT, wild-type; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; ANOVA, analysis of variance. which represent, at present, the most important biological target for drug discovery (1Gilchrist A.

This may remain true in the future, as at least 800 different genes coding for putative GPCRs have been identified in the human genome, ∼360 of which encode transmitter GPCRs (3Vassilatis D.K. Hohmann J.G. Zeng H. Li F. Ranchalis J.E. Mortrud M.T. Brown A. Rodriguez S.S. Weller J.R. Wright A.C. Bergmann J.E. Gaitanaris G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurobiol. 2005; 65: 179-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Novel drugs acting on orphan GPCRs are likely to provide innovative treatments for a variety of pathological conditions and diseases. The first step in understanding the function and the potential of an orphan receptor as drug target is the identification of its endogenous ligand. In the last 10 years, the reverse pharmacology technique (4Civelli O. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 15-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), i.e. the use of a recombinant orphan GPCR as a target for identifying its endogenous ligand, has been validated as a successful approach for the identification of novel transmitter systems. In particular, several novel peptide receptor systems have been identified with such an approach, including nociceptin/orphanin FQ, prolactin-releasing peptide, orexins, apelin, ghrelin, urotensin II, metastatin, neuropeptide B, neuropeptide W, and neuropeptide FF and their receptors (for a recent review, see Ref. 2Saito Y. Civelli O. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 2005; 65: 179-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). These novel peptide receptor systems have been demonstrated to play important roles in regulating several biological functions, e.g. food intake, pain transmission, cardiovascular homeostasis, sleep behavior, stress responses, and drug reward (4Civelli O.

One of the latest neuropeptides identified by the reverse pharmacology approach is neuropeptide S (NPS) (5Xu Y.L. Reinscheid R.K. Huitron-Resendiz S. Clark S.D. Wang Z. Lin S.H. Brucher F.A. Zeng J.

The N-terminal serine residue, which is present in all species analyzed so far, gave the name to this novel neuropeptide. As with other neuropeptides, hNPS is cleaved from a larger precursor protein containing a hydrophobic signal peptide and proteolytic processing sites (7Reinscheid R.K. Xu Y.L.

After its pairing with NPS, the GPR154 receptor was renamed the NPS receptor and abbreviated as NPSR by Civelli and co-workers (5Xu Y.L. Reinscheid R.K. Huitron-Resendiz S. Clark S.D. Wang Z.

In this study, we have adopted the abbreviations NPS for the peptide and NPSR for its receptor; however, we would like to emphasize that the latter abbreviation has to be considered provisional because it is not in line with the recommendations of the International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology for receptor nomenclature (8Ruffolo R.R. Humphrey P.P.A. Watson S.P. Spedding M. Ruffolo R.R. The IUPHAR Compendium of Receptor Characterization and Classification. 2nd Ed. IUPHAR Media, London2000: 7-8Google Scholar): the receptor name should not include the letter R as an abbreviation for receptor. In situ hybridization studies revealed that NPSR mRNA is widely expressed throughout the nervous system. In contrast, NPS precursor protein mRNA is strongly expressed only in the locus coeruleus area and in few nuclei of the brainstem (5Xu Y.L. Reinscheid R.K. Huitron-Resendiz S. Clark S.D. Wang Z.

Neuron. 2004; 43: 487-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). hNPS binds with high affinity (Kd = 0.33 nm) to the hNPSR expressed in HEK293 cells, where it increases the intracellular calcium levels with high potency (EC50 = 9.4 nm) (5Xu Y.L. Reinscheid R.K. Huitron-Resendiz S. Clark S.D. Wang Z. Lin S.H. Brucher F.A. Zeng J. Ly N.K. Henriksen S.J. de Lecea L. Civelli O. Neuron. 2004; 43: 487-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). In vivo, NPS injected intracerebroventricularly in mice at subnanomolar doses stimulates spontaneous locomotor activity and consistently induces anxiolytic-like effects in a battery of behavioral tests (open field, light-dark, elevated plus maze, marble burying) (5Xu Y.L. Reinscheid R.K. Huitron-Resendiz S. Clark S.D. Wang Z. Lin S.H. Brucher F.A. Zeng J. Ly N.K. Henriksen S.J. de Lecea L. Civelli O. Neuron. 2004; 43: 487-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). These anxiolytic-like properties of NPS were recently confirmed in the mouse four-plate model and demonstrated to be mediated by a non-benzodiazepine mechanism (9Leonard S.K. Malberg J.E. Schechter L.E. Luo B. Platt B. Rosenzweig-Lipson S. Ring R.H. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 2005; : 889.14Google Scholar). Moreover, NPS given intracerebroventricularly suppresses all stages of sleep in rats, indicating that this peptide may induce wakefulness (5Xu Y.L. Reinscheid R.K. Huitron-Resendiz S. Clark S.D. Wang Z. Lin S.H. Brucher F.A. Zeng J. Ly N.K. Henriksen S.J. de Lecea L. Civelli O. Neuron. 2004; 43: 487-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The profile of behavioral effects evoked by the intracerebroventricular administration of NPS (stimulation of arousal and wakefulness together with anxiolytic-like effects) appears to be quite unique because stimulants such as amphetamine and cocaine potently induce arousal but, at the same time, are anxiogenic. On the other hand, anxiolytics such as benzodiazepines produce sedative effects and are widely used as hypnotics. A variant form of the NPSR was recently identified as a candidate gene for asthma susceptibility (10Laitinen T. Polvi A. Rydman P. Vendelin J. Pulkkinen V. Salmikangas P. Makela S. Rehn M. Pirskanen A. Rautanen A. Zucchelli M. Gullsten H. Leino M. Alenius H. Petays T. Haahtela T. Laitinen A. Laprise C. Hudson T.J. Laitinen L.A. Kere J. Science. 2004; 304: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar); in addition, the NPSR was found to be significantly up-regulated in mouse lung after ovalbumin challenge in sensitized compared with non-sensitized mice (10Laitinen T. Polvi A. Rydman P. Vendelin J. Pulkkinen V. Salmikangas P. Makela S. Rehn M. Pirskanen A. Rautanen A. Zucchelli M. Gullsten H. Leino M. Alenius H. Petays T. Haahtela T. Laitinen A. Laprise C. Hudson T.J. Laitinen L.A. Kere J. Science. 2004; 304: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). An N107I variant of the NPSR was recently characterized pharmacologically, and the mutation was demonstrated to cause a gain of function and to lead to an increase in agonist potency without affecting binding affinity (11Reinscheid R.K. Xu Y.L. Okamura N. Zeng J. Chung S. Pai R. Wang Z. Civelli O. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 315: 1338-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Finally, in line with NPSR expression in the hypothalamus, a key brain region for the regulation of food intake, a recent publication demonstrated an inhibitory effect of NPS given intracerebroventricularly on food intake in rats (12Beck B. Fernette B. Stricker-Krongrad A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 332: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In summary, the NPS-NPSR system seems to play an important role in regulating central and peripheral functions; the development of NPSR-selective ligands is now needed to determine the therapeutic potential of novel drugs interacting with this receptor. NPSR agonists might have clinical application in the treatment of obesity, hypersomnia/narcolepsy, and anxiety disorders without causing sedation. In this work, we report the results of a classical structure-activity relationship study in which individual amino acids of the primary sequence were replaced with an alanine residue (Ala-scan) or the corresponding enantiomer (d-scan). Moreover, the N- and C-terminal portions of the peptide were progressively shortened (N- and C-terminal truncation) by single amino acid residue elimination. An HEK293 clonal cell line stably expressing the hNPSR was generated, and a functional assay was developed. All the NPS-related peptides were assayed for their ability to activate or inhibit using hNPSR-mediated Ca2+ mobilization. hNPS-(1–10) was identified as the minimum sequence required to activate the hNPSR in vitro with similar potency and efficacy as full-length hNPS. In addition, the in vivo effects of hNPS and its analog hNPS-(1–10) on locomotion were assessed after intracerebroventricular administration in mice. Generation of a Stable HEK293 Clonal Cell Line Expressing Human GPR154—The open reading frame of the hNPSR (human GPR154, GenBank™ accession number NM_20127) was cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). HEK293 cells were transfected by the FuGENE 6 method (Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland) at a plasmid/reagent ratio of 1:3. On day 2 post-transfection, Geneticin (400 μg/ml) was added to the culture medium. After 6 days of selection, clonal foci of cells expressing the Geneticin resistance gene encoded by the pcDNA3.1-hNPSR plasmid were selected and expanded. Functional expression of the hNPSR was evaluated by measuring NPS-stimulated calcium response over several passages in 10 different clones. On the basis of the robustness of the calcium response to hNPS measured by the fluorescence imaging plate reader (FLIPR) assay, clone 6 of HEK293 cells expressing the hNPSR (referred to as HEK293/hNPSR cells) was chosen for all further studies. Cell Culture—HEK293/hNPSR cells were maintained in minimal essential medium containing Earle's salts supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 2 mdl-glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, and 400 μg/ml Geneticin. Wild-type (WT) HEK293 cells were maintained in the same medium in the absence of Geneticin. Both cell lines were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified environment. FLIPR Experiments—HEK293/hNPSR and WT HEK293 cells were seeded at a density of 50,000 cells/well into poly-d-lysine-coated, 96-well black wall, clear bottom plates (BioCoat, BD Biosciences). The day after, the medium was removed by aspiration, and labeling medium (100 μl/well; cell culture medium supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm probenecid, 2 μm fluo-4 acetoxymethyl ester (Invitrogen), and 0.01% pluronic acid) was added. After 45 min at 37 °C, the labeling medium was aspirated, and assay buffer (100 μl/well; Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm probenecid, and 500 μm brilliant black) was added. Peptides were dissolved in Hanks' balanced salt solution/HEPES (20 mm), and serial dilutions were carried out in Hanks' balanced salt solution/HEPES (20 mm) containing 0.02% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (fraction V) to prepare a master plate at a 3-fold concentration. Carbachol (10 μm final concentration), which stimulates muscarinic receptors endogenously expressed by HEK293 cells, was included in each FLIPR experiment for evaluating cell viability and responsiveness. Fluorescence changes were measured (excitation λ = 488 nm and emission λ = 510 nm) at room temperature. On-line additions were carried out in a volume of 50 μl/well. The maximum change in fluorescence over the base line was used to determine agonist response. The agonist activity of hNPS analogs was evaluated by generating concentration-response curves in the range of 1 pm to 1 μm. Antagonist activity was investigated by generating inhibition curves for hNPS analogs (1 pm to 1 μm concentration range, 10-min preincubation time) against the stimulatory effect elicited by 30 nm hNPS (which corresponds approximately to the EC80) (see Fig. 1). Mouse Spontaneous Locomotor Activity—Male Swiss albino mice (Morini Farm, Reggio Emilia, Italy) weighing 30–35 g were used. They were housed in 425 × 266 × 155-mm cages (Tecniplast, Mantova, Italy), 9 animals/cage, under standard conditions (22 °C, 55% humidity, 12-h light-dark cycle, light on at 7:00 a.m.) with food (Mangime Italiano da Laboratorio, standard diet, Morini Farm) and water ad libitum for at least 7 days before experiments began. Mice were intracerebroventricularly injected (injection volume of 2 μl) under light ether anesthesia (i.e. just sufficient for losing the righting reflex) using the “free hand” technique described by Laursen and Belknap (13Laursen S.E. Belknap J.K. J. Pharmacol. Methods. 1986; 16: 355-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In brief, a 27-gauge needle attached via a polyethylene tube to a 10-μl Hamilton syringe was used for the injection at an ∼45° angle at 2 mm lateral to the bregma midline. Each mouse received only one intracerebroventricular injection. Experiments were carried out between 9:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. Dose-response curves for hNPS (dose range of 0.01–1 nmol) and hNPS-(1–10) (dose range of 0.1–10 nmol) were generated in mice acclimatized to the test chamber for 1 h prior to the injection. Locomotor activity was assessed using Basile activity cages as described previously (14Rizzi A. Bigoni R. Marzola G. Guerrini R. Salvadori S. Regoli D. Caló G. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2001; 363: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). At least 12 mice were randomly assigned to each treatment. Peptide Synthesis—hNPS and its analogs were synthesized according to published methods (15Benoiton N.L. Chemistry of Peptide Synthesis. Taylor & Francis, London2005: 125-154Crossref Google Scholar) using Fmoc/t-butyl chemistry with a Syro XP multiple peptide synthesizer (MultiSynTech GmbH, Witten Germany). Preloaded Fmoc 4-benzyloxybenzyl ester resin (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) was used for the synthesis of all peptides. The peptides were cleaved from the resin using reagent B (16Solé N.A. Barany G. J. Org. Chem. 1992; 57: 5399-5403Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar); after filtration of the exhausted resin, the solvent was concentrated in vacuo, and the residue was triturated with ether. Crude peptides were purified by preparative reversed-phase HPLC, and the purity grade was checked by analytical HPLC analyses and mass spectrometry using a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Bruker BioScience Corp., Billerica, MA) and an electrospray ionization Micromass ZMD-2000 mass spectrometer (Waters). Drugs and Reagents—Mouse and rat NPS were purchased from Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Belmont, CA). hNPS was also purchased from the same supplier for comparison with the homemade peptide. Cell culture media and supplements were from Invitrogen. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Data Analysis and Terminology—In vitro data were analyzed by nonlinear regression with GraphPad Prism software (Version 4.0) using the four-parameter logistic equation, allowing iterative fitting of the resultant responses. The data presented are the means of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate. The pharmacological terminology adopted in this study is in line with the recommendations of the International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (17Neubig R.R. Spedding M. Kenakin T. Christopoulos A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar): the agonist potencies are given as pEC50 = the negative logarithm to base 10 of the molar concentration of an agonist that produces 50% of the maximum possible effect. For in vivo data, locomotor activity was expressed both as impulses/5 min over the time course of the experiment and as cumulative impulses over the first and second 30-min observation periods. Differences between groups were assessed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison test. p < 0.05 versus saline (in vivo) or versus full-length hNPS (in vitro) was considered to be significantly different. HEK293/hNPSR Cell Line Characterization and Effects of Species-specific NPS Isoforms—A typical concentration-response curve for hNPS in this clonal hNPSR cell line is shown in Fig. 1. The in-house synthesized hNPS produced a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular calcium levels ([Ca2+]i), with a pEC50 of 8.39 ± 0.08 and an Emax corresponding to 3.7 ± 0.2-fold the basal fluorescence levels. Similar results in terms of both potency and maximum effects were obtained by testing the commercially available human NPS (pEC50 = 8.57 ± 0.09), mouse NPS (pEC50 = 8.66 ± 0.16), and rat NPS (pEC50 = 8.83 ± 0.17) as shown in Fig. 1. None of the above-mentioned peptides was able to induce Ca2+i mobilization in WT HEK293 cells (data not shown), whereas HEK293/hNPSR and WT HEK293 cells were similarly sensitive to the stimulatory effect of 10 μm carbachol (4.4 ± 0.8- and 4.2 ± 0.2-fold over basal levels, respectively), acting on a muscarinic receptor endogenously expressed in HEK293 cells. hNPS Ala-scan—Amino acid side chain contribution to the biological effect of hNPS was evaluated by systematic alanine replacement of each residue of the peptide primary sequence. Thus, 19 Ala-substituted hNPS analogs (Ala is present in the natural sequence at position 18) were synthesized and tested for their ability to stimulate Ca2+i mobilization in HEK293/hNPSR cells. The results of these experiments are summarized in Table 1. The Ala replacement of Ser1 did not significantly modify either peptide potency or efficacy. In contrast, the substitution of Phe2 with Ala generated an inactive analog. The substitution of Arg3 with Ala produced a statistically significant decrease in peptide potency and efficacy. In fact, the maximum effect elicited by [Ala3]hNPS was approximately half that produced by the naturally occurring peptide. The N4A substitution produced a dramatic loss of potency (at least 100-fold) because [Ala4]hNPS produced a weak stimulatory effect (26% of that produced by the natural peptide) on Ca2+i mobilization only at the highest concentration tested. Interestingly, the substitution of Gly7 with Ala generated a peptide with only a weak stimulatory effect (37% of that produced by hNPS) at the highest concentration tested. Ala substitutions from positions 8 to 20 did not significantly modify either the potency or efficacy of hNPS analogs.TABLE 1Ala-scan of hNPSCompoundPeptide sequenceAgonist effect1234567891011121314151617181920pEC50Emax%hNPSSFRNGVGTGMKKTSFQRAKS7.94 ± 0.03100[Ala1]hNPSA———————————————————7.79 ± 0.0985 ± 4[Ala2]hNPS—A——————————————————InactiveInactive[Ala3]hNPS——A—————————————————6.86 ± 0.09ap < 0.05 versus hNPS (ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test).49 ± 5ap < 0.05 versus hNPS (ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test).[Ala4]hNPS———A————————————————CRC incomplete25 ± 5[Ala5]hNPS————A———————————————7.51 ± 0.1389 ± 9[Ala6]hNPS—————A——————————————7.76 ± 0.1598 ± 5[Ala7]hNPS——————A—————————————CRC incomplete31 ± 7[Ala8]hNPS———————A————————————8.02 ± 0.1393 ± 11[Ala9]hNPS————————A———————————8.11 ± 0.1296 ± 7[Ala10]hNPS—————————A——————————8.09 ± 0.1097 ± 5[Ala11]hNPS——————————A—————————7.78 ± 0.1096 ± 5[Ala12]hNPS———————————A————————7.95 ± 0.1697 ± 5[Ala13]hNPS————————————A———————8.01 ± 0.1395 ± 9[Ala14]hNPS—————————————A——————7.92 ± 0.12105 ± 12[Ala15]hNPS——————————————A—————7.97 ± 0.15103 ± 18[Ala16]hNPS———————————————A————7.99 ± 0.1992 ± 4[Ala17]hNPS————————————————A———7.90 ± 0.1987 ± 4[Ala19]hNPS——————————————————A—8.03 ± 0.0995 ± 5[Ala20]hNPS———————————————————A7.98 ± 0.0794 ± 9a p < 0.05 versus hNPS (ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test). Open table in a new tab hNPS d-scan—The contribution of the spatial orientation of the amino acid side chain to the biological effect of hNPS was evaluated by systematic d-amino acid replacement of each residue of the peptide primary sequence. Thus, 17 hNPS analogs (the achiral residue Gly is present in the natural sequence at positions 5, 7, and 9) were synthesized and tested for their ability to stimulate Ca2+i mobilization in HEK293/hNPSR cells. The results of these experiments are summarized in Table 2. Whereas inversion of the chirality of Ser1 did not affect the potency and efficacy of the peptide, the chirality of Phe2, Arg3, and Asn4 seemed to be of high importance. Substitution of these amino acids with their respective enantiomers caused a statistically significant loss of potency (in the range of 10–30-fold). [d-Val6]hNPS produced a weak stimulatory effect (40% of that produced by the natural peptide) on Ca2+i mobilization only at the highest concentration tested. d-Amino acid substitution from positions 8 to 20 did not modify either the potency or efficacy of the peptides, producing hNPS analogs that behaved as potent full agonists.TABLE 2d-scan of hNPSCompoundPeptide sequenceAgonist effect1234567891011121314151617181920pEC50Emax%hNPSSFRNGVGTGMKKTSFQRAKS8.10 ± 0.24100[d-Ser1]hNPSs———————————————————7.81 ± 0.1290 ± 17[d-Phe2]hNPS—f——————————————————6.51 ± 0.30ap < 0.05 versus hNPS (ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test).109 ± 10[d-Arg3]hNPS——r—————————————————7.03 ± 0.14ap < 0.05 versus hNPS (ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test).106 ± 4[d-Asn4]hNPS———n————————————————7.12 ± 0.26ap < 0.05 versus hNPS (ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test).101 ± 5[d-Val6]hNPS—————v——————————————CRC incomplete40 ± 3[d-Thr8]hNPS———————t————————————7.92 ± 0.07112 ± 7[d-Met10]hNPS—————————m——————————7.80 ± 0.09100 ± 6[d-Lys11]hNPS——————————k—————————7.66 ± 0.14105 ± 3[d-Lys12]hNPS———————————k————————7.85 ± 0.1297 ± 8[d-Thr13]hNPS————————————t———————7.75 ± 0.17105 ± 3[d-Ser14]hNPS—————————————s——————7.90 ± 0.07101 ± 6[d-Phe15]hNPS——————————————f—————7.87 ± 0.1399 ± 8[d-Gln16]hNPS———————————————q————7.80 ± 0.20102 ± 8[d-Arg17]hNPS————————————————r———7.79 ± 0.1693 ± 4[d-Ala18]hNPS—————————————————a——7.83 ± 0.28105 ± 7[d-Lys19]hNPS——————————————————k—7.78 ± 0.1497 ± 6[d-Ser20]hNPS———————————————————s7.89 ± 0.15104 ± 11a p < 0.05 versus hNPS (ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test). Open table in a new tab hNPS N- and C-terminal Truncation—The contribution of the N- and C-terminal domains of the peptide to the biological effects of hNPS were investigated by progressive deletion of 10 residues from both sides. The results of these experiments are summarized in Table 3. The deletion of Ser1 produced a statistically significant reduction in the potency of the peptide without modifying its efficacy. Additional truncations of the N terminus eliminating Phe2 caused a dramatic loss of potency, rendering peptides inactive at the highest concentration tested (1 μm).TABLE 3N- and C-terminal truncation of hNPSCompoundPeptide sequenceAgonist effect1234567891011121314151617181920pEC50Emax%hNPSSFRNGVGTGMKKTSFQRAKS8.54 ± 0.03100hNPS-(2-20)FRNGVGTGMKKTSFQRAKS7.80 ± 0.11ap < 0.05 versus hNPS (ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test).107 ± 4hNPS-(3-20)RNGVGTGMKKTSFQRAKSInactiveInactivehNPS-(4-20)NGVGTGMKKTSFQRAKSInactiveInactivehNPS-(5-20)GVGTGMKKTSFQRAKSInactiveInactivehNPS-(6-20)VGTGMKKTSFQRAKSInactiveInactivehNPS-(7-20)GTGMKKTSFQRAKSInactiveInactivehNPS-(8-20)TGMKKTSFQRAKSInactiveInactivehNPS-(9-20)GMKKTSFQRAKSInactiveInactivehNPS-(10-20)MKKTSFQRAKSInactiveInactivehNPS-(11-20)KKTSFQRAKSInactiveInactivehNPS-(1-19)SFRNGVGTGMKKTSFQRAK8.52 ± 0.06102 ± 3hNPS-(1-18)SFRNGVGTGMKKTSFQRA8.52 ± 0.34103 ± 4hNPS-(1-17)SFRNGVGTGMKKTSFQR8.30 ± 0.31105 ± 5hNPS-(1-16)SFRNGVGTGMKKTSFQ8.64 ± 0.1198 ± 2hNPS-(1-15)SFRNGVGTGMKKTSF8.29 ± 0.15102 ± 2hNPS-(1-14)SFRNGVGTGMKKTS8.59 ± 0.03110 ± 5hNPS-(1-13)SFRNGVGTGMKKT8.45 ± 0.07109 ± 5hNPS-(1-12)SFRNGVGTGMKK8.39 ± 0.25103 ± 7hNPS-(1-11)SFRNGVGTGMK8.31 ± 0.4192 ± 3hNPS-(1-10)SFRNGVGTGM8.32 ± 0.06106 ± 2a p < 0.05 versus hNPS (ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test). Open table in a new tab The progressive deletion of single amino acids from the C terminus of the molecule from Ser20 to Lys11 did not affect either peptide potency or efficacy. In fact, hNPS-(1–10) produced a similar maximum effect and potency as the reference peptide hNPS-(1–20). N- and C-terminal Truncation of hNPS-(1–10)—As hNPS-(1–10) maintained the same biological activity of hNPS, we performed a second round of N- and C-terminal truncated peptide synthesis with hNPS-(1–10) aimed at the identification of the minimum sequence required for hNPSR activation. The results of these additional truncations are summarized in Table 4. A dramatic loss of potency was observed when Ser1 was deleted (hNPS-(2–10)). The elimination of Met10 and of Gly9-Met10 produced only slight reductions of potency of ∼3- and 5-fold, respectively. In contrast, the additional deletion of Thr8 caused a >100-fold loss of potency with hNPS-(1–7), displaying a pEC50 of <6. Similar results were obtained with the compounds in which the C terminus was further shortened.TABLE 4N- and C-terminal truncation of hNPS-(1–10)CompoundPeptide sequenceAgonist effect12345678910pEC50Emax%hNPS-(1-10)SFRNGVGTGM8.03 ± 0.06107 ± 2hNPS-(2-10)FRNGVGTGMCRC incomplete39 ± 15hNPS-(1-9)SFRNGVGTG7.77 ± 0.18103 ± 7hNPS-(1-8)SFRNGVGT7.33 ± 0.16ap < 0.05 versus hNPS (ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test).101 ± 4hNPS-(1-7)SFRNGVGCRC incomplete67 ± 7hNPS-(1-6)SFRNGVCRC incomple"
https://openalex.org/W2094950664,"The heme-binding proteins Shp and HtsA are part of the heme acquisition machinery found in Streptococcus pyogenes. The hexacoordinate heme (Fe(II)-protoporphyrin IX) or hemochrome form of holoShp (hemoShp) is stable in air in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, binds to apoHtsA with a Kd of 120 ± 18 μm, and transfers its heme to apoHtsA with a rate constant of 28 ± 6s–1 at 25 °C, pH 8.0. The hemoHtsA product then autoxidizes to the hexacoordinate hemin (Fe(III)-protoporphyrin IX) or hemichrome form (hemiHtsA) with an apparent rate constant of 0.017 ± 0.002 s–1. HemiShp also rapidly transfers hemin to apoHtsA through a hemiShp·apoHtsA complex (Kd = 48 ± 7 μm) at a rate ∼40,000 times greater than the rate of simple hemin dissociation from hemiShp into solvent (ktransfer = 43 ± 3s–1 versus k–hemin = 0.0003 ± 0.00006 s–1). The rate constants for hemin binding to and dissociation from HtsA (k′hemin ≈ 80 μm–1 s–1, k–hemin = 0.0026 ± 0.0002 s–1) are 50- and 10-fold greater than the corresponding rate constants for Shp (khemin ≈ 1.6 μm–1 s–1, k–hemin = 0.0003 s–1), which implies that HtsA has a more accessible active site. However, the affinity of apoHtsA for hemin (khemin ≈ 31,000 μm–1) is roughly 5-fold greater than that of apoShp (khemin ≈ 5,300 μm–1), accounting for the net transfer from Shp to HstA. These results support a direct, rapid, and affinity-driven mechanism of heme and hemin transfer from the cell surface receptor Shp to the ATP-binding cassette transporter system. The heme-binding proteins Shp and HtsA are part of the heme acquisition machinery found in Streptococcus pyogenes. The hexacoordinate heme (Fe(II)-protoporphyrin IX) or hemochrome form of holoShp (hemoShp) is stable in air in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, binds to apoHtsA with a Kd of 120 ± 18 μm, and transfers its heme to apoHtsA with a rate constant of 28 ± 6s–1 at 25 °C, pH 8.0.

HemiShp also rapidly transfers hemin to apoHtsA through a hemiShp·apoHtsA complex (Kd = 48 ± 7 μm) at a rate ∼40,000 times greater than the rate of simple hemin dissociation from hemiShp into solvent (ktransfer = 43 ± 3s–1 versus k–hemin = 0.0003 ± 0.00006 s–1). The rate constants for hemin binding to and dissociation from HtsA (k′hemin ≈ 80 μm–1 s–1, k–hemin = 0.0026 ± 0.0002 s–1) are 50- and 10-fold greater than the corresponding rate constants for Shp (khemin ≈ 1.6 μm–1 s–1, k–hemin = 0.0003 s–1), which implies that HtsA has a more accessible active site. However, the affinity of apoHtsA for hemin (khemin ≈ 31,000 μm–1) is roughly 5-fold greater than that of apoShp (khemin ≈ 5,300 μm–1), accounting for the net transfer from Shp to HstA. These results support a direct, rapid, and affinity-driven mechanism of heme and hemin transfer from the cell surface receptor Shp to the ATP-binding cassette transporter system. Heme is a major source of iron for bacterial pathogens (1Otto B.R. Verweij-van Vught A.M.J.J. MacLaren D.M. Crit. Rev.

Gram-negative bacteria contain outer membrane proteins that can sequester heme directly (4Chen C.J. Sparling P.F. Lewis L.A. Dyer D.W. Elkins C. Infect.

However, the molecular mechanisms by which the cell surface proteins pass the captured heme to the ABC transporter are incompletely understood. Streptococcus pyogenes is a Gram-positive bacterium that causes a variety of human diseases (13Cunningham M.W. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 13: 470-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar). This organism is capable of utilizing heme derived from human hemoproteins as a source of iron (14Francis Jr., R.T. Booth J.W. Becker R.R. Int. J. Biochem. 1985; 17: 767-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 15Eichenbaum Z. Muller E. Morse S.A. Scott J.R. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 5428-5429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It expresses two heme-binding proteins, HtsA (10Lei B. Liu M. Voyich J.M. Prater C.I. Kala S.V. DeLeo F.R. Musser J.M. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 5962-5969Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and Shp (11Lei B. Smoot L.M. Menning H.M. Voyich J.M. Kala S.V. DeLeo F.R. Reid S.D. Musser J.M. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 4494-4500Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). HtsA is the lipoprotein component of the heme-specific ABC transporter called HtsABC, whereas Shp is a cell surface protein. The genes encoding Shp and HtsABC are present at the same locus as an operon in the S. pyogenes chromosome (11Lei B. Smoot L.M. Menning H.M. Voyich J.M. Kala S.V. DeLeo F.R. Reid S.D. Musser J.M. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 4494-4500Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We have chosen Shp and HtsA as a model system to investigate how heme (Fe(II)-protoporphyrin IX) is transferred from a cell surface protein to a heme-specific ABC transporter in Gram-positive bacteria. In this system, heme-free Shp (apoShp) scavenges hemin (Fe(III)-protoporphyrin IX) that has dissociated from methemoglobin. Then holoShp rapidly transfers the iron porphyrin to apoHtsA (16Liu M. Lei B. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 5086-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this report, the mechanisms of both heme and hemin transfer from holoShp to apoHtsA were examined by measuring the kinetics of these processes and by characterizing each of the observed intermediates. The results reveal the rapid formation of a holoShp-apoHtsA complex and subsequent rapid internal heme or hemin transfer, which is driven by the higher affinity of HtsA for both heme and hemin. Proteins—Recombinant Shp was expressed in Escherichia coli harboring pSHP and purified by the method of Lei et al. (10Lei B. Liu M. Voyich J.M. Prater C.I. Kala S.V. DeLeo F.R. Musser J.M. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 5962-5969Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) with modifications. After DEAE chromatography, the partially purified Shp was dialyzed against 3 liters of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, loaded onto an SP-Sepharose column (1.5 × 6 cm), washed with 100 ml of Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and eluted with a 100-ml linear gradient of 0–0.25 m NaCl in Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, yielding holoShp in the reduced form with a purity of >95%, as assessed by SDS-PAGE. Since isolated holoShp contains a tightly bound hexacoordinate Fe(II)-protoporphyrin IX, which is called a hemochrome in the globin literature or a b-type heme in the cytochrome literature. Thus, this form of the protein is designated hemoShp. Alternatively, Shp from the DEAE column was dialyzed against 3 liters of 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, loaded onto an SP column (2.5 × 3 cm), washed with 100 ml of acetate buffer, eluted with a 100-ml linear gradient of 0–0.3 m NaCl in acetate buffer, yielding a tightly bound hexacoordinate Fe(III)-protoporphyrin IX or hemichrome form of Shp (hemiShp) with a purity of >95%. HemiShp was also prepared by oxidizing hemoShp with excess ferricyanide and removing any excess ferricyanide by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column (1.5 × 30 cm). As a control, hemoShp was also prepared from hemiShp by reduction with sodium dithionite and subsequent removal of excess dithionite and its products on a Sephadex G-25 column (1.5 × 30 cm). HemiShp or hemoShp samples prepared by these different methods have indistinguishable optical spectra and kinetics of hemin or heme transfer to apoHtsA. ApoShp was prepared as described previously (16Liu M. Lei B. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 5086-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). All proteins were stored in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at –20 °C prior to experiments. Recombinant HtsA was isolated from E. coli harboring pLP1795 (10Lei B. Liu M. Voyich J.M. Prater C.I. Kala S.V. DeLeo F.R. Musser J.M. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 5962-5969Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) as a mixture of apoprotein (apoHtsA) and a small amount of hemin-containing holoprotein (10Lei B. Liu M. Voyich J.M. Prater C.I. Kala S.V. DeLeo F.R. Musser J.M. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 5962-5969Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). ApoHtsA was isolated and reconstituted with bovine hemin chloride (Sigma) as previously described (16Liu M. Lei B. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 5086-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, apoHtsA was incubated with hemin at a 1:2 HtsA/hemin molar ratio for 15 min at room temperature. To remove excess hemin, the sample was loaded onto a Sephadex G-25 column (1.5 × 20 cm), and holoHtsA was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The reduced and oxidized forms of HtsA exhibit UV-visible spectra characteristic of hexacoordinate hemochrome and hemichrome complexes and are designated hemoHtsA and hemiHtsA, respectively. Autoxidation of HtsA—HemiHtsA (500 μl of 7 μm) was reduced to hemoHtsA with ∼2 mg of dithionite, and excess dithionite and its oxidation products were removed by a semidry G-25 spin column. To prepare the semidry column, a G-25 column (1.5 × 10 cm) was equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and centrifuged in a swinging rotor at 300 × g for 15 s. The reduced hemoHtsA sample was then loaded onto the semidry column, and the column was spun at 300 × g for 15 s to obtain dithionite-free HtsA. The reduced sample was then immediately placed in a cuvette, and autoxidation of hemoHtsA was monitored by measuring the change in absorbance at 424 nm at room temperature. EPR Measurement—EPR spectra of hemoShp, hemiShp, and hemiHtsA were recorded with a Varian E-6 spectrometer. The conditions for EPR measurements were as follows: frequency, 9.27 GHz; power, 3 milliwatts; modulation amplitude, 10 G; the modulation frequency, 100 kHz; and temperature, 4.2 K. The high spin signal at g = 6 was quantified by double integration between 800 and 1,700 G and comparison with the signal of a high spin sperm whale metmyoglobin at pH 7 (Mb(Fe(III)·H2O)). Quantification of the low spin signals was based on comparison of the area of the g = 3 absorption-like signal with the analogous low spin signal of metmyglobin at pH 9.5 (Mb(Fe(III)OH) at known concentration. To assess the oxidation states of the proteins during the heme transfer reaction, ∼300 μm hemoShp was reacted with 370 μm apoHtsA, frozen at ∼30 s after mixing by quick immersion in a methanol/dry ice bath at –58 °C, and stored in liquid nitrogen. The EPR spectrum of the sample was recorded as described above. The sample was then warmed to room temperature, incubated for 30 min, and refrozen, and the final EPR spectrum was recorded. A similar experiment was carried out starting with ∼300 μm hemiShp and ∼370 μm apoHtsA. Kinetic Experiments—A stopped-flow spectrophotometer (SX18.MV; Applied Photophysics) was used at Montana State University to measure the rate of heme transfer from hemoShp to apoHtsA, the rate of hemin transfer from hemiShp to apoHtsA, and the binding of hemin to apoShp or apoHtsA under pseudo-first-order conditions. In the heme/hemin transfer measurements, one syringe contained 4 μm holoprotein, and the other contained apoprotein at ≥20 μm in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. In the hemin binding measurements, initial concentrations of hemin and apoprotein were 2 μm and ≥10 μm, respectively. Changes in absorbance were measured at wavelengths appropriate for each reaction, as indicated under “Results.” Each time course represents the average of 10 consecutive traces for each condition and was analyzed by fitting the observed data to a single exponential expression using Applied Photophysics software to obtain pseudo-first-order rate constants. The dependence of these rate constants on apoprotein concentration was analyzed using the reaction models presented in Schemes I and II to obtain the specific rate parameters described in Equations 1 and 4. Entire spectra were also recorded during hemin and heme transfer using an OLIS RSM 1000 stopped-flow spectrophotometer at Rice University, and the observed time courses were similar to those obtained in the Applied Photophysics apparatus at a single wavelength. Heme Transfer in the Absence of Oxygen—HemoShp (3.6 μm) was mixed with an equal volume of 15 μm apoHtsA anaerobically in the presence of excess dithionite in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The spectrum of the mixture was recorded ∼5 s after mixing using A SPECTRAmax 384 Plus spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The time course of this anerobic reaction was monitored at 424 nm using the Applied Photophysics stopped-flow apparatus. Rates of Hemin Dissociation from HemiShp and HemiHtsA—The rates of hemin dissociation from hemiShp and hemiHtsA were measured using H64Y/V68F apomyoglobin as a hemin scavenger according to the method of Hargrove et al. (17Hargrove M.S. Singleton E.W. Quillin M.L. Ortiz L.A. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4207-4214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The apomyoglobin was prepared using the methyl ethyl ketone method (18Ascoli F. Fanelli M.R. Antonini E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 72-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). HemiShp or hemiHtsA (5 μm) was incubated with 50 μm apomyoglobin in 1 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and the change in absorbance at 602 nm was monitored for up to 50 min. The ΔA602 time courses were fit to a single exponential equation to obtain the first-order rate constant. Other Assays and Measurements—HtsA and Shp protein concentrations were measured using a modified Lowry protein assay kit (Pierce), with bovine serum albumin as a standard, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Heme or hemin content of Shp and HtsA was determined using a pyridine hemochrome assay (19Fuhrhop J.H. Smith K.M. Smith K.M. Porphyrins and Metalloporphyrins. Elsevier Publishing Co., New York1975: 804-807Google Scholar). Each protein, diluted in 750 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl was combined with 175 μl of pyridine, 75 μl of 1 n NaOH, and ∼2 mg of sodium hydrosulfite. Absorbance at 418 nm was measured immediately after mixing, and the extinction coefficient, ϵ418 = 191.5 mm–1 cm–1, was used to determine heme/hemin concentrations. A SPECTRAmax 384 Plus spectrophotometer was used for absorption measurements, unless otherwise specified. Oxidation States of HtsA and Shp—The absorption and EPR spectra of holoShp are shown in Fig. 1. Shp expressed and purified from E. coli using DEAE and SP-Sepharose columns at pH 8.0 has a strong Soret absorption peak at 428 nm and two additional peaks at 528 and 560 nm (solid curve in Fig. 1A). This spectrum is only seen for reduced b-type cytochromes but not for their oxidized forms (20Trevaskis B. Watts R.A. Andersson C.R. Llewellyn D.J. Hargrove M.S. Olson J.S. Dennis E.S. Peacock J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12230-12234Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 21Hargrove M.S. Brucker E.A. Stec B. Sarath G. Arrendondo-Peter R. Klucas R.V. Olson J.S. Phillips Jr., G.N. Structure. 2000; 8: 1005-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), indicating that holoShp purified at pH 8.0 is in a hemochrome form. Oxidation of hemoShp was readily achieved by the addition of ferricyanide at pH 8.0 and, after removal of excess ferricyanide, can be seen as a shift of the Soret peak from 428 to 420 nm and replacement of the distinct 528- and 560-nm peaks with a broad band at 530 nm and a weaker one at 570 nm (dotted curve in Fig. 1B). The spectral properties of hemiShp prepared by ferricyanide treatment are almost identical to those of hemiShp purified at pH 5.5 (Fig. 1B). The addition of dithionite to either of the hemiShp samples instantly results in the hemochrome visible spectrum (Fig. 1A). Shp remains in the hemochrome form in air-saturated Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, after removal of excess dithionite (Fig. 1A), consistent with the observation that purified hemoShp is stable in Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for weeks in the cold. These results indicate that hemoShp is not sensitive to autoxidation at pH 8.0 but that the conversions between the two oxidation states can be readily achieved by dithionite and ferricyanide. EPR measurements confirmed the oxidation states of holoShp and their transition. Purified hemoShp (Fig. 1C) and dithionite-derived hemoShp lack any significant EPR signal, whereas ferricyanide-treated holoShp displays strong EPR signals at 4.2 K, which suggest three different populations of the hemin Fe(III) (Fig. 1C), all of which are spectrally distinct from the EPR signal of ferricyanide. These results confirm unambiguously that, when purified at high pH, hemoShp is present initially in a stable reduced state and oxidized readily by ferricyanide. Approximately 2% of Fe(III) in hemiShp is in a high spin state, characterized by an axial field with g⊥ = 5.58 and g∥ = 2.00. The dominant population (∼80%) exhibits a low spin signal with the rhombic symmetry. However, only gz = 3.09 could be accurately determined for this component, because the other two transitions (gy and gx) are obscured by overlap with absorption from a third iron species. The third Fe(III) component (15–20%) is also low spin but exhibits more axial symmetry and is characterized by a g⊥ = 2.1 transition. Although complex, the EPR spectrum for oxidized holoShp clearly supports the view that bound hemin is coordinated by pairs of two strong axial ligands. The spectrum of hemiHtsA shows an intense Soret band at 412 nm and strong and weak absorption bands at 530 and 570 nm, respectively (Fig. 2A), which are similar to those of hemiShp, model hemichrome compounds, and oxidized b-type cytochromes. Reduction of hemiHtsA with excess dithionite generates a spectrum with peaks at 424, 528, and 558 nm (Fig. 2A), which are characteristic of a hemochrome or a reduced b-type cytochrome. However, gel filtration of the hemoHtsA/ dithionite mixture results in only hemiHtsA (Fig. 2A), indicating that hemoHtsA is unstable and autoxidizes rapidly in air. The EPR spectrum of hemiHtsA is shown in Fig. 2B. There appear to be two forms of oxidized hemin iron. Approximately 10% of the ferric iron is in a high spin state with g⊥ = 5.73 and g∥ = 2.00, and about 90% of the iron is in a low spin state with g factors equal to 2.94, 2.29, and 2.02. Although the derivative signal near g ≈ 6 appears large (Fig. 2B), its integrated intensity is quite small (10%) compared with a high spin Mb(Fe(III)·H2O) control at an equivalent total iron concentration. In contrast, the integrated intensity of the low spin signal is about 90% of that of our low spin Mb(Fe(III)·OH) control at the same total iron concentration (Fig. 2B). The g values of the low spin signal for hemiHtsA can be used to define the putative axial coordination of the iron. Using the method of Blumberg and Peisach (22Blumberg W.E. Peisach J. Adv. Chem. Ser. 1971; 100: 271-291Crossref Google Scholar), we calculated an axial field of 2.87 and a rhombicity of 0.73 for hemiHtsA. These two parameters define a point in the “truth diagram” (23Palmer G. Lawrence Jr., Q. Physical Methods in Bioinorganic Chemistry: Spectroscopy and Magnetism. University Science Books, Sausalito, CA2000: 121-186Google Scholar), and the point fell in the region occupied by b-type cytochromes and hexacoordinate hemoglobins with two axial N ligands, which are normally but not always bis-His complexes. Unfortunately, in the case of ferric holoShp, only one of the three g values could be identified from its EPR spectrum, and thus, we cannot identify the axial ligands in holoShp without structural studies. Heme Transfer from Shp to HtsA—When hemoShp is mixed with apoHtsA, there is a rapid shift in the Soret peak from 428 to 424 nm with little change in the visible wavelength region from 500 to 600 nm (Fig. 3A), suggesting the transfer of heme to apoHtsA without any oxidation of the iron atom. The half-time of this heme transfer reaction is on the order of 20–200 ms and depends on [apoHtsA]. This rapid spectral change is followed by a slower process, which involves a further blue shift in the Soret peak from 424 to 414 nm and marked decreases in the 530- and 560-nm peaks, suggesting autoxidation of hemoHtsA (Fig. 3B). To verify this interpretation, hemoShp was mixed with apoHtsA at ∼300 μm total heme in an EPR tube and frozen 30 s after mixing. The EPR spectrum of this mixture showed only a small amount of oxidation, indicating that most of the iron atoms were still reduced (Fig. 3C). More importantly, the weak low spin signal is similar to that of hemiHtsA but not that of hemiShp. When the Shp/HtsA reaction mixture was thawed, allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 min, and then refrozen, the strong, primarily lowspin signal of hemiHtsA was observed (Fig. 3C). Both the g ≈ 2 and 5.9 signals were much higher at 30 min than at 30 s, indicating that the slow absorbance changes shown in Fig. 3B correlate with the appearance of the oxidized hemiHtsA EPR signal. These results demonstrate that autoxidation of hemoHtsA is occurring after the hemochrome is transferred from hemoShp to apoHtsA. Thus, hemoHtsA appears to be formed within seconds after mixing hemoShp and apoHtsA. To test this idea, hemoShp was mixed anaerobically with apoHtsA in the presence of excess dithionite to prevent autoxidation. The spectrum of this mixture was recorded 5 s after mixing using a conventional spectrometer and is almost identical to that of hemoHtsA obtained by reducing hemiHtsA but is significantly different from that of hemoShp (Fig. 4A). The time course for hemoHtsA formation was monitored under similar conditions by measuring the change in absorbance at 420 nm using a stopped-flow spectrophotometer. The transfer reaction is complete within 5 s, and no further changes occur (Fig. 4B). The absorbance change corresponds to the rapid spectral shift shown in Fig. 3A, and the slow blue shift shown in Fig. 3B is not observed in the absence of oxygen. These results firmly establish that the rapid and slow phases of spectral changes seen when mixing hemoShp with apoHtsA are the rapid formation and subsequent slow autoxidation of hemoHtsA, respectively. When hemiShp is reacted with apoHtsA, only a small rapid shift in the Soret peak from 420 to 412 nm is observed (Fig. 5A). To prove that these spectral changes represent hemin transfer, an EPR sample was prepared by mixing hemiShp with apoHtsA, freezing the sample 30 s after mixing, recording its EPR spectrum at 4 K, thawing, refreezing 30 min later, and recording a final EPR spectrum. In this case, the EPR spectra recorded 30 s and 30 min after mixing were similar to those of hemiHtsA but not those of hemiShp (Fig. 5B). Thus, the reaction of hemiShp with apoHtsA involves one spectral transition, representing the transfer of hemin without any changes in redox state and suggesting that Shp and HtsA have different ligand(s) at one or both axial positions. Kinetics of Heme Transfer from HoloShp to ApoHtsA—A minimal model for the heme transfer from hemoShp to apoHtsA is given in Scheme I and based on the optical absorption and EPR results shown so far. In the model, hemoShp forms a complex with apoHtsA, and heme is then directly transferred to apoHtsA to yield apoShp and hemoHtsA, which subsequently autoxidizes to hemiHtsA. In this scheme, dissociation of the apoShp-hemoHtsA complex is undetectable by spectral measurements and is assumed to be too rapid to affect the slow autoxidation of hemoHtsA. hemoShp+apoHtsA⇌k2(very rapid)k1hemoShp−apoHtsA⇀ktransferapoShp+hemoHtsA↙kautoxhemiHtsASCHEME I Time courses for heme and hemin transfer were measured at single wavelengths, 420 and 414 nm, respectively, in a stopped-flow spectrophotometer by mixing holoShp with varying concentrations of apoHtsA. In the case of the transfer from hemoShp, the absorbance at 420 nm (A420) increased rapidly and then slowly decreased over a period of several hundred seconds, as the resultant hemoHtsA autoxidized at 25 °C in air (Fig. 6A). The fast phase was a single exponential process and was complete a few seconds after mixing (Fig. 6B). The pseudo-first-order rate constant (kobs) of the fast phase increased hyperbolically with increasing [apoHtsA] (Fig. 6C), suggesting the rapid formation of a holoShp-apoHtsA complex followed by a rate-limiting and first-order transfer of heme to apoHtsA as described in Scheme I. When the initial [apoHtsA] is ≥5[hemoShp], the heme transfer is a pseudo-first-order process. The expression for the observed rate constant, kobs, is given by Equation 1, kobs=ktransfer[apoHtsA](k2+ktransfer)/k1+[apoHtsA]≈ktransfer[apoHtsA]kd+[apoHtsA](Eq. 1) where Kd is the dissociation constant of the hemoShp-apoHtsA complex, and k1, k2, and ktransfer are the rate constants of the individual reactions proposed in Scheme I. As shown in Fig. 6C, the observed dependence of kobs on [apoHtsA] is described quantitatively by Equation 1, with fitted values of ktransfer and Kd equal to 28 ± 6s–1 and 120 ± 18 μm, respectively (Table 1).TABLE 1Rate constants and activation parameters for heme and hemin transfer from holoShp to apoHtsAKinetic parameterHemeHemink2/k1 or KdaThe values for k2/k1 and ktransfer at 25 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0 were obtained from fits of the dependence of the observed rates of transfer on [apoHtsA] to Equation 1.120 ± 18 μm48 ± 7 μmktransferaThe values for k2/k1 and ktransfer at 25 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0 were obtained from fits of the dependence of the observed rates of transfer on [apoHtsA] to Equation 1.28 ± 6 s-143 ± 3 s-1ΔH0complexbThe standard entropy, enthalpy, and free energy for the formation of the holoShp-apoHtsA complexes were obtained by analyzing the dependence of Kassociation (1/Kd) on temperature according to the van't Hoff plot.-77 ± 9 kJ/mol-37 ± 6 kJ/molΔS0complexbThe standard entropy, enthalpy, and free energy for the formation of the holoShp-apoHtsA complexes were obtained by analyzing the dependence of Kassociation (1/Kd) on temperature according to the van't Hoff plot.-182 ± 30 J/mol K-37 ± 18 J/mol KΔG0complexbThe standard entropy, enthalpy, and free energy for the formation of the holoShp-apoHtsA complexes were obtained by analyzing the dependence of Kassociation (1/Kd) on temperature according to the van't Hoff plot.-23 kJ/mol-26 kJ/molΔS≠ for ktransfercThe activation entropy, enthalpy, and free energy were obtained by analyzing the dependence of ktransfer on temperature according to the Eyring equation.250 ± 25 J/(K·mol)35 ± 4 J/(K·mol)ΔH≠ for ktransfercThe activation entropy, enthalpy, and free energy were obtained by analyzing the dependence of ktransfer on temperature according to the Eyring e"

In the initial stages of disease, monocytes transmigrate into the subendothelial space and differentiate into foam cells. Scavenger receptors and ATP binding cassette (ABC) Transporters play an important role in foam cell formation as they regulate the influx and efflux of oxidized lipids. Here, we show that peritoneal macrophages isolated from Type 2 diabetic db/db mice have decreased expression of the ABC transporter ABCG1 and increased expression of the scavenger receptor CD36. We found a 2-fold increase in accumulation of esterified cholesterol in diabetic db/db macrophages compared with wild-type control macrophages. Diabetic db/db macrophages also had impaired cholesterol efflux to high density lipoprotein but not to lipid-free apo A-I, suggesting that the increased esterified cholesterol in diabetic db/db macrophages was due to a selective loss of ABCG1-mediated efflux to high density lipoprotein. Additionally, we were able to confirm down-regulation of ABCG1 using C57BL/6J peritoneal macrophages cultured in elevated glucose in vitro (25 mm glucose for 7 days), suggesting that ABCG1 expression in diabetic macrophages is regulated by chronic exposure to elevated glucose. Diabetic KKay mice were also studied and were found to have decreased ABCG1 expression without an increase in CD36. These observations demonstrate that ABCG1 plays a major role in macrophage cholesterol efflux and that decreased ABCG1 function can facilitate foam cell formation in Type 2 diabetic mice.

A pivotal event in atherogenesis occurs when monocytes adhere to endothelium and transmigrate into the subendothelial space, where they differentiate into macrophages. Upon differentiation, macrophages express the scavenger receptors CD36 and SR-A. Expression of these scavenger receptors allows macrophages to take up modified lipoproteins (3Horiuchi S. Sakamoto Y.

The scavenger receptors CD36 and SR-A have been shown to bind and internalize ox-LDL and are key receptors in the development of atherosclerotic lesions, as mice lacking these receptors show a decrease in atherosclerosis (5Kunjathoor V.V.

Likewise, members of the ATP binding cassette transporter family (ABC transporters) are known regulators of cholesterol efflux (9Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. J.

ABCG1 is highly expressed in lipid-loaded macrophages and mediates cholesterol efflux to HDL, whereas ABCA1 mediates cholesterol efflux to lipid-free apoA-I (12Klucken J. Buchler C. Orso E.

While much is known about the roles these proteins play in macrophage foam cell formation and the development of atherosclerosis, little is known about how cholesterol homeostasis in macrophages is altered in the setting of Type 2 diabetes. In an effort to better understand mechanisms contributing to foam cell formation in Type 2 diabetes, we examined macrophages from two well known models of Type 2 diabetes, the db/db mouse and the KKay mouse. The db/db mouse is obese, hyperinsulinemic, and hyperglycemic due to a defect in the leptin receptor gene (14Chen H. Charlat O. Tartaglia L.A. Woolf E.A. Weng X. Ellis S.J. Lakey N.D. Culpepper J.

The KKay mouse is a Type 2 diabetes model that arose spontaneously by crossing the KK parent strain with the Ay/a strain (16Nakamura M. Yamada K. Diabetologia. 1967; 3: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The KKay mouse is also hyperglycemic, hyperinsulinemic, and obese. In the current study, we show that macrophage foam cell formation is increased in these mouse models of Type 2 diabetes and that this is due, at least in part, to decreased cholesterol efflux. Furthermore, we report for the first time that ABCG1 mRNA and protein levels are significantly reduced in macrophages from Type 2 diabetic mice and that ABCG1 levels in diabetic macrophages are regulated by chronic elevated glucose. Reagents—FBS was ordered from HyClone (Logan, UT). Thioglycollate medium, Oil Red O, and mouse anti-tubulin antibody were obtained from Sigma. Oxidized LDL was generated by copper sulfate oxidation and was a kind gift from Dr. Judy Berliner (UCLA). NuPAGE 4-12% denaturing gels came from Invitrogen. Mouse anti-CD36 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies came from Amersham Biosciences UK Ltd. (Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK). An anti-ABCG1 antibody designed to recognize the C-terminal end of murine ABCG1 was synthesized for our laboratory by Washington Biotechnology, Inc. (Columbia, MD). Mice—10-Week-old Leprdb/db (Bb.Cg-m+/+Leprdb) knockout mice (stock no. 000697) and their controls, C57BL6/J (stock no. 000664), KK.Cg-Ay/J (stock no. 002468), and a/a control littermates were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were fed a standard rodent chow diet or a Western diet (Teklad TD88137) for 10 weeks and housed in microisolator cages in a pathogen-free facility. All experiments followed University of Virginia Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines, and approval for use of rodents was obtained from the University of Virginia. Peritoneal Macrophage Isolation—Hyperglycemic db/db or KKay mice and their normoglycemic controls were injected with 2 ml of 3% thioglycollate medium. On day 5 post-injection, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and injected intraperitoneally with 5 ml cold PBS with 10 mm EDTA. The PBS was then removed with a syringe and the process repeated three times. Macrophages from each mouse were plated separately in RPMI/10% FBS overnight. The following morning, nonadherent cells were removed by aspiration and the remaining macrophages were washed thoroughly with PBS and used for experiments. Glucose Studies—Peritoneal macrophages were isolated from C57BL/6J mice and were cultured for up to 7 days in either 5.5 mm d-glucose (normal glucose), 25 mm d-glucose (high glucose), or 25 mm l-glucose in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS. Medium was replaced on days 1, 3, 5, and 7, and glucose measurements were made. Glucose concentrations did not drop below 4.0 mm in the normal glucose samples or below 23 mm in the high glucose samples during the time course. RNA was isolated from the cells at various time points, as indicated in the legend to Fig. 4, using TRIzol. We examined a dose-response curve of glucose and found that ABCG1 expression was altered by concentrations greater than 20 mm glucose (data not shown). We chose 25 mm as our concentration for studies based on the dose curve and upon previous work in our laboratory (17Srinivasan S. Hatley M.E. Bolick D.T. Palmer L.A. Edelstein D. Brownlee M. Hedrick C.C. Diabetologia. 2004; 47: 1727-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting for CD36 and ABCG1—RIPA buffer was added to peritoneal macrophages to generate whole cell lysates. The lysates were collected, briefly sonicated, and quantified using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, then transferred to nitrocellulose and blocked for 2 h with Blocker-BLOTTO (Pierce). Fifty μg of whole cell lysate was used for detection of all proteins. For detection of CD36, blots were incubated in Tris-buffered saline + 1% Tween 20 (TBST) containing a 1:200 dilution of anti-mouse CD36 antibody overnight at 4 °C. Blots were then incubated with 1:4000 dilution of horseradish peroxidaseconjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody. To detect ABCG1, blots were incubated with Blocker-BLOTTO containing a 1:250 dilution of anti-mouse ABCG1 antibody overnight at 4 °C. Blots were then incubated with a 1:4000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Proteins were visualized using chemiluminescence and normalized to tubulin as a control for gel loading. Densitometry was performed using Stratagene Zero D-Scan densitometry software. Macrophage Foam Cell Formation—To generate foam cells, freshly isolated peritoneal macrophages from Type 2 diabetic and control mice were plated on chamber slides in RPMI/10% FBS and incubated with 100 μg/ml ox-LDL at 37 °C for 72 h. Oil Red O staining was used to visualize lipids (18Sheehan D.C. Hrapchack B.B. Theory and Practice of Histology. C.V. Mosby Co., St. Louis, MO1980: 159-161Google Scholar). Foam Cell Formation in Vivo—Peritoneal macrophages were isolated from control a/a and diabetic KKay mice fed the Western diet for 10 weeks as described (19Li A.C. Binder C.J. Gutierrez A. Brown K.K.

Quantitative Real-time PCR—Total cellular RNA was collected from macrophages using TRIzol Reagent following the manufacturer's protocol. 2 μg of cDNA was then synthesized using an Iscript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Total cDNA was diluted 1:5 in H2O, and 2 μl were used for each real-time condition using a Bio-Rad MyIQ single color real-time PCR detection system and iQ SYBR Green supermix (Bio-Rad). Primer sequences are listed in Table 1. Samples were normalized to cyclophilin using the ΔCt method.TABLE 1Quantitative real-time PCR primers used in this studyNameSequenceABCG1Forward 5′-TTC CCC TGG AGA TGA GTG TC-3′Reverse 5′-CAG TAG GCC ACA GGG AAC AT-3′ABCA1Forward 5′-CGT TTC CGG GAA GTG TCC TA-3′Reverse 5′-GCT AGA GAT GAC AAG GAG GAT GGA-3′CD36Forward 5′-CCT TAA AGG AAT CCC CGT GT-3′Reverse 5′-TGC ATT TGC CAA TGT CTA GC-3′SR AForward 5′-CAT GAA CGA GAG GAT GCT GAC T-3′Reverse 5′-GGA AGG GAT GCT GTC ATT GAA-3′LOX-1Forward 5′-CCT CTG CCT GGT GTT GTC-3′Reverse 5′-CCT GCT CTT TGG ATT TCT CG-3′CyclophilinForward 5′-TGG AGA GCA CCA AGA CAG ACA-3′Reverse 5′-TGC CGG AGT CGA CAA TGA T-3′ Open table in a new tab Total and Esterified Cholesterol Determinations—Macrophages were scraped into tubes and pelleted by low spin centrifugation. After several washes with PBS, the cell pellet was extracted with chloroform:methanol (2:1) containing 5α-cholestane as internal standard. Total and free cholesterol content was determined by gas-liquid chromatography and normalized to cellular protein as described previously (20Rudel L.L. Kelley K. Sawyer J.K. Shah R. Wilson M.D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1818-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Esterified cholesterol was calculated as the difference between total and free cholesterol. ABCG1 siRNA Studies—The following ABCG1 siRNA sequences were designed and spliced into the pSuper expression vector (Oligoengine, Seattle, WA): 5′-CGTGGATGAGGTTGAGACA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGTGGACAACAACTTCACA-3′ (reverse). 0.5 μg of siRNA plasmid vector was used per 106 cells transfected using Nucleofector technology (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD). Transfection efficiency was ∼65% as measured by green fluorescent protein transfection. Knockdown was measured using quantitative real-time PCR with sequences designed to cover the ABCG1 siRNA splice sequence: 5′-CAACGTGGATGAGGTGTAGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTTCCCAGAGATCCCTTTCA-3′ (reverse). Samples were normalized to cyclophilin. Efflux Assays—Cholesterol efflux assays were performed as described, with minor modification (21Wang N. Silver D.L. Thiele C. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23742-23747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages were plated in 12-well plates at a density of 6 × 105 cells/well. Cells were radiolabeled with 2 μCi/ml of [3H]cholesterol for 24 h in the presence of 10% FBS medium and then equilibrated for2hinthe presence of serum-free medium containing 0.2% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin (BSA). Cholesterol efflux was conducted for 24 h at 37 °C in medium containing: 1) 0.2% BSA, 2) 0.2% BSA + 15 μg/ml lipid-free human ApoA-I, or 3) 0.2% BSA + 50 μg of protein/ml of human HDL. Human apoA-I and HDL were isolated as described previously (22Nichols A.V. Gong E.L. Blanche P.J. Forte T.M. Anderson D.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 446: 226-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 23Parks J.S. Rudel L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6716-6723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The efflux medium was then removed and a 400 μl aliquot was taken for 3H radioactivity determination. Adherent cells were rinsed twice with cold PBS and 1 ml of isopropyl alcohol was added for overnight extraction at room temperature. A 100-μl aliquot of the extract was taken for 3H radioactivity determination. Results are expressed as [3H]cholesterol in medium/mg total cell protein. Specific efflux to apoA-I or HDL was calculated by subtracting nonspecific efflux in the presence of 0.2% BSA only. Plasma Lipoprotein Analysis—Mice were fasted for 4 h prior to obtaining blood via the retroorbital sinus. Plasma glucose levels were measured using a One Touch UltraSmart glucometer (Lifescan, Milpitas, CA). Plasma insulin levels were analyzed using a radioimmunoassay kit (Linco, St. Charles, MO). Plasma lipid levels were determined by the University of Virginia Clinical Pathology Laboratory. For plasma lipoprotein analysis of mice fed a Western diet, plasma samples from 8 mice/group were pooled. Plasma lipoproteins were fractionated using FPLC according to the method of Daugherty et al. (24Daugherty A. Manning M.W. Cassis L.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). Statistical Analyses—Data for all experiments were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) using the Statview 6.0 software program. Comparisons between groups were performed using ANOVA methods. Data are graphically represented as mean ± S.E., in which each mean consists of six experiments performed in quadruplicate (unless noted otherwise in the figure legends) using cells isolated from 8 mice per group. Comparisons between groups and tests of interactions were made assuming a two-factor analysis with the interaction term testing each main effect with the residual error testing the interaction. All comparisons were made using Fisher's least standard difference procedure, so that multiple comparisons were made at the 0.05 level only if the overall F-test from the ANOVA was significant at p < 0.05. Foam Cell Formation Is Increased in Diabetic db/db Macrophages—We examined the ability of diabetic db/db macrophages to form foam cells in response to oxidized LDL uptake. Peritoneal macrophages were isolated from mice maintained on a rodent chow diet. We incubated control, nondiabetic C57BL6/J (B6) macrophages and diabetic db/db macrophages with 100 μg/ml oxidized LDL for 72 h and examined foam cell formation using Oil red O staining of lipid. We found increased foam cell formation in db/db macrophages compared with B6 macrophages (Fig. 1A). Increased Cholesterol Ester Content of Diabetic db/db Macrophages—We measured the amount of esterified cholesterol content from both control B6 and diabetic db/db macrophages before and after incubation with oxLDL. Although no difference in esterified cholesterol was observed prior to incubation with oxLDL, we found approximately a 4-fold increase in esterified cholesterol content in diabetic db/db macrophages compared with control macrophages after incubation with oxLDL (Fig. 1B). The amount of free cholesterol in the macrophages was similar between B6 and db/db macrophages (Fig. 1C). CD36 Expression Is Post-transcriptionally Regulated in db/db Mice—To examine factors contributing to increased foam cell formation in db/db mice, we investigated the expression of candidate molecules known to be important in macrophage cholesterol trafficking. We examined representative members of three scavenger receptor subtypes, SR-A1, CD36, and LOX-1. SR-A and CD36 are responsible for ∼75-90% of oxidized-LDL uptake in macrophages (5Kunjathoor V.V. Febbraio M. Podrez E.A. Moore K.J. Andersson L. Koehn S. Rhee J.S. Silverstein R. Hoff H.F. Freeman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49982-49988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Using real-time quantitative PCR, we found that there were no significant differences in mRNA expression of either SR-A or CD36 in diabetic peritoneal macrophages, although there was a consistent trend toward increased CD36 mRNA expression in diabetic db/db macrophages (data not shown). LOX-1 mRNA expression was minimal in B6 macrophages but was fairly robust in diabetic db/db macrophages (data not shown). We then examined protein expression of SR-A1, CD36, and LOX-1. We found a significant 3-fold increase in CD36 on diabetic db/db macrophages (Fig. 2). These data are consistent with those of Tall and colleagues (25Liang C.P. Han S. Okamoto H. Carnemolla R. Tabas I. Accili D. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 764-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), who recently reported translational regulation of CD36 in ob/ob diabetic macrophages. Unfortunately, we were unable to find reliable, commercially available anti-mouse antibodies for either SR-A or LOX-1. Thus, we could not verify whether the increased levels of LOX-1 mRNA in diabetic db/db macrophages actually correlated with an increase in LOX-1 protein. However, taken together, our data suggest that cholesterol uptake in db/db macrophages is due, in part, to up-regulation of CD36 and possibly LOX-1 in the setting of Type 2 diabetes. ABCG1 Expression Is Reduced in Diabetic db/db Mice—Additional candidate molecules important in regulation of cellular cholesterol trafficking include members of the ABC transporter family, namely ABCG1, ABCG4, and ABCA1. We measured mRNA expression of these transporters in both control B6 and diabetic db/db macrophages. We found minimal expression of ABCG4 in control and diabetic macrophages (data not shown). Furthermore, we found only a small reduction (∼20%) in ABCA1 mRNA levels in db/db macrophages (Fig. 3A). However, expression of ABCG1 mRNA was significantly reduced by 70% in db/db macrophages (Fig. 3A). We examined protein expression of ABCG1 in macrophages and also found a 60% decrease in ABCG1 protein in db/db macrophages (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these results suggest that the increased foam cell formation observed in diabetic db/db mice is due to both increased surface expression of CD36 and dramatic down-regulation of ABCG1 expression. Glucose Regulates ABCG1 Expression in Macrophages—We next examined whether the changes in CD36 and ABCG1 expression observed in diabetic db/db macrophages were caused by elevated glucose. We cultured freshly isolated peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6J mice in normal glucose (5.5 mm) and 25 mm glucose for 7 days. We then measured mRNA levels for CD36 and ABCG1 over the 7 days time period using real-time quantitative PCR. We observed a 50% reduction in ABCG1 mRNA levels at d3 in macrophages cultured in 25 mm d-glucose (Fig. 4A). Incubation of freshly isolated peritoneal macrophages in l-glucose (which is not taken up by macrophages and serves as an osmotic control) did not reduce ABCG1 mRNA expression (data not shown), suggesting that glucose metabolism was required. Interestingly, there was no significant reduction in ABCG1 expression before 3 days of culture in d-glucose (Fig. 4A). ABCG1 protein expression was also decreased significantly by 25 mm d-glucose at the 7 day time point but not by 25 mm l-glucose (Fig. 4B). In addition, there were no changes found in either LXRα or LXRβ (data not shown). These data together suggest that glucose may indirectly regulate ABCG1 expression and are similar to those obtained using freshly isolated peritoneal macrophages from diabetic db/db mice (Fig. 3). These data indicate that chronically elevated levels of glucose, as occurs in the setting of diabetes, down-regulates expression of ABCG1. Decreased Cholesterol Efflux in Diabetic db/db Macrophages— To verify that the cholesterol accumulation that we found was indeed due, in part, to ABC transporter activity and not scavenger receptor activity, we performed cholesterol efflux assays to measure ABC transporter function. We examined the ability of diabetic db/db macrophages to efflux cholesterol to either lipid-free apoA-I or to HDL. Tall and colleagues (13Wang N. Lan D. Chen W. Matsuura F. Tall A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9774-9779Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar) have recently reported that ABCG1 is the key transporter of lipid to HDL, whereas ABCA1 is the key transporter of lipid to apoA-I. Macrophages from control B6 and diabetic db/db mice were incubated with either lipid-free apoA-I or HDL. We observed no changes in efflux of cholesterol to lipid-free apoA-I (Fig. 5A). This suggests that the slight decrease in ABCA1 mRNA observed in db/db macrophages (Fig. 3) has no significant impact in modulating ABCA1 protein levels required for efflux of cholesterol to apoA-I. However, we did observe a 25% reduction in the amount of cholesterol effluxed to HDL in diabetic db/db macrophages (Fig. 5A). In addition, B6 macrophages incubated in 25 mm d-glucose, but not l-glucose, for 7 days showed a statistically significant reduction (∼25%) in cholesterol efflux to HDL (Fig. 5B). These data support the notion that ABCG1 levels regulate macrophage cholesterol efflux to HDL and that the observed decrease in ABCG1 levels in diabetic db/db macrophages contributes to increased foam cell formation observed in these mice. ABCG1 Reduction Contributes to Foam Cell Formation—We constructed siRNA to ABCG1 to determine whether ABCG1 levels in the macrophage significantly contributed to cholesteryl ester accumulation and foam cell formation. Using siRNA, we were able to obtain a significant 55% reduction in ABCG1 mRNA expression in primary peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6J mice (Fig. 6A). Incubation of control macrophages with ox-LDL significantly increased intracellular cholesteryl ester accumulation as expected. Reduction of ABCG1 using siRNA increased intracellular cholesteryl ester accumulation in response to incubation with oxidized LDL by 3-fold compared with control macrophages (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, targeting ABCG1 with siRNA reduced cholesterol efflux to HDL by ∼25%, effectively mimicking the db/db phenotype (Fig. 6B). Thus, ABCG1 reduction decreases cholesterol efflux to HDL and causes cholesteryl ester to accumulate in the macrophage, contributing to foam cell formation. Increased Foam Cell Formation in Vivo in Diabetic Mice— We used an in vivo model for foam cell formation by eliciting peritoneal macrophages in Type 2 diabetic mice that were fed a high cholesterol, Western-type diet. This methodology has been used previously by Glass and colleagues (19Li A.C. Binder C.J. Gutierrez A. Brown K.K. Plotkin C.R. Pattison J.W. Valledor A.F. Davis R.A. Willson T.M. Witztum J.L. Palinski W. Glass C.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 1564-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) to show increased foam cell formation in vivo in LDL receptor-deficient mice fed a high cholesterol diet. To confirm that the differences observed in foam cell formation in diabetic db/db mice were common to other models of Type 2 diabetes, we investigated foam cell formation in vivo in the KKay mouse. Fasting plasma lipids, glucose and insulin levels for both KKay and db/db mice are listed in Table 2. Plasma lipid values were similar between KKay and db/db mice. Total cholesterol values increased ∼2-fold in diabetic versus control animals of both strains (Table 2). However, when placed on a Western diet for 10"

The present study has attempted to define both the cytochromes present in the beef adrenal cortex, as well as their distribution among the cell fractions. It confirms the presence of cytochromes c, b, and a + a3, and indicates the likelihood that cytochrome cl is the unknown cytochrome mentioned by Huszak. All of these cytochromes are present in the cortical mitochondria, and it has not been possible to demonstrate the presence of a microsomal cytochrome in the cortex such as is present in the microsomes of liver (2) or of the adrenal medulla (3). A survey has also been made of several of the respiratory enzymes of the cortex. Similar to what has already been reported for the adrenal medulla (3), it showed that the enzymes responsible for the transfer of electrons to O2 from reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide are of much lower activity than those responsible for the production of this reduced coenzyme. Such a relationship is fitting in view of the synthetic requirements for reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide in the various hydroxylation steps of steroid biosynthesis (4, 5)."
https://openalex.org/W2090614971,"Phosducin-like protein (PhLP) is a widely expressed binding partner of the G protein βγ subunit complex (Gβγ) that has been recently shown to catalyze the formation of the Gβγ dimer from its nascent polypeptides. Phosphorylation of PhLP at one or more of three consecutive serines (Ser-18, Ser-19, and Ser-20) is necessary for Gβγ dimer formation and is believed to be mediated by the protein kinase CK2. Moreover, several lines of evidence suggest that the cytosolic chaperonin complex (CCT) may work in concert with PhLP in the Gβγ-assembly process. The results reported here delineate a mechanism for Gβγ assembly in which a stable ternary complex is formed between PhLP, the nascent Gβ subunit, and CCT that does not include Gγ. PhLP phosphorylation permits the release of a PhLP·Gβ intermediate from CCT, allowing Gγ to associate with Gβ in this intermediate complex. Subsequent interaction of Gβγ with membranes releases PhLP for another round of assembly.

Eukaryotic cells employ heterotrimeric G proteins to transduce a wide variety of hormonal, neuronal, and sensory signals that control numerous physiological processes. As a result, malfunctions in G protein pathways contribute to many diseases (1Rockman H.A. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J.

There are three fundamental steps in the propagation of a G protein-mediated signal. First, a ligand binds a receptor, resulting in a change in the packing of the seven transmembrane α-helices found in all G protein-coupled receptors. Second, the activated receptor catalyzes exchange of GDP for GTP on the α subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein (Gα) 2The abbreviations used are: Gα, α subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein; G, heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein; Pdc, phosducin; PhLP, phosducin-like protein; CCT, cytosolic chaperonin containing tailless complex polypeptide 1; CK2, protein kinase CK2; LC/MS/MS, liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry; CID, collision-induced dissociation; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary cell; HEK-293 cells, human embryonic kidney 293 cells; HA, hemagglutinin; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine.2The abbreviations used are: Gα, α subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein; G, heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein; Pdc, phosducin; PhLP, phosducin-like protein; CCT, cytosolic chaperonin containing tailless complex polypeptide 1; CK2, protein kinase CK2; LC/MS/MS, liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry; CID, collision-induced dissociation; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary cell; HEK-293 cells, human embryonic kidney 293 cells; HA, hemagglutinin; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. on the intracellular surface of the receptor. GTP binding causes Gα to dissociate from the G protein βγ subunit complex (Gβγ). Third, the Gα·GTP and Gβγ complexes control the activity of effector enzymes and ion channels that regulate the intracellular concentration of second messengers (cyclic nucleotides, inositol phosphates, and Ca2+) and the plasma membrane electrical potential (mainly via K+ channels). Changes in these properties in turn orchestrate the cellular response to the stimulus (5Cabrera-Vera T.M. Vanhauwe J. Thomas T.O. Medkova M. Preininger A. Mazzoni M.R. Hamm H.E. Endocr.

From these experiments, it was suggested that the physiological role of PhLP was to down-regulate G protein signaling by sequestering Gβγ. However, the results of several recent studies have seriously challenged this model. Specifically, disruption of the PhLP1 gene in the chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica (15Kasahara S. Wang P. Nuss D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and in the soil amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum (7Blaauw M. Knol J.C. Kortholt A. Roelofs J. Ruchira Postma M. Visser A.J. Van Haastert P.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5047-5057Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) yielded the same phenotype as the disruption of the Gβ gene. Moreover, PhLP deletion blocked G protein signaling in Dictyostelium (7Blaauw M. Knol J.C. Kortholt A. Roelofs J. Ruchira Postma M. Visser A.J. Van Haastert P.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5047-5057Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In another study, the duration of opiate desensitization was prolonged in mice in which PhLP expression in the brain was inhibited by antisense oligonucleotide treatment (16Garzon J. Rodriguez-Diaz M. Lopez-Fando A. Garcia-Espana A. Sanchez-Blazquez P. Neuropharmacology. 2002; 42: 813-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). All of these observations are the exact opposite of what would be predicted by the Gβγ sequestration model. Insight into an alternative function of PhLP has come from the observation that PhLP interacts with the cytosolic chaperonin containing tailess complex polypeptide 1 (CCT), an essential molecular chaperone that mediates the folding of actin, tubulin, and other proteins into their native structures (17McLaughlin J.N. Thulin C.D. Hart S.J. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Willardson B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7962-7967Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). PhLP was shown to interact with CCT as a regulator and not as a folding substrate. In addition, the cryoelectron microscopic structure of the PhLP·CCT complex (18Martín-Benito J. Bertrand S. Hu T. Ludtke P.J. McLaughlin J.N. Willardson B.M. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17410-17415Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) shows that PhLP binds CCT at the top of the CCT apical domains positioned above the folding cavity in a manner analogous to prefoldin, a CCT co-chaperone that binds nascent actin polypeptide chains and delivers them to CCT for folding (19Martin-Benito J. Boskovic J. Gomez-Puertas P. Carrascosa J.L. Simons C.T. Lewis S.A. Bartolini F. Cowan N.J. Valpuesta J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6377-6386Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Coupling these observations with the fact that yeast Gβ (20Ho Y. Gruhler A. Heilbut A. Bader G.D. Moore L. Adams S.L. Millar A. Taylor P. Bennett K. Boutilier K. Yang L. Wolting C. Donaldson I.

Cell. 2003; 12: 87-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) interact with CCT suggests that PhLP might function as a co-chaperone in the folding of Gβ. Indeed, recent findings show that PhLP does act as an essential chaperone for assembly of the Gβγ dimer, demonstrating that the physiological function of PhLP is not to down-regulate G protein signaling by sequestering Gβγ but to support G protein signaling by catalyzing Gβγ dimer formation (24Lukov G.L. Hu T. McLaughlin J.N. Hamm H.E. Willardson B.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1965-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, the role of CCT in this process remains unclear (24Lukov G.L. Hu T. McLaughlin J.N. Hamm H.E. Willardson B.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1965-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 25Humrich J. Bermel C. Bunemann M. Harmark L. Frost R. Quitterer U. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20042-20050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of PhLP by protein kinase CK2 (CK2) plays an important role in PhLP function. A major site of CK2 phosphorylation occurs within a sequence of three consecutive serines (residues 18-20) near the N terminus (14Humrich J. Bermel C. Grubel T. Quitterer U. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4474-4481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of serines 18-20 was required for PhLP-mediated Gβγ assembly, for when these residues were substituted with alanine, PhLP was unable to catalyze Gβγ dimer formation (24Lukov G.L. Hu T. McLaughlin J.N. Hamm H.E. Willardson B.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1965-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which phosphorylation at these sites enhances Gβγ dimer formation is not known; therefore, the effects of CK2 phosphorylation on PhLP function were investigated. The results of these studies provide evidence for a mechanism of PhLP-mediated Gβγ assembly that involves the formation of a ternary complex between PhLP, the nascent Gβ polypeptide, and CCT. PhLP phosphorylation is required for the release of PhLP·Gβ from the CCT complex and the subsequent association of Gγ with Gβ to form the Gβγ dimer. Cell Culture—HEK-293 and CHO cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (50/50 mix) growth media with l-glutamine and 15 mm HEPES, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone). The cells were subcultured regularly to maintain active growth but were not used beyond 20-25 passages. Preparation of cDNA Constructs—Wild-type human PhLP, PhLP Δ1-75, and Pdc with 3′ c-myc and His6 tags in the pcDNA3.1/myc-His B vector (Invitrogen) were prepared as described (24Lukov G.L. Hu T. McLaughlin J.N. Hamm H.E. Willardson B.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1965-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Serine-to-alanine variants of human PhLP at positions 18, 19, 20, 25, and 296 were constructed in the pcDNA3.1/myc-His B vector by employing a PCR-based strategy and utilizing unique endonuclease restriction sites near the substitution site as described (24Lukov G.L. Hu T. McLaughlin J.N. Hamm H.E. Willardson B.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1965-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The constructs were then subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pET15b (Novagen) as described (26Carter M.D. Southwick K. Lukov G.L. Willardson B.M. Thulin C.D. J. Biomol. Tech. 2004; 15: 257-264PubMed Google Scholar). The integrity of all constructs was confirmed by sequence analysis. The N-terminally hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Gγ2, FLAG epitope-tagged Gβ1 and untagged Gβ1 cDNAs also in the pcDNA3.1 vector were obtained from the UMR cDNA Resource Center. Protein Expression and Purification—Wild-type and CK2 phosphorylation site variants of human PhLP in the pET15b vector were transformed in Escherichia coli DE3 cells and were purified using nondenaturing Ni2+ affinity chromatography as described previously (11Savage J.R.

The purified proteins were concentrated and exchanged into 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl by ultrafiltration and were stored in 50% glycerol at −20 °C. Purified Gβ1γ1 and retinal rod outer segment membranes were prepared also as described previously (11Savage J.R. McLaughlin J.N. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Willardson B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30399-30407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent (Pierce), and the purity was determined to be ∼95% by SDS-PAGE. CK2 Phosphorylation of PhLP—Purified PhLP (50 μm) was phosphorylated by CK2 (10 units/μl, Calbiochem) in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm ATP for 1 h at 37°C. The phosphorylation was confirmed by SDS-PAGE using 10% gels. Assay of PhLP Binding to CCT—The binding of CK2 phosphorylated or unphosphorylated PhLP and its CK2 phosphorylation site variants to CCT was measured by adding 5 nm purified PhLP to 5% rabbit reticulocyte lysate in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1.2% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma) and 0.6 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in a total volume of 300 μl. Binding was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 23 °C after which the PhLP was immunoprecipitated by incubating for 30 min at 4 °C with 2.1 μg of anti-c-myc antibody (clone 9E10, Biomol) followed by the addition of 30 μl of a 50% slurry of Protein A/G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and another 30-min incubation at 4 °C with constant mixing. The beads were washed with the phosphate-buffered saline/IGEPAL buffer, and proteins were solubilized with 20 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. 15 μl of each sample was resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and was immunoblotted with a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-CCTϵ antiserum (18Martín-Benito J.

Immunoblots were developed with the ECL Plus chemiluminescence reagent (GE Healthcare) and visualized with a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The band intensities were quantified using Image-QuaNT software (Amersham Biosciences). Assay of PhLP Inhibition of Gt Binding to Rhodopsin—Light-induced binding of 0.2 μm 125I-labeled Gtα and 0.2 μm Gtβγ to membranes containing 1 μm rhodopsin ± 2 μm CK2 phosphorylated or unphosphorylated PhLP was measured as described previously (11Savage J.R.

Mass Spectrometric Analyses—Tryptic peptides of CK2-phosphorylated PhLP were generated and analyzed as described previously (26Carter M.D. Southwick K. Lukov G.L. Willardson B.M. Thulin C.D. J. Biomol. Tech. 2004; 15: 257-264PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, molecular ions in the effluent from a C18 capillary chromatography that corresponded to the predicted masses of phosphopeptides from PhLP were fragmented by collision-induced dissociation in a Q-ToF mass spectrometer (LC/MS/MS). Fragmentation spectra were obtained using either automated or manual parent ion selection. Data were analyzed using BioAnalyst software (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Electrophoretic Mobility Determinations—CHO cells were plated in 6-well plates so that they were 70-80% confluent the next day. The cells were then transfected with 1 μg of either wild-type PhLP-myc or one of the CK2 phosphorylation site variants using Lipofectamine Plus reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were harvested 48 h later in 200 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (24Lukov G.L. Hu T. McLaughlin J.N. Hamm H.E. Willardson B.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1965-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and the PhLP-myc was immunoprecipitated from the lysate with 3 μg of anti-c-myc antibody and 30 μl of Protein A/G beads as described previously (17McLaughlin J.N.

The final precipitate was solubilized in 40 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and 10 μl of each sample was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. The gels were immunoblotted with a 1:1000 dilution of the anti-c-myc antibody and developed as described above. Gβγ Expression Measurements—HEK-293 cells were plated in 6-well plates so that they would be 70-80% confluent the following day. They were then co-transfected with 1 μg of each of the PhLP-myc, HA-Gγ2, and Gβ1 cDNAs using Lipofectamine Plus reagent. In all experiments involving multiple transfections, the total amount of cDNA was held constant by adding empty vector. After 48 h, the cells were washed and solubilized in 200 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer. The Gβ1γ2 complexes were immunoprecipitated from 100 μl of the lysate with 1.5 μg of anti-HA (clone 3F10, Roche Applied Science) antibody as described previously (17McLaughlin J.N. Thulin C.D.

The complexes were solubilized in 40 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer, and 10 μl was resolved on 10% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE gels for Gβ1, or 20 μl was resolved on 16.5% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE gels for Gγ2. For Gβ detection, the gels were immunoblotted with a 1:2000 dilution of a Gβ1 antibody as described (27Lukov G.L. Myung C.S. McIntire W.E. Shao J. Zimmerman S.S. Garrison J.C. Willardson B.M.

For HA-Gγ2, the membranes were blocked for 1 h in 2% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline, followed by incubation for 1 h in a 1:500 dilution of anti-HA antibody in the blocking buffer and then 1 h in a 1:2000 dilution of goat anti-rat horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody (Calbiochem). The immunoblots were developed as described above. Radiolabel Pulse-Chase Assay—The pulse-chase assay was performed and quantified as described previously (24Lukov G.L. Hu T. McLaughlin J.N. Hamm H.E. Willardson B.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1965-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A similar protocol was used to measure the rate of release of nascent Gβ from CCT. Six-well plates of HEK-293 cells were co-transfected with 1.0 μg of FLAG Gβ1, HA-Gγ2 or PhLP-myc variants as indicated. After a 10-min pulse, the radiolabel was chased for the times indicated and the cells were harvested in 220 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer. The extract was divided into two 95-μl samples, and 2.5 μl of 1 μg/μl anti-CCTϵ antibody (Serotec) was added to one sample and 3.0 μl of 1 μg/μl anti-FLAG antibody was added to the other sample. The immunoprecipitation and analysis of the radiolabeled proteins co-immunoprecipitating with CCT were carried out as described (24Lukov G.L. Hu T. McLaughlin J.N. Hamm H.E. Willardson B.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1965-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The Gβ1 band was clearly separated from the other radiolabeled bands, facilitating its quantification. The amount of Gβ1 in the CCT immunoprecipitate was divided by that in the FLAG-Gβ1 immunoprecipitate to determine the fraction of the total Gβ1 bound to CCT. These values were expressed as a percentage of the 30-min time point to readily compare the rates of Gβ dissociation from CCT. The data were fit to a first order dissociation rate equation using the KaleidaGraph graphics software to determine the dissociation rate constant k. From the k values, the half-life was calculated by the equation, t½ = ln 2/k. Assay of Gβ Binding to CCT—For CCT binding experiments involving Gβ1 overexpression, HEK-293 cells were plated in 6-well plates and transfected with 1.0 μg of FLAG-Gβ1, HA-Gγ2, Pdc, or PhLP cDNAs as indicated in Fig. 5 (A and C). Alternatively, the transfections were performed with 0.5 μg of FLAG-Gβ1, 1.0 μg of PhLP variants, and 1.5 μg of HA-Gγ as indicated in Fig. 6A. After 48 h, cells were lysed and extracts were immunoprecipitated with 2.5 μg of anti-CCTϵ antibody (Serotec), the immunoprecipitates were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels and immunoblotted for FLAG-Gβ1, PhLP-myc, Pdc-myc, or HA-Gγ2 using the indicated antibodies as described above. Gβ1 bands were quantified as described above, and intensities were calculated as a percentage of the control as indicated.FIGURE 6PhLP phosphorylation is required for the release of Gβ from CCT and interaction with Gγ. A, the effects of PhLP phosphorylation and Gγ co-expression on Gβ binding to CCT were measured by co-immunoprecipitation. HEK-293 cells were transfected with FLAG-Gβ1, HA-Gγ2, and the PhLP variants as indicated. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with an antibody to CCTϵ and then immunoblotted for FLAG-Gβ. A representative immunoblot is shown. Bars in the graph represent the average ± S.E. of the Gβ band intensity relative to the Gβ/PhLP-WT sample from three separate experiments. B, the effects of PhLP phosphorylation on the rate of Gβ release from CCT were measured using a radiolabel pulse-chase assay. HEK-293 cells were transfected with FLAG-Gβ1 and the indicated PhLP variants. The pulse-chase assay was performed as in Fig. 4C. After the chase times indicated, cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to CCTϵ or Gβ1. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and radiolabeled bands were detected using a PhosphorImager. The Gβ band intensities were quantified, and ratios of nascent Gβ1 in the CCT immunoprecipitate versus the total nascent Gβ in the Gβ immunoprecipitate were calculated and plotted as a percentage of the ratio at the first time point. Lines represent a fit of the data from 3 separate experiments to a first-order rate equation. Values for t½ are shown below the graph. C, the effects of Gγ on PhLP-mediated release of nascent Gβ1 from CCT were measured as in panel B in HEK-293 cells co-expressing HA-Gγ2 in addition to FLAG-Gβ1 and PhLP. D, the ability of Gγ to bind CCT was assessed by co-immunoprecipitation. HEK-293 cells were transfected with FLAG-Gβ1, HA-Gγ2, or PhLP variants as indicated. Cells extracts were immunoprecipitated with an antibody to CCTϵ and then immunoblotted for Gγ.A representative blot is shown. The Std lane in the CCT IP panel was the lysate from the Gγ-transfected cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For binding experiments involving endogenous Gβ, HEK-293 cells were grown in 100-mm dishes and transfected with 6.0 μg of PhLP variant cDNAs as indicated in Fig. 5B. Cells were lysed in 1.2 ml of buffer, and 1 ml was immunoprecipitated with 10 μg of anti-CCTϵ antibody and 60 μl of protein A/G beads. Endogenous Gβ1 was detected with the anti-Gβ1 antibody. For binding experiments involving endogenous PhLP, HEK-293 cells were grown in 6-well plates and transfected with 1.0 μg of FLAG-Gβ1 cDNA as indicated in Fig. 5C. Extracts from two wells were pooled, and 200 μl was immunoprecipitated with 3 μg of anti-CCTϵ antibody. Other immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting procedures were as described above. Effects of CK2 Phosphorylation of PhLP on CCT and Gβγ Binding—To begin to assess the impact of CK2 phosphorylation on PhLP function, the effects of phosphorylation on the binding of PhLP to its two known binding partners, Gβγ and CCT, were determined in vitro. Purified recombinant human PhLP was readily phosphorylated by CK2, resulting in a marked reduction in the mobility of the PhLP protein band in SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 1A). The entire PhLP band was shifted, indicating that phosphorylation was 100% complete under the conditions used. The effects of CK2 phosphorylation on CCT binding was assessed by measuring the ability of PhLP to co-immunoprecipitate CCT from rabbit reticulocyte lysate (18Martín-Benito J. Bertrand S. Hu T. Ludtke P.J. McLaughlin J.N. Willardson B.M. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17410-17415Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Human PhLP bound CCT with a high affinity, as evidenced by the fact that addition of only 5 nm PhLP was sufficient to co-immunoprecipitate readily detectible amounts of CCT from the reticulocyte lysate. Under these conditions, CK2 phosphorylation increased the co-immunoprecipitation of CCT by 7-fold (Fig. 1B). In contrast, CK2 phosphorylation had no effect on the ability of PhLP to co-immunoprecipitate purified Gβ1γ1 (Fig. 1B) or to inhibit association of Gβ1γ1 with Gtα and light-activated rhodopsin (Fig. 1C), indicating that phosphorylation did not change the binding of PhLP to Gβ1γ1. Mass Spectrometric Analysis of the CK2 Phosphorylation Sites of PhLP—The phosphorylation sites that could potentially be responsible for the increase in PhLP binding to CCT upon CK2 phosphorylation were identified by mass spectrometry. PhLP was phosphorylated by CK2 in vitro and digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptide fragments were analyzed by electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. Fig. 2A shows the collision-induced dissociation (CID) spectrum of a doubly charged parent ion with an m/z ratio of 1198.5, corresponding to the mass of a tryptic peptide containing the C-terminal residues 287-301 of PhLP plus one phosphate. This CID spectrum showed robust peaks for both the b and y ions corresponding to the sequence of the 287-301 peptide. Of these, the y16 ion had an m/z equal to the loss of a phosphate, and the formation of a dehydroalanine at one of the two serines in this fragment, indicating that either Ser-293 or Ser-296 was phosphorylated in the parent ion. The b2, b4, b6, and b9 ions all had m/z ratios corresponding to the mass of their unphosphorylated fragments, suggesting that Ser-288 and Ser-293 were not phosphorylated. Therefore, the phosphate most likely resided on Ser-296. Accordingly, Ser-296 is within a strong consensus site for CK2 phosphorylation with negatively charged residues at the +1 and +3 positions (28Meggio F. Pinna L.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 349-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). One other tryptic fragment with m/z values corresponding to a phosphorylated species was detected and analyzed by CID. This peptide consisted of PhLP residues 13-32 plus one and two phosphates. The spectrum for the singly phosphorylated species yielded few b and y ions, none of which were phosphorylated. However, there were sufficient fragments to confirm the identity of the peptide (Fig. 2B). The same result was obtained with the doubly phosphorylated species. The CID spectrum confirmed the identity of the peptide but did not show any phosphorylated fragments (Fig. 2C). Henc"
https://openalex.org/W2077155024,"Fungicidal activity of Hst 5 is initiated by binding to cell surface proteins on Candida albicans, followed by intracellular transport to cytoplasmic effectors leading to cell death. As we identified heat shock 70 proteins (Ssa1p and/or Ssa2p) from C. albicans lysates that bind Hst 5, direct interactions between purified recombinant Ssa proteins and Hst 5 were tested by pull-down and yeast two-hybrid assays. Pulldown of both native complexes and those stabilized by cross-linking demonstrated higher affinity of Hst 5 for Ssa2p than for Ssa1p, in agreement with higher levels of interactions between Ssa2p and Hst 5 measured by yeast two-hybrid analyses. C. albicans ssa1Δ and ssa2Δ mutants were constructed to examine Hst 5 binding, translocation, and candidacidal activities. Both ssa1Δ and ssa2Δ mutants were indistinguishable from wild-type cells in growth and hyphal formation. However, C. albicans ssa2Δ mutants were highly resistant to the candidacidal activity of Hst 5, although the ssa1Δ mutant did not have any significant reduction in killing by Hst 5. Total cellular binding of 125I-Hst 5 in the ssa2Δ mutant was reduced to one-third that of wild-type cells, in contrast to the ssa1Δ mutant whose total cellular binding of Hst 5 was similar to the wild-type strain. Intracellular transport of Hst 5 was significantly impaired in the ssa2Δ mutant strain, but only mildly so in the ssa1Δ mutant. Thus, C. albicans Ssa2p facilitates fungicidal activity of Hst 5 in binding and intracellular translocation, whereas Ssa1p appears to have a lesser functional role in Hst 5 toxicity.

Thus, C. albicans Ssa2p facilitates fungicidal activity of Hst 5 in binding and intracellular translocation, whereas Ssa1p appears to have a lesser functional role in Hst 5 toxicity. Candida albicans is a significant fungal pathogen causing both superficial and disseminated infectious diseases in humans. C. albicans is an opportunistic pathogen, so that immunosuppressed patients or xerostomic individuals have a high incidence of oral candidiasis (1Odds F.C. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 15: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Saliva is rich in proteins with antimicrobial activity; among these, histatins have potent fungistatic and fungicidal activity to yeast and filamentous forms of Candida (2Xu T. Levitz S.M. Diamond R.D. Oppenheim F.G. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 2549-2554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, histatins are key components in the armamentarium of the innate host defense system. Among at least 50 observed histatin peptides found in saliva (3Hardt M. Thomas L.R. Dixon S.E. Newport G. Agabian N. Prakobphol A. Hall S.C. Witkowska H.E. Fisher S.J.

Hst 5 must first penetrate the cell wall and cross the periplasmic space to access the cytoplasm where it exerts its toxic activity. The cell wall of C. albicans is a thick multilayered structure of chitin and mannoproteins that protects the cell and restricts passage of proteins. Our previous studies identified cell wall-binding sites for Hst 5 from intact cells (5Edgerton M. Koshlukova S.E. Lo T.E. Chrzan B.G. Straubinger R.M. Raj P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20438-20447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), whose identity was consistent with either Ssa1p or Ssa2p members of the C. albicans HSP70 family (6Li X.S. Reddy M.S. Baev D. Edgerton M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28553-28561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Hst 5-binding proteins of similar size were also observed in susceptible Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, and S. cerevisiae cells with deletion of the SSA1 and SSA2 genes, while retaining SSA3 and SSA4 genes, had substantial reduction of Hst 5 binding and killing (6Li X.S. Reddy M.S. Baev D. Edgerton M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28553-28561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This evidence supported the involvement of the Ssa protein family as functional binding partners involved in the uptake and fungicidal mechanism of Hst 5. The cell wall of C. albicans is comprised of a multiple-layered glycoprotein-rich architecture and has been shown to be actively involved in many biological functions, especially the pathogenicity of this species (7Cassone A. Curr. Top. Med. Mycol. 1989; 3: 248-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The major cell wall structure is composed of mannose-rich polysaccharides and glycoproteins interconnected by covalent bonds (8Chaffin W.L. Lopez-Ribot J.L. Casanova M. Gozalbo D. Martinez J.P. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 130-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In recent years, the development of sequential cell wall fractionation and analysis techniques, including two-dimensional PAGE and tandem mass spectrometry, have confirmed a heterogeneous population of noncovalently linked cell wall proteins (9Pitarch A. Sanchez M. Nombela C. Gil C. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 967-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 10Urban C. Sohn K. Lottspeich F. Brunner H. Rupp S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 544: 228-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Several proteins, previously thought to be associated exclusively in cytoplasmic compartments, have also been found in cell wall extracts. The lack of classical secretion signal sequence of these proteins implies that they may be sorted through alternative secretory pathways (11Lopez-Ribot J.L. Alloush H.M. Masten B.J. Chaffin W.L. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3333-3340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Alloush H.M. Lopez-Ribot J.L. Masten B.J. Chaffin W.L.

Dis. 1996; 173: 684-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Among them, the heat shock protein families (Hsp70, Hsp90, and Hsp104p) were found to be constitutively expressed at the cell surface of both C. albicans yeast and hyphal forms (6Li X.S. Reddy M.S. Baev D. Edgerton M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28553-28561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 9Pitarch A. Sanchez M. Nombela C. Gil C. Mol. Cell.

However, their functions at the cell surface have not been defined. It has been suggested that, in addition to their role in adaptation to temperature changes, these cell wall heat shock proteins may mediate direct interactions with the host environment (14Bromuro C. La Valle R. Sandini S. Urbani F. Ausiello C.M. Morelli L. Fe d'Ostiani C. Romani L. Cassone A. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2154-2162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Eroles P. Sentandreu M. Elorza M.V.

Unlike S. cerevisiae, the Hsp70 Ssa family in C. albicans contains only two homologous family members, Ssa1p (656 amino acids) and Ssa2p (645 amino acids), which have 87.2% identity of their protein sequences (6Li X.S. Reddy M.S. Baev D. Edgerton M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28553-28561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 11Lopez-Ribot J.L. Alloush H.M. Masten B.J. Chaffin W.L.

Immun. 1995; 63: 4039-4045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm, Ssa proteins are necessary for the translocation of newly synthesized polypeptides across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by either co-translational or post-translational pathways (18Johnson A.E. van Waes M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 799-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 19McClellan A.J. Brodsky J.L. Genetics. 2000; 156: 501-512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They also participate as chaperones in protein folding and intracellular targeting to mitochondria and other cellular organelles (20Murakami H. Pain D. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2051-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 21Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). All these processes are ATP-dependent and require the interplay between the ATPase domain and peptide-binding domains (22Davis J.E. Voisine C. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9269-9276Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that 70-kDa components, identified as Hsp70 proteins, are abundant at the yeast cell surface and extend through the cell wall and into plasma membrane in C. albicans (11Lopez-Ribot J.L. Alloush H.M. Masten B.J. Chaffin W.L. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3333-3340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such localization raises the possibility that Ssa proteins could serve to facilitate intracellular uptake of Hst 5, possibly by binding Hst 5 within the cell wall. However, it is not known whether both Ssa1 and Ssa2 proteins are part of the C. albicans cell wall structure or whether individual Ssa proteins have a role in facilitating translocation of Hst 5 to the cytosol. Hsp70 family members SSA1 and SSA2 are highly conserved genes in C. albicans, and expression levels of individual SSA genes have been reported (17La Valle R. Bromuro C. Ranucci L. Muller H.M. Crisanti A. Cassone A. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4039-4045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Eroles P. Sentandreu M. Elorza M.V. Sentandreu R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 128: 95-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, direct interactions between C. albicans Ssa1 and Ssa2 proteins and Hst 5 are identified, and C. albicans SSA2 gene deletion mutants are found to be deficient in Hst 5 uptake and killing. Strains and Materials—Escherichia coli DH5α competent cells (Invitrogen) were used as a host for plasmids and were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (Difco). Ampicillin (Sigma) was added at a final concentration of 100 μgml−1. The ura3− auxotrophic C. albicans CAF4-2 strain (24Fonzi W.A. Irwin M.Y. Genetics. 1993; 134: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was the parental strain for Hsp70 gene deletions. The strains generated by this study and their genotypes are listed in Table 1. Yeast nitrogen base (YNB; Qbiogene, Morgan Irvine, CA) without uracil or uridine and supplemented with 2% glucose was used for selection of the URA3+ transformants. Yeast carbon base (YCB; Sigma) was used for induction of FLP-mediated excision of the URA3 flipper cassette. The strains were maintained on yeast extract/peptone/dextrose (YPD; Qbiogene) agar plates and recultured monthly from −78 °C stock. Biotinylated histatin 5 (BHst 5) was synthesized and purified by Genemed Synthesis, Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Na125I and Sephadex G-10 were purchased from Amersham Biosciences.TABLE 1C. albicans strains used in this studyStrainParentGenotypeURA3 markerSourceCAF4-2SC5314Δura3::imm434/Δura3::imm434ura3−Ref. 24Fonzi W.A.

Reddy M.S. Baev D. Edgerton M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28553-28561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Briefly, sequences encoding Hst 5 and the C. albicans SSA1 and SSA2 ORFs were amplified by PCR and in-frame ligated into the bait and target plasmids. The yeast host strain EGY48 was first transformed with plasmids harboring the bait fusion genes and the reporter plasmid pSH18-34. All baits were assayed for auto-induction and nuclear localization. The plasmids containing the target fusion genes were then transformed into strains already containing the bait and reporter plasmids. Determination of β-galactosidase activity in liquid culture was performed in duplicate assays in at least four independent experiments for each bait-target combination. Purification of Recombinant Ssa1p and Ssa2p—Recombinant C. albicans Ssa1 and Ssa2 proteins were expressed and purified using a S. cerevisiae expression system (Invitrogen). C. albicans SSA1 and SSA2 cDNA was obtained using PCR primers and inserted into the cloning site of the S. cerevisiae yeast expression vector pYES2/NT/C that contains polyhistidine tags at the 3′ and 5′ ends of Xpress-tagged and V5-tagged sites, in order to produce an H6-Xpress-SSA-V5-H6 coding sequence under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter. The final constructs were transfected into competent INVSc-1 S. cerevisiae cells (Invitrogen). After growth for 9 h in 2 liters of induction media containing 2% galactose, cells were harvested and glass bead-disrupted in ice-cold lysis buffer, and clarified cell lysates were collected following centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min. The clarified supernatant was loaded onto a Ni-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated in binding buffer A (20 mm NaH2PO4, 0.5 m NaCl, 30 mm imidazole, pH 7.4). After washing with 10 column volumes of buffer A, bound proteins were eluted with 10 column volumes of 300 mm imidazole in buffer A and desalted with PAGEprep advance kit (Pierce), and Ssa proteins were visualized by immunoblot analysis using Xpress or anti-HSP70 antibodies. Elution fractions judged to be at least 95% pure by SDS-PAGE and immunostaining were pooled and dialyzed against water for 7 days at 4 °C. Dialysis products were lyophilized and stored in −78 °C. The homogeneity and identity of recombinant Ssa proteins from purified fractions were confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis (Yale Cancer Center Mass Spectrometry Resource & W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory). Pulldown Assay of Ssa-BHst 5 Complexes—BHst 5 (46 μg) was combined with purified recombinant Ssa1p or Ssa2p (15 μg) in binding buffer B (0.1 m phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.2), containing 0.8 mm ATP and 6 mm Mg2+, and incubated for 2 h at 4°C to allow complex formation. For cross-linking experiments, 5 mm 3,3′-dithiobis-sulfosuccinimidylpropionate (DTSSP) (Pierce) was added to the incubation mixture to stabilize Ssa-BHst 5 complexes. The reaction mixture was combined with immobilized streptavidin-agarose beads (50 μl) (Pierce) that had been pre-equilibrated in binding buffer B, placed in a spin column, and then incubated with gentle stirring for 1 h at 4 °C. Unbound proteins were removed by washing the beads four times with 500 μl of buffer B. Beads were incubated with 300 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris, 10% glycerol, 2.5% 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8) and placed in a water bath at 85 °C for 8 min to remove protein complexes and then collected from the spin column by centrifugation (1,200 × g, 1 min). Control reactions were performed with either rSsa1 or rSsa2 protein and streptavidin-agarose beads alone in identical pulldown assay conditions. Pulldown proteins were subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and rSsa proteins were detected by Western blotting with anti-Hsp70/Hsc70 monoclonal antibody or by Coomassie staining. DNA Manipulations—Standard conditions for molecular cloning, DNA isolation, and transformation were carried out as described previously (25Baev D. Rivetta A. Li X.S. Vylkova S. Bashi E. Slayman C.L. Edgerton M. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 3251-3260Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All oligonucleotides used in strain constructions were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). Restriction endonucleases and GeneRuler DNA markers were purchased from Fermentas (Hanover, MD). Fast-Link DNA ligation kit was from Epicenter Technologies (Madison, WI). Plasmid DNA was prepared by QIAprep spin miniprep kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Genomic DNA of C. albicans strain was isolated by PUREGENE DNA isolation kit from Gentra System (Minneapolis, MN). Construction of pSSA1/2-UFC Plasmids—The URA3-flipper technique (26Morschhauser J. Michel S. Staib P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) was used to replace the first allele of each SSA1 or SSA2 gene. The pSFUC2 plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. J. Morschhauser) containing two FRT sites, a SAP2 promoter-driven FLP gene and a URA3 marker, was used as the starting vector. The 5′-flanking sequence, including an ∼550-bp length of the promoter region from either SSA1 or SSA2 gene, was subcloned and ligated with the KpnI- and XhoI-digested plasmid. The constructed plasmids containing 5′-flanking region of SSA genes were confirmed by PCR. Fragments including ∼600 bp of 3′-flanking sequence, spanning the untranslated region of SSA1 or SSA2 genes, was then digested by BglII and SacI and ligated into the pSSA-5FR-UFC plasmid. Insertion of SSA genes into the vector was confirmed by restriction digestion and PCR. The final gene disruption constructs were named pSSA1-UFC and pSSA2-UFC. Construction of pSSA1/2-URA Plasmids—The pDBU3 plasmid (∼5.1 kb), containing 2.37-kb length of the URA3 opening reading frame, was used as a starting vector. In addition to the 5′- and 3′-target sequences of the SSA1/2 gene (5′TR and 3′TR, ∼350 bp each), a second 3′-target region (3′TR-2, ∼300 bp) amplified from the sequence immediately downstream of the first 3′-TR was added. The PCR product of 3′TR-2 was introduced into the vector between the 5′TR and URA3 marker. This additional flanking region served as the recognition site for fluoroorotic acid-induced intra-chromosomal recombination. Therefore, the final gene disruption constructs, pSSA1-URA and pSSA2-URA, were used to target the second allele of SSA1/2 gene. Disruption of SSA1 and SSA2 Genes in CAF4-2 Strain—Because of the diploid genome of C. albicans, a combination of two genetic strategies was employed to sequentially remove both alleles of SSA genes. To achieve stable transformation, the pSSA-UFC plasmids were linearized by overnight digestion with Eam1105I and then transformed into CAF4-2 strain by the lithium acetate/polyethylene glycol method (28Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2077) Google Scholar). For each transformation, 50 μl of competent cells were mixed with 5 μl of 10 mg ml−1 denatured sheared salmon sperm carrier DNA (Clontech) and 5 μl of the linearized SSA disruption cassette. Transformed cells were spread onto uracil-deficient agar plates. Candida genomic DNA was isolated, and integration of gene disruption cassette was confirmed by PCR with control primers. To recycle the URA3-flipper cassette, selected colonies were further inoculated into 2 ml of YCB plus bovine serum albumin (4 mg ml−1) and uridine (100 μgml−1) medium to enable the induction of SAP2 promoter-regulated FLP recombinase. A culture diluted overnight was directly plated onto YNB agar plates containing uridine (50 μg ml−1), and transformants were analyzed to screen for heterozygous mutants of SSA1/2 genes. Because the same gene disruption cassette has poor efficiency for targeting the second allele, fluoroorotic acid-induced recombination was utilized as described previously (27Baev D. Rivetta A. Vylkova S. Sun J.N. Zeng G.F. Slayman C.L. Edgerton M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55060-55072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) to disrupt the remaining wild-type copy of SSA1/2 genes. The pSSA-URA plasmids were linearized by Eco31I digestion and transformed into the heterozygous mutants (SSA1/ssa1::FRT or SSA2/ssa2::FRT). Successful replacement of the second allele SSA genes was confirmed by PCR. Selected colonies were spread onto YNB agar plates containing fluoroorotic acid (1 mg ml−1) and uridine (50 μgml−1) to induce intra-chromosomal recombination and eliminate colonies containing the URA3 gene. Resulting homozygous mutants with either SSA1 or SSA2 gene deletions were obtained. For additional deletion of SSA genes, these mutants were transformed with another series of cassettes. Deletion of one allele of the second SSA1 or SSA2 gene was obtained, and the strains were designated as ssa1Δ and ssa2Δ (Table 1). However, no transformants with complete deletion of both SSA1 and SSA2 genes could be obtained, showing that at least one copy of either SSA1 or SSA2 gene is essential for viability. Restoration of SSA1 or SSA2 Genes in Deletion Mutant Strains—To confirm gene-specific effects, two complementation strains were constructed by introducing a wild-type allele of SSA1 or SSA2 genes into ssa1Δ or ssa2Δ strains, respectively, at the RP10 locus (27Baev D. Rivetta A. Vylkova S. Sun J.N. Zeng G.F. Slayman C.L. Edgerton M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55060-55072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The ORF of either SSA1 or SSA2 genes (∼3.5 kb), including ∼1-kb promoter region and ∼550-bp untranslated region, were cloned and ligated into the digested vector pDBU3R. The resulting plasmids (pRP10-SSA1ORF and pRP10-SSA2ORF) were linearized with NcoI enzyme and transformed into the ssa1Δ and ssa2Δ mutants, respectively. The correct integration of these cassettes into the RP10 locus was verified by PCR. The genotypes of these complementation strains, designated as ssa1Δ/SSA1 and ssa2Δ/SSA2, are shown in Table 1. Southern Blot to Confirm SSA1/2 Gene Deletions—Southern blotting was performed in wild-type and sequential deletion mutants using the HybQUEST DNP complete system (Mirus, Gene Transfer, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. DNA probes (∼700 bp) of SSA1/2 genes were cloned (bgSSA1–5′, GGAAGATCTATGAGGAAGAAATAGGTAATTTAC; 2SSA1-r, TCTGATGAAATCATCAATATTTTAC; SSA2(C)-f-2, TGTAGATGAATTGATTAGTGGTG; and xhSSA2–3′, AACCTCGAGCATGATTAATTTATTAGTTGATTTATC) and labeled with HybQUEST DNP from kits. Membranes containing digested genomic DNA were pre-hybridized with 10 mg ml−1 denatured sheared salmon DNA to block nonspecific binding. Denatured DNP-labeled SSA probes (50 μl) next were added into 3.5 ml of pre-warmed hybridization solution and incubated at 42 °C overnight. The membrane was blotted following stringency washes in (2×, 0.5×, and 0.1×) SSC buffer with 0.1% SDS. Hybridized bands were visualized by exposure of the membrane to Lumi-PhosPlus chemiluminescent substrate and developed on film. Total RNA Isolation, cDNA Synthesis, and Real Time RT-PCR—Transcriptional levels of each gene were analyzed following growth at room temperature and after heat shock conditions at 37 °C for 1 h. Total RNA isolation was performed using the RNeasy mini kit from Qiagen. Samples were both in-column-treated with DNase I, and off-column-treated using the TURBO-DNA-Free set from Ambion. The absence of genomic DNA contamination was confirmed by PCR amplification of two housekeeping genes, EFB1 (elongation factor gene EF-1β) and ACT1 (actin-1). Following TURBO DNase treatment, 4 μg of total RNA was used per reaction for the first strand synthesis (cDNA) using a RETROscript kit from Ambion. The primers and TaqMan probes of SSA1/2 genes and EFB1 used for this study were as follows: SSA1_RT(fr), TTAGTGGTGCTTATGGTGCTG; SSA1_RT(rv), TTGGTCCACTTGATTCACCA; SSA1_RT(pb), 5′-/56-FAM/ACCTGGGAATCCGCCTGCAC-/3BHQ_1/-3′; SSA2_RT(fr), GCTAACCCAATCATGACCAAA; SSA2_RT(rv), CCATCGTTAGATGGTTCTGG; SSA2_RT(pb), 5′-/56-FAM/AGCAGCACCAGAAGGAGTAGCACCA/3BHQ_1/-3′; CaEFB5′, AAGACTTGCCAGCCGGTAAAG; CaEFB 3′, TCAGCTTCTTCATCAACTTCATCA; CaEFB probe, 5′-/56-FAM/CCGCTTCTGGTTCTGCTGCTGCCG/3BHQ_1/-3′. The amplicons were 100–150 bp in length, and the melting temperatures were ∼68 °C for probes and 58 °C for primers. The reporter dye and quencher dye for the probes were 6-carboxyfluorescein and Black Hole Quencher, respectively. Amplification and detection were carried out in 96-well plates on an iCycler iQ real time detection system (Bio-Rad). All samples contained 1× IQ Supermix (Bio-Rad), 100 nm TaqMan probe, and 150 nm of both the forward and reverse primers. Fluorescent data were collected and analyzed with iCycler iQ software. The ΔCt value was obtained by calculating the difference between Ct values of the target gene (SSA1 or SSA2) and the normalizer (EFB1). The ΔCt of CAF4-2 at room temperature was used as a reference (base line). The ΔΔCt values were then calculated as the difference between the ΔCt of each sample and the base line and were transformed to absolute values (2−ΔΔCt) to calculate comparative expression levels. 125I-Histatin 5 Uptake Assays—Hst 5 was iodinated using the chloramine T method as described previously (6Li X.S. Reddy M.S. Baev D. Edgerton M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28553-28561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Uptake experiments were performed in C. albicans wild-type, mutant, and restoration strains that were cultured as described above. Cells were suspended at a density of 4 × 107 cells/ml in uptake buffer (10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, including 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Approximately 106 cells were incubated with 3 μm 125I-Hst 5 for 30 min at room temperature. For heat shock conditions, cells were transferred to pre-warmed (37 °C) buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min prior to addition of 125I-Hst 5 and then incubated at 37 °C for another 30 min to allow uptake of 125I-Hst 5. Following two rinses with binding buffer to remove nonspecifically bound protein, total cellular uptake of 125I-Hst 5 was measured in a γ-counter. Data from at least three independent experiments were used to obtain the mean total uptake of 125I-Hst 5 for each cell type and condition. Candidacidal Assays of Histatin 5—Antifungal activities of Hst 5 with C. albicans strains were examined by microdilution plate assays (6Li X.S. Reddy M.S. Baev D. Edgerton M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28553-28561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Single colonies of each strain were inoculated into 10 ml of YPD medium with uridine (50 μg/ml) and grown overnight at room temperature until A600 values reached 1.6–1.8. Cells were washed twice with 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and then cells (106) were mixed with different concentrations of Hst 5 and incubated at room temperature with constant shaking for 1 h. For heat shock conditions, cells were transferred to pre-warmed (37 °C) buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min prior to addition of Hst 5. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C for another 1 h with the same concentrations of Hst 5. The reaction was stopped by addition of 900 μl of 10 mm phosphate buffer, and 500 cells were spread onto YPD agar plates and incubated for 36–48 h until colonies could be visualized. Percent cell killing was calculated as 1 – (numbers of colonies from suspensions with Hst 5/numbers of colonies from control suspensions) × 100. Western Blot of Cell Wall and Cytoplasmic Ssa1/2 Proteins and Transported Hst 5—Expression levels of Ssa1/2 proteins in C. albicans cell wall and cytoplasm were assessed as described previously (6Li X.S.

Here, we have shown that eIF4E is ubiquitinated primarily at Lys-159 and incubation of cells with a proteasome inhibitor leads to increased eIF4E levels, suggesting the proteasome-dependent proteolysis of ubiquitinated eIF4E. Ubiquitinated eIF4E retained its cap binding ability, whereas eIF4E phosphorylation and eIF4G binding were reduced by ubiquitination. The W73A mutant of eIF4E exhibited enhanced ubiquitination/degradation, and 4E-BP overexpression protected eIF4E from ubiquitination/degradation. Because heat shock or the expression of the carboxyl terminus of heat shock cognate protein 70-interacting protein (Chip) dramatically increased eIF4E ubiquitination, Chip may be at least one ubiquitin E3 ligase responsible for eIF4E ubiquitination.

The eukaryotic mRNA cap (m7GTP) is a highly conserved structure located at the 5′-end of RNA molecule that plays an essential role in regulating mRNA decay, compartmentalization, maturation, and translation initiation (1Shatkin A.J.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3172-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The eIF4F complex enhances the assembly of the other initiation factors, such as eIF3, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal-integrating kinase, and the 40 S ribosomal subunit. Disruption or overproduction of eIF4E leads to aberrant cell growth or oncogenesis (4Mamane Y. Petroulakis E. Rong L. Yoshida K. Ler L.W. Sonenberg N. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3172-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), demonstrating the importance of its availability for cellular protein synthesis. Despite the importance of eIF4E, little is known about the regulation of eIF4E protein expression levels. Transcription of the gene is induced in response to serum, growth factors (5Rosenwald I.B.

Differentiation. 2003; 71: 126-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The eIF4E promoter contains two c-Myc-binding sites (9Schmidt E.V. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3217-3221Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K-binding site (10Lynch M. Chen L. Ravitz M.J. Mehtani S. Korenblat K. Pazin M.J. Schmidt E.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6436-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), both of which are critical for the transcriptional regulation of eIF4E. However, the rate and mechanism of eIF4E degradation remain unclear, except that Othumpangat et al. (11Othumpangat S. Kashon M. Joseph P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25162-25169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) reported that eIF4E is ubiquitinated and degraded in a proteasome-dependent manner in response to heavy metal. Ubiquitin (Ub), a low molecular weight polypeptide composed of 76 amino acids, can be covalently conjugated to Lys residues in target proteins (12Shcherbik N. Haines D.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 13Pickart C.M. Eddins M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Ub conjugation is a well coordinated event involving several classes of enzymes, including ubiquitin-activating enzymes (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2), and ubiquitin ligases (E3). Protein ubiquitination is a signal for targeted recognition and ATP-dependent proteolysis by the 26 S proteasome. The Ub-proteasome pathway is an important factor controlling the expression and activity of regulatory proteins such as transcription factors or oncogenesis. Here, we have shown detailed analysis of eIF4E ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation. Cell Culture, Antibodies, and Reagents—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), and penicillin and streptomycin sulfate (Invitrogen). Rabbit anti-eIF4E and mouse anti-phospho-eIF4E antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), and mouse anti-tubulin antibody was from Oncogene Research Products (San Diego, CA). Mouse anti-Myc antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse and rabbit anti-FLAG antibodies were from Sigma. Mouse and rat anti-HA antibodies were obtained from Roche Applied Science. Horseradish peroxidase-linked goat antibodies to mouse or rabbit IgG were from Amersham Biosciences. Horseradish peroxidase-linked goat antibody to rat IgG was acquired from Jackson ImmunoResearch. MG132 was purchased from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). Plasmid Construction—For cloning human cDNAs, total RNA was prepared from HEK293T or Huh-7 cells and amplified by reverse transcription PCR. The coding region of human eIF4E was obtained and was cloned into the vector pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-FLAG (14Ohshima T. Shimotohno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50833-50842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) to generate pceIF4E or pcFLAGeIF4E, respectively. To prepare pcMycChip and pcMyc4E-BP1–3, the coding regions of human Chip and 4E-BP1–3 were amplified and cloned into pcDNA3-Myc (14Ohshima T. Shimotohno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50833-50842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).

Bold letters in the primers denote restriction sites. Expression plasmids for eIF4E point mutants were generated by PCR using pcFLAGeIF4E as a template. To create pcHAUb, the Ub gene was amplified by reverse transcription PCR and inserted into the BamHI site in the pcDNA3-HA (14Ohshima T. Shimotohno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50833-50842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation/Immunoblotting—HEK293T cells were transfected with appropriate plasmids using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). For immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting to detect ubiquitinated forms of eIF4E, cells were solubilized 24 h post-transfection in 100 μl of SDS(+) lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% SDS, and protease inhibitor mixture). Lysates were boiled for 5 min to completely denature proteins and disrupt non-covalent interactions. Cell lysates were then diluted with 900 μl of SDS(–) lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture) and precleared with protein-G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences. Supernatants were then mixed with antibody and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Immunocomplexes were recovered by incubating protein-G-Sepharose for 1 h, and the resin was washed five times with SDS(–) lysis buffer. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with indicated antibodies as described previously (15Murata T. Hijikata M. Shimotohno K. Virology. 2005; 340: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting to detect protein associations, SDS(–) lysis buffer was used and samples were not boiled before immunoprecipitation. m7GTP-Sepharose Precipitation/Immunoblotting—Hek293 cells were lysed in SDS(–) lysis buffer, precleared, incubated with 7-methyl GTP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 2 h, and then washed extensively with the same buffer. Precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described above. For highly efficient exposure, we used Lumigen TMA-6 Solution (Amersham Biosciences). Ubiquitination and Proteasome-dependent Degradation of eIF4E—To confirm ubiquitination of eIF4E in cells, we transfected HEK293T cells with FLAG-tagged eIF4E (pcFLAGeIF4E) and/or HA-tagged Ub (pcHAUb). Cellular proteins were then subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-FLAG antibody, followed by immunoblotting (IB) with anti-HA antibody (Fig. 1A, top panel). When both eIF4E and Ub were produced, mono- (eIF4E-Ub) or poly- (eIF4E-Ubn) ubiquitinated forms of eIF4E appeared (Fig. 1A, top panel, lane 4). The arrows in Fig. 1 depict the estimated size for non-ubiquitinated eIF4E. Ubiquitination was not detectable when either eIF4E or Ub alone was expressed (Fig. 1A, top panel, lanes 2 and 3), demonstrating the specific linkage of Ub and eIF4E. The membrane was stripped and probed with anti-FLAG antibody to confirm the successful precipitation of eIF4E protein (Fig. 1A, 2nd panel). Additionally, all transfected proteins were expressed and gels were loaded equally as shown in Fig. 1A, 3rd, 4th, and bottom panels. Non-ubiquitinated FLAGeIF4E protein resolved around 27 kDa and the mono-ubiquitinated form was ∼37 kDa. Additionally, we were able to detect mono-ubiquitinated eIF4E in whole cell extracts (WCE) (Fig. 1B, top panel, lane 3). The ubiquitination of eIF4E may be affected by its phosphorylation, cap binding, and eIF4G binding. We generated mutant forms of eIF4E to further examine this issue (Fig. 1C). We mutated Ser-209, the eIF4E residue phosphorylated by MAPK signal-integrating kinase (16Joshi B. Cai A.L. Keiper B.D. Minich W.B. Mendez R. Beach C.M. Stepinski J. Stolarski R. Darzynkiewicz E. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14597-14603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), Trp-56, a residue located within the eIF4E hydrophobic pocket, required for cap binding (17Cohen N. Sharma M. Kentsis A. Perez J.M. Strudwick S. Borden K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4547-4559Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and Trp-73, a residue essential for the interaction of eIF4E with eIF4G/4E-BP (18Pyronnet S. Imataka H. Gingras A.C. Fukunaga R. Hunter T. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Although the ubiquitination of either S209A or W56A eIF4E was comparable with that seen with WT eIF4E, the ubiquitination of the W73A mutant was dramatically increased (Fig. 1C, top panel, lane 6), suggesting a role of eIF4G/4E-BP association in regulating eIF4E ubiquitination. Ubiquitinated proteins are typically degraded by the proteasome, and we used MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, to examine whether eIF4E was degraded in this manner (Fig. 1, D and E). When cells co-transfected with pcFLAGeIF4E and pcHAUb were treated with MG132 for 12 h, we observed the accumulation of polyubiquitinated forms of eIF4E (Fig. 1D, top panel, lane 4). Mono-ubiquitinated eIF4E became less prominent with MG132 (Fig. 1D, top panel, lane 4), presumably because of the accumulation of other ubiquitinated target proteins. Although the levels of eIF4E mutants were almost comparable at 24 h after transfection (e.g. Fig. 1C, middle panel), the band for W73A eIF4E became very faint when incubated for 48 h (Fig. 1E, lane 4) or more (not shown). We assume the shorter half-life of the mutant protein is relevant to the enhanced ubiquitination (Fig. 1C, top panel, lane 6). At 24 h, degradation of the protein is not evident because it is compensated by the massive production from efficient plasmid vector, whereas at 48 h, the production becomes weaker and the degradation becomes apparent (see “Discussion”). Treatment with MG132 increased levels of both WT and W73A mutant eIF4E (Fig. 1E). MG132 was added at 24 h after transfection because it is toxic for cells when administered for more than 24 h. These results clearly demonstrate that eIF4E is ubiquitinated and degraded in a proteasome-dependent manner and suggest that the interaction of eIF4E with eIF4G/4E-BP is important for the regulation of eIF4E ubiquitination/degradation. Identification of Residues Required for eIF4E Ubiquitination—Target proteins are ubiquitinated on Lys residues, and eIF4E contains 16 Lys residues. To identify the particular residue(s) that become ubiquitinated, we generated a series of Lys to Arg (K/R) mutants (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–5). However, none of these 5 K/R mutants exhibited decreased ubiquitination compared with WT eIF4E, suggesting that multiple Lys residues may be ubiquitinated. Therefore, we next prepared an expression construct, pcFLAGeIF4EKallR, in which all Lys residues were mutated to Arg (Fig. 2A, lane 10), and, as expected, this mutant was hardly ubiquitinated. We subsequently generated 16 plasmids in which a single Lys residue of the KallR mutant was restored while the other Lys residues remained mutated (Fig. 2B, lanes 4–7, Fig. 2C, lanes 3–15). Interestingly, restoration of a single Lys, Lys-159, restored the ubiquitination of eIF4E to the same extent as WT (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 4). Thus, it is likely that Ub conjugation occurs primarily at Lys-159, although other Lys residues become Ub modified in the absence of this residue (Fig. 2A, lane 3). Effect of eIF4E Ubiquitination on m7GTP Association—Because cap binding is essential for eIF4E function, we examined eIF4E m7GTP binding using m7GTP-Sepharose (Fig. 3). FLAG-tagged eIF4E mutants were expressed in cells, and m7GTP-binding proteins were precipitated, followed by detection by IB. As expected, a W56A eIF4E mutant only weakly associated with m7GTP (Fig. 3A, lane 4) (17Cohen N. Sharma M. Kentsis A. Perez J.M. Strudwick S. Borden K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4547-4559Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), but the other eIF4E mutants examined, including KallR and K159R, all bound m7GTP as efficiently as WT eIF4E (Fig. 3A). We next wished to examine whether ubiquitinated eIF4E was capable of binding the cap structure. Cells were transfected with pcFLAGeIF4E mutants together with pcHAUb, and m7GTP-bound proteins were detected using anti-HA (Fig. 3B, upper left panel) and anti-FLAG (upper right panel) antibodies. The anti-HA antibody detected both mono-and polyubiquitinated proteins (Fig. 3B, upper left, lanes 2 and 5), and when precipitated material was blotted with anti-FLAG at least mono-ubiquitinated WT and K159R eIF4E were seen (Fig. 3B, upper right, lanes 2 and 5, arrowhead). Protein expression was confirmed in the lower panels of Fig. 3B. Ubiquitinated W56A and KallR eIF4E were not precipitated with m7GTP (Fig. 3B, upper panels, lanes 3 and 4), because the cap binding and ubiquitination of W56A and KallR mutants, respectively, are very low. Thus, these results suggest that ubiquitinated eIF4E remains capable of binding the cap structure. Effect of eIF4E Ubiquitination on Phosphorylation—We next wished to examine the possible relationship between eIF4E ubiquitination and phosphorylation, and we used a phospho-eIF4E antibody for these studies. As expected, this antibody did not react with the phosphorylation mutant S209A, although the WT and W56A mutants were phosphorylated (Fig. 4A, top panel, lanes 2–4). W73A also failed to be phosphorylated (Fig. 4A, top panel, lane 5). This is consistent with published reports indicating that MAPK signal-integrating kinase, the kinase responsible for eIF4E phosphorylation, is recruited by eIF4G (18Pyronnet S. Imataka H. Gingras A.C. Fukunaga R. Hunter T. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The KallR mutant showed little or no phosphorylation, whereas levels of K159R phosphorylation were normal (Fig. 4B, top panel, lanes 4 and 5). We next examined whether ubiquitinated eIF4E was phosphorylated. As depicted in the upper right panel of Fig. 4C, despite gross overexposure, mono-ubiquitinated eIF4E was not seen to be phosphorylated (Fig. 4C, upper right, lane 2, arrowhead), whereas ubiquitination of eIF4E in the same samples was evident when blotted with anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig. 4C, upper left and middle panels). Some faint bands were visible above 37 kDa in Fig. 4C (upper right panel), but we assume these are nonspecific. Therefore, we conclude that phosphorylation and ubiquitination may not occur simultaneously in a single eIF4E molecule. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that levels of eIF4E phosphorylation are very low if the molecule is modified with Ub. Effect of eIF4E Ubiquitination on eIF4G Binding—Because the association of eIF4E with eIF4G is essential for cap-mediated translation initiation, we analyzed the binding of eIF4E to eIF4G by IP and IB. HA-tagged eIF4G and FLAG-tagged eIF4E mutants were produced in cells, together with Myc-tagged Ub. eIF4G was isolated with anti-HA antibody, and eIF4G-associated eIF4E was detected with anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 5A, top, 2nd panel). Membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-HA antibody (Fig. 5A, 3rd panel). When WT FLAG-tagged eIF4E was co-expressed with eIF4G and Ub, only non-ubiquitinated eIF4E co-precipitated with eIF4G, even upon gross overexposure of the blot (Fig. 5A, 1st and 2nd panels, lanes 4–9). As expected, the W73A mutant of eIF4E did not associate with eIF4G, but the association of KallR mutant with eIF4G was also weak (Fig. 5A, top panel, lanes 7 and 8). As a control, we expressed FLAG-tagged WT eIF4E with Myc-tagged Ub and precipitated total eIF4E with anti-FLAG. As seen in Fig. 5A, 2nd panel, lane 1, at least mono-ubiquitinated eIF4E was detectable under these conditions, but ubiquitinated eIF4E was not found in the eIF4G-associated fractions (Fig. 5A, 2nd panel, lanes 4–9). As an additional control, we confirmed that the expression of eIF4G did not suppress eIF4E ubiquitination (Fig. 5B, top panel, lane 3). Thus, it is likely that eIF4G does not bind ubiquitinated forms of eIF4E with any appreciable affinity. 4E-BP Binding Suppresses eIF4E Ubiquitination and Degradation—4E-BP proteins bind eIF4E and negatively regulate cap-dependent translation initiation. To examine whether 4E-BP affects the ubiquitination of eIF4E, three 4E-BP isoforms were cloned, Myc tagged, and transfected into cells with Ub and eIF4E. Although mono-ubiquitinated eIF4E was clearly detected in the absence of 4E-BP (Fig. 6A, lanes 2, 5, and 8), 4E-BP production eliminated the observed ubiquitination (lanes 3, 6, and 9). Additionally, only non-ubiquitinated eIF4E was associated with 4E-BP (supplemental Fig. S1). We next determined whether 4E-BP expression affected eIF4E degradation (Fig. 6B). As depicted in Fig. 1E, eIF4E protein levels were lower in the absence of MG132 (Fig. 6B, top panel, lane 1), whereas levels were increased by the addition of MG132 (Fig. 6B, top panel, lane 2). Interestingly, when 4E-BP1, 2, or 3 was co-expressed, eIF4E levels in the absence of MG132 (Fig. 6B, top panel, lanes 3, 5, and 7) were almost comparable with those with the inhibitor (Fig. 6B, top panel, lanes 4, 6, and 8), suggesting that 4E-BP proteins inhibit the degradation of eIF4E. Taken together with the observation that the W73A mutant shows enhanced ubiquitination, these data strongly suggest that 4E-BP binding negatively regulates eIF4E ubiquitination and degradation. Chip-enhanced eIF4E Ubiquitination—Ubiquitination requires the concerted action of a series of enzymes, and actual Ub addition is performed by E3 ligases. We wished to determine the E3 ligase responsible for eIF4E ubiquitination, and we tested Chip, a well characterized E3 ligase. When cells were co-transfected with Chip and WT, S209A, W56A, and K159R eIF4E mutants, we observed the enhanced ubiquitination of all constructs (Fig. 7A, top panel). Additionally, KallR was ubiquitinated when Chip was co-expressed in cells (Fig. 7A, lane 5). Because there were no Lys residues in this eIF4E mutant, we speculate that the amino-terminal Met residue of this protein may be ubiquitinated (19Ciechanover A. Ben-Saadon R. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 103-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) or that the FLAG epitope contains a Lys residue that could be Ub modified. Ubiquitination of the W73A mutant was not clearly increased (Fig. 7A, lane 13), but ubiquitination levels of this mutant are likely saturated. A K30A Chip mutant that is unable to interact with Hsc70 (20Xu W. Marcu M. Yuan X. Mimnaugh E. Patterson C. Neckers L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12847-12852Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) did not enhance eIF4E ubiquitination (Fig. 7B, lane 4), whereas WT Chip did (lane 3). We next wished to determine whether eIF4E and Chip directly interacted by IP/IB. As shown in Fig. 8A, all forms of eIF4E examined interacted with Chip (Fig. 8A, top panel, lanes 3–8). Interestingly, eIF4E did not associate with the K30A Chip mutant (Fig. 8B, lane 4), suggesting that Chip associates with eIF4E via Hsc70. These data indicate that eIF4E can be ubiquitinated by Chip, possibly in an Hsc70-dependent manner. Heat Shock-enhanced eIF4E Ubiquitination—Cells respond to certain stimuli through regulating protein synthesis levels (21Holcik M. Sonenberg N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 318-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar, 22Morley S.J. Coldwell M.J. Clemens M.J. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 571-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Generally, under conditions of cell stress or apoptosis, cap-mediated translation is suppressed, whereas cap-independent, internal ribosome entry site-dependent translation increases. To clarify whether eIF4E ubiquitination plays a role in regulating these changes, we first examined levels of ubiquitination in heat-shocked cells (Fig. 9A). When cells were heat shocked (45 °C, 10 min), Ub conjugation became evident 2 h after heat shock (Fig. 9A, top panel, lane 4), and levels then returned to normal after 4–8 h (Fig. 9A, lanes 6, 8, and 10). Heat shock also induced KallR mutant ubiquitination (Fig. 9B, top panel, lane 7). Heat shock and Chip expression could additively or synergistically enhance eIF4E ubiquitination. We co-transfected cells with FLAG-tagged eIF4E, HA-Ub, and/or Myc-Chip, and samples were collected 2 h after heat shock (45 °C 10 min) (Fig. 9C). Although heat shock or Chip expression independently induced the ubiquitination of eIF4E (Fig. 9C, top panel, lanes 3 and 4), the combination of heat shock and Chip expression did not increase ubiquitination levels (lane 5). It is likely that each condition alone induced maximal eIF4E ubiquitination. Ubiquitination and Degradation of Endogenous eIF4E—We then wished to see the ubiquitination of endogenous eIF4E (Fig. 10A). It was not visible under normal condition, but mono-ubiquitinated endogenous eIF4E was detected (Fig. 10A, middle panel, lane 3) when cells were heat shocked, eIF4E protein was concentrated by m7GTP-Sepharose precipitation, and highly effective ECL solution was used. The 24-kDa band for endogenous eIF4E whited out (Fig. 10A, middle panel) because the ECL solution was too strong. In Fig. 10, B and C, we carried out pulse-chase labeling of endogenous eIF4E. With heat shock, the levels of eIF4E decreased more rapidly (down to 55% at 15 h) and addition of MG132, an inhibitor of proteasome-dependent degradation pathway, restored the levels. These results indicate that endogenous eIF4E protein is also degraded in the Ub/proteasome-dependent manner. Protein synthesis is a tightly controlled process essential for cell survival, and in this study we described the ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of the cap-binding protein eIF4E. We summarize our working hypothesis in supplemental Fig. S2. We identified the most probable site for Ub conjugation as Lys-159. The crystal structure of eIF4E has been solved (23Marcotrigiano J. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Burley S.K. Cell. 1997; 89: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 24Tomoo K. Shen X. Okabe K. Nozoe Y. Fukuhara S. Morino S. Ishida T.

Okabe K. Nozoe Y. Fukuhara S. Morino S. Sasaki M. Taniguchi T. Miyagawa H. Kitamura K. Miura K. Ishida T. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 365-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and Lys-159 is in the middle of two β-sheets, S5 and S6. The side chain of this residue protrudes outward (25Tomoo K. Shen X. Okabe K. Nozoe Y. Fukuhara S. Morino S. Sasaki M. Taniguchi T. Miyagawa H. Kitamura K. Miura K. Ishida T. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 365-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), suggesting it is readily accessible for Ub conjugation by E3 ligases. Interestingly, there is a relationship between Lys-159 and the phosphorylated residue Ser-209. Phosphorylation of Ser-209 causes a retractable salt bridge to form with Lys-159 to clamp the cap moiety and thereby lead to increased binding of capped mRNA (23Marcotrigiano J. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Burley S.K. Cell. 1997; 89: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 26Minich W.B. Balasta M.L. Goss D.J. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7668-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In addition, because the K159A mutant exhibited reduced association with cap analogues (27Zuberek J. Jemielity J. Jablonowska A. Stepinski J. Dadlez M. Stolarski R. Darzynkiewicz E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5370-5379Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), Lys-159 is involved in the binding of capped mRNA. However, we saw no reduction in m7GTP association with the K159R mutant (Fig. 3). Additionally, we did not observe reduced m7GTP association with ubiquitinated eIF4E. The attachment of a Ub molecule to Lys-159 might stabilize the distance between Ser-209 (S7-S8 loop) and Lys-159 (S5-S6 loop), similar to phosphorylation (23Marcotrigiano J. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Burley S.K. Cell. 1997; 89: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the Ub molecule may form a bridge between Ser-209 (S7-S8 loop) and Lys-159 (S5-S6 loop) and hold the triphosphate moiety tightly. Additionally, ubiquitination of the S209A mutant of eIF4E was comparable with WT, suggesting that phosphorylation does not affect ubiquitination (Fig. 1C). The W73A mutant of eIF4E, which only weakly binds eIF4G/4E-BP, showed enhanced ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation (Fig. 1). What is more, expression of 4E-BP clearly reduced the levels of eIF4E ubiquitination and degradation (Fig. 6). Because the only known role for 4E-BP has been as inhibitor of cap-mediated translation initiation, we are suggesting a novel role for 4E-BP as a protector of eIF4E. 4E-BP can inhibit cap-mediated protein synthesis by binding eIF4E, but at the same time may preserve a population of inactive eIF4E-mRNA complexes by preventing eIF4E degradation. Several reports have linked 4E-BP to cellular stress (28Vries R.G. Flynn A. Patel J.C. Wang X. Denton R.M. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32779-32784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 29Teleman A.A. Chen Y.W. Cohen S.M. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1844-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 30Tettweiler G. Miron M. Jenkins M. Sonenberg N. Lasko P.F. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1840-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). 4E-BP binds eIF4E under conditions of stress or reduced growth stimuli. When cells are removed from stress and growth conditions become favorable, pre-existing eIF4E-mRNA complexes can be used for immediate protein synthesis after 4E-BP release. Thus, 4E-BP buffers stress by suppressing protein synthesis and preparing cells for a swift recovery. It is quite interesting to find that the levels of endogenous eIF4E ubiquitination were very low (e.g. Fig. 10A), whereas degradation of the protein was relatively clear (e.g. Fig. 10, B and C). Ubiquitinated fraction was <1% in Fig. 10A, whereas the eIF4E decreased by 45% at 15 h after heat shock in Fig. 10, B and C. This is similar to the ubiquitination/degradation of the W73A mutant in that most of the W73A mutant protein stayed nonubiquitinated (Fig. 1C, middle panel, lane 6), whereas >90% of eIF4E degraded at 48 h (Fig. 1E, upper panel, lane 4). We thus speculate that the efficiency of Ub conjugation is the bottleneck, and once ubiquitinated, it is proteolyzed rapidly. The mechanism of eIF4E ubiquitination/degradation is similar to that of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane-tethered dolichol-phosphate-mannose (DPM) synthase (31Ashida H. Maeda Y. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11595-11602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). DPM1 is tethered by DPM3 to the membrane. When tethering is abolished and DPM1 becomes free, DPM1 is rapidly ubiquitinated by Chip and degraded by the proteasome. Telomeric repeat binding factor 1 and E2F transcription factors are also protected from Ub targeting and degradation by binding their partners, and these proteins are degraded after binding partner release (32Hateboer G. Kerkhoven R.M. Shvarts A. Bernards R. Beijersbergen R.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2960-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 33Chang W. Dynek J.N. Smith S. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1328-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Because these proteins function as complexes, it is likely important to regulate the levels of the free proteins. Thus, this may be a common mechanism of protein expression regulation in cells. When examining the bottom panel of Fig. 6B, levels of 4E-BP, especially 4E-BP2 and 3, were increased by the addition of MG132. This suggests that 4E-BP is degraded in a Ub/proteasome-dependent manner. As 4E-BP is an important regulator of protein synthesis, the regulation of this process is of great interest. During the preparation of this report, Othumpangat et al. (11Othumpangat S. Kashon M. Joseph P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25162-25169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) reported that eIF4E is proteolyzed after ubiquitination when cells are exposed to cadmium chloride. We confirmed this finding (data not shown), and because cadmium presumably acts as a cell stressor, this finding supports our hypothesis that Ub modification of eIF4E is enhanced following cell stress. Cells respond to stress or apoptotic stimuli through regulating protein synthesis levels (21Holcik M. Sonenberg N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 318-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar, 22Morley S.J. Coldwell M.J. Clemens M.J. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 571-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms regulating cell reactions to such stimuli remain elusive. Chip, an E3 ligase, and stresses, such as heat shock and cadmium, enhanced the Ub conjugation of eIF4E. Because Chip is involved in the quality control of proteins in cells (34Goldberg A.L. Nature. 2003; 426: 895-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar, 35McClellan A.J. Tam S. Kaganovich D. Frydman J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 736-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), the ubiquitination/degradation of eIF4E may be, at least in part, controlling protein synthesis in response to stress. eIF4E plays an important role in translation initiation, and it is important to understand the processes regulating eIF4E protein expression levels, including its degradation. Because eIF4E functions in association with many factors, future studies should examine the role of eIF4E ubiquitination within the context of the entire translation initiation complex. We thank Drs. N. Sonenberg and K. Yoshida (McGill University, Canada) for providing the pcDNA3.1HA-eIF4GI vector and for helpful discussions. We thank Drs. T. Ohshima and M.

https://openalex.org/W2103633212,"Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer, with no cure for advanced disease. We propose a strategy for melanoma prevention based on using analogs of alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) that function as melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) agonists. Treatment of human melanocytes with alpha-MSH results in stimulation of eumelanin synthesis, reduction of apoptosis that is attributable to reduced hydrogen peroxide generation and enhanced repair of DNA photoproducts. These effects should contribute to genomic stability of human melanocytes, thus preventing their malignant transformation to melanoma. Based on these findings, we synthesized and tested the effects of 3 tetrapeptide alpha-MSH analogs, Ac-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-NH2, n-Pentadecanoyl- and 4-Phenylbutyryl-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-NH2, on cultured human melanocytes. The latter two analogs were more potent than the former, or alpha-MSH, in stimulating the activity of tyrosinase, thus melanogenesis, reducing apoptosis and release of hydrogen peroxide and enhancing repair of DNA photoproducts in melanocytes exposed to UV radiation (UVR). The above analogs are MC1R agonists, as their effects were abrogated by an analog of agouti signaling protein, the physiological MC1R antagonist, and were absent in melanocytes expressing loss-of-function MC1R. Analogs, such as 4-Phenylbutyryl-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-NH2 with prolonged and reversible effects, can potentially be developed into topical agents to prevent skin photocarcinogenesis, particularly melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W1980981309,"Interleukin-10 (IL-10) exerts its anti-inflammatory properties by down-regulating polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) functions such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) production via NADPH oxidase. The molecular mechanisms underlying this process are unclear. Partial phosphorylation of the NADPH oxidase cytosolic component p47(PHOX) induced by proinflammatory cytokines, such as granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, is essential for priming ROS production by PMN. The aim of this study was to determine whether IL-10 inhibits GM-CSF- and TNFalpha-induced p47(PHOX) phosphorylation and to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in this effect. We found that IL-10 selectively inhibited GM-CSF- but not TNFalpha-induced p47PHOX phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner. As GM-CSF-induced p47PHOX phosphorylation is mediated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), we tested the effect of IL-10 on this pathway. We found that IL-10 inhibited GM-CSF-induced ERK1/2 activity in an immunocomplex kinase assay. This inhibitory effect was confirmed by analyzing the phosphorylation status of the endogenous substrate of ERK1/2, p90RSK, in intact PMN. Furthermore, IL-10 decreased ROS production by adherent GM-CSF-treated PMN in keeping with the higher ROS production observed in whole blood from IL-10 knockout mice compared to their wild-type counterparts. Together, these results suggest that IL-10 inhibits GM-CSF-induced priming of ROS production by inhibiting p47PHOX phosphorylation through a decrease in ERK1/2 activity. This IL-10 effect could contribute to the tight regulation of NADPH oxidase activity at the inflammatory site."
https://openalex.org/W1993393187,"Although Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae express very similar systems of iron uptake, these species differ in their capacity to use heme as a nutritional iron source. Whereas C. albicans efficiently takes up heme, S. cerevisiae grows poorly on media containing heme as the sole source of iron. We identified a gene from C. albicans that would enhance heme uptake when expressed in S. cerevisiae. Overexpression of CaFLC1 (for flavin carrier 1) stimulated the growth of S. cerevisiae on media containing heme iron. In C. albicans, deletion of both alleles of CaFLC1 resulted in a decrease in heme uptake activity, whereas overexpression of CaFLC1 resulted in an increase in heme uptake. The S. cerevisiae genome contains three genes with homology to CaFLC1, and two of these, termed FLC1 and FLC2, also stimulated growth on heme when overexpressed in S. cerevisiae. The S. cerevisiae Flc proteins were detected in the endoplasmic reticulum and the FLC genes encoded an essential function, as strains deleted for either FLC1 or FLC2 were viable, but deletion of both FLC1 and FLC2 was synthetically lethal. FLC gene deletion resulted in pleiotropic phenotypes related to defects in cell wall integrity. High copy suppressors of this synthetic lethality included three mannosyltransferases, VAN1, KTR4, and HOC1. FLC deletion strains exhibited loss of cell wall mannose phosphates, defects in cell wall assembly, and delayed maturation of carboxypeptidase Y. Permeabilized cells lacking FLC proteins exhibited dramatic loss of FAD import activity.

Iron is an essential nutrient for virtually all microorganisms because iron is required for the activity of a variety of enzymes that bind this metal in the form of free ions, heme, and ironsulfur clusters. Microbes living in different environments encounter iron in different forms, and pathogenic bacteria and fungi have evolved specific strategies for obtaining iron from their mammalian hosts. Heme is the most abundant source of iron in the mammalian host and heme uptake systems have been described in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Gram-negative pathogens, such as Shigella dysenteriae, express an outer membrane receptor for heme, ShuA, which facilitates the movement of heme into the periplasmic space, where it is bound by the periplasmic heme-binding protein, ShuT, which delivers the heme to an ABC transporter consisting of ShuU and ShuV (1Eakanunkul S.

Science. 2004; 305: 1626-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). S. aureus does not contain an outer membrane, but instead expresses two cell wall-associated proteins, IsdA and IsdC, that bind and transport heme, respectively, across the cell wall before it is taken up at the cytoplasmic membrane by a transporter of the ABC family (4Mazmanian S.K. Skaar E.P. Gaspar A.H. Humayun M. Gornicki P. Jelenska J. Joachmiak A. Missiakas D.M. Schneewind O. Science. 2003; 299: 906-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Although heme transport systems have been described for many bacterial species, much less is known about heme transport in eukaryotes. Two mammalian proteins with heme transport activity have recently been described. The receptor for feline leukemia virus type C is a transporter required for the development of erythroid cells, and the human ortholog of this transporter can facilitate the export of intracellular heme (5Quigley J.G. Yang Z. Worthington M.T. Phillips J.D. Sabo K.M. Sabath D.E. Berg C.L. Sassa S. Wood B.L. Abkowitz J.L. Cell. 2004; 118: 757-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Shayeghi and colleagues (6Shayeghi M. Latunde-Dada G.O. Oakhill J.S. Laftah A.H. Takeuchi K. Halliday N. Khan Y. Warley A. McCann F.E. Hider R.C. Frazer D.M. Anderson G.J. Vulpe C.D. Simpson R.J.

Cell. 2005; 122: 789-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) reported the identification of a murine heme transporter, HCP1, expressed on the apical surface of duodenal epithelial cells. This transporter has similarity to bacterial metal-tetracycline transporters, but no clear ortholog has been identified in non-mammalian species. Free-living worms such as Caenorhabditis elegans and parasitic helminths have an absolute requirement for dietary heme transport, as these organisms completely lack the capacity to synthesize heme de novo (7Rao A.U. Carta L.K. Lesuisse E. Hamza I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4270-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Heme transporters in these organisms have yet to be identified. Candida albicans is a dimorphic fungus that is part of the commensal flora of the human gastrointestinal tract and is frequently associated with mucocutaneous infections. In patients with compromised immune systems, Candida species can disseminate hematogenously and cause life-threatening infections. This fungus efficiently uses heme as a nutritional source of iron and exhibits strategies to acquire heme from host erythrocytes. Candida spp. secrete hemolytic factors that lead to the release of erythrocyte hemoglobin (8Manns J.M. Mosser D.M. Buckley H.R. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5154-5156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and hemoglobin binds to the cell wall of both yeast and hyphal forms of the fungus (9Pendrak M.L. Yan S.S. Roberts D.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 426: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recently, a cell surface heme-binding protein, Rbt5, was shown to be involved in heme-iron utilization (10Weissman Z. Kornitzer D. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1209-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Although a plasma membrane transport system for heme has not been identified, intracellular degradation of heme through the heme oxygenase encoded by CaHMX1 is required for hemeiron utilization (11Pendrak M.L. Chao M.P. Yan S.S. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3426-3433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 12Santos R. Buisson N. Knight S. Dancis A. Camadro J.M. Lesuisse E. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Although C. albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae express very similar systems of iron uptake (13Van Ho A. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2002; 56: 237-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), they differ in their capacity to use heme as a nutritional source of iron. Both species utilize reductive systems of iron uptake and express plasma membrane metalloreductases of the FRE family coupled to a ferrous iron transporter complex that consists of a permease (Ftr1) and a multicopper oxidase (Fet3). Both species also utilize non-reductive systems consisting of siderophore-iron transporters of the ARN/SIT family. Heme uptake in C. albicans occurs independently of the reductive system and submicromolar concentrations of heme or hemoglobin will support vigorous growth of a strain lacking high affinity ferrous iron transport (12Santos R. Buisson N. Knight S. Dancis A. Camadro J.M. Lesuisse E. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Similar concentrations of heme and hemoglobin do not stimulate growth of a S. cerevisiae strain lacking ferrous uptake (15Weissman Z. Shemer R. Kornitzer D. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1551-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We exploited this difference in heme utilization to identify genes from C. albicans that, when expressed in S. cerevisiae, would enhance heme uptake activity. We identified a family of fungal-specific proteins that are required for the transport of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), 2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HA, hemagglutinin; ORF, open reading frame; M-Pol, mannan polymerase; CPY, carboxypeptidase Y; UPRE, unfolded protein response element. where it is required for oxidative protein folding. Yeast Strains and Media—C. albicans strains were constructed in BWP17 (ura3::imm434/ura3::imm434 his1::hisG/his1::hisG arg4::hisG/arg4::hisG) (kind gift from J. Berman). Disruption strains were constructed using PCR-mediated gene disruption as previously described (16Wilson R.B. Davis D. Mitchell A.P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1868-1874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A flc1::HIS1 PCR product was amplified with the primers Ipf4012-499-F-d and Ipf4012-1198-R-d (see Table 1) with pGEM-HIS1 as the DNA template and the flc1::HIS1 product was transformed into BWP17. For disruption of the second allele, the disruption cassette was PCR amplified using the same pair of primers and pGEM-URA3 as template (17Wilson R.B. Davis D. Enloe B.M. Mitchell A.P. Yeast. 2000; 16: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The flc1::URA3 fragment was transformed into the flc1::HIS1 strain. C. albicans strains were made prototrophic by transformation with linearized pGEM-HIS1, pGEM-URA3, and pRS-ARG-URA-BN (18Davis D. Edwards Jr., J.E. Mitchell A.P. Ibrahim A.S. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5953-5959Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar).

PCR-mediated gene disruption was used to generate gene deletions, and all strains were tested for correct genome integration by PCR. For deletion of FLC1, the YPH499 strain was transformed with a PCR product amplified from genomic DNA isolated from the YPL221C haploid deletion mutant (MATa ura3 met-15 his3-1 leu2-1 ypl221c::KANR) (Research Genetics) using primers YPL221w-200-R and YPL221w-200-F. Geneticin-resistant clones were selected on YPD plates containing 80 mg/liter G418 (Invitrogen). To delete FLC2 the HISG-URA3-HISG cassette was PCR amplified from plasmid pMPY-ZAP (19Schneider B.L. Steiner B. Seufert W. Futcher A.B. Yeast. 1996; 12: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) using the primers del-053-F and del-053-R. YPH499 was transformed with that PCR product to generate the flc2Δ strain. The same procedure was used to delete FLC2 in the flc1Δ strain transformed with plasmid pMET3-FLC1. Clones containing the correctly targeted deletion cassette were plated on 5-fluoroorotic acid-containing plates and 5-fluoroorotic acid-resistant clones were selected. The TET-FLC1flc2Δflc3Δ strain was constructed in R1158 (MATa his3-1 leu2-0 met15-0 URA3::CMV-tTA) (20Mnaimneh S. Davierwala A.P. Haynes J. Moffat J. Peng W.T. Zhang W. Yang X. Pootoolal J. Chua G.

The complete coding sequence for FLC3 was replaced by the URA3 gene from plasmid Yep352, using primers YGL139W-up (URA3) and YGL139W-down (URA3). All constructs and strains generated were verified by extensive PCR analysis and selection on the appropriate media. The fet3Δ and fet3Δ hmx1Δ strains were constructed as described (22Protchenko O.

Lee-Buckley-Campbell media used to induce hyphal growth of C. albicans strains was made as described (26Lee K.L. Buckley H.R. Campbell C.C. Sabouraudia. 1975; 13: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) with addition of 50 μm bathophenanthroline disulfonate and 1 μm hemin. Milk-Tween agar media was prepared as described (27Jitsurong S. Kiamsiri S. Pattararangrong N. Mycopathologia. 1993; 123: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To create hypoxic conditions, cultures were incubated in an anaerobic chamber using a BBL-GasPak (BD Biosciences) for 5 h. Plasmids and Libraries—A C. albicans genomic DNA library was constructed in a S. cerevisiae 2-μm vector and was a kind gift from J. Berman. The S. cerevisiae genomic DNA library in 2-μm vector YEp13 was obtained from ATCC. The CaFLC1 open reading frame (ORF) was amplified using primers CA_BMST_F and ca_NCSM_R, digested with SacI and NcoI, and ligated into the SacI and NcoI sites of the vector YIpDCE51 (23Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Gene. 1998; 212: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) to construct plasmid YIpDCE1-CaFLC1. This plasmid was linearized with StuI for integration at ADE2. Plasmids pCaFLC1, pFLC1, pFLC2, and pFLC3 were constructed using vector pYX242 and the PCR-amplified ORFs of the corresponding genes. For pCaFLC1, primers CA_BMST_F and ca_NCSM_R were used and the library clone containing CaFLC1 was the template. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and SmaI and inserted into the same sites of the vector. Primer pair YPL221-F and YPL221-R was used to amplify FLC1, YAL053-F and YAL053-R for FLC2, and YGL139-F and YGL139-R for FLC3. Genomic DNA from S. cerevisiae YPH499 was used as the template to amplify FLC1, FLC2, and FLC3. FLC1 was inserted into EcoRI/SmaI sites, FLC2 into HindII/SmaI, and FLC3 into NcoI/ApaI of pYX242. To construct epitope-tagged genes, a triple copy of the HA tag was amplified by PCR using primers 221-cHA-F and 221-cHA-R for FLC1 and in vivo recombination in yeast was used to insert this PCR product into the C terminus of FLC1 in plasmid pYX-FLC1 cut with SmaI. The resulting plasmid, pYX-FLC1-HA, was subsequently rescued from yeast and amplified in Escherichia coli. The same method was used to make plasmids expressing pYX-FLC2-HA and pYX-FLC3-HA. Primers 221-cHA-R and YAL053-cHA-F were used for pYX-FLC2-HA. Primers 221-cHA-R and YGL139-cHA-F were used for pYX-FLC3-HA. Functionality of carboxyl terminus HA-tagged versions of FLC1, FLC2, and FLC3 was confirmed by complementation of the flc1Δflc2Δ pMET3-FLC1 strain on media supplemented with methionine. To make plasmid pRS416-FLC1-HA, the promoter region of FLC1 was PCR amplified from genomic DNA using primers prom-YPL221-F and prom-YPL221-R and digested with KpnI and EcoRI. This KpnI/EcoRI fragment and EcoRI/SmaI fragment from pYX-FLC1-HA were subsequently ligated into Kpn/EcoRI and EcoRI/SmaI sites of pRS426. KpnI/NotI fragment was cut from this plasmid and ligated into Kpn/NotI sites of pRS416. To make plasmid pRS415-FLC2-HA, a PstI/BamHI fragment from the FLC2 library clone containing the FLC2 upstream sequences and a BamHI/SacII fragment of the FLC2 ORF from plasmid pYX-HUF2-HA were ligated into the PstI/SacII sites of pRS415. To make plasmid pRS413-FLC3-HA, a HindIII/EcoRI fragment containing the promoter region of FLC3 from the FLC3 library clone and the EcoRI/SmaI fragment from pYX-FLC3-HA were ligated into HindIII/SmaI sites of pRS415. Then the ApaI/SmaI fragment of this plasmid was ligated into the same sites of pRS413. To make plasmid pMET3-FLC1, the EcoRI/SmaI fragment of the FLC1 gene from pYX-FLC1-HA was inserted into vector pRS313-MET3 cut with the same restriction enzymes. To make plasmid pVAN1, the ORF of VAN1 was amplified by PCR from the VAN1 library clone using primers Van1-pr-F and Van1-pr-R and digested with XbaI and SmaI. This fragment was inserted into XbaI/SmaI sites of YEp351. The plasmid pKTR4 was made by inserting the KTR4 gene into the PstI/HindIII sites of YEp351. KTR4 was amplified by PCR using primers KTR4-pr-f and KTR4-pr-r from the KTR4 library clone. Plasmid pPTC1 was made by inserting the PTC1 gene into the XbaI/SmaI sites of YEp351 using primers PTC1+pr-F and PTC1+pr-R from the PTC1 library clone. Plasmid pHOC1 was made by inserting HOC1 into XhoI/SacI sites of pRS426 using primers Hoc1-t-F and Hoc1-t-R and genomic DNA of S. cerevisiae YPH499 as the template. To make plasmid pMNN9, the MNN9 gene was inserted into the XbaI/ClaI sites of pRS426 using primers MnnI-t-F and MnnI-t-R and genomic DNA as template. Plasmid pMET3-CaFLC1 was constructed by subcloning the SmaI/BamHI fragment of pCaFLC1 with CaFLC1 ORF into vector pCaEXP (28Care R.S. Trevethick J. Binley K.M. Sudbery P.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Vector was digested with PstI, treated with Klenow fragment, and then digested with BamHI. Plasmid was linearized with StuI and integrated into the RP10 locus of the C. albicans genome. Plasmids pGAL-FLC1 (pBG1800-YPL221W) and pGAL1-FAD1 (pBG1805-YDL044C) were obtained from the YEAST ORF collection (Open Biosystems). Functionality of the cloned genes was confirmed by sequencing and/or phenotypic analysis. Plasmid pJS401 with UPRE-LacZ was a gift from D. Griffith (29Griffith D.A. Delipala C. Leadsham J.

Cell lysate was applied to the top of 20-60% continuous sucrose gradient. Samples were centrifuged at 28,500 × g for 17 h and 0.9-ml fractions were collected. Lysates and gradients were prepared with EDTA or 2 mm MgCl2. Western blotting was performed using a 1:4000 dilution of HA.11 (Covance) as the primary antibody followed by 1:3000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Antibody to Dpm1, porin, and Vps10 were purchased from Molecular Probes and used according to the manufacturer's manual. Anti-Gas1p antibody was used at 1:5000 dilution (32Horvath A. Sutterlin C.

Glucose was added to 2% and cells were incubated 24 h more. Cells were pulsed-labeled with l-[35S]methionine for 12 min and chased with unlabeled cysteine and methionine for the indicated number of minutes. Immunoprecipitation was performed using a monoclonal anti-CPY antibody (Molecular Probes). The immunoprecipitate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. Electron Microscopy—S. cerevisiae R1158 and the triple mutant TET-FLC1flc2Δflc3Δ strains were grown to an A600 of 0.2 in liquid YPD at 30 °C with shaking. Cultures were divided, and doxycycline was added to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml; the other half did not receive any additions and was used as control. Subcultures were incubated an additional 9 h. Cells were pelleted and washed twice with water and then fixed in 1.5% (w/v) potassium permanganate for 20 min at room temperature with occasional mixing. The cells were then washed with water, incubated in 0.5% sodium periodate for 20 min at room temperature, washed with water, incubated for 15 min in 1% ammonium chloride, washed with water again, and left overnight in 1% uranyl acetate at 4 °C.

Cells from 50-100 ml of culture were harvested and suspended at a density of 50 A600 units/ml in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.4, and 10 mm dithiothreitol and incubated 5 min at room temperature. Cells were centrifuged and re-suspended in 1 ml of 0.75 × SC with or without 1 mm methionine, 0.5% glucose, 0.7 m sorbitol, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 0.5 mg/ml zymolyase T-100. After 30 min incubation at 30 °C, spheroplasts were collected and resuspended in 0.75 × SCM containing 0.7 m sorbitol and 1% glucose with or without 1 mm methionine.

Here, we analyzed maspin function in cell adhesion in nontransformed mammary epithelial cells and investigated the underlying mechanism involved in this process. We report that maspin acts in the early steps in the cell adhesion process. Addition of recombinant maspin rapidly increased MCF-10A cell adhesion to the endogenously deposited matrix, and conversely both an antimaspin antibody (Ab) and maspin knockdown by RNA interference resulted in decreased cell adhesion. Mutation analyses revealed that a region of 86 amino acids located between aa 139 and aa 225 was responsible for maspin effect on adhesion. In addition, we show that maspin is associated with detergent-insoluble cortical cytoskeleton elements. Collectively, these results suggest that maspin is part of the supramolecular structure of the adhesion plaque and it modulates cell adhesion via a beta1 integrin-dependent mechanism."

However, very few studies have investigated the regulation of EAAT expression.

RFX proteins are transcription factors binding to X-boxes of DNA sequences. Although RFX proteins are necessary for the normal function of sensory neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans, their roles in the mammalian brain are not known. We showed that RFX1 increased EAAT3 expression and activity in C6 glioma cells. RFX1 binding complexes were found in the nuclear extracts of C6 cells. The activity of EAAT3 promoter as measured by luciferase reporter activity was increased by RFX1 in C6 cells and the neuron-like SH-SY5Y cells. However, RFX1 did not change the expression of EAAT2 proteins in the NRK52E cells. RFX1 proteins were expressed in the neurons of rat brain. A high expression level of RFX1 proteins was found in the neurons of cerebral cortex and Purkinje cells. Knockdown of the RFX1 expression by RFX1 antisense oligonucleotides decreased EAAT3 expression in rat cortical neurons in culture.

Glutamate transporters (excitatory amino acid transporters, EAAT) 2The abbreviations used are: EAAT, excitatory amino acid transporters; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; RFX, regulatory factor X. are expressed in many organs and tissues including brain and kidney (1Danbolt N.C. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 1-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3798) Google Scholar). They use the transmembrane gradients of Na+, K+, and H+ as a driving force to uptake glutamate from extracellular space into cells (2Billups B. Rossi D. Oshima T. Warr O. Takahashi M. Sarantis M. Szatkowski M. Attwell D. Prog. Brain Res. 1998; 116: 45-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter, the role of EAAT in the function of the central nervous system has attracted significant attentions. Evidence has suggested that EAATs play an important role in maintaining extracellular glutamate homeostasis and regulating glutamate neurotransmission (3Barbour B. Keller B.U. Llano I. Marty A. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1331-1343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 4Diamond J.S. Jahr C.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4672-4687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Mennerick S. Zorumski C.F. Nature. 1994; 368: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Five EAATs have been characterized so far (1Danbolt N.C. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 1-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3798) Google Scholar). EAAT1, EAAT2, and EAAT3 have been found in many regions and structures of the brain. EAAT4 is mainly expressed in the cerebellum. EAAT5 is expressed in the retina (1Danbolt N.C. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 1-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3798) Google Scholar). In the brain, EAAT1 and EAAT2 are expressed in the glial cells. EAAT3 and EAAT4 are mainly found in the neurons. Regulatory factor X (RFX) proteins are transcription factors that bind X-boxes of DNA sequences with a conserved 76-residue DNA binding domain in their molecules (6Emery P. Durand B. Mach B. Reith W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). There are five RFXs (RFX1-5) in the human. RFX1 is a prototypic mammalian RFX that contains 979 amino acids and was initially thought to interact with the X-box in the class II major histocompatibility complex gene (6Emery P. Durand B. Mach B. Reith W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 7Reith W. Barras E. Satola S. Kobr M. Reinhart D. Sanchez C.H. Mach B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4200-4204Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, its role in the regulation of major histocompatibility complex expression has not been proven yet. Since the knockout of the RFX homologue in Caenorhabditis elegans results in severe sensory defects (8Swoboda P. Adler H.T. Thomas J.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 411-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that mammalian RFXs may play an important role in the nervous system. However, up until now, there is no report documenting the expression regulation of a neuronally expressed gene by RFXs in the mammalian nervous cells. It has been shown that multiple agents, such as volatile anesthetics, cause acute changes of EAAT activity (9Huang Y. Zuo Z. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1522-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 10Sims K.D. Straff D.J. Robinson M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5228-5237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In EAAT3, this acute change of activity is mediated by the redistribution of EAAT3 from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane, the functional site of EAAT3 (9Huang Y. Zuo Z. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1522-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In contrast, very few studies have investigated the regulation of EAAT expression. There is no study on regulating the promoter activity of EAAT3 yet. By analyzing the sequences of the promoter regions for human EAAT1, EAAT2, and EAAT3, we found that only the EAAT3 promoter region contains a consensus binding sequence for RFX1. Thus, we hypothesize that RFX1 can specifically regulate the expression of EAAT3. Cell Culture and Transfection—Rat C6 glioma cells from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) were maintained in F-10 nutrient mixture (Ham's) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% horse serum and 2.5% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C. Rat normal kidney NRK-52E cells (American Type Culture Collection number CRL-1571) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum at 37 °C. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (American Type Culture Collection number CRL-2266) were cultured with a 1:1 mixture of Eagle's minimum essential medium with non-essential acids and Ham's F12 medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with RFX1 or EAAT3-Luc plasmids using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagents (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cerebral cortical neurons in culture were prepared from fetuses of 16-18-day gestation Sprague-Dawley rats as we described before (11Zuo Z. Tichotsky A. Johns R.A. Neuroscience. 1999; 93: 1167-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). They were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm HEPES, 10% Ham's F12 medium, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen). The cultures were treated with 10 μg/ml cytosine-β-d-arabino-furanoside for 24 h to stop non-neuronal cell proliferation on days 4 and 5. Subsequent feeding was with the above described medium but without Ham's F-12 to eliminate glutamate from feeding. Treatment of Neuronal Cultures with Oligonucleotides—After the cells were in culture for 7-9 days, rat cerebral cortical neurons were treated with 5 μm RFX1 antisense or sense oligonucleotides for 96 h. The sequences of RFX1 antisense and sense oligonucleotides were from a previous publication (12Siegrist C.A. Mach B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2903-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar): 5′-ggtcagctggaggg-3′ (antisense) and 5′-ccctccagctgacc-3′ (sense). The oligonucleotides were phosphorothioate derivatives to prolong their half-lives. Plasmid Construction—RFX1 plasmid (pRFX1) containing the coding region for human RFX1 protein in pCMV vector was provided by Dr. Patrick Hearing (State University of New York at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY). EAAT3-Luc plasmid was constructed by inserting the human EAAT3 promoter region (from -1 to -482) including the putative RFX1 binding sequence, 5′-gggtggcggcggcaacggc-3′, into the pGL3-Luc vector (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) using the enzymes KpnI-BIgII. The construct was then confirmed by DNA sequencing. Luciferase Activity Assay—After being plated on 12-well plates (Corning Inc., New York, NY) for 20-24 h, C6 cells or SH-SY5Y cells at 50-70% confluence were transiently transfected with the EAAT3-Luc plasmid (0.5 μg/well) in the presence or absence of various amounts of pRFX1. The Renilla-luciferase expression vector (pRL/cytomegalovirus, 0.1 μg/well) also was co-transfected as an internal control. The amount of control cytomegalovirus plasmid DNA in the transfection mixture was adjusted to maintain that the total amount of DNA used was at 1 μg/well. At 24 h after the transfection, luciferase and Renilla-luciferase activities in the cells were measured using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system as described before (13Ma K. Araki K. Ichwan S.J. Suganuma T. Tamamori-Adachi M. Ikeda M.A. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 438-444PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla-luciferase activity. Each experiment was performed in triplicate for each condition and was repeated at least three times. Gel Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared from C6 cells at 24 h after being transfected with or without pRFX1 using a nuclear extraction kit from Panomics, Inc. (Redwood City, CA). Equal amounts (6 μg)of extracts were incubated with biotin-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (the probe) in the presence or absence of unlabeled probe (cold probe), mutated cold probe, or an anti-RFX1 antibody (0.1 μl) in 15 μl of reaction mixture from the electrophoretic mobility shift assay gel-shift kits (Panomics, Inc., Redwood City, CA) for 30 min at 16 °C, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sense sequence of the probe and the cold probe is 5′-gggtggcggcggcaacggc-3′, which is the RFX1 binding sequence. The mutated cold probe is 5′-gggtgtcgggccgtagccgcc-3′ (the bases that are different from those in the RFX1 binding sequence are bolded). After the incubation, the products were separated in 6% native polyacrylamide gels. The binding of the probe to DNA or to DNA and protein complexes was visualized by the chemiluminescence method. Antibodies—The rabbit polyclonal anti-RFX1 antibody (SB269-4) was a gift from Dr. P. Hearing and was used at a 1:5000 dilution. The rabbit anti-EAAT2 (GLT11-A) and EAAT3 (EAAC11-A) polyclonal antibody were from Alpha Diagnostic International, Inc. (San Antonio, TX) and were used at a 1:1000 dilution. The rabbit polyclonal anti-β-actin (A-2066) was purchased from Sigma and was used at a 1:5000 dilution. Western Blotting—Equal amounts of whole cell extracts were separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). The blots were probed with the primary antibodies and then with the horseradish peroxide-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Protein bands were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). Glutamate Uptake Assay—C6 cells were transfected with pRFX1 (1.5 μg/well) in 12-well plates and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The glutamate uptake assay was performed as we described before (9Huang Y. Zuo Z. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1522-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). After being washed twice by wash buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl (replaced by 140 mm choline chloride in sodium depletion experiments), 5 mm Trisbase, 2.5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm K2HPO4, and 10 mm dextrose, PH 7.2, the cells were incubated with 10 μm l-[3H]glutamate in the wash buffer for 5 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by removing the incubation buffer and washing the cells three times with ice-cold wash buffer. The cells were lysed with 0.2 m NaOH (or KOH in sodium depletion experiments), and radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was prepared from NRK-52E or C6 cells using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Complementary DNAs were synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA using the SuperScript preamplification system (Invitrogen). Amplification by PCR involved a 94 °C, 4-min initial denaturation step followed by 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, at 55 °C for 30s, and at 72 °C for 45 s. The sequences of the paired primers were as follows: EAAT1, 5′-atgacaaaaagcaacggagaagag-3′ and 5′-aatcattgtcatcatcatccaccc-3′ (corresponding to positions 1-24 and 417-440 of EAAT1, respectively); EAAT2, 5′-cgaggtgtccagcctggatgccttcc-3′ and 5′-aagtggttgctaggcagc-3′ (corresponding to positions 578-603 and 1015-1033 of EAAT2, respectively); EAAT3, 5′-egggatccaatggggaagcccacgagctc-3′ and 5′-cactcagacctcgcagttctcccaaactt-3′ (corresponding to positions 1-20 and 1550-1570 of EAAT3, respectively). PCR products were resolved on 1% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide and UV transillumination. Immunohistochemistry—As we described before (14Zheng S. Zuo Z. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1172-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), after being perfused with 100 ml of normal saline, adult Sprague-Dawley male rats were perfused transcardially with 100 ml of phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde. Brains were removed and stored in the fixative for 2 days at 4 °C. Five-micrometer-thick coronal paraffin sections were cut for immunohistochemistry with the anti-RFX1 antibody. Immunoreactivity was visualized with an avidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase reaction with an ABC staining system from Vector Laboratories, Inc. (Burlingame, CA). Control incubations leaving out the primary or secondary antibodies were also performed. Statistical Analysis—The intensity of RFX1, EAAT2, and EAAT3 protein bands was normalized to that of β-actin to control for errors in protein sample loading and transferring during the Western analysis when total cell lysates were used for analysis. The results of Western blotting are presented as means ± S.D. of the -fold change over the controls, with control being set as 1. The results of luciferase activity assays are means ± S.D. of the ratios of luciferase activity/Renilla-luciferase activity in the same sample. The data of glutamate uptake assay are means ± S.D. of the measured values in each sample. Statistical analysis was performed by unpaired t test or one-way analysis of variance followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test for post hoc comparison as appropriate. A p < 0.05 was considered significant. C6 glioma cells have been shown to express only EAAT3 and have been frequently used in the studies of the regulation of EAAT3 activity and expression (9Huang Y. Zuo Z. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1522-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 15Davis K.E. Straff D.J. Weinstein E.A. Bannerman P.G. Correale D.M. Rothstein J.D. Robinson M.B. J.

In this study, we have detected EAAT3 mRNA and protein (Figs. 1 and 2) but not the mRNA (Fig. 1) and protein (data not shown) of EAAT1 and EAAT2. The transfection of C6 cells with pRFX1 induced a time-dependent increase of the RFX1 proteins and EAAT3 proteins (Fig. 2). This increase peaked at 24 h after the transfection for RFX1 proteins (2.2 ± 0.4-fold the control, n = 3, p < 0.05 as compared with control) and for EAAT3 proteins (1.6 ± 0.1-fold the control, n = 3, p < 0.05 as compared with control). Consistent with the increased expression of EAAT3 proteins, glutamate uptake by C6 cells also time-dependently increased (Fig. 3). Since these cells only express EAAT3, this increased glutamate uptake should be EAAT3-mediated.FIGURE 2Increased expression of EAAT3 proteins by RFX1. C6 cells were transfected with pRFX1. Cells were harvested at various times after the transfection. The total cell lysates were used for Western analysis. A representative Western blot is shown in the left panel. The graphic presentation of the RFX1, EAAT3, and β-actin protein abundance quantified by integrating the volume of autoradiograms from three separate experiments is shown in the right panel.

Sodium-free experiments were performed by using a sodium-free incubation solution (see “Experimental Procedures”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the increased EAAT3 expression and activity by RFX1 was due to the modification of EAAT3 promoter activity, we first investigated whether there was a RFX1 DNA binding complex in C6 cells. In the nuclear extracts from C6 cells, the intensity of a supershifted band was increased with the transfection of pRFX1. This supershifted band detected by the RFX1 probe was abolished by a 33-fold excess of cold probe but was not affected by a mutated cold probe with a 5-base change in the sequence. The band was further supershifted by the incubation of the nuclear extracts with an anti-RFX1 antibody (Fig. 4). These results suggest that there are complexes that can bind to RFX1 in the nuclear extracts of C6 cells. We then studied whether RFX1 proteins modified the EAAT3 promoter activity. When C6 cells were transfected with pRFX1, the expression of the reporter gene luciferase was increased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5). These results suggest that the activity of EAAT3 promoter is increased by RFX1 proteins. Since a previous study showed that RFX1 and RFX3 decreased the promoter activity of microtubule-associated protein 1A gene in non-neuronal cells but not in neuron-like cells (17Nakayama A. Murakami H. Maeyama N. Yamashiro N. Sakakibara A. Mori N. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 233-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we repeated our experiments in SH-SY5Y cells, a well established neuron-like cell line. The transfection of these cells with pRFX1 also induced a dose-dependent increase of luciferase expression (Fig. 5).FIGURE 5Increased luciferase activity by RFX1 in the C6 cells (A) and SH-SY5Y cells (B). Cells were cotransfected with the EAAT3-luc plasmids and pRFX1. They were harvested for luciferase activity assay at 24 h after the transfection with various doses of pRFX1. Results are means ± S.D. (n = 3). *, p < 0.05 as compared with the corresponding control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then determined whether the effects of RFX1 on EAAT3 expression were specific. NRK-52E cells express endogenous EAAT2 mRNA (Fig. 1) and proteins (Fig. 6). When these cells were transfected with pRFX1, the expression of RFX1 proteins was time-dependently increased (2.2 ± 0.2-fold the control at 24 h after the transfection, n = 3, p < 0.05 as compared with control). However, there was no change in EAAT2 protein expression (Fig. 6). EAAT3 is a neuronal EAAT in the mammalian brains. However, the expression of RFX1 in the mammalian brains has not been determined yet. We showed by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry that rat cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum expressed RFX1 proteins (Fig. 7). The cerebral cortical neurons and Purkinje cells expressed abundant RFX1 proteins that were distributed in both cytosol and nuclei (Fig. 7B). We then determined whether RFX1 affected the expression of endogenous EAAT3 in neurons. As shown in Fig. 8, the expression of EAAT3 in the rat cortical neurons in culture was significantly decreased when RFX1 expression was down-regulated by the RFX1 antisense oligonucleotides. The RFX1 sense oligonucleotides did not significantly change the expression of RFX1 or EAAT3. These results suggest that RFX1 plays a role in maintaining the basal expression of endogenous EAAT3 in the neurons.FIGURE 8Decreased expression of EAAT3 after RFX1 down-regulation. Rat cortical neurons in culture were treated with 5 μm RFX1 antisense or sense oligonucleotides for 96 h. They were then harvested, and the total cell lysates were used for Western analysis. A representative Western blot is shown in the left panel. The graphic presentation of the RFX1, EAAT3, and β-actin protein abundance quantified by integrating the volume of autoradiograms from three separate experiments is shown in the right panel.

Pan J. Zhang P. Reith W. Mach B. Tenen D.G. Sun Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3940-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Liu M. Lee B.H. Mathews M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15433-15439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Mutations in the DNA binding domain of RFX5 cause bare lymphocyte syndrome or major histocompatibility complex antigen class II deficiency (8Swoboda P. Adler H.T. Thomas J.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 411-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). RFX1, the prototypic mammalian RFX, has been shown to act as a potent transactivator of enhancer I for the hepatitis B virus major surface antigen gene in cells that are of liver origin (20Siegrist C.A. Durand B. Emery P. David E. Hearing P. Mach B. Reith W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6375-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the physiological significance of RFX1-3 in the mammalian cells is not yet clear. It has been shown that X-box sequences for RFX1, RFX2, and RFX3 are very similar to that for DAF-19 and are different from those for RFX4 and RFX5 (8Swoboda P. Adler H.T. Thomas J.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 411-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 21Emery P. Strubin M. Hofmann K. Bucher P. Mach B. Reith W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4486-4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). DAF-19 is the RFX homologue in C. elegans, and knockout of the daf-19 gene results in severe sensory defects (8Swoboda P. Adler H.T. Thomas J.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 411-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Thus, RFX1-3 may play a role in the mammalian central nervous system. However, up until now, there is no report documenting the effects of these RFXs on gene expression in cells of central nervous system origin. Based on the results generated from cell lines of different origins, it was concluded that RFX1 and RFX3 inhibited the expression of microtubule-associated protein 1A in cells of non-central nervous system origin, such as HeLa cells, but not in cells of central nervous system origin, such as TGW and Neruo2A cells (17Nakayama A. Murakami H. Maeyama N. Yamashiro N. Sakakibara A. Mori N. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 233-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We showed that RFX1 enhanced the activity of EAAT3 promoter in C6 and SH-SY5Y cells and the expression of EAAT3 proteins in C6 cells. C6 and SH-SY5Y cells are of central nervous system origin, and SH-SY5Y cells are neuron-like cells. Moreover, neurons in rat brain expressed RFX1 proteins, and knockdown of RFX1 proteins decreased EAAT3 expression in the rat cortical neurons in culture. Thus, our results provide initial evidence that RFX1 regulates gene expression in the nervous cells. The determination of the expression of a gene in a cell is multifactorial. The interaction between transcription factors and the promoter of the gene contributes to the process. In analyzing the promoter regions of human EAAT1, EAAT2, and EAAT3 genes, we found that the promoter region of EAAT3 but not the promoter regions of EAAT1 or EAAT2 contained a binding sequence for RFX1. Consistent with this finding, our results showed that RFX1 enhanced the expression of EAAT3 but not EAAT2. These results suggest that the effects of RFX1 on EAAT3 are specific. EAAT3 is mainly neuronally expressed in vivo (1Danbolt N.C. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 1-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3798) Google Scholar). We showed that neurons of rat brain expressed RFX1 proteins. In addition, knockdown of RFX1 by the RFX1 antisense oligonucleotides also reduced the expression of EAAT3 in rat neurons in culture. These results suggest an important role of RFX1 in regulating the expression of EAAT3 in neurons. These results may also help us understand why EAAT subtypes are expressed in a cell-type specific manner. RFX1 enhanced EAAT3 expression. This effect may be mediated by the interaction between RFX1 proteins and the EAAT3 promoter. RFX1 is a transcription factor. There were RFX1 binding complexes in the nuclear extracts of C6 cells. The EAAT3 promoter activity was increased by RFX1. Thus, the X-box in the EAAT3 gene is a positively acting regulatory element for the expression of this gene. Positively acting regulatory elements of the X-box after binding to RFXs have been shown in most of the viral promoters and in the promoter of interleukin-5 receptor α chain (18Iwama A. Pan J. Zhang P. Reith W. Mach B. Tenen D.G. Sun Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3940-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Siegrist C.A. Durand B. Emery P. David E. Hearing P. Mach B. Reith W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6375-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, negatively acting regulatory elements of the X-box after binding to RFXs have been shown in the promoters for genes, such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen and microtubule-associated protein 1A (17Nakayama A. Murakami H. Maeyama N. Yamashiro N. Sakakibara A. Mori N. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 233-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 19Liu M. Lee B.H. Mathews M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15433-15439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, the functional change of a promoter by RFXs is context-dependent. The mechanisms for this phenomenon are not clear. Various interactions among different functional domains in the RFX proteins and other regulatory factors recruited during the process may contribute to the development of this phenomenon. Our findings may have significant physiological implications. EAATs, through their functions of uptaking glutamate under physiological conditions, maintain extracellular glutamate homeostasis (1Danbolt N.C. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 1-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3798) Google Scholar). Inhibition of EAAT activity in brain slices or cell cultures increased the peak glutamate concentration in the synaptic cleft and prolonged the glutamate-induced current, leading to a slowed excitatory postsynaptic current decay at some synapses (3Barbour B. Keller B.U. Llano I. Marty A. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1331-1343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 4Diamond J.S. Jahr C.E. J.

In a recent study, inhibition of neuronal EAATs, i.e. EAAT3, in hippocampal slices decreased the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic current and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current due to a reduction of GABA synthesis because glutamate uptaken by neuronal EAATs is a substrate for GABA synthesis (22Matthews G. Diamond J.S. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2040-2048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the data from an early study showing that antisense knockdown of EAAT3 induced epilepsy in rats and that the hippocampal slices from these rats had a decrease in GABA synthesis, total GABA levels, and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current (23Sepkuty J.P. Cohen A.S. Eccles C. Rafiq A. Behar K. Ganel R. Coulter D.A. Rothstein J.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6372-6379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, EAAT3 plays a role in maintaining the balance of glutamate/GABA neurotransmission. Consequently, factors, such as RFX1, which can regulate EAAT3 expression and activity, may have important physiological functions. We thank Dr. Yueming Huang for helping with the glutamate uptake assay and Jacqueline M. Washington for general help. We also thank Dr. Patrick Hearing (State University of New York at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY) for kindly providing the RFX1 plasmid and the anti-RFX1 antibody."
https://openalex.org/W2057717947,"Tumor cells are often characterized by a high and growth factor-independent proliferation rate. We have previously shown that REF cells transformed with oncogenes E1A and c-Ha-Ras do not undergo G1/S arrest of the cell cycle after treatment with genotoxic factors. In this work, we used sodium butyrate, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, to show that E1A + Ras transformants were able to stop proliferation and undergo G1/S arrest. Apart from inducing G1/S arrest, sodium butyrate was shown to change expression of a number of cell cycle regulatory genes. It down-regulated cyclins D1, E, and A as well as c-myc and cdc25A and up-regulated the cyclin-kinase inhibitor p21waf1. Accordingly, activities of cyclin E-Cdk2 and cyclin A-Cdk2 complexes in sodium butyrate-treated cells were decreased substantially. Strikingly, E2F1 expression was also down-modulated at the levels of gene transcription, the protein content, and the E2F transactivating capability. To further study the role of p21waf1 in the sodium butyrate-induced G1/S arrest and the E2F1 down-modulation, we established E1A + Ras transformants from mouse embryo fibroblast cells with deletion of the cdkn1a (p21waf1) gene. Despite the absence of p21waf1, sodium butyrate-treated mERas transformants reveal a slightly delayed G1/S arrest as well as down-modulation of E2F1 activity, implying that the observed effects are mediated through an alternative p21waf1-independent signaling pathway. Subsequent analysis showed that sodium butyrate induced accumulation of β-catenin, a downstream component of the Wnt signaling. The results obtained indicate that the antiproliferative effect of histone deacetylase inhibitors on E1A + Ras-transformed cells can be mediated, alongside other mechanisms, through down-regulation of E2F activity and stabilization of β-catenin.

Chromatin structure and eventually gene transcription are regulated at the level of histone acetylation and histone deacetylation (1Iyer N.G. Ozdag H. Caldas C. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4225-4231Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 2Johnstone R.W. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar, 3Marks P. Richon V.

Higher levels of histone acetylation have been associated with transcriptional activation; correspondingly, an inactive chromatin structure correlates with histone deacetylation mediated by histone deacetylases (HDACs). 3The abbreviations used are: HDAC, histone deacetylase; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; REF, rat embryo fibroblast; RT, reverse transcription; APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; BIO, 6-bromoindirubin-3′-oxime; NaB, sodium butyrate; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Both of these processes, acetylation and deacetylation of histones, are involved in control of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Deregulation of these pathways can trigger development of human diseases (e.g. p300 histone acetylase gene alteration is linked with development of tumors such as colorectal and gastric carcinomas) (1Iyer N.G. Ozdag H. Caldas C. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4225-4231Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 5Muraoka M. Konishi M. Kikuchi-Yanoshita R. Tanaka K. Shitara N. Chong J.M. Iwama T. Miyaki M. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1565-1569PubMed Google Scholar). Increasing evidence has been reported that HDAC inhibitors are able to suppress cell proliferation and to induce G1/S and/or G2/M block of the cell cycle in various tumor cells (2Johnstone R.W. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar, 3Marks P. Richon V. Rifkind R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1210-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar, 6Piekarz R. Bates S. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2004; 10: 2289-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 7Weidle U.H. Grossmann A. Anticancer Res. 2000; 20: 1471-1485PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been reported that HDAC inhibitors can cause apoptotic cell death in a number of tumor cells (3Marks P. Richon V. Rifkind R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1210-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar, 8Peart M.J. Tainton K.M. Ruefli A.A. Dear A.E. Sedelies K.A. O'Reilly L.A. Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851PubMed Google Scholar, 9Waterhouse N.J. Trapani J.A. Johnstone R.W. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4460-4471PubMed Google Scholar). Due to their marked antiproliferation effect, inhibitors of HDAC activity are currently being tested in cancer therapeutics clinical trials (2Johnstone R.W. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar, 6Piekarz R. Bates S. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2004; 10: 2289-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In the majority of tumor cells, there are various dysfunctions of negative regulators of the cell cycle (p21waf1 or p27kip1 cyclin-Cdk inhibitor and tumor suppressor p53 and/or pRb) or elevated expression of positive regulators (cyclin D, Cdks, c-Myc), allowing the cells to avoid arrest at the G1/S or G2/M check-points by various DNA-damaging and stress factors. The fact that HDAC inhibitors are able to stop proliferation of different transformed cells indicates that they can also utilize noncanonical p53/Waf1-independent pathways for inducing the cell cycle arrest. The mechanisms by which HDAC inhibitors stop proliferation of tumor cells are far from clear. Gene expression profiling data indicate that not more than 2% of all genes change their transcription in HDAC inhibitor-treated cells, with most of these controlling cell cycle progression (10Van Lint C. Emiliani S. Verdin E. Gene Expr. 1996; 5: 245-253PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, to study the antiproliferative effect of HDAC inhibitor sodium butyrate, we used primary embryonic fibroblast (REF and MEF) cells transformed with E1A and c-Ha-Ras oncogenes. It has been earlier shown that rat embryonic fibroblast cells transformed by E1A + Ras oncogenes do not undergo G1/S or G2/M arrest after serum deprivation as well as after genotoxic stresses (11Bulavin D.V. Tararova N.D. Aksenov N.D. Pospelov V.A. Pospelova T.V. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5611-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We used flow cytometry analysis to study parameters of the cell cycle and a clonogenic assay to estimate reversibility of cell growth inhibition of E1A + Ras cells exposed to sodium butyrate. RT-PCR and Western blot techniques were used to analyze the expression levels of positive (cyclins D1, E, and A and Cdk2/Cdk4 kinases) and negative (p21waf1 and p27kip1 cyclin-kinase inhibitors) regulators of the cell cycle. We also checked whether sodium butyrate might modulate E2F gene expression, a downstream target of the p21/Waf1 pathway, by monitoring e2f1 gene transcripts, E2F-1 protein content, and E2F-luc transcriptional activity in a transient transfection assay. Since the obtained data showed a putative role of p21waf1 in the sodium butyrate-induced G1/S arrest, we compared the effect of sodium butyrate on mouse E1A + Rasestablished transformants with genotypes p21waf1+/+ and p21waf1-/- (mERas p21waf1+/+ and mERas p21waf1-/-, respectively). In fact, the lack of p21waf1 did not eliminate the sodium butyrate-induced suppression of cell growth and G1 arrest in the mERas p21waf1-/- cells. Moreover, E2F-luciferase activity was inhibited to a similar level by sodium butyrate in p21waf1+/+ and p21waf1-/- transformants. Importantly, sodium butyrate induced accumulation of nonphosphorylated β-catenin in the mERas p21waf1+/+ cells, implying direct or indirect effects of sodium butyrate on the Wnt-signaling pathway. All of this indicates that the growth-suppressive effect of HDAC inhibitors on certain types of transformed cells can be mediated, among other mechanisms, through down-regulation of E2F activity and stabilizaion of β-catenin. Cell Culture and Transfection—Rat embryonic fibroblasts (REFs) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were explanted from rat and mouse embryos. p21waf1-/- mice were a kind gift of Dr. Chuxia Deng. The REF E1A + Ras cells were established by calcium phosphate transfection of E1A Ad5 and activated c-Ha-Ras oncogenes as described earlier (12Pospelova T.V. Medvedev A.V. Kukushkin A.N. Svetlikova S.B. van der Eb A.J. Dorsman J.C. Pospelov V.A. Gene Expr. 1999; 8: 19-32PubMed Google Scholar). MEF cells with normal and deleted p21waf1 were similarly transformed with E1A and Ras oncogenes as overgrowth foci on fibroblast monolayers. The transformed cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and gentamycin. The cells were seeded to 30-40% confluence in 24-well plates 24 h prior to transfection. Then the medium was changed on Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). The cells were transiently transfected using a ratio of 1 μl of Lipofectamine-2000 (Invitrogen) per 0.5 μg of plasmid DNA in Opti-MEM as recommended by the manufacturer. The transfection mixture contained 1 μg of E2F-luciferase reporter or another plasmid and 100 ng of Renilla DNA as an internal control for transfection efficiency. In cotransfection experiments, 1 μg of E2F-luc reporter was co-transfected with 1 μg of expression vectors: E2F1, β-catenin, or Tcf-4. 24 h after transfection, cell extracts were prepared, and luciferase activity was determined following a protocol supplied with the dual luciferase kit (Promega). Each point was done in triplicate, and each experiment was performed not less than three times. Sodium butyrate (Sigma) was added 4-5 h after transfection at a concentration of 4 mm for 24 h. Plasmids—The E2F1 human promoter (-242 bp)-luciferase construct and its mutants into either of two putative E2F recognition sites were kindly provided by Dr. Ikeda. Plasmids were kindly donated by Dr. K. W. Kinzler and Dr. Bert Vogelstein (β-catenin and Tcf-4 expression vectors), Dr. W. G. Kaelin, Jr. (CMV-E2F1 expression vector), Dr. H. E. Ruley (E1A Ad5 expression vector), Dr. V. S. Prassolov (c-Ha-Ras gene construct with two mutations (at 12- and 61-positions)), Dr. W. El-Deiry (waf-luc construct), and Dr. A. Shwarts (6×E2F-responsive site luciferase construct). RT-PCR—The total cellular RNA was isolated by a guanidine isothiocyanate procedure as described in Ref. 13Abramova M.V. Kukushkin A.N. Svetlikova S.B. Pospelov V.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 306: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar. The RT step was performed with 3 μg of RNA and 1 μg of random hexaprimers (Roche Applied Science). The amount of total RNA for RT reactions was normalized by densitometry of 18 S ribosomal RNA after electrophoresis in denaturing agarose gel. The PCR step was performed in the presence of 100 ng of primers to the cDNA of rat genes: cyclin D1, 5′-TGTTCGTGGCCTCTAAGATG-3′/5′-TCTGGAAAGAAAGTGCGTTG-3′ (386 bp); cyclin E, 5′-ACCCTCCAAAGTTGCACCAG-3′/5′-CCATCTCCCGGATAACCATG-3′ (408 bp); c-myc, 5′-CCCAAATCCTGTACCTCG 3′/5′-TCTTGGCAGCTGGATAGTC-3′ (355 bp); cdc25A, 5′-GACTGCCGATACCCATATG-3′/5′-CAGGACATACAGCTCAGGG-3′ (249 bp); p21waf1, 5′-GCCGTGATTGCGATGCGCTCA-3′/5′-ACAGCGACAAGGCCACGTGGT-3′ (250 bp); p27kip1, 5′-ACTTGGAGAAGCACTGCC-3′/5′-TTCCTCATCCCTGGACAC-3′ (328 bp); e2f1, 5′-TGGTAGCAGTGGGCCATTCC-3′/5′-GCCGTTTCTGCACCTTCAGC-3′ (191 bp). PCRs proceeded in 25 cycles: a denaturation step at 95 °C for 1 min, an annealing step (56.5 °C for cyclin D1, c-myc, p27kip1; 56 °C for cyclin E and e2f1; 54°C for cdc25A; 65 °C for p21waf1) for 1 min), and an elongation step at 72 °C for 2 min. PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel. The rat GAPDH gene was selected as an internal control in a PCR assay with primers to the GAPDH cDNA (5′-TGTGATGGGTGTGAACCACG-3′/5′-CCAGTGAGCTTCCCGTTCAG-3′) giving a 297-bp DNA fragment. DNA Fragmentation Assay—The cells were treated with or without 4 mm sodium butyrate (NaB) for 24 h and harvested. Washed cell pellets were resuspended in cell lysis buffer (0.25 m EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.25% Sarkosyl). Then proteinase K (0.1 mg/ml) was added, and incubation was continued for3hat50 °C. After DNA deproteination, RNase A (0.5 mg/ml) was added and incubated in the presence of 150 mm NaCl for 3 h at 37 °C. DNA fragments were run on 1.5% agarose gel (3 μg/lane). Gels were stained with ethidium bromide and visualized by a UV transilluminator. Colony Formation Assay—E1A + Ras cells were treated with 4 mm NaB. Cells were trypsinized 48 and 144 h after the treatment and were equally reseeded at 200 cells/30-mm plate. After 10-14 days, the cells were fixed in 100% methanol (30 min at room temperature) and stained for 1 h with 0.1% crystal violet (Sigma). The stained colonies were counted and compared with an untreated control. Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells were washed and permeabilized for 30 min with 0.01% saponin. Then the cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 40 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1 mg/ml RNase A for 15 min at 37 °C prior to analysis using an ATC300 cytometer (Brucker). Cell Extracts, Immunoblots, and Immunoprecipitations—For immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors (leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin) (10 μg/ml). Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of 0.1% SDS, transferred onto membrane (Immobilon P), and probed with respective antibodies. Broad molecular mass colored markers were used as molecular weight standards (BioLabs). Immunoprecipitation was carried out as described (9Waterhouse N.J. Trapani J.A. Johnstone R.W. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4460-4471PubMed Google Scholar), and the complexes were collected by Protein A-Sepharose beads. As primary antibodies, we used antibodies to E1A (M73), Cdk2 (H-298), Cdk4 (C-22), cyclin A (H-432), cyclin E (C-19), p16 (M-156), p19 (M-167), p21waf1 (F-5), p27kip1 (C-19), Rb (C-15), E2F1 (KH95) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), panRas (Sigma), and phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of β-catenin and protein kinase B/Akt1 (Cell Signaling). As for the secondary antibodies, anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were used (Sigma). Visualization of membrane-bound proteins was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Nuclear Extracts and Gel Retardation (Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay)—Nuclear extracts were used in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay as described in Ref. 14Pospelov V.A. Pospelova T.V. Julien J.P. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 187-196PubMed Google Scholar. Reaction mixture for DNA binding included 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 15% glycerol, 2 mm spermidine, and 5 μg of nuclear extracts. The mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 20 min, and then labeled oligonucleotide was added (30,000 cpm/ng) and incubation was continued for an additional 20 min. The E2F binding site from the c-myc promoter was used as probe for retardation (italic): 5′-GATCCTTGGCGGGAAAAAGAAG-3′. Specific and nonspecific oligonucleotides were added in competition experiments at a 100-fold molar excess over the labeled probe. DNA-protein complexes were separated by electrophoresis on 4% polyacrylamide gel (30:1) using Tris borate buffer, pH 8.3, as an electrode buffer. Oligonucleotides were labeled by polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were seeded on coverslips, washed in 2× phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in fresh 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 20 min. Cells were rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and blocked by incubation with 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline. Incubation with primary antibody, washing, and incubation with secondary Cy-conjugated antibody (Amersham Biosciences) followed this. In Vitro Kinase Assay—An in vitro kinase assay was carried out as follows. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated for 2 h with respective antibodies followed by incubation with Protein G-Sepharose/Protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h. After washing with lysing buffer (two times), the probes were washed with a kinase buffer: 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2. Kinase reaction was performed in 50-μl aliquots containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm cold ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 1 μg of histone H1 (Roche Applied Science). The reaction tubes were incubated for1hat30 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 3× sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. The proteins were separated in 12.5% polyacrylamide gel, dried, and exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Cell Lines—REF and MEF (p21waf1+/+ and p21waf1-/-) cells were transfected with the E1A early region of Ad5 and activated c-Ha-Ras oncogenes by means of calcium phosphate DNA precipitation (12Pospelova T.V. Medvedev A.V. Kukushkin A.N. Svetlikova S.B. van der Eb A.J. Dorsman J.C. Pospelov V.A. Gene Expr. 1999; 8: 19-32PubMed Google Scholar). Foci of morphological transformation were picked 12-14 days after transfection and were expanded by growing in 30-mm plastic dishes. A number of foci were characterized for the expression of exogenous E1A and Ras genes by immunoblot procedure. The foci revealing high levels of oncogene expression were chosen for the subsequent analysis. HDAC Inhibitor Sodium Butyrate Suppresses Proliferation by Inducing G1 Arrest and Inhibits Cloning Efficiency of E1A + Ras-transformed REF Cells—Data presented in Figs. 1 and 2 show that sodium butyrate inhibits cell growth of E1A + Rastransformed REF cells as well as induces accumulation of G1 phase cells and a decrease of S phase cells upon treatment for 24 h. Importantly, after such relatively short term treatment with sodium butyrate, E1A + Ras cells undergo a reversible growth arrest as washed cells resume proliferation. The growth-suppressive effect of sodium butyrate reached the maximum after 72-96 h of treatment (Fig. 2A); at these time points, the G1/S block became irreversible. A prolonged treatment with sodium butyrate for 6 days led to complete suppression of transformants to form colonies (Fig. 2B). These growth-suppressive effects do not seem to be caused by induction of apoptotic cell death in the presence of sodium butyrate as revealed by the lack of any features characteristic of apoptosis according to the 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining, the lack of DNA fragmentation, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage (Fig. 2, C-E).FIGURE 2Sodium butyrate is able to stop proliferation and to inhibit colony formation of E1A + Ras-transformed cells. A, growth curves of E1A + Ras cells in the absence and in the presence of sodium butyrate for 24-72 h. 1, control; 2, sodium butyrate (4 mm). B, colony formation assay. Cells were seeded at 200 cells per 30-mm plate and left untreated or treated with sodium butyrate (4 mm). The number of colonies was counted after growing the cells for 2 and 6 days. C, E1A + Ras cells stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for visualization of apoptosis. Cells were left untreated (C) or treated with 6 mm NaB for 16 h. Then the cells were fixed and stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to show nuclear structure. D, sodium butyrate does not cause DNA fragmentation in E1A + Ras cells. DNA fragments were isolated from control and NaB-treated cells and then were subjected to an agarose gel electrophoresis. E, Western blot analysis of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage in sodium butyrate-treated cells (NaB).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Sodium Butyrate Up-regulates p21waf1 Gene Transcription and Causes Accumulation of p21waf1 Cyclin Kinase Inhibitor in Nuclei of the E1A + Ras-transformed Cells— What are the mechanisms of the growth-suppressive effect of sodium butyrate on E1A + Ras-transformed cells, considering that the same cells are unable to undergo cell cycle arrest after treatment with various DNA damaging and stress factors? Most cancer cells are well known to be characterized by down-regulation of a number of tumor suppressors; therefore, we checked the expression of p21waf1 and p27kip1 cyclin-kinase inhibitors in sodium butyrate-treated E1A + Ras cells (Fig. 3). The most evident effect was an increase of p21waf1 gene transcription and accumulation of p21waf1 protein that is a specific inhibitor of cyclin-kinase activity (Fig. 3, A and B). Sodium butyrate was also found to activate p21waf1 promoter-driven luciferase activity as revealed by a transient transfection analysis of the waf-luc reporter (Fig. 3C). As expected, the accumulated p21waf1 protein was found to be located in nuclei of the sodium butyrate-treated cells (Fig. 3D). The p21waf1 accumulation is due to new synthesis and probably a decrease of its degradation. This notion is supported by recent data indicating that reduced proteasome activity following HDAC inhibition may be in part due to reduced proteasome subunit expression (15Place R.F. Noonan E.J. Giardina C. BMC Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Another cyclin-kinase inhibitor, p27kip1, was found to decrease both at the level of p27 transcripts and the protein content in contrast to p16ink4a tumor-suppressor protein that was markedly increased (Fig. 3, A and B). Nevertheless, control experiments carried out with p16ink4a-null mERas transformants (p16ink4a-/- E1A + Ras) showed that these cells are able to undergo the G1/S cell cycle arrest after 24-h treatment with 4 mm sodium butyrate (see supplemental data). Whereas sodium butyrate activates expression of negative cell cycle regulators, such as p21waf1, RT-PCR data show the HDAC inhibitor to suppress transcription of cell cycle positive regulators, in particular of genes coding for cyclin D1 and cyclin E as well as cdc25A phosphatase and c-myc (Fig. 4A). This, in turn, leads to a decrease the content of cyclins D1, E, and A and Cdk4 but not c-Myc (Fig. 4B). It can be concluded that the HDAC inhibitor sodium butyrate demonstrates multiple effects on cell proliferation by interfering with the transcription of genes that are positive regulators of the cell cycle and by activating transcription of such negative cell cycle regulators as p21waf1. During the G1 cell cycle phase, cyclin E-Cdk2 and cyclin A-Cdk2 complexes are well known to phosphorylate and thereby to inactivate tumor suppressor pRb protein that is active in early and middle G1 phase in relation to binding free E2Fs. Accordingly, these events are necessary to release the E2F transcription factor from its complexes with pRb (16Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). A high level of the free E2F activity has been found to be a hallmark of a variety of transformed cells (17Iwamoto M. Banerjee D. Menon L.G. Jurkiewicz A. Rao P.H. Kemeny N.E. Fong Y. Jhanvar S.C. Gorlick R. Bertino J.R. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2004; 3: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 18Onda M. Nagai H. Yoshida A.

Since the HDAC inhibitor sodium butyrate activated expression of p21waf1, this might lead to an association of the accumulated p21waf1 with cyclin-Cdks and to a decrease of the cyclin-kinase complex activity. This is confirmed by our finding that in sodium butyrate-treated E1A + Ras cells, p21waf1 is additionally associated with cyclin E and Cdk2 kinase as determined by immunoprecipitation data (Fig. 5A). Accordingly, the additional association of p21waf1 with cyclin-kinase complexes in sodium butyrate-treated cells is accompanied by a decrease of the cyclin E-Cdk2 and cyclin A-Cdk2 activities as demonstrated by an in vitro kinase assay with histone H1 as substrate (Fig. 5B). Sodium Butyrate Down-regulates e2f1 Gene Transcription and Transactivating Potential of E2F Factor in E1A + Ras Cells—Since accumulation of p21waf1 correlates with a decrease of cyclin-kinase complex activity (Fig. 5B), we can expect suppression of the overall E2F activity. First, we performed RT-PCR analysis of the e2f1 gene transcripts and IP/Western blot for E2F1 protein level in E1A + Ras cells treated with sodium butyrate (Fig. 6). The RT-PCR data clearly show that sodium butyrate decreases the amount of e2f1 gene transcripts, whereas Western blot data demonstrate a decrease of the E2F1 content at the protein level Fig. 6, A and B). Accordingly, a transient transfection assay performed with the E2F-luc reporter driven by several copies of an E2F-responsive element showed a significant inhibition of E2F activity in cells exposed to sodium butyrate (Fig. 6C). Using a gel retardation assay (electrophoretic mobility shift assay), we showed that sodium butyrate-treated cells, in fact, revealed lower DNA binding activity of E2F transcription factor (Fig. 6D, compare an intensity of specific bands A and B in lanes 1 and 2). The collected data indicate that the cyclin-kinase inhibitor p21waf1 might play a certain role in generation of the G1/S arrest induced by sodium butyrate in the E1A + Ras-transformed cells. Contribution of p21waf1 to the Effects Produced by Sodium Butyrate: A Comparison of p21waf1+/+ mERas and p21waf1-/- mERas Transformants—There are published data showing that knock-out on the p21waf1 gene does not abolish the G1 arrest induced by sodium butyrate in nontransformed MEF cells (19Vaziri C. Stice L. Faller D.V. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 465-474PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting Waf1-independent mechanisms for the G1 arrest. Therefore, in this part of the work, we were to determine whether the effects produced by sodium butyrate in E1A + Ras cells are solely dependent on the presence of the p21waf1 inhibitor. For this purpose, we established the E1A + c-Ha-Ras-expressing transformants from MEF cells with genotype p21waf1+/+ and p21waf1-/- by calcium phosphate transfection as described for E1A + Ras-transformed REF cells (see “Materials and Methods”). Not less than 10 foci of each transformed cell line were expanded and were further characterized for the expression of the exogenous E1A and Ras oncogenes (Fig. 7A). The selected cell lines (mERas p21waf1+/+ and mERas p21waf1-/-) were treated with sodium butyrate at a concentration of 4 mm and were analyzed by a flow cytometry for the ratio of cells in G1, S, and G2 phases of the cell cycle. The p21waf1-expressing mouse embryonic fibroblasts transformed by the oncogenes E1A and c-Ha-Ras (mERas p21waf1+/+) are very similar in morphology with E1A + Ras REF transformants studied above. The mERas p21waf1+/+ cells were found to undergo G1/S arrest after treatment with 4 mm sodium butyrate for 24 h (Fig. 7B) like that found for the E1A + Ras REF cells. Similarly, sodium butyrate inhibited proliferation of mERas p21waf1+/+ cells (Fig. 7D) and also suppressed their clonogenic viability (data not shown). Strikingly, Waf1-lacking mERas p21waf1-/- cells revealed similar cell growth suppression in the presence of 4 mm sodium butyrate as mERas p21waf1+/+ cells did (Fig. 7, compare D and E). Nevertheless, cytometric analysis of the cell cycle showed slightly delayed G1 arrest and a gradual decrease of S phase cells (Fig. 7C). Whereas the mERas p21waf1+/+ cells demonstrate a clear change of the cell cycle parameters after treatment with sodium butyrate for 24 h, the mERas p21waf1-/- cells undergo a similar G1/S arrest after 48-72 h of incubation with sodium butyrate (Fig. 7C)."

Under O2-limiting conditions, FNR binds a [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster through four cysteine residues (Cys20, Cys23, Cys29, Cys122). The acquisition of the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster converts FNR into the transcriptionally active dimeric form. Upon exposure to O2, the cluster converts to a [2Fe-2S]2+ form, generating FNR monomers that no longer bind DNA with high affinity. The mechanism of the cluster conversion reaction and the nature of the released iron and sulfur are of considerable current interest. Here, we report the application of a novel in vitro method, involving 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), for determining the oxidation state of the sulfur atoms released during FNR cluster conversion following the addition of O2. Conversion of [4Fe-4S]2+ to [2Fe-2S]2+ clusters by O2 for both native and reconstituted FNR results in the release of ∼2 sulfide ions per [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster. This demonstrates that the reaction between O2 and the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster does not require sulfide oxidation and hence must entail iron oxidation.

Escherichia coli is a facultative anaerobe that adopts different metabolic modes in a hierarchal manner in response to the availability of oxygen (1Guest J.R. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1995; 350: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 2Spiro S. Guest J.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 310-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 3Unden G. Bongaerts J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1320: 217-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). This hierarchy reflects the amount of energy that can be harnessed in each metabolic mode and is maintained by transcriptional regulators that monitor either environmental oxygen or the cellular redox state (4Perrenoud A. Sauer U. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3171-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Aerobic respiration, a process that utilizes molecular oxygen (O2) as the terminal electron acceptor, is preferred over anaerobic respiration, which utilizes alternative electron acceptors such as nitrate because of the enormous energetic benefits conferred by aerobic respiration (3Unden G. Bongaerts J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1320: 217-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Likewise, anaerobic respiration is preferred over fermentation for similar reasons (3Unden G. Bongaerts J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1320: 217-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). The global transcriptional regulator FNR (designated due to defects in the utilization of fumarate or nitrate during anaerobic growth in corresponding fnr mutants (5Lambden P.R. Guest J.R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1976; 97: 145-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar)) activates the expression of genes that encode components of alternative electron transport chains essential for anaerobic respiration (6Kang Y.S. Weber K.D. Yu Q. Kiley P.J. Blattner F.R. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1135-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 7Unden G. Trageser M. Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek. 1991; 59: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Under anaerobic growth conditions, FNR also represses the expression of some genes associated with aerobic respiration (6Kang Y.S. Weber K.D. Yu Q. Kiley P.J. Blattner F.R. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1135-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 8Shalel-Levanon S. San K.Y. Bennett G.N. Metab.

FNR shares sequence homology with the cyclic-AMP receptor protein (CRP) 3The abbreviations used are: CRP, cyclic-AMP receptor protein; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid); Ferene, 5,5′(3-(2-pyridyl)-1,2,4-triazine-5,6-diyl)-bis-2-furansulfonate; TNB, 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate. (10Shaw D.J. Rice D.W. Guest J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and, like CRP, consists of two distinct domains that provide DNA binding and sensory functions (11Green J. Scott C. Guest J.R. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2001; 44: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The C-terminal DNA-binding domain recognizes specific FNR binding sequences within FNR-controlled promoters. The N-terminal sensory domain contains five cysteine residues, four of which (Cys20, Cys23, Cys29, Cys122) are essential (12Green J. Sharrocks A.D. Green B. Geisow M. Guest J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and assumed to be capable of binding either a [4Fe-4S]2+ or a [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster (13Khoroshilova N. Popescu C. Munck E. Beinert H. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6087-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 14Kiley P.J. Beinert H. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 22: 341-352Crossref Google Scholar). A variety of studies have shown that FNR is specifically activated under anaerobic conditions by the acquisition of one [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster per monomer (15Green J. Bennett B. Jordan P. Ralph E.T. Thomson A.J. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 887-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 16Khoroshilova N. Beinert H. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 9278-9286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This promotes dimerization and enhances site specific DNA-binding to target promoters (18Sharrocks A.D. Green J. Guest J.R. Proc. Biol. Sci. 1991; 245: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 19Lazazzera B.A. Bates D.M. Kiley P.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1993-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Exposure of the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster to oxygen or air causes it to undergo a conversion into a [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster, both in vivo and in vitro, resulting in the loss of site specific DNA binding (13Khoroshilova N.

Recently we reported that the [4Fe-4S]2+ to [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster conversion proceeds through a [3Fe-4S]+ intermediate, leading to production of hydrogen peroxide presumably by a two electron reduction of oxygen and the release of two iron ions (17Crack J. Green J. Thomson A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9278-9286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The oxidation states of the released iron atoms have yet to be unequivocally established. An alternative [4Fe-4S]2+ to [2Fe-2S]2+ conversion mechanism was recently proposed by Sutton et al. (23Sutton V.R. Mettert E.L. Beinert H. Kiley P.J. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8018-8025Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Using Ferene, a strong Fe2+ chelator, release of two Fe2+ ions per cluster was determined, leading to the suggestion that oxidation of released sulfide ions to S0, rather than cluster iron, was taking place. Here we report, using a novel analytical method, direct determination of the amount of cluster sulfide ions released upon in vitro conversion of [4Fe-4S] FNR into [2Fe-2S] FNR. The data demonstrate that cluster sulfur is ejected as sulfide ions and is not, therefore, oxidized upon cluster conversion. The implications of this for the mechanism of oxygen sensing by FNR [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters are discussed. Purification of [4Fe-4S] FNR—Native FNR protein was over-produced in aerobic cultures of JRG5369 (E. coli BL21λDE3 pGS1859). Plasmid pGS1859 was constructed by ligating the fnr gene from pGS199 (24Spiro S. Guest J.R. Microbiology. 1987; 133: 3279-3288Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar) as a NcoI-BamHI fragment into the corresponding restriction sites within the expression vector pET11d (Stratagene). FNR overproduction was initiated by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Formation of [4Fe-4S] FNR was promoted, in vivo, by sparging cultures with oxygen-free nitrogen gas at 4 °C, essentially as described by Sutton and Kiley (25Sutton V.R. Kiley P.J. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 370: 300-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). All protein purification and handling was carried out under strictly anaerobic conditions in an anaerobic cabinet (Belle Technology), typically operating at ≤2.0 ppm O2 by volume, equipped with a specially designed fridge-freezer for anaerobic sample storage and fitted with a liquid nitrogen access port. All buffers were sparged with oxygen-free nitrogen gas for a minimum of 2 h. The purity of isolated FNR was assessed by SDS-PAGE. Full details of the growth conditions and purification of FNR will be published elsewhere. Purification of Reconstituted [4Fe-4S] FNR—Glutathione S-transferase-FNR fusion protein was produced in aerobically grown E. coli BL21λDE3 pGS572, as described previously (17Crack J. Green J. Thomson A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9278-9286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). FNR was cleaved from the fusion protein using thrombin and [4Fe-4S] FNR reconstituted in vitro, as described previously (17Crack J. Green J. Thomson A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9278-9286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), except that a 1-ml HiTrap heparin column (GE Healthcare) was used (25Sutton V.R. Kiley P.J. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 370: 300-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) in place of a Sephadex G25 column to remove low molecular weight contaminants and to perform buffer exchange. Purification of [2Fe-2S] FNR—An aliquot of native [4Fe-4S] FNR (1 ml, ∼119 μm in cluster) in buffer A was removed from the anaerobic cabinet, treated with 500 μl of buffer A containing dissolved atmospheric oxygen, and gently agitated in air for 90 s. The sample was then returned to the anaerobic cabinet. [2Fe-2S] FNR was isolated from cluster breakdown products using a Sephadex G25 column (PD10, GE Healthcare). The protein, iron, and sulfide contents of the sample were determined as described below. Quantitative Methods—FNR protein concentrations were determined using the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad), with bovine serum albumin as the standard (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217450) Google Scholar) and a previously determined correction factor of 0.83 (15Green J. Bennett B. Jordan P. Ralph E.T. Thomson A.J. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 887-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). FNR iron content was determined in the following way: 0.1 ml of 21.7% HNO3 was added to the same volume of protein and incubated at 95 °C for 30 min. Cooled samples were centrifuged to remove any precipitate, treated with 0.6 ml of 7.5% (w/v) ammonium acetate, 0.1 ml of 12.5% (w/v) ascorbic acid, 0.1 ml of 10 mm Ferene, mixed, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min before absorbance at 593 nm was measured. Iron concentrations were determined by reference to a calibration curve generated from Fe3+ solutions in the range 0–200 μm, prepared from SpectrosoL standard iron solution (BDH, Lot OC495679), and treated as described above. Acid-labile sulfide was determined according to the method of Beinert (27Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Based on the analyses, both native and reconstituted [4Fe-4S]2+ FNR samples exhibited ϵ405 nm values of 16,220 ± 135 m–1 cm–1, in close agreement to previously reported values (23Sutton V.R. Mettert E.L. Beinert H. Kiley P.J. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8018-8025Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The concentration of dissolved atmospheric oxygen present in buffer solutions was determined by chemical analysis according to the method of Winkler (28Vogel A.I. Mendham J. Jeffery G.H. Bassett J. Denney R.C. Textbook of Quantitative Chemical Analysis. 5th Ed. Longman Scientific & Technical, Harlow, UK1989: 395-399Google Scholar). Quantitation of Sulfide Released during Cluster Conversion—Quantitation of sulfide released from the cluster during the [4Fe-4S]2+ to [2Fe-2S]2+ conversion was carried out using a modified version of the procedure based on DTNB (Ellman's reagent) reported by Nashef and colleagues (29Nashef A.S. Osuga D.T. Feeney R.E. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 79: 394-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, [4Fe-4S] FNR (∼5–10 μm) was treated with DTNB (∼200 μm) under anaerobic conditions and incubated at room temperature for 2 min prior to measurement of absorbance at 412 nm (30Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). The [4Fe-4S]2+ to [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster transition was subsequently induced by injecting an aliquot of buffer containing dissolved atmospheric oxygen (∼40 μm final concentration). Absorbance at 412 nm was measured again after an incubation period of 12 min at room temperature (sufficient time for the reaction (ΔA412 nm) to plateau under the given conditions (data not shown)). The reactive thiol content of [2Fe-2S] FNR was measured as absorbance changes at 412 nm following the anaerobic addition of DTNB (∼200 μm) and incubation for 2 min at room temperature. Reactive thiol and free sulfide concentrations were calculated by determining the concentration of released TNB anion, using an ϵ412 value of 14,151 m–1 cm–1 in buffer A at pH 6.8, 12,344 m–1 cm–1 in buffer B at pH 7.5, or 14,611 m–1 cm–1 in buffer B containing 6 m guanidine HCl (see below). ΔA values at 412 nm were corrected for the changes at 412 nm, which were due only to the [4Fe-4S]2+ to [2Fe-2S]2+ conversion. To determine whether the liberation of the TNB anions was due, in part, to the generation of superoxide or hydrogen peroxide, experiments were repeated in the presence of catalase (268 units) and superoxide dismutase (35 units). Iron released during the conversion was determined by adding Ferene (100 μm) and ascorbate (600 μm), to generate [Fe(II)(Ferene)3]4–, and by incubating at room temperature for 2 min prior to measurement of absorbance at 593 nm. Adventitiously bound iron was determined by treating an anaerobic [4Fe-4S] FNR sample with Ferene and ascorbate as described above. Experiments were performed in two different buffer systems: 10 mm potassium phosphate, 400 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, pH 6.8 (buffer A), and 25 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaNO3, pH 7.5 (buffer B). We verified that the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster was stable to the presence of DTNB and Ferene in both buffer systems tested under anaerobic conditions, at least for the duration of the experiment (data not shown). The response of DTNB to sulfide was calibrated using a standard solution of Na2S prepared as described by Beinert (27Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) and verified by iodometric titration as described by Vogel (28Vogel A.I. Mendham J. Jeffery G.H. Bassett J. Denney R.C. Textbook of Quantitative Chemical Analysis. 5th Ed. Longman Scientific & Technical, Harlow, UK1989: 395-399Google Scholar). 0.1 ml of Na2S was added to 2 ml of buffer A containing excess DTNB (2.4 mm) and absorbance at 412 nm measured after 2 min. The amount of TNB anion produced was calculated using a ϵ412 value of 14,151 m–1 cm–1. To assess the effects of protein and Fe2+, DTNB reactions were repeated in the presence of lysozyme (0.8 mg/ml) and (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 (117 μm). Cysteine, rather than Na2S, was used for the Fe2+ control experiment due to the poor solubility of FeS. All determinations were carried out in triplicate. Absorbance measurements were made with a Jasco V550 UV-visible spectrophotometer. Since the initial report by Ellman (31Ellman G. Lysko H. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 93: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) on the thiol-specific reactions of DTNB, the reagent has been used extensively as a means for the quantitation of thiol groups in proteins. However, DTNB may also be used as a colorimetric reagent, as reported by Nashef et al. (29Nashef A.S. Osuga D.T. Feeney R.E. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 79: 394-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), for the determination of sulfide ions, see Scheme 1. We have suitably modified the published method (29Nashef A.S. Osuga D.T. Feeney R.E. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 79: 394-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) to quantify sulfide released from FNR during [4Fe-4S]2+ to [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster conversion. The reaction of DTNB with sulfide ion was calibrated against standard Na2S solutions, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These data (data not shown) confirmed that sulfide ions react stoichiometrically with DTNB to yield two TNB anions, as reported previously (29Nashef A.S. Osuga D.T. Feeney R.E. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 79: 394-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We also verified that neither the presence of protein nor Fe2+ interferes with the DTNB reaction. From this we concluded that the assay can be used to measure the concentration of sulfide ion in solution. The addition of excess DTNB to [4Fe-4S] FNR under anaerobic conditions causes spectral changes due to the release of TNB anions (Fig. 1A). These arise from the reaction of DTNB with free protein thiol. FNR contains five cysteine residues of which four (Cys20, Cys23, Cys29, Cys122) ligate the [4Fe-4S] cluster. Hence Cys16 should be available for reaction with a modifying reagent such as DTNB, see Scheme 2. In addition, samples of reconstituted and native FNR are not 100% replete with [4Fe-4S] cluster. There is a component of cluster-free (apo-) protein typically ranging from 15 to 30% and 23 to 43% for reconstituted and native FNR, respectively. All five cysteines of apo-FNR are potentially available for reaction with DTNB. However, it has been demonstrated recently (32Achebach S. Selmer T. Unden G. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 4260-4269Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) that only four out of the five cysteines present in apo-FNR are reactive toward thiol-specific modifying reagents under anaerobic conditions in the presence of denaturants. We have found that the apo-FNR content of samples contains up to three thiols available for modification (see Table 1) depending upon the method used for purification. Under anaerobic denaturing conditions (buffer B containing 6 m guanidine HCl) we have found 4.7 (±0.4) and 4.1 (±0.5) thiols available for modification per monomer in reconstituted and native FNR, respectively (data not shown), consistent with the observations of Achebach and colleagues (32Achebach S. Selmer T. Unden G. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 4260-4269Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).SCHEME 2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1Determination of sulfide and iron released upon exposure of native and reconstituted [4Fe-4S] FNR proteins to oxygenSample no.AnaerobicAfter addition of oxygen (∼ 40 μm)ProteinApo-protein[4Fe-4S]TNBaDTNB was added to the as-isolated protein under non-denaturing anaerobic conditions.

Open table in a new tab The introduction of oxygen causes further substantial changes in the UV-visible spectrum of the FNR DTNB mix due to TNB anion release (Fig. 1B). Since DTNB is inert to oxygen (30Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar), the observed reaction is due to changes in FNR following cluster conversion. To determine the amount of sulfide ion released during FNR cluster conversion, a correction to the ΔA412 nm value was made to account for the spectral changes arising from the cluster conversion [4Fe-4S] to [2Fe-2S] (Fig. 1B). The [2Fe-2S] clusters are believed to have the same cysteine ligands as the [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters (13Khoroshilova N. Popescu C. Munck E. Beinert H. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6087-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). To confirm that cluster conversion does not expose any of the [4Fe-4S]2+ cysteine ligands to reaction with thiol modification reagents, [2Fe-2S] FNR was isolated, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Reaction of an aliquot of 5.2 μm [2Fe-2S] FNR (containing 5.2 μm protein, 10.9 μm iron, and 10.2 μm sulfide) with DTNB resulted in a TNB anion concentration of 5.7 μm, indicating the modification of 1.1 (±0.1) thiols per [2Fe-2S] FNR. In the absence of apo-FNR, this is consistent with the modification of Cys16 in each [2Fe-2S] FNR molecule. This supports the conclusion that Cys20, Cys23, Cys29, and Cys122 are the ligands that bind both the [4Fe-4S]2+ and [2Fe-2S]2+ clusters (13Khoroshilova N. Popescu C. Munck E. Beinert H. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6087-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Hence the observed increase in absorbance at 412 nm is not due to further thiol modification. Instead, we ascribe it to the reaction of DTNB with sulfide ions released during cluster conversion. A series of experiments on both native and reconstituted [4Fe-4S] FNR, in two different buffer systems, all resulted in the detection of ∼2 sulfide ions per cluster (see Table 1). In addition to two sulfide ions, two iron ions should be released during cluster conversion. We determined iron released during conversion by the introduction of Ferene and ascorbate following the reaction of [4Fe-4S] FNR with oxygen in the presence of excess DTNB. This resulted in a large absorbance band at 593 nm, characteristic of the [Fe(II)(Ferene)3]4– complex (Fig. 1C). Significantly the iron released amounts to ∼2 iron ions per cluster (Table 1). Therefore, we propose that the reaction observed when the FNR [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster is oxidized by O2 in the presence of DTNB proceeds as in Scheme 3. The [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster formally consists of two Fe2+ and two Fe3+ ions that are valence delocalised providing an average oxidation state of Fe2.5+ across all four iron ions. The [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster formally contains two Fe3+ ions, therefore ejection of two Fe2+ ions with two sulfide ions from the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster with formation of a [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster is not oxidative (see Equation 1). 4Fe-4S2++O2→2Fe-2S2++2Fe2++2S2-+O2(Eq. 1) If one Fe2+ ion was oxidized to Fe3+ by oxygen (here called metal oxidation) to yield a [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster then a superoxide ion, one Fe3+ ion and one Fe2+ ion would be expected as the products (see Equation 2). 4Fe-4S2++O2→2Fe-4S2++Fe3++Fe2++2S2-+O2-(Eq. 2) Indeed, such a mixture of iron oxidation states has been observed by Khoroshilova et al. (13Khoroshilova N. Popescu C. Munck E. Beinert H. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6087-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 16Khoroshilova N. Beinert H. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2499-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we cannot rule out the possibility that the hydrogen peroxide detected following reaction of [4Fe-4S] FNR with oxygen (17Crack J. Green J. Thomson A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9278-9286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) originates from the dismutation of superoxide. Importantly, it has been reported that superoxide can reduce DTNB to TNB species (33Peterson D.A. Archer S.L. Weir E.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1586-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Therefore, the sulfide release experiments were repeated in the presence of catalase and superoxide dismutase. No specific effects attributable to superoxide (or hydrogen peroxide) were detected (Table 1). Recently Sutton et al. (23Sutton V.R. Mettert E.L. Beinert H. Kiley P.J. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8018-8025Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) proposed an alternative mechanism of [4Fe-4S]2+ to [2Fe-2S]2+ conversion that proceeds via the oxidation of cluster S2– ions (here termed sulfide oxidation). This was based on the observation that, in the presence of the strong Fe2+ chelator, Ferene, two Fe2+ ions were detected per cluster following reaction with oxygen. This leads to the possibility of a four-electron reduction of oxygen to water at the expense of cluster sulfide (see Equation 3) (23Sutton V.R. Mettert E.L. Beinert H. Kiley P.J. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8018-8025Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). 4Fe-4S2++O2+4H+→2Fe-2S2++2Fe2++2S0+2H2O(Eq. 3) Previously we have proposed a mechanism for FNR cluster conversion based upon the observation of a [3Fe-4S]1+ intermediate cluster together with the detection of hydrogen peroxide generated during cluster conversion (Ref. 17Crack J. Green J. Thomson A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9278-9286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar; see Equation 4). Note that the [3Fe-4S]1+ cluster contains three Fe3+ ions. 4Fe-4S2++O2+2H+→3Fe-4S1++Fe3++H2O2→2Fe-2S2++Fe3++2S2-(Eq. 4) This mechanism results in an overall two electron oxidation reaction, in which both Fe2+ ions present in the [4Fe-4S] cluster are oxidized to Fe3+ ions (see Equation 5). 4Fe-4S2++O2+2H+→2Fe-2S2++2Fe3++2S2-+H2O2(Eq. 5) To reconcile the apparent inconsistencies in observations by different workers (compare Equations 3 and 5), Sutton et al. (23Sutton V.R. Mettert E.L. Beinert H. Kiley P.J. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8018-8025Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) suggested that [4Fe-4S] FNR prepared via in vitro reconstitution, as described by Crack et al. (17Crack J. Green J. Thomson A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9278-9286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), reacts in a significantly different manner to the native [4Fe-4S]2+ FNR following exposure to oxygen. Here, we have used both in vitro reconstituted and native [4Fe-4S] FNR and find no significant differences in the behavior of the proteins (Table 1). This suggests that the same chemistry occurs in vitro upon exposure to oxygen, regardless of whether [4Fe-4S] FNR is generated in vivo or in vitro. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that two sulfide ions are ejected from the FNR [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster in response to oxygen, in vitro, irrespective of whether the [4Fe-4S] FNR is reconstituted or native protein. This is consistent with the idea that the reaction between oxygen and the cluster occurs via metal oxidation, rather than via a sulfide oxidation pathway. The method of sulfide ion determination reported here might be more widely applicable to other studies of iron-sulfur systems that involve cluster conversion or disassembly.

High [Ca2+]i (>10 μm) achieved in close proximity to the mouths of Ca2+ channels inhibit InsP3R gating (5Mak D.-O.D. McBride S. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Notably, InsP3 and ATP affect channel activity by allosteric modulation of the Ca2+ regulation of the channel (8Mak D.-O.D. McBride S. Foskett J.K. J. Biol.

Thus, the mechanisms underlying [Ca2+]i regulation of InsP3R activity are of central importance in determining the properties of [Ca2+]i signals in cells. Nevertheless, the molecular details of this regulation are still unknown. The relative roles of Ca2+ binding to the InsP3R and indirect regulation by Ca2+ binding to other proteins have been debated. Thus, it has been suggested that high [Ca2+]i inhibition of the InsP3R is mediated by calmedin (16Danoff S.K. Supattapone S. Snyder S.H. Biochem.

Nevertheless, the molecular identity of calmedin has not been established, and recent results strongly suggest that high [Ca2+]i inhibition of the InsP3R is not mediated by CaM (19Zhang X.

McBride S. Mak D.-O.D. Vardi N. Palczewski K. Haeseleer F. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7711-7716Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), a subset of the neuronal Ca2+ sensor (NCS) family of EF-hand-containing proteins that contains eight genes (CaBP1–8) with alternatively spliced forms (23Haeseleer F.

CaBP1 bound with high affinity (apparent KD < 50 nm) in a Ca2+-dependent manner within the NH2-terminal 600 residues of all three mammalian InsP3R isoforms, a region that encompasses the InsP3-binding domain. Of note, in single-channel electrophysiological studies, acute application of recombinant CaBP1, CaBP2, and CaBP5 activated channel gating in the absence of InsP3. In contrast, CaM neither bound with high affinity nor activated channel gating (22Yang J. McBride S. Mak D.-O.D. Vardi N. Palczewski K. Haeseleer F. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7711-7716Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These studies therefore identified CaBPs as specific protein ligands of the InsP3R channel.The Ca2+ dependence of the interaction with CaBP1 suggested that the InsP3R could possibly become engaged in vivo as a Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release channel in the absence of InsP3 generation and that the interaction might tune the sensitivity of the channel to InsP3 (22Yang J. McBride S. Mak D.-O.D. Vardi N. Palczewski K. Haeseleer F. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7711-7716Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies revealed that overexpression of CaBP1 attenuated InsP3R-dependent Ca2+ release in intact cells (25Haynes L.P. Tepikin A.V. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol.

Taken together, the results appear to suggest that CaBPs can tune InsP3R activity by both activation and inhibition. However, the mechanisms that enable these proteins to both activate and inhibit the channel are not clear.CaBPs are exclusively expressed in the brain and retina (24Haeseleer F. Sokal I. Verlinde C.L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. Fariss R.N. Palczewski K. J. Biol.

However, it is unknown whether non-neuronal proteins exist that function as protein ligands of the InsP3R in peripheral tissues. We reasoned that more widely expressed, structurally similar EF-hand proteins might also interact with InsP3Rs as channel ligands. To facilitate their identification, we have first characterized the structural determinants for CaBP1 binding to the InsP3R. We found that disruption of any one of three functional EF-hands reduced binding to the InsP3R, with EF3 and EF4 being particularly important. Based on these observations, we examined other ER-localized proteins with functional EF3 and EF4 for binding to the InsP3R. We show that one of these, CIB1 (calcium- and integrin-binding protein; also called calmyrin or KIP), a widely expressed protein, bound strongly in aCa2+-dependent manner within the InsP3-binding region of the InsP3R. In single channel experiments, CIB1 was found to act as a direct activating ligand of the channel in the absence of InsP3. However, pre-exposure of the receptor to CIB1 reduced the number of channels available for subsequent activation by InsP3, and overexpression of CIB1 decreased the amplitude of agonist-induced [Ca2+]i transients in intact cells. Our data identify CIB1 as a widely expressed novel protein ligand of the InsP3R that gates the channel and inhibits subsequent InsP3-dependent stimulation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—COS-7 (Cercopithecus aethiops kidney) and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/high glucose medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml–1 penicillin, and 100 μgml–1 streptomycin. PC12 cells were grown in F-12K medium (ATCC) supplemented with 15% (v/v) horse serum (Invitrogen), 2.5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, and 100 μgml–1 penicillin and 100 μg ml–1 streptomycin and maintained in a humidified 95, 5% air, CO2 atmosphere.

The NH2-terminal 521 residues of rat InsP3R-2 were cloned into pcDNA/V5 (Invitrogen). Other InsP3R constructs have been described (22Yang J. McBride S. Mak D.-O.D. Vardi N. Palczewski K. Haeseleer F.

GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli (BL-21; Stratagene), and pull-down assays were performed as described (22Yang J. McBride S. Mak D.-O.D. Vardi N. Palczewski K. Haeseleer F.

Transfected cells were seeded onto glass coverslips, cultured for 48 h, transferred to a perfusion chamber on the stage of a microscope (Nikon TE2000), and incubated with fura-2 AM (Molecular Probes; 2 μm) for 60 min at room temperature in normal medium. Cells were continuously perfused with Hanks' balanced salt solution (Sigma) containing 1.8 mm CaCl2 and 0.8 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4. Transfected cells were identified by green fluorescent protein fluorescence; fura-2 was alternately excited at 340 and 380 nm, and emitted fluorescence (510 nm) was collected and recorded using a CCD-based imaging system running Ultraview software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Dye calibration was achieved by applying experimentally determined constants to the equation: [Ca2+] = Kd · β · (R – Rmin)/(Rmax – R).Analysis and Statistics—Data were summarized as mean ± S.E.; statistical significance of differences between means, assessed using unpaired t-tests, were accepted at the 95% level (p < 0.05).RESULTSStructural Determinants of CaBP1 Binding to InsP3R—Both long and short NH2-terminal splice variants of CaBP1 (l-CaBP1 and s-CaBP1) bind with high affinity within the InsP3-binding NH2-terminal 600 residues of the InsP3R. The interaction was strongly potentiated by Ca2+ (Refs. 22Yang J. McBride S. Mak D.-O.D. Vardi N. Palczewski K. Haeseleer F. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A construct (c-CaBP1) encompassing the COOH-terminal region containing all four EF-hands that is shared among the splice variants bound nearly as well as s-CaBP1 (Fig. 1A). Deletion of EF-hands 1 and 2 (EF1, EF2), creating a truncated protein identified as calbrain (31Yamaguchi K. Yamaguchi F. Miyamoto O. Sugimoto K. Konishi R. Hatase O. Tokuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3610-3616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), decreased binding efficiency by ∼50% (Fig. 1A). The substantial binding of this construct suggested that functional EF-hands 3 and 4 are important for InsP3R binding. Disabling EF1, by replacements with alanines at positions one and three, reduced InsP3R binding by ∼25% (Fig. 1B), whereas mutating either EF4 or EF3 reduced binding by ∼46 and ∼75%, respectively (Fig. 1B). Although some binding was observed to c-CaBP1 with only EF3 functional, mutation of EF3 and either EF1 or EF4 or all three EF-hands together eliminated binding (Fig. 1B). These data suggest that there is no strict requirement for specific EF-hands but that at least two are necessary, with Ca2+-binding EF3 and EF4 of particular importance.Identification and Characterization of CIB1 as an InsP3R Ligand-binding Domain-interacting Protein—We hypothesized that other ER-localized proteins with functional EF-hands 3 and 4 might also interact with the InsP3R. We examined four candidates: sorcin, a penta-EF-hand protein that interacts with the ryanodine receptor Ca2+ release channel (32Lokuta A.J. Meyers M.B. Sander P.R. Fishman G.I. Valdivia H.H. J. Biol.

Weiss J.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). CaM, which contains four functional EF-hands, interacts only weakly with the InsP3R ligand-binding domain, with an apparent affinity over an order of magnitude weaker than that of CaBP1 (22Yang J. McBride S. Mak D.-O.D. Vardi N. Palczewski K. Haeseleer F. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7711-7716Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Similarly, neither sorcin, calsenilin, nor NCS-1 interacted with the channel (Fig. 2B). In contrast, CIB1 was very efficient in pulling down the InsP3R-1 NH2-terminal domain from Sf9 cell lysates (Fig. 2B), although its affinity appears to be somewhat weaker than that of CaBP1. These results demonstrate specificity in the interactions of the InsP3R with EF-hand-containing proteins and establish CIB1 as a protein interactor of the ligand-binding region of the InsP3R.FIGURE 2Interaction of InsP3R-1 with EF-hand-containing proteins.

Only s-CaBP1 and CIB1 pulled down the InsP3R (upper gel).

Thus, CIB1 interacts with all three InsP3R isoforms. Immunoprecipitation of endogenous InsP3R-3 co-precipitated endogenous CIB1 from COS-7 and HeLa cells (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the endogenous proteins can interact in vivo.FIGURE 3CIB1 interaction with type-2 and type-3 InsP3R.

The [Ca2+] dependence of CaBP1 binding to InsP3R was examined previously by quantifying binding of GST-CaBP1 to endogenous COS-7 cell InsP3R-3 in lysates with [Ca2+] fixed over a wide range (22Yang J.

We assessed the [Ca2+] dependence of the CIB1-InsP3R interaction using the same methods. Increasing [Ca2+] from 10 nm to 100 μm strongly enhanced binding by over 10-fold with apparent half-maximal activity at ∼1–5 μm (Fig. 4A).FIGURE 4[Ca2+] dependence of InsP3 R-CIB1 interaction.

Disruption of either EF-hand profoundly reduced the interaction between CIB1 and InsP3R-3 (Fig. 4B), confirming their functional importance. In summary, CIB1 interacts with the ligand-binding region of all three isoforms of the InsP3Rin a Ca2+-dependent manner that depends on Ca2+ binding to both functional EF-hands, features all highly reminiscent of the interaction of CaBP1 with the InsP3R.CIB1 Is a Protein Ligand of the InsP3R Channel—We showed previously that in vitro interaction of CaBP1 with the InsP3R activated single channel gating in the absence of added InsP3 (22Yang J.

https://openalex.org/W2126646644,"The cellular mechanisms mediating nitric oxide (NO) modulation of the inhibitory transmission in the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) remain unclear, even though this could be extremely important for various physiological and pathological processes. Specifically, in the NTS NO-evoked glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release might contribute to pathological hypertension. In cultured rat brainstem slices, NTS GABAergic neurons were targeted using an adenoviral vector to express enhanced green fluorescent protein and studied with a combination of patch clamp and confocal microscopy. Low nanomolar concentrations of NO increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in somata, dendrites, and putative axons of GABAergic neurons, with axons being the most sensitive compartment. This effect was cGMP mediated and not related to depolarization or indirect presynaptic effects on glutamatergic transmission. Blockade of the cyclic adenosine diphosphate ribose (cADPR)/ryanodine-sensitive stores but not the inositol triphosphate-sensitive stores, inhibited NO effect. Since cADPR/ryanodine-sensitive stores are implicated in the Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, NO can be expected to potentiate GABA release. In support of this notion, a cADPR antagonist abolished the NO-induced potentiation of GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in the NTS. Thus, the NO-cGMP-cADPR-Ca2+ pathway, previously described in sea urchin eggs, also operates in mammalian GABAergic neurons. Potentiation of GABA release by NO may have implications for numerous brain functions."

The reversible phosphorylation of cellular proteins provides a means to induce rapid and profound changes in the function or stability of a protein, and is recognized as a major process by which many aspects of cell biology are regulated. In the field of plus-strand RNA viruses, the largest class of viruses (1van Regenmortel M.H.V. Fauquet C.M. Bishop D.H.L. Carstens E.B. Estes M.K. Lemon S.M. Maniloff J. Mayo M.A. McGeoch D.J.

The replication of plus-strand RNA virus genomes depends upon assembly of an intricate replication complex comprising both virus and host components (2Ahlquist P. Noueiry A.O. Lee W.M. Kushner D.B.

The viral genomic plus-strand RNA first acts as a template for the synthesis of a complementary (minus-strand) RNA, which in turn directs synthesis of progeny plus-strand RNA. During replication, a large excess of plus-over minus-strands is produced, but the molecular mechanisms regulating this observed asymmetry and its temporal control are still largely unknown (3Buck K.W. Adv. Virus Res. 1996; 47: 159-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several viral RdRps are now known to be phosphoproteins (4Kapoor M. Zhang L. Ramachandra M. Kusukawa J. Ebner K.E. Padmanabhan R. J.

Analysis of viral RdRp phosphorylation is especially important given the essential function of this enzyme in viral replication and the common architecture and mechanism of polymerase catalysis (8Joyce C.M.

Here we address this question by studying phosphorylation of the RdRp of the tymovirus Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV). The genomic RNA of TYMV, a plant-infecting member of the alphavirus-like superfamily of plus-strand RNA viruses (9Dreher T.W. Mol. Plant Pathol. 2004; 5: 367-375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), encodes two nonstructural proteins of 69 and 206 kDa (206K), the coat protein (CP) being expressed from a subgenomic RNA. 206K, the only viral protein required for TYMV RNA replication, shares considerable sequence similarity with replication proteins of other plus-strand RNA viruses and contains domains indicative of methyltransferase, proteinase, NTPase/helicase, and RdRp activities. Self-cleavage of 206K generates an N-terminal 140K protein and a C-terminal 66K protein encompassing the RdRp domain (10Prod'homme D. Le Panse S. Drugeon G. Jupin I. Virology. 2001; 281: 88-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Both 140K and 66K are essential for TYMV RNA replication (11Weiland J.J. Dreher T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. 2000; 349: 417-425PubMed Google Scholar), but the significance of this post-translational modification in the TYMV life cycle was not investigated. In this study, we demonstrate that TYMV RdRp is phosphorylated in plant cells, when expressed both individually and in the context of viral infection. Using a comprehensive biochemical approach, including metabolic labeling, peptide separation, and mass spectrometry analyses, two phosphorylation sites were mapped within an N-terminal PEST sequence and two others within the highly conserved palm subdomain of RNA polymerases. Systematic mutational analysis of the corresponding residues was used to investigate the correlation between RdRp phosphorylation, assembly of replication complexes, and viral infectivity. The results obtained support the idea that phosphorylation-dependent regulatory mechanisms are essential for viral RdRp function and virus replication. Plasmid Constructions—Plasmid E17, from which full-length TYMV infectious transcripts can be obtained, plant expression vectors pΩ-66K, pΩ-140K, pΩ-206K, pΩ-CP, and pΩ-EGFP-140K and yeast two-hybrid vectors 2P-140K(555-1259) and pGad-66K were described previously (12Prod'homme D.

Virol. 2002; 83: 3187-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis in plasmid E17, verified by sequencing, and subcloned in pΩ-66K and pGad-66K. In Vitro Transcription and Translation—Synthesis of capped in vitro transcripts, in vitro translation reactions of viral RNA, or in vitro transcripts in rabbit reticulocyte lysate and their analysis by SDS-PAGE were performed as described (14Drugeon G. Jupin I. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 3187-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). DNA fragments encoding WT or mutant 66K under the control of a T7 promoter were generated by PCR as described (10Prod'homme D. Le Panse S. Drugeon G. Jupin I. Virology. 2001; 281: 88-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and were transcribed and translated in vitro in the TnT T7 quick-coupled transcription/translation system and TnT T7 coupled wheat germ extract system (Promega). Expression of His-66K in Insect Cells, Metabolic Labeling, and Purification—Spodoptera frugiperda cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus Bac8AF as described (5Héricourt F. Blanc S. Redeker V. Jupin I. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 417-425PubMed Google Scholar) using a mixture (1:1) of Grace and SF900-II (Invitrogen) culture media. In vivo metabolic labeling was performed by adding 62.5 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate to the growth medium 24 h post-infection. After a 24-h labeling period, the His-66K was purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate affinity chromatography as described (5Héricourt F. Blanc S. Redeker V. Jupin I. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 417-425PubMed Google Scholar). Trypsin Digestion and Reverse-phase Chromatography—Purified His-66K (∼60 pmol) was reduced, alkylated, and digested with sequencing grade trypsin (Roche Applied Science) (5Héricourt F. Blanc S. Redeker V. Jupin I. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 417-425PubMed Google Scholar). The sample was loaded onto a reverse-phase HPLC column (5 μm, 250 × 1 mm, RP18, Spheri5; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and washed with solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Peptides were separated by elution with a gradient consisting of 0-40% solvent B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 90% acetonitrile) over 60 min, and 40-60% solvent B over 10 min, followed by isocratic elution with 100% solvent B. The flow rate was 50 μl/min, and peptide elution was monitored by UV absorbance at 214 nm. Fractions were collected manually, and aliquots were spotted on 3MM Whatman paper, and 32P radioactivity was detected by autoradiography. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analyses—HPLC fractions displaying radioactive content were mixed (1:1, v/v) with 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (Aldrich) as a matrix and analyzed on a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Voyager STR, Applied Biosystems) as described (5Héricourt F. Blanc S. Redeker V. Jupin I. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 417-425PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm peptide phosphorylation, the ions were selected for PSD analysis (15Annan R.S. Carr S.A. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 3413-3421Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). For tandem mass spectrometry studies, HPLC fractions were dried completely, and peptides were resuspended in methanol/H2O/formic acid (12:7:1) and analyzed using a nano-ES Q-TOF I instrument (Micromass). The collision energy used for peptide fragmentation, adapted to each peptide, was typically between 18 and 40 eV. Tandem mass spectra of multiply charged parent ions were deconvoluted in monoprotonated ion fragments using MaxEnt3 software (Micromass). Transfection of Arabidopsis Protoplasts, Protein Extraction, SDS-PAGE, and Immunodetection Analyses—Protoplasts of Arabidopsis thaliana were prepared and transfected as described (13Jakubiec A.

Each viral mutant was transfected between 2 and 6 times using various batches of in vitro transcripts. Total protein extraction from protoplasts, SDS-PAGE, and immunodetection using anti-66K, anti-CP or anti-140K antibodies was performed as described (12Prod'homme D. Jakubiec A. Tournier V. Drugeon G.

Quantitation of viral proteins was performed by scanning blots from at least three independent replicate experiments, using serial dilutions of protein extracts and ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Immunoprecipitation, Protein Phosphatase Treatment, and Metabolic Labeling—Immunoprecipitation of 66K from protoplast extracts was as described (10Prod'homme D. Le Panse S. Drugeon G. Jupin I. Virology. 2001; 281: 88-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) except that immunoprecipitates were collected using Pansorbin (Calbiochem). Immunoprecipitates were either directly subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted to nitrocellulose membranes, or resuspended in phosphatase buffer and incubated with 400 and 800 units of λ phosphatase (New England Biolabs) for 1 h at 30°C prior to electrophoresis; where required, 50 mm EDTA was added to inhibit the phosphatase activity. For coimmunoprecipitation experiments, transfected protoplasts were harvested 48 hpt and were lysed by incubation in buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.5% Lubrol W) at 4 °C for 45 min. Samples were then clarified by centrifugation for 40 min at 20,000 × g and incubated overnight at 4 °C in the presence of anti-140K antiserum. The antigen-antibody complexes were precipitated with Pansorbin, washed twice with buffer D, and analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. The nitrocellulose membranes were probed successively with the anti-66K and anti-140K antisera as described previously (13Jakubiec A. Notaise J. Tournier V. Héricourt F. Block M.A. Drugeon G. van Aelst L. Jupin I. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 7945-7957Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) to allow dual-color detection of the viral proteins. In vivo metabolic labeling was performed by adding 100 μCi/ml of [32P]orthophosphate to phosphate-free culture medium 2 hpt. After the labeling period, the 66K protein was immunoprecipitated, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and blotted to nitrocellulose membranes. Radioactivity was detected by PhosphorImaging prior to immunodetection. Quantitation of 32P incorporation was performed using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences) on at least three independent replicate experiments. Statistical significance of the differences between assay and control values was evaluated using a Mann-Whitney rank test. RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Hybridization—Transfected protoplasts were harvested 48 hpt, and total RNA was extracted using Tri-Reagent (MRC, Inc.). Equivalent amounts of total RNA were loaded onto 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels using 2.5 and 10 μg for viral plus- and minus-strand detection, respectively. Blotting and hybridization were performed as described (12Prod'homme D. Jakubiec A. Tournier V. Drugeon G. Jupin I. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 9124-9135Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) using riboprobes hybridizing to nucleotides 5984-6318 or corresponding to nucleotides 3278-3561 of the TYMV RNA for detection of plus- and minus-strand RNAs, respectively. Quantitation of viral RNAs was performed by scanning blots from at least three independent replicate experiments, using serial dilutions of RNA extracts and ImageJ software. Tryptic Phosphopeptide Mapping—Phosphopeptide analysis was performed as described (16Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar, 17Luo K. Hurley T.R. Sefton B.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) after transfer of 32P-labeled proteins to nitrocellulose membranes and digestion with sequencing grade trypsin (Roche Applied Science). The peptides were spotted onto 20 × 20-cm cellulose thin layer chromatography plates (Eastman Kodak Co.). Electrophoresis (500 V for 50 min in pH 3.5 buffer) in the 1st dimension was followed by ascending chromatography in n-butyl alcohol/pyridine/acetic acid/H2O at 15:10:3:12 (v/v). Phosphopeptides were detected by PhosphorImaging and quantitation of 32P incorporation was performed using ImageQuant software. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Immunofluorescence staining, observation of EGFP fluorescence, confocal microscopy, and image acquisition were performed as described (12Prod'homme D. Jakubiec A. Tournier V. Drugeon G. Jupin I. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 9124-9135Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 13Jakubiec A. Notaise J. Tournier V. Héricourt F. Block M.A. Drugeon G. van Aelst L. Jupin I. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 7945-7957Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Yeast Transformation and Two-hybrid Assays—All media, buffers, methods for yeast transformation and selection, two-hybrid assays, quantitative β-galactosidase assays, and statistical analyses were performed as described previously (13Jakubiec A. Notaise J. Tournier V. Héricourt F. Block M.A. Drugeon G. van Aelst L. Jupin I. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 7945-7957Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) using a GAL4-based system. TYMV 66K Is Phosphorylated in Plant Cells—TYMV 66K RdRp produced in insect cells is phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues (5Héricourt F. Blanc S. Redeker V. Jupin I. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 417-425PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the extensively documented ability of baculovirus expression systems to perform appropriate post-translational modifications of recombinant proteins, it was necessary to determine whether the TYMV 66K was also phosphorylated in plant cells, either when expressed individually or in the context of a viral infection. Arabidopsis protoplasts were transfected with TYMV viral RNA or with the plasmid pΩ-66K. This transient expression vector encodes TYMV 66K in a biologically active conformation, as demonstrated by its ability to trans-complement a defective viral mutant (12Prod'homme D. Jakubiec A. Tournier V. Drugeon G. Jupin I. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 9124-9135Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were subjected to Western blot analyses using anti-66K antibody. As shown in Fig. 1A (lanes 1 and 2), the 66K produced in the course of viral infection appeared as a single band, consistent with previous reports (10Prod'homme D. Le Panse S. Drugeon G. Jupin I. Virology. 2001; 281: 88-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In contrast, an additional slower migrating form was detected in protoplasts transfected with pΩ-66K, resulting in the formation of a double band (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4). To test whether the change in mobility of the 66K expressed individually in plant cells was because of phosphorylation, 66K was immunoprecipitated from Arabidopsis protoplast extracts and incubated with λ phosphatase. As shown in Fig. 1B, this treatment led to the disappearance of the slower migrating 66K protein (lanes 2 and 3), while control incubation in the absence of phosphatase (lane 1) or in the presence of an inhibitor (EDTA) did not (lane 4). This demonstrates that the mobility shift of the TYMV RdRp is indeed caused by phosphorylation of the protein in plant cells. As a complementary approach, we performed in vivo metabolic labeling experiments. Arabidopsis protoplasts transfected with TYMV viral RNA or with pΩ-66K were incubated for various times in medium containing [32P]orthophosphate, and 66K was purified by immunoprecipitation. Immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1C, bottom panel) confirmed adequate expression and immunoprecipitation of 66K, whereas 32P labeling was detected by autoradiography (top panel). When expressed individually, we observed that both the upper and lower bands of the 66K were radiolabeled (Fig. 1C, lanes 3, 6, and 9). Interestingly, the 66K produced during viral infection was also radiolabeled (Fig. 1C, lanes 2, 5, and 8), although it appears as a single band with a migration similar to the nonphosphorylated form. This observation is consistent with our previous reports indicating that some phosphorylation events may not affect the electrophoretic mobility of the 66K protein (5Héricourt F. Blanc S. Redeker V. Jupin I. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 417-425PubMed Google Scholar). These metabolic labeling experiments therefore demonstrate that TYMV RdRp is produced in plant cells as a phosphoprotein not only when expressed individually but also in the context of viral infection. Furthermore, the observation that the phosphorylation status of 66K differs when expressed individually and during viral infection (as revealed by electrophoretic mobility and radiolabeling; Fig. 1, A and C) indicates that 66K phosphorylation may occur on at least two sites, the one(s) that are responsible for the phosphorylation-dependent mobility shift being inhibited during the course of viral replication (see below). Expression of 66K in in vitro cell-free translation systems revealed that, when synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL), 66K appeared as a single band of high mobility (Fig. 1D, lane 1). In contrast, the phosphorylation-dependent mobility shift was clearly observed upon expression of 66K in wheat germ (WG) extract (Fig. 1D, lane 2) indicating that 66K can be phosphorylated in vitro. To determine whether the phosphorylation pattern of 66K expressed in insect and in plant cells was similar, we compared their phosphopeptide maps. Arabidopsis protoplasts transfected with pΩ-66K were metabolically labeled in vivo, and 32P-labeled 66K was purified by immunoprecipitation. In parallel, in vivo 32P-labeled 66K produced in insect cells using a recombinant baculovirus was purified by affinity chromatography. Tryptic peptide two-dimensional analysis of the resulting phosphoproteins (Fig. 1E) revealed a complex pattern of spots, indicating that phosphorylation occurs on multiple sites both in insect and in Arabidopsis cells. Although it is obvious that some spots were specific for Arabidopsis cells, comparison of the overall phosphorylation pattern of 66K in both cell lines revealed a surprising qualitative similarity, despite the different origins of these cell types. Most importantly, 90% of the phosphate incorporated in insect cells was present in signals that were common to both cell types, indicating that apart from a few minor spots all 66K phosphopeptides detected in insect cells are also present in plant cells. This finding justified further characterization of TYMV RdRp phosphorylation target sites in the baculovirus-insect cell system, the high expression levels enabling further phosphopeptide analysis. Identification of 66K Phosphorylation Sites by Mass Spectrometry Analyses—MS is a powerful tool in the characterization of post-translational modifications of proteins, including phosphorylation (15Annan R.S.

The identification scheme used to precisely identify phosphorylated residues is presented in Fig. 2A. 32P-Labeled 66K purified by affinity chromatography from insect cells was digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were resolved by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The radioactive fractions (Fig. 2B), which contain a mixture of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated peptides, were subjected to MALDI-TOF MS analyses to characterize the peptide content of each fraction. The ions observed in the MALDI spectra were assigned to tryptic peptides derived from 66K according to their mass (as presented for HPLC fraction 59 as an example in Fig. 2C). Peaks with a mass increment of 80 Da, the mass of a single HPO3 phosphate group, were considered as candidate phosphopeptides. These peptides were further analyzed by PSD in MALDI-TOF MS (15Annan R.S. Carr S.A. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 3413-3421Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The presence of fragment ions with a mass loss of 98 Da, characteristic of dephosphorylation (-H3PO4) of the parent ion, confirmed their identification as phosphopeptides (as presented for peptide Ile316-Lys338 as an example in Fig. 2D). As summarized in Fig. 3A, the analysis of all radioactive fractions allowed the identification of the following phosphopeptides: 303DWCQEHLTHSTPK315, 316IANDYTAFDQSQHGESVVLEALK338, 53LPLHFDLPPAITPPPVSTSVDPPQAK78, 43LDTHFLPPSRLPLHFDLPPAITPPPVSTSVDPPQAK78, and 79ASPVYPGEFFDSLAAFFLPAHDPSTR104 each carrying a single phosphate moiety. The peptide Ac-ghhhhhhTPSASPTHR9, which encompasses the N-terminal His tag, was observed as both mono- and bisphosphorylated.FIGURE 3Location of 66K phosphorylation sites.

The data obtained for peptides Ile316-Lys338, Leu53-Lys78, Leu43-Lys78, and Ala79-Arg104 allowed the assignment of phosphorylation target sites to Ser326, Thr64, and Ser80 (Fig. 3A). The close proximity of the putative acceptor sites and the lack of discriminative product ions did not allow the identification of the phosphorylation site in peptide Asp303-Lys315, which would be one of the residues Thr310, Ser312, or Thr313. Neither could we assign experimentally the phosphorylation site within the N-terminal peptide. Because this peptide is specific to the His-tagged recombinant protein and has no equivalent in the virally encoded protein, its phosphorylation was not studied further.

https://openalex.org/W1980217443,"We have previously reported that cyanobacterial photosystem II (PS II) contains a protein homologous to PsbQ, the extrinsic 17-kDa protein found in higher plant and green algal PS II (Kashino, Y., Lauber, W. M., Carroll, J. A., Wang, Q., Whitmarsh, J., Satoh, K., and Pakrasi, H. B. (2002) Biochemistry 41, 8004–8012) and that it has regulatory role(s) on the water oxidation machinery (Thornton, L. E., Ohkawa, H., Roose, J. L., Kashino, Y., Keren, N., and Pakrasi, H. B. (2004) Plant Cell 16, 2164–2175). In this work, the localization and the function of PsbQ were assessed using the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. From the predicted sequence, cyanobacterial PsbQ is expected to be a lipoprotein on the luminal side of the thylakoid membrane. Indeed, experiments in this work show that upon Triton X-114 fractionation of thylakoid membranes, PsbQ partitioned in the hydrophobic phase, and trypsin digestion revealed that PsbQ was highly exposed to the luminal space of thylakoid membranes. Detailed functional assays were conducted on the psbQ deletion mutant (ΔpsbQ) to analyze its water oxidation machinery. PS II complexes purified from ΔpsbQ mutant cells had impaired oxygen evolution activity and were remarkably sensitive to NH2OH, which indicates destabilization of the water oxidation machinery. Additionally, the cytochrome c550 (PsbV) protein partially dissociated from purified ΔpsbQ PS II complexes, suggesting that PsbQ contributes to the stability of PsbV in cyanobacterial PS II. Therefore, we conclude that the major function of PsbQ is to stabilize the PsbV protein, thereby contributing to the protection of the catalytic Mn4-Ca1-Clx cluster of the water oxidation machinery.

Boekema E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1706: 12-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). This water-splitting reaction is catalyzed by an inorganic Mn4-Ca1-Clx cluster and assisted by several extrinsic proteins located on the luminal surface of PS II complex (2Seidler A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1277: 35-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The subunit composition of these extrinsic proteins differs between cyanobacterial PS II and that from higher plants and green algae. PS II of green algae and higher plants contains three luminal extrinsic proteins: PsbO (33-kDa manganese-stabilizing protein), PsbP (24-kDa protein), and PsbQ (17-kDa protein). In contrast, cyanobacterial PS II complexes contain the extrinsic proteins PsbO, PsbU (12-kDa protein), and PsbV (cytochrome c550) (2Seidler A. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochemical removal and reconstitution experiments have aided in our understanding of the roles of the plant PS II extrinsic proteins. The PsbO protein stabilizes the manganese cluster and is crucial for PS II oxygen evolution activity, whereas PsbP and PsbQ are necessary for oxygen evolution at physiological Ca2+ and Cl– concentrations (2Seidler A.

Acta. 1996; 1277: 35-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 7Ghanotakis D.F. Topper J.N. Babcock G.T. Yocum C.F. FEBS Lett. 1984; 170: 169-173Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 8Miyao M.

Together the three extrinsic proteins, PsbO, PsbP, and PsbQ, form a barrier around the manganese cluster protecting the catalytic center from small reductants, such as NH2OH (12Ghanotakis D.F. Topper J.N. Yocum C.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 767: 524-531Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The cyanobacterial extrinsic proteins PsbO, PsbU, and PsbV can be removed by high salt wash (e.g. by 1 m CaCl2, but not by 1 m NaCl) (3Shen J.-R. Ikeuchi M. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and reconstituted to PS II core complexes (4Shen J.-R. Inoue Y. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1825-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Upon removal of these proteins, the Ca2+ and/or Cl– requirements are significantly increased for optimal oxygen evolution activity in vitro (4Shen J.-R. Inoue Y. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1825-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Because the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is especially amenable to genetic manipulation, directed mutant studies have provided a large amount of functional information on the cyanobacterial PS II extrinsic proteins. Burnap and Sherman (13Burnap R.L. Sherman L.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) reported that the psbO deletion mutant (ΔpsbO) is photoautotrophic, and therefore cyanobacterial PsbO is not essential for oxygen evolution activity, unlike its plant counterpart (13Burnap R.L. Sherman L.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In a study of psbU and psbV deletion mutants (ΔpsbU and ΔpsbV, respectively), Shen et al. (14Shen J.-R. Qian M. Inoue Y. Burnap R.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1551-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) suggested that PsbU maintained the maximum affinity of PS II for Ca2+ and Cl–. Deletion of psbV resulted in significant defects in PS II function; ΔpsbV cells exhibited a slower photoautotrophic growth rate and 40% oxygen evolution activity compared with wild type (15Shen J.-R. Vermaas W. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6901-6907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). From the biochemical and genetic studies, Shen and co-workers (4Shen J.-R. Inoue Y. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1825-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 16Enami I. Yoshihara S. Tohri A. Okumura A. Ohta H. Shen J.-R.

Plant Cell Physiol. 2003; 44: 820-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) proposed that PsbU and PsbV in cyanobacteria were similar in function to PsbQ and PsbP in chloroplasts. Accordingly, an evolutionary model was described in which PsbQ and PsbP replaced PsbU and PsbV at some point during evolution from the ancestral cyanobacterium to chloroplasts (2Seidler A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1277: 35-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 17Enami I. Iwai M. Akiyama A. Suzuki T. Okumura A. Katoh T. Tada O. Ohta H. Shen J.-R.

Biochem. 2003; 270: 4156-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, this model is somewhat unsatisfactory, because no similarity in the predicted primary sequences or the crystallographic structures was found between these sets of proteins (PsbU/PsbV versus PsbP/PsbQ) (2Seidler A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1277: 35-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 19Ferreira K.N. Iverson T.M. Maghlaoui K. Barber J. Iwata S.

Subsequent to these studies, proteomic analysis of highly purified PS II complexes isolated from a HT3 strain of Synechocystis 6803 identified a novel protein homologous to chloroplast PsbQ (5Kashino Y. Lauber W.M. Carroll J.A. Wang Q. Whitmarsh J. Satoh K. Pakrasi H.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8004-8012Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Further analysis of the Synechocystis 6803 genome identified a protein homologous to PsbP (6Thornton L.E. Ohkawa H. Roose J.L. Kashino Y. Keren N. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2164-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Initial functional analyses showed that both PsbP and PsbQ have regulatory role(s) in the oxygen evolution machinery, since the deletion of the corresponding genes results in retarded growth under Ca2+- or Cl–-limited conditions (6Thornton L.E. Ohkawa H. Roose J.L. Kashino Y. Keren N. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2164-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The PsbQ protein was found to be associated with PS II complexes stoichiometrically, whereas the PsbP protein is substoichiometric in PS II (6Thornton L.E. Ohkawa H. Roose J.L. Kashino Y. Keren N. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2164-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Therefore, PS II complexes from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803 contain five associated extrinsic proteins: PsbO, PsbP, PsbQ, PsbU, and PsbV. A 20-kDa protein homologous to plant PsbQ was found in PS II complexes purified from a primitive red alga, Cyanidium caldarium, which also contains the PsbU and PsbV proteins (18Ohta H. Suzuki T. Ueno M. Okumura A. Yoshihara S. Shen J.-R. Enami I. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4156-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Careful genome analysis of cyanobacteria showed that most cyanobacterial genomes contain genes homologous to psbP and psbQ (25De Las Rivas J. Balsera M. Barber J. Trends Plant Sci. 2004; 9: 18-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), consistent with our findings for Synechocystis 6803 (5Kashino Y. Lauber W.M. Carroll J.A. Wang Q. Whitmarsh J. Satoh K. Pakrasi H.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8004-8012Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 6Thornton L.E. Ohkawa H. Roose J.L. Kashino Y. Keren N. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2164-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). These new findings challenge the proposed model that PsbP and PsbQ in plants have functionally replaced PsbU and PsbV from cyanobacteria. Indeed, recent studies of the PS II extrinsic proteins have focused on more rigorously assigning functions to each of the five extrinsic proteins in cyanobacterial PS II (26Inoue-Kashino N. Kashino Y. Satoh K. Terashima I. Pakrasi H.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12214-12228Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 27Summerfield T.C. Shand J.A. Bentley F.K. Eaton-Rye J.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 805-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The function of PsbU was reexamined, and this new analysis of ΔpsbU indicates that PsbU in cyanobacterial PS II functions to support a stable structural architecture of the water-splitting system (26Inoue-Kashino N. Kashino Y. Satoh K. Terashima I. Pakrasi H.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12214-12228Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Summerfield et al. (27Summerfield T.C. Shand J.A. Bentley F.K. Eaton-Rye J.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 805-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) extended our findings on PsbQ, showing stringent requirements for PsbQ in vivo. They reported that the ΔpsbQ mutant had impaired growth at elevated temperatures. They also combined the ΔpsbQ mutation with other PS II extrinsic protein mutations in Synechocystis 6803 (27Summerfield T.C. Shand J.A. Bentley F.K. Eaton-Rye J.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 805-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The double deletion mutant ΔpsbQΔpsbV was not able to grow photoautotrophically, whereas the ΔpsbQΔpsbO and ΔpsbQΔpsbU mutants showed exacerbated growth defects relative to the single mutants, especially in medium lacking Ca2+ and Cl–. Accordingly, they concluded that PsbQ has a role in optimizing PS II activity in Synechocystis 6803 cells, which is absolutely required under specific physiological conditions. Although these recent studies highlight a role of PsbQ in cyanobacterial PS II, the reported structural models of cyanobacterial PS II complexes from Thermosynechococcus elongatus and Thermosynechococcus vulcanus do not contain PsbQ (19Ferreira K.N. Iverson T.M. Maghlaoui K. Barber J. Iwata S. Science. 2004; 303: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (2872) Google Scholar, 23Kamiya N. Shen J.-R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Phys. 2004; 6: 4733-4736Crossref Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Thus, it is not known how PsbQ interacts with the other extrinsic proteins (PsbO, PsbU, and PsbV) nor how this may contribute to the water oxidation reaction. In this report, we specifically focus on the localization and the function of PsbQ within the water oxidation machinery of cyanobacterial PS II. Our results demonstrate that PsbQ associates with the luminal surface of PS II despite differences in its biochemical properties relative to the other extrinsic proteins, PsbO, PsbU, and PsbV. Functional analyses of the water oxidation machinery in the psbQ deletion mutant (ΔpsbQ) show significant effects on the donor side of PS II, including destabilization of PsbV in the complex and a more exposed catalytic center. From these data, we propose that the major function of PsbQ is to stabilize the PsbV protein on the luminal surface of PS II and protect the catalytic Mn4-Ca1-Clx cluster from exogenous reductants. Cyanobacterial Culture Conditions—Wild type, ΔpsbQ, and ΔpsbV (6Thornton L.E. Ohkawa H. Roose J.L. Kashino Y. Keren N. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2164-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) strains of Synechocystis 6803 were grown in normal BG 11 medium (28Allen M.M. J. Phycol. 1968; 4: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). The HT3 strain of Synechocystis 6803 and ΔpsbQHT3 mutant (6Thornton L.E. Ohkawa H. Roose J.L. Kashino Y. Keren N. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2164-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) were grown in BG 11 medium supplemented with 2 mm glucose and 50 μg/ml kanamycin (for HT3) or spectinomycin (for ΔpsbQ) at 30 °C under 50 μmol of photons m–2 s–1. HT3 strain was kindly provided by Dr. T. Bricker (29Bricker T.M. Morvant J. Masri N. Sutton H.M. Frankel L.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1409: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Isolation of Thylakoid Membranes and Purification of PS II Complexes—Thylakoid membrane and PS II complexes were isolated as described in Ref. 5Kashino Y. Lauber W.M. Carroll J.A. Wang Q. Whitmarsh J. Satoh K. Pakrasi H.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8004-8012Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar and resuspended in MMCG solution, containing 50 mm MES-NaOH (pH 6.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, and 25% glycerol. Isolation of Right Side-out and Inside-out Vesicles—To isolate thylakoid membranes containing predominantly right side-out vesicles (30Zak E. Norling B. Andersson B. Pakrasi H.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), cells in MMCG solution were broken as described in Ref. 5Kashino Y. Lauber W.M. Carroll J.A. Wang Q. Whitmarsh J. Satoh K. Pakrasi H.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8004-8012Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar and collected at 36,000 × g after the removal of unbroken cells. For the isolation of thylakoid membranes containing mostly inside-out vesicles (30Zak E. Norling B. Andersson B. Pakrasi H.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), cells suspended in 50 mm MES-NaOH (pH 6.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2 were passed through a French pressure cell twice at 100 megapascals. After removal of unbroken cells by centrifugation at 3,000 × g, the resulting vesicles were collected at 160,000 × g. Both types of vesicles were suspended in MMCG solution in the final step of preparation. No protease inhibitors were added during these isolations. The lysozyme treatment was omitted to avoid possible proteolytic degradation. Instead, the samples were thoroughly kept cool and processed quickly. Fractionation of Thylakoid Membrane—Triton X-114 phase partitioning of thylakoid membrane was performed essentially as described in Ref. 31Bricker T.M. Sherman L.A. FEBS Lett. 1982; 149: 197-202Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar at 100 μg of Chl/ml. Triton X-114 was purchased from Sigma. Protease Treatment—Stock solution of trypsin (6,750 units/ml; Sigma; pancreatic type II crude) was added to 1 ml of thylakoid membrane suspension (100 μg of Chl/ml) to 0, 34, 68, and 135 units/100 μg of Chl (equivalent to around 4 mg of protein). The mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min at pH 6.0. Note that because the pH was not optimal for trypsin activity, the digestion was performed at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by adding one-third volume of denaturing solution (20 mm EDTA, 5% lithium dodecyl sulfate, 40 mm dithiothreitol, 172 mm Tris, pH 6.8, and 0.5 m sucrose) and cooling to 0 °C. SDS-PAGE and Protein Detection—Electrophoresis and immunodetection were performed as described in Ref. 32Kashino Y. Koike H. Satoh K. Electrophoresis. 2001; 22: 1004-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, using a 18–24% gradient acrylamide, 6 m urea SDS-PAGE system. For immunodetection, PsbQ was detected using specific antisera against cyanobacterial PsbQ (6Thornton L.E. Ohkawa H. Roose J.L. Kashino Y. Keren N. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2164-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (WestPico; Pierce) on a Fujifilm LAS-1000 Plus imager (Fujifilm, Stamford, CT). The c-type heme in cytochrome c550 was also detected using WestFemto (Pierce) on a LAS-1000 Plus imager after the transfer of proteins onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Immobilon P; Millipore, Billerica, MA) (33Kashino Y. J. Chromatogr. B Anal. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2003; 797: 191-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Oxygen Evolution Assay—Steady state oxygen evolution was measured on a Clark-type electrode in the presence of 1 mmpotassium ferricyanide and 0.5 mm 2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone as electron acceptors at 2 μg of Chl/ml in MMCS buffer containing 50 mm MES-NaOH, (pH 6.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 or 20 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 m sucrose. To assess the effect of NH2OH, oxygen evolution was measured after PS II complexes (2.0 μgof Chl/ml in MMCG buffer, 20 mm CaCl2) were incubated for 1 h on ice in the dark in the presence of variable concentrations of NH2OH (34Hong S.K. Pawlikowski S.A. Vander Meulen K.A. Yocum C.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 262-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Flash oxygen yield measurements were measured using a bare platinum electrode as described in Ref. 26Inoue-Kashino N. Kashino Y. Satoh K. Terashima I. Pakrasi H.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12214-12228Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar. Fluorescence Kinetics—QA reoxidation kinetics was measured at room temperature using a double-modulation fluorometer, FL-3320 (Photon System Instruments, Brno, Czech Republic) with FluorWin software (version 3.6.3.3). The cell concentration for each sample was adjusted to OD730 = 0.08 (∼2 μg of Chl/ml) measured on a DW2000 spectrophotometer (SLM-Aminco, Urbana, IL). The samples were dark-adapted for 3 min prior to measuring. Optical Measurements—Chl a concentration was determined by the method of Porra et al. (35Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4743) Google Scholar). Cyanobacterial PsbQ Is a Luminal Protein with a Putative Lipid Anchor—We have previously postulated that PsbQ in cyanobacteria is a luminally targeted lipoprotein (6Thornton L.E. Ohkawa H. Roose J.L. Kashino Y. Keren N. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2164-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Indeed, cyanobacterial PsbQ was not removed from PS II by biochemical treatments (1 m CaCl2 or 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) that removed the other extrinsic proteins (PsbO, PsbU, and PsbV) (5Kashino Y. Lauber W.M. Carroll J.A. Wang Q. Whitmarsh J. Satoh K. Pakrasi H.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8004-8012Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). This result was quite different from the characteristics of chloroplast PsbQ, which is removed by high salt treatment (36Miyao M. Murata N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 725: 87-93Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Triton X-114 partitioning, a well established method to separate hydrophobic and hydrophilic proteins (37Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used to assess the hydrophobicity of the mature cyanobacterial PsbQ protein. Thylakoid membranes were subjected to Triton X-114 partitioning, and the proteins were fractionated into a hydrophobic fraction (Triton X-114 fraction; Fig. 1, lane 3), an aqueous fraction (lane 4), and an insoluble fraction (very hydrophilic; lane 5). Upon Coomassie staining, the separate fractions showed different polypeptide profiles. As expected, the hydrophilic phycobiliproteins partitioned into the aqueous and insoluble fractions (Fig. 1, Coomassie staining and no staining, lanes 4 and 5). Heme staining was used to detect PsbV (cytochrome c550, apparent molecular mass of 22 kDa), which fractionated into the aqueous phase (Fig. 1, heme staining, lane 4). This result is in agreement with previous reports that PsbV is removed by high salt treatment (4Shen J.-R. Inoue Y. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1825-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 5Kashino Y. Lauber W.M. Carroll J.A. Wang Q. Whitmarsh J. Satoh K. Pakrasi H.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8004-8012Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Unlike these hydrophilic proteins, PsbQ partitioned into the hydrophobic fraction (Fig. 1, PsbQ, lane 3). Although PsbQ partitioned into the hydrophobic phase (Fig. 1), this protein has no predicted hydrophobic domain and is expected to be exposed on one side of the thylakoid membrane. Right side-out and inside-out thylakoid membranes were prepared and subjected to limited digestion by trypsin to assess the topology of PsbQ (Fig. 2). PsbQ was not digested in the right side-out membrane samples but was digested in the inside-out membrane samples, similar to the digestion pattern for the luminal protein PsbV (cytochrome c550). This result demonstrates that PsbQ is located on the luminal side of thylakoid membrane. Altogether, the data from the Triton X-114 partitioning and the trypsin digestion experiments are consistent with the previous prediction that PsbQ is targeted to the thylakoid lumen and cleaved by signal peptidase II to yield an N-terminal cysteine, which is modified with a lipid anchor (6Thornton L.E. Ohkawa H. Roose J.L. Kashino Y. Keren N. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2164-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The PsbV Protein Partially Dissociates from ΔpsbQHT3 PS II Complexes—The polypeptide profiles of HT3 and ΔpsbQHT3 PS II complexes are shown in Fig. 3. As expected, the PsbQ protein is absent from the ΔpsbQHT3 PS II complexes. Also, PsbV was partially lost in ΔpsbQHT3 PS II, indicating that, in the absence of PsbQ, the structure of the water oxidation machinery becomes labile. The fact that PsbV, a luminal PS II protein, is affected by the absence of PsbQ is also consistent with the luminal localization of PsbQ determined during the preceding experiments. The ΔpsbQ Mutant Has Defects in PS II Water Oxidation—To address the contribution of PsbQ to the water oxidation process, fluorescence kinetics measurements were performed using cells grown in normal BG11. Because PsbV became labile in PS II upon the absence of PsbQ, the ΔpsbV mutant was also assayed for comparison. For samples at the same chlorophyll concentration, the Fo value for ΔpsbQ cells was essentially the same as that of wild type cells (0.735 ± 0.0802 versus 0.715 ± 0.0805; S.D., n = 5–6). This is consistent with previous data showing no significant difference in the relative amounts of PS II between wild type and ΔpsbQ cells (6Thornton L.E. Ohkawa H. Roose J.L. Kashino Y. Keren N. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2164-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Whereas the Fo value of ΔpsbV cells is significantly increased relative to wild type (1.08 ± 0.136; S.D., n = 5–6), indicating an increase in impaired PS II complexes. The normalized variable fluorescence yield in ΔpsbQ was also comparable with that in wild type (0.742 ± 0.0864 versus 0.694 ± 0.0379; S.D., n = 5–6), whereas that of ΔpsbV was much lower (0.307 ± 0.121; S.D., n = 5–6). The fluorescence decay kinetics for cells after a single saturating flash, which represents the reoxidation kinetics of Q–A in PS II, are shown in Fig. 4. Qualitatively, the ΔpsbQ mutant has a decay curve intermediate to that of wild type and the ΔpsbV mutant. To quantitatively compare the fluorescence decay curves for all strains, they were fit with three components of different decay half-times (Table 1). The first phase reports on the electron transfer from QA to QB (38Bowes J.M. Crofts A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 590: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 39Haumann M. Junge W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 40Yamasaki T. Yamakawa T. Yamane Y. Koike H. Satoh K. Katoh S. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The second phase represents the turnover of plastoquinone molecules at the QB site (41Cao J. Govindjee Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1015: 180-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The last component with the longest half-time is the oxidation of QA by PS I (42Bukhov N.G. Mohanty P. Rakhimberdieva M.G. Karapetyan N.V. Planta. 1992; 187: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the decay half-time of the fastest component in ΔpsbQ was 20% faster than that in wild type; furthermore, the relative amounts of each component in ΔpsbQ differed from those in wild type. This result is consistent with that observed in the ΔpsbV muta"
https://openalex.org/W89327308,"In contrast to the thoroughness with which the respiratory enzymes of such tissues as heart muscle and liver have been studied, information concerning these enzymes in the adrenal gland is scant. Such information as is available suggests that an unusual pattern for the cytochromes exists in this tissue. Cohen and Elvehjem (2) commented on the peculiar cytochrome spectrumof the adrenal medulla of the cow. They concluded that a very strong cytochrome c component was present, and that cytochrome a and 6 were absent. Huszak (3) noted that the adrenal cortex possessed a nearly normal cytochrome pattern. In the medulla he could observe no cytochrome a or c bands, but reported a strong band in the region of 559 rnp which he attributed to cytochrome 5. Since Huszak could demonstrate no cytochrome oxidase activity in the medulla, he felt that oxidation of substrates proceeded by way of a peroxidative mechanism. Tsou (4), on the other hand, was able to demonstrate cytochrome oxidase activity in the medulla, but little if any cytochrome c. He observed the presence of a strong band at 561 millimicron which was referred to as cytochrome b. In view of these divergent conclusions and in the light of newer methods and knowledge, it seemed worth-while to reinvestigate some of the oxidative pathways in the adrenal gland. The present study deals with the adrenal medulla, and an accompanying paper deals with the cortex (5). It will be shown here that the adrenal medulla contains the regular mitochondrial cytochrome system. In addition, this tissue contains a hemochromogen which is apparently microsomal in origin and is abundantly present in the epinephrine-containing granules. The presence in the medulla of the enzymes succinate dehydrogenase,reduced di- and triphosphopyridine nucleotide-cytochrome c reductase,and transhydrogenase is also demonstrated."

The stable association of Sir3 with Sir4 is mediated by a C-terminal region of Sir3 that has additional functions including the dimerization of Sir3. We have developed a simple, robust expression screening methodology that allows for the unbiased identification of functional protein domains expressed from nested-deletion libraries of full-length genes. Using these methodologies, Sir3 dimerization was shown to be mediated by two separate domains. One of these domains also binds cooperatively to the C-terminal coiled-coil motif of Sir4 and dimerization further increases the affinity of Sir3 for Sir4. The resulting Sir3-Sir4 complexes form progressively higher order assemblies with increasing protein concentration, with implications for the mechanism of gene silencing.

The interaction of Sir3 with Sir4 is an essential feature of the gene silencing mechanism. This protein-protein interaction stabilizes Sir protein complexes on the silencer element, a prerequisite for the spreading of Sir proteins to establish silent DNA. The C-terminal regions of both Sir3 and Sir4 participate in their physical and functional interactions (Fig. 1A) (11.Moazed D. Kistler A. Axelrod A. Rine J. Johnson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We and others have reported crystal structures of the Sir4 coiled-coil (Sir4-CC; residues 1271–1346) (26.Murphy G.A. Spedale E.J. Powell S.T. Pillus L. Schultz S.C. Chen L. J. Mol.

Structure. 2003; 11: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Guided by the structure, we showed that a small patch of surface residues located in the middle of the Sir4-CC mediates the interaction with Sir3 (27.Chang J.F. Hall B.E. Tanny J.C. Moazed D. Filman D. Ellenberger T.E. Structure. 2003; 11: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of Sir3 is required for interactions with Sir4 in vitro (summarized in Fig. 1A) and for silencing activity in vivo (11.Moazed D. Kistler A. Axelrod A. Rine J. Johnson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2186-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 12.Moretti P. Freeman K. Coodly L. Shore D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2257-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). N-terminal deletions of Sir3 beyond amino acid 522 prevent interaction with immobilized Sir4-CC, whereas slightly longer Sir3 constructs are pulled down efficiently (27.Chang J.F. Hall B.E. Tanny J.C. Moazed D. Filman D. Ellenberger T.E. Structure. 2003; 11: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, the Sir3 C-terminal region also participates in interactions with histones H3 and H4 and mediates Sir3 dimerization (12.Moretti P. Freeman K. Coodly L. Shore D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2257-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 17.Hecht A. Laroche T. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gasser S.M. Grunstein M.

We sought to identify the residues that are responsible for these different functions of Sir3, to assess the role of each interaction in DNA silencing. The histone deacetylase Sir2 forms specific complexes with both Sir3 and Sir4. These physical interactions serve to co-localize the Sir proteins to regions of silent DNA and to regulate histone modifications affecting chromatin structure and accessibility. Crystal structures of several archaeal Sir2 homologs and the human SIRT2 protein have been reported, alone and in complexes with the NAD+ cofactor or an acetyl-lysine substrate peptide (29.Avalos J.L. Celic I. Muhammad S. Cosgrove M.S. Boeke J.D. Wolberger C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 30.Zhao K. Chai X. Marmorstein R.

Biol. 2001; 8: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The structures show a conserved Rossman-type nucleotide-binding fold and are suggestive of a mechanism for enzymatic deacetylation. In contrast, there has been little progress on the structural biology of higher order Sir protein complexes. The stoichiometry and molecular interactions of Sir3 and Sir4 within silencing complexes are unknown. There is evidence that the subunit makeup of Sir3-Sir4 protein complexes can be altered by the products of Sir2 deacetylation, O-acetyl-ADP-ribose and deacetylated histones (33.Liou G.-G. Tanny J.C. Kruger R.G. Walz T. Moazed D. Cell. 2005; 121: 515-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Consistent with this variability, the overexpression of Sir3 in vivo results in silent DNA with abundant Sir3 but reduced amounts of Sir2 and Sir4 (34.Strahl-Bolsinger S. Hecht A. Luo K. Grunstein M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Current models for the assembly of Sir proteins on chromatin do not account for this apparent plasticity in subunit composition. Biochemical and structural studies of Sir3 (978 residues) and Sir4 (1358 residues) have been hampered by the large size and limited solubility of these proteins as well as the lack of homologous proteins that might otherwise reveal the important conserved features. As such, it has been difficult to divide the Sir proteins into functional domains that can be studied in isolation. After failing to obtain well diffracting crystals of Sir3 alone or in complex with the Sir4-CC, we developed an unbiased methodology to identify Sir3 fragments that stably interact with Sir4, as a prelude to thermodynamic and structural studies of these protein-protein interactions. Here we describe the application of these methods to Sir3, and the identification of two protein interaction domains mediating Sir3 dimerization and its interaction with the Sir4-CC. Identification of Functional Protein Domains from a Nested Deletion Expression Library: Methodology and Biases—We wished to create a large and unbiased library expressing random Sir3 protein fragments. We examined several methods to create nested gene deletions and compared a series of reporter vectors to select in-frame fragments from the library. A variety of endonucleases and exonucleases have been used to generate nested deletion libraries (35.Ostermeier M. Nixon A.E. Shim J.H. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3562-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, the extent of these reactions can be difficult to control, leading to incomplete representation of coding sequences in a library. To more completely sample a large number of overlapping gene fragments with randomly distributed 5′ and 3′ termini, we used mung bean nuclease to create nested gene deletions (Fig. 1B). Mung bean nuclease is commonly used to remove protruding 3′ termini of double-stranded DNA. Although it is highly specific for single-stranded DNA (selectivity of 30,000:1 for single-stranded DNA: double-stranded DNA), this enzyme endonucleolytically cleaves double-stranded DNA at high enzyme concentrations and extended incubation periods (36.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). By exploiting the slow activity of mung bean nuclease on double-stranded DNA, nested gene deletions can be generated that finely sample a large number of 5′ and 3′ end points (Fig. 1). pT7CF Expression Vector and Screening Modifications—From a large array of random DNA fragments, we sought a method for selecting coding sequences in the correct reading frame that could be expressed in Escherichia coli and subsequently screened for various functions. We devised an expression vector for random gene fragments fused to E. coli type I chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), which serves as a convenient reporter group for expression screening of nested deletion libraries (Fig. 1B) (37.Maxwell K.L. Mittermaier A.K. Forman-Kay J.D. Davidson A.R. J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1908-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In our pT7CF expression vector, random coding sequences appended with an appropriate adaptor (see below) are cloned into an engineered MluI restriction site flanked on the 5′ side by a His6 affinity tag sequence and on the 3′ side by the coding sequence for full-length CAT (Fig. 1B). The CAT coding sequence (residues 1–219) from pPROEX HT-CAT (Invitrogen) was amplified by PCR to contain an MluI restriction site (ACGCGT) immediately 5′ of the start codon and a stop codon inserted after residue 219. The amplified CAT gene was cloned into the pCRT7/NT-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) to create the pT7CF (T7-promoter CAT Fusion) vector that appends an N-terminal His6 affinity tag to the expressed proteins. Following affinity purification, the His6 tag can be removed by cleavage with enterokinase. pT7CF was digested with MluI and gel purified before ligating a phosphorylated 9-mer linker (5′-PO4-CGCGGTTTG-3′) to the ends of the cut vector. The linker was present in a 1,000-fold molar excess over pT7CF in the ligation reaction with T4 DNA ligase done overnight at 16 °C. After addition of linkers, the pT7CF vector was purified by gel electrophoresis in 1% agarose to remove unligated oligos and any recircularized vector. Preparation of a SIR3-nested Deletion Library and Selection for In-frame SIR3 Coding Sequences—The full-length SIR3 gene was amplified by PCR and 3 μg of the amplified DNA was digested with mung bean nuclease (10–50 units; New England Biolabs) for 3–16 h at 30 °C. The nuclease was inactivated with 0.1% SDS and the DNA was exchanged into 30 μl of 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.5) using a QIAquick spin column (Qiagen). Five μl of the nuclease reaction mixture was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm the extent of the digestion (supplemental Fig. S1A), and the remainder of the library was incubated with T4 DNA polymerase (1 unit of T4 polymerase/μgof DNA, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 100 μm each of 4 dNTPs) at 12 °C for 15 min to blunt end the DNA. T4 DNA polymerase was inactivated by adding 1 μl of 0.5 m EDTA and heating the sample at 75 °C for 20 min. The mixture of insert DNAs was then exchanged into 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.5) using a spin column (Qiagen). A double-stranded adaptor sequence with a 5-bp long 3′ overhang was ligated to the blunt-ended DNA inserts prior to cloning into pT7CF (supplemental Fig. S1B). The adaptors consist of the following 5′-phosphorylated oligonucleotides: 13-mer, 5′-PO4-TCCGTCACCAAAC-3′, and 8-mer, 5′-PO4-GTGACGGA-3′. The DNA strands were annealed by heating at 50 °C for 10 min then slowly cooling to room temperature and incubating at 16 °C overnight before aliquoting and storing frozen (–80 °C) until use. Adaptors were appended to the blunt-ended inserts by incubating with T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) at 16 °C overnight in the presence of a 40-fold molar excess of adaptor DNA. T4 DNA polymerase was heat-inactivated and the ligation mixture was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis to remove excess unligated adaptors and trivial SIR3 fragments. Following electrophoresis, a block of agarose containing a smear of DNA fragments ranging in length from 500 to 2900 bp (the full-length SIR3 gene) was cut out and then embedded in another agarose gel and refocused into a discrete band by reversing the polarity of electrophoresis. The resulting DNA band was cut out and extracted into 30 μl in 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.5) (Qiagen). This selection of inserts with a defined size proved crucial for the elimination of trivial gene fragments, enriching the library for the expression of polypeptides capable of folding into stable, functional domains (typically 100–300 amino acids in length). The library was constructed by ligating the adapted DNA inserts into 25 ng of the linkered pT7CF vector overnight at 16 °C using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs). T4 DNA ligase was inactivated at 65 °C (10 min) and the ligation mixture was precipitated with ethanol in the presence of glycogen carrier. The DNA pellet was subsequently taken up in 5 μl of sterile distilled water, transformed into 50 μl of electrocompetent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, and the cells were recovered in 250 μl of SOC for 1 h. The entire ligation mixture was then plated on 245-mm square (Corning) LB agar plates containing 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol (Cam), and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The use of complementary linker and adaptor sequences prevented self-ligation of the pT7CF vector, enriching the library for recombinant clones, and greatly enhancing the effectiveness of downstream functional assays. Library Expression and CAT Toxicity—Gene expression in pT7CF is under the control of a T7 promoter that is compatible with the commonly used E. coli expression host BL21(DE3) (36.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Transformed cells can be grown either on Cam to select for the expression of functional CAT fusion proteins or on ampicillin to recover all transformants containing pT7CF. We initially intended to use the fused CAT reporter group to select for clones expressing highly soluble proteins that confer resistance to chloramphenicol. However, cells transformed with the parental pT7CF vector had an extremely low plating efficiency on media containing the inducer of protein expression, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG), suggesting that overexpression of CAT is toxic to the cells. The transformed cells survived best under basal expression conditions without IPTG (supplemental Fig. S2A). Similar evidence of toxicity associated with high level CAT expression was obtained during growth in liquid media containing IPTG and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol (Fig. S2A, inset). Further tests confirmed that high levels of soluble CAT are expressed under inducing conditions at 37 °C. The amount of basal or “leaky” expression is also considerable, and only 3-fold less than the induced levels of CAT expression. It is unknown why this modest increase in intracellular CAT levels is strongly toxic to E. coli, and this finding was not reported in earlier studies (37.Maxwell K.L. Mittermaier A.K. Forman-Kay J.D. Davidson A.R. J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1908-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 38.Sieber V. Martinez C.A. Arnold F.H. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 456-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Importantly, the resulting transformation efficiency of the pT7CF vector was opposite to our expectations: basal expression of CAT conferred resistance to Cam, whereas higher levels of CAT expression caused a precipitous decrease in the number of transformants. Correlation of Protein Solubility with Cam Resistance—To determine whether similar growth behavior was observed for CAT fusion proteins, we cloned genes for 2 proteins of known solubility into pT7CF upstream of CAT. The human homologue of Rad23, hHR23B (409 amino acids), is wholly soluble when overexpressed in BL21(DE3). Conversely, λ-integrase (356 amino acids) is completely insoluble when expressed in E. coli (not shown). Again, no recombinants survived growth in the presence of IPTG. Under basal expression conditions, only the cells expressing the soluble hHR23B-CAT fusion survived, albeit at low levels of Cam (25 μg/ml, supplemental Fig. S2B). The insoluble λ-integrase-CAT fusion failed to confer resistance to Cam. Further tests showed that both proteins fused to CAT were expressed at significantly lower basal levels than the CAT protein alone. However, fusion to CAT did not alter the solubility of either hHR23B (fully soluble) or λ-integrase (completely insoluble). Unlike the CAT fusion vector created by Davidson and co-workers (pCFN1) (37.Maxwell K.L. Mittermaier A.K. Forman-Kay J.D. Davidson A.R. J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1908-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), which saw survival of soluble fusions up to 400 μg/ml Cam, the stringency of our selection was higher, with cells expressing soluble hHR23B-CAT fusion only showing limited survival up to 50 μg/ml Cam. In contrast, cells expressing the insoluble λ-integrase-CAT do not survive with or without IPTG, even at limiting concentrations of Cam. Addition of IPTG caused a 3–5-fold increase in expression of these CAT fusion proteins and was toxic to the cells (supplemental Fig. S2B). However, under basal expression levels we could exploit this stringent Cam selection to eliminate insoluble/out of frame fusion proteins from the library (see “Results”). Screening for Sir3 Domains That Interact with Sir4-CC—The GST-Sir4-CC bait protein and a point mutant (GST-Sir4-CC(M1307N)) that fails to bind Sir3 were overexpressed in E. coli and purified separately (27.Chang J.F. Hall B.E. Tanny J.C. Moazed D. Filman D. Ellenberger T.E. Structure. 2003; 11: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The purified proteins were stored at –80 °C in 20 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 350 mm NaCl, 15 mm glutathione, 5 mm DTT and glycerol. For the pulldown assays, the proteins were exchanged into 50 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 500 mm KCl, and 2.5 mm DTT. GST-Sir4-CC (100 μl of 10 μg/ml) was bound to the wells of a 96-well glutathione-derivatized assay plate (BD Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C with agitation on a rotating platform. The protein solution was then decanted and the plates were used immediately for the pulldown assay. Sir3-CAT library transformants surviving Cam selection were chosen at random and grown at 37 °C with agitation in 96-well deep well blocks containing 1.5 ml of LB with 20 μg/ml Cam. The CAT fusion proteins were expressed for 2 h with 1 mm IPTG. The cells were pelleted at 3,000 × g and the cell pellets were frozen at –80 °C. The plates were thawed at room temperature for 5 min and the cell lysates were resuspended in 200 μl of cold (4 °C) Lysis Buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 500 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mg/ml PMSF). Twenty μl of lysozyme (200 μg/ml) and 0.1% Triton X-100 were added to lyse the cells by shaking (300 rpm on a rotating platform) at 4 °C for 30 min. The lysate was treated with 20 μl of 0.5 μg/ml DNase I in 900 mm MgSO4 and 100 mm MnCl2 and shaken for 30 min more. Insoluble material was pelleted at 7,300 × g for 30 min and the supernatant was transferred to a new 96-well plate. Prior to the pulldown assay, the total protein concentrations of cell lysates expressing Sir3-CAT fusion proteins were measured by a Bradford assay. The working concentration of each lysate was normalized by diluting ∼4-fold into buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 500 mm KCl, 5% (w/v) milk, and 0.05% Tween 20, to achieve concentrations within a 1.5-fold range of the mean value. Alternatively, the amounts of CAT activity in the lysates could be measured with a colorimetric assay based on 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) reduction (39.Shaw W.V. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 43: 737-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). One hundred μl each of the diluted cell lysates containing Sir3-CAT fusion proteins (∼100 μg/ml of total protein concentration) were incubated with immobilized GST-Sir4-CC in 96-well plates (see above) that were rotated (200 rpm) at 4 °C for 1 h. After the binding reaction, the plates were washed five times (250 μl/well) with 50 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 500 mm KCl, and 0.05% Tween 20, and the bound Sir3-CAT fusion proteins were eluted by washing the plates with 200 μl of 50 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 500 mm KCl, 15 mm glutathione, and 1 mm DTT for 30 min. The eluates were blotted onto nitrocellulose using a vacuum manifold (slot-blot apparatus; Bio-Rad). The membrane was then blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline at room temperature for 30 min. The bound proteins were treated with anti-CAT antibody derivatized with digoxigenin (Roche) for 2 h at 25 °C in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% milk and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. The plates were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20, incubated for 45 min with anti-digoxigenin antibody derivatized with peroxidase (Roche), and washed two more times. A final wash without detergent was followed by addition of diaminobenzidine to visualize the antibody-bound proteins. Directed Subcloning, Expression, and Purification of N-terminal-truncated Sir3 Proteins—Sir3-(464–978) and Sir3-(464–728) were expressed with C-terminal His6 tags using pET24a (Novagen). BL21(DE3) cells were grown to mid-log phase at 37 °C, chilled on ice, then protein expression was induced with 1 mm IPTG by incubation overnight at 16 °C. The cells in growth medium were pelleted and resuspended in Lysis Buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 500 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm PMSF then lysed with a pneumatic cell disrupter (Avestin Inc.). Insoluble material was pelleted at 30,000 × g for 30 min and the lysate was bound to nickel-NTA-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed once with cell Lysis Buffer and the bound protein was eluted in Lysis Buffer plus 250 mm imidazole. The eluted protein was subsequently diluted 5 times in Dilution Buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mm DTT), and any precipitate was pelleted at 30,000 × g and the resulting supernatant was filtered. The clarified sample in low salt buffer was loaded onto a SP-Sepharose ion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a gradient of 100–500 mm KCl in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mm DTT. Pooled fractions containing Sir3 were concentrated (3 ml) and loaded onto a Superdex 200 gel filtration column. The eluted protein was concentrated to 10 mg/ml in S200 Buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 500 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mm EDTA). Sir3 was divided into aliquots, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C prior to use. Thioredoxin fused to Sir3-(464–572) with a C-terminal His6 tag was expressed from pET32a (Novagen) using BL21(DE3) cells grown to log phase at 37 °C before chilling on ice and inducing protein expression overnight at 16 °C with 1 mm IPTG. The thioredoxin-Sir3 fusion protein was purified using the same scheme described above, except that Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) ion exchange chromatography was substituted for the SP-Sepharose step.

However, peroxidases are irreversibly inactivated by their substrate, hydrogen peroxide. The oxidative inactivation of hemeproteins is mechanism based and arises as the consequence of unproductive electron abstraction reactions. Protein elements, such as the porphyrin ring or the protein backbone, act as simultaneous and competing electron sources even in the presence of exogenous reducing substrates, leading to a decline in activity. It is hypothetically possible to alter the intramolecular electron transfer pathways by direct replacement of low redox potential residues around the active site; as a consequence, the inactivation process would be delayed or even suppressed. To demonstrate this hypothesis, a redox-inspired strategy was implemented until an iso-1-cytochrome c variant fully stable at catalytic concentrations of hydrogen peroxide was obtained. This variant, harboring the N52I,W59F,Y67F,K79A,F82G substitutions, preserved the catalytic performance of the parental protein but achieved a 15-fold higher total-turnover number. The phenotype of this variant was reflected in the stability of its electronic components, allowing identification of a protein-based radical intermediate mechanistically similar to Compound I of classical peroxidases. The results presented here clearly demonstrate that redox-inspired protein engineering is a useful tool for the rational modulation of intramolecular electron transfer networks."

Here, we report that the Schizosaccharomyces pombe fission yeast Mcm10 protein contains primase activity. Primases are enzymes that synthesize RNA primers on single-stranded DNA templates that are extended by DNA polymerases. In keeping with this property, Mcm10p supported oligoribonucleotide synthesis of short RNA primers (preferentially initiating synthesis on a dT template) that were extended with dATP by Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. The C terminus of Mcm10p synthesized RNA, but less efficiently than the full-length protein at low rNTP levels. Mcm10p homologs contain a C-terminal motif found in proteins that polymerize nucleotides. A point mutant within this motif of S. pombe Mcm10p was defective in primer synthesis in vitro, and this mutant failed to support growth in vivo, suggesting that the primase activity of Mcm10p may be essential for cell viability.

DNA replication occurs through a complex series of reactions that are mechanistically coordinated at the replication fork. Studies of model DNA replication systems indicate that origin recognition by an initiator protein permits assembly and activation of the replicative helicase at the origin. Helicases unwind duplex DNA to generate a single-strand template on which primases can initiate synthesis of RNA primers that are 4-20 nucleotides in length and that are extended by DNA polymerases to make Okazaki fragments (1Frick D.N. Richardson C.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 39-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Primases are physically coupled to the replicative DNA helicases and DNA polymerases, which translocate together through the duplex, resulting in DNA unwinding coincident with synthesis of RNA primers and their extension with deoxynucleotides. In eukaryotes, the Mcm proteins are essential replication factors that were identified as proteins required for minichromosomal maintenance in a genetic screen for mutants defective in initiation of replication (2Tye B.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 649-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Six of these members are sequence-related proteins, Mcm2-7, which interact to form a hexameric complex. Although a substantial body of data suggests that the Mcm2-7p complex acts as the replicative helicase (3Blow J.J. Dutta A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 476-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), helicase activity has been detected only in the Mcm4-6-7 subcomplex (4Ishimi Y. Komamura Y. You Z. Kimura H. J. Biol.

A. 2001; 98: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Prior to the initiation of replication, the Mcm2-7 complex associates with the initiator at replication origins. At the G1/S transition, both S phase cyclin-dependent kinase and Cdc7p-Dbf4p kinase activities rise, promoting the maturation of the pre-replicative complex to the preinitiation complex (7Zou L. Stillman B. Science. 1998; 280: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the chromatin-bound Mcm2-7 complex by the Cdc7-Dbf4 kinase (8Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Young M.R. Kihara M. Sugino A. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3365-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) is thought to trigger the binding of Mcm10p, Cdc45p, and the GINS complex with origins prior to the initiation of replication (9Kanemaki M.

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1153-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Although Mcm10p was identified in the same genetic screen as the Mcm2-7 proteins, their amino acid sequences are unrelated. Studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Drosophila melanogaster, and Xenopus laevis indicate that Mcm10p is an essential conserved replication component. Mutations in mcm10 result in a marked reduction in the initiation of replication as well as a delay in S phase after hydroxyurea arrest, suggesting that Mcm10p is involved in initiation as well as elongation steps of replication (11Nasmyth K.

Previously, we reported that, in vitro, S. pombe Mcm10p (amino acids 1-593; SpMcm10p) binds preferentially to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and to the large subunit of the pol α-primase complex and activates its DNA synthetic activity (25Fien K.

In addition, we found that Mcm10p facilitates the binding of the pol α-primase complex to primed DNA and forms a stable ternary complex, suggesting that Mcm10p recruits the pol α-primase complex to template DNA. In keeping with these in vitro findings, Mcm10p was shown recently to stabilize the large subunit of the pol α-primase complex in S. cerevisiae (15Ricke R. Bielinsky A.-K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 173-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) as well as the chromatin association of the pol α-primase complex in S. pombe (26Yang X. Gregan J. Lindner K. Young H. Kearsey S.E. BMC Mol. Biol. 2005; 6: 13Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that full-length SpMcm10p (amino acids 1-593) and its C-terminal fragment (amino acids 416-593) contain primase activity that catalyzes the synthesis of oligoribonucleotides that are extended by Escherichia coli pol I. Primase activity both co-sedimented and co-eluted with these full-length and truncated proteins, although their hydrodynamic properties differ significantly. The C-terminal domain of Mcm10p (and its homologs in other organisms) contains conserved acidic residues characteristic of proteins that polymerize nucleotides (the nucleotide transfer domain (NTD)) (27Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1609-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). A single amino acid substitution in one of these residues in full-length Mcm10p greatly reduced its primase activity (>10-fold). Further analysis of single amino acid substitutions of these conserved acidic residues suggests that they are essential for viability in yeast. Preparation of Mcm10 Proteins—Mcm10 proteins were overproduced in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)RIL containing various pET28a-MCM10 expression plasmids. Construction of plasmids, growth and lysis of cells, and purification of proteins by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity were as described (25Fien K. Cho Y.-S. Lee J.-K. Raychaudhuri S. Tappin I. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16144-16153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) with the following exceptions. To obtain higher yields of protein, cells were grown in medium (4 liter) containing 100 ml of 10× M9 medium (10 g/liter NH4Cl, 30 g/liter KH2PO4, and 60 g/liter Na2HPO4), 200 ml of 5× medium (50 g/liter Tryptone, 25 g/liter yeast extract, and 25 g/liter NaCl), 20 ml of 20% glucose, 1 ml of 1 m MgSO4, and 40 μg/ml each kanamycin and chloramphenicol. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min; the supernatant was adjusted to 50% saturation with (NH4)2SO4; and the suspension was stirred for 20 min at 4 °C. The precipitate was collected at 18,000 rpm for 60 min and dissolved in lysate buffer. Mcm10p was bound to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads, and the imidazole eluate was adjusted to 250 mm NaCl with Buffer A (25 mm MES-KOH (pH 6.5), 5% glycerol, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm ZnSO4, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). This material was loaded onto a 1-ml Mono S HR 5/50 column equilibrated with Buffer A containing 200 mm NaCl and eluted with a 6-ml gradient of 200-800 mm NaCl. Mcm10p eluted between ∼400 and 500 mm NaCl (yield of 2.0 mg of protein). A portion of the purified Mono S fraction (0.40 mg) (see Fig. 1A, lane 1) was used for subsequent analysis. Mcm10p-(1-303) and Mcm10p-(416-593) were purified similarly, except that Mcm10p-(416-593) was isolated using a 1-ml Mono Q HR 5/50 column in place of the Mono S column. The yields of protein were 0.5 and 1 mg from 2 liter of medium, respectively. Primase Assay of Oligoribonucleotide Synthesis—Primase activity was determined by measuring the amount of oligoribonucleotide synthesized in the presence of a DNA template. Standard reaction mixtures (10 μl) contained 1.0 μm (dT)50, 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm ATP, 25 μCi of [α-32P]ATP, and various levels of full-length Mcm10p or truncated derivatives. Reaction mixtures containing either 1.0 μm (dC)50 or 0.2 pmol of M13mp18 ssDNA were similar to those described for (dT)50, except that they contained either 0.1 mm GTP and 25 μCi of [α-32P]GTP or 0.1 mm each ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP and 25 μCi of [α-32P]ATP, respectively. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 40 min unless specified otherwise. The reactions in Fig. 4 were stopped at the times indicated by heat inactivation at 95 °C for 5 min and chilled on ice. Calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (1 unit) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 3 μl of sequencing dye (98% formamide, 10 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue), heated to 98 °C for 5 min, and separated on a 25% denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gel containing 7 m urea. Labeled oligoribonucleotide products were visualized using a Fuji BAS 1000 bioimaging analyzer and quantitated from a phosphorimage of the gel. Primer-dependent DNA Synthesis Assay—Oligoribonucleotides synthesized by full-length Mcm10p, Mcm10p-(416-593), or Mcm10p-(1-303) were assayed by measuring their ability to serve as primers for the E. coli pol I large fragment (Klenow). The conditions used were the same as those described for the primase-catalyzed oligoribonucleotide synthesis assay, except for the following additions: 0.1 mm dATP, 0.08 unit of Klenow fragment, 1.5 μCi of [α-32P]dATP in place of radiolabeled ATP, and 0.1 μm (dT)300 in place of (dT)50. The longer dT template supported ∼10 times more dAMP incorporation than the shorter template. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 40 min at 37 °C, after which half of the reaction mixture was mixed with 10 μl of alkaline loading dye (0.5 m NaOH, 7mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.5% Ficoll, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue), and DNA products were separated on 2% alkaline agarose gels. The amount of nucleotide incorporated into DNA was measured as described (25Fien K. Cho Y.-S. Lee J.-K. Raychaudhuri S. Tappin I. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16144-16153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) or by using a phosphorimage of the gel. Computer-assisted Analysis of Amino Acid Sequences—The data used in this study were from the NCBI Database; the protein sets were encoded in publicly available completely sequenced genomes. Initially, we used P-BLAST to identify Mcm10p amino acid sequences from different organisms with blast hits above a certain expectation value (e-value). Eleven full-length Mcm10p amino acid sequences from different divergent organisms found by the BLAST search were then aligned using the ClustalW program. This program produces biologically meaningful multiple sequence alignments of divergent sequences. The ClustalW program allows putative motifs to be identified because of the calculated best match for a large group of related selected sequences and lines them up so that the identities, similarities, and differences can be seen. The following is a list of the Mcm10 protein sequences used in the alignment and their accession numbers: X. laevis (frog) Mcm10p (AAG33858), Homo sapiens MCM10 (BAB18723), S. cerevisiae (budding yeast) Mcm10p (CAA86128), S. pombe (fission yeast) Mcm10p (BAA24935), Rattus norvegicus (rat) MCM10 (XP_225570), D. melanogaster (fly) MCM10 (AAF53976), Neurospora crassa (bread mold) Mcm10-like protein (EAA31137), Mus musculus (mouse) MCM10 (NP_081566), Caenorhabditis elegans (worm) MCM10-like protein (CAB57900), Anopheles gambiae (malaria mosquito) Mcm10-like protein (EAA10289), and Plasmodium yoelii yoelii (rodent malaria) Mcm10-like protein (EAA17050). Construction of Mcm10p Point Mutations—The MCM10 shuffle strain used in this study was ILY251 (MATa leu2-3,112, ura3-52, mcm10::hisG (pRS315-MCM10-URA3)) (a gift from Bik Tye), and the wild-type S. cerevisiae Mcm10p strain used was JPY9 (MATa his3-D200, ura3-52, leu2-D1, trp1D63, gal4D11). Plasmids pET-Mcm10p(E586A), pET-Mcm10p(D587A), and pET-Mcm10p(D588A), expressing Mcm10p containing Ala in place of Glu at position 586 or in place of Asp at position 587 or 588, respectively, were constructed by PCR mutagenesis of the pET28a-MCM10 plasmid. The presence of the mutated site was screened by restriction digestion with BstUI and by sequencing to verify specific changes. Mutated plasmids were digested either with NdeI and NotI or with BamHI and XhoI, and 1.7-kb fragments were cloned either into the yeast-E. coli shuttle vector pRSSGS415 (LEU2) containing the SGS1 promoter (a gift from Steve Brill) and digested with NdeI and NotI or into the vector pRSADH425 (LEU2) containing the strong alcohol dehydrogenase promoter and digested with BamHI and XhoI. Both shuttle vectors expressing mutant and SpMcm10p were examined in the plasmid shuffle assay. Mcm10p Catalyzes Template-dependent Synthesis of Oligoribonucleotides—We examined whether SpMcm10p and its N- and C-terminally truncated derivatives, Mcm10p-(1-303) and Mcm10p (416-597), catalyze template-dependent oligoribonucleotide synthesis. The purity of these preparations, which were expressed in E. coli and purified, is shown in Fig. 1A (lanes 1-3). These protein preparations were screened for their ability to synthesize small oligoribonucleotides using [α-32P]ATP and single-stranded (dT)50 as the template. In the presence of ATP (100 μm), (dT)50, and full-length SpMcm10p, RNA products 4-18 nucleotides in length were produced (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6). In the absence of an ssDNA template or in the presence of a low level of ATP (0.01 μm), oligoribonucleotide synthesis was not observed (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3 and lanes 8 and 9, respectively). Quantitation of the amount of RNA formed indicated that the purified SpMcm10p supported incorporation of 0.3 pmol of AMP/min/pmol of protein at 37 °C. This level of activity is comparable with that observed with the phage T7 primase T7g4p (T7 gene 4p; 0.3 pmol of CMP incorporated per min/pmol of protein) (28Lee S.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49419-49426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To identify the region in SpMcm10p responsible for primase activity, we examined two truncated derivatives of SpMcm10p in the oligoribonucleotide synthesis assay. As shown in Fig. 1C, Mcm10p-(416-593) supported oligoribonucleotide synthesis (lanes 9-14), whereas Mcm10p-(1-303) did not (lanes 19 and 20). Like full-length SpMcm10p, Mcm10p-(416-593) required added ssDNA for RNA synthesis (lanes 15-17). Whereas full-length Mcm10p supported oligoribonucleotide synthesis in the presence of ATP at 2.5 μm and higher, the truncated protein Mcm10p-(416-593) required at least 25 μm ATP. Significant differences in the length of RNA products formed by full-length Mcm10p and Mcm10p-(416-593) were noted. At all levels of protein tested, full-length Mcm10p synthesized products 5-18 nucleotides in length, whereas high levels of Mcm10p-(416-593) accumulated significantly longer products (Fig. 1C). Quantitative analysis of the RNA products formed at different levels of added ATP indicated that full-length Mcm10p had a higher specific activity compared with Mcm10p-(416-593) in the presence of 2 pmol of protein (supplemental Fig. 1A), whereas in the presence of 5 pmol of protein, the truncated derivative was five times more active than full-length Mcm10p (Fig. 1, compare B, lane 6, and C, lane 13). These results indicate that the residues between positions 416 and 593 of Mcm10p encode an RNA polymerase activity, but that the N-terminal regions of Mcm10p may play a role in regulating both the length and efficiency of oligoribonucleotide synthesis at low ATP levels. A recent study with the E. coli DnaG primase catalytic domain showed similarly that this region synthesizes primers whose abundance and lengths differ from those synthesized by the full-length primase (29Corn J.E. Pease P. Hura G. Berger J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 391-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We titrated Mcm10p-(416-593) in the direct primase assays and found that the activity curve was sigmoidal with respect to protein concentration, in contrast to that observed with full-length Mcm10p. The possible significance of this result is discussed further below. RNA Primers Formed by Mcm10p Support DNA Synthesis—The biological role of oligoribonucleotides synthesized by primase is to serve as primers for DNA polymerases that are incapable of initiating DNA chains de novo. To evaluate whether oligoribonucleotides formed by Mcm10p support DNA synthesis, we used the E. coli pol I-primase-coupled assay (30Kaguni L.S. Lehman I.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 950: 87-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this assay, which was carried out with (dT)300, the Klenow fragment-catalyzed incorporation of [α-32P]dATP is totally dependent on the oligoriboadenylate primers formed by primase. As shown in Fig. 2 (A and B), both full-length Mcm10p and the truncated derivative supported dAMP incorporation and formation of DNA chains 1-1.5 kb in length. Poly(dA) synthesis required the addition of ATP, (dT)300, either full-length Mcm10p or Mcm10p-(416-593), and the Klenow fragment (data showing the latter requirement not shown). In keeping with the results shown in Fig. 1C, full-length Mcm10p (amino acids 1-593) supported significantly more DNA synthesis at ∼10-fold lower levels of ATP compared with Mcm10p-(416-593) (Fig. 2B). The primase activity of the Mcm10p derivatives and the S. pombe p48-p58 primase complex (normally associated with the p180-p70 complex of pol α-primase) were compared using the coupled Klenow extension assay. As shown in Fig. 2C, full-length Mcm10p and Mcm10p-(416-593) were 5- and 12-fold less active, respectively, than the p48-p58 complex. These findings indicate that the Klenow fragment extends oligoriboadenylate chains formed by the Mcm10 proteins. When the extension assay was carried out in reactions containing the S. pombe pol α-primase p180-p70 subcomplex and the S. pombe pol δ or δ holoenzyme (including S. pombe replication factor C and S. pombe proliferating cell nuclear antigen) in lieu of the E. coli Klenow fragment, low but significant DNA synthesis was detected (supplemental Table 1). Physical Properties of Full-length Mcm10p, Mcm10p-(1-303), and Mcm10p-(416-593)—To characterize the hydrodynamic properties of full-length Mcm10p and its truncated derivatives and to establish whether they contain intrinsic primase activity, purified full-length Mcm10p, Mcm10p-(1-303), and Mcm10p-(416-593) were subjected to Superdex 200 gel filtration chromatography and glycerol gradient centrifugation. Fractions eluted from the size column were examined for primase activity in the coupled polymerase assay. Both full-length Mcm10p and Mcm10p-(416-593) eluted as a single protein peak that was largely coincident with the peak of primase activity, whereas fractions containing Mcm10p-(1-303) were devoid of this activity (Fig. 3A). The results obtained with glycerol gradient fractions indicated similarly that full-length Mcm10p and Mcm10p-(416-593) both eluted with a single peak of activity that was coincident with the peak of primase activity, whereas fractions containing Mcm10p-(1-303) were devoid of activity (Fig. 3B) (data not shown). These findings suggest that both full-length Mcm10p and Mcm10p-(416-593) intrinsically contain primase activity. Full-length Mcm10p displayed distinct properties in the two different sizing procedures used. The activity eluted from the gel filtration column with a relative molecular mass of 220 kDa, whereas the activity sedimented through a glycerol gradient at 70 kDa. The reason for the differential behavior during these two sizing steps is likely due to an irregularity in shape, which can cause a protein to be more excluded than spherical standards during gel filtration and sediment more slowly during centrifugation (31Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar). The Siegel-Monty equation (31Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar), which employs both the sedimentation value and Stokes radius, was used to calculate the apparent molecular mass of Mcm10p as well as its truncated derivatives (Fig. 3C). The apparent molecular masses of Mcm10p (120 kDa) and Mcm10p-(1-303) (74 kDa) are close to the values expected for a dimer (133 and 70 kDa, respectively), whereas that of Mcm10p-(416-593) (26 kDa) was less than halfway between that of a monomer (19 kDa) and a dimer (38 kDa). These data suggest that Mcm10p is a dimeric structure and that its dimerization may be influenced by the N terminus. We titrated Mcm10p-(416-593) in the direct and Klenow extension primase assays and found that the activity was not linear as found with Mcm10p. Instead, the activity observed was sigmoidal with respect to protein concentration. Although the reasons for this property are unclear, it should be noted that wild-type primase appears to be a dimer and that the region removed in this truncation (the N terminus) appears to be required for the dimerization. An interesting possibility is that, in the absence of the N terminus, high concentrations of truncated protein can substitute for dimer formation. Mcm10p-catalyzed Oligoribonucleotide Synthesis Is Influenced by the Template—Primases usually synthesize oligoribonucleotides complementary to template ssDNAs (1Frick D.N. Richardson C.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 39-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). However, prokaryotic primases support higher rates of oligoribonucleotide synthesis in the presence of specific DNA sequences called primase recognition sites. Although eukaryotic primases lack stringent requirements for such sites, they display sequence preferences. Primase initiation site selection depends on the reaction conditions used and appears to be more random at high rNTP concentrations and/or in the presence of Mn2+. For this reason, oligoribonucleotide synthesis with Mcm10p and the S. pombe p48-p58 primase complex was examined in the presence of (dT)50, (dC)50, and M13mp18 ssDNA at various rNTP levels (only with Mg2+). We examined the rate of oligoriboadenylate synthesis in the presence of (dT)50 and the S. pombe p48-p58 primase complex or full-length Mcm10p (Fig. 4A). In these experiments, the concentration of ATP was 100 μm, and the products formed were subjected to calf intestine alkaline phosphatase digestion. This treatment altered both the size and distribution of the oligoriboadenylate products formed (compare Figs. 1B and 4A) and prevented the detection of products smaller than 8 nucleotides. The aberrant migration of small RNAs due to calf intestine alkaline phosphatase treatment has been noted previously (32Cha T.A. Alberts B.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1791-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4F). These conditions facilitated the synthesis by the p48-p58 primase complex of short RNA products, which were not detected in reactions containing 25 μm ATP (compare Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. 1B). The rate of oligoribonucleotide formation by Mcm10p was slower than that by p48-p58 (Fig. 4, A and C). In the presence of p48-p58, the synthesis of oligoriboadenylate was detected 1 min after enzyme addition and plateaued after 10 min of incubation. In contrast, product formation with Mcm10p showed a pronounced lag of 5 min and then increased linearly up to 40 min. The size distribution of the products formed differed as well; products formed with Mcm10p were more varied in length than those synthesized by the p48-p58 complex. Even at a high GTP concentration (100 μm), reactions that contained (dC)50 produced low levels of oligomers in the presence of Mcm10p (Fig. 4, B and D), in keeping with observations made at lower nucleotide levels (supplemental Fig. 1B). However, at the higher GTP concentration, p48-p58 produced substantial levels of oligomer considerably longer in length than that formed at lower GTP levels (compare Fig. 4D and supplemental Fig. 1B). These data indicate that Mcm10p initiates primer synthesis preferentially with ATP rather than GTP. In general, primases do not initiate RNA chains with pyrimidine nucleotides, and in keeping with this property, dTTP incorporation was not observed in the coupled DNA synthesis reactions using poly(dA) as the template (in the presence of UTP and [α-32P]dTTP) with either Mcm10p or p48-p58 (data not shown). We found that the primers synthesized by Mcm10p were not efficiently extended farther in the presence of dATP and the S. pombe pol α-primase p180-p70 subcomplex (supplemental Fig. 1B and supplemental Table 1), whereas the oligo(G) product formed by the p48-p58 complex was extended by dGTP addition in the presence of the S. pombe pol α-primase p180-p70 subcomplex. These results suggest that primases may hand off primers more efficiently to one DNA polymerase compared with another. We also examined RNA products formed in reactions containing M13mp18 ssDNA as the template in the presence of the four rNTPs ([α-32P]ATP) at various rNTP levels. In these experiments, all products formed were subjected to calf intestine alkaline phosphatase digestion (Fig. 4, E and F). The major products synthes"

Using an experimental H. pylori challenge of rhesus monkeys of differing Lewis phenotypes, we aimed to determine whether H. pylori populations adapt their Lewis phenotypes to those of their hosts. After inoculation of four monkeys with a mixture of seven strains identified by RAPD-polymerase chain reaction, H. pylori Lewis expression was followed in 86 isolates obtained over 40 wk. Host Lewis(a/b) secretion status was characterized by immunological assays. Fingerprints of the predominating strain (J166) were identical in all four animals after 40 wk, but its Lewis phenotype had substantial variability in individual hosts. At 40 wk, J166 populations from two Lewis(a-b+) animals predominantly expressed Lewis(y). In contrast, J166 populations had switched to a Lewis(x) dominant phenotype in the two Lewis(a+b-) animals; a frame shift in futC, regulating conversion of Lewis(x) to Lewis(y), accounted for the phenotypic switch. The results indicate that individual cells in H. pylori populations can change Lewis phenotypes during long-term colonization of natural hosts to resemble those of their hosts, providing evidence for host selection for bacterial phenotypes."

We have undertaken characterization studies of two human homologs, hsUbc6 and hsUbc6e. Both possess tail-anchored protein motifs, display high conservation in their catalytic domains, and are functional ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes as determined by in vitro thiol-ester assay. Both also display induction by the unfolded protein response, a feature of many ER-associated degradation (ERAD) components. Post-translational modification involving phosphorylation of hsUbc6e was observed to be ER-stress-related and dependent on signaling of the PRK-like ER kinase (PERK). The phosphorylation site was mapped to Ser-184, which resides within the uncharacterized region linking the highly conserved catalytic core and the C-terminal transmembrane domain. Phosphorylation of hsUbc6e also did not alter stability, subcellular localization, or interaction with a partner ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. Assays of hsUbc6eS184D and hsUbc6eS184E, which mimic the phosphorylated state, suggest that phosphorylation may reduce capacity for forming ubiquitin-enzyme thiol-esters.

Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6907) Google Scholar). First, Ub-activating enzyme (E1) in an ATP-dependent step catalyzes the formation of a high energy thiolester bond between its active site cysteine and the C terminus (Gly-76) of Ub. The activated Ub is then transferred to the active site cysteine of a Ub-conjugating enzyme (E2) in a transthiolation reaction. Target protein ubiquitination can be achieved usually in conjunction with E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases, to regulate substrate specificity. After the initial ubiquitin is attached to an internal Lys residue of the substrate, additional ubiquitins are added sequentially forming a Lys-48-linked polyubiquitin chain, which then targets the substrate for degradation by the 26S proteasome. Ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation is involved in many cellular processes, including ER quality control of membrane proteins. In ER quality control, terminally misfolded or misassembled membrane proteins are disposed of by a multifaceted process termed ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (reviewed in Refs. 2Bonifacino J.S.

Immunoprecipitation of Myc-tagged hsUbc6e was performed by incubating the lysates with a 1:100 dilution of anti-Myc antibody for 1 h at 4°C, followed by incubation with 100 μl of 50% Protein-G-Sepharose slurry (Roche Applied Science) for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with ice-cold RIPA buffer (1 ml) and aliquoted for reaction. Samples were incubated with 5 or 10 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs) at 37 °C in 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm TrisHCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, in a 30-μl reaction volume, with or without phosphatase inhibitors. Reactions were stopped with addition of 3× Laemmli sample buffer, and products were separated by SDS-PAGE for immunoblot analysis. UPR Induction, RNA, and Protein Analysis—Cultured Panc-1 cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml tunicamycin (Calbiochem) in Me2SO or Me2SO alone. RNA was extracted using a QIAshredder™ Homogenizer and RNeasy® mini kit (Qiagen) according to the supplier's protocols. 10 μg of total RNA was resolved on agarose gels containing 1% formaldehyde, followed by blotting to nylon membranes (Hybond™-N, Amersham Biosciences) and UV cross-linking. Following hybridization with 32P-labeled hsUbc6e cDNA or hsUbc6 cDNA fragments, membranes were washed and exposed to film. Membranes were then deprobed and sequentially rehybridized with Grp78 (Image 878587) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probes (33Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). To examine ER stress effects on phosphorylation, cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml tunicamycin (Calbiochem), 1.0 μm thapsigargin (Sigma-Aldrich), or 2.0 mm DTT (Sigma-Aldrich). For UPR induction experiments with overexpressed hsUbc6e, Panc-1 cells were first transfected using 0.5 μg of Myc-hsUbc6e plasmid (mixed with pCMV vector to a total of 3 μg of DNA) per 60-mm dish, grown overnight, and then treated. Cell lysates were prepared, and protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE for detection of endogenous or Myc-tagged hsUbc6e by immunoblot analysis, as above. PERK in Vitro Kinase Assay—First strand cDNA from fetal liver total RNA (Stratagene) was synthesized by reverse transcription with oligo(dT)12-18 primer. Using total first strand cDNA as template, the cDNA of PERK kinase domain (amino acid residues 589-1114) was generated by standard PCR procedures with the forward (5′-AAT AGA ATG CGG CCG CCC TCA CAG GCA AAG GAA G) and reverse (5′-CCG CTC GAG CTA ATT GCT TGG CAA AGG) oligonucleotides. The PCR-generated open reading frame segment was inserted into the pET-28a bacterial expression vector (Novagen) and verified by sequencing. Bacterial transformation, induction of protein expression, and protein purification were carried out as described below. For the in vitro kinase assay, purified PERK kinase domain (2.5 μm) or mock (vector control), was preincubated with kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 30 μm ATP) for 10 min at 30 °C. Kinase reactions were initiated with addition of substrates, purified eIF-2α (100 μm) (a gift from F. Sicheri) or His-Ubc6eΔTMD (50 μm) (described below), and 2.0 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, with incubation for 20 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated with addition of Laemmli sample buffer, and products were resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. Purified PERK and Ubc6e proteins were detected by immunoblot analysis with 1:7500 dilution of monoclonal anti-T7 antibody (Novagen) and enhanced chemiluminescence using Hyperfilm™ ECL film (Amersham Biosciences) as above. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Transfected cells from 100-mm plates were split 24 h post-transfection onto 60-mm plates and grown for an additional 24 h. For [32P]phosphate labeling, cells were incubated in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) for 2 h at 37°C. The cells were then pulse-labeled by addition of 0.3 mCi/ml [32P]phosphate for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by a chase period of 2 h with addition of complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine, cells were incubated in methionine- and cysteine-free α-MEM for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were then pulse-labeled by addition of 140 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (Pro-mix l-[35S] in vitro cell labeling mix, Amersham Biosciences), 7 min, followed by chase periods with addition of complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were collected, and lysate volumes for immunoprecipitation were normalized for total labeled protein, as determined by scintillation counting of trichloroacetic acid-precipitated material. Immunoprecipitation of labeled extracts was performed as described above, and immunoreactive products were separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were then fixed in 10% acetic acid and 40% ethanol, soaked for 30 min in Amplify (Amersham Biosciences), dried, and exposed to film. Labeled proteins were visualized by exposure to BioMax MR film (Eastman Kodak) for 1-3 days. Membrane Isolation—Transfected HEK293 cells were washed with PBS and scraped into ice-cold suspension buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm triethanolamine, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture and phosphatase inhibitors. The cell suspension was passed 15 times through a 27-gauge needle and then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The clarified extract was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The supernatant was collected and subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Precipitated materials and the 100,000 × g pellet were resuspended in an equal volume of RIPA buffer and then analyzed by immunoblot. Immunofluorescence—COS-7 cells transfected with expression vectors were split 24 h post-transfection and cultured for an additional 24 h in 4-chamber slides (BD Falcon). The cells were fixed and permeabilized in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% Triton X-100 treatments for 30-min durations at room temperature. Following blocking with 1% BSA in PBS (PBS-BSA) for 30 min, cells were incubated with anti-Grp94 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), diluted 1:1000 in PBS-BSA, for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with PBS-BSA and incubated with 1:1000 anti-goat rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory, Inc.) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were again washed and incubated with anti-Myc antibody, diluted 1:1000, for 1 h, then washed again and incubated with 1:300 anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory, Inc.) for 1 h at room temperature. Following antibody treatments, cells were washed twice with PBS-BSA, once with PBS, and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Indirect immunofluorescence was examined with a Nikon E1000 fluorescence microscope. Images were captured using a charge-coupled device camera and OpenLab Spectrum Software (Scanalytics). Cloning of Parkin and Pael-R cDNAs—First strand cDNA from human fetal brain total RNA (Clontech) was synthesized by reverse transcription with oligo(dT)12-18 primer. Using total first strand cDNA as template, open reading frame cDNA of Parkin was generated by standard PCR procedures with the forward (5′-ATA GTG TTT GTC AGG TTC) and reverse (5′-CTA CAC GTC GAA CCA GTG) oligonucleotides. Open reading frame cDNA of Pael-receptor (Pael-R) was generated with two overlapping PCR products using the forward (5′-GCA GCA GGT GTC GAT CCT A-3′) and reverse (5′-TGA TGA GAA AGT CCC AGA AGG-3′), and the forward (5′-GGA TTC TTG GGT GAA GGA AT-3′) and reverse (5′-CAA GTA CTGTCC TTC AGC A-3′) oligonucleotides. The full-length open reading frame of Pael-R was then generated by overlap extension of the two PCR fragments. Open reading frame cDNAs were used as PCR templates for construction of pCMV expression vectors. N-terminal FLAG-tagged Parkin with start site Kozak consensus sequence was generated with the forward (5′-ATA AGA ATG CGG CCG CCC ACC ATG GAT TAC AAG GAT GAC GAC GAT AAG GCT ATA GTG TTT GTC AGG TTG-3′) and reverse (5′-ATA GTT TAG CGG CCG CCT ACA CGT CGA ACC AGT G-3′) oligonucleotides. C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Pael-R with start site Kozak consensus sequence was generated with the forward (5′-ATA AGA ATG CGG CCG CCC ACC ATG CGA GCC CCG GGC GCG CTT-3′) and reverse (5′-ATA GTT TAG CGG CCG CTC ATG CAT AGT CCG GTA CAT CGT ATG GGT AAG CGC AAT GAG TTC CGA CA) oligonucleotides. All PCR-generated segments and reading frames of expression vectors were verified by DNA sequencing. Co-immunoprecipitation of Parkin and hsUbc6e—Protein extracts were prepared from transfected HEK293 in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors. Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged Parkin was performed by incubating the lysates with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with 40 μl of 50% Protein-G-Sepharose slurry (Roche Applied Science) for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer (1 ml). Immunoprecipitated products were separated by SDS-PAGE for immunoblot analysis. Pulse-Chase Analysis of Pael-R—SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in 60-mm plates and transfected with various expression vectors using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's directions. 24 h post-transfection, cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (as described above) for 30 min. Cells were collected in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors. Immunoprecipitation of labeled HA-tagged was performed using 1:1000 dilution of anti-HA antibody (Covance) for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with 40 μl of 50% Protein-G Sepharose slurry (Roche Applied Science) for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed five times with ice-cold lysis buffer (1 ml), and immunoprecipitated products were separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were then fixed, dried, and exposed to film as described above. The radioactivity associated with the immunoprecipitated Pael-R bands was quantified using a PhosphorImager with ImageQuaNT software (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant Expression and Purification of hsUbc6e, hsUbc6eS184D, and hsUbc6eS184E—Bacterial expression vectors of His6 tag-fused hsUbc6eΔTMD and variants were generated by PCR with forward (5′-CGC GGA TCC ATG GAG ACC CGC TAC AAC CTG) and reverse (5′-CCG CTC GAG TTA CCC ACC ATG ATC AGT GTG) oligonucleotides, leading to the introduction of the TAA stop codon following amino acid Gly-286 (Fig. 1A). To generate S184D and S184E variants, the corresponding full-length pCMV expression vectors were used as templates in PCR. The transmembrane coding regions were excluded to promote solubility of the fusion proteins. PCR-generated open reading frame segments were verified by sequencing after insertion into the pET-28a expression vector (Novagen). Escherichia coli cells (BL21(DE3)) transformed with expression plasmids were induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C and collected and lysed with B-PER® Bacterial Protein Extraction Reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce). Expressed proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid His·Bind® resin (Novagen) according to manufacturer's protocol. Thiol-Ester Assay—Thiol-ester E2 complex formation with ubiquitin was measured for hsUbc6e and the S184D and S184E variants in a two-step assay. Ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E1, was preincubated as follows: 0.3 μm rabbit E1 (Boston Biochem), 1 mm ubiquitin (Sigma, U6253), 2 mm ATP, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 15 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C for 10 min. After cooling to 7 °C, hsUbc6e was added to a final concentration of 0.2 μm, and incubation was continued as indicated. Reactions were stopped with Laemmli sample buffer, and products were resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunodetection with a 1:7500 dilution of monoclonal anti-T7 antibody (Novagen) and enhanced chemiluminescence using Hyperfilm™ ECL film (Amersham Biosciences). Purified hsUbc6e was used as a standard for densitometry measurement (FluorChem 9900, Alpha Innotech). HsUbc6 and hsUbc6e Sequence Analysis and Confirmation of E2 Activity by Thiol-Ester Assay—Human homologs display high sequence conservation to yeast Ubc6 in their catalytic cores, with 64 and 46% identity for hsUbc6 and hsUbc6e, respectively, and are invariant at their catalytic cysteine positions (Fig. 1A). As well, both homologs possess hydrophobic C-terminal transmembrane domains and lack N-terminal signal sequences indicating that they are tail-anchored proteins. However, with the exception of the transmembrane domain, the sequences in regions C-terminal to the catalytic core have been poorly conserved. Both Ubc6 and Ubc6e subfamilies are represented in all eukaryotic kingdoms, including fungi, protists, plant, and metazoa with"
https://openalex.org/W2004892731,"In a recent note to Nature, R. MacKinnon has raised the possibility that potassium channel gating modifiers are able to partition in the phospholipid bilayer of neuronal membranes and that by increasing their partial concentration adjacent to their receptor, they affect channel function with apparent high affinity (Lee and MacKinnon (2004) Nature 430, 232–235). This suggestion was adopted by Smith et al. (Smith, J. J., Alphy, S., Seibert, A. L., and Blumenthal, K. M. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 11127–11133), who analyzed the partitioning of sodium channel modifiers in liposomes. They found that certain modifiers were able to partition in these artificial membranes, and on this basis, they have extrapolated that scorpion β-toxins interact with their channel receptor in a similar mechanism as that proposed by MacKinnon. Since this hypothesis has actually raised a new conception, we examined it in binding assays using a number of pharmacologically distinct scorpion β-toxins and insect and mammalian neuronal membrane preparations, as well as by analyzing the rate by which the toxin effect on gating of Drosophila DmNav1 and rat brain rNav1.2a develops. We show that in general, scorpion β-toxins do not partition in neuronal membranes and that in the case in which a depressant β-toxin partitions in insect neuronal membranes, this partitioning is unrelated to its interaction with the receptor site and the effect on the gating properties of the sodium channel. These results negate the hypothesis that the high affinity of β-toxins for sodium channels is gained by their ability to partition in the phospholipid bilayer and clearly indicate that the receptor site for scorpion β-toxins is accessible to the extracellular solvent.

Neurotoxins have been used extensively as molecular probes for defining the functional architecture of voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels (Navs and Kvs) (1Cestele S. Catterall W.A.

Toxicon. 2001; 39: 739-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Voltage-gated ion channels are composed of two functionally linked yet structurally independent domains (or modules) (2Catterall W.A.

The pore domain, encompassing trans-membrane segments S5–S6, is responsible for selective ion permeation, whereas a voltage-sensing domain (trans-membrane segments S1–S4) alters the conformation of the channel in response to changes in the membrane potential enabling channel activation. Structural and mechanistic models derived from the crystal structures of the archaebacterial channel KvAP (6Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Ruta V. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2003; 423: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar, 7Jiang Y. Ruta V. Chen J. Lee A. MacKinnon R.

Science. 2005; 309: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar) led to the suggestion that the positively charged S4 segment and parts of S3 form a stable hairpin (voltage-sensor paddle) located at the periphery of the channel within the membrane (6Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Ruta V. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2003; 423: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar). Comparison of KvAP and Kv1.2 crystal structures (8Long S.B.

Although Kvs are tetramers of four subunits, each containing six trans-membrane segments, sodium and calcium channels consist of a single large protein of four homologous domains (D1–D4, pseudo-subunits), each containing S1–S6 segments (2Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 1: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1705) Google Scholar). Regions of these channels involved in the gating mechanism have been shown to be associated with receptor sites for gating modifier toxins derived from venoms of scorpions (11Rogers J.C. Qu Y.

Interestingly, these gating modifier toxins appear to interact with an equivalent region (S3–S4 loop), albeit at different domains of voltage-gated ion channels (1Cestele S. Catterall W.A.

Analysis of the activity of VSTX1, a novel potassium channel gating modifier from the spider Grammostola spatulata, on the archaebacterial channel KvAP has led Lee and MacKinnon (16Lee S.Y. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2004; 430: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) to suggest that its apparent high affinity is gained by partitioning in the phospholipid bilayer, leading to an increase of toxin concentration near its receptor site (17Ruta V. MacKinnon R. Biochemistry. 2004; 31: 10071-10079Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 18Garcia M.L. Nature. 2004; 430: 153-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Based on the fact that such a modifier interacts with the S3–S4 loop (13Swartz K.J. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1997; 18: 665-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and relying on the x-ray structure of KvAP (6Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Ruta V. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2003; 423: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar), they claimed that this loop is dipped within the phospholipid bilayer. This hypothesis has attracted the minds of other pharmacologists (19Bosmans F. Rash L. Zhu S. Diochot S. Lazdunski M. Escoubas P. Tytgat J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 419-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 20Smith J.J. Alphy S. Seibert A.L. Blumenthal K.M. J. Biol.

Alphy S. Seibert A.L. Blumenthal K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11127-11133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The results of these experiments led to generalization of the MacKinnon hypothesis (16Lee S.Y. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2004; 430: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) with the claim that if such toxins were able to partition in liposomes, they might also be able to partition in neuronal membranes and thus reach their target receptor site. However, this suggestion has never been verified experimentally on intact neuronal membranes. Sodium channel gating modifiers derived from scorpion venom appear to interact with the S3–S4 loops (1Cestele S. Catterall W.A. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar) and are suitable for examining the validity of MacKinnon's hypothesis (16Lee S.Y. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2004; 430: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) directly on neuronal membranes. These toxins are divided into α and β classes according to their mode of action and binding properties (21Gordon D. Savarin P. Gurevitz M. Zinn-Justin S. J. Toxicol.

FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1201-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Since in their experiments the scorpion α-toxin Lqq5 did not partition in phospholipid vesicles, whereas the β-toxin Css2 did, Blumenthal and colleagues (20Smith J.J. Alphy S. Seibert A.L. Blumenthal K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11127-11133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) have suggested that β-toxins access their D2/S3–S4 binding site via a similar process proposed for Kv gating modifiers, namely partition in the phospholipid bilayer and then lateral diffusion toward the binding site on the sodium channel. The unusual number of hydrophobic residues that appear on the surface of site-4 gating modifiers seemingly supports this assumption (37Smith J.J. Blumenthal K.M. Biophys. J. 2005; (abstract issue, Presentation number 1228-Pos)Google Scholar). This suggestion constitutes the underpinning of the idea that receptor site-4, which is associated with D2/S3–S4, is dipped within the membrane, whereas receptor site-3, which is associated with D4/S3–S4, faces the extracellular solvent (20Smith J.J. Alphy S. Seibert A.L. Blumenthal K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11127-11133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We have challenged this revolutionary idea by analyzing the mode of interaction of a number of radiolabeled β-toxins with receptor site-4 on insect and mammalian neuronal membrane preparations and bring direct evidence that negates this hypothesis. We show that scorpion β-toxins bind with a fast association rate to a single channel receptor site and that most of them do not partition in neuronal membranes. We show that although some β-toxins, such as the depressant toxin LqhIT2, partition in insect neuronal membranes, this partition is not related to the toxin binding to receptor site-4 and effect. Toxins—Bj-xtrIT, LqhIT2, Css4, and Lqhβ1 were produced in a recombinant form as was described previously (34Froy O. Zilberberg N. Gordon D. Turkov D. Gilles N. Stankiewicz M. Pelhate M. Loret E.

Neuronal membranes from cockroach were prepared from whole heads of adult Periplaneta americana according to a previously described method (34Froy O. Zilberberg N. Gordon D. Turkov D. Gilles N.

Mammalian brain synaptosomes were prepared from adult albino Sprague-Dawley rats (∼300 g, laboratory-bred), as was described previously (41Gilles N. Leipold E. Chen H. Heinemann S.H. Gordon D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14576-14584Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Membrane protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay by using bovine serum albumin as standard. All toxins were radioiodinated by lactoperoxidase (Sigma; catalog number L8257; 7 units/60 μl of reaction mix) using 10 μg of toxin and 0.5 mCi of carrier-free Na125I (Amersham Biosciences) following a published protocol (42Rochat C. Tessier M. Miranda F. Lissitzky S. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 82: 532-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The monoiodotoxin was purified using a Resource Analytical reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography column (6.4 × 100 mm, 15-μm particle size; Amersham Biosciences). The concentration of the radiolabeled toxin was determined according to the specific activity of the 125I corresponding to 2500–3000 dpm/fmol monoiodotoxin, depending on the age of the radiotoxin and by estimation of its biological activity (usually 70–80% (43Gilles N. Krimm I. Bouet F. Froy O. Gurevitz M. Lancelin J.M. Gordon D. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1735-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar)). The composition of the media used in the binding assays and termination of the reactions were described previously (41Gilles N. Leipold E. Chen H. Heinemann S.H. Gordon D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14576-14584Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 43Gilles N. Krimm I. Bouet F. Froy O. Gurevitz M. Lancelin J.M. Gordon D. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1735-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Nonspecific toxin binding was determined in the presence of 1–30 μm unlabeled toxin and is indicated in the figure legends. Equilibrium competition binding assays were performed using increasing concentrations of unlabeled toxin in the presence of a constant low concentration of 125I-toxin and analyzed by the computer program KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA) using a non-linear Hill equation (for IC50 determination). The Ki values were calculated by the equation Ki = IC50/(1+(L*/Kd)), where L* is the concentration of radioiodinated toxin and Kd is its dissociation constant. Each experiment was performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times as indicated (n). Data are presented as mean ± S.D. of number of independent experiments (41Gilles N. Leipold E. Chen H.

Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1735-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The kinetic data for ligand association and dissociation rates were subjected to analysis by LIGAND (Elsevier Biosoft, Cambridge, UK) by using Kinetic Analysis. Each curve was subjected to multislope analysis to determine whether there are one or two slopes. For LqhIT2 binding, kinetic analysis of single and double exponent curves was performed by IGOR Pro (wave-Metrics Inc., Lake Oswego, OR). Toxin dissociation was induced by the addition of excess cold toxin, and the dissociation rate constant (koff) was determined directly from a first order plot of toxin dissociation versus time. The time constant (τ = ln2/koff) was estimated directly from the binding curves. The rate of toxin association (kon) was determined from the equation kon = kobs([RL]e/([L][RL]max), where [L] is the ligand concentration, [RL]e is the concentration of the complex at equilibrium, [RL]max is the maximum number of receptors present (determined in a parallel saturation experiment), and kobs is the slope of the pseudo-first order plot ln([RL]e/([RL]e – [RL]t)) versus time (44Weiland G.A. Molinoff P.B. Life Sci. 1981; 29: 313-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Each experiment was performed at least three times.

Weigl L. Lotan I. Schreibmayer W. Dascal N. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 3743-3752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Wallner M. Weigl L. Meera P. Lotan I. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar)) and were injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes as was described previously (28Shichor I. Zlotkin E. Ilan N. Chikashvili D. Stuhmer W. Gordon D. Lotan I. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4364-4371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two-electrode Voltage Clamp Recording—Currents were measured 1–2 days after injection using a two-electrode voltage clamp and a GeneClamp 500 amplifier (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA). Data were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 5 kHz. Data acquisition was controlled by a Macintosh PPC 7100/80 computer equipped with an ITC-16 analog/digital converter (Instrutech Corp., Port Washington, NY) utilizing Synapse (Synergistic Systems). Capacitance transients and leak currents were removed by subtracting a scaled control trace utilizing a P/6 protocol (46Wallner M. Weigl L. Meera P. Lotan I. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Bath solution contained (in mm): 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 5 HEPES, pH 7.85. Oocytes were washed with bath solution flowing from a BPS-8 perfusion system (ALA Scientific Instruments, Westbury, NY) with a positive pressure of 4 p.s.i. Toxins were diluted with bath solution and applied directly to the bath to the final desired concentration. We have examined the hypothesis that the binding site of scorpion β-toxins on the Navs resides in the phospholipid milieu of neuronal membranes by using different experimental approaches. We analyzed the effects of a number of toxins on the gating properties to assess whether they develop in rates that could be correlated with the rates of partitioning and lateral diffusion presented by Lee and MacKinnon (16Lee S.Y. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2004; 430: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and compared them with the kinetic parameters of their binding interaction with their channel receptor site. We have also analyzed directly whether these toxins are capable of partitioning in neuronal membranes. Effects of Scorpion β-Toxins on the Activation Properties of NaVs—We compared the effects of the anti-insect selective depressant toxin LqhIT2 on the insect para DmNav1 channel with those induced by the anti-mammalian β-toxin Css4 on the rat brain rNav1.2a channel (27Cestele S. Qu Y. Rogers J.C. Rochat H. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 919-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), as well as analyzed the effects of the multipotent toxin Lqhβ1 on both channels expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The three β-toxins induced the typical effect of shift in voltage dependence of channel activation to more negative membrane potentials (Fig. 1) (27Cestele S. Qu Y. Rogers J.C. Rochat H. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 919-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 30Gordon D. Ilan N. Zilberberg N. Gilles N. Urbach D. Cohen L. Karbat I. Froy O. Gaathon A. Kallen R.G. Benveniste M. Gurevitz M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2663-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)). The apparent association rates of LqhIT2 and Lqhβ1 to DmNav1 were determined by the currents induced by the depolarization step to –40 mV (Fig. 1), as was determined for Css4 (27Cestele S. Qu Y. Rogers J.C. Rochat H. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 919-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The currents developed in a similar fast rate (τ = 1.53 ± 0.29 and 14.3 ± 3.3 s, for LqhIT2 and Lqhβ1, respectively; Fig. 1), as was shown for Css4 on rNav1.2 (27Cestele S. Qu Y. Rogers J.C. Rochat H. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 919-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Thus, the β-toxin association rate to receptor site-4, which leads to the modification of the Nav gating properties, is 2 orders of magnitude faster than the relatively slow rates of partitioning and lateral diffusion of VSTX1 to its channel receptor in artificial phospholipid membranes (16Lee S.Y. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2004; 430: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Kinetic Parameters of the Binding of β-Toxins to Neuronal Membranes—The kinetic parameters of Bj-xtrIT, Css4, and LqhIT2 binding to neuronal membranes were determined using radiolabeled ligands. This analysis revealed that the association rate constant (kon) of the 125I-Bj-xtrIT to cockroach neuronal membranes was 20.4 ± 5.3 × 106m–1 s–1 (n = 3), and the kon of 125I-Css4 to rat brain synaptosomes was 12.6 ± 3.2 × 106m–1 s–1 (Fig. 2), which were comparable with the kon of the classical scorpion α-toxin Lqh2 to rat brain synaptosomes (12.0 ± 4.0 106m–1 s–1 (41Gilles N. Leipold E. Chen H. Heinemann S.H. Gordon D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14576-14584Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar)). The dissociation rate constants (koff) of Bj-xtrIT and Css4 from their respective receptor sites were also similar, 0.91 ± 0.25 × 10–3 s–1 (n = 4) and 1.66 ± 0.4 × 10–3 s–1 (n = 3), respectively. The equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) calculated from the kinetic parameters were in agreement with those obtained in equilibrium binding studies (Fig. 2, insets; Kd = 0.09 ± 0.03 nm (n = 4) and Kd = 0.73 ± 0.11 nm (n = 4) for Bj-xtrIT and Css4, respectively). These results indicate that these toxins bind in a reversible manner to a single receptor site in neuronal membranes. The interaction of the depressant toxin LqhIT2 with cockroach neuronal membranes was, however, more complex, and therefore the kon value could not be determined directly. LqhIT2 binds to two distinct, non-interacting binding sites (47Gordon D. Moskowitz H. Eitan M. Warner C. Catterall W.A. Zlotkin E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7622-7628Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3), of which the high affinity site is of low capacity (48Moskowitz H. Herrmann R. Zlotkin E. Gordon D. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 13-19Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) (Ki = 0.9 ± 0.66 nm; Bmax = 2.4 ± 0.02 pmol/mg, (n = 3); Fig. 3, inset) and is similar to that of excitatory toxins, e.g. Bj-xtrIT (Fig. 2, inset) (48Moskowitz H. Herrmann R. Zlotkin E. Gordon D. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 13-19Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The high affinity site was shown to be blocked by anti-peptide antibodies directed against external sodium channel regions (47Gordon D. Moskowitz H. Eitan M. Warner C. Catterall W.A. Zlotkin E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7622-7628Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and its capacity was reported to be similar to that of saxitoxin receptors on the same neuronal membranes (47Gordon D. Moskowitz H. Eitan M. Warner C. Catterall W.A. Zlotkin E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7622-7628Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 48Moskowitz H. Herrmann R. Zlotkin E. Gordon D. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 13-19Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 49Gordon D. Zlotkin E. Catterall W.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta,. 1985; 821: 130-136Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the high affinity binding site for LqhIT2 resides on the sodium channel. The low affinity site of LqhIT2 (Ki = 307 ± 88 nm, n = 3) is of a capacity that is too high to be related to Navs(Bmax = 68 ± 9.3 pmol/mg), and its nature is still unknown (47Gordon D. Moskowitz H. Eitan M. Warner C. Catterall W.A. Zlotkin E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7622-7628Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Since the low affinity/high capacity binding site observed for LqhIT2 is evident when the high affinity site is saturated by an excitatory toxin, such as AahIT or Bj-xtrIT (34Froy O. Zilberberg N. Gordon D. Turkov D. Gilles N. Stankiewicz M. Pelhate M. Loret E. Oren D. Shaanan B. Gurevitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5769-5776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 47Gordon D. Moskowitz H. Eitan M. Warner C. Catterall W.A. Zlotkin E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7622-7628Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3), and the radiolabeled toxin can be displaced by LqhIT2 and Lqhβ1 (Fig. 3), it does not represent partition in the phospholipid membrane. Partition in the membrane should have infinite capacity (i.e. non-displaceable and not dependent on concentration) and relatively slow kinetics, as reported for the binding of the spider gating modifier toxin VSTX1 to phospholipid membranes (16Lee S.Y. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2004; 430: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). LqhIT2 Partitioning in the Phospholipid Bilayer of Insect Neuronal Membranes—Blumenthal and colleagues (20Smith J.J. Alphy S. Seibert A.L. Blumenthal K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11127-11133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) have shown that the β-toxin Css2 was able to partition in an artificial phospholipid bilayer (liposomes), whereas the scorpion α-toxin Lqq5 did not. Therefore we examined in a direct approach whether β-toxins are capable of partitioning in the phospholipid bilayer of neuronal membranes. We followed after the direct binding of LqhIT2 in low (0.1 nm) and high concentrations (30 μm) to locust and cockroach neuronal membranes using tracer amounts of 125I-LqhIT2. Since a high LqhIT2 concentration occupies all displaceable binding sites on these neuronal membrane preparations (Fig. 3), any measurable 125I-LqhIT2 associated with the membranes would imply interaction with a site of infinite capacity, that is, the phospholipid bilayer. In a similar manner, we measured the binding interaction of 125I-Bj-xtrIT and 125I-Css4 with the neuronal membranes of cockroach and rat brain, and as a control, we used the α-toxin 125I-LqhαIT, which binds to receptor site-3 on insect Navs. The nonspecific binding of 125I-Bj-xtrIT, 125I-Css4, and 125I-LqhαIT, each determined in the presence of 1 μm corresponding unlabeled toxin, consisted of only a small fraction of the total binding and was time-independent (Fig. 4). In contrast, the binding of 125I-LqhIT2 to the cockroach membranes in the presence of 30 μm LqhIT2 was time-dependent and reached equilibrium after ∼50 min (Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained in binding assays of 125I-LqhIT2 on locust neuronal membranes (Fig. 4). These results suggested that the LqhIT2 fraction that bound to the insect membranes in a non-displaceable yet time-dependent manner was associated with the phospholipid bilayer. The LqhIT2 slow non-displaceable association, which constitutes ∼50% of total binding, is considered as nonspecific binding in the equilibrium competition experiments (Fig. 3). It is noteworthy that the ability of LqhIT2 to partition in liposomes composed of phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylethanolamine was demonstrated previously (50Moskowitz H. Identification and Characterization of the Receptor of the Insect Selective Neurotoxins. Ph. D. thesis. The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel (in Hebrew)1992Google Scholar). Together with this observation, we conclude that LqhIT2 non-specific time-dependent binding to locust and cockroach neuronal membranes (Fig. 4) is most likely a result of the toxin slow partitioning in the phospholipid bilayer. In light of these results, we were able to estimate the association rate of LqhIT2 to its high affinity site on Navs in cockroach neuronal membranes, which could not be determined directly due to the toxin partitioning in the membrane. Association kinetics of 0.1 nm125I-LqhIT2 provided two slopes with small and high time constants (τfast = 74 ± 33 s; τslow = 1363 ± 220 s; Fig. 5), indicating fast and slow kinetic rates. In contrast, the association kinetics of 125I-LqhIT2 in the presence of high concentration of the unlabeled toxin (5 or 30 μm) was monotonous with a single slope of high time constant (τnonspecific = 1527 ± 155 s, Fig. 5; see also Fig. 4), which represented LqhIT2 partitioning in the phospholipid bilayer. Subtraction of the two curves provides an apparent specific binding association curve with a single slope of a small time constant (τ = 108 ± 36 s; Fig. 5), indicating that LqhIT2 binding to its high affinity site is of fast kinetics. Such kinetics has been shown for Bj-xtrIT and Css4 (τ = 134 and 118 s, respectively; Fig. 2). These toxins bind to a single receptor site on insect or rat brain Navs (Fig. 2) and do not interact with the phospholipid bilayer (Fig. 4). Thus, the kinetics of LqhIT2 partitioning in the phospholipid bilayer is more than 10-fold slower when compared with the kinetics of its interaction with receptor site-4 (Fig. 5). On the basis of these results as well as the ability of LqhIT2 to affect DmNav1 activation within a few seconds (Fig. 1), we conclude that the slow partitioning of LqhIT2 in the membrane does not contribute to its interaction with receptor site-4 or to its physiological effect. Receptor Site-4 on the NaV Is Accessible from the Extracellular Side of Neuronal Membranes—Using different experimental approaches, we show that scorpion β-toxins affect Navs gating independent of their ability to partition in the phospholipid bilayer. We first demonstrate that the β-toxins Css4 (very similar to Css2 (51Martin M.F. Garcia y Perez L.G. El Ayeb M. Kopeyan C. Bechis G. Jover E. Rochat H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4452-4459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and Bj-xtrIT do not partition in rat brain or insect neuronal membranes (Fig. 4) and that their rates of association to receptor site-4 (Fig. 2) (27Cestele S. Qu Y. Rogers J.C. Rochat H. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 919-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 52Tsushima R.G. Borges A. Backx P.H. Eur. J. Physiol. 1999; 437: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) are 2 orders of magnitude faster than that measured for VSTX1 partition and lateral diffusion (16Lee S.Y. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2004; 430: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The difference between our data and those of Blumenthal and colleagues (20Smith J.J. Alphy S. Seibert A.L. Blumenthal K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11127-11133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) may be attributed to the phospholipid composition and the presence of cholesterol in the neuronal membranes used in our study. Not only has the lipid composition of membranes been shown to influence the partition coefficient of polypeptides (53Wieprecht T. Beyermann M. Seelig J. Biochemistry. 1999; 32: 10377-10387Crossref Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 54Murray D. Arbuzova A. Hangyas-Mihalyne G. Gambhir A. Ben-Tal N. Honig B. McLaughlin S. Biophys.

Soc. 2004; 126: 14758-14763Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), but it was also shown that specific phospholipids were required for reconstitution of functional rat brain Navs in liposomes and for binding of the scorpion α-toxin Lqq5 to receptor site-3 (56Feller D.J. Talvenheimo J.A. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11542-11547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results are corroborated by previous reports on 125I-Css2 binding to Navs in electroplaque membranes (57Wheeler K.P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5628-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and 125I-Css4 binding to reconstituted rat brain sodium channels in liposomes (58Thomsen W.J. Martin-Euclaire M.F. Rochat H. Catterall W.A. J.

We further show that the slow partitioning of the β-toxin LqhIT2 in neuronal membranes (Figs. 4 and 5) is unrelated to its binding to receptor site-4, whereas its fast, high affinity binding correlates well with the fast development of toxin effect on channel activation (Fig. 1) (27Cestele S. Qu Y. Rogers J.C. Rochat H. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 919-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Since α-toxins do not seem to interact with phospholipids upon binding to receptor site-3 (20Smith J.J. Alphy S. Seibert A.L. Blumenthal K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11127-11133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4), we conclude that both receptor site-4 and receptor site-3 of Nav gating modifiers are not dipped in the neuronal membrane. These receptor sites involve loops of S3–S4 in domains 2 and 4 of the channel, which suggests that at least in part, these loops protrude out of the phospholipid bilayer to the extracellular aqueous solution."

The selectivity of these metal sites and their role in ligand binding have been investigated by expressing a fragment corresponding to the β3 A-domain, β3-(109-352), and single point mutants in which each of the cation-binding sites has been disabled. Equilibrium dialysis experiments identified three Mn2+- and two Ca2+-binding sites with the LIMBS being the site that did not bind Ca2+. Although the ADMIDAS could bind Ca2+, it did not bind Mg2+. These results indicate that the Ca2+-specific site that inhibits ligand binding is the ADMIDAS. Two different assay systems, surface plasmon resonance and a microtiter plate assay, demonstrated that the β3 A-domain fragment bound fibrinogen in the presence of 0.1 mm Ca2+ but not in 3 mm Ca2+. This behavior recapitulated the effects of Ca2+ on fibrinogen binding to αvβ3 but not αIIbβ3. Disabling any of the three cation-binding sites abrogated fibrinogen binding. These results indicate that the specificities of the three metal-binding sites for divalent cations are distinct and that each site can regulate the ligand binding potential of the β3 A-domain.

These results indicate that the specificities of the three metal-binding sites for divalent cations are distinct and that each site can regulate the ligand binding potential of the β3 A-domain. The β3 integrin subfamily consists of two members, αvβ3 and αllbβ3. The two receptors share the same β3 subunit, and the amino acid sequences of their α subunits are 36% identical (1Fitzgerald L.A. Poncz M. Steiner B. Rall Jr., S.C. Bennett J.S. Phillips D.R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8158-8165Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Both are typical integrin α/β heterodimers, in which each subunit is composed of a large extracellular region, a transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic tail. αllbβ3 expression is restricted primarily to platelets and their megakaryocyte precursors and plays an indispensable role in thrombus formation (2Hodivala-Dilke K.M.

However, there is a fundamental difference in the specificity involved in fibrinogen recognition by the two integrins; αllbβ3 binds fibrinogen through the sequence at the carboxyl terminus of its γ chain 406KQAGDV411 (11Farrell D.H.

Cell. 1989; 58: 945-953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In addition, sites within the γ chain, distinct from the KQAGDV, have been implicated in recognition of fibrinogen by αvβ3 (14Yokoyama K. Zhang X.-P. Medved L. Takada Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5872-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). According to recently published crystal structures of the extracellular regions of αvβ3 (15Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar) and αllbβ3 (16Xiao T. Takagi J. Coller B.S. Wang J.H. Springer T.A. Nature. 2004; 432: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar) with bound ligand mimetics, the main area of ligand binding lies between the β-propeller of the α subunit and the A-domain in the β3 subunit. This direct demonstration of β3 A-domain involvement in ligand engagement was preceded by numerous studies using mutational, immunological, and biochemical approaches (17D'Souza S.E. Haas T.A.

The binding of most ligands to integrins requires metal ions. This is also true for the β3 integrins and the cellular responses arising from ligand engagement (e.g. platelet aggregation (22Mustard J.F. Packham M.A. Kinlough-Rathbone R.L. Perry D.W. Regoeczi E. Blood. 1978; 52: 453-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Marguerie G.A. Edgington T.S. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 154-161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Bennett J.S. Vilaire G. J. Clin. Investig. 1979; 64: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar)). The β-propeller domain of the α subunit contains four divalent ion-binding sites within the loops of blades 4-7 near the bottom of the propeller, but these are not directly involved in ligand engagement (25Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). The β3 A-domain contains three metal sites for binding ligands, which are more directly involved in ligand binding. These are referred to as the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS), 4The abbreviations used are: MIDAS, metal ion-dependent adhesion site; ADMIDAS, site adjacent to the MIDAS; LIMBS, ligand-induced metal-binding site; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; RU, resonance units. a site adjacent to the MIDAS (ADMIDAS), and a ligand-induced metal-binding site (LIMBS). The αvβ3 and αllbβ3 crystal structures establish that cation bound in the MIDAS is involved directly in ligand engagement; the ADMIDAS cation is not directly involved in contacting ligand but may help to regulate ligand binding; and the LIMBS cation may aid in stabilizing the receptor-ligand complex (26Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 7: 1642-1654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Both Mg2+ and Mn2+ support ligand binding to αvβ3 and αllbβ3, but Ca2+ has a differential effect on fibrinogen binding to the two integrins. Ca2+ suppresses fibrinogen binding to αvβ3 but supports its interaction with αllbβ3 (23Marguerie G.A. Edgington T.S. Plow E.F. J. Biol.

In the αvβ3 structure crystallized in the presence of Ca2+, the MIDAS and ADMIDAS were partially or completely occupied, respectively. When an Arg-Gly-Asp ligand was cocrystallized with the extracellular portion of αvβ3 in the presence of Mn2+, the MIDAS and ADMIDAS had Mn2+ bound and the additional site, LIMBS, also had Mn2+ bound. The Mn2+ at the MIDAS was coordinated by the aspartic acid of the ligand, verifying direct involvement of the MIDAS with the ligand. As the LIMBS was not observed in the unliganded structure; it was proposed that this site stabilized ligand binding within the β3 A-domain. The crystal structures of αllbβ3 with bound ligand mimetics were formed in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+. These structures revealed three metal sites in which the MIDAS had Mg2+ bound that was also coordinated by the ligand, whereas the ADMIDAS and LIMBS had Ca2+ bound. In a previous study, we demonstrated that recombinant fragments containing portions of the β3 A-domain could be expressed in bacteria, folded through a denature/renature protocol, and could then support fibrinogen binding in a divalent ion-dependent manner. High Ca2+ (>1mm) suppressed fibrinogen binding, where low Ca2+ (0.1 mm) supported binding (30Cierniewski C.S. Byzova T. Papierak M. Haas T.A. Niewiarowska J. Zhang L. Cieslak M. Plow E.F. J. Biol.

In this study, we have expressed wild-type β3 A-domain and mutants in which a single metal ion site has been disabled. These derivatives have been used to clarify the specificity and determine the contribution of each cation-binding site to fibrinogen recognition by the β3 A-domain. Receptors and Polyclonal Antibody—αIIbβ3 was isolated from outdated platelets by RGD affinity chromatography (31Pytela R. Pierschbacher M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. Ruoslahti E.

Expression and Purification of Recombinant β3 A-domains—The cDNA coding for the β3 A-domain, β3-(109-352), was inserted into pRSETa vector (Invitrogen) and expressed in Escherichia coli as an amino-terminal His tag protein as described previously (33Cierniewska-Cieslak A. Cierniewski C.S. Blecka K. Papierak M. Michalec L. Zhang L. Haas T.A. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11126-11134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Single mutations of aspartic acids 119, 126, and 217 to alanines were created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The nucleotide sequences of the wild-type β3 A-domain and each mutant were confirmed. The expressed proteins were purified on a Ni2+ chromatography column under denaturing conditions (8 m urea). The proteins were refolded by dialysis to reduce the concentration of urea to less than 1 mm. The purity of the recombinant proteins was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, and the major band migrated as a single band at 31 kDa, which is of the appropriate molecular weight for the β3 A-domain. To prepare β3 A-domain fragment for NMR analyses, 2 liters of cultures were grown in minimal media containing 15NH4Cl as a sole source for nitrogen. The expression and purification conditions were the same as described above. The heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectrum was collected in 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, on a Bruker 600-MHz instrument equipped with a cryoprobe. Equilibrium Dialysis Cation-binding Assays—Binding of Ca2+ and Mn2+ to the β3 A-domain fragments was determined by equilibrium dialysis using a 16-mirocell dialyzer (Sialomed Inc., Columbia, MD). Regulation of the free Ca2+ concentration by EGTA was used to obtain the Ca2+-binding isotherms of β3 A-domain fragments in 50 mm Tris, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.3, containing 50 mm octyl glucoside (equilibration buffer). Total Ca2+ concentrations were determined spectrofluorimetrically (PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50), using Fura-2 and Ca2+ standard solutions obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. 45Ca2+ and 54Mn2+ were measured in a scintillation counter (Beckman LS6000LL) using 45Ca and 54Mn programs, respectively. Below 10 μm, the required free Ca2+ concentration was adjusted by addition of 7 mm EGTA, as calculated according to Fabiato (34Fabiato A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 378-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar) to account for influence of pH, temperature, and ionic strength on the equilibrium constants used. Demineralization of the analyzed proteins was done by dialysis for 1 h at 22 °C against the equilibrium buffer containing enough EGTA to reduce the free Ca2+ to below 1 nm as described by Rivas and Gonzalez-Rodriguez (35Rivas G.A. Gonzalez-Rodriguez J. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Equilibrium dialysis experiments were then performed as described previously (33Cierniewska-Cieslak A. Cierniewski C.S. Blecka K. Papierak M. Michalec L. Zhang L. Haas T.A. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11126-11134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Various amounts of 10 mm CaCl2 or MnCl2 were added in the equilibrium buffer containing 45Ca2+ (3 μCi/ml) or 54Mn2+ (0.5 μCi/ml) to achieve free Ca2+ and Mn2+ concentration between 0.01 and 1000 μm or 0.01 and 100 μm, respectively. Free Ca2+ concentrations were calculated from the contaminating Ca2+, determined spectrofluorimetrically, plus the amount of added Ca2+. 45CaCl2 (0.48 μCi) or 54MnCl2 (0.05 μCi) was injected into one half-cell, and the proteins into the other one. After dialysis for 24 h at 21 °C, aliquots were removed for 45Ca2+ and protein determinations, and SDS-PAGE was performed to exclude protein degradation. The recombinant β3 A-domain mutants were used at the concentration of 30-40 μm. To test the effects of Mg2+ and Mn2+ on Ca2+ binding, the equilibrium dialysis was performed in the presence of 45CaCl2 (500 μm) sufficient to saturate cation-binding sites in β3 A-domain fragments, and serial dilutions of either Mg2+, ranging from 0 to 100 mm, orMn2+, ranging from 0 to 1 mm, were added. Similarly, to study the effect of Ca2+ on Mn2+ binding, equilibrium dialysis was performed in the presence of 45MnCl2 (50 μm) sufficient to saturate cation-binding sites in β3 A-domain fragments, and serial dilutions of Ca2+ in the range of 0-10 mm were added. Binding isotherms were analyzed via nonlinear regression analysis using Prism 2.01 (GraphPad Prism Software, San Diego) to determine the maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) and the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) values. The binding experimental data were fit to two ligand binding models as follows: a single class of independent, noninteracting sites or two classes of independent, noninteracting sites, according to the following equations: for a single class of sites, B = nK[L]/(1 + K[L]); or for two classes of sites, B = n1K1[L]/(1 + K1[L]) + n2K2[L]/(1 + K2[L]). In these equations, B is the ratio of Ca2+ or Mn2+ bound (micromoles) to micromoles of fusion protein; n refers to the number of binding sites; K is the equilibrium association constant; and [L] is the free Ca2+ or Mn2+ concentration. Surface Plasmon Resonance—The interaction of fibrinogen with αIIbβ3, αvβ3, the β3 A-domain, and its mutants were determined by SPR. The association and dissociation rate constants (kon and koff) and the dissociation constant (KD) were measured using either the BIAcore X or BIAcore 3000 biosensor (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The β3 A-domain and its mutants or fibrinogen were immobilized onto the CM5 sensor chip via amine coupling (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Experiments were performed at 37 °C in 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, with or without calcium, magnesium, or EDTA. Experimental data were analyzed using BIAevaluation 3.2 software supplied by Biacore AB. The results were expressed in resonance units (RU), an arbitrary unit specific for the BIAcore instrument (1000 RU correspond to ∼1ng of bound protein/mm2). The association rate constant, kon, and dissociation rate constant, koff, were determined from individual association and dissociation phases, respectively, assuming one-to-one interactions. The overall dissociation constant, KD, was derived from koff/kon. Microtiter Plate Assays—Microtiter wells were coated with 5 μg/ml β3 A-domain overnight at 4 °C in 20 mm sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.5. The plate was washed and coated with 2% bovine serum albumin in Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, for 2 h at 25°C. The plate was incubated with 50 nm 125I-fibrinogen in varied concentrations of calcium, magnesium, or manganese in Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, for 4 h at 25 °C. Binding of fibrinogen was determined by direct γ-counting of the individual plastic wells. Nonspecific binding was determined by the presence of 2.5 μm nonlabeled fibrinogen. Assays were performed in triplicates per experiment; multiple experiments were carried out, and the data were averaged. Expression of Recombinant β3 A-domain-(109-352) and Mutant Forms—To determine the cation selectivity of each metal site, single point mutations were created in a series of fragments corresponding to the β3 A-domain. A metal ion coordinating aspartic acid was mutated to alanine in the MIDAS at position 119, ADMIDAS at position 126, and LIMBS at position 217. The wild-type β3 fragment and each mutant were expressed in E. coli as amino-terminal His tag fusion proteins. Purification was performed on a Ni2+ chromatography column in 8 m urea, and the proteins were refolded by dialysis to sequentially reduce the concentration of denaturant to less than 1 mm. The purity of each recombinant protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and a major band at 31 kDa is the appropriate molecular mass of the A-domain fragment (Fig. 1A), and the identity was verified by immunoblotting with antibodies to β3 (Fig. 1B) or the His tag (not shown). We had previously used circular dichroism to obtain evidence that the β3 A-domain and various mutant forms were properly folded (33Cierniewska-Cieslak A. Cierniewski C.S. Blecka K. Papierak M. Michalec L. Zhang L. Haas T.A. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11126-11134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), based on the similarities in their estimated helical content to one another and to that predicted from the crystal structure of αvβ3 (25Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). We also have analyzed the folding of the β3 A-domain fragment by NMR. For this purpose, the bacteria expressing the fragment were grown in media containing 15N and then purified and renatured as described above. The chemical shift dispersion of the heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectrum, collected at 25 °C in a 600-MHz instrument, was indicative of a folded protein. Such spectra raise the possibility that NMR ultimately could be used to solve the detailed structures of the various β3 A-domains. Equilibrium Dialysis—Equilibrium dialysis experiments were performed to test the specificities of the ion-binding sites in the β3 A-domain. In preparing the recombinant β3 A-domains for these analyses, the fragments were treated with EGTA, and the concentration of Ca2+ was reduced to less than 1nm as described by Rivas and Gonzalez-Rodriguez (35Rivas G.A. Gonzalez-Rodriguez J. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Ca2+ binding to the β3 A-domains was measured in the concentration range of 0.1 to 752 μm, using a radioactive tracer to monitor binding. Inspection of the Ca2+-binding isotherms (Fig. 2A) provides clear evidence for two Ca2+-binding sites in the wild-type β3 A-domain and the mutant in which the LIMBS had been mutated (D217A), and one site in the mutants in which the MIDAS (D119A) and ADMIDAS (D126A) had been inactivated. Similar studies were performed with Mn2+ in the range of 0.1 to 100 μm, again using a radioactive tracer to monitor binding (Fig. 2B). With this divalent cation, three binding sites were evident in the wild-type β3 A-domain and mutation of the LIMBS, MIDAS, and ADMIDAS reduced the number of sites in each variant β3 A-domain to two. The data in Fig. 2 were further analyzed. Each isotherm for the two cations fit well to a single site binding model described by the equation B = nK[L]/(1 + K[L]), where B is the ratio of Ca2+ or Mn2+ bound (micromoles) to micromoles of the β3 A-domain or its mutants; n refers to the number of binding sites; K is the equilibrium association constant, and [L] is the free Ca2+ or Mn2+ concentration. The best fit curves of the data points did not improve statistically when equations for two site models were used. The data obtained from this analysis are summarized in Table 1 and confirm that wild-type β3 A-domain and mutant D217A bound two Ca2+ ions, although D126A and D119A mutants have single Ca2+-binding sites. Analysis of the Mn2+-binding isotherms verified that the wild-type β3 A-domain has three Mn2+-binding sites, and each of the three mutant fragments has only two Mn2+-binding sites (Table 1). Thus, the wild-type β3 A-domain contains three Mn2+- and two Ca2+-binding sites. The Mn2+-selective site must be the LIMBS because disabling this site had no effect on Ca2+ binding but did reduce the Mn2+-binding sites from three to two. The affinities of the sites derived by nonlinear regression analysis of the binding isotherms are also summarized in Table 1. The affinities of the wild-type and D217A fragments for Ca2+ are similar, consistent with the inability of the LIMBS to bind Ca2+ although the D119A and D126A had lower affinities. The binding affinities of the wild-type and mutant β3 A-domains for Mn2+ are similar and higher than for Ca2+.TABLE 1Apparent dissociation constants of β3 A-domain fragments for Ca2+ and Mn2+β3 A-domainCationmol/molKDμMWild-typeCa2+2.05 ± 0.2945.0 ± 15D119A1.22 ± 0.21124 ± 26D126A1.31 ± 0.16139 ± 37D217A1.95 ± 0.3336.5 ± 22Wild-typeMn2+2.77 ± 416.1 ± 0.5D119A1.71 ± 236.5 ± 0.4D126A2.05 ± 316.0 ± 0.5D217A2.05 ± 195.5 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab Additional equilibrium dialysis experiments were performed to determine the specificity of the cation-binding sites for Mg2+. The β3 A-domains were incubated with 500 μm 45Ca2+ in the presence of variable concentrations of Mg2+ (0-100 mm). As shown in Fig. 3A, of the two Ca2+-binding sites in the wild-type β3 A-domain, Mg2+ could only displace Ca2+ from one of these two sites. To determine which of the two Ca2+-binding sites does not bind Mg2+, similar experiments were performed with the MIDAS and ADMIDAS mutants, which only have a single Ca2+-binding site. The one Ca2+ bound to the ADMIDAS D126A mutant was displaced by Mg2+. In contrast, Mg2+ was unable to displace the Ca2+ ion bound to the MIDAS D119A mutant. Hence, the ADMIDAS has specificity for Ca2+ as well as for Mn2+ but not for Mg2+. To determine the specificity of the cation-binding sites for Mn2+, additional equilibrium dialysis experiments were performed. The β3 A-domains were incubated with 500 μm 45Ca2+ in the presence of Mn2+ ranging from 0 to 1 mm. As shown in Fig. 3B, Mn2+ competed with Ca2+ for both Ca2+-binding sites. Similarly, to study the effect of Ca2+ on Mn2+ binding, equilibrium dialysis was performed in the presence of 45MnCl2 (50 μm) sufficient to saturate cation-binding sites in the β3 A-domain fragments, and serial dilutions of Ca2+ in the range of 0 to 10 mm were added. As depicted in Fig. 3C, Ca2+ was able to replace only two of the three bound Mn2+. Fibrinogen Recognition by Intact Receptors, αIIbβ3, αvβ3, and the β3 A-domain by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)—SPR was used to examine and quantify the interactions of fibrinogen with the two β3 integrins and the β3 A-domain fragments in real time. In the initial experiments, fibrinogen at various concentrations was injected over the αIIbβ3 immobilized onto the biosensor chip by amine coupling, and the binding kinetics were measured. The dissociation constant (KD), calculated from the measured kon and koff rate constants, was 3.3 × 10−9 m in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+ + 1mm Mg2+ (see Table 2). This value is consistent with estimates of the KD of this interaction by SPR (36Huber W. Hurst J. Schlatter D. Barner R. Hübscher J. Kouns W.C. Steiner B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and other methods (27Phillips D.R. Baughan A.K. J. Biol.

A reduction in Ca2+ concentration to 0.1 mm or an increase to 3.0 mm led to a modest decrease in fibrinogen binding affinity compared with the 1.0 mm Ca2+ condition. When interaction of fibrinogen with αvβ3 was tested by the same approach, it showed lower binding affinity than that for αIIbβ3 at 1.0 mm Ca2+ (Table 2). As described before (28Smith J.W.

Its affinity for fibrinogen was maximal at 0.1 mm Ca2+ and was reduced significantly at 3.0 mm Ca2+ (Table 2). The inhibitory effect of increasing Ca2+ on fibrinogen binding to αvβ3 was due primarily to a decrease in the kon.TABLE 2Binding constants for the interaction of fibrinogen with αiibβ3 and αvβ3 measured by SPRCoupled proteinLigandCationkon (1/ms)koff (1/s)Kd (m)Type[mm]1αiibβ3FibrinogenCa2+, Mg2+0.13.63 × 1054.79 × 10−31.32 × 10−8Ca2+, Mg2+1.03.10 × 1051.02 × 10−33.29 × 10−9Ca2+3.03.17 × 1042.15 × 10−36.78 × 10−82αvβ3FibrinogenCa2+, Mg2+0.12.15 × 1051.21 × 10−35.62 × 10−9Ca2+, Mg2+1.01.37 × 1051.92 × 10−31.40 × 10−8Ca2+3.04.60 × 1031.59 × 10−33.46 × 10−7 Open table in a new tab Next, we performed SPR experiments with the β3 A-domain immobilized onto the biosensor chip and various concentrations of fibrinogen as the solute at either low (0.1 mm) or high (3.0 mm) Ca2+ concentrations. For simplicity, data are presented at a single fibrinogen concentration in Fig. 4. As fibrinogen was injected over the immobilized A-domain, the response (RU) decreased when the calcium concentration was increased from 0.1 to 3.0 mm. The dissociation constant (KD), derived from the rate constants of dissociation and association, was calculated at five different fibrinogen concentrations. The KD was 2.1 × 10−7 m at 0.1 mm Ca2+ and decreased by approximately 1 order of magnitude to KD = 2.7 × 10−6 m in the presence of 1.0 mm Ca2+. When the binding affinity was measured at 3.0 mm Ca2+, the KD was further decreased to 6.9 × 10−5 m. The extent of fibrinogen binding at 3.0 mm Ca2+ was similar to the binding observed in the presence of EDTA (data not shown). The change in KD with increasing Ca2+ arose from a decrease in the kon rate constant for fibrinogen binding to the β3 A-domain as was observed"

The reporter assay deployed a simple and robust protocol for the rapid detection of estrogenic effects within a 96-well microplate format. Results were expressed as effective concentrations (EC50) and correlated to other yeast based and cell line assays. Tibolone and its metabolites exerted clear estrogenic effects, though considerably less potent than all other natural and synthetic compounds. For the blood serum of two volunteers, considerable higher total estrogenic bioactivity than single estradiol concentrations as determined by immunoassay was found. Visualization of a hERalpha/GFP fusion protein in yeast revealed a sub cellular cytosolic localization.

PAs have thus emerged as valuable new tools to study intracellular protein function, to delineate novel components of biochemical path-ways, and to discover and validate new therapeutic targets. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of PA-mediated inhibition of their target proteins. To determine the molecular basis of the inhibitory action of PAs, we generated PAs that bind to the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) core protein. We found that PAs efficiently blocked viral replication by coaggregating and translocating the DHBV core protein into cellular aggresomes. As a result, the cytoplasm was cleared from soluble core protein. This shows that PAs can act as effective antiviral agents through depriving a virus of essential factors for life cycle progression. Further analyses of bioactive PAs binding to the hepatitis B virus (HBV) core or to the human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 protein indicate that the specific translocation of target proteins into cellular aggresomes represents a general mechanism for the inhibitory action of PAs. Peptide Aptamers and Plasmids—Peptide aptamer screening was performed as described previously, using yeast test strain KF-1 (11Butz K. Denk C. Ullmann A. Scheffner M. Hoppe-Seyler F. Proc. Natl.

The DHBV core (amino acids 1-180) protein was expressed as a Gal4BD fusion protein from pBIND. Individual peptide aptamers were linked to the transcriptional activation domain of the HSV-1 VP16 protein, in pACT. Reporter plasmid pG5luc contains the firefly luciferase gene under the transcriptional control of five Gal4-binding sites. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection, and luciferase activities were measured as described (13Butz K. Denk C. Fitscher B. Crnkovic-Mertens I. Ullmann A. Schröder C.H. Hoppe-Seyler F.

Knaust A. Zachmann-Brand B. Schaller H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1968-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and pcDNA3DHBVc codes for the full-length DHBV core protein. Exponentially growing LMH cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of pcD16 or 3 μg of pcDNA3DHBVc, respectively, together with 3 μg of pRc/cytomegalovirus (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands) expressing individual peptides in the context of the TrxA scaffold. The TrxA scaffold sequence was fused 3′ to the HSV VP22 gene and 5′ to a His6 tag. In addition, 0.5 μg of the β-galactosidase construct CMV-Gal was added, serving as internal control to account for possible variations in transfection efficiency. Analysis for nucleocapsid particles was performed essentially as described (13Butz K. Denk C. Fitscher B. Crnkovic-Mertens I. Ullmann A. Schröder C.H. Hoppe-Seyler F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6579-6586Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 21Calvert J. Summers J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2084-2090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 3 days after transfection and lysed in 50 mm Tris pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40 for 5 min at 37 °C. The lysate was centrifuged and, after adjustment of transfection efficiencies through the determination of β-galactosidase activities, the supernatant was analyzed on a non-denaturing 1% agarose gel in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). Core particles were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany), using rabbit anti-DHBVcore antibody D103. Core particle-associated viral nucleic acids were released from the core particles in situ as described (21Calvert J. Summers J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2084-2090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and hybridized with radioactively labeled DHBV DNA (BamHI-EcoRI fragment from pcD16). For detection of secreted DHBV virions, LMH cells were transfected on a 10-cm dish with 5 μg of pcD16, 10 μg of the respective aptamer expression vector, and 1 μg of pSEAP as internal standard. After 8 days, cell culture medium was collected and up to 2.5 ml (adjusted according to secreted alkaline phosphate values) were loaded onto a CsCl/sucrose gradient, consisting (from bottom to top) of three layers of 0.5 ml of CsCl with refractive indexes of 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4, respectively, and one layer of 0.5 ml 20% sucrose. After centrifugation at 49,000 r.p.m. for 5 h at 20 °C in an AH 650 rotor (Kendro, Hanau, Germany), 12 fractions of 200 μl each were collected from the bottom of the tube using a Beckman Fraction Recovery System (Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, Germany). Individual fractions were tested for the presence of DHBV DNA by a dot blot analysis. Analysis of Soluble and Insoluble Protein Fractions—Extracts were prepared essentially as described by Johnston et al. (22Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). Briefly, for hepadnaviral core detection, Huh7 cells were transfected on a 10-cm dish with either 2 μg of DHBV vector pcD16 or 2 μg of HBV vector pd24 (13Butz K. Denk C. Fitscher B. Crnkovic-Mertens I. Ullmann A. Schröder C.H. Hoppe-Seyler F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6579-6586Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), together with 10 μg of individual PA expression plasmids and 0.5 μg of pCMV-Gal as internal control. Cells were lysed for 30 min on ice with 250 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 150 mm NaCl). Soluble and insoluble protein fractions were separated by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min. Pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl and 1% SDS for 10 min at room temperature. After the addition of 200 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer, samples were sonicated for 20 s with a tip sonicator. For immunoblotting, cell fractions were normalized for β-galactosidase activities, separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blot using rabbit anti-DHBV core antibody D103, anti-HBV core antibody H801, anti-His antibody (23Zentgraf H. Frey M. Schwinn S. Tessmer C. Willemann B. Samstag Y. Velhagen I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3347-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), or anti-α-tubulin antibody CP06 (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany). Confocal and Electron Microscopy—For confocal microscopy, cells were grown on coverslips, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphatebuffered saline for 5 min. The following primary antibodies were used for immunostaining: anti-vimentin V9 (Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany), anti-γ-tubulin GTU-88 (Sigma), anti-DHBV core antibody D103, and anti-His antibody (23Zentgraf H. Frey M. Schwinn S. Tessmer C. Willemann B. Samstag Y. Velhagen I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3347-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For nocodazole treatment, 10 μg/ml nocodazole (Sigma) was added to the culture medium 20 h before fixation. For electron microscopy, cells were grown on glass coverslips and fixed for 1 h with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) at 4 °C. After washing in 50 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, the cells were post-fixed in 2% osmium tetroxide and, subsequently, 0.5% aqueous uranyl-acetate, dehydrated through ascending alcohol concentrations and propylene oxide, and embedded in Epon. Ultrathin sections of the fixed cells were cut with a Reichert-Jung microtome and examined with a Zeiss EM 10A transmission electron microscope. The magnification indicator was routinely controlled by using a grating replica. Isolation of Peptide Aptamers Specifically Binding to the DHBV Core Protein—To identify PAs that bind to the DHBV core protein, a yeast two-hybrid interaction screen was performed, using the N-terminal 180 amino acids of DHBV core as bait. As prey, a PA expression library with high complexity was employed in which variable 20-amino acid peptide domains were expressed in the context of the E. coli TrxA protein scaffold (11Butz K.

Ullmann A. Schröder C.H. Hoppe-Seyler F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6579-6586Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Screening was performed using yeast strain KF-1, which contains three selectable growth markers: GAL2-ADE2, GAL1-HIS3, and SPO13-URA3 (11Butz K. Denk C. Ullmann A. Scheffner M. Hoppe-Seyler F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6693-6697Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). From 3.8 × 106 different transformants, we isolated 250 clones that activated both the ADE2 and the HIS3 markers. Among these, 64 also stimulated the URA3 marker, which is only activated by relatively strong protein-protein interactions (11Butz K. Denk C. Ullmann A. Scheffner M. Hoppe-Seyler F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6693-6697Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Binding of these 64 PAs was specific for DHBV core since all PAs did not interact with control proteins, with the exception of PA13, which also bound to the HBV core protein in addition to the DHBV core protein (Table 1). Peptide Aptamer-induced Inhibition of DHBV Capsid Formation and Replication—The 64 PAs that also activated the URA3 marker in yeast were tested in viral replication assays (13Butz K. Denk C.

Wu T.T. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3249-3258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for their ability to interfere with DHBV capsid formation. Since cellular expression levels of TrxA scaffolds presenting different peptide moieties can greatly vary (not shown), individual PAs were expressed as fusions to the HSV-1 VP22 protein (11Butz K.

Ullmann A. Schröder C.H. Hoppe-Seyler F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6579-6586Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This allows the expression of high intracellular PA amounts and results in comparable expression levels for different core-targeting and control PAs. Following transfection of pcD16, a plasmid expressing a replication-competent DHBV RNA pregenome (20Mabit H. Breiner K.M. Knaust A. Zachmann-Brand B. Schaller H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1968-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), avian LMH hepatoma cells were lysed, and the amounts of newly formed DHBV capsids were determined (13Butz K. Denk C. Fitscher B.

Virol. 1994; 68: 2084-2090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Coexpression of most PAs did not significantly affect the concentrations of viral capsids (e.g. PA20). Notably, however, PA34 strongly reduced the amounts of newly formed DHBV capsids to almost undetectable levels (Fig. 1A). Corresponding results were obtained in human Huh-7 hepatoma cells (not shown). Viral nucleic acids were released from the capsids in situ and analyzed on the same filters with a DHBV DNA probe, showing that PA34 also strongly reduced the amounts of core particle-associated DHBV nucleic acids (Fig. 1B). Hepadnaviral core proteins are able to undergo self-assembly into capsids in the absence of additional viral gene products (25Zhou S. Standring D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10046-10050Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, PA34 also efficiently reduced the amounts of self-assembled viral capsids to almost undetectable levels. Furthermore, in line with its strong inhibitory effects on capsid assembly, PA34 virtually completely extinguished the secretion of DHBV virions when compared with control aptamers (Fig. 1D). PA34 did not exert any detectable nonspecific toxic effect on the cells since neither the activities of cotransfected β-galactosidase reporter plasmids nor the core transcript levels were affected, and colony formation assays yielded equal colony numbers for PA34- and control-transfected LMH or Huh-7 cells (not shown). To corroborate that PA34 can bind to DHBV core in higher eukaryotic cells, we coexpressed a GAL4BD-core fusion protein together with different peptide aptamers, linked to the VP16 transcriptional activation domain of HSV-1. Under these conditions, the activity of a cotransfected luciferase reporter plasmid, which is under the transcriptional control of GAL4 recognition sites, depends on the interaction of the fusion proteins (13Butz K. Denk C. Fitscher B. Crnkovic-Mertens I. Ullmann A. Schröder C.H. Hoppe-Seyler F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6579-6586Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In contrast to control PAs, PA34 clearly activated the luciferase reporter in LMH or HeLa cells (Fig. 1E), indicating that it can also interact with the DHBV core protein inside avian and mammalian cells. Detection of Intracellular Peptide Aptamer/Core Protein Aggregates—To obtain closer insights into the mechanism of PA-mediated target protein inhibition, we investigated the effects of PAs at the cellular level by confocal microscopy. Coexpression of a control PA (such as 16E730, not binding to the core protein) with the DHBV core protein in Huh-7 cells resulted in a mainly cytoplasmic staining for both proteins, with no overlap of the signals (Fig. 2, A-D). Expression of PA34 alone also led to a predominantly cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 2F). When compared with the core protein, both PAs were less homogeneously distributed in the cytoplasm when expressed alone, and some of the signals concentrated in small distinct spots (Fig. 2, C and F). Strikingly, however, coexpression of core-binding PA34 together with DHBV core resulted in a dramatic relocalization of the core protein, changing from its diffuse cytoplasmic staining pattern (Fig. 2B) to the emergence of large and intensely stained perinuclear inclusion bodies (Fig. 2H). PA34 and the core protein colocalized within these structures (Fig. 2, G-J). Corresponding experiments performed in LMH cells yielded identical results (not shown). Treatment of the cells with the microtubule-destabilizing agent nocodazole prohibited formation of the large perinuclear inclusion bodies and resulted in the emergence of small dispersed cytoplasmic foci in which PA34 and the core protein colocalized (Fig. 2, K-N). To extend these investigations to an unrelated PA binding to a different target, we analyzed E61-1, a previously isolated PA that specifically binds to the HPV16 E6 oncoprotein (11Butz K. Denk C. Ullmann A. Scheffner M. Hoppe-Seyler F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6693-6697Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Due to the lack of reliable E6 antibodies for intracellular detection, we expressed the HPV16 E6 protein as green fluorescent protein fusion, which, as assumed for E6, preferentially localizes to the nucleus due to nuclear localization signals within the HPV16 E6 protein (26Tao M. Kruhlak M. Xia S. Androphy E. Zheng Z.-M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 13232-13247Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In line with this, expression of EGFP-16E6 in HeLa cells resulted in a predominantly nuclear signal in the presence of a coexpressed PA34, which served as negative control (Fig. 3, A-D). In stark contrast, coexpression of the E6-binding PA E61-1 resulted in a relocalization of EGFP-16E6 to prominent perinuclear inclusions in which both interaction partners colocalized (Fig. 3, E-H), as shown for the PA34/core interaction (Fig. 2, G-J). PA34 Translocates the Viral Core Protein into Aggresomes—Next, we aimed at elucidating the nature of the perinuclear structures in which the PA34/core complexes accumulated. In immunofluorescence studies, we did not detect costaining with a series of different endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi markers (data not shown). Electron microscopy revealed that the coexpression of PA34 and core induced massive perinuclear accumulations of closely packed electron-dense particles in the vicinity of mitochondria clusters (Fig. 4A). This picture is reminiscent of the ultrastructure of aggresomes, which are juxtanuclear inclusion bodies that accumulate protein aggregates (22Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar, 27Garcia-Mata R. Bebök Z. Sorscher E.J. Sztul E.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1239-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Typically, aggresomes contain individual dense particles of ∼40-90 nm in diameter and are surrounded by bundles of filamentous material (22Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar, 27Garcia-Mata R. Bebök Z. Sorscher E.J. Sztul E.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1239-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, the perinuclear inclusion bodies formed upon PA34/core coexpression contained rodlike to spherical, membrane-free particles of ∼45-65 nm in diameter. As shown at higher magnification, they were wrapped by roughly parallel bundles of filaments of 6-10 nm in diameter, in the periphery (Fig. 4B). To further corroborate that PA34 translocates the viral core protein to aggresomes, we examined the expression pattern of vimentin by confocal microscopy. Typically, this intermediate filament is radically reorganized during aggresome formation, changing from long filamentous structures extending into the periphery of the cell to cage-like structures wrapped around the exterior of the aggresome (22Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar, 27Garcia-Mata R. Bebök Z. Sorscher E.J. Sztul E.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1239-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). We observed dramatic redistributions of the vimentin network upon PA34/core coexpression, forming a cage-like structure around the inclusion body (Fig. 5, A-D). Furthermore, costaining for the pericentriolar matrix protein γ-tubulin (Figs. 5, E-H) revealed that the pA34/core-containing inclusion bodies typically localized to the microtubule-organizing center, consistent with the preferentially pericentriolar localization of aggresomes (22Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar, 27Garcia-Mata R. Bebök Z. Sorscher E.J. Sztul E.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1239-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Intracellular Depletion of Soluble Target Proteins by PAs—These findings indicate that PAs can block viral replication by specific sequestration of the core protein into aggresomes. Since aggresomal protein aggregates are detergent-insoluble (22Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar), expression of PA34 should redistribute the DHBV core protein from the detergent-soluble to the detergent-insoluble protein fraction of the cell. When expressed in the absence of its target protein, PA34 accumulated in the detergent-insoluble protein fraction, in Huh-7 cells (Fig. 6A). We then coexpressed individual PAs together with the core protein from pcD16. The DHBV core protein was detected exclusively in the detergentsoluble protein fraction, when coexpressed with negative control peptide aptamers, such as 16E730 (Fig. 6A) or C1-1 (not shown). In contrast, when coexpressed with PA34, a substantial portion of the DHBV core protein shifted to the detergentinsoluble protein fraction after 1 day, and after 2 days, it was almost exclusively found in the insoluble protein fraction (Fig. 6A). Next, we investigated whether this mechanism generally applies to PAs targeting the core protein of hepadnaviruses. To this end, we analyzed C1-1, an unrelated PA that specifically binds to the HBV core protein (13Butz K. Denk C. Fitscher B. Crnkovic-Mertens I. Ullmann A. Schröder C.H. Hoppe-Seyler F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6579-6586Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). As found for the PA34/DHBV core interaction, coexpression of C1-1 with the HBV core protein also induced a virtually complete sequestration of the HBV core protein into the insoluble cellular protein fraction (Fig. 6B). In contrast, HBV core remained in the soluble protein fraction upon coexpression of PA34, which served as negative control in this setting. These results show that corebinding PAs block replication of different hepadnaviruses by efficiently depleting the intracellular pool of soluble core protein in a target-specific manner. Although a series of studies have shown that PAs can interfere with the intracellular function of their target proteins, little is known about the underlying biochemical mechanism. The present work shows that inhibitory PAs can block the activity of proteins by efficiently inducing their sequestration into aggresomes. Aggresomes are large perinuclear inclusion bodies into which the cell collects aggregated proteins, possibly to avoid the accumulation of potentially toxic protein aggregates in the cytoplasm (28Kopito R.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 524-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar, 29Garcia-Mata R. Gao Y.-S. Sztul E.S. Traffic. 2002; 3: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Several observations indicate that the large perinuclear structures, to which the PA34 and the core protein translocate, represent bona fide aggresomes. This includes their typical ultrastructural morphology, their pericentriolar localization, and their characteristic vimentin caging. Moreover, since aggresomes are formed by a pathway involving dynein/dynactin-mediated retrograde transport on microtubules (27Garcia-Mata R. Bebök Z. Sorscher E.J. Sztul E.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1239-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), their formation is prevented by treatment with the microtubule-destabilizing agent nocodazole, as found for the PA34/core containing inclusion bodies. In principle, the screening method employed for the generation of PAs should result in a collection of molecules that bind to many different surface regions on the target protein, thereby potentially blocking the binding of natural interaction partners to distinct domains of the target protein. In indirect support of this idea, a Cdk2-binding PA has been shown to block Cdk2-mediated phosphorylation of histone H1 but not of pRb, suggesting that it binds to a region that is crucial for the interaction with H1 but not with pRb (7Cohen B.A. Colas P. Brent R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14272-14277Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Similarly, a PA targeting the intracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor did not generally inhibit its tyrosine kinase activity but selectively interfered with the phosphorylation of certain tyrosine residues only (15Buerger C. Nagel-Wolfrum K. Kunz C. Wittig I. Butz K. HoppeSeyler F. Groner B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37610-37621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus, PAs should not only be useful as molecular tools for the intracellular inhibition of proteins but may also serve to map therapeutically relevant surface domains on the target protein for the development of non-peptide mimetics (5Colas P. Drug Discov. Today. 2006; 11: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The present work defines a novel, but not mutually exclusive, mechanism by which PAs block the activities of their target proteins. It is compatible with the following scenario. Expression of a PA alone, such as the core-binding PA34, leads to an accumulation of the PA in the detergent-insoluble cellular protein fraction, indicating an intrinsic tendency for PAs to aggregate. In contrast, the DHBV core protein is expressed as a soluble, largely cytoplasmic protein. Upon PA34/core coexpression, the interaction partners coaggregate and are transported on microtubules into aggresomes, accounting for the dramatic intracellular redistribution of the viral core protein. Notably, treatment with nocodazole resulted in dispersed foci in which PA34 and the core protein colocalized, indicating that PA34 and core can coaggregate at conditions where aggresome formation is suppressed. The aggresome formation induced by the PA34/core interaction was highly efficient and did not require treatment with proteasome inhibitors, which are widely used to increase the formation of cellular aggresomes (30Wyttenbach A. Carmichael J. Swartz J. Furlong R.A. Narain Y. Rankin J. Rubinsztein D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2898-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). As a consequence, PA34 induced a virtually complete shift of the DHBV core protein from the detergent-soluble into the detergent-insoluble cellular protein fraction, where it is no longer available for viral capsid formation. The PA34/core coaggregation could be supported by two features of PAs, namely their intrinsic tendency to aggregate, as shown here, and their ability to strongly bind to a specific target protein at intracellular conditions (6Colas P. Cohen B. Jessen T. Grishina I. McCoy J. Brent R. Nature. 1996; 380: 548-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The PA-mediated sequestration of the core protein into the detergent-insoluble protein fraction indicates that aggregated PAs do not necessarily adopt a completely non-native structure. Indeed, such partial aggregations have been proposed previously for other proteins (“native coaggregation”), indicating that binding partners of multidomain proteins can be sequestered into aggregates through their interaction with the native domain of aggregated proteins (31Rajan R.S. Illing M.E. Bence N.F. Kopito R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13060-13065Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The efficacy of PA-mediated inhibition of DHBV replication is striking. We found that PA34 leads to an almost complete clearance of the soluble core protein from the cytoplasm and, consequently, to a dramatic reduction of the viral capsid concentration and virion production to virtually undetectable levels. The corresponding results obtained for a PA targeting the HBV core protein indicate that the PA-induced removal of soluble intracellular core protein can be employed as a general antiviral strategy against hepadnaviruses. Notably, the effects of individual PAs were highly selective for their respective target proteins in that PA34 specifically removed the DHBV core but not HBV core protein from the soluble intracellular protein fraction, whereas C1-1 cleared the HBV core but not DHBV core protein. Moreover, the PA-mediated translocation of bound proteins into aggresomes is not restricted to structural proteins of hepadnaviruses, as indicated by the analysis of a bioactive PA targeting the HPV E6 protein, and should be useful as a general strategy for the targeted inhibition of intracellular proteins. We are grateful to Prof. H. Schaller and Dr. C. Kuhn for the generous gift of plasmid pcD16 and anti-core antibodies and to Prof. M. Scheffner for the EGFP-16E6 expression vector.

https://openalex.org/W2030648035,"Retinoic acid receptors (RARs) are the molecular relays of retinoid action on transcription, cellular differentiation and apoptosis. Transcriptional activation of retinoid-regulated promoters requires the dismissal of corepressors and the recruitment of coactivators to promoter-bound RAR. RARs recruit <i>in vitro</i> a plethora of coactivators whose actual contribution to retinoid-induced transcription is poorly characterized <i>in vivo.</i> Embryonal carcinoma P19 cells, which are highly sensitive to retinoids, were depleted from archetypical coactivators by RNAi. SRC1-deficient P19 cells showed severely compromised retinoid-induced responses, in agreement with the supposed role of SRC1 as a RAR coactivator. Unexpectedly, Med1/TRAP220/DRIP205-depleted cells exhibited an exacerbated response to retinoids, both in terms transcriptional responses and of cellular differentiation. Med1 depletion affected TFIIH and cdk9 detection at the prototypical retinoid-regulated RARβ2 promoter, and favored a higher RNA polymerase II detection in transcribed regions of the <i>RAR</i>β<i>2</i> gene. Furthermore, the nature of the ligand impacted strongly on the ability of RARs to interact with a given coactivator and to activate transcription in intact cells. Thus RAR accomplishes transcriptional activation as a function of the ligand structure, by recruiting regulatory complexes which control distinct molecular events at retinoid-regulated promoters."

A nearly complete removal of N-glycans of the recombinant C6ST-1 by peptide N-glycosidase F increased the C6ST activity but decreased the KSST activity. Among six potential N-glycosylation sites, deletion of the fourth or sixth site from the amino terminus inhibited production of the active C6ST-1, whereas deletion of the fifth site resulted in a marked loss of the KSST activity. Wild-type recombinant C6ST-1 showed a typical Golgi localization, whereas M-4 recombinant C6ST-1, in which the fourth N-glycosylation site was deleted, colocalized with calnexin, an endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein. Unlike wildtype recombinant C6ST-1, M-4 recombinant C6ST-1 showed a weak affinity toward wheat germ agglutinin and was converted completely to the nonglycosylated form by endoglycosidase H. These observations suggest that N-glycan attached to the fourth N-glycosylation site may function in the proper processing of N-glycans required for the Golgi localization, thereby causing the production of the active C6ST-1, and that N-glycan attached to the fifth N-glycosylation site may contribute to the KSST activity of C6ST-1.

It has been reported that N-glycans contained in various glycoproteins are involved in protein folding, ER-associated protein degradation, intracellular trafficking, and production of functional proteins (21.Parodi A.J.

We have previously shown that N-glycans attached to C4ST-1 are involved in the production and stability of the active enzyme (26.Yusa A. Kitajima K. Habuchi O. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, functional roles of N-glycans attached to these sulfotransferases has not been fully understood. In the present study, we examined the roles of N-glycans attached to C6ST-1 and found that N-glycans on C6ST-1 affected the intracellular localization and thereby the production of the active enzyme. We also found unexpectedly that one of the N-glycans is required for the sulfotransferase activity of C6ST-1 toward KS.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The following commercial materials were used.

The first PCR was carried out using oligonucleotides mC6ST-1-F1 (CACCTGAAGAGGGCTGATTG) and mC6ST-1-R1 (TGGGTGTGAGGGAAG), which were synthesized according to the sequence of the mC6ST-1 cDNA clone (GenBank™ accession number AB008937), as primers and the QUICK-Clone™ cDNA derived from mouse adult spleen (Clontech) as a template. Amplification was carried out by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 5.5 min. The second PCR was carried out using oligonucleotides mC6ST-1-F2 (GACGAATTCGATGGAGAAAGGACTCGC) and mC6ST-1-R2 (GCAAAGCTTCTACGTGACCCAGAAGGTGCG) as primers and the first PCR mixture as the template.

The amplified DNA band was cut out, and the DNA fragment was recovered from the gel, digested with HindIII and EcoRI, and subcloned into these sites of pFLAG-CMV-2 plasmid. Recombinant mC6ST-1 was expressed in COS-7 cells as a fusion protein with FLAG peptide and was affinity-purified as described below. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by PCR using a QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Putative N-glycosylation sites, the Asn-X-(Ser/Thr) motif, in which X is any amino acid except for Pro, were disrupted by substituting asparagine (Asn63, Asn74, Asn96, Asn250, Asn413, and Asn457) with serine. The nucleotide sequences of all of the mutated cDNAs were confirmed by the sequencing. The sequences of all of the PCR primers used for the site-directed mutagenesis are shown in Table 1.

CHO-K1 cells were cultured in F-12 medium containing the antibiotics and fetal bovine serum as above. These cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air. The plasmids prepared as above were transfected into COS-7 cells or CHO-K1 cells by the lipofection method using TransFast® reagent (Promega) under serum-free conditions according to the manufacturer's instructions. At 48 h after the addition of cDNA, the transfectants were extracted with 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and protease inhibitors (50 μm TLCK, 30 μm TPCK, 300 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 3 μm pepstatin A) for 30 min on a rotatory shaker. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were applied to an anti-FLAG mAb-conjugated agarose column. The absorbed materials were eluted with a buffer containing FLAG peptide under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. The purified protein solution (1.5 ml) was used to determine C6ST and KSST activity. Under the standard assay conditions, C6ST activity of the affinity-purified wild-type recombinant C6ST-1 ranged from 100 to 500 pmol/min/ml among different preparations. The KSST activity of each preparation was ∼30% of C6ST activity.Treatment with Tunicamycin—To determine the effects of tunicamycin, tunicamycin was added to the culture medium after transfection at the final concentrations indicated in Fig. 1, and the culture was continued for a further 48 h. The cellular extracts were prepared as described above.Western Blot Analysis—SDS-PAGE was carried out according to Laemmli (30.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205964) Google Scholar). The affinity-purified proteins before or after PNGase F or Endo H digestion as described below were boiled in the sample buffer with 10% (w/v) 2-mercaptoethanol and then separated by 10% gels. Proteins were electorophoretically transferred to Hybond ECL® membranes (Amersham Biosciences) at 60 V for 4 h. For immunoblotting, nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% (w/v) skim milk in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 130 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) at 4 °C for 16 h. The FLAG-tagged recombinant proteins were stained with an anti-FLAG M2 mAb at a 1:10,000 dilution. The blots were developed with polyclonal anti-mouse IgG antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase at a dilution of 1:8000 using an ECL detection kit and a Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Molecular masses of polypeptides were calculated from the migration distance of a molecular mass standard (Sigma) or a prestained standard (Nakarai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) run in every gel. Protein bands in Hybond ECL® membrane were visualized by Amido Black staining. Amounts of FLAG-tagged fusion proteins were estimated by immunoblotting of these proteins together with FLAG-tagged bacterial alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) as a standard as described previously (31.Itano N. Sawai T. Yoshida M. Lenas P. Yamada Y. Imagawa M. Shinomura T. Hamaguchi M. Yoshida Y. Ohnuki Y. Miyauchi S. Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. Kimata K. J. Biol.

The column was washed with 2.5 ml of the same buffer. The absorbed materials were eluted with 2.5 ml of 0.5 m Glc-NAc in the buffer. The column was further eluted with 2.5 ml of 1.0 m NaCl in the buffer. All fractions were used to determine the C6ST activity.Assay of Sulfotransferase Activity—C6ST activity and KSST activity were assayed by the method described previously (18.Habuchi O. Matsui Y. Kotoya Y. Aoyama Y. Yasuda Y. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21968-21974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Habuchi O. Hirahara Y. Uchimura K. Fukuta M. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture contained, in a final volume of 50 μl, 2.5 μmol of imidazole-HCl, pH 6.8 (for C6ST activity) or pH 6.4 (for KSST activity), 1.25 μg (for C6ST activity) or 3.75 μg (for KSST activity) of protamine chloride, 0.1 μmol of dithiothreitol, 25 nmol (as glucuronic acid) of chondroitin (for C6ST activity) or 25 nmol (as GlcNAc) of KS (for KSST activity), 50 pmol of [35S]PAPS (∼5.0 × 105 cpm), and enzymes. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, and the reaction was stopped by immersing the reaction tubes in a boiling water bath for 1 min. After the reaction was stopped, 35S-labeled glycosaminoglycans were isolated by precipitation with ethanol, followed by gel chromatography with a fast desalting column, as described previously (18.Habuchi O. Matsui Y. Kotoya Y. Aoyama Y. Yasuda Y. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21968-21974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and radioactivity was determined. To determine C4ST and C6ST activity, 35S-labeled chondroitin was digested with chondroitinase ACII, and the unsaturated disaccharides (2-acetamide-2-deoxy-3-O-(β-d-gluco-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-d-galactose and 2-acetamide-2-deoxy-3-O-(β-d-gluco-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-6-O-sulfo-d-galactose) were separated by paper chromatography, and the radioactivity was counted as described (18.Habuchi O. Matsui Y. Kotoya Y. Aoyama Y. Yasuda Y. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21968-21974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the Vmax for PAPS, chondroitin, and KS, the sulfotransferase activity of the recombinant proteins was normalized by the density of the protein bands on the Western blot detected by anti-FLAG antibody. To determine C6ST activity in the presence of KS, the 35S-labeled glycosaminoglycans were digested with chondroitinase ABC, and the resulting unsaturated disaccharides were separated from KS by ethanol precipitation as described above. The radioactivity of the ethanol-soluble fractions was determined.Digestion with PNGase F, Endo H, Chondroitinase ACII, Chondroitinase ABC, and Keratanase II—The affinity-purified recombinant C6ST-1 with or without mutations was precipitated with 3 volumes of ethanol containing 1.3% (w/v) potassium acetate. The precipitates were dissolved in 4 μl of buffer 1 (0.5% SDS and 0.15 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8) for PNGase F digestion or 4 μl of buffer 2 (0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, 0.05% SDS, 0.2 m 2-mercaptoethanol) for Endo H digestion and heated at 100 °C for 2 min. After cooling, 4 μl of buffer 3 (3.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4% Nonidet P-40, and 32 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) including 0.5 units of PNGase F or 5 milliunits of Endo H were added to the mixture and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. After digestion, the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE as described above. Digestion of the recombinant protein with PNGase F under nondenaturing conditions was carried out at 37 °C in the buffer used for the extraction of the cells as described above. Digestion with chondroitinase ACII or chondroitinase ABC was carried out for 4 h at 37°C in the reaction mixture containing, in a final volume of 25 μl, 1.25 μmol of Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.5, 2.5 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 30 milliunits of chondroitinase ACII or chondroitinase ABC. Digestion with keratanase II was carried out for 24 h at 37 °C in the reaction mixture containing, in a final volume of 50 μl, 0.005 units of keratanase II and 2.5 μmol of acetate buffer, pH 6.5 (33.Nakazawa K.

Cells were transfected as above. At 24 h after transfection, cells were fixed by ice-cold methanol for 30 min. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) several times, the cells were blocked with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (PBST) containing 5% BSA. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with a mixture of anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (1:500 dilution in 5% BSA-PBST) and anti-calnexin C terminus rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:200 dilution in 5% BSA-PBST) or a mixture of anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (1:500 dilution in 5% BSA-PBST) and anti-α-mannosidase II rabbit antiserum (1:200 dilution in 5% BSA-PBST) for 90 min. They were then washed with PBS and further incubated with Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG goat antibody (1:400 dilution in 5% BSA-PBST) and TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG goat antibody for 1 h. To stain the nucleus, Hoechst 33258 was added to the second antibody solution at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. The cells were washed with PBS, mounted in glycerol containing Mowiol® 4-88 (Calbiochem) and 1% n-propyl gallate (Sigma), and observed by an Olympus fluorescence microscope.RESULTSEffects of Tunicamycin on the Formation of the Active C6ST-1—To determine the effects of N-glycans on the generation of the active C6ST-1, we cultured COS-7 cells transfected with C6ST-1 cDNA in the medium containing various concentration of tunicamycin. In the presence of 0.05 μg/ml tunicamycin, only a protein band of 54 kDa that corresponds to the core protein without N-glycans was detected (Fig. 1B, lane 4), indicating that attachment of N-glycans to C6ST-1 was totally abolished. Under such conditions, C6ST activity was lost (Fig. 1A). These results indicate that attachment of N-glycans is essential for the generation of the active C6ST-1. In the presence of 0.01 μg/ml tunicamycin, C6ST activity was fully retained, whereas the expressed protein exhibited multiple discrete bands on the Western blot (Fig. 1B, lane 3). These discrete protein bands are thought to correspond to different glycoforms of C6ST-1 bearing different numbers of N-glycans, because these protein bands were converted to the nonglycosylated form after the PNGase F digestion (data not shown). Partial loss of N-glycans in the presence of 0.01 μg/ml of tunicamycin may not affect the production of the active C6ST-1 significantly.Treatment of the Recombinant C6ST-1 with PNGase F—To obtain information about the effect of N-glycans attached to C6ST-1 on the enzyme activity, we digested the recombinant C6ST-1 with PNGase F under the nondenaturation conditions and determined C6ST activity (Fig. 2A, open bar). The molecular mass of the recombinant C6ST-1 was also determined before or after PNGase F digestion (Fig. 2B). Before PNGase F digestion, the glycosylated protein bands were detected as a single band at 67 kDa with a diffused band larger than 67 kDa (Fig. 2B, lane 1). These protein bands disappeared after PNGase F digestion, and a main protein band of 54 kDa and a faint smear larger than 54 kDa appeared (Fig. 2B, lane 2). Because the molecular mass of the recombinant C6ST-1 calculated from the cDNA is 53996, the main protein band detected after PNGase F digestion should correspond to the core protein without N-glycans, indicating that N-glycans attached to the recombinant C6ST-1 appeared to be removed nearly completely by PNGase F digestion under the nondenaturation conditions. On the other hand, C6ST activity was not decreased but rather increased after PNGase F digestion (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that N-glycans attached to C6ST-1 are not necessarily required for C6ST activity if the active enzyme is once generated. We previously reported that C6ST-1 could transfer sulfate not only to chondroitin but also to KS. Unlike C6ST activity, the activity toward KS (KSST activity) was decreased after PNGase F digestion (Fig. 2A, closed bars). The roles of N-glycans on KSST activity will be discussed below.FIGURE 2Effects of PNGase F digestion of the recombinant C6ST-1. The affinity-purified wild-type recombinant protein was incubated in the presence or absence of PNGase F for 60 min as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and C6ST activity (A, open bar) and KSST activity (A, closed bar)of the preincubated proteins was determined. The recombinant protein was analyzed by Western blot after incubation in the absence (B, lane 1) or presence (B, lane 2) of PNGase F. Sizes of the prestained molecular size standards are indicated at the left, and the core protein of FLAG-C6ST-1 is indicated by an arrowhead.View Large Image Figure"
https://openalex.org/W1978830674,"Using an animal model of heparin-induced osteoporosis we previously demonstrated that heparin causes bone loss, in part, by increasing osteoclast number and activity. Furthermore, we found that, although heparin alone has no effect, it is able to synergistically enhance Interleukin-11 (IL-11)-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation and thus increase osteoclast formation in vitro. In the present study, we examine the effect of various serine kinase inhibitors on the ability of heparin to act synergistically with IL-11. Inhibition of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), or the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways had no effect on the ability of heparin to promote either IL-11-induced STAT3·DNA complex formation or osteoclast formation in vitro. In contrast, PD098059, a MAPK kinase inhibitor, completely abolished the synergy between heparin and IL-11. In an attempt to resolve the mechanism by which this was occurring, we examined the effect of heparin on STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (Erk1/2) activation, either in the presence or absence of IL-11. Heparin alone was found to have no effect on Ser-727 phosphorylation, nor did heparin alter the phosphorylation status of Ser-727 in the presence of IL-11. Heparin was, however, found to increase Erk1/2 activation in both a time- and dose-dependent manner. When taken together, these findings suggest that heparin enhances IL-11-induced STAT3 activation and thus osteoclast formation, by a mechanism that is independent of STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation but that involves up-regulation of the MAPK pathway.

However, little is known about the mechanism by which heparin causes bone loss. To address this issue we developed several in vitro and in vivo models with which to study the effects of heparin on bone. By using these models, we showed that heparin causes both a time- and a dose-dependent decrease in cancellous bone and that this, in part, results from an increase in osteoclast number and activity (10Muir J.

When taken together, these findings suggest that IL-11 plays a critical role in the ability of heparin to induce osteoclast formation. This finding may account for the increase in bone resorption that we observe in our animal models of heparin-induced osteoporosis. IL-11 belongs to a family of cytokines that includes IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and cardiotrophin-1 (14Paul S.R. Bennett F. Calvetti J.A. Kelleher K. Wood C.R. O'Hare R.M. Leary A.C. Sibley B. Clark S.C. Williams D.A. Yang Y.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7512-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). All members of this family display multiple effects on both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cell populations, and as such, are known to stimulate osteoclast formation both in vitro and in vivo (15Girasole G. Passeri G. Jilka R.L. Manolagas S.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1516-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 16Elias J.A. Tang W. Horowitz M.C.

Receptors for these cytokines are found on the osteoblast cell surface where they initiate signal transduction through a series of well defined steps. Thus, following binding to their respective α-chain receptors these cytokines form a tri-molecular complex with glycoprotein (gp)130 and initiate signal transduction through activation of the Janus family of tyrosine kinases (Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2) (19Kishimoto T. Taga T. Akira S. Cell. 1994; 76: 253-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar, 20Stahl N. Boulton T.G. Farruggella T. Ip N.Y. Davis S. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Silvennoinen O. Science. 1994; 263: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). This activation results in the phosphorylation of gp130 at specific tyrosine residues located within its cytoplasmic domain and creates a docking site for members of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family (20Stahl N. Boulton T.G. Farruggella T. Ip N.Y. Davis S. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Silvennoinen O. Science. 1994; 263: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Once STATs (STAT3 and STAT1) bind to gp130, they are also phosphorylated on specific tyrosine residues by Jak. Following phosphorylation, STATs form homo- or heterodimers and translocate into the nucleus where they act to promote transcription by binding to specific promoter elements within their various response genes (21Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Müller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar). Although tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs (i.e. Tyr-705) is a necessary prerequisite for the dimerization and subsequent binding of STATs to DNA, STAT activity can also be influenced by serine phosphorylation (22Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar, 23Lütticken C. Wegenka U.M. Yuan J. Buschmann J. Schindler C. Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F.

Thus, a number of studies have shown that serine phosphorylation, in particular phosphorylation of Ser-727, can enhance the ability of STATs to promote transcriptional activity (25Ng J. Cantrell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24542-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 26Schuringa J. Jonk L.J.C. Dokter W.H.A. Vellenga E. Kruijer W. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examine the mechanism by which heparin acts synergistically with IL-11 to induce both STAT3 activation and in vitro osteoclast formation. By using various serine kinase inhibitors we demonstrate that heparin enhances IL-11-induced STAT3 activation and thus, osteoclast formation, by a mechanism that is independent of STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation but involves up-regulation of the MAPK pathway. When taken together, these findings suggest a plausible mechanism by which heparin may cause bone loss when administered long-term. Materials—Thirty-day-old Swiss Webster and 15- to 17-day-old pregnant female C57 Bl/6 mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (St. Constant, Quebec, Canada). Recombinant human IL-11 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), whereas phospho-STAT3 (Ser-727) antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). All other antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Unfractionated heparin and the serine kinase inhibitors PD098059, wortmannin, SB202190, and SP600125 were all purchased from Sigma. Calvaria Cell Isolation—Calvaria cells were isolated from parietal bones as described previously (27Richards C.D. Langdon C. Deschamps P. Pennica D. Shaughnessy S.G. Cytokine. 2000; 12: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, parietal bones were isolated from 3- to 5-day-old neonatal mice under sterile conditions and cut into 2- to 4-mm2 pieces. The calvaria cells were then isolated from the pieces of parietal bone by sequential digestion with collagenase II at a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml. Isolated cells were washed by centrifugation, seeded at a concentration of ∼30,000 cells/cm2 in α-minimal essential medium (α-MEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and expanded for 7 days before use. Cell Lysis and Nuclear Extract Preparation—Calvaria cells were plated in 15-cm diameter dishes at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/plate and then incubated for 48 h in α-MEM containing 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were then cultured with various serine kinase inhibitors for 24 h before being treated with either heparin (25 μg/ml), IL-11 (20 ng/ml), or both for 20 min. They were then rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, collected using a cell scraper, pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in a hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9) containing 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Nuclear extracts were then isolated by centrifugation and lysed in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9) containing 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 25% glycerol. Following lysis, the samples were centrifuged, and a Bio-Rad protein assay was used to determine the protein concentration of the collected supernatants prior to analysis by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). EMSAs—A synthetic double-stranded synthetic consensus sequence based on the serum inducible element (SIE) of the c-fos-promoter region (5′-GTG CAT TTC CCG TAA ATC TTG TCT ACA-3′) was labeled at the 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP using polynucleotide T4 kinase. Nuclear extract (5 μg) were then incubated with 3 μg of poly(dI-dC) at 4 °C, for 15 min, before adding 100,000 cpm of radiolabeled SIE in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), containing 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 25% glycerol. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, DNA-protein complexes were run on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel, before being exposed on X-Omat AP film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY), and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Negative controls included excess unlabeled homologous SIE and a mutated SIE (5′-GTG CAT CCA CCG TAA ATC TTG TCT ACA-3′), which is unable to bind STAT3. RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Analysis—Calvaria cells were plated in 15-cm diameter dishes at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/plate and then incubated for 48 h in α-MEM containing 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were then treated for 1 h with various serine kinase inhibitors or the Jak2 inhibitor, AG490, before being cultured with either heparin (25 μg/ml), IL-11 (20 ng/ml), or a combination of both heparin and IL-11, for 24 h. Total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), run on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel, and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) prior to hybridization at 43 °C. An [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probe was created using a random primed labeling kit (Roche Diagnostics). A 734-bp PCR product corresponding to the partial coding region of gp130 was used as a probe. Membranes were exposed on Kodak X-Omat AP film at –80 °C for 3–7 days. Blots were stripped in a 0.1% SSC/0.5% SDS solution and rehybridized with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe as a control for loading. Immunoblotting—Murine calvaria were grown to 50–70% confluency in α-MEM containing 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin before being treated at 37 °C with increasing doses of heparin for 20 min. Alternatively, in a separate series of experiments, calvaria cells were treated with heparin at a concentration of 25 μg/ml and incubated at 37 °C for increasing periods of time. Following incubation at 37 °C, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 50 mm NaF in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing leupeptin (5 μg/ml), aprotinin (5 μg/ml), pepstatin A (1 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and EDTA (0.25 mm). The cell lysates were then run on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and blocked overnight with 5% casein at 4 °C. The membranes were then incubated with anti-p-Erk antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 3 h before being incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescent system. Following visualization, the blots were stripped (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) and incubated with anti-Erk antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein was visualized by the same method as p-Erk. Immunoprecipitation—Murine calvaria were grown to 50–70% confluency in α-MEM containing 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin before being treated for 24 h with either PD098059 or SP600125. The cells were then treated with either heparin (25 μg/ml), IL-11 (20 ng/ml), or IL-11 plus heparin (20 ng/ml and 25 μg/ml, respectively). After a 20-min incubation, the cells were washed and then lysed with 1% deoxycholic acid, and Triton X-100 in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) containing EDTA (0.25 mm), leupeptin (5 μg/ml), aprotinin (5 μg/ml), pepstatin A(1 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), and Na3VO4 (0.1 mm). The supernatants of the cell extracts were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with 2 μg of anti-STAT3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and then incubated with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h to precipitate the antigen-antibody complexes. Immunoprecipitates were then washed three times with lysis buffer, boiled, and then subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE before being transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The blots were then blocked overnight with 5% casein at 4 °C and then incubated with anti-STAT3 phospho-Ser-727 antibody (Cell Signaling) for 3 h before being incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescent system. Real-time PCR—Calvaria were plated in 15-cm dishes at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/plate and then incubated for 48 h in α-MEM containing 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were then treated with PD098059 for 1 h, before being cultured with either heparin (25 μg/ml), IL-11 (20 ng/ml), or a combination of the two, for 6 days. Total RNA was then isolated using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and first strand cDNA synthesized from 4 μg of total RNA using random priming and Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR analysis of RANKL and 18 S rRNA was performed with an ABI Prism 7300 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using specific primers for RANKL and 18 S rRNA. Denaturation took place at 95 °C for 15 s, and annealing and extension were at 60 °C for 1 min, for 40 cycles. Results were expressed as the -fold increase, over the respective 18 S rRNA controls. siRNA Transfection—Calvaria cells were seeded into 24-well tissue culture dishes containing 13-mm Thermanox coverslips at a cell density of 2 × 105 cells/well. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were transfected with either 2 μg/ml PKD-MAPK1/Erk2-v1 siRNA expression plasmid (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) or control plasmid, (pKD-NegCon-v1, Upstate) for 5 h using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). Following removal of the Lipofectamine reagent, the cells were allowed to incubate in normal growth media for 24 h before being used in an in vitro osteoclast formation assay as described below. In Vitro Osteoclast Formation Assay—To obtain bone marrow cells for the assay, femurs from 30-day-old Swiss Webster mice were isolated, and the marrow was flushed out with phenol red-free MEM, using a syringe fitted with a 25-gauge needle (27Richards C.D. Langdon C. Deschamps P. Pennica D. Shaughnessy S.G. Cytokine. 2000; 12: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Once isolated, the cells were washed by centrifugation, and then co-cultured with murine calvaria cells (4 × 105/cm2) at a concentration of 2.0 × 105 cells/cm2 in 24-well plates containing 13-mm Thermanox coverslips. In some cases, the cells were also incubated with the serine kinase inhibitor PD098059 (25 μm) and either heparin (25 μg/ml), IL-11 (20 ng/ml), or a combination of heparin and IL-11. Nine days later, all adherent cells were fixed with a citrate/acetone solution and then stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity (Sigma, Procedure No. 386). Following staining, the coverslips were air-dried and mounted onto slides, and the number of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells was determined microscopically at 200× magnification (27Richards C.D. Langdon C. Deschamps P. Pennica D. Shaughnessy S.G. Cytokine. 2000; 12: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—All experiments were performed in triplicate. Analysis of variance was used to compare the results between the experimental and control groups. If a significant difference between experimental and control groups was detected, an unpaired Student's t test was performed at each point. Significance levels were adjusted using a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. The Effect of Serine Kinase Inhibitors on the Ability of Heparin to Enhance IL-11-induced STAT3 Activation—We previously demonstrated that heparin enhances both IL-11-induced STAT3·DNA complex formation and transactivation without altering the tyrosine phosphorylation status of STAT3 (13Walton K.J. Duncan J.M. Deschamps P. Shaughnessy S.G. Blood. 2002; 100: 2530-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To further define the mechanism by which this occurs, we pretreated calvaria cells with various serine kinase inhibitors and then assessed, by use of an EMSA, the ability of heparin to promote STAT3·DNA complex formation in the presence or absence of IL-11. As shown in Fig. 1, nuclear extracts isolated from IL-11-treated cells were able to form STAT3·DNA complexes when incubated with radiolabeled SIE oligonucleotides. In contrast, no STAT3·DNA complexes were formed when the nuclear extracts were isolated from heparin-treated cells. Heparin was found, however, to enhance IL-11-induced STAT3·DNA complex formation (3.0 ± 0.2-fold; p < 0.01) when the nuclear extracts isolated from heparin- and IL-11-treated cells were compared with those that had been treated with IL-11 alone (Fig. 1). Pretreatment of the calvaria cells with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, or the p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB202190, had no effect on the ability of heparin to promote IL-11-induced STAT3·DNA complex formation. However, the MEK inhibitor, PD098059, was found to completely abolish the synergy between heparin and IL-11 (Fig. 1B). In addition, the JNK inhibitor, SP600125, while not affecting the ability of heparin to promote IL-11-induced STAT3·DNA complex formation, did partially reduce complex formation (46.6 ± 3.7%, p < 0.05) in the presence of IL-11 alone (Fig. 1A). These results suggest that the ability of heparin to synergistically enhance STAT3·DNA binding is dependent upon the ability of heparin to activate the MAPK pathway. Effect of Various Serine Kinase Inhibitors on the Ability of Heparin to Enhance IL-11-induced gp130 Expression—Because the MEK inhibitor, PD098059, was able to abolish the ability of heparin to promote IL-11-induced STAT3·DNA binding, we next examined whether PD098059 would also prevent heparin from enhancing the transcription of gp130, a gene that contains a STAT3-binding element within its promoter (28O'Brien C.A. Manolagas S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15003-15010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 2, gp130 expression was induced by IL-11, whereas heparin alone had no effect. However, when combined with heparin, the ability of IL-11 to induce gp130 expression was enhanced 2.0 ± 0.5-fold (p < 0.05) over that seen in its absence. Pretreatment of the calvaria cells with the MEK inhibitor, PD098059, while having no effect on IL-11-induced gp130 expression, completely abolished the ability of heparin to act synergistically with IL-11 (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the serine kinase inhibitors, wortmannin (a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor), and SB202190 (a p38 inhibitor), did not effect IL-11-induced gp130 expression, either in the presence or absence of heparin (Fig. 2B). However, similar to its effect on STAT3·DNA complex formation, the JNK inhibitor, SP600125, significantly decreased IL-11-induced gp130 expression (43.4 ± 6.3%, p < 0.05) without affecting the ability of heparin to act synergistically with IL-11. Effect of Heparin and Serine Kinase Inhibitors on IL-11-induced STAT3 Serine Phosphorylation—Although tyrosine phosphorylation is a prerequisite of STAT3 activation, serine phosphorylation of STAT3, particularly at Ser-727, is known to enhance STAT3 transcriptional activity (25Ng J. Cantrell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24542-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 26Schuringa J. Jonk L.J.C. Dokter W.H.A. Vellenga E. Kruijer W. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We therefore pretreated calvaria cells with either the MEK inhibitor, PD098059, or the JNK inhibitor, SP600125, before incubating the cells for 20 min with heparin, IL-11, or a combination of the two. The cells were then lysed, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-STAT3 antibody before being immunoblotted for Ser-727 phosphorylation using an anti-STAT-phosphoserine 727 antibody. As seen in Fig. 3, incubation of murine calvaria cells with IL-11 resulted in a significant increase in serine 727 phosphorylation (p < 0.01). However, heparin alone had no effect on Ser-727 phosphorylation nor did it enhance Ser-727 phosphorylation in the presence of IL-11. In addition, pretreatment of the calvaria cells with either PD098059 (Fig. 3) or SP600125 (data not shown) did not affect IL-11-induced Ser-727 phosphorylation, either in the presence or absence of heparin. When taken together these results suggest that the ability of heparin to enhance STAT3 activation is independent of STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation. Effect of Heparin on Erk1 and Erk2 Activation—Because the MEK inhibitor, PD098059, abolished the ability of heparin to promote both IL-11-induced STAT3·DNA complex formation and gp130 expression, we decided to determine directly if heparin was capable of activating Erk1 and Erk2. As shown in Fig. 4, heparin stimulated Erk1 and Erk2 activation (2.8 ± 0.5-fold, p < 0.05) in both a dose (Fig. 4A) and time-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). Maximal stimulation of Erk was obtained when the calvaria cells were treated for 20 min with 25 μg/ml heparin and was sustained for at least 2 h before returning to control levels (data not shown). These findings demonstrate that heparin can directly up-regulate both Erk1 and Erk2 activation. Effect of Heparin and PD098059 on IL-11-induced RANKL Expression—Because the expression of RANKL is a prerequisite of osteoclast formation/differentiation we next used real-time PCR to examine the ability of both heparin and PD098059 to affect IL-11-induced RANKL expression. As shown in Table 1, IL-11 induced RANKL expression by 39.1 ± 3.9-fold (p < 0.01), whereas heparin alone had no effect. However, when heparin was combined with IL-11, the relative expression of RANKL was increased 2.7 ± 0.7-fold (p < 0.05) over that seen with IL-11 alone. In contrast, when the calvaria cells were first pretreated with PD098059, heparin was unable to act synergistically with IL-11 and induce RANKL expression (Table 1). When taken together, these findings suggest that heparin increases IL-11-induced RANKL expression in an Erk-dependent manner.TABLE 1Effect of PD098059 on the ability of heparin to enhance IL-11-induced RANKL mRNA expressionConditionsRelative expression of RANKL mRNAControl1.0Heparin1.0 ± 0.3IL-1139.1 ± 3.9ap < 0.01 when compared with the expression of RANKL mRNA in control cells.IL-11 plus Heparin105.5 ± 26.0bp < 0.05 when compared with the expression of RANKL mRNA in IL-11-treated cells.IL-11 plus PD09805945.0 ± 13.3ap < 0.01 when compared with the expression of RANKL mRNA in control cells.IL-11 plus heparin plus PD09805936.5 ± 7.5ap < 0.01 when compared with the expression of RANKL mRNA in control cells.a p < 0.01 when compared with the expression of RANKL mRNA in control cells.b p < 0.05 when compared with the expression of RANKL mRNA in IL-11-treated cells. Open table in a new tab Effect of Heparin and PD098059 on IL-11-induced in Vitro Osteoclast Formation—To determine if Erk1 and Erk2 activation by heparin was responsible for the ability of heparin to promote IL-11-induced osteoclast formation, we treated co-cultures of murine calvaria and bone marrow cells with IL-11 in the presence or absence of heparin and the MEK inhibitor, PD098059. Nine days later the cells were stained for TRAP activity, and the number of TRAP+ multinucleated cells (MNCs) was determined. As shown in Fig. 5, the formation of TRAP+ MNCs was stimulated when co-cultures of murine calvaria and bone marrow cells were treated with IL-11. Treatment with heparin alone had no effect. However, when co-cultures were treated with both heparin and IL-11, the ability of IL-11 to stimulate TRAP+ MNC formation was enhanced >2-fold (p < 0.01). In contrast, heparin was unable to promote IL-11-induced TRAP+ MNC formation when the co-cultures were treated in the presence of PD098059 (Fig. 5A) or when the murine calvaria cells were first transfected with Erk-specific siRNA (Fig. 5B). When taken together, these results suggest that the ability of heparin to synergistically enhance IL-11-induced osteoclast formation is dependent upon MEK activation. Previously, we demonstrated that heparin acts synergistically with IL-11, a member of the IL-6 family of cytokines, to enhance both STAT3 activation and in vitro osteoclast formation (13Walton K.J. Duncan J.M. Deschamps P. Shaughnessy S.G. Blood. 2002; 100: 2530-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the current study, we examine the mechanism by which this synergy occurs. Thus, by using various serine kinase inhibitors we demonstrate that the MEK inhibitor, PD098059, inhibits the ability of heparin to enhance both IL-11-induced STAT3 activation and in vitro osteoclast formation. In addition, we demonstrate that heparin can increase Erk1/2 activation but that its effect on IL-11-induced STAT3 activation is independent of STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation. When taken together, these findings suggest that heparin enhances IL-11-induced STAT3 activation, and thus osteoclast formation, by a mechanism that is independent of STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation, but which involves up-regulation of the MAPK pathway. In a previous study, we demonstrated that heparin enhances both IL-11-induced STAT3·DNA complex formation and transactivation without altering either STAT3 tyrosine or serine 727 phosphorylation (13Walton K.J. Duncan J.M. Deschamps P. Shaughnessy S.G. Blood. 2002; 100: 2530-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the current study, we confirm these findings and present evidence to support the hypothesis that heparin enhances IL-11-induced STAT3 activation by up-regulating the MAPK pathway. Thus, we demonstrate that heparin is able to increase Erk1 and Erk2 activation in both a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4). In addition, we show that the MEK inhibitor, PD098059, blocks the ability of heparin to enhance IL-11-induced STAT3 activation and as a consequence IL-11-induced gp130 expression (Figs. 1 and 2). Whether heparin is activating the MAPK pathway directly or indirectly is unknown. However, heparin has been shown to increase the binding efficiency of a variety cytokines and/or growth factors, some of which might activate the MAPK pathway upon binding to their receptor. For example, heparin has been shown to enhance basic fibroblast growth factor receptor binding and to thereby suppress collagen synthesis in 21-day old fetal rat calvariae (29Hurley M.M. Kessler M. Gronowicz G. Raisz L.G. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2675-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition, heparin has been shown to interact with a variety of other growth factors, including insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factors, and vascular endothelial growth factor (30Firth S.M. Baxter R.C. Endocrine Rev. 2002; 23: 824-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar, 31El-Sheikh A. Liu C. Huang H. Edgington T.S.

STAT3·DNA binding and transactivation can be regulated in a number of ways. For example, to bind DNA, STAT3 must first dimerize through reciprocal phosphotyrosine-SH2 interactions, a process that requires phosphorylation of Tyr-705 (22Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.

In addition, the transcriptional activity of STAT3 can be augmented by phosphorylation at Ser-727 (25Ng J. Cantrell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24542-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 26Schuringa J. Jonk L.J.C. Dokter W.H.A. Vellenga E. Kruijer W. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). How up-regulation of the MAPK pathway by heparin leads to enhanced IL-11-induced STAT3·DNA complex formation and transactivation is not known. Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that heparin does not affect either STAT3 Tyr-705 or Ser-727 phosphorylation, either in the absence or presence of IL-11. Furthermore, in the current study, we demonstrate that the MEK inhibitor PD098059, while capable of blocking the synergy between heparin and IL-11, has no effect on STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation. It is, however, possible that heparin is causing STAT3 phosphorylation at a serine residue other than Ser-727 and that this results in an enhancement of STAT3·DNA complex formation and transactivation. Indeed, there is evidence to suggest that the phosphorylation of STAT3 on serine residues other than Ser-727 might augment the transcriptional activity of STAT3 (34Zhang X. Blenis J. Li H. Schindler C. Chen-Kiang S. Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 35Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E.

Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is possible that activation of the MAPK pathway by heparin can lead to an alteration in the ability of STAT3 to interact with any one of a variety of regulatory proteins. For example, it is possible that activation of the MAPK pathway could in some way lead to an attenuation of the ability of protein inhibitor of activated STAT3 (PIAS3) to bind and thus, inhibit STAT3 activity (37Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 38Yamamoto T. Sato N. Sekine Y. Yumioka T. Imoto S. Junicho A. Fuse H.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 314: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition, it is also possible that activation of the MAPK pathway by heparin could either directly or indirectly affect STAT3 interactions with other co-activators of transcription such as P300 (41Shuai K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2638-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that the JNK inhibitor, SP600125, decreases both IL-11-induced STAT3·DNA complex formation and gp130 expression (Figs. 1 and 2). In contrast, the serine kinase inhibitors PD098059, wortmannin, and SB202190 were all found to have no effect on complex formation or gp130 expression in the presence of IL-11 alone. This suggests that maximum activation of STAT3 in the presence of IL-11 is in part dependent upon JNK activation and that the MAPK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, or the p38 MAPK pathways have no effect on STAT3 activation. The mechanism by which JNK enhances STAT3 activation is unknown. Tenney et al. (42Tenney R. Stansfield K. Pekala P.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2005; 202: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) recently reported that activation of the PI3-kinase pathway in 3T3-L1 adipocytes causes an increase in IL-11-induced STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation. However, we found that the ability of JNK to enhance STAT3 activation occurs independently of STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation (Fig. 3). Whether JNK is acting to phosphorylate other serine residues on STAT3 and/or other transcription factors, which could act cooperatively with STAT3, is unknown. Previously, we demonstrated that the ability of IL-11 to induce osteoclast formation was enhanced in the presence of heparin even though heparin alone had no effect (13Walton K.J. Duncan J.M. Deschamps P. Shaughnessy S.G. Blood. 2002; 100: 2530-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition, we reported that heparin was able to enhance IL-11-induced osteoclast formation, because it acted synergistically with IL-11 to induce the expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) on the osteoblast cell surface. RANKL expression, in the presence of macrophage-colony-stimulating factor, has been shown to be a prerequisite of osteoclast formation both in vitro and in vivo (43Wong B.R. Josien R. Choi Y. J.

In the current study, we confirm the ability of heparin to synergistically enhance both IL-11-induced RANKL expression (Table 1) and IL-11-induced osteoclast formation (Fig. 5). In addition, we demonstrate that heparin not only enhances IL-11-induced RANKL expression but also IL-11-induced osteoclast formation through up-regulation of the MAPK pathway. Whether heparin can also act synergistically with other cytokines to induce osteoclast formation is unknown. However, we have found that heparin does not enhance either leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M or IL-6 plus sIL-6R-induced osteoclast formation in co-cultures of murine calvaria and bone marrow cells. 4J. Kasaboski, M. Butcher, and S. G. Shaughnessy, unpublished observation. In summary, we have demonstrated that heparin enhances IL-11-induced STAT3 activation by a mechanism that is independent of STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation but involves up-regulation of the MAPK pathway. This provides a plausible mechanism by which heparin may synergize with IL-11 to increase osteoclast formation and helps to explain why heparin causes bone loss when administered long term."
https://openalex.org/W2050630912,"Elongation factor Ts (EF-Ts) is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu). An important feature of the nucleotide exchange is the structural rearrangement of EF-Tu in the EF-Tu·EF-Ts complex caused by insertion of Phe-81 of EF-Ts between His-84 and His-118 of EF-Tu. In this study, the contribution of His-118 to nucleotide release was studied by pre-steady state kinetic analysis of nucleotide exchange in EF-Tu mutants in which His-118 was replaced by Ala or Glu. Intrinsic as well as EF-Ts-catalyzed release of GDP/GTP was affected by the mutations, resulting in an ∼10-fold faster spontaneous nucleotide release and a 10-50-fold slower EF-Ts-catalyzed nucleotide release. The effects are attributed to the interference of the mutations with the EF-Ts-induced movements of the P-loop of EF-Tu and changes at the domain 1/3 interface, leading to the release of the β-phosphate group of GTP/GDP. The Kd for GTP is increased by more than 40 times when His-118 is replaced with Glu, which may explain the inhibition by His-118 mutations of aminoacyl-tRNA binding to EF-Tu. The mutations had no effect on EF-Tu-dependent delivery of aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome. Elongation factor Ts (EF-Ts) is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu).

The bacterial EF-Tu 3The abbreviations used are: EF-Tu, elongation factor Tu; EF-Ts, elongation factor Ts; aa-tRNA, aminoacyl-tRNA; mant-GDP/GTP, (2′/3′-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl-GDP/GTP); DTT, dithiothreitol; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer. 3The abbreviations used are: EF-Tu, elongation factor Tu; EF-Ts, elongation factor Ts; aa-tRNA, aminoacyl-tRNA; mant-GDP/GTP, (2′/3′-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl-GDP/GTP); DTT, dithiothreitol; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer. is a GTP-binding protein that consists of three domains, of which domain 1 (the G domain) is responsible for the binding of guanine nucleotides (1Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. Clark B.F. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1347-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Like all GTP-binding proteins, EF-Tu alternates between an inactive, GDP-bound form and an active, GTP-bound conformation required for the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) and its subsequent delivery to the A-site of the ribosome. EF-Tu has higher affinity for GDP than for GTP (Kd(GDP) ∼ 10-9m when compared with Kd(GTP) ∼ 10-8m), and the dissociation of GDP from EF-Tu is too slow to be physiologically relevant (0.002 s-1) (2Gromadski K.B. Wieden H.-J. Rodnina M.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 3Wagner A. Simon I. Sprinzl M. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12535-12542Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Rapid nucleotide exchange in EF-Tu requires the action of a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, EF-Ts. The exchange reaction is initiated by the binding of EF-Ts to EF-Tu·GDP to form the EF-Tu·GDP·EF-Ts complex, which is unstable and rapidly dissociates into GDP and EF-Tu·EF-Ts. Next, GTP binds to the EF-Tu·EF-Ts complex to form the intermediary EF-Tu·GTP·EF-Ts complex, which finally dissociates into EF-Ts and EF-Tu·GTP, thereby completing the exchange reaction (see Fig. 1A). All steps are reversible, and in vivo, the reaction is driven toward formation of active EF-Tu for two reasons: (i) the formation of GTP-bound EF-Tu is favored by the higher intracellular concentration of GTP over GDP (0.9 versus 0.1 mm, respectively (4Neuhard J. Nygaard P. Neidardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. Vol. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 445-472Google Scholar)) and (ii) the high concentration of aa-tRNA shifts the equilibrium toward the GTP-bound state due to the formation of EF-Tu·GTP·aa-tRNA, with no effect on the kinetics of nucleotide exchange (2Gromadski K.B. Wieden H.-J. Rodnina M.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).In the EF-Tu·EF-Ts complex, EF-Ts interacts with domains 1 and 3 of EF-Tu (5Jeppesen M.G.

Domain 1 of EF-Tu contacts the N-terminal domain, subdomain N, and the C-terminal module of EF-Ts, whereas domain 3 of EF-Tu interacts with subdomain C of EF-Ts. Structural and kinetic studies indicated that three factors contribute to the nucleotide exchange: (i) disruption of the Mg2+ binding site in domain 1 of EF-Tu, (ii) a structural change in the phosphate binding loop (P-loop) in domain 1 of EF-Tu that causes an altered binding of the phosphate moieties of GDP/GTP, and (iii) a relaxation of the interaction with the ribose and/or guanine base (2Gromadski K.B.

One of the most conspicuous interactions in the crystal structure of the Escherichia coli EF-Tu·EF-Ts complex is the intrusion of EF-Ts Phe-81 between two histidine residues of domain 1 of EF-Tu, His-84 of helix B and His-118 of helix C (see Fig. 1B). This intrusion causes a displacement of the two histidines, which was proposed to be propagated to cause the release of the bound nucleotide. The displacement of His-84 results in disruption of the Mg2+ binding site, whereas the displacement of His-118 disrupts the binding of the β-phosphate due to a successive displacement of residues Gln-114, His-19, and Val-20, of which the latter two are situated in the P-loop (the loop that connects strand a and helix A in EF-Tu and contains the consensus element GXXXXGK(S/T) involved in the coordination of the phosphates of GDP/GTP). The displacement of Val-20 causes a flip in the backbone of the P-loop that breaks the hydrogen bond to the β-phosphate (6Kawashima T. Berthet Colominas C. Wulff M. Cusack S. Leberman R. Nature. 1996; 379: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The flip of the P-loop was found in a number of other G-proteins in complexes with their respective guanine nucleotide exchange factors, suggesting that displacement of the P-loop is a universally important step in guanine nucleotide release (10Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). However, the contribution of EF-Ts-induced rearrangements in the P-loop of EF-Tu to the acceleration of nucleotide exchange remained unclear despite several mutagenesis studies (9Zhang Y. Li X. Spremulli L.L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 330-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 11Zhang Y. Yu N.-J. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol.

In the present work, we examine the contribution of P-loop movement to nucleotide exchange by replacing one of the critical His residues, His-118, with Ala or Glu. These mutations are expected to hamper the successive displacement of residues in helix C of EF-Tu induced by EF-Ts binding and thereby abrogate the P-loop flip. The effects of these mutations on the elemental steps of the nucleotide exchange reaction were studied by using a pre-steady state kinetic approach (2Gromadski K.B. Wieden H.-J. Rodnina M.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 8Wieden H.-J. Gromadski K. Rodnin D. Rodnina M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6032-6036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).His-118 has also been reported to play a role in aa-tRNA binding (12Jonak J. Anborgh P. Parmeggiani A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 14Andersen C. Wiborg O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 739-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 15Jonak J. Petersen T. Meloun B. Rychlik I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 144: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), which is, however, difficult to rationalize given that His-118 is located at least 16 Å from the aa-tRNA in the crystal structure of the ternary complex, EF-Tu·GDPNP·Phe-tRNAPhe (16Nissen P. Kjeldgaard M. Thirup S. Polekhina G. Reshetnikova L. Clark B.F. Nyborg J. Science. 1995; 270: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). On the ribosome, pairing between the mRNA codon and the anticodon of tRNA induces GTP hydrolysis in EF-Tu (17Rodnina M.V. Fricke R. Kuhn L. Wintermeyer W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2613-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and the transmission of the signal between the decoding and GTPase centers of the ribosome may be modulated by tRNA-EF-Tu interactions (18Rodnina M.V. Wintermeyer W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 415-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Therefore, if His-118 is involved in aa-tRNA binding (12Jonak J. Anborgh P. Parmeggiani A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 14Andersen C. Wiborg O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 739-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 15Jonak J. Petersen T. Meloun B. Rychlik I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 144: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), this would imply a potential role of that contact in GTPase activation of EF-Tu on the ribosome. We studied this possibility by monitoring aa-tRNA delivery to the ribosome by presteady state fluorescence kinetics methods.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on a pGEX construct containing the E. coli tuf A gene (19Knudsen C.R. Clark B.F. Degn B. Wiborg O. Biochem. Int. 1992; 28: 353-362PubMed Google Scholar) by using the QuikChange® II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The plasmid was constructed in such a way as to yield the native sequence of EF-Tu after cleavage of the protein with factor Xa. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing.EF-Tu—EF-Tu was expressed with an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase tag in E. coli JM109 as described previously (19Knudsen C.R. Clark B.F. Degn B. Wiborg O. Biochem. Int. 1992; 28: 353-362PubMed Google Scholar). Purification was carried out at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 15 μm GDP, opened in a high pressure homogenizer (Avestin) and applied to a glutathione-agarose column (Sigma). The column was extensively washed first with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 15 μm GDP and then with the same buffer containing 1 mm GDP to remove any traces of EF-Tu-bound EF-Ts. EF-Tu was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glutathione, 15 μm GDP, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 15 μm GDP, and concentrated. Removal of the glutathione S-transferase tag was carried out by cleavage with 1 μg of factor Xa (Qiagen)/150 μg of fusion protein for 8 h at 4 °C. The cleaved sample was applied to the glutathione-agarose column, and EF-Tu was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2,15 μm GDP. Residual EF-Ts co-purified with the EF-TuH118A mutant was separated from free EF-TuH118A by gel filtration on Superdex 75 (Amersham Biosciences). Activity of all EF-Tu preparations in nucleotide binding was close to 90% as measured by nitrocellulose filtration techniques (20Miller D.L. Weissbach H. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 30: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).EF-Ts—EF-Ts was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells as a fusion protein with the intein self-splicing element and a chitin binding domain (IMPACTI system, New England Biolabs) as described (21Karring H. Björnsson A. Thirup S. Clark B. Knudsen C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4294-4305Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The cells were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1.0 g/liter Triton X-100, 50 μm GDP, 10 (v/v) % glycerol and lysed with 1 mg of lysozyme/g of cells in the presence of 2% deoxycholate and 40 μg of DNase/g of cells. After centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded on a chitin column equilibrated with pre-cleavage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl). After fast equilibration with cleavage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 60 mm DTT), the column was incubated for 20 h at 4 °C followed by 22 h of incubation at 21 °C, resulting in the cleavage of the tag from EF-Ts. EF-Ts was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 1.0 g/liter Triton X-100 and dialyzed against storage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 20 (v/v) % glycerol).Determination of Protein Concentration—Protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213288) Google Scholar) and confirmed by comparing the intensity of a Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-stained band on an SDS-PAGE gel to that of a known standard by using an imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad GS-700). The concentration of nucleotide-free EF-Tu was determined according to Bradford and photometrically at 280 nm by using a molar extinction coefficient of 32,900 m-1 cm-1 (23Block W. Pingoud A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).Preparation of Nucleotide-free EF-Tu—To promote dissociation of GDP from EF-Tu, which forms a tight 1:1 complex during all purification steps, the protein was incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 70 mm NH4Cl, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 30 mm EDTA for 30 min at 37 °C. EF-Tu was separated from nucleotide by gel filtration on Superdex 75 and was immediately used in the stopped-flow experiments. Nucleotide-free EF-Tu was stable within the time of experiment and retained the characteristics of untreated EF-Tu with respect to the binding of EF-Ts and GDP/GTP (2Gromadski K.B. Wieden H.-J. Rodnina M.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).Preparation of EF-Tu·mant-GTP, EF-Tu·mant-GDP, and EF-Tu·EF-Ts—Mant-GDP and mant-GTP (2′/3′-O-(N-methyl-anthraniloyl-GDP or -GTP) were purchased from Jena BioScience. EF-Tu was incubated with a 3-fold excess of mantlabeled nucleotide in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 70 mm NH4Cl, 30 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT for 30 min at 37 °C. To remove GDP from reactions involving GTP, the experiments were performed in the presence of 3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate and 0.1 mg/ml pyruvate kinase. The EF-Tu·EF-Ts complex was prepared by incubation of EF-Tu and EF-Ts in equimolar amounts for 30 min at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 70 mm NH4Cl, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 30 mm EDTA. The complex was purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column.Preparation of the Ternary Complex, EF-Tu·GTP·Phe-tRNAPhe—Ribosome binding assays (24Daviter T. Wieden H.-J. Rodnina M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) showed that binding of the ternary complex to ribosomes saturated at a 2:1 ratio of EF-Tu·GTP·Phe-tRNAPhe to ribosomes for the wild type or EF-TuH118A mutant and at a 4:1 ratio for the EF-TuH118E mutant. For ternary complex formation, 3.7 μm wild-type EF-Tu, 3.7 μm EF-TuH118A, or 7.4 μm EF-TuH118E mutant was incubated with 1.9 μm tRNAPhe(proflavin 16/17), 3 mm ATP, 1 mm phenylalanine, 0.5% v/v yeast phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase, 0.05 μm EF-Ts, 3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 1 mm GTP, 0.1 mg/ml pyruvate kinase in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 70 mm NH4Cl, 30 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT at 37 °C for 45 min. At least 65% of added tRNA was aminoacylated, yielding a concentration of ∼1.2 μm ternary complex.Ribosome Complexes—Ribosomes and tRNAs from E. coli MRE600 were prepared as described previously (25Rodnina M.V. Wintermeyer W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1945-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 26Gromadski K.B. Rodnina M.V. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 191-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Ribosomes were programmed by incubating 0.4 μm purified ribosomes with 0.8 μm MFTI mRNA (26Gromadski K.B. Rodnina M.V. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 191-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), 0.4 μm initiation factor 1, 0.4 μm initiation factor 2, 0.4 μm initiation factor 3, 0.8 μm [3H]fMet-tRNAfMet, 1 mm GTP in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 70 mm NH4Cl, 30 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT at 37° for 70 min. The efficiency of ribosome initiation was checked by nitrocellulose filtration and subsequent scintillation counting.Rapid Kinetic Measurements—The interaction of EF-Tu with guanine nucleotides and EF-Ts was studied essentially, as described previously (2Gromadski K.B. Wieden H.-J. Rodnina M.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 3Wagner A. Simon I. Sprinzl M. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12535-12542Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Fluorescence stopped-flow measurements were performed on a SX-18MV spectrometer (Applied Photophysics) in buffer 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 70 mm NH4Cl, 30 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT at 20 °C. The interaction between EF-Tu and EF-Ts was observed directly by following the fluorescence change of EF-Tu Trp-184, which exhibits a fluorescence change upon EF-Ts binding (27Jameson D. Gratton E. Eccleston J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3894-3901Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Tryptophan fluorescence was excited at 280 nm and measured after passing KV335 filters (Schott). The fluorescence of mant-GDP bound to EF-Tu was excited via fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from tryptophan excited at 280 nm and measured after passing KV408 filters (Schott). Proflavin fluorescence was excited at 470 nm and measured after passing KV 500 filters (Schott). Experiments were performed by rapidly mixing equal volumes (60 μl each) of the reactants and monitoring the time course of fluorescence change. Time courses depicted in the figures were obtained by averaging 5-10 individual transients. Data were evaluated by fitting to an exponential function with a characteristic time constant (kapp), amplitude (A), and another variable for the final signal (F∞) according to the equation F = F∞ + A exp(-kapp·t), where F is the fluorescence at time t. Calculations were performed by using TableCurve software (Jandel Scientific). Standard deviations for apparent rate constants, kapp, were calculated by using the same software.RESULTSExperimental Prerequisites to Measure Nucleotide Exchange—The kinetic scheme of nucleotide exchange in EF-Tu is shown in Fig. 1A. EF-Tu can bind GDP (association rate constant k1), GTP (k5), or EF-Ts (k2) to form the respective binary complexes, which dissociate with the rate constants k-1, k-5, and k-2, respectively. The interaction of EF-Tu·GDP or EF-Tu·GTP with EF-Ts can be described by two consecutive equilibria that represent the formation of the ternary complex and nucleotide release, respectively. EF-Ts interacts with EF-Tu·GDP to form the ternary complex EF-Tu·GDP·EF-Ts (association and dissociation rate constants k3 and k-3, respectively). GDP is released from the ternary complex, forming the binary complex EF-Tu·EF-Ts (k-4); the reaction is reversible (k4). By analogy, EF-Tu·GTP can bind EF-Ts (k6), and the ternary complex can dissociate into either EF-Tu·GTP and EF-Ts (k-6) or EF-Tu·EF-Ts and GTP (k-7). The binding of GTP to the binary complex EF-Tu·EF-Ts is characterized by k7. Note that the rate constants k1, k2, k3, k4, k5, k6, and k7 are bimolecular association rate constants (M-1s-1), whereas the rate constants k-1, k-2, k-3, k-4, k-5, k-6, and k-7 are monomolecular dissociation rate constants (s-1).EF-Ts-free EF-Tu has to be used to measure the kinetics of intrinsic nucleotide exchange. EF-Tu binds EF-Ts tightly (Kd = 3 nm (2Gromadski K.B. Wieden H.-J. Rodnina M.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar)); therefore, EF-Ts often appears as a contaminant in EF-Tu preparations. However, the EF-Tu·EF-Ts complex is unstable in the presence of guanine nucleotides, and to avoid EF-Ts contamination, EF-Tu was purified in the presence of 1 mm GDP. The following experiment was carried out to test that no traces of EF-Ts were present in the resulting EF-Tu preparations. EF-Tu was preincubated with mant-GDP, and the complex was rapidly mixed with an excess of unlabeled GDP in the stopped-flow apparatus. The release of the bound mant-GDP from the EF-Tu·mant-GDP complex could be monitored by a decrease in mant-GDP fluorescence by using the FRET from Trp-184 in EF-Tu to mant-GDP or mant-GTP. In the absence of EF-Ts, the release was very low, 0.002 s-1 (2Gromadski K.B. Wieden H.-J. Rodnina M.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). If a given EF-Tu preparation does not contain EF-Ts, the addition of this EF-Tu together with GDP to the EF-Tu·mant-GDP complex should not affect the rate of mant-GDP release. If, in contrast, traces of EF-Ts were present in the test sample, the rate of mant-GDP dissociation from the wild-type EF-Tu should increase. Testing different mutant EF-Tu preparations showed that the preparation of the EF-TuH118E mutant was free of EF-Ts (Fig. 2). Traces of EF-Ts that were present in the EF-TuH118A preparation were removed by gel filtration (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Control of EF-Tu purity. EF-Ts-free wild-type EF-Tu·mant-GDP complex (0.4 μm EF-Tu, 1.2 μm mant-GDP) was rapidly mixed with excess unlabeled GDP (120 μm) alone (trace 1) or together with EF-TuH118E (0.4 μm) (trace 2), EF-TuH118A (0.4 μm) after the additional purification by gel filtration (trace 3), or EF-Ts (0.04 μm) (trace 4).

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12535-12542Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) by using FRET from Trp-184 in EF-Tu to mant-GDP or mant-GTP. FRET causes an increase of mant fluorescence upon binding of the nucleotide to the factor and a decrease of fluorescence upon dissociation of the complex. The rate constants of GDP release (k-1) were 0.002 s-1 for wild type and 0.03 and 0.02 s-1 for the EF-TuH118A and EF-TuH118E mutants, respectively (Fig. 3). Thus, the rate constants for the two mutants were 10 times higher than for the wild-type EF-Tu. Similarly, the rate constants of GTP dissociation (k-5) were 10 times higher for the EF-TuH118A and EF-TuH118E mutants, 0.2 and 0.5 s-1, respectively, than that for wild-type EF-Tu, 0.02 s-1 (Table 1).FIGURE 3Spontaneous dissociation of mant-GDP from EF-Tu (k-1).

Apparent rate constants, kapp, obtained by single-exponential fitting, were plotted against nucleotide concentration, yielding straight lines with slopes of k1 (Fig. 4) or k5 (data not shown). The association rate constants for both nucleotides were similar for the wild-type EF-Tu and the two mutants (Table 1). The Kd values for GDP and GTP calculated from the association and dissociation rate constants were 10-50 times lower for the mutants when compared with the wild type (Table 1).FIGURE 4Association of mant-GDP with EF-Tu (k1).

Symbols are as follows: squares, wild-type EF-Tu; closed triangles, EF-TuH118A; open triangles, EF-TuH118E. kapp values were obtained by single-exponential fitting of the average of 5-10 time courses.

An excess of unlabeled GDP was included with the EF-Ts to prevent rebinding of mant-GDP (Fig. 5A). The apparent rate constants of mant-GDP release were plotted against increasing EF-Ts concentration (Fig. 5B). In the initial linear part of the hyperbolic curve (Fig. 5C), the association of EF-Ts to EF-Tu·mant-GDP was rate-limiting, and the association rate constant k3 could be determined according to the equation: initial slope = k3/(1+ k-3/k-4) (28Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. Third Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1998: 122Google Scholar), provided that k-3 and k-4 are known (see below). At saturation with EF-Ts, the release reaction itself was rate-limiting. As the rate of mant-GDP rebinding was negligible in the presence of excess unlabeled GDP, the apparent rate constant at saturation was equal to the rate constant k-4. The following values of k-4 for mant-GDP were obtained from a fit to the hyperbolic function (Fig. 5B): 150 s-1 for wild-type EF-Tu, 2.3 s-1 for EF-TuH118A, and 2.8 s-1 for EF-TuH118E (Table 1). Similar experiments were performed with mant-GTP, yielding values of k-7 of 100 s-1 for the wild-type EF-Tu, 4.4 s-1 for EF-TuH118A, and 9 s-1 for EF-TuH118E (Table 1). Thus, the rate constants of EF-Ts-catalyzed GDP and GTP release from EF-Tu were much lower for the mutants when compared with wild-type EF-Tu.FIGURE 5Dissociation of mant-GDP from EF-Tu in the presence of EF-Ts.

https://openalex.org/W2027548521,"Copper, a mediator of redox chemistries in biology, is often found in enzymes that bind and reduce dioxygen. Among these, the copper amine oxidases catalyze the oxidative deamination of primary amines utilizing a type(II) copper center and 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine quinone (TPQ), a covalent cofactor derived from the post-translational modification of an active site tyrosine. Previous studies established the dependence of TPQ biogenesis on Cu(II); however, the dependence of cofactor formation on the biologically relevant Cu(I) ion has remained untested. In this study, we demonstrate that the apoform of the Hansenula polymorpha amine oxidase readily binds Cu(I) under anaerobic conditions and produces the quinone cofactor at a rate of 0.28 h-1 upon subsequent aeration to yield a mature enzyme with kinetic properties identical to the protein product of the Cu(II)-dependent reaction. Because of the change in magnetic properties associated with the oxidation of copper, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy was employed to investigate the nature of the rate-limiting step of Cu(I)-dependent cofactor biogenesis. Upon aeration of the unprocessed enzyme prebound with Cu(I), an axial Cu(II) electron paramagnetic resonance signal was found to appear at a rate equivalent to that for the cofactor. These data provide strong evidence for a rate-limiting release of superoxide from a Cu(II)(O2⋅¯) complex as a prerequisite for the activation of the precursor tyrosine and its transformation for TPQ. As copper is trafficked to intracellular protein targets in the reduced, Cu(I) state, these studies offer possible clues as to the physiological significance of the acquisition of Cu(I) by nascent H. polymorpha amine oxidase.

Copper, an essential trace element, is frequently found as a cofactor in proteins that bind and/or catalyze the reduction of dioxygen (1Solomon E.I. Chen P. Metz M. Lee S.K. Palmer A.E. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2001; 40: 4570-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Copper homeostasis is highly regulated, and imbalances in cellular concentrations have been attributed to inherited disorders of copper metabolism, most notably Wilson disease and Menkes syndrome (2Puig S. Thiele D.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The uptake, transport, and efflux of copper are orchestrated by a number of protein mediators (2Puig S. Thiele D.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Among them, metal ion permeases on the plasma membrane bring copper from the environment into the cell, and metallothioneins buffer the copper ion concentration in the cytoplasm. In yeast, the cytoplasm has been estimated to be devoid of free copper, a scenario that necessitates the use of cytosolic metallochaperones (CCS, Atx1, and Cox17) that chelate and shuttle Cu(I) to distinct intracellular compartments and the protein target, superoxide dismutase (3Rae T.D.

Science. 2003; 300: 931-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Although there is now a wealth of knowledge regarding routes for the import of Cu(I) into the mitochondria and the trans-Golgi network for cupro-proteins that traverse the secretory pathway (2Puig S. Thiele D.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar), an understanding of the pathways for the delivery of copper to proteins residing in other organelles is lacking. Copper amine oxidase (CAO) 3The abbreviations used are: CAO, copper amine oxidase; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; HPAO, H. polymorpha amine oxidase; LMCT, ligand-to-metal charge transfer; TPQ, 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine quinone. 3The abbreviations used are: CAO, copper amine oxidase; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; HPAO, H. polymorpha amine oxidase; LMCT, ligand-to-metal charge transfer; TPQ, 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine quinone. is ubiquitous in Nature and found in various intracellular and extracellular locations within microbes, plants, and higher organisms. CAO catalyzes the oxidative deamination of primary amines to the corresponding aldehydes using a mononuclear copper center and the organic cofactor 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine quinone (TPQ) (5Mure M. Mills S.A. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9269-9278Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). One distinguishing feature of CAO is the ability to synthesize its quinone cofactor via the post-translational modification of a specific active site tyrosine (Tyr-405) in a self-processing reaction dependent on dioxygen and the neighboring copper ion (6DuBois J.L.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3699-3707Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); however, the relevance of Cu(I) in cofactor formation has remained unexplored. Given the prevailing paradigm for the trafficking of Cu(I) within the cell (2Puig S. Thiele D.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) and the apparent lack of a designated copper chaperone for HPAO, the pathway for the delivery of copper to this peroxisomal enzyme as well as the valence state of the metal inserted into the newly folded protein are brought into question. Herein we report the mechanism for Cu(I)-dependent TPQ biogenesis in vitro, with the aim of gleaning insights into the acquisition of copper by nascent HPAO in vivo. General—Tetrakis(acetonitrile) copper(I) hexafluorophosphate was purchased from Aldrich. ApoHPAO was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified according to published methods (7Dove J.E. Schwartz B. Williams N.K. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3690-3698Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 9Samuels N.M. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14308-14317Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). All measurements were conducted in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, unless otherwise noted. UV-visible and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Spectral Analysis of Cu(I)-dependent TPQ Biogenesis—ApoHPAO and acetonitrile (HPLC grade) were separately purged with argon scrubbed by a basic solution of pyrogallol and subsequently transferred to an anaerobic glove box. A stock solution of tetrakis(acetonitrile)copper(I) hexafluorophosphate (10 mm) was freshly prepared in acetonitrile, and an equimolar amount (23 μl) was incubated with apoHPAO in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0 (1 ml, 225 μm), at 25 °C in the absence of oxygen for 1 h. Weakly bound copper was removed by washing the protein with anaerobic buffer using a 50,000 molecular weight cut-off ultracentrifuge device (Millipore). A small aliquot (∼100 μl) of the washed protein was transferred to an anaerobic cuvette (t, 0 h), capped with a rubber septum and its UV-visible spectrum recorded. Also, a 250-μl aliquot of the washed protein sample (94 μm) was placed in an EPR tube (t, 0 h), capped with a rubber septum, removed from the glove box, and frozen immediately in a 2-methylbutane bath that had been cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature. The remaining portion of the washed protein was removed from the glove box and aerated with a steady stream of house air for 5 min. A small portion of the aerated sample was transferred to another cuvette, and TPQ formation was monitored on a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer with a thermostated cell holder maintained at 25 °C. The remaining portion of the aerated protein sample was incubated in a 25 °C bath, and aliquots (250 μl) were transferred to EPR tubes and frozen at the designated times. EPR spectra were acquired on a Varian E-109 spectrometer at 6 K using the following instrument parameters: microwave frequency, 9.24 GHz; modulation amplitude, 16 G; microwave power, 0.5 milliwatt; time constant, 0.5 ms. Spin quantitation was performed using a Cu(II)-EDTA standard. The g values were calibrated using a TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy, free radical) standard. The total copper bound to HPAO was measured by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy on an Optima 3000 DV (Perkin-Elmer). Protein concentrations were measured by Bradford assay relative to a bovine serum albumin standard. The final TPQ content for processed HPAO was determined by reaction with phenylhydrazine (ϵ448 = 40.5 mm-1 cm-1) (10Cai D.Y. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7647-7653Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The observed rate constants were determined by fit to a single exponential using Kaleida-Graph 3.0.2 (Synergy Software). Metal Binding Stoichiometry—ApoHPAO in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0 (∼26 μm), was anaerobically reconstituted with an equivalent of stock tetrakis(acetonitrile)copper(I) hexafluorophosphate (700 μm in acetonitrile) or CuCl2 (700 μm in water) for 1 h and subsequently washed with anaerobic buffer to remove unbound metal. The remaining metal bound to HPAO was measured by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy. Steady State Kinetic Analysis of HPAO Reconstituted with Copper—ApoHPAO was anaerobically reconstituted with an equivalent of tetrakis(acetonitrile)copper(I) hexafluorophosphate or CuCl2 for 1 h and subsequently allowed to produce TPQ in air-saturated buffer at 25 °C for 20 h. The resulting cofactor-containing protein was assayed for methylamine oxidation using methods reported earlier (11Su Q.J. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12513-12525Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and kcat values were normalized to the TPQ content. Oxygen consumption was measured under the following conditions: 6-8 μm HPAO, 5 mm methylamine, 100 mm KPi, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.2, at 25 °C. Spectroscopic Analysis of Cu(I)-dependent TPQ Biogenesis— ApoHPAO was anaerobically reconstituted with an equivalent of Cu(I) and subsequently exposed to air to initiate TPQ biogenesis. When the reaction between the precursor tyrosine and dioxygen was monitored spectrophotometrically, the quinone cofactor was shown to appear with a rate of kTPQ = 0.28 h-1 and without the detection of a visible precursor species (Fig. 1). These properties contrast with Cu(II)-catalyzed cofactor biogenesis, which proceeded at a rate 17-fold faster and with the observation of the putative tyrosinate-Cu(II) ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) species (350 nm) (6DuBois J.L. Klinman J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 7Dove J.E. Schwartz B. Williams N.K. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3690-3698Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, analysis of the mature, TPQ-containing enzyme derived from the Cu(I)-dependent reaction revealed that the final protein product contained 0.26 eq TPQ and catalyzed the oxidation of methylamine with a kcat = 3.1 s-1, values similar to those for the end product of the Cu(II)-dependent reaction (Table 1). Together, these data indicated that regardless of the valence state of copper supplied to apoHPAO, the mechanistically distinct pathways for TPQ biogenesis converge to yield the same final product (Fig. 2). Because the decay of the 350-nm intermediate is rate-limiting in Cu(II)-catalyzed TPQ biogenesis, the inability to detect this optical intermediate coupled with the diminished value for kTPQ most plausibly indicated a new rate-limiting step further upstream in the Cu(I)-dependent reaction.TABLE 1Comparison of properties for HPAO following reconstitution with Cu(I) and Cu(II)MetalEquivalent CuaBound copper normalized to protein concentrationEquivalent TPQkTPQkCu(II)kcath–1s–1 bError reported as standard deviation of three independent measurementsCu(II)0.84 (0.06)0.33 (0.03)cTPQ content normalized to total copper added4.8 ± 0.2dFrom Ref. 73.2 ± 0.1Cu(I)0.79 (0.05)0.26 (0.03)eTPQ content normalized to total bound copper0.28 ± 0.01fRate of appearance of TPQ (480 nm).

Thus, the nature of the rate-limiting step in Cu(I)-dependent TPQ formation was probed by EPR spectroscopy. As such, apoHPAO was anaerobically reconstituted with Cu(I) and changes in copper valence monitored by time-resolved X-band EPR spectroscopy following aeration of the sample. As shown in Fig. 3, the addition of oxygen to Cu(I)-HPAO led to the growth of an axial Cu(II) EPR signal with spectroscopic properties similar to the mature CAO derived from the Cu(II)-dependent reaction (12Ruggiero C.E. Dooley D.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1953-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These data support the reaction scheme in which the Cu(I)-catalyzed reaction pathway for TPQ biogenesis converges with that for the Cu(II)-dependent reaction to yield a common end product protein (Fig. 2). Further analysis of the final product derived from the Cu(I)-dependent processing of the precursor tyrosine showed for every bound Cu(I) ion oxidized to Cu(II) (0.26 eq), a molecule of TPQ (0.26 eq) was produced. The 1:1 stoichiometry for the reaction products strongly indicated productive oxidative chemistry occurring at the active site as opposed to the oxidation of metal randomly bound on the surface of the protein. Most significantly, the rate constant for the conversion of Cu(I) to an EPR active Cu(II) signal (kCu(II) = 0.29 ± 0.06 h-1) was found to be equivalent to that for the generation of TPQ (kTPQ = 0.28 ± 0.01 h-1) (Table 1 and Fig. 4) and was, therefore, concluded to be the rate-limiting step in Cu(I)-dependent TPQ formation. Because the Cu(II) EPR signal is expected to be detectable only after the release of the superoxide ligand, Cu(I)-catalyzed TPQ biogenesis was predicted to be limited by dioxygen binding, dioxygen reduction, or the dissociation of superoxide from the metal (Fig. 2). Chemically reduced CAOs have been shown to readily react with dioxygen (13Dooley D.M. Scott R.A. Knowles P.F. Colangelo C.M. McGuirl M.A. Brown D.E. J. Am. Chem.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14256-14263Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Moreover, rapid binding and reduction of dioxygen by Cu(I) model complexes (15Lewis E.A. Tolman W.B. Chem. Rev. 2004; 104: 1047-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar) at cryogenic temperatures also indicate that neither process is likely to be the rate-limiting step in Cu(I)-catalyzed TPQ biogenesis, pointing instead to a slow dissociation of superoxide. Similarly, the dissociation of a small ligand (N3) from the Cu(II) center in the precursor enzyme-azide complex was found to limit TPQ biogenesis in HPAO upon the introduction of air (16Schwartz B. Olgin A.K. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2954-2963Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).FIGURE 4Kinetics of the reaction between Cu(I)-HPAO and dioxygen.

It is conceivable that a Cu(II)-superoxo species could be relatively stable in a protected mononuclear site in the absence of a second electron donor (e.g. cysteine) or weak C-H bond (binding energy <80 kcal/mol) (18Sawyer D.T. Roberts J.L. Calderwood T.S. Sugimoto H. McDowell M.S. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. London B Biol. Sci. 1985; 311: 483-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The apparent lack of reactivity of the active site tyrosine with Cu(II)-superoxo is, however, a puzzle and may relate to its inaccessibility; during Cu(II)-initiated biogenesis, O2 binding at a non-metal site is the trigger for this tyrosine to migrate to the metal site (Fig. 2). Of the Cu(II)-superoxo model complexes described (19Mirica L.M. Ottenwaelder X. Stack T.D. Chem. Rev. 2004; 104: 1013-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar), end-on bound species exhibit strong LMCT bands at ∼410 nm (3000-8000 m-1 cm-1), whereas a single side-on species has been shown to exhibit only weak d-d transitions in the visible range (452 and 700 nm, ϵ ≤ 300 m-1 cm-1) and an intense LMCT band at λ < 300 nm. Although the use of high protein concentrations (7 mg/ml) precluded the practical observation of changes in the absorbance spectrum under 300 nm, no optical species in the visible range were shown to have a precursor-product relationship with respect to the band for the quinone cofactor (λmax, 472 nm) (Fig. 1). Therefore, we speculate that Cu(I)-dependent TPQ formation in HPAO is limited by the dissociation of a side-on bound superoxide ion from copper, the absorbance signature of which is likely to be masked by the appearance of TPQ (ϵ472 = 2400 m-1 cm-1) (5Mure M. Mills S.A. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9269-9278Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Because the metal coordination number in mature CAO decreases from 5 to 3 ligands following the chemical reduction of Cu(II) (13Dooley D.M. Scott R.A. Knowles P.F. Colangelo C.M. McGuirl M.A. Brown D.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 2599-2605Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar), it is easy to envision the binding of dioxygen to two vacant sites on Cu(I) in a side-on fashion in the unprocessed protein. The occupation of a metal binding site normally reserved for the O-4 hydroxyl of the precursor tyrosine would prevent the formation of the tyrosinate-Cu(II) LMCT complex prior to the dissociation of superoxide and, therefore, limit Cu(I)-catalyzed TPQ biogenesis in HPAO (Fig. 2). We have shown that the in vitro reconstitution of apoHPAO with Cu(I) supports TPQ biogenesis, albeit at a rate much slower than the Cu(II)-dependent reaction. As shown (Fig. 2), the bound Cu(I) ion is expected to readily reduce bound dioxygen to superoxide and a Cu(II) center, which is rendered chemically competent only upon the dissociation of the superoxo ligand. The newly unveiled cupric ion is subsequently coordinated by the precursor tyrosine (Tyr-405) to form the key tyrosinate-Cu(II) LMCT complex, an action proposed to activate the tyrosyl ring toward a direct reaction with triplet state dioxygen and thus facilitate the monooxygenation reaction (6DuBois J.L. Klinman J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 7Dove J.E. Schwartz B. Williams N.K. Klinman J.P.

Although this and previous studies establish divalent copper as the actual catalyst in TPQ biogenesis, Cu(I) may still have biological relevance in this post-translational reaction in HPAO, a resident of the peroxisome. The accepted model for the delivery of matrix proteins to the peroxisome centers around mRNA translation on free polyribosomes in the cytosol and the subsequent translocation of folded proteins across a multiple protein complex on the peroxisomal membrane (20Heiland I. Erdmann R. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2362-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Given the apparent absence of copper-transporting proteins on the peroxisomal membrane and low probability for the existence of a pool of free copper in the lumen of this oxidizing organelle, the acquisition of Cu(I) by newly folded HPAO in the cytosol prior to import into peroxisome is plausible. The maintenance of Cu(I)-HPAO in an inactive, cofactorless state for an extended period of time (t½, 2.5 h) may serve a protective function in the cell. This strategy would prevent the generation of deleterious reduced oxygen species (i.e. H2O2), a product of amine oxidation and TPQ biogenesis, prior to the translocation of metallated HPAO into the lumen of the peroxisome."

GH exerts its function by activating several signaling pathways, including JAK2/STAT and MEK/ERK. ERK1/2 activation by GH plays important roles in gene expression, cell proliferation, and growth.

We previously reported that, in rat H4IIE hepatoma cells, desensitization and resensitization of GH-induced STAT5 phosphorylation were strongly correlated with the reduction and recovery of GHR levels, respectively (25Ji S. Frank S.J. Messina J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28384-28393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Recovery of GHR, however, was insufficient for recovery of GH signaling via ERK1/2, suggesting that post-receptor mechanisms are involved. In the present study, the post-GHR mechanisms by which GH induced desensitization of ERK1/2 phosphorylation were investigated. After an initial GH treatment, activation of JAK2, Ras, and Raf-1 was induced by a second GH treatment and correlated with recovery of GHR levels. However, this was insufficient to activate MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. Because insulin plays an important role in regulating GH signaling and action, the effects of insulin on a second GH-induced signaling pathway were also investigated. Prior exposure to insulin restored the ability of a second GH treatment to induce MEK/ERK phosphorylation without changing GHR levels or GH-induced activation of JAK2 and Raf-1. GH and insulin synergized in promoting cell proliferation. Further investigation suggested that insulin increased the amount of MEK bound to KSR (kinase suppressor of Ras) and restored the second GH-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of KSR. A previous GH exposure also resulted in desensitized phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3. However, insulin did not restore a second GH-induced phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3. Our study suggests that in the liver signaling via the MEK/ERK pathway may become resensitized to repeated GH pulses in the presence of insulin.

Secondary antibodies, including horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse antibody and anti-rabbit antibody were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Cell Culture and Treatments—Rat H4IIE hepatoma cells (from ATCC) were cultured in Swim's medium (United States Biological, Swampscott, MA) supplemented with 10% serum (5% horse serum, 3% newborn calf serum, and 2% fetal calf serum) and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. At ∼50% confluence cells were removed from serum and maintained in serum-free (and bovine serum albumin-free) medium for 48 h before the start of experimental treatments. For the washing experiments, medium was removed by aspiration after the first exposure to GH, and the cells were gently rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline followed by the addition of GH-free, serum-free medium. Protein Extraction—Cells were collected in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Cell lysates were gently rocked at 4 °C for 1 h and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were stored at −80 °C until use. Cell lysate protein concentrations were measured by the Bio-Rad Protein Assay. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—For immunoprecipitation, 1 mg of protein in lysis buffer was incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Protein G-agarose (Fast flow, Amersham Biosciences) was then added, and incubations were continued for 4 h at 4°C. Both immunoprecipitated proteins and whole cell lysate protein (50 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad MiniProtean II system) and transferred to S&S Protran BA85 membranes (Keene, NH). The Western blots were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween (TBST) and 5% milk, rinsed in TBST, incubated with the primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C, washed in TBST, and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled conventional secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins were visualized by ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences) or Supersignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate reagents (Pierce) and autoradiography. Determination of GTP-bound Ras—According to the manufacturer's instructions, cells were lysed with magnesium-containing lysis buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 10% glycerol, and 25 mm NaF. 10 μg of Raf-1 Ras-binding domain-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology) was added to 1 mg of cell lysate and gently rocked at 4 °C for 30 min. The agarose beads were washed 3 times with magnesium-containing lysis buffer and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min, and the supernatant was then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Protran BA85 membrane. GTP-bound Ras was determined by immunoblotting with total Ras antibody. BrdUrd Incorporation Assay—H4IIE cells (8 × 104) were seeded and cultured in 6-well plates. Cells were then treated as described in “Cell Culture and Treatment” (above), followed by the addition of BrdUrd (1 μm) to the medium. After 12 h, cells were stained using a BrdUrd assay kit (BD Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry for fluorescence on a FACScan. Densitometric and Statistical Analysis—Chemiluminescent images of immunoblots were analyzed by scanning densitometry. Multiple exposures of each blot were used to obtain gray-scale images of each chemiluminescent band and were quantified with the Fluorchem FC imager system (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). All data were analyzed by analysis of variance using the InStat statistical program (version 3) by GraphPad Software, Inc. (San Diego, CA).

To allow the cells to maximally recover GHR levels and GH sensitivity and to mimic a minimum 3–4-h interpulse interval in vivo, we chose 5 h as the GH-free, serum-free incubation time. Therefore, to investigate the mechanisms by which GH induced desensitization of the ERK1/2 phosphorylation, H4IIE cells were pretreated with GH for 1 h, then incubated in GH-free, serum-free medium for 5 h followed by a second GH treatment. After GH binding to GHR, JAK2 is phosphorylated and transphosphorylates GHR. We first characterized the effects of GH pretreatment on GH-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 (Tyr(P)-JAK2). GH significantly induced Tyr(P)-JAK2 by 5 min, reaching a peak by 7.5 min, and decreasing after 10 min (Fig. 1, A and B). When H4IIE cells were pretreated with GH for 1 h followed by 5 h in GH-free, serum-free medium, the second GH-induced Tyr(P)-JAK2 was maximally 70–75% that induced by GH before any pretreatment (Fig. 1, A and B), correlating well with the recovery of GHR levels that we previously reported (25Ji S. Frank S.J. Messina J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28384-28393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This suggests that, after the initial exposure to GH, the second GH exposure was able to induce Tyr(P)-JAK2. Total JAK2 protein levels were not altered after any of the GH exposures or the washing regimens (Fig. 1A). GH Induced GTP-bound Ras after GH Pretreatment and GH-free Incubation—Activation of the GHR·JAK2 complex activates Shc, which recruits Grb2·SOS to the cell membrane, where SOS can convert Ras from the GDP-bound (inactive) to the GTP-bound (active) form. Whether a second GH exposure induced Ras activation was next examined. GTP-bound Ras was induced by GH at 5 min, with a maximal increase by 7.5 min and decreased significantly by 30 min (Fig. 2, A and B). After GH pretreatment and GH-free incubation for 5 h, GH-induced GTP-bound Ras was 70–75% that induced by the initial GH treatment (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting that the ability of the second GH treatment to activate Ras was not altered by previous GH treatment and correlated with the recovery of GHR levels and GH-induced Tyr(P)-JAK2. To control for equal loading and to determine whether the effects on GTP-bound Ras were dependent on changes in the total amounts of Ras protein, whole cell lysates were directly subjected to Western blot analysis by total Ras antibody. The total cellular amount of Ras protein was not significantly affected by GH pretreatment (Fig. 2A). A Second GH Treatment Induced Serine 338 Phosphorylation of Raf-1—We next examined the ability of a second GH treatment to activate Raf-1 immediately downstream of Ras. Phosphorylation of serine 338 on Raf-1 (Ser(P)-338-Raf-1) is required for Raf-1 activation (26Diaz B. Barnard D. Filson A. MacDonald S. King A. Marshall M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4509-4516Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In H4IIE cells, the first GH treatment induced Ser(P)-338-Raf-1 maximally by 10 min and decreased thereafter (Fig. 3, A and B). The peak of Ser(P)-338-Raf-1 induced by the second GH exposure at 10 min was about 55% that induced by the first GH (Fig. 3B). However, before the second GH treatment, the basal levels of Ser(P)-338-Raf-1 were significantly reduced and were only about 70% that of the basal values before the first GH application (Fig. 3B, 0 time point, dashed line versus solid line). Thus, when expressing the induction of Ser(P)-338-Raf-1 compared with the reduced basal value, there was approximately a 1.6-fold induction by the second GH treatment. This 1.6-fold induction of Ser(P)-338-Raf-1 is less than the ∼2.1-fold induction by the first GH treatment. Therefore, the -fold induction of Ser(P)-338-Raf-1 by the second GH treatment was only 76% that of the first GH treatment. Total Raf-1 protein abundance was not changed after the second versus the first GH exposure (Fig. 3A). Collectively, the data from Figs. 1, 2, 3 suggest that after the previous GH treatment the second GH treatment was able to activate JAK2, Ras, and Raf-1, and their activation was correlated well with the recovery of GHR levels (25Ji S. Frank S.J. Messina J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28384-28393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 Induced by a Second GH Treatment Was Not Correlated with Activation of the JAK2/Ras/Raf-1 Pathway—When H4IIE cells were pretreated with GH for 1 h followed by 5 h in GH-free, serum-free media, the GH-induced phosphorylation of MEK1/2 (Fig. 4, A and B) and ERK1/2 (Fig. 4, C and D) was greatly diminished compared with that induced by GH before any pretreatment. The first GH treatment induced serine phosphorylation of MEK1/2 (Ser(P)-MEK1/2) maximally by 10 min and decreased thereafter (Fig. 4, A and B). The Ser(P)-MEK1/2 induced by the second GH treatment was 27% or less than that induced by the first exposure (Fig. 4, A and B). The second GH treatment did not achieve greater than 10–15% of the P-ERK1/2 induced by the first GH treatment (Fig. 4, C and D), consistent with our previous findings (25Ji S. Frank S.J. Messina J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28384-28393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previous study, GHR levels and GH-induced Tyr(P)-STAT5 recovered by 65–70% (Fig. 4E (25Ji S. Frank S.J. Messina J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28384-28393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)). In the present study the maximal activation of signaling intermediates upstream of MEK/ERK, including JAK2, Ras, and Raf-1, induced by the second GH treatment was about 70–75% that induced by the first GH treatment (Fig. 4E), possibly resulting from the recovered GHR levels and similar to GH-induced Tyr(P)-STAT5. However, the ability of the second GH treatment to activate MEK/ERK was only 15–25% that induced by the first GH treatment, suggesting a disconnect of signal transduction from Raf-1 to MEK1/2 (Fig. 4E). GH Induced Desensitization of STAT1 and STAT3 Phosphorylation—GH can activate two other STATs, STAT1 and STAT3, in addition to STAT5 in H4IIE cells (27Xu J. Ji S. Venable D.Y. Franklin J.L. Messina J.L. J. Endocrinol. 2005; 184: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A second GH treatment can induce Tyr(P)-STAT5 in H4IIE cells (25Ji S. Frank S.J. Messina J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28384-28393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), but it was not known whether STAT1 and STAT3 can be activated by a second GH treatment. Therefore, the ability of a second GH treatment to activate/phosphorylate these two STATs was also examined. The first GH treatment induced a maximal 15-fold tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 (Tyr(P)-STAT1) (Fig. 5, A and B) and 6-fold of Tyr(P)-STAT3 (Fig. 5, C and D). Consistent with our previous report (25Ji S. Frank S.J. Messina J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28384-28393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), Tyr(P)-STAT5 was induced by the second GH treatment (Fig. 5A, row 2) but to a lesser degree due to the recovery of GHR by only ∼65–75% at this time point. Unlike Tyr(P)-STAT5, little Tyr(P)-STAT1 was induced by the second GH treatment (Fig. 5, A, row 1, and B). Basal Tyr(P)-STAT3 levels were elevated after 5 h of incubation in the absence of GH after the initial GH treatment (Fig. 5, C and D, dashed line, 0 time point). On the top of this elevated basal Tyr(P)-STAT3 levels, there was no significant induction of Tyr(P)-STAT3 observed in cells exposed to the second GH treatment (Fig. 5, C and D). However, leukemia inhibitory factor, another JAK activator, was still able to fully stimulate phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 after removal of GH and incubation in GH-free, serum-free medium (Fig. 5, A and C, rows 1). Therefore, similar to the MEK/ERK pathway, but unlike STAT5, the first GH treatment led to desensitization of the ability of a second GH treatment to induce Tyr(P)-STAT1 and Tyr(P)-STAT3. Insulin Restored a Second GH-induced ERK1/2 Phosphorylation—In adult male rats, insulin normally peaks in the middle of GH interpulse interval (28Even P. Danguir J. Nicolaidis S. Rougeot C. Dray F. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: R772-R778PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin is known to maintain GHR levels in vivo, which may be related to the growth-promoting effects of insulin (29Baxter R.C. Bryson J.M. Turtle J.R. Endocrinology. 1980; 107: 1176-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 30Bereket A. Lang C.H. Blethen S.L. Gelato M.C. Fan J. Frost R.A. Wilson T.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 13434-13442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). But the possible effects of insulin on repeated GH-induced signaling have yet to be studied. Therefore, we examined whether insulin affected GH-induced signaling pathways after a second exposure to GH. To mimic the in vivo GH and insulin secretory pattern, H4IIE cells were exposed to GH for 1 h, incubated in the absence of GH for 3 h, and then treated with insulin for 2 h followed by a second GH treatment (the time between two GH treatments was held at 5 h). As shown in Fig. 4, in the absence of GH for 5 h after the first GH treatment, a second GH-induced P-ERK1/2 was barely observed compared with the first GH treatment (Fig. 6, A, row 1, lanes 2 versus 4, and B). However, with insulin pretreatment for 2 h, the second GH treatment significantly induced P-ERK1/2, reaching ∼70% that induced by the first GH treatment (Fig. 6, A, row 1, compare lanes 2 and 4 to lane 7, and B). This induction was much greater than the sum of P-ERK1/2 induced by the second GH for 10 min without insulin treatment (Fig. 6A, row 1, lane 4) plus the P-ERK1/2 induced by insulin treatment for 2 h (Fig. 6A, row 1, lane 6). Because the GH interpulse interval in male rats is about 3 h, we then asked whether insulin had similar effects when given in the middle of a 3-h GH interpulse interval. Similarly, insulin pretreatment for 1 h also significantly restored the ability of a second GH treatment to induce P-ERK1/2 (Fig. 6, C and D). Therefore, we chose 3-h GH interpulse interval and 1-h insulin treatment in the following investigation of the mechanisms by which insulin restored GH-induced P-ERK1/2. Because insulin also activates ERK1/2, it could not be excluded that the second GH exposure potentiates insulin activation via ERK1/2. The other major signaling pathway activated by insulin is the PI3K/Akt pathway; therefore, the effects of the second GH treatment on insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt was also investigated. GH-induced P-Akt in H4IIE cells was weak (Figs. 6, A and C, rows 3, lanes 2). Insulin-induced P-Akt remained highly elevated after insulin treatment for 2 or 1 h (Figs. 6, A and C, rows 3, lanes 6), and the second addition of GH did not affect insulin-induced P-Akt levels (Figs. 6, A and C, rows 3, lanes 7). Our previous work (34Xu J. Keeton A.B. franklin J.L. Li X. Venable D.Y. Frank S.J. Messina J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 982-992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) also suggests that the time course of ERK1/2 activation by insulin and by GH in H4IIE cells are different. GH induced P-ERK1/2 with a maximal induction by 10 min and returned toward basal levels after 20 min. In contrast, insulin induced P-ERK1/2 peaks by 5 min, which quickly decreased after 5 min, reaching a secondary plateau level and returning toward basal levels between 60 and 120 min. In the present study, after the first GH exposure, incubation in serum-free medium plus insulin treatment, and then a second exposure to GH, P-ERK1/2 peaked at 10 min and then returned toward basal levels after 20 min (data not shown). Therefore, the resensitization of P-ERK1/2 after the second GH addition occurred over the normal GH time course not the insulin time course (quicker and more prolonged). Our data strongly suggest that insulin re-sensitizes GH-induced ERK1/2 signaling. Insulin Did Not Affect a Second GH-induced Tyrosine Phosphorylation of STAT5, STAT1, and STAT3—Whether insulin affected the ability of a second GH treatment to activate STAT protein phosphorylation was then determined. The first GH treatment resulted in a 20–25-fold induction of Tyr(P)-STAT5 (Fig. 7, A, row 1, lanes 1 versus 2, and B). Consistent with our previous findings (25Ji S. Frank S.J. Messina J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28384-28393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), after 3 h of GH-free, serum-free incubation, the ability of a second GH treatment to induce Tyr(P)-STAT5 recovered by about 60–70% of that induced by the initial GH treatment (Fig. 7, A, row 1, lanes 2 versus 4, and B). Important for this work, the Tyr(P)-STAT5 induced by a second GH treatment was not significantly altered by insulin treatment (Fig. 7A, row 1, lanes 4 versus 7, and B). As described in Fig. 5, a previous GH treatment also resulted in a desensitization of Tyr(P)-STAT1 and Tyr(P)-STAT3 (Fig. 7A, rows 2 and 3, lanes 2 versus 4). In contrast with ERK1/2, however, insulin did not restor"
https://openalex.org/W2031949817,"The shufflon of plasmid R64 consists of four DNA segments separated and flanked by seven sfx recombination sites. Rci-mediated recombination between any inverted sfx sequences causes inversion of the DNA segments independently or in groups. The R64 shufflon selects one of seven pilV genes encoding type IV pilus adhesins, in which the N-terminal region is constant, while the C-terminal regions are variable. The R64 sfx sequences are asymmetric. The sfx central region and right arm sequences are conserved, but left arm sequences are not. Here we constructed a symmetric sfx sequence, in which the sfx left arm sequence was changed to the inverted repeat of the right arm sequence and made artificial shufflon segments carrying symmetric sfx sequences in inverted or direct orientations. The symmetric sfx sequence exhibited the highest inversion frequency in a shufflon segment flanked by two inverted sfx sequences. Rci-dependent deletion of a shufflon segment flanked by two direct symmetric sfx sequences was observed, suggesting that asymmetry of R64 sfx sequences inhibits recombination between direct sfx sequences. In addition, intermolecular recombination between symmetric sfx sequences was also observed. The extra C-terminal domain of Rci was shown to be essential for inversion of the R64 shufflon using asymmetric sfx sequences but not essential for recombination using symmetric sfx sequences, suggesting that the Rci C-terminal segment helps the binding of Rci to asymmetric sfx sequences.

Rci protein lacking the C-terminal domain bound to both arms of symmetric sfx sequence but only to the right arm of asymmetric sfx sequence. Conservative site-specific recombination plays a key role in creating biological diversity in prokaryotes (1Komano T. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 2Craig N.L. Craig N.L. Craigie R. Gellert M. Lambowitz A.M. Mobile DNA II. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 3-11Crossref Google Scholar). Site-specific recombination systems are classified into two distinctive groups, integration-excision and inversion systems, according to the relative location of the two recombination sites. When the recombination sites lie on different DNA molecules, recombination between them results in integration or fusion of two DNA molecules. When the sites lie on the same DNA in direct orientation, recombination between them results in excision or resolution of the DNA segment. Integration and excision of λ phage into and out of the Escherichia coli chromosome may be one of the best examples of this mechanism (3Azaro M.A. Landy A. Craig N.L. Craigie R. Gellert M. Lambowitz A.M. Mobile DNA II. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 118-148Crossref Google Scholar). When the recombination sites lie on the same DNA in the inverted orientation, recombination between them results in inversion of the DNA segment. In many bacterial pathogens, antigenic variation by site-specific recombination is important to escape from host immune systems. In plasmid conjugation and phage infection, DNA inversion by site-specific recombination is used to enlarge recipient and host specificity, respectively. While most site-specific recombination systems consist of two recombination sites and the cognate recombinase gene, several multiple DNA inversion systems containing more than two recombination sites as well as the recombinase gene have been reported after the discovery of shufflon in IncI1 plasmid R64 (4Komano T. Kubo A. Kayanuma T. Furuichi T. Nisioka T. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 94-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Komano T. Kubo A. Nisioka T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1165-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The R64 shufflon is located at the 3′ end of the pilV gene and consists of four invertible DNA segments, which are separated and flanked by seven shufflon-specific recombination sites, sfx sites (Fig. 1AB). The rci gene, located adjacent to shufflon region, encodes a site-specific recombinase of the integrase family (6Kubo A. Kusukawa A. Komano T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 213: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Rci-mediated recombination between any two sfx sites in inverted orientation results in inversion of the shufflon segments independently or in groups. Shufflon recombination selects one of seven different pilV genes encoding adhesins in which the N-terminal region is constant, while the C-terminal region is variable. If recombination occurs between direct sfx sites within a single shufflon region, the DNA segment(s) flanked by them will be deleted. If recombination occurs between sfx sites on different DNA molecules, plasmids with a complicated shufflon will be produced. However, no such recombination has been observed during our experiments. The pilV gene is the last in the pil operon encoding a type IV pilus called the thin pilus of plasmid R64 (7Kim S.-R. Komano T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3594-3603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PilV adhesins, most likely located at the tip of thin pilus, determine the recipient specificity in R64 liquid matings via recognition of lipopolysaccharide of recipient cells (8Komano T. Kim S.-R. Yoshida T. Nisioka T. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 6-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The C-terminal segments of PilV adhesins were demonstrated to specifically bind to lipopolysaccharide of recipient cells (9Ishiwa A. Komano T. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 615-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In our previous study (10Gyohda A. Komano T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2787-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), R64 Rci protein was overexpressed and purified. In vitro shufflon inversion was observed in a reaction mixture that contained purified Rci protein and supercoiled DNA of a plasmid carrying a shufflon segment. When a DNA fragment carrying an sfx sequence was incubated with Rci protein, specific cleavages were introduced into both strands of DNA in the form of 5′-protruding 7-bp staggered cut at the sfx site (downward and upward arrows in Fig. 1B), suggesting that DNA cleavage and rejoining take place at these positions (11Gyohda A. Furuya N. Kogure N. Komano T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 975-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As a result, the left and right arms of R64 sfx sites were found to be asymmetric in sequence feature (Fig. 1B). Recombination sites of most known integrase family recombination systems are symmetric, consisting of a 6- to 8-bp central spacer (crossover) sequence and 11- to 13-bp inverted repeat sequences, which function as recombinase-binding elements (12Van Duyne G.D. Craig N.L. Craigie R. Gellert M. Lambowitz A.M. Mobile DNA II. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 93-117Crossref Google Scholar). The R64 sfx sequences consist of a 7-bp spacer sequence and 12-bp left and right arms. The spacer sequences and right arm sequences are highly conserved among various R64 sfx sequences and classified into four types, sfxa to sfxd, according to the three-nucleotide differences in the right arm. By contrast, the left arm sequences are not conserved or related to the right arm sequences (Fig. 1B). In DNase I footprint experiments, both right and left arms of asymmetric sfx sequences were protected (11Gyohda A. Furuya N. Kogure N. Komano T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 975-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The sequence of the sfx left arm strongly affected the frequency of shufflon inversion. A model was proposed in which one molecule of Rci binds to the sfx right arm in a sequence-specific manner and the second molecule of Rci binds to the sfx left arm in a non-sequence-specific manner (11Gyohda A. Furuya N. Kogure N. Komano T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 975-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 6A). The extra C-terminal domain of Rci protein was postulated to be involved in its binding to the sfx left arm. In the present study, a symmetric sfx site, in which the sfx left arm sequence was changed to the inverted repeat of the right arm sequence, was constructed and artificial shufflon segments carrying symmetric sfx site in inverted or direct orientations were made. The symmetric sfx site exhibited the highest inversion frequency in a shufflon segment flanked by two sfx sites in inverted orientation. In addition, for a shufflon segment flanked by two symmetric sfx sites in direct orientation, rci-dependent deletion was observed, suggesting that asymmetry of R64 sfx sites inhibits recombination between direct sfx sites.

Kogure N. Komano T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 975-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Luria-Bertani (LB) medium was prepared as described previously (14Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Solid media contained 1.5% agar. Antibiotics were added to liquid or solid media at the following concentrations: ampicillin, 100 μg/ml; chloramphenicol, 25 μg/ml; and kanamycin, 50 μg/ml. Construction of Plasmids—All recombinant plasmids were constructed as described previously (14Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). The ScaI site of pACYC177 was converted to an EcoRI site to give pACYC177E. To construct the rci+ plasmid pKK097, a 1313-bp R64 sequence (nucleotide numbers 17,608 to 18,920 of the sequence under GenBank™ accession number AB027308, the same sequence as pKK098) was inserted into the KpnI-BamHI site of pTK219 carrying pSC101 rep. The rci gene in pKK097 and pKK098 was converted to an rci-lacZ fusion gene. Comparison of β-galactosidase activity between E. coli cells harboring the resultant plasmids suggested that Rci expression in pKK098 is ∼5-fold higher than that in pKK097. A 2115-bp R64 sequence (nucleotide numbers 15,509–17,623) carrying the entire shufflon region was inserted into the AccI-SphI site of pUC18 to give pAG105. pINV- and pDEL-series plasmids carrying artificial shufflon segments were constructed as described previously (11Gyohda A. Furuya N. Kogure N. Komano T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 975-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides corresponding to both strands of sfxaa201 were annealed and inserted into one or both ends of an artificial shufflon segment in the inverted or direct orientations as described in the legend to Fig. 1C. sfxa101 and sfxaa201 were inserted into the PstI site of pUC18 to give pASYM101 and pSYM201, respectively. sfxaa201 was inserted into the BamHI-HindIII site of pACYC184 to give pSYM210. Isolation of rci mutants will be described elsewhere. In Vivo and in Vitro Recombination Assays—For in vivo recombination assays, pINV- or pDEL-series plasmids carrying various sfx sequences were introduced into E. coli cells harboring the rci+ plasmid pKK098 or pKK097, and the cells were grown at 37 °C. At intervals, plasmid DNA was extracted by the alkaline extraction method (14Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was analyzed by electrophoresis on a 0.7% agarose gel before or after EcoRI digestion. The in vivo inversion frequency is indicated as inversions per generation (11Gyohda A. Furuya N. Kogure N. Komano T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 975-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), while the initial in vivo deletion frequency is indicated as deletions per generation. Rci protein was purified and the in vitro recombination assay was performed as described previously (10Gyohda A. Komano T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2787-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Reaction mixtures containing 32 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 15 mm NaCl, 80 mm KCl, 4 mm spermidine, 0.7 mm EDTA, 22% glycerol, 38.5 nm supercoiled pSYM201 DNA, and 68 nm Rci protein were incubated at 37 °C. After termination of the reaction by the addition of SDS, the product DNA was collected by ethanol precipitation and subjected to electrophoresis on a 0.7% agarose gel. DNase I Footprint Analyses—Rci wt 2The abbreviation used is: wt, wild type. and Rci292 proteins were purified and DNase I footprint analyses were performed, as described previously (10Gyohda A. Komano T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2787-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 11Gyohda A. Furuya N. Kogure N. Komano T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 975-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Varying amounts of Rci wt or Rci292 protein and 5′ end-labeled DNA fragments (0.1 pmol) were mixed in a 100-μl buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 200 mm KCl, 5 mm spermidine, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 11% glycerol, and 5 μg of sonicated salmon testis DNA). Then 0.5 unit of DNase I was added and incubated at 30 °C for 7 min. Following phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on a sequencing gel. The cleavage pattern was visualized by autoradiography. Construction and Activity of Symmetric sfx Sequence—In our previous study (11Gyohda A. Furuya N. Kogure N. Komano T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 975-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), we found that the R64 sfx sequences are asymmetric and that the sfx left arm sequences greatly affect inversion frequency. To examine the significance of asymmetry of sfx sequences in the R64 shufflon, we constructed a symmetric sfxaa201 sequence, in which the sfx left arm sequence was changed to the inverted repeat of the right arm sequence (Fig. 1B). The sfxaa201 sequence was inserted into tester plasmids carrying an artificial shufflon segment (Fig. 1C). pINV201 and pINV202 carried one or two sfxaa201 sequences at one or both ends of the artificial shufflon segment in inverted orientation, respectively, while pDEL301 and pDEL302 carried one or two sfxaa201 sequences at one or both ends of the artificial shufflon segment in direct orientation, respectively. pINV101, pINV109, pINV201, and pINV202 plasmids were introduced into E. coli cells harboring the rci+ plasmid pKK098 (P15A ori), and the transformed cells were grown overnight. Plasmid DNA was extracted from the cells and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2A). While only monomer bands of pINV101 or pINV109 as well as pKK098 were observed (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4), many DNA bands of pINV201 and pINV202 were observed in the presence of pKK098 (lanes 5 and 6). From the estimation of the sizes of multiple DNA bands it was shown that they corresponded to multimers of pINV201 and pINV202, suggesting the occurrence of intermolecular recombination using sfxaa201. When pINV series DNAs were digested with EcoRI, two sets of DNA bands, from the original and shufflon-inverted forms of plasmids, were observed (data not shown). The densities of the original and inverted bands were similar even 3 h after the introduction of pINV201 and pINV202 into E. coli cells harboring pKK098, indicating high recombination activity of sfxaa201. pINV series plasmids were introduced into E. coli cells harboring pKK097, in which rci was cloned into a low copy number plasmid pTK219 (pSC101 rep) (Fig. 2B). Rci activity from pKK097 was ∼10-fold less than that from pKK098 for the inversion of pINV101 and pINV109 (Fig. 1C), probably according to the difference in their copy number. Under these conditions, the inversion frequency of pINV201 and pINV202 was 20–30-fold higher than that of pINV109, which exhibited the highest activity among R64 sfx sequences (11Gyohda A. Furuya N. Kogure N. Komano T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 975-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) (Figs. 1C and 2B). These results indicate that the symmetric recombination sequence, sfxaa201, possessed much higher inversion activity than R64 sfx sequences. Deletion of the Shufflon Segment Flanked by Symmetric sfx Sequences in Direct Orientation—pDEL301 and pDEL302 were introduced into E. coli cells harboring pKK097 or pKK098. Multimers of pDEL301 and pDEL302 were also produced (Fig. 2A, lanes 7 and 8). EcoRI digestion of plasmid DNAs suggested the formation of short DNAs (Fig. 2B, lanes 7 and 8). Restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing of small plasmid DNAs indicated that small plasmids are produced by the recombination between sfxaa201 and sfxa112 of pDEL301, or between sfxaa201 and sfxaa201 of pDEL302, resulting in the deletion of the shufflon segment. Small plasmids carrying sfxa112 and sfxaa201 were produced from pDEL301 and pDEL302, respectively. The rate of shufflon deletion in pDEL302 was 7–15-fold higher than that of pDEL301 (Fig. 1C). These results indicated that Rci-dependent deletion of the shufflon segment flanked by symmetric sfx sequences in the direct orientation is possible, which has never been observed in the R64 shufflon. These findings suggest that asymmetry of R64 sfx sequences inhibits recombination between direct sfx sequences. Intermolecular Recombination between Symmetric sfx Sequences—In the experiments in Fig. 2A, plasmid multimer formation by the intermolecular recombination between symmetric sfx sequences was suggested. To confirm this, a pUC18 derivative plasmid pSYM201 carrying one sfxaa201 sequence was constructed. When the control plasmid pASYM101 carrying one asymmetric sfxa101 sequence was introduced into E. coli cells harboring pKK098, only the original monomer plasmid DNA was detected (Fig. 3A, lane 5). For pSYM201 carrying symmetric sfxaa201, a series of multimer bands were formed in the presence of rci (lane 8). The multimerization of pSYM201 DNA was confirmed by the finding that only the monomer band was recovered when the mixture of multimers was digested with EcoRI or HindIII (data not shown). The multimer level reached more than 10mer. Even-numbered multimers were more frequent than odd-numbered multimers. No multimer formation was observed in the absence of rci (lane 7). Octamer DNA of pSYM201 was isolated by transformation (lane 9). When it was introduced into cells harboring pKK098, many multimer bands were again formed (lane 11). These results indicate the occurrence of in vivo intermolecular recombination between symmetric sfx sequences, which has never been observed in shufflon recombination of R64. When pSYM210 carrying one symmetric sfxaa201 sequence in pACYC184 was introduced into E. coli cells harboring pKK097, a series of multimer bands were also formed (Fig. 3B, lane 5). When pSYM201 and pSYM210 were simultaneously present in rci+ E. coli, a mixture of pSYM201 and pSYM210 multimers were formed (lane 6). Fusion plasmids containing one copy of pSYM210 and one to five copies of pSYM201 were recovered by transformation (lanes 7–11). When these plasmids were introduced into rci+ E. coli, a mixture of pSYM201 and pSYM210 multimers were again produced (data not shown). These results indicate that fusion and resolution of plasmids using symmetric sfx sequences are possible. In vitro recombination assay was performed using supercoiled pSYM201 DNA and purified Rci protein (Fig. 3C). A closed circular monomer band of pSYM201 DNA and a small amount of open circular band were seen at the beginning of the reaction. A dimer band appeared after 5 min and increased in amount during incubation. At the late stages of incubation a tetramer band also appeared. These results indicate the occurrence of in vitro intermolecular recombination between symmetric sfx sequences. The C-terminal Multimer Formation Domain of Rci Is Not Required for Recombination Using Symmetric sfx Sequences—In our previous work (11Gyohda A. Furuya N. Kogure N. Komano T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 975-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), it was postulated that the extra C-terminal domain of Rci is involved in the non-sequence-specific binding of Rci to the left arm of asymmetric sfx sequences. To examine this postulation, two missense mutants, Rci F297S and L326H, and two deletion mutants, Rci D284am and L344am, in the Rci C-terminal region were constructed. A mutant, Rci Y271F, of the active center tyrosine was also constructed. pAG105 contained a fixed R64 shufflon region carrying seven asymmetric sfx sequences. Many DNA bands were produced from pAG105 by multiple inversions in the presence of the wild-type Rci (Fig. 4A, lane 3). In contrast, all of the five Rci mutants were inactive for shufflon inversions in pAG105 (Fig. 4A, lanes 4–8), indicating that the Rci C-terminal domain is essential for the R64 shufflon inversions using asymmetric sfx sequences. For inversion between symmetric sfxaa201 sequence and asymmetric sfxa112 sequence of pINV201, only the Rci L326H mutant exhibited low activity among Rci C-terminal mutants (Fig. 4B). For deletion between sfxaa201 and sfxa112 sequences of pDEL301, Rci C-terminal mutants exhibited no recombination activity (Fig. 4C). For inversion between the two symmetric sfxaa201 sequences of pINV202, Rci D284am, F297S, L326H, and L344am mutants were active, whereas their activities were lower than that of the wild-type Rci (Fig. 4D). For deletion between two symmetric sfxaa201 sequences of pDEL302, Rci D284am, F297S, L326H, and L344am mutants exhibited one-third the level of activity as the wild-type Rci (Fig. 4E), indicating that the Rci C-terminal domain is not required for recombination using symmetric sfx sequences. The Rci Y271F mutant exhibited no activity for all substrates. For intermolecular recombination using symmetric sfxaa201 of pSYM201, Rci F297S, L326H, and L344am mutants exhibited similar levels of multimerization activity as the wild type (Fig. 4F). The Rci D284am mutant exhibited weak activity for intermolecular recombination, while the Rci Y271F mutant exhibited no activity. These results indicate that most of the Rci C-terminal domain is nonessential for intermolecular recombination using symmetric sfx sequences. Effects of the four Rci C-terminal mutations on various shufflon recombinations using symmetric or asymmetric sfx sequences are summarized in Fig. 4G. When these results were combined, it may be concluded that the C-terminal multimer formation domain of Rci is not required for recombination using symmetric sfx sequences. Role of the Rci C-terminal Multimer Formation Domain in Binding to Asymmetric and Symmetric sfx Sequences—Previously, specific binding of Rci to R64 sfx sequences was demonstrated (10Gyohda A. Komano T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2787-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 11Gyohda A. Furuya N. Kogure N. Komano T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 975-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To examine the role of the Rci C-terminal domain in its binding to asymmetric and symmetric sfx sequences, DNase I footprint analyses were performed (Fig. 5). Intact Rci (Rci wt) and Rci292, carrying N-terminal 292 amino acids of Rci, were purified. Rci wt protected both arms of asymmetric sfxa101 sequence from DNase I cleavage as was found previously (11Gyohda A. Furuya N. Kogure N. Komano T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 975-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A). Rci292 protected only the right arm of sfxa101, whereas strong enhancement was noted for the left arm of sfxa101 by Rci292 binding (dots in Fig. 5B). These results suggest that the Rci C-terminal domain plays a key role for its binding to the both arms of asymmetric sfx sequences. In contrast, Rci wt and Rci292 protected both arms of symmetric sfxaa201 sequence (Fig. 5, C and D). It seems that Rci292 bound to symmetric sfxaa201 sequence more tightly than Rci wt. We have also purified Rci310 and found similar protection patterns of sfxa101 and sfxaa201 as Rci292 (data not shown). These results suggest that Rci can bind to the conserved 12-bp arm sequences of symmetric sfx sequences by itself even without the C-terminal domain. Different levels of complexity are known for various conservative site-specific recombination systems using integrase family recombinases. The λ Int system is rather complex (3Azaro M.A. Landy A. Craig N.L. Craigie R. Gellert M. Lambowitz A.M. Mobile DNA II. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 118-148Crossref Google Scholar). Int and IHF proteins are required for λ integration, while the Xis protein is additionally required for excision. The attB site is ∼21 bp long, while the attP site, containing attP core site, is ∼243 bp long. The attB and attP core sites consist of 7-bp central regions flanked by core-type Int-binding inverted-repeat sequences. The attP site also contains arm-type Int-, IHF-, and Xis-binding sites. In contrast, only the Cre protein and two 34-bp loxP sites are required for the P1 Cre-loxP system (16Sauer B. Craig N.L. Craigie R. Gellert M. Lambowitz A.M. Mobile DNA II. ASM Press, Washington D. C.2002: 38-58Crossref Google Scholar). The loxP site consists of a 6-bp central region flanked by 14-bp Cre-binding inverted-repeat sequences. The loxP central region is asymmetric and determines its orientation. Cre promotes intramolecular excision and inversion reactions as well as intermolecular integration reactions. Van Duyne and co-workers (12Van Duyne G.D. Craig N.L. Craigie R. Gellert M. Lambowitz A.M. Mobile DNA II. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 93-117Crossref Google Scholar, 17Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Nature. 1997; 389: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 18Gopaul D.N. Guo F. Van Duyne G.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4175-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 19Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7143-7148Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) analyzed three kinds of Cre-DNA reaction intermediates by x-ray crystallography using modified loxP DNA substrates. In the first complex, two Cre molecules bind to each arm of lox DNA, which induces a keen kink at the lox site. Two Cre-lox complexes assemble and form a synaptic complex. In the second complex, the OH groups of the active center tyrosine in two Cre molecules bind to the 3′ end phosphate of recombining strands of lox DNA, forming a phosphodiester bond. In the third complex, four Cre molecules bind to the Holliday junction DNA at the lox site. The three complexes exhibit a pseudo-4-fold symmetry. Later Cre-DNA reaction intermediates containing loxP site in which the central region is asymmetric were analyzed (20Martin S.S. Pulido E. Chu V.C. Lechner T.S. Baldwin E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 107-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21Ennifar E. Meyer J.E. Buchholz F. Stewart A.F. Suck D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 15: 5449-5460Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Among four Cre molecules in the complexes, two Cre molecules exhibit “cleaving” (cleavage-component) subunit conformation, and the other two Cre molecules exhibit “noncleaving” subunit conformation. A switch between cleaving and non-cleaving conformations regulates sequential cleaving and rejoining reactions of top and bottom strands. The loxP top strand was shown to be exchanged at first. Introduction of C to G mutation into the left arm of loxP site resulted in misorientation of loxP DNA in the complex. On the other hand, Rci and HU proteins are required for the R64 shufflon system (10Gyohda A. Komano T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2787-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 22Wada M. Kutsukake K. Komano T. Imamoto F. Kano Y. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 76: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). R64 sfx sites consist of conserved 7-bp central region and 12-bp right arm sequences and a nonconserved 12-bp left arm sequence, indicating that R64 sfx sequences are asymmetric. Only intramolecular inversions have been observed in the R64 shufflon. In the present study, a symmetric sfxaa201 sequence was shown to exhibit the highest inversion frequency. When two sfxaa201 sequences are located in direct orientation, Rci-mediated deletion of a DNA segment flanked by them was observed. In addition, Rci-mediated intermolecular recombination using the sfxaa201 sequence was observed, whereas intermolecular recombination never occurs in the R64 shufflon system. These results strongly suggest that asymmetry of the R64 sfx sites inhibits intramolecular recombination between direct sfx sites and intermolecular recombination. Asymmetry of sfx arm sequences may emphasize the differences in cleaving and noncleaving conformations of Rci subunits. In many site-specific recombination systems, the length of spacer sequence in recombination site may be important. Deletion of one nucleotide from the loxP and attP sites dramatically reduced the recombination activity (23Abremski K. Wierzbicki A. Frommer B. Hoess R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 391-396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Nash H.A. Robertson C.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3523-3533Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Symmetric recombination sites with one nucleotide deletion (sfxaa231, CCACGTACCGGGTGCCAATCCGGTACGTGG) and one nucleotide insertion (sfxaa232, CCACGTACCGGATGTGCCAATCCGGTACGTGG) were constructed. The inversion frequency of pINV231 or pINV232 carrying sfxaa231 or sfxaa232 at one site and sfxa112 at the other site was 0.0018 and 0.0025, respectively, in the presence of pKK098. pINV231 and pINV232 did not produce multimer bands. These results indicate that the length of spacer sequence of symmetric sfx sequence should be seven base pairs to exhibit high inversion activity and intermolecular recombination. Most site-specific recombinases in the integrase family consist of a DNA-binding domain and a catalytic domain, which contains conserved box I and box II sequences. Phage integrases carry an extra N-terminal domain, which binds to the attP arm-type binding sites. The C termini of most recombinases are located shortly after the box II sequences. In contrast, Rci carries an extra C-terminal multimer formation domain that is essential for recombination in the R64 shufflon using asymmetric sfx sites. Here, Rci protein lacking the C-terminal multimer formation domain was shown to promote recombination using symmetric sfx sites. These situations can be explained as shown in Fig. 6. One molecule of Rci initially binds to the conserved right arm of asymmetric sfx sequences in a sequence-specific manner. Then the C-terminal multimer formation domain of the Rci molecule bound to the sfx right arm recruits the second molecule of Rci, which binds to the sfx left arm in a non-sequence-specific manner (Fig. 6A). For this mechanism, the Rci C-terminal domain is essential, and only the intramolecular inversion reaction is permitted. In contrast, Rci molecules can bind to both arms of the symmetric sfx sequences by itself in a sequence-specific manner (Fig. 6B). For this mechanism, the Rci C-terminal domain is not essential and intramolecular inversion, and deletion reactions as well as intermolecular reactions are possible. Recently, several multiple inversion systems using integrase family recombinases have been reported in Mycoplasma pulmonis, Mycobacterium bovis, and Bacteroides fragilis (25Shen X. Gumulak J. Yu H. French C.T. Zou N. Dybvig K. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2900-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 26Lysnyansky I. Ron Y. Yogev D. J.

These systems control antigenic variations of surface proteins and capsular polysaccharides as well as type I restriction specificities. Most of recombination sites of these multiple inversion systems appear to be asymmetric (29Sitaraman R. Denison A.M. Dybvig K. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1033-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Further studies on the recognition of sfx sequences by Rci may contribute to understanding the shufflon systems."
