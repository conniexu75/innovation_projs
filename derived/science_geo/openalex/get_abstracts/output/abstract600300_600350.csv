https://openalex.org/W2775399334,"The present study evaluated brain connectivity using electroencephalography (EEG) data from 14 patients with schizophrenia and 14 healthy controls. Phase-Locking Value (PLV), Phase-Lag Index (PLI) and Directed Transfer Function (DTF) were calculated for the original EEG data and following current source density (CSD) transformation, re-referencing using the average reference electrode (AVERAGE) and reference electrode standardization techniques (REST). The statistical analysis of adjacency matrices was carried out using indices based on graph theory. Both CSD and REST reduced the influence of volume conducted currents. The largest group differences in connectivity were observed for the alpha band. Schizophrenic patients showed reduced connectivity strength, as well as a lower clustering coefficient and shorter characteristic path length for both measures of phase synchronization following CSD transformation or REST re-referencing. Reduced synchronization was accompanied by increased directional flow from the occipital region for the alpha band. Following the REST re-referencing, the sources of alpha activity were located at parietal rather than occipital derivations. The results of PLV and DTF demonstrated group differences in fronto-posterior asymmetry following CSD transformation, while for PLI the differences were significant only using REST. The only analysis that identified group differences in inter-hemispheric asymmetry was DTF calculated for REST. Our results suggest that a comparison of different connectivity measures using graph-based indices for each frequency band, separately, may be a useful tool in the study of disconnectivity disorders such as schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2772457354,"The present research explores the relationship between anticipated emotions and pro-environmental decision making comparing two differently valenced emotions: anticipated pride and guilt. In an experimental design, we examined the causal effects of anticipated pride versus guilt on pro-environmental decision making and behavioral intentions by making anticipated emotions (i.e. pride and guilt) salient just prior to asking participants to make a series of environmental decisions. We find evidence that anticipating one’s positive future emotional state from green action just prior to making an environmental decision leads to higher pro-environmental behavioral intentions compared to anticipating one’s negative emotional state from inaction. This finding suggests a rethinking in the domain of environmental and climate change messaging, which has traditionally favored inducing negative emotions such as guilt to promote pro-environmental action. Furthermore, exploratory results comparing anticipated pride and guilt inductions to baseline behavior point toward a reactance eliciting effect of anticipated guilt."
https://openalex.org/W2774563419,"Since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011, the rich archaeological heritage of Syria and northern Iraq has faced severe threats, including looting, combat-related damage, and intentional demolition of monuments. However, the inaccessibility of the conflict zone to archaeologists or cultural heritage specialists has made it difficult to produce accurate damage assessments, impeding efforts to develop mitigation strategies and policies. This paper presents results of a project, undertaken in collaboration with the American Schools of Oriental Research (ASOR) and the US Department of State, to monitor damage to archaeological sites in Syria, northern Iraq, and southern Turkey using recent, high-resolution satellite imagery. Leveraging a large database of archaeological and heritage sites throughout the region, as well as access to continually updated satellite imagery from DigitalGlobe, this project has developed a flexible and efficient methodology to log observations of damage in a manner that facilitates spatial and temporal queries. With nearly 5000 sites carefully evaluated, analysis reveals unexpected patterns in the timing, severity, and location of damage, helping us to better understand the evolving cultural heritage crisis in Syria and Iraq. Results also offer a model for future remote sensing-based archaeological and heritage monitoring efforts in the Middle East and beyond."
https://openalex.org/W2775638497,"Pancreatic cancer, one of the deadliest cancers, is characterized by high rates of metastasis and intense desmoplasia, both of which are associated with changes in fibrillar type I collagen composition and microstructure. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a critical step of metastasis, also involves a change in extracellular matrix (ECM) context as cells detach from basement membrane (BM) and engage interstitial matrix (IM). The objective of this work was to develop and apply an in-vitro three-dimensional (3D) tumor-ECM model to define how ECM composition and biophysical properties modulate pancreatic cancer EMT. Three established pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) lines were embedded within 3D matrices prepared with type I collagen Oligomer (IM) at various fibril densities to control matrix stiffness or Oligomer and Matrigel combined at various ratios while maintaining constant matrix stiffness. Evaluation of cell morphology and protein expression at both the cellular- and population-levels revealed a spectrum of matrix-driven EMT phenotypes that were dependent on ECM composition and architecture as well as initial PDAC phenotype. In general, exposure to fibrillar IM was sufficient to drive EMT, with cells displaying spindle-shaped morphology and mesenchymal markers, and non-fibrillar BM promoted more epithelial behavior. When cultured within low density Oligomer, only a subpopulation of epithelial BxPC-3 cells displayed EMT while mesenchymal MiaPaCa-2 cells displayed more uniform spindle-shaped morphologies and mesenchymal marker expression. Interestingly, as IM fibril density increased, associated changes in spatial constraints and matrix stiffness resulted in all PDAC lines growing as tight clusters; however mesenchymal marker expression was maintained. Collectively, the comparison of these results to other in-vitro tumor models highlights the role of IM fibril microstructure in guiding EMT heterogeneity and showcases the potential of standardized 3D matrices such as Oligomer to serve as robust platforms for mechanistic study of metastasis and creation of predictive drug screening models."
https://openalex.org/W2772715574,"The oceans absorb ~25% of the annual anthropogenic CO2 emissions. This causes a shift in the marine carbonate chemistry termed ocean acidification (OA). OA is expected to influence metabolic processes in phytoplankton species but it is unclear how the combination of individual physiological changes alters the structure of entire phytoplankton communities. To investigate this, we deployed ten pelagic mesocosms (volume ~50 m3) for 113 days at the west coast of Sweden and simulated OA (pCO2 = 760 μatm) in five of them while the other five served as controls (380 μatm). We found: (1) Bulk chlorophyll a concentration and 10 out of 16 investigated phytoplankton groups were significantly and mostly positively affected by elevated CO2 concentrations. However, CO2 effects on abundance or biomass were generally subtle and present only during certain succession stages. (2) Some of the CO2-affected phytoplankton groups seemed to respond directly to altered carbonate chemistry (e.g. diatoms) while others (e.g. Synechococcus) were more likely to be indirectly affected through CO2 sensitive competitors or grazers. (3) Picoeukaryotic phytoplankton (0.2–2 μm) showed the clearest and relatively strong positive CO2 responses during several succession stages. We attribute this not only to a CO2 fertilization of their photosynthetic apparatus but also to an increased nutrient competitiveness under acidified (i.e. low pH) conditions. The stimulating influence of high CO2/low pH on picoeukaryote abundance observed in this experiment is strikingly consistent with results from previous studies, suggesting that picoeukaryotes are among the winners in a future ocean."
https://openalex.org/W2771454794,"Nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease (NTM-LD) is increasingly recognized as an important predisposing condition for the development of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA), but there are limited data on the risk factors for CPA development in NTM-LD patients. We reviewed the medical records of 566 patients who, at the time of diagnosis of NTM-LD, did not have CPA and who received ≥12 months of treatment for NTM-LD between January 2010 and June 2015. Of these patients, 41 (7.2%) developed CPA (NTM-CPA group), whereas the remaining 525 patients did not develop CPA (NTM group). The median time to the development of CPA was 18.0 months from treatment initiation for NTM-LD. The NTM-CPA group was older and had significantly higher proportions of males, current smokers, and patients with a low body mass index (<18.5 kg/m2), when compared to the NTM group. Moreover, the NTM-CPA group was more likely to have a history of tuberculosis and chronic obstructive lung disease and to have used inhaled or systemic steroids. In the NTM-CPA group, more than 40% of patients had Mycobacterium abscessus complex (MABC) as the cause of NTM-LD, and the fibrocavitary form of NTM-LD was the most common; both associations were higher than in the NTM group. Overall, 17 (3%) patients died, and the NTM-CPA group had a higher mortality rate than did the NTM group (19.5% vs. 1.7%, respectively; P<0.001). In a multivariable analysis, old age, male gender, low body mass index, chronic obstructive lung disease, systemic steroids, MABC as the etiologic organism, and the fibrocavitary form of NTM-LD remained significant predictors of development of CPA. In conclusion, CPA occurred in 7.2% of patients after initiation of treatment for NTM-LD, and some risk factors were associated with CPA development. Given the worse prognosis, early diagnosis and treatment of CPA are important in patients with NTM-LD."
https://openalex.org/W2773790897,"Proteases are one of the largest groups of hydrolytic enzymes constituting about 60% of total worldwide sales of industrial enzymes due to their wide applications in detergent, leather, textile, food and pharmaceutical industry. Microbial proteases have been preferred over animal and plant proteases because of their fundamental features and ease in production. Bacillus infantis SKS1, an alkaline protease producing bacteria has been isolated from garden soil of north India and identified using morphological, biochemical and molecular methods. 16S rDNA sequence amplified using universal primers has 99% sequence identity with corresponding gene sequence of Bacillus infantis strain FM 34 and Bacillus sp. Beige. The bacterial culture and its 16S rDNA gene sequence have been deposited to Microbial Culture Collection (Pune, India) with accession number MCC 3035 and GenBank with accession number KR092197 respectively. The partially purified extract of Bacillus infantis SKS1 was thermostable and active in presence of Mg2+, acetyl acetone and laundry detergents implicating its application in industry. Production of these enzymes using this strain was maximized by optimization of various parameters including temperature, pH, media components and other growth conditions. Our results show that fructose and dextrose serve as the best carbon sources for production of these enzymes, highlighting the use of this strain for enzyme production utilizing relatively inexpensive substrates like beet molasses and corn steep liquor. Additionally, this strain showed maximum production of enzymes at 40°C similar to bacterial species used for commercial production of alkaline proteases. Characterization of alkaline proteases from this strain of Bacillus infantis and optimization of parameters for its production would help in understanding its industrial application and large-scale production."
https://openalex.org/W2773947325,"Background Consumption of soft drinks is declining in many countries, yet energy drink sales continue to increase, particularly amongst young consumers. Little is currently known about the drivers behind these trends. Energy drinks are high in sugar and caffeine, and evidence indicates that regular or heavy use by under 18s is likely to be detrimental to health. This study aimed to explore children and young people’s attitudes and perceptions in relation to energy drinks in a UK context. Methods Eight focus groups were conducted with pupils aged 10–11 years (n = 20) and 13–14 years (n = 17) from four schools in northern England. A sub-sample also took part in a mapping exercise to generate further insights. Data were analysed using the constant comparative approach. Results Energy drinks were reportedly consumed in a variety of public and private places, generally linked to social activities, sports and computer gaming (particularly amongst boys). Participants demonstrated strong brand awareness and preferences that were linked to taste and perceived value for money. The relatively low price of energy drinks and their widespread availability were identified as key factors, along with gendered branding and marketing. Some participants demonstrated a critical approach to manufacturers’ claims and many were keen to become better informed, often through school- or peer-based interventions. Other potential interventions included age restrictions, voluntary schemes involving retailers and improved labelling. Conclusions The lack of a single dominant factor in participants’ consumption choices suggests that there is unlikely to be a ‘silver bullet’ in attempting to address this issue. However, the findings provide support for policy-level interventions that seek to change the behaviours of manufacturers and retailers as well as consumers, and actively involve children and young people where possible."
https://openalex.org/W2775401041,"Invasive monitoring of pulsatile intracranial pressure can accurately predict shunt response in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus, but may potentially cause complications such as bleeding and infection. We tested how a proposed surrogate parameter for pulsatile intracranial pressure, the phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging derived pulse pressure gradient, compared with its invasive counterpart. In 22 patients with suspected idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus, preceding invasive intracranial pressure monitoring, and any surgical shunt procedure, we calculated the pulse pressure gradient from phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging derived cerebrospinal fluid flow velocities obtained at the upper cervical spinal canal using a simplified Navier-Stokes equation. Repeated measurements of the pulse pressure gradient were also undertaken in four healthy controls. Of 17 shunted patients, 16 responded, indicating high proportion of ""true"" normal pressure hydrocephalus in the patient cohort. However, there was no correlation between the magnetic resonance imaging derived pulse pressure gradient and pulsatile intracranial pressure (R = -.18, P = .43). Pulse pressure gradients were also similar in patients and healthy controls (P = .26), and did not differ between individuals with pulsatile intracranial pressure above or below established thresholds for shunt treatment (P = .97). Assessment of pulse pressure gradient at level C2 was therefore not found feasible to replace invasive monitoring of pulsatile intracranial pressure in selection of patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus for surgical shunting. Unlike invasive, overnight monitoring, the pulse pressure gradient from magnetic resonance imaging comprises short-term pressure fluctuations only. Moreover, complexity of cervical cerebrospinal fluid flow and -pulsatility at the upper cervical spinal canal may render the pulse pressure gradient a poor surrogate marker for intracranial pressure pulsations."
https://openalex.org/W2773941940,"Rice (Oryza sativa) is very sensitive to chilling stress at seedling and reproductive stages, whereas wild rice, O. longistaminata, tolerates non-freezing cold temperatures and has overwintering ability. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of chilling tolerance (CT) in O. longistaminata should thus provide a basis for rice CT improvement through molecular breeding. In this study, high-throughput RNA sequencing was performed to profile global transcriptome alterations and crucial genes involved in response to long-term low temperature in O. longistaminata shoots and rhizomes subjected to 7 days of chilling stress. A total of 605 and 403 genes were respectively identified as up- and down-regulated in O. longistaminata under 7 days of chilling stress, with 354 and 371 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) found exclusively in shoots and rhizomes, respectively. GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses revealed that multiple transcriptional regulatory pathways were enriched in commonly induced genes in both tissues; in contrast, only the photosynthesis pathway was prevalent in genes uniquely induced in shoots, whereas several key metabolic pathways and the programmed cell death process were enriched in genes induced only in rhizomes. Further analysis of these tissue-specific DEGs showed that the CBF/DREB1 regulon and other transcription factors (TFs), including AP2/EREBPs, MYBs, and WRKYs, were synergistically involved in transcriptional regulation of chilling stress response in shoots. Different sets of TFs, such as OsERF922, OsNAC9, OsWRKY25, and WRKY74, and eight genes encoding antioxidant enzymes were exclusively activated in rhizomes under long-term low-temperature treatment. Furthermore, several cis-regulatory elements, including the ICE1-binding site, the GATA element for phytochrome regulation, and the W-box for WRKY binding, were highly abundant in both tissues, confirming the involvement of multiple regulatory genes and complex networks in the transcriptional regulation of CT in O. longistaminata. Finally, most chilling-induced genes with alternative splicing exclusive to shoots were associated with photosynthesis and regulation of gene expression, while those enriched in rhizomes were primarily related to stress signal transduction; this indicates that tissue-specific transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation mechanisms synergistically contribute to O. longistaminata long-term CT. Our findings provide an overview of the complex regulatory networks of CT in O. longistaminata."
https://openalex.org/W2774765561,"Spinach (Spinacia oleracea L., 2n = 2x = 12) is an economically important vegetable crop worldwide and one of the healthiest vegetables due to its high concentrations of nutrients and minerals. The objective of this research was to conduct genetic diversity and population structure analysis of a collection of world-wide spinach genotypes using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) markers. Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) was used to discover SNPs in spinach genotypes. Three sets of spinach genotypes were used: 1) 268 USDA GRIN spinach germplasm accessions originally collected from 30 countries; 2) 45 commercial spinach F1 hybrids from three countries; and 3) 30 US Arkansas spinach cultivars/breeding lines. The results from this study indicated that there was genetic diversity among the 343 spinach genotypes tested. Furthermore, the genetic background in improved commercial F1 hybrids and in Arkansas cultivars/lines had a different structured populations from the USDA germplasm. In addition, the genetic diversity and population structures were associated with geographic origin and germplasm from the US Arkansas breeding program had a unique genetic background. These data could provide genetic diversity information and the molecular markers for selecting parents in spinach breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W2775545276,"Alveolar bone remodelling is vital for the success of dental implants and orthodontic treatments. However, the underlying biomechanical mechanisms, in particular the function of the periodontal ligament (PDL) in bone loading and remodelling, are not well understood. The PDL is a soft fibrous connective tissue that joins the tooth root to the alveolar bone and plays a critical role in the transmission of loads from the tooth to the surrounding bone. However, due to its complex structure, small size and location within the tooth socket it is difficult to study in vivo. Finite element analysis (FEA) is an ideal tool with which to investigate the role of the PDL, however inclusion of the PDL in FE models is complex and time consuming, therefore consideration must be given to how it is included. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of including the PDL and its fibrous structure in mandibular finite element models. A high-resolution model of a human molar region was created from micro-computed tomography scans. This is the first time that the fibrous structure of the PDL has been included in a model with realistic tooth and bone geometry. The results show that omission of the PDL creates a more rigid model, reducing the strains observed in the mandibular corpus which are of interest when considering mandibular functional morphology. How the PDL is modelled also affects the strains. The inclusion of PDL fibres alters the strains in the mandibular bone, increasing the strains in the tooth socket compared to PDL modelled without fibres. As strains in the alveolar bone are thought to play a key role in bone remodelling during orthodontic tooth movement, future FE analyses aimed at improving our understanding and management of orthodontic treatment should include the fibrous structure of the PDL."
https://openalex.org/W2775780063,"The consumption of ultra-processed foods may be associated with the development of chronic diseases, both in adults and in children/adolescents. This consumption is growing worldwide, especially in low and middle-income countries. Nevertheless, its magnitude in small, poor cities from the countryside is not well characterized, especially in adolescents. This study aimed to assess the consumption of minimally processed, processed and ultra-processed foods by adolescents from a poor Brazilian city and to determine if it was associated with excess weight, high waist circumference and high blood pressure.Cross-sectional study, conducted at a public federal school that offers technical education together with high school, located in the city of Murici. Adolescents of both sexes and aged between 14-19 years old were included. Anthropometric characteristics (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure, and dietary intake data were assessed. Associations were calculated using Poisson regression models, adjusted by sex and age.At total, 249 adolescents were included, being 55.8% girls, with a mean age of 16 years-old. The consumption of minimally processed foods was inversely associated with excess weight (Adjusted Prevalence Ratio: 0.61, 95% Confidence Interval: [0.39-0.96], P = 0.03). Although the consumption of ultra-processed foods was not associated with excess weight, high blood pressure and high waist circumference, 46.2% of the sample reported eating these products more than weekly.Consumption of minimally processed food is inversely associated with excess weight in adolescents. Investments in nutritional education aiming the prevention of chronic diseases associated with the consumption of these foods are necessary."
https://openalex.org/W2772412764,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is the most common side effect of cisplatin, a widely used chemotherapy drug. Although AKI occurs in up to one third of cancer patients receiving cisplatin, effective renal protective strategies are lacking. Cisplatin targets renal proximal tubular epithelial cells leading to inflammation, reactive oxygen species, tubular cell injury, and eventually cell death. The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway is a vagus nerve-mediated reflex that suppresses inflammation via α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7nAChRs). Our previous studies demonstrated the renoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of cholinergic agonists, including GTS-21. Therefore, we examined the effect of GTS-21 on cisplatin-induced AKI. Male C57BL/6 mice received either saline or GTS-21 (4mg/kg, i.p.) twice daily for 4 days before cisplatin and treatment continued through euthanasia; 3 days post-cisplatin mice were euthanized and analyzed for markers of renal injury. GTS-21 significantly reduced cisplatin-induced renal dysfunction and injury (p<0.05). GTS-21 significantly attenuated renal Ptgs2/COX-2 mRNA and IL-6, IL-1β, and CXCL1 protein expression, as well as neutrophil infiltration after cisplatin. GTS-21 blunted cisplatin-induced renal ERK1/2 activation, as well as renal ATP depletion and apoptosis (p<0.05). GTS-21 suppressed the expression of CTR1, a cisplatin influx transporter and enhanced the expression of cisplatin efflux transporters MRP2, MRP4, and MRP6 (p<0.05). Using breast, colon, and lung cancer cell lines we showed that GTS-21 did not inhibit cisplatin's tumor cell killing activity. GTS-21 protects against cisplatin-AKI by attenuating renal inflammation, ATP depletion and apoptosis, as well as by decreasing renal cisplatin influx and increasing efflux, without impairing cisplatin-mediated tumor cell killing. Our results support further exploring the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway for preventing cisplatin-induced AKI."
https://openalex.org/W2772690963,"Background Prolonged sitting is associated with cardiometabolic and vascular disease. Despite emerging evidence regarding the acute health benefits of interrupting prolonged sitting time, the effectiveness of different modalities in older adults (who sit the most) is unclear. Methods In preparation for a future randomized controlled trial, we enrolled 10 sedentary, overweight or obese, postmenopausal women (mean age 66 years ±9; mean body mass index 30.6 kg/m2 ±4.2) in a 4-condition, 4-period crossover feasibility pilot study in San Diego to test 3 different sitting interruption modalities designed to improve glucoregulatory and vascular outcomes compared to a prolonged sitting control condition. The interruption modalities included: a) 2 minutes standing every 20 minutes; b) 2 minutes walking every hour; and c) 10 minutes standing every hour. During each 5-hr condition, participants consumed two identical, standardized meals. Blood samples, blood pressure, and heart rate were collected every 30 minutes. Endothelial function of the superficial femoral artery was measured at baseline and end of each 5-hr condition using flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Participants completed each condition on separate days, in randomized order. This feasibility pilot study was not powered to detect statistically significant differences in the various outcomes, however, analytic methods (mixed models) were used to test statistical significance within the small sample size. Results Nine participants completed all 4 study visits, one participant completed 3 study visits and then was lost to follow up. Net incremental area under the curve (iAUC) values for postprandial plasma glucose and insulin during the 5-hr sitting interruption conditions were not significantly different compared to the control condition. Exploratory analyses revealed that the 2-minute standing every 20 minutes and the 2-minute walking every hour conditions were associated with a significantly lower glycemic response to the second meal compared to the first meal (i.e., condition-matched 2-hour post-lunch glucose iAUC was lower than 2-hour post-breakfast glucose iAUC) that withstood Bonferroni correction (p = 0.0024 and p = 0.0084, respectively). Using allometrically scaled data, the 10-minute standing every hour condition resulted in an improved FMD response, which was significantly greater than the control condition after Bonferroni correction (p = 0.0033). Conclusion This study suggests that brief interruptions in prolonged sitting time have modality-specific glucoregulatory and vascular benefits and are feasible in an older adult population. Larger laboratory and real-world intervention studies of pragmatic and effective methods to change sitting habits are needed. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02743286."
https://openalex.org/W2773448137,"Algorithmic segmentation of histologically relevant regions of tissues in digitized histopathological images is a critical step towards computer-assisted diagnosis and analysis. For example, automatic identification of epithelial and stromal tissues in images is important for spatial localisation and guidance in the analysis and characterisation of tumour micro-environment. Current segmentation approaches are based on supervised methods, which require extensive training data from high quality, manually annotated images. This is often difficult and costly to obtain. This paper presents an alternative data-independent framework based on unsupervised segmentation of oropharyngeal cancer tissue micro-arrays (TMAs). An automated segmentation algorithm based on mathematical morphology is first applied to light microscopy images stained with haematoxylin and eosin. This partitions the image into multiple binary 'virtual-cells', each enclosing a potential 'nucleus' (dark basins in the haematoxylin absorbance image). Colour and morphology measurements obtained from these virtual-cells as well as their enclosed nuclei are input into an advanced unsupervised learning model for the identification of epithelium and stromal tissues. Here we exploit two Consensus Clustering (CC) algorithms for the unsupervised recognition of tissue compartments, that consider the consensual opinion of a group of individual clustering algorithms. Unlike most unsupervised segmentation analyses, which depend on a single clustering method, the CC learning models allow for more robust and stable detection of tissue regions. The proposed framework performance has been evaluated on fifty-five hand-annotated tissue images of oropharyngeal tissues. Qualitative and quantitative results of the proposed segmentation algorithm compare favourably with eight popular tissue segmentation strategies. Furthermore, the unsupervised results obtained here outperform those obtained with individual clustering algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W2775023519,"Both recovery time of post-exercise muscle oxygenation and muscle strength decline with aging. Although beetroot consumption has been shown to improve muscle oxygenation and exercise performance in adults, these effects in the elderly has not been addressed. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a beetroot-based gel (BG) on muscle O2 saturation, blood volume (tHb) and handgrip strength in the elderly in response to handgrip exercise. In a randomized crossover double-blind design, twelve older subjects consumed BG (100 g of beetroot-based gel containing ~ 12 mmol nitrate) or PLA (100 g of nitrate-depleted gel nitrate-depleted). The subjects performed a rhythmic handgrip exercise which consisted of a one 1-min set at 30% of the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of each subject, followed by a 1 min recovery. The muscle oxygenation parameters and tHb were continuously monitored by using near-infrared spectroscopy. MVC was evaluated at baseline, immediately after exercise, and 30 min afterwards. The muscle O2 resaturation rate during exercise recovery was greater in the BG when compared to PLA condition (1.43 ± 0.77 vs 1.02 ± 0.48%.s-1; P < 0.05). Significant increase was observed in tHb during exercise recovery (10.25 ± 5.47 vs 6.72 ± 4.55 μM; P < 0.05) and significant reduction of handgrip strength decline was observed 30 min after exercise in BG (- 0.24 ± 0.18 vs—0.39 ± 0.20 N; P < 0.05). In summary, a single dose of a beetroot-based gel speeds up muscle O2 resaturation, increases blood volume and improves recovery of handgrip strength after handgrip exercise in older adults."
https://openalex.org/W2775018477,"Background Tumor heterogeneity can manifest itself by sub-populations of cells having distinct phenotypic profiles expressed as diverse molecular, morphological and spatial distributions. This inherent heterogeneity poses challenges in terms of diagnosis, prognosis and efficient treatment. Consequently, tools and techniques are being developed to properly characterize and quantify tumor heterogeneity. Multiplexed immunofluorescence (MxIF) is one such technology that offers molecular insight into both inter-individual and intratumor heterogeneity. It enables the quantification of both the concentration and spatial distribution of 60+ proteins across a tissue section. Upon bioimage processing, protein expression data can be generated for each cell from a tissue field of view. Results The Multi-Omics Heterogeneity Analysis (MOHA) tool was developed to compute tissue heterogeneity metrics from MxIF spatially resolved tissue imaging data. This technique computes the molecular state of each cell in a sample based on a pathway or gene set. Spatial states are then computed based on the spatial arrangements of the cells as distinguished by their respective molecular states. MOHA computes tissue heterogeneity metrics from the distributions of these molecular and spatially defined states. A colorectal cancer cohort of approximately 700 subjects with MxIF data is presented to demonstrate the MOHA methodology. Within this dataset, statistically significant correlations were found between the intratumor AKT pathway state diversity and cancer stage and histological tumor grade. Furthermore, intratumor spatial diversity metrics were found to correlate with cancer recurrence. Conclusions MOHA provides a simple and robust approach to characterize molecular and spatial heterogeneity of tissues. Research projects that generate spatially resolved tissue imaging data can take full advantage of this useful technique. The MOHA algorithm is implemented as a freely available R script (see supplementary information)."
https://openalex.org/W2291482249,"White lupin is one of the four economically important species of the Lupinus genus and is an important grain legume in the Ethiopian farming system. However, there has been limited research effort to characterize the Ethiopian white lupin landraces. Fifteen polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to assess the genetic diversity and population structure of 212 Ethiopian white lupin (Lupinus albus) landraces and two genotypes from different species (Lupinus angustifolius and Lupinus mutabilis) were used as out-group. The SSR markers revealed 108 different alleles, 98 of them from 212 landraces and 10 from out-group genotypes, with an average of 6.5 alleles per locus. The average gene diversity was 0.31. Twenty eight landraces harbored one or more private alleles from the total of 28 private alleles identified in the 212 white lupin accessions. Seventy-seven rare alleles with a frequency of less than 5% were identified and accounted for 78.6% of the total alleles detected. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed that 92% of allelic diversity was attributed to individual accessions within populations while only 8% was distributed among populations. At 70% similarity level, the UPGMA dendrogram resulted in the formation of 13 clusters comprised of 2 to 136 landraces, with the out-group genotypes and five landraces remaining distinct and ungrouped. Population differentiation and genetic distance were relatively high between Gondar and Ethiopian white lupin populations collected by Australians. A model-based population structure analysis divided the white lupin landraces into two populations. All Ethiopian white lupin landrace populations, except most of the landraces collected by Australians (77%) and about 44% from Awi, were grouped together with significant admixtures. The study also suggested that 34 accessions, as core collections, were sufficient to retain 100% of SSR diversity. These accessions (core G-34) represent 16% of the whole 212 Ethiopian white lupin accessions and populations from West Gojam, Awi and Australian collections contributed more accessions to the core collection."

Significant positive correlation between WC and 25(OH)D level (p = 0.004) and significant negative correlation between FBG and 25(OH)D level observed (p = 0.02). WC was the only statistically significant predictor of the dependent variable. Odds of non-sufficient 25(OH)D level increased with decrease in WC.High prevalence of MS as well as vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency existed among PMW of Singur block, West Bengal, India. 25(OH)D had significant inverse and direct relationship with FBG and WC. Low 25(OH)D may be one of the potential risk factors for developing MS in PMW or vice-versa."

The current study explored the joint effects of five personality traits (i.e., extraversion, openness, neuroticism, normlessness and altruism) and global perceived stress (measured with the Perceived Stress Scale-10) on pedestrian behavior (measured with the Pedestrian Behavior Scale) in 311 Chinese individuals. Results showed that altruism, neuroticism and openness significantly affected different pedestrian behavior dimensions, while global perceived stress also significantly and positively predicted positive behavior. Moreover, the effect of neuroticism on positive behavior was fully mediated by stress. Some explanations and implications are provided in the discussion section."
https://openalex.org/W2774283911,"The Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly), Ceratitis capitata, is a notorious insect pest causing huge economic losses worldwide. The sterile insect technique (SIT) is widely used for its control. Using sexually mature sterilized males of the Vienna 8 (tsl) strain in the laboratory, we explored whether exposure of males to citrus compounds (separately or in a mixture) affects their sexual behaviour and if nutritional conditions and age modulate those effects. Exposed males exhibited increased sexual signalling compared to unexposed ones, particularly when fed a rich adult diet. Interestingly, and for the first time reported in medfly, exposure of Vienna 8 males to a mixture of citrus compounds increases longevity under poor adult diet conditions. We discuss the possible associated mechanisms and provide some practical implications of our results towards improving the effectiveness of SIT."
https://openalex.org/W2774452015,"The high incidence of vulvo-vaginal candidiasis, combined with the growing problems about azole resistance and toxicity of antifungal drugs, highlights the need for the development of new effective strategies for the treatment of this condition. In this context, natural compounds represent promising alternatives. The cyanobacterium Spirulina platensis, a blue-green alga, exhibits antimicrobial activities against several microorganisms. Nevertheless, only few data about the antifungal properties of Spirulina platensis are available and its potential toxic effects have not been largely investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of a fully-characterized water extract of Spirulina platensis against 22 strains of Candida spp. Prior to considering its potential topical use, we both investigated whether the extract exerted target activities on guinea pig uterine smooth muscle, and the impact of Spirulina platensis on the dominant microorganisms of the vaginal microbiota (i.e., lactobacilli), in order to exclude possible adverse events. By means of a broth microdilution assay, we found that the microalga extract possesses good antifungal properties (MIC: 0.125–0.5 mg/ml), against all the Candida species with a fungicidal activity. At the concentrations active against candida, Spirulina platensis did not modify the spontaneous basic waves pattern of uterine myometrium as underlined by the absence of aberrant contractions, and did not affect the main health-promoting bacteria of the vaginal ecosystem. Finally, we evaluated the selectivity index of our extract by testing its cytotoxicity on three different cell lines and it showed values ranging between 2 and 16. Further in vivo studies are needed, in particular to evaluate the use of control-release formulations in order to maintain Spirulina platensis concentrations at anti-Candida active doses but below the toxic levels found in the present work."
https://openalex.org/W2772465064,"Rice has been cultivating and utilizing by humans for thousands of years under diverse environmental conditions. Therefore, tremendous genetic differentiation and diversity has occurred at various agro-ecosystems. The significant indica–japonica differentiation in rice provides great opportunities for its genetic improvement. In the present investigation, a total of 42 polymorphic InDel markers were used for differentiating 188 rice landraces and two local varieties of Chhattisgarh, India into indica and japonica related genotypes based on ‘InDel molecular index’. Frequency of japonica alleles varied from 0.11 to 0.89 among landraces. Results revealed that 104 rice landraces have indica type genetic architecture along with three tested indica cultivars Swarna, Mahamaya and Rajeshwari. Another 60 landraces were placed under ‘close to indica’ type. It was found that three rice landraces i.e. Kalajeera, Kapri, Tulsimala were ‘close to japonica’ type and 21 landraces were ‘intermediate’ type. The result from the calculation of ‘InDel molecular index’ was further verified with STRUCTURE, AMOVA, PCA and cluster analysis. Population structure analysis revealed two genetically distinct populations within the 190 rice landraces/genotypes. Based on AMOVA, ‘intermediate’ type, ‘close to japonica’ type and Dongjinbyeo (a japonica cultivar from Republic of Korea) displayed significant genetic differentiation (ɸPT = 0.642, P = 0.000) from ‘indica’ and ‘close to indica’ groups. The PCA scatter plot and dendrogram demonstrated a clear pattern of two major group differentiations. ‘Close to japonica’ type and ‘intermediate’ type landraces/genotypes were grouped with Dongjinbyeo and formed a separate cluster at 30% Jaccard’s similarity level from rest of the landraces/genotypes which were ‘close to indica’ or ‘indica’ type. Such a significant genetic differentiation among the locally adapted landraces could be exploited for the development of rice varieties introgressing higher yield potential and better plant types of japonica type as per the need of consumers and rice traders."
https://openalex.org/W2774824561,"Complement is an important part of innate immunity. The alternative pathway of complement is activated when the main opsonin, C3b coats non-protected surfaces leading to opsonisation, phagocytosis and cell lysis. The alternative pathway is tightly controlled to prevent autoactivation towards host cells. The main regulator of the alternative pathway is factor H (FH), a soluble glycoprotein that terminates complement activation in multiple ways. FH recognizes host cell surfaces via domains 19–20 (FH19-20). All microbes including Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis, must evade complement activation to allow the infectious agent to survive in its host. One major mechanism that Borrelia uses is to recruit FH from host. Several outer surface proteins (Osp) have been described to bind FH via the C-terminus, and OspE is one of them. Here we report the structure of the tripartite complex formed by OspE, FH19-20 and C3dg at 3.18 Å, showing that OspE and C3dg can bind simultaneously to FH19-20. This verifies that FH19-20 interacts via the “common microbial binding site” on domain 20 with OspE and simultaneously and independently via domain 19 with C3dg. The spatial organization of the tripartite complex explains how OspE on the bacterial surface binds FH19-20, leaving FH fully available to protect the bacteria against complement. Additionally, formation of tripartite complex between FH, microbial protein and C3dg might enable enhanced protection, particularly on those regions on the bacteria where previous complement activation led to deposition of C3d. This might be especially important for slow-growing bacteria that cause chronic disease like Borrelia burgdorferi."
https://openalex.org/W2771797033,"The current NRC selenium (Se) requirement for turkeys is 0.2 μg Se/g diet. We previously fed turkey poults a Se-deficient diet (0.005 μg Se/g) supplemented with 10 graded levels of Se (0, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0 μg Se/g as Na2SeO3, 5/treatment) for 4 wk, and found that the minimum dietary Se requirement was 0.3 μg Se/g based on selenoprotein enzyme activity in blood, liver, gizzard and pancreas. Because the turkey is primarily a production animal, we expanded this analysis to kidney, heart, breast and thigh. Se concentrations in Se-deficient poults were 5.0, 9.8, 33, and 15% of levels in poults fed 0.4 μg Se/g in liver, kidney, thigh and breast, respectively. Increasing Se supplementation resulted in hyperbolic response curves for all tissues; breakpoint analysis indicated minimum Se requirements of 0.34–0.36 μg Se/g based on tissue Se levels in liver, kidney and thigh. Similarly, GPX1 activity in muscle tissues and kidney responded hyperbolically to increasing dietary Se, reaching well-defined plateaus with breakpoints at 0.30–0.36 μg Se/g. Minimum Se requirements based on GPX4 activity were 0.30–0.32 μg Se/g for breast and thigh. Selenoprotein transcript expression decreased significantly in Se deficiency for only 2, 3, 5, and 6 mRNA in breast, thigh, heart, and kidney, respectively, out of 24 known avian selenoproteins. Se response curves for regulated selenoprotein transcripts were hyperbolic, and reached well-defined plateaus with breakpoints in a narrow range of 0.08–0.19 μg Se/g. No selenoprotein transcript was altered by supernutritional Se. In summary, these results clearly indicate that the NRC dietary Se requirement should be raised to 0.4 μg Se/g, at least for poults, to meet the nutritional needs of the young turkey. The Se response curve plateaus further show that limits for turkey supplementation with selenite could safely be raised to 0.5 μg Se/g diet."
https://openalex.org/W2771952097,"Conventional storage of blood-derived fractions relies on cold. However, lately, ambient temperature preservation has been evaluated by several independent institutions that see economic and logistic advantages in getting rid of the cold chain. Here we validated a novel procedure for ambient temperature preservation of DNA in white blood cell and buffy coat lysates based on the confinement of the desiccated biospecimens under anoxic and anhydrous atmosphere in original hermetic minicapsules. For this validation we stored encapsulated samples either at ambient temperature or at several elevated temperatures to accelerate aging. We found that DNA extracted from stored samples was of good quality with a yield of extraction as expected. Degradation rates were estimated from the average fragment size of denatured DNA run on agarose gels and from qPCR reactions. At ambient temperature, these rates were too low to be measured but the degradation rate dependence on temperature followed Arrhenius' law, making it possible to extrapolate degradation rates at 25°C. According to these values, the DNA stored in the encapsulated blood products would remain larger than 20 kb after one century at ambient temperature. At last, qPCR experiments demonstrated the compatibility of extracted DNA with routine DNA downstream analyses. Altogether, these results showed that this novel storage method provides an adequate environment for ambient temperature long term storage of high molecular weight DNA in dehydrated lysates of white blood cells and buffy coats."

The average NAS (Nursing Activities Score) value was 54.87. The average ratio between the number of nursing care hours provided to the patient and the number of nursing care hours required by the patient (hours ratio) was 0.87. Analysis of the correlation between nursing care indicators and the hours ratio showed that the indicators phlebitis and ventilator-associated pneumonia significantly correlated with hours ratio; that is, the higher the hours ratio, the lower the incidence of phlebitis and ventilator-associated pneumonia.The number of nursing care hours directly impacts patient outcomes, which makes adjustment of nurse staffing levels essential."
https://openalex.org/W2771062525,"Background and purpose Cerebral ischemia leads to a rapid decrease of the apparent diffusion coefficient. For fractional anisotropy both increase and decrease have been reported in acute ischemic stroke. Aim of this study was to characterize early water diffusion changes in a homogenous group of acute stroke patients and to clarify the issue of early fractional anisotropy changes and their relation to time from symptom onset. Methods MRI data of patients with acute ischemic stroke examined by diffusion tensor imaging within 8h after symptom were analyzed. We calculated fractional anisotropy, eigenvalues and the isotropic and anisotropic components of the diffusion tensor. The values were calculated as ratios between the ischemic lesion and a mirror region in the unaffected side and correlated with clinical parameters. Results We included 63 patients: 49% female, mean age 69 ± 14 years, median NIHSS on admission 9 (IQR 4–14). For the whole sample, mean fractional anisotropy was increased (ratio: 1.083 ± 0.168), while all other diffusion parameters were decreased. Both the isotropic and anisotropic component of the diffusion tensor were decreased with a more pronounced decrease of the isotropic component (ratios: isotropic = 0.730 ± 0.106, anisotropic = 0.788 ± 0.127; p<0.001). There was no correlation of fractional anisotropy with time from symptom onset. Looking at individual patients, fractional anisotropy was increased in 70%. There were no differences in clinical characteristics between patients with increased and decreased fractional anisotropy. Conclusion Fractional anisotropy increase in acute stroke results from a more pronounced decrease of the isotropic diffusion component and is not related to time from symptom onset. Thus, fractional anisotropy is not helpful as a surrogate marker of lesion age in the very first hours of stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2772934411,"Since 2011, specialty hospitals in South Korea have been known for providing high- quality care in specific clinical areas. Much research related to specialty hospitals and their performance in many such areas has been performed, but investigations about their performance in obstetrics and gynecology are lacking. Thus, we aimed to compare specialty vs. non-specialty hospitals with respect to mode of obstetric delivery, especially the costs and length of stay related to Cesarean section (CS) procedures, and to provide evidence to policy-makers for evaluating the success of hospitals that specialize in obstetric and gynecological (OBGYN) care.We obtained National Health Insurance claim data from 2012 to 2014, which included information from 418,141 OBGYN cases at 214 hospitals. We used a generalized estimating equation model to identify a potential association between the likelihood of CS at specialty hospitals compared with other hospitals. We also evaluated medical costs and length of stay in specialty hospitals according to type of delivery.We found that 150,256 (35.9%) total deliveries were performed by CS. The odds ratio of CS was significantly lower in specialty hospitals (OR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.93-0.96compared to other hospitals Medical costs (0.74%) and length of stay (1%) in CS cases increased in specialty hospitals, although length of stay following vaginal delivery was lower (0.57%) in specialty hospitals compared with other hospitals.We determined that specialty hospitals are significantly associated with a lower likelihood of CS delivery and shorter length of stay after vaginal delivery. Although they are also associated with higher costs for delivery, the increased cost could be due to the high level of intensive care provided, which leads to improve quality of care. Policy-makers should consider incentive programs to maintain performance of specialty hospitals and promote efficiency that could reduce medical costs accrued by patients."
https://openalex.org/W2774991177,"Disturbed flow can eliminate the alignment of endothelial cells in the direction of laminar flow, and significantly impacts on atherosclerosis in collateral arteries near the bifurcation and high curvature regions. While shear stress induced Rac polarity has been shown to play crucial roles in cell polarity and migration, little is known about the spatiotemporal map of Rac under disturbed flow, and the mechanism of flow-induced cell polarity still needs to be elucidated. In this paper, disturbed flow or laminar flow with 15 dyn/cm2 of average shear stress was applied on bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) for 30 minutes. A genetically-encoded PAK-PBD-GFP reporter was transfected into BAECs to visualize the real-time activation of Rac in living cell under fluorescence microscope. The imaging of the fluorescence intensity was analyzed by Matlab and the normalized data was converted into 3D spatiotemporal map. Then the changes of data upon chemical interference were fitted with logistic curve to explore the rule and mechanism of Rac polarity under laminar or disturbed flow. A polarized Rac activation was observed at the downstream edge along the laminar flow, which was enhanced by benzol alcohol-enhanced membrane fluidity but inhibited by nocodazole-disrupted microtubules or cholesterol-inhibited membrane fluidity, while no obvious polarized Rac activation could be found upon disturbed flow application. It is concluded that disturbed flow inhibits the flow-induced Rac polarized activation, which is related to the interaction of cell membrane and cytoskeleton, especially the microtubules."
https://openalex.org/W2772162757,"Oryza officinalis Wall ex Watt, a very important and special wild rice species, shows abundant genetic diversity and disease resistance features, especially high resistance to bacterial blight. The molecular mechanisms of bacterial blight resistance in O. officinalis have not yet been elucidated. The WRKY transcription factor family is one of the largest gene families involved in plant growth, development and stress response. However, little is known about the numbers, structure, molecular phylogenetics, and expression of the WRKY genes under Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) stress in O. officinalis due to lacking of O. officinalis genome. Therefore, based on the RNA-sequencing data of O. officinalis, we performed a comprehensive study of WRKY genes in O. officinalis and identified 89 OoWRKY genes. Then 89 OoWRKY genes were classified into three groups based on the WRKY domains and zinc finger motifs. Phylogenetic analysis strongly supported that the evolution of OoWRKY genes were consistent with previous studies of WRKYs, and subgroup IIc OoWRKY genes were the original ancestors of some group II and group III OoWRKYs. Among the 89 OoWRKY genes, eight OoWRKYs displayed significantly different expression (>2-fold, p<0.01) in the O. officinalis transcriptome under Xoo strains PXO99 and C5 stress 48 h, suggesting these genes might play important role in PXO99 and C5 stress responses in O. officinalis. QRT-PCR analysis and confirmation of eight OoWRKYs expression patterns revealed that they responded strongly to PXO99 and C5 stress 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h, and the trends of these genes displaying marked changes were consistent with the 48 h RNA-sequencing data, demonstrated these genes played important roles in response to biotic stress and might even involved in the bacterial blight resistance. Tissue expression profiles of eight OoWRKY genes revealed that they were highly expressed in root, stem, leaf, and flower, especially in leaf (except OoWRKY71), suggesting these genes might be also important for plant growth and organ development. In this study, we analyzed the WRKY family of transcription factors in O.officinalis. Insight was gained into the classification, evolution, and function of the OoWRKY genes, revealing the putative roles of eight significantly different expression OoWRKYs in Xoo strains PXO99 and C5 stress responses in O.officinalis. This study provided a better understanding of the evolution and functions of O. officinalis WRKY genes, and suggested that manipulating eight significantly different expression OoWRKYs would enhance resistance to bacterial blight."
https://openalex.org/W2773711867,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in premature infants; yet its pathogenesis remains poorly understood. To evaluate the role of intestinal bacteria in protection against NEC, we assessed the ability of naturally occurring intestinal colonizer E. coli EC25 to influence composition of intestinal microbiota and NEC pathology in the neonatal rat model. Experimental NEC was induced in neonatal rats by formula feeding/hypoxia, and graded histologically. Bacterial populations were characterized by plating on blood agar, scoring colony classes, and identifying each class by sequencing 16S rDNA. Binding of bacteria to, and induction of apoptosis in IEC-6 enterocytes were examined by plating on blood agar and fluorescent staining for fragmented DNA. E. coli EC 25, which was originally isolated from healthy rats, efficiently colonized the intestine and protected from NEC following introduction to newborn rats with formula at 106 or 108 cfu. Protection did not depend significantly on EC25 inoculum size or load in the intestine, but positively correlated with the fraction of EC25 in the microbiome. Introduction of EC25 did not prevent colonization with other bacteria and did not significantly alter bacterial diversity. EC25 neither induced cultured enterocyte apoptosis, nor protected from apoptosis induced by an enteropathogenic strain of Cronobacter muytjensii. Our results show that E. coli EC25 is a commensal strain that efficiently colonizes the neonatal intestine and protects from NEC."
https://openalex.org/W2774658404,"Background and aims Understanding the consequences of polyploidization is a major step towards assessing the importance of this mode of speciation. Most previous studies comparing different cytotypes, however, did so only within a single environment and considered only one group of traits. To take a step further, we need to explore multiple environments and a wide range of traits. The aim of this study was to assess response of diploid and autotetraploid individuals of Knautia arvensis (Dipsacaceae) to two stress conditions, shade or drought. Methods We studied eleven photosynthetic, morphological and fitness parameters of the plants over three years in a common garden under ambient conditions and two types of stress. Key results The results indicate strong differences in performance and physiology between cytotypes in ambient conditions. Interestingly, higher fitness in diploids contrasted with more efficient photosynthesis in tetraploids in ambient conditions. However, stress, especially drought, strongly reduced fitness and disrupted function of the photosystems in both cytotypes reducing the between cytotype differences. The results indicate that drought stress reduced function of the photosynthetic processes in both cytotypes but particularly in tetraploids, while fitness reduction was stronger in diploids. Conclusions The photosynthesis related traits show higher plasticity in polyploids as theoretically expected, while the fitness related traits show higher plasticity in diploids especially in response to drought. This suggests that between cytotype comparisons need to consider multiple traits and multiple environments to understand the breath of possible responses of different cytotypes to stress. They also show that integrating results based on different traits is not straightforward and call for better mechanistic understanding of the relationships between species photosynthetic activity and fitness. Still, considering multiple environments and multiple species traits is crucial for understanding the drivers of niche differentiation between cytotypes in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2774685838,"This work proposes a model considering fairness in the problem of crew scheduling for bus drivers (CSP-BD) using a hybrid ant-colony optimization (HACO) algorithm to solve it. The main contributions of this work are the following: (a) a valid approach for cases with a special cost structure and constraints considering the fairness of working time and idle time; (b) an improved algorithm incorporating Gamma heuristic function and selecting rules. The relationships of each cost are examined with ten bus lines collected from the Beijing Public Transport Holdings (Group) Co., Ltd., one of the largest bus transit companies in the world. It shows that unfair cost is indirectly related to common cost, fixed cost and extra cost and also the unfair cost approaches to common and fixed cost when its coefficient is twice of common cost coefficient. Furthermore, the longest time for the tested bus line with 1108 pieces, 74 blocks is less than 30 minutes. The results indicate that the HACO-based algorithm can be a feasible and efficient optimization technique for CSP-BD, especially with large scale problems."

The purpose of this work is to identify and evaluate the potential regulatory mechanism of LPS-induced inflammation associated with miR-6835 and lipid rafts in HUVECs.The 3' UTR luciferase activity of AdipoR1 was detected, which was predicted the potential target gene of miR-6835. Moreover, the treated HUVECs with or without inhibitors or mimics of miR-6835 were used. Furthermore, the bio-functions of HUVECs were explored. The protein expression levels of SIRT-1, AMPK, and AdipoR1 were assessed, which were involved in the AdipoR1 signaling pathway. Then, the interaction between TLR-4 and AdipoR1 in lipid rafts and its mediation role on LPS-induced inflammation was investigated in HUVECs.MiR-6835 targeted directly on AdipoR1, and suppressed its expression in mRNA (mimics of miR-6835: 0.731±0.016 vs control: 1.527±0.015, P<0.001) and proteins levels, then regulated protein expression of SIRT-1 and AMPK, which were the downstream target genes of AdipoR1 signaling pathway. MiR-6835 enhanced LPS-induced inflammation process in HUVECs (TNF-α: LPS+mimics of miR-6835: 1638.51±78.43 vs LPS: 918.73±39.73, P<0.001; IL-6: LPS+mimics of miR-6835: 1249.35±69.51 vs LPS: 687.52±43.64, P<0.001), which was associated with the interaction between TLR-4 and AdipoR1 in lipid rafts.MiR-6835 is the key regulator of LPS-induced inflammation process in HUVECs. The interaction between TLR-4 and AdipoR1 mediated by lipid rafts at membrane of HUVECs with inflammation process induced by miR-6835. Our results demonstrated a hopeful strategy for treatment on sepsis by aiming at lipid rafts and miR-6835."
https://openalex.org/W2774273194,"Adjuvants are indispensable for achieving a sufficient immune response from vaccinations. From a functional viewpoint, adjuvants are classified into two categories: ""physical adjuvants"" increase the efficacy of antigen presentation by antigen-presenting cells (APC) and ""signal adjuvants"" induce the maturation of APC. Our previous study has demonstrated that a physical adjuvant can be encrypted into proteinous antigens by creating artificial proteins from combinatorial assemblages of epitope peptides and those peptide sequences having propensities to form certain protein structures (motif programming). However, the artificial antigens still require a signal adjuvant to maturate the APC; for example, co-administration of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) was required to induce an in vivo immunoreaction. In this study, we further modified the previous artificial antigens by appending the peptide motifs, which have been reported to have agonistic activity for TLR4, to create ""adjuvant-free"" antigens. The created antigens with triple TLR4 agonistic motifs in their C-terminus have activated NF-κB signaling pathways through TLR4. These proteins also induced the production of the inflammatory cytokine TNF-α, and the expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD40 in APC, supporting the maturation of APC in vitro. Unexpectedly, these signal adjuvant-encrypted proteins have lost their ability to be physical adjuvants because they did not induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in vivo, while the parental proteins induced CTL. These results confirmed that the manifestation of a motif's function is context-dependent and simple addition does not always work for motif-programing. Further optimization of the molecular context of the TLR4 agonistic motifs in antigens should be required to create adjuvant-free antigens."
https://openalex.org/W2773588592,"This paper proposes an optimization model, using Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP), to support decisions related to making investments in the design of power grids serving industrial clients that experience interruptions to their energy supply due to disruptive events. In this approach, by considering the probabilities of the occurrence of a set of such disruptive events, the model is used to minimize the overall expected cost by determining an optimal strategy involving pre- and post-event actions. The pre-event actions, which are considered during the design phase, evaluate the resilience capacity (absorption, adaptation and restoration) and are tailored to the context of industrial clients dependent on a power grid. Four cases are analysed to explore the results of different probabilities of the occurrence of disruptions. Moreover, two scenarios, in which the probability of occurrence is lowest but the consequences are most serious, are selected to illustrate the model’s applicability. The results indicate that investments in pre-event actions, if implemented, can enhance the resilience of power grids serving industrial clients because the impacts of disruptions either are experienced only for a short time period or are completely avoided."
https://openalex.org/W2774415286,"Preoperative planning for total hip arthroplasty includes templating on anteroposterior radiographs. It is necessary to consider radiographic magnification in order to scale templates accurately. Studies dealing with hip templating report different values of radiographic magnification. It is not clear if the observed difference in magnification between the studies is caused by variability in studied groups, methodology or instrumentation. We hypothesize that there is a difference in magnification between clinical workplaces. Within this study, radiographic magnification was estimated on 337 radiographs of patients after total hip surgery from five orthopaedic departments in the Czech Republic. Magnification was determined for each patient as a ratio between diameter of implanted femoral head measured on radiogram and its true size. One-way ANOVA revealed significant differences in magnification between workplaces (F(4,332) = 132, p≤0.001). These results suggest that radiographic magnification depends on the workplace where it is taken or more precisely on radiographic device. It indicates potential limits in generalizability of results of studies dealing with preoperative planning accuracy to other institutions."
https://openalex.org/W2775799453,"We investigated whether long-lived weight-reduced αMUPA mice differ from their wild types in postnatal body composition and leptin level, and whether these differences are affected by maternal-borne factors. Newborn αMUPA and wild type mice had similar body weight and composition up to the third postnatal week, after which αMUPA mice maintained lower body weight due to lower fat-free mass. Both strains showed a surge in leptin levels at the second postnatal week, initiating earlier in αMUPA mice, rising higher and lasting longer than in the wild types, mainly in females. Leptin level in dams' serum and breast milk, and in their pup's stomach content were also higher in αMUPA than in the WT during the surge peak. Leptin surge preceded the strain divergence in body weight, and was associated with an age-dependent decrease in the leptin:fat mass ratio-suggesting that postnatal sex and strain differences in leptin ontogeny are strongly influenced by processes independent of fat mass, such as production and secretion, and possibly outside fat tissues. Dam removal elevated corticosterone level in female pups from both strains similarly, yet mitigated the leptin surge only in αMUPA-eliminating the strain differences in leptin levels. Overall, our results indicate that αMUPA's postnatal leptin surge is more pronounced than in the wild type, more sensitive to maternal deprivation, less related to pup's total adiposity, and is associated with a lower post-weaning fat-free mass. These strain-related postnatal differences may be related to αMUPA's higher milk-borne leptin levels. Thus, our results support the use of αMUPA mice in future studies aimed to explore the relationship between maternal (i.e. milk-borne) factors, postnatal leptin levels, and post-weaning body composition and energy homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2773625929,"Tissue reconstruction in vitro can provide, if successful, a refined and simple system to analyze the underlying mechanisms that drive the morphogenesis and maintain the ordered structure. We have recently succeeded in reconstruction of seminiferous cord-like and tubule-like structures using 3-D re-aggregate culture of dissociated testicular cells. In testis formation, endothelial cells that migrated from mesonephroi to embryonic gonads have been shown to be critical for development of testis cords, but how endothelial cells contribute to testis cord formation remains unknown. To decipher the roles of endothelial and peritubular cells in the reconstruction of cord-like and tubule-like structures, we investigated the behavior of CD34+ endothelial and p75+ cells, and peritubular myoid cells (PTMCs) in 3-D re-aggregate cultures of testicular cells. The results showed that these 3 types of cells had the capacity of re-aggregation on their own and with each other, and of segregation into 3 layers in a re-aggregate, which were very similar to interstitial and peritubular tissues in vivo. Observation of behaviors of fluorescent Sertoli cells and other non-fluorescent types of cells using testes from Sox9-EGFP transgenic mice showed dynamic cell movement and segregation in re-aggregate cultures. Cultures of testicular cells deprived of interstitial and peritubular cells resulted in dysmorphic structures, but re-addition of them restored tubule-like structures. Purified CD34+ cells in culture differentiated into p75+ cells and PTMCs. These results indicate that CD34+ cells differentiate into p75+ cells, which then differentiate into PTMCs. TGFβ signaling inhibitors, SB431542 and ALK5i, disturbed the reconstruction of cord-like and tubule-like structures, and the latter compromised re-construction of interstitial-like and peritubular-like structures, as well as the proliferation of CD34+, p75+, PTMCs, and Sertoli cells, and their movement and differentiation. These results indicate that CD34+ cells and signaling through ALK5 play pivotal roles in the morphogenesis of interstitial-like, peritubular-like and cord-like structures."
https://openalex.org/W2773782011,"Background Cardiosphere derived cells (CDCs) represent a valuable source in stem cell based therapy for cardiovascular diseases, yet poor differentiation rate hinders the transplantation efficiency. The aim of this study is to check the ability of 5-Azacytidine (Aza) alone and in combination with ascorbic acid (Aza+AA) in delineating CDCs to cardiomyogenesis and the underlying Wnt signaling mechanism in induced differentiation. Methods CDCs were treated with Aza and Aza+AA for a period of 14 days to examine the expression of cardiac specific markers and Wnt downstream regulators by immunofluorescence, real time PCR and western blot. Results Results revealed that Aza+AA induced efficient commitment of CDCs to cardiomyogenic lineage. Immunofluorescence analysis showed significant augment for Nkx 2.5, GATA 4 and α-Sarcomeric actinin markers in Aza+AA group than control group (p = 0.0118, p = 0.009 and p = 0.0091, respectively). Relative upregulation of cardiac markers, Nkx 2.5 (p = 0.0156), GATA 4 (p = 0.0087) and down regulation of Wnt markers, β-catenin (p = 0.0107) and Cyclin D1 (p = 0. 0116) in Aza+AA group was revealed by RNA expression analysis. Moreover, the Aza+AA induced prominent expression of GATA 4, α-Sarcomeric actinin and phospho β-catenin while non phospho β-catenin and Cyclin D1 expression was significantly suppressed as displayed in protein expression analysis. Generation of spontaneous beating in Aza+AA treated CDCs further reinforced that Aza+AA accelerates the cardiomyogenic potential of CDCs. Conclusion Combined treatment of Aza along with AA implicit in inducing cardiomyogenic potential of CDCs and is associated with down regulating Wnt signaling pathway. Altogether, CDCs represent a valuable tool for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2772470547,"Traditionally, species of the genus Zinaida were assigned to the genus Polytremis, until molecular evidence revealed that the former is a distinct genus. Nine species in Polytremis sensu Evans have since been removed and assigned to Zinaida; however, there is still uncertainty as to the taxonomic status of an additional seven Polytremis species. Moreover, the interspecific relationships within Zinaida have remained unresolved. To further investigate the taxonomic statuses and interspecific relationships within Zinaida, a molecular phylogeny of most species of Zinaida and its allies was inferred based on regions of the mitochondrial COI-COII and 16S and nuclear EF-1α genes (3006 bp). The results revealed that Zinaida is monophyletic and consists of four intra-generic clades that correspond to morphological characteristics. Clade A (Z. suprema group) consists of P. kiraizana, Z. suprema, and P. gigantea, with the latter two as sister species. Clade B (Z. nascens group) consists of seven species, and is the sister group of Clade C (Z. pellucida group), which comprises sister species Z. pellucida and Z. zina. In Clade B, Z. caerulescens and Z. gotama, and Z. theca and Z. fukia are sister species, respectively. On the basis of our molecular evidence and morphological features, we have moved P. gigantea, P. kiraizana, P. jigongi, and P. micropunctata to the genus Zinaida as new combinations. We review morphological characteristics and discuss the distribution of each of these groups in the light of our phylogenetic hypothesis, and provide a comprehensive taxonomic checklist."
https://openalex.org/W2772589590,"In France, indications for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention are based on individual-level risk factors for HIV infection. However, the risk of HIV infection may also depend on characteristics of sexual partnerships. Here we study how place-based selection of partners change transmission and the overall efficiency of PrEP.We used the PREVAGAY survey of sexual behavior and HIV serostatus in men who have sex with men (MSM) in a Parisian district to look for associations between sexual network characteristics and HIV infection. We then simulated HIV transmission in a high-risk MSM population. We used information about venues visited to meet casual sexual partners (clubs, backrooms or saunas) to define sexual networks. We then simulated HIV transmission in these networks and assessed the impact of PrEP in this population.In the PREVAGAY study, we found that HIV serostatus changed with the type of venues visited, in addition to other individual risk factors. In simulations, we found similar differences in HIV incidence when the choice of venues visited was not random. The use of PrEP allowed reducing incidence, irrespective of the venues visited by PrEP users. However, with the same amount of PrEP, the number of infections adverted could almost double depending on network structure and venues visited by PrEP users.This study shows that characteristics of the sexual network structure can strongly impact the effectiveness of PrEP interventions. These should be considered further to refine individual risk assessment and maximize the effect of individual-based prevention policies."
https://openalex.org/W2772090078,"Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Translocator (ARNT) and its partners hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF)-1α and HIF-2α are candidate factors for the well-known link between the liver, metabolic dysfunction and elevation in circulating lipids and glucose. Methods: Hepatocyte-specific ARNT-null (LARNT), HIF-1α-null (LHIF1α) and HIF-2α-null (LHIF2α) mice were created.LARNT mice had increased fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, increased glucose production, raised post-prandial serum triglycerides (TG) and markedly lower hepatic ATP versus littermate controls. There was increased expression of G6Pase, Chrebp, Fas and Scd-1 mRNAs in LARNT animals. Surprisingly, LHIF1α and LHIF2α mice exhibited no alterations in any metabolic parameter assessed.These results provide convincing evidence that reduced hepatic ARNT can contribute to inappropriate hepatic glucose production and post-prandial dyslipidaemia. Hepatic ARNT may be a novel therapeutic target for improving post-prandial hypertriglyceridemia and glucose homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2775004945,"Background Prostate cancer (PC) stratification needs new prognostic tools to reduce overtreatment. Phosphatase of regenerating liver (PRL-3) is a phosphatase found at high levels in several cancer types, where its expression is associated with survival. A recent PC cell line study has shown it to be involved in PC growth and migration. Methods We used a monoclonal antibody to evaluate the expression of PRL-3 in PC tissue of patients in an unselected cohort of 535 prostatectomy patients. We analyzed associations between PRL-3 expression and biochemical failure-free survival (BFFS), clinical failure-free survival (CFFS) and PC death-free survival (PCDFS). Results Cytoplasmic PRL-3 staining in tumor cells was significantly correlated to expression of molecules in the VEGFR-axis, but not to the clinicopathological variables. High PRL-3 was not significantly associated with survival in the univariate analysis for BFFS (p = 0.131), but significantly associated with CFFS (p = 0.044) and PCDFS (p = 0.041). In multivariate analysis for the various end points, PRL-3 came out as an independent and significant indicator of poor survival for BFFS (HR = 1.53, CI95% 1.10–2.13, p = 0.012), CFFS (HR = 2.41, CI95% 1.17–4.98, p = 0.017) and PCDFS (HR = 3.99, CI95% 1.21–13.1, p = 0.023). Conclusions PRL-3 is independently associated with all PC endpoints in this study. Since high PRL-3 expression also correlates with poor prognosis in other cancers and functional studies in PC support these findings, PRL-3 emerges as a potential treatment target in PC."
https://openalex.org/W2775671212,"In a modern small gasoline engine fuel injection system, the load of the engine is estimated based on the measurement of the manifold absolute pressure (MAP) sensor, which took place in the intake manifold. This paper present a more economical approach on estimating the MAP by using only the measurements of the throttle position and engine speed, resulting in lower implementation cost. The estimation was done via two-stage multilayer feed-forward neural network by combining Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm, Bayesian Regularization (BR) algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Based on the results found in 20 runs, the second variant of the hybrid algorithm yields a better network performance than the first variant of hybrid algorithm, LM, LM with BR and PSO by estimating the MAP closely to the simulated MAP values. By using a valid experimental training data, the estimator network that trained with the second variant of the hybrid algorithm showed the best performance among other algorithms when used in an actual retrofit fuel injection system (RFIS). The performance of the estimator was also validated in steady-state and transient condition by showing a closer MAP estimation to the actual value."
https://openalex.org/W2773035224,"Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon regulating mono-allelic expression of genes depending on their parental origin. Defective genomic imprinting is involved in several placental disorders, such as intrauterine growth restriction and pre-eclampsia. Uniparental embryos, having maternal-only or paternal-only genomes (parthenogenotes [PAR] and androgenotes [AND], respectively), are useful models to study placentation. The aim of this work was to reveal the effect of parental genome (maternal and paternal) on placentation. To do this, uniparental (AND and PAR) and biparental (CTR) in vitro produced sheep embryos transferred to recipient females were collected at day 20 of pregnancy and their placentae were analyzed. qPCR analysis showed that imprinted genes (H19, IGF2R and DLK1) were expressed accordingly to their parental origin while the expression f DNA methyltransferases () was disregulated, especially in PAR (P < 0.05). AND placentae were significantly hypomethylated compared to both PAR and CTR (P = 0.023). Chorion-allantoid of AND showed impaired development of vessels and reduced mRNA expression of vasculogenetic factors (ANG2 P = 0.05; VEGFR2 P< 0.001; TIE2 P < 0.001). Morphologically, PAR placentae were characterized by abnormal structure of the trophoectodermal epithelium and reduced total number (P<0.03) of Trophoblastic Binucleate Cells. A reduced implantation rate of both classes of uniparental embryos (P<0.03) was also noted. Our results provide new insights into the characterization of uniparental embryos and demonstrate the complementary role of parental genomes for the correct establishment of pregnancy. Thus, our findings may suggest new targets to improve our understanding of the origin of imprinting-related placental dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2773107122,"Myocardial infarction sometimes appears misspelt as myocardial infraction in the cardiovascular research literature. With accurate citation of literature contributions important to advancing the field and its contributors, in this study we aimed to document the frequency and explore the causes and impact of this error specific to the cardiology literature. Literature databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, WIPO, Google Scholar, Google) were searched to identify the rate of myocardial infraction errors and found an error rate between 0.2% and 1.6%, with substantial differences between search tools used. A Scopus search was used to show changes in errors over time, differences between journals and by specific authors. Myocardial infraction occurred at increasing annual rates over time and at higher rates than other errors. Increasing error rates were associated with increased volume of searchable material rather than quality of the literature. Transcription from article to database is a common source of error and some databases have higher rates of these errors. Simple measures to avoid and to correct these errors in the literature and the databases are also discussed."
