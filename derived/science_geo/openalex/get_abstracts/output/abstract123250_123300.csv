https://openalex.org/W2032712201,"A cellular disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) is a new family of genes with structural homology to the snake venom metalloproteinases and disintegrins. We screened genes which were selectively expressed in the cachexigenic colon 26 adenocarcinoma subline in vivo. It was found that one novel cDNA clone, identified as a cachexigenic tumor selective gene, encodes a cysteine-rich protein which shows a sequence similarity to that of both the snake venom metalloproteinases and thrombospondins. We named this cDNA clone A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombo spondin motifs (ADAMTS-1). ADAMTS1 consists of six domains, 1) a pro- and 2) a metalloproteinase, 3) a disintegrin-like, 4) a thrombospondin (TSP) homologous domain containing TSP type I motif, 5) a spacer region, and 6) COOH-terminal TSP submotifs. Unlike other ADAMs, ADAMTS-1 does not possess a transmembrane domain and is a putative secretory protein. Therefore, ADAMTS-1 is a new type of ADAM family protein with TSP type I motifs. We demonstrated that the TSP homologous domain containing the TSP type I motif of ADAMTS-1 is functional for binding to heparin. ADAMTS-1 mRNA could be induced by stimulating colon 26 cells with an inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1, in vitro. Moreover, intravenous administration of lipopolysaccharide in mice selectively induced ADAMTS-1 mRNA in kidney and heart. These data suggest that ADAM-TS-1 may be a gene whose expression is associated with various inflammatory processes as well as development of cancer cachexia.

Shannon J.D. Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6203-6211Google Scholar) and disintegrin (2Wolfsberg T.G. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. White J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 275-278Google Scholar). Snake venom disintegrins are a family of anticoagulant peptides with a high cysteine content (3Niewiarowski S. McLane M.A. Kloezewiak M. Stewart G.J. Semin. Hematol. 1994; 31: 289-300Google Scholar). At this moment, 11-13 ADAM genes, including fertilin, epididymal apical protein I, cyritestin, MDC, meltrin, MS2, and metargidin, have been identified (4Blobel C.P. Wolfsberg T.G. Turck C.W.

Typical ADAMs are cell surface proteins which consist of pro-, metalloprotease-like, disintegrin-like, cysteine-rich, epidermal growth factor-like, transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Fertilin, the first ADAM described, has been implicated in integrin-mediated sperm-egg binding (4Blobel C.P. Wolfsberg T.G. Turck C.W. Myles D.G. Primakoff P. White J.M. Nature. 1992; 356: 248-252Google Scholar). Similarly, meltrin has been shown to be required for myotube formation (8Yagami-Hiromasa T. Sato T. Kurisaki T. Kamijo K. Nabeshima Y. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Nature. 1995; 377: 652-656Google Scholar). Therefore, this family is thought to function in cell-cell interaction. On the other hand, of the other members of the ADAM family, MDC is a candidate for tumor suppressor in human breast cancer and MS2 is a macrophage surface antigen (7Emi M. Katagiri T. Harada Y. Saito H. Inazawa J. Ito I. Kasumi F. Nakamura Y. Nature Genet. 1993; 5: 151-157Google Scholar, 9Yoshida S. Setoguchi M. Higuchi Y. Akizuki S. Yamamoto S. Int. Immunol. 1990; 2: 585-591Google Scholar). However, the physiological role of these ADAMs has not been established yet.Cachexia is frequently associated with cancer as well as bacterial, viral, and protozoan diseases (11Spiegelman B.M. Hotamisligil G.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 625-627Google Scholar). Cancer cachexia is a complexed pathological state characterized by progressive weight loss, anorexia, asthenia, anemia, and altered metabolic blood parameters, e.g. hypertriglyceridemia and hypoglycemia (12Norton J.A.J. Peacock J.L. Morrison S.D. CRC Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1987; 7: 289-327Google Scholar, 13Langstein H.N. Norton J.A. Hematol. Oncol. Clin. North Am. 1991; 5: 103-123Google Scholar, 14Tisdale M.J. Br. J. Cancer. 1991; 63: 337-342Google Scholar). Weight loss results from catabolism of host body compartments, particularly muscle and adipose tissue. In addition to several mediators including toxohormone-L (15Masuno H. Yamazaki N. Okuda H. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 284-288Google Scholar) and proteolytic factor (16Beck S.A. Tisdale M.J. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 5919-5923Google Scholar), lipid mobilizing factor (17Todorov P. Cariuk P. McDevitt T. Coles B. Fearon K. Tisdale M. Nature. 1996; 392: 739-742Google Scholar), leukemia inhibitory factor (18Matthy P. Dijkmans Proost P. Van Damme J. Heremans H. Sobis H. Billiau A. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 9: 77-82Google Scholar), and interferon-γ (19Mori M. Yamaguchi K. Honda S. Nagasaki K. Ueda M. Abe O. Abe K. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6656-6659Google Scholar), the involvement of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (20Beutler B. Greenwald D. Hulmes J.D. Chang M. Pan U-C.E. Mathison J. Ulevitch R. Cerami A. Nature. 1985; 316: 552-554Google Scholar, 21Oliff A. Defeo-Jones D. Boyer M. Martinez D. Kiefer D. Vuocolo G. Wolfe A. Socher S.H.

Lundholm K. Clin. Physiol. 1987; 7: 263-274Google Scholar), and IL-6 (25Strassmann G. Fong M. Kenney J.S. Jacob C.O. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1681-1684Google Scholar, 26Yasumoto K. Mukaida N. Harada A. Kuno K. Akiyama M. Nakashima E. Fujioka N. Mai M. Kasahara T. Fujimoto-Ouchi K. Mori K. Tanaka Y. Matsushima K. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 921-927Google Scholar, 27Yoneda T. Nakai M. Moriyama K. Scott L. Ida N. Kunitomo T. Mundy G.R. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 737-740Google Scholar) has been suggested in various cancer cachexia models. In the mouse colon 26 adenocarcinoma model, the involvement of IL-6 in the induction of cachexia has been suggested (25Strassmann G. Fong M. Kenney J.S. Jacob C.O. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1681-1684Google Scholar, 26Yasumoto K. Mukaida N. Harada A. Kuno K. Akiyama M. Nakashima E. Fujioka N. Mai M. Kasahara T. Fujimoto-Ouchi K. Mori K. Tanaka Y. Matsushima K. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 921-927Google Scholar). Concomitant with the elevation of the serum IL-6 level, an increase in serum acute phase proteins was observed, suggesting that systemic inflammation occurs in mice bearing colon 26 cachexigenic tumor (26Yasumoto K. Mukaida N. Harada A. Kuno K. Akiyama M. Nakashima E. Fujioka N. Mai M. Kasahara T. Fujimoto-Ouchi K. Mori K. Tanaka Y. Matsushima K. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 921-927Google Scholar).In this study, to elucidate the complexed pathological state during development of cancer cachexia, we have searched for genes which were selectively expressed on colon 26 cachexigenic sublines under in vivo tumor bearing states by means of differential display methods (28Liang P. Averboukh L. Pardee A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3269-3275Google Scholar). The result enabled us to identify a new gene which is selectively expressed in the cachexigenic tumor line. This gene, named ADAMTS-1, encodes a novel ADAM family protein with thrombospondin (TSP) motifs. We also demonstrated that the expression of the ADAMTS-1 gene is closely associated with acute inflammation.DISCUSSIONColon 26 adenocarcinoma is a suitable model for cancer cachexia because weight loss is induced when the tumor burdens are relatively small (31Tanaka Y. Eda H. Tanaka T. Udagawa T. Ishikawa T. Horii I. Ishitsuka H. Kataoka T. Taguchi T. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 2290-2295Google Scholar). In addition to weight loss, colon 26 was found to cause hypoglycemia and disorders of hepatic functions (31Tanaka Y. Eda H. Tanaka T. Udagawa T. Ishikawa T. Horii I. Ishitsuka H. Kataoka T. Taguchi T. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 2290-2295Google Scholar). IL-6 has been proposed as a mediator of cancer cachexia in this model (25Strassmann G. Fong M. Kenney J.S. Jacob C.O. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1681-1684Google Scholar, 26Yasumoto K. Mukaida N. Harada A. Kuno K. Akiyama M. Nakashima E. Fujioka N. Mai M. Kasahara T. Fujimoto-Ouchi K. Mori K. Tanaka Y. Matsushima K. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 921-927Google Scholar), but IL-6 alone is not sufficient to induce cachexia (25Strassmann G. Fong M. Kenney J.S. Jacob C.O. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1681-1684Google Scholar, 26Yasumoto K. Mukaida N. Harada A. Kuno K. Akiyama M. Nakashima E. Fujioka N. Mai M. Kasahara T. Fujimoto-Ouchi K. Mori K. Tanaka Y. Matsushima K. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 921-927Google Scholar). Therefore, the precise mechanism required to induce cancer cachexia in the colon 26 model has not been elucidated. Fujimoto-Ouchi et al. (32Fujimoto-Ouchi K. Tamura S. Mori K. Tanaka Y. Ishitsuka H. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 61: 522-528Google Scholar) isolated cachexigenic (clone 20) and noncachexigenic (clone 5) clones of colon 26. These sublines of colon 26 carcinoma are a useful tool for identification of genes which are up-regulated during development of cancer cachexia because the basal expression levels of a number of unrelated genes are presumed to be similar for each subline. In this study, we identified ADAMTS-1 as a cachexigenic tumor selective gene, which shows a sequence similarity to that of snake venom metalloproteinase and belongs to the ADAM family.The precursor form of snake venom metalloproteinase, such as Ht-a, consists of four domains, pro-region, metalloproteinase, disintegrin, and cysteine-rich domain (1Hite L.A. Shannon J.D. Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6203-6211Google Scholar, 36Hite L.A. Jia L.-G. Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 182-191Google Scholar) (Fig. 9). Until now, 11 to 13 mammalian genes have been identified as members of this family, named ADAMs (1Hite L.A. Shannon J.D. Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6203-6211Google Scholar). The membrane-type ADAMs, such as fertilin, MS2, and meltrin, include the epidermal growth factor-like transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains in those COOH-terminal regions (Fig. 9). A non-membrane type gene, the MDC gene, contains the cysteine-rich domain following disintegrin domain (Fig. 9). In contrast, ADAMTS-1 does not include either an epidermal growth factor-like or transmembrane domain. Instead of these domains, the ADAMTS-1 protein has TSP type I motifs and a spacer region in its COOH-terminal half-region. Therefore, the ADAMTS-1 protein is a new type of ADAM family protein containing the TSP type I motifs.It has been suggested that the catalytic site of the snake venom metalloproteinase is masked with the cysteine residue in the pro-region and that the proteinase is activated by autolysis in a similar manner to matrix metalloproteinase, “cysteine switch mechanism,” resulting in the removal of pro-domain (1Hite L.A. Shannon J.D. Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6203-6211Google Scholar, 36Hite L.A. Jia L.-G. Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 182-191Google Scholar, 40Grams F. Huber R. Kress L.F. Moroder L. Bode W. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 76-80Google Scholar). In addition, it was reported that the precursor form of the venom metalloproteinase is post-translationally processed to remove the disintegrin domain (36Hite L.A. Jia L.-G. Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 182-191Google Scholar). Similarly, fertilin (PH30), which is suggested to be involved in sperm-egg fusion (41Almeida E.A. Houvila A.-P. Sutherland A.E. Stephens L.E. Calarco P.G. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. Sonnenberg A. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. White J.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1095-1104Google Scholar), undergoes processing during sperm maturation (42Blobel C.P. Myles D.G. Primakoff P. White J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 69-78Google Scholar), resulting in the removal of proteinase domain. On the other hand, the ADAMTS-1 protein has a zinc-binding motif in metalloproteinase domain. Hence, it is possible that the pro-region and proteinase domain of ADAMTS-1 may be processed by appropriate stimulation in vivo, resulting in the exposure of a disintegrin-like domain and TSP type I motifs.The TSP type I motif has been identified as a conserved repeated element between thrombospondin 1 and 2, which are known as multifunctional secretory glycoproteins to support blood coagulation, to regulate proliferation, adhesion, and migration of a number of normal and tumor cells (43Bornstein P. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3290-3299Google Scholar, 44Frazier W.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 792-799Google Scholar) and to be a physiological inhibitor of angiogenesis (45Rastinejad F. Polverini P.J. Bouck N.P. Cell. 1989; 56: 345-355Google Scholar). The biological activities of thrombospondins are attributed to their binding to cell surfaces and many matrix macromolecules, including heparan sulfate, proteoglycans, fibronectin, laminin, and collagen (43Bornstein P. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3290-3299Google Scholar, 44Frazier W.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 792-799Google Scholar). Thrombospondins are composed of multiple discrete domains including a TSP type I motif, to mediate binding to various ligands. The TSP type I motif of thrombospondin 1 and 2 has been thought to be involved in binding to matrix molecules. In particular, the CS-(A/V)-TCG element within the TSP type I motif is an important determinant in binding to cells (39Prater C.A. Plotkin J. Jaye D. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1031-1040Google Scholar, 46Tuszynski G.P. Rothman V.L. Deutch A.H. Hamilton B.K. Eyal J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 209-217Google Scholar). In addition, the W-(S/G)-X-W motif found in the NH2-terminal of TSP type I motif, was shown to promote the adhesion of melanoma cells through heparan sulfate (38Guo N.H. Krutzsch H.C. Negre E. Vogel T. Blake D.A. Roberts D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3040-3044Google Scholar). Both elements are conserved in the type I motif of ADAMTS-1. Here, we demonstrated that the TSP homologous domain of ADAMTS-1 containing TSP type I motif possess binding capacity to heparin. Since ADAMTS-1 is a putative secretory protein, it is possible that ADAMTS-1 may be incorporated into the extracellular matrix through interacting with sulfated glycoconjugates such as heparin and heparan sulfate.Disintegrin is a family of anti-coagulant peptides found in snake venoms, which are characterized by a high cysteine content (3Niewiarowski S. McLane M.A. Kloezewiak M. Stewart G.J. Semin. Hematol. 1994; 31: 289-300Google Scholar). Disintegrin functions as an integrin ligand and has the ability to disrupt cell-matrix interaction (47Gould R.J. Polokoff M.A. Friedman P.A. Huang T.-F. Holt J.C. Cook J.J. Niewiarowski S. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1990; 195: 168-171Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Recently, the disintegrin domain of fertilin expressed on sperm was shown to be involved in binding to the egg, through interaction with integrin (41Almeida E.A. Houvila A.-P. Sutherland A.E. Stephens L.E. Calarco P.G. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. Sonnenberg A. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. White J.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1095-1104Google Scholar). Sequence similarity between ADAMTS-1 and hemorrhagic toxin, Ht-e, extends to the disintegrin domain and seven cysteine residues are conserved in ADAMTS-1 (Fig. 2). However, the homology of ADAMTS-1 to Ht-e in the disintegrin domain is relatively low (21% identity) compared with those of other members of this family proteins, such as fertilin and MS2 (30-39% identity to Ht-e). We prepared disintegrin-like domain of ADAMTS-1 as GST fusion protein and checked the inhibitory activity against platelet aggregation. However, we found that the GST disintegrin-like domain of ADAMTS-1 (at 300 nM) had no effect on platelet aggregation which was induced by ADP. The function of disintegrin-like domains of ADAMTS-1 remains to be elucidated.Our present study has identified the ADAMTS-1 gene as being selectively expressed in the cachexigenic tumor in vivo. Strassmann (25Strassmann G. Fong M. Kenney J.S. Jacob C.O. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1681-1684Google Scholar) proposed that IL-1, produced by infiltrated macrophages, potentiates IL-6 production by colon 26 tumor cells in vivo. Previously, we demonstrated the selective expression of the IL-6 gene in clone 20 tumor, but not in clone 5 tumor in vivo which was dependent upon the balance between IL-1 and IL-1 receptor antagonist (26Yasumoto K. Mukaida N. Harada A. Kuno K. Akiyama M. Nakashima E. Fujioka N. Mai M. Kasahara T. Fujimoto-Ouchi K. Mori K. Tanaka Y. Matsushima K. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 921-927Google Scholar). In fact, we have shown here that the ADAMTS-1 mRNA was enhanced by in vitro IL-1 stimulation, suggesting that selective expression of ADAMTS-1 in the cachexigenic clone 20 tumor may be due to the action of IL-1. In addition, we found that transcripts of a certain class of VL30 elements were strongly expressed in the cachexigenic clone 20 tumor in vivo, but not in the non-cachexigenic clone 5 tumor, 2K. Kuno, N. Kanada, E. Nakashima, F. Fujiki, F. Ichimura, and K. Matsushima, unpublished results. indicating that the signaling pathway leading to the activation of the long terminal repeat of a certain class of VL30 is selectively activated in the cachexigenic tumor in vivo and may contribute to the induction of multiple genes during development of cancer cachexia.Involvement of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor, IL-1, and IL-6 has been demonstrated in various cancer cachexia model (21Oliff A. Defeo-Jones D. Boyer M. Martinez D. Kiefer D. Vuocolo G. Wolfe A. Socher S.H. Cell. 1987; 50: 555-563Google Scholar, 22Tracey K.J. Wei H. Manogue K.R. Fong Y. Hesse D.G. Nguyen H.T. Kuo G.C.

Invest. 1992; 89: 1681-1684Google Scholar, 26Yasumoto K. Mukaida N. Harada A. Kuno K. Akiyama M. Nakashima E. Fujioka N. Mai M. Kasahara T. Fujimoto-Ouchi K. Mori K. Tanaka Y. Matsushima K.

Concomitant with the elevation of serum IL-6 level, haptogloblin in the serum is significantly increased in clone 20 tumor-bearing mice (26Yasumoto K. Mukaida N. Harada A. Kuno K. Akiyama M. Nakashima E. Fujioka N. Mai M. Kasahara T. Fujimoto-Ouchi K. Mori K. Tanaka Y. Matsushima K. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 921-927Google Scholar), suggesting that systemic inflammation occurs during induction of cancer cachexia. Interestingly, we found that ADAMTS-1 mRNA was markedly induced in heart and kidney by in vivo LPS administration. These results indicate that ADAMTS-1 gene expression is up-regulated by inflammatory mediators such as IL-1 during inflammation.Further investigation is required to establish the role of the ADAMTS-1 gene product during inflammation and cancer cachexia. Of the other ADAM family proteins, MS2 is selectively expressed on monocytic lineage and has been shown to be up-regulated by LPS (9Yoshida S. Setoguchi M. Higuchi Y. Akizuki S. Yamamoto S. Int. Immunol. 1990; 2: 585-591Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that some ADAMs, such as ADAMTS-1 and MS2, may play a role in the inflammatory process. It has also been established that snake venom metalloproteinases degrade the proteins of basement membrane including collagen IV, nidogen, and laminin (48Shannon J.D. Baramova E.N. Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11575-11583Google Scholar, 49Bjarnason J.B. Hamilton D. Fox J.W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1988; 369: 121-129Google Scholar). Similar activities can be expected for some ADAM family proteins, including ADAMTS-1, during inflammation. On the other hand, ADAMTS-1 is a unique member of this family because it possesses the TSP homologous domain containing TSP type I motifs. It is therefore presumed that ADAMTS-1, by mediating cell adhesion, may play a role in cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis.

Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 275-278Google Scholar). Snake venom disintegrins are a family of anticoagulant peptides with a high cysteine content (3Niewiarowski S. McLane M.A. Kloezewiak M. Stewart G.J. Semin. Hematol. 1994; 31: 289-300Google Scholar).

Typical ADAMs are cell surface proteins which consist of pro-, metalloprotease-like, disintegrin-like, cysteine-rich, epidermal growth factor-like, transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Fertilin, the first ADAM described, has been implicated in integrin-mediated sperm-egg binding (4Blobel C.P. Wolfsberg T.G. Turck C.W. Myles D.G. Primakoff P. White J.M. Nature. 1992; 356: 248-252Google Scholar). Similarly, meltrin has been shown to be required for myotube formation (8Yagami-Hiromasa T. Sato T. Kurisaki T. Kamijo K. Nabeshima Y. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Nature. 1995; 377: 652-656Google Scholar). Therefore, this family is thought to function in cell-cell interaction. On the other hand, of the other members of the ADAM family, MDC is a candidate for tumor suppressor in human breast cancer and MS2 is a macrophage surface antigen (7Emi M. Katagiri T. Harada Y. Saito H. Inazawa J. Ito I. Kasumi F. Nakamura Y. Nature Genet. 1993; 5: 151-157Google Scholar, 9Yoshida S. Setoguchi M. Higuchi Y. Akizuki S. Yamamoto S. Int. Immunol. 1990; 2: 585-591Google Scholar). However, the physiological role of these ADAMs has not been established yet.Cachexia is frequently associated with cancer as well as bacterial, viral, and protozoan diseases (11Spiegelman B.M. Hotamisligil G.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 625-627Google Scholar). Cancer cachexia is a complexed pathological state characterized by progressive weight loss, anorexia, asthenia, anemia, and altered metabolic blood parameters, e.g. hypertriglyceridemia and hypoglycemia (12Norton J.A.J.

In the mouse colon 26 adenocarcinoma model, the involvement of IL-6 in the induction of cachexia has been suggested (25Strassmann G. Fong M. Kenney J.S. Jacob C.O. J. Clin.

Concomitant with the elevation of the serum IL-6 level, an increase in serum acute phase proteins was observed, suggesting that systemic inflammation occurs in mice bearing colon 26 cachexigenic tumor (26Yasumoto K.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 921-927Google Scholar).In this study, to elucidate the complexed pathological state during development of cancer cachexia, we have searched for genes which were selectively expressed on colon 26 cachexigenic sublines under in vivo tumor bearing states by means of differential display methods (28Liang P. Averboukh L. Pardee A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3269-3275Google Scholar). The result enabled us to identify a new gene which is selectively expressed in the cachexigenic tumor line. This gene, named ADAMTS-1, encodes a novel ADAM family protein with thrombospondin (TSP) motifs. We also demonstrated that the expression of the ADAMTS-1 gene is closely associated with acute inflammation.

Their human gene promoters share the 11-base pair M box containing a CATGTG motif, which was shown here to be bound in vitro by microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). Transient cotransfection analysis showed that MITF overexpression increased the expression of a reporter gene under the control of the human tyrosinase or TRP-1 gene promoter but not the TRP-2 promoter. The promoter activation caused by MITF is dependent on each CATGTG motif of the distal enhancer element, the M box, and the initiator E box of the tyrosinase gene and the TRP-1 M box. Furthermore, a truncated MITF lacking the carboxyl-terminal 125 amino acid residues transactivated the tyrosinase promoter less efficiently than did MITF, suggesting that MITF's carboxyl terminus contains a transcriptional activation domain, but unexpectedly such a truncated MITF remarkably transactivated the TRP-2 gene promoter.

The intracellular pathways leading to activation of NHE1 are poorly understood. To gain more insight into these activation pathways, we examined the role of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) as potential mediators of NHE1 activation by extracellular stimuli such as growth factors and hyperosmotic stress.Whereas p44 MAPK does not appear to phosphorylate NHE1 in vitro, we found that inhibition of the p42/p44 MAPK signaling by expression of a dominant negative form of p44 MAPK, by expression of the MAP kinase phosphatase MKP-1, or by inhibition of MAPK kinase 1 (MKK1) with the PD 98059 compound reduced by 50-60% NHE1 activation in response to growth factors. This inhibitory effect also was observed in C-terminal NHE1 deletion mutants in which the major phosphorylation sites have been deleted. Furthermore, the use of a CCL39-derived cell line expressing an estradiol-regulated form of oncogenic Raf-1 (CCL39-ΔRaf-1:ER) revealed that the exclusive activation of the Raf → MKK1 → p42/p44 MAPK cascade was capable of inducing NHE1 activation to the same extent as potent growth factors like thrombin.Together, our findings demonstrate that the p42/p44 MAPK cascade plays a predominant role in the regulation of NHE1 by growth factors, an action that is mediated via accessory proteins that remain to be identified.

Cell. 1989; 56: 271-280Google Scholar), is ubiquitously expressed and appears to be the predominant species in nonepithelial cells, where it has been shown to play a major role in intracellular pH homeostasis and cell volume regulation. NHE1 activity can be modulated by a remarkably wide variety of stimuli including growth factors, tumor promoters, and hormones as well as physical factors such as changes in cell volume or cell spreading (reviewed in 2Noël J. Pouysségur J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C283-C296Google Scholar). On the basis of its hydropathy profile, NHE1 exhibits two distinct domains: a largely hydrophobic NH2-terminal region of 500 residues proposed to span the membrane 10-12 times, followed by a hydrophilic C-terminal domain of more than 300 residues. Structure-function relationship studies have demonstrated that the N-terminal transmembrane part of NHE1 is necessary and sufficient to catalyze the amiloride-sensitive ion exchange, whereas the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain is crucial for mediating the activation of NHE1 by growth factors, hormones, and osmotic stress (3Wakabayashi S.

Extracellular stimuli have been shown to activate NHE1 by increasing its sensitivity to intracellular H+ (4Aronson P.S. Nee J. Suhm M.A. Nature. 1982; 299: 161-163Google Scholar, 5Moolenaar W.H.

A. 1985; 82: 1429-1433Google Scholar), resulting in cytoplasmic alkalinization; the mechanism underlying this shift in pHi sensitivity is not yet fully elucidated. NHE1 is constitutively phosphorylated in unstimulated cells, and mitogenic stimulation is accompanied by an increase in phosphorylation of NHE1 on serine residues, with a time course similar to the rise in intracellular pH (8Sardet C. Counillon L. Franchi A. Pouysségur J. Science. 1990; 247: 723-726Google Scholar). Moreover, okadaic acid, a serine/threonine protein phosphatase inhibitor can by itself trigger activation of NHE1 in correlation with stimulation of its phosphorylation (9Bianchini L. Woodside M. Sardet C. Pouysségur J. Takai A. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15406-15413Google Scholar, 10Sardet C. Fafournoux P. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19166-19171Google Scholar). Based on these results, phosphorylation of NHE1 had been hypothesized to directly trigger the activation of the antiporter. Recent evidence, however, shows that phosphorylation of NHE1 cannot fully account for its activation (11Wakabayashi S. Bertrand B. Shigekawa M. Fafournoux P. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5583-5588Google Scholar). The picture of NHE1 regulation emerging from recent studies is as follows: at least three different mechanisms appear to control NHE1 regulation: 1) the effect of (a) regulatory protein(s), potentially phosphorylated, interacting with the cytoplasmic domain of NHE1; 2) elevation of [Ca2+]i, leading to the binding of Ca2+/calmodulin complex to the high affinity calmodulin-binding domain (amino acids 636-656); and 3) direct phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of NHE1 (11Wakabayashi S. Bertrand B. Shigekawa M. Fafournoux P. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5583-5588Google Scholar, 12Wakabayashi S. Bertrand B. Ikeda T. Pouysségur J. Shigekawa M. J. Biol.

The mechanisms by which extracellular signals are propagated from the cell surface to modify membrane targets such as NHE1 have not been completely resolved. The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) have been identified as important mediators in a wide array of physiological processes: they constitute a large family of Ser/Thr protein kinases activated by separate cascades conserved through evolution (14Neiman A.M. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 390-394Google Scholar), which regulate multiple processes stimulated by extracellular agents. Transmission of the signal occurs through sequential activation of cytosolic protein kinases; eventually, these phosphorylation cascades activate nuclear and cytosolic regulatory molecules to initiate cellular responses. In mammalian cells, the first and best characterized MAPK cascade is the p42/p44 MAPK cascade (15Sturgill T.W. Wu J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1092: 350-357Google Scholar, 16Boulton T.G. Nye S.H.

Cell. 1991; 65: 663-675Google Scholar); it involves activation of p42/p44 MAPK by direct phosphorylation by the dual specificity kinases MKK1 and MKK2 (17Alessi D. Saito Y. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Sithanandam G. Rapp U. Ashworth A. Marshall C.J. Cowley S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 16009-16019Google Scholar). Raf is recruited to the membrane by Ras upon activation of either G protein-coupled receptors (19van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Luttrell D.K. Krueger K.M.

Although these cascades are initiated by stimuli that induce NHE1 activation and might therefore be involved in the signaling pathways leading to activation of the exchanger, reports establishing a direct link between MAPK cascades and regulation of ion transporters such as NHE1 are scarce (30Hooley R. Yu C-Y. Symons M. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6152-6158Google Scholar). The purpose of the present study was therefore to gain a better understanding of the activation pathways of NHE1 by investigating the putative role of the p42/p44 MAPK, p38 MAPK, and JNK cascades in the regulation of NHE1 by growth factors and osmotic stress. We report that in the Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cell line CCL39 the Raf → MKK1 → p42/p44 MAPK cascade plays an important role in activation of NHE1 by growth factors, whereas neither p42/p44 and p38 MAPK nor JNK appeared to be involved in NHE1 activation by osmotic stress.

The parental Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cell line CCL39, the Na+/H+ antiporter-deficient cell line PS120, and the corresponding transfectants were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (H21 catalog number 52100; Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 25 mM NaHCO3. The CCL39-ΔRaf-1:ER clone derived from the CCL39 cell line was maintained in H21 medium without phenol red and supplemented with glutamine and glucose to reach the concentrations of normal H21 (H21 without phenol red; catalog number 11880). Both culture media were supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). Cells were maintained at 37°C in the presence of 5% CO2. The CCL39-ΔRaf-1:ER clonal cell line was obtained by transfection of CCL39 cells with the plasmid pLNCΔRaf-1:ER (32Samuels M.L. Weber M.J.

A series of stable transfectants was obtained by expression of different constructs of human NHE1 cDNA in PS120 cells. These included the full-length cDNA deleted from the 5′-untranslated region (pEAP− construct), and C-terminal truncations at positions 698 and 635 (constructs Δ698 and Δ635, respectively) (3Wakabayashi S. Fafournoux P. Sardet C. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2424-2428Google Scholar). pEAP− plasmid was NH2-terminally-tagged with a Myc epitope (NHE1-Myc) by Dr. J. Noël; the Myc epitope was subcloned in the N terminus of Δ698 (Δ698-Myc) and Δ635 (Δ635-Myc). pEAP− was also NH2-terminally-tagged with a double VSVG epitope (NHE1-VSVG) by Dr. R. C. Poole. The plasmids p44 MAPK and p44 MAPK-T192A are derived from the hamster cDNA of p44 MAPK as described previously (27Pagès G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.-C. Méloche S. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8319-8323Google Scholar). The human cDNA of the phosphatase MKP-1 kindly provided by Dr. S. Keyse (35Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-647Google Scholar) was subcloned in the expression vector pcDNAneo (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) by J.-M. Brondello. The plasmid p38 MAPK is derived from murine cDNA of p38 MAPK (36Brunet A. Pouysségur J. Science. 1996; 272: 1652-1655Google Scholar) and was kindly provided by Dr. R. J. Ulevitch; the plasmid JNK was kindly provided by Dr. R. J. Davis. For stable transfections, PS120 cells were transfected with each plasmid construct by using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation technique. The transfected cells were selected after three consecutive tests of pHi recovery after cytoplasmic acidification as described previously (3Wakabayashi S. Fafournoux P. Sardet C. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2424-2428Google Scholar). For transient expression, a H+-killing selection was also used. PS120 cells (3 × 106/10-cm plate) were cotransfected by the calcium phosphate technique with 7 μg of pEAP− expression vector encoding the Na+/H+ antiporter (1Sardet C. Franchi A. Pouysségur J. Cell. 1989; 56: 271-280Google Scholar, 3Wakabayashi S. Fafournoux P. Sardet C. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2424-2428Google Scholar) and 43 μg of the relevant construct. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were subjected to an acid load selection that killed nontransfected cells, usually >90% of the cell population (1Sardet C. Franchi A. Pouysségur J. Cell. 1989; 56: 271-280Google Scholar, 3Wakabayashi S. Fafournoux P. Sardet C. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2424-2428Google Scholar). pHi determination experiments were done the next day in surviving cells. Changes in the intracellular pH were estimated from the distribution of [7-14C]benzoic acid (37L'Allemain G. Paris S. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5809-5815Google Scholar) as described previously (38Bianchini L. Kapus A. Lukacs G. Wasan S. Wakabayashi S. Pouysségur J. Yu F.H. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C998-C1007Google Scholar). The cells expressing wild type or mutant exchangers were grown to confluence in 10-cm dishes and labeled for 5 h at 37°C in phosphate-free, serum-free medium containing [32P]orthophosphate (100-300 μCi/ml). The cells were then stimulated in the same medium with 10% FCS for 15 min. Immunoprecipitation of NHE1 was carried out as described previously (11Wakabayashi S. Bertrand B. Shigekawa M. Fafournoux P. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5583-5588Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation with the monoclonal 9E10 antibody, a suspension of protein G-Sepharose beads was used instead of protein A-Sepharose beads. Immunoprecipitated proteins were solubilized by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. Phosphoproteins were visualized by autoradiography. Cells were serum-deprived overnight or for 5 h and stimulated with various agonists. Kinase assays were performed as described previously (40Méloche S. Pagès G. Pouysségur J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 63-71Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer. Equal amounts of proteins from cell lysates were immunoprecipitated on protein A-Sepharose beads coupled with the 12CA5 anti-HA antibody. Activity of the kinases was assayed in 40 μl of kinase buffer with various substrates: glutathione S-transferase-ATF2-(1-109) for HA-p38MAPK and HA-JNK; MBP for HA-p44MAPK; and 50 μM, 1-3 μCi [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at 30°C. For the immune complex kinase assays using immunoprecipitated NHE1 as substrate, after washing with the Triton X-100 lysis buffer, the beads coming from HA-p44MAPK and pEAP− or NHE1-VSVG immune complex were mixed and then washed with kinase buffer. HA-p44 MAPK activity was assayed by incubating the mixture of beads in 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μM, 1-3 μCi [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 30°C. The reactions were stopped by Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were heated at 95°C for 5 min, protein was separated by SDS-PAGE, and phosphoproteins were detected by autoradiography. Western blotting analysis of NHE1 was performed as described previously (3Wakabayashi S. Fafournoux P. Sardet C. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2424-2428Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Autoradiograms are representative of three separate experiments. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments performed in quadruplicate. The cytoplasmic domain of NHE1, which has been determined by mutagenesis studies to be crucial for activation by growth factors (3Wakabayashi S. Fafournoux P. Sardet C. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2424-2428Google Scholar), has also been found to contain both the basal and stimulus-induced phosphorylation sites (11Wakabayashi S. Bertrand B. Shigekawa M. Fafournoux P. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5583-5588Google Scholar). To clarify the contribution of direct phosphorylation of NHE1 in the response to growth factors, we expressed in PS120 cells (a Na+/H+ exchanger-deficient derivative of the CCL39 cell line (34Pouysségur J. Sardet C. Franchi A. L'Allemain G. Paris S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4833-4837Google Scholar)) wild type and C-terminally truncated forms of the human NHE1. The behavior of these truncated mutants has been previously characterized as follows (38Bianchini L. Kapus A. Lukacs G. Wasan S. Wakabayashi S. Pouysségur J. Yu F.H. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C998-C1007Google Scholar): deletion of 117 amino acids (698-815) of the cytosolic tail was found to largely preserve the cytoplasmic alkalinization induced by the potent mitogenic combination of α-thrombin and insulin (ΔpHi = 0.15 ± 0.01, n = 10, for the Δ698 cells compared with ΔpHi = 0.22 ± 0.03, n = 9, for the pEAP− cells). A larger deletion of the cytosolic tail of 180 amino acids (635-815) still preserved the alkalinization induced by α-thrombin and insulin, although the extent of the pHi increase was reduced by 50% by the deletion (ΔpHi = 0.10 ± 0.02; n = 6). We investigated the phosphorylation status of these NHE1 truncation mutants both in quiescent cells and upon stimulation with growth factors. The specific anti-NHE1 polyclonal antibody RP-c28 raised against a β-galactosidase fusion protein containing the last C-terminal 157 amino acids of the human NHE1 (658-815) (8Sardet C. Counillon L. Franchi A. Pouysségur J. Science. 1990; 247: 723-726Google Scholar), was found to recognize only the wild type exchanger pEAP− and not the Δ698 and Δ635 deletions (38Bianchini L. Kapus A. Lukacs G. Wasan S. Wakabayashi S. Pouysségur J. Yu F.H. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C998-C1007Google Scholar). To allow immunoprecipitation of the NHE1 deletions, a Myc epitope tag recognized by the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 was introduced at the N terminus of these cytoplasmic truncated forms of NHE1 (see “Experimental Procedures”). PS120 cells were stably transfected with cDNAs encoding the Myc-tagged full-length (NHE1-Myc) or truncated versions of NHE1 (Δ698-Myc and Δ635-Myc). Immunoprecipitation of NHE1-Myc, Δ698-Myc and Δ635-Myc from 32P-labeled cells is shown in Fig. 1. In NHE1-Myc quiescent cells (lane 1), the RP-c28 antibody recognized a protein running as a diffuse 32P-labeled band at a molecular mass of about 110 kDa as reported for NHE1 (8Sardet C. Counillon L. Franchi A. Pouysségur J. Science. 1990; 247: 723-726Google Scholar); the anti-Myc 9E10 antibody was found to recognize the same protein (data not shown). As described previously for NHE1 (8Sardet C. Counillon L. Franchi A. Pouysségur J. Science. 1990; 247: 723-726Google Scholar), phosphorylation of NHE1-Myc was found to increase upon stimulation with FCS (lane 2). The Δ698-Myc deletion mutant was shown to run as a diffuse 32P-labeled protein at a lower molecular mass than NHE1-Myc, consistent with the molecular mass expected from the deletion of 117 amino acids (lane 3). Interestingly, the Δ698-Myc deletion mutant did not demonstrate any increase in phosphorylation upon serum stimulation but rather a decrease in total phosphorylation. No 32P-labeled protein at the expected molecular mass for the Δ635-Myc deletion could be detected when Δ635-Myc was immunoprecipitated from resting cells (lane 5) or cells stimulated with 10% FCS (lane 6). These results indicate that the Δ635-Myc mutant is no longer phosphorylated, therefore allowing the mapping of NHE1 phosphorylation sites to the cytoplasmic tail (amino acids 636-815). It is noteworthy that these results confirm the mapping that had already been obtained by indirect means, by comparison of phosphopeptide maps of four NHE1 variants: the wild type NHE1, two internal deletion mutants (Δ515-566 and Δ567-635), and the expressed NHE1 cytoplasmic domain (11Wakabayashi S. Bertrand B. Shigekawa M. Fafournoux P. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5583-5588Google Scholar). The Δ698-Myc mutant was phosphorylated in unstimulated cells, allowing the localization of basal phosphorylation site(s) for NHE1 in the 635-698 domain. More importantly, no increase in the total phosphorylation of the Δ698-Myc mutant could be detected upon addition of serum, suggesting that the growth factor-sensitive phosphorylation site(s) are distal to the 698 residue. These results should however be taken with caution, since considering the total phosphorylation of the NHE1 deletion mutant could be misleading; an increase in phosphorylation in one region could be masked by a decrease in phosphorylation on a distinct site in another region. Phosphopeptide mapping would be necessary to resolve this uncertainty, but unfortunately the signals obtained from 32P-immunoprecipitates with the 9E10 antibody were too weak to allow phosphopeptide mapping for the Myc-tagged NHE1 deletions. It has been established that two classes of mitogens initiating their signals either through receptor tyrosine kinases (i.e. epidermal growth factor) or through G protein-coupled receptors and protein kinase C (i.e. thrombin) both stimulated NHE1 phosphorylation exclusively on serine residues. Moreover, the patterns of NHE1 phosphorylation in response to epidermal growth factor and thrombin were found to be identical. These findings led us to postulate that MAPKs that can integrate signals from multiple transmembrane receptors might play an important role in the cascade leading to NHE1 activation and presumably phosphorylation (10Sardet C. Fafournoux P. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19166-19171Google Scholar). As stated above, truncation of the NHE1 cytoplasmic tail from residue 635 eliminated all major sites of phosphorylation, yet the resulting truncated mutant was still activable (although to a lesser extent) by all growth factors tested (11Wakabayashi S. Bertrand B. Shigekawa M. Fafournoux P. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5583-5588Google Scholar). In contrast, deletion of the 566-635 domain abolished NHE1 activation by growth factors, raising the possibility of the existence of one or multiple regulatory protein(s) potentially interacting with the cytoplasmic domain of NHE1. This regulatory protein could itself be the target of a MAPK cascade. In this respect, it is worth noting that the Δ635 transfectant was found to still respond to the serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (data not shown; 11Wakabayashi S. Bertrand B. Shigekawa M. Fafournoux P. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5583-5588Google Scholar), suggesting that phosphorylation reactions upstream of NHE1 play a role in the exchanger activation pathway. We therefore investigated the potential involvement of the various MAPK cascades in this mechanism of activation. To this end, we first compared the effect of various stimuli on activation of these kinase cascades with their effects on NHE1 regulation in CCL39 fibroblasts. HA-p44 MAPK was immunoprecipitated from CCL39 stable transfectants submitted to various stimuli, and activation of HA-p44 MAPK was measured by the capacity to phosphorylate its preferential substrate MBP.

In this report, we show that HNF-4 contains two transactivation domains, designated AF-1 and AF-2, which activate transcription in a cell type-independent manner. AF-1 consists of the extreme N-terminal 24 amino acids and functions as a constitutive autonomous activator of transcription. This short transactivator belongs to the class of acidic activators, and it is predicted to adopt an amphipathic α-helical structure. In contrast, the AF-2 transactivator is complex, spanning the 128-366 region of HNF-4, and it cannot be further dissected without impairing activity. The 360-366 region of HNF-4 contains a motif that is highly conserved among transcriptionally active nuclear receptors, and it is essential for AF-2 activity, but it is not necessary for dimerization and DNA binding of HNF-4. Thus, HNF-4 deletion mutants lacking the 361-465 region bind efficiently to DNA as homo- and heterodimers and behave as dominant negative mutants. Remarkably, the full transactivation potential of AF-2 is inhibited by the region spanning residues 371-465 (region F).

https://openalex.org/W2094643418,"Hemolysin BL (HBL) is a unique membrane-lytic toxin from Bacillus cereus composed of three distinct proteins, designated B, L1, and L2. HBL produces a paradoxical zone phenomenon in gel diffusion assays in sheep blood agar. Lysis does not begin immediately adjacent to the source of diffusion; rather, it begins several millimeters away. Cells near the source and at intersections of lysis zones remain intact longer. Here, we developed a spectrophotometric hemolysis assay system that measures the activities of the individual HBL components and used it to analyze the mechanisms of hemolysis and the paradoxical zone phenomenon. The B component was rate-limiting, and erythrocytes were slowly primed by B at an optimal concentration of about 1.3 nM to rapid lytic action by the combination of the L components (L1+2).

Osmotic protection experiments indicate a colloid osmotic lysis mechanism. Concentrations of the B component above 1.3 nM caused inhibition of L1-mediated lysis, and L1 inhibited the priming reaction of B over a similar concentration range. From analyses of spectrophotometric and diffusion assays we constructed a basic model for the interactions between HBL components and for the paradoxical zone phenomenon in blood agar. In the latter, areas of slow lysis near diffusion sources are caused primarily by the accumulation of inhibitory levels of L1 reached before cells are primed by B. Hemolysin BL (HBL) is a unique membrane-lytic toxin from Bacillus cereus composed of three distinct proteins, designated B, L1, and L2. HBL produces a paradoxical zone phenomenon in gel diffusion assays in sheep blood agar. Lysis does not begin immediately adjacent to the source of diffusion; rather, it begins several millimeters away. Cells near the source and at intersections of lysis zones remain intact longer. Here, we developed a spectrophotometric hemolysis assay system that measures the activities of the individual HBL components and used it to analyze the mechanisms of hemolysis and the paradoxical zone phenomenon. The B component was rate-limiting, and erythrocytes were slowly primed by B at an optimal concentration of about 1.3 nM to rapid lytic action by the combination of the L components (L1+2).

These cellular processes are modulated by growth factors that are released or activated following cell injury. When endothelial cell migration is stimulated in response to monolayer wounding in vitro, cells increase synthesis of small leucine-rich dermatan sulfate proteoglycans (PGs) (Kinsella, M. G., and Wight, T. N. (1986) J. Cell Biol. 102, 679-687). However, the identity of the PGs that are increased during cell migration and the factors that affect this modulation have not been identified. We now report that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is responsible for the transient increase of [35S]sulfate incorporation into PGs following monolayer wounding. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that bFGF-treated and wounded cultures increase both biglycan core protein synthesis and biglycan proteolytic processing, which results in the accumulation of a ∼20-kDa N-terminal biglycan fragment in the culture media. Biglycan RNA steady-state levels also selectively increase 2- to 3-fold after wounding or bFGF treatment. Finally, immunocytochemical staining localizes biglycan to the tips and edges of lamellopodia on migrating cells, indicating that biglycan is found at loci at which the formation and dissolution of adhesion plaques occurs, consistent with hypotheses that predict involvement of biglycan in the control of cell migration. Taken together, these results suggest that release of endogenous bFGF is primarily responsible for altered biglycan expression, synthesis, and proteolytic processing as endothelial cells migrate after wounding.

https://openalex.org/W1981173539,"Ret is a receptor tyrosine kinase required during embryogenesis for the survival of enteric and sympathetic neuroblasts. Recently, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has been identified as a ligand for Ret. We investigated early events in GDNF-induced signal transduction. We show that GDNF activates the Ras-ERK2 signaling pathway in SK-N-MC cells stably transfected with a full-length Ret construct. In addition, activation of Ret tyrosine kinase activity, either via GDNF stimulation of full-length Ret or via epidermal growth factor stimulation of an epidermal growth factor receptor-Ret chimeric receptor, results in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation and phosphatidylinositol 3kinase-dependent formation of large lamellipodia.

Nature. 1996; 382: 80-83Google Scholar) show that Ret expression is not enough for GDNF binding, but instead GDNFR-α expression mediates GDNF binding, independent of Ret expression. Additionally, treatment of GDNF-responsive cells with phosphatidylinositide-specific phospholipase C, which results in release of GDNFR-α from the membrane, results in loss of responsiveness of Ret to GDNF. Addition of soluble forms of GDNFR-α restores this responsiveness (7Treanor J.J.S. Goodman L. De Sauvage F. Stone D.M. Poulsen K.T. Beck C.D. Gray C. Armanini M.P. Pollock R.A. Hefti F. Phillips H.S.

Apparently, several cell types express GDNFR-α endogenously in the absence of Ret expression, since Trupp et al. (8Trupp M. Arenas E. Fainzilber M. Nilsson A.-S. Sieber B.-A. Grigoriou M. Kilkenny C.

Nature. 1996; 381: 789-793Google Scholar) showed that introduction of Ret alone is sufficient to confer GDNF responsiveness to different cell types. Here we show that transfection of Ret into the human neuroepithelioma cell line SK-N-MC makes these cells responsive to GDNF. We show that GDNF induces Ret tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Ras-ERK2 pathway, which is not observed in the parental cell line. In addition, Ret induces PI3K activity, followed by PI3K-dependent formation of large lamellipodia. As lamellipodia formation is implicated in neuritogenesis, Ret signaling via PI3K may mediate neurite outgrowth as observed in GDNF-stimulated neuroblasts (6Durbec P. Marcos-Gutierrez C.V. Kilkenny C. Grigoriou M. Wartiowaara K. Suvanto P. Smith D. Ponder B. Costantini F. Saarma M. Sariola H. Pachnis V. Nature. 1996; 381: 789-793Google Scholar). The human neuroepithelioma cell line SK-N-MC and its stably transfected subclones were cultured in DF12 medium supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal calf serum. The full-length Ret-expressing cell line SKP2 was generated by stable transfection of Ret-negative SK-N-MC cells with an Rc/CMV-Ret expression plasmid (kindly provided by M. Takahashi (Nagoya University School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan); 15Takahashi M. Asai N. Iwashita T. Isomura T. Miyazaki K. Matsuyama M.

After a 10 min incubation of the cells with GDNF (Pepro Tech) or EGF (Sigma), either with or without a 10-min pretreatment with the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin (Sigma) or LY294002 (Sigma), cells were fixed for 20 min in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation with PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 45 min. Coverslips were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with FITC-coupled phalloidin (Sigma), which specifically binds to polymerized actin. After three washes in PBS, the coverslips were embedded in Immumount (Shandon) and analyzed using a Labophot fluorescence microscope (Nikon). To determine PI3K activity in the cells, serum-starved cells were either left untreated or stimulated for 5 min with 40 ng/ml EGF or 100 ng/ml GDNF. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 137 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1 μM aprotinin, 1 μM leupeptin, 1 mM orthovanadate, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated for 2 h at 4°C using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (FB2) coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads. After extensive washing, beads were taken up into kinase assay buffer (30 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 30 μM adenosine, 0.1 mg/ml phosphatidylinositol), followed by incubation for 20 min at room temperature. Subsequently, ATP and MgCl2 were added to a final concentration of 40 μM and 30 mM, respectively, followed by an additional incubation for 25 min at room temperature. The kinase reaction was stopped by addition of 2 volumes of 1 M HCl, lipids were isolated using methanol and chloroform, and separated by thin layer chromatography. Chromatograms were exposed to a PhosphorImager screen. Fold inductions of PI3K activity were calculated relative to the unstimulated situation. Recently, several groups have implicated GDNF as a ligand for the receptor tyrosine kinase Ret (6Durbec P. Marcos-Gutierrez C.V. Kilkenny C. Grigoriou M. Wartiowaara K. Suvanto P. Smith D. Ponder B.

To study early signal transduction events after GDNF-stimulated Ret tyrosine kinase activity, we used the Ret-negative neuroepithelioma cell line SK-N-MC stably transfected with a full-length Ret expression plasmid (SKP2 cell line). Stimulation of SKP2 cells with different concentrations of GDNF resulted in a concentration-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the 170-kDa plasma membrane-bound isoform of Ret (Fig. 1). Maximal Ret tyrosine phosphorylation levels were induced with GDNF concentrations between 40 and 160 ng/ml, which is identical to concentrations reported by others for stimulation of Ret (and GDNFR-α)-expressing cells (6Durbec P. Marcos-Gutierrez C.V. Kilkenny C. Grigoriou M. Wartiowaara K. Suvanto P. Smith D. Ponder B. Costantini F. Saarma M. Sariola H. Pachnis V. Nature. 1996; 381: 789-793Google Scholar, 7Treanor J.J.S.

Cell. 1996; 85: 1113-1124Google Scholar). The 150-kDa isoform of Ret, which is not present at the plasma membrane (15Takahashi M. Asai N. Iwashita T. Isomura T. Miyazaki K. Matsuyama M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2925-2929Google Scholar, 17Asai N. Iwashita T. Matsuyama M. Takahashi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1613-1619Google Scholar), is not phosphorylated in response to GDNF stimulation (Fig. 1). From these results we conclude that GDNF can induce autophosphorylation of the receptor tyrosine kinase Ret in the SKP2 cell line. GDNF has been suggested to induce activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases since it induces mesoderm formation in Ret-expressing embryonic Xenopus cells as well as increase proliferation of Ret-expressing cells (6Durbec P. Marcos-Gutierrez C.V. Kilkenny C. Grigoriou M. Wartiowaara K. Suvanto P. Smith D. Ponder B. Costantini F. Saarma M. Sariola H. Pachnis V. Nature. 1996; 381: 789-793Google Scholar, 7Treanor J.J.S.

Sariola H. Saarma M. Ibanez C.F. Nature. 1996; 381: 785-789Google Scholar). To investigate whether GDNF indeed directly activates the Ras-ERK2 signaling pathway, we analyzed GDNF signaling toward ERK2 in SKP2 cells. We first analyzed the effect of GDNF on Shc phosphorylation. As shown by Shc or phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitations followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-Shc antibodies, respectively, GDNF induces specific tyrosine phosphorylation of the 66-, 52-, and 46-kDa forms of Shc in SKP2 cells (Fig. 2A). We next analyzed the activation of Ras, by measuring the ratio of Ras bound to GDP and GTP before and after GDNF stimulation of SKP2 cells. A consistent, yet small increase in Ras bound to GTP was observed in three independent experiments (Fig. 2B). This increase was not observed in the parental SK-N-MC cells treated with GDNF. The activation of Ras after EGF stimulation of the HERRet chimeric receptor, was more pronounced, i.e. a 2-3-fold increase (Fig. 2B). Finally, we analyzed whether GDNF stimulation of SKP2 cells leads to ERK2 activation. As shown in Fig. 2C, GDNF induced a concentration-dependent ERK2 activation, as determined by a shift in mobility of the activated form of ERK2. The ERK2 mobility shift was maximal between 40 and 160 ng/ml GDNF. This correlates well with tyrosine phosphorylation of the 170-kDa isoform of Ret at these concentrations (Fig. 1). ERK2 activation after GDNF stimulation of SKP2 cells was completely inhibited by transient transfection of a dominant negative mutant of Ras (Ras-N17), showing that the small increase in Ras GTP following GDNF stimulation is sufficient for ERK2 activation (Fig. 2D). GDNF-induced activation of the Ras-ERK2 pathway is specifically mediated by the Ret tyrosine kinase, since GDNF stimulation of the parental Ret-negative SK-N-MC cells did not induce protein-tyrosine phosphorylation, Shc phosphorylation, Ras activation, or ERK2 activation (Fig. 2). GDNF has been shown to induce neurite outgrowth from nephrogenic explants of heterozygous, but not homozygous, ret knock-out mice, indicating that GDNF-activated Ret is involved in neurite outgrowth. Since the actin cytoskeleton is involved in neurite formation, we investigated the effect of Ret activation on the actin cytoskeleton of stably transfected SK-N-MC cells. This was tested both in SKP2 cells as well as in SKF5 cells, which are SK-N-MC cells stably transfected with the HERRet chimeric receptor (16van Weering D.H.J. Medema J.P. van Puijenbroek A. Burgering B.M.T. Baas P.D. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2207-2214Google Scholar). When SKF5 cells were grown in the presence of 0% or 10% serum, several actin-rich cell surface protrusions were present on the cells, as could be seen after staining of the cells with FITC-labeled phalloidin, which specifically recognizes polymerized actin (Fig. 3A). Time lapse video microscopy of living SKF5 cells revealed that these protrusions are continuously formed and retracted by the cells, and thus resemble the filopodia observed at the growth cone of an axon (18Goldberg D.J. Burmeister D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1921-1931Google Scholar, 19Bray D. Chapman K. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 3204-3213Google Scholar). Addition of EGF to activate the Ret tyrosine kinase resulted in the formation of large lamellipodia (Fig. 3B). These lamellipodia were observed within 5 min in more than 90% of the cells at the border of a cell cluster. Lamellipodia were observed for at least 30 min. Time lapse video microscopy revealed that after stimulation lamellipodia are formed by filling in the space between filopodia, which gradually decrease in length and disappear. Dose-response analysis showed that lamellipodia are already formed at 2.5 ng/ml EGF, which corresponds to the minimal concentration necessary for Ret autophosphorylation and ERK2 activation (data not shown). In a concentration-dependent manner, GDNF also induced lamellipodia formation in SKP2 cells. Using 160 ng/ml, approximately 70% of the cells at the border of a cell cluster showed lamellipodia formation (Fig. 3D). At lower concentrations fewer cells responded, with a minimum of 10 ng/ml for the induction of lamellipodia. This also correlates with the minimum concentration of GDNF required for induction of tyrosine phosphorylation on Ret (Fig. 1). Lamellipodia formation or membrane ruffling in non-neuronal cell lines is dependent on, and mediated by, PI3K activity (20Hawkins P.T. Eguinoa A. Qiu R.-G. Stokoe D. Cooke F.T. Walters R.

Additionally, neurite outgrowth in neuronal PC12 cells is dependent on PI3K activity (23Kimura K. Hattori S. Kabuyama Y. Shizawa Y. Takayanagi J. Nakamura S. Toki S. Matsuda Y. Onodera K. Fukui Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18961-18967Google Scholar). To establish the role of PI3K in Ret-induced lamellipodia formation, we first determined the effect of Ret activation on PI3K activity. As shown in Fig. 4, stimulation of SKF5 cells with EGF resulted in a clear activation of PI3K activity. In addition, GDNF stimulation of full-length Ret in SKP2 cells induced PI3K activation (Fig. 4). In the parental SK-N-MC cell line, EGF or GDNF treatment did not induce PI3K activation. These results show that Ret tyrosine kinase activation results in PI3K activity. Using two different PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, we investigated the role of PI3K in Ret-induced lamellipodia formation. Pretreatment of SKF5 or SKP2 cells with wortmannin (Fig. 5) or LY294002 (data not shown) followed by stimulation of Ret tyrosine kinase activity with EGF or GDNF, respectively, resulted in a complete inhibition of lamellipodia formation. Titration experiments showed that pretreatment with 25 nM wortmannin is sufficient to completely inhibit PI3K- and Ret-induced lamellipodia formation (data not shown). These results show that PI3K activity is essential for Ret-induced lamellipodia formation. Signal transduction toward lamellipodia formation in the SK-N-MC-derived SKF5 and SKP2 cell lines is mediated specifically by Ret, since stimulation of the parental SK-N-MC cell line with either EGF or GDNF did not induce changes in the actin cytoskeleton (Fig. 3). Recently, GDNF has been identified as a ligand for the receptor tyrosine kinase Ret. With respect to effects of GDNF on cells, only late effects, such as increased proliferation or survival and induction of differentiation, have been documented (6Durbec P. Marcos-Gutierrez C.V.

In this paper we describe early events in GDNF-induced signal transduction. GDNF-induced signaling was investigated in stable transfectants of the SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma cells line expressing full-length Ret. We show that GDNF stimulation of SKP2 cells results in a concentration-dependent induction of Ret tyrosine phosphorylation, followed by Shc phosphorylation and Ras and ERK2 activation. Although GDNF treatment of SKP2 cells only results in a small increase in Ras activity, it is clearly essential for the activation of ERK2, since expression of dominant negative Ras-N17 inhibits ERK2 activation completely. A similar situation was shown previously for platelet-derived growth factor, which also induces only a small increase in GTP-bound Ras that is, however, sufficient for ERK2 activation (26Burgering B.M.T. de Vries-Smits A.M.M. Medema R.H. van Weeren P.C. Tertoolen L.G.J. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7248-7256Google Scholar). In addition, we show that Ret tyrosine kinase activity, activated by GDNF stimulation of full-length Ret or by EGF stimulation of HERRet, induces PI3K activity. PI3K activation by receptor tyrosine kinases has now been shown for several other receptors, including the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, insulin receptor, insulin-like growth factor receptor, and hepatocyte growth factor receptor (27Kaziauskas A. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1989; 58: 1121-1133Google Scholar, 28Ruderman N.B. Kapeller R. White M.F. Cantley L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1411-1415Google Scholar, 29Kotani K. Yonezawa K.

Maina F. dalla Zonca P. Giordano S. Graziani A. Panayotou G. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 1994; 77: 261-271Google Scholar). Ret-induced activation of PI3K mediates the formation of lamellipodia in both SKP2 and SKF5 cells. It is now well established that for lamellipodia formation or membrane ruffling PI3K activity is essential. This has been shown by the use of mutant receptors that fail to bind the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K, the use of dominant negative mutants of p85, and by the use of two specific PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002 (20Hawkins P.T.

Hawkins P. Cooke F. Hara K. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Jackson T. Claesson Welsh L. Stephens L. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 385-393Google Scholar). Indeed, treatment of SKP2 or SKF5 cells with wortmannin or LY294002 completely inhibited Ret-induced lamellipodia formation, confirming the role for PI3K in this response. The responses described in this paper are specifically mediated by Ret since GDNF or EGF stimulation of the Ret-negative parental SK-N-MC cell line did not result in any of the described signaling events. The signals induced by GDNF in full-length Ret-expressing SKP2 cells are, in general, weaker than those induced by EGF stimulation of HERRet-expressing SKF5 cells. This may be due to the number of receptors expressed on the SKP2 cell surface, which is at least 10-fold lower than HERRet expression in SKF5 cells. The concentration of GDNF necessary to induce Ret-mediated responses in SKP2 cells, 10 ng/ml, is in the same order of magnitude as the concentration used by others for stimulation of cell lines or primary neurons, including those cell lines that express high levels of GDNFR-α (6Durbec P.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 137-148Google Scholar). We therefore conclude that, if GDNFR-α is essential for GDNF-induced Ret activation, SKP2 cells express sufficient GDNFR-α molecules. However, it should be noted that Mount et al. (24Mount H.T. Dean D.O. Alberch J. Dreyfus C.F. Black I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9092-9096Google Scholar) reported increased proliferation of primary Purkinje cells using GDNF concentrations as low as 1 pg/ml. Ret signal transduction has also been investigated in a fibroblast cell line stably transfected with a HERRet expression vector (34Santoro M. Wong W.T. Aroca P. Santos E. Matoskova B. Grieco M. Fusco A. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 663-675Google Scholar). In these cells, Ret tyrosine kinase activity induces Ras activation, but not ERK2 activation, which is in clear contrast to results obtained in both GDNF-stimulated SKP2 cells, as shown in this paper, and EGF-stimulated SKF5 cells (16van Weering D.H.J. Medema J.P. van Puijenbroek A. Burgering B.M.T. Baas P.D. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2207-2214Google Scholar). In addition, Santoro et al. concluded that in fibroblasts Ret activation does not induce PI3K activity. Also this signaling pathway is activated after Ret activation in SK-N-MC-derived cell lines. Clearly, Ret signaling in fibroblasts is different from Ret signaling in neuronal cells, the cell type in which Ret is normally expressed. In neuronal cells, lamellipodia formation is a critical event in neuritogenesis. Lamellipodia formation is observed at growth cones of neurites, and inhibition of lamellipodia formation with actin polymerization inhibitors or PI3K inhibitors blocks neurite outgrowth (18Goldberg D.J. Burmeister D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1921-1931Google Scholar, 19Bray D. Chapman K. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 3204-3213Google Scholar, 23Kimura K. Hattori S. Kabuyama Y. Shizawa Y. Takayanagi J.

Toroian-Raymond A. Nature. 1986; 323: 712-715Google Scholar). Lamellipodia formation has also been implicated in cellular migration (37Stossel T.P. Science. 1993; 260: 1086-1094Google Scholar). We have shown here that activation of Ret tyrosine kinase activity, either by GDNF stimulation of full-length Ret or by EGF stimulation of HERRet, results in the formation of large lamellipodia. These lamellipodia may represents early events in neurite formation. Indeed, expression of constitutively active Ret in PC12 cells induces neurite outgrowth (38Borrello M.G. Smith D.P. Pasini B. Bongarzone I. Greco A. Lorenzo M.J. Arighi E. Miranda C. Eng C. Alberti L. Bocciardi R. Mondellini P. Scopsi L. Romeo G. Ponder B.A.J. Pierotti M.A. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2419-2427Google Scholar). In addition, autonomic neuroblasts in explants from the nephrogenic region of embryonic day 11.0-11.5 mouse embryos show Ret-dependent axonal outgrowth toward beads soaked in GDNF (6Durbec P. Marcos-Gutierrez C.V. Kilkenny C. Grigoriou M. Wartiowaara K. Suvanto P. Smith D. Ponder B. Costantini F. Saarma M. Sariola H. Pachnis V. Nature. 1996; 381: 789-793Google Scholar). Alternatively, Ret-induced lamellipodia may be involved in migration of neuronal precursors. However, it has been shown that Ret expression is up-regulated only after migration of neuroblasts toward the rat fetal gut. In addition, detailed analysis of ret knock-out mice showed that Ret-negative neuroblasts do migrate into the anlage for enteric and sympathetic ganglia, despite the lack of expression of functional Ret (39Lo L. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1995; 15: 527-539Google Scholar, 40Durbec P.L. Larsson-Blomberg L.B. Schuchardt A. Costantini F. Pachnis V. Development. 1996; 122: 349-358Google Scholar). It is only after reaching the anlage that the Ret-negative neuroblasts die (40Durbec P.L. Larsson-Blomberg L.B. Schuchardt A. Costantini F. Pachnis V. Development. 1996; 122: 349-358Google Scholar). Death of these cells may be the result of the inability of the neuroblasts to form connections with target cells because of the failing neuritogenesis in the absence of functional Ret. Neuroblasts that cannot form functional contacts with target cells die because of deprivation of neurotrophic factors (for review see 41Snider W.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 627-638Google Scholar). We thank M. Takahashi for the Rc/CMV-Ret expression plasmid and Catherine Nobes for help with the time-lapse video microscopy analysis.

https://openalex.org/W2076822732,"The receptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase LAR (for leukocyte common antigen-related) has been implicated as a physiological regulator of the insulin receptor. To demonstrate a functional interaction between LAR and the insulin receptor, we incubated CHO cells overexpressing the human insulin receptor with an antibody to the extracellular domain of LAR and found a 47% decrease in insulin receptor autophosphorylation and kinase activity. A physical association between LAR and the insulin receptor was then shown by immunoprecipitation of LAR from cell lysates and immunoblotting with antibody to the insulin receptor, or vice versa. Up to 11.8% of the LAR protein in the lysates of CHO cells overexpressing both the insulin receptor and LAR co-immunoprecipitated with the insulin receptor. The LAR/insulin receptor association was related to the level of LAR or insulin receptor overexpression and was increased 6.5-fold by chemical cross-linking and 3.9-fold by treatment with insulin, suggesting that receptor activation influences the affinity of LAR for the insulin receptor. In insulin-stimulated rat liver, LAR was temporally enriched in endosomes with the insulin receptor, and incubation of endosomes with neutralizing LAR antibodies decreased insulin receptor dephosphorylation in situ by 28% (p = 0.01 versus control). These data provide more direct evidence of a role for LAR in the physiological regulation of insulin action at the receptor level."

Low stringency screening of a human kidney cDNA library and subsequent DNA sequence analysis identified two related K+ inward rectifier cDNAs, referred to as Kir1.2 and Kir1.3, which were derived from transcription of distinct human genes. Kir1.2 represents the human homolog of the rat BIRK-10 sequence, whereas Kir1.3 was unique compared with all available sequence data bases. The genes that encode Kir1.2 and Kir1.3 were mapped to human chromosomes 1 and 21, respectively. Both genes showed tissue-specific expression when analyzed by Northern blots. Kir1.2 was only detected in brain kidney and was detected at high levels in all brain regions examined. Kir1.3 was most readily detected in kidney and was also expressed in pancreas > lung. Comparative analysis of the predicted amino acid sequences for Kir1.2 and Kir1.3 revealed they were 62% identical. The most remarkable difference between the two polypeptides is that the Walker Type A consensus binding motif present in both Kir1.1 and Kir1.2 was not conserved in the Kir1.3 sequence. Expression of the Kir1.2 polypeptide in Xenopus oocytes resulted in the synthesis of a K+-selective channel that exhibited an inwardly rectifying current-voltage relationship and was inhibited by external Ba2+ and Cs+. Kir1.2 current amplitude was reduced by >85% when the pH was decreased from pH 7.4 to 5.9 using the membrane-permeant buffer acetate but was relatively unaffected when pH was similarly lowered using membrane-impermeant biphthalate. The inhibition by intracellular protons was voltage-independent with an IC50 of pH 6.2 and a Hill coefficient of 1.9, suggesting the cooperative binding of 2 protons to the intracellular face of the channel. In contrast, Kir1.3 expression in Xenopus oocytes was not detectable despite the fact that the cRNA efficiently directed the synthesis of a polypeptide of the expected Mr in an in vitro translation system. Co-expression of Kir1.3 with either Kir1.1 or Kir1.2 reduced currents resulting from expression of these inward-rectifier subunits alone, consistent with a dominant negative influence on Kir1.1 and Kir 1.2 expression.

With the recent recognition of the importance of G protein βγ subunits in intracellular signaling, studies have also begun to focus on receptor regions which may interact with these subunits (17Taylor J.M. Jacob-Mosier G.G. Lawton R.G. VanDort M. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3336-3339Google Scholar). The identification of regions of ARs involved in signaling to G proteins has not been reported. However, for several GPCRs such as the adrenergic receptors (18Strader C.D. Dixon R.A.F. Cheung A.H.

These studies have delineated the involvement of multiple and probably interdependent cytoplasmic domains of the GPCRs in transmitting signals to G proteins. In particular, genetic engineering of intracellular loop 2, intracellular loop 3, and the COOH-terminal tail has demonstrated the importance of these segments. Studies employing peptides whose design is based on these cytoplasmic domains of GPCRs (31Dalman H.M. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11025-11029Google Scholar, 32Okamoto T. Nishimoto I. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 16122-16127Google Scholar) have also resulted in altered G protein signaling. This extensive analysis has indicated that the precise location of amino acids of the receptor involved in G protein activation is not the same among the individual GPCRs. In order to define the regions of the A2aAR responsible for the selective activation of Gs, the present study profiles the functional responses of a series of chimeric ARs. From the analysis of chimeric ARs designed for this study, it is found that coupling of the A2aAR to Gs is predominantly dictated by amino acids constituting the NH2-terminal portion of intracellular loop 3. Individual amino acids in this region that have at least a partial role in Gs coupling are identified. The nature of the residues comprising the most COOH-terminal portion of intracellular loop 2 is also apparently critical. The relatively large cytoplasmic tail of the A2aAR appears to have little importance in the selective coupling of the receptor to Gs. Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) and Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies) were used for the construction of all genetically engineered receptors. ZM241385 was prepared, radioiodinated, and subsequently purified by high performance liquid chromatography as recently described (39Palmer T.M. Poucher S.M. Jacobson K.A. Stiles G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 970-974Google Scholar). All radiochemicals were from DuPont NEN. Cell culture supplies and pertussis toxin were from Life Technologies. Forskolin was from Calbiochem and R-PIA purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. NECA was a gift of Dr. R. Olsson (University of South Florida). Sequences derived from the canine A2aAR (40Maenhaut C. Van Sande J. Libert F. Abramowicz M. Parmentier M. Vanderhaegen J.-J. Dumont J.E. Vassart G. Schiffmann S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 1169-1178Google Scholar) and human A1AR (41Townsend-Nicholson A. Shine J. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 16: 365-370Google Scholar) were used to construct all chimeric receptors. Chimeric receptors employed in this study are identified as A2- (majority of structure derived from the A2aAR) or A1- (majority of structure derived from the A1AR) followed by the region in which the substitution of sequence from the donor receptor was made. For more restricted chimeras, an arrow (→) follows the specific amino acids of the A2aAR that were replaced with those of the A1AR. For point mutations, the A2aAR amino acid is given in single letter code followed by position number and then the residue used to make the substitution. The majority of chimeric receptors were constructed using a three-step polymerase chain reaction approach with oligonucleotides consisting of both A2aAR and A1AR sequences defining the splicing regions as described previously (42Olah M.E. Jacobson K.A. Stiles G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24692-24698Google Scholar). For constructs containing limited amino acid sequence, a two-step polymerase chain reaction technique was employed with a single oligonucleotide specifying the base substitutions. Constructs were sequenced with Sequenase 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) to confirm the presence of the desired mutations. CHO cells maintained in Ham's F-12 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml) were used for all studies. All cDNAs were subcloned into the pCMV5 expression vector (Dr. D. Russell, University of Texas Southwestern). For transient receptor expression, nearly confluent monolayers of CHO cells were transfected via a modified DEAE-dextran procedure (43Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) employing varying amounts (5-30 μg/75-cm2 flask depending on the construct) of receptor cDNA to obtain approximately the equivalent amount of receptor expression for functional studies. Membranes were prepared from cells approximately 72 h after transfection and employed immediately for radioligand binding and adenylyl cyclase assays. A 75-cm2 flask of transfected CHO cells was washed twice with 10 ml of ice-cold 10 mM Tris, 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, at 5°C and cells were then scraped into 6 ml of the same buffer. Cells were disrupted on ice by 20 strokes by hand in a glass homogenizer and aliquoted equally in two tubes for radioligand binding and adenylyl cyclase assays and the homogenates were centrifuged at 43,000 × g for 10 min. Membrane pellets were resuspended in 50 mM HEPES, 10 mM MgCl2, pH 6.8, or 50 mM Tris, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.26, at 4°C for 125I-ZM241385 or [3H]DPCPX binding assays, respectively. All membrane preparations were then treated with 2 units/ml adenosine deaminase. Saturation and competition binding assays were performed exactly as described previously (39Palmer T.M. Poucher S.M. Jacobson K.A. Stiles G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 970-974Google Scholar, 42Olah M.E. Jacobson K.A. Stiles G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24692-24698Google Scholar). In general, competition binding assays performed in the presence and absence of 10 μM Gpp(NH)p were conducted for only those constructs displaying impaired adenylyl cyclase activity. Assay of membrane adenylyl cyclase activity was performed via the method of Salomon (44Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Google Scholar) as described previously (45Olah M.E. Gallo-Rodriguez C. Jacobson K.A. Stiles G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 978-982Google Scholar). Briefly, membrane pellets were resuspended in TNM buffer (75 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, 1.25 mM MgCl2, pH 8.12, at 5°C) and treated with 2 units/ml adenosine deaminase for 5 min at 30°C. Adenylyl cyclase assays consisted of 40 μl of membrane suspension, 40 μl of cyclase mixture (TNM buffer supplemented with 140 μM dATP, 5 μM GTP, 30 units/ml creatine kinase, 5 mM creatine phosphate, 2.2 mM dithiothreitol, 100 μM papaverine, and 1.5 μCi of [α-32P]ATP) and 20 μl of increasing concentrations of agonist or forskolin at a final concentration of 1 μM. Assays were conducted at 30°C for 15 min and terminated by addition of a stop solution containing 20,000 cpm/ml [3H]cAMP. Labeled cAMP was isolated by sequential chromatography over Dowex and alumina columns and quantities determined by liquid scintillation counting. Protein concentrations were determined via the Bradford assay (46Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). To determine the effects of pertussis toxin on adenylyl cyclase activity, two 75-cm2 flasks of CHO cells were transiently transfected with receptor constructs as described above. 24 h post-transfection, cells were detached with trypsin, pooled, and aliquoted into three 75-cm2 flasks. The following day, a single flask was treated with 200 ng/ml pertussis toxin. Following a 24-h incubation, adenylyl cyclase activity was determined in membranes obtained from control and pertussis toxin-treated cells. The remaining flask of cells was used for receptor quantification via antagonist radioligand saturation binding. 125I-ZM241385 and [3H]DPCPX saturation binding curves and NECA versus 125I-ZM241385 competition binding data were analyzed via a computer modeling program as described previously (47DeLean A. Hancock A.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1982; 21: 5-16Google Scholar). For adenylyl cyclase assays, maximum responses to agonist are reported as a percentage of the adenylyl cyclase activity induced by 1 μM forskolin and agonist dose-response curves were analyzed via the computer modeling system described above to determine EC50 values. An ANOVA was used to compare ligand binding and adenylyl cyclase parameters of all mutant receptors to those obtained for the WT A2aAR. To begin to identify regions of the A2aAR which upon agonist binding are responsible for activation of adenylyl cyclase via Gs coupling, chimeric adenosine receptors in which cytoplasmic regions of the canine A2aAR were replaced with analogous segments of the human A1AR were constructed, transiently expressed in CHO cells, and pharmacologically characterized. Expression of receptor constructs was quantitated via saturation binding analysis with the antagonist radioligand, 125I-ZM241385 (39Palmer T.M. Poucher S.M. Jacobson K.A. Stiles G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 970-974Google Scholar). As certain studies have demonstrated a correlation between the level of GPCR membrane expression and agonist activity in functional assays (48Whaley B.S. Yuan N. Birnbaumer L. Clark R.B. Barber R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 481-489Google Scholar, 49MacEwan D.J. Kim G.D. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 316-325Google Scholar, 50Vogel W.K. Mosser V.A. Bulseco D.A. Schimerlik M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15485-15493Google Scholar), approximately equivalent levels (∼3.0-5.0 pmol/mg) of receptor expression were obtained for the majority of constructs by varying the amount of cDNA employed in transfections. As the expression of a limited number of constructs ranged from a low level of ∼1.5 pmol/mg, WT A2aAR activity was also examined at this relatively lower receptor density. Initial chimeric receptors contained the relatively large sequence substitution of the entire carboxyl terminus tail (A2-Tail) and entire third intracellular loop (A2-IC3) of the A2aAR with the corresponding segments of the A1AR (Fig. 1). The pharmacological profiles of WT A2aAR expressed at 2 levels, A2-Tail and A2-IC3, are shown in Table I. In membranes from untransfected CHO cells, NECA produced a maximal stimulation of adenylyl cyclase that was <5% of that induced by forskolin (data not shown). The WT A2aAR, expressed at a level of ∼4.3 pmol/mg, responded to NECA with a maximal stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity which was 87.6%± 11.0% of that induced by 1 μM forskolin. This represented an approximate 7-fold increase in adenylyl cyclase activity above basal levels. The EC50 value for NECA was 256.3 ± 51.8 nM. Decreasing WT A2aAR expression by ∼66% did not significantly affect these parameters of adenylyl cyclase stimulation. At either level, 125I-ZM241385 displayed high affinity binding as described previously (39Palmer T.M. Poucher S.M. Jacobson K.A. Stiles G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 970-974Google Scholar). Replacement of the entire carboxyl terminus tail of the A2aAR with that of the A1AR (A2-Tail) did not diminish the maximal stimulation of adenylyl cyclase induced by NECA nor significantly affect the EC50 of the agonist. Conversely, replacement of the entire third intracellular loop of the A2aAR (A2-IC3) resulted in an ∼75% reduction in maximal adenylyl cyclase stimulation relative to wild-type receptor. Additionally, at A2-IC3 the EC50 of NECA increased ∼5-fold.Table I.Analysis of WT A2aAR, intracellular loop 3 and cytoplasmic tail A1/A2aAR chimeras in ligand binding and adenylyl cyclase assaysReceptor125I-ZM241385 bindingNECA stimulated adenylyl cyclaseBmaxKdMaximal responseaRepresents response expressed relative to 1 μM forskolin.EC50pmol/mgnM%nMWT A2aAR-high (10)4.33 ± 0.261.74 ± 0.2187.6 ± 11.0256.3 ± 51.8WT A2aAR-low (3)1.54 ± 0.200.94 ± 0.3072.0 ± 7.3404.7 ± 118.6A2-Tail (5)3.66 ± 0.640.82 ± 0.18bp < 0.05, significantly different than WT A2aAR.70.1 ± 8.0255.2 ± 40.5A2-IC3 (4)4.07 ± 0.361.57 ± 0.1422.3 ± 5.4cp < 0.01, significantly different than WT A2aAR.1368 ± 346cp < 0.01, significantly different than WT A2aAR.a Represents response expressed relative to 1 μM forskolin.b p < 0.05, significantly different than WT A2aAR.c p < 0.01, significantly different than WT A2aAR. Open table in a new tab To determine which regions of the third intracellular loop replacement constituting A2-IC3 may be responsible for this chimera's impaired stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, a series of more restricted chimeric receptors was created. Fig. 1 contains a sequence alignment of intracellular loop 3 of the canine A2aAR and human A1AR as well as a schematic representation of the mutants focusing on the third intracellular loop of the A2aAR. Of the four chimeric receptors studied (Table II), only A2-IC3N representing substitution of 20 amino acids at the NH2-terminal portion of the loop displayed diminished capacity to activate adenylyl cyclase. In response to NECA, A2-IC3N was able to mediate a maximal stimulation of adenylyl cyclase approximately 50% of that observed at the WT A2aAR. The EC50 for NECA (189.5 ± 34.0 nM), however, was similar to that displayed by the WT A2aAR. At receptors A2ER→AA and A2RSTL→QKYY that both consisted of sequence substitution in the mid-portion of the third intracellular loop, NECA induced a maximal stimulation of adenylyl cyclase similar to that at the WT A2aAR. The potency of NECA at A2ER→AA (EC50 = 492.7 ± 75.9 nM) was slightly lower than at WT A2aAR. Data obtained with A2-KVSAS (see below) also indicated that sequence in the mid-portion of the third intracellular loop had no role in the selectivity of G protein coupling by the A2aAR. A2-IC3C consisting of amino acid substitutions in the COOH-terminal segment of the third intracellular loop of the A2aAR stimulated adenylyl cyclase in response to NECA in a fashion nearly identical to that of the WT A2aAR.Table II.Analysis of A1/A2aAR chimeras focusing on regions of intracellular loop 3 in ligand binding and adenylyl cyclase assays125I-ZM241385 bindingNECA stimulated adenylyl cyclaseBmaxKdMaximal responseaRepresents response expressed relative to 1 μM forskolin.EC50pmol/mgnM%nMWT A2aAR (10)4.33 ± 0.261.74 ± 0.2187.6 ± 11.0256.3 ± 51.8A2-IC3 (4)4.07 ± 0.361.57 ± 0.1422.3 ± 5.4bp < 0.01, significantly different than WT A2aAR.1368 ± 346bp < 0.01, significantly different than WT A2aAR.A2-IC3N (4)4.83 ± 0.262.67 ± 0.07cp < 0.05, significantly different than WT A2aAR.41.1 ± 7.2cp < 0.05, significantly different than WT A2aAR.189.3 ± 40.0A2ER → AA (6)2.98 ± 0.701.51 ± 0.1370.6 ± 9.1497.2 ± 75.9cp < 0.05, significantly different than WT A2aAR.A2RSTL → QKYY (5)3.42 ± 0.661.85 ± 0.4465.1 ± 4.7301.8 ± 66.6A2-IC3C (3)3.46 ± 0.151.68 ± 0.5091.8 ± 12.6177.0 ± 20.9a Represents response expressed relative to 1 μM forskolin.b p < 0.01, significantly different than WT A2aAR.c p < 0.05, significantly different than WT A2aAR. Open table in a new tab Taken together, the above results suggest that the impairment of adenylyl cyclase observed with the chimera A2-IC3 occurred principally due to replacement of amino acids in the NH2-terminal portion of the third intracellular loop. In order to further identify residues in the 20-amino acid replacement of A2-IC3N which may confer coupling to Gs, more restricted chimeric receptors were created (Fig. 1, Table III). A2-KVSAS represents a substitution of solely the distal 5 amino acids constituting the A2-IC3N chimera. At A2-KVSAS, NECA induced a maximal stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and displayed a potency similar to that at the WT A2aAR. Based on this finding, subsequent mutagenesis focused on the first 15 amino acids of the third intracellular loop. Unfortunately, chimeric receptors and a deletion mutant constructed to further study this region did not display appreciable 125I-ZM241385 binding nor stimulate adenylyl cyclase in response to NECA regardless of the amount of transfected cDNA. It is assumed that such proteins did not undergo the processing or folding required for proper membrane insertion or orientation. The presently employed sequence alignment of the A1AR and A2aAR indicated that 4 of the 15 amino acids in this region are conserved among the receptors, thus several of the remaining nonconserved residues were targeted for point mutations (Fig. 1, Table III). For the three mutant receptors examined, amino acids of the WT A2aAR were substituted with the analogous residues of the A1AR with the exception of E212Q in which the sequence alignment contained a gap in this region. Thus, glutamine was selected to replace glutamic acid at position 212 of the WT A2aAR. At the double point mutation A2RL→EY, NECA demonstrated a stimulation of adenylyl cyclase comparable to that at WT A2aAR in regards to both potency and efficacy. At both K209N and E212Q, NECA displayed unimpaired maximal stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, however, EC50 values were increased. Relative to WT A2aAR, NECA was approximately 3- and 5-fold less potent at K209N and E212Q, respectively. It is noted that E212Q was the only construct examined in this study which demonstrated a substantial (∼3.5-fold) decrease in affinity for the antagonist radioligand, 125I-ZM241385.Table III.Analysis of A1/A2aAR chimeras and A2aAR point mutations focusing on the NH2-terminal region of intracellular loop 3 in ligand binding and adenylyl cyclase assaysReceptor125I-ZM241385 bindingNECA stimulated adenylyl cyclaseBmaxKdMaximal responseaRepresents response expressed relative to 1 μM forskolin.EC50pmol/mgnM%nMWT A2aAR (10)4.33 ± 0.261.74 ± 0.2187.6 ± 11.0256.3 ± 51.8A2-IC3N (4)4.83 ± 0.262.67 ± 0.0741.1 ± 7.2bp < 0.05, significantly dfferent than WT A2aAR.189.3 ± 34.0A2-KVSAS (4)3.37 ± 0.611.40 ± 0.2285.3 ± 11.7460.0 ± 90.6A2RL → EY (3)4.95 ± 0.582.00 ± 0.1570.0 ± 6.4251.3 ± 92.0K209N (3)3.30 ± 0.851.49 ± 0.44108.2 ± 7.0786.7 ± 122cp < 0.01, significantly different than WT A2aAR.E212Q (4)3.61 ± 0.456.33 ± 1.00cp < 0.01, significantly different than WT A2aAR.102.2 ± 16.41358 ± 333cp < 0.01, significantly different than WT A2aAR.a Represents response expressed relative to 1 μM forskolin.b p < 0.05, significantly dfferent than WT A2aAR.c p < 0.01, significantly different than WT A2aAR. Open table in a new tab To determine if the impaired stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by those mutant receptors described above resulted from reduced affinity of the receptors for agonist, the ability of NECA to compete for 125I-ZM241385 binding was analyzed. An additional parameter of receptor-G protein coupling, the sensitivity of agonist high affinity binding to the nonhydrolyzable guanine nucleotide Gpp(NH)p, was also examined. Table IV contains the results of the competition binding studies. Using membranes from transiently transfected CHO cells, the binding of NECA to the A2aAR was best fit to a two-site model (KH = 11.8 ± 3.5 nM; KL = 193.0 ± 62.0 nM) with 52.6 ± 6.8% of the receptors in the high affinity state. Consistent with previous studies of the A2aAR (51Barrington W.W. Jacobson K.A. Hutchison A.J. Williams M. Stiles G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6572-6576Google Scholar, 52Nanoff C. Jacobson K.A. Stiles G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 130-135Google Scholar), agonist binding was not sensitive to guanine nucleotide treatment (KH = 22.1 ± 5.3 nM; KL = 266.8 ± 26.3 nM; %RH = 79.7 ± 9.6%). NECA competition studies with A2-IC3 were performed four times with the data of individual experiments twice best fit by a two-site model (KH = 18.5 ± 2.1 nM; KL = 385.3 ± 170.8 nM; %RH = 76.7 ± 0.8%) and twice by a one-site model (Ki = 20.1 ± 1.8 nM). In the presence of Gpp(NH)p, NECA binding at A2-IC3 was best fit by a one-site model with relatively high affinity binding remaining (Ki = 31.4 ± 6.3 nM).

The change in amino acid sequence caused by RNA editing can affect both the kinetics and the permeability of the ion channel receptors to cations. Here, we report the purification of a 90-kDa double-stranded RNA-specific adenosine deaminase from HeLa cell nuclear extract that specifically edits the glutamine codon at position 586 in the pre-mRNA of the glutamate receptor B subunit. Site-specific deamination of an adenosine to an inosine converts the glutamine codon to that of arginine.

https://openalex.org/W2077628371,"The human β-globin gene cluster is regulated in part by a distal locus control region that is required for opening a chromatin domain in erythroid cells and enhancing expression of the β-like globin genes at the correct developmental stages. One part of the locus control region, called hypersensitive site 2 (HS2), functions as a strong enhancer. Matches to the consensus binding sites for basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins (E boxes) are well conserved within the HS2 core. We show that mutations of the HS2 core that alter an invariant E box cause a 3.5-fold reduction in enhancement of expression of an ε-globin reporter gene in transiently transfected K562 cells, both before and after induction. Mutations of the HS2 core that alter a less-highly conserved E box cause a more modest reduction in enhancement. Footprint analysis shows binding of erythroid nuclear proteins in vitro to the invariant E box as well as an adjacent CAC/GTG box.

Interaction between the E boxes and the bHLH proteins, as well as other binding proteins, could account for the role of these sites in enhancement by HS2. The human β-globin domain contains a cluster of developmentally regulated genes that are temporally expressed in the order of their array along the chromosome. Expression of the genes is greatly influenced by a distal regulatory element known as the locus control region (LCR). 1The abbreviations used are: LCRlocus control regionHS2DNase hypersensitive site 2bHLHbasic helix-loop-helixUSFupstream stimulatory factorTAL1T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia protein 1E47one product of the E2A geneMELmouse erythroleukemia. The LCR was first noted as a set of five DNase I-hypersensitive sites located at the 5′ end of the gene cluster (1Tuan D. Solomon W. Li Q. London I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6384-6388Google Scholar, 2Forrester W.C. Thompson C. Elder J.T. Groudine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1359-1363Google Scholar, 3Dhar V. Nandi A. Schildkraut C.L. Skoultchi A.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4324-4333Google Scholar). The presence of the LCR is necessary to form an open, transcriptionally competent chromatin conformation within this domain in erythroid cells (reviewed in 4Grosveld F. Antoniou M. Berry M. de Boer E. Dillon N. Ellis J. Fraser P. Hanscombe O. Hurst J. Imam A. Lindenbaum M. Philipsen S. Pruzina S. Strouboulis J. Raguz-Bolognesi S. Talbot D. Philos. Trans. R. Soc.

Transgenic Swine: The Hunt for the Red Blood Cell Substitute. R. G. Landes Publishing Co., Georgetown, TX1997Google Scholar). Loss of the LCR results in closed chromatin that represses gene transcription, e.g. as found in Hispanic γδβ thalassemia (7Forrester W.C. Epner E. Driscoll M.C. Enver T. Brice M. Papayannopoulou T. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1637-1649Google Scholar). A 21-kb restriction fragment containing DNase-hypersensitive sites 1-5 is sufficient to confer position-independent, copy number dependent expression on a linked β-globin gene in transgenic mice, achieving a level of expression comparable to that of the endogenous mouse α-globin gene (8Grosveld F. van Assendelft G.B. Greaves D. Kollias G. Cell. 1987; 51: 975-985Google Scholar). The LCR can act as a classical enhancer of globin gene expression (9Tuan D. Solomon W. London I. Lee D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2554-2558Google Scholar), but this large, distal regulator can also cause conformational changes over long distances (at least 70 kb) in the β-globin domain, resulting in domain opening and insulation from position effects. Within this open domain in erythroid cells, stage-specific and high level expression of the genes requires the interaction (directly via looping or indirectly via tracking) of the LCR enhancer and the appropriate promoter. Thus it is important to discover all the cis-acting regulatory sequences in the LCR, and proteins binding to them, that function in domain opening, insulation and/or enhancement. locus control region DNase hypersensitive site 2 basic helix-loop-helix upstream stimulatory factor T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia protein 1 one product of the E2A gene mouse erythroleukemia. Since the entire LCR covers at least 17 kb, considerable effort has been devoted to finding smaller regions that produce effects approaching that of the intact LCR. Sets of 2-4-kb fragments, each containing a single HS region, that combine HS1, HS2, HS3, and HS4 in a “microlocus” or “mini-LAR” construct can produce high level expression of the β-globin gene in stably transfected MEL cells (10Forrester W.C.

Nature. 1989; 338: 352-355Google Scholar). Indeed, a DNA fragment containing HS2 alone is a potent activator of expression at all stages of development (12Fraser P. Pruzina S. Antoniou M. Grosveld F. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 106-113Google Scholar), and position-independent, developmentally regulated expression has been described for 1.5-2-kb restriction fragments containing only HS2 (13Ryan T.M. Behringer R.R. Martin N.C. Townes T.M. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 314-323Google Scholar, 14Morley B.J. Abbott C.A. Sharpe J.A. Lida J. Chan-Thomas P.S. Wood W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2057-2066Google Scholar). These strong activities in gain-of-function assays have attracted intense study of HS2. In nuclei, this hypersensitive region consists of a cluster of DNase I cleavage sites in a 600-bp region, with two prominent sites surrounded by several minor sites (15Talbot D. Philipsen S. Fraser P. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2169-2178Google Scholar). A 400-bp HindIII to XbaI fragment that spans most of these cleavage sites is sufficient for position independent expression in transgenic mice (16Caterina J.J. Ryan T.M. Pawlik K.M. Palmiter R.D.

The HS2 core is also sufficient for high level expression in transgenic mice and stably transfected MEL and K562 cells, although larger DNA fragments will produce a higher level of expression after stable integration (15Talbot D. Philipsen S. Fraser P. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2169-2178Google Scholar, 16Caterina J.J. Ryan T.M. Pawlik K.M. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. Behringer R.R. Townes T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sequences required for position-independent expression without enhancement map outside the core (18Caterina J.J. Ciavatta D.J. Donze D. Behringer R.R. Townes T.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1006-1011Google Scholar). However, when assayed for effects on transient expression prior to integration, the 400-bp HS2 core enhances as strongly as larger DNA fragments, indicating that this core is sufficient for full enhancement by the HS2 region (9Tuan D. Solomon W. London I. Lee D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2554-2558Google Scholar, 19Lister J. Forrester W.C. Baron M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17939-17946Google Scholar, 20Ney P.

Earlier analyses have pointed out conserved regions between the AP1/NFE2 binding sites and other footprinting regions in HS2 (35Hardison R. Xu J. Jackson J. Mansberger J. Selifonova O. Grotch B. Biesecker J. Petrykowska H. Miller W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1265-1272Google Scholar), including a prominent E box and a CAC box (36Hardison R. Elnitski L. Goldstrohm A. ElSherbini A. Riemer C.

In this paper, we report a role of HS2 E boxes in enhancement of globin gene expression, and present evidence that specific basic helix-loop-helix proteins, including TAL1 and USF, bind to these sites. The sequence of the top strand of the duplex oligonucleotides used in the mutagenesis and mobility shift assays are as follows: h8701 E box, ctaGTGTGCCCAGATGTTCTC; h8701 E box mutant, GTGTGTGCCTAGACGTTCTCAGCCT; 8762 E box, ctagAGGGCAGATGGCAA; 8762 E box, mutant GCTTACAGGGAAGACCGCAAAAAAAAGG; rabbit 8701, ctaGTGGCCAGATGTTTTCAGCCC; rabbit 8701 mutant, ctaGTGGAGCTGACTCTTCAGCCC; TAL1, ACCTGAACAGATGGTCGG; 8790 HS2 USF, GGAGAAGCTGACCACCTGACTAAAACTCC; 8659 AP1, ctagATGCTGAGTCATGATGAGTCATG; YY1, AATTCGTTTTGCGACATTTTGCGACACG; 8730 GATA1, ctaGACTCCTATCTGGGTCCCC. Consensus sequences for binding motifs are underlined, and mutated nucleotides are bold-faced. Nucleotides added at the 5′ ends of the sequence (for end labeling) are in lower case. An extension of AGCT is on the 5′ end of the complementary strand of h8701, h8770, and 8659 AP1, and CTAG on GATA1. The E boxes are named according to the position of the C in the CANNTG in the GenBank sequence HUMHBB; the number in the AP1 binding site is the position of the G that begins the first recognition site for NFE2. In the alignments in Slightom et al., (68Slightom J. Bock J. Tagle D. Gumucio D. Goodman M. Stojanovic N. Jackson J. Miller W. Hardison R. Genomics. 1997; 39 (in press)Google Scholar), the numbers of these positions are increased by 2687. The TAL1 binding site probe contains the optimal binding site for a TAL1-E47 heterodimer (37Hsu H.-L. Huang L. Tsan J.T. Funk W. Wright W.E. Hu J.-S. Kingston R.E. Baer R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1256-1265Google Scholar). The YY1 binding site is from the P5 promoter of adeno-associated virus (38Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.-S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 678: 377-388Google Scholar). The GATA1 binding site probe is from HS2, HUMHBB positions 8725-8743. The USF binding site probe is also from HS2, HUMHBB positions 8778-8806. The unique site elimination method of site-directed mutagenesis (39Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Google Scholar) was used with the HS2 HindIII-XbaI core fragment to alter the E box consensus at positions 8701, 8762, or both. The mutant oligonucleotides listed above (top strand only) were individually annealed to a denatured template plasmid, a new strand was synthesized from dNTPs by T4 DNA polymerase, and the remaining nick was sealed by T4 DNA ligase plus ATP. A second oligonucleotide served as a selective primer by changing a downstream BamHI site to BglII. Mutant plasmids were enriched by digesting the pooled samples with BamHI to linearize wild type plasmids. The pools were then transformed into competent Escherichia coli strain BMH 71-18, which is mutated at mutS. Plasmids were collected en mass, cut again with BamHI, and transformed into competent E. coli strain BOZO. Multiple rounds of transformation and restriction digestion were conducted until most of the pool was resistant to BamHI treatment. The construct with the 8701 E box mutated served as the template for the double mutant. The 400-bp HindIII to XbaI DNA fragment containing the core of human HS2 was cloned into pBluescript II KS- (Stratagene) at the EcoRV site. Constructs containing the mutations in HS2 were digested with HindIII and PstI, and the excised fragment containing the mutant HS2 was inserted into the ε-globin-luciferase reporter vector (35Hardison R.

Hardison R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11871-11878Google Scholar) at BamHI and PstI, using a BamHI to HindIII adapter oligonucleotide. Cloning of the wild-type human HS2 core into the ε-globin-luciferase reporter was described previously (40Jackson J.D. Petrykowska H. Philipsen S. Miller W. Hardison R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11871-11878Google Scholar). A duplex oligonucleotide covering the HS2 E box sequence at 8701 (described above) contained HindIII-SpeI overhangs which enabled direct cloning into the reporter vector; the resulting plasmid contained 3 copies of the E box sequence. All mutants and new constructs were verified by DNA sequence determination. The human cell line K562 was grown in Life Technologies, Inc. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% bovine calf serum, 2% antibiotic-antimycotic (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 0.5 μg/ml amphatericin B in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Electroporations were performed with 10 μg of test plasmid, 10 μg of pRSVlacZ plasmid (41Thompson J.P. Simkevich C.P. Holness M.A. Kang A.H. Raghow R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2549-2556Google Scholar), and 30 μg of pBluescript as a carrier in 0.7 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. The electrical field generated was 450 V/cm with a capacitance of 500 microfarads. Cells were plated into 7.5 ml of medium with or without 40 μM hemin. The medium was harvested 48 h after transfection and lysed by Promega Cell Lysis Solution. Luciferase activity was measured form 5 μl of cell extract using Promega Luciferase Assay Reagent. β-Galactosidase activity was measured by the A420 of 30 μl of cell extract mixed with 0.7 mM o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactoside, 45 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 67 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, followed by quenching with 1 M sodium carbonate (42Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1972Google Scholar). Each transfection was done in triplicate. Nuclear extracts of K562, MEL, and hemin induced MEL were prepared by Dounce homogenization of isolated nuclei in buffered 0.42 M NaCl and dialysis in 20 mM HEPES, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mM EDTA, and 100 mM KCl (43Dignam J. Lebvitz R.L. Roeder R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar). All procedures were performed at 4°C and all buffers contained 0.5 mM dithiothreitol and the protease inhibitor 0.3 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. DNase I footprint assays were carried out essentially as described by Galas and Schmitz (44Galas D.J. Schmitz A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 3157-3170Google Scholar). 2 ng of end-labeled rabbit HS2 sequence, a 100-bp AvaII to HindIII fragment (40Jackson J.D. Petrykowska H. Philipsen S. Miller W. Hardison R. J.

Then 50 μl of 5 mM CaCl2, 10 mM MgCl2, and 5 μl of DNase I (10 ng/μl) were added to the binding reaction and allowed to digest at room temperature for 15 s. Control samples contained no nuclear extract and 10,000-fold less DNase I. Reactions were quenched with 100 μl of 200 mM NaCl, 20 M EDTA, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 250 μg/μl yeast tRNA followed by phenol and chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Marker lanes are the products of depurination (Maxam and Gilbert G+A reaction) of the same amount of labeled probe, obtained by mixing it with 1 μg of calf thymus DNA plus 1 μl of 1 M formic acid, incubating for 20 min at 37°C, followed by strand cleavage by adding 150 μl of 1 M piperidine and incubating at 90°C for 30 min. After being chilled on ice, samples were precipitated in isobutyl alcohol, resuspended in 1% SDS, and pelleted again. Samples were then rinsed with 95% ethanol and dried before being resuspended in formamide loading dye (80% formamide, 2% xylene cyanol) and denatured at 90°C for 5 min prior to loading on a denaturing 15% polyacrylamide, 6 M urea, 0.5 × TBE gel (TBE is 45 mM Tris base, 45 mM boric acid, and 1 mM EDTA). Protein-DNA complexes were detected by decreased mobility of 3′ end-labeled oligonucleotide probes in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (45Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids. Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Google Scholar). Binding reactions contained 2 ng of double stranded probe, binding buffer (as used in DNase I footprinting), and 10 μg (K562) or 30 μg (MEL) nuclear extract in a final volume of 25 μl, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were loaded on nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels and run in 0.5 × TBE for 2 h at 200 V. Gels were dried and exposed to either x-ray film or a PhosphorImager screen for autoradiography. Any competitor DNA used was added at the time of reaction assembly, prior to addition of the labeled probe. Antibody “supershift” assays included an intermediate incubation of the binding components with the desired antibody or preimmune serum for 10 min at room temperature prior to the addition of labeled probe. Antibodies against mouse and human TAL1 were gifts of Dr. R. Baer. Antibodies against E2A proteins were purchased from PharMingen. The antibody against human USF was a gift of Dr. E. Bresnick. The HS2 core of the LCR of the human β-globin domain (Fig. 1A) contains several short regions implicated in function by mutagenesis studies, protein binding in vivo or in vitro, and/or strong conservation of the DNA sequence (Fig. 1B). The multiple sequence alignment in the most highly conserved heart of the HS2 core is displayed in Fig. 1C. The alignments were computed as described previously (46Hardison R. Chao K.-M. Adamkiewicz M. Price D. Jackson J. Zeigler T. Stojanovic N. Miller W. DNA Sequence. 1993; 4: 163-176Google Scholar, 47Chao K.-M. Hardison R. Miller W. J. Comp. Biol. 1994; 1: 271-291Google Scholar)3; a full alignment throughout mammalian β-globin gene clusters can be accessed via the Internet (http://globin.cse.psu.edu/). Notable blocks of almost invariant sequences include the AP1-binding sites, the CACBP binding site (or GT motif) beginning at 8689, the E box at 8701, and a GATA motif beginning at 8730, which is bound by proteins both in vitro (15Talbot D. Philipsen S. Fraser P. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2169-2178Google Scholar) and in vivo (27Ikuta T. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10188-10192Google Scholar, 28Reddy P.M.S. Shen C.-K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8676-8680Google Scholar). These sites are among the most highly conserved in a 17-kb region containing the LCR (68Slightom J. Bock J. Tagle D. Gumucio D. Goodman M. Stojanovic N. Jackson J. Miller W. Hardison R. Genomics. 1997; 39 (in press)Google Scholar), based on searches for invariant strings as well as for segments of high information content (48Stormo G. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 211-221Google Scholar). Other sites are less highly conserved, but still notable. These include a non-consensus GATA motif beginning at 8721, the region just 3′ to the 8730 GATA motif, an E box beginning at 8762, and a previously described binding site for USF (49Bresnick E.H. Felsenfeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18824-18834Google Scholar) that accounts for footprint H (15Talbot D. Philipsen S. Fraser P. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2169-2178Google Scholar). Application of a different criterion for “conserved” (six consecutive columns containing no more than one mismatch per column) reveals a block beginning at 8710, just 3′ to the E box at 8701 (36Hardison R. Elnitski L. Goldstrohm A. ElSherbini A. Riemer C. Schwartz S. Stojanovic N. Miller W. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Molecular Biology of Hemoglobin Switching. Intercept, Ltd., Andover, Hampshire, UK1995: 405-426Google Scholar). Many of these sites shown in Fig. 1C are spaced about 10 base pairs apart, suggesting the formation of a contiguous protein array along the DNA, possibly with many of the proteins on the same face of the helix. An E box has the consensus sequence CANNTG, and is the binding site for homo- or heterodimers of basic helix-loop-helix proteins. Often the heterodimers are between tissue-specific regulatory proteins such as MyoD and ubiquitously expressed proteins such as E47, one product of the E2A gene (50Blackwell T.K. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1104-1110Google Scholar). Both the invariant 8701 E box and the 8762 E box have the sequence CAGATG. Although the block containing the USF binding site beginning at 8790 fulfills the “model row” criterion for conserved (Fig. 1),3 the initial CA of the E box is not found in other mammals examined. Previous studies had not examined the 8701 and 8762 E boxes, so we tested the function of these sites and analyzed protein binding in vitro. The contribution of the E boxes to the ability of HS2 to enhance expression of linked reporter genes was tested by transfection of K562 cells. These human cells have the capacity to differentiate to produce markers of both the monocytic and erythroid lineages and hence can be considered models of the CFU-GEMM stage (51Yoo J. Herman L.E. Li C. Krantz S.B. Tuan D. Blood. 1996; 87: 2558-2567Google Scholar). However, prior to induction, K562 cells display a mixed embryonic and fetal erythroid phenotype, expressing ε- and γ-globin genes along with the α- and ζ-globin genes (52Rutherford T.R. Clegg J.B. Weatherall D.J. Nature. 1979; 280: 164-165Google Scholar, 53Dean A. Ley T. Humphries R.K. Fordis M. Schechter A.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5515-5519Google Scholar). Treatment with hemin increases hemoglobin production about 3-fold. Reporter genes with either ε-globin or γ-globin promoters will express when transfected into K562 cells, and DNA fragments containing HS2 will enhance that expression dramatically, both in short-term transient transfections with unintegrated constructs and in stable transfection with integrated constructs (e.g. 9, 20, 26, 40). The E boxes at 8701 and 8762 were mutated to eliminate the bHLH recognition sites, both individually and in combination (Fig. 2A), and tested for their effects on transient expression of an ε-globin-luciferase reporter gene (40Jackson J.D. Petrykowska H. Philipsen S. Miller W. Hardison R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11871-11878Google Scholar). Whereas the wild-type HS2 core gave a 59-fold increase over the level of expression in the absence of an enhancer, the HS2 core mutated at the 8701 E box gave only a 15-fold increase (Fig. 2B), i.e. a 4-fold reduction in enhancement over that of the wild-type. Thus the E box at 8701 contributes to but is not essential for the enhancement by HS2, unlike the AP1 binding sites, which when mutated cause a complete loss of enhancement (20Ney P. Sorrentino B. McDonagh K. Nienhuis A. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 993-1006Google Scholar, 25Talbot D. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1391-1398Google Scholar, 54Moi P. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9000-9004Google Scholar). The mutation in the E box at 8762 caused an approximately 1.5-fold reduction in enhancement. Combining the two E box mutations gave no further reduction in enhancement, but rather produced a reduction similar to that obtained with the single 8701 E box mutation. Hemin induction caused a roughly 5-fold increase in the level of expression of all the constructs containing HS2, with or without mutation of the E boxes (Fig. 2B). The induced level of expression seen with the HS2 cores containing E box mutations is less than the induced level seen with the wild-type core, reflecting the role of the E boxes in enhancement. However, the fold induction is not affected by mutation at either or both E boxes, indicating that inducibility involves some other sequences. For instance, the AP1-binding sites have been implicated in inducibility (24Sorrentino B. Ney P. Bodine D. Nienhuis A.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2721-2731Google Scholar). The contribution of the 8701 E box to enhancement of HS2 is dependent on the presence of flanking HS2 sequences. When a duplex oligonucleotide containing only the human 8701 E box was introduced into the ε-globin-luciferase vector, it actually reduced transient expression in K562 cells 2-fold, both with or without induction (Fig. 2C). As described previously for reporter genes driven by a γ-globin gene promoter (20Ney P. Sorrentino B. McDonagh K. Nienhuis A. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 993-1006Google Scholar, 54Moi P. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9000-9004Google Scholar), the tandem AP1 binding sites by themselves do provide a 3-4-fold enhancement and a roughly 4-5-fold induction of expression of the ε-globin-luciferase gene in transfected K562 cells. However, this is only a fraction of the enhancement obtained with the wild-type HS2 core (Fig. 2C). The data in Fig. 2B indicate that the E boxes contribute to the additional enhancement seen with the intact HS2 core. Given the positive effect of sequences outside the AP1-binding sites on enhancement, we mapped the sites of protein binding to the heart of th"

https://openalex.org/W2032002938,"The arsenical resistance (ars) operon of the conjugative R-factor R773 confers resistance to arsenical and antimonial compounds in Escherichia coli, where resistance results from active extrusion of arsenite catalyzed by the products of the arsA and arsB genes. Previous in vivo studies on the energetics of arsenite extrusion showed that expression of both genes produced an ATP-coupled arsenite extrusion system that was independent of the electrochemical proton gradient. In contrast, in cells expressing only the arsB gene, arsenite extrusion was coupled to electrochemical energy and independent of ATP, suggesting that the Ars transport system exhibits a dual mode of energy coupling depending on the subunit composition. In vitro the ArsA-ArsB complex has been shown to catalyze ATP-coupled uptake of 73AsO2−1 in everted membrane vesicles. However, transport catalyzed by ArsB alone has not previously been observed in vitro. In this study we demonstrate everted membrane vesicles prepared from cells expressing only arsB exhibit uptake of 73AsO2−1 coupled to electrochemical energy.

However, transport catalyzed by ArsB alone has not previously been observed in vitro. In this study we demonstrate everted membrane vesicles prepared from cells expressing only arsB exhibit uptake of 73AsO2−1 coupled to electrochemical energy. Resistance to arsenical and antimonial compounds in bacterial cells is mediated by active extrusion of oxyanions of As(III) or Sb(III) from the cells (1Dey S. Rosen B.P. Georgopapadakou N.H. Drug Transport in Antimicrobial and Anticancer Chemotherapy. Dekker, New York1995: 103-132Google Scholar, 2Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 273-277Google Scholar, 3Rosen B.P. Bhattacharjee H. Shi W.P. J. Bioenerg. Biomemb. 1995; 27: 85-91Google Scholar). These efflux systems are encoded by ars operons. The ars operon of the conjugative R-factor R773 of Escherichia coli has been shown to encode an anion-translocating ATPase composed of two types of subunits, ArsA and ArsB. ArsA, the catalytic subunit, is a 63-kDa As(III)/Sb(III)-stimulated ATPase (4Bhattacharjee H. Li J. Ksenzenko M.K. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11245-11250Google Scholar). ArsB is a 45-kDa inner membrane protein that catalyzes oxyanion translocation (5Wu J. Tisa L.S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12570-12576Google Scholar). The ArsA-ArsB complex has been shown both in vivo (6Mobley H.L.T. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6119-6122Google Scholar, 7Rosen B.P. Borbolla M.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 124: 760-765Google Scholar, 8Dey S. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 385-389Google Scholar) and in vitro to be an obligatorily ATP-coupled primary pump (9Dey S. Dou D. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25442-25446Google Scholar). However, recent results from several laboratories have shown that an arsB gene in the absence of an arsA gene is sufficient for resistance. While the ars operons of plasmids R773 (10Chen C.-M. Misra T. Silver S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15030-15038Google Scholar) and R46 (11Bruhn D.F. Li J. Silver S. Roberto F. Rosen B.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 139: 149-153Google Scholar) have arsA genes, the homologous operons of the staphylococcal plasmids pI258 (12Ji G. Silver S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3684-3694Google Scholar) and pSX267 (13Rosenstein R. Peschel P. Wieland B. Götz F. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3676-3683Google Scholar) and the chromosomal ars operon of E. coli (14Sofia H.J. Burland V. Daniels D.L. Plunkett G. Blattner F.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2576-2586Google Scholar, 15Carlin A. Shi W. Dey S. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 981-986Google Scholar) do not contain an arsA gene. Cells expressing the pI258 and E. coli chromosomal ars operons extrude arsenite (15Carlin A. Shi W. Dey S. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 981-986Google Scholar, 16Silver S. Keach D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6114-6118Google Scholar). There are at least two possible interpretations of these results. First, there could be a chromosomal arsA gene or homologue. Although this possibility cannot be ruled out, there are no data supporting it. Second, those ArsB proteins could function independently of ArsA, perhaps as a secondary carrier protein. The chromosomally encoded ArsB is 79% identical and overall 90% similar to the R773 ArsB. It seems intuitively unlikely that such close homologues would catalyze different reactions. When the R773 arsB gene was expressed in the absence of arsA, it conferred arsenical resistance and active extrusion (8Dey S. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 385-389Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the ArsB protein alone can catalyze energy-dependent efflux in the absence of a catalytic subunit. For these reasons the energetics of ArsB-catalyzed efflux was compared with that of the ArsAB pump (8Dey S. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 385-389Google Scholar). In cells expressing arsB alone, arsenite transport was coupled only to electrochemical energy, not chemical energy, suggesting that a chromosomally encoded ArsA protein is probably not involved. Interestingly, the transmembrane structure of the R773 ArsB is topologically identical to secondary membrane carriers, with 12 membrane spanning segments (5Wu J. Tisa L.S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12570-12576Google Scholar). From the aggregate of these results, we postulated that ArsB functions as a secondary arsenite transporter in the absence of an ArsA subunit, a novel dual mechanism of energy coupling of a transport system (8Dey S. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 385-389Google Scholar). However, all of the data suggesting a role of ArsB in secondary anion translocation were from physiological studies. In this study, we provide the first direct in vitro evidence that ArsB catalyzes electrophoretic anion transport. We have constructed an arsB expression plasmid that has enabled us to measure arsenite transport activity in everted membrane vesicles. NADH respiration provided electrochemical energy for ArsB-mediated transport in vesicles. Transport was sensitive to the addition of uncouplers and depolarizing permeant anions, indicating that in these everted vesicles anion transport is coupled to an electrochemical proton gradient, positive interior. Restriction enzymes and nucleic acid modifying enzymes were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. and Promega. Oligonucleotides were synthesized in the Macromolecular Core Facility of Wayne State University School of Medicine. Carrier-free 73AsO43− was obtained from Los Alamos National Laboratories.

Plasmid DNA propagation, restriction enzyme treatment, ligation, and transformation were performed by minor modifications of published procedures (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was isolated with QIAGEN Plasmid kit (QIAGEN) for sequence analysis by the method of Sanger et al. (18Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Altered Sites™ II in vitro Mutagenesis System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's directions. All mutations introduced were confirmed by sequencing using a Cy5-labeled sequencing kit and ALFexpress system from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Plasmid pBC101 was digested with EcoRI and KpnI, and a 2.9-kilobase fragment containing arsB was cloned into vector plasmid pALTER-1 (Promega), yielding plasmid pAM-EK. The BamHI site in the arsA gene in pAM-EK was inactivated by Klenow fragment treatment. The resulting plasmid pAMB1 was used for site-directed mutagenesis. Single-stranded DNA prepared from E. coli strain JM109 containing pAMB1 was used as a template. Multiround mutagenesis was done to introduce EcoRI and HindIII sites immediately after the arsA and arsB genes, respectively. The two mutagenic oligonucleotides used and the respective changes (underlined) introduced were as follows. To introduce an EcoRI site: 5′-GCT GGG TAA ATT A AT GAA TTC ACG TAG GGC AGC-3′; to introduce a HindIII site: 5′-CTG TCA CAT TGT AAT AAGCTT CTG ATA TGA GCA AC-3′. The resulting plasmid pAMB11 was digested with EcoRI and HindIII and religated to construct plasmid pAMBT1 that contains only arsB and its Shine-Dalgarno sequence. The EcoRI-HindIII fragment containing arsB was cloned into EcoRI-HindIII-digested vector plasmid pKK223-3 (Pharmacia), yielding plasmid pKMB1. Everted membrane vesicles were prepared essentially as described previously (19Ambudkar S.V. Zlotnick G.W. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6142-6146Google Scholar). Membrane vesicles were prepared fresh for transport assays; storage at −80°C resulted in loss of activity. Transport assays were performed at room temperature. Unless otherwise noted, the reaction mixture contained 5 mM NADH, 0.1 mM sodium 73AsO2−, and 0.9 mg of membrane protein in a final volume of 0.6 ml of a buffer consisting of 75 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 M K2SO4, 0.25 M sucrose, and 2.5 mM MgSO4. Unless otherwise noted, the reaction was initiated by addition of NADH. At intervals, 0.1-ml samples were withdrawn, filtered through nitrocellulose filters (0.22 μm pore size, Corning Costar), and washed with 5 ml of the same buffer. The filters were dried, and the radioactivity was quantified in a liquid scintillation counter. A blank value, obtained by filtering 0.1 ml of assay mixture without membrane vesicles, was subtracted from all points. To determine the initial rates, 30-s time points were used. Because production of ArsB-specific antibodies has not been successful, an alternate approach to detect production of ArsB was used in which the arsC gene was fused in frame to the 3′-OH end of arsB. To construct the arsBC fusion, the intergenic sequence between arsB and arsC was deleted using the unique-site elimination method of Deng and Nickoloff (20Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Google Scholar) using single-stranded DNA from plasmid pJHW101 (arsRDABC) (5Wu J. Tisa L.S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12570-12576Google Scholar) as template. The termination codon of arsB and the intergenic region between arsB and arsC were deleted using a primer with the sequence: 5′-ATA AAT AGT GAT GTT GCT CAT CAA TGT GAC AGA GAG ACG TAG CGC GAG CGC GGC CAG 3′. This primer also eliminated the BglI site near the 3′-OH end of arsB. A second primer, designed to delete the unique EcoRI site in plasmid pJHW101, had the sequence: 5′ AAC TTG GAGTTC CCC TGT AAT 3′. In both primers, the alteration eliminating the restriction site is underlined. Cells of E. coli strain BMH71-18mutS were transformed with the mutagenesis reaction mixture, and the cell suspension was inoculated into LB medium containing kanamycin and grown overnight. Plasmid DNA was prepared and digested by EcoRI, and the product was transformed into JM109. Plasmid DNA was prepared and screened for loss of the EcoRI and BglI sites. The arsBC fusion was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The resulting plasmid, pAO-BC, was used to clone the arsBC gene fusion into plasmid pKMB1. A Csp45I-HindIII fragment from plasmid pAO-BC was inserted into Csp45I-HindIII-digested pKMB1, yielding plasmid pKMO-BC. The ArsBC chimeras were detected by immunoblotting of membrane protein separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Membrane protein was suspended in SDS sample buffer and heated at 80°C for 10 min, following which the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 15% polyacrylamide gels (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (0.2 μm pore size, Schleicher & Schuell) overnight at 25 V and 4°C. Antisera raised against purified ArsC was used to detect the ArsBC chimera. Immunoblotting was performed utilizing an enhanced chemiluminescence assay (DuPont NEN) and exposed to x-ray film at room temperature, as described previously (22Dey S. Dou D. Tisa L.S. Rosen B.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 418-424Google Scholar). Protein content was determined by a micromodification of the procedure of Lowry et al. (23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. 73AsO2− was prepared by reduction of 73AsO43− (24Reay P.F. Asher C.J. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 78: 557-560Google Scholar). ATP-driven 73AsO2− transport has been measured in membrane vesicles from cells expressing the arsA and arsB genes from the native ars promoter. When the arsA gene was deleted from the R773 ars operon, the cells retained a low level resistance to arsenite (8Dey S. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 385-389Google Scholar), similar to that conferred by the chromosomal ars operon (15Carlin A. Shi W. Dey S. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 981-986Google Scholar), which also lacks an arsA gene (14Sofia H.J. Burland V. Daniels D.L. Plunkett G. Blattner F.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2576-2586Google Scholar). However, no arsenite transport was observed in membrane vesicles from cells expressing arsB from the ars promoter regardless of the source of energy (data not shown). Previous attempts to express the R773 arsB gene at increased levels have been unsuccessful. The reasons for this are obscure, but possible explanations include instability of the polycistronic mRNA (25Owolabi J.B. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2367-2371Google Scholar) and lethality of ArsB itself (26Dou D. Owolabi J.B. Dey S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25768-25775Google Scholar). In an attempt to increase expression, arsB was cloned behind the tac promoter of plasmid pKK223-3, producing plasmid pKMB1. This plasmid was transformed into three strains of E. coli in which the chromosomal ars operon had been disrupted: strains AW10, AW3110, and LE392ΔuncICΔars. However, only strain AW10 could be stably transformed, perhaps because, among the three strains, only AW10 contains a lacIq gene to control basal level of expression of arsB. Even in the absence of exogenously added IPTG, expression of arsB from pKMB1 produced low level arsenite resistance similar to that conferred by the chromosomal ars operon, and higher level resistance was observed when arsA was expressed in trans (Fig. 1). Although it is difficult to quantify the amount of ArsB due to the lack of a specific ArsB antiserum, relative amounts of ArsB produced from the ars promoter could be compared with those from the tac promoter in pKMB1. In both plasmids, the arsB gene was fused in frame to the downstream arsC gene, and the chimeras were detected with antiserum directed against ArsC (Fig. 2). The arsBC gene fusion produced arsenite resistance comparable to the wild type arsB gene (data not shown). In neither case could the ArsBC chimera be visualized by Coomassie staining of the gels. Even using very sensitive chemiluminescent methods, the ArsBC chimera produced from the ars promoter could not be detected (Fig. 2, lane 2). However, under control of the tac promoter, the ArsBC chimera could be detected immunologically (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4). ArsB was produced even in the absence of inducer, with a severalfold increase following IPTG induction. As shown above, phenotypic expresssion of arsenite resistance from the tac promoter likewise did not require induction (Fig. 1).Fig. 2ArsB expression from the ars and tac promoters. Cultures of E. coli strain AW10 bearing the indicated plasmids expressing the chimeric arsBC gene were grown as as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were induced for 2 h with either 0.1 mM sodium arsenite (lane 2) or 0.5 mM IPTG (lane 4). Membrane vesicles prepared from those cells were suspended in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 15% acrylamide gels followed by immunoblot analysis using anti-ArsC serum. Lanes 1-4 contained 10 μg of membrane protein; lane 5 contained 1 μg of purified ArsC. Cells had the following plasmids: pKK223-3 (vector) (lane 1), pAO-BC (ars operon with arsBC fusion under control of ars promoter induced) (lane 2), pKMO-BC (arsBC fusion under control of the tac promoter uninduced) (lane 3), and pKMO-BC (induced) (lane 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The results of the in vivo study of energetics of transport suggested that ArsB alone could catalyze arsenite extrusion coupled to electrochemical energy (8Dey S. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 385-389Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, 73AsO2− uptake was measured in everted membrane vesicles prepared from cells of E. coli strain AW10 bearing plasmid pKMB1. In these experiments, the cells were induced with IPTG to maximize expression of ArsB. The membrane vesicles exhibited time- and NADH-dependent 73AsO2− accumulation (Fig. 3). Membrane vesicles prepared from cells harboring vector plasmid pKK223-3 showed no transport. Transport required NADH oxidation, as shown by the complete inhibition by KCN. The uncoupler carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) completely reversed NADH-dependent 73AsO2− uptake (Fig. 3), as did the combination of valinomycin plus nigericin (Table II). These results clearly show that arsenite transport catalyzed by ArsB alone is coupled to the electrochemical proton gradient established by NADH respiration. In contrast, little transport was observed with ATP (Table II).Table II.Effect of permeant anions, weak base, and ionophores on 73AsO2− transport in everted membrane vesiclesAdditionInitial velocity of arsenite uptakeaArsenite uptake in everted membrane vesicles from cells expressing the arsB gene of plasmid pKMB1 was examined in a buffer consisting of 75 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 0.25 M sucrose, and 2.5 mM MgSO4 containing the indicated additions.Percentnmol/mg membrane protein/minExperiment I5 mM NADH + 0.05 M K2SO40.741005 mM NADH + 0.1 M KClO40.17235 mM NADH + 0.1 M KSCN0.11155 mM NADH + 0.05 M (NH4)2SO40.67915 mM NADH + 0.1 M NH4Cl0.3547Experiment IIbBuffer contained 0.05 M K2SO4.5 mM NADH + 10 μM valinomycin + 10 μM nigericin0.0455 mM ATP0.0795 mM ATP + 10 μM FCCP0.045pKK223-3 (vector) + 5 mM NADH0.034a Arsenite uptake in everted membrane vesicles from cells expressing the arsB gene of plasmid pKMB1 was examined in a buffer consisting of 75 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 0.25 M sucrose, and 2.5 mM MgSO4 containing the indicated additions.b Buffer contained 0.05 M K2SO4. Open table in a new tab The effect of permeant anions and a permeant weak base was examined (Table II). In these experiments, the vesicles were prepared in a sulfate-containing buffer. Under such conditions, the electrochemical gradient has been shown to be primarily in the form of a membrane potential, positive interior, with little or no pH gradient (27Perlin D.S. Kasamo K. Brooker R.J. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7884-7892Google Scholar). NH4+, which dissipates the remaining ΔpH, had a small effect on the initial rate of 73AsO2− accumulation. NH4Cl was more inhibitory, attributable to an effect of Cl− as a permeant anion. The effect of SCN− and ClO4−, anions even more permeant than Cl−, considerably reduced transport activity. The concentration dependence for arsenite exhibited saturation kinetics, with an apparent Km of 0.14 mM (Fig. 4). This is essentially identical with the apparent Km of 0.1 mM for the ArsA-ArsB pump (9Dey S. Dou D. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25442-25446Google Scholar), suggesting that the mechanism of transport by ArsB is independent of the source of energy. Transport activity was maximal at pH 7 and decreased between 7 and 9 (Fig. 5). The effects of oxyanions on 73AsO2− transport via ArsB was examined. Among the oxyanions tested, the sodium or potassium salts of 73AsO43−, PO43−, NO3−, NO2−, SO32−, and SeO32− had little effect on the arsenite transport (Table III), indicating that ArsB does not catalyze nonspecific anion movement.Table IIIEffect of oxyanions on NADH-dependent arsenite transport via ArsBAdditionInitial velocity of arsenite uptakePercentnmol/mg membrane protein/minNone0.8210010 mM Na2HAsO40.799610 mM K2HPO40.738910 mM KNO20.749010 mM KNO30.749010 mM Na2SO30.819910 mM K2SeO30.7591None0.811000.1 mM sodium potassium tartrate0.75930.1 mM potassium antimonyl tartrate3.524350.1 mM SbCl33.89480 Open table in a new tab In contrast, potassium antimonyl tartrate was found to stimulate 73AsO2− transport 4- to 5-fold. The effect was specific for Sb(III) salts; sodium potassium tartrate had no effect on 73AsO2− transport, and the same stimulation was observed with antimony trichloride, which would be expected to hydrate to an antimonite oxyanion. This stimulatory effect of antimonite was further investigated. ArsB was required for Sb(III)-stimulated 73AsO2− accumulation (Fig. 6). Transport required NADH oxidation in the presence and absence of antimonite, and in both cases FCCP inhibited. Thus, this effect appears to be a property of the ArsB-mediated transport system and not a nonspecific effect of Sb(III). The degree of stimulation required stoichiometric amounts of antimonite and arsenite (Fig. 7). Importantly, at each concentration of arsenite examined, the maximal stimulation occurred at an equimolar concentration of Sb(III) (Fig. 7).Fig. 7Relationship of stoichiometry of Sb(III) and As(III) on 73AsO2−1 uptake. The initial rate of arsenite uptake was determined in the presence of the indicated concentrations of sodium arsenite. Assays were performed with the following concentrations of potassium antimonyl tartrate: none (○), 0.05 mM (▴), 0.1 mM (♦), 0.5 mM (•), and 1 mM (▪).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The solution chemistry of arsenicals and antimonials is not well characterized. In solution it might be expected that the arsenite oxyanion (AsO2−) would be hydrated to As(OH)2O−, which is in equilibrium with the protonated form As(OH)3. However, other reasonable forms could be suggested, such as −O(HO)-As-O-As-(OH)O−, or, when arsenite and antimonite are added together, a mixed salt such as −O(HO)-As-O-Sb-(OH)O− might be formed. If antimonial oxyanions were better substrates for the transport system than arsenicals, such mixed salts could explain the substantial stimulation of 73As(III) uptake by Sb(III). In both transcriptional regulation by ArsR and allosteric regulation by ArsA, Sb(III) is more effective than As(III). Thus, it would not be surprising if antimonials were a better substrate for ArsB than arsenicals. Alternatively, an allosteric effect of Sb(III) on the carrier itself cannot be ruled out. Sb(III) allosterically activates the ArsA ATPase, but it does so by binding to a triad of cysteine thiolates (4Bhattacharjee H. Li J. Ksenzenko M.K. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11245-11250Google Scholar), while there are no essential thiols in ArsB (28Chen Y. Dey S. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 911-913Google Scholar). Further arguing against an allosteric effect is the fact that maximal stimulation requires stoichiometric amounts of As(III) and Sb(III) at all concentrations of As(III). These results suggest that a mixed salt containing both As(III) and Sb(III) can be transported by the carrier. From the results of previous in vivo and in vitro studies, we concluded that the arsA and arsB gene products of the R773 ars operon form a membrane-bound complex that functions as an obligatorily ATP-coupled arsenite pump. First, arsenical extrusion from cells of E. coli exhibited dependence on chemical energy; electrochemical energy was neither necessary nor sufficient (6Mobley H.L.T. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6119-6122Google Scholar, 7Rosen B.P. Borbolla M.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 124: 760-765Google Scholar). Although the form of chemical energy could not be unambiguously identified from those physiological studies, there was a correlation between ATP levels and extrusion. Second, the transport system was shown to be a complex of two subunits, ArsA and ArsB (22Dey S. Dou D. Tisa L.S. Rosen B.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 418-424Google Scholar), where ArsA is an As(III)/Sb(III)-stimulated ATPase. Third, everted membrane vesicles containing the ArsA-ArsB complex exhibited energy-dependent accumulation of 73AsO2− (9Dey S. Dou D. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25442-25446Google Scholar). In vitro transport had an absolute requirement for ATP. Again, electrochemical energy was neither necessary nor sufficient. In these cells, the H+-translocating F0F1 ATPase was deleted, so coupling of the ArsA-ArsB complex to ATP hydrolysis was direct. However, as described above, several findings posed a question with respect to the energy coupling of the Ars system. Most intriguing was the observation that three of five ars operons lack an arsA gene. Only the operons from E. coli plasmids R773 (10Chen C.-M. Misra T. Silver S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15030-15038Google Scholar) and R46 (11Bruhn D.F. Li J. Silver S. Roberto F. Rosen B.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 139: 149-153Google Scholar) have arsA genes. The two staphylococcal (12Ji G. Silver S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3684-3694Google Scholar, 13Rosenstein R. Peschel P. Wieland B. Götz F. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3676-3683Google Scholar) and the E. coli chromosomal (14Sofia H.J. Burland V. Daniels D.L. Plunkett G. Blattner F.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2576-2586Google Scholar) operons do not. Obviously it would be difficult to have an ATP-coupled pump without an ATPase subunit. One possibility is that the two types of extrusion systems have different biochemical mechanisms. The close similarity of the R773, R46, and E. coli chromosomal ArsB proteins (each exhibits over 90% similarity to the other two) would suggest that the proteins should have a common mechanism. Even the ArsBs from the staphylococcal plasmids, which are less than 60% similar to the proteins from the E. coli proteins, have essentially superimposable hydropathic profiles, suggesting similar membrane topology (29Dou D. Dey S. Rosen B.P. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1994; 65: 359-368Google Scholar). Indeed, chimeras of the ArsB proteins from the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria constructed by gene fusions of the arsB genes are functional (29Dou D. Dey S. Rosen B.P. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1994; 65: 359-368Google Scholar). A reasonable deduction is that all ArsBs have the same biochemical mechanism. Do ArsBs function as components of primary pumps, as the in vivo energetics studies indicate (6Mobley H.L.T. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6119-6122Google Scholar, 7Rosen B.P. Borbolla M.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 124: 760-765Google Scholar)? Are they secondary carriers, as suggested by their transmembrane topology (5Wu J. Tisa L.S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12570-12576Google Scholar, 28Chen Y. Dey S. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 911-913Google Scholar)? These possibilities are not mutually exclusive. Indeed, results of in vivo transport studies suggested that the ArsB protein mediates the electrochemical energy-dependent arsenite efflux in the absence of the ArsA protein while the ArsA-ArsB complex catalyzes chemical energy-dependent transport (8Dey S. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 385-389Google Scholar). The pI258-encoded ArsB similarly had been proposed to utilize electrochemical energy (30Bröer S. Ji G. Bröer A. Silver S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3480-3485Google Scholar). The results in this study clearly demonstrate that ArsB functions as a secondary arsenite transporter under conditions where there is only Δψ (27Perlin D.S. Kasamo K. Brooker R.J. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7884-7892Google Scholar), consistent with the carrier catalyzing electrophoretic anion movement coupled to the membrane potential. The fact that some ars operons have both arsA and arsB genes and thus encode pumps, while others have only the arsB gene and encode secondary systems suggests that the acquisition of a gene for a catalytic subunit might be a recent evolutionary event. Independence from electrochemical gradients would make the cell less susceptible to depolarizing environmental poisons. Therefore, the Ars system is a novel transport system that physiologically has two possible modes of energy coupling depending on its subunit composition (Fig. 8). We thank Dr. T. H. Wilson for plasmid pKK223-3 and Dr. T. B. Gladysheva for purified ArsC."

Furthermore, depletion of p27 from astrocyte extracts lowered the amount of cyclin E required for CDK2 activation.

Glial cell development is marked by cell proliferation, growth arrest, cellular specialization, and programmed cell death (1Barres B. Hart I. Coles H. Burne J. Voyvodic J. Richardson W. Raff M. Cell. 1992; 70: 31-46Google Scholar, 2Raff M.C. Nature. 1989; 243: 1450-1455Google Scholar). The mechanisms that dictate glial cell differentiation and survival depend upon signal transduction events that are intrinsic to each cell type and are derived from extracellular growth factor signals (3Barres B.A. Schmid R. Sendnter M. Raff M.C. Development. 1993; 118: 283-295Google Scholar). A major challenge has been to explain how similar intracellular molecules are activated to give diverse and opposing biological responses. A crucial regulatory mechanism to ensure appropriate cell differentiation involves the decision whether to proceed through the cell cycle or to undergo cell cycle arrest during the G1 phase (4Sherr C. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Google Scholar). A useful model for studying glial cell development has been the O-2A 1The abbreviations used are: O-2Aoligodendrocyte type 2 astrocyte precursorCG-4central glia-4CDKcyclin-dependent kinaseBrdUrd5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridineDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPBSphosphate-buffered salinePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. bipotential progenitor cell, which possesses the capability of differentiating into either type 2 astrocytes or oligodendrocytes (5Raff M.C.

To address cell cycle components that may influence glial cell development, a bipotential oligodendrocyte precursor cell line, CG-4, has been utilized as a model system. This cell line was established from primary cultures of postnatal rat oligodendrocytes and resembles O-2A progenitor cells (6Louis J. Magal E. Muir D. Manthorpe M. Varon S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 193-204Google Scholar, 7Tontsch U. Archer D. DuBois-Dalcq M. Duncan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11616-11619Google Scholar). Growth in conditioned media derived from the B104 neuroblastoma line promotes proliferation of CG-4 cells. Upon withdrawal of B104 conditioned media, CG4 cells stop dividing and differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes. Interestingly, treatment of CG-4 cells with high levels of serum results in differentiation to type 2 astrocytes in vitro. We have focused upon changes in the late G1 phase of the cell cycle that accompany CG-4 cell differentiation. The results indicate that increases in the level of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 can block activity of cyclin E-CDK2 complexes when CG-4 cells are induced to differentiate into astrocytes. These findings suggest that glial cell growth arrest and differentiation may be regulated by specific cell cycle inhibitors, working on key cyclin-CDK complexes during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Antibodies against CDK2, CDK4, CDK5, CDK6, cyclin E, cyclin A, and cyclin D3 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

Cells were passed every 5 days and plated on polyornithine-coated dishes at a density of 100 cells/mm2. To induce differentiation into astrocytes, CG-4 cultures were exposed 24 h after passage to DMEM supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 20% fetal calf serum. To induce differentiation into oligodendrocytes, cultures were first washed with Hanks' salt solution and then incubated with DMEM containing N1 supplement, 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 5 μg/ml insulin. Cells were fixed for 10 min at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) and then blocked in normal serum for 1 h at room temperature. Incubation in primary antibody was carried out overnight at 4°C at the following dilutions: 1:1 in PBS for anti-galactocerebroside and A2B5 staining; 1:2000 in PBS + 0.3% Triton X-100 + 3% normal goat serum for glial fibrillary acidic protein (Dako) staining; and 1:1000 in PBS + 0.3% Triton X-100 + 3% normal horse serum for myelin basic protein (Boehringer Mannheim) staining. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature in secondary antibody solution (1:500 in PBS), cells were stained using Vectastain Elite ABC according to the manufacturer's instructions and visualized using diaminobenzidine as substrate. Cells were given a 5-h pulse with 10 μM BrdUrd and then fixed in ice-cold acetone:methanol (1:1). After 30 min in 1 N HCl, cells were incubated in anti-BrdUrd; antibody (Dako; 1:100) in PBS + 0.3% Tween 20 + 3% horse serum at 4°C overnight. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature in secondary antibody solution (1:500 in PBS), cells were stained using Vectastain Elite ABC according to the manufacturer's instructions and visualized using diaminobenzidine as substrate. Cells were detached from culture plates by scraping and then collected in Hanks' salt solution. Cells were washed in PBS and then resuspended in HKM buffer (30 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 7.5 mM MgCl2), 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg of leupeptin, and 3.5 μg/ml aprotinin. Cells were lysed by sonication and centrifuged to separate the cell pellet. Protein extracts were adjusted to 0.1 N NaCl and then stored at −70°C. Protein extracts (20-100 μg/lane) were analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Protein was transferred from the gel to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane by a transfer apparatus at 34 V for 6 h. The membrane was then blocked with 5% nonfat milk (Carnation) and incubated with primary antibody against cyclin, CDK, or inhibitor. After incubating with an anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Boehringer Mannheim), protein was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Corp.). Protein extracts were obtained from precursor CG-4 cells, oligodendrocytes, or astrocytes by sonication as above. These extracts (40 μg/sample) were incubated for 30 min at 37°C in the presence of assembly buffer containing 30 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 7 mM MgCl2 (10Koff A. Ohtsuki M. Polyak K. Roberts J.M. Massague J. Science. 1993; 260: 536-539Google Scholar), and (depending on the experiment) with the addition of exogenous recombinant cyclin E, CDK2, or cyclin E-CDK2 complex. Addition of physiologic levels of exogenous recombinant cyclin E during the assembly reaction allowed better detection of the kinase reaction without changing the intrinsic activity of the protein extracts (10Koff A. Ohtsuki M. Polyak K. Roberts J.M. Massague J. Science. 1993; 260: 536-539Google Scholar). Addition of supraphysiologic levels of cyclin or CDK2 was performed during the assembly reaction in certain experiments in an attempt to overcome inhibition of CDK2 activity. Physiological levels of cyclin E and CDK2 were determined by immunoblotting CG-4 precursor extracts against varying amounts of recombinant cyclin E or CDK2 obtained from SF9 insect cell lysates overexpressing these proteins (11Polyak K. Kato J. Solomon M.J. Sherr C.J. Massague J. Roberts J.M. Koff A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 9-22Google Scholar). The assembled extracts were then subject to immunoprecipitation in 0.5% Nonidet P-40-radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 250 mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mM EDTA) for 1 h at 4°C in the presence of antibody against CDK2 followed by a 1-h incubation with immobilized protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc). The beads were then washed twice with Nonidet P-40-radioimmune precipitation buffer and four times with kinase assay buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 7.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol). Phosphorylation of histone H1 kinase was performed by incubating these beads in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont NEN), 30 μM lithium ATP (Boehringer Mannheim), and 1 μg of histone H1 (Boehringer Mannheim) at 37°C for 30 min. After incubation, the samples were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and then resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and subject to autoradiography. Radiolabeled histone H1 bands were then quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and associated ImageQuant software. Saturating levels of antibody to p27kip1 (20 μl) or a control antibody (against the Fas antigen) was adsorbed to protein A-Sepharose at 4°C for 20 min. Protein extract (500 μg) from astrocytes was then added and the mixture allowed to incubate for 30 min. The supernatants were removed and then incubated a second time to freshly prepared antibody-protein A-Sepharose beads. These resulting supernatants, cleared of p27 protein, were then utilized for Western blotting and kinase assays. Immunoprecipitation with CDK2 antibody, followed by histone H1 kinase assays, was performed on astrocyte extracts. Astrocyte extracts (300 μg) were immunoprecipitated with CDK2 antibody (20 μl) and then washed with Nonidet P-40-radioimmune precipitation buffer + 1 N NaCl solution. To the resulting immunoprecipitates was added exogenous cyclin E at 0, 1, and 3 times physiologic levels, or exogenous cyclin D2 (as a control). This mixture was incubated in the presence of an assembly buffer (see above) for 30 min at 37°C and then washed with Nonidet P-40-radioimmune precipitation buffer followed by kinase assay buffer. A histone H1 kinase reaction was then performed as above. In culture, O-2A progenitor cells differentiate into either oligodendrocytes or astrocytes, suggesting that these cell lineages arise from a common precursor (5Raff M.C. Miller R.H. Noble M. Nature. 1983; 303: 390-396Google Scholar). To characterize these lineage-specific events on a biochemical level, we chose a cell line that mimics primary cultures of O-2A cells. CG-4 cells, which spontaneously arose in O-2A cultures, are capable of expansion in culture (6Louis J. Magal E. Muir D. Manthorpe M. Varon S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 193-204Google Scholar). CG-4 cells can be maintained in an undifferentiated state in the presence of DMEM supplemented with either B104 conditioned medium or with the mitogens basic fibroblast growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor. Under these conditions more than 95% of the cells remain in the cell cycle and express the antigen A2B5 (6Louis J. Magal E. Muir D. Manthorpe M. Varon S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 193-204Google Scholar). The ability to propagate CG-4 cells allows for the generation of large numbers of cells for protein analysis. Withdrawal of conditioned medium or addition of serum resulted in terminal exit from the cell cycle and assumption of differentiated phenotypes. In the absence of serum, most CG-4 cells withdraw from the cell cycle and express oligodendrocyte markers such as galactocerebroside (Fig. 1), and myelin basic protein and lose A2B5 reactivity. In the presence of serum, greater than 95% of the CG-4 cells withdraw from the cell cycle and express the astrocyte-specific marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (Fig. 1) and also the A2B5 antigen. Furthermore, the morphology of each cell type is markedly different. CG-4 cells are typically bipolar in shape, whereas oligodendrocytes express a very branched morphology. Astrocytes are flatter in shape and display fibrous processes. These distinct phenotypes were another indication of differentiation of these cell types. In later passages of CG-4 cells, we have observed that CG-4 cell differentiation along the oligodendrocyte lineage was compromised. The extent of oligodendrocyte differentiation varied between 40 and 80%. Astrocyte differentiation was unaffected. To determine if withdrawal from the cell cycle was affected in later passages, we determined the incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine in cultures of cells grown for 4 days in differentiation medium. Whereas BrdUrd incorporation in astrocyte cultures was reduced more than 20-fold compared with precursor cells, only a 2-fold change was observed in late passage oligodendrocyte cultures (Table I). Therefore, in this culture system astrocyte differentiation was correlated tightly with withdrawal of the cell cycle as measured by BrdUrd incorporation, whereas oligodendrocyte differentiation displayed more variability depending upon passage number. These observations suggest the CG-4 cells may represent a useful model system to explore the biochemical basis during glial cell differentiation into astrocytes.Table IFraction of cells incorporating bromodeoxyuridineAverageS.D.Oligodendrocytes0.420.06Astrocytes0.030.02Precursors0.750.1 Open table in a new tab The ability to proceed along different differentiation pathways in the presence or absence of serum suggested that the status of cell cycle regulatory molecules might play an important role in cell fate determination. To explore this possibility, we examined the expression of both the positive regulators of cell cycle transitions, the cyclin and CDK proteins, and the negative regulators, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, as CG-4 cells withdrew from the cell cycle along different differentiation pathways. Protein extracts were isolated from proliferating CG-4 cells, oligodendrocytes, or astrocytes and subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies specific for cyclins and CDK proteins. We focused upon the proteins involved in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. CG-4 cells were found to express all three D-type cyclins, both major forms of cyclin E, and cyclin A. Furthermore, these cells express CDK4 and CDK2, the catalytic subunits of the G1 cyclins (Fig. 2). In addition, exponentially growing CG-4 cells contain small amounts of the cell cycle inhibitor proteins p21waf1/cip1 and p27kip1 (Fig. 2, Table II). The expression of other CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitor proteins, such as p16INK4A, was not reliably detected in these cells.Table IIModulation of the cell cycle proteins in CG-4 cellsPrecursorsOligodendrocytesAstrocytesCyclin D1+++Cyclin D2+++++++Cyclin D3++++Cyclin E+++++Cyclin A+++++++++CDK2+++++++++++CDK4+++++CDK5++++++CDK6−−−p21waf+++p27kip+++++ Open table in a new tab After 4 days in differentiation conditions, the expression of these cell cycle proteins was examined in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. An example of results from CG-4 precursor cells compared to extracts isolated from differentiated oligodendrocytes and astrocytes is shown in Fig. 2. Little change in the amounts of cyclin D1, cyclin D2, cyclin D3, cyclin E, and p21 was observed in oligodendrocyte or astrocyte cultures. In contrast, there was a slight induction of CDK5 protein and a reduction in the amount of CDK2 and CDK4 proteins. An increase in the amount of cyclin A was detected in astrocytes and there was no change in oligodendrocyte cultures. Intriguingly, we observed cell-specific alteration in the steady state levels of p27 protein (Fig. 2). In astrocytes derived from CG-4 cells under conditions of high serum, the amount of p27 was greatly increased. In contrast, there was little change in the amount of p27 in oligodendrocytes derived from CG-4 cells under serum-free conditions. A time course of astrocyte cell differentiation indicated that along with the increase in p27, a decrease in the amount of CDK2 protein was observed (Fig. 3). Similar changes in the amount of CDK2 were observed in oligodendrocytes. No significant changes in cyclin E were detected. These data imply that increased levels of p27 might antagonize the growth-promoting effect of serum by acting as an inhibitor of CDK2 and CDK4 at the same time that CDK2 protein levels were found to decrease. Furthermore, these results suggest that p27 might be involved in the determination process of glial cell differentiation. The activity of cyclin E-CDK2 is maximal at the G1/S transition and is a target of the machinery that leads to cell cycle arrest. Therefore, we determined if p27 directly mediated the inactivation of CDK2 to permit differentiation along the astrocyte lineage. To measure CDK2 activity in extracts prepared from either astrocyte or oligodendrocyte cultures, we used histone H1 as a substrate. We detected approximately equal amounts of cyclin E and CDK2 in both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (see Fig. 2). Strikingly, CDK2 activity was absent in astrocyte extracts. The loss of CDK2 activity might be due to intrinsic modifications of CDK2 that make it refractory to activation or to the presence of p27, which would block the activation of cyclin E-CDK2 complexes. To determine if the CDK2 protein was refractory to activation, we immunoprecipitated CDK2 from the extracts and added recombinant cyclin E (and CDK activating kinase) to the immunoprecipitates. After a suitable interval allowing complex formation, we washed out the proteins not interacting with CDK2 and assayed the immunoprecipitates for histone H1 kinase activity. We found that CDK2 activity from astrocytes could be induced, suggesting that inhibition was not due to intrinsic changes in the CDK2 protein (data not shown). To determine if a titratable inhibitor blocked CDK2 activation, we added increasing amounts of recombinant cyclin E into extracts and measured immunoprecipitable CDK2 activity. Addition of cyclin E to oligodendrocyte extracts resulted in the induction of endogenous CDK2 activity (Fig. 4). This suggests that oligodendrocytes are fully competent to assemble and activate CDK2. Thus, the partial withdrawal of these cells from the mitotic cycle may not be due solely to inhibition of CDK2 activity. In contrast, the addition of cyclin E to extracts derived from astrocytes was not capable of activating the endogenous CDK2 protein (Fig. 4). A 16-fold molar excess of recombinant cyclin E (compared to the level of endogenous cyclin E) was inefficient in activating CDK2. This suggests that during differentiation along the astrocyte pathway CDK2 is actively inhibited, presumably through the induction and action of p27. The p27 protein acts as a potent inhibitor of cyclin-CDK complexes but does not interact efficiently with either cyclins or CDKs alone (11Polyak K. Kato J. Solomon M.J. Sherr C.J. Massague J. Roberts J.M. Koff A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 9-22Google Scholar, 12Reynisdottir I. Polyak K. Iavarone A. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1831-1845Google Scholar). Consequently, the inability of cyclin E to activate CDK2 in astrocytes might be explained by the decrease in the total amount of CDK2. In these extracts, CDK2 might be limiting so that only some of the cyclin E is bound to CDK2 (cyclin E is in excess). These cyclin E-CDK2 complexes would be subject to p27 binding and inhibition. In this model the amount of p27 present in these extracts will be sufficient to inhibit all CDK2 enzyme that is capable of forming complexes with the cyclins. In order to test the relative levels and effects of cyclin E-CDK2 and p27 proteins, we titrated increasing amounts of recombinant CDK2 with cyclin E into astrocyte extracts and measured histone H1 kinase activity. Mixing recombinant cyclin E and CDK2 in the absence of astrocyte extracts allowed the assembly and activation of CDK2 activity due to CDK activating kinase activities in the SF9 lysates (Fig. 5A). Increasing the amount of CDK2 leads to a marked increase in the amount of cyclin E-dependent kinase activity (Fig. 5A). A plateau of activity was eventually reached beyond which the addition of CDK2 had no more effect because the amount of cyclin E became limiting. Addition of increasing amounts of astrocyte extract to a fixed amount of cyclin E-CDK2 complex decreased the amount of CDK2 activity (Fig. 5B), verifying the presence of an inhibitory activity in astrocyte extracts. Taken together, these results confirm that astrocytes derived from CG-4 cells contain an inhibitory activity that blocks cyclin E-CDK2 complexes. Since p27 is the most obvious cell cycle component that is increased during astrocytic differentiation, it is a candidate for the cyclin E-CDK2 inhibitory factor. To determine whether p27 was responsible for the inhibition of CDK2 in astrocyte extracts, we depleted p27 from these extracts by immunoprecipitation and measured the ability of recombinant cyclin E to activate the endogenous CDK2 in the depleted lysates. Depletion of p27 was confirmed by immunoblot of lysates from astrocyte extracts treated with anti-p27 antibodies (Fig. 6C). Immunoprecipitation of p27 resulted in a 3-fold increase in the ability of recombinant cyclin E to activate CDK2 in a histone H1 phosphorylation assay (Fig. 6, A and B). Control depletions with an antibody against the Fas antigen did not affect the degree of inhibition. This experiment indicates that p27 acts as an inhibitor of the CDK2 during astrocyte differentiation from CG-4 cells. Glial progenitor cells such as O-2A proliferate in vivo at the time of birth and give rise to postmitotic oligodendrocytes over a period of several weeks. In vitro, O-2A cells stop dividing and differentiate into oligodendrocytes in serum-free medium, whereas differentiation into type 2 astrocytes depends upon extracellular signals such as ciliary neurotrophin factor or serum (13Lillien L.E. Raff M.C. Neuron. 1990; 5: 111-119Google Scholar). In both cases oligodendrocytes and type 2 astrocytes are postmitotic (14Lillien L.E. Raff M.C. Neuron. 1990; 4: 525-534Google Scholar). It has been postulated that proliferating O-2A cells possess an intrinsic program in which a limited number of cell divisions takes place before differentiation is initiated. Such a clock mechanism is supported by single cell culture experiments of oligodendrocytes (15Temple S. Raff M.C. Nature. 1985; 313: 223-225Google Scholar); however, the contribution of cell cycle components to this differentiation pathway has not been fully defined. In this study we used CG-4 cells, a clonal glial cell line with characteristics of O2-A progenitor cells (6Louis J. Magal E. Muir D. Manthorpe M. Varon S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 193-204Google Scholar). CG-4 cells, like O-2A cells, are capable of giving rise to oligodendrocytes and type 2 astrocytes, depending upon culture conditions, and are capable of myelination in vivo after implantation in the central nervous system (7Tontsch U. Archer D. DuBois-Dalcq M. Duncan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11616-11619Google Scholar). The results reported here indicate that G1 cyclins and their associated catalytic subunits, CDKs, are expressed by CG-4 cells. These cells display abundant cyclin E-dependent CDK2 activity. However, upon differentiation into astrocytes, this activity is blocked by increasing levels of p27kip1 inhibitor protein. Interestingly, CDK2 activity measured in oligodendrocytes derived from CG-4 cells was not affected upon differentiation, consistent with only a modest decline in BrdUrd incorporation (Table I). The differential behavior of CDK2 enzymatic activity between oligodendrocytes and astrocytes produced from CG-4 cells might be a critical difference during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. We cannot evaluate at this time the contribution of p27 and CDK2 upon oligodendrocyte growth arrest due to the variability in CG-4 cell differentiation. The mechanism that accounts for oligodendrocyte growth arrest is not known but could involve members of other inhibitory proteins, the activity of the CDK activating kinase, or target a completely different G1-CDK complex (16Fisher R. Morgan D. Cell. 1994; 78: 713-724Google Scholar). CDK inhibitors such as p27 negatively regulate G1 phase progression by acting on cyclin D-CDK4 complexes and cyclin E-CDK2 complexes. The binding of p27 appears to be stoichiometric and acts to prevent threonine phosphorylation of cyclin E-CDK complexes (10Koff A. Ohtsuki M. Polyak K. Roberts J.M. Massague J. Science. 1993; 260: 536-539Google Scholar) by CDK activating kinase. The effect of p27 upon the activity of cyclin E-CDK2 complexes in CG-4 astrocytes is consistent with the general mechanism of cell cycle arrest induced by cell-cell contact and transforming growth factor-β treatment of epithelial cells (11Polyak K. Kato J. Solomon M.J. Sherr C.J. Massague J. Roberts J.M. Koff A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 9-22Google Scholar). The amount of CDK4 associated with p27 in astrocytes is reduced in CG-4 cells. 2R. Tikoo, P. Casaccia-Bonnefil, M. V. Chao, and A. Koff, unpublished results. The level of CDK2 also decreased as differentiation proceeded. CDK2 binding to cyclin E and its activation by positive and negative phosphorylation events do not appear to be influenced by the transition of CG-4 cells to astrocytes. The decrease in CDK2 was strikingly accompanied by the accumulation of p27 in astrocytes. Removal of p27 from astrocyte lysates resulted in a demonstrable increase in CDK2 activity, indicating that the presence of p27 has a direct effect upon the late G1 cell cycle activities of cyclin E-CDK2. As has been found for cells grown in primary culture, CG-4 astrocytic differentiation depends upon extracellular signals, whereas oligodendrocyte differentiation depends upon an intrinsic program. However, although astrocyte growth arrest could be easily achieved using CG-4 cells, a large percentage of oligodendrocytes did not withdraw from the cell cycle arrest under continuous culture conditions. Hence, the exact mechanisms of oligodendrocyte growth arrest are unclear. More experimentation into the cell cycle controls in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes from primary culture is needed. In addition, the use of cells derived from transgenic animals lacking the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and the introduction of p27 in precursor cells will clarify the signals that dictate glial cell growth arrest and differentiation.

Proteinase K had access to either the cytoplasmic part of the protein or to both sides of the membrane. Fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflection spectroscopy indicated that membrane-associated domain of the protein represented about 55% of the native protein, meanwhile the cytoplasmic part represented only 27% of the protein. The secondary structure of the ATPase and of its membrane-associated domains was investigated by infrared spectroscopy. The secondary structure of the membrane-associated structures and of the entire protein was quite similar (α-helices, 35%; β-sheets, 35%; turns, 20%; random, 15%). These data were in agreement with 10 α-helical transmembrane segments but suggested a participation of β-sheet structures in the membrane-associated part of the protein. Polarized infrared spectroscopy indicated that the α-helices were oriented nearly perpendicular to the membrane plane. No preferential orientation could be attributed to the β-sheets. Monitoring the amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange kinetics demonstrated that the membrane associated part of the ATPase molecule is characterized by a relatively high accessibility to the solvent, quite different from that observed for bacteriorhodopsin membrane segments. Membrane topology of the H+,K+-ATPase has been studied after proteolytic degradation of the protein by proteinase K. Proteinase K had access to either the cytoplasmic part of the protein or to both sides of the membrane. Fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflection spectroscopy indicated that membrane-associated domain of the protein represented about 55% of the native protein, meanwhile the cytoplasmic part represented only 27% of the protein. The secondary structure of the ATPase and of its membrane-associated domains was investigated by infrared spectroscopy. The secondary structure of the membrane-associated structures and of the entire protein was quite similar (α-helices, 35%; β-sheets, 35%; turns, 20%; random, 15%).

However, as yet there is no direct biochemical evidence for a Gβγ protein complex associated with the plasma membrane. We found that the products of the STE4 and STE18 genes are stably associated with plasma membrane as well as with internal membranes and that 30% of the protein pool is not tightly associated with either membrane fraction. A slower-migrating, presumably phosphorylated, form of Ste4p is enriched in the non-membrane fraction. The Ste4p and Ste18p proteins that had been extracted from plasma membranes with detergent were found to cosediment as an 8 S particle under low salt conditions and as a 6 S particle in the presence of 0.25 M NaCl; the Ste18p in these fractions was precipitated with anti-Ste4p antiserum. Under the conditions of our assay, Gpa1p was not associated with either particle. The levels of Ste4p and Ste18p accumulation in mutant cells provided additional evidence for a Gβγ complex. Ste18p failed to accumulate in ste4 mutant cells, and Ste4p showed reduced levels of accumulation and an increased rate of turnover in ste18 mutant cells. The gpa1 mutant blocked stable association of Ste4p with the plasma membrane, and the ste18 mutant blocked stable association of Ste4p with both plasma membranes and internal membranes. The membrane distribution of Ste4p was unaffected by the ste2 mutation or by down-regulation of the cell-surface receptors.

Heat stress induced the production of a certain glycolipid in the myxoamoebae of Physarum polycephalum in a few minutes. The purified glycolipid was determined to be a poriferasterol monoglucoside by structural studies that was previously reported to be expressed during the differentiation of Physarum cells from haploid myxoamoebae to diploid plasmodia (Murakami-Murofushi, K., Nakamura, K., Ohta, J., Suzuki, M., Suzuki, A., Murofushi, H., and Yokota, T. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 16719-16723). The activity of UDP-glucose:poriferasterol glucosyltransferase (Murakami-Murofushi, K., and Ohta, J. (1989) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 992, 412-415) was also expressed rapidly after heat shock. Thus, the activation of sterol glucosyltransferase and the production of sterol-glucoside were considered to be important events that were involved in the signal transduction system to induce some succeeding heat-shock responses, such as the synthesis of heat-shock proteins.

Thus, the activation of sterol glucosyltransferase and the production of sterol-glucoside were considered to be important events that were involved in the signal transduction system to induce some succeeding heat-shock responses, such as the synthesis of heat-shock proteins. In response to environmental stresses, living organisms acquired the capability of recognizing such stresses and adapting themselves to various types of stress during evolution. They induce some proteins, so-called stress proteins or heat-shock proteins, to protect themselves from conditions unfavorable for their survival. Under stress conditions such as heat shock, starvation, high salt, and high osmotic pressure, haploid myxoamoebae of a true slime mold, Physarum polycephalum, retracted their pseudopodia and changed shape into a disk-like form, then they constructed cell walls to form their dormant form, microcysts. These morphological changes were associated with changes in the intracellular distribution of actin filaments. Synthesis of a novel stress protein, p66, was induced within 15 min after heat shock. Because this protein coprecipitated with polymerized actin in vitro and colocalized with short bundles of actin filaments in vivo, it may have participated in the change of actin distribution associated with heat-inducible microcyst formation. However, p66 was not induced when diploid plasmodia of Physarum were exposed to heat shock, so this protein is considered to be specifically expressed during microcyst formation in the haploid stage of Physarum (3Shimada Y. Kasakura T. Yokota M. Miyata Y. Murofushi H. Sakai H. Yahara I. Murakami-Murofushi K. Cell Struct. Funct. 1992; 17: 301-309Google Scholar). The structure of the p66 gene, the biological functions of p66, and the regulation of actin-p66 binding are now being investigated in our laboratory. In many organisms, the induction and properties of heat-shock proteins have been investigated in detail (4Schlesinger M.J. Ashburner M. Tissieres A. Heat Shock from Bacteria to Man. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar, 5Lindquist S. Craig E.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 631-677Google Scholar), and many investigators are now working on this subject. However, very early events after heat shock have not yet been clarified. Because the plasma membrane may receive a heat shock first and then the signal may be transduced into the cell, we studied the change of membrane lipids after heat shock and demonstrated a rapid induction of a certain glycolipid and its synthesizing enzyme in myxoamoebae of P. polycephalum. Myxoamoebae of a true slime mold, P. polycephalum, were grown on a lawn of bacteria, Aerobacter aerogenes, in a nutrient agar medium in the dark at 24°C (6Murakami-Murofushi K. Hiratsuka A. Ohta J. Cell Struct. Funct. 1984; 9: 311-315Google Scholar). For heat shock, they were incubated at 40°C. Sephadex A-25 was obtained from Pharmacia Fine Chemicals. Silica gel 60 thin layer chromatography (TLC) 1The abbreviations used are: TLCthin layer chromatographyGLCgas-liquid chromatography. plates and high-performance TLC plates of silica gel 60 were from Merck, and 3% OV-101 on Shimalite W (80-100 mesh) was from Shimadzu (Kyoto, Japan).

Egg phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, ergosterol, stigmasterol, campesterol, sitosterol, and α- and β-glucosidase were purchased from Sigma, and poriferasterol was isolated from plasmodia of P. polycephalum as described previously (7Murakami-Murofushi K.

Poriferasterol monoglucoside, which is present in the plasma membrane of Physarum plasmodia, was purified as reported previously (8Mimura K. Murakami-Murofushi K. Ohta J. Nat. Sci. Rep. Ochanomizu Univ. 1991; 42: 49-56Google Scholar). thin layer chromatography gas-liquid chromatography. Extraction and purification of an expressed glycolipid was performed essentially according to the procedure described previously by a combination of gel filtration by Sephadex A-25 and preparative TLC using silica gel 60 plates in solvent system I and II (I, chloroform:methanol:water (60:40:9, v/v); II, chloroform:methanol:acetone:acetic acid:water (10:2:4:2:1, v/v)) (1Murakami-Murofushi K. Nakamura K. Ohta J. Suzuki M. Suzuki A. Murofushi H. Yokota T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16719-16723Google Scholar). Lipids were analyzed by TLC in solvent system I and II, and glycolipids were visualized by spraying with 2% orcinol in 2 N H2SO4 followed by heating at 125°C. Other color-developing reagents, such as resorcinol-HCl for sialic acid, azure A-H2SO4 for sulfolipids, ninhydrin for amino acids, 0.05% ferric chloride in 5% each of acetic acid and sulfuric acid for sterols, and molybdenum blue reagent for phosphate-containing compounds, were also tested (1Murakami-Murofushi K. Nakamura K. Ohta J. Suzuki M. Suzuki A. Murofushi H. Yokota T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16719-16723Google Scholar). Solvent systems I and II were also used for two-dimensional TLC. For the detection of components of a purified glycolipid, homogeneous substance was methanolized, and the resultant methyl glycoside and sterol were trimethylsilylated and analyzed by GLC on a column of 3% OV-101 as described (1Murakami-Murofushi K. Nakamura K. Ohta J. Suzuki M. Suzuki A. Murofushi H. Yokota T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16719-16723Google Scholar). Fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry for an intact glycolipid was carried out on a JEOL DX-303 mass spectrometer under the described conditions (1Murakami-Murofushi K. Nakamura K. Ohta J. Suzuki M. Suzuki A. Murofushi H. Yokota T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16719-16723Google Scholar). The glycolipid was dissolved in 50 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.0, and treated with α- or β-glucosidase as described (1Murakami-Murofushi K. Nakamura K. Ohta J. Suzuki M. Suzuki A. Murofushi H. Yokota T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16719-16723Google Scholar). The assay of this transferase was performed essentially by the procedure of Wojciechowski et al. (9Wojciechowski Z.A. Zimowski J. Tyski S. Phytochemistry. 1977; 16: 911-914Google Scholar, 10Wojciechowski Z.A. Zimowski J. Zimowski J.G. Lyznik A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 570: 363-370Google Scholar) with slight modification (2Murakami-Murofushi K. Ohta J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 992: 412-415Google Scholar). Colorimetric determination of hexose and sterol was performed according to Radin et al. (11Radin N.S. Lavin F.B. Brown J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 789-796Google Scholar) and Momose et al. (12Momose T. Ueda Y. Yamamoto K. Masumura T. Ohta K. Anal. Chem. 1963; 35: 1751-1753Google Scholar), respectively. When myxoamoebae were incubated at 40°C, the induction of a certain glycolipid was prominent soon after the temperature shift. Physarum myxoamoebae were heat-treated at 40°C for various periods, and crude lipid fractions that were extracted from heat-shocked cells were analyzed by TLC. A certain glycolipid, designated GL-X (Fig. 1), appeared just after the temperature shift and increased in amount for about 10 min. A content of this substance was maintained constantly for at least 60 min. The expression of this substance was followed by the induction of stress protein p66 and some other heat-shock proteins and microcyst formation as shown in Fig. 2.Fig. 2Induction of GL-X (A), p66 (B), and microcyst formation (C) in the course of heat treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A slight change of glycolipid C (Fig. 1) was also observed, but it was already present in significant quantities before the temperature shift. The chemical nature of glycolipids A-D and the meaning of the slight change of glycolipid C have not yet been studied. GL-X was purified as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the purity of this substance was analyzed by TLC in different solvent systems (I and II) and with some different color-developing reagents for the detection of some biochemical compounds. GL-X showed a single spot in each solvent system used and visualized with orcinol-H2SO4 and ferric chloride solution. No other reagents tested reacted with GL-X. Fig. 3 shows the two-dimensional TLC analysis of GL-X visualized with orcinol reagent (A) and ferric chloride reagent (B). Hence, GL-X is shown to be composed of hexose and sterol. The purified GL-X was subjected to a negative fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. The [M-1]− ion at m/e 573 was obtained, then the molecular weight of GL-X was determined to be 574 (Fig. 4). This molecular weight is identical with that of poriferasterol monoglucoside reported previously in Physarum plasmodia (1Murakami-Murofushi K. Nakamura K. Ohta J. Suzuki M. Suzuki A. Murofushi H. Yokota T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16719-16723Google Scholar). GL-X was methanolized, and trimethylsilyl derivatives of methyl glycoside and sterol were analyzed by GLC as shown in Fig. 5, Fig. 6. From these results, the sugar moiety and sterol moiety of GL-X were determined as glucose and poriferasterol, respectively. No other components were detected by GLC analysis under some different conditions with some different columns.Fig. 6Gas liquid chromatogram of O-trimethylsilyl derivatives of sterols. Standard sterols (A) and nonpolar moiety (B) of GL-X. Peaks correspond to the following sterols: cholesterol, 1; ergosterol, 2; campesterol, 3; poriferasterol, 4; sitosterol, 5. GLC analysis was done on a column of 3% OV-101 at 250°C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because GL-X was hydrolyzed with β-glucosidase but not α-glucosidase (data not shown), the linkage of glucose β-poriferasterol was suggested. From a colorimetric determination of glucose and sterol, a molar ratio of 1.0:1.1 was obtained. Table I shows the RF values of GL-X and the standard poriferasterol monoglucoside that was isolated from plasmodia of P. polycephalum, and these values also supported the identification of GL-X as poriferasterol monoglucoside (Fig. 7).Table I.Rf values of GL-X and PSMG in different solvent systemsaRF, rate of flow; PSMG, poriferasterol monoglucoside.Solvent systemRF valueGL-XPSMGI0.730.74II0.500.51a RF, rate of flow; PSMG, poriferasterol monoglucoside. Open table in a new tab Endogenous UDP-glucose:poriferasterol glucosyltransferase activities were assayed in the homogenates of haploid myxoamoebae before and after temperature shift from 24°C to 40°C. The enzyme activity was not detected in the homogenate before heat shock, but an apparent activation of UDP-glucose:poriferasterol glucosyltransferase was observed after heat shock as shown in Fig. 8. In this report, we showed a rapid expression of poriferasterol monoglucoside by heat shock at 40°C in the haploid myxoamoebae of P. polycephalum. The enzyme UDP-glucose:poriferasterol glucosyltransferase was also activated rapidly after heat shock to form the above-mentioned glycolipid. From these findings, rapid production of steryl glucoside might be involved in the very early process of stress response of Physarum myxoamoebae. Previously, we reported the expression of this substance during the differentiation of Physarum cells from haploid myxoamoebae to diploid plasmodia (1Murakami-Murofushi K. Nakamura K. Ohta J. Suzuki M. Suzuki A. Murofushi H. Yokota T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16719-16723Google Scholar), and an expression of UDP-glucose:poriferasterol glucosyltransferase activity associated with the differentiation was also demonstrated (2Murakami-Murofushi K. Ohta J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 992: 412-415Google Scholar). It takes about 1 week after mating for myxoamoebae to differentiate into plasmodia, but the steryl glucoside and its synthesizing enzyme appeared at an early stage of differentiation (1 day after the mating of haploid cells). The steryl glucoside and its 6′-O-acyl derivatives are known as common constituents of higher plants (13Lepage M. J. Lipid Res. 1964; 5: 587-592Google Scholar, 14Bush P.B. Grunwald C. Plant Physiol. 1972; 50: 69-72Google Scholar), and their functions are considered to be metabolically active components of plant membrane structure (15Grunwald C. Plant Physiol. 1971; 48: 653-655Google Scholar), intercellular transporters of sterols (16Evans F.J. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1972; 24: 645-650Google Scholar), or glucose carriers through cell membranes (17Smith P.F. Lipids. 1969; 4: 331-336Google Scholar, 18Wojciechowski Z.A. Zimowski J. Zielenska M. Phytochemistry. 1976; 15: 1681-1683Google Scholar). In Physarum, plasmodia are capable of growth in liquid or on agar media, but myxoamoebae, except for the rare mutant strain Colonia (19McCullough C.H.R. Dee J. Foxon J.L. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1978; 106: 297-306Google Scholar), can be cultured only on bacterial lawns. Myxoamoebae may not be able to utilize glucose and other small molecules, but plasmodia are capable of utilizing them as nutrients. Poriferasterol monoglucoside may have some active functions in membranes showing such interesting properties. A matingless mutant, Colonia strain, differentiates from myxoamoebae into plasmodia without any changes of nuclear DNA. When the cultivating temperature is reduced from 30°C to 25°C, the myxoamoebae differentiate into plasmodia without conjugation, and then haploid, not diploid, plasmodia are formed. We showed that the cells of this mutant strain contained poriferasterol monoglucoside and its synthesizing enzyme in both the myxoamoeboid and plasmodial stages. We also demonstrated that Colonia cells showed a slower rate of growth than that of wild-type ones on a lawn of bacteria, but they could survive and increase their cell number even in culture medium (20Murakami-Murofushi K. Kamiya Y. Mimura K. Ohta J. Proc. Jpn. Acad. 1990; 66: 197-202Google Scholar). This indicates that the Colonia myxoamoebae can uptake some small substances from the nutrient media as their energy source. Then the uptake of glucose and amino acids into myxoamoebae was measured. The results clearly showed a much higher uptake of D-glucose into Colonia cells than into wild-type cells. The uptake ability of amino acids into wild-type and mutant myxoamoebae was examined, and no difference between them was observed. Because almost no differences were observed in the composition of other membrane components between wild-type and Colonia myxoamoebae, these results strongly suggest the involvement of poriferasterol monoglucoside in the active transport of D-glucose. Then we discussed that this substance may assist or regulate the action of glucose transporter protein in plasma membrane (20Murakami-Murofushi K. Kamiya Y. Mimura K. Ohta J. Proc. Jpn. Acad. 1990; 66: 197-202Google Scholar). This substance may also be considered to act as an accelerator on the fusion of plasma membrane because the fusion of plasma membranes of mutant myxoamoebae occurred when the temperature was reduced, but wild-type myxoamoebae could fuse only in the case of conjugation of the cells of different mating types. The biological significance of heat induction of steryl glucoside has not yet been clarified, but this substance may have some important role(s) in the process of heat-induced differentiation. It may act at an early step in a signal transduction system to trigger stress-induced differentiation; for example, it may regulate the heat-receptor on the membrane or assist a movement of active molecules in the membrane to induce successive heat responses. Another possibility is that this substance by itself may act as a mediator in a signal transduction system of heat stress. Additional investigations are necessary to clarify the biological significance of a glycosylation of membrane sterol in heat response and cell differentiation. Recently, we also found a heat-induced expression of steryl glycoside in human cultured cells, and the purification and characterization of this substance are now underway. Hence, this phenomenon is not specified in Physarum cells and might have some important role(s) in all organisms. We are indebted to Dr. Ichiro Yahara of the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Sciences and Dr. Kazuhiro Nagata of Kyoto University for their encouragement and valuable discussion on this study."

High affinity BK binding was fully regained when two residues, Tyr259 and Ala263, near the extracellular surface of TM-VI in B2(B1VI), were replaced with the corresponding residues in the wild-type B2 receptor, which are Phe259 and Thr263.

https://openalex.org/W2066940775,"Cholinergic agonists stimulate isotonic fluid secretion in the parotid gland. This process is driven by the apical exit of Cl−, which enters the cells partly via Cl−/HCO3− exchange across the basolateral membrane. Acidification of the cytosol by the extrusion of HCO3− is prevented by the concomitant activation of the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE), which is directly activated by cholinergic stimulation. Multiple isoforms of the NHE have been described in mammalian cells, but the particular isoform(s) present in salivary glands and their mechanism of activation have not been defined. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction with isoform-specific primers was used to establish that NHE-1 and NHE-2, but not NHE-3 or NHE-4, are expressed in parotid glands. The presence of NHE-1 was confirmed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence, which additionally demonstrated that this isoform is abundant in the basolateral membrane of acinar cells. The predominant role of NHE-1 in carbachol-induced Na+/H+ exchange was established pharmacologically using HOE694, an inhibitor with differential potency toward the individual isoforms. Because muscarinic agonists induce stimulation of protein kinases in acinar cells, we assessed the role of phosphorylation in the activation of the antiport. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that, although NHE-1 was phosphorylated in the resting state, no further phosphorylation occurred upon treatment with carbachol. Similar phosphopeptide patterns were observed in control and carbachol-treated samples. Together, these findings indicate that NHE-1, the predominant isoform of the antiporter in the basolateral membrane of acinar cells, is activated during muscarinic stimulation by a phosphorylation-independent event. Other processes, such as association of Ca2+-calmodulin complexes to the cytosolic domain of the antiporter, may be responsible for the activation of Na+/H+ exchange. Cholinergic agonists stimulate isotonic fluid secretion in the parotid gland. This process is driven by the apical exit of Cl−, which enters the cells partly via Cl−/HCO3− exchange across the basolateral membrane. Acidification of the cytosol by the extrusion of HCO3− is prevented by the concomitant activation of the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE), which is directly activated by cholinergic stimulation. Multiple isoforms of the NHE have been described in mammalian cells, but the particular isoform(s) present in salivary glands and their mechanism of activation have not been defined. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction with isoform-specific primers was used to establish that NHE-1 and NHE-2, but not NHE-3 or NHE-4, are expressed in parotid glands. The presence of NHE-1 was confirmed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence, which additionally demonstrated that this isoform is abundant in the basolateral membrane of acinar cells. The predominant role of NHE-1 in carbachol-induced Na+/H+ exchange was established pharmacologically using HOE694, an inhibitor with differential potency toward the individual isoforms. Because muscarinic agonists induce stimulation of protein kinases in acinar cells, we assessed the role of phosphorylation in the activation of the antiport. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that, although NHE-1 was phosphorylated in the resting state, no further phosphorylation occurred upon treatment with carbachol. Similar phosphopeptide patterns were observed in control and carbachol-treated samples. Together, these findings indicate that NHE-1, the predominant isoform of the antiporter in the basolateral membrane of acinar cells, is activated during muscarinic stimulation by a phosphorylation-independent event. Other processes, such as association of Ca2+-calmodulin complexes to the cytosolic domain of the antiporter, may be responsible for the activation of Na+/H+ exchange."

To understand the fundamental cause for the secretion defect of the Z and Siiyama variants of α1-AT, we investigated in vivo folding and stability of these variant α1-AT using the secretion system of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Various thermostable mutations suppressing the folding block of the Z variant in vitro corrected the secretion defect as well as the intracellular degradation in the yeast secretion system. Significantly, the extent of suppression in the secretion defect of Z protein was proportional to the extent of suppression in the folding defect, assuring that the in vivo defect associated with the Z variant is primarily derived from the folding block. In contrast, the folding and secretion efficiency of Siiyama was not much improved by the same mutations. In addition, none of the rarely secreted Siiyamaα1-AT carrying the stabilizing mutations for the wild type and Z variant were active.

Other phospholipids examined, including phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylethanolamine, show low or negligible affinity with the peptide. Several lines of evidence indicate that this phosphoinositide-peptide interaction is not due to nonspecific electrostatic interactions or phospholipid aggregation, and requires a cooperative action among the hydrophobic and basic residues to exert the selective recognition. CD data suggest that the peptide acquires an ordered structure upon binding to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Further, we demonstrate that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 enhances the phosphorylation rate of this binding peptide by protein kinase C (PKC)-α in a dose-dependent manner. In view of the findings that this stimulatory effect is not noted with other PKC peptide substrates lacking affinity with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and that PKC-α is not susceptible to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 activation, the activity enhancement is thought to result from the substrate-concentrating effect of the D-3 phosphoinositide, i.e. the presence of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 allows the peptide to bind to the same vesicles/micelles to which PKC is bound. Moreover, it is noteworthy that neurogranin, the full-length protein of W-NG28-43 and a relevant PKC substrate in the forebrain, binds PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 with high affinity.

These deposits are often a complication of chronic inflammatory disorders and are associated with a local disturbance in basement membrane (BM). In the course of trying to understand the pathogenesis of this disease laminin, a major BM glycoprotein, has been discovered to bind saturably, and with high affinity to murine acute-phase apoSAA. This interaction involves a single class of binding sites, which are ionic in nature, conformation-dependent, and possibly involve sulfhydryls. Binding activity was significantly enhanced by Zn2+, an effect possibly mediated through Cys-rich zinc finger-like sequences on laminin. Collagen type IV also bound apoSAA but with lower affinity. Unexpectedly, no binding was detected for perlecan, a BM proteoglycan previously implicated in AA fibrillogenesis, although a low affinity interaction cannot be excluded. Entactin, another BM protein that functions to cross-link the BM matrix and is normally complexed with laminin, could inhibit laminin-apoSAA binding suggesting apoSAA does not bind to normal BM. Since laminin binds apoSAA with high affinity and has previously been shown to codeposit with AA amyloid fibrils, we postulate that laminin interacts with apoSAA and facilitates nucleation events leading to fibrillogenesis. This work also provides further support for the hypothesis that a disturbance in BM metabolism contributes to the genesis of amyloid. The specificity and avidity of the laminin-apoSAA interaction also implies that it may be a normal event occurring during the inflammatory process, which mediates one or more of the functions recently proposed for apoSAA.

In addition to time- and concentration-dependent inactivation of lauric acid and 11-DDYA oxidation, irreversible binding of 11-DDYA (200 pmol of 11-DDYA bound/mg of microsomal protein) at a saturating concentration of 11-DDYA was observed. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis showed that 30% of the label was associated with several protein bands of about 53 kDa. The presence of beta-mercaptoethanol in the incubate reduces 1,12-dodecandioic acid formation and leads to a polar metabolite resulting from the interaction of oxidized 11-DDYA with the nucleophile. Although the alkylation of proteins was reduced, the lauric acid omega-hydroxylase activity was not restored, suggesting an active site-directed inactivation mechanism. Similar results were obtained when reconstituted mixtures of cytochrome P450 from family CYP4A from rabbit liver were incubated with 11-DDYA. In contrast, both 11- and 10-DDYA resulted in covalent labeling of the cytochrome P450 2B4 protein and irreversible inhibition of activity. These results demonstrate that acetylenic analogues of substrate are efficient mechanism-based inhibitors and that a correlation between the position of the acetylenic bond in the inhibitor and the regiochemistry of cytochromes P450 oxygenation is essential for enzyme inactivation."

In normal synovial fibroblasts only one site for 125I-α2M-methylamine (Kd∼5.36 nM) was present. Receptor-associated protein did not inhibit the binding of α2M-methylamine to the high affinity binding sites, but it caused a 70-80% reduction in its binding to low affinity binding sites establishing its identity as the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein/α2M receptor.

In the case of α2M, proteinase cleavage results in “trapping” of the proteinase and inhibition of its ability to cleave most macromolecular substrates. The active site of the enzyme remains intact, and small proteinase substrates and even some proteins can access the entrapped proteinase and undergo cleavage (1Sottrup-Jensen L. Putnam F.W. Plasma Proteins. Academic Press, New York1987: 191-291Google Scholar). Attack of proteinases on α2M results in a major conformational change of the inhibitor, which exposes receptor recognition sites on each of its four identical subunits (for review see 2Chu C.T. Pizzo S.V. Lab. Invest. 1994; 71: 792-812Google Scholar). The presence of these receptors on various cells results in rapid removal of α2M-proteinase complexes from the circulation so that these complexes do not remain a source of active proteinases.

We have termed this receptor the α2M signaling receptor (α2MSR) (7Misra U.K. Chu C.T.-C. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12541-12547Google Scholar, 8Misra U.K. Chu C.T.-C. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18303-18306Google Scholar). The distribution, ligand binding, RAP inhibition and signaling characteristics of α2MSR are quite different from LRP/α2MR on murine macrophages (9Howard G.C. Misra U.K. DeCamp D.L. Pizzo S.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1193-1203Google Scholar, 10Howard G.C. Yamaguchi Y. Misra U.K. Gawdi G. Nelsen A. DeCamp D.L. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14105-14111Google Scholar). Agonist-induced increases in IP3 cause a rise in cytosolic calcium by activating release from calcium-sequestering target organelles, and the increase in cytosolic calcium mediates a multitude of cellular responses (for review see 11Berridge M.D. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 849-858Google Scholar and 12Putney J.W. Bird G.S. Endocrinol. Rev. 1993; 14: 610-631Google Scholar). Elevated cytosolic calcium pools have recently been reported to modulate specific cell cycle events and DNA synthesis in 3T3 and DDT1MF-2 smooth muscle cells (13Charlesworth A. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32528-32538Google Scholar, 14Waldron R.T. Short A.D. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11955-11961Google Scholar). We chose to study synovial fibroblasts for several reasons: 1) these cells, which play a critical role in the inflammatory response of rheumatoid arthritis, have never been examined for the presence of either α2M receptor and 2) we have previously demonstrated that although both normal and rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts express plasminogen receptors, they are completely different structurally (15Gonzalez-Gronow M. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4360-4366Google Scholar). Moreover, only the plasminogen receptor of rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts is coupled to a signaling cascade (16Gonzalez-Gronow M. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20791-20795Google Scholar). In the present work, we examined normal and rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts for LRP/α2MR and α2MSR. These studies demonstrate that both cell types express LRP/α2MR but only rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts express α2MSR. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this receptor has ligand binding, signaling, and RAP inhibition characteristics similar to those reported for α2MSR in murine macrophages (7Misra U.K. Chu C.T.-C. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12541-12547Google Scholar, 8Misra U.K. Chu C.T.-C. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18303-18306Google Scholar, 9Howard G.C. Misra U.K. DeCamp D.L. Pizzo S.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1193-1203Google Scholar). In addition, we also report that whereas α2M-methylamine caused a 1.5-2-fold increase in DNA synthesis in rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts, the normal synovial fibroblasts remained unaffected, suggesting a growth factor-like activity of α2M-methylamine in rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts and observations made with smooth muscle cells (17Webb D.J. Hussaini J.M. Weaver A.M. Atkins T.L. Chu C.T. Pizzo S.V. Owens G.K. Gonias S.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 714-722Google Scholar). The methods employed in these studies have been described in detail previously (6Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Rubenstein D.S. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 885-891Google Scholar, 7Misra U.K. Chu C.T.-C. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12541-12547Google Scholar, 8Misra U.K. Chu C.T.-C. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol.

Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20791-20795Google Scholar). Hence they will be described only in brief. Human α2M was purified and reacted with methylamine as described previously (18Imber M.J. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8134-8139Google Scholar). Fura-2/AM was obtained from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). Myo-[2-3H]inositol (specific activity, 10-20 Ci/mmol), sodium [3H]acetate (specific activity, 100 mCi/mmol), [3H]methylcholine chloride (specific activity, 60 Ci/mmol), and [3H]thymidine (specific activity, 70 Ci/mmol) were purchased from American Radiochemical (St. Louis, MO). The plasmid containing the LRP insert was a kind gift of Dr. Joachim Herz (University of Texas, Southwestern, Dallas, TX). All other reagents were of the highest grade available. Synovial fibroblasts were isolated by the explant method from synovial tissue removed from patients with a documented history of rheumatoid arthritis or from cadavers with no prior history of joint disease, cultured as described previously (15Gonzalez-Gronow M. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4360-4366Google Scholar, 16Gonzalez-Gronow M. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20791-20795Google Scholar), and used at passages 4-7. Greater than 98% of cells in these cultures are fibroblasts actively synthesizing collagen, as determined by reactivity with M38 monoclonal antibody specific for Type I procollagen (19McDonald J.A. Broekelman T.J. Matheke M.J. Crouch E. Koo M. Kuhn C. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 1237-1244Google Scholar). No significant reactivity was detected with CD14 monoclonal antibody LeuM3 specific for macrophages. Previous studies have demonstrated that primary synovial macrophages do not proliferate significantly under the culture conditions used for synovial fibroblasts and are not passaged using the gentle trypsinization procedures employed for synovial fibroblast cultures (20Weinberg J.B. Athens J.B. Wintrobe's Clinical Hematology. Lea and Febiger, Philadelphia1993: 267-298Google Scholar). Rheumatoid synovial tissue was obtained from the Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine. The studies described here were performed over a 2-year period with at least six different preparations of rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts. The results were not significantly different from preparation to preparation with respect to the parameters reported in the present study. A partial human LRP/α2MR cDNA fragment ranging from base pairs 188 to 6179 inserted into the plasmid pGEM 4 was used for hybridization with mRNAs isolated from normal and rheumatoid synovial cells. This plasmid was a kind gift of Dr. Joachim Herz. The probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a nick translation system (Life Technologies, Inc.) with DNA polymerase I/DNase I according to instructions provided by the manufacturer. mRNA from cells (1 × 106) grown to confluency was isolated and purified using the Micro-Fast Track mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) according to instructions provided by the manufacturer. Each mRNA sample in 100 μl of water was mixed with 300 μl of 6.15 M formaldehyde containing 1.3 M NaCl and 0.17 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0 (10 × SSC; 1 × SSC = 1.3 M NaCl and 0.17 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0), incubated for 15 min at 65°C, loaded onto nitrocellulose paper using a Minifold II slot blotter (Schleicher & Schuell). The filter was washed with 400 μl of 10 × SSC and baked for 2 h at 80°C under vacuum. The filter was immersed in 6 × SSC for 2 min and prehybridization buffer containing 0.5% SDS, 5 × Denhardt's solution, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA prewarmed to 68°C was added (0.2 ml/cm2) and incubated for 2 h at 68°C. The prehybridization buffer was removed, and hybridization buffer containing 6 × SSC, 10 mM EDTA, 2 × 106 CMP 32P-labeled denatured LRP/α2MR cDNA probe, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA was added (50 μl/cm2) and filter hybridized for 16 h at 68°C. The filter was washed twice with 2 × SSC containing 0.5% SDS at 25°C for 15 min followed by two washings with 2 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS and 0.1 × SSC containing 0.5% SDS, respectively. The filter was dried at 25°C and subjected to autoradiography either by exposing it to x-ray film or using a PhosphorImager. The binding assay is essentially identical to that previously reported for binding of α2M-methylamine to macrophages (21Enghild J.J. Thøgersen I.B. Roche P.A. Pizzo S.V. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1400-1412Google Scholar). In brief, human normal and rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts were cultured in 48-well tissue culture plates until the cell monolayers were confluent (70000-80000 cells/well). Prior to use in binding assays, monolayers were washed three times with HHBSS (Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10 mM Hepes and 3.5 mM NaHCO3, pH 7.4). All binding assays were performed at 4°C in RPMI 1640 (standard medium to which was added 10% iron supplemental calf serum, insulin (5 μg/ml), adenine (1.8 × 10−4M), sodium pyruvate (2 μM), epidermal growth factor (20 ng/ml), penicillin (12.5 units/ml), and streptomycin (6 μg/ml)) containing 2% bovine serum albumin (16Gonzalez-Gronow M. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20791-20795Google Scholar). 125I-α2M-methylamine was incubated with the synovial fibroblasts for 60 min at 4°C. Free ligand was separated from bound by rapidly aspirating the medium in the cold, and monolayers were washed extensively (7-8 times) with chilled RPMI 1640 medium containing 2% bovine serum albumin. The cells were lysed with 1 M NaOH, and bound radioactivity was determined in a γ counter. The specific binding of α2M-methylamine to receptors was calculated by subtracting nonspecific binding determined in the presence of 5 mM EDTA from total binding (21Enghild J.J. Thøgersen I.B. Roche P.A. Pizzo S.V. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1400-1412Google Scholar). Normal and rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts were grown to confluency in six-well tissue culture plates (1-1.5 × 106 cells/well) in RPMI 1640 medium containing the additions as listed above. Prior to use for inositol phosphates measurements (6Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Rubenstein D.S. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 885-891Google Scholar, 7Misra U.K. Chu C.T.-C. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12541-12547Google Scholar, 8Misra U.K. Chu C.T.-C. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18303-18306Google Scholar), medium from monolayers was aspirated, and a volume of inositol-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin was added followed by the addition of myo-[2-3H]inositol (8 μCi/ml) to each well. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 16-18 h in a humidified CO2 (5%) incubator. The radiolabeled monolayers were washed five times with HHBSS containing 10 mM LiCl, 1 mM CaCl2, and 1 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4, and a volume of HHBSS containing additions listed above was added to the monolayers. The monolayers were preincubated for 3 min at 37°C prior to stimulation with α2M-methylamine (100 nM) for varying periods of time. The reaction was terminated by aspirating the medium and adding 6.25% ice-cold perchloric acid. The cells were scrapped and transferred to tubes containing 5 mM EDTA and 1 ml of octylamine:freon (1:1, v/v), and the tubes centrifuged at 5600 × g for 20 min at 4°C. The upper phase was applied to a 1-ml packed Dowex resin column (AG1-X8 formate; Bio-Rad) and sequentially eluted in a batch fashion with H2O, 50, 200, 400, 800, 1200, and 2000 mM ammonium formate containing 0.1 M formic acid, respectively (11Berridge M.D. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 849-858Google Scholar). An aliquot was used for determining radioactivity in a liquid scintillation counter. The intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in normal and rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts stimulated with α2M-methylamine was measured according to methods published earlier (6Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Rubenstein D.S. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 885-891Google Scholar, 7Misra U.K. Chu C.T.-C. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12541-12547Google Scholar, 8Misra U.K. Chu C.T.-C. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18303-18306Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were plated on glass coverslips kept in 35-mm Petri dishes at a cell density of 1-1.5 × 105/cm2 and incubated in RPMI 1640 medium for 16-18 h at 37°C in a humidified CO2 (5%) incubator. At the end of the incubation, 4 μM Fura-2/AM was added, and cells were incubated at 37°C for 30 min in the dark and used for [Ca2+]i measurements in a digital imaging microscope as described (6Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Rubenstein D.S. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 885-891Google Scholar, 7Misra U.K. Chu C.T.-C. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12541-12547Google Scholar, 8Misra U.K. Chu C.T.-C. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18303-18306Google Scholar). The effect of pertussis toxin (1 μg/ml) on α2M-methylamine-induced changes in [Ca2+]i was studied as described previously (7Misra U.K. Chu C.T.-C. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12541-12547Google Scholar, 8Misra U.K. Chu C.T.-C. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18303-18306Google Scholar). Rheumatoid and normal synovial fibroblasts were isolated and cultured to confluency as described above (16Gonzalez-Gronow M. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20791-20795Google Scholar). Monolayers were washed with chilled HHBSS, a volume of quiescent medium was added followed by the addition of [3H] methylcholine chloride (2 μCi/ml), and cells were incubated as above for 16 h. Labeled monolayers were washed four times with HHBSS, a volume of quiescent medium was added, and monolayers were preincubated for 5 min at 37°C before adding α2M-methylamine (100 nM) and incubation continued. At specified time periods, the medium was quantiatively transferred to a clean glass tube to assess the secretion of newly synthesized PAF, and a volume of chilled, methanol containing 50 mM acetic acid to monolayers was added. The cells were scraped in to glass tubes, the wells were washed once with 1 ml of methanol, and the wash was combined with the cell suspension. Details of lipid extraction, PAF fractionation by thin layer chromatography, determination of radioactivity in cellular and secreted PAF, and identity of PAF are given in an earlier publication (22Misra U.K. Pizzo S.V. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 39-47Google Scholar). Synovial fibroblasts were isolated and cultured to confluency as described above (16Gonzalez-Gronow M. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20791-20795Google Scholar). The cells were washed twice with HHBSS and incubated overnight as above in quiescent medium added to monolayers followed by the addition of [3H]sodium acetate (20 μCi/ml), and cells were labeled for 30 min at 37°C. The labeled cells were washed four times with HHBSS, a volume of quiescent medium was added, and cells were preincubated for 5 min before adding α2M-methylamine (100 nM). Other details of quantitating radioactivity in cellular and secreted PAF were the same as described above. Rheumatoid and normal fibroblasts (70-80 × 103 cells/well) were plated in 24-well plates separately and grown to confluency as described (16Gonzalez-Gronow M. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20791-20795Google Scholar). The monolayers were washed with HHBSS, a volume of quiescent medium was added along with [3H]thymidine (5 μCi/ml) and α2M-methylamine) (100 nM), and cells were incubated for specific periods of time. In an additional set of studies, monolayers of rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts were treated with the cloned and expressed α2-macroglobulin receptor-binding fragment (RBF) (9Howard G.C. Misra U.K. DeCamp D.L. Pizzo S.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1193-1203Google Scholar, 10Howard G.C. Yamaguchi Y. Misra U.K. Gawdi G. Nelsen A. DeCamp D.L. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14105-14111Google Scholar) at concentrations of 50 pM or 1 nM. For some of these studies RAP (200 nM) was included in the incubation in addition to RBF. The reaction was terminated by aspirating the medium and washing monolayers six times with chilled HHBSS buffer. The cells were lysed in a volume of 1 N NaOH at 40°C, and radioactivity was determined on an aliquot by scintillation counting. 125I-α2M-methylamine binds to both normal and rheumatoid cells, and the binding is saturable (Fig. 1A). Rheumatoid cells bound 2-3-fold more α2M-methylamine than normal synovial cells (Fig. 1A). Rheumatoid cells showed two binding sites for α2M-methylamine. One site had a high affinity (Kd∼52 pM) and the second site had a lower affinity (Kd∼9.7 nM) for α2M-methylamine (Fig. 1B). In contrast normal synovial cells had only the lower affinity binding site (Kd∼ 5.6 nM) for α2M-methylamine (Fig. 1B). Binding of α2M-methylamine to the high affinity binding sites on rheumatoid cells was not inhibited by RAP (100-fold excess), whereas RAP greatly reduced binding of α2M-methylamine to the lower affinity binding site in both normal and rheumatoid cells confirming its identity as LRP/α2MR. The receptor number in rheumatoid cells was about 20% higher than normal synovial cells. We then employed slot blot hybridization analysis to detect mRNA for LRP/α2MR in both types of synovial cells. As is evident from Fig. 2, both normal and rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts express LRP/α2MR.Fig. 2Northern blot of LRP/α2MR mRNA in synovial fibroblasts. LRP/α2MR mRNA was estimated by Northern blot analysis in human normal (lanes 2-4) and rheumatoid (lanes 6-8) synovial cells. The data are representative of two independent experiments. The details of extraction of mRNAs and hybridization with the cDNA probe for LRP/α2MR mRNA are given under “Experimental Procedures.” Different aliquots of mRNAs isolated from normal synovial cells (lane 2, 1.5 μl; lane 3, 3 μl; lane 4, 5 μl) and rheumatoid synovial cells (lane 6, 1.5 μl; lane 7, 3 μl; lane 8, 5 μl) were used for hybridization. The radioactivity of hybridized blots was detected by using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Diagnostics). Lane 1 is the blank, and lane 5 is the [α-32P]dCTP probe.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next studied the ability of α2M-methylamine to induce IP3 synthesis in synovial fibroblasts. Fig. 3 demonstrates that there is a marked difference in the generation of IP3 upon binding of α2M-methylamine to its receptors on normal and rheumatoid cells. With rheumatoid cells, ligation of α2M-methylamine to its receptors rapidly but transiently increased IP3 levels by about 50-60%. Inclusion of RAP (100-fold excess) in the incubation did not significantly suppress the 50-60% induction of IP3 synthesis caused by α2M-methylamine. In contrast, the binding of α2M-methylamine to normal cells resulted in a very small increase in intracellular IP3 (<5%). Exposure of normal cells to higher ligand concentrations did not cause a greater rate of IP3 synthesis (data not shown). Concomitant with a rise in IP3, ligation of α2M-methylamine to rheumatoid but not normal synovial fibroblasts resulted in a significant increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 4A). The cell shown in Fig. 4A demonstrated a 4-fold increase in [Ca2+]i from a resting value of 80-350 nM. For these studies multiple cells were analyzed by digital imaging microscopy using Fura-2/AM-loaded cells. For rheumatoid cells 90-95% of the cells responded to α2M-methylamine treatment in a manner comparable with the cell shown in Fig. 4A. A somewhat lesser response rate was observed when peritoneal macrophages were exposed to α2M-methylamine (6Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Rubenstein D.S. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 885-891Google Scholar). Although 60-65% of normal cells showed some changes in [Ca2+]i, this response was minimal (<10% change). Table I summarizes the data from four separate studies of normal and five studies of rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts. α2M-methylamine-induced increases in IP3 and [Ca2+]i in rheumatoid cells were not affected by RAP. Pertussis toxin had no effect on α2M-methylamine-induced increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 4B), similar to macrophages where we have shown that a G protein coupled to the receptor is pertussis toxin-insensitive (7Misra U.K. Chu C.T.-C. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12541-12547Google Scholar, 8Misra U.K. Chu C.T.-C. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol.

A, normal (○) and rheumatoid (•) synovial cells were preloaded with 4 μM of Fura-2/AM for 20 min at 37°C, and changes in [Ca2+]i were measured as described previously (6Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Rubenstein D.S. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 885-891Google Scholar, 7Misra U.K. Chu C.T.-C. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol.

B, rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts were treated with buffer (○) or Pertussis toxin (1 μg/ml for 16 h) (▵) prior to stimulation with α2M-methylamine (100 nM) added at arrow a. In a separate study, cells were treated with RAP (100-fold excess) (□) added at arrow b 6 min prior to the addition of α2M-methylamine added at arrow c. The changes in [Ca2+]i are representative of 4-5 independent experiments using 6-12 individual cells in each experiment. Table I shows the averaged data for all the cells studied.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IChanges in [Ca2+]i in normal and rheumatoid synovial cells stimulated with α2M-methylamine (100 nM)Synovial cell typeNumber of studiesCells studiedResponse[Ca2+]iBasal5 min%nMNormal43460−6568.04 ± 7.7289.74 ± 7.97Rheumatoid53990−9558.62 ± 7.25232.1 ± 15.11 Open table in a new tab DNA synthesis from [3H]thymidine by normal and rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts stimulated with α2M-methylamine was then compared (Fig. 5). DNA synthesis in both cell types was comparable with up to 4 h of treatment with α2M-methylamine, but thereafter, α2M-methylamine increased DNA synthesis in rheumatoid cells by about 2-fold compared with normal cells (Fig. 5). In unstimulated rheumatoid and normal cells the DNA synthesis was comparable (data not shown). The concentration of α2M-methylamine chosen for this study, 100 nM, was based on previous studies with this ligand under a number of conditions. However, more recent studies and the present work suggest that α2MSR binds ligands at very high affinity, Kd∼ 50 pM (9Howard G.C. Misra U.K. DeCamp D.L. Pizzo S.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1193-1203Google Scholar, 10Howard G.C. Yamaguchi Y. Misra U.K. Gawdi G. Nelsen A. DeCamp D.L. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14105-14111Google Scholar). We therefore performed additional studies treating rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts with RBF at concentrations of 50 pM and 1 nM, respectively (Table II). At both ligand concentrations DNA synthesis was significantly increased. Moreover, inclusion of RAP (200 nM) caused little decrease in"
https://openalex.org/W2013619863,"The consensus substrate site for cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is Arg-Arg-Xaa-Ser(P)-Xaa and the autoinhibitory domain of the PKA type Iα regulatory subunit (RI subunit) contains a similar sequence, Arg92-Arg-Arg-Arg-Gly-Ala-Ile-Ser-Ala-Glu. The italicized amino acids form a putative pseudosubstrate site (Ser is replaced with Ala), which together with adjacent residues could competitively inhibit substrate phosphorylation by the PKA catalytic subunit (C subunit). The present studies determine the contributions of Arg92-95, Ile98, and Glu101 to inhibitory potency. Amino-terminal truncation of RI subunit through Arg92 (Δ1-92) or Arg93 (Δ1-93) had no detectable effect on inhibition of C subunit. Truncation through Arg94 (Δ1-94), or point mutation of Arg95 within truncated mutants (Δ1-93.R95A or Δ1-92.R95A), caused a dramatic reduction in inhibitory potency. Truncation through Arg95 (Δ1-95) had a greater effect than did replacement or deletion of Arg94 or Arg95 alone. Using full-length RI subunit, the inhibitory potency was reduced by replacing Ile98 with Ala, Gly, or Gln, but not by replacing it with Val. The inhibitory potency of RI subunit was unchanged when Glu101 was replaced with Ala or Gln. It is concluded that Arg94, Arg95 and, to a lesser extent, Ile98 are vital constituents of PKA autoinhibition by type Iα R subunit. The consensus substrate site for cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is Arg-Arg-Xaa-Ser(P)-Xaa and the autoinhibitory domain of the PKA type Iα regulatory subunit (RI subunit) contains a similar sequence, Arg92-Arg-Arg-Arg-Gly-Ala-Ile-Ser-Ala-Glu. The italicized amino acids form a putative pseudosubstrate site (Ser is replaced with Ala), which together with adjacent residues could competitively inhibit substrate phosphorylation by the PKA catalytic subunit (C subunit). The present studies determine the contributions of Arg92-95, Ile98, and Glu101 to inhibitory potency. Amino-terminal truncation of RI subunit through Arg92 (Δ1-92) or Arg93 (Δ1-93) had no detectable effect on inhibition of C subunit. Truncation through Arg94 (Δ1-94), or point mutation of Arg95 within truncated mutants (Δ1-93.R95A or Δ1-92.R95A), caused a dramatic reduction in inhibitory potency. Truncation through Arg95 (Δ1-95) had a greater effect than did replacement or deletion of Arg94 or Arg95 alone. Using full-length RI subunit, the inhibitory potency was reduced by replacing Ile98 with Ala, Gly, or Gln, but not by replacing it with Val. The inhibitory potency of RI subunit was unchanged when Glu101 was replaced with Ala or Gln. It is concluded that Arg94, Arg95 and, to a lesser extent, Ile98 are vital constituents of PKA autoinhibition by type Iα R subunit. cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) 1The abbreviations used are: PKAcAMP-dependent protein kinaseC subunitcatalytic subunitR subunitregulatory subunitRI subunittype Iα regulatory subunitRII subunittype II regulatory subunitPKGcGMP-dependent protein kinaseR2C2holoenzyme complex of cAMP-dependent protein kinasePKIprotein kinase inhibitorcG-BPDEcGMP-binding, cGMP-specific phosphodiesteraseWTwild typebpbase pair(s)BSAbovine serum albumincIMP3′,5′, cyclic inosine monophosphatePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. is a tetramer comprising a dimer of regulatory subunits (R subunit) and two catalytic subunits (C subunit). In the absence of cAMP, PKA is maintained as an inactive holoenzyme complex (R2C2). cAMP binding to the R subunit causes dissociation of the R and C subunits and subsequent activation of the kinase (1Walsh D.A. Krebs E.G. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1973: 555-581Google Scholar). There are two major classes of PKA holoenzyme, types I and II, denoted by the R subunit isoform associated with C subunit (2Corbin J.D. Keely S.L. Park C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 218-225Google Scholar). Despite numerous differences in the R subunit isoforms, they share the same basic domain structure: a short amino-terminal dimerization domain, an autoinhibitory domain located in the amino-terminal segment of the protein, and two cAMP-binding domains toward the carboxyl-terminal end. cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit regulatory subunit type Iα regulatory subunit type II regulatory subunit cGMP-dependent protein kinase holoenzyme complex of cAMP-dependent protein kinase protein kinase inhibitor cGMP-binding, cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase wild type base pair(s) bovine serum albumin 3′,5′, cyclic inosine monophosphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The autoinhibitory domain of the R subunit contains a sequence that mimics the consensus phosphorylation sequence of PKA substrates (Arg-Arg-Xaa-Ser(P)-Xaa). In the type II R subunit (RII subunit), this sequence (Arg-Arg-Val-Ser(P)-Val) is a substrate for C subunit, but in the RI subunit, the phosphorylatable Ser is substituted with a non-phosphorylatable Ala residue to form a pseudosubstrate site (Arg-Arg-Xaa-Ala-Xaa). The pseudosubstrate sequence is believed to interact with the C subunit catalytic site to competitively inhibit substrate phosphorylation (3Corbin J.D. Sugden P.H. West L. Flockhart D.A. Lincoln T.M. McCarthy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3997-4003Google Scholar). The phosphorylation or pseudophosphorylation site is designated as the P residue, while residues located amino-terminal or carboxyl-terminal to P are designated as minus or plus residues, respectively (4Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 414-420Google Scholar). The P−3 and P−2 Arg residues are important determinants for phosphorylation of PKA substrates (5Zetterqvist O. Ragnarsson U. Humble E. Berglund L. Engstrom L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 70: 696-703Google Scholar, 6Kemp B.E. Graves D.J. Benjamini E. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4888-4894Google Scholar). Replacement of either residue in peptide substrate analogs profoundly impairs the phosphorylation of the peptide. The P−3 and P−2 Arg residues are invariant in all known R subunit pseudosubstrate sequences and are required for potent inhibition of C subunit (3Corbin J.D. Sugden P.H. West L. Flockhart D.A. Lincoln T.M. McCarthy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3997-4003Google Scholar, 7Wang Y.H. Scott J.D. McKnight G.S. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2446-2450Google Scholar, 8Buechler Y.J. Herberg F.W. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16495-16503Google Scholar). They are also found in the pseudosubstrate sequence of the high affinity, heat-stable protein kinase inhibitor of PKA, PKI (Arg-Arg-Gln-Ala-Ile) (9Scott J.D. Fischer E.H. Takio K. Demaille J.G. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5732-5736Google Scholar). The importance of these two Arg residues in PKI has also been well documented using peptide analogs (10Scott J.D. Fischer E.H. Demaille J.G. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4379-4383Google Scholar, 11Cheng H.-C. Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Smith A.J. Misconi L. Van Patten S.M. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 989-992Google Scholar), and more recently by co-crystallization of C subunit with the peptide derived from the inhibitory segment of PKI, PKI-(5-24) (4Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 414-420Google Scholar, 12Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 407-414Google Scholar). Although many natural substrates for PKA conform to the consensus sequence of Arg-Arg-Xaa-Ser(P)-Xaa, many others contain only a single basic residue at either P−3 or P−2, and/or have additional basic residues more amino-terminal to P−3 (13Zetterqvist O. Ragnarsson U. Engstrom L. Kemp B.E. Peptides and Protein Phosphorylation. CRC Press, Orlando, FL1990: 171-188Google Scholar). Basic residues are frequently found at the P−4, P−6, or both positions in PKA substrates (13Zetterqvist O. Ragnarsson U. Engstrom L. Kemp B.E. Peptides and Protein Phosphorylation. CRC Press, Orlando, FL1990: 171-188Google Scholar), yet other substrates contain a cluster of four basic residues at the P−2 through P−5 positions (14Hemmings Jr., H.C. Williams K.R. Konigsberg W.H. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14486-14490Google Scholar, 15Chessa G. Borin G. Marchiori F. Meggio F. Brunati A.M. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 135: 609-614Google Scholar, 16Murphy B.J. Rossie S. De Jongh K.S. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27355-27362Google Scholar). Both P−4 and P−6 basic residues are important recognition factors for phosphorylation of the peptide derived from rabbit skeletal muscle phosphorylase kinase (β subunit) (17Zetterqvist O. Ragnarsson U. FEBS Lett. 1982; 139: 287-290Google Scholar). A similar pattern of basic amino acid residues is noted in the PKA regulatory proteins. A P−6 Arg residue is present in the RII subunit substrate site and in the PKI pseudosubstrate site, while the RI subunit has a cluster of four Arg residues at the P−2 through P−5 positions. The PKI P−6 Arg is crucial for potent inhibition of C subunit (4Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 414-420Google Scholar, 11Cheng H.-C. Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Smith A.J. Misconi L. Van Patten S.M. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 989-992Google Scholar). The contribution made toward C subunit inhibition by the RII subunit P−6 Arg residue, or the RI subunit P−4 and P−5 Arg residues, has not been investigated previously. Based on the evidence above, it is possible that each of the four Arg residues in the pseudosubstrate region of RI subunit interacts with an acidic residue(s) in the active site of C subunit. The P+1 residue is frequently, but not exclusively, a large hydrophobic residue in PKA substrates (13Zetterqvist O. Ragnarsson U. Engstrom L. Kemp B.E. Peptides and Protein Phosphorylation. CRC Press, Orlando, FL1990: 171-188Google Scholar). Studies with synthetic peptide substrates based on the phosphorylation sequence of pyruvate kinase (Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser(P)-Val) suggested that a large hydrophobic residue at the P+1 position (Phe, Leu, or Ile) is a positive determinant for substrate phosphorylation (13Zetterqvist O. Ragnarsson U. Engstrom L. Kemp B.E. Peptides and Protein Phosphorylation. CRC Press, Orlando, FL1990: 171-188Google Scholar). However, small (e.g. Gly), charged (e.g. Lys, Arg, or Glu), or hydrophilic residues (e.g. Ser) at this position are negative determinants for phosphorylation of these peptide substrates by C subunit (13Zetterqvist O. Ragnarsson U. Engstrom L. Kemp B.E. Peptides and Protein Phosphorylation. CRC Press, Orlando, FL1990: 171-188Google Scholar). The P+1 residue is conserved as Ile or Val in the autoinhibitory domains of all known sequences of PKA and PKG, and as Ile in PKI (10Scott J.D. Fischer E.H. Demaille J.G. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4379-4383Google Scholar). PKI peptide analog studies (18Glass D.B. Cheng H.-C. Mende-Mueller L. Reed J. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8802-8810Google Scholar) and the crystal structure of the C subunit·PKI-(5-24) complex (4Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 414-420Google Scholar) demonstrated the importance of a large P+1 hydrophobic residue for potent inhibition of C subunit (18Glass D.B. Cheng H.-C. Mende-Mueller L. Reed J. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8802-8810Google Scholar). The contribution of the RI subunit P+1 hydrophobic residue toward C subunit inhibition has not been investigated to date. The Glu at the P+4 position is invariant in the regulatory domain of all known sequences of PKA and PKG. Mutational analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae C subunit identified three Lys residues required for recognition of the yeast R subunit (19Gibbs C.S. Knighton D.R. Sowadski J.M. Taylor S.S. Zoller M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4806-4814Google Scholar); the corresponding residues in mammalian C subunit (Lys189, Lys213, Lys217) lie distal to the carboxyl-terminal residue (P+3) of bound PKI-(5-24) (4Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 414-420Google Scholar, 12Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 407-414Google Scholar), and one of these Lys residues could interact with the P+4 Glu. The importance of the P+4 Glu in the autoinhibitory domain has not been previously addressed. Using truncation and site-directed mutagenesis, the present report addresses the importance of the P−5,P−4, P−3, P−2, P+1 and P+4 residues for autoinhibition of type Iα PKA. The pT7-7 vector was from S. Tabor (Harvard University, Cambridge, MA) (20Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Google Scholar, 21Tabor S. Ausubel F.A. Brent R.

The Sequenase Version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit was from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Restriction endonucleases were from Promega, New England Biolabs, or Boehringer Mannheim. [α-32P]dATP and [2,8-3H]cAMP were from Amersham, [γ-32P]ATP was from DuPont NEN, and 8-N3-[32P]cAMP was from ICN. Bovine serum albumin (essentially fatty acid-free, catalogue no.

Cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. P-81 phosphocellulose paper was from Whatman. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. C subunit was prepared from bovine heart according to the method of Sugden et al. (23Sugden P.H. Holladay L.A. Reimann E.M. Corbin J.D. Biochem. J. 1976; 159: 409-422Google Scholar). N6-H2N(CH2)2-cAMP was synthesized according to Dills et al. (24Dills W.L. Goodwin C.D. Lincoln T.M. Beavo J.A. Bechtel P.J. Corbin J.D. Krebs E.G. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1979; 10: 199-217Google Scholar) and was purified by Sephadex G-25 chromatography (4.5 × 16.5 cm) in 50 mM NH4HCO3, pH 7.8, according to Corbin et al. (25Corbin J.D. Gettys T.W. Blackmore P.F. Beebe S.J. Francis S.H. Glass D.B. Redmon J.B. Sheorain V.S. Landiss L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 74-82Google Scholar). N6-H2N(CH2)2-cAMP-Sepharose was prepared according to Dills et al. (24Dills W.L. Goodwin C.D. Lincoln T.M. Beavo J.A. Bechtel P.J. Corbin J.D. Krebs E.G. Adv.

A T7 RNA polymerase/promoter system, pT7-7, was used for bacterial overexpression of the type Iα R subunit. The RI subunit cDNA was subcloned into pT7-7 as described previously (28Shabb J.B. Poteet C.E. Kapphahn M.A. Muhonen W.M. Baker N.E. Corbin J.D. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2100-2106Google Scholar) to create pT7RNI and pT7R. pT7RNI, an intermediate vector, contained the entire RI subunit cDNA, which was out-of-frame. pT7R was the wild type (WT) RI subunit bacterial expression vector in which the RI subunit start codon was mutated to a NdeI site to allow direct in-frame fusion with the pT7-7 start codon, also encoded by a NdeI restriction site. KS(−)R was created for use in oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis by subcloning the 1118-base pair (bp) SacI-SalI fragment of pT7RNI (encoding all but 52 base pairs from the 5′ end of the RI subunit cDNA) into the SacI-SalI fragment (2882 bp) of the M13-derived phagemid, pBluescript KS(−). Synthetic oligonucleotides 1-13 (Table I) were used to mutate KS(−)R by site-directed mutagenesis using the Kunkel method (29Kunkel T.A. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 8.1.1-8.1.6Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides 1-5 were used to mutate the KS(−)R sequence on the 5′ side of the Arg92, Arg93, Arg94, Arg95, and Gly96 codons to a NdeI site (CATATG). Oligonucleotides 6-8 were used to create a NdeI site 5′ to the Arg93 or Arg94 codons, and to mutate the codons for Arg94 (CGA) or Arg95 (GCG) to Ala (GCT) in KS(−)R. Introduction of a NdeI restriction site allowed for direct in-frame fusion with the NdeI restriction site encompassing the pT7R start codon, thus deleting the 5′ segment of the RI subunit cDNA. Oligonucleotides 9-13 were used to mutate the Ile98 codon to Val (GTT), Ala (GCT), Gly (GGT), and Gln (CAG), and the Glu101 codon to Ala (GCT) in KS(−)R. A 700-bp PstI fragment, released from the previously described pUC13-based RI subunit expression vector (pUC13R) (30Wolfe L. Woodford T.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Konijn T.M.

The 760-bp PvuII-EcoRI fragments were isolated from KS(−)R mutants 9-13 and subcloned into the large PvuII-EcoRI fragment of pT7R to create functional mutant pT7R expression vectors encoding full-length RI subunits (I98V, I98A, I98G, I98Q, and E101A). The NaeI-XhoI fragment from M13.PstR mutant 14 (351 bp) was subcloned into the large NaeI-XhoI fragment of pUC13R. The 518-bp PvuII-XhoI fragment of pUC13R was subcloned into the large pT7R PvuII-XhoI fragment to create a functional mutant pT7R expression vector encoding the full-length E101Q RI subunit. The integrity of the entire cDNA segment that was subjected to the mutagenesis procedure, including the cloning and mutation sites, was verified directly in the pT7R expression vectors by dideoxynucleotide sequencing of double-stranded DNA for mutants 1-12 and 14. DNA sequencing of mutants 1-8 and 14 was performed using a commercially available kit (Sequenase version 2.0, U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and mutants 9-12 were sequenced using an Automated Biosystems, Inc. model 373A DNA sequencer in the Cancer Center DNA Core facility of Vanderbilt University. The cloning sites for mutant 13 were verified by digestion with PvuII and EcoRI, and the mutation was verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing using the aforementioned kit. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with wild-type or mutant pT7R vectors the day prior to expression. Bacterial expression was performed as described in 28Shabb J.B. Poteet C.E.

Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2100-2106Google Scholar, except that the media contained 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin and the cells were pelleted at 5000 × g for 15 min each time. The bacterial pellets were stored at −20°C until homogenization and were viable for more than 1 year when stored in this manner. Initially, the expression cultures yielded ∼3-5 mg of RI subunit/liter of culture (5-h induction). Due to the necessity for greater quantities of protein, the expression time was later increased to 36 h, yielding 10-80 mg of RI subunit/liter culture. Bacteria were disrupted as described previously (31Shabb J.B. Ng L. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16031-16034Google Scholar) except that the homogenization buffer was 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mMβ-mercaptoethanol (KPEM) plus 50 mM benzamidine (KPEMB) and 2.3 mM 3′,5′-cyclic inosine monophosphate (cIMP). cIMP was included during the homogenization process to promote exchange with the cAMP bound to RI subunits and thus increase the subsequent efficiency of RI subunit binding to N6-H2N-(CH2)2-cAMP Sepharose affinity resin during purification. Free cyclic nucleotide was removed from the extract by fractionation on a Sephadex G-25 superfine column (2.75 × 26 cm) equilibrated in KPEMB. Protein-containing fractions (∼70 ml) were collected and clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The extract was chromatographed on a 1.5 × 3.5-cm N6-H2N(CH2)2-cAMP Sepharose column (equilibrated in KPEMB) at a flow rate of ∼1 drop/12 s, or was divided and chromatographed over two columns (1.5 × 3.5 cm and 1.5 × 11.5 cm). In most instances, the flow-through was passed over the column(s) two or three times. RI subunits were isolated by the method of Dills (24Dills W.L. Goodwin C.D. Lincoln T.M. Beavo J.A. Bechtel P.J. Corbin J.D. Krebs E.G. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1979; 10: 199-217Google Scholar) with the exceptions noted in 28Shabb J.B. Poteet C.E. Kapphahn M.A. Muhonen W.M. Baker N.E. Corbin J.D. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2100-2106Google Scholar. In addition, 30 mM cIMP was used to elute the affinity resin instead of 10 mM. Fractions containing protein (detected by Bio-Rad protein assay) were pooled and concentrated on a Centriprep-30 concentrator (Amicon) to a final volume of approximately 0.6 ml. Full-length and truncated RI subunits were resolved from proteolytic fragments and from free cyclic nucleotide on a Sephadex G-100 superfine column (0.9 × 58.5 cm) equilibrated in KPEM containing 0.2 M NaCl. Fractions were assayed for [3H]cAMP binding activity, and cIMP elution was measured by UV absorbance at 248 nm. The fractions containing RI subunit were pooled and concentrated on Centricon-30 devices (Amicon), followed by a desalting step with KPEM. The full-length and truncated RI subunits were >95% pure according to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Native type Iα R subunit was purified from a bovine lung homogenate that was primarily used for the purification of cGMP-binding, cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase (cG-BPDE) (32McAllister-Lucas L.M. Haik T.L. Colbran J.L. Sonnenburg W.K. Seger D. Turko I.V. Beavo J.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30671-30679Google Scholar) and type Iα PKG (33Lincoln T.M. Dills Jr., W.L. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4269-4275Google Scholar) or it was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle according to 34Rannels S.R. Beasley A. Corbin J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 55-62Google Scholar. When using bovine lung homogenate, protein extract was adsorbed to DEAE-cellulose followed by batch elution with 0.1 M NaCl in 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 1 mM EDTA, and 25 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. After discarding the initial 0.5 liter of eluate, the next 1.5 liters of eluate was collected for cG-BPDE purification, and the following 1 liter was collected for purification of PKG and R subunit. This 1 liter of extract was slowly loaded onto N6-hexyl-cAMP-Sepharose (5 × 2.75 cm) equilibrated in KPEM containing 25 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (KPEM25) at 4°C. The affinity resin was washed with 2 liters of KPEM25 containing 2 M NaCl, followed by 600 ml of KPEM25. The column was batch-eluted with 10 mM cGMP in KPEM25. Following elution of the bulk of PKG, monitored by SDS-PAGE of elutions, the affinity resin was batch-eluted with aliquots of KPEM25 containing 10 mM cAMP to elute types Iα and IIα R subunit. Fractions containing both types of R subunit were pooled and chromatographed on DEAE Sephacel (0.9 × 5.5 cm) equilibrated in KPEM containing 0.05 M NaCl at 4°C. Types I and II R subunit were resolved by eluting the DEAE column with a linear salt gradient (0.05-0.35 M NaCl) in KPEM. The RI subunit was further purified by sucrose gradient (5-20%) centrifugation to separate it from PKG contaminants. The RI subunit fractions from five sucrose gradients were pooled and concentrated on a Centriprep-30 device. The protein was then chromatographed on a 0.9 × 58.5-cm Sephadex G-100 superfine column (equilibrated in KPEM containing 0.2 M NaCl) to separate full-length RI subunit from proteolytic fragments of RI subunit and PKG. RI subunit fractions were pooled and frozen at −20°C in 50% KPEM and 50% glycerol. Native RI subunit from bovine lung contained saturating levels of cAMP as determined by assay of cAMP content (25Corbin J.D. Gettys T.W. Blackmore P.F. Beebe S.J. Francis S.H. Glass D.B. Redmon J.B. Sheorain V.S. Landiss L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 74-82Google Scholar), and contained ∼5-10% PKG proteolytic fragments as detected by SDS-PAGE. Native RI subunit (purified from bovine lung, above) was concentrated and the glycerol was removed by multiple centrifugations and dilutions on a Centricon-30 device. cIMP (at a final concentration of 1.1 mM) was added to the RI subunit solution (10:1 ratio of cIMP to cyclic nucleotide binding sites), and the solution was stored at 4°C for several weeks to facilitate cAMP/cIMP exchange. RI subunit was then chromatographed on a Sephadex G-25 column (0.9 × 13 cm) equilibrated in KPEM to resolve protein from free cyclic nucleotide. cIMP-saturated RI subunit was pooled and concentrated using a Centricon-30 device. 287 μg of WT or mutant RI subunit was denatured at 95°C for 2 h in the presence of 13.5 mM HCl (final pH ∼2-3) to release cyclic nucleotide. The solution was briefly centrifuged at 15-min intervals during incubation. Following neutralization, the sample was chromatographed at 23°C on a Sephadex G-25 superfine column (0.9 × 13 cm) equilibrated in KPEM to purify cyclic nucleotide (25Corbin J.D. Gettys T.W. Blackmore P.F. Beebe S.J. Francis S.H. Glass D.B. Redmon J.B. Sheorain V.S. Landiss L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 74-82Google Scholar). cIMP elution was quantitated using the cIMP extinction coefficient (ε1 mM = 12.3 absorbance units at 248 nm). The released cyclic nucleotide was verified to be cIMP by a UV absorbance scan at 220-320 nm. The NH2-terminal sequence of various proteins was determined by sequential Edman degradation. The analyses were performed by the core sequencing facility at the University of Washington, Seattle, WA and by the Peptide Sequencing and Amino Acid Analysis Shared Resource at Vanderbilt University. The cyclic nucleotide binding assay was used to identify RI subunit fractions eluted from gel filtration columns and to quantitate purified RI subunits. [3H]cAMP binding activity was measured as described previously (34Rannels S.R. Beasley A. Corbin J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 55-62Google Scholar) except that 1.1 μM [3H]cAMP (2800-5500 cpm/pmol cAMP) was used, and the reaction mixture was diluted with 2.5 ml of ice-cold 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 1 mM EDTA (KPE) and the tubes were each rinsed with 2.5 ml of KPE. RI subunit was quantitated based on a stoichiometry of 2 mol of cAMP/mol of RI subunit monomer. [3H]cAMP dissociation assays were performed as described previously (35Shabb J.B. Buzzeo B.D. Ng L. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24320-24326Google Scholar) using 0.2 μM [3H]cAMP (3 × 104 cpm/pmol) and 4 nM RI subunit in the equilibrium exchange reaction. A 500-fold molar excess of unlabeled cAMP was used in the dissociation reaction. Immediately before use, C subunit was diluted in Dilution Buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA)). A final concentration of 21 pM C subunit was preincubated with varying concentrations of WT or mutant RI subunit (in KPEM) in Kinase Mix (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 20 mM magnesium acetate, 0.1 mM ATP, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, and 0.1 mM isobutylmethylxanthine) for 15-30 min at 30°C. The protein kinase assay was initiated by the addition of a final concentration of 81 μM Kemptide, 0.071 mM ATP, and [γ-32P]ATP (1000 cpm/pmol). The total assay volume was 35 μl. Following a 60-120-min incubation at 30°C, the reaction was terminated by spotting 20 μl of reaction mixture onto P-81 phosphocellulose paper and immediately placing the papers into 75 mM phosphoric acid. The P-81 papers were washed a minimum of five times in 75 mM phosphoric acid, dried and counted in 10 ml of non-aqueous scintillant, or counted by Cerenkov radiation. cIMP-saturated WT RI subunit (3.8 μM) and native C subunit (14.7 μM) were incubated for 30 min at 30°C in Kinase Mix containing 0.23 mM ATP and 10 mg/ml BSA (final volume = 15 μl). 1 μl of reaction was diluted into 19 μl of Dilution Buffer and saved for subsequent assay of kinase activity (± cAMP). The remainder of the reaction was cooled on ice and then loaded onto a Sephadex CM50 column (0.9 × 0.5 cm) equilibrated in KPEM at 4°C. Approximately 1 ml of KPEM was a"
https://openalex.org/W2073912424,"Mutations have been introduced at residues Arg-38 or His-42 in horseradish peroxidase isoenzyme C (HRPC) in order to probe the role of these key distal residues in the reaction of ferrous HRPC with dioxygen. The association and dissociation rate constants for dioxygen binding to His-42 → Leu, His-42 → Arg, Arg-38 → Leu, Arg-38 → Lys, Arg-38 → Ser, and Arg-38 → Gly variants have been measured using stopped-flow spectrophotometry. Replacement of His-42 by Leu or Arg increases the oxygen binding rate constant by less than an order of magnitude, whereas changing the polar distal Arg-38 causes increases of more than 2 orders. These results demonstrate that His-42 and Arg-38 impede the binding of dioxygen to ferrous HRPC, presumably by steric and/or electrostatic interactions in the distal heme cavity. Recombinant HRPC oxyperoxidase reverted slowly to the ferric state with no spectrophotometrically detectable intermediates and with an apparent first-order rate constant of 9.0 × 10−3 s−1, which is essentially the same as that for the native, glycosylated enzyme. This reaction was accelerated when His-42 was replaced by Leu or Arg (kdecay = 0.10 and 0.07 s−1, respectively) presumably due to the loss of the hydrogen bond between the His-42 imidazole and the bound dioxygen. Substitution of Arg-38 by Leu, Lys, or Gly also produced a less stable oxyperoxidase (kdecay = 0.22, 0.20, and 0.58 s−1, respectively). However, with the Arg-38 → Ser variant, a transient intermediate, proposed to be a ferric-superoxide complex, was detected by rapid-scan stopped-flow spectrophotometry during the conversion of oxyperoxidase to the ferric state. This variant also exhibits an unusually high affinity for dioxygen. It is proposed that Arg-38 interacts with the bound dioxygen to promote superoxide character, thereby stabilizing the oxyperoxidase state and making the binding of dioxygen to ferrous HRPC essentially irreversible. We conclude that Arg-38 and His-42 not only promote the heterolytic cleavage of bound hydrogen peroxide to form compound I but also decrease the lability of the ferrous enzyme-dioxygen complex in order to suppress the formation of the inactive ferrous state.

Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 388-394Google Scholar). It is able to utilize hydrogen peroxide to catalyze the one-electron oxidation of a wide range of aromatic substrates. Peroxidase action involves 2e− oxidation of the enzyme by hydrogen peroxide to give an intermediate known as compound I. This then reverts to the resting enzyme via two successive 1e− reactions with reducing substrate molecules, the first yielding a second enzyme intermediate, compound II (2Dunford H.B. Stillman J.S. Coord. Chem. 1976; 19: 187-251Google Scholar). A third enzyme intermediate, compound III, is also observed in the reaction of HRP with an excess of hydrogen peroxide (3Keilin D. Hartree E.F. Biochem. J. 1951; 49: 88-104Google Scholar). This compound, the peroxidase analogue of oxymyoglobin and oxyhemoglobin, does not normally participate in the peroxidatic cycle of HRP (2Dunford H.B. Stillman J.S. Coord. Chem. 1976; 19: 187-251Google Scholar). The spectrum and reactivity pattern of compound III correspond to those expected for an Fe(II)-O2 adduct or oxyperoxidase (4Wittenberg J.B. Noble R.W. Wittenberg B.A. Antonini E. Brunori M. Wyman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 626-634Google Scholar). Oxyperoxidase can be formed in four different ways: (i) addition of a large excess of H2O2 to the native ferric enzyme, (ii) reduction of native ferric enzyme to ferroperoxidase followed by the addition of dioxygen, (iii) reaction of H2O2 with compound II, and (iv) addition of superoxide anion to native ferric peroxidase (2Dunford H.B. Stillman J.S. Coord. Chem. 1976; 19: 187-251Google Scholar). The formation of oxyperoxidase from ferrous peroxidase and dioxygen follows second-order kinetics with a calculated rate constant of 5.8 × 104M−1 s−1 at pH 7.0 and 20°C (4Wittenberg J.B. Noble R.W. Wittenberg B.A. Antonini E. Brunori M. Wyman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 626-634Google Scholar). The mechanisms of oxy-HRPC (5Tamura M. Yamazaki I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1972; 71: 311-319Google Scholar, 6Phelps C.F. Antonini E. Giacometti G. Brunori M. Biochem. J. 1974; 141: 265-272Google Scholar) and lignin-oxyperoxidase (7Wariishi H. Gold M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2070-2077Google Scholar) decomposition have also been studied. In both cases the oxyperoxidase form reverted slowly to the native ferric state with no spectroscopically detectable intermediates. This contrasts with the reactivity of ferrous yeast cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP) with dioxygen, which differs dramatically from that of other peroxidases. Photolysis of the CcP(II)-CO complex in the presence of oxygen converts the enzyme to a product with an absorption spectrum and an EPR radical signal at g = 2.00 that were identical to those of compound I formed by the reaction of ferric CcP with hydrogen peroxide (8Wittenberg B.A. Kampa L.

Hemoproteins show great diversity in their biological functions while retaining an essentially unaltered prosthetic group, iron protoporphyrin IX. Although key catalytic residues in the active site of peroxidases are highly conserved (10Welinder K.G. Mazza G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 73: 353-358Google Scholar), in the context of the present paper it is useful to compare HRPC with CcP. The complete three-dimensional structure of CcP is known from crystallographic data at 1.7-Å resolution (11Poulos T.L. Kraut J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8199-8205Google Scholar). Recombinant native CcP and several variants have also been available for structural and mechanistic studies (12Erman J.E. Vitello L.B. Miller M.A. Shaw A. Brown K.A. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9798-9806Google Scholar, 13Vitello L.B. Erman J.E. Miller M.A. Wang J. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9807-9818Google Scholar). Although the primary structure of CcP has only 18% identity with that of HRPC (14Welinder K.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 497-504Google Scholar), over 80% of this sequence identity is centered around two highly conserved residues, the distal and the proximal histidines. An arginine residue in the distal heme pocket is also conserved in peroxidases. Distal and proximal histidines are also conserved in the globins, which react with hydrogen peroxide much slower than do peroxidases. This differential reactivity with hydrogen peroxide has been ascribed to the distal arginine, which has no equivalent in the globins (15Mims M.P. Porras A.G. Olson J.S. Noble R.W. Peterson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14219-14232Google Scholar). Recent studies with CcP showed that the guanidinium side chain of Arg-48 is not absolutely required for the heterolytic cleavage of peroxide (12Erman J.E. Vitello L.B. Miller M.A. Shaw A. Brown K.A. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9798-9806Google Scholar, 13Vitello L.B. Erman J.E. Miller M.A. Wang J. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9807-9818Google Scholar, 16Erman J.E. Vitello L.B. Miller M.A. Kraut J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 6592-6593Google Scholar), although we have shown that in HRPC this residue does play an important role in facilitating the binding of peroxide and modulating its subsequent reactivity (17Rodriguez-Lopez J.N. Smith A.T. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4023-4030Google Scholar, 18Rodriguez-Lopez J.N. Smith A.T. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 136-142Google Scholar). Miller et al. (19Miller M.A. Shaw A. Kraut J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 524-531Google Scholar) determined the crystal structure of the Fe(II)-O2 complex formed by a yeast CcP mutant (Trp-191 → Phe). The refined structure showed that dioxygen forms a hydrogen bond with the imidazole side chain of the conserved distal histidine, but not with the guanidinium group of the conserved distal arginine. The recent availability of site-directed mutants of HRPC has now allowed us to investigate the role of Arg-38 and His-42 in the formation of oxy-HRPC. The results also provide further insights into the origins of the reactivity differences of HRP and CcP oxyperoxidases (9Miller M.A. Bandyopadhyay D. Mauro J.M. Traylor T.G. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2789-2797Google Scholar, 19Miller M.A. Shaw A. Kraut J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 524-531Google Scholar) and the relationship between oxyperoxidases and oxyglobins (15Mims M.P. Porras A.G. Olson J.S. Noble R.W. Peterson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14219-14232Google Scholar, 19Miller M.A. Shaw A. Kraut J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 524-531Google Scholar). HRPC (type 4B) was purchased from Biozyme Ltd., United Kingdom (Blaenavon, Gwent, UK) and used without further purification. Construction of the gene, expression and purification of HRPC*, H42L, H42R, R38L, and R38K have been described previously (17Rodriguez-Lopez J.N. Smith A.T. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14687-14692Google Scholar). Construction of R38S and R38G genes was carried out as described previously for the R38L mutant (17Rodriguez-Lopez J.N. Smith A.T. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4023-4030Google Scholar), except that a Ser (TCA) or Gly (GGT) codon was introduced at position 126. The spectral properties of the enzymes used in this study are given in Table I. The specific activities (units mg−1) of the HRP preparations used were 920 for HRPC, 930 for HRPC*, 0.2 for H42L, 5.0 for H42R, 5.2 for R38L, 47.7 for R38G, 7.1 for R38S, and 2.9 for R38K. Activities were measured as described previously with 0.3 mM ABTS (2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazolinesulfonic acid) and 2.5 mM H2O2 (20Smith A.T. Santama N. Dacey S. Edwards M. Bray R.C.

Open table in a new tab Fully reduced native HRPC and its variants were prepared by incubation of enzyme with sodium dithionite for several minutes in a buffer of 0.1 M sodium phosphate at pH 7.0 until no further change in the reduced Soret band could be detected. Since ferroperoxidase reacts rapidly with dioxygen, the following procedures were carried out in an anaerobic glove box operating under N2 with less than 1 ppm of O2. The excess sodium dithionite was removed from the ferroperoxidase by passing the solution through a Sephadex G-25 column that had been equilibrated with deoxygenated buffer. Anaerobic rapid-scan stopped-flow studies were performed using a Hi-Tech SF-51 stopped-flow spectrophotometer equipped with a xenon lamp, 360 nm filter, and a diode-array detection system (MG-6000, Hi-Tech Scientific, Salisbury, UK). Single wavelength experiments were carried out with the same instrument equipped with a tungsten lamp. Enzyme stock and buffer solutions (0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.0) were deoxygenated for 30 min by repeated evacuation and back filling with nitrogen on a vacuum line before transfer into the glove box. Air- or oxygen-saturated buffers were transferred into the anaerobic box in hermetically sealed serum vials. Oxygen concentrations were varied from 20 to 600 μM by premixing the air- or oxygen-saturated buffer with the deoxygenated buffer in syringes with no gas head space to avoid loss of O2 from the solution. Data were recorded through a RS232 interface on a microcomputer and analyzed by fitting absorbance versus time curves to exponential functions using a least-squares minimization program supplied by Hi-Tech Scientific Ltd. Temperature was controlled at 25°C using a Techne C-400 circulating bath with a heater-cooler also installed in the anaerobic box. Oxyperoxidase solutions were prepared as described above. The disappearance of wild-type and mutant oxyperoxidases and the appearance of native ferric enzymes were followed at their respective Soret maximum indicated in Table II, Table I., respectively.Table IIAbsorption maxima for the oxyperoxidases used in this study determined in 0.1 M sodium-phosphate, pH 7.0ProteinAbsorption maximanmHRPC417543577HRPC*417543577H42L416541575H42R416543579R38K415542578R38L416542578R38S411541575R38G416540578 Open table in a new tab Addition of molecular oxygen to ferrous HRPC resulted in the rapid formation of oxyperoxidase with absorption maxima at 417, 543, and 577 nm (Table II) as described previously by Wittenberg et al. (4Wittenberg J.B. Noble R.W. Wittenberg B.A. Antonini E. Brunori M. Wyman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 626-634Google Scholar). The reaction of ferrous HRPC with oxygen was followed at 417 nm. The observed first-order rate constant was directly proportional to the initial oxygen concentration (results not shown). At pH 7.0 and 25°C, the oxyperoxidase subsequently reverted over a period of minutes to the native ferric state (Reaction R1). To study the kinetics of this reaction, the disappearance of oxy-HRPC and the appearance of native HRPC were followed at 417 and 403 nm, respectively. The rate constant (kdecay) was determined by fitting the absorbance versus time curves to a single exponential function and was found to be independent of oxygen concentration (Table III).

Open table in a new tab The dependences of the pseudo-first-order rate constants on the initial concentration of oxygen with kon[O2] + koff> kdecay in theory should yield the values of kon and koff. The slope of the line should give the value of kon and its intercept with the ordinate axis koff. However, the intercepts are very near to zero, leading to inaccuracy in the determination of koff (data not shown). Similar results were obtained for the reaction of oxygen with the non-glycosylated recombinant HRPC*. The kinetics of formation and decay of the oxyperoxidase formed from recombinant enzyme yielded essentially the same rate constants as obtained for the glycosylated native enzyme (Table III). The lack of glycosylation in the recombinant enzyme therefore did not affect the kinetic parameters for the reaction of HRPC with the small ligand oxygen. The distal histidine of heme proteins such as myoglobin and hemoglobin is thought to influence the affinity of diatomic ligands bound at the sixth coordination position of the heme. Structural and kinetic studies indicate that CO and O2 binding are destabilized by the steric hindrance of the distal histidine (15Mims M.P. Porras A.G. Olson J.S. Noble R.W. Peterson J.A. J. Biol.

Davies G.J. Wilkinson A.J. Brancaccio A. Cutruzzola F. Allocatelli C.T. Brunori M. Li T. Brantley R.E. Carver T.E. Eich R.F. Singleton E. Olson J.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8715-8725Google Scholar). Recently, we have reported a significant increase in the second-order rate constant for CO binding to HRPC mutants in which the distal histidine had been replaced by leucine or arginine (22Meunier B. Rodriguez-Lopez J.N. Smith A.T. Thorneley R.N.F. Rich P.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14687-14692Google Scholar). However, a distal histidine residue can also stabilize adducts by forming a hydrogen bond, as shown by neutron diffraction studies with oxymyoglobin (26Phillips S.E.V. Schoenborn B.P. Nature. 1981; 292: 81-82Google Scholar). This interaction is critical for globins because it causes O2 to bind sufficiently tightly for efficient storage and transport while discriminating against the binding of carbon monoxide in order to decrease its toxicity (15Mims M.P. Porras A.G. Olson J.S. Noble R.W. Peterson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14219-14232Google Scholar). The crystal structure of oxy-CcP also shows a hydrogen bond between His-52 and bound dioxygen (19Miller M.A. Shaw A. Kraut J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 524-531Google Scholar). We have therefore prepared the H42L and H42R variants of HRPC* and studied the effect on the kinetics of dioxygen binding to the ferrous forms of the enzyme. The spectrum of the oxyperoxidase form of H42L was similar to that of the wild-type enzyme with absorbance maxima at 416, 541, and 575 nm (Table II). This compound autoxidized to the ferric form with isosbestic points at 408, 467, 524 and 598 nm (Fig. 1) and with a decay constant approximately 12 times faster than for the wild-type oxyperoxidase. The decay constant was also independent of the oxygen concentration (Table III). Similar results were obtained for the decomposition of the H42R oxyperoxidase (Table II, Table III.). The reactions of ferrous H42L and H42R with oxygen gave single exponential absorbance changes with pseudo-first-order rate constants that exhibited a linear dependence on the initial oxygen concentration (Fig. 2). The bimolecular rate constants for H42L and H42R were 6- and 2-fold higher, respectively, than that for wild-type enzyme (Table III). Unlike the data for the native enzyme forms, the ordinate intercepts for the mutants were statistically significant due to higher koff values (five determinations at each of the oxygen concentrations). This allowed the values of koff and the equilibrium constant for oxygen binding to both mutants to be calculated (Table III). The substitution of His-42 by Leu or Arg produced an increase in both the rates of binding and dissociation, resulting in a net decrease in the affinity for oxygen, i.e. less stable oxyperoxidases.Fig. 2Dependence of the apparent first-order rate constant (kobs) for dioxygen binding to (•) H42L and (□) H42R on oxygen concentration at pH 7.0 and 25°C. kobs was obtained by fitting the increase in absorbance at 416 nm versus time to a single exponential function.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Two pieces of evidence suggest that the distal arginine impedes the reaction of ferroperoxidase with diatomic ligands such as O2 and CO. First, proteins designed to react with oxygen such as myoglobins and hemoglobins have an apolar residue at the position corresponding to that of the distal arginine in peroxidases (27Poulos T.L. Finzel B.C. Hearn M.T.L. Peptide and Protein Reviews. Marcel Dekker, New York1984: 115-171Google Scholar, 28English A.M. Tsaprailis G. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1995; 43: 79-125Google Scholar). Second, replacing Arg-38 by Leu in ferrous HRPC increases the affinity for CO by 3 orders of magnitude relative to native enzyme (22Meunier B. Rodriguez-Lopez J.N. Smith A.T. Thorneley R.N.F. Rich P.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14687-14692Google Scholar). In order to better understand the role of Arg-38 in the binding of oxygen to ferrous HRPC, we have replaced it by other amino acids with side chains of different lengths and/or polarity and determined the effect on the kinetics of oxygen binding (Table III). Simple monophasic time courses were observed for oxygen binding to each of these mutant enzymes. Replacement of Arg-38 by Leu, Lys, or Gly had similar effects on both kon and koff (Fig. 3). There was a progressive increase in the observed bimolecular rate constant for oxygen binding in the order wild-type < R38K < R38L < R38G. The value for the R38G mutant was increased by nearly 2 orders of magnitude relative to the wild-type enzyme. However, a more than 500-fold compensating increase in the dissociation constants (koff) for each of the mutants resulted in a net lower affinity for O2 than the native enzyme (Table III). The spectra of the Arg-38 variant oxyperoxidases were all similar to that obtained for the native enzyme (Table II). The R38S mutant bound oxygen 50 times tighter than any one of the other Arg-38 variants (Fig. 3). The low KD results from both an increase in the second-order association rate constant (kon) and a decrease in the dissociation rate constant (koff) (Table III). Although R38S oxyperoxidase has a similar absorbance spectrum to that of native oxy-HRPC, it does exhibit a 6-nm displacement of the Soret band maximum to 411 nm. This suggests that the environment of the bound oxygen has been significantly perturbed by the introduction of a serine residue at position 38. Fig. 4 shows a linear decrease in the logarithm of the second-order rate constant for oxygen binding to each Arg-38 variant as a function of the calculated side chain volumes of each of the residues substituting for arginine at position 38. This behavior is entirely consistent with the side chains of the residues at position 38 sterically hindering oxygen binding. However, a purely steric effect clearly does not explain the deviance of the point for the native enzyme with an arginine at position 38 and suggests electrostatic factors associated with this positively charged residue are important. We discuss below the structural and mechanistic significance of this observation. Table III shows the effect of various substitutions of Arg-38 on the stability of the oxyperoxidase complex. The R38L oxyperoxidase prepared by the reaction of ferrous enzyme with O2 reverted directly to the native ferric enzyme with a half-life of 3 s. Similar results were observed for the the R38K (half-life 3.5 s) and R38G (half-life 1.2 s) variants. However, the oxyperoxidase formed by the reaction of R38S ferrous enzyme with dioxygen reverted to native ferric enzyme with the accumulation of a spectroscopically detectable transient intermediate shown by the single wavelength stopped-flow trace in Fig. 5. Rapid-scan stopped-flow spectrophotometry reveals the formation of a transient species with a Soret maximum at 406 nm (the same as that for the resting enzyme) but with a higher extinction coefficient (ε406 nm = 160 mM−1 cm−1; cf. 133 mM−1 cm−1 for native enzyme) (Fig. 6A). Moreover, this transient species has peaks at 499, 573, and 630 nm and a shoulder at 537 nm (Fig. 6B). This new intermediate was converted to ferric enzyme, as indicated by the decrease in the absorbance in the Soret region (Fig. 6C). Differences in the spectra between this new intermediate and that of the ferric enzyme are shown in Fig. 6B. A transient species, thought to be a ferric hydroperoxide complex (Fe(III)-OOH), with a spectrum similar to that shown in Fig. 6 (A-C) has been previously observed during the reaction of the R38L variant with hydrogen peroxide (17Rodriguez-Lopez J.N. Smith A.T. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4023-4030Google Scholar).Fig. 6Rapid-scan stopped-flow time course for the spontaneous decomposition of R38S oxyperoxidase in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 25°C. Panel A, the reaction was started by mixing ferrous R38S (2.0 μM) with oxygen (0.13 mM). The first scan was taken at 0.5 s and corresponds to R38S oxyperoxidase. Subsequent scans were at 2-s intervals. Panel B, spectrum a corresponds to the last spectrum in panel A (≈16.5 s) and spectrum b was taken at 150 s in the reaction and corresponds to ferric R38S. Panel C, as for panel A but the first spectrum was taken at 25 s and subsequent scans were at 20 s. The arrows show the direction of absorbance change with time.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Replacement of the distal His-42 by Leu or Arg produced a 6- and 2-fold increase in the association rate constants, respectively, whereas the replacement of the distal Arg-38 caused more dramatic increases of up to 100-fold (Table III). Since there do not appear to be any previous reports describing the role of His-42 and Arg-38 in the binding of oxygen to ferrous HRPC, it is only possible to discuss our data in the context of other oxygen-binding heme proteins. In pig and sperm whale myoglobins, substitutions of the distal histidine (His-64) by leucine produced a 7-fold increase in kon and a greater than 100-fold increase in koff, resulting in a dramatic loss of oxygen affinity in these variants (25Smerdon S.J.

https://openalex.org/W2044825224,"The incorporation of CN-hemin into three human adult apohemoglobin species (apohemoglobin, α-apohemoglobin, and apohemoglobin modified at its β93 sulfhydryl with p-hydroxymercuribenzoate) has been monitored at micromolar concentrations in 0.05 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 10°C. In all cases, Soret spectral blue shifts accompanied CN-protohemoglobin but not CN-deuterohemoglobin formation. This finding in conjunction with isofocusing studies provided evidence of a CN-protosemi-α-hemoglobin intermediate, the formation of which appeared to be a direct consequence of CN-protohemin-α heme pocket interactions. The kinetics of full reconstitution of CN-protohemoglobin and CN-deuterohemoglobin revealed four distinct phases that apparently correlated with heme insertion (Phase I), local structural rearrangement (Phase II), global conformational response (Phase III), and irreversible histidine iron bond formation (Phase IV). These phases exhibited rates of 7.8-22 × 107M−1 s−1, 0.19-0.23 s−1, 0.085-0.12 s−1, and 0.008-0.012 s −1, respectively. Partial (50%) reconstitution with CN-protohemin, in contrast, revealed only three kinetic phases (with Phase III missing) of heme incorporation into native and p-hydroxymercuribenzoate-modified apohemoglobin. Furthermore, the absence of Phase III slowed the rate of proximal bond formation. These findings support the premise that irreversible assembly of CN-protosemi-α-hemoglobin is deterred by the presence of a heme-free β partner, the consequence of which may be that intermolecular heme transfer is encouraged under conditions of heme deficiency in vivo.

The structural, functional, and subunit assembly properties of human hemoglobin have been intensely investigated (1Friedman F.K. Beychok S. Annu. Rev.

Not only is the mode(s) of combination of mitochondrial Fe-protoporphyrin IX (heme) with cytoplasmic nascent α and β polypeptide chains unknown, but the actual dimer precursor (or precursors) remain undefined. Three distinct pathways of hemoglobin tetramer assembly may be proposed, that of assembly through a heme-containing heterodimer (αhβh), a heme-globin pair (semihemoglobin; αhβo or αoβh), or a heme-free αβ dimer (apohemoglobin; αoβo). The detection of α hemoglobin (αh) and α apohemoglobin (αo) chains as well as semi-α-hemoglobin (αhβo) and apohemoglobin in vivo has served to strengthen the plausibility of these three assembly mechanisms (6Winterhalter K.H. Heywood D. Huehns E.R. Finch C.A. Br. J. Haematol. 1969; 16: 523-535Google Scholar, 7Shaeffer J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7473-7480Google Scholar). Gibson and Antonini (8Gibson Q.H. Antonini E. J.

Chem. 1963; 238: 1384-1388Google Scholar) carried out pioneering studies that involved the binding of a monomeric heme moiety to an apohemoglobin species isolated from normal adult hemolysate (Hb A). Their rapid kinetic investigations resulted in the development of a model which proposed that hemoglobin formation occurred via a reversible intermediate complex. Independent kinetic studies (10Chu A.H. Bucci E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3772-3776Google Scholar, 11Leutzinger Y. Beychok S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1983; 258: 4298-4303Google Scholar) have supported this classical model, which postulated a two-step kinetic mechanism involving a rapid second order heme insertion event followed by a slower first order process attributed to structural rearrangement and the irreversible formation of a histidine-iron bond. Experimental variables that altered the heme insertion process (meso- and deutero-derivatives of CN- or CO-heme) as well as those aimed at modulating apohemoglobin structural response (pH changes; introduction of polyanions) were explored, and no evidence of an ordered sequence (either α or β subunit) of heme binding was found. This was unexpected because detailed protein chemical studies (13Winterhalter K.H. Ioppolo C. Antonini E. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3790-3795Google Scholar, 14Javaherian K. Beychok S. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 37: 1-11Google Scholar, 15Lau P.-W. Asakura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6838-6843Google Scholar), which involved half-equivalency titration of apohemoglobin with heme, had led to the conclusion that α chains have a greater preference than their β chain counterparts for heme. Furthermore, Soret spectral kinetic studies focused on CO-heme (16Park R.Y. McDonald M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 522-527Google Scholar) and CN-hemin (17Kawamura-Konishi Y. Chiba K. Kihara H. Suzuki H. Eur. Biophys. J. 1992; 21: 85-92Google Scholar) binding to preassembled semi-hemoglobins (semi-hemoglobins prepared in vitro by heme-chain transfer; 18Cassoly R. Banerjee R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 19: 514-522Google Scholar) have further documented differences in the heme affinity of α and β chains. In this report, the incorporation of CN-protohemin and CN-deuterohemin into human apohemoglobins has been monitored, and results indicate that a significant difference in binding of α and β subunits of apohemoglobin does exist, a finding consistent with human hemoglobin assembly through a semi-α-hemoglobin intermediate in vitro and most probably in vivo. Human adult hemoglobin and its isolated α heme subunit were prepared (19Bucci E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 97-106Google Scholar) and characterized as previously reported (20McDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6487-6490Google Scholar, 21Turci S.M. McDonald M.J. J. Chromatogr. 1985; 343: 168-174Google Scholar). Removal of heme was accomplished by treatment with acid acetone as described (22Ascoli F. Fanelli M.R.R. Antonini E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 72-87Google Scholar) with modifications (23O'Malley S.M. McDonald M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 384-388Google Scholar). Final solutions of the hemoglobins were suspended in 0.05 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and concentrations were determined (ε280nm = 12.7 mM−1 cm−1, on a subunit basis) in a Cary 2200 spectrophotometer (Varian Instruments). Nativeness of these species was confirmed by carrying out a heme titration at a single wavelength. In addition, reconstituted CN-protohemoglobin and CN-deuterohemoglobin were chromatographed on Biogel P-6 (Bio-Rad) and subjected to spectral measurements which confirmed maxima of 420 and 409 nm, respectively. Heme titrations over a Soret spectral region of 400 to 450 nm were performed in the following manner. Protohemin and deuterohemin (Porphyrin Products Inc.) were dissolved in a minimal amount of 0.1 N NaOH and distilled water, and their concentrations were determined (ε390nm = 50 mM−1 cm−1 and ε382nm = 57 mM−1 cm−1 for protohemin and deuterohemin, respectively). These solutions were converted to the cyanide derivative by adding excess KCN. Increments of the stock CN-hemin solutions were added to both sample and reference cells, and data acquisition was carried out by Lab Calc Software (Galactic). Confirmation of apohemoglobin nativeness was obtained from isoelectric focusing studies (Omega Horizontal Electrophoretic System; Isolab Inc.) on an agarose gel between pH levels 6 and 8, with the gel surface maintained at 10°C. The samples were focused for 1 h at 1100 V at the end of which the gel was fixed in a 10% trichloroacetic acid solution followed by staining with a heme specific stain, o-dianisidine. Titration of apohemoglobin with p-hydroxymercuribenzoate (PMB; Sigma) 1The abbreviation used is: PMBp-hydroxymercuribenzoate. was performed according to the method of Boyer (24Boyer P.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1954; 76: 4331-4337Google Scholar) and revealed that an end point was achieved when half-equivalent amount of PMB was bound to the apohemoglobin dimer. The concentration of PMB was determined (ε232nm = 16.9 mM−1 cm−1), and the titration was monitored at 255 nm. Subsequent preparations of PMB-apohemoglobin were made by adding half-equivalent amounts of a concentrated PMB solution to the apohemoglobin sample. The integrity and stability of PMB-apohemoglobin were evaluated in the UV region (see “Results and Discussion”). p-hydroxymercuribenzoate. All kinetic measurements were carried out in a Kinetic Instruments stopped flow device online to OLIS 3820 data acquisition software. The pathlength of the reaction cell was 20 mm, and the instrument had a dead time of 2 ms. All measurements were performed in 0.05 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 at 10°C, by mixing equal volumes of the respective CN-hemin and apohemoglobin in a 1:1 or 1:2 ratio. The reaction of α apohemoglobin was carried out only under equimolar conditions. The time courses were monitored, at their respective absorption maxima over a variety of time frames (0.02-300 s) to permit the collection of a sufficient number of data points. Each time course consisted of an average of three runs, and a minimum of three independent trials was performed allowing the determination of standard deviations. Standard fitting routines allowed the isolation of multiple phases for each time course. Apparent first (and second order) rate constants were derived from standard plots of log absorbance and (1/[CN-hemin]) versus time, respectively. A slow reaction (inaccessible by rapid kinetic technique) was observed when CN-protohemin and apohemoglobin were in a 1:2 ratio and its baseline was obtained in a Cary 2200 spectrophotometer after manual mixing of the two reactant solutions. Soret absorption spectra of hemoglobins, which are sensitive not only to the type and state of ligand on the central iron of heme but also the heme environment of the protein itself, have been used to study heme binding kinetics (8Gibson Q.H. Antonini E. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1960; 77: 328-341Google Scholar, 9Gibson Q.H. Antonini E. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 1384-1388Google Scholar, 10Chu A.H. Bucci E. J. Biol.

J. 1992; 21: 85-92Google Scholar). In addition, an increased preference of the α over the β subunit for heme is postulated to be the basis for the occurrence of semi-α-hemoglobins. The present study represents a novel method of monitoring for the existence of this kinetic intermediate during reconstitution of hemoglobin. Static and kinetic Soret spectral changes of apohemoglobin model systems that occur upon incorporation of two distinct heme moieties, the native CN-protohemin and its less hydrophobic derivative, CN-deuterohemin, have been monitored. The change in absorption spectra of apohemoglobin upon binding of CN-protohemin (Fig. 1, top panel) and CN-deuterohemin (Fig. 1, bottom panel) was followed in the Soret region between 400 and 450 nm. Titration curves (Fig. 1, insets) of absorbance changes at 420 and 409 nm for CN-protohemin and CN-deuterohemin, respectively, clearly indicate an end point corresponding to one heme bound per monomer subunit. Under the standard experimental conditions of 0.05 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, at 10°C incremental addition of CN-protohemin to apohemoglobin (5 μM) resulted in a significant blue spectral shift (5 ± 0.5 nm) until half-saturation (one heme/apohemoglobin dimer) was reached (Fig. 1, top panel), and then no further spectral shift was observed with additional CN-protohemin. Wavelength dependence has been observed by Kawamura-Konishi and Suzuki (25Kawamura-Konishi Y. Suzuki H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 98: 1181-1190Google Scholar) upon addition of a caffeine adduct of hemin to apohemoglobin and was reported to be a consequence of caffeine-heme binding to the α subunit of apohemoglobin. In addition, the blue shift seen here is consistent with CN-protosemi-α-hemoglobin formation, because the Soret spectra of this semihemoglobin is more blue-shifted than that of its semi-β-hemoglobin counterpart in both CO-protoheme (16Park R.Y. McDonald M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 522-527Google Scholar, 18Cassoly R. Banerjee R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 19: 514-522Google Scholar) and more importantly the CN-protohemin form (17Kawamura-Konishi Y. Chiba K. Kihara H. Suzuki H. Eur. Biophys. J. 1992; 21: 85-92Google Scholar). CN-deuterohemin incorporation into apohemoglobin, on the other hand, revealed a titration whose spectra were wavelength-independent over the region of study from 400 to 450 nm. The CN-deuterohemin lacks the vinyl groups in positions 2 and 4 of protohemin, and this would be expected to alter heme-protein contacts and consequently spectral properties (see below). Furthermore, electrophoretic studies from the laboratories of Winterhalter et al. (13Winterhalter K.H. Ioppolo C. Antonini E. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3790-3795Google Scholar) and Cassoly and Banerjee (18Cassoly R. Banerjee R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 19: 514-522Google Scholar) indicate that CN-deuterohemoglobin reconstitution does not exhibit αβ chain differences. Random heme binding could obscure any spectral shifts and would also preclude preferential formation of a CN-deuterosemi-α-hemoglobin. Isofocusing studies (Fig. 2) reveal that a semihemoglobin intermediate is present only during CN-protohemin incorporation into apohemoglobin. These results are in general agreement with earlier zonal electrophoresis studies (13Winterhalter K.H. Ioppolo C. Antonini E. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3790-3795Google Scholar). Furthermore, the cathodic heme-containing component observed here has been previously identified as semihemoglobin (16Park R.Y. McDonald M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 522-527Google Scholar, 18Cassoly R. Banerjee R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 19: 514-522Google Scholar). CN-deuterohemin incorporation into apohemoglobin reveals no semihemoglobin formation; a fact that corresponded well with the lack of detectable wavelength dependence (Fig. 1, bottom panel) during titration. The heme-protein interactions of the α subunit were probed independently of its coupling to its β chain partner. Soret spectral monitoring of α-apohemoglobin upon the addition of increments of CN-protohemin (Fig. 3, top panel) and CN-deuterohemin (Fig. 3, bottom panel) was carried out under conditions of 0.05 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 10°C. Titration curves (Fig. 3, insets) revealed one heme bound per α-apohemoglobin monomer. Only CN-protohemin was able to induce a blue spectral shift from 422.5 to 420.5 (±0.5) nm in α-apohemoglobin. This strongly implies that interaction of CN-protohemin with the unique environment of the α subunit results in an alteration in the heme chromophore spectrum. The decreased magnitude of this change compared with that seen for apohemoglobin (Fig. 1, top panel) also may indicate that this chromophoric perturbation is augmented by the presence of a β chain partner. Six residues of the α subunit and eight residues of the β subunit have been shown by Perutz and Fermi to interact with the vinyl groups of the heme moiety and have shown considerable structural homology (4Perutz M.F. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Nienhuis A.W. Leder P. Majerus P.W. The Molecular Basis of Blood Diseases. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1987: 127-178Google Scholar, 26Fermi G. Perutz M.F. Phillips D.C. Richards F.M. Atlas of Molecular Structure in Biology 2: Hemoglobin and Myoglobin. Clarendon Press, Oxford1981Google Scholar). Residues at helical positions G5 and G8 are invariant in both the α and β chains of human hemoglobin. This is of interest because the G-helical regions of both chains have been implicated in apohemoglobin dimer stability (27Currell D.L Ioppolo C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 263: 82-88Google Scholar, 28Moulton D.P. McDonald M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1278-1283Google Scholar). Furthermore, the G5 residue is aromatic in nature, and as such, this phenylalanyl residue has the potential to noncovalently interact with the heme moiety; an interaction that would be expected to contribute to changes in Soret spectral behavior. Interpretation of Soret spectral shifts for β-apohemoglobin is precluded by the fact that this species exists as a dimer (29Waks M. Yip Y.K. Beychok S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6462-6470Google Scholar, 30Lindquist L. Lopez-Campillo A. Alpert B. Photochem. Photobiol. 1978; 28: 417-420Google Scholar, 31Oton J. Bucci E. Steiner R.F. Fronticelli C. Franchi D. Montemarano J. Martinez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7248-7256Google Scholar, 32O'Malley S.M. McDonald M.J. J. Protein Chem. 1994; 13: 585-590Google Scholar). An alternate approach would be to modify the β subunit of apohemoglobin, a challenging endeavor because the heme-free protein is rather unsuitable for extensive protein chemical manipulation. Nonetheless, modification of apohemoglobin has been reported, and fortuitously, the most successful was that of the site-specific modification of the reactive β93 (F9) cysteine residue (15Lau P.-W. Asakura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6838-6843Google Scholar, 27Currell D.L Ioppolo C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 263: 82-88Google Scholar). Furthermore, a reagent attached to this β93 (due to the residue being adjacent to the proximal histidine β92) would be expected to be a “reporter group” of the β chain heme insertion event. The sulfhydryl reagent, PMB, has been shown to bind rapidly and specifically to the β93 (F9) cysteine residue of apohemoglobin at one PMB bound per apohemoglobin dimer. Investigation of the UV spectral region (240-290 nm) upon addition of PMB to apohemoglobin (Fig. 4, left panel) revealed two significant spectral changes. One corresponds to the formation of a mercaptide bond in the 250-260 nm region (24Boyer P.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1954; 76: 4331-4337Google Scholar), and the other (in the 280 nm region) may correlate with changes in the β chain heme environment (see kinetic studies below). Under conditions of 0.05 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 at 10°C, spectral scans of the UV region demonstrated stability of the PMB-apohemoglobin species (Fig. 4, center panel) over the time frame required for the present investigations. CN-protohemin (Fig. 4, right panel) and CN-deuterohemin (not shown) titration of this PMB modified protein showed Soret spectral changes identical to those seen for native apohemoglobin (Fig. 1). Thus, this sulfhydryl modification showed no apparent affect on the static spectral properties of CN-hemin apohemoglobin. However, significant differences in the binding kinetics of CN-hemin to native and modified apohemoglobin may be discernible (see “Kinetics of CN-Hemin Binding to PMB-Apohemoglobin”). This present kinetic investigation was aimed at evaluating the heme incorporation process in vitro and attempting to extrapolate these findings to the in vivo event. Our current studies of static titrations have demonstrated that the CN-protohemin-protein binding involves a spectrally definable intermediate (presumably semi-α-hemoglobin) that is not seen in CN-deuterohemin-protein association and that this intermediate is most discernible up to half-saturation (one heme per apohemoglobin dimer). Taking this into account CN-protohemin and CN-deuterohemin were mixed in a 1:1 and 1:2 ratio with apohemoglobin in 0.05 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 10°C, and the change in Soret absorbance (at 420 and 409 nm, respectively) was followed in a stopped flow device. All four reactions were multiphasic, and the resultant rate plots are presented (Fig. 5). The kinetics of full reconstitution of CN-protohemin and CN-deuterohemin are displayed in rows 1 and 3, respectively, whereas those that promote partial (50%) reconstitution are in rows 2 and 4, respectively. The initial part of all four time courses is dominated by a second order process that is designated Phase I. This is the heme insertion event, and studies with an array of monomeric heme derivatives (8Gibson Q.H. Antonini E. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1960; 77: 328-341Google Scholar, 9Gibson Q.H. Antonini E. J.

(Tokyo). 1985; 98: 1181-1190Google Scholar) have yielded rates in the order of 107M−1 s−1. As expected the rates of CN-protohemin insertion (Table I) for both full and half-saturation (10 and 14 × 10−7M−1 s−1, respectively) were 1.3-2-fold faster than the rate of entry of the less hydrophobic CN-deuterohemin derivative (full and half-saturation yielded rates of 7.8 and 7.1 × 107M−1 s−1, respectively). Interestingly enough, the formation of CN-protosemihemoglobin was 1.4 times more rapid than that of the CN-protohemoglobin. This faster rate could result from an increased accessibility of the α chain for heme and is consistent with the finding that the β subunit structure is more rigid (less accommodating; 29Waks M. Yip Y.K. Beychok S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6462-6470Google Scholar) possibly due to the presence of its D-helix (33Whitaker T.L. Berry M.B. Ho E.L. Hargrove M.S. Phillips G.N. Komiyama N.H. Nagai K. Olson J.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8221-8226Google Scholar). All subsequent phases (Phases II-IV) were found to be first order in nature and almost certainly attributed to structural changes in the apohemoglobin molecule. Phase II exhibited a rate of 0.21 s−1, which was invariant with the type of CN-hemin derivative or the degree of reconstitution achieved. Phase III (0.085 s−1) was approximately 2.5-fold slower than Phase II for all reactions except that it was apparently missing in the formation of CN-protosemi-α-hemoglobin (Fig. 5, row 2, III). This suggests that the absence of this phase is related to lack of CN-hemin insertion into the β chain partner. The final phase of the reaction (Phase IV) displayed a rate of 0.013 s−1 (6.5-fold slower than Phase III) except in the case of CN-protosemi-α-hemoglobin (Fig. 5, row 2, IV) where the rate obtained was 0.008 s−1. This slower rate for Phase IV is of interest because recent studies have assigned this rate of reaction to the formation of the bond between the central iron of heme and the proximal histidine (F-8) in myoglobin (34Kawamura-Konishi Y. Kihara H. Suzuki H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 170: 589-595Google Scholar, 35Yee S. Peyton D.H.

Open table in a new tab Thus, it appears that binding half-saturating amounts of CN-protohemin to apohemoglobin results in a process that allows faster heme insertion, that lacks one of two discernible first order structure rearrangement components, and that possibly results in a 1.5-fold decrease in the rate of iron-histidine bond formation. This bond formation ensures irreversible heme incorporation and prevents the possibility of heme exchange between the subunits of apohemoglobin (36Benesch R.E. Kwong S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14881-14885Google Scholar, 37Benesch R.E. Kwong S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13785-13786Google Scholar, 38Gattoni M. Boffi A. Sarti P. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10130-10136Google Scholar). The 1.5-fold decrease in this rate of bond formation for CN-proto semi-α-hemoglobin would therefore allow more time for such a heme transfer (from α to β) to occur. CN-protohemin (Fig. 6, row 1) and CN-deuterohemin (Fig. 6, row 2) were mixed in a l:l ratio with α-apohemoglobin in 0.05 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 10°C, and both reactions yielded four independent kinetic phases (Table I). The rate of CN-protohemin insertion (Phase I) into this monomeric apohemoglobin was 1.4-fold faster than that for CN-deuterohemin entry yielding values of 12 and 8.4 × 107M−1 s−1, respectively. Phase II exhibited a rate (0.20 s−1) similar to that seen for apohemoglobin in the case of both CN-hemins, presumably indicative of a similar event in the presence and the absence of a partner chain. The additional structural event (designated as Phase III) was present for the incorporation of both CN-protohemin and CN-deuterohemin into α-apohemoglobin yielding values of 0.087 and 0.099 s−1, respectively. These rates are comparable with those seen for full incorporation of CN-hemin into apohemoglobin (Fig. 5, rows 1 and 3, III). The final Phase IV exhibited rates (0.012 s−1) comparable with those of the fully reconstituted parent hemoglobins. This current investigation is of considerable interest because it allows comparison with the earlier study of Leutzinger and Beychok (11Leutzinger Y. Beychok S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 780-784Google Scholar) in which these workers demonstrated that the kinetics of CN-protohemin incorporation into α-apohemoglobin is multiphasic. Their three mixed phases can be readily correlated with the four phases seen here for CN-protohemin and CN-deuterohemin incorporation. Their Soret spectral, fluorescence quenching, and far UV circular dichroism studies revealed a process in which heme entry (Phase I) was followed by structural rearrangements local (Phase II) and global (Phase III). Although these workers postulated that the His (F8)-iron bond formation preceded these structural changes, recent evidence (34Kawamura-Konishi Y. Kihara H. Suzuki H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 170: 589-595Google Scholar, 35Yee S. Peyton D.H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 290: 119-122Google Scholar) suggests that this step (Phase IV) occurs later in the overall heme incorporation process. Taken together these investigations suggest that the heme pocket of α-apohemoglobin is quite accessible and can readily accommodate both CN-protohemin and CN-deuterohemin, that this α-apohemoglobin monomer is capable of undergoing structural rearrangements comparable with those observed during full reconstitution of its apohemoglobin parent, and that if these structural adjustments are permitted allow a stable linkage between its proximal histidine and the heme iron to be formed at a normal rate. If, however, as may be the case during half-saturation of apohemoglobin with CN-protohemin (see above), conformational restraints (presumably due to αβ coupling) are present, then this rate of bond formation is diminished. The static Soret absorption changes accompanying titration with CN-protohemin were identical for apohemoglobin (Fig. 1, top panel) and PMB-apohemoglobin (Fig. 4, right panel), and the overall kinetic profile of CN-hemin binding to PMB-apohemoglobin (Fig. 7) was comparable with that of apohemoglobin (Fig. 5) but not the rates. All four time courses (full reconstitution, Fig. 7, rows 1 and 3; partial (50%) reconstitution, Fig. 7, rows 2 and 4 for CN-protohemin and CN-deuterohemin, respectively) reveal heme insertion rates (Phase I) 1.7-fold more rapid for CN-protohemin and 1.5-fold more rapid for CN-deuterohemin than seen for unmodified apohemoglobin. Furthermore, the difference between the heme insertion rate of CN-protohemin and CN-deuterohemin increased to 1.8-fold, whereas the rate of formation of CN-protohemin-semi-α-hemoglobin (Fig. 7, row 2) actually decreased when compared with that of the fully reconstituted species (Fig. 7, row 1); a finding heretofore only seen with CN-deuterohemin insertion. Phase II exhibited a rate of 0.23 s−1 for all four time courses and is remarkably similar to that seen for both apohemoglobin and α-apohemoglobin. Phase III (0.12 s−1) was 1.9-fold slower than Phase II for reactions involving full reconstitution and either missing or much slower (2.5-fold) for half-reconstitution with CN-protohemin and CN-deuterohemin, respectively. Phase IV displayed rates of 0.008 (15-fold slower than Phase III) and 0.011 s−1 (10-fold slower than Phase III) for CN-protohemin and CN-deuterohemin binding irrespective of the degree of reconstitution. In fact, full reconstitution of PMB-apohemoglobin displayed a Phase IV rate 1.4-fold slower than that for reconstitution of unmodified apohemoglobin. Thus, even the presence of Phase III could not restore proximal bond formation to its original rate when PMB is bound. These present studies of CN-hemin incorporation into PMB-apohemoglobin showed that β93 (F9) sulfhydryl modification not only accelerated but also accentuated the difference in the rate of heme insertion (Phase I) of CN-protohemin and CN-deuterohemin. It appears that even though subunit accessibility has been enhanced, the vinyl groups continue to play a key role in the kinetics of CN-hemin binding. Phase II consistently reflected local protein-heme interactions, the majority of which, interestingly enough, are on the proximal (F8) side of the α and β chains (26Fermi G. Perutz M.F. Phillips D.C. Richards F.M. Atlas of Molecular Structure in Biology 2: Hemoglobin and Myoglobin. Clarendon Press, Oxford1981Google Scholar). Although the rate of Phase III of PMB-apohemoglobin increased during complete reconstitution, it continued to be absent during partial reconstitution of this modified protein. This demonstrated that PMB alone is able to alter αβ coupling (PMB has been reported to affect dimer coupling in hemoglobin; 39McDonald M.J. Noble R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3161-3165Google Scholar) but not enough to allow the α subunit to respond as it would if decoupled (Fig. 6) from its β partner. This absence of Phase III inevitably resulted in a slowed rate of proximal bond formation for the α subunit. This finding is not a direct consequence of the presence of PMB because the residue adjacent to the proximal (F8) histidine, is a sulfhydryl, only in the case of the β subunit. In conclusion—CN-hemin incorporation, although not seen under normal physiological conditions, may nonetheless allow insight into the probable sequence of events leading up to hemoglobin tetramer formation in vivo. CN-deuterohemin appears to randomly bind to the α and β chains of apohemoglobin and as such does not promote either Soret spectral shifts or anomalous kinetic behavior when incorporated into the apohemoglobin models employed here. Furthermore, absence of the vinyl groups may impair the heme insertion (Phase I) process (possibly due to heme orientation stereospecificity factors; 40Ishimori K. Morishima I. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4747-4753Google Scholar) but does not impede structural rearrangements (Phases II and III) nor timely proximal histidine-iron bond formation (Phase IV). The presence of the porphyrin 2,4 vinyl groups, on the other hand, has interesting consequences. CN-protohemin promoted Soret spectral shifts upon binding in all apohemoglobin models. The invariant G5 phenylalanine of the α subunit appears to be a likely candidate for involvement in this spectral shift, especially because the G5 residue of its β chain partner is not reported to interact with the vinyl groups (4Perutz M.F. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Nienhuis A.W. Leder P. Majerus P.W. The Molecular Basis of Blood Diseases. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1987: 127-178Google Scholar, 26Fermi G. Perutz M.F. Phillips D.C. Richards F.M. Atlas of Molecular Structure in Biology 2: Hemoglobin and Myoglobin. Clarendon Press, Oxford1981Google Scholar). Furthermore, the magnitude of Soret spectral shift, the presence of Phase III, and the rate of Phase IV were all governed by whether the α apohemoglobin was free as a monomer or sequestered in an apohemoglobin dimer, implying that αβ interplay is primarily responsible. The G-helical segments are reported to be essential for αβ coupling of apohemoglobin, and thus it would appear that amino acid residues in this region account for static enhancements and kinetic restraints imposed on the preassembled α subunit. Although the B-helical region may be important (26Fermi G. Perutz M.F. Phillips D.C. Richards F.M. Atlas of Molecular Structure in Biology 2: Hemoglobin and Myoglobin. Clarendon Press, Oxford1981Google Scholar, 41Schaad O. Vallone B. Edelstein J. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1993; 316: 564-571Google Scholar, 42Manning L.R. Jenkins W.T. Hess J.R. Vandegriff K. Winslow R.M. Manning J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 775-781Google Scholar), focusing on the FG and G regions, where the majority of interface contacts in both apohemoglobin and hemoglobin reside, may be informative. In this region, four α chain residues (FG5, G4, G5 and G8) account for 11 out of 13 vinyl contacts, whereas three β chain residues (FG5, G4, and G8) are responsible for 5 out of 14 vinyl contacts. Furthermore, these same residues not only interact with the heme moiety but also contribute one α1β1 and six α1β2 interface contacts in hemoglobin. A possible scenario, consistent with the kinetics of PMB-apohemoglobin, would be that the FG5 residue is involved in Phase III (the bulky PMB could enhance this residue's overall interaction; Table I). Movement of this FG5 valyl residue could reorient the G-helix, strengthen the α1β1 contact, and prime the α1β2 region for tetramer assembly (a process encouraged by heme binding to the β subunit). Histidine bond formation would be inevitable. At half-saturating amounts during semi-α-hemoglobin formation, however, the momentum of these structural movements is lost, and the rate of irreversible proximal bond formation is impaired. In vivo heme and globin production are delicately balanced processes so that ample quantities of both are available for hemoglobin formation in the typical precursor red blood cell (3Bunn H.F. Forget G.B. Hemoglobin: Molecular, Genetic and Clinical Aspects. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1986Google Scholar); yet the exact manner in which four nascent globin chains and four Fe-protoporphyrin-IX groups combine to form the heme-containing tetramer is still a mystery. As with all complex biochemical phenomena, isolation of given reactions have aided in understanding this process. Previous studies have attempted to fine tune aspects of assembly through kinetic investigations of association of heme-containing α and β subunits (20McDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6487-6490Google Scholar, 43McDonald M.J. Turci S.M. Mrabet N.T. Himelstein B.P. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5951-5956Google Scholar, 44Joshi A.A. McDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8549-8553Google Scholar); however, another plausible pathway of assembly may be that of combination of heme-containing and heme-free partner chains. If this is indeed the case then the heme-containing partner must be the α subunit. Evidence for this is overwhelming and consistent with findings that heme is readily inserted (possibly cotranslationally; 45Komar A.A. Kommer A. Krasheninnikov I.A. Spirin A.S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 261-263Google Scholar) into αo (1Friedman F.K. Beychok S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 217-250Google Scholar, 11Leutzinger Y. Beychok S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 780-784Google Scholar), that both αo and αh are found in vivo (6Winterhalter K.H. Heywood D. Huehns E.R. Finch C.A. Br. J. Haematol. 1969; 16: 523-535Google Scholar, 7Shaeffer J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7473-7480Google Scholar), and that βh chains are present only in the case of severe α-thalassemia (HbH disease; 3Bunn H.F. Forget G.B. Hemoglobin: Molecular, Genetic and Clinical Aspects. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1986Google Scholar). This stable viable α species may then combine with its heme-free ribosomal bound β partner to form a stable semi-α-hemoglobin. The results presented here suggest that its preassembled counterpart may also be converted into hemoglobin by either acceptance of a heme moiety from another semihemoglobin precursor or by binding heme directly. The existence of the former pathway is intriguing, not only because both semi-α-hemoglobin and apohemoglobin have been found in vivo but also because it implies that the α chain plays a key role in heme currency exchange.

The metabolic importance of the enzyme is indicated by observations that adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency in humans is associated with mental retardation, secondary autistic behavior, and muscle wasting (16Stone R.L.

Biochem. 1969; 47: 665-672Google Scholar) show that catalysis follows an ordered uni-bi mechanism with fumarate leaving the enzyme before AMP. The binding of AMP or the AMP portion of adenylosuccinate appears to induce a conformational change which exposes the site involved in binding fumarate or the succinate moiety of adenylosuccinate. The mechanism proposed for the action of adenylosuccinate lyase involves the attack of an enzymic general base on the β-H and elimination of the amino group facilitated by protonation of the ring nitrogen by an amino acid of the enzyme functioning as a general acid (1Ratner S. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1972: 167-197Google Scholar, 18Stone R.L. Zalkin H. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19710-19716Google Scholar). However, little information is available on the role of enzymic amino acids in catalysis. Only Arg112 of the rabbit muscle enzyme (numbering based on the human enzyme) has been identified within the substrate-binding site (8Gite S.U. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2658-2667Google Scholar).The sequence of B. subtilis adenylosuccinate lyase shows 25% identity plus 18% similarity to the human enzyme. We have now expressed the B. subtilis enzyme in E. coli and purified it in order to locate by affinity labeling amino acid residues in the active site of the enzyme.6-(4-Bromo-2,3-dioxobutyl)thioadenosine 5′-monophosphate (6-BDB-TAMP) 1The abbreviations used are: 6-BDB-TAMP6-(4-bromo-2,3-dioxobutyl)thioadenosine 5′-monophosphate6-TAMP6-mercaptopurine riboside 5′-phosphateMES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidTLCthin-layer chromatographyHPLChigh-performance liquid chromatographyPBAphenyl boronate-agaroseTPCKtosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketonePTHphenylthiohydantoinNi-NTAnickelnitrilotriacetate. (Fig. 1) has been used as a reactive nucleotide analog to modify nucleotide-binding sites in enzymes (21Colman R.F. Huang Y.-C. King M.M. Erb M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3281-3286Google Scholar). It is strikingly similar in structure to adenylosuccinate, and therefore would be predicted to bind to the adenylosuccinate site of adenylosuccinate lyase. The bromodioxobutyl group of 6-BDB-TAMP is likely to occupy the succinyl subsite, where the key catalytic steps should occur. Nucleophilic attack of the carbonyl(s) or methylene bromide group by the side chains of Lys, Arg, Cys, His, or other amino acids can result in covalent bond formation (22Colman R.F. Sigman D.S. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1990: 283-321Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe the specific inactivation of B. subtilis adenylosuccinate lyase by 6-BDB-TAMP. Our results indicate that His141 is the target of 6-BDB-TAMP and that it is located in the active site of adenylosuccinate lyase. A preliminary version of this work has been presented (23Lee T.T. Dixon J.E. Colman R.F. FASEB J. 1996; 10: A1101Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONWe have demonstrated that 6-(4-bromo-2,3-dioxobutyl)thioadenosine 5′-monophosphate acts as an affinity label of B. subtilis adenylosuccinate lyase. The 6-BDB-TAMP is a close structural analog of the substrate adenylosuccinate, with the reactive bromodioxobutyl group at a position equivalent to the succinate moiety of the natural compound. The nonlinear dependence on reagent concentration of the initial rate constant for inactivation by 6-BDB-TAMP suggests the formation of a reagent-enzyme complex prior to irreversible covalent modification, which is responsible for the specificity of an affinity label. The apparent KI value (30 μM) is about 10-fold higher than the Km value of adenylosuccinate (2.6 μM), indicating the reagent binds more weakly to the enzyme than the substrate, presumably due to the somewhat different size and electrophilicity of the BDB group as compared to the succinyl group. Modification by 6-BDB-TAMP results in loss of enzyme activity concomitant with incorporation of only 1 mol of reagent per mol of enzyme subunit. Furthermore, both inactivation and incorporation are decreased by addition of substrate or products, indicating the reagent targets the active site of the enzyme.Evidence was presented that decomposition of 6-BDB-TAMP by hydrolysis of the bromide yields a compound which binds tightly to the enzyme, but is not capable of covalent modification or inactivation. Furthermore, the hydrolyzed 6-BDB-TAMP is a competitive inhibitor with respect to adenylosuccinate. It binds to the enzyme with a KI of 1.1 μM, a value considerably lower than the apparent KI of 30 μM for 6-BDB-TAMP. Replacement of the bromide by the smaller -OH improves the affinity of the nucleotide for the enzyme. The generation of hydrolyzed 6-BDB-TAMP during the modification of the enzyme by 6-BDB-TAMP can account for the decreased rate of inactivation after 12 min (i.e. the curvature in plots of lnE/E0 versus time, as in Fig. 2). This postulate is supported by the observation that hydrolyzed 6-BDB-TAMP, when added at the start of the reaction, decreases the rate of inactivation by 6-BDB-TAMP (Table I).Further insight into the reaction site of 6-BDB-TAMP on adenylosuccinate lyase can be gained by analyzing the ligands which protect against inactivation. The inclusion of fumarate (5 mM and 10 mM) has little effect on the inactivation; however, fumarate is a noncompetitive inhibitor (5Pinto R.M. Faraldo A. Fernandez A. Canales J. Sillero A. Sillero M.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12513-12519Google Scholar, 9Barnes L.B. Bishop S.H. Int. J. Biochem. 1975; 6: 497-503Google Scholar, 18Stone R.L. Zalkin H. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19710-19716Google Scholar, 19Bridger W.A. Cohen L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 644-650Google Scholar) and binds to the enzyme only in the presence of AMP. AMP, a competitive inhibitor of the catalytic adenylosuccinate lyase reaction, also does not protect well against inactivation, when added by itself. This is understandable since 6-BDB-TAMP (as compared with AMP) carries a BDB group which is the portion of the reagent which undergoes modification. The reagent is more similar structurally to the substrate adenylosuccinate and binds to the enzyme more tightly than does AMP. In fact, adenylosuccinate, or AMP added in conjunction with fumarate, decreases the inactivation rate constant as much as 10-fold. These results suggest that both the AMP and fumarate (equivalent to the succinyl group of adenylosuccinate) sites are occupied by 6-BDB-TAMP upon inactivation: the 6-thio-AMP moiety is expected to bind to the AMP site, while the BDB group is likely to occupy the fumarate site. Both sites must be blocked in order to maximally prevent inactivation. This conclusion is consistent with the observation that effective protection is afforded by the hydrolyzed 6-BDB-TAMP, which is capable of occupying both sites.His141 has been identified as the target residue of 6-BDB-TAMP in adenylosuccinate lyase. Only one modified peptide has been isolated from the tryptic digest of 6-BDB-TAMP-inactivated enzyme; and its adsorption on a phenyl boronate-agarose column is consistent with its designation as a nucleotidyl peptide. Gas-phase sequencing identified the 11-membered peptide as Thr140-Phe150, with the low yield of PTH-His in cycle 2 indicating that His141 was the modified residue. Histidine can react with 6-BDB-TAMP by nucleophilic displacement of the bromide. The molecular weight of the peptide detected by mass spectrometry corresponds to the displacement product. However, the release of free reagent during HPLC and the small amount of histidine regenerated during sequencing indicate the limited stability of the histidine product.The amino acid sequences of adenylosuccinate lyase are known for 7 organisms, including three bacterial (B. subtilis (10Ebbole D.J.

Van den Berghe G. Zalkin H. Dixon J.E. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 59-63Google Scholar)) enzymes. Alignment among these sequences exhibits 7% identity plus 23% similarity. His141 of B. subtilis is one of the well conserved amino acids. In fact, as shown in Fig. 7, the sequences flanking His141 are relatively well conserved, consistent with this region of the enzyme playing an important role in catalysis.Fig. 7Amino acid sequence alignment of adenylosuccinate lyases from B. subtilis, E. coli, H. influenzae, M. jannaschii, chicken, murine, and human (partial).

Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 263-270Google Scholar). This is a group of functionally related enzymes which generate fumarate by cleaving different substrates. δ-Crystallin, a major structural protein component in the avian and reptilian lens, is considered to have evolved from the enzyme argininosuccinate lyase (39Chiou S.-H.

Biophys. 1991; 287: 60-67Google Scholar) studies have indicated an essential histidine residue in the active site of some members in this family. Sequence comparison showed that the region displayed in Fig. 7 is one of two regions of high homology among this superfamily (36Williams S.E. Woolridge E.M. Ransom S.C. Landro J.A. Babbitt P.C. Kozarich J.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9768-9776Google Scholar, 37Weaver T.M. Levitt D.G. Donnelly M.I. Stevens P.P. Banaszak L.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 654-662Google Scholar, 38Wistow G.J. Piatigorsky J. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 263-270Google Scholar). His141 is conserved in almost all of these enzymes. In a site-directed mutagenesis study on duck δ-crystallin in which the corresponding histidine (i.e. His162) was converted to asparagine, the protein completely lost enzymatic activity (46Patejunas G. Barbosa P. Lacombe M. O'Brien W.E. Exp. Eye. Res. 1995; 61: 151-154Google Scholar).Crystal structures of two enzymes from this family have been solved. In fumarase C of E. coli, the corresponding histidine (i.e. His188) is positioned near the center of the active site cleft formed by three of the four subunits, and is proposed to form a “charge relay system” with Glu331 from another subunit which is responsible for removal of the proton in a catalytic cycle (37Weaver T.M. Levitt D.G. Donnelly M.I. Stevens P.P. Banaszak L.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 654-662Google Scholar). A similar cleft considered as the putative active site has been described in turkey δ-crystallin, in which His160 and Glu294 (positioned close to each other) are proposed as strong candidates for general base and general acid functions of the protein (42Simpson A. Bateman O. Driessen H. Lindley P. Moss D. Mylvaganam S. Narebor E. Slingsby C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 724-734Google Scholar). Crystallization of the B. subtilis adenylosuccinate lyase has recently been reported (24Redinbo M.R. Eide S.M. Stone R.L. Dixon J.E. Yeates T.O. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 786-788Google Scholar), but the structure has not yet been determined.The catalytic reaction of adenylosuccinate lyase is postulated to undergo a β-elimination mechanism (1Ratner S. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1972: 167-197Google Scholar, 18Stone R.L. Zalkin H. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19710-19716Google Scholar, 47Havir E. Hanson K. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1973: 75-166Google Scholar), in which the deprotonation of the Cβ and the cleavage of N-Cα occur in a concerted manner. The other substrate in purine biosynthesis cleaved by adenylosuccinate lyase is 5-amino-4-imidazole-N-succinocarboxamide ribotide, which closely resembles adenylosuccinate, and also has a succinyl group attached. A similar mechanism has been proposed for this reaction. Determination of the pH dependence of kcat/Km for the human enzyme revealed a bell-shaped curve characterized by pKa values of 6.4 and 7.5 (18Stone R.L. Zalkin H. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19710-19716Google Scholar). This kinetic behavior is suggestive of a general acid-general base mechanism with the enzymic group of pKa 6.4 in its unprotonated state and that of pKa 7.5 in its protonated state. Rat muscle adenylosuccinate lyase also exhibits a bell-shaped curve for Vmax/Km, with pKa values of 6.4 and 8.2, respectively, for the two limbs (7Casey P.J. Lowenstein J.M. Biochem. J. 1987; 246: 263-269Google Scholar). His134 of the human enzyme, equivalent to His141 of the B. subtilis enzyme, has been considered as candidate for the general base reflected in the pH profile, since it is among the conserved amino acid residues (14Aimi J. Badylak J. Williams J. Chen Z. Zalkin H. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9011-9014Google Scholar, 18Stone R.L. Zalkin H. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19710-19716Google Scholar). Our studies show His141 of the B. subtilis enzyme is an effective nucleophile in attacking the bromodioxobutyl group of 6-BDB-TAMP. In accordance with the structural similarity between adenylosuccinate and 6-BDB-TAMP, the succinyl moiety of the substrate may occupy the same position as the reactive BDB group of the reagent; therefore His141 may be well positioned to remove a methylene proton from the succinyl part of adenylosuccinate. Our results strongly suggest that His141 acts as a general base accepting the proton from Cβ in the catalysis. Mutagenesis of His141 provides an opportunity to evaluate the proposed role of this amino acid; these studies are in progress. INTRODUCTIONAdenylosuccinate lyase (EC 4.3.2.2) catalyzes two distinct reactions in purine biosynthesis, one of which involves the cleavage of adenylosuccinate to form AMP and fumarate (1Ratner S.

The binding of AMP or the AMP portion of adenylosuccinate appears to induce a conformational change which exposes the site involved in binding fumarate or the succinate moiety of adenylosuccinate. The mechanism proposed for the action of adenylosuccinate lyase involves the attack of an enzymic general base on the β-H and elimination of the amino group facilitated by protonation of the ring nitrogen by an amino acid of the enzyme functioning as a general acid (1Ratner S. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1972: 167-197Google Scholar, 18Stone R.L. Zalkin H. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19710-19716Google Scholar). However, little information is available on the role of enzymic amino acids in catalysis. Only Arg112 of the rabbit muscle enzyme (numbering based on the human enzyme) has been identified within the substrate-binding site (8Gite S.U. Colman R.F.

It is strikingly similar in structure to adenylosuccinate, and therefore would be predicted to bind to the adenylosuccinate site of adenylosuccinate lyase. The bromodioxobutyl group of 6-BDB-TAMP is likely to occupy the succinyl subsite, where the key catalytic steps should occur. Nucleophilic attack of the carbonyl(s) or methylene bromide group by the side chains of Lys, Arg, Cys, His, or other amino acids can result in covalent bond formation (22Colman R.F. Sigman D.S. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1990: 283-321Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe the specific inactivation of B. subtilis adenylosuccinate lyase by 6-BDB-TAMP. Our results indicate that His141 is the target of 6-BDB-TAMP and that it is located in the active site of adenylosuccinate lyase. A preliminary version of this work has been presented (23Lee T.T.

Studies of variants of BFR in which a single glutamic acid residue at the ferroxidase center is replaced by alanine confirm that this is the site of cobalt(II) binding, since the altered centers bind only one cobalt(II) ion. This work shows that the electroneutrality of the ferroxidase center is preserved on binding a pair of divalent metal ions. Optical and EPR data show that cobalt(II) binding to BFR exhibits positive cooperativity, with an average Kd of ∼1 × 10−5M.

To distinguish between inhibition of Ras by Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) versus a potential effector function of GAP, we tested the effector domain substitution P34R: this mutation, which abolishes GAP binding, enhanced Ras-dependent transcription in Mv1Lu cells, yet interfered with Ras-dependent expression in ventricular myocytes. To examine the dichotomous role of Ras-GAP predicted from these P34R results, we transfected both cell types with full-length GAP, the C-terminal catalytic domain (cGAP), or N-terminal Src homology domains (nGAP).

The requirement for a SSB is particularly important during strand-displacement DNA replication, where great amounts of ssDNA are produced. This ssDNA corresponds to the strand that is not used as template and is displaced as the DNA polymerase progresses. One of the best characterized strand-displacement DNA replication systems is that of Bacillus subtilis phage φ29 (see 23Salas M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 39-71Google Scholar, 24Salas M.

Lázaro J.M. Méndez E. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3663-3672Google Scholar). In vitro, φ29 SSB stimulates DNA replication, at least at two levels: (i) by increasing the amount of dNTP incorporated (12Gutiérrez C. Martín G. Sogo J.M. Salas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2104-2111Google Scholar, 26Martín G. Lázaro J.M. Méndez E. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3663-3672Google Scholar) and (ii) by increasing the DNA elongation velocity of φ29 DNA polymerase under conditions in which the DNA opening is impaired (27Soengas M.S. Gutiérrez C. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 517-529Google Scholar). This activity has been proposed to be related to the helix-destabilizing properties of φ29 SSB (27Soengas M.S. Gutiérrez C. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 517-529Google Scholar). φ29 SSB becomes essential for in vitro viral DNA replication when the amount of DNA is reduced (28Blanco L. Lázaro J.M. de Vega M. Bonnin A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12198-12202Google Scholar), the closest condition to the initial steps of the viral infection. φ29 SSB binds to ssDNA in a cooperative way (Keff = 105M−1, ω = 50-70) covering 3-4 nucleotides per monomer, likely as a single array of protein units along the ssDNA (6Soengas M.S. Esteban J.A. Salas M. Gutiérrez C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 213-226Google Scholar). When visualized by electron microscopy, the φ29 SSB-DNA complex shows a continuous and homogeneous structure, and nucleosome-like structures were not apparent (6Soengas M.S. Esteban J.A. Salas M. Gutiérrez C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 213-226Google Scholar, 12Gutiérrez C. Martín G. Sogo J.M. Salas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2104-2111Google Scholar). Protein binding induces a 50% reduction in ssDNA length (29Gutiérrez C. Sogo J.M. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 983-994Google Scholar) and a 95% reduction of the intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence emission of the protein (6Soengas M.S. Esteban J.A. Salas M. Gutiérrez C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 213-226Google Scholar). This observation has been the starting point for the analysis of φ29 SSB ssDNA binding domain as described in the accompanying paper (30Soengas M.S. Mateo R.C. Salas M. Acuña A.U. Gutiérrez C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 295-302Google Scholar). The functional requirement of φ29 SSB during the DNA replication stage of φ29 infective cycle might be related to the structural properties of φ29 SSB that would lead to a particular organization of complex with the ssDNA of the replicative intermediates. In this paper, we have analyzed the global conformation of φ29 SSB in solution by analytical ultracentrifugation, steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements. Conformational changes in the protein and ssDNA structure induced upon complex formation were studied by means of circular dichroism techniques. The results of these studies indicate that φ29 SSB differs markedly from other well known SSBs. All the solutions were made with distilled, deionized (MilliQ) and sterilized water, and finally filtered through 0.45-μm filters using a Millex-HA Filter Unit (Millipore). The buffer used in analytical ultracentrifugation, time-resolved fluorescence, and circular dichroism (CD) analysis was 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (20°C) (buffer A), while the buffer used in steady state fluorescence studies was 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (20°C), 4% glycerol (buffer B). M13mp18 ssDNA was from Boehringer Mannheim and oligonucleotides dT20, dA16, and polynucleotides poly(dT300) and poly(dA300) from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Nucleotide concentrations were quantified as indicated by the supplier. φ29 SSB was purified by differential ammonium sulfate fractionation of φ29-infected cellular extracts and further phosphocelulose and DEAE-cellulose chromatography, essentially as described (27Soengas M.S. Gutiérrez C. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 517-529Google Scholar). Protein concentration was estimated by the Lowry method (31Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were carried out in an Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments Inc.) equipped with a UV-VIS optical scanner, using a Ti60 rotor and double sector 12-mm centerpieces of epon charcoal. In sedimentation equilibrium measurements, samples of φ29 SSB ranging from 10 to 30 μM were centrifuged in buffer A at 20°C and at two speeds, 25,000 and 30,000 rpm. When sedimentation equilibrium was reached, absorbance scans (at 230 nm) were taken as a function of radial distance. The base-line offsets were determined by scanning the samples at a higher speed (42,000 rpm). To obtain the relative molecular weight (Mr) of φ29 SSB, the experimental data were fitted to the equation which describes the radial distribution of concentration of an ideal solute at sedimentation equilibrium (see, for example, 32Minton A.P. Schuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Brikhäuser, Boston1994: 81-93Google Scholar) using the programs XLAEQ and EQASSOC (supplied by Beckman; see 33van Holde K.E. Physical Biochemistry. Prentice-Hall, Inc., New York1985: 225-291Google Scholar). The value of the partial specific volume of φ29 SSB was estimated from its amino acid composition (34Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Horton H.C. Rowe A.J. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge1993: 90-125Google Scholar) as 0.739 ml g−1. In velocity sedimentation experiments, φ29 SSB (ranging in concentration from 10 to 30 μM) was centrifuged at 60,000 rpm and 20°C and radial scans at 230 nm were taken at 10-min intervals during 3 h. The analysis of the experimental data was performed in two ways: (i) by taking the derivative of the absorbance data to calculate the peak of the moving boundary (XLAVEL program, supplied by Beckman), and (ii) by using the second moment analysis of Goldberg (35Goldberg R.J. J. Phys. Chem. 1953; 57: 194Google Scholar) to locate the boundary position (VELGAMMA program, Beckman). The rate of the motion of the boundary was used for the estimation of the sedimentation coefficient. This value was corrected to standard conditions (water, 20°C; 33) to obtain the s20,w values. The translational frictional coefficient, f, of φ29 SSB was obtained by the classical Svedberg equation (see 36Waxman E. Laws W. Laue T.M. Emerson Y. Ross A.B.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3005-3012Google Scholar for review), f=Mr(1−vρ)NAs(Eq. 1) whereMr stands for the molecular weight of the protein obtained for equilibrium ultracentrifugation, is the solvent density, and N A is the Avogadro's constant. The global conformation of Ï†29 SSB in solution was modeled with rigid ellipsoids of revolution (the axis being a, b = c). Two models were considered, the prolate ellipsoid, in which a > b, and the oblate ellipsoid, characterized by a < b. In both cases, the rotational parameters of the protein are related to the hydrated protein volume V and asymmetry (given by the axial ratio p = a/b) in the following way, V=KTϕglobal 6η4gperp +2gpar (Eq. 2) where Ï†global stands for the rotational correlation time of the decay of the anisotropy assigned to the global motion of the entire protein (37Wahl P.H.

Radium. 1936; 7: 1-11Google Scholar, 41Cantor C.R. Shimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry, Part II. Freeman W. H. and Co., San Francisco1980Google Scholar). The gpar and gperp values were calculated as gpar =2p2−1/3p(p−s)(Eq. 3) gperp =2p4−1/3p2p2−1s−p(Eq. 4) s=p2−1−1/2lnp+p2−11/2(Eq. 5) s=q2−1−1/2ATNq2−11/2( where q=1/p)(Eq. 6) for the oblate ellipsoid model. The experimentally determined value of Ï†global (7.0 Â± 0.5 ns; see 30Soengas M.S. Mateo R.C. Salas M. Acuña A.U. Gutiérrez C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 295-302Google Scholar) was introduced for axial ratio ranging from 0.1 to 1 (oblate model) and 1 to 10 (prolate model), in Equation 2 to obtain the V values of the set of ellipsoids compatible with the experimental rotational parameters. The theoretical translational frictional coefficient, ftheo corresponding to each of these ellipsoids was obtained as 6Ï€Î·RsphF. Where Rsph stands for the radius of a sphere with the same volume V as the ellipsoid, and F is the translational Perrin factor whose value also depend on p (41Cantor C.R. Shimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry, Part II. Freeman W. H. and Co., San Francisco1980Google Scholar). The F values for the prolate and oblate ellipsoids, Fobl and Fpro, respectively, where calculated as, Fobl=1−q21/2q2/3ln1+1−q21/2q(Eq. 7) Fpro=q2−11/2q2/3ATN1−q21/2(Eq. 8) where q = 1/p. The comparison of the experimentally determined fobs and the estimated ftheo provides the range of ellipsoids compatible with the translational and rotational hydrodynamic behavior of φ29 SSB. The hydration extent of the protein, Δ (gram of H2O/g of protein) was estimated as Δ = (V − Vanh)/Vanh, where Vanh (estimated from Ranh = 0.723 × 10−8 Mr(null)/1;3; see 36Waxman E. Laws W. Laue T.M. Emerson Y. Ross A.B.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3005-3012Google Scholar for further details) corresponds to the anhydrous volume of a sphere whose Mr is that of φ29 SSB. CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco Model J-700, at 0.2-nm intervals and, unless otherwise stated, at 25°C and at a scan speed of 20 nm/min. The absorbance of the samples was kept below 0.1 over the measuring range. φ29 SSB (6.5 μM) CD spectra were obtained with 0.1-cm cells in the absence and presence of an excess of ssDNA (350 μM nucleotide). DNA binding was tested by parallel measurements of the quenching of the intrinsic protein fluorescence upon DNA addition as described previously (6Soengas M.S. Esteban J.A. Salas M. Gutiérrez C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 213-226Google Scholar). When required, small amounts of 2.5 M NaOH from a concentrated stock were added to the indicated amount of free or bound φ29 SSB (the volume change at the end of the titration was <1%), the pH being simultaneously measured. The effect of temperature on the protein conformational stability was analyzed by recording the spectra after maintaining the protein or protein-ssDNA solution for 5 min at the different temperatures. Controls were made to ensure that the variations in the pH due to temperature change did not affect the far-UV CD spectra of the protein. Plotted CD data, as mean residue ellipticity, corresponded to an average of three scans. Corrections for the contribution of the buffer and DNA to the optical activity were made when necessary. The relative amount of α-helix, β-sheet, and β-turns of φ29 SSB where estimated with the CONTIN (version 2) program (42Provencher, S. W., (1984) EMBL Technical Report DAO7.Google Scholar) by fitting the φ29 SSB spectra, between 190 and 240 nm, to those of 16 proteins of known secondary structure (43Chang T.C. Wu C.C.-S. Yang J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 91: 13-31Google Scholar) as outlined by Provencher and Glöckner (44Provencher S.W. Glöckner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Google Scholar). Alternatively, convex constraint analysis, as described by the Fasman group (45Perczel A. Hollósi M. Tusnády G. Fasman G.D. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 669-679Google Scholar, 46Perczel A. Park K. Fasman G.D. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1992; 13: 57-69Google Scholar), were also made, but the best fits were not so accurate. ssDNA spectra (dT20, dA16, poly(dT), or poly(dA)) were recorded in buffer A, with 1-cm path length cells. Five scans were averaged and the data were plotted as ϵL−ϵR (Δϵ) per mol of nucleotide. Stacking interactions between neighboring nucleotides were analyzed by increasing the temperature of the solution. Spectra were taken after keeping ssDNA samples 5 min at the desired temperature. To analyze the effect of φ29 SSB binding on the ssDNA structure, spectra were recorded after adding small aliquots of a concentrated protein stock (∼7 mg/ml) to a fixed amount of the indicated ssDNA (∼110 μM nucleotide). Buffer and protein optical activity were substracted to obtain the corrected ssDNA spectra. Saturation was considered to be reached when further protein addition did not induce any change in CD spectra. The nucleotide site size, that is, the number of nucleotides covered by a protein monomer, was calculated from the ratio DNA/SSB that induced the maximal change at wavelengths corresponding to the maximal activity of free ssDNA. Steady-state measurements of the intrinsic fluorescence of φ29 SSB were performed at 25°C in a SLM-8000D photon counting L-format fluorimeter fitted with Glan-Thompson polarizers at λexc = 276 nm and λem = 308 nm (slits set to 2 and 4 nm, respectively; 47Mateo C.R. Lillo M.P. González-Rodríguez J. Acuña A.U. Eur. Biophys. J. 1991; 20: 41-52Google Scholar). The anisotropy, <r>, of φ29 SSB fluoresence emission was obtained as described in the accompanying paper (30Soengas M.S. Mateo R.C. Salas M. Acuña A.U. Gutiérrez C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 295-302Google Scholar). Complex formation with ssDNA was monitored by measuring the increase in steady-state anisotropy together with the quenching of the fluorescence emission at magic angle (I54) and during reverse titrations of a fixed amount of φ29 SSB (10 μM) with increasing quantities of ssDNA. Corrections for dilution and inner filter effect due to ssDNA absorption were made when necessary as described previously (6Soengas M.S. Esteban J.A. Salas M. Gutiérrez C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 213-226Google Scholar). The solution conformation of φ29 SSB was approached by analyzing hydrodynamic parameters directly dependent on the protein aggregation state, size, and shape. The initial step in the modeling process was the estimation, by analytical ultracentrifugation techniques (sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity), of the molecular weight and the sedimentation and frictional coefficients of φ29 SSB.

Open table in a new tab The experimental data corresponding to the radial distribution of φ29 SSB concentration after sedimentation equilibrium were best fitted to equations described for a monomeric behavior of a protein. An example for 12 μM SSB centrifuged at 30,000 rpm is depicted in Fig. 1. The fitting procedures (χ2 = 6.4 × 10−3) gave an average of 13,600 ± 400, for the Mr of φ29 SSB, very close to the calculated from its amino acid composition (13,343; see 26Martín G. Lázaro J.M. Méndez E. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3663-3672Google Scholar). This confirms the results previously obtained with indirect techniques (gel filtration chromatography; 6Soengas M.S. Esteban J.A. Salas M. Gutiérrez C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 213-226Google Scholar), and therefore, φ29 SSB can be confidently considered as a monomer in solution, at least in the concentration range used for the analysis of its functional activities and ssDNA binding properties. Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out to determine the sedimentation and diffusion coefficients, s20,w and D20,w, respectively. The sedimentation process of a 60,000 rpm centrifugation of φ29 SSB was analyzed by following the movement of the boundary as described elsewhere (see 48Hansen J.C. Lebowitz J. Demeler B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13155-13163Google Scholar, for a review). For the above indicated protein range, the estimated s20,w and D20,w (procedures not shown) were 1.7 ± 0.1 S and (1.18 ± 0.07) × 10−6 cm2 s−1, respectively. By including the Mr and s20,w values in the Svedberg equation (see “Materials and Methods,”Equation 1) the translational frictional coefficient, fobs, was computed as (3.5 ± 0.1) × 108 gs−1 (Table I). It is well known that the value of the frictional coefficient does not allow, by itself, the distinction between a symmetric but rigid structure from a highly asymmetric but flexible conformations (see for examples, 36Waxman E. Laws W. Laue T.M. Emerson Y. Ross A.B.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3005-3012Google Scholar, 48Hansen J.C. Lebowitz J. Demeler B.

Therefore, another hydrodynamic parameter was considered to restrict the size and shape of φ29 SSB, the rotational depolarizat"

The selective suppression in transport of H-2 (but not of PD1) molecules in cells reconstituted for the expression of peptide transporter and LMP genes implied that an additional factor(s) is involved in the assembly of class I complexes.

It is well established that the efficient transport of class I molecules to the cell surface depends on the assembly of the heavy chain/β2m dimer with peptides that are usually 8-9 amino acids long. Such peptides, generated by cleavage of proteins in the cytosol, are actively transported by a heterodimeric complex, known as transporter associated with antigen presentation (TAP), into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where assembly with class I molecules takes place. The trimeric complex is then transported through the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface. Mutant cell lines (5Yewdell J.W. Bennink J.R. Adv. Immunol. 1992; 52: 1-123Google Scholar, 6Germain R.N.

Cell lines and knockout mice lacking β2m expression also fail to display normal cell surface class I MHC molecules (13Williams D.B. Barber B.H. Flavell R.A. Allen H. J.

Smithies O. Science. 1990; 248: 1227-1230Google Scholar). The crucial role of β2m is evident from data demonstrating that it stabilizes cell surface expression of class I heavy chains, facilitates the binding of purified class I molecules to antigenic peptides both on cells and plastic surfaces, and generates additional high affinity peptide-binding sites in preparations of soluble purified class I molecules (16Rock K.L. Rothstein L.E. Gamble S.R. Benacerraf B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7517-7521Google Scholar, 17Vitiello A. Potter T.A. Sherman L.A.

A. 1992; 89: 2242-2250Google Scholar). These data, as well as the finding that β2m determines the fate of class I heavy chains (21Otten G.R. Bikoff E. Ribaudo R.K. Kozlowski S. Margulies D.H. Germain R. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3723-3732Google Scholar), suggest that β2m may play a predominant role in maintaining the class I heavy chain in a non-denatured conformation suitable for terminal folding upon binding of peptide. Such a model predicts a role for extracellular β2m in providing a microenvironment that supports the existence of cell surface β2m/heavy chain dimers capable of binding peptides. Indeed, both constitutive and peptide-induced class I surface expression can be augmented markedly, in some cases, by the presence of exogenous β2m (21Otten G.R. Bikoff E. Ribaudo R.K. Kozlowski S. Margulies D.H. Germain R. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3723-3732Google Scholar, 22Abdel Motal U. Zhou M.X. Siddiqi A.R. Jondal M. Scand. J. Immunol. 1993; 38: 395-400Google Scholar). The existence of a substantial pool of inactive heavy chains on the cell surface, which are able to bind added β2m at 37°C, has been demonstrated by Rock et al. (23Rock K.L. Gamble S. Rothstein L. Gramm C. Benacerraf B. Cell. 1991; 65: 611-620Google Scholar), implying a physiological role for exogenous β2m in maintaining cell surface class I heavy chains in a state suitable for subsequent binding of exogenous peptides. Increased levels of β2m can be detected both in the peripheral circulation and locally, in many abnormal in vivo conditions (24Manicourt D. Brauman H. Orloff S. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1978; 37: 328-332Google Scholar, 25Maury C.P.J. Helve T. Sjoblom C. Rheumatol. Int. 1982; 2: 145-149Google Scholar, 26Child J.A. Spati B. Illingworth S.

Acta. 1981; 109: 245-255Google Scholar). Additionally, lymphoid and hepatoma cells have been shown to produce and secrete β2m when stimulated with various cytokines (29Hoffmann B. Baas H. Nishanian P. Faisal M. Figlin R.A. Sarna G.P. Fahey J.L. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1992; 88: 548-554Google Scholar, 30Homma T. Tsujinaka T. Kido Y. Yasuda T. Murata A. Mori T. Eur. Surg. Res. 1992; 24: 204-210Google Scholar). If these augmented levels facilitate the accumulation of class I-bound peptides, then the regulation of β2m secretion may have functional consequences. Supportive of such a role are data demonstrating the strong in vivo priming of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes to class I-binding peptides if the latter are combined with β2m when injected into mice (31Rock K.L. Fleischacker C. Gamble S. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1244-1252Google Scholar). We have shown previously that, in primary embryonal fibroblasts from transgenic mice expressing both endogenous H-2 genes and a miniature swine class I transgene (PD1), transformation with the highly oncogenic Ad12 results in inhibition of the transport of newly synthesized class I molecules via the Golgi apparatus, a significant reduction in peptide transporter (TAP1 and TAP2) and in proteasome-associated (LMP2 and LMP7) gene expression, and in suppression of cell surface expression of all class I antigens (12Rotem-Yehudar R. Winograd S. Sela S. Coligan J.E. Ehrlich R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 477-488Google Scholar, 32Shemesh J. Rotem-Yehudar R. Ehrlich R. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5544-5548Google Scholar, 33Shemesh J.

Re-expression of TAP and LMP in an Ad12-transformed cell line completely reconstituted the cell surface expression and transport of PD1 and induced the transport of 20% of the H-2Db molecules, but did not affect the transport or expression of H-2Kb molecules (34Rotem-Yehudar R. Groettrup M. Soza A. Kloetzel P.-M. Ehrlich R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 499-514Google Scholar). These data, as well as the fact that in Ad12-transformed cells, H-2 molecules were not recognized by conformation-independent antibodies (33Shemesh J. Ehrlich R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15704-15711Google Scholar, 34Rotem-Yehudar R. Groettrup M. Soza A. Kloetzel P.-M. Ehrlich R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 499-514Google Scholar), raised the possibility that either the synthesis of β2m in these cells is defective and the class I heavy chains compete for a limited amount of β2m molecules (PD1 being more competitive), or that Ad12-transformed cells are deficient in a factor(s) that facilitate the assembly of β2m with a particular set of class I heavy chains (H-2). We now present data substantiating that β2m, as well as H-2Db and H-2Kb, are transcribed and translated in Ad12-transformed cells. However, the results show an abnormal turnover of β2m molecules and suggest the existence of a novel β2m-binding molecule(s) that acts to retain β2m in the transformed cells. The Ad12-transformed (VAD12.79, VAD12.42, VAD12.20, VAD12.25, VAD12.36, VAD12.54, and VAD12.43), E1Ad5-transformed (A5O1 and A5O5), and TAP-transfected cell lines and the normal cell line M1 have been described previously (32Shemesh J. Rotem-Yehudar R. Ehrlich R. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5544-5548Google Scholar, 33Shemesh J. Ehrlich R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15704-15711Google Scholar, 34Rotem-Yehudar R. Groettrup M. Soza A. Kloetzel P.-M. Ehrlich R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 499-514Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, gentamycin, and amphotericin B at the recommended concentrations (35Jacoby W.B. Pastan I.H. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 58: 110-116Google Scholar). Media and supplements were purchased from Biological Industries (Bet Ha'emek, Israel). Cell lines were treated with 600 units/ml α/β interferons (Lee Biomolecular Research Inc., San Diego, CA) for 16 h, or 100 units/ml γ-interferon (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany) for 48 h before harvesting. TAP2-transfected Ad12-transformed cells (VAD12.79 Cl1.1, 34Rotem-Yehudar R. Groettrup M. Soza A. Kloetzel P.-M. Ehrlich R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 499-514Google Scholar) were transfected by the calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitation method (34Rotem-Yehudar R. Groettrup M. Soza A. Kloetzel P.-M. Ehrlich R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 499-514Google Scholar). The transfection mixture contained 10 μg of plasmid DNA (the β2m gene expressed from an actin promoter in PBr was constructed in Dr. D. Margulies' laboratory (NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD)), 1 μg of plasmid DNA containing the hygromycin gene, and 5 μg of carrier DNA (sheared salmon sperm DNA, Sigma). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were washed with PBS, fresh media was added and after an additional 24 h the medium was supplemented with 110 units/ml hygromycin B (Calbiochem). Following selection of hygromycin-resistant cells, individual cell colonies were isolated and expanded in culture. The following antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation: 20.8.4S (recognizes the α1/α2 epitope on H-2Kb; 36Ozato K. Sachs D.H. J. Immunol. 1981; 126: 317-321Google Scholar); B22.249 (recognizes an α1 epitope on H-2Db; 36Ozato K. Sachs D.H. J.

Gorham J.R. Vet. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1987; 15: 337-376Google Scholar). Rabbit antibodies directed against β2m were a kind gift from Dr. J. E. Coligan (NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD). Cells were grown to 80% confluence and starved for 15 min in methionine-free medium. They were then labeled in methionine-free medium containing 250 mCi/ml [35S]methionine (Amersham International, Little Chalfort, United Kingdom (UK)) for 15 min unless otherwise indicated, washed with PBS, and chased for the indicated intervals. Cells that were labeled for 15 h were incubated in methionine-free medium containing 16% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 mCi/ml [35S]methionine. The cells were lysed with buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), and 150 mM NaCl. The immunoprecipitates were washed with buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), and 150 mM NaCl. For Endo H treatment, immunoprecipitates were eluted by adding 25 μl containing 50 mM Tris (pH 8), 1% SDS, and boiled for 5 min. The samples were centrifuged and the supernatant was added to 25 μl of 50 mM citrate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 500 units of Endo H (New England Biolabs). The samples were incubated at 37°C for 18 h, followed by the addition of sample buffer. All the buffers contained the following protease inhibitors; 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma). The immunoprecipitates were fractionated on 10 or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and X-Omat AR x-ray films (Eastman Kodak Co.) were exposed to the dried gels. Membranes were prepared as described (38New YorkColigan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley μ Sons, New York1994: 81.2-8.1.5Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates were separated into two fractions: one containing cell membranes and the other containing soluble proteins. Cell pellets (5 × 107/ml) were resuspended in ice-cold Dounce buffer (10 mM Tris (pH 7.6), 0.5 mM MgCl) with protein inhibitors and incubated on ice for 30 min. The cells were lysed with a Dounce homogenizer, and the tonicity of the solution was restored by adding NaCl to a final concentration of 0.15 M. The suspension was spun at 500 × g to remove the nuclei, and the supernatant was further centrifuged for 45 min at 100,000 × g at 4°C. The supernatant, which contained soluble proteins, was transferred to a separate tube, and the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer. The following probes have been described previously (32Shemesh J. Rotem-Yehudar R. Ehrlich R. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5544-5548Google Scholar, 33Shemesh J. Ehrlich R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15704-15711Google Scholar, 34Rotem-Yehudar R. Groettrup M. Soza A. Kloetzel P.-M. Ehrlich R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 499-514Google Scholar); the actin probe was a PstI-PstI fragment from chicken β actin cDNA, the PD1-specific probe was a SacI-BamHI genomic fragment containing exons 2-7 of the PD1 gene, the H-2 probe was an EcoRI-HindIII fragment derived from pH-2d33 (H-2Kd), the β2m probe was a PstI-PstI fragment from β2m cDNA, and the histone probe was a BamHI genomic fragment. Plasmids containing H-2Kb cDNA and H-2Db genomic (pMo/Db) fragments (40Levitsky H.I. Lazenby A. Hayashi R.J. Pardoll D.M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1215-1224Google Scholar) were used as templates for PCR reactions and were a kind gift from Dr. L. Eisenbach (The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel) and from Dr. D. Pardoll (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD), respectively. The hybridization solution contained 4 × SSC, 50% formamide, 0.2% SDS, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, and 100 μg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA. Hybridizations were carried out at 42°C, followed by washes with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature, and 0.2 × SSC at temperatures ranging between 55 and 65°C. After stripping with a boiling solution of 0.1% SDS, the blots were used for additional hybridizations. Cytoplasmic RNA was prepared using a modification of the White and Bancroft method (41White B.A. Bancroft F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8569-8572Google Scholar), as described previously (34Rotem-Yehudar R. Groettrup M. Soza A. Kloetzel P.-M. Ehrlich R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 499-514Google Scholar). RNA was denatured and fractionated on a 1.2% formaldehyde/formamide agarose gel, blotted onto a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham International, Little Chalfort, UK) and hybridized with the appropriate probe, which had been labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Rotem Industries, Dimona, Israel), using a Random Priming labeling kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Polysomes were fractionated as described previously (42Meyuhas O. Thompson Jr., E.A. Perry R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2691-2699Google Scholar). Cells were grown to 80% confluence and harvested by trypsinization (0.25 M trypsin EDTA; Biological Industries, Israel). A quantity of 6 × 107 cells was lysed per fractionation. The cells were washed with PBS, and cell pellets were kept at −70°C until used. Trypsin, PBS, and media contained 100 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma). Cells were thawed on ice and suspended in 450 μl of polysomal buffer containing 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 1.5 mM MgCl2, and 50 μl of ribonucleoside vanadyl complexes (200 mM) (New England Biolabs). Cells were lysed following the addition of 60 μl of polysomal buffer containing 10% Triton X-100 and 10% deoxycholate by brief mixing before and after 3 min of incubation on ice. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation for 3 min at 4°C, and the postnuclear supernatant was diluted with an equal volume of 25 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 25 mM NaCl, 0.14 M sucrose, 500 μg/ml heparin, 0.05% Triton X-100. The suspension was layered over 35 ml of 15-45% (w/w) sucrose gradient with a 2-ml cushion of 45% sucrose. The sucrose solution contained 25 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 25 ml of NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2. A volume of 36 μl of heparin (from a stock solution of 200 μg/ml) was added to each gradient. The gradients were centrifuged at 26,000 rpm for 4 h at 4°C in a Beckman SW27 rotor. After centrifugation, 38 fractions of 1 ml each were collected into tubes containing 10 μl of 10% SDS. The A260 was monitored, the polysome profile was determined, and each 2-3 tubes were pooled to give a total of 8-10 tubes. RNA was extracted from polysomal and subpolysomal fractions as described before. Only gradients with identical polysomal profiles were compared. Reverse transcription of RNA was carried out for 1 h at 42°C, in 20 μl of PCR buffer II (Perkin Elmer) containing 1 μg of total cellular RNA, 2.5 μM oligo(dT)18 primer (New England Biolabs), 1 mM nucleotide mixture, 5 mM MgCl2, 35 units of ribonuclease inhibitor (MBI Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania), and 7 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse trascriptase (Promega, Madison, WI). The cDNA was stored at −20°C until used. PCR was carried out with 1 μl of the cDNA, and 50 pmol of the following primers (40Levitsky H.I. Lazenby A. Hayashi R.J. Pardoll D.M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1215-1224Google Scholar): a 5′ consensus primer for H-Db and H-2Kb (5′-CGC GAC GCT GCT GCG CAC AG-3′), and 3′ primers specific for H-2Db (5′-TAC AAT CTC GGA GAG ACA TT-3′) or H-2Kb (5′-TAC AAT CTG GGA GAG ACA GA-3′), 40 μM nucleotide mixture, and 0.375 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega). Each PCR cycle included 1 min of denaturation at 94°C, 1 min of annealing at 65°C, and 1 min of extension/synthesis at 72°C. After the appropriate number of PCR cycles (MiniCycler, MJ Research Inc., Watertown, MA), 10 μl or less of the reaction mix were fractionated on a 1% agarose gel. The gel was soaked twice for 20 min in 1.5 M NaCl, 0.5 M NaOH at room temperature and blotted onto a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham International, Little Chalfort, UK) with transfer buffer containing 1.5 M NaCl, 0.25 M NaOH. The membrane was baked for 10 min at 80°C, and the DNA was cross-linked to the membrane by exposure to UV. Since both genes yield an RT-PCR product that is identical in size, two positive and two negative controls were included in each set of reactions. A plasmid containing a genomic fragment from H-2Db was amplified with H-2Db primers and with H-2Kb primers, and a plasmid containing H-2Kb cDNA was amplified with H-2Kb primers and with H-2Db primers. Since the yield of the PCR product is proportional to the starting amount of the template, only under conditions in which PCR amplification proceeds exponentially at a constant efficiency (43Moonan K.E. Beck C. Holzmayer T.A. Chin J.E. Wunder J.S. Andruilis I.L. Gazdar A.F. Willman C.L. Griffin B. Von Hoff D.D. Robinson I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A titration curve for amplified cDNA from each cell line and for each gene was plotted to ensure that the number of amplification cycles was below the plateau level. Detailed analysis of the results is presented under “Results.” Dried radioactive gels or blots were exposed to a phosphoimager screen and analyzed with a phosphoimager (Fuji BAS1000, Tokyo, Japan). The data are presented as phosphostimulated luminescence (PSL) units. In some cases, following scanning densitometric analysis of the x-ray films was performed. Due to post-transcriptional interference with class I assembly and transport (32Shemesh J. Rotem-Yehudar R. Ehrlich R. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5544-5548Google Scholar, 33Shemesh J. Ehrlich R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15704-15711Google Scholar), most of the Ad12-transformed cell lines express very low levels of cell surface class I antigens despite having near normal levels of class I mRNA. Fig. 1 (A and B) substantiates previous data from our laboratory (12Rotem-Yehudar R. Winograd S. Sela S. Coligan J.E. Ehrlich R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 477-488Google Scholar, 32Shemesh J. Rotem-Yehudar R. Ehrlich R. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5544-5548Google Scholar), demonstrating that nearly all the Ad12-transformed cell lines express normal or elevated levels of the miniature swine class I transgene (PD1) mRNA, and a normal level or less than a 2-fold reduction in H-2 mRNA, as compared with that in the normal cell lines as exemplified by M1. The level of class I mRNA in E1Ad5-transformed cells is either normal or enhanced. Full restoration of cell surface expression level and transport of PD1 was achieved by re-expression of peptide transporter molecules in the Ad12-transformed cell line VAD12.79 (12Rotem-Yehudar R. Winograd S. Sela S. Coligan J.E. Ehrlich R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 477-488Google Scholar) but the expression level of H-2Db was only partially restored, and the expression level of H-2Kb remained very low in these TAP-reconstituted and in TAP+LMP-reconstituted cells (12Rotem-Yehudar R. Winograd S. Sela S. Coligan J.E. Ehrlich R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 477-488Google Scholar, 34Rotem-Yehudar R. Groettrup M. Soza A. Kloetzel P.-M. Ehrlich R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 499-514Google Scholar). In order to examine whether the selective suppression of H-2Kb expression was mediated by H-2Kb-specific gene regulatory elements, the mRNA levels of the individual H-2 genes were analyzed in the transformed cells. Since efficient detection and quantitation of H-2 mRNA by Northern blot analysis requires a probe that does not distinguish H-2K from H-2D mRNA, we utilized a quantitative RT-PCR assay in order to determine the relative amounts of mRNA encoded by each of these genes. A total of 5-30 PCR cycles were performed for each of the cDNAs that were reverse-transcribed from total RNA. The PCR products were fractionated on agarose gels, blotted, hybridized to an H-2 probe, and the radioactive signal was quantitated, following various exposure periods. Fig. 2A shows the results of the analyses of H-2 cDNA in one of the transformed cell lines, using specific primers for H-2Kb and H-2Db. The primers were complementary to the same region in the two genes, thus minimizing possible differences that could result from DNA positioning or conformation. Since both sets of primers gave a band of the same size, the specificity of the PCR reaction was proved by the generation of the expected bands, using H-2Kb and H-2Db plasmid DNA templates (Fig. 2B). Analysis of the data showed a linear response curve when the number of PCR cycles ranged between 10 and 25. Similar response curves were obtained for E1Ad5-transformed (A5O1 and A5O5), Ad12-transformed (VAD12.79 and VAD12.42), and the normal cell line M1. Using the linear part of the curves, we compared the mRNA levels for each of the genes in the different cell lines. A representative display of the results is shown in Fig. 2B. The ratios in the levels between H-2Kb and H-2Db were determined, and the values are presented in Table I. These analyses showed that in Ad12-transformed, as well as in the normal and E1Ad5-transformed cell lines the ratio between H-2Kb and H-2Db transcripts is about 1, implying that the level of H-2D and H-2K mRNA is about the same. Thus, in Ad12-transformed cells H-2Kb is not selectively suppressed at the transcriptional level.Fig. 2Comparison of steady state level of H-2Kb and H-2Db mRNA as determined by RT-PCR in normal and Ad-transformed cell lines. RT-PCR was carried out using primers specific for H-2Kb and H-2Db. PCR products were fractionated on agarose gels, blotted onto nylon membranes, and hybridized with an H-2 probe. Each blot was exposed for various time intervals, assuring that of all test points were at the linear detection range of the phosphoimager. A response curve for amplified cDNA from each cell line and for each gene (radioactive signals are presented as log PSL), was plotted as a function of the number of PCR cycles. Representative response curves are shown in A. A representative gel, which includes samples from a normal cell line (M1), E1Ad5-transformed cell line (A5O1 and A5O5) and Ad12-transformed cell lines (VAD12.79 and VAD12.42), is shown in B. The blot was exposed for various intervals, and the results of the best exposure times are displayed. Specificity controls using plasmid DNAs as templates are shown in the first four lanes.

https://openalex.org/W2127306204,"The single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) of Bacillus subtilis phage φ29 is absolutely required for viral DNA replication in vivo. About ∼95% of the intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence of φ29 SSB is quenched upon binding to ssDNA, making tyrosine residues strong candidates to be directly involved in complex formation with ssDNA. Thus, we have studied the spectroscopic properties of the φ29 SSB tyrosines (Tyr-50, Tyr-57, and Tyr-76) using steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements. φ29 SSB tyrosines do not seem to be highly restricted by strong interactions with neighbor residues, as suggested by (i) the high value of the average quantum yield of the φ29 SSB fluorescence emission (φF = 0.067 ± 0.010), (ii) the fast motions of the tyrosine side chains (φshort = 0.14 ± 0.06 ns), and (iii) the lack of tyrosinate emission at neutral pH. Stern-Volmer analysis of the quenching by acrylamide and I− indicates that φ29 SSB tyrosines are surrounded by a negatively charged environment and located in a relatively exposed protein domain, accessible to the solvent and, likely, to ssDNA. Changes in the intrinsic fluorescence upon ssDNA binding allowed us to determine that temperature has an opposite effect on the thermodynamic parameters K (intrinsic binding constant) and ω(cooperativity) defining φ29 SSB-poly(dT) interaction, the effective DNA binding constant, Keff = Kω, being largely independent of temperature. Altogether, the fluorescent properties of φ29 SSB tyrosines are consistent with a direct participation in complex formation with ssDNA.

Altogether, the fluorescent properties of φ29 SSB tyrosines are consistent with a direct participation in complex formation with ssDNA. Interactions of nucleic acids and proteins provide the structural framework for a wide variety of biological processes. Among them, complexes formed by the association of single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (SSBs) 1The abbreviations used are: SSB(s)single-stranded DNA-binding protein(s)5-MeOI5-methoxyindoleNAcTyrAN-acetyl-L-tyrosine amidentnucleotide(s)ssDNAsingle-stranded DNAPf3 phagePseudomonas aeruginosa filamentous bacteriophage. with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) are of particular interest. First, they modulate key processes of DNA metabolism: DNA replication and DNA repair (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication.

Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 54-71Google Scholar). Second, although all SSBs bind ssDNA with high affinity, the functional outcome of this interaction could be radically different. Thus, while most of them activate DNA replication, e.g. Escherichia coli SSB, T4 gp32, T7 gene 2.5 protein, φ29 SSB, RP-A (reviewed in 1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication.

Thus, SSBs of filamentous phages M13, fd and f1 or Pf3 block DNA replication by preventing the conversion of the viral strand into the replicative form (8Salstrom J.S. Pratt D. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 61: 489-501Google Scholar). Third, detailed structural studies of a few SSBs have revealed that virtually each SSB interacts with DNA using a characteristic and largely specific set of contacts (9Casas-Finet J.R. Karpel R.L.

In vitro, φ29 SSB is essential to obtain full-length φ29 DNA when the amount of DNA used as template is low (16Blanco L. Lázaro J.M. de Vega M. Bonnin A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12198-12202Google Scholar), the closest condition to the initial steps of viral infection. Even when the amount of DNA template is high, φ29 SSB is important for the in vitro system, increasing several times dNTP incorporation (17Martín G. Lázaro J.M. Méndez E. Salas M. Nucleic Acids. Res. 1989; 17: 3663-3672Google Scholar, 18Gutiérrez C. Martín G. Sogo J.M. Salas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2104-2111Google Scholar). This stimulatory effect is related to binding to the ssDNA produced during φ29 DNA replication (19Gutiérrez C. Sogo J.M. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 983-994Google Scholar), which, likely, protects it from nuclease degradation and prevents unproductive binding of the φ29 DNA polymerase. φ29 SSB also disrupts, by its helix-destabilizing activity, the secondary structure formed in ssDNA parts of φ29 replicative intermediates. This activity has been proposed to account for the stimulation of the DNA elongation velocity by φ29 DNA polymerase under conditions in which the DNA opening is impaired (20Soengas M.S. Gutiérrez C. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 517-529Google Scholar). The thermodynamic parameters defining φ29 SSB-ssDNA complex formation have been recently described: it binds to ssDNA with relatively low affinity (Keff = 105M−1) and moderate cooperativity (ω= 50-70), covering 3-4 nt per monomer, probably as a single array of protein units along the DNA (21Soengas M.S. Esteban J.A. Salas M. Gutiérrez C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 213-226Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism that accounts for the requirement of φ29 SSB during viral DNA replication is still unknown. The lack of significant sequence homology with other SSBs (18Gutiérrez C. Martín G. Sogo J.M. Salas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2104-2111Google Scholar) has made difficult the identification of the φ29 SSB domain(s) responsible for DNA binding and protein-protein contacts that lead to a stable protein-DNA interaction. Interestingly, complex formation occurs with significant alterations in the intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence of φ29 SSB. Thus, 95% of the protein fluorescence is quenched upon binding (21Soengas M.S. Esteban J.A. Salas M. Gutiérrez C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 213-226Google Scholar), this value being one of the highest reported for a SSB, and similar to that observed for proteins that bind DNA through direct interactions with tyrosine residues (22Härd T. Hsu V. Sayre M.H. Geidusecheck E.P. Appelt K. Kearns D.R. Biochemistry. 1984; 28: 396-406Google Scholar). If the three tyrosines of φ29 SSB (at positions 50, 57, and 76) were in fact forming part of the domain directly involved in ssDNA complex organization, they should not be highly restricted by interactions with other neighboring residues and, likely, placed in an accessible domain of the protein. To test this possibility, we have characterized the global spectroscopic properties of the tyrosines of φ29 SSB by using complementary approaches: (i) steady-state and time-resolved measurements of the total emission and anisotropy of φ29 SSB fluorescence, (ii) analysis of the resistance of φ29 SSB tyrosines to undergo ionization by pH increase, and (iii) selective attenuation of the tyrosine fluorescence by small diffusible quenchers. In addition, the fluorescent properties of φ29 SSB were also considered to study ssDNA binding under different temperatures. Our results regarding the mobility and accessibility of φ29 SSB tyrosines strongly suggest a direct role of these residues in complex formation. In the accompanying paper (23Soengas M.S. Mateo C.R. Rivas G. Salas M. Acuña A.U. Gutiérrez C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 303-310Google Scholar), some of the fluorescence features of φ29 SSB tyrosines are combined with other spectroscopic and hydrodynamic studies, to model the conformational properties of φ29 SSB and the effect of complex formation on both φ29 SSB and ssDNA structure. All the solutions were made with distilled, deionized (MilliQ) and sterilized water, and finally filtered through 0.45-μm filters using a Millex-HA Filter Unit (Millipore). The buffer used in time-resolved fluorescence analysis was 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (20°C) (buffer A), while the buffer used in absorption and steady-state fluorescence studies was 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (20°C), 4% glycerol (buffer B). Poly(dT) was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. φ29 SSB was purified by differential ammonium sulfate fractionation of φ29-infected cellular extracts followed by phosphocellulose and DEAE-cellulose chromatography, essentially as described (20Soengas M.S. Gutiérrez C. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 517-529Google Scholar). Protein concentration was estimated by the Lowry (24Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar) method, using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Absorption spectra were carried out in a CARY 219 (Varian) at a constant temperature of 22°C with cells of path-lengths from 2 to 10 mm. Measurements of the intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence of φ29 SSB were recorded, unless otherwise stated, at 22°C. Fluorescence excitation and emission spectra, solute quenching experiments, as well as ssDNA binding assays were performed in a Schoeffel Instrument Corp. RRS100 spectrofluorimeter (slits set to 2 nm), with a 2-mm path-length cell, and corrected for residual emission of the buffers. Fluorescence quantum yield and fluorescence emission anisotropy measurements were carried out in a SLM-8000D photon counting fluorimeter fitted with Glan-Thompson polarizers. The excitation and emission slits were 4 and 8 nm, respectively. When necessary, corrections for wavelength dependence of the instrument response were taken into account as described elsewhere (25Acuña A.U. González J. Lillo P. Otón J.M. Photochem. Photobiol. 1984; 40: 351-359Google Scholar). The steady-state average fluorescence quantum yield (φFST) of the protein was calculated as in Demas and Crosby (26Demas J.N. Crosby G.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1971; 75: 991-1024Google Scholar) using an aqueous solution of 5-methoxy-indole (5-MeOI) as reference (φREF = 0.28 ± 0.01; 27Hersberger M.V. Lumry R.W. Photochem. Photobiol. 1976; 23: 391-397Google Scholar). Magic angle orientation of the polarizers was selected to avoid anisotropic effects (28Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983Google Scholar). The accessibility to solvent and the ionic environment of the fluorescent tyrosines of φ29 SSB were analyzed by monitoring the fluorescence quenching (λexc = 276 nm, λem = 308 nm) induced by adding increasing amounts of stock solutions (2.5 M) of neutral (acrylamide) or charged quenchers, I− (as KI) and Cs+ (as CsCl) to the protein sample (7-11 μM). To prevent iodide oxidation, and avoid light dispersion and chemical reactions (29Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3254-3263Google Scholar), Na2S2O3, at a final concentration of 200 μM, was added to the KI solution. Corrections for dilution and inner filter effect due to quencher absorption were made as described previously (21Soengas M.S. Esteban J.A. Salas M. Gutiérrez C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 213-226Google Scholar). Data were analyzed by Stern-Volmer plots of F0/F versus [Q], where F0 and F stand for the fluorescence intensities in the absence and in the presence of quencher, respectively, and [Q] is the quencher concentration. Since these plots were linear, the “static” quenching contribution was considered <10% (see “Discussion”), and the Stern-Volmer constant, Ksv, could be directly obtained from the slope of the line (see 30Eftink M.R. Dewey T.G. Biophysical and Biochemical Applications of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1991: 1-41Google Scholar and 31Eftink M.R. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1991; 35: 127-205Google Scholar). This parameter represents the weighted sum of the individual constants of the emitting tyrosine residues and, therefore, is referred as Ksv,eff in the text. Ksv,eff was used to calculate the bimolecular rate constant of the quenching process, kq,eff, from the expression Ksv,eff = kq,eff·, where is the weighted average lifetime of φ29 SSB fluorescence (see below). The fractional accessibility of the tyrosine residues to quencher was also estimated from the y axis intercept of double reciprocal plots as proposed by Lehrer (29Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3254-3263Google Scholar; see also 30Eftink M.R. Dewey T.G. Biophysical and Biochemical Applications of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1991: 1-41Google Scholar, 31Eftink M.R. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1991; 35: 127-205Google Scholar, 32Acuña A.U. López-Hernández F.J. Otón J.M. Biophys. Chem. 1982; 16: 253-260Google Scholar). The solid angle ω, under which the quencher can freely approach the tyrosine residues, was calculated as described (33Lux B. Gérard D. Laustriat G. FEBS Lett. 1977; 80: 66-70Google Scholar), taking the values of the diffusion constants of the acrylamide, the iodide ion and the tyrosyl residues as 2 × 10−5 cm2 s−1, 1.5 × 10−5 cm2 s−1, and 0, respectively (33Lux B. Gérard D. Laustriat G. FEBS Lett. 1977; 80: 66-70Google Scholar, 34Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 672-680Google Scholar). N-Acetyl-L-tyrosine amide (NAcTyrA) was taken as a control for a fully accessible residue. The effect of temperature on complex formation with ssDNA was analyzed by monitoring the fluorescence intensity changes during direct titrations of a fixed amount of poly(dT), 30-40 μM (in nt), with increasing amounts of φ29 SSB as described previously (21Soengas M.S. Esteban J.A. Salas M. Gutiérrez C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 213-226Google Scholar and references therein). The reaction buffer, buffer B, was adjusted to pH 7.5 at 20°C. Since in the temperature range analyzed (10-42°C) the pH variation (from pH 7.0 to 7.6) does not alter the global structural properties of φ29 SSB (see accompanying paper (23Soengas M.S. Mateo C.R. Rivas G. Salas M. Acuña A.U. Gutiérrez C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 303-310Google Scholar)), no pH readjustments were made during the binding measurements. The thermodynamic parameters, nucleotide site size, n, intrinsic affinity constant, K, and cooperativity, ω, were obtained by fitting the experimental data to the theoretical ones given by the McGhee and von Hippel's (35McGhee J.D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 469-489Google Scholar) equations for binding of proteins to large lattices with overlapping binding sites (see 21Soengas M.S. Esteban J.A. Salas M. Gutiérrez C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 213-226Google Scholar, for further details). The enthalpy and the entropy of the binding process were approximated from the slope and the y axis intercept of the best fit of van't Hoff plots of lnKωversus 1/T, as −ΔHo/R and ΔSo/R (R being the gas constant), respectively, since the response was linear and therefore ΔCpo = 0. Enthalpy and entropy changes were calculated for the indicated buffer and protein concentrations, and therefore named as ΔHobso and ΔSobso throughout the text. To determine the steady-state fluorescence anisotropy, <r>, of φ29 SSB, the corresponding vertically (I∥) and horizontally (I∥) polarized emission intensities elicited by vertically polarized excitation were corrected for background scattering and included in the described equations for L-format geometry fluorimeters. Thus, <r> was obtained from the ratio (I∥− GI∥)/(I∥+ 2GI∥). The constant G, accounting for the differential polarization sensitivity of the photodetection set-up, was estimated as described previously (36Mateo C.R. Lillo M.P. González-Rodríguez J. Acuña A.U. Eur. Biophys. J. 1991; 20: 41-52Google Scholar). The protein concentration (10-15 μM) used was low enough to prevent turbidity of the solution and, therefore, light scattering that could result in an artifactual depolarization of the fluorescence (28Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983Google Scholar). The decay of total fluorescence intensity, measured at a magic angle orientation of the polarizers, and those of the parallel and perpendicular components were recorded at 22°C in a time-correlated single-photon counting spectrometer, as described (36Mateo C.R. Lillo M.P. González-Rodríguez J. Acuña A.U. Eur. Biophys. J. 1991; 20: 41-52Google Scholar), for a protein concentration ranging from 10 to 30 μM. The samples were excited at 290 ± 4 nm with vertically polarized light pulses from a thyratron-gated nanosecond flash lamp (Edimburg Instr. El 199) filled with N2. The emission was isolated with a cut-off 310 nm (Schott KV) and a band-pass U-54 (Schott) filters, and detected with a Phillips XP2020Q photomultiplier. The kinetic parameters (lifetimes τi, and amplitudes, αi) of the decay of the fluorescence intensity were determined by iterative convolution of the signal recorded at magic angle, I54(t). The fitting routines were based on non-linear least-squares techniques (37Knight A.E. Selinger B.K. Spectrochim. Acta. 1971; 27: 1223-1234Google Scholar, 38Grinvald A. Steinberg I.Z. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 59: 583-589Google Scholar), using standard weighting factors (39Wahl Ph Chem. Phys. 1976; 22: 245-256Google Scholar). Wavelength-dependent timing effects in the photodetection were corrected as indicated (36Mateo C.R. Lillo M.P. González-Rodríguez J. Acuña A.U. Eur. Biophys. J. 1991; 20: 41-52Google Scholar). The weighted average lifetime, , was computed from, τ¯=∑iαiτi(Eq. 1) The fluorescence quantum yield of Ï†29 SSB was also estimated by time-resolved techniques as the ratio /Ï„R, where Ï„R stands for the radiative lifetime of tyrosine, 27 Â± 2 ns (33Lux B. Gérard D. Laustriat G. FEBS Lett. 1977; 80: 66-70Google Scholar, 40Wu P. Li Y-K. Talalay P. Brand L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7415-7422Google Scholar). The fluorescence anisotropy decay parameters (rotational correlation times, Ï†i, and amplitudes, Î²i) were determined by simultaneously fitting the measured intensities Iâˆ¥, Iâˆ¥ to a sum of exponentials using a non-linear least-squares global analysis method as detailed elsewhere (36Mateo C.R. Lillo M.P. González-Rodríguez J. Acuña A.U. Eur. Biophys. J. 1991; 20: 41-52Google Scholar). The experimental decay of the tyrosine fluorescence anisotropy of Ï†29 SSB was best fitted to a biexponential function, roβ1e−t/ϕ1+βze−t/ϕ2,∑βi=1(Eq. 2) where ro is the anisotropy of the tyrosine emission at t = 0. The decay of the fluorescence intensity and anisotropy contains subnanosecond components that were not well resolved in the flash lamp spectrometer. To have a better definition of these parameters, a set of both kinds of measurements were also carried out at the Laboratoire of Biochimie Moleculaire et Cellulaire (Orsay, Paris) with a Ti:sapphire (Spectra Physics) ps laser spectrometer, tuned at the third harmonic (287 nm) and with an instrument response function of 75 ps; the tyrosine emission was detected at 308 and 315 nm (Δλ = 4 nm). To measure the tendency of the tyrosine phenolic hydroxyl groups of φ29 SSB to undergo ionization, small amounts of a stock solution of 2.5 M NaOH were added to a solution containing the indicated concentrations of protein in buffer B, the change in volume at the end of the titration being <2.5%. The pH increase was recorded simultaneously with the decrease in the fluorescence at 308 nm. Free tyrosine was taken as a model since its fluorescent properties depending on the ionic environment in response to pH increase are well documented (41Tanford C. Hauenstein J.D. Rands D.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1956; 77: 6409-6413Google Scholar, 42Sela M. Katchalski E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1956; 78: 3986-3989Google Scholar, 43Searcy D.G. Montenay-Garestier T. Laston D.J. Hélène C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 953: 321-333Google Scholar) and no equivalent data were, to our knowledge, available for NAcTyrA. Corrections for dilution and filter effects were made as described (21Soengas M.S. Esteban J.A. Salas M. Gutiérrez C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 213-226Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of φ29 SSB (Fig. 1A) was analyzed with currently available computer programs to assess its basic theoretical structural features. According to Chou-Fasman secondary structure predictions (44Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 251-276Google Scholar), the region around tyrosines 50 and 57 (see Fig. 1A) showed a high probability of being in the protein surface. Moreover, analysis of the sequence-related hydropathy (45Pongor S. Guttieri M.J. Cohen L.M. Szalay A.A. DNA. 1985; 4: 319-326Google Scholar) indicated that this same region (from residues 49 to 69), based on the negative values of the Kyte-Doolittle index (Fig. 1B), could not be highly hydrophobic. In order to have a more reliable picture on both, the accessibility of the tyrosines of φ29 SSB to the solvent, and potentially to DNA, as well as their ionic environment, we analyzed the parameters defining the steady-state and the time-resolved intrinsic fluorescence properties of the φ29 SSB. The results obtained are summarized in Table I.Table I.Parameters of the tyrosine-dependent fluorescence of φ29 SSBSteady stateaAll the measurements were done in buffer B at 25°C.Time-resolvedbThese measurements were done in buffer A, at 25°C for λexc 294 nm and λem 310 nm.λexcmax276 nmτ1 (α1)0.4 ± 0.1 ns (0.39 ± 0.03)λemmax308 nmτ2 (α2)1.5 ± 0.1 ns (0.27 ± 0.03)φFST0.065 ± 0.010τ3 (α3)3.8 ± 0.1 ns (0.34 ± 0.03)NE3.1 ± 0.31.8 ± 0.1 nsAcrylφFTR0.067 ± 0.010kqcEffective quenching rate constant of the fluorescent tyrosines of φ29 SSB.

Open table in a new tab The fluorescence spectra of φ29 SSB free in solution, pH 7.5, and complexed with ssDNA are depicted in Fig. 2. The area under the excitation and emission spectra is reduced by 90% upon binding, although the same excitation and emission maxima, λexc = 276 nm and λem = 308 nm, respectively, were observed in both cases. Moreover, the emission spectra did not show any shoulder around 340 nm and, therefore, ionization or strong hydrogen bonding of the phenol hydroxyl group of tyrosine does not seem to take place (28Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983Google Scholar, 46Ross J.B.A. Laws W.R. Rousslang K.W. Wyssbrod H.R. Lakowicz J.R. Topics in Fluorescence Spectroscopy: Biochemical Applications. Plenum Press, New York1992: 1-63Google Scholar) either for free or complexed φ29 SSB. As expected for A-type proteins, that is, proteins lacking tryptophan in their primary structure (28Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983Google Scholar, 47Longworth J.W. Steiner R.F. Weinryb I. Excited States of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Plenum Press, New York1971: 319-484Google Scholar), no changes in either the shape of the excitation or the emission spectra were observed for the denatured φ29 SSB (4 M guanidinium chloride) (not shown). The anisotropy of φ29 SSB fluorescence monitored by continuous excitation with polarized light gave a value of 0.173 ± 0.010 (at 22°C), much smaller than the maximum (ro = 0.32) corresponding to immobilized tyrosines (48Lakowicz J.R. Laczko G. Gryczynski I. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 24: 97-100Google Scholar, 49Gryczynski I. Steiner R.F. Lakowicz J.R. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 39: 69-78Google Scholar). Different extrinsic mechanisms (once discarded light scattering and other artifactual effects, see “Materials and Methods”), like radiationless energy transfer among the residues or rotational mobility of the fluorophore and/or the protein, could account for this depolarization. The former is very unlikely since it would require spectral overlap among the excitation and emission spectra that is not observed (Fig. 2) and a much higher concentration of the residues (28Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983Google Scholar). To distinguish between localized motions of the tyrosine residues (that would be indicative of their rotational mobility) and global motions of the protein, the time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy of φ29 SSB was analyzed. The decay of the anisotropy was best fitted (χ2 = 1.17) to biexponential functions (see Equation 2 and Fig. 3) with a ro value (0.28 ± 0.01) close to the maximum expected for the tyrosine chromophore (see above), and two well separated correlation times. The fast one, φshort = 0.14 ± 0.06 ns, accounts for approximately one-fourth of the depolarization. The remaining anisotropy decays almost completely through the slow rotational component, φlong = 7.0 ± 0.5 ns. Since φshort<φlong the decay of the total anisotropy can be expressed as a product of two depolarizing processes, one due to fast movements of the protein segment containing the tyrosine residues (r′(t)), and another related to the global rotational motion of the whole protein (for reviews, see 50Lakowicz J.R. Topics in Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Vol. 2. Plenum Press, New York1991Google Scholar and 51Waxman E. Laws W. Laue T.M. Emerson Y. Ross A.B.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3005-3012Google Scholar), as, r(t)=r′(t)e−t/ϕcos(Eq. 3) where r′(t) = (ro− r∞)e−t/φshort+ r∞, r∞ being the limiting anisotropy that would be attained if the tumbling of the whole protein was arrested. According to the parameters of the anisotropy fitting (Table I), r∞ was found to be 0.21. On the other hand, since, ϕshort −1=ϕregmental −1+ϕglobal −1;ϕlong −1=ϕglobal −1(Eq. 4) the short correlation time can be assigned to fast segmental motions of the tyrosine residues, and the long correlation time to the global motion of the entire protein (see 50Lakowicz J.R.

The glucosyltransferase of M. luteus, which participates in the biosynthesis of teichuronic acid, was solubilized from cytoplasmic membrane fragments by extraction with buffer solutions containing the detergents Thesit (dodecyl alcohol polyoxyethylene ether; 1 mg/ml) and 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (0.5 mg/ml).

Polysaccharides located on the bacterial surface or embedded in the outer envelope, including peptidoglycan, teichoic acid, lipoteichoic acids, teichuronic acids, cell wall polysaccharides, lipopolysaccharides, and capsular polysaccharides, play an important role in the integrity of the bacterial cell. The biosynthesis of these polysaccharides requires a special group of enzymes: the glycosyltransferases, which are usually located in the cytoplasmic membrane and are capable of adding specific sugar(s) onto a polysaccharide chain. The activity of such membrane-associated enzymes was initially reported many years ago (1Osborn M.J. Rosen S.M. Rothfield L. Horecker B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1962; 48: 1831-1838Google Scholar, 2Robbins P.W. Bray D. Dankert M. Wright A. Science. 1967; 158: 1536-1542Google Scholar), but their purification has not been easy.

A. 1995; 92: 10359-10363Google Scholar), much research has been directed in recent years to identification of the genes and gene products responsible for the biosynthesis of these structures. Several relevant genes have been characterized in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (10Rubens C.E. Heggen L.M. Haft R.F. Wessels M.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 843-855Google Scholar, 11DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19181-19184Google Scholar, 12Lin W.S. Cunneen T. Lee C.Y. J.

Kuramitsu H.K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4845-4850Google Scholar). Many of the glycosyltransferase genes have been characterized through assays demonstrating the ability of the cloned gene to complement defective production of polysaccharides. However, the gene product itself is very hard to recover and analyze for enzyme activity. This difficulty may be attributable to the secondary modifications of gene products and the complexity of polysaccharide biosynthesis. In this study, through a delicate enzymological approach, we purified to near homogeneity the membrane-associated enzyme glucosyltransferase from the Gram-positive bacterium Micrococcus luteus. The teichuronic acid of the cell wall of M. luteus is a polysaccharide consisting of D-glucose and N-acetyl-D-mannosaminuronic acid (ManNAcU) 1The abbreviations used are: ManNAcUN-acetyl-D-mannosaminuronic acidCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonatePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. residues in which the repeating unit is [→4)b-D-ManNAcUp-(1→6)a-D-Glcp-(1→]n (17Hase S. Matsushima Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1972; 72: 1117-1128Google Scholar, 18Johnson S.D. Lacher K.P. Anderson J.S. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4781-4785Google Scholar). In vitro synthesis of teichuronic acid by cytoplasmic membrane fragments requires UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-ManNAcU, and UDP-D-glucose (19Page R.L. Anderson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2471-2479Google Scholar, 20Johnson G.L. Hoger J.H. Ratnayake J.H. Anderson J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 235: 679-691Google Scholar). During biosynthesis, UDP-GlcNAc is the donor of the initial residue, or so-called linker, that becomes the potential reducing terminal residue of native teichuronic acid, which is linked to peptidoglycan through a phosphodiester bond (21Hase S. Matsushima Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1977; 81: 1181-1186Google Scholar, 22Gassner G.T. Dickie J.P. Hamerski D.A. Magnuson J.K. Anderson J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2273-2279Google Scholar). However, cell wall-membrane preparations require only UDP-glucose and UDP-ManNAcU to effect elongation of teichuronic acid already present in wall fragments (Fig. 1) (23Traxler C.I. Goustin A.S. Anderson J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 150: 649-656Google Scholar). If exogenous soluble teichuronic acid is supplied as acceptor, UDP-glucose and UDP-ManNAcU are codependently required by detergent-solubilized extracts of cytoplasmic membrane fragments to effect its significant elongation (24Hildebrandt K.M. Anderson J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5160-5164Google Scholar). Transfer of glucosyl residues from UDP-glucose to teichuronic acid is catalyzed by glucosyltransferase, and the addition of N-acetylmannosaminuronic acid residues is catalyzed by the ManNAcU-transferase. The detergent Thesit (dodecyl alcohol polyoxyethylene ether) effects solubilization of the cytoplasmic membrane fragments, after which the glucosyltransferase is partially purified (25Hildebrandt K.M. Anderson J.S. Actor P. Daneo-Moore L. Higgins M.L. Salton M.R.J. Shockman G.D. Antibiotic Inhibition of Bacterial Cell Surface Assembly and Function. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1988: 151-156Google Scholar). Herein, we report the use of a combination of Thesit and another detergent, CHAPS, for the solubilization and subsequent purification of the M. luteus glucosyltransferase, which has been found to consist of four copies each of two types of subunit. N-acetyl-D-mannosaminuronic acid 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Cultures of M. luteus (ATCC 4698) were grown to mid-logarithmic phase at 30°C with vigorous shaking in a liquid medium containing peptone (10 g/liter) and NaCl (5 g/liter). The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min. The pellet of wet packed cells was washed in TMM buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.8, 0.1 mM magnesium acetate, and 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol); sedimented again; and then suspended at a concentration of 1 g/ml in 10-fold diluted TMM buffer to which lysozyme (1 mg/g of cells), DNase (3 mg/g), and RNase (30 mg/g) had been added. After incubation at 25°C for 120 min to effect lysis, the suspension was homogenized and fractionated three times by centrifugation at 4°C for 10 min. The particulate enzyme fraction was defined as the fraction sedimenting at 3,000-12,000 × g and containing cytoplasmic membrane fragments. This fraction was resuspended in TMM buffer to a final protein concentration of 5-15 mg/ml and stored at −15°C. The cytoplasmic membrane fragments were solubilized by thorough mixing of 2 volumes of buffer D, which consisted of 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 1.6 M glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.3 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml CHAPS, and 1.0 mg/ml Thesit. The insoluble residue was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min and discarded. The detergent-solubilized enzyme extract was stored at either 4 or −15°C. The detergent-solubilized enzyme samples were applied to 10-ml adsorbent columns packed with Bio-Beads SM-2 (Bio-Rad) and were eluted at room temperature with buffer D, pH 7.3, at a flow rate of 0.3-0.5 ml/min. The nonadsorbed material that passed directly through the column was collected and assayed. Fractions containing glucosyltransferase activity were pooled. Pooled fractions containing enzyme activity from the adsorbent column were applied to a column of DEAE-cellulose (4.5 × 20 cm) and eluted first with 3 bed volumes of buffer D, pH 7.3, and then with a 1000-ml linear gradient of 0.13-0.55 M NaCl in the same buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions (4.3 ± 0.2 ml) were collected and assayed for enzyme activity and protein concentration. Dilute fractions were concentrated by loading of a 2-ml volume of sample on a Centricon 10 microconcentrator or larger volumes on a Centriflo CF25 membrane cone (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, Massachusetts) and centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 1-2 h at 4°C. The material retained by the 10- and 25-kDa cutoff filters was collected. Concentrated active fractions from the DEAE-cellulose column were applied to a Bio-Gel P-300 gel-filtration column (1.5 × 50 cm). Prestained protein standards (1.4 mg; Bio-Rad) were included with the enzyme sample. The column was eluted with buffer D, pH 7.3, containing 0.1 M NaCl at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Partially purified protein samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on 3-12% (18 × 12 × 0.15 cm) or 4-15% (9 × 7 × 0.1 cm) nondenaturing gradient polyacrylamide slab gels in the absence of SDS. The former gels were purchased from Integrated Separation Systems (Natick, MA), and the latter gels were from Bio-Rad. The sample buffer was 75 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 500 mg/ml glycerol, 1 mg/ml CHAPS, 1.0 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2.5 mg/ml bromphenol blue. One volume of sample buffer was mixed with 2 volumes of protein sample. Electrophoresis was performed on 3-12% gels run for 3 h at 200 V of constant voltage in a running buffer consisting of 24.8 mM Tris and 192 mM glycine, pH 8.3, containing 0.2 mg/ml CHAPS (detergent in upper electrode buffer solution only) and 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. Electrophoresis on 4-15% gels was performed for 45 min at 200 V of constant voltage in the same running buffer. Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and glucosyltransferase activity was assayed as described below. The molecular mass of glucosyltransferase was estimated by comparison of the mobility of the enzyme's activity with that of nondenatured protein molecular mass markers on 3-12% native gradient PAGE. The relationship between molecular mass and migration of the standards was calculated by best fit logarithmic regression with the following standard proteins: jack bean urease hexamer (545 kDa), jack bean urease trimer (272 kDa), bovine serum albumin dimer (132 kDa), and bovine serum albumin monomer (66 kDa). Native gradient PAGE was also used as the final preparative step for purification of glucosyltransferase. For this procedure, 3-12% nondenaturing gradient gels (18 × 12 × 0.15 cm) in Tris/glycine buffer (in the absence of SDS) were used, and 3% stacking gel with sample wells was freshly made before the electrophoresis. A custom-made comb was used to divide the gel into two large sample wells (6 × 2 × 0.15 cm), each holding ∼1 ml or 2 mg of protein sample, and three small wells (0.7 × 2 × 0.15 cm) for the protein standards and control samples that were used to monitor the run and to localize the proteins. After electrophoresis under the standard conditions described above, the band at 4.25 ± 0.1 cm was excised with a razor blade or a gel cutter. The gel slices either were soaked in buffer D and stored at −20°C for further study or were electroeluted in the same Tris/glycine/CHAPS running buffer for 2.5 h at 10 mA of constant current/glass tube at room temperature in a Bio-Rad electroeluter. Eight such slab gels were able to separate 26 mg of protein sample after gel-filtration column chromatography. Samples from each step of purification were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Proteins were subjected to staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (10 mg/ml) or to double staining with silver/Coomassie Blue (27Dzandu J.K. Deh M.E. Barratt D.L. Wise G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1733-1737Google Scholar). To determine the molecular masses of the subunits of glucosyltransferase, the single protein band with glucosyltransferase activity that migrated onto a 7.2% or 4.25-cm nondenaturing gradient gel was excised. The excised gel slices were electroeluted as described above, mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. Molecular mass was calculated on the basis of a calibration curve prepared with the following standard proteins: myosin (200 kDa), Escherichia coli β-galactosidase (116.25 kDa), rabbit muscle phosphorylase b (97.4 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66.2 kDa), hen egg white ovalbumin (42.7 kDa), bovine carbonic anhydrase (31 kDa), and soybean trypsin inhibitor (21.5 kDa). Isoelectric focusing was performed at 10°C with Ampholine polyacrylamide gel plates (pH 3.0-9.5 and 4-6.5; Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) on an FBE-3000 flatbed apparatus (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The anode solutions were 1 M H3PO4 and 0.1 M glutamic acid in 0.5 M H3PO4 for the pH 3.0-9.5 and 4-6.5 isoelectric focusing gels, respectively; the respective cathode solutions were 1 M NaOH and 0.1 Mβ-alanine. Isoelectric focusing standards from Bio-Rad were used. The conditions used for focusing were 1,500-2,000 V, 50-55 mA, and 25-30 watts for ∼3 h, by which time the colored standards were sharply focused. The gel pH was measured immediately after completion of the run. Proteins were stained with 1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or double-stained with silver/Coomassie Blue, and glucosyltransferase activity was assayed as described below. For determination of the isoelectric point of glucosyltransferase by isoelectric precipitation, aliquots of detergent-solubilized enzyme extract were suspended in a series of buffers with pH values ranging from 4.0 to 6.5, incubated for 10 min at 25°C, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min. After the sedimented materials were quickly resuspended in buffer D, pH 8.8, glucosyltransferase activity and protein concentration were determined. The precipitation of glucosyltransferase at its isoelectric point was also used for partial purification of M. luteus glucosyltransferase. Protein composition was determined spectrophotometrically by the bicinchoninic acid method at 562 nm (28Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner R.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin served as the reference standard. Glucosyltransferase activity (24Hildebrandt K.M. Anderson J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5160-5164Google Scholar) was assessed by incubation of 50 ml of enzyme sample in a reaction mixture (final volume, 100 ml) containing 0.7 mM UDP-[14C]glucose (2 mCi/mmol), 50 mM HEPES buffer, pH 8.2, 20 mM magnesium acetate, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 30 mg/ml teichuronic acid (the glucose acceptor). After 60 min of incubation at 25°C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 20-30 ml of isobutyric acid. Residual substrate was separated from the reaction product by descending paper chromatography in isobutyric acid and 1 M NH4OH (5:3, v/v). The product remained at the origin of the chromatogram and was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. This product at the origin had previously been analyzed by mass spectrometry, NMR imaging, and carbohydrate PAGE and had been confirmed to be teichuronic acid (18Johnson S.D. Lacher K.P. Anderson J.S. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4781-4785Google Scholar, 24Hildebrandt K.M. Anderson J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5160-5164Google Scholar). Glucosyltransferase activity on native polyacrylamide gels or on isoelectric focusing gels was determined by cutting the gel into 2-mm slices with a razor blade, soaking each gel slice in 50 ml of buffer D, and incubating these gel slices in the glucosyltransferase assay reaction mixture (final volume, 100 ml) for 120 min at 25°C. A standard portion of the reaction mixture was removed for paper chromatography and subsequent determination of the amount of glucose added to the acceptor. The sensitivity of glucosyltransferase was tested by incubation of different concentrations of antibiotics (novobiocin, tunicamycin, bacitracin, and tetracycline) with the enzyme 1 h prior to the standard assay for glucosyltransferase activity. The purification of glucosyltransferase was begun with 120 g (wet weight) of M. luteus cells harvested in the mid-logarithmic phase of growth, when the enzyme's activity was maximal. A suspension of the cells in hypotonic medium was digested with lysozyme to solubilize peptidoglycan and to lyse resulting spheroplasts. The crude cell extract was treated with DNase and RNase to reduce viscosity and thereby facilitate subsequent purification procedures. These digestion steps were normally conducted at room temperature since it had previously been observed that incubation at or above 37°C caused the loss of glucosyltransferase activity. Cytoplasmic membrane fragments were recovered from the crude extract by centrifugation between 3,000 and 12,000 × g. This fraction was resuspended and recovered twice more by centrifugation. Sedimentation and washing of the membrane fragments resulted in an increase in specific activity, but only with a considerable loss of total activity, much of which remained in the supernatant solutions. SDS-PAGE of the membrane fraction showed a substantial decrease in the diversity of contaminating proteins. Since glucosyltransferase is associated with cytoplasmic membrane fragments, a significant step in its isolation and purification is its release from the membrane with a minimal loss of activity and in a form amenable to subsequent purification. Detergents are routinely used for this purpose. Although some success has accompanied the use of Thesit (24Hildebrandt K.M. Anderson J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5160-5164Google Scholar, 25Hildebrandt K.M. Anderson J.S. Actor P. Daneo-Moore L. Higgins M.L. Salton M.R.J. Shockman G.D. Antibiotic Inhibition of Bacterial Cell Surface Assembly and Function. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1988: 151-156Google Scholar), electrophoresis of samples containing substantial amounts of Thesit has been problematic. Hence, other detergents, such as CHAPS, Triton X-100, and Tween 20, were evaluated as alternatives. Of these, CHAPS was the most promising. The effect of treatment of representative crude cell fractions with a combination of Thesit and CHAPS was examined by measurement of the glucosyltransferase activity released to the supernatant fraction. Table I shows that detergent treatment approximately doubled the glucosyltransferase specific activity detected in spent culture supernatant and in a suspension of whole cells, whereas it more than tripled that released from cytoplasmic membrane fragments. Presumably, the increase in specific activity reflected the solubilization or dispersal of the cytoplasmic membrane or similar lipid-based micelles, with the concomitant solubilization or release of enzyme previously sequestered inside vesicles and thus unavailable to the assay system. In light of these observations, membrane components were solubilized by treatment with both Thesit and CHAPS. Glycerol and magnesium ion were added to stabilize the solubilized enzyme.Table I.Detergent release of M. luteus glucosyltransferase activityFraction, detergent treatmentaThe fraction was suspended in buffer lacking detergents or in buffer containing Thesit (1 mg/ml) and CHAPS (0.5 mg/ml).Protein concActivitybOne unit is equal to 1 nmol of [14C]glucose incorporated in 60 min in a standard assay.Specific activitymg/mlunits/mlunits/mgCulture supernatantNo2.138.03.76Yes1.9015.17.95Cell suspensionNo4.7824.35.08Yes5.1058.911.5Membrane fragmentsNo2.6953.219.8Yes2.31168.072.7a The fraction was suspended in buffer lacking detergents or in buffer containing Thesit (1 mg/ml) and CHAPS (0.5 mg/ml).b One unit is equal to 1 nmol of [14C]glucose incorporated in 60 min in a standard assay. Open table in a new tab Detergent-solubilized extract was passed through an adsorbent column (Bio-Beads SM-2) for the removal of nonpolar substances. Both protein and glucosyltransferase activity came directly through the column, with a slight enhancement of specific activity. The material that passed through the column was applied directly to a DEAE-cellulose column and then eluted with a gradient of NaCl (Fig. 2). About 25% of the protein and most of the carotenoids from the membrane were washed directly through the column. Several protein peaks were eluted with salt, but only those fractions that eluted at an NaCl concentration between 0.25 and 0.30 M contained glucosyltransferase. A faint yellow color was characteristic of the fractions containing the enzyme and could be used to predict which fractions would test positive for its activity. Glucosyltransferase recovered from DEAE-cellulose was concentrated and applied to a Bio-Gel P-300 column, which was eluted with buffer D supplemented with 0.1 M NaCl. Glucosyltransferase eluted in the void volume (Fig. 3). The presence of salt in the developing buffer improved the recovery of enzyme activity. It was not determined whether the enzyme bound to the gel matrix or was dissociated in the absence of salt. In contrast, attempts to use gel-filtration matrices of dextran were unsuccessful: no activity was eluted from the column, nor was any matrix-bound enzyme detected. Dextran-based matrices were eliminated from further consideration after it was determined that the addition of dextran to any preparation containing glucosyltransferase caused a loss of all activity. Glucosyltransferase recovered from the Bio-Gel P-300 column was subjected to electrophoresis on a native gradient polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 4). Enzyme activity was determined from the sample in one lane (Fig. 4, right panel), and protein composition was revealed by staining of an adjacent duplicate lane (Fig. 4, left panel, lane 2). Although several protein bands (migrating from 3 to 10.5 cm) were detected by native gradient PAGE, only the band migrating at 4.25 cm displayed glucosyltransferase activity. A duplicate gel lane containing glucosyltransferase was incubated with UDP-[14C]Glc in situ. Incubation was followed by exhaustive washing of the gel to remove unbound substrate. An autoradiogram of this gel displayed only one band, whose location corresponded to that of glucosyltransferase activity (data not shown). These results provide evidence that all other protein bands (∼90% in mass) detected by native PAGE were either contaminants or the dissociated subunits of glucosyltransferase that were no longer active. Therefore, in a further study, native gradient PAGE was used as the final preparative step for purification of glucosyltransferase. The protein in the single band migrating at 4.25 cm was isolated either by excision or by electroelution and was analyzed as purified glucosyltransferase. Results of the purification steps described above are summarized in Table II. The purification resulted in a 150-fold increase in specific activity, with an overall yield of 13%. Electroelution is a powerful method for solubilizing purified protein and for providing sample for further analysis of the subunits of glucosyltransferase; however, prolonged electroelution caused a partial (30-70%) loss of the specific activity of glucosyltransferase (see “Discussion”). In contrast, the enzyme remaining in the excised gel slices from native PAGE without Coomassie Blue staining was relatively stable in buffer D at −20°C. Those samples were later used for enzymological studies of glucosyltransferase.Table II.Purification of the glucosyltransferase of M. luteusPurification stepTotal proteinTotal activityaOne unit is equal to 1 nmol of [14C]glucose incorporated in 60 min in a standard assay.YieldSpecific activityPurificationmgunits%units/mg-foldLysozyme digestion3,00019,8001006.61.0Membrane fraction57010,80055192.9Detergent extraction16211,200576910Adsorbent column16012,800658012DEAE-cellulose column798,9804511517Gel-filtration column (P-300)267,7103929545Protein band isolated at 4.25 cm on 12-cm native gradient PAGE2.62,53013970150a One unit is equal to 1 nmol of [14C]glucose incorporated in 60 min in a standard assay. Open table in a new tab In our early attempt to purify glucosyltransferase, the active samples obtained by adsorbent column and DEAE-cellulose column chromatography were isoelectrically precipitated at pH 5.0 by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4°C. The sedimented materials were resuspended in buffer D, pH 8.8, and centrifuged again to remove the insoluble precipitates. By this method, the specific activity of glucosyltransferase in the supernatant was significantly increased. The purification resulted in a >2-fold increase in specific activity (∼250 units/mg). Significantly fewer protein bands were obtained by SDS-PAGE compared with the previously used purification process (DEAE-cellulose column chromatography) (Fig. 5). SDS-PAGE also yielded two major bands (54 and 52.5 kDa), with many minor protein bands in the background indicative of only partial purification (Fig. 5, lane 5). Two problems were later found with regard to this purification step. First, purification resulted in low yield (20%), with more than half of glucosyltransferase irreversibly denatured. The solubilized fraction in the supernatant contained some protein aggregates that interfered with further purification. Second, similar problems arose when isoelectric focusing PAGE was used as the purification method. Since isoelectric precipitation is not practical for the final purification of glucosyltransferase, we eliminated this step in our later purification effort. In the native gradient PAGE shown in Fig. 4, glucosyltransferase activity was found in a band that migrated at 4.25 cm, only slightly faster than the molecular mass standard jack bean urease hexamer (545 kDa). A plot of distance migrated versus log molecular mass was constructed by computer. The curve in the plot is the best fit log regression line based on the migration of the molecular mass markers. According to the location of the band with enzyme activity, the molecular mass of glucosyltransferase was estimated to be 440 kDa. The protein band displaying glucosyltransferase activity was recovered from a duplicate native gradient gel and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Silver staining revealed two major bands, presumably subunits of glucosyltransferase (Fig. 6). The two bands took on a purplish brown color after double staining, a result suggesting the presence of a small amount of carbohydrate or lipid. The approximate molecular masses for these bands (52.5 and 54 kDa) were determined from another plot on the basis of molecular mass standards. (Faint minor bands with mobilities corresponding to 23, 58, 70, and 75 kDa were occasionally observed; however, their quantity was insignificant.) The results of SDS-PAGE of partially purified glucosyltransferase fractions are shown in Fig. 5. Although many minor bands can be detected in the last fraction (lane 5), it is obvious that the 54- and 52.5-kDa bands have changed from minor bands to major bands as a result of the purification process. These results prove that the increase in the specific activity of glucosyltransferase during purification is associated with the increase in the intensity of the bands of 52.5 and 54 kDa (Fig. 5). In addition, we observed that the running condition of native gradient PAGE is critical. When the partially purified glucosyltransferase was exposed to prolonged electrophoresis, a waving band, which is an aggregate of dissociated glucosyltransferase components with similar 54- and 52.5-kDa subunits, was observed below the 4.25-cm glucosyltransferase band in native PAGE. It seems that the longer the period of electrophoresis, the farther the waving band migrated. Glucosyltransferase was stable for 3-6 months when stored at −15°C in buffer containing 2 M glycerol, 20 mM magnesium acetate, 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.1-3% Thesit and CHAPS. However, repeated freezing (to −15°C) and thawing caused a gradual loss of activity. Activity was enhanced by 30% after 24 h of incubation at 25°C. However, at higher temperatures, the enzyme was susceptible to inactivation. Incubation at 37°C for 5 and 24 h resulted in the loss of 70 and 90% of the enzyme's activity, respectively. Glucosyltransferase was stable when the pH of the above solution was maintained between 5.5 and 9.0 at 4°C, but at its isoelectric point, it underwent inactivation. The isoelectric point of the purified glucosyltransferase, as determined by isoelectric focusing on polyacrylamide gels, was between 4.5 and 4.9. Isoelectric precipitation of the enzyme yielded a pI value of 5.0 (Fig. 7). The diminished recovery of glucosyltransferase in the middle of the isoelectric precipitation plot is an indication of rapid loss of activity at the isoelectric point. The enzymatic reaction followed simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The apparent Km value of glucosyltransferase for its substrate, UDP-Glc, is ∼300 μM. Purified glucosyltransferase was assayed for its sensitivity to inhibition by several antibiotics (novobiocin, tunicamycin, bacitracin, and tetracycline) at different concentrations. Of the antibiotics tested, only novobiocin substantially inhibited the enzyme. Specifically, 10 μM inhibited ∼60% of glucosyltransferase activity, while a relatively high concentration of novobiocin (100 μM) was required for nearly complete inhibition. In contrast, 100 μM tunicamycin inhibited glucosyltransferase activity by only 50%, and bacitracin and tetracycline had no inhibitory effect. The glucosyltransferase of M. luteus is one of a pair of enzymes that act together to effect the synthesis of teichuronic acid, in which the alternating residues of the polymer are glucose and ManNAcU (Fig. 1) (23Traxler C.I. Goustin A.S. Anderson J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 150: 649-656Google Scholar, 24Hildebrandt K.M. Anderson J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5160-5164Google Scholar, 29Stark N.J. Levy G.N. Rohr T.E. Anderson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3466-3472Google Scholar). Glucosyltransferase catalyzes the transfer of a glucosyl residue from UDP-glucose to an acceptor teichuronic acid that has a nonreducing terminal ManNAcU residue. The other enzyme, ManNAcU-transferase, catalyzes the addition of a ManNAcU residue from UDP-ManNAcU to an acceptor teichuronic acid that has a nonreducing terminal glucose residue (the product of the glucosyltransferase reaction). As part of our ongoing investigation of teichuronic acid synthesis (20Johnson G.L. Hoger J.H. Ratnayake J.H. Anderson J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 235: 679-691Google Scholar, 24Hildebrandt K.M. Anderson J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5160-5164Google Scholar), we sought to purify these enzymes so that we could study the mechanism of bacterial polysaccharide biosynthesis and examine why D-glucosyl residues are incorporated as α-glycosides, whereas D-ManNAcU residues are incorporated as the β-anomer (18Johnson S.D. Lacher K.P. Anderson J.S. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4781-4785Google Scholar). We chose to purify glucosyltransferase first since UDP-[14C]glucose is more readily available than UDP-[14C]ManNAcU. Knowledge gained from the solubilization and purification of glucosyltransferase should be applicable to the purification of ManNAcU-transferase. The purified enzymes should prove useful in generating antibodies for studies of the enzymes' cellular localization. Enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of bacterial cell wall polymers have been detected mainly in cytoplasmic membrane fragments. Indeed, all prior investigations of teichuronic acid biosynthesis had made use of either cytoplasmic membrane fragments (also termed the particulate enzyme fraction) (19Page R.L. Anderson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2471-2479Google Scholar, 29Stark N.J. Levy G.N. Rohr T.E. Anderson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3466-3472Google Scholar) or a wall-plus-membrane complex (23Traxler C.I. Goustin A.S. Anderson J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 150: 649-656Google Scholar, 30Weston A. Perkins H.R. FEBS Lett. 1977; 76: 195-198Google Scholar). Thus, the first major step toward purification of glucosyltransferase was the solubilization of protein components of the membrane fragments. Several detergents were tested for their ability to solubilize membranes while maintaining the activity of the glucosyltransferase. Thesit proved to be suitable for solubilization (24Hildebrandt K.M. Anderson J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5160-5164Google Scholar, 25Hildebrandt K.M. Anderson J.S. Actor P. Daneo-Moore L. Higgins M.L. Salton M.R.J. Shockman G.D. Antibiotic Inhibition of Bacterial Cell Surface Assembly and Function. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1988: 151-156Google Scholar), but later was found to interfere with subsequent purification steps as well as with PAGE analysis. For example, Thesit-solubilized enzyme fractions contain many other membrane proteins, such as ATPase (31Huberman M. Salton M.R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 547: 230-240Google Scholar), and membrane lipids, in particular, the typical membrane pigments of M. luteus, carotenoids (32Rothblat G.H. Ellis D.S. Kritchevski D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 84: 340-347Google Scholar). Thesit did not fully solubilize the enzyme from the pieces of membrane fragment. CHAPS is a suitable detergent for solubilization, but is quite expensive. Because of the adverse effects of one and the cost of the other, the use of these two detergents in combination appeared to be superior to the use of either by itself. The purification of glucosyltransferase was monitored routinely by nondenaturing PAGE and SDS-PAGE. Samples always displayed several protein bands, suggesting the presence of substantial amounts of contaminant protein. Furthermore, the use of numerous purification steps in various combinations consistently failed to increase the level of specific activity above 1000 units/mg. It is now apparent that glucosyltransferase is a multisubunit enzyme whose disaggregation upon prolonged electrophoresis or electroelution on polyacrylamide gel permits the detection of subunits. This finding is consistent with the observation that glucosyltransferase elutes in the exclusion volume of a Bio-Gel P-300 column (Fig. 3) and has a mobility in native gradient PAGE that is in line with a molecular mass of 440 kDa (Fig. 4). This interpretation was verified by elution of the glucosyltransferase band from native gradient PAGE and by the result of subsequent analysis by SDS-PAGE, in which the usual pattern of protein bands was generated. The bands at 52.5 and 54 kDa are always predominant and of equal intensity. The stoichiometry of the subunits has not been accurately determined; however, if the 54- and 52.5-kDa subunits are considered to be present with a stoichiometry of four copies each per aggregate, then the masses of the subunits add up to 426 kDa, a figure in reasonable agreement with the observed mass of 440 kDa for the aggregate. Glucosyltransferase strictly requires four pairs of subunits to maintain catalytic function. Since glucosyltransferase is a multisubunit protein, it is easy to understand why early attempts to purify a conventional-sized protein (≤200 kDa) led to a loss of enzyme activity. Furthermore, the glucosyltransferase subunits did not display the well defined mobilities and staining properties associated with many standard proteins. This difference may be a consequence of hydrophobicity or of special modifications of this membrane-derived protein or may be due to an unknown factor. Reviewing the purification processes, we found that the most critical step in the final purification of this “fragile” membrane enzyme was the application of native gradient PAGE. Like SDS-PAGE, this procedure separates native proteins according to their molecular sizes; unlike SDS-PAGE, it causes no enzyme denaturations. The availability of a commercial gradient gel made this purification possible. The advantages offered by such gels are that they are easy to use and the reproducibility of results obtained with them (especially for migration distance) and the multiple subsequent uses of the purified protein band for enzyme assays, subunit analysis, and preparative purifications. The disadvantage of this method is the difficulty of scaling up purification. The glucosyltransferase of M. luteus differs substantially from other glycosyltransferases that have been described. Unlike the glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of cell envelope polysaccharides of other bacteria, the glucosyltransferase of M. luteus is capable of elongating the teichuronic acid polysaccharide chain without a lipid carrier (such as glycosylpolyisoprenyl phosphate) as the glycosyl donor. The glucosyltransferases involved in the synthesis of membrane-derived oligosaccharides of E. coli (33Weissborn A.C. Rumley M.K. Kennedy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8062-8067Google Scholar) and the cyclic glucans of Bradyrhizobium japonicum (34Cohen J.L. Miller K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4271-4276Google Scholar) both use UDP-glucose as a glucosyl donor. However, membrane-derived oligosaccharide synthesis also requires both polyisoprenyl phosphate (33Weissborn A.C. Rumley M.K. Kennedy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8062-8067Google Scholar) and acyl carrier protein (35Therisod H. Weissborn A.C. Kennedy E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7236-7240Google Scholar). Several other properties of the M. luteus glucosyltransferase were also characterized in this study, such as its thermostability, its isoelectric point, its Km, and its sensitivity to antibiotics. Further studies involving molecular cloning as well as structural and functional characterization will help to elucidate the catalytic mechanism of this molecule and will eventually establish the precise relationship between the two enzymes (glucosyltransferase and ManNAcU-transferase) that are responsible for the synthesis of the entire cell wall polymer teichuronic acid. We are grateful to Julie McCoy, Kim M. Hildebrandt, Dr. Victoria Sandberg, Xiaoyang Liu, and Drs. Michael R. Wessels and Gerald B. Pier for expert advice and assistance with this project."

This reaction is unique among all known nucleoside triphosphatases, which form ortho and/or pyrophosphate as end products. Seto et al. (2Seto D. Bhatnagar S.K. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1494-1499Google Scholar) some 29 years later, purified the Escherichia coli protein to homogeneity and showed that it is specific for dGTP, and none of the other canonical (deoxy)nucleoside triphosphates in E. coli are significantly hydrolyzed. To date, dGTPase is the only known triphosphohydrolase. Seto et al. (2Seto D. Bhatnagar S.K. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1494-1499Google Scholar) demonstrated that dGTPase was overproduced by approximately 20-30-fold in a mutant strain of E. coli previously described by Saito and Richardson (3Saito H. Richardson C.C. J. Virol. 1981; 37: 343-351Google Scholar). This observation was also made by Beauchamp and Richardson (4Beauchamp B.B. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2563-2567Google Scholar) who purified the enzyme from these bacteria and showed that it was identical to the dGTPase originally characterized. Huber et al. (5Huber H.E. Beauchamp B.B. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13549-13556Google Scholar) and Nakai and Richardson (6Nakai H. Richardson CC. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4411-4419Google Scholar) demonstrated that bacteriophage T7 produce a specific dGTPase inhibitor protein. The structural gene encoding E. coli dGTPase (dgt) was first isolated by Quirk et al. (7Quirk S. Seto D. Bhatnagar S.K. Gauss P. Gold L. Bessman M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 1391-1395Google Scholar), and the sequence of the E. coli dgt gene was reported by Wurgler and Richardson (8Wurgler S.M. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2740-2744Google Scholar) and Quirk et al. (9Quirk S. Bhatnagar S.K. Bessman M.J. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 89: 13-18Google Scholar). The dGTPase enzyme is specific to the bacterial family Enterobacteriaceae and is expressed in all genera of the family with the exception of Erwinia species (10Quirk S. Bessman M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6665-6669Google Scholar). Wurgler and Richardson (11Wurgler S.M. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20046-20054Google Scholar) were the first to demonstrate that dGTPase binds ssDNA in a cooperative manner at physiological salt concentrations. The significance of these observations is unknown. We are interested in understanding the enzyme family from an evolutionary perspective and have embarked on a project to clone and study all of the enteric dgt homologues. Comparative enzymological work has been frustrated in part by the difficulty in producing homogeneous dGTPase from native or recombinant sources. To aid in our continuing work on the Enterobacteriaceae dGTPases, we report a rapid, streamlined, and automated purification protocol. This purification scheme is employed to isolate homogeneous and active recombinant dGTPase from a second member of the Enterobacteriaceae, Shigella boydii. This material has been utilized in a variety of biochemical and biophysical experiments to further the understanding of this novel family of enzymes. Preparation of plasmid DNA, restriction enzyme digests, ligation, and agarose gel electrophoresis were performed according to Maniatis et al. (12Maniatis T. Fritsch S.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) or Sambrook et al. (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Bacterial transformation was as described by Morrison (14Morrison D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 68: 326-331Google Scholar). Protein SDS-PAGE gels were made, run, and processed as per Laemmli (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined according to the method of Bradford (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Chemical reagents were from Sigma, except for deoxynucleoside triphosphates which were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. S. boydii was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC 9207). Vent DNA polymerase used in all PCR reactions was purchased from New England Biolabs and used with the supplied buffer. The procedure measures the hydrolysis of [α-32P]dGTP to Norit nonadsorbable 32P and is performed as described by Seto et al. (2Seto D. Bhatnagar S.K. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1494-1499Google Scholar). In order to measure the rate of hydrolysis of nonradioactive substrates, a colorimetric assay was performed in conjunction with an assay of orthophosphate (Pi) according to 17Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Google Scholar after hydrolyzing reaction products in 0.5 N HCl for 15 min in a boiling water bath. Genomic DNA was isolated from an overnight culture of S. boydii using the Genomic DNA Prep kit from Bio101, Inc. The Shigella dgt gene was amplified from this genomic DNA template using degenerate PCR oligonucleotide primers based upon the amino acid sequence of Escherichia dGTPase. Oligonucleotide A had the sequence 5′-ATGGCNCA(A/G)ATNGA(T/C)TT(T/C)(C/A)GNA and oligonucleotide B had the sequence 5′-A(T/C)TG(T/C)NACNGCCATNA(A/G)NC, where N is an equimolar mixture of all four bases. The PCR product was concentrated by ethanol precipitation and cloned into SmaI-digested, dephosphorylated pUC18. The ligated material was used to transform competent HB101 bacteria. Recombinant colonies were screened for the presence of full-length inserts by miniprep analysis and restriction digestion coupled with agarose gel electrophoresis analysis of digestion products. The plasmid constructs were designated pSdgt1,2. Double-stranded DNA sequencing was performed by the dideoxy termination method (18Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar) using Sequenase version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Additional DNA sequencing was performed using the Applied Biosystems, Inc. model 373A automatic DNA Sequencer. The separate isolates were fully sequenced in order to check for PCR-induced errors. The expression plasmid pSdgtE was created using PCR-directed mutagenesis of pSdgt. A unique NcoI site was introduced at the initiation ATG codon using the oligonucleotide 5′-CTCGCCCAATGGCACAGATTGATTTCCGA-3′. Similarly, a unique BamHI site was introduced at the 3′ end of the coding sequence immediately downstream from the TAA termination codon using the oligonucleotide 5′-TCGTACGGATCCTTATTGTTCTACGGCCATCA-3′. The final PCR product was ethanol-precipitated, digested with NcoI and BamHI, and ligated into the expression vector pET11d (Novagen, Inc.) which had been digested with NcoI, BamHI and dephosphorylated. The sequence of the expression construct was verified by DNA sequencing. Plasmid pSdgtE containing BL21(DE3)-pLysS cells were grown at 37°C in Luria broth supplemented with 60 μg/ml ampicilin from a 1% inoculum. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mM when the cells had reached an A595 value of 0.8 (in approximately 3 h postinoculation). Cell growth continued for 5 additional hours before harvesting. Typically, 3 g of cells were obtained per liter. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 1 volume of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The cells were respun as above and resuspended in 2 volumes of 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium azide (Buffer I). The cells were disrupted by sonication on ice using a Branson sonicator equipped with a microtip. The extract was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was designated as Fraction I. All subsequent chromatography steps were performed using a Bio-Rad Econo System in automatic peak detection/sample loading mode. The purification protocol is designed so that the pooled fraction from one step can be automatically loaded onto the next column. During the pilot runs, enzyme assays were performed on each fraction in order to determine where active dGTPase was eluting, followed by SDS-PAGE analysis. Column chromatograms were so reproducible that automated peak pooling could be employed during production runs. This effectively saved the time required to perform enzyme assays on individual fractions and visualization of individual fractions by SDS-PAGE. Fraction I was applied to a 4.9 cm2× 20 cm column of DEAE-Sepharose (Sigma) in Buffer I. The enzyme was eluted from the column with a linear gradient of 0 to 0.5 M KCl at a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min. The major peak containing dGTPase activity eluted as a broad peak centered at 0.3 M KCl. The central 90% of the absorbance was automatically pooled and constituted Fraction II. Fraction II was immediately applied to a 1.8 cm2× 10 cm single-stranded DNA-cellulose column (Sigma) in Buffer I, 300 mM KCl. The column was washed with 120 ml of the Buffer I, followed by a linear 50-ml KCl gradient from 2.0 M to 4.0 M KCl. The flow rate throughout this elution was 2.0 ml/min. The enzyme eluted from the column halfway through the gradient. The central 95% of the eluting material was automatically pooled and was designated as Fraction III. Homogeneous Shigella dGTPase was prepared from Fraction III via hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Ammonium sulfate (from a 4 M stock solution) was added to the Fraction III pool to a final concentration of 1.0 M. This material was applied to a Bio-Rad Econo-Pac t-butyl hydrophobic interaction chromatography cartridge column (1 ml total column volume). A 100-ml reverse concave gradient from 1.0 M (NH4)2SO4, 3.0 M KCl, Buffer I to Buffer I alone was applied directly after loading the sample. Homogeneous dGTPase eluted from the column during the last third of the gradient. The central 95% of the peak (as measured by absorbance) was automatically pooled. The material was concentrated to a final volume of 2 ml by pressure filtration through a semipermeable membrane (Amicon YM-3) and dialyzed versus 2 liters of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The concentrated/dialyzed material constituted Fraction IV. All studies were performed with homogeneous (Fraction IV) dGTPase. Stability measurements of reduced and oxidized dGTPase were performed by measuring protein unfolding in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) via intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence in a SPEX Fluorolog fluorimeter. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 295 nm and 340 nm, respectively. Both excitation and emission monochrometer slits were set at 5 nm. Protein (10 μM) was reduced with dithiothreitol (DTT) for 2 h, GdnHCl was then added to individual samples in the final concentration range from 0 to 1.5 M, and the samples were incubated at room temperature for 10 h to ensure that unfolding equilibrium had been achieved. Relative fluorescence was converted into free energy values as described previously (19Pace C.N. Shirley B.A. Thomson J.A. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1989: 311-330Google Scholar). The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of Shigella dGTPase indicate a 1515-base pair open reading frame that corresponds to a protein of 505 amino acid residues, with a calculated molecular mass of 59.4 kDa. The Shigella dgt gene sequence differs from the Escherichia homologue in 13 positions. Seven of the base changes occur in the third codon position, and the remaining six nucleotide changes are evenly distributed between first and second codon positions. These nucleotide substitutions give rise to only six amino acid differences between the Escherichia and Shigella enzymes (98.8% identity). Most of the amino acid differences are conservative substitutions. Codon usage is typical of other Shigella genes. The nucleotide sequence has been reported to GenBank™ and assigned accession number U42434. The Shigella dgt open reading frame was subcloned into the protein expression vector pET11d (Novagen, Inc.) using PCR primers that incorporated a 5′-NcoI site and a 3′-BamHI site in order to facilitate in frame directional cloning. Bacteria transformed with the expression construct pSdgtE synthesize high levels of soluble dGTPase. The specific activity of crude protein extracts prepared from BL21(DE3)pLysS bacteria harboring pSdgtE indicates that the material is overproduced 210-fold compared with the native expression level as shown in Table I. DEAE-Sepharose chromatography increases the specific activity of the protein preparation 5.6-fold, but primarily serves to remove the ssDNA that remains associated with the enzyme in crude extract. 2M. J. Bessman, personal communication. This material is then applied to a ssDNA-cellulose column in an affinity purification step that results in nearly homogeneous dGTPase. The final purification step on a t-butyl hydrophobic interaction chromatography column efficiently removes the last few remaining contaminant bands. The resulting homogeneous enzyme preparation represents a 232-fold purification from the crude bacterial extract with a 52% recovery. Overproduction of dGTPase, coupled with this purification protocol yields 6.4 mg of protein per 25 g of cell paste. Edman degradation of the N-terminal region of the enzyme (data not shown) confirms the identity of the overexpressed material as bona fide dGTPase and reveals that the initiating methionine residue is removed by E. coli as a post translational modification. The entire purification scheme (from the preparation of the crude extract to homogeneous enzyme) takes approximately 8 h to complete.Table I.Purification of recombinant Shigella boydii dGTP triphosphohydrolaseFractionTotal unitsaOne unit of dGTPase produces 1 μmol of PPPi in 20 min at 37°C.ProteinSpecific activityRecoveryPurificationunits × 103mg/mlunits/mg × 103%n-foldI.

Open table in a new tab The reaction conditions for optimal dGTPase activity are similar to the E. coli protein (2Seto D. Bhatnagar S.K. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1494-1499Google Scholar, 4Beauchamp B.B. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2563-2567Google Scholar, 10Quirk S. Bessman M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6665-6669Google Scholar). The enzyme has a broad pH optimum profile that is centered at a pH value of 8.2, and activity is absolutely dependent on the presence of the divalent cation magnesium. Like its E. coli counterpart, the Shigella enzyme is not active when other divalent cations are substituted for Mg2+. Shigella dGTPase has Km of 10 μM (Vmax 1.5 μmol min−1 mg−1) for dGTP and a Km of 120 μM for GTP (Vmax 0.06 μmol min−1 mg−1). Analytical gel filtration experiments (20Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Google Scholar) indicate that purified dGTPase is a tetramer with a 52.8-Å Stokes radius and a frictional coefficient of 1.12 (all data not shown). Substrate specificity was determined for the enzyme by measuring the ability of dGTPase to hydrolyze several other deoxynucleoside triphosphates. Fig. 1 indicates that of the four canonical dNTPs, only dGTP is hydrolyzed to a significant extent (and arbitrarily set to 100% activity), dTTP shows a 20% hydrolysis rate relative to dGTP, and neither dATP nor dCTP is hydrolyzed. In order to expand the understanding of how dGTPase discriminates between substrate and nonsubstrate, two additional molecules were assayed. Both dITP and dUTP are hydrolyzed by dGTPase at 40% and 25% of the dGTP rate, respectively. Shigella dGTPase is sensitive to the action of reducing agents. Dithiothreitol preincubated with 0.4 μM dGTPase results in a concentration-dependent loss of enzymatic activity (Fig. 2). This loss of activity occurs at molar ratios ranging from 100:1 to 2500:1 (DTT to dGTPase). The addition of substrate to the preincubation mixture does not prevent the loss of enzymatic activity (data not shown). In addition, a time course experiment was undertaken that shows that the reduction rate at a DTT concentration of 300 μM is time-dependent, as one would expect for the reduction of disulfide bonds (Fig. 3). This experiment also indicates that the loss of enzymatic activity is due to the phenomenon of disulfide reduction and not a general effect of DTT interfering with the assay. Fig. 3 shows that enzymatic activity decays with respect to time following pseudo-first order kinetics with a rate constant of 3.3 × 10−4 s−1 producing a half-life of 35 min. There is a residual 12% of total activity remaining after 120 min of preincubation in the presence of the reductant. Reduction of dGTPase with 2-mercaptoethanol resulted in similar loss of activity kinetics (data not shown). An oxidized enzyme control (Fig. 3) indicates that native dGTPase is active over the time course of the assay.Fig. 3The loss of enzyme activity at a fixed concentration of DTT is time-dependent. Enzyme at 0.4 μM is reacted with 300 μM DTT at room temperature. Aliquots are removed at the times indicated, diluted into the linear enzyme assay range with 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and assayed for enzyme activity. Closed circles represent the reduced enzyme time aliquots, open circles are for the oxidized dGTPase control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Oxidized Shigella dGTPase remains fully enzymatically active at 60°C for extended incubation periods (Fig. 4). This thermostability is not evidenced in reduced dGTPase. To measure the thermostability of reduced dGTPase, the enzyme (0.4 μM) is incubated with 300 μM DTT to a 60% activity level relative to the oxidized protein (incubation time is 10 min). The reduced protein is then diluted with 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) to a final concentration of 0.04 μM prior to a time course incubation at 60°C and subsequent enzyme assay. Fig. 4 indicates that the reduced protein becomes thermolabile. Reduced dGTPase shows a loss of enzymatic activity with respect to time following pseudo-first order kinetics with a rate constant of 6.3 × 10−4 s−1, producing a half-life of 18 min. There is a residual 5% activity remaining after 40 min of incubation at 60°C. Reduction of dGTPase results in the irreversible loss of enzymatic activity (Fig. 4), most probably due to improper reformation of disulfide bonds (disulfide mixing). The unfolding course of oxidized and fully reduced dGTPase at a concentration of 12 μM was followed by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence as shown in Fig. 5. Analysis of the unfolding curves indicates that oxidized dGTPase has a native free energy, ΔGH2O, of 3.7 kcal/mol, and shows a midpoint in the unfolding reaction ([GdnHCl]1/2) of 0.95 M GdnHCl. Reduced dGTPase is significantly less stable than the oxidized protein (Fig. 5) as evidenced by a ΔGH2O value of 1.9 kcal/mol, and a [GdnHCl]1/2 value of 0.65 M GdnHCl. This results in a free energy difference (ΔΔG) between oxidized and reduced dGTPase of 1.8 kcal/mol. Initial crystallization conditions were screened by the vapor diffusion method (21Ducruix A. Giege R. Ducruix A. Giege R. Crystallization of Nucleic Acids and Proteins: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1992: 82-90Google Scholar) using the sparse matrix sampling techniques (22Jancarik J. Kim S.-H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 409-411Google Scholar) with 5 μl of the concentrated and dialyzed protein equilibrated against an equal volume of the reservoir solution. Rectangular, plate-like crystals formed in 5-10 days at room temperature from a reservoir solution containing 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) and sodium chloride in sodium acetate buffer. In order to optimize crystal growth, wide ranging titrations of MPD, sodium chloride, and sodium acetate concentration were undertaken. Crystals were reproducibly obtained from a reservoir containing 30% MPD, 150 mM sodium chloride, 200 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.0). Protein crystals obtained typical dimensions of 1.0 × 0.1 × 0.02 mm as shown in Fig. 6. These crystals diffract to only 4.5 Å resolution (data not shown). Trials to improve crystal quality are in progress. The Shigella and Escherichia dGTPase enzymes are highly conserved. This is to be expected, since the two genera are the most closely related of all the Enterobacteriaceae. An analysis of the dgt gene from a second species within the genus Escherichia, namely E. fergusonii (ATCC 35469), reveals that there are only two nucleotide substitutions (T381→ G and G918→ C; both at the third codon position). This gives rise to only one amino acid substitution (Phe137→ Leu), indicating a high level of intergenus sequence conservation (data not shown, but submitted to GenBank™ with the accession number U42435). Both homologues contain the previously described dGTPase amino acid consensus structures (8Wurgler S.M. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2740-2744Google Scholar, 9Quirk S. Bhatnagar S.K. Bessman M.J. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 89: 13-18Google Scholar, 10Quirk S. Bessman M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6665-6669Google Scholar). So, generally speaking, the accepted taxonomy of enteric bacteria (23Ochman H. Wilson A.C. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 1649-1654Google Scholar) is reflected in the divergence of dGTPase sequences. We are in the process of cloning dgt homologues from more distantly related Enterobacteriaceae genera. We hope to learn more about the nature of the dGTPase proteins by an extensive analysis of sequence divergence. The expression construct pSdgtE, produces a significant amount of Shigella dGTPase that is readily identified in crude bacterial extracts. The enzyme purification scheme outlined in this paper produces homogeneous material in 1 day. This represents a significant improvement over traditional purification methods (2Seto D. Bhatnagar S.K. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1494-1499Google Scholar, 4Beauchamp B.B. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2563-2567Google Scholar). This overproduction level, as measured by the specific activity of induced crude protein extract, is directly comparable to the construct that overproduces E. coli dGTPase that was described by Wurgler and Richardson (11Wurgler S.M. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20046-20054Google Scholar). Both specific activity measurements probably represent the maximum amount of dGTPase that can be overproduced in a T7 polymerase-based expression system without deleterious effects to the host bacterium (meaning the overproduced dGTPase completely hydrolyzes the cellular dGTP pool). The choice of bacterial host strain was also important to the success of the expression scheme. BL21(DE3) cells produced lower amounts of dGTPase than did BL21(DE3)-pLysS when transformed with pSdgtE. This is presumably due to the tighter repression of T7 RNA polymerase afforded by pLysS strains prior to induction. The key to the success of this purification protocol lies with the chromatographic reproducibility afforded by the Bio-Rad Econo System. This reproducibility permits automatic peak pooling, which in turn cuts down on the time needed to assay individual fractions for dGTPase. The chromatographic regime is also designed to permit direct pool loading onto the next column, thus avoiding dialysis buffer changes. The overexpression level, coupled with the purification protocol, produces more purified dGTPase in 1 day, than was produced in 1.5 weeks using other purification schemes (2Seto D. Bhatnagar S.K. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1494-1499Google Scholar, 4Beauchamp B.B. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2563-2567Google Scholar, 8Wurgler S.M. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2740-2744Google Scholar, 9Quirk S. Bhatnagar S.K. Bessman M.J. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 89: 13-18Google Scholar, 10Quirk S. Bessman M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6665-6669Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of dGTPase can be directly correlated to a pattern of Watson-Crick type hydrogen bonding surfaces that display the arrangement of hydrogen bond acceptor (6-position carbonyl of the purine ring), hydrogen bond donor (1-position H of the purine ring), and hydrogen bond donor (2-position amino group of the purine ring). This work indicates that the most important group of the three for determining activity is the 6-position carbonyl group. Substitution of that group with a potential hydrogen bond donor (a 6-position exocyclic amino group), as in dATP, abolishes activity. No enzymatic activity is measured on dCTP for the same reason. In addition, the substitution of the 2-position exocyclic amino group (as in dGTP) with a carbonyl (as in dCTP) changes the polarity of potential H bond interactions. Hence, dCTP has no potential interactions that are analogous to those in dGTP. The pyrimidines dUTP and dTTP show similar activities when assayed as substrates. Activity is not totally abolished, however, because the 6-position carbonyl and the 1- position H are still in place helping to lock the molecule in the active site. This also indicates that the nature of the substituent at the 2-position is not a paramount determinant for dGTPase specificity. Although simple elimination of the 2-position exocyclic amino group as in dITP results in a 60% loss of activity. Substrate discrimination based on the array of hydrogen bonding groups of the purine base is unique and is not duplicated in any studied nucleotide metabolizing enzyme (for a review see 24Schulz G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 61-67Google Scholar). This unusual specificity may be a clue to the function of the enzyme, provides the first insight into the dGTPase active site, and provides a logical rationale for the choice of other substrates/substrate analogs for further study. In order to determine whether or not any of the 24 cysteine residues found in the dGTPase tetramer are involved in disulfide bridges, and whether or not such disulfide bonds are important to the enzymatic activity and stability of the protein, a series of reduction experiments was undertaken. The exact number and location of disulfide bonds in Shigella dGTPase is being investigated, yet clearly disulfide bonds are an integral component to the stability and biological activity of dGTPase. It has been shown that dGTPase is not essential for bacterial viability (7Quirk S. Seto D. Bhatnagar S.K. Gauss P. Gold L. Bessman M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 1391-1395Google Scholar, 8Wurgler S.M. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2740-2744Google Scholar, 9Quirk S. Bhatnagar S.K. Bessman M.J. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 89: 13-18Google Scholar) under laboratory conditions, but the physiological role of the enzyme may only be manifested in less controlled environments. It may also be possible that dGTPase is required during anaerobic growth, during enteropathogenesis, or in conjunction with secondary nucleotide biosynthetic mutations. We are endeavoring to elucidate the physiological role of this enzyme in addition to biophysical and evolutionary characterization. So it is hoped that by approaching the study of dGTPase study from many scientific disciplines the role of this enigmatic protein will ultimately yield to scrutiny. Certainly a streamlined purification protocol, an explanation of substrate specificity rules, and an analysis of protein behavior in reducing environments is a step in that direction. We thank Dr. M. J. Bessman of the Johns Hopkins University for the gift of bacterial strains and purification advice. Anne Handley and Scott Chasse are thanked for critical reading of the manuscript, and Dr. John Haseltine is appreciated for his thoughtful discussions of phosphoester hydrolysis."
