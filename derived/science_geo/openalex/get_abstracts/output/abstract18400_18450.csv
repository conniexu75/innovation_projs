https://openalex.org/W1998276013,"Single DNA molecules were chemically attached by one end to a glass surface and by their other end to a magnetic bead. Equilibrium positions of the beads were observed in an optical microscope while the beads were acted on by known magnetic and hydrodynamic forces. Extension versus force curves were obtained for individual DNA molecules at three different salt concentrations with forces between 10(-14) and 10(-11) newtons. Deviations from the force curves predicted by the freely jointed chain model suggest that DNA has significant local curvature in solution. Ethidium bromide and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole had little effect on the elastic response of the molecules, but their extent of intercalation was directly measured. Conversely, the effect of bend-inducing cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) was large and supports the hypothesis of natural curvature in DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2033382511,"The 4-kilodalton (39 to 43 amino acids) amyloid β protein (βAP), which is deposited as amyloid in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease, is derived from a large protein, the amyloid β protein precursor (βAPP). Human mononuclear leukemic (K562) cells expressing a βAP-bearing, carboxyl-terminal βAPP derivative released significant amounts of a soluble 4-kilodalton βAPP derivative essentially identical to the βAP deposited in Alzheimer's disease. Human neuroblastoma (M17) cells transfected with constructs expressing full-length βAPP and M17 cells expressing only endogenous βAPP also released soluble 4-kilodalton βAP, and a similar, if not identical, fragment was readily detected in cerebrospinal fluid from individuals with Alzheimer's disease and normal individuals. Thus cells normally produce and release soluble 4-kilodalton βAP that is essentially identical to the 4-kilodalton βAP deposited as insoluble amyloid fibrils in Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2006813546,"An antigen detection system, termed immuno-polymerase chain reaction (immuno-PCR), was developed in which a specific DNA molecule is used as the marker. A streptavidin-protein A chimera that possesses tight and specific binding affinity both for biotin and immunoglobulin G was used to attach a biotinylated DNA specifically to antigen-monoclonal antibody complexes that had been immobilized on microtiter plate wells. Then, a segment of the attached DNA was amplified by PCR. Analysis of the PCR products by agarose gel electrophoresis after staining with ethidium bromide allowed as few as 580 antigen molecules (9.6 x 10(-22) moles) to be readily and reproducibly detected. Direct comparison with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with the use of a chimera-alkaline phosphatase conjugate demonstrates that enhancement (approximately x 10(5)) in detection sensitivity was obtained with the use of immuno-PCR. Given the enormous amplification capability and specificity of PCR, this immuno-PCR technology has a sensitivity greater than any existing antigen detection system and, in principle, could be applied to the detection of single antigen molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2042381594,"Abetalipoproteinemia is a human genetic disease that is characterized by a defect in the assembly or secretion of plasma very low density lipoproteins and chylomicrons. The microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), which is located in the lumen of microsomes isolated from the liver and intestine, has been proposed to function in lipoprotein assembly. MTP activity and the 88-kilodalton component of MTP were present in intestinal biopsy samples from eight control individuals but were absent in four abetalipoproteinemic subjects. This finding suggests that a defect in MTP is the basis for abetalipoproteinemia and that MTP is indeed required for lipoprotein assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2036344921,"Despite decades of intensive investigation, the basic pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for the metabolic derangements associated with diabetes mellitus have remained elusive. Explored here is the possibility that traditional concepts in this area might have carried the wrong emphasis. It is suggested that the phenomena of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia might be more readily understood if viewed in the context of underlying abnormalities of lipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2048041842,"Fatal familial insomnia (FFI) and a subtype of familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), two clinically and pathologically distinct diseases, are linked to the same mutation at codon 178 (Asn178) of the prion protein gene. The possibility that a second genetic component modified the phenotypic expression of the Asn178 mutation was investigated. FFI and the familial CJD subtype segregated with different genotypes determined by the Asn178 mutation and the methionine-valine polymorphism at codon 129. The Met129, Asn178 allele segregated with FFI in all 15 affected members of five kindreds whereas the Val129, Asn178 allele segregated with the familial CJD subtype in all 15 affected members of six kindreds. Thus, two distinct disease phenotypes linked to a single pathogenic mutation can be determined by a common polymorphism."
https://openalex.org/W1992286888,"A deletion map of the human Y chromosome was constructed by testing 96 individuals with partial Y chromosomes for the presence or absence of many DNA loci. The individuals studied included XX males, XY females, and persons in whom chromosome banding had revealed translocated, deleted, isodicentric, or ring Y chromosomes. Most of the 132 Y chromosomal loci mapped were sequence-tagged sites, detected by means of the polymerase chain reaction. These studies resolved the euchromatic region (short arm, centromere, and proximal long arm) of the Y chromosome into 43 ordered intervals, all defined by naturally occurring chromosomal breakpoints and averaging less than 800 kilobases in length. This deletion map should be useful in identifying Y chromosomal genes, in exploring the origin of chromosomal disorders, and in tracing the evolution of the Y chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W2019338546,"In a screen for transcriptional regulators that control differentiation into the T cell lineage, a complementary DNA was isolated encoding a zinc finger protein (Ikaros) related to the Drosophila gap protein Hunchback. The Ikaros protein binds to and activates the enhancer of a gene encoding an early T cell differentiation antigen, CD3 delta. During development, Ikaros messenger RNA was first detected in the mouse fetal liver and the embryonic thymus when hematopoietic and lymphoid progenitors initially colonize these organs; no expression was observed in the spleen or the bone marrow. The pattern of Ikaros gene expression and its ability to stimulate CD3 delta transcription support the model that Ikaros functions in the specification and maturation of the T lymphocyte."
https://openalex.org/W2037728764,The scanning transmission x-ray microscope at the National Synchrotron Light Source has been used to record x-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra from 0.01-square-micrometer regions of organic specimens. The spectral features observed reflect the molecular structure of the dominant absorbing atoms and provide the contrast mechanism for high-resolution imaging with chemical sensitivity. This technique was used with x-ray energies near the carbon K absorption edge to identify and map separate phases in various polymer blends and to map the DNA distribution in chromosomes with a spatial resolution of 55 nanometers.
https://openalex.org/W2014322763,"Human growth has been viewed as a continuous process characterized by changing velocity with age. Serial length measurements of normal infants were assessed weekly (n = 10), semiweekly (n = 18), and daily (n = 3) (19 females and 12 males) during their first 21 months. Data show that growth in length occurs by discontinuous, aperiodic saltatory spurts. These bursts were 0.5 to 2.5 centimeters in amplitude during intervals separated by no measurable growth (2 to 63 days duration). These data suggest that 90 to 95 percent of normal development during infancy is growth-free and length accretion is a distinctly saltatory process of incremental bursts punctuating background stasis."
https://openalex.org/W2084506717,"A national probability survey of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related risk factors among the general heterosexual population, the National AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) Behavioral Surveys, has obtained data from 10,630 respondents. Data are presented on the prevalence of HIV-related risks in the general heterosexual population, on the distribution of the three largest risk groups across social strata, and on the prevalence and distribution of condom use among heterosexuals reporting a risk factor. Between 15 and 31 percent of heterosexuals nationally and 20 and 41 percent in cities with a high prevalence of AIDS reported an HIV risk factor. Condom use was relatively low. Only 17 percent of those with multiple sexual partners, 12.6 percent of those with risky sexual partners, and 10.8 percent of untested transfusion recipients used condoms all the time. Overall, the results suggest that current HIV prevention programs have, to a very limited extent, reached those heterosexuals with multiple sexual partners but have failed to reach many other groups of the heterosexual population at risk for HIV. New public health strategies may be needed for these specific risk groups."
https://openalex.org/W2094391240,"The B cell antigen receptor complex is a hetero-oligomeric structure composed of antigen binding, membrane immunoglobulin, and transducer-transporter substructures. The transducer-transporter substructure is composed of disulfide-linked dimers of immunoglobulin (Ig)-alpha and Ig-beta/gamma subunits that are products of the mb-1(alpha) and B29 (beta/gamma) genes. Although the receptor complex associates with Src family kinases that are activated after receptor ligation, the site of interaction of these and other cytoplasmic effector molecules with receptor subunits is unknown. The cytoplasmic tails of Ig-alpha and Ig-beta chains were found to associate with distinct sets of effector molecules. The Ig-alpha chain cytoplasmic domain bound to the Src family kinases Lyn and Fyn, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3 kinase), and an unidentified 38-kilodalton phosphoprotein; the cytoplasmic tail of Ig-beta bound PI-3 kinase and unidentified 40- and 42-kilodalton phosphoproteins. Binding activity was found to occur within a 26-amino acid sequence of Ig-alpha and Ig-beta that contains a motif [(Asp or Glu)-(any amino acid)7-(Asp or Glu)-Tyr-(any amino acid)3-Leu-(any amino acid)7-Tyr-(any amino acid)2-(Leu or Ile)] previously implicated in signal transduction via other receptors including the Fc epsilon receptor I and the T cell antigen receptor. These findings indicate that the subunits act independently to activate distinct second messenger pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2082153466,"A thousandfold miniaturization of immobilized optical fiber sensors, a millionfold or more sample reduction, and at least a hundredfold shorter response time, all simultaneously, were achieved by combining nanofabricated optical fiber tips with near-field photopolymerization. Specifically, pH optical fiber sensors were prepared with internal calibration, making use of the differences in both fluorescence and absorption of the acidic and basic dye species. The submicrometer sensors have excellent detection limits, as well as photostability, reversibility, and millisecond response times. Successful applications include intracellular and intraembryonic measurements. Potential applications include spatially and temporally resolved chemical analysis and kinetics inside single biological cells and their substructures."
https://openalex.org/W2002350308,"Parasitism is a widespread and diverse life strategy that connects species throughout the animal kingdom. Female parasitoid flies of the genus Ormia must find a specific cricket host on which to deposit their parasitic maggots. To reproduce, female flies must perform the same task as female crickets: find a singing male cricket. These flies have evolved a unique hearing organ that allows them to detect and locate singing male crickets. Through evolutionary convergence, these flies possess a hearing organ that much more resembles a cricket's ear than a typical fly's ear, allowing these parasitoids to take advantage of the sensory ecological niche of their host."
https://openalex.org/W2042044018,"Members of the family of Ras-related guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding proteins appear to take part in the regulation of a number of biological processes, including cell growth and differentiation. Three different classes of proteins that regulate the GTP binding and GTP hydrolytic activities of the Ras family members have been identified. These different regulatory proteins inhibit guanosine diphosphate (GDP) dissociation (designated as GDIs), stimulate GDP dissociation and GDP-GTP exchange (designated as GDSs), or stimulate GTP hydrolysis (designated as GAPs). In the case of the Ras-like protein CDC42Hs, which is the human homolog of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell division cycle protein, the GDI protein also inhibited both the intrinsic and GAP-stimulated hydrolysis of GTP. These findings establish an additional role for the GDI protein--namely, as a guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) inhibitory protein for a Ras-like GTP binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1968846761,"The common laboratory strain of bacteriophage λ—λ wild type or λPaPa—carries a frameshift mutation relative to Ur-λ, the original isolate. The Ur-λ virions have thin, jointed tail fibers that are absent from λ wild type. Two novel proteins of Ur-λ constitute the fibers: the product of stf, the gene that is disrupted in λ wild type by the frameshift mutation, and the product of gene tfa, a protein that is implicated in facilitating tail fiber assembly. Relative to λ wild type, Ur-λ has expanded receptor specificity and adsorbs to Escherichia coli cells more rapidly."
https://openalex.org/W2056228522,"An x-ray resonance effect in an organic thin film on an x-ray reflecting mirror is reported. The resonance effect is the result of interference between reflected and refracted x-rays at the air-organic thin film interface and occurs at incident angles slightly above the critical angle of the film. In excellent agreement with theory, the primary resonant x-ray electric field that is confined in the organic thin film is ∼20 times as intense as the electric field of the incident beam when measured at a position close to the center of the film. Resonance-enhanced x-rays can be used to characterize the internal structure of Langmuir-Blodgett thin film membranes. This effect may also find use in x-ray-based thin film devices and in the structural analysis of adlayers and surfaces that have thus far proved difficult, if not impossible, to study because of sensitivity limitations."
https://openalex.org/W1994340284,"The smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (smMLCK) catalytic core was modeled by using the crystallographic coordinates of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (cAPK) and a bound pseudosubstrate inhibitor peptide, PKI(5-24). Despite only 30% identity in amino acid sequence, the MLCK sequence can be readily accommodated in this structure. With the exception of the short B-helix, all major elements of secondary structure in the core are very likely conserved. The active site of the modeled MLCK complements the known requirements for peptide substrate recognition. MLCK contains a pseudosubstrate sequence that overlaps the calmodulin binding domain and has been proposed to act as an intrasteric inhibitor and occupy the substrate binding site in the absence of Ca(2+)-calmodulin. The pseudosubstrate sequence can be modeled easily into the entire backbone of PKI(5-24). The results demonstrate that the intrasteric model for regulation of MLCK by intramolecular competitive inhibition is structurally plausible."

https://openalex.org/W1998522775,"In the absence of the leucine biosynthetic precursor α-isopropylmalate (α-IPM), the yeast LEU3 protein (Leu3p) binds DNA and acts as a transcriptional repressor in an in vitro extract. Addition of α-IPM resulted in a dramatic increase in Leu3p-dependent transcription. The presence of α-IPM was also required for Leu3p to compete effectively with another transcriptional activator, GAL4/VP16, for limiting transcription factors. Therefore, the addition of α-IPM appears to convert a transcriptional repressor into an activator. This represents an example in eukaryotes of direct transcriptional regulation by a small effector molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2050784170,"Selective events during T cell repertoire development in the thymus include both the positive selection of cells whose receptors recognize self-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and negative selection (tolerance) of cells whose interaction with self-MHC is of high affinity. The affinity of T cell interactions with class I MHC molecules includes contributions by both the T cell receptor and the CD8 coreceptor. Therefore, by decreasing the affinity of the interaction with CD8, T cells whose receptors have relatively high affinities for self-MHC may survive negative selection. Such T cells were generated and those T cells reactive with self-MHC plus antigen also displayed low affinity for self."
https://openalex.org/W2144140677,"When glycine418 of Escherichia coli glutathione reductase, which is in a closely packed region of the dimer interface, is replaced with a bulky tryptophan residue, the enzyme becomes highly cooperative (Hill coefficient 1.76) for glutathione binding. The cooperativity is lost when the mutant subunit is hybridized with a wild-type subunit to create a heterodimer. The mutation appears to disrupt atomic packing at the dimer interface, which induces a change of kinetic mechanism. A single mutation in a region of the protein remote from the active site can thus act as a molecular switch to confer cooperativity on an enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W2057093907,The generation of antibodies from a bifunctional cyclic phosphinate transition-state analog provided agents capable of efficiently catalyzing both steps of the overall conversion of a substrate containing an asparaginyl-glycyl sequence through a succinimide intermediate to the products aspartyl-glycyl and the rearranged isoaspartyl-glycyl sequence. This reaction provides a potential means in addition to amide cleavage for the deactivation of protein or peptide biological functions in vivo.
