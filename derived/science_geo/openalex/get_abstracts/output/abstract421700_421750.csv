https://openalex.org/W2082714048,"The reprogramming of adult cells into pluripotent cells or directly into alternative adult cell types holds great promise for regenerative medicine. We reported previously that cardiac fibroblasts, which represent 50% of the cells in the mammalian heart, can be directly reprogrammed to adult cardiomyocyte-like cells in vitro by the addition of Gata4, Mef2c and Tbx5 (GMT). Here we use genetic lineage tracing to show that resident non-myocytes in the murine heart can be reprogrammed into cardiomyocyte-like cells in vivo by local delivery of GMT after coronary ligation. Induced cardiomyocytes became binucleate, assembled sarcomeres and had cardiomyocyte-like gene expression. Analysis of single cells revealed ventricular cardiomyocyte-like action potentials, beating upon electrical stimulation, and evidence of electrical coupling. In vivo delivery of GMT decreased infarct size and modestly attenuated cardiac dysfunction up to 3 months after coronary ligation. Delivery of the pro-angiogenic and fibroblast-activating peptide, thymosin β4, along with GMT, resulted in further improvements in scar area and cardiac function. These findings demonstrate that cardiac fibroblasts can be reprogrammed into cardiomyocyte-like cells in their native environment for potential regenerative purposes. Previous work has shown that a combination of three transcription factors can directly reprogram cardiac fibroblasts into cardiomyocyte-like cell in vitro; now, the same authors demonstrate in vivo reprogramming of cardiac fibroblasts into induced cardiomyocytes. Having shown previously that a combination of three transcription factors can directly reprogram cardiac fibroblasts to cardiomyocyte-like cells — the cells that drive the heartbeat — in vitro, Deepak Srivastava and colleagues now take this approach in vivo. Using a retrovirus to deliver the transcription factors directly to the hearts of adult mice, they demonstrate the conversion of non-myocytes to induced cardiomyocytes. Heart function improved and the area of damaged tissue shrank. Delivery of the multifunctional peptide thymosin β4 — which activates cardiac fibroblasts — along with the cardiac reprogramming factors resulted in further reduction in scar area and improvement in cardiac function."

https://openalex.org/W1988067967,"A functional electrical stimulation system in primates that is controlled by recordings made from microelectrodes permanently implanted in the brain can be used to control the intensity of stimulation of muscles that are temporarily paralysed by pharmacological motor nerve blockade, thereby restoring voluntary control of the affected muscles; this is a major advance towards similar restoration of hand function in human patients with spinal cord injury. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) has been used to restore some control over hand movements in people who have suffered paralysis after a spinal-cord injury. It relies on residual movement or muscle activity to control electrical activation of the hand muscles. Current FES systems require pre-programmed information customized for an individual, and only limited grasping movements are possible. This paper reports a potential strategy for overcoming paralysis, involving the rerouting of cortical control signals directly to the muscles through a brain–machine interface. Monkeys whose arms were temporarily paralysed with anaesthetics learned to use the prosthetic to activate multiple muscles in a coordinated manner to grasp and manipulate objects. The system uses data recorded from neurons in the motor cortex to predict the intended activity of the paralysed muscles when carrying out the same task. Voluntary control of the paralysed muscles was induced by stimulating up to five electrodes in the identified muscles, in effect bypassing the monkey's spinal cord. The hope is that in humans, this type of neuroprosthesis might allow much more flexible and dexterous use of the hand than is possible with existing FES systems. Patients with spinal cord injury lack the connections between brain and spinal cord circuits that are essential for voluntary movement. Clinical systems that achieve muscle contraction through functional electrical stimulation (FES) have proven to be effective in allowing patients with tetraplegia to regain control of hand movements and to achieve a greater measure of independence in daily activities1,2. In existing clinical systems, the patient uses residual proximal limb movements to trigger pre-programmed stimulation that causes the paralysed muscles to contract, allowing use of one or two basic grasps. Instead, we have developed an FES system in primates that is controlled by recordings made from microelectrodes permanently implanted in the brain. We simulated some of the effects of the paralysis caused by C5 or C6 spinal cord injury3 by injecting rhesus monkeys with a local anaesthetic to block the median and ulnar nerves at the elbow. Then, using recordings from approximately 100 neurons in the motor cortex, we predicted the intended activity of several of the paralysed muscles, and used these predictions to control the intensity of stimulation of the same muscles. This process essentially bypassed the spinal cord, restoring to the monkeys voluntary control of their paralysed muscles. This achievement is a major advance towards similar restoration of hand function in human patients through brain-controlled FES. We anticipate that in human patients, this neuroprosthesis would allow much more flexible and dexterous use of the hand than is possible with existing FES systems."
https://openalex.org/W2070628315,"Transplanted rod precursor cells restore visual function, from electrophysiology to behaviour, after transplantation into a mouse model of congenital night blindness. Previous work has shown that retinal precursor cells can be transplanted successfully into degenerating retinas in mice, but evidence for improvement of vision has been lacking. Now Pearson et al. take a step forward in demonstrating the feasibility of this strategy for restoring vision. Using an improved transplantation protocol for introducing rod precursor cells into the retinas of mice that lack rods, the authors demonstrate that the transplanted cells integrate into and position correctly in the existing network, and that visual function, from electrophysiology to behaviour, is enhanced in the transplant recipients. The study provides important support for the further development of stem-cell therapy for retinal degeneration. Cell transplantation is a potential strategy for treating blindness caused by the loss of photoreceptors. Although transplanted rod-precursor cells are able to migrate into the adult retina and differentiate to acquire the specialized morphological features of mature photoreceptor cells1, the fundamental question remains whether transplantation of photoreceptor cells can actually improve vision. Here we provide evidence of functional rod-mediated vision after photoreceptor transplantation in adult Gnat1−/− mice, which lack rod function and are a model of congenital stationary night blindness2. We show that transplanted rod precursors form classic triad synaptic connections with second-order bipolar and horizontal cells in the recipient retina. The newly integrated photoreceptor cells are light-responsive with dim-flash kinetics similar to adult wild-type photoreceptors. By using intrinsic imaging under scotopic conditions we demonstrate that visual signals generated by transplanted rods are projected to higher visual areas, including V1. Moreover, these cells are capable of driving optokinetic head tracking and visually guided behaviour in the Gnat1−/− mouse under scotopic conditions. Together, these results demonstrate the feasibility of photoreceptor transplantation as a therapeutic strategy for restoring vision after retinal degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2097911822,"As an elementary particle the electron carries spin \hbar/2 and charge e. When binding to the atomic nucleus it also acquires an angular momentum quantum number corresponding to the quantized atomic orbital it occupies (e.g., s, p or d). Even if electrons in solids form bands and delocalize from the nuclei, in Mott insulators they retain their three fundamental quantum numbers: spin, charge and orbital[1]. The hallmark of one-dimensional (1D) physics is a breaking up of the elementary electron into its separate degrees of freedom[2]. The separation of the electron into independent quasi-particles that carry either spin (spinons) or charge (holons) was first observed fifteen years ago[3]. Using Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering on the 1D Mott-insulator Sr2CuO3 we now observe also the orbital degree of freedom separating. We resolve an orbiton liberating itself from spinons and propagating through the lattice as a distinct quasi-particle with a substantial dispersion of ~0.2 eV."
https://openalex.org/W2035243232,"Chemotherapy is an important component in the treatment paradigm for breast cancers. However, the resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents frequently results in the subsequent recurrence and metastasis. Identification of molecular markers to predict treatment outcome is therefore warranted. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) can predict clinical outcome in breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy.Circulating miRNAs in blood serum prior to treatment were determined by quantitative Real-Time PCR in 56 breast cancer patients with invasive ductal carcinoma and pre-operative neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunostaining and TUNEL were performed in surgical samples to determine the effects of chemotherapy on cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis, respectively. Among the miRNAs tested, only miR-125b was significantly associated with therapeutic response, exhibiting higher expression level in non-responsive patients (n = 26, 46%; p = 0.008). In addition, breast cancers with high miR-125b expression had higher percentage of proliferating cells and lower percentage of apoptotic cells in the corresponding surgical specimens obtained after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Increased resistance to anticancer drug was observed in vitro in breast cancer cells with ectopic miR-125b expression; conversely, reducing miR-125b level sensitized breast cancer cells to chemotherapy. Moreover, we demonstrated that the E2F3 was a direct target of miR-125b in breast cancer cells.These data suggest that circulating miR-125b expression is associated with chemotherapeutic resistance of breast cancer. This finding has important implications in the development of targeted therapeutics for overcoming chemotherapeutic resistance in novel anti-cancer strategies."

https://openalex.org/W2004479994,"The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) plays a fundamental role in maintaining visual function and dedifferentiation of RPE contributes to the pathophysiology of several ocular diseases. To identify microRNAs (miRNAs) that may be involved in RPE differentiation, we compared the miRNA expression profiles of differentiated primary human fetal RPE (hfRPE) cells to dedifferentiated hfRPE cells. We found that miR-204/211, the two most highly expressed miRNAs in the RPE, were significantly down-regulated in dedifferentiated hfRPE cells. Importantly, transfection of pre-miR-204/211 into hfRPE cells promoted differentiation whereas adding miR-204/211 inhibitors led to their dedifferentiation. Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is a key regulator of RPE differentiation that was also down-regulated in dedifferentiated hfRPE cells. MITF knockdown decreased miR-204/211 expression and caused hfRPE dedifferentiation. Significantly, co-transfection of MITF siRNA with pre-miR-204/211 rescued RPE phenotype. Collectively, our data show that miR-204/211 promote RPE differentiation, suggesting that miR-204/211-based therapeutics may be effective treatments for diseases that involve RPE dedifferentiation such as proliferative vitreoretinopathy."
https://openalex.org/W1990240164,"We established a new in vivo arrestin-3-JNK3 interaction assay based on bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) between JNK3-luciferase and Venus-arrestins. We tested the ability of WT arrestin-3 and its 3A mutant that readily binds β2-adrenergic receptors as well as two mutants impaired in receptor binding, Δ7 and KNC, to directly bind JNK3 and to promote JNK3 phosphorylation in cells. Both receptor binding-deficient mutants interact with JNK3 significantly better than WT and 3A arrestin-3. WT arrestin-3 and Δ7 mutant robustly promoted JNK3 activation, whereas 3A and KNC mutants did not. Thus, receptor binding, JNK3 interaction, and JNK3 activation are three distinct arrestin functions. We found that the KNC mutant, which tightly binds ASK1, MKK4, and JNK3 without facilitating JNK3 phosphorylation, has a dominant-negative effect, competitively decreasing JNK activation by WT arrestin-3. Thus, KNC is a silent scaffold, a novel type of molecular tool for the suppression of MAPK signaling in living cells.

Typical MAP kinase cascades consist of three kinases that successively phosphorylate and activate the downstream component. In many cases the activation of MAP kinase cascades is controlled by the binding of all three kinases to a scaffolding protein (5Burack W.R. Shaw A.S. Signal transduction. Hanging on a scaffold.Curr.

Thus, binding per se does not necessarily translate into productive scaffolding, suggesting that to facilitate signaling in this cascade, arrestin needs to hold the kinases in an optimal orientation. Recently we identified several arrestin-3 mutants that bind ASK1, MKK4, and JNK3 at least as well as wild type (WT) arrestin-3 but fail to facilitate JNK3 phosphorylation in the cell (13Seo J. Tsakem E.L. Breitman M. Gurevich V.V. Identification of arrestin-3-specific residues necessary for JNK3 kinase activation.J. Biol.

These findings suggest the possibility of designing a “silent scaffold,” i.e. an arrestin that binds the kinases well enough to compete with other scaffolds and holds them in an unproductive complex, thereby decreasing JNK activity in the cell. Here we provide the first demonstration that this mechanism of MAPK regulation works in living cells. We show that an arrestin-3 mutant that tightly binds upstream kinases and JNK3 without facilitating its phosphorylation acts in a dominant-negative fashion, competitively decreasing JNK3 activation by an active scaffold, WT arrestin-3. Silent scaffold is a novel type of molecular tool for the manipulation of MAPK signaling, which can be used for scientific and therapeutic purposes.

Arrestins were visualized with F4C1 mouse monoclonal antibody (29Wacker W.B. Donoso L.A. Kalsow C.M. Yankeelov Jr., J.A. Organisciak D.T. Experimental allergic uveitis. Isolation, characterization, and localization of a soluble uveitopathogenic antigen from bovine retina.J. Immunol. 1977; 119: 1949-1958PubMed Google Scholar) (1:10,000). Protein bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Pierce) and x-ray film. COS-7 cells were transfected in 60-mm dishes with 0–12 μg of Venus-arrestin constructs along with 125 ng of β2AR-RLuc8 plasmid and empty pcDNA3 to equalize DNA. After 24 h cells were reseeded at 100,000 to 200,000 cells per well onto white opaque 96-well microplates (Nunc, Rochester, NY) for luminescence or black opaque microplates (Nunc) for fluorescence measurements. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the medium was replaced with PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+ containing 0.01% glucose (w/v), 36 mg/liter sodium pyruvate, and 25 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.2. Coelenterazine-h (DiscoveRx, Fremont, CA) at 5 μm was added 8 min after agonist (25 μm isoproterenol), and luminescence was measured using Synergy 4 microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT). The light emitted by coelenterazine-h and Venus in each well was measured for 1 s through 460- and 535-nm filters. The BRET ratio was calculated as the long wavelength emission divided by the short wavelength emission. The expression of Venus-arrestins was evaluated using fluorescence at 535 nm upon excitation at 485 nm. Venus-arrestin fluorescence was normalized by the luminescence from the β2AR-RLuc8 to account for variations in cell number and expression. The curves were fit to a sigmoid (BRET ratio) or hyperbola (net BRET) using Prism Version 5.04 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Venus-arrestin fusions were co-expressed with JNK3α2 fused at the C terminus to Rluc (JNK3α2-Rluc). Forty-eight hours after transfection 5 μm Coelenterazine h was added, and readings were collected by Synergy 4 microplate reader. The BRET signal was determined as the ratio of the light emitted by the Venus-arrestin-3 (528–548 nm) over the light emitted by the JNK3α2-Rluc (460–500 nm). The background signal detected with the ΔN-JNK3α2-Rluc expressed at the same level as JNK3α2-Rluc was subtracted. COS-7 cells transfected with arrestins, HA-JNK3, and HA-ASK1 were seeded on Lab-Tek chambered slides coated with poly-d-lysine (15 μg/ml) and fibronectin (20 μg/ml) in PBS, serum-starved overnight, washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized by PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100, and blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Venus-arrestin fluorescence was observed directly. Phospho-JNK was detected by indirect immunofluorescence using the phospho-JNK antibody that recognizes all phosphorylated JNK isoforms (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) followed by biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories) and Alexa Fluor 568 secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). Images were acquired on a Nikon TE2000-E microscope. Cells (60 mm plates) were lysed in 0.75 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 2 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm PMSF) for 30–60 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, supernatants were precleared by 35 μl of protein G-agarose. Supernatants (250 μg of total protein) were incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h then with 25 μl of protein G-agarose beads for 2 h or overnight. The beads were washed 3 times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, and the proteins were eluted with 50 μl of SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and analyzed by Western blot (13Seo J. Tsakem E.L. Breitman M.

The bands on the x-ray film were measured on VersaDoc and quantified using QuantityOne software (Bio-Rad). Statistical significance of the differences between groups was determined using one-way or two-way ANOVA as appropriate followed by Bonferroni/Dunn or Scheffe post hoc tests with correction for multiple comparisons. The details of the analysis of each dataset are given in the figure legends.

Therefore, we used BRET between luciferase-tagged β2AR and Venus-tagged arrestins to compare the ability of several arrestin-3 mutants to bind the receptor in the cellular context (Fig. 1). We recently found that, in contrast to arrestin-2, WT arrestin-3 demonstrates relatively high basal binding to β2AR and that this interaction is enhanced when the receptor is stimulated with a saturating concentration of the agonist isoproterenol (19Zhan X.

We found that in cells receptor binding of Δ7 is significantly lower than that of WT arrestin-3 or 3A mutant.

https://openalex.org/W2060507572,"The angiotensin converting enzymes (ACEs) are the key catalytic components of the renin-angiotensin system, mediating precise regulation of blood pressure by counterbalancing the effects of each other. Inhibition of ACE has been shown to improve pathology in cardiovascular disease, whilst ACE2 is cardioprotective in the failing heart. However, the mechanisms by which ACE2 mediates its cardioprotective functions have yet to be fully elucidated. Here we demonstrate that both ACE and ACE2 bind integrin subunits, in an RGD-independent manner, and that they can act as cell adhesion substrates. We show that cellular expression of ACE2 enhanced cell adhesion. Furthermore, we present evidence that soluble ACE2 (sACE2) is capable of suppressing integrin signalling mediated by FAK. In addition, sACE2 increases the expression of Akt, thereby lowering the proportion of the signalling molecule phosphorylated Akt. These results suggest that ACE2 plays a role in cell-cell interactions, possibly acting to fine-tune integrin signalling. Hence the expression and cleavage of ACE2 at the plasma membrane may influence cell-extracellular matrix interactions and the signalling that mediates cell survival and proliferation. As such, ectodomain shedding of ACE2 may play a role in the process of pathological cardiac remodelling."
https://openalex.org/W1979413396,"Previously we demonstrated that basolateral LPS inhibits HCO3− absorption in the renal medullary thick ascending limb (MTAL) through TLR4-dependent ERK activation. Here we report that the response of the MTAL to basolateral LPS requires TLR2 in addition to TLR4. The basolateral addition of LPS (ultrapure Escherichia coli K12) decreased HCO3− absorption in isolated, perfused MTALs from wild-type mice but had no effect in MTALs from TLR2−/− mice. In contrast, inhibition of HCO3− absorption by lumen LPS was preserved in TLR2−/− MTALs, indicating that TLR2 is involved specifically in mediating the basolateral LPS response. LPS also did not increase ERK phosphorylation in MTALs from TLR2−/− mice. TLR2 deficiency had no effect on expression of TLR4, MD-2, or MyD88. However, LPS-induced recruitment of MyD88 to the basolateral membrane was impaired in TLR2−/− MTALs. Inhibition of HCO3− absorption by LPS did not require CD14. Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated an association between TLR4 and TLR2. Inhibition of HCO3− absorption by TLR2-specific ligands was preserved in MTALs from TLR4−/− mice. These results indicate that the effect of basolateral LPS to inhibit HCO3− absorption in the MTAL through MyD88-dependent ERK activation depends on a novel interaction between TLR4 and TLR2. TLR2 plays a dual role in the induction of intracellular signals that impair MTAL function, both through cooperation with TLR4 to mediate ERK signaling by LPS and through a TLR4-independent signaling pathway activated by Gram-positive bacterial ligands.

Following LPS recognition, TLR4 activates intracellular signaling pathways that result in the induction of innate immune responses, including the activation of transcription factors that regulate the induction of genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines (22Kawai T. Akira S. The role of pattern-recognition receptors in innate immunity. Update on Toll-like receptors.Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (6223) Google Scholar, 31Kawai T. Akira S. TLR signaling.Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar). Our studies of the effects of LPS on MTAL function uncovered a novel sidedness to TLR4 signaling in epithelial cells. LPS inhibits HCO3− absorption in the MTAL from either the basolateral or luminal cell surface through the activation of TLR4 (14Good D.W. George T. Watts 3rd, B.A. Lipopolysaccharide directly alters renal tubule transport through distinct TLR4-dependent pathways in basolateral and apical membranes.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2009; 297: F866-F874Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, the underlying signaling mechanisms are different. Basolateral LPS decreases HCO3− absorption through the activation of an ERK-dependent pathway (14Good D.W. George T. Watts 3rd, B.A. Lipopolysaccharide directly alters renal tubule transport through distinct TLR4-dependent pathways in basolateral and apical membranes.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2009; 297: F866-F874Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 32Watts 3rd, B.A. George T. Sherwood E.R. Good D.W. Basolateral LPS inhibits NHE3 and HCO3− absorption through TLR4/MyD88-dependent ERK activation in medullary thick ascending limb.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2011; 301: C1296-C1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In contrast, inhibition by lumen LPS is unaffected by ERK inhibitors but is eliminated by PI3K inhibitors and rapamycin, consistent with the activation of a PI3K-mTOR signaling pathway (14Good D.W. George T. Watts 3rd, B.A. Lipopolysaccharide directly alters renal tubule transport through distinct TLR4-dependent pathways in basolateral and apical membranes.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2009; 297: F866-F874Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, LPS inhibits HCO3− absorption in the MTAL through the activation of distinct TLR4-mediated signaling pathways in the basolateral and apical membranes. The molecular mechanisms that underlie this membrane-specific TLR4 signal specificity are undefined and have important implications for the selective targeting of TLR4-induced inflammatory responses in epithelial cells. In addition to inhibition by Gram-negative LPS through TLR4, absorption of HCO3− by the MTAL is inhibited by Gram-positive bacterial molecules through TLR2. TLR2 is expressed selectively in the basolateral membrane of MTAL cells, in contrast to TLR4, which is expressed in both basolateral and apical membrane domains (14Good D.W. George T. Watts 3rd, B.A. Lipopolysaccharide directly alters renal tubule transport through distinct TLR4-dependent pathways in basolateral and apical membranes.Am. J. Physiol.

MTAL HCO3− absorption is inhibited by bacterial lipopeptides [N-palmitoyl-S-[2,3- bis(palmitoyloxy)-(2RS)-propyl]-[R]-cysteinyl-[S]-seryl-[S]- lysyl-[S]-lysine × 3 HCl (Pam3CSK4)] and Gram-positive bacterial cell wall structures (lipoteichoic acid and peptidoglycan) recognized by TLR2 (15Good D.W. George T. Watts 3rd, B.A. Toll-like receptor 2 mediates inhibition of HCO3− absorption by bacterial lipoprotein in medullary thick ascending limb.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2010; 299: F536-F544Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Moreover, the inhibition by Gram-positive bacterial components is additive to inhibition by basolateral LPS, due to the TLR2 and TLR4 agonists activating different cell signaling pathways (15Good D.W. George T. Watts 3rd, B.A. Toll-like receptor 2 mediates inhibition of HCO3− absorption by bacterial lipoprotein in medullary thick ascending limb.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2010; 299: F536-F544Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These findings have important implications for the pathogenesis of kidney dysfunction during polymicrobial sepsis because they show that Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial molecules can act independently and additively to impair renal tubule function by activating different intracellular signals through different TLRs (15Good D.W. George T. Watts 3rd, B.A. Toll-like receptor 2 mediates inhibition of HCO3− absorption by bacterial lipoprotein in medullary thick ascending limb.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2010; 299: F536-F544Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The separate effects of TLR2 and TLR4 ligands to alter renal tubule function are consistent with the distinct roles of these receptors in bacterial recognition, in which TLR4 is critical for defense against Gram-negative infection through recognition of LPS, and TLR2 plays a predominant role in detection and protection against Gram-positive infection (23Poltorak A.

A unique feature of TLR2 is its ability to interact with other TLRs (TLR1 and TLR6) to form heterodimers that discriminate between different bacterial lipoproteins.

Studies using an enzyme complementation assay and co-immunoprecipitation to examine TLR dimerization in transfected cells found that TLR2 also is capable of interacting with TLR4 (42Lee H.K. Dunzendorfer S. Tobias P.S. Cytoplasmic domain-mediated dimerizations of Toll-like receptor 4 observed by β-lactamase enzyme fragment complementation.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10564-10574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge, a physical association between TLR2 and TLR4 has not been reported in native cells, and no ligand has been identified that requires the co-presence of TLR2 and TLR4 for cell activation (42Lee H.K. Dunzendorfer S. Tobias P.S. Cytoplasmic domain-mediated dimerizations of Toll-like receptor 4 observed by β-lactamase enzyme fragment complementation.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10564-10574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, the possible biological and functional significance of a TLR2-TLR4 association is unknown. In the present study, we report that TLR2 is required along with TLR4 for the response of the MTAL to Gram-negative bacterial LPS. Our results show that the effects of basolateral LPS to activate ERK and inhibit HCO3− absorption are dependent on both TLR4 and TLR2 and provide evidence of an association between TLR4 and TLR2. In contrast, the TLR4-mediated inhibition of HCO3− absorption by lumen LPS does not depend on TLR2, indicating that TLR2 is required specifically for the basolateral LPS response. These findings reveal a novel requirement for TLR2 in LPS-induced TLR4 signaling and suggest that interaction between TLR4 and TLR2 may play a role in mediating renal tubule dysfunction during sepsis. Mice deficient in TLR2 (B6.129-Tlr2tmlKir/J; TLR2−/−), CD14 (B6.129S-Cd14tm1Frm/J; CD14−/−), and TLR4 (C57BL/10ScNJ; TLR4−/−), and wild-type control mice (C57BL/6J for TLR2−/− and CD14−/−) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were 6–8 weeks old. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (50–90 g, body weight) were purchased from Taconic (Germantown, NY). The animals were maintained under pathogen-free conditions in microisolator cages and received standard rodent chow (NIH 31 diet, Ziegler) and water up to the time of experiments. All protocols in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of The University of Texas Medical Branch.

https://openalex.org/W2056516077,"Brain images contain information suitable for automatically sorting subjects into categories such as healthy controls and patients. We sought to identify morphometric criteria for distinguishing controls (n = 28) from patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), 60 with and 20 without hippocampal atrophy (TLE-HA and TLE-N, respectively), and for determining the presumed side of seizure onset. The framework employs multi-atlas segmentation to estimate the volumes of 83 brain structures. A kernel-based separability criterion was then used to identify structures whose volumes discriminate between the groups. Next, we applied support vector machines (SVM) to the selected set for classification on the basis of volumes. We also computed pairwise similarities between all subjects and used spectral analysis to convert these into per-subject features. SVM was again applied to these feature data. After training on a subgroup, all TLE-HA patients were correctly distinguished from controls, achieving an accuracy of 96 ± 2% in both classification schemes. For TLE-N patients, the accuracy was 86 ± 2% based on structural volumes and 91 ± 3% using spectral analysis. Structures discriminating between patients and controls were mainly localized ipsilaterally to the presumed seizure focus. For the TLE-HA group, they were mainly in the temporal lobe; for the TLE-N group they included orbitofrontal regions, as well as the ipsilateral substantia nigra. Correct lateralization of the presumed seizure onset zone was achieved using hippocampi and parahippocampal gyri in all TLE-HA patients using either classification scheme; in the TLE-N patients, lateralization was accurate based on structural volumes in 86 ± 4%, and in 94 ± 4% with the spectral analysis approach. Unilateral TLE has imaging features that can be identified automatically, even when they are invisible to human experts. Such morphometric image features may serve as classification and lateralization criteria. The technique also detects unsuspected distinguishing features like the substantia nigra, warranting further study."
https://openalex.org/W2114855814,"It has been recognized that there is a relationship between prenatal growth restriction and the development of metabolic-related diseases in later life, a process involved in mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) increases the susceptibility of offspring to high-fat (HF) diet-induced metabolic syndrome. Recent findings suggested that HF feeding decreased mitochondrial oxidative capacity and impaired mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle. Therefore, we hypothesized that the long-term consequences of IUGR on mitochondrial biogenesis and function make the offspring more susceptible to HF diet-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Normal birth weight (NBW), and IUGR pigs were allotted to control or HF diet in a completely randomized design, individually. After 4 weeks of feeding, growth performance and molecular pathways related to mitochondrial function were determined. The results showed that IUGR decreased growth performance and plasma insulin concentrations. In offspring fed a HF diet, IUGR was associated with enhanced plasma leptin levels, increased concentrations of triglyceride and malondialdehyde (MDA), and reduced glycogen and ATP contents in skeletal muscle. High fat diet-fed IUGR offspring exhibited decreased activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). These alterations in metabolic traits of IUGR pigs were accompanied by impaired mitochondrial respiration function, reduced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) contents, and down-regulated mRNA expression levels of genes responsible for mitochondrial biogenesis and function. In conclusion, our results suggest that IUGR make the offspring more susceptible to HF diet-induced mitochondrial dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W1996978624,"Lycium barbarum, commonly known as wolfberry, has been used as a traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of infertility and sexual dysfunction. However, there is still a scarcity of experimental evidence to support the pro-sexual effect of wolfberry. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBP) on male sexual behavior of rats. Here we report that oral feeding of LBP for 21 days significantly improved the male copulatory performance including increase of copulatory efficiency, increase of ejaculation frequency and shortening of ejaculation latency. Furthermore, sexual inhibition caused by chronic corticosterone was prevented by LBP. Simultaneously, corticosterone suppressed neurogenesis in subventricular zone and hippocampus in adult rats, which could be reversed by LBP. The neurogenic effect of LBP was also shown in vitro. Significant correlation was found between neurogenesis and sexual performance, suggesting that the newborn neurons are associated with reproductive successfulness. Blocking neurogenesis in male rats abolished the pro-sexual effect of LBP. Taken together, these results demonstrate the pro-sexual effect of LBP on normal and sexually-inhibited rats, and LBP may modulate sexual behavior by regulating neurogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1991208799,"ABC transporters harness the energy from ATP binding and hydrolysis to translocate substrates across the membrane. Binding of two ATP molecules at the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) leads to the formation of an outward-facing state. The conformational changes required to reset the transporter to the inward-facing state are initiated by sequential hydrolysis of the bound nucleotides. In a homodimeric ABC exporter such as MsbA responsible for lipid A transport in Escherichia coli, sequential ATP hydrolysis implies the existence of an asymmetric conformation. Here we report the in vitro selection of a designed ankyrin repeat protein (DARPin) specifically binding to detergent-solubilized MsbA. Only one DARPin binds to the homodimeric transporter in the absence as well as in the presence of nucleotides, suggesting that it recognizes asymmetries in MsbA. DARPin binding increases the rate of ATP hydrolysis by a factor of two independent of the substrate-induced ATPase stimulation. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements are found to be in good agreement with the available crystal structures and reveal that DARPin binding does not affect the large nucleotide-driven conformational changes of MsbA. The binding epitope was mapped by cross-linking and EPR to the membrane-spanning part of the transmembrane domain (TMD). Using cross-linked DARPin-MsbA complexes, 8-azido-ATP was found to preferentially photolabel one chain of the homodimer, suggesting that the asymmetries captured by DARPin binding at the TMDs are propagated to the NBDs. This work demonstrates that in vitro selected binders are useful tools to study the mechanism of membrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2018083132,"The accumulation of the widely-used antibacterial and antifungal compound triclosan (TCS) in freshwaters raises concerns about the impact of this harmful chemical on the biofilms that are the dominant life style of microorganisms in aquatic systems. However, investigations to-date rarely go beyond effects at the cellular, physiological or morphological level. The present paper focuses on bacterial biofilms addressing the possible chemical impairment of their functionality, while also examining their substratum stabilization potential as one example of an important ecosystem service. The development of a bacterial assemblage of natural composition--isolated from sediments of the Eden Estuary (Scotland, UK)--on non-cohesive glass beads (<63 µm) and exposed to a range of triclosan concentrations (control, 2-100 µg L(-1)) was monitored over time by Magnetic Particle Induction (MagPI). In parallel, bacterial cell numbers, division rate, community composition (DGGE) and EPS (extracellular polymeric substances: carbohydrates and proteins) secretion were determined. While the triclosan exposure did not prevent bacterial settlement, biofilm development was increasingly inhibited by increasing TCS levels. The surface binding capacity (MagPI) of the assemblages was positively correlated to the microbial secreted EPS matrix. The EPS concentrations and composition (quantity and quality) were closely linked to bacterial growth, which was affected by enhanced TCS exposure. Furthermore, TCS induced significant changes in bacterial community composition as well as a significant decrease in bacterial diversity. The impairment of the stabilization potential of bacterial biofilm under even low, environmentally relevant TCS levels is of concern since the resistance of sediments to erosive forces has large implications for the dynamics of sediments and associated pollutant dispersal. In addition, the surface adhesive capacity of the biofilm acts as a sensitive measure of ecosystem effects."
https://openalex.org/W2060122884,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a major class of small non-coding RNAs that act as negative regulators at the post-transcriptional level in animals and plants. In this study, all known miRNAs in four plant species (Arabidopsis thaliana, Populus trichocarpa, Oryza sativa and Sorghum bicolor) have been analyzed, using a combination of computational and comparative genomic approaches, to systematically identify and characterize the miRNAs that were derived from repetitive elements and duplication events. The study provides a complete mapping, at the genome scale, of all the miRNAs found on repetitive elements in the four test plant species. Significant differences between repetitive element-related miRNAs and non-repeat-derived miRNAs were observed for many characteristics, including their location in protein-coding and intergenic regions in genomes, their conservation in plant species, sequence length of their hairpin precursors, base composition of their hairpin precursors and the minimum free energy of their hairpin structures. Further analysis showed that a considerable number of miRNA families in the four test plant species arose from either tandem duplication events, segmental duplication events or a combination of the two. However, comparative analysis suggested that the contribution made by these two duplication events differed greatly between the perennial tree species tested and the other three annual species. The expansion of miRNA families in A. thaliana, O. sativa and S. bicolor are more likely to occur as a result of tandem duplication events than from segmental duplications. In contrast, genomic segmental duplications contributed significantly more to the expansion of miRNA families in P. trichocarpa than did tandem duplication events. Taken together, this study has successfully characterized miRNAs derived from repetitive elements and duplication events at the genome scale and provides comprehensive knowledge and deeper insight into the origins and evolution of miRNAs in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2081492047,"Antibiotic resistance is an increasing problem in the health care system and we are in a constant race with evolving bacteria. Biofilm-associated growth is thought to play a key role in bacterial adaptability and antibiotic resistance. We employed a systems biology approach to identify candidate drug targets for biofilm-associated bacteria by imitating specific microenvironments found in microbial communities associated with biofilm formation. A previously reconstructed metabolic model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) was used to study the effect of gene deletion on bacterial growth in planktonic and biofilm-like environmental conditions. A set of 26 genes essential in both conditions was identified. Moreover, these genes have no homology with any human gene. While none of these genes were essential in only one of the conditions, we found condition-dependent genes, which could be used to slow growth specifically in biofilm-associated PA. Furthermore, we performed a double gene deletion study and obtained 17 combinations consisting of 21 different genes, which were conditionally essential. While most of the difference in double essential gene sets could be explained by different medium composition found in biofilm-like and planktonic conditions, we observed a clear effect of changes in oxygen availability on the growth performance. Eight gene pairs were found to be synthetic lethal in oxygen-limited conditions. These gene sets may serve as novel metabolic drug targets to combat particularly biofilm-associated PA. Taken together, this study demonstrates that metabolic modeling of human pathogens can be used to identify oxygen-sensitive drug targets and thus, that this systems biology approach represents a powerful tool to identify novel candidate antibiotic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2017422378,"FGF21 stimulates FGFR1c activity in cells that co-express Klothoβ (KLB); however, relatively little is known about the interaction of these receptors at the plasma membrane. We measured the dynamics and distribution of fluorescent protein-tagged KLB and FGFR1c in living cells using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and number and brightness analysis. We confirmed that fluorescent protein-tagged KLB translocates to the plasma membrane and is active when co-expressed with FGFR1c. FGF21-induced signaling was enhanced in cells treated with lactose, a competitive inhibitor of the galectin lattice, suggesting that lattice-binding modulates KLB and/or FGFR1c activity. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis consistently revealed that lactose treatment increased KLB mobility at the plasma membrane, but did not affect the mobility of FGFR1c. The association of endogenous KLB with the galectin lattice was also confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation with galectin-3. KLB mobility increased when co-expressed with FGFR1c, suggesting that the two receptors form a heterocomplex independent of the galectin lattice. Number and brightness analysis revealed that KLB and FGFR1c behave as monomers and dimers at the plasma membrane, respectively. Co-expression resulted in monomeric expression of KLB and FGFR1c consistent with formation of a 1:1 heterocomplex. Subsequent addition of FGF21 induced FGFR1 dimerization without changing KLB aggregate size, suggesting formation of a 1:2 KLB-FGFR1c signaling complex. Overall, these data suggest that KLB and FGFR1 form a 1:1 heterocomplex independent of the galectin lattice that transitions to a 1:2 complex upon the addition of FGF21."

Although there is an immediate survival benefit, the subsequent absence of the tail may inhibit locomotor performance, alter activity and habitat use, and increase the individuals' susceptibility to future predation attempts. We used laboratory experiments to examine the impact of tail autotomy on locomotor performance, activity and basking site selection in two lizard species, the delicate skink (Lampropholis delicata) and garden skink (L. guichenoti), that occur sympatrically throughout southeastern Australia and are exposed to an identical suite of potential predators. Post-autotomy tail movement did not differ between the two Lampropholis species, although a positive relationship between the shed tail length and distance moved, but not the duration of movement, was observed. Tail autotomy resulted in a substantial decrease in sprint speed in both species (28–39%), although this impact was limited to the optimal performance temperature (30°C). Although L. delicata was more active than L. guichenoti, tail autotomy resulted in decreased activity in both species. Sheltered basking sites were preferred over open sites by both Lampropholis species, although this preference was stronger in L. delicata. Caudal autotomy did not alter the basking site preferences of either species. Thus, both Lampropholis species had similar behavioural responses to autotomy. Our study also indicates that the impact of tail loss on locomotor performance may be temperature-dependent and highlights that future studies should be conducted over a broad thermal range."

Fasting and postprandial plasma samples were obtained at baseline, three, and six months. A targeted mass spectrometry-based platform was used to measure concentrations of individual free fatty acids (FFA), amino acids (AA), and acylcarnitines (AC). S(I) was measured with an intravenous glucose tolerance test.Over three and six months, there were significantly larger differences in fasting-to-postprandial (FPP) concentrations of medium and long chain AC (byproducts of FA oxidation) in the CR relative to Control and a tendency for the same in CR+EX (CR-3 month P = 0.02; CR-6 month P = 0.002; CR+EX-3 month P = 0.09; CR+EX-6 month P = 0.08). After three months of CR, there was a trend towards a larger difference in FPP FFA concentrations (P = 0.07; CR-3 month P = 0.08). Time-varying differences in FPP concentrations of AC and AA were independently related to time-varying S(I) (P<0.05 for both).Based on changes in intermediates of FA oxidation following a food challenge, CR imparted improvements in metabolic flexibility that correlated with improvements in S(I).ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00099151."

Hence LHCGR signaling is important for the maturation and function of the ovary and testis. GPCRs transmit extracellular signals through heterotrimeric G proteins, which consist of Gα and Gβγ subunits (1Oldham W.M. Hamm H.E. Heterotrimeric G protein activation by G-protein-coupled receptors.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 60-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Agonist-occupation of GPCRs activates the G protein, leading to dissociation of Gβγ from Gα. Gβγ transmits GPCR signals via downstream effectors such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) (2Smrcka A.V. G protein βγ subunits: central mediators of G protein-coupled receptor signaling.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 2191-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). PI3K converts PI 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to PI 4,5,3-trisphosphate (PIP3), a second messenger, which recruits to the cell surface and activates proteins containing a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (3Taniguchi C.M.

Stephens L.R. PI3Kγ is a key regulator of inflammatory responses and cardiovascular homeostasis.Science. 2007; 318: 64-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Wortmannin is a fungal metabolite that acts as a highly selective inhibitor of PI3K (5Okada T. Kawano Y. Sakakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of LH or CG to LHCGR results mainly in activation of Gαs-coupled adenylyl cyclase. The involvement of Gs-coupled adenylyl cyclase activation and subsequent cAMP accumulation in LHCGR-mediated steroidogenesis is well established (6Ascoli M. Fanelli F. Segaloff D.L. The lutropin/choriogonadotropin receptor, a 2002 perspective.Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 141-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). It has been shown that LH/CG-induced internalization and subsequent lysosomal degradation of LHCGR is the most important contributor to the down-regulation of this receptor (7Wang H. Segaloff D.L. Ascoli M. Lutropin/choriogonadotropin down-regulates its receptor by both receptor-mediated endocytosis and a cAMP-dependent reduction in receptor mRNA.J. Biol.

Most GPCRs are internalized from the cell surface following their activation to dampen the biological response, to recycle and resensitize the receptor through dephosphorylation, or to propagate signals through novel transduction pathways (8Hanyaloglu A.C. von Zastrow M. Regulation of GPCRs by endocytic membrane trafficking and its potential implications.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2008; 48: 537-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Agonist-induced GPCR internalization is predominantly mediated by GPCR kinases (GRKs), arrestins, and clathrin-coated pits. GRKs phosphorylate agonist-activated GPCRs to facilitate the recruitment of arrestins, which target GPCR to clathrin-coated pits for rapid internalization (9Gurevich V.V. Gurevich E.V. The structural basis of arrestin-mediated regulation of G-protein-coupled receptors.Pharmacol. Ther. 2006; 110: 465-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Dynamin GTPases plays a key role in agonist-induced GPCR internalization by inducing the fission of clathrin-coated vesicles. However, in the case of LHCGR, formation of the receptor/arrestin complex depends mostly on the agonist-induced activation of the LHCGR rather than on the phosphorylation of the LHCGR (10Min L. Ascoli M. Effect of activating and inactivating mutations on the phosphorylation and trafficking of the human lutropin/choriogonadotropin receptor.Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1797-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and the ARF6 small GTPase plays a critical role in the recruitment of β-arrestin (11Hunzicker-Dunn M. Gurevich V.V. Casanova J.E. Mukherjee S. ARF6: a newly appreciated player in G protein-coupled receptor desensitization.FEBS Lett. 2002; 521: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the follicular membrane, the agonist-stimulation of LHCGR results in ARF6 activation and release of arrestins from the plasma membrane, making it available for binding to LHCGR with subsequent internalization of the receptor (11Hunzicker-Dunn M. Gurevich V.V. Casanova J.E. Mukherjee S. ARF6: a newly appreciated player in G protein-coupled receptor desensitization.FEBS Lett. 2002; 521: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). ARF6 is a member of the ARF family of small GTPases, which regulate multiple cellular events by cycling between active GTP- and inactive GDP-bound forms. ARFs depend on guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for activation and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) for inactivation. Among the six known mammalian ARF isoforms (ARFs1–6), ARF1 and ARF6 are the best characterized. ARF1 localizes to and acts at the Golgi whereas ARF6 localizes to and acts at the cell periphery. ARF6 mediates cell surface receptor internalization and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton beneath the plasma membrane (12Moss J. Vaughan M. Molecules in the ARF orbit.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21431-21434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Brefeldin A (BFA), a fungal toxin, inhibits activation of ARFs1–5 but not ARF6 (13Donaldson J.G.

However, ARF6 activation by the cytohesin family of ARF GEFs is inhibited by SecinH3, a cell permeable triazole compound (15Hafner M. Schmitz A. Grüne I. Srivatsan S.G. Paul B. Kolanus W. Quast T. Kremmer E. Bauer I. Famulok M. Inhibition of cytohesins by SecinH3 leads to hepatic insulin resistance.Nature. 2006; 444: 941-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). On the other hand QS11 is a cell permeable purine derivative that can increase endogenous ARF1-GTP and ARF6-GTP levels in cells by inhibiting ARF GAP activity (16Zhang Q. Major M.B. Takanashi S. Camp N.D. Nishiya N. Peters E.C. Ginsberg M.H. Jian X. Randazzo P.A. Schultz P.G. Moon R.T. Ding S. Small-molecule synergist of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cytohesins 1–3 translocate from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane in a PI3K-dependent manner, where they activate ARF6 (6Ascoli M. Fanelli F. Segaloff D.L.

It is well established that the agonist-induced internalization of LHCGR and several other GPCRs requires ARF6-regulated recruitment and/or activation of several proteins, implicating ARF6 as the central regulator of receptor internalization (11Hunzicker-Dunn M.

However, the mechanisms by which ARF6 regulate agonist-induced GPCR internalization remain incompletely understood. Here we investigated the molecular details by which ARF6 regulates agonist-induced HLHCGR internalization using various pharmacological inhibitors and genetic mutants. Our studies demonstrate the activation of ARF6 by agonist-occupied HLHCGR through Gβγ, PI3K, and cytohesin ARF GEFs, and the involvement of activated ARF6 in HCG-induced HLHCGR internalization through PIP2, clathrin, NM21-H1, and dynamin. In addition we demonstrate a direct relationship between the expression of cell surface HLHCGR and the extent of cAMP signaling.

Briefly, cells serum starved and treated with inhibitors as mentioned above were incubated with an anti-Myc mouse monoclonal antibody for 1 h at 4 °C, stimulated with HCG 10 IU/ml in presence or absence of the inhibitors at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were fixed with 3.7% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 30 min, permeabilized using 0.2% Triton X-100, blocked with 1% BSA and then incubated with fluorescence-tagged anti-mouse IgG for 1 h. The cells were mounted on slides with mounting solution (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 10% mowiol, and 50% glycerol, containing 2.5% DABCO (1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2.]octane), and immunofluorescent staining was visualized using a Leica confocal microscope with a 63× oil immersion lens. The cells were serum starved for 2 h and incubated with 0.25 mm concentration of phosphodiesterase inhibitor Ro 201724 at 37 °C for 15 min. The cells were then stimulated with HCG 10 IU/ml for 30 min 37 °C. Where indicated, cells were incubated with the inhibitors for indicated time at 37 °C prior to stimulation with HCG. cAMP levels were then determined as previously described (24Lawrence J.

ARF6 activation was assessed by using the GST-GGA3 PBD (amino acids 1–316) pulldown assay as described previously (25Venkateswarlu K.

The transfected cells stimulated without or with HCG 10 IU/ml for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of or absence of inhibitor were lysed using ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 10 mm MgCl2) with 1% protease inhibitors mix. The cell lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads coupled to 50 μg of purified GST-GGA3 PBD fusion protein at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed three times with the wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100). The lysates that not incubated with the beads were used as an input controls. ARF6- or ARF1-GTP bound to the beads and total ARF1 or ARF6 in the inputs were determined by immunoblotting using an anti-ARF6 or an anti-ARF1 antibody. Immunoblots were scanned and the GTP-bound ARF6 precipitated with GST-GGA3 PBD beads was normalized to total ARF6 levels in the lysates to compare ARF6-GTP levels in different conditions. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto PVDF membrane and immunoblotted using primary antibody and the HRP-conjugated secondary antibody as described previously (29Venkateswarlu K. Analysis of the interaction between cytohesin 2 and IPCEF1.Methods Enzymol. 2005; 404: 252-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Image-J program was used for densitometric analysis. Data were analyzed by using the GraphPAD Prism program. Unless indicated otherwise, results were expressed as the mean ± S.E. of three experiments. The confocal images shown in the figures are representative of three different cell preparations. We transiently transfected HEK293 cells with HLHCGR containing an N-terminal Myc epitope tag (HEK-HCGLHR cells) and first assessed by ELISA both the concentration- and time-dependence of HCG-induced HLHCGR internalization. When added to the cells for 30 min, HCG induced receptor internalization with an EC50 of ∼8 IU/ml and a maximum of ∼45% receptor internalization being observed at 100–1000 IU/ml of the agonist (supplemental Fig. S1A). Addition of 10 IU/ml of HCG to the cells led to time-dependent internalization of HLHCGR (supplemental Fig. S1A) with maximum HLHCGR internalization being observed 30–60 min after agonist addition. Immunofluorescence of HEK-HCGLHR cells confirmed the agonist-dependent internalization of HLHCGR. HCG caused a decrease in cell surface expression of HLHCGR and concomitant increase in intracellular bright punctuate spots, indicating internalization of the receptor (supplemental Fig. S1B). We next assessed the concentration and time dependence of agonist-induced cAMP production in HEK-HCGLHR cells. The EC50 value for HCG-induced cAMP accumulation was 5.1 IU/ml and a maximum 6-fold over basal increase in cAMP accumulation being observed for HCG at 100–1000 IU/ml for 30 min and 10 IU/ml for 60 min (supplemental Fig. S1C). Unless otherwise indicated, a standard agonist treatment of 10 IU/ml of HCG for 30 min was used in further experiments. To understand the role of ARF6 in HCG-induced internalization of HCGLHR, we first analyzed the effect of down-regulation of ARF6 and ARF1 on agonist-induced HLHCGR, using previously validated ARF6 and ARF1 siRNAs (27Volpicelli-Daley L.A. Li Y. Zhang C.J. Kahn R.A. Isoform-selective effects of the depletion of ADP-ribosylation factors 1–5 on membrane traffic.Mol. Biol.

Requirement for Arf6 in breast cancer invasive activities.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 6647-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The efficiency of down-regulation of ARF6 and ARF1 protein expression in the cells transfected with ARF6 and ARF1 siRNAs, respectively, is shown in Fig. 1A. ARF6 expression was significantly depleted (∼80%) in the cells transfected with ARF6 siRNA but not in either ARF1 siRNA or universal negative control siRNA-treated cells. Similarly ARF1 expression was considerably reduced (∼90%) in ARF1 siRNA treated but not in ARF6 or negative control siRNA-transfected cells. Depletion of ARF1 or ARF6 had no affect on cell surface expression of HLHCGR in unstimulated cells, as assessed by ELISA (data not shown). However, depletion of ARF6 but not ARF1 significantly inhibited HCG-induced HLHCGR internalization (∼10% cell surface receptor loss in ARF6 siRNA-transfected cells compared with ∼30% in control or ARF1 siRNA-transfected cells) (Fig. 1B). This was further confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 1C). Agonist-induced HLHCGR internalization, as evident by punctuate staining in the cytosol, was markedly reduced in cells transfected with ARF6 siRNA but not ARF1 siRNA. Next, we investigated the effect of ARF1 or ARF6 depletion on HCG-induced HLHCGR activation by measuring cAMP accumulation (Fig. 1D). Basal cAMP levels (12.7 ± 1.8 pmol of cAMP per mg protein) were not affected by depletion of ARF1 (12.4 ± 2.2 pmol of cAMP per mg protein) or ARF6 siRNA (13.1 ± 1.2 pmol of cAMP per mg protein). However, HCG-stimulated cAMP accumulation was greater (8.3 ± 0.5-fold over basal) in ARF6 siRNA- transfected HEK-HLHCGR cells but not ARF1 siRNA (3.5 ± 0.2-fold over basal) or control siRNA (3.4 ± 0.3-fold over basal) transfected cells. These results confirm the role of ARF6 in agonist-induced HLHCGR internalization and signaling. The N-myristoylated ARF1 (Myr-ARF1; composed of 2–17aa of ARF1) and ARF6 (Myr-ARF6; consists of 2–13 aa of ARF6) peptides have previously been shown to inhibit the functions of ARF1 and ARF6, respectively (27Volpicelli-Daley L.A.

Specific mechanisms to protect and repair DNA lesions produced by ROS have been developed in living beings. In Escherichia coli the SOS system, an inducible response activated to rescue cells from severe DNA damage, is a network that regulates the expression of more than 40 genes in response to this damage, many of them playing important roles in DNA damage tolerance mechanisms. Although the function of most of these genes has been elucidated, the activity of some others, such as dinF, remains unknown. The DinF deduced polypeptide sequence shows a high homology with membrane proteins of the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family. We describe here that expression of dinF protects against bile salts, probably by decreasing the effects of ROS, which is consistent with the observed decrease in H(2)O(2)-killing and protein carbonylation. These results, together with its ability to decrease the level of intracellular ROS, suggests that DinF can detoxify, either direct or indirectly, oxidizing molecules that can damage DNA and proteins from both the bacterial metabolism and the environment. Although the exact mechanism of DinF activity remains to be identified, we describe for the first time a role for dinF."
https://openalex.org/W2058104035,"Mitotic phosphorylation of the conserved GRASP domain of GRASP65 disrupts its self-association, leading to a loss of Golgi membrane tethering, cisternal unlinking, and Golgi breakdown. Recently, the structural basis of the GRASP self-interaction was determined, yet the mechanism by which phosphorylation disrupts this activity is unknown. Here, we present the crystal structure of a GRASP phosphomimic containing an aspartic acid substitution for a serine residue (Ser-189) that in GRASP65 is phosphorylated by PLK1, causing a block in membrane tethering and Golgi ribbon formation. The structure revealed a conformational change in the GRASP internal ligand that prevented its insertion into the PDZ binding pocket, and gel filtration assays showed that this phosphomimic mutant exhibited a significant reduction in dimer formation. Interestingly, the structure also revealed an apparent propagation of conformational change from the site of phosphorylation to the shifted ligand, and alanine substitution of two residues (Glu-145 and Ser-146) at penultimate positions in this chain rescued dimer formation by the phosphomimic. These data reveal the structural basis of the phosphoinhibition of GRASP-mediated membrane tethering and provide a mechanism for its allosteric regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2021627129,"In this study, we have demonstrated that Korean Panax ginseng (KG) significantly enhances myelopoiesis in vitro and reconstitutes bone marrow after 5-flurouracil-induced (5FU) myelosuppression in mice. KG promoted total white blood cell, lymphocyte, neutrophil and platelet counts and improved body weight, spleen weight, and thymus weight. The number of CFU-GM in bone marrow cells of mice and serum levels of IL-3 and GM-CSF were significantly improved after KG treatment. KG induced significant c-Kit, SCF and IL-1 mRNA expression in spleen. Moreover, treatment with KG led to marked improvements in 5FU-induced histopathological changes in bone marrow and spleen, and partial suppression of thymus damage. The levels of IL-3 and GM-CSF in cultured bone marrow cells after 24 h stimulation with KG were considerably increased. The mechanism underlying promotion of myelopoiesis by KG was assessed by monitoring gene expression at two time-points of 4 and 8 h. Treatment with Rg1 (0.5, 1 and 1.5 µmol) specifically enhanced c-Kit, IL-6 and TNF-α mRNA expression in cultured bone marrow cells. Our results collectively suggest that the anti-myelotoxicity activity and promotion of myelopoiesis by KG are mediated through cytokines. Moreover, the ginsenoside, Rg1, supports the role of KG in myelopoiesis to some extent."
https://openalex.org/W2071935311,"Dual Oxidases (DUOX) 1 and 2 are efficiently expressed in thyroid, gut, lung and immune system. The function and the regulation of these enzymes in mammals are still largely unknown. We report here that DUOX 1 and 2 are expressed in human neuroblastoma SK-N-BE cells as well as in a human oligodendrocyte cell line (MO3-13) and in rat brain and they are induced by platelet derived growth factor (PDGF). The levels of DUOX 1 and 2 proteins and mRNAs are induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by the membrane NADPH oxidase. As to the mechanism, we find that PDGF stimulates membrane NADPH oxidase to produce ROS, which stabilize DUOX1 and 2 mRNAs and increases the levels of the proteins. Silencing of gp91(phox) (NOX2), or of the other membrane subunit of NADPH oxidase, p22(phox), blocks PDGF induction of DUOX1 and 2. These data unravel a novel mechanism of regulation of DUOX enzymes by ROS and identify a circuitry linking NADPH oxidase activity to DUOX1 and 2 levels in neuroblastoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2039336603,"Mutualisms often involve one host supporting multiple symbionts, whose identity, density and intraguild interactions can influence the nature of the mutualism and performance of the host. However, the implications of multiple co-occurring symbionts on services to a host have rarely been quantified. In this study, we quantified effects of decapod symbionts on removal of sediment from their coral host. Our field survey showed that all common symbionts typically occur as pairs and never at greater abundances. Two species, the crab Trapezia serenei and the shrimp Alpheus lottini, were most common and co-occurred more often than expected by chance. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to test for effects of decapod identity and density on sediment removal. Alone, corals removed 10% of sediment, but removal increased to 30% and 48% with the presence of two and four symbionts, respectively. Per-capita effects of symbionts were independent of density and identity. Our results suggest that symbiont density is restricted by intraspecific competition. Thus, increased sediment removal from a coral host can only be achieved by increasing the number of species of symbionts on that coral, even though these species are functionally equivalent. Symbiont diversity plays a key role, not through added functionality but by overcoming density limitation likely imposed by intraspecific mating systems."
https://openalex.org/W2054855899,"SRY is a sex-determining gene that encodes a transcription factor, which triggers male development in most mammals. The molecular mechanism of SRY action in testis determination is, however, poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that WDR5, which encodes a WD-40 repeat protein, is a direct target of SRY. EMSA experiments and ChIP assays showed that SRY could bind to the WDR5 gene promoter directly. Overexpression of SRY in LNCaP cells significantly increased WDR5 expression concurrent with histone H3K4 methylation on the WDR5 promoter. To specifically address whether SRY contributes to WDR5 regulation, we introduced a 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen-inducible SRY allele into LNCaP cells. Conditional SRY expression triggered enrichment of SRY on the WDR5 promoter resulting in induction of WDR5 transcription. We found that WDR5 was self regulating through a positive feedback loop. WDR5 and SRY interacted and were colocalized in cells. In addition, the interaction of WDR5 with SRY resulted in activation of Sox9 while repressing the expression of β-catenin. These results suggest that, in conjunction with SRY, WDR5 plays an important role in sex determination."

https://openalex.org/W2029362010,"Modulation of cerebral Rho GTPases activity in mice brain by intracerebral administration of Cytotoxic Necrotizing Factor 1 (CNF1) leads to enhanced neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity and improves learning and memory. To gain more insight into the interactions between CNF1 and neuronal cells, we used primary neuronal and astrocytic cultures from rat embryonic brain to study CNF1 effects on neuronal differentiation, focusing on dendritic tree growth and synapse formation, which are strictly modulated by Rho GTPases. CNF1 profoundly remodeled the cytoskeleton of hippocampal and cortical neurons, which showed philopodia-like, actin-positive projections, thickened and poorly branched dendrites, and a decrease in synapse number. CNF1 removal, however, restored dendritic tree development and synapse formation, suggesting that the toxin can reversibly block neuronal differentiation. On differentiated neurons, CNF1 had a similar effacing effect on synapses. Therefore, a direct interaction with CNF1 is apparently deleterious for neurons. Since astrocytes play a pivotal role in neuronal differentiation and synaptic regulation, we wondered if the beneficial in vivo effect could be mediated by astrocytes. Primary astrocytes from embryonic cortex were treated with CNF1 for 48 hours and used as a substrate for growing hippocampal neurons. Such neurons showed an increased development of neurites, in respect to age-matched controls, with a wider dendritic tree and a richer content in synapses. In CNF1-exposed astrocytes, the production of interleukin 1β, known to reduce dendrite development and complexity in neuronal cultures, was decreased. These results demonstrate that astrocytes, under the influence of CNF1, increase their supporting activity on neuronal growth and differentiation, possibly related to the diminished levels of interleukin 1β. These observations suggest that the enhanced synaptic plasticity and improved learning and memory described in CNF1-injected mice are probably mediated by astrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2053582854,"Oxidative stress plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of cardiac failure, including the modulation of neovascularization following myocardial infarction (MI). Redox molecules thioredoxin (Trx) and glutaredoxin (Grx) superfamilies actively maintain intracellular thiol-redox homeostasis by scavenging reactive oxygen species. Among these two superfamilies, the pro-angiogenic function of Trx-1 has been reported in chronic MI model whereas similar role of Grx-1 remains uncertain. The present study attempts to establish the role of Grx-1 in neovascularization and ventricular remodeling following MI. Wild-type (WT) and Grx-1 transgenic (Grx-1Tg/+) mice were randomized into wild-type sham (WTS), Grx-1Tg/+ Sham (Grx-1Tg/+S), WTMI, Grx-1Tg/+MI. MI was induced by permanent occlusion of the LAD coronary artery. Sham groups underwent identical time-matched surgical procedures without LAD ligation. Significant increase in arteriolar density was observed 7 days (d) after surgical intervention in the Grx-1Tg/+MI group as compared to the WTMI animals. Further, improvement in myocardial functional parameters 30 d after MI was observed including decreased LVIDs, LVIDd, increased ejection fraction and, fractional shortening was also observed in the Grx-1Tg/+MI group as compared to the WTMI animals. Moreover, attenuation of oxidative stress and apoptotic cardiomyocytes was observed in the Grx-1Tg/+MI group as compared to the WTMI animals. Increased expression of p-Akt, VEGF, Ang-1, Bcl-2, survivin and DNA binding activity of NF-κB were observed in the Grx-1Tg/+MI group when compared to WTMI animals as revealed by Western blot analysis and Gel-shift analysis, respectively. These results are the first to demonstrate that Grx-1 induces angiogenesis and diminishes ventricular remodeling apparently through neovascularization mediated by Akt, VEGF, Ang-1 and NF-κB as well as Bcl-2 and survivin-mediated anti-apoptotic pathway in the infarcted myocardium."
https://openalex.org/W2009596768,"Despite the public health importance of Salmonella infection in pigs, little is known about the associated dynamics of fecal shedding and immunity. In this study, we investigated the transitions of pigs through the states of Salmonella fecal shedding and immune response post-Salmonella inoculation as affected by the challenge dose and serotype. Continuous-time multistate Markov models were developed using published experimental data. The model for shedding had four transient states, of which two were shedding (continuous and intermittent shedding) and two non-shedding (latency and intermittent non-shedding), and one absorbing state representing permanent cessation of shedding. The immune response model had two transient states representing responses below and above the seroconversion level. The effects of two doses [low (0.65×106 CFU/pig) and high (0.65×109 CFU/pig)] and four serotypes (Salmonella Yoruba, Salmonella Cubana, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Salmonella Derby) on the models' transition intensities were evaluated using a proportional intensities model. Results indicated statistically significant effects of the challenge dose and serotype on the dynamics of shedding and immune response. The time spent in the specific states was also estimated. Continuous shedding was on average 10–26 days longer, while intermittent non-shedding was 2–4 days shorter, in pigs challenged with the high compared to low dose. Interestingly, among pigs challenged with the high dose, the continuous and intermittent shedding states were on average up to 10–17 and 3–4 days longer, respectively, in pigs infected with S. Cubana compared to the other three serotypes. Pigs challenged with the high dose of S. Typhimurium or S. Derby seroconverted on average up to 8–11 days faster compared to the low dose. These findings highlight that Salmonella fecal shedding and immune response following Salmonella challenge are dose- and serotype-dependent and that the detection of specific Salmonella strains and immune responses in pigs are time-sensitive."
https://openalex.org/W2023520801,"The population of pyramidal cells significantly outnumbers the inhibitory interneurons in the neocortex, while at the same time the diversity of interneuron types is much more pronounced. One acknowledged key role of inhibition is to control the rate and patterning of pyramidal cell firing via negative feedback, but most likely the diversity of inhibitory pathways is matched by a corresponding diversity of functional roles. An important distinguishing feature of cortical interneurons is the variability of the short-term plasticity properties of synapses received from pyramidal cells. The Martinotti cell type has recently come under scrutiny due to the distinctly facilitating nature of the synapses they receive from pyramidal cells. This distinguishes these neurons from basket cells and other inhibitory interneurons typically targeted by depressing synapses. A key aspect of the work reported here has been to pinpoint the role of this variability. We first set out to reproduce quantitatively based on in vitro data the di-synaptic inhibitory microcircuit connecting two pyramidal cells via one or a few Martinotti cells. In a second step, we embedded this microcircuit in a previously developed attractor memory network model of neocortical layers 2/3. This model network demonstrated that basket cells with their characteristic depressing synapses are the first to discharge when the network enters an attractor state and that Martinotti cells respond with a delay, thereby shifting the excitation-inhibition balance and acting to terminate the attractor state. A parameter sensitivity analysis suggested that Martinotti cells might, in fact, play a dominant role in setting the attractor dwell time and thus cortical speed of processing, with cellular adaptation and synaptic depression having a less prominent role than previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W2038292812,"Two-step BK channel inactivation mediated by an intrinsically disordered BK β-subunit peptide involves a stereospecific binding interaction that precedes blockade. After K+ ion channels open, they frequently 'inactivate' when a cytosolic segment of the channel moves into a position that can physically occlude ion permeation through the channel pore. This study shows that a specific intrinsically disordered peptide domain of an ion-channel subunit of the Ca2+-activated BK channel produces its functional effects through stereospecific binding. The BK β3a auxiliary subunit peptide inactivates the associated BK channel only when it is composed of L-amino acids, and not D-amino acids. This means that the two-step inactivation process requires that a stereospecific-binding event — not just simple steric occlusion of the pore — must occur if the auxiliary subunit is to block the channel. A number of functionally important actions of proteins are mediated by short, intrinsically disordered peptide segments1, but the molecular interactions that allow disordered domains to mediate their effects remain a topic of active investigation2,3,4,5. Many K+ channel proteins, after initial channel opening, show a time-dependent reduction in current flux, termed ‘inactivation’, which involves movement of mobile cytosolic peptide segments (approximately 20–30 residues) into a position that physically occludes ion permeation6,7,8. Peptide segments that produce inactivation show little amino-acid identity6,9,10,11,12,13 and tolerate appreciable mutational substitutions13 without disrupting the inactivation process. Solution nuclear magnetic resonance of several isolated inactivation domains reveals substantial conformational heterogeneity with only minimal tendency to ordered structures14,15,16,17. Channel inactivation mechanisms may therefore help us to decipher how intrinsically disordered regions mediate functional effects. Whereas many aspects of inactivation of voltage-dependent K+ channels (Kv) can be described by a simple one-step occlusion mechanism6,7,18,19, inactivation of the voltage-dependent large-conductance Ca2+-gated K+ (BK) channel mediated by peptide segments of auxiliary β-subunits involves two distinguishable kinetic steps20,21. Here we show that two-step inactivation mediated by an intrinsically disordered BK β-subunit peptide involves a stereospecific binding interaction that precedes blockade. In contrast, blocking mediated by a Shaker Kv inactivation peptide is consistent with direct, simple occlusion by a hydrophobic segment without substantial steric requirement. The results indicate that two distinct types of molecular interaction between disordered peptide segments and their binding sites produce qualitatively similar functions."
https://openalex.org/W2015875785,"16p13.11 genomic copy number variants are implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, autism, mental retardation, ADHD and epilepsy. The mechanisms leading to the diverse clinical manifestations of deletions and duplications at this locus are unknown. Most studies favour NDE1 as the leading disease-causing candidate gene at 16p13.11. In epilepsy at least, the deletion does not appear to unmask recessive-acting mutations in NDE1, with haploinsufficiency and genetic modifiers being prime candidate disease mechanisms. NDE1 encodes a protein critical to cell positioning during cortical development. As a first step, it is important to determine whether 16p13.11 copy number change translates to detectable brain structural alteration. We undertook detailed neuropathology on surgically resected brain tissue of two patients with intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), who had the same heterozygous NDE1-containing 800 kb 16p13.11 deletion, using routine histological stains and immunohistochemical markers against a range of layer-specific, white matter, neural precursor and migratory cell proteins, and NDE1 itself. Surgical temporal lobectomy samples from a MTLE case known not to have a deletion in NDE1 and three non-epilepsy cases were included as disease controls. We found that apart from a 3 mm hamartia in the temporal cortex of one MTLE case with NDE1 deletion and known hippocampal sclerosis in the other case, cortical lamination and cytoarchitecture were normal, with no differences between cases with deletion and disease controls. How 16p13.11 copy changes lead to a variety of brain diseases remains unclear, but at least in epilepsy, it would not seem to be through structural abnormality or dyslamination as judged by microscopy or immunohistochemistry. The need to integrate additional data with genetic findings to determine their significance will become more pressing as genetic technologies generate increasingly rich datasets. Detailed examination of brain tissue, where available, will be an important part of this process in neurogenetic disease specifically."
https://openalex.org/W2066757553,"Prevention of re-replication via negative regulation of replication initiator proteins, such as CDC6, is key to maintenance of genomic integrity, whereas their up-regulation is generally associated with perturbation in cell cycle, genomic instability, and potentially, tumorigenesis. The HBx oncoprotein of hepatitis B virus is well known to deregulate cell cycle and has been intricately linked to development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite a clear understanding of the proliferative effects of HBx on cell cycle, a mechanistic link between HBx-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis and host cell DNA replication remains poorly perused. Here we show that HBx overexpression in both the cellular as well as the transgenic environment resulted in the accumulation of CDC6 through transcriptional and post-translational up-regulation. The HBx-mediated increase in CDK2 activity altered the E2F1-Rb (retinoblastoma) balance, which favored CDC6 gene expression by E2F1. Besides, HBx impaired the APC(Cdh1)-dependent protein degradation pathway and conferred intracellular stability to CDC6 protein. Increase in CDC6 levels correlated with increase in CDC6 occupancy on the β-globin origin of replication, suggesting increment in origin licensing and re-replication. In conclusion, our findings strongly suggest a novel role for CDC6 in abetting the oncogenic sabotage carried out by HBx and support the paradigm that pre-replicative complex proteins have a role in oncogenic transformation."

The data reveal that a previously identified charge-sensitive loop near the putative active site of FKBP38 is mainly responsible for Bcl-2 binding. The corresponding binding epitope of Bcl-2 could be identified via a peptide library-based membrane assay. Site-directed mutagenesis of the key residues verified the contact sites of this electrostatic protein/protein interaction. The derived structure model of the complex between Bcl-2 and the FKBP38 catalytic domain features both electrostatic and hydrophobic intermolecular contacts and provides a rationale for the regulation of the FKBP38/Bcl-2 interaction by Ca2+.

https://openalex.org/W2023483027,The inaccuracy of copy number variation (CNV) detection on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays has recently been brought to attention. Such high error rates will undoubtedly have ramifications on downstream association testing. We examined this effect for a wide range of scenarios and found a noticeable decrease in power for error rates typical of CNV calling algorithms. We compared power using CNV calls to the log relative ratio and found the latter to be superior when error rates are moderate to large or when the CNV size is small. It is our recommendation that CNV researchers use intensity measurements as an alternative to CNV calls in these scenarios.
https://openalex.org/W1975801479,"Ligand-independent constitutively active gp130 mutants were described to be responsible for the development of inflammatory hepatocellular adenomas (IHCAs). These variants had gain-of-function somatic mutations within the extracellular domain 2 (D2) of the gp130 receptor chain. Cytokine-dependent Ba/F3 cells were transduced with the constitutively active variant of gp130 featuring a deletion in the domain 2 from Tyr-186 to Tyr-190 (gp130ΔYY). These cells showed constitutive phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) and cytokine-independent proliferation. Deletion of the Ig-like domain 1 (D1) of gp130, but not anti-gp130 mAbs directed against D1, abolished constitutive activation of gp130ΔYY, highlighting that this domain is involved in ligand-independent activation of gp130ΔYY. Moreover, soluble variants of gp130 were not able to inhibit the constitutive activation of gp130ΔYY. However, the inhibition of constitutive activation of gp130ΔYY was achieved by the anti-gp130 mAb B-P4, which specifically inhibits gp130 signaling by IL-11 but not by other IL-6 type cytokines. IL-11 but not IL-6 levels were found previously to be up-regulated in IHCAs, suggesting that mutations in gp130 are leading to IL-11-like signaling. The mAb B-P4 might be a valuable tool to inhibit the constitutive activation of naturally occurring gp130 mutants in IHCAs and rare cases of gp130-associated hepatocellular carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2021414074,"In neurons, a highly regulated microtubule cytoskeleton is essential for many cellular functions. These include axonal transport, regional specialization and synaptic function. Given the critical roles of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) in maintaining and regulating microtubule stability and dynamics, we sought to understand how this regulation is achieved. Here, we identify a novel LisH/WD40 repeat protein, tentatively named nemitin (neuronal enriched MAP interacting protein), as a potential regulator of MAP8-associated microtubule function. Based on expression at both the mRNA and protein levels, nemitin is enriched in the nervous system. Its protein expression is detected as early as embryonic day 11 and continues through adulthood. Interestingly, when expressed in non-neuronal cells, nemitin displays a diffuse pattern with puncta, although at the ultrastructural level it localizes along the microtubule network in vivo in sciatic nerves. These results suggest that the association of nemitin to microtubules may require an intermediary protein. Indeed, co-expression of nemitin with microtubule-associated protein 8 (MAP8) results in nemitin losing its diffuse pattern, instead decorating microtubules uniformly along with MAP8. Together, these results imply that nemitin may play an important role in regulating the neuronal cytoskeleton through an interaction with MAP8."
https://openalex.org/W2069619650,"Muscle elasticity strongly relies on the mechanical anchoring of the giant protein titin to both the sarcomere M-band and the Z-disk. Such strong attachment ensures the reversible dynamics of the stretching-relaxing cycles determining the muscle passive elasticity. Similarly, the design of biomaterials with enhanced elastic function requires experimental strategies able to secure the constituent molecules to avoid mechanical failure. Here we show that an engineered titin-mimicking protein is able to spontaneously dimerize in solution. Our observations reveal that the titin Z1Z2 domains are key to induce dimerization over a long-range distance in proteins that would otherwise remain in their monomeric form. Using single molecule force spectroscopy, we measure the threshold force that triggers the noncovalent transition from protein dimer to monomer, occurring at ∼700 piconewtons. Such extremely high mechanical stability is likely to be a natural protective mechanism that guarantees muscle integrity. We propose a simple molecular model to understand the force-induced dimer-to-monomer transition based on the geometric distribution of forces occurring within a dimeric protein under mechanical tension.

https://openalex.org/W2091837531,"The endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) is a cellular quality control mechanism to dispose of misfolded proteins of the secretory pathway via proteasomal degradation. SEL1L is an ER-resident protein that participates in identification of misfolded molecules as ERAD substrates, therefore inducing their ER-to-cytosol retrotranslocation and degradation. We have developed a novel class of fusion proteins, termed degradins, composed of a fragment of SEL1L fused to a target-specific binding moiety located on the luminal side of the ER. The target-binding moiety can be a ligand of the target or derived from specific mAbs. Here, we describe the ability of degradins with two different recognition moieties to promote degradation of a model target. Degradins recognize the target protein within the ER both in secretory and membrane-bound forms, inducing their degradation following retrotranslocation to the cytosol. Thus, degradins represent an effective technique to knock-out proteins within the secretory pathway with high specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2041241212,"Micro-anatomical structures in tissues have potential physiological effects. In arteries and arterioles smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells are separated by the internal elastic lamina, but the two cell layers often make contact through micro protrusions called myoendothelial junctions. Cross talk between the two cell layers is important in regulating blood pressure and flow. We have used a spatiotemporal mathematical model to investigate how the myoendothelial junctions affect the information flow between the two cell layers. The geometry of the model mimics the structure of the two cell types and the myoendothelial junction. The model is implemented as a 2D axi-symmetrical model and solved using the finite element method. We have simulated diffusion of Ca2+ and IP3 between the two cell types and we show that the micro-anatomical structure of the myoendothelial junction in itself may rectify a signal between the two cell layers. The rectification is caused by the asymmetrical structure of the myoendothelial junction. Because the head of the myoendothelial junction is separated from the cell it is attached to by a narrow neck region, a signal generated in the neighboring cell can easily drive a concentration change in the head of the myoendothelial protrusion. Subsequently the signal can be amplified in the head, and activate the entire cell. In contrast, a signal in the cell from which the myoendothelial junction originates will be attenuated and delayed in the neck region as it travels into the head of the myoendothelial junction and the neighboring cell."
https://openalex.org/W2012911086,"Background As low pathogenic avian influenza viruses can mutate into high pathogenic viruses the Dutch poultry sector implemented a surveillance system for low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) based on blood samples. It has been suggested that egg yolk samples could be sampled instead of blood samples to survey egg layer farms. To support future decision making about AI surveillance economic criteria are important. Therefore a cost analysis is performed on systems that use either blood or eggs as sampled material. Methodology/Principal Findings The effectiveness of surveillance using egg or blood samples was evaluated using scenario tree models. Then an economic model was developed that calculates the total costs for eight surveillance systems that have equal effectiveness. The model considers costs for sampling, sample preparation, sample transport, testing, communication of test results and for the confirmation test on false positive results. The surveillance systems varied in sampled material (eggs or blood), sampling location (farm or packing station) and location of sample preparation (laboratory or packing station). It is shown that a hypothetical system in which eggs are sampled at the packing station and samples prepared in a laboratory had the lowest total costs (i.e. € 273,393) a year. Compared to this a hypothetical system in which eggs are sampled at the farm and samples prepared at a laboratory, and the currently implemented system in which blood is sampled at the farm and samples prepared at a laboratory have 6% and 39% higher costs respectively. Conclusions/Significance This study shows that surveillance for avian influenza on egg yolk samples can be done at lower costs than surveillance based on blood samples. The model can be used in future comparison of surveillance systems for different pathogens and hazards."
https://openalex.org/W2029491270,"The Rap1-GTP interacting adapter protein (RIAM) is an important protein in Rap1-mediated integrin activation. By binding to both Rap1 GTPase and talin, RIAM recruits talin to the cell membrane, thus facilitating talin-dependent integrin activation. In this article, we studied the role of the RIAM Ras-association (RA) and pleckstrin-homology (PH) domains in the interaction with Rap1. We found that the RA domain was sufficient for GTP-dependent interaction with Rap1B, and the addition of the PH domain did not change the binding affinity. We also detected GTP-independent interaction of Rap1B with the N-terminus of RIAM. In addition, we found that the PH domain stabilized the RA domain both in vitro and in cells."
https://openalex.org/W2007252527,"Background Fluctuating asymmetry is a contentious indicator of stress in populations of animals and plants. Nevertheless, it is a measure of developmental noise, typically obtained by measuring asymmetry across an individual organism's left-right axis of symmetry. These individual, signed asymmetries are symmetrically distributed around a mean of zero. Fluctuating asymmetry, however, has rarely been studied in microorganisms, and never in fungi. Objective and Methods We examined colony growth and random phenotypic variation of five soil microfungal species isolated from the opposing slopes of “Evolution Canyon,” Mount Carmel, Israel. This canyon provides an opportunity to study diverse taxa inhabiting a single microsite, under different kinds and intensities of abiotic and biotic stress. The south-facing “African” slope of “Evolution Canyon” is xeric, warm, and tropical. It is only 200 m, on average, from the north-facing “European” slope, which is mesic, cool, and temperate. Five fungal species inhabiting both the south-facing “African” slope, and the north-facing “European” slope of the canyon were grown under controlled laboratory conditions, where we measured the fluctuating radial asymmetry and sizes of their colonies. Results Different species displayed different amounts of radial asymmetry (and colony size). Moreover, there were highly significant slope by species interactions for size, and marginally significant ones for fluctuating asymmetry. There were no universal differences (i.e., across all species) in radial asymmetry and colony size between strains from “African” and “European” slopes, but colonies of Clonostachys rosea from the “African” slope were more asymmetric than those from the “European” slope. Conclusions and Significance Our study suggests that fluctuating radial asymmetry has potential as an indicator of random phenotypic variation and stress in soil microfungi. Interaction of slope and species for both growth rate and asymmetry of microfungi in a common environment is evidence of genetic differences between the “African” and “European” slopes of “Evolution Canyon.”"
https://openalex.org/W2077625166,"Electrical signaling allows communication within and between different tissues and is necessary for the survival of multicellular organisms. The ionic transport that underlies transmembrane currents in cells is mediated by transporters and channels. Fast ionic transport through channels is typically modeled with a conductance-based formulation that describes current in terms of electrical drift without diffusion. In contrast, currents written in terms of drift and diffusion are not as widely used in the literature in spite of being more realistic and capable of displaying experimentally observable phenomena that conductance-based models cannot reproduce (e.g. rectification). The two formulations are mathematically related: conductance-based currents are linear approximations of drift-diffusion currents. However, conductance-based models of membrane potential are not first-order approximations of drift-diffusion models. Bifurcation analysis and numerical simulations show that the two approaches predict qualitatively and quantitatively different behaviors in the dynamics of membrane potential. For instance, two neuronal membrane models with identical populations of ion channels, one written with conductance-based currents, the other with drift-diffusion currents, undergo transitions into and out of repetitive oscillations through different mechanisms and for different levels of stimulation. These differences in excitability are observed in response to excitatory synaptic input, and across different levels of ion channel expression. In general, the electrophysiological profiles of membranes modeled with drift-diffusion and conductance-based models having identical ion channel populations are different, potentially causing the input-output and computational properties of networks constructed with these models to be different as well. The drift-diffusion formulation is thus proposed as a theoretical improvement over conductance-based models that may lead to more accurate predictions and interpretations of experimental data at the single cell and network levels."
https://openalex.org/W2041792137,"Avastin® (bevacizumab) is a protein drug widely used for cancer treatment although its further use is questionable due to serious side effects reported. As no systematic proteomic study on posttranslational modifications (PTMs) was reported so far, it was the aim of the current study to use a gel-based proteomics method for determination of Avastin®-protein(s). Avastin® was run on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), spots were picked, followed by multi-enzyme in-gel digestion. Subsequently, the resulting peptides and posttranslational modifications were identified by mass spectrometry (nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS; HCT and LTQ Orbitrap MS). Heavy and light chains were observed and the 9 spots that were picked from 2DE-gels were identified as bevacizumab with high sequence coverage. MS/MS results showed multiple tyrosine nitrations on the Avastin® light and heavy chains that were either represented as nitrotyrosine or as aminotyrosine, which was shown to be generated from nitrotyrosine under reducing conditions. Protein nitration is known to significantly change protein functions and interactions and it may well be that some of the adverse effects of the protein drug Avastin® may be due to this PTM, which may have been generated during production--thus, nitration of Avastin® is a challenge for the pharmaceutical industry."
https://openalex.org/W2046051738,"Effects of mechanical over-loading on the characteristics of regenerating or normal soleus muscle fibers were studied in dystrophin-deficient (mdx) and wild type (WT) mice. Damage was also induced in WT mice by injection of cardiotoxin (CTX) into soleus muscle. Over-loading was applied for 14 days to the left soleus muscle in mdx and intact and CTX-injected WT mouse muscles by ablation of the distal tendons of plantaris and gastrocnemius muscles. All of the myonuclei in normal muscle of WT mice were distributed at the peripheral region. But, central myonuclei were noted in all fibers of WT mice regenerating from CTX-injection-related injury. Further, many fibers of mdx mice possessed central myonuclei and the distribution of such fibers was increased in response to over-loading, suggesting a shift of myonuclei from peripheral to central region. Approximately 1.4% branched fibers were seen in the intact muscle of mdx mice, although these fibers were not detected in WT mice. The percentage of these fibers in mdx, not in WT, mice was increased by over-loading (∼51.2%). The fiber CSA in normal WT mice was increased by over-loading (p<0.05), but not in mdx and CTX-injected WT mice. It was suggested that compensatory hypertrophy is induced in normal muscle fibers of WT mice following functional over-loading. But, it was also indicated that muscle fibers in mdx mice are susceptible to mechanical over-loading and fiber splitting and shift of myonuclei from peripheral to central region are induced."
