https://openalex.org/W1975718597,"Within human epidermis there are two types of proliferating keratinocyte: stem cells, which have high proliferative potential, and transit-amplifying cells, which are destined to undergo terminal differentiation after a few rounds of division. We show that, in vivo, stem cells express higher levels of the alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha 3 beta 1 integrins than transit-amplifying cells and that this can be used both to determine the location of stem cells within the epidermis and to isolate them directly from the tissue. The distribution of stem cells and transit-amplifying cells is not random: patches of integrin-bright and integrin-dull cells have a specific location with respect to the epidermal-dermal junction that varies between body sites and that correlates with the distribution of S phase cells. Stem cell patterning can be recreated in culture, in the absence of dermis, and appears to be subject to autoregulation."
https://openalex.org/W2064370916,"Rat antizyme gene expression requires programmed, ribosomal frameshifting. A novel autoregulatory mechanism enables modulation of frameshifting according to the cellular concentration of polyamines. Antizyme binds to, and destabilizes, ornithine decarboxylase, a key enzyme in polyamine synthesis. Rapid degradation ensues, thus completing a regulatory circuit. In vitro experiments with a fusion construct using reticulocyte lysates demonstrate polyamine-dependent expression with a frameshift efficiency of 19% at the optimal concentration of spermidine. The frameshift is +1 and occurs at the codon just preceding the terminator of the initiating frame. Both the termination codon of the initiating frame and a pseudoknot downstream in the mRNA have a stimulatory effect. The shift site sequence, UCC-UGA-U, is not similar to other known frameshift sites. The mechanism does not seem to involve re-pairing of peptidyl-tRNA in the new frame but rather reading or occlusion of a fourth base."
https://openalex.org/W2013648875,"Inhibition of DNA synthesis induces transcription of DNA damage-inducible genes and prevents mitotic entry through the action of the S phase checkpoint. We have isolated a mutant, dun2, defective for both of these responses. DUN2 is identical to POL2, encoding DNA polymerase epsilon (pol epsilon). Unlike sad1 mutants defective for multiple cell cycle checkpoints, pol2 mutants are defective only for the S phase checkpoint and the activation of DUN1 kinase necessary for the transcriptional response to damage. Interallelic complementation and mutation analysis indicate that pol epsilon contains two separable essential domains, an N-terminal polymerase domain and a C-terminal checkpoint domain unique to epsilon polymerases. We propose that DNA pol epsilon acts as a sensor of DNA replication that coordinates the transcriptional and cell cycle responses to replication blocks."
https://openalex.org/W2087385198,"The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains a plasma membrane reductase activity associated with the gene product of the FRE1 locus. This reductase is required for Fe(III) uptake by this yeast; transcription from FRE1 is repressed by iron (Dancis, A., Klausner, R. D., Hinnebusch, A. G., and Barriocanal, J. G.(1990) Mol. Cell. Biol. 10, 2294-2301). We show here that Cu(II) is equally efficient at repressing FRE1 transcription and is an excellent substrate for the Fre1p reductase. This reductase activity is required for 50-70% of the uptake of 64Cu by wild type cells. Under conditions of low Fre1-dependent activity, cells retain 30-70% of Cu(II) reductase activity but only 8-25% of Fe(III) reductase activity. While Fre1p-dependent activity is 100% inhibitable by Pt(II), this residual Cu(II) reduction is insensitive to this inhibitor. The data suggest the presence of a Fre1p-independent reductase activity in the yeast plasma membrane which is relatively specific for Cu(II) and which supports copper uptake in the absence of FRE1 expression. The gene product of MAC1, which is required for regulation of FRE1 transcription, is also required for expression of Cu(II) reduction activity. This is due in part to its role in the regulation of FRE1; however, it is required for expression of the putative Cu(II) reductase, as well. Similarly, a gain-of-function mutation, MAC1up1, which causes elevated and unregulated transcription from FRE1 and elevated Fe(III) reduction and 59Fe uptake exhibits a similar phenotype with respect to Cu(II) reduction and 64Cu uptake. Ascorbate, which reduces periplasmic Cu(II) to Cu(I), suppresses the dependence of 64Cu uptake on plasma membrane reductase activity as is the case for ascorbate-supported 59Fe uptake. The close parallels between Cu(II) and Fe(III) reduction, and 64Cu and 59Fe uptake, strongly suggest that Cu(II) uptake by yeast involves a Cu(I) intermediate. This results in the reductive mobilization of the copper from periplasmic chelating agents, making the free ion available for translocation across the plasma membrane. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains a plasma membrane reductase activity associated with the gene product of the FRE1 locus. This reductase is required for Fe(III) uptake by this yeast; transcription from FRE1 is repressed by iron (Dancis, A., Klausner, R. D., Hinnebusch, A. G., and Barriocanal, J. G.(1990) Mol. Cell.

This results in the reductive mobilization of the copper from periplasmic chelating agents, making the free ion available for translocation across the plasma membrane. Limited detail is available about the mechanism(s) by which the essential trace nutrient copper is taken up by eukaryotic cells. Although all such cells studied in culture exhibit kinetically saturable, that is, facilitated, uptake (1.Waldrop G.L. Ettinger M.J. Am. J.

This appears to be due to the product of CTR1(4.Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Significant features of the primary structure of this protein include two to three membrane-spanning domains and 11 repeats of the Met-X2-Met sequence found also in bacterial CopA and CopB proteins. These latter proteins have known copper-handling functions(5.Cha J. Cooksey D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8915-8919Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 6.Odermatt A. Suter H.

High affinity accumulation of Fe(III) from the medium requires, first, a reduction of extracellular Fe(III) to Fe(II) (7.Lesuisse E. Raguzzi F. Crichton R.R. J. Gen.

The Fe(III) reductase activity requires, at the least, the product of the FRE1 locus(9.Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Barriocanal J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2294-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 10.Dancis A. Roman D.G. Anderson G.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The Fre1 protein is homologous to the cytochrome b558 component of the O2-generating respiratory burst oxidase found in the plasma membrane of neutrophils(12.Clark R.A. J. Infect. Dis. 1990; 161: 1140-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Since this cytochrome catalyzes the one-electron reduction of O2, it is likely that Fre1p in yeast is directly responsible for catalyzing the one-electron reduction of Fe(III). Deletion mutants in FRE1 can efficiently take up Fe(II), but not Fe(III), from the medium(9.Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Barriocanal J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2294-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 10.Dancis A. Roman D.G. Anderson G.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 20774-20781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This result indicates that Fe(II) is the substrate for an iron transporter. Additional evidence suggests that once inside the cell, the Fe(II) may be reoxidized to Fe(III) in a reaction involving the product of the FET3 gene. This model of iron retention is supported by the fact that a FET3 deletion mutant does not accumulate iron(14.Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Transcription from FRE1 is strongly repressed by iron in the medium(9.Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Barriocanal J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2294-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 10.Dancis A. Roman D.G. Anderson G.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activation of FRE1 upon iron withdrawal requires, at the least, the product of the MAC1 gene(15.Jungmann J. Reins H.-A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Mac1p is a nuclear protein which contains in its primary sequence a number of apparent metal-binding elements. While a recessive, loss-of-function frameshift mutant, mac1-1, fails to transcribe FRE1, a gain-of-function allele, designated MAC1up1, is associated with elevated and iron-independent transcription from this locus(15.Jungmann J. Reins H.-A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). This allele contains a His279 → Gln substitution in one of the potential metal-binding motifs in Mac1p suggesting that this region is functionally important. Strains carrying this allele, which we show here is co-dominant with wild type, exhibit strongly elevated reductase activity. While Fe(III) reductase activity in iron-repressed wild type cells, or in fre1Δ or mac1-1 mutant strains, is strongly depressed, it is not absent(9.Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Barriocanal J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2294-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 10.Dancis A. Roman D.G. Anderson G.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). This indicates the likelihood that there are Fre1p-independent reduction reactions catalyzed by one or more proteins of the yeast plasma membrane. Indeed, yeast plasma membrane reductase activities have been well established(11.Lesuisse E. Crichton R.R. Labbe P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1038: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 16.Crane F.L. Roberts H. Linnane A.W. Low H. J. Bioenerg.

Hayakawa S. Hatayama T. Kitamura T. Imahara H. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1991; 72: 158-161Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Although Cu(II) also appears to be a substrate for Fre1p, in cells strongly repressed in Fre1p activity, there is significantly more residual Cu(II) versus Fe(III) reductase activity(15.Jungmann J. Reins H.-A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Thus, a Fre1p-independent, Cu(II) reductase activity could be present in yeast. Using both genetic and biochemical approaches, in this paper we test the hypothesis that S. cerevisiae possesses a Cu(II)-specific reductase activity which supplies Cu(I) to the putative copper transporter, Ctr1p. Standard media components were from Difco. The reagents for preparing the completely defined synthetic medium used for growth of copper-free cultures and the MES 1The abbreviations used are: MES4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidBPSbathophenanthroline disulfonic acidTTCtriphenyltetrazolium chloride.for buffering the uptake medium were AnalaR or AristaR grade chemicals (British Drug House) purchased from Gallard-Schlesinger. Media supplements and reagents for the reductase assays were purchased from Sigma. Potassium tetrachloroplatinate was purchased from Johnson Matthey (Ward Hill, MA). 64Cu(NO3)2 was provided by the Buffalo Materials Research Center, SUNY at Buffalo. 59FeCl3 was obtained from ICN. Solutions were prepared in doubly deionized, doubly (glass) distilled water. 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid bathophenanthroline disulfonic acid triphenyltetrazolium chloride. Yeast stocks were maintained on yeast extract (1%)-bacto-peptone (2%)-dextrose (2%) medium (YPD). For most experiments cultures were grown in a synthetic, complete medium prepared without sulfate (2.De Rome L. Gadd G.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1987; 43: 283-287Crossref Google Scholar, 19.Difco Manual. 10th ed. Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI1984: 1135-1141Google Scholar) from which iron and copper were extracted using dithizone (20.Holmquist B. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 6-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) prior to the addition of the remaining trace metals. This medium contained approximately 15 nM copper and 170 nM iron as determined by flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry and is referred to as metal-free medium in the text. As noted, bathophenanthroline sulfonate (BPS, 50 μM) was included also to further limit the bioavailability of residual iron and copper. BPS strongly inhibits the uptake of both metals. Fe(III) and Cu(II) were added as the chlorides as indicated; BPS was omitted in these cases. The carbon source in this medium was glucose (2%, w/v). The strains used were: DH5α (MATα lys2-801 leu2-3, 112 ura3-52 hisΔ200 trp1-1), DH5fs (DH5α mac1-1), DH5 up1 (DH5α MAC1up1), F113 (MATaMAC1 FRE1 ura3-52 ino1-1), and FΔFe (F113 fre1::URA3). The allele, mac1-1, is a frameshift mutation (a G deletion at nucleotide 127) while the MAC1up1 allele contains a single T-A transversion which results in an His279-Gln substitution in Mac1p. Both alleles were introduced by homologous recombination at the MAC1 locus in DH5α to yield the respective mutant strains (15.Jungmann J. Reins H.-A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). F113 and FΔFe (9.Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Barriocanal J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2294-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 10.Dancis A. Roman D.G. Anderson G.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) were obtained from A. Dances (NIH). Two additional strains were used for the test of dominance of the MAC1up1 allele: S144 (MATamet3 leu2-1 MAC1, obtained from the Yeast Genetics Stock Center, Berkeley, CA) and BCup1a (MATaMAC1up1 S144). The latter strain resulted from an initial cross of the MAC1up1 allele into S144, selecting for the mutant genotype (and MATa), followed by two additional backcrosses into S144. Except as noted, all strains exhibited a genotype which included FRE1 CUP1 ACE1 as determined by Northern analysis of FRE1 and CUP1 mRNA. Copper-induced CUP1 transcription requires ACE1. Cell growth was monitored by turbidity at 660 nm. Liquid stocks were prepared using as inocula washed single colonies taken from YPD plates. These stocks were prepared in the copper-free, synthetic medium. Growth of experimental cultures was initiated at A660 nm = 0.05 or less; the cultures were allowed to grow to A660 nm = 0.8 to 1.2 (log phase, 1.4-2.0 × 107 cells/ml) prior to use. Cells for uptake experiments were washed with uptake buffer (five times culture volume) and resuspended in the uptake buffer at the A660 nm of 1.0 (1.6 ± 0.1 × 107 cells/ml). This buffer contained 0.2 M MES and glucose (2%, w/v), pH 6.0. Citrate (20 mM) was included also as indicated. This buffer contained no detectable copper or iron. Following a 15-min equilibration in this buffer at 30°C, 64CuNO3 (10 μM) or 59FeCl3 (2 μM) was added to initiate uptake. Uptake of copper was observed to be linear for at least 20 min and for iron for at least 40 min; initial (t = 15 s), nonspecific periplasmic binding of either metal was shown to be statistically insignificant. Based on these observations, the uptake data reported are based on a single 10 min ( 64Cu) or 30 min ( 59Fe) time point sampled in triplicate in all experiments. Uptake was followed by quenching samples (1 ml) in 5 ml of an ice-cold quench solution of 10 mM EDTA in 0.1 M Tris succinate (pH 6.0). These cell samples were collected by suction though nitrocellulose filters (0.45 μm, Millipore) which were presoaked in the quench solution; the retained cells were washed with a total of 20 ml of quench solution. The filters were allowed to air dry and then were counted in an LKB CompuGamma counter. Counts were corrected for background measured by counting blank filter, efficiency, and decay to yield nanograms of metal retained. Total RNA was isolated using glass beads in the presence of 1% SDS and the standard mixture of chloroform/phenol(21.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley, New York1993Google Scholar). Following two ethanol precipitations, the RNA was stored in H2O at −70°C. Northern blots were obtained by capillary transfer from 1% agarose gels using Immobilon-N (Millipore). Filter strips were hybridized at 42°C with 32P-labeled probe ( ∼107 counts/min) for 20 h; the final wash was carried out at 50−55°C in the presence of 2% SDS in 2 × SSC. Probes were prepared by random priming (Boehringer) using as templates restriction fragments internal to the coding regions of ACT1 (actin, control) and FRE1 (iron reductase component). Autoradiographic films were quantitated by scanning laser densitometry using an LKB UltraScan instrument. Linearity of response was ensured by comparison of peak heights and areas with amount of total RNA applied or exposure time. Atomic absorption analyses were performed on a Perkin Elmer model 1100B spectrophotometer equipped with a model 700 graphite furnace and an AS-70 auto-sampler. Total cell protein was determined on all cell samples analyzed for 64Cu or 59Fe accumulation or metal reductase activities (22.Stewart P.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1975; 12: 111-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) while protein in soluble extracts was determined by BCA (bicinchoninic acid) assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as standard(23.Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18647) Google Scholar). Reductase activities in whole cells were determined as described (8.Lesuisse E. Labbe P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 257-263PubMed Google Scholar) using the citrate-containing uptake buffer in all cases. Reduction of the tetrazolium salts dimethylthiazolyldiphenyltetrazolium bromide, iodophenylnitrophenylphenyltetrazolium chloride, and triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC), respectively, was followed spectrophotometrically as described(24.Lester R.L. Smith A.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1961; 47: 475-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Reduction of paraquat was followed by coupling the resulting paraquat free radical to the reduction of ferricytochrome c (followed at 550 nm) via the superoxide radical. A plate assay for the MAC1up1 allele was developed which took advantage of the enhanced reductase activity associated with this allele. In this screen, a TTC-containing overlay (25.Ogur M. St. John R. Nagai S. Science. 1957; 125: 928-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) was poured on fresh colonies grown on YPD plates which contained CuCl2 (50 μM). Cells carrying the MAC1up1 allele were indicated by their fast (2-4 min) pink-red color development. In the presence of the copper, wild type colonies remained white. mac1-1-carrying strains were screened by their inability to grow on YPG (glycerol) plates unless CuCl2 (50 μM) was included(15.Jungmann J. Reins H.-A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Statistical analyses were performed using the INSTAT program from GraphPAD (San Diego, CA). Table 1 gives the rates of reduction of a variety of one-electron acceptors by wild type cells. The absolute rates of reduction of these substrates span a range of 105-fold; aside from Fe(III), Cu(II) is the best substrate of those tested. Also shown are the relative activities (as a percent of wild type) of fre1Δ-, mac1-1-, and MAC1up1-containing strains toward these several substrates. In most cases, a given mutation similarly affects the reduction of all substrates. For example, reduction of nearly all substrates is strongly inhibited in fre1Δ and mac1-1-containing strains, while in all cases the reduction is elevated in the gain-of-function MAC1up1 mutant. This pattern suggests that most of this reductase activity, which exhibits little specificity, is due to Fre1p. This conclusion is based on the fact that the FRE1 transcript is absent in the two former strains (9.Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Barriocanal J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2294-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 10.Dancis A. Roman D.G. Anderson G.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) but elevated in the latter one(15.Jungmann J. Reins H.-A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). However, there are two significant additional features about these data. First, there is an apparent inverse correlation between the rate of reduction of a substrate and the fold increase reduction in a MAC1up1 strain. Second is that the rate of Cu(II) reduction is uniquely less sensitive to deletion of FRE1. Nonetheless, these results are generally consistent with a model in which the predominant reductase activity in the plasma membrane is due to the Fre1p-containing complex which, in turn, is regulated by Mac1p.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab This general conclusion is demonstrated also by the spore analysis shown in Fig. 1. On the plates shown are sets of tetrads from crosses between wild type (F113) and fre1Δ-containing (FΔFe) strains and a MAC1up1-containing mutant. The YPD plates on which the spores were grown were overlaid with TTC. The elevated reductase activity in MAC1up1FRE1 colonies is clearly demonstrated by the immediate (2-4 min) reduction of the TTC to a dark red, insoluble formazan. The spores from the wild type (F113) × MAC1up1 cross show the expected 2:2 segregation of this phenotype (left plate, Fig. 1). In contrast, the spores from the fre1Δ (FΔFe) × MAC1up1 cross show a characteristic tetratype segregation in which non-parental ditypes (e.g., fre1Δ MAC1up1) lack color because they lacked Fre1p (independently scored by the URA3 marker used to disrupt FRE1) (right plate, Fig. 1). Note that the plates contained 50 μM CuSO4 which suppressed mitochondrial reduction of the TTC. This TTC overlay is commonly used as a screen for mitochondrial function in yeast(25.Ogur M. St. John R. Nagai S. Science. 1957; 125: 928-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). A positive role for Mac1p in FRE1 expression is indicated by the fact that the MAC1up1 allele is dominant or co-dominant with wild type. While reflected in all of the phenotypes associated with this gain-of-function mutation(15.Jungmann J. Reins H.-A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), this dominance is illustrated in Fig. 2 by the relative copper sensitivity of homozygous MAC1 and MAC1up1 and heterozygous MAC1 MAC1up1 diploids. MAC1up1 homozygotes are growth arrested between 200 and 300 μM CuSO4 in synthetic media, or about 6-fold more copper sensitive than wild type, while heterozygotes are about 4-fold more sensitive in the background used for this comparison. The MAC1up1 allele is suppressed by over-expression of wild type MAC1, however(15.Jungmann J. Reins H.-A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). As described extensively, transcription from FRE1 is strongly repressed by iron in the medium(9.Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Barriocanal J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2294-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 10.Dancis A. Roman D.G. Anderson G.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). This is evident in Northern blots probed for FRE1 mRNA (Fig. 3, lane 2). However, copper addition to the medium also strongly represses FRE1 transcription (lane 3). This copper-dependent repression was not due to contaminating iron; extracted medium made 40 μM in CuCl2 was shown by flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry to contain residual iron only ([Fe] ≤ 170 nM, see “Experimental Procedures”). Iron added together with copper is not synergistic (lane 4) indicating that at the metal ion concentrations used (40 μM of either metal) iron or copper alone can lead to strong transcriptional repression of FRE1. Literature data suggest that higher metal concentrations (e.g., 200 μM iron) would be even more repressing, however(9.Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Barriocanal J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2294-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 13.Eide D. Davis-Kaplan S. Jordan I. Sipe D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20774-20781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results here are consistent with a model in which both metals work though the same or overlapping regulatory elements. These results suggest also that the reductase activity of Fre1p toward Cu(II) (Table 1) is not gratuitous, but rather is associated with the normal metabolism of this metal ion. Note that in MAC1up1-containing strains FRE1 mRNA levels are only weakly repressed by iron or copper(15.Jungmann J. Reins H.-A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The assay for metal reductase activity uses BPS [Fe(II)] and bathocuproine disulfonic acid [Cu(I)] as the “reporter” of metal reduction. Coupling metal reduction to binding by a chelator can strongly perturb the reduction reaction, however(26.Thorstensen K.P. Aisen P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1052: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Since these two phenantholine derivatives chelate the reduced ions so strongly, they effectively raise the oxidation-reduction potentials of Fe(III) and Cu(II) to a point at which any reducing equivalent(s) can support the reduction of these higher valency metal ions. A chelating agent like citrate or lactate is needed at relatively high concentration (20 mM) to counteract the cell-free blank rate of Cu(II) or Fe(III) reduction driven by the phenantholine reagent. Iron uptake is known to require reduction of Fe(III)(9.Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Barriocanal J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2294-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 10.Dancis A. Roman D.G. Anderson G.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 13.Eide D. Davis-Kaplan S. Jordan I. Sipe D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20774-20781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One can make two predictions about 59Fe(III) uptake with respect to the effect of citrate. The same predictions would apply for Cu(II) if 64Cu(II) uptake is similarly reduction-dependent. First, in wild type, citrate (and lactate, data not shown) would inhibit uptake of both 59Fe(III) and 64Cu(II) because the reduction step would be suppressed by citrate chelation of the higher valence state. The data in Table 3 confirm this prediction (compare left two columns to right two). The second prediction is that 59Fe(III) and 64Cu(II) uptake would be less dependent on cell-based reduction (whether Fre1p-dependent or independent) in the absence of citrate than in its presence. This is observed also (e.g., compare wild type to FRE1 deleted strain, fre1Δ, first two rows) suggesting that in the absence of stabilization of the higher valency Cu(II) and Fe(III) states by citrate, nonspecific reduction can support uptake. The uptake data in Table 3 will be discussed in detail below.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab First, the data in Table 2 and Table 3 confirm that the repression by iron of FRE1 transcription strongly suppresses Fe(III) reduction (Table 2) and 59Fe uptake (Table 3) as has been reported. As discussed below, the new results presented in these tables show that the effect of iron (and copper) on Cu(II) reduction and uptake is quantitatively different. Several contrast"

To determine whether interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which is present in atherosclerotic lesions, induces VEGF gene expression in vascular smooth muscle cells, we performed RNA blot analysis on rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMC) with a rat VEGF cDNA probe. IL-1β increased VEGF mRNA levels in RASMC in a time- and dose-dependent manner. As little as 0.1 ng/ml IL-1β increased VEGF mRNA levels by 2-fold and 10 ng/ml IL-1β increased VEGF mRNA by 4-fold. We also measured the half-life of VEGF mRNA and performed nuclear run-on experiments before and after addition of IL-1β to see if IL-1β increased VEGF mRNA levels by stabilizing the mRNA or by increasing its rate of transcription. The normal, 2-h half-life of VEGF mRNA in RASMC was lengthened to 3.2 h (60%) by IL-1β, and IL-1β increased the rate of VEGF gene transcription by 2.1-fold. In immunoblot experiments with an antibody specific for VEGF, we found that IL-1β increased VEGF protein levels in RASMC by 3.3-fold.

https://openalex.org/W2070556283,"Abstract Cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins is a dynamic process leading to dramatic changes in the cell phenotype. Integrins are one of the major receptor families that mediate cell-matrix contact. Evidence that integrins can act as signal transducing molecules has accumulated over the past few years. We report here that p44 and p42 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues upon adhesion of human skin fibroblasts to fibronectin or upon cross-linking of β1 integrins with antibody. The tyrosine phosphorylation of both kinases is associated with increased enzymatic activity. Pretreatment of the cells with cytochalasin D, which selectively disrupts the network of the actin filaments, completely inhibits this adhesion-mediated MAP kinase activation. Thus, our findings indicate that ligation of β1 integrins induces an increase in both tyrosine phosphorylation and enzymatic activity of p44 and p42 MAP kinases, and that the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton is essential in this process. Since MAP kinase behaves as a convergence point for diverse receptor-initiated signaling events at the plasma membrane, this serine/threonine kinase plays a key role and helps to account for the diversity of integrin-dependent cell functions."
https://openalex.org/W2062457936,"The notochord and floor plate contribute to patterning the ventral neural tube in part by expressing a diffusible factor that induces motoneurons. To determine the mechanisms that direct the development of other classes of ventral neurons, we studied the development of dopaminergic neurons that reside near motoneurons in the ventral midbrain. We provide evidence that dopaminergic neurons develop in the vicinity of the floor plate and that they can be specified by the floor plate in vitro and in vivo. Unlike motoneurons, efficient induction of dopaminergic neurons requires contact with floor plate cells. These results suggest that neuronal diversification along the dorsal-ventral axis may be achieved partly through the concerted action of diffusible and contact-dependent signals from a single organizing center, the floor plate."
https://openalex.org/W2029067920,"Nitric oxide, NO, exerts numerous important regulatory functions in biological tissues and has been hypothesized to have a role in the pathogenesis of cellular injury in a number of diseases. It has been suggested that alterations in NO generation are a critical cause of injury in the ischemic heart. However, the precise alterations in NO generation which occur are not known, and there is considerable controversy regarding whether myocardial ischemia results in increased or decreased NO formation. Therefore, electron paramagnetic resonance studies were performed to directly measure NO in isolated rat hearts subjected to global ischemia, using the direct NO trap Fe2+-N-methyl-D-glucamine dithiocarbamate, which specifically binds NO giving rise to a characteristic triplet EPR spectrum with g = 2.04 and aN = 13.2 G. While only a small triplet signal was observed in normally perfused hearts, a 10-fold increase in this triplet EPR spectrum was observed after 30 min of ischemia indicating a marked increase in NO formation and trapping. Measurements were performed as a function of the duration of ischemia, and it was determined that with increased duration of ischemia NO formation and trapping was also increased. NO generation was inhibited by the nitric oxide synthase blocker, N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), suggesting that NO was generated via nitric oxide synthase. Blockade of NO generation with L-NAME resulted in more than a 2-fold increase in the recovery of contractile function in hearts reperfused after 30 min of global ischemia.

These events can be faithfully reproduced in vitro using cell-free extracts derived from Xenopus eggs. Such extracts contain three major N-acetylglucosaminylated proteins, p200, p97, and p60. All three become assembled into reconstituted nuclear pores. Here we show that p200, p97, and p60 exist in eggs in soluble high molecular mass complexes of 1000, 450, and 600 kDA, respectively. The bulk of p60 is stably associated with proteins of 58 and 54 kDa, while p200 is associated with a fraction of p60 in a separate complex lacking p58 and p54. Upon examining the behavior of these proteins in the cell cycle, we find that p200 and p97 are highly phosphorylated at mitosis, both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, in extracts that cycle between interphase and mitosis, p200 and p97 are specifically phosphorylated at mitosis. Corresponding with their mitotic phosphorylation, both p200 and p97 are specific substrates for purified mitotic Cdc2 kinase, whereas nucleoporin p60 is not.

The mitotic reorganization of the eukaryotic cell architecture ensures the correct partitioning of the cellular contents to each of the daughter cells. These mitotic changes are seen most vividly in the dramatic alterations of the cell nucleus where the chromosomes condense, the mitotic spindle assembles, and the nuclear envelope breaks down(1.Robbins E. Gonatas N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1964; 21: 429-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 2.Steinert G. Baltus E. Hanocq-Quertier J. Brachet J. J. Ultrastruct.

There is currently a great deal of evidence to indicate that movement of the cell cycle into mitosis is regulated by the Cdc2 protein kinase(4.Solomon M.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of key cellular proteins by Cdc2 kinase, or activated downstream kinases, is known to correlate with many of the major mitotic rearrangements. Determining the targets of the Cdc2 kinase is, therefore, a means to identify proteins that initiate cell cycle rearrangements(5.Nigg E.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). For example, one of the non-histone chromosomal scaffold proteins, topoisomerase II, is required for chromosome condensation and shows increased activity during mitosis(6.Newport J. Spann T. Cell. 1987; 48: 219-230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 7.Uemura T. Ohkura H. Adachi Y. Morino K. Shiozaki K. Yanagida M.

The increase in topoisomerase II activity is associated with an increase in its phosphorylation state as a result of either protein kinase C (10.Corbett A.H. Fernald A.W. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2090-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) or casein kinase II(11.Cardenas M.E. Walter R. Hanna D. Gasser S.M. J.

Similarly, a number of proteins that bind to and modulate microtubule dynamics have been isolated, and some of these proteins (MAP4, p220, and p47) are phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent fashion(13.Lee G.

Nature. 1994; 367: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Another key mitotic reorganization event seen in higher eukaryotes is the disassembly of the nuclear envelope. Specifically, the nuclear lamina network depolymerizes, the double nuclear membranes vesiculate, and the pore complexes disassemble(19.Maul G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 74: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 20.Gerace L. Blobel G. Cell. 1980; 19: 277-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 21.Ottaviano Y.

Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 127-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Of all of the mitotic rearrangements that occur, the disassembly of the nuclear lamina is the best understood. The lamina is composed of polymerized intermediate filament-like proteins that are arranged between the inner nuclear membrane and chromatin. The lamin proteins form homo- and heteropolymers through strong coiled/coil interactions both in vivo and in vitro(23.Bloemendal H. Peiper F.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1007: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 24.Robson R.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Despite these strong interactions the lamina is a very dynamic network that both completely disassembles during mitosis and incorporates new lamin proteins during nuclear growth in interphase(20.Gerace L. Blobel G. Cell. 1980; 19: 277-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 25.Goldman A.E. Moir R.D. Montag-Lowy M. Stewart M. Goldman R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 725-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Lamins have been shown to be phosphorylated during interphase and hyperphosphorylated during mitosis (21.Ottaviano Y. Gerace L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 624-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, lamin-associated proteins of the inner nuclear membrane are also phosphorylated during interphase and mitosis (26.Appelbaum J. Blobel G. Georgatos S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4181-4184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Courvalin J.C. Segil N. Blobel G. Worman H.J. J. Biol.

Cell. 1993; 73: 1267-1279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation may regulate the dynamics of the lamin network in three ways: 1) by affecting the association between individual lamin monomers(30.Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), 2) by regulating the nuclear import of lamin monomers(31.Hennekes H. Peter M. Weber K. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1293-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and 3) by affecting the association between lamins and their putative inner nuclear membrane receptors(26.Appelbaum J.

Purified Cdc2 kinase can phosphorylate and dissociate lamin polymers formed in vitro(33.Peter M. Heitlinger E. Haner M. Aebi U. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1535-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In addition, either purified Cdc2 kinase or protein kinase C will phosphorylate and disassemble the lamin network of detergent-treated nuclei(34.Peter M. Nakagawa J. Doree M. Labbe J.C. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 591-602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 35.Hocevar B.A. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7545-7552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), lending support to the hypothesis that mitotic phosphorylation induces disassembly of the nuclear lamina. The molecular mechanism of disassembly of the other nuclear envelope structures, such as the nuclear membrane and nuclear pore complexes, is much less well understood. A variety of in vitro assays have demonstrated that mitotic phosphorylation negatively regulates the binding of membrane vesicles to chromatin(29.Foisner R. Gerace L. Cell. 1993; 73: 1267-1279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 36.Pfaller R. Smythe C. Newport J.W.

It appears that once the nuclear membrane has vesiculated, phosphorylation of membrane components by kinases downstream from Cdc2 prevents the reassociation of vesicles with chromatin until interphase resumes. However, almost nothing is known about the actual mechanism of membrane vesicularization or, indeed, nuclear pore disassembly. In previous studies we used an in vitro nuclear reconstitution system to identify and characterize a family of nuclear pore glycoproteins required for nuclear transport(38.Finlay D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Price T.M. Forbes D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 39.Finlay D.R. Forbes D.J. Cell. 1990; 60: 17-29Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In this reconstitution system, nuclei assemble when sperm chromatin is mixed with the cytosolic and membrane fractions of a Xenopus egg lysate(40.Lohka M.J. Masui Y. J.

Reconstituted nuclei are fully functional in that they accumulate nuclear proteins(42.Newmeyer D.D. Lucocq J.M. Burglin T.R. DeRobertis E.M.

A major open question is the manner in which the nuclear pore complex assembles and disassembles with each cell cycle. In this study we have used interphase and mitotic egg extracts in a first step to investigate whether known nuclear pore proteins are phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. The specific proteins examined are the nuclear pore glycoproteins, which are modified with O-linked GlcNAc residues. Such proteins can be identified or isolated by their binding to the lectin, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). 1The abbreviations used are: WGAwheat germ agglutininPVDFpolyvinylidine difluoride.Moreover, WGA-coated ferritin binds to both the cytoplasmic and nuclear faces of the nuclear pore, as does a series of anti-pore monoclonal antibodies that react with one or more members of this glycoprotein family(38.Finlay D.R.

In this study we find that two prominent members of the glycoprotein family, p200 and p97, are specifically phosphorylated during mitosis. They are phosphorylated both in vivo when eggs are injected with [γ32P]ATP, and in vitro when mitotic egg lysates are labeled with [γ32P]ATP. Moreover, we find that p200 and p97 are specific targets for immunopurified mitotic Cdc2 kinase, while the pore protein p60 is not. The distinct complexes that contain each of these glycoproteins will be discussed. wheat germ agglutinin polyvinylidine difluoride. The preparation of cytosol and membrane components from a Xenopus egg lysate to reconstitute functional nuclei in vitro was done as described previously(60.Newmeyer D.D. Wilson K.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 607-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 61.Smythe C. Newport J.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 449-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The egg cytosol was further clarified of residual membranes by recentrifugation (200,000 × g, 30 min, 2°C), distributed into 50-μl aliquots, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70°C. The preparation of an activated egg lysate that cycles between interphase and mitotic states was done as described by Murray and Kirschner(62.Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1989; 339: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Egg cytosol (40 μl) was converted to a mitotic state by the addition of a recombinant fusion GST-cyclin-Δ13 protein and incubation at 22°C for 50 min(63.Solomon M.J. Glotzer M. Lee T.H. Philippe M. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1990; 63: 1013-1024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). The mitotic cytosol was then radiolabeled with [γ32P]ATP (ICN 3502010; final concentration, 4 μCi/μl) for 10 min. The phosphorylation reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of 20% SDS, 1 ml of TENP (50 mM Tris•HCl, pH 8, 400 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 40 mM β-glycerophosphate, 10 mM pyrophosphate, 5 mM EDTA), 0.2% Triton X-100 and was then mixed with 20 μl of WGA-Sepharose (4°C, 2 h). The Sepharose was washed with TENP (8 × 1 ml), TN (0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 100 mM NaCl; 4 × 1 ml), and the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-gel loading buffer. Alternatively, specific members of the labeled WGA-binding proteins were immunoprecipitated by stopping the reaction with the addition of 5 μl of 20% SDS, 1 ml of HENP (5 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 40 mM β-glycerophosphate, 10 mM pyrophosphate, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100), 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma P9424), and 20 μl of either anti-p200, anti-p97, or anti-rat p62 crude antiserum (64.Finlay D.R. Meier E. Bradley P. Horecka J. Forbes D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 169-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) for 1 h at 4°C. The Sepharose was washed in HENP (10 × 1 ml), TN (4 × 1 ml), and the bound proteins eluted with SDS-gel loading buffer. The relative phosphorylation state of the WGA-binding proteins in a cycling extract was monitored every 10 min by pulse labeling an aliquot of the extract with [γ32P]ATP for a 10-min period. Specifically, a cycling extract was prepared and divided into 42-μl aliquots that were all placed at 22°C at time 0 to initiate cycling, which occurs due to the translation of cyclin from the endogenous mRNA pool(62.Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1989; 339: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar, 65.Murray A.W. Solomon M.J. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1989; 339: 280-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Every 10 min, 2 μl of an aliquot was removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent H1 kinase assays. The remaining 40 μl was immediately labeled with [γ32P]ATP to a final concentration of 4 mCi/ml. After 10 min, the labeling of the aliquot was stopped, and the WGA-binding proteins were isolated as described above. To monitor the levels of Cdc2 kinase in the cycling extract, histone H1 kinase assays were performed using the frozen aliquots as described by Smythe and Newport (61.Smythe C. Newport J.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 449-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The relative mobility on polyacrylamide gels of the WGA-binding proteins isolated from an interphase egg lysate derived from activated eggs, an egg lysate converted to mitosis by preincubation (50 min) with GST-cyclinΔ13, and a mitotic egg lysate derived from unactivated eggs (prepared using a buffer that preserves the high levels of Cdc2 kinase found in the egg(6.Newport J. Spann T. Cell. 1987; 48: 219-230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar)) was determined. Aliquots (100 μl) of each lysate were diluted with 5 μl of SDS (20%), 1 ml of TENP plus 0.1% Triton X-100, and mixed with 20 μl of WGA-Sepharose (4°C, 6 h). The Sepharose was washed with TENP, 0.1% Triton X-100 (4 × 1 ml), and then potato acid phosphatase buffer (PAP: 40 mM Pipes, pH 5.8, 1 mM dithiotheitol; 3 × 1 ml). PAP buffer (50 μl) with or without 0.1 unit of potato acid phosphatase (Calbiochem 524528), was added to the WGA-Sepharose containing the bound glycoproteins and incubated at 30°C (1 h). Each reaction was washed in TENP, 0.1% Triton X-100 (3 × 1 ml); the bound proteins were solubilized in SDS-gel loading buffer, and electrophoresed on a long (25 cm) 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane, probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated WGA, and visualized by chemiluminescence (DuPont NEN). The WGA-binding proteins were affinity purified from 4 ml of egg lysate using WGA-Sepharose. The proteins were eluted in 0.2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 M GlcNAc, and 8 mM trichitotriose. This mixture was applied to a Sephacryl HR S-300 column (50 cm × 1.5 cm) using a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and 1-ml fractions were collected. The proteins in each fraction were precipitated with 25% trichloroacetic acid, 0.4% sodium deoxycholate, solubilized in SDS-gel sample buffer, electrophoresed on a 9% polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore). The blot was probed with 125I-WGA and exposed for autoradiography. The same column was calibrated by fractionation of thyroglobulin (670 kDa), β-galactosidase (464 kDa), catalase (240 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), and ovalbumin (45 kDa). Subsequent gel filtration was performed by fast protein liquid chromatography with a Superose 6 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). WGA-binding proteins were purified from 2-4 ml of either interphase cytosol or mitotic cytosol made by the conversion of interphase cytosol with GST-cyclin. These proteins were applied to the column equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Triton X-100. Fractions (0.6 ml) were collected at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min, trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, and resolved on gels as above. The proteins were transferred to PVDF and probed with 125I-WGA. Because iodinated WGA often did not label the minor WGA-binding proteins very well, we routinely stained our protein blots with India ink first, as it labels these proteins more sensitively than does WGA. Freshly laid Xenopus laevis eggs were dejellied, sorted, and soaked in 0.2 × MMR (1 × MMR: 5 mM Hepes, pH 7.8, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO4, 2 mM CaCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA), plus cycloheximide (50 μg/ml). One portion of the eggs was left untreated, and the other was electrically activated (62.Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1989; 339: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Both the unactivated and activated eggs were transferred into 1 × MMR containing 5% Ficoll, and 50 μg/ml cycloheximide. The eggs (28 each of activated and unactivated) were microinjected with 50 nl of [γ32P]ATP (133 μCi/μl), 20 mM K2HPO4, pH 7.2, and 20 mM EGTA. After 10 min, they were transferred to 1 ml of ice-cold phosphatase inhibitor buffer (PIB: 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 40 mM β-glycerophosphate, 10 mM pyrophosphate, 5 mM EDTA, 2 mM NaVO4), and the excess buffer was removed. The eggs were homogenized following the addition of 200 μl of PIB containing 0.5% SDS by pipetting up and down with a 200-μl Gilson Pipetman. The yolk and pigment granules were pelleted (13,000 × g for 10 min), the supernatant was added to 1 ml of PIB containing 0.1% Triton X-100 plus 0.1% deoxycholate and mixed with 20 μl of WGA-Sepharose (4°C, 4 h). The Sepharose beads were washed with PIB containing 0.1% Triton X-100, plus 0.1% deoxycholate (5 × 1 ml) and then TN (4 × 1 ml). The labeled WGA-binding proteins were eluted with SDS-gel loading buffer, electrophoresed on an 8% polyacrylamide gel, and processed for autoradiography. To compare the total amount of the WGA-binding proteins present in mitotic (unactivated) and interphase (activated) eggs, a group (100) of each type of eggs was collected and homogenized as outlined above. The crude lysate was mixed with 30 μl of WGA-Sepharose in 1 ml of PIB containing 0.1% SDS, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% sodium deoxycholate for 6 h at 4°C. The Sepharose was washed, and the bound proteins were eluted with SDS gel loading buffer. Equal amounts of eluate from the mitotic and activated eggs were electrophoresed on an 8% polyacrylamide gel, blotted to PVDF, probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated WGA, and visualized using chemiluminescence. WGA-binding proteins from interphase egg cytosol (0.6 ml) were isolated by the addition of 0.5 ml of TENT (50 mM Tris•HCl, pH 8, 5 mM EDTA, 500 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) and 0.1 ml of WGA-Sepharose to the cytosol followed by mixing at 4°C for 3 h. The Sepharose was extensively washed first with TENT (8 × 1 ml) and then with HSB2 (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EGTA, 40 mM β-glycerophosphate; 5 × 1 ml). The bound proteins were eluted with 0.1 ml of HSB2 containing 0.5 MN-acetylglucosamine and 10 mM trichitotriose (1 h 4°C). The eluted proteins were stored on ice until use later the same day. Purified Cdc2 kinase was prepared by immunoprecipitation with the highly specific anti-Cdc2 C-terminal peptide antibody D65(66.Fang F. Newport J.W. Cell. 1991; 66: 731-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). This antibody specifically binds to p34 Cdc2 kinase and not the related p32 Cdk2 kinase(66.Fang F. Newport J.W. Cell. 1991; 66: 731-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Protein-A Sepharose (20 μl) was mixed with either D65 (10 μg) or nonspecific rabbit IgG (10 μg) in 1 ml of kinase wash buffer (KWB: 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 80 mM β-glycerophosphate, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM NaF, 5 mM EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100). Interphase cytosol (25 μl) or cytosol that had been preincubated (50 min) with GST-cyclin to induce high levels of Cdc2 kinase activity was added, and the samples were mixed at 4°C for 1.5 h. The Sepharose beads were extensively washed with KWB (5 × 1 ml) and then with the kinase reaction buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 40 mM β-glycerophosphate; 4 × 0.5 ml). The ability of the immunocomplexes to phosphorylate the WGA-binding proteins was tested by mixing the Cdc2-antibody-Sepharose beads with 20 μl of the eluted WGA-binding proteins and [γ32P]ATP (0.3 mCi/μmol ATP and ATP at 0.4 mM). To determine which phosphorylated proteins originated from the immunoprecipitated Cdc2 complexes themselves, a parallel set of Cdc2-antibody-Sepharose beads were mixed with 20 μl of HSB2 buffer alone containing [γ32P]ATP (0.3 mCi/μmol ATP and ATP at 0.4 mM). All reactions were incubated for 10 min at 22°C and stopped by the addition of SDS-gel loading buffer. The samples were electrophoresed on an 8% polyacrylamide gel and processed for autoradiography. In order to examine the relative Cdc2/H1 kinase levels present on the Cdc2-antibody-Sepharose beads, histone H1 (0.4 mg/ml) was added in place of the WGA-binding proteins in the same reaction buffer (HSB2, 0.4 mM ATP, [γ32P]ATP at 0.3 mCi/μmol ATP). The cytosolic fraction of a Xenopus egg lysate contains three prominent WGA-binding proteins, designated p200, p97, and p60, as well as a number of minor WGA-binding proteins(38.Finlay D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Price T.M. Forbes D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 58.Miller M.W. Hanover J.A. J. Biol.

The three major proteins are assembled into reconstituted nuclei when a chomatin substrate is mixed with the cytosolic and membrane fractions of an egg lysate(38.Finlay D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Price T.M.

Protein p60 is a known nuclear pore protein and is the Xenopus homolog of the rat nucleoporin, p62(67.Cordes V.C. Waizenegger I. Krohne G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 55: 31-47PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins p200 and p97 have also been localized to the nuclear pore complexes.2,3 Interestingly, anti-p97 antibodies give both a nuclear pore stain and an intranuclear stain by immunofluorescence. 3M. Powers, C. Macaulay, and D. J. Forbes, submitted for publication.In summary, by nuclear reconstitution and immunolocalization, all three proteins are nuclear pore glycoproteins, although p97 appears to have a more complex localization.

In the present study, we asked whether the skACT promoter used the same mechanism. A mouse skACT promoter fragment (−113/−46) was induced by both α1-adrenergic stimulation and co-transfection of activated β-PKC, and contained three required DNA sequence elements: M-CAT, CArG, and Sp1. The skACT M-CAT element bound TEF-1 in cardiac myocytes. Thus the skACT and β-MHC promoters both require a TEF-1 binding site for activation by α1-adrenergic stimulation, but differ in that skACT also requires a CArG box.

https://openalex.org/W1983504336,"We have used a polymerase chain reaction strategy to identify in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes of the mammalian calnexin/calreticulin family, and we have identified and isolated a single gene, CNE1. The protein predicted from the CNE1 DNA sequence shares some of the motifs with calnexin and calreticulin, and it is 24% identical and 31% similar at the amino acid level with mammalian calnexin. On the basis of its solubility in detergents and its lack of extraction from membranes by 2.5 M urea, high salt, and sodium carbonate at pH 11.5, we have established that Cne1p is an integral membrane protein. However, unlike calnexins, the predicted carboxyl-terminal membrane-spanning domain of Cne1p terminates directly. Furthermore, based on its changed mobility from 76 to 60 kDa after endoglycosidase H digestion Cne1p was shown to be N-glycosylated. Localization of the Cne1p protein by differential and analytical subcellular fractionation as well as by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy showed that it was exclusively located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), despite the lack of known ER retention motifs. Although six Ca2+-binding proteins were detected in the ER fractions, they were all soluble proteins, and Ca2+ binding activity has not been detected for Cne1p. Disruption of the CNE1 gene did not lead to inviable cells or to gross effects on the levels of secreted proteins such as α-pheromone or acid phosphatase. However, in CNE1 disrupted cells, there was an increase of cell-surface expression of an ER retained temperature-sensitive mutant of the α-pheromone receptor, ste2-3p, and also an increase in the secretion of heterologously expressed mammalian α1-antitrypsin.

Chem. 1994; 269: 12263-12268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, calnexin associates transiently with the normal folding intermediates of soluble monomeric glycoproteins including transferrin, α1-antitrypsin, complement C3, apoB-100(14.Ou W-J. Cameron P.M. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 15.Le A. Steiner J.L. Ferrell G.A. Shaker J.C. Sifers R.N. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7464-7472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).A second related function has been proposed for mammalian calnexin as a constituent of a protein quality control apparatus in the ER recognizing and retaining some mutant proteins and components of unassembled complexes. For example, when soluble secretory glycoproteins are synthesized in the presence of the proline analog azetidine 2-carboxylic acid, they are retained in the ER and remain associated with calnexin for a prolonged period(14.Ou W-J. Cameron P.M. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Similarly, mutant proteins such as vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein ts045 are retained in the ER by their association with calnexin(11.Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Components of unassembled complexes are also retained in the ER in association with calnexin for example, the MHC class I heavy chain synthesized in the absence of β2-microglobulin(5.Degen E. Williams D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1099-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 17.Jackson M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Peterson P.A. Williams D.B. Science. 1994; 263: 384-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and the T cell receptor synthesized in the absence of the α-chain(18.David V. Hochstenbach F. Rajagopalan S. Brenner M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9585-9592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Rajagopalan S. Yuhui X. Brenner M.B. Science. 1994; 263: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Thus, calnexin has the properties expected of a component of such a quality control mechanism.Recently, the sequence of a gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae with similarity to mammalian calnexin has been reported(20.De Virgilio C. Burckert N. Neuhaus J.-M. Boller T. Wiemken A. Yeast. 1993; 9: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The isolation of a calnexin homolog from yeast will help elucidate the molecular mechanisms whereby calnexin carries out its roles as a molecular chaperone and the retention of proteins in the ER membrane. We have identified by a PCR strategy a candidate calnexin gene in S. cerevisiae CNE1. We have characterized and localized the Cne1p protein and have determined by gene disruption some of its functions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and MediaThe S. cerevisiae diploid strain W303D (MATa/αade2-1/ade2-1 can1-100/can1-100 ura3-1/ura3-1 leu2-3, 112/leu2-3, 112 trp1-1/trp1-1 his3-11, 15/his 3-11, 15), W303-1a (MATaade2-1 can1-100 ura3-1 leu2-3, 112 trp1-1 his3-11, 15), W303-1b (MAT α ade2-1 can1-100 ura3-1 leu2-3, 112 trp1-1 his3-11, 15), DC 17α (MAT α his1), and M200-6C (MATasst1 sst2) strains were grown at 30°C in YPD medium containing 1% yeast extract (Difco), 2% bacto-peptone (Difco), and 2% dextrose (BDH) or synthetic media (SC) with the appropriate amino acid supplements and either 2% glucose or 2% sucrose. The Escherichia coli strain MC1061 was used(21.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Yeast synthetic media were as in Sherman et al.(22).PCR AmplificationTo identify and isolate genes similar to calnexin from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA, degenerate oligonucleotides for the sequences KPEDWDE and YKGK/EWKP with all possible codons at each position were synthesized using a BioSearch series 8000 DNA synthesizer (see Fig. 1B). Amplification was performed using a Perkin-Elmer Cetus thermocycler(23.Hann B.C. Poritz M.A. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3223-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Samples were then electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The band migrating at approximately 300 bp was purified by electroelution and cloned into the SmaI site of plasmid pTZ19R and sequenced by the dideoxy protocol using T7 DNA Polymerase (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.).Cloning of Calnexin in S. cerevisiaeIn order to clone the entire sequence of the gene we identified, YEp24 genomic S. cerevisiae DNA libraries were screened using the isolated calnexin PCR fragment as a probe labeled by nick translation(21.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Two independent clones were isolated and mapped using restriction enzyme analysis. By Southern analysis, a 3.8-kb SphI fragment was found to hybridize to the PCR probe and was subcloned into the SphI site of pTZ19R (Pharmacia) to generate plasmid pFP10.1. Based on sequence information provided by the PCR fragment, oligonucleotides were synthesized and used to sequence the gene as described previously(21.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar).Antibody ProductionPolyclonal antibodies recognizing calnexin were obtained by immunizing rabbits with GST::Cne1p fusion proteins expressed in E. coli. The fusion was made by inserting a BamHI-SphI fragment (CNE1) into pGex-2T(24.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5035) Google Scholar). GST-calnexin was expressed by isopropyltho-β-D-galactoside induction and purified(24.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5035) Google Scholar).Membrane Extraction and Endo-H DigestionExtracts of post-nuclear supernatants were mixed with 1 volume of 1 M NaCl, 0.2 M sodium carbonate, pH 11.5, 2.5 M urea, 2% Triton X-100, 0.2% Triton X-100, 2% deoxycholate, or 0.2% SDS and were subsequently analyzed as described previously(25.Feldheim D. Rothblatt J. Schekman R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3288-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Cne1p antiserum was used at 1:2000 dilution. Endo-H digestions were performed by incubating 50 μg of ML fraction proteins in 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.9, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100 + inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml pepstatin, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml aprotinin) and incubating with 2 μg of Endo-H for 16 h at 37°C.Yeast FractionationS. cerevisiae strain W303-1a was grown at 30°C in YPD medium to a density 2-4 OD600/ml cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed in water. Spheroplasts (100 OD600/ml) were generated by a 60-min incubation at 30°C in 0.7 M sorbitol, 1.5% peptone, 0.75% yeast extract, 0.5% glucose, 10 mM Tris, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and Zymolyase T100 1 mg/g wet weight yeast and homogenized with a Potter-Elvejhem homogenizer in 0.1 M sorbitol, 20 mM HEPES, 50 mM potassium acetate, pH 7.4, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mg/ml aprotinin. The homogenate was then subjected to differential centrifugation at 4°C. Three different fractions, i.e. Nuclear(N), large granule (ML) and microsomal (P), and a final supernatant (S) were separated by successive centrifugation at a square angle velocity of 8.2 × 105, 1.8 × 109, and 1.2 × 1011 rad2 s−1. For isopycnic sucrose gradient centrifugation, the large granule (ML) fraction was loaded on a sucrose density gradient (0.5 2.3 M sucrose, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) and centrifuged for 8 h at 7.6 × 105 rad2 s−1 (SW40 Beckman Instruments). Fractions were collected and analyzed for activity of the marker enzymes, ATPase(26.Bowman B.J. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2928-2934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), NADPH cytochrome c reductase(27.Kubota S. Yoshida Y. Kumota J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1977; 81: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), GDPase(28.Abeijon C. Orlean P. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6935-6939Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and monoamine oxidase(29.Bandlow W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 282: 105-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Kar2p and Cne1p were detected by immunoblot and subsequently quantitated by densitometry. Anti- Kar2p and anti-Cne1p antisera were used at 1:2000 and 1:1000 dilution, respectively.5Ca OverlaySamples were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE and evaluated for 5Ca overlay exactly as described by Wada et al.(2.Wada I. Rindress D. Cameron P.H. Ou W.-J. Doherty J.J. Louvard D. Bell A.W. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 266 (1991, 9-19610)Google Scholar). Yeast ER fractions were recovered from analytical isopycnic gradients of ML fractions at densities greater than 1.151 g/ml (ρ > 1.151 g/ml). Membrane and soluble proteins were separated by Triton X-114 extraction as described by Bordier(30.Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Control experiments were carried out with dog pancreatic ER membranes also extracted with Triton X-114 exactly as described by Wada et al.(2.Wada I. Rindress D. Cameron P.H. Ou W.-J. Doherty J.J. Louvard D. Bell A.W. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 266 (1991, 9-19610)Google Scholar).ImmunofluorescenceStaining of S. cerevisiae was performed essentially as described previously (31.Pringle J.R. Adams A.E.M. Drubin D.G. Harrer B.K. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 565-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) with the following incubations: 1) anti-Cne1p antisera (1:1000) for 60 min, 2) rhodamine-conjugated Fab (1:50 Jackson Immunochemicals) for 45 min, 3) anti-Kar2p antisera (1:2000) for 60 min, 4) fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated IgG (1:50, Jackson Immunochemicals) and DAPI (2 mg/ml, Sigma) for 45 min. Cells were viewed using epifluorescence (Aristoplan, Leitz) and by confocal microscopy (Molecular Dynamics).Disruption of the Yeast CNE1 GenePlasmid pFP10.1 was digested with SphI and religated to clone the insert in the opposite orientation, creating plasmid pFP10.11. A 1-kb EcoRI fragment was removed from pFP-10.11. This effectively removes the multiple cloning site to create the plasmid pFP-10.12. A 750-bp BamHI-PstI internal to CNE1 was replaced with a 2-kilobase pair BamHI-PstI fragment containing the LEU2 gene from pJJ250(32.Jones J.S. Prakash L. Yeast. 1990; 6: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, pFP10.13, was cut with ScaI and SphI to linearize the plasmid and transformed into the leu22− diploid yeast strain W303D(33.Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on SC glucose minus leucine plates. Disruption of the CNE1 gene was confirmed by Southern blots. For further genetic analysis, diploids were sporulated and tetrad dissection was performed by standard procedures, and the presence of the disruption in parent cells and spores was confirmed by Southern blot analysis.Acid Phosphatase AssayPlasmid pRS306-CNE1 was constructed by inserting the ScaI-HpaI fragment containing the open reading frame of CNE1 into the BamHI site (3′ to the Gal promoter) of vector pRS306 Gal (34.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and transformed into strain W303-1b Δcne1::LEU2. This strain was subsequently grown at 30°C in SC sucrose-uracil (22.Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence C.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1979Google Scholar) to OD600 of 1. Cultures were then divided in three and glucose or galactose (2% w/v final concentration) or sucrose (4% w/v final concentration) added. Cell surface acid phosphatase activity was determined as described (35.Tohe-e A. Ueda Y. Kakimoto S.-I. Oshima Y. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 113: 727-738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Heterologous Expression of α1-AntitrypsinThe cDNAs for wild type and Z mutant α1-antitrypsin were cloned into the PvuII site of pVT-101U(36.Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Plasmids pVT-AlPi (wild type) and pVT-AlPz (mutant) were transformed into W303-1band W303-1b Δcne1::LEU2, and these were grown overnight in SC glucose-uracil at 30°C. Equal numbers of cells were spotted onto SC glucose-uracil plates and overlaid with a nitrocellulose filter (BA85 Schleicher and Schuell). Plates were incubated at 30°C overnight, and nitrocellulose was subsequently washed to remove yeast cells and immunoblotted with α1-antitrypsin antiserum at 1:1000 dilution (Calbiochem). For detection, either a secondary antibody linked to alkaline phosphatase or Protein A linked to 125I was used.Halo Assay for α-Pheromone Production20-ml cultures of wild type strain (W303-1b pVT), calnexin-deleted strain (W303-1b Δcne1::LEU2 pVT), or calnexin overproducing strain (W303-1b Δcne1::LEU2 pVT-CNE1) were grown in SC glucose-uracil to OD600 of 1 and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in 250 μl of water, and 5 μl was spotted onto a lawn of M200-6C cells on YPD agar. Agar plates were incubated at 30°C for 48 h.Quantitative Mating AssayAssays were performed as described(37.Sprague G.F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 77-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). A 3.0-kilobase pair EcoRI-SphI fragment containing calnexin was cloned into the EcoRI site of pAD13, a low copy number plasmid(38.Costigan C. Gething S. Snyder M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1162-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Mating efficiency for strains DJ 283-7-1a (Mataste2-3ts can1ts bar1-1 ade2OChis4amlys 2OCleu2 trp1amura3 cry1 SUP4-3amts Δcne1::LEU2) transformed with pAD13 or pAD13-CNE1 were measured at 23 and 37°C using tester strain DC17α. Strains were grown to an OD600 of 1 at either 23 or 37°C and then mixed with confluent DC 17α for 3 h at 23 of 37°C. Mating efficiency is defined as the number of diploids formed per input haploid. Relative mating efficiency was standardized for each experiment. The mating efficiency of DJ 283-7-1a pAD13, with DC 17α at 23°C was set at 100.RESULTSWe used a specific PCR approach to clone genes with sequence similarity to mammalian calnexin and calreticulin from S. cerevisiae. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers were designed which corresponded to the amino acid sequence motifs shared between mammalian calnexin and calreticulin (Fig. 1, A and B). Using S. cerevisiae DNA as a template, an amplified DNA fragment of approximately 300 bp was identified, cloned, and sequenced. The sequence corresponded most closely to that of mammalian calnexin (nucleotides 1073-1424) (38%) and of mammalian calreticulin (24%). This DNA fragment was then used to probe a S. cerevisiae genomic library in the yeast vector YEp24. Two independent clones with an overlapping common region were isolated from 4 × 104 colonies screened. The yeast DNA insert was subcloned on the basis of its hybridization with the DNA probe, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The DNA sequence predicts a protein of 502 amino acids and was found to be identical to a previously reported gene sequence, CNE1(20.De Virgilio C. Burckert N. Neuhaus J.-M. Boller T. Wiemken A. Yeast. 1993; 9: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The overall sequence identity to canine calnexin was 24% and mouse calreticulin was 21% (Fig. 1C). The predicted protein (Fig. 2B) contains a signal sequence, N-linked glycosylation sites, and a carboxyl-terminal transmembrane domain(39.Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16999) Google Scholar, 40.von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3686) Google Scholar, 41.Argos P. Rao J.K. Hargave P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Unlike calnexin, the predicted Cne1p sequence did not contain a carboxyl-terminal cytosolic domain, and unlike calreticulin it did not have a carboxyl-terminal ER retention motif (HDEL in yeast)(2.Wada I. Rindress D. Cameron P.H. Ou W.-J. Doherty J.J. Louvard D. Bell A.W. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 266 (1991, 9-19610)Google Scholar). Thus, on the basis of overall predicted structure, the sequence we identified did not closely resemble either known calreticulin or known calnexin sequences.Figure 2Hydrophobicity plot and topology of Cne1p. Hydrophobicity plot (A) and predicted topology (B) of Cne1p showing the five predicted sites of N-linked glycosylation and the single transmembrane domain at the extreme carboxyl terminus. The predicted signal sequence cleavage is at residue threonine 20 (T20).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Identification of Cne1p as an Integral Membrane ProteinAntibodies were raised to Cne1p which was expressed in E. coli as a fusion protein with GST and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione beads(24.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5035) Google Scholar). This antiserum recognized a protein in yeast of 76 kDa which was present in a particulate cell fraction. To determine if Cne1p is an integral membrane protein, membrane preparations were solubilized in SDS, sodium deoxycholate, or Triton X-100. No significant extraction of calnexin was observed with either sodium carbonate at pH 11.5, 0.5 M NaCl or 2.5 M urea (Fig. 3A). By these criteria, the properties Cne1p correspond to those expected of an integral membrane protein.Figure 3Cne1p is an integral membrane glycoprotein. Panel A, spheroplasts were prepared and extracted with SDS (0.1%), sodium deoxycholate (1%), 0.1 M sodium carbonate, pH 11.5, Triton X-100, 0.5 M NaCl (high salt), 2.5 M urea or Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5 (mock), followed by centrifugation (30 min at 100,000 × g to give a pellet (P) and supernatant (S) fraction. Molecular mass markers are indicated on the left. Panel B, a total particulate fraction of homogenized spheroplasts was digested with Endo-H giving a change in mobility of calnexin from a doublet at ∼76 60 kDa. Molecular mass markers are indicated on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The identification of Cne1p as a doublet at a molecular mass of approximately 76 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gels is higher than that expected from the predicted sequence. In order to determine if the protein was N-glycosylated, solubilized membranes were digested with Endo-H and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. This treatment resulted in an increased mobility of the protein with an apparent molecular mass of 60 kDa (Fig. 3B). This change corresponds to that predicted if all five potential sites of glycosylation were modified by the addition of core sugars ( ∼3 kDa for each site). However, the predicted molecular mass of the non-glycosylated protein is 56 kDa.Subcellular Localization of Cne1pWe determined the subcellular location of Cne1p by differential and analytical subcellular fractionation as well as by fluorescence microscopy. Differential centrifugation identified most calnexin in the large granule (ML) fraction of S. cerevisiae homogenates. The ML fraction was enriched in NADPH cytochrome c reductase activity as determined by de Duve plots which reveal the quantitative distribution of this marker enzyme for the ER (Fig. 4). Analytical centrifugation was then carried out with the ML fraction. Density gradient centrifugation revealed a similar distribution of the ER luminal protein Kar2p and Cne1p (Fig. 5). This distribution corresponded to median densities of 1.195 g/cc for both proteins (Fig. 6) which was also that of NADPH cytochrome c reductase (1.195 g/ml). However, these distributions were clearly different than those of the Golgi marker enzyme GDPase (median density 1.138 g/ml), the plasma membrane marker ATPase (median density 1.156 g/ml) and the mitochondrial marker monoamine oxidase (median density 1.177 g/ml). Cne1p is not localized to the vacuole since the antibodies for carboxypeptidase Y revealed (as determined by Western blotting 1:3000 dilution) it to be principally in the N fraction, with very little in the ML or P fractions (data not shown). Hence, the distribution of Cne1p corresponded most closely to that of the ER luminal protein Kar2p.Figure 4Comparison of the distribution of the ER marker enzyme NADPH cytochrome c reductase and Cne1p.

https://openalex.org/W2125280122,"Kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) of trypanosomatid parasites is a network of approximately 5000 catenated DNA minicircles and approximately 25 maxicircles. We developed the following strategy to deduce the topological linkage of the minicircles of the Crithidia fasciculata network. First, we used graph theory to provide precise models of possible network structures. Second, on the basis of these models, we predicted the frequencies of minicircle oligomers expected from random network breakage. Third, we determined the fragmentation pattern of kDNA networks as a function of the extent of digestion. Fourth, by comparison of the results with the predictions, we identified the model that best represents the network. We conclude that each minicircle is linked on average to three other minicircles. A honeycomb arrangement probably results, with each minicircle typically at the vertex of a hexagonal cell. This topology has implications for the assembly, structure, and function of kDNA networks."
https://openalex.org/W2067157370,"Phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues in the carboxyl-terminal region of many G-protein-coupled receptors directs the rapid uncoupling from signal transduction pathways. In Chinese hamster ovary cells, we have stably expressed a truncated mutant of the angiotensin II (AT1A) receptor devoid of the carboxyl-terminal 45 amino acids, encompassing 13 serine/threonine residues. One clone, designated TL314 to indicate truncation after leucine 314, expressed a single class of angiotensin II receptors with a dissociation constant of 1.08 nM and a receptor density of 560 fmol/mg of protein (∼75,000 receptors/cell). A nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP accelerated the angiotensin II-induced dissociation of [125I]angiotensin II from TL314 plasma membranes 3.6-fold, indicating G-protein coupling. In TL314 cells, angiotensin II stimulated the release of intracellular calcium and the induction of mitogen-activated protein kinase activity, the levels of which were comparable with the full-length AT1A receptor. The AII-stimulated calcium response was rapidly desensitized in both full-length and truncated AT1A receptors. Interestingly, angiotensin II-induced endocytosis of the truncated receptor was almost completely inhibited, suggesting that a recognition motif within the carboxyl-terminal 45 amino acids of the AT1A receptor promotes sequestration.Thus, truncation of the AT1A receptor after leucine 314 inhibits agonist-induced internalization without affecting the capacity of the expressed protein to adopt the correct conformation necessary for high affinity binding of angiotensin II, coupling to G-proteins, and activation of signal transduction pathways. The rapid desensitization and refractoriness of the angiotensin II-induced calcium transient in the TL314 cell line, in which putative carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation sites are absent, suggests that the mechanism of AT1A receptor desensitization differs from that of other prototypical G-protein-coupled receptors. Phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues in the carboxyl-terminal region of many G-protein-coupled receptors directs the rapid uncoupling from signal transduction pathways. In Chinese hamster ovary cells, we have stably expressed a truncated mutant of the angiotensin II (AT1A) receptor devoid of the carboxyl-terminal 45 amino acids, encompassing 13 serine/threonine residues. One clone, designated TL314 to indicate truncation after leucine 314, expressed a single class of angiotensin II receptors with a dissociation constant of 1.08 nM and a receptor density of 560 fmol/mg of protein (∼75,000 receptors/cell). A nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP accelerated the angiotensin II-induced dissociation of [125I]angiotensin II from TL314 plasma membranes 3.6-fold, indicating G-protein coupling. In TL314 cells, angiotensin II stimulated the release of intracellular calcium and the induction of mitogen-activated protein kinase activity, the levels of which were comparable with the full-length AT1A receptor. The AII-stimulated calcium response was rapidly desensitized in both full-length and truncated AT1A receptors. Interestingly, angiotensin II-induced endocytosis of the truncated receptor was almost completely inhibited, suggesting that a recognition motif within the carboxyl-terminal 45 amino acids of the AT1A receptor promotes sequestration. Thus, truncation of the AT1A receptor after leucine 314 inhibits agonist-induced internalization without affecting the capacity of the expressed protein to adopt the correct conformation necessary for high affinity binding of angiotensin II, coupling to G-proteins, and activation of signal transduction pathways.

PTH/PTHrP receptor mutants progressively truncated from the C terminus were expressed in COS-7 cells, and their ability to internalize 125I-PTHrP(1-34)amide was determined. Most of the C-terminal tail (91 of 127 residues) could be deleted without affecting internalization. However, further truncation removing residues 475-494 resulted in a 50-60% decrease in ligand internalization.

INTRODUCTIONIn many cell types, depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores causes compensatory influx of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane. The mechanisms that link these two events have been the subject of widespread speculation and intensive investigation(1.Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6148) Google Scholar, 2.Tsien R.W. Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 715-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 3.Irvine R.F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 4.Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar, 5.Fasolato C. Innocenti B. Pozzan T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 77-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Recently, two very different lines of experiments have suggested that empty Ca2+ stores may release a diffusible messenger that transmits a signal to the plasma membrane to activate influx pathways. We recently showed that Jurkat lymphocytes contain a soluble factor of low molecular weight that can induce Ca2+ influx when applied extracellularly to various other mammalian cell types(6.Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). This factor does not match any of a wide variety of known messengers, but seems to contain phosphate and a periodate-sensitive group. Until its chemical structure is completely defined, it is provisionally referred to as CIF 1The abbreviations used are: CIFcalcium influx factorOAokadaic acidD-PBSDulbecco's phosphate-buffered salinePHAphytohemagglutininCsAcyclosporin A.(for Ca2+ influx factor). CIF is stored in digitonin-resistant organelles of resting cells and is released into the cytoplasm upon stimulation, although pathways for synthesis and breakdown of CIF presumably also exist. Meanwhile, Parekh et al.(7.Parekh A.B. Terlau H. Stühmer W. Nature. 1993; 364: 814-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) reported that in Xenopus oocytes, depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores caused Ca2+ influx, measured indirectly as a Ca2+-activated Cl− current. If the patch of plasma membrane was ripped off the oocyte, the current immediately disappeared, but could be reactivated if the patch was reinserted into the oocyte cytoplasm, as if the cytoplasm contained a soluble ligand that activated the influx. The current could be enhanced by okadaic acid (OA), an inhibitor usually considered specific for protein phosphatases 1 and 2A(8.Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar).The enhancement found by Parekh et al.(7.Parekh A.B. Terlau H. Stühmer W. Nature. 1993; 364: 814-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) might be attributed to an effect of OA on various stages between the emptying of the Ca2+ stores and the activation of the Ca2+-activated Cl− channels. To decide whether something like CIF is involved in this effect, an obvious experiment is to test in intact mammalian cells whether OA and other phosphatase inhibitors can enhance Ca2+ entry, activated either by depletion of endogenous Ca2+ stores or by application of exogenous CIF. If so, then one could test more directly in vitro the tempting hypothesis that cells possess enzymes that degrade CIF, but are directly or indirectly inhibited by OA. Inhibition of such enzymes could then lead to an increase in CIF concentration, which would provide a mechanism for potentiating Ca2+ influx, but would not exclude other possible effects of OA. Attempts to prevent breakdown could give valuable hints about the metabolism of CIF even while its detailed structure remains the subject of separate investigations.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and [Ca2+]i Measurements1321N1 astrocytoma cells and Jurkat lymphocytes were grown as described previously(6.Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Astrocytoma cells were plated on coverslips 1 day before experiments. Astrocytoma and Jurkat cells were loaded with 300 and 500 nM fura-2/AM, respectively, for 30 min. The usual medium for [Ca2+]i measurements was Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS) with 1 mM CaCl2, 11 mM glucose, and 20 mM HEPES. [Ca2+]i measurements were performed with an IMSTAR imaging system (9.Donnadieu E. Bismuth G. Trautmann A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 584-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and are averages of 10 cells in the same field, sampled at 5-s intervals. Integrated responses were measured as the area of the average [Ca2+]i increase during the 6-8 min after stimulation. For histograms, individual values correspond to different dishes. To pool results from different experiments, averages were expressed as percent of control values. Averages are given ±S.E. Values have been statistically compared using Student's t test with p < 0.05 as the criterion for significance.ChemicalsOkadaic acid (Na+ salt), 1-norokadaone, and calyculin A were from LC Laboratories; fura-2/AM was from Molecular Probes, Inc.; carbachol, PHA, and D-PBS were from Sigma; thapsigargin was from Calbiochem; and cyclosporin A was from Sandoz.Cell Extract PreparationFor experiments presented in Fig. 1, cell extract was prepared by acidic treatment of unstimulated Jurkat cells as described previously(6.Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar), except that the pH of D-PBS was adjusted with 300 mM NaOH or HCl, fatty acid-free albumin was not added, and treatment with hexokinase was omitted because astrocytoma cells were insensitive to ATP. The extract was passed through a small reverse-phase silica cartridge (C18 SPICE, Rainin Instrument Co. Inc.) for a quick cleanup before pH neutralization and 4-8-fold dilution into the medium containing astrocytoma cells.For in vitro degradation experiments, Jurkat lymphocytes (0.3-ml packed volume) were stimulated with PHA (20 μg/ml) for 10 min in 1 ml of the following medium: 145 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 5 mM HEPES, 1 mM MgCl2, and no added Ca2+. The cells were then sonicated for 2.5 min (Deltasonic 011C) and finally centrifuged. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was isolated, aliquoted, and kept at room temperature (22−25°C) for different periods of time to allow degradation of CIF activity. Incubations were terminated by rapid freezing. In some runs, okadaic acid (500 nM), cyclosporin A (CsA; 1 μM), or EGTA (1 mM) was added to the samples at the beginning of the incubation period. (The OA and CsA concentrations were set higher than in the intact cell experiments because the sonicated homogenates were derived from much more concentrated cell suspensions.) The same inhibitor concentrations were then added to other aliquots at the end of the incubation period, just before freezing, so that each pair of samples would have the same final composition of additives. For [Ca2+]i measurements, 150 μl of extract were rapidly thawed and added to astrocytoma cells in 450 μl of standard medium with 1 mM Ca2+.RESULTSPhosphatase Inhibitors Potentiate [Ca2+]i Increases Induced by Low Doses of CIFThe effect of OA was first tested with cell extract, which had previously been shown to induce only Ca2+ influx in astrocytoma cells(6.Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). We used threshold concentrations of cell extract, adjusted to give no or only small [Ca2+]i increases by themselves. The addition of OA (50 nM) then produced an immediate further increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1A). This effect resulted from a potentiation of divalent cation entry when assayed by accelerated influx of Mn2+ (data not shown). OA alone (up to 500 nM) did not affect the basal [Ca2+]i level (data not shown). On the other hand, higher sustained [Ca2+]i increases produced by larger concentrations of cell extract were not augmented by 100 nM okadaic acid (Fig. 1B).OA has been described as a specific inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 (EC50 = 20 nM) and 2A (EC 50 = 0.2 nM), the EC 50 for protein phosphatase 2C being much higher (5 μM)(8.Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar). Several structurally unrelated phosphatase inhibitors with different specificities were tested on the response to threshold concentrations of CIF. CsA (100 nM), whose complex with cyclophilin specifically inhibits calcineurin (protein phosphatase 2B)(10.Liu J. Farmer J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar), was comparable to OA (Fig. 1C) at potentiating [Ca2+]i increases. Calyculin A (50 nM), which inhibits protein phosphatase 1 as well as protein phosphatase 2A(11.Cohen P. Holmes C.F.B. Tsukitani Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 98-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar), was also as effective as OA (data not shown). However, this concentration of calyculin A seemed to be highly toxic because the cells developed blebs within a few minutes. For this reason, calyculin A was not further studied.The potentiating effects of these inhibitors were equally evident if OA (100 nM) or CsA (1 μM) was added 3 min before the submaximal dose of Jurkat extract. 1-Norokadaone, a structural analogue of OA unable to inhibit protein phosphatases(12.Nishiwaki S. Fujiki H. Suganuma M. Furuya-Suguri H. Matsushima R. Ida Y. Ojika M. Yamada K. Uemura D. Yasumoto T. Schmitz F. Sugimura T. Carcinogenesis (Lond.). 1990; 11: 1837-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), was also tested as a control for nonspecific effects. Fig. 1D shows that OA and CsA amplified the [Ca2+]i response by a factor of ∼3. Both were statistically different from the control without inhibitors. 1-Norokadaone even at 500 nM did not produce a statistically significant potentiation.Phosphatase Inhibitors Potentiate [Ca2+]i Increases Induced by Low Concentrations of Carbachol or Thapsigargin Acting on Astrocytes or Phytohemagglutinin on LymphocytesIf conventional agonists that deplete intracellular Ca2+ stores use endogenous CIF to trigger Ca2+ entry, those latter responses should also be enhanced by OA and CsA. Low concentrations of carbachol (1 μM) or thapsigargin (1 nM) only partially emptied the Ca2+ stores; the subsequent sustained [Ca2+]i increases were likewise submaximal. The effects of phosphatase inhibitors were tested in experiments similar to those presented in Fig. 1C. As presented in Fig. 2A, the response to 1 nM thapsigargin (dashedline) was increased by 3 min of incubation with OA (solidline). The [Ca2+]i increases induced by the above low doses of carbachol (Fig. 2B) or thapsigargin (Fig. 2C) were clearly potentiated by OA (100 nM) and CsA (1 μM). These values were statistically different from the control. OA and CsA did not affect the responses to high concentrations of carbachol or thapsigargin (data not shown). Contrary to what has been reported for long-term treatment of HeLa cells with high doses of OA(13.Berlin R.D. Preston S.F. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we never observed OA to inhibit Ca2+ influx in astrocytes.Figure 2Protein phosphatase inhibitors potentiate the [Ca2+] i responses to low doses of carbachol and thapsigargin. Fura-2-loaded astrocytoma cells were stimulated with 1 nM thapsigargin (TG; A and C) or 1 μM carbachol (CCh; B) either under control conditions (CTL; no pretreatment) or after 3 min of incubation with 100 nM OA or 1 μM CsA. An example of such experiment is presented in A. Pooled results resulting from three independent experiments are shown in B and C. Individual response magnitudes have been normalized to the control. For each condition, values have been integrated from 0 to 6-8 min after cell extract addition and correspond to the mean of 10-12 individual dishes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Such potentiations of threshold stimuli are not restricted to astrocytoma cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, responses of Jurkat lymphocytes to a low dose of phytohemagglutinin (5 μg/ml), a classic phosphoinositide-mobilizing agonist, are greatly potentiated by subsequent addition of 100 nM OA. This dose of OA by itself did not elevate [Ca2+]i above resting levels (data not shown).Figure 3Okadaic acid increases CIF concentration in PHA-stimulated Jurkat T cells. A, fura-2-loaded Jurkat cells were stimulated with 5 μg/ml PHA (firstdashedline). OA (100 nM each) was added twice (second and third dashedlines). B, acidic extract was prepared from Jurkat T cells stimulated with 5 μg/ml PHA in the absence (control (CTL)) or presence of 500 nM OA for 15 min. The same amount of OA was added to the control cells just before centrifugation to equalize OA carryover. [Ca2+] i elevations measured in fura-2-loaded astrocytoma cells were normalized to the mean of the control. Each point corresponds to the mean of seven dishes from two independent experiments. The difference is statistically significant to p < 0.05 (Student's t test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These results show that the response to threshold concentrations of CIF, either exogenously applied or endogenously released from the Ca2+ stores, is synergistically potentiated by protein phosphatase inhibitors. Two main explanations can be proposed, which are not mutually exclusive. Either OA and CsA enhance the sensitivity to CIF of its targets, for example the Ca2+ channels, or they directly increase CIF concentration, for example by inhibiting its degradation in the cytoplasm. To begin to discriminate between these two possibilities, experiments were designed to test whether OA affected CIF concentrations in intact cells and in cell-free homogenates. Such experiments were performed with Jurkat lymphocytes because such nonadherent cells were much easier than astrocytoma cells to culture in the necessary large quantity and high density.Okadaic Acid Induces an Increase in CIF Concentration in Stimulated Jurkat LymphocytesTo test whether OA can increase the amount of CIF activity extractable from intact cells, the lymphocytes (0.3-ml packed volume) were stimulated for 15 min with 5 μg/ml PHA in 1 ml of Ca2+-free medium in the presence or absence of 500 nM OA. To equalize any carryover of OA onto the astrocytoma cells used to assay CIF, the same concentration of OA was added to the control lymphocytes for 1-2 min before both samples were centrifuged. Each pellet was then resuspended as usual in 1 ml of acid to disrupt the cells and to stop metabolism. The extracts were neutralized after 15 min and assayed for CIF activity. As shown in Fig. 3B, the CIF content was statistically higher in cells stimulated in the presence of okadaic acid compared with the control. A greater difference between both conditions might have been obtained by using larger doses of PHA or OA to compensate for the very high cell density and probable depletion of PHA and OA from the initial incubation medium. Nevertheless, this result provides evidence that OA at least modestly increases the amount of CIF in weakly stimulated intact cells. The possibility that OA may inhibit CIF degradation was more directly investigated by in vitro experiments.Phosphatase Inhibitors Inhibit Degradation of CIF in VitroTo see whether CIF can be degraded by cellular constituents, cell extracts were prepared by ultrasonic disruption of lymphocytes that had been stimulated for 10 min with PHA in a medium lacking inorganic phosphate and Ca2+. Sonication, unlike our usual acidic extraction, should preserve the activity of enzymes that might synthesize or degrade CIF. The extract from sonicated cells was held for varying periods at room temperature and then rapidly frozen and eventually assayed on astrocytes. As shown in Fig. 4A, the activity initially present in the cell extract rapidly decreased upon standing, showing that CIF can be degraded under these in vitro conditions. Most of the decline took place in the first 3 min after extract isolation, after which the activity then leveled off around 50% of its initial value. The time to reach plateau varied in different experiments from 1.5 to 3 min.Figure 4Time course and pharmacology of CIF degradation in vitro. A, cell extract was prepared from sonicated Jurkat lymphocytes and kept for variable times (shown on the abscissa) at room temperature. Degradation was stopped by freezing. Each ordinate is the mean of 12-27 [Ca2+] i increases in astrocytoma cells in response to equal dilutions of the incubated extract from three to six independent experiments. Values have been normalized to those obtained with no added incubation time before freezing. B, cell extract activity was measured for 0 or 5 min of incubation under control conditions (CTL) or for 5 min with 500 nM OA, 1 μM CsA, or 1 mM EGTA. Values have been normalized as described for A. Each bar corresponds to the mean of 7-18 dishes from two to three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The pharmacology of the degradation (Fig. 4B) was then investigated using the above protocol, but with drugs added just before versus after room temperature incubation for 5 min. This mode of comparison ensured that the same amount of drug was carried over into the assay on the responder astrocytes. As in Fig. 4A, ∼50% of the initial activity remained after 5 min at room temperature with no inhibitors added. However, the presence of OA (500 nM) or CsA (1 μM) during incubation completely prevented net degradation. Because calcineurin has been reported to be sensitive to Ca2+ and calmodulin(8.Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar), the effect of Ca2+ deprivation on CIF degradation was also tested. For all the in vitro experiments presented above, Ca2+ was not buffered and was probably several μM. The addition of EGTA (1 mM) at the beginning of the incubation also completely abolished the run-down of CIF activity. The activities left after 5 min of incubation in the presence of OA, CsA, or EGTA were all statistically different from the incubation without additives, but similar to the initial activity before incubation.DISCUSSIONThe aim of this study was to determine whether phosphatases control Ca2+ influx in mammalian cells and are implicated in metabolic inactivation of a putative messenger mediating Ca2+ influx. Our results show that protein phosphatase inhibitors potentiate Ca2+ influx during submaximal stimulation via conventional receptors in the plasma membrane, by thapsigargin blockade of endoplasmic reticulum pumps, or by direct application of CIF. CIF assays examining the effects of phosphatase inhibitors in intact cells or sonicated homogenates suggest that this potentiation can be at least partly explained as an increase in CIF concentration due to prevention of CIF degradation, which is also Ca2+-dependent. We doubt that phosphatase inhibitors act mainly by stimulating CIF synthesis because it would be surprising if such stimulation so exactly canceled the degradation observed under control conditions. However, we cannot exclude that mechanisms other than protection of CIF contribute in intact cells to the potentiation of the [Ca2+]i response. Furthermore, because CIF activity was assayed in a crude cell extract rather than as a purified single species, the present results cannot yet exclude the possibility that these modulations involve more than one interacting molecular species in the extract.Several points still remain unclear. First, the molecular targets of OA and CsA are not identified. These drugs have been reported to be specific inhibitors of protein phosphatases(8.Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar, 14.Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1947) Google Scholar). However, current evidence indicates that CIF is a small nonprotein factor. Several possibilities can be proposed to reconcile those two points. 1) Protein phosphatases could dephosphorylate and activate a CIF-degrading enzyme, which might or might not itself be a phosphatase. Because OA and CsA are not supposed to act on the same protein phosphatase, one would presume that the CIF-degrading enzyme is sensitive to protein phosphatase 1 (or protein phosphatase 2A) and to protein phosphatase 2B. A more complex cascade can also be proposed where this enzyme would be dephosphorylated only by protein phosphatase 1 and where protein phosphatase 2B would modulate the activity of protein phosphatase 1 by dephosphorylating inhibitor-1. 2) Dephosphorylations of nonprotein substrates by protein phosphatases 1 and 2B have been reported(15.Ballou L.M. Fisher E.H. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. XVII. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1986: 311-361Google Scholar). However, these observations result from in vitro experiments, not yet in intact cells. 3) Finally, it is possible that OA as well as CsA are able to inhibit enzymes or phosphatases other than protein phosphatases. Although other defined phosphatases so far tested are insensitive to these agents, one cannot exclude that such a phosphatase could exist. Whatever are the relevant immediate targets of OA and CsA, our results in intact cells suggest that enzymes involved in CIF degradation are active in unstimulated cells or at least at resting [Ca2+]i levels.CIF degradation can be demonstrated in a cell-free homogenate, always appearing within the first 3 min after extraction and never proceeding beyond 60% reduction of the initial activity. Because the degradation can be blocked by OA, CsA, or EGTA, it probably results from an enzymatic process and not from a spontaneous breakdown of CIF, which is stable in the absence of proteins(6.Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). The inability to degrade more than 60% of the initial activity could be due to run-down of the enzyme(s) involved after cell disruption, so that CIF molecules that have not been metabolized in the first few minutes will never be. Because no reducing agents were added to the extract, one possible inactivation mechanism could be oxidation. Another possibility is that some fresh synthesis of CIF takes place in parallel to CIF degradation. Two observations argue in favor of this latter hypothesis. In the presence of EGTA, the activity after 5 min of incubation seemed to be even greater than at time 0, as if the concentration of CIF had increased. Even without inhibitors, CIF activity seems to increase slightly after its initial decline. This augmentation varied from one experiment to another and may reflect a delayed appearance of fresh CIF in the extract. The pharmacology of the synthesis has not been yet established. In intact stimulated cells, Ca2+ influx can last for minutes or hours, suggesting that if degradation events take place, they have to be balanced by the appearance of CIF in the cytoplasm. Under our cell-free conditions, with enough Ca2+ to allow microsomal stores to refill, degradation is presumably somewhat favored compared with synthesis.In these in vitro experiments, ∼2-3 min were required for a 50% loss of activity. This value appears to be high compared with shorter values that have been reported in the literature for the decline of the Ca2+ influx after Ca2+ store refilling (e.g. see (16.Montero M. Alvarez J. Garcia-Sancho J. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)). Perhaps our in vitro conditions are not optimal for enzymatic degradation. Simple dilution in preparing the homogenate would tend to slow enzymatic reactions. However, CIF degradation by phosphatases might not be the only mechanism to remove CIF from the cytoplasm when Ca2+ stores are allowed to refill. Reuptake of CIF into its organellar storage sites (perhaps the endoplasmic reticulum) may also contribute. Phosphatase action may be more important during cell stimulation for adjusting the concentration of CIF and the amplitude of Ca2+ influx especially for submaximal conditions of stimulation. Indeed, with saturating doses of carbachol, thapsigargin, or cell extract, the Ca2+ response was not modified by protein phosphatase inhibitors. Furthermore, because CIF degradation seems to be very Ca2+-dependent, phosphatases may play a role in negative feedback induced by [Ca2+]i on Ca2+ influx, which has been observed in many cell types with a time course compatible to the degradation observed here (17.Lewis R.S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 5817-5823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). INTRODUCTIONIn many cell types, depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores causes compensatory influx of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane. The mechanisms that link these two events have been the subject of widespread speculation and intensive investigation(1.Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6148) Google Scholar, 2.Tsien R.W. Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 715-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 3.Irvine R.F.

Pozzan T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 77-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Recently, two very different lines of experiments have suggested that empty Ca2+ stores may release a diffusible messenger that transmits a signal to the plasma membrane to activate influx pathways. We recently showed that Jurkat lymphocytes contain a soluble factor of low molecular weight that can induce Ca2+ influx when applied extracellularly to various other mammalian cell types(6.Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). This factor does not match any of a wide variety of known messengers, but seems to contain phosphate and a periodate-sensitive group. Until its chemical structure is completely defined, it is provisionally referred to as CIF 1The abbreviations used are: CIFcalcium influx factorOAokadaic acidD-PBSDulbecco's phosphate-buffered salinePHAphytohemagglutininCsAcyclosporin A.(for Ca2+ influx factor). CIF is stored in digitonin-resistant organelles of resting cells and is released into the cytoplasm upon stimulation, although pathways for synthesis and breakdown of CIF presumably also exist. Meanwhile, Parekh et al.(7.Parekh A.B. Terlau H. Stühmer W. Nature. 1993; 364: 814-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) reported that in Xenopus oocytes, depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores caused Ca2+ influx, measured indirectly as a Ca2+-activated Cl− current. If the patch of plasma membrane was ripped off the oocyte, the current immediately disappeared, but could be reactivated if the patch was reinserted into the oocyte cytoplasm, as if the cytoplasm contained a soluble ligand that activated the influx. The current could be enhanced by okadaic acid (OA), an inhibitor usually considered specific for protein phosphatases 1 and 2A(8.Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar).The enhancement found by Parekh et al.(7.Parekh A.B. Terlau H. Stühmer W. Nature. 1993; 364: 814-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) might be attributed to an effect of OA on various stages between the emptying of the Ca2+ stores and the activation of the Ca2+-activated Cl− channels. To decide whether something like CIF is involved in this effect, an obvious experiment is to test in intact mammalian cells whether OA and other phosphatase inhibitors can enhance Ca2+ entry, activated either by depletion of endogenous Ca2+ stores or by application of exogenous CIF. If so, then one could test more directly in vitro the tempting hypothesis that cells possess enzymes that degrade CIF, but are directly or indirectly inhibited by OA. Inhibition of such enzymes could then lead to an increase in CIF concentration, which would provide a mechanism for potentiating Ca2+ influx, but would not exclude other possible effects of OA. Attempts to prevent breakdown could give valuable hints about the metabolism of CIF even while its detailed structure remains the subject of separate investigations."

In the present study, we examined further the potential functional coupling of G-proteins with the human M6P/IGF II receptor and mutant receptors lacking the proposed G-protein activator sequence. IGF II treatment of mouse L-cells expressing either wild type or mutant M6P/IGF II receptors failed to attenuate the pertussis toxin-catalyzed modification of a 40-kDa protein or enhance GTPase activity. In broken L-cell membranes expressing wild type or mutant M6P/IGF II receptors, 30 nM IGF II also failed to affect the pertussis toxin substrate activity. By using phospholipid vesicles reconstituted with human wild type or mutant M6P/IGF II receptors and pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins, no stimulation of GTP γS binding to or GTPase activity of Gi2, Go1, or Gi/Go mixtures were observed in response to 1 μM IGF II. Furthermore, in vesicles containing purified wild type M6P/IGF II receptors and monomeric Gαo1 or Gαi2 and βγ dimers no effects of IGF II on GTP γS binding could be detected. However, when vesicles reconstituted with M6P/IGF II receptors and Gi2 proteins were incubated with 100 μM mastoparan GTP γS binding was stimulated and GTPase activity was increased significantly. These results indicate that the human M6P/IGF II receptor neither interacts with G-proteins in mouse L-cell membranes nor is coupled to Gi2 proteins in phospholipid vesicles.

INTRODUCTIONCholesterol biosynthesis is a complex biological process(1.Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4500) Google Scholar, 2.Rudney H. Panini R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1993; 4: 230-237Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and it provides a therapeutic target for the reduction of low density lipoprotein cholesterol, a key risk factor in coronary heart disease (3.Steinberg D. Atheroscler. Rev. 1988; 18: 1-23Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed a post-mevalonate pathway of cholesterol biosynthesis that plays an important role in the supply of obligate precursors for dolichol, ubiquinone and isopentenyl tRNA synthesis, and for polyprenylation of p21ras(4.Glomset J.A. Gelb M.H. Farnsworth C.C. Trends Biochem. Soc. 1993; 4: 230-237Google Scholar) and small GTP-binding proteins(5.Gibbs J.B.

Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4500) Google Scholar). As a result, three enzymes which are located beyond branch point in this pathway, namely squalene synthase, squalene epoxidase (SE), 1The abbreviations used are: SEsqualene epoxidasePCRpolymerase chain reactionDTTdithiothreitolbpbase pair(s).and oxidosqualene cyclase, have evoked considerable interest as potential targets for the design of hypercholesterolemic chemotherapeutics(6.Ryder N.S.

SE appears to be an important rate-limiting enzyme in this cascade, as it has an extremely low specific activity compared to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase or squalene synthase (8.Hidaka Y.

Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 2095-2101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the addition of exogenous cholesterol to human renal cancer cells results in the accumulation of squalene(10.Gonzalez R. Carlson J.P. Dempsey M.E. Arch. Biochim. Biophys. 1979; 196: 574-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).SE (EC 1.14.99.7) catalyzes the first oxygenation step in the sterol biosynthetic pathway, the conversion of squalene to 2,3(S)-oxidosqualene. It has been reported, however, that not only 2,3(S)-oxidosqualene but also 2,3(S);22(S),23-squalene diepoxide is accumulated in liver homogenates (11.Nelson J.A. Czarny M.R. Spencer T.A. Limanek J.S.

Consequently, it would be interesting to know whether SE is involved in the synthesis of such oxysterols via squalene dioxide formation(16.Spencer T.A. Acc. Chem. Res. 1994; 27: 83-90Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar).SE is believed to be a microsomal membrane-bound protein. Rat SE requires FAD, NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase (EC 1.6.2.4), NADPH, and a supernatant protein factor for its activity(17.Yamamoto S. Bloch K. J. Biol.

It is the only non-cytochrome P-450 enzyme that epoxidizes a double bond in an alkyl chain(24.Richard D.S. Applebaum S.W. Sliter T.J. Baker F.C. Schooley D.A. Reuters C.C. Henrich V.C. Gilbert L.I.

The rat kidney-derived cell line (NRK) cDNA library (cDNAs were inserted into pcD2) and the plasmid pAL17 were kindly provided by Dr. H. Okayama and Dr. A.

Okayama H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 18: 6485-6489Crossref Scopus (389) Google Scholar), except for the following modifications. JY266 was incubated for 2 days on YEA plates at 32°C. About 108 cells were inoculated into 100 ml of MB medium supplemented with 150 μg/ml leucine and grown to a density of 5 × 106/ml with moderate shaking at 23°C. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were washed with distilled water, and 108 cells were suspended in 100 μl of 0.1 M lithium acetate (pH 4.9) for 1 h at 23°C. Fifteen μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), containing 2 μg of rat cDNA library and 1 μg of PstI-digested pAL17, and 290 μl of 50% polyethylene glycol 4000 were mixed and incubated for 1 h at 30°C. The cells were then heat-shocked by incubating for 15 min at 43°C and centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 2 min. The cell pellet was suspended in 1/2YEL medium and incubated for 2 h at 23°C. Cells were pelleted again by centrifugation, suspended in MB medium (not supplemented with leucine), and shaken at 23°C overnight. The cells were then spread on MMA plates containing 12.5 μg/ml terbinafine in the absence of leucine and incubated for 1 week at 32°C. Terbinafine-resistant clones were isolated and plasmids were recovered according to the method of Okazaki et al.(26.Okazaki K. Okazaki N. Kume K. Jinno S. Tanaka K. Okayama H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 18: 6485-6489Crossref Scopus (389) Google Scholar).DNA Sequencing and Computer AnalysisThe cloned plasmid DNA was digested with BamHI, and the recovered insert was ligated into the BamHI site of pUC18 (pUCTb1). pUCTb1 was sequenced in both directions using a Sequenase kit (U.S. Biochem Corp.). DNA sequence data were organized and analyzed using the program Gene Works (IntelliGenetics, Inc.)Expression of Recombinant Rat SE in E. coliWe synthesized two primers, 5′-GAATTCCATATGTGGACTTTTCTTGGAAT-3′ and 5′-GAATTCGGATCCTCAGTGAACCAGATACTTCA-3′, which contain the sequences corresponding to amino acids 1-6 and 568-573 of rat SE, respectively. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out using these primers and pUCTb1 as template. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and NdeI, and this fragment was ligated into the BamHI-NdeI large fragment of pET3a(27.Rosenberg A.H. Lade B.N. Chui D.S. Lin S.W. Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 56: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). This expression vector (pETRSE) was sequenced and introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3). Transformants containing control vector (pET3a) or pETRSE were grown at 37°C in LB medium to an optical density of 0.5 at 600 nm and isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside was added to 0.4 mM for induction. After a 1.5-h incubation, cells were harvested and SE enzymatic activity was assayed.Enzymatic Assay for SES and P fractions from E. coli lysates were prepared as follows. Cells collected from a 250-ml culture were suspended in 12.5 ml of buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.4 M NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM DTT) containing 1 mg/ml lysozyme for 1 h on ice. This suspension was frozen and thawed twice and adjusted to a final concentration of 1 mM EDTA and 0.5% Triton X-100. Next the suspension was sonicated and centrifuged at 5,000 × g. The supernatant was used as the S fraction. The pellet was dissolved in 5 ml of urea buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 6 M urea, 5% glycerol, 50 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM DTT), and incubated on ice for 2 h. The suspension was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h, and the supernatant dialyzed with buffer A and used as the P fraction in the following assay. Assay mixtures contained 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.01 mM FAD, 0.2 unit of NADPH-cytochrome c (P-450) reductase, 0.01 mM [14C]squalene (dispersed with the aid of 20 μl of Tween 80), 0.2% Triton X-100, and 1 mM NADPH in a total volume of 0.5 ml. The NADPH was added to initiate the reaction. Mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The nonsaponifiable lipids were analyzed by silica gel TLC developed with ethyl acetate/benzene (0.5:99.5, v/v) as described previously(20.Ono T. Imai Y. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 110: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).Immunoblotting Analysis of SECrude extracts from rat liver microsomes and a partially purified SE fraction from the extract were prepared as described previously(28.Ono T. Nakazono K. Kosaka H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 709: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Antibodies against rat SE were produced by immunizing rabbits with a bacterially produced His6-tagged protein consisting of amino acids 100-573 of rat SE. The fusion protein was constructed in the pET3a vector. An initiator methionine and 6 consecutive histidine residues were placed at the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal ends, respectively, of the PCR-generated rat SE sequence. The protein was expressed in E. coli and purified on a Ni-NTA-agarose column according to the instructions supplied by the manufacturer (Qiagen). Antiserum against rat SE was used at a 1:1000 dilution after antibodies against bacterial proteins were absorbed by bacterial proteins conjugated to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad).For immunoblot analysis, the antibody was visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Life Technologies, Inc.), using Renaissance Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (DuPont NEN) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Gels were calibrated with prestained low range molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIsolation of Rat SE cDNAOur cloning strategy for rat SE employed a trans-complementation method in yeast. The yeast SE is specifically inhibited by the antimycotic agent terbinafine, so that yeast do not survive in its presence (Fig. 1). Mammalian SE is scarcely inhibited by terbinafine. In order to express the mammalian cDNA library in S. pombe, we used a method developed by Okazaki et al.(26.Okazaki K. Okazaki N. Kume K. Jinno S. Tanaka K. Okayama H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 18: 6485-6489Crossref Scopus (389) Google Scholar). A rat NRK cDNA library constructed with the pcD2 vector, which is driven by an SV40 promoter, was introduced into S. pombe. S. pombe allows transcription, splicing, and polyadenylation of inserted mammalian cDNAs. To suppress recombination and stabilize the plasmid in yeast, S. pombe was co-transformed with the cDNA library and PstI-digested pAL17, which contains an S. pombe-derived autonomously replicating sequence and the LEU2 gene. The two plasmids form a co-polymer DNA in the transformed cells. After screening 7 × 105 colonies of transformants in the presence of terbinafine, we isolated two terbinafine-resistant clones. To examine whether the terbinafine resistance was due to exogenous plasmid DNA or to mutations in the S. pombe chromosome, the plasmids were recovered from the clones and again transformed into S. pombe. Transformants containing one of the two plasmids survived again in the presence of terbinafine. The ability of transformants to grow in the presence of either terbinafine and/or NB-598, specific inhibitors of fungal and mammalian SE, respectively, was then tested (Fig. 2). The transformants survived in the presence of either terbinafine or NB598 but not in the presence of both terbinafine and NB-598. They must express, therefore, not only fungal SE but also rat SE.Figure 2Sensitivities of S. pombe transformants for inhibitors of SE. Transformants were grown on leucine-deficient MMA plates supplemented with nothing (Control), terbinafine (+Tb), NB598 (+NB), and both terbinafine and NB598 (+Tb•+NB). Terbinafine and NB 598 concentration was 12.5 μg/ml.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Structure of Rat SEWe determined the nucleotide sequence of the rat SE cDNA. The 2199-bp cDNA contains a 5′ non-coding region of 199 bp, an open reading frame of 1719 bp and a 3′ non-coding region of 281 bp. A polyadenylation signal precedes the 3′-terminal poly(A) sequence by 20 bp. The long 5′ non-coding sequence and the presence of a poly(A) tail suggest that this clone contains almost the entire cDNA sequence. An in-frame stop codon is located 3 nucleotides upstream of the first ATG in the open reading frame. The sequence surrounding this ATG matches well the Kozak consensus translation initiation sequence (29.Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8131Crossref PubMed Scopus (4151) Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that this ATG functions as the initiation codon. The deduced protein sequence consists of 573 amino acids with a molecular mass of 63,950 Da (Fig. 3).Figure 3Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the predicted rat liver and yeast SE. Amino acid residues are numbered on the left. R and Y stand for rat and yeast (S. cerevisiae) SE, respectively. Residues identical in rat and yeast SE are boxed. The hydrophobic region Leu27-Tyr43, which is predicted to be a membrane associated domain, is underlined with a singleline.

Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 175: 105-132Crossref Scopus (17007) Google Scholar), revealed one possible transmembrane domain in the NH2-terminal portion (Leu27-Tyr43) of the protein. This domain consists of 70% hydrophobic residues, which could be sufficient to anchor the protein in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum(31.Bretscher M.S. Munro S. Science. 1993; 261: 1280-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 32.Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. Goldman A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 321-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar).As shown in Fig. 4, there is a β1-αA-β2 motif (33.Wierenga R.K. Terpstra P. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar) in both rat SE (Val125-Glu152) and S. cerevisiae SE (Ala21-Glu48) that demonstrates significant homology with the FAD binding domains of human erythrocyte glutathione reductase (33.Wierenga R.K. Terpstra P. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar) and Pseudomonas fluorescensp-hydroxybenzoic acid hydroxylase(34.Schulz G.E. Schrimer R.H. Pai E.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 160: 287-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The presence of a consensus FAD binding domain sequence is consistent with data suggesting that rat SE requires exogenous FAD for its activity (19.Ono T. Bloch K. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1571-1579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and strongly suggests that SE is directly associated with FAD.Figure 4Putative FAD binding site sequences of SE.

Turnowsky F. Hogenauer G. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 107: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The FASTA search algorithm of the GenPept data bank showed that the deduced protein sequence of rat SE is 30.2% (173/573) identical to that of allylamine-resistant S. cerevisiae SE (Fig. 3). The rat SE contains 77 additional amino acids compared to the S. cerevisiae SE. In addition, the amino acid composition of rat SE is considerably more basic than yeast SE. The S. cerevisiae SE sequence begins at Glu105 of the rat SE, but includes a stretch of 31 amino acids (Lys106-Asp136) not present in the rat SE. It is interesting that S. cerevisiae SE lacks the putative transmembrane domain located in the NH2-terminal region of rat SE. This suggests that S. cerevisiae and rat SE are associated with the endoplasmic reticulum in different manners.Expression of Rat SE cDNA in Escherichia coliWe selected E. coli for expression of the isolated cDNA, since this bacterium does not synthesize 2,3-oxidosqualene or sterols in general. The expression vector pETRSE, which contains the entire coding region of rat SE downstream of the bacteriophage T7 promoter, was used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3). S and P fractions (see “Experimental Procedures”) of E. coli lysates were prepared from control vector (pET3a) or pETRSE containing transformants, and assayed for SE activity. As shown in Fig. 5A, negligible activity was detected in the S and P fractions from a pET3a containing transformant (A, lanes 1 and 2), but significant SE activity was observed in the S fraction from a pETRSE transformant (A, lane3). These data clearly demonstrate that the isolated cDNA encodes a functional SE and, therefore, that rat SE is encoded by a single polypeptide chain.Figure 5Identification of SE activity of recombinant rat SE and immunoblotting analysis of recombinant and native rat SE. A, cell extracts were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Partially purified rat liver SE and cell extracts were incubated with [14C]squalene for 30 min at 37°C in the presence of 0.2 unit of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, 1 mM NADPH, 0.01 mM FAD, and 0.3% Triton X-100. Total nonsaponifiable substances were applied to thin-layer chromatography plates, which were developed with 0.5% ethyl acetate/benzene and detected autoradiographically. The migration of standard compounds on the plate is indicated by arrows. The samples shown are: lanes1 and 2, S and P fractions, respectively, from control vector pET3a-transformed E. coli; lanes3 and 4, S and P fractions, respectively, from rat SE expression vector pETRSE-transformed E. coli. B, 20 μg of fractions, described in panel A, were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel in the same lanes as in panel A. They were blotted electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose membrane and analyzed immunochemically with anti-recombinant rat SE antiserum as mentioned under “Experimental Procedures.” C, 30 μg of partially purified SE fraction from rat liver (lane1) and crude extract from rat liver microsomes (lane2) were analyzed immunochemically as in panelB. The samples were prepared as described previously(28.Ono T. Nakazono K. Kosaka H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 709: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In order to confirm the expression of rat SE protein in the transformants, we performed an immunoassay using an antiserum against the purified recombinant Glu100-His573 fragment of rat SE expressed in E. coli. Although this fragment excluded the plausible membrane binding domain, it did contain the SE activity. As shown in Fig. 5B, a 64-kDa immunoreactive protein was present in both the S and P fractions of a pETRSE containing transformant (B, lanes 3 and 4). We also detected a truncated protein in the P fraction and small fragments in the S fraction. In spite of the existence of the immunoreactive protein, the P fraction did not show any SE activity (Fig. 5A, lane 4). This might be caused by insufficient renaturation by dialysis after solubilization of particulates with urea buffer.Only a single immunoreactive protein, with relative molecular mass of 64 kDa, was detected in rat liver microsomes (Fig. 5C, lane2). Although the partially purified SE fraction from rat liver also contained an immunoreactive protein of 64 kDa, two other immunoreactive proteins of 57 and 51 kDa were detected. These results suggest that the molecular mass of rat SE is 64 kDa, and that a 51-kDa protein previously identified as rat SE (28.Ono T. Nakazono K. Kosaka H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 709: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) is most likely a truncated form of the enzyme produced by proteolysis during the purification procedure.Both the recombinant rat SE and the partially purified SE from rat liver lost activity when Triton X-100 was absent during purification. Recombinant rat SE behaves as a multimeric aggregate during gel filtration in the absence of Triton X-100. Enzymatic activation by Triton X-100 at a concentration greater than its critical micelle concentration, in the presence of 1 mM DTT, suggests that the monomer is the active form of the enzyme. However, there are a number of alternative explanations for the Triton X-100 activation, such as a conformational change of the enzyme, an increased rate of enzyme diffusion or association of enzyme and substrate, and effects on enzyme kinetic parameters.Until now mammalian liver SE had not been purified, due to its poor stability, and little is known of its structure or properties. Our new cloning strategy using a species-specific inhibitor of the enzyme demonstrates the utility of this trans-complementation cloning method, and has enabled us to produce the first purified SE. The availability of this cloned DNA will now permit detailed studies on the structure and properties of rat SE, and should also aid in the development of more effective inhibitors of SE. In addition, more precise studies of the regulation of the enzyme will now be feasible. Although it has been suggested that SE is regulated by sterols(8.Hidaka Y. Satoh T. Kamei T. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 2087-2094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Satoh T. Hidaka Y. Kamei T. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 2095-2101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the mechanism of this regulation is not known. The availability of a rat SE clone, and antibodies to the SE protein, will allow us to determine whether this regulation by sterols occurs at the level of mRNA synthesis, SE translation, or increased SE activity. Finally, we should now be able to determine if SE is involved in oxysterol formation. INTRODUCTIONCholesterol biosynthesis is a complex biological process(1.Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4500) Google Scholar, 2.Rudney H. Panini R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1993; 4: 230-237Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and it provides a therapeutic target for the reduction of low density lipoprotein cholesterol, a key risk factor in coronary heart disease (3.Steinberg D. Atheroscler. Rev. 1988; 18: 1-23Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed a post-mevalonate pathway of cholesterol biosynthesis that plays an important role in the supply of obligate precursors for dolichol, ubiquinone and isopentenyl tRNA synthesis, and for polyprenylation of p21ras(4.Glomset J.A. Gelb M.H. Farnsworth C.C. Trends Biochem. Soc. 1993; 4: 230-237Google Scholar) and small GTP-binding proteins(5.Gibbs J.B. Cell. 1991; 65: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), which function in the regulation of normal cellular processes and in oncogenesis(1.Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4500) Google Scholar). As a result, three enzymes which are located beyond branch point in this pathway, namely squalene synthase, squalene epoxidase (SE), 1The abbreviations used are: SEsqualene epoxidasePCRpolymerase chain reactionDTTdithiothreitolbpbase pair(s).and oxidosqualene cyclase, have evoked considerable interest as potential targets for the design of hypercholesterolemic chemotherapeutics(6.Ryder N.S. Dupont M.C. Biochem. J. 1985; 230: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 7.Horie M. Tsuchiya Y. Hayashi M. Iida Y. Iwasawa Y. Nagata Y. Sawasaki Y. Fukuzumi H. Kitani K. Kamei T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18075-18078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SE appears to be an important rate-limiting enzyme in this cascade, as it has an extremely low specific activity compared to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase or squalene synthase (8.Hidaka Y. Satoh T. Kamei T. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 2087-2094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Satoh T. Hidaka Y. Kamei T. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 2095-2101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the addition of exogenous cholesterol to human renal cancer cells results in the accumulation of squalene(10.Gonzalez R. Carlson J.P. Dempsey M.E. Arch. Biochim. Biophys. 1979; 196: 574-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).SE (EC 1.14.99.7) catalyzes the first oxygenation step in the sterol biosynthetic pathway, the conversion of squalene to 2,3(S)-oxidosqualene. It has been reported, however, that not only 2,3(S)-oxidosqualene but also 2,3(S);22(S),23-squalene diepoxide is accumulated in liver homogenates (11.Nelson J.A. Czarny M.R. Spencer T.A. Limanek J.S.

Chem. 1979; 254: 11258-11263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in cultured mammalian cells (13.Popjak G. Meenan A. Nes W.D. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1978; 232: 273-287Google Scholar) in the presence of an oxidosqualene cyclase inhibitor. 2,3(S);22(S),23-Squalene diepoxide is cyclized in rat liver homogenates to 24(S),25-epoxylanosterol(14.Nelson J.A. Steckbeck S.R. Spencer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1067-1078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is then converted to 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol. 24(S),25-Epoxycholesterol was identified as one of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase repressor activities in the cultured cells(15.Saucier S.E. Kandutsch A.A. Taylor F.R. Spencer T.A. Phirwa S. Gayen A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14571-14579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, it would be interesting to know whether SE is involved in the synthesis of such oxysterols via squalene dioxide formation(16.Spencer T.A. Acc. Chem. Res. 1994; 27: 83-90Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar).SE is believed to be a microsomal membrane-bound protein. Rat SE requires FAD, NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase (EC 1.6.2.4), NADPH, and a supernatant protein factor for its activity(17.Yamamoto S. Bloch K. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 1670-1674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Tai H.H. Bloch K. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3767-3773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Ono T. Bloch K. J.

Triton X-100 can be substituted for the supernatant protein factor(19.Ono T. Bloch K. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1571-1579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that this enzyme is not inhibited by CO(17.Yamamoto S. Bloch K. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 1670-1674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Ono T. Okayasu T. Kameda K. Imai Y.

Chem. 1977; 252: 2846-2854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicates that SE is not a cytochrome P-450 isozyme. It is the only non-cytochrome P-450 enzyme that epoxidizes a double bond in an alkyl chain(24.Richard D.S. Applebaum S.W. Sliter T.J. Baker F.C. Schooley D.A. Reuters C.C. Henrich V.C. Gilbert L.I.

Although much less is known about fungal SE, the ERG 1 gene recently cloned from an allylamine-resistant S. cerevisiae mutant was shown to encode a 55,190-Da SE protein consisting of 496 amino acids(25.Jandrositz A. Turnowsky F. Hogenauer G. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 107: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).

INTRODUCTIONAlthough recent reports indicate that the autophagic-lysosomal route could be modulated by intracellular signals including mobilization of calcium pools(1.Gordon P.B. Holen I. Fosse M. Rotnes J.S. Seglen P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26107-26112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), protein phosphorylation(2.Holen I. Gordon P.B. Seglen P.O. Eur. J.

The conversion of high mannose oligosaccharides to their complex counterparts is observed in differentiated cells, whereas a partial blockade of high mannose oligosaccharide trimming is a characteristic of undifferentiated cells. This partial impairment of N-linked glycoprotein processing is the consequence of a bypass of the Golgi complex and delivery of high mannose type glycoproteins to the lysosomal compartment (6.Trugnan G.

Briefly, the cells were resuspended at a density of 5 × 106/500 μl with 2 μCi of [3H]raffinose, after which they were incubated for 15 min at 37°C and submitted to electroinjection by a single voltage pulse (330 V, 1000 millifarads).

Immediately after homogenization, 0.5 ml ice-cold phosphate buffer (100 mM potassium phosphate, 2 mM EDTA and 2 mM dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 7.5) was added, and 1 ml of cell homogenate was layered on the top of a 4 ml density cushion of buffered metrizamide/sucrose (10% sucrose, 8% metrizamide, 1 mM EDTA, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 7.5) and centrifuged at 7000 × g for 60 min. The radioactivity associated with the pellet and total homogenate was measured by liquid scintillation counting.DNA TransfectionsRat cDNAs encoding either the αi3 or αi3 subunits were subcloned into the expression vector pBK/CMV (Stratagene). Plasmids were introduced into undifferentiated HT-29 cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation method(12.Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6475) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were grown in selective medium containing 400 μg/ml G418 for at least 3 weeks. Resistant cells were cloned by serial dilution. Eight and 12 clones were selected and screened for their level of αi3 and αi3 expression, respectively.Immunoblotting of G-protein α SubunitsCell homogenates, crude membranes, and cytosolic fractions were prepared exactly according to Wilson et al.(13.Wilson B.S. Komuro M. Farquhar M.G. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). One hundred micrograms of protein were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% gel) and were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Thereafter the membrane was blocked in blotting buffer (5% nonfat dry milk in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40), incubated with either anti-αi3 (1/500) or anti-αi3 (1/1000). After washing, bound IgG was labeled with 125I-labeled sheep anti-rabbit IgG.ADP-ribosylation of HT-29 MembranesCell-free ADP-ribosylation was conducted as described by van den Berg et al.(14.van den Berghe N. Nieuwkoop N.J. Vaandrager A.B. de Jonge H.R. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated in either the absence or presence of 200 ng/ml PTX for 18 h and ADP-ribosylation was performed by incubating 150 μg of membrane proteins for 60 min at 32°C in the substrate mix(14.van den Berghe N. Nieuwkoop N.J. Vaandrager A.B. de Jonge H.R. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Control incubations in the absence of PTX were also included. Reactions were terminated by addition of 400 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid.Protein DegradationCells were labeled for 6 h with 0.2 μCi of [14C]leucine and chased for different times in medium containing 5 mM leucine. PTX (200 ng/ml) was added 18 h before the labeling period and was present throughout the chase period; 3-MA (5 mM), asparagine (10 mM) and NH4Cl (10 mM) were added at the beginning of the chase period. Degradation of [14C]leucine-labeled proteins was measured after trichloroacetic acid-phosphotungstic acid precipitation as described previously(7.Houri J.J. Ogier-Denis E. Trugnan G. Codogno P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Immunofluorescence MicroscopyCells grown on 12-mm glass coverslips were fixed at room temperature with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, washed with PBS, quenched in 50 mM NH4Cl in PBS, and then blocked and permeabilized in 0.2% gelatin and 0.075% saponin in PBS for 20 min. The coverslips were then incubated with anti-αi3 (diluted 1/50) or anti-αi3 (diluted 1/50) for 45 min. Antibodies were diluted in gelatin-saponin-PBS. After washing, the coverslips were incubated for 45 min with a fluorescein isothiocyanate goat anti-rabbit antibody (diluted 1/500). The coverslips were mounted in Glycergel.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWhen undifferentiated HT-29 cells (hereafter referred to as HT-29 cells) are treated with PTX, which ADP-ribosylates the αi subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins, resulting in the inhibition of GDP/GTP exchange(15.Moss J. Vaughan M. Meister A. Advances in Enzymology. 61. Interscience, New York1988: 303-379Google Scholar), a quantitative trimming of high mannose to complex-type oligosaccharides was observed (Fig. 1, a and b). This PTX-induced processing is not a consequence of either an increase in protein synthesis, as determined by [14C]leucine incorporation, or modification of Golgi complex-associated glycosyltransferase activities (evaluated by the activity of β1,4 galactosyltransferase activity: 1.58 and 1.37 nmol/h/mg protein in control and PTX-treated cells, respectively). Moreover, PTX treatment was also associated with the cessation of N-linked glycoprotein degradation. This was demonstrated after treatment of cells with dMM (Fig. 1a, inset), an inhibitor of ER α-mannosidase and Golgi complex α-mannosidase I(16.Elbein A.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 497-534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions we have shown previously that high mannose glycoproteins were unstable in HT-29 cells ((10.Wice B.M. Trugnan G. Pinto M. Rousset M. Chevalier G. Dussaulx E. Lacroix B. Zweibaum A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 139-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Fig. 1a, inset). In contrast, in the presence of PTX high mannose glycoproteins were stable during a pulse-chase experiment (Fig. 1a, inset). The above described effect of PTX suggests that the restoration of the trimming of N-glycan chains in HT-29 cells could be due to either a cessation of the autophagic sequestration that impairs the Golgi delivery of N-linked glycoproteins (6.Trugnan G. Ogier-Denis E. Sapin C. Darmoul D. Bauvy C. Aubery M. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20849-20855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Houri J.J. Ogier-Denis E. Trugnan G. Codogno P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) or to an accelerated rate of ER to Golgi transport that prevents glycoproteins from entering the autophagic pathway. Indeed the presence of PTX-sensitive heterotrimeric Gi-proteins in ER and Golgi membranes is compatible with a function in protein transport from ER to Golgi(17.Audigier Y. Nigam S.N. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16352-16357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Ercolani L. Stow J.L.F.B. J. Holtzman E.J. Lin H. Grove J.R. Ausiello D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the rate of maturation of the N-linked glycans of either Lamp 1, a glycoprotein associated with lysosomal membranes (20.Carlsson S.R. Roth J. Piller F. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18911-18928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or dipeptidylpeptidase IV, a plasma membrane glycoprotein(21.Darmoul D. Lacasa M. Baricault L. Marguet D. Sapin C. Trotot P. Barbat A. Trugnan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4824-4833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In both cases the kinetics of high mannose oligosaccharide maturation to complex oligosaccharides was not changed by PTX treatment (data not shown), in agreement with other results(22.Schwaninger R. Plutner H. Bokoch G.M. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1077-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 23.Pimplikar S.W. Simons K. Nature. 1993; 362: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), indicating that ER to Golgi complex transport is unaffected by PTX. In contrast, PTX dramatically inhibits the autophagic sequestration of [3H]raffinose electroloaded into HT-29 cells (Fig. 2a), the level of PTX inhibition is similar to that observed in the presence of 3-MA (an inhibitor of autophagic sequestration, (24.Seglen P.O. Gordon P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1889-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar)). This sequestration of electroloaded [3H]raffinose was insensitive to CTX, which ADP-ribosylates the αs subunit of G-proteins(25.Stryer L. Bourne H.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1986; 2: 391-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar), although this toxin is able to activate Gs-proteins in HT-29 cells as determined by the increase of cAMP production(26.Lencer W.I. Reinhart F.D. Neutra M. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: G96-G102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Jarry A. Merlin D. Velcich A. Hopfer U. Augenlicht L.H. Laboisse C.L. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 267: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, the absence of in vitro PTX-dependent ADP-ribosylation of αi subunits in homogenates from PTX-treated cells confirmed that PTX could modify the Gi-proteins in vivo (Fig. 2b). In order to determine the identity of the PTX-sensitive G-protein αi subunit that controls the autophagic sequestration we have transfected HT-29 cells with cDNA encoding either the αi3 or the αi3 subunits. We focused our study on these two subunits since as in normal intestinal cells(14.van den Berghe N. Nieuwkoop N.J. Vaandrager A.B. de Jonge H.R. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 28.Couvineau A. Darmoul D. Blais A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Daviaud D. Voisin T. Paris H. Rouot B. Laburthe M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C1478-C1484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), they are the only PTX-sensitive subunits expressed in HT-29 cells (data not shown). Several stably transfected clones expressing different levels of αi subunits were selected. Whatever the αi subunit considered, Western blot analysis showed that these clones could be classified into two groups: the first one has a 1.5-fold increase in the level of the expression and the second a 3-fold increase. All the screened clones have phenotypic characteristics similar to that of parental untransfected cells. The rate of autophagy was measured in representative clones by assaying the sequestration of electroloaded [3H]raffinose (Fig. 3a) and the degradation of [14C]leucine-labeled proteins (Fig. 3b). As shown in Fig. 3, the overexpression of αi3 (3-fold) does not change autophagic sequestration/degradation in HT-29 cells. Similar results were obtained using other clones with lower (1.5-fold) overexpression of αi3 (data not shown). In contrast we observed a relationship between the overexpression of αi3 and the rate of autophagy. Clones 1 (1.5-fold increase) and 2 (3-fold increase) have 2.2- and 3.8-fold increases, respectively, in the sequestration of [3H]raffinose when compared to that observed in untransfected cells. In both clones the autophagic sequestration was inhibited by PTX and 3-MA treatment (Fig. 3a). This increase in the [3H]raffinose sequestration was correlated to an increase in protein degradation in overexpressing αi3 cells: by 2.6- and 4.0-fold in clones 1 and 2, respectively (Fig. 3b). The degradation of proteins in overexpressing αi3 cells was inhibited by PTX and drugs that impair the autophagic-lysosomal pathway at different steps (Fig. 3c), i.e. sequestration (3-MA), fusion of autophagic vacuoles with lysosomes (asparagine), lysosomal degradation (NH4Cl). These results underscore the involvement of αi3 in the control of the autophagic pathway. As shown in Fig. 4a, the overexpression of αi3 (3-fold) does not change the cellular localization of both αi3 and αi3 subunits as observed previously in other cell lines(19.Hermouet S. de Mazancourt P. Spiegel A.M. Farquhar M.G. Wilson B.S. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 29.Stow J.L. de Almeida J.B. Narula N. Holtzman E.J. Ercolani L. Ausiello D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1113-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In contrast to most of the cell lines studied so far(13.Wilson B.S. Komuro M. Farquhar M.G. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 18.Ercolani L. Stow J.L.F.B. J. Holtzman E.J. Lin H. Grove J.R. Ausiello D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), a high amount of αi subunits was found in the cytosolic fraction, which was more evident for αi3 subunit (Fig. 4b). Whether this distribution of αi3 is related to the autophagic capacity of HT-29 cells remains to be explored. Nevertheless the absolute amount of membrane-bound αi3 was increased in overexpressing αi3 cells by 1.5-3.0-fold (Fig. 4b). This increase was correlated with changes in autophagic degradation and autophagic sequestration (see above), which is compatible with an amplified response for heterotrimeric G-protein pathways (see (29.Stow J.L. de Almeida J.B. Narula N. Holtzman E.J. Ercolani L. Ausiello D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1113-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and (30.Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar), and references therein). The PTX-dependent inhibition of autophagic sequestration/degradation would suggest that the stabilization of membrane-bound G i3-protein in association with GDP is a key regulatory step in autophagy. As autophagic sequestration is constitutively expressed in HT-29 cells, our results suggest, by analogy with the functioning of plasma membrane-bound G-proteins(31.Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4682) Google Scholar), that an endomembraneassociated effector is under a conformational state that permanently activates G i3-protein. This putative effector could be in an inactive state in differentiated HT-29 cells where autophagic sequestration is down-regulated (6.Trugnan G. Ogier-Denis E. Sapin C. Darmoul D. Bauvy C. Aubery M. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20849-20855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Houri J.J. Ogier-Denis E. Trugnan G. Codogno P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) despite the fact that the αi3 subunit is expressed at the same level as in undifferentiated HT-29 cells (data not shown). Such a change in the conformation of a membrane-bound effector would fit with the rapidity of G-protein mediated signal transduction (31.Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4682) Google Scholar) and induction of autophagic sequestration in stimulated cells, e.g. hepatocytes(32.Hirsim ä ki P. Arstila A.U. Trump B.F.

Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 139-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Modifications of the effector conformation can be induced by either the binding of a diffusible ligand or changes in its phosphorylation status, two stimuli known to affect the G-protein response(30.Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar, 36.Hofmann K.P. Dickey B.F. Birnbaumer L. GTPases in Biology. 2. Springer-Verlag, Berlin _1993: 267-290Google Scholar). The latter possibility would be interesting to consider, since the phosphorylation status of proteins has been shown to modulate the induction of autophagy in hepatocytes(2.Holen I. Gordon P.B. Seglen P.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Recently, Kadowaki et al.(3.Kadowaki M. Venerando R. Miotto G. Mortimore G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3703-3710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that GTP γS inhibits the stimulated autophagic sequestration in rat hepatocytes, suggesting a role for GTP-binding proteins in the regulation of autophagy. Since GTP γS acts as well on heterotrimeric and monomeric G-proteins(22.Schwaninger R. Plutner H. Bokoch G.M. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1077-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), it cannot be concluded from this study on the identity of G-proteins involved in the autophagic sequestration. However, from the results reported in the present work and the possible localization of Rab24 (37.Olkkonen V.M. Dupree P. Killish I. Lütcke A. Zerial M. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1249-1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a monomeric GTP-binding protein, along the autophagic pathway it could be suggested that autophagy is under the control of multiple GTP-binding proteins as already observed for membrane dynamics along the exocytic and endocytic routes(26.Lencer W.I.

The conversion of high mannose oligosaccharides to their complex counterparts is observed in differentiated cells, whereas a partial blockade of high mannose oligosaccharide trimming is a characteristic of undifferentiated cells. This partial impairment of N-linked glycoprotein processing is the consequence of a bypass of the Golgi complex and delivery of high mannose type glycoproteins to the lysosomal compartment (6.Trugnan G.

https://openalex.org/W2041749846,"CTPphosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT) is a major regulatory enzyme in phosphatidylcholine synthesis in mammalian cells. CT is found in both soluble and particulate forms, both of which are nuclear. We report here the identification of a 21-residue sequence at the amino terminus of CT, 8KVNSRKRRKEVPGPNGATEED28, which was sufficient to direct β-galactosidase into the cell nucleus. Further deletions from either end of this sequence greatly reduced the nuclear localization of β-galactosidase. Deletions of amino acids within the nuclear localization signal or of the entire signal disrupted CT nuclear localization, but CT was not completely excluded from the nucleus. Clones of stable transfectants of the nuclear localization signal-deficient CT expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) 58 cells, which is temperature-sensitive for growth and CT activity, were isolated and characterized. The deletion mutants were active under the same conditions as the wild-type enzyme. Despite the difference in subcellular location from wild-type CT, the nuclear localization mutants were fully able to complement the CT-deficient cell line CHO 58 for both growth and choline incorporation into phosphatidylcholine at the nonpermissive temperature. The mobility of the mutant enzymes on SDS gels was altered relative to the mobility of wild-type CT; however, the extent of phosphorylation of the mutant enzymes was decreased only slightly. Thus, the distribution of CT in both cytoplasm and nucleus, rather than exclusively nucleus, has little effect on the ability of CT to function in growing CHO cells. phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT) is a major regulatory enzyme in phosphatidylcholine synthesis in mammalian cells.

We report here the identification of a 21-residue sequence at the amino terminus of CT, 8KVNSRKRRKEVPGPNGATEED28, which was sufficient to direct β-galactosidase into the cell nucleus. Further deletions from either end of this sequence greatly reduced the nuclear localization of β-galactosidase. Deletions of amino acids within the nuclear localization signal or of the entire signal disrupted CT nuclear localization, but CT was not completely excluded from the nucleus. Clones of stable transfectants of the nuclear localization signal-deficient CT expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) 58 cells, which is temperature-sensitive for growth and CT activity, were isolated and characterized. The deletion mutants were active under the same conditions as the wild-type enzyme. Despite the difference in subcellular location from wild-type CT, the nuclear localization mutants were fully able to complement the CT-deficient cell line CHO 58 for both growth and choline incorporation into phosphatidylcholine at the nonpermissive temperature. The mobility of the mutant enzymes on SDS gels was altered relative to the mobility of wild-type CT; however, the extent of phosphorylation of the mutant enzymes was decreased only slightly. Thus, the distribution of CT in both cytoplasm and nucleus, rather than exclusively nucleus, has little effect on the ability of CT to function in growing CHO cells."

These alter the in vivo intramolecular rates of electron transfer within the holoenzyme (Waterland, R. A., Basu, A., Chance, B., and Poyton, R. O.(1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 4180-4186). The isozyme with Vb has a higher turnover rate and a higher intramolecular transfer rate than the isozyme with Va. To determine how these isoforms affect catalysis, we have examined their effects on the binuclear reaction center and on the interaction between cytochrome c oxidase and the two isoforms, iso-1 and iso-2, of yeast cytochrome c. Infrared spectroscopy of carbon monoxide liganded to heme a3 has revealed a single conformer for the binuclear reaction center in the isozyme with Vb but two discrete conformers in the isozyme with Va. The kinetics of interaction for all four pairwise combinations of isozymes with each subunit V isoform and the two cytochrome c isoforms are biphasic, with high and low affinity electron transfer reactions. In general, the isoforms of cytochrome c and subunit V do not alter the Km but do affect the TNmax. The TNmax for isozymes carrying Vb are higher at both high and low affinity sites for each cytochrome c isoform. Iso-1-cytochrome c supports a higher TNmax than Iso-2-cytochrome c. Surprisingly, the combinatorial effect of both sets of isoforms on TNmax is minimized with the pairs of isoforms (iso-1-cytochrome c and subunit Va or iso-2 and subunit Vb) that are co-expressed in cells. Together, these findings support the conclusion that the subunit V isoforms modulate catalysis and suggest that they do so by affecting the environment or structure of the binuclear reaction center. They also suggest that the co-expression of the two cytochrome c isoforms with two subunit V isoforms serves to minimize differences in electron transfer rates brought about by the subunit V isoforms.

https://openalex.org/W2042742782,"xol-1 is the earliest-acting gene in the known hierarchy that controls C. elegans sex determination and dosage compensation. We show that the primary sex-determining signal (the X/A ratio) directs the choice of sexual fate by regulating xol-1 transcript levels: high xol-1 expression during gastrulation triggers male development, whereas low expression at that time permits hermaphrodite development. Inappropriately high xol-1 expression causes hermaphrodites to activate the male program of development and die from a disruption in dosage compensation. These results demonstrate that xol-1 functions as an early developmental switch to set the choice of sexual fate and suggest that assessment of the X/A ratio occurs only early in embryogenesis to determine sex. Moreover, sdc-2, a gene that must be repressed by xol-1 to ensure male development, may be a direct target of negative regulation by xol-1."

This cofactor activity can be made linearly related to the formation of the activated (GTP-bound) species and used as a quantitative assay of Arf activity (1.Schleifer L.S. Kahn R.A. Hanski E.

GTPase-controlled Molecular Machines. Ares-Serono Symposium Publications, Rome1994: 143-156Google Scholar)). Since its original purification, based on its activity as a cofactor for cholera toxin(5.Kahn R.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6228-6234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Arf proteins have also been purified based on their ability to inhibit intra-Golgi transport (6.Taylor T.C. Kahn R.A. Melancon P. Cell. 1992; 70: 69-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and nuclear vesicle fusion 2A. Boman and K. Wilson, unpublished observation.in the presence of GTPγS. In addition, Arf was purified independently in two different laboratories as the soluble factor required for the stimulation of phospholipase D activity by GTPγS(7.Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 8.Cockcroft S. Thomas G.M.H. Fensome A. Geny B. Cunningham E. Gout I. Hiles I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Science. 1994; 263: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Arf proteins have also been identified as components of nonclathin-coated vesicles(9.Serafini T. Orci L. Amherdt M. Brunner M. Kahn R.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1991; 67: 239-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), on which much speculation regarding cellular functions have focused. One of the first indications that Arf proteins act in one or more steps of the protein secretory pathway came from studies in S. cerevisiae(10.Stearns T. Willingham M.C. Botstein D. Kahn R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1238-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 11.Stearns T. Hoyt M.A. Botstein D. Kahn R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6690-6699Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) which have two ARF genes, ARF1 and ARF2. Deletion of both genes is lethal while deletion of ARF2 is without any defined effect. Disruption of ARF1 (arf1::URA3) was found to slow the rate of cell growth, cause a defect in the processing of invertase, and make cells supersensitive to fluoride ions(11.Stearns T. Hoyt M.A. Botstein D. Kahn R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6690-6699Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Each of these phenotypes could be complemented by transformation with a centromere-containing plasmid carrying wild type ARF1 or ARF2. Thus, yeast offers an attractive system for genetic studies of the role(s) for Arf protein in eukaryotes as phenotypes have already been described, which result from mutation of ARF1. Mutational studies, using both yeast and mammalian proteins, have been used to define the role of specific residues in the guanine nucleotide binding sites of a number of GTP-binding proteins, including p21ras, Gsα, SEC4, YPT/RAB, and others. Some recent reports (12.Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Teal S.B. Hsu V.W. Peters P.J. Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) have utilized homologous mutations to study functions of mutant Arf proteins in mammalian cells. However, none of these previous reports characterized the biochemical consequences of these mutations but instead relied upon the assumed conservation of consequences between Arf and Ras or other GTP-binding proteins. With the limited extent of sequence identity between ARF and either the other members of the Ras superfamily or α subunits of the heterotrimeric G proteins (≈20-25% identity), it is risky to assume that homologous mutations in one family will have the same consequences on nucleotide handling or protein interactions in a member of another family. Indeed, the solution of the crystal structure of human ARF1, along with some of the data presented below, provide direct demonstrations of the fact that the nucleotide binding site of Ras and Arf have distinctive features. The availability of a quantitative biochemical assay of Arf activity has proven of great value in the characterization of the protein, in spite of the unclear relevance of ADP-ribosylation to the in vivo action of Arf proteins in cells. Characterization of phenotypes of ARF mutants in yeast allowed the integration of biochemical information with functional characterization in cells. Mutants were constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the ARF1 open reading frame using synthetic oligonucleotides that incorporated the desired mutations. Products were sequenced to insure that the desired mutations were obtained and that no additional changes were introduced. Restriction sites were added at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the open reading frame to facilitate subcloning into expression vectors, as shown in Fig. 1. BamHI and NdeI sites were added at the initiating methionine to allow subcloning into yeast and bacterial expression vectors, respectively. An XbaI site occurs 6 bp downstream of the stop codon in the ARF1 gene and SalI and BamHI sites were added immediately 3′ of the XbaI site. Different combinations of double enzyme digestions allowed subcloning of wild type and mutant Arf constructs into thee different expression plasmids: (i) the NdeI-BamHI fragments were subcloned into pET3C (15.Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar) for expression in bacteria; (ii) the BamHI-SalI fragments were ligated into unique sites in pBM272 (the generous gift of Dr. Mark Johnston, Washington University, St. Louis, MO; (16.Johnston M. Davis R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1440-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar)), for expression in yeast under control of the inducible GAL1 promoter; and (iii) the NdeI-XbaI fragments were cloned into pJCY1-35, a centromere containing plasmid carrying an ARF1 gene with unique NdeI and XbaI sites at the initiating methionine and 6 bp downstream of the stop codon, respectively, for expression of Arf proteins in yeast under control of the ARF1 promoter. Yeast were cultured in rich complete medium, YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose), or for selection in S.D. (0.15% yeast nitrogen base, 2% dextrose, and the appropriate amino acid or nucleotide) at 30°C, unless otherwise stated. Transformation of yeast was achieved by using the lithium acetate method of Ito et al.(17.Ito H. Fukada Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of ARF1 was previously shown to be harmful or lethal to yeast cells(11.Stearns T. Hoyt M.A. Botstein D. Kahn R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6690-6699Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). This deleterious effect on vegetative growth can be seen when overexpression is achieved either by maintenance of an ARF1 gene on a high-copy, 2μ plasmid or by expression from the stronger, GAL1 promoter. The pGAL1-Arf-X plasmids were transformed into both a wild type strain, PSY315, and an arf1− strain, TT104 (isogenic to PSY315 in all other respects), and plated on selective medium using glucose as carbon source. Transformants were replica-plated to selective plates, YPD, and YPGal plates and growth was scored on days 2-4. Sensitivity to fluoride was tested by plating transformants on selective medium, YPD, and YPD plates containing 40 mM sodium fluoride (YPD/F40) and scoring for growth after 2-4 days. YPD/F40 plates were used within 1 week after pouring as they become toxic to all yeast strains after this time. The reason for this is not understood, although it may involve chelation of one or more metals by these high concentrations of fluoride ions. Wild type and mutants of ARF1 were subcloned into the pET3C vector (15.Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar) to allow the high level expression of Arf proteins in bacteria, as described previously for mammalian Arf proteins(18.Weiss O. Holden J. Rulka C. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21066-21072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Randazzo P.A. Weiss O. Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Each of the yeast Arf proteins was expressed at an estimated 5-10% of bacterial cell protein. Purification was achieved as described previously (19.Randazzo P.A. Weiss O. Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) by sequential batch elution from DEAE-Sephacel and gel filtration chomatography on Ultrogel AcA 54 in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM dithiotheitol. Purified proteins were concentrated to approximately 1 mg/ml and stored at −80°C. Yields were typically 2-5 mg of purified protein/liter of bacterial culture. Assays of Arf activity(20.Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), GTPγS binding(20.Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and GDP dissociation (18.Weiss O. Holden J. Rulka C. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21066-21072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were performed as described previously. The Arf assay measures the cholera toxin-dependent ADP-ribosylation of Gs, using [α- 32P]NAD and recombinant Gsα (with added bovine brain Gβγ) as substrates. Specific activities were determined by normalizing Arf activity to GTPγS binding sites on Arf; determined independently under identical conditions. Units of Arf activity are picomole of ADP-ribose incorporated into Gsα per picomole of Arf•GTPγS in a 20-min reaction. Stoichiometry of GTPγS binding was determined by trapping bound nucleotide on BA85 nitrocellulose filters after 20 min at 30°C in a binding reaction that included 1 μM Arf, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiotheitol, 3 mM dimyristoyl-L-α-phosphatidylcholine, 0.1% sodium cholate, and 10 μM [35S]GTPγS (≈10,000 cpm/pmol). Dissociation rates of GDP were determined after loading protein with [3H]GDP. Arf1 (5 μM) was incubated with 5 μM [3H]GDP (≈20,000 cpm/pmol) for 1 h at 30°C in a reaction containing 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 3 mM dimyristoyl-L-α-phosphatidylcholine, and 0.1% sodium cholate. Protein was diluted 10-fold into the same buffer but containing 0.5 mM unlabeled GDP and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Duplicate 10-μl samples were taken at 10 time points between 0 and 20 min by dilution into 2 ml of ice-cold 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 10 MgCl2, 1 mM dithiotheitol. Protein bound [3H]GDP was determined after trapping on nitrocellulose as described previously (21.Northup J.K. Smigel M.D. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11369-11376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dissociation rates were calculated using the UltraFit program (Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Curves were well fitted to equations for single exponential decay with an offset. Polyclonal antibody, R-40, was raised in a rabbit after injection of purified recombinant S. cerevisiae Arf1, as described in Stearns et al.(10.Stearns T. Willingham M.C. Botstein D. Kahn R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1238-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). This antibody specifically recognized both yeast Arf1 and Arf2 in immunoblotting experiments and immunoprecipitated both Arf proteins metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine. Specific immunoprecipitation of Arf proteins was achieved with R-40 in the absence of detergents. Normal rabbit serum was used as a negative control in the immunoprecipitation experiments. Yeast cells were grown in S.D. medium or switched to SGal medium for 6 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation and incubated in phosphate-free S.D. for 30 min before adding 0.1 mCi/ml carrier-free 32Pi. After 3 h at 30°C, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with water, resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 20 mM MgCl2), and lysed by vortexing in the presence of glass beads. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. Supernatants were incubated for 1 h at 4°C with antiserum or normal rabbit serum and for an additional 1 h in the presence of protein G-agarose. Precipitates were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g and washed three times with lysis buffer before resuspension in 20 μl of 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 20 mM EDTA, 2% SDS. The suspension was heated at 65°C for 5 min before spotting on polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin-layer plates. Separation was achieved using a mobile phase of 1 M formic acid, 1 M LiCl. The migration of GDP and GTP were determined in each experiment with pure nucleotide standards. Controls were performed to insure that hydrolysis of guanine nucleotides did not occur during the analysis. Eight point mutations were introduced into S. cerevisiae ARF1 and analyzed using a number of specific tests of in vivo and in vitro activities. The mutations and a brief indication of the rationale behind their construction appear in Fig. 2. More details of the rationale for each mutant appear in the relevant sections below. The strategy used in the construction of plasmids used to express wild type and each of the mutants in yeast, using either the ARF1 promoter or the inducible GAL1 promoter, and bacteria is shown in Fig. 1. Table 1 lists each of these plasmids and the yeast strains used in the studies described below.Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab N-Myristoylation occurs on NH2-terminal glycine residues after cleavage of the initiating methionine. Thus, mutation of Gly2 to Ala2 should completely prevent the acylation of Arf proteins. Two of the previously defined phenotypes associated with ARF1 expression, the rescue of supersensitivity to fluoride in arf1− cells and inhibition of cell proliferation when overexpressed, were used as in vivo tests of Arf functions. The haploid arf1− strain, TT104, fails to grow on YPD in the presence of 40 mM NaF (YPD/F40; Table 2; (11.Stearns T. Hoyt M.A. Botstein D. Kahn R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6690-6699Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar)). When TT104 cells carried a copy of the ARF1 gene on a centromere-containing plasmid (strain RT135), growth on YPD/F40 was restored. In contrast, such a plasmid carrying the ARF1 gene with the [G2A] mutation (RT136) failed to allow growth of arf1− cells on YPD/F40 (see Table 2).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Overexpression of ARF1 is lethal to yeast cells (Table 2; (11.Stearns T. Hoyt M.A. Botstein D. Kahn R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6690-6699Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar)). The inducible GAL1 promoter was used to express wild type or mutants of ARF1 to high levels. Cells (RT164) carrying a CEN plasmid, directing the expression of wild type ARF1 under control of the GAL1 promoter, grew well on S.D. (synthetic medium with dextrose) but not on SGal (synthetic medium with galactose), which induces the GAL1 promoter. In contrast, overexpression of the [G2A] mutant had no apparent effect on cell growth (Table 2). Immunoblots of cell lysates with an antibody directed against yeast Arf proteins confirmed that RT164 cells grown on SGal expressed much higher levels of Arf1 than either the RT152 control or any of the strains grown on glucose. These data confirmed the previous observations (11.Stearns T. Hoyt M.A. Botstein D. Kahn R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6690-6699Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) that overexpression of wild type Arf1 was harmful to cells and sensitivity to 40 mM NaF resulted from loss of Arf1 function and indicate that the [G2A] mutant is a null allele of ARF1. Yeast Arf proteins were expressed in bacteria and several milligrams of each were obtained, using previously established procedures(19.Randazzo P.A. Weiss O. Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). N-Myristoylation of the yeast Arf1 in bacteria was achieved by the co-expression of Arf with the yeast N-myristoyltransferase gene, NMT1(22.Duronio R.J. Jackson-Machelski E. Heuckeroth R.O. Olins P.O. Devine C.S. Yonemoto W. Slice L.W. Taylor S.S. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1506-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 23.Randazzo, P. A., Kahn, R. A. (1994) Methods Enzymol., in pressGoogle Scholar). The covalent incorporation of myristic acid into Arf proteins expressed in bacteria was monitored by inclusion of [3H]myristic acid in the culture medium. Although the Arf1 protein was efficiently myristoylated in bacteria expressing N-myristoyltransferase, the [G2A]Arf1 protein failed to incorporate any labeled myristate (data not shown). Thus, the [G2A] point mutation completely prevented N-myristoylation. Biochemical analyses of non-myristoylated wild type and [G2A]Arf1 revealed no differences in the rates of GDP dissociation, the steady-state level of GTPγS binding, or specific activities in the cholera toxin-dependent ADP-ribosylation of Gs (Arf assay; see Table 3). Thus, the only apparent consequence of mutation of Gly2 to Ala2 was to prevent N-myristoylation of Arf1. However, this single change was responsible for the complete loss of in vivo activity.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab For comparative purposes the non-myristoylated forms of each of the other mutant proteins were analyzed below, as the extent of myristoylation of recombinant proteins expressed in bacteria can vary dramatically. The residue in the first consensus GTP binding domain of Arf1, homologous to Gly12 of Ras, is Asp26. We introduced three different point mutations at residue 26; glycine, alanine, or valine. Like the [G2A]Arf1 mutant, each of these three mutants lacked Arf1 activities in cells. Specifically, they neither restored resistance of arf1 disrupted cells to 40 mM NaF when present on a low-copy plasmid, nor inhibited cell proliferation when overexpressed in ARF1+ cells (see Table 2). Each of the Asp26 mutants was expressed in and the proteins were purified from bacteria, as described under “Materials and Methods.” All three mutant proteins were found to have specific activities in the Arf assay that were slightly higher than that of wild type Arf1 (Table 3). The three mutants all behaved very similarly and the range of activities were 200-500% that of wild type, determined in at least four different experiments. It is important to note that activity in the Arf assay is normalized to GTPγS binding sites to determine the specific activities. The binding of radiolabeled GDP to the Asp26 mutants was also not much different from that of wild type Arf1, although the GDP off-rate from [D26V]Arf1 was found to be slower than wild type and the other Asp26 mutants (Table 3). However, the slowly hydrolyzable analog of GTP, GTPγS, bound very poorly to each of these three Asp26 mutants (Table 3 and Fig. 3). Thus, Asp26 is critical for high affinity binding of the activating nucleotide. Determination of specific activity in the Arf assay takes into account this low level of binding of GTPγS as the activity is normalized to GTPγS binding sites. It is the switch to this active conformation that appears to be impaired by mutations at position 26. Mutations of glutamine in the consensus GTP binding domain, DXXGQ, in both α subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (24.Graziano M.P. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15475-15482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Masters S.B. Miller R.T. Chi M. Chang F. Beiderman B. Lopez N.G. Bourne H.R. J. Biol.

J. 1991; 279: 609-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) lead to activation of the proteins as a result of decreased intrinsic, or GAP stimulated-GTPase activities, respectively. The corresponding residue in Arf proteins, Gln71, was mutated to leucine in Arf1 and subjected to functional analyses. Transformants carrying plasmid pJCY1-40, directing expression of [Q71L]Arf1 under regulation by the GAL1 promoter, grew well on S.D. but were killed when plated on SGal (Table 2). As described above, this is the same result observed with the overexpression of Arf1. However, when the same plasmid was used to transform the arf1 null cells, TT104, it was apparent that overexpression of this allele is more toxic than is the wild type protein. We were unable to obtain transformants of either ARF1+ (PSY315) or arf1− (TT104) cells with pArf1-[Q71L]Arf1. Increased lethality over that of wild type Arf1 and failure to obtain transformants that express the mutant under control of the ARF1 promoter are consistent with the [Q71L] mutation being a dominant lethal allele of ARF1. Nucleotide exchange on [Q71L]Arf1 was comparable to that of Arf1, with an apparent first-order GDP off-rate of 0.535 min−1 (see Table 3). The specific activity in the Arf assay of [Q71L]Arf1 was also quite similar to the wild type protein. It should be noted that hydrolysis of GTP by Arf is not required for activity in the Arf assay(27.Kahn R.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7906-7911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the dominant activation of the [Q71L]Arf1 in cells is not readily explained by changes in the intrinsic nucleotide handling of the purified protein. It was not possible to test for a decrease in this rate, as has been found for homologous mutations in other GTP-binding proteins, as Arf proteins, including yeast Arfs (data not shown), have no intrinsic GTPase activity(27.Kahn R.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7906-7911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of Arf proteins from yeast was accomplished using an antiserum, R-40, from a rabbit immunized with purified, recombinant S. cerevisiae Arf1, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Labeling of yeast cells with 0.1 mCi/ml 32Pi resulted in the optimal incorporation of radioactivity into guanine nucleotides bound to Arf proteins, detectable after immunoprecipitation with antibody R-40 and denaturation. Analysis of the guanine nucleotides obtained from immunoprecipitates from wild type cells by thin layer chomatography revealed that virtually all of the nucleotide precipitated with the Arf was GDP. Studies of wild type and point mutants induced for expression by 9 h of growth in SGal revealed almost exclusively GDP bound to the Arf in most cases. Small amounts of GTP were observed in cells overexpressing Arf1 and [W66R]Arf1. Cells expressing excess Arf (e.g. [G2A]Arf1) yielded more detectable 32P-labeled GDP in immunoprecipitates than that found in control strains. Analysis of bound nucleotides in strain RT132, after induction of [Q71L]Arf1 for 9 h, revealed that over half of the bound nucleotide (60-80%) was GTP. The accumulation of a large fraction of activated Arf in cells expressing the [Q71L] mutant and lack of intrinsic GTPase activity of both wild type and mutant Arf1 are consistent with the presence of an Arf GTPase-activating protein (Arf GAP) in yeast which promotes the hydrolysis of GTP bound to wild type Arf but is much less effective on the [Q71L] mutant, as has been shown for the [Q61L] mutant and Ras GAP(28.Gideon P. John J. Frech M. Lautwein A. Clark R. Scheffler J.E. Wittinghofer A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 2050-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). It is worth noting that ARF, immunoprecipitated from cells labeled with radioactive inorganic phosphate, failed to incorporate any covalently attached phosphate. Thus, if Arf is a substrate for any yeast protein kinase the extent of modification was so low as to be undetectable, or the phosphate linkage was labile under the conditions used in these studies. The asparagine residue in the consensus GTP binding domain, NKXD, of regulatory GTP-binding proteins is involved in coordination of the guanine base in both Ras and the α subunit of transducin, Gtα(29.Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Mutation of this residue to isoleucine results in a dominant loss of function of SEC4(30.Walworth N.C.

INTRODUCTIONCholera toxin, a secretory product of Vibrio cholerae that is responsible (in large part) for the devastating diarrheal syndrome characteristic of cholera, exerts its effect on intestinal cells via the ADP-ribosylation of the α subunit of a heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding (G) protein, i.e. Gs, the stimulatory G protein of adenylyl cyclase, that serves as a signal-transducing element from surface receptors to intracellular effectors(1.Field M.

The effects of ARL proteins on PLD have not been reported.

Five PCRs were used to obtain segments of cDNA and to assemble a composite sequence of the full-length coding region. Primers 1222 (5′-TTGACACCAGACCAACTGGTAATG-3′), 1222B (5′-ACCGGCGCTCAGCTGGAATT-3′), 1218 (5′-GGTGGCGACGACTCCTGGAGCCCG-3′), and 1218A (5′-CGTCAGTATCGGCGGAATTC-3′) are complementary to sequences immediately upstream or downstream of the EcoRI insertion site of vector λgt11. Degenerate nucleotides (DVGG-R1 and ARF6.5R) correspond to part of the consensus sequence VWDVGGQD and the specific sequence TYKNVKFN in human ARF 6, respectively. The open reading frame was completed using the 5′ RACE (rapid amplification of 5′ cDNA ends) procedure. Two different human cDNA libraries (human fetal brain and human fibroblast line; Stratagene) served as templates in the one-site-specific PCR used to capture 3′ and 5′ ends.Construction of Plasmids for Chimera F73/L and L73/FTo construct chimeric proteins, two DNA fragments (region 1 from amino acid 1 to 73, and region 2 from 74 to 181; Fig. 1) each from ARF1 and ARL1 were amplified from their cDNAs by PCR. Ligation of region 1 of ARF1 and region 2 of ARL 1 produced the chimeric construct F73/L. Ligation of region 1 of ARL1 and region 2 of ARF1 yielded the chimeric construct L73/F. Chimeric inserts were subcloned into the pT7/Nde expression vector(19.Hong J.-X. Haun R.S. Tsai S.-C. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol.

The nucleotide sequences of the two chimeric constructs were verified using a standard dideoxy sequencing method (Sequenase, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). A PCR-generated alteration was found near the COOH terminus in L73/F, where TCC in ARF1 was changed to CCC, which would result in replacement of Ser-174 with Pro.Expression and Purification of rARF1, rARL1, rF73/L, and rL73/F ProteinsPlasmids were transformed into BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli. For large scale production of recombinant proteins, 5 ml of overnight culture were used to inoculate 1 liter of LB broth containing carbenicillin (50 μg/ml), followed by shaking at 37°C. When A 600 reached 0.6-0.8, protein production was induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside for 3 h, and bacteria were collected by centrifugation and stored at −20°C. Cell pellets were suspended in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme and disrupted by sonication. Insoluble material was pelleted at 100,000 × g and the supernatant was applied to a column (2.5 × 112 cm) of Ultrogel AcA 54, which was eluted with TENDS buffer(19.Hong J.-X. Haun R.S. Tsai S.-C.

Fractions of greatest purity and activity were pooled and stored at −20°C.Assay for ARF Stimulation of CTAAssays were performed in a 200 μl containing the indicated amount of recombinant protein, 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM dithiothreitol, 0.3 mg/ml ovalbumin, 20 mM agmatine, and 0.003% SDS or 0.3 mg/ml cardiolipin or 3 mM DMPC plus 0.2% sodium cholate, as indicated, 0.2 mM [14C-adenine] NAD (4-5 × 104 cpm), CTA (0.5 μg), and GTP γS or GDPβS as indicated. After incubation at 30°C for 1 h, [14C-adenine]ADP-ribosylagmatine was separated on AG 1-X2 for radioassay.Assay for ARF Stimulation of PLDPC hydrolysis was assayed as described in (16.Brown H.A.

This modified assay allows measurement of CTA activity under identical conditions by changing the radiolabel from [3H-choline]DPPC to [14C-adenine]NAD for direct comparison of CTA and PLD activation. (It is recognized, of course, that the actual state of the different ARF-enzyme complexes interacting with their respective substrates may be quite different.) After incubation at 37°C for 1 h, 1 ml of methanol:chloroform:concentrated HCl (50:50:0.5, v/v/v) was added followed by 350 μl of 5 mM EGTA in 1 M HCl. After vortex mixing and centrifugation, 575 μl of the aqueous layer was removed for scintillation counting.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONComparison of Amino Acid Sequences of Human ARL1 and ARF1 and Construction of the Chimeric ProteinsIsolation of the human ARL1 gene resulted from an attempt to isolate an analogue of human ARF6 from yeast using PCR (see “Experimental Procedures”). The deduced amino acid sequences of hARL1 and hARF1 are 57% identical (Fig. 1). hARL1 is 78% identical to Drosophila ARL1 (8.Tamkun J.W. Kahn R.A. Kissinger M. Brizuela B.J. Rulka C. Scott M.P.

The first 73 amino acids contain a region similar to the effector loop found in Ras (7.Price S.R. Barber A. Moss J. Moss J. Vaughan M. ADP-Ribosylating Toxins and G Proteins.

The rL73/F chimera contains the NH2-terminal 73 amino acids of ARL1 (40% of the ARL1 sequence) linked to the COOH-terminal 108 residues of ARF1 (60% of the ARF1 sequence). The rF73/L chimera encodes the NH2-terminal 73 amino acids of ARF1 linked to the COOH-terminal 108 residues of ARL1. The chimeras, expressed as nonmyristoylated proteins, were purified from E. coli for use in biochemical studies.

Activation of CTA was not observed with rL73/F in the presence of 100 μM GDPβS (Fig. 2B) or in the absence of added nucleotide (data not shown). Therefore, the activation of CTA by the chimera rL73/F was totally GTP-dependent; rARF1, however, activated slightly in the presence of GDPβS (Fig. 2A). It is possible that a fraction of the rARF1 was isolated in a GTP-bound form. In fact, rARF6 has been isolated in an active form with bound GTP(22.Welsh C.F. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol.

Activation of CTA by rARF1 (A), rL73/F (B), and rF73/L (C) was evaluated in the NAD:agmatine ADP-ribosyltransferase assay (25.Tsai S.-C. Noda M. Adamik R. Chang P.P. Chen H.-C. Moss J. Vaughan M. J.

In the presence of SDS, the maximal activity of rL73/F was similar to that of rARF1 (Fig. 3A), although the GTP γS concentration required for half-maximal activation of CTA (EC 50) by rL73/F ( ∼200 μM) was nearly 40 times that required with rARF1 ( ∼5 μM). In the presence of DMPC and sodium cholate or cardiolipin, however, the maximal activity of rL73/F was much higher than that of rARF1 (Fig. 3, B and C). The EC 50 values of GTP γS for rARF1 and rL73/F were about 0.1 and 10 μM, respectively. Under all these conditions, rF73/L chimera was inactive, resembling wild type rARL1 (data not shown).Figure 3GTP-dependent stimulation of ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of cholera toxin by rARF1, rF73/L, and rL73/F. Assays contained 1 μg of rARF1 (○), rL73/F (▵), or rF73/L (□), the indicated concentration of GTP γS, and 0.003% SDS (A), 3 mM DMPC plus 0.2% sodium cholate (B), or 0.3 mg/ml cardiolipin (C).

This is consistent with the observation that deletion of the amino-terminal 13 amino acids of ARF1 did not affect the ability of ARF to activate CTA(19.Hong J.-X. Haun R.S. Tsai S.-C. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9743-9745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but differs from the previous view that the amino terminus of ARF is critical for its activity based on the ability of a peptide with that sequence to inhibit ARF activation of CTA(23.Kahn R.A. Randazzo P.A. Serafini T. Weiss O. Rulka C. Clarks J. Amherdt M. Roller P. Orci L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13039-13046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We propose that the carboxyl-terminal 60% of ARF contains a structural element that is crucial for its function as a CTA cofactor.Activation of PLD by rARF1, rF73/L, and rL73/F ProteinsAlthough the ARF-stimulated PLD has not been purified to homogeneity and its subcellular localization remains to be defined, two major forms of PLD activity have been separated(18.Massenburg, D., Han, J.-S., Liyanage, M., Patton, W. A., Rhee, S. G., Moss, J., Vaughan, M. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in pressGoogle Scholar). Proteins solubilized from rat brain membranes with Triton X-100 were applied to a heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column followed by heparin high performance liquid chromatography for the complete separation of the two forms of PLD. One form was completely dependent on sodium oleate; the other was dramatically activated by all three classes of ARF, both myristoylated and non-myristoylated, in the presence of GTP γS and PIP2. Activation of the partially purified ARF-dependent form of PLD by the chimeric proteins was assessed using DPPC as substrate in vesicles containing a mixture of phosphatidylethanolamine, PIP2, and DPPC(16.Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar).Under the PLD assay conditions and in the presence of 100 μM GTP γS (but not GDPβS), CTA was activated by rL73/F and rARF1, but not by rF73/L (data not shown), which is in agreement with the results shown in Fig. 2. In contrast, rF73/L, which was inactive in the CTA assay, activated PLD in the presence of 100 μM GTP γS in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4C). The maximal activity of rF73/L was nearly equal to that of rARF1 (Fig. 4, A and C). In the same experiment, rL73/F (which activated CTA) produced only a small degree of activation (Fig. 4B). The activation of PLD was clearly GTP-dependent (Fig. 4), although there was a fraction of rARF1 activity (as shown also in Fig. 2) that was not, which could be explained by the presence in the recombinant ARF protein of tightly bound GTP(22.Welsh C.F. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15583-15587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 4Activation of PLD by rARF1, rF73/L, and rL73/F. Assays contained 0.6 μg of partially purified PLD (10 μl, 0.06 mg/ml), and the indicated amount (0.1-8.0 μg) of rARF1 (A), rL73/F (B), or rF73/L (C) with 100 μM GTP γS (closed symbols) or 100 μM GDPβS (open symbols). Basal activity of PLD without added ARF was 2.9 and 2.3 pmol/h, with GTP γS and GDPβS, respectively. Data are means of values of triplicate assays; variance was less than 10%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It appears that an ARF domain that is important for PLD activation is located in the amino-terminal portion of the protein (at least the first 73 amino acids), although the specific location of the activating structure or the mechanism of activation is still unclear. The putative Ras effector loop is also located in this region(7.Price S.R. Barber A. Moss J. Moss J. Vaughan M. ADP-Ribosylating Toxins and G Proteins. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1990: 397-424Google Scholar, 20.Pai E.F. Kabsch W. Krengel U. Holmes K.C. John J. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1989; 341: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). The slight GTP-dependent activity of rL73/F, which was observed also with rARL1 (data not shown), may be related to the fact that ARL1 and ARF1 are 84% identical in amino acids 37-55 (the region similar to the putative Ras effector loop) and 68% identical in sequences of the first 73 amino acids. The finding that rL73/F is clearly less potent than rARF1 may mean that it does not contain all of the specific sequence necessary for optimal PLD activation (at least not for this form of partially purified PLD), or that it associates less well with membranes (phospholipids).In any case, it seems that different functional domains are involved in the activation of CTA and PLD; thus, ARF could be a rather versatile protein, perhaps subject to control related to subcellular location and/or the presence of effector molecules. The role of PLD activation by ARF in vesicle-mediated membrane trafficking is at present speculative. Activation of PLD by ARF proteins could generate second messengers that are involved in signaling processes or products, e.g. phosphatidic acid, that influence membrane properties and thereby vesicle budding or fusion. The action of PLD, by altering membrane phospholipid composition, might directly or indirectly provide binding sites for membrane docking proteins(16.Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Liscovitch et al.(24.Liscovitch M.L. Chalifa V. Pertile P. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21403-21406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have recently published an appealing hypothesis involving a positive feedback between PLD activation and PIP2 biosynthesis in ARF-regulated vesicle fusion. It is tempting to speculate that different functions of ARF are involved in this action and in its operation as a critical compound required for coatomer or AP-1 binding in vesicle formation. As the physiological role of ARF-stimulated PC hydrolysis and the mechanism of ARF-effector interaction are still unknown, elucidation of structure-function relationships in ARFs and ARLs may lead to a better understanding of the precise roles of ARF and ARL proteins in signaling and other cellular processes. INTRODUCTIONCholera toxin, a secretory product of Vibrio cholerae that is responsible (in large part) for the devastating diarrheal syndrome characteristic of cholera, exerts its effect on intestinal cells via the ADP-ribosylation of the α subunit of a heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding (G) protein, i.e. Gs, the stimulatory G protein of adenylyl cyclase, that serves as a signal-transducing element from surface receptors to intracellular effectors(1.Field M.

Sequence comparisons of the ARF proteins and other GTP-binding proteins revealed that ARF proteins have a similar degree of relatedness to the Ras superfamily and the heterotrimeric G protein α subunits(7.Price S.R.

https://openalex.org/W2087939135,"Perlecan has been previously been shown to support attachment of a wide variety of cells through interactions of its core protein with the cell surface. The core protein domains involved in cell adhesion are, however, unknown. The laminin-like domain III of murine perlecan contains an RGDS sequence and is a likely candidate for supporting integrin-mediated cell attachment. We made a cDNA construct corresponding to domain III and containing an in frame signal peptide at the 5' end as well as in frame a stop codon at the 3' end by using cDNA clones to perlecan. The construct was inserted into the pRC/CMV vector and transfected into HT1080 cells, and the secreted recombinant domain III, a 130-kDa protein, was purified from the medium. The size of proteolytic fragments produced by digestion with V8 protease as well as analysis of the rotary shadowed image of the recombinant protein indicated it was produced in a native conformation. Recombinant domain III coated on tissue culture dishes, supports adhesion of an epithelial-like mouse mammary tumor cell line MMT 060562 in a dose-dependent manner. This interaction was inhibited specifically by the RGDS synthetic peptide and intact perlecan, but not laminin. This domain III RGD-dependent cell attachment activity indicates a role for perlecan in integrin-mediated signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2056576549,"The effect of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) on the size, composition, and structure of spherical, reconstituted HDL (rHDL) which contain apolipoprotein (apo) A-I as their sole apolipoprotein has been studied. Spherical rHDL were incubated with CETP and Intralipid for up to 24 h. During this time CETP promoted transfers of cholesteryl esters (CE) and triglyceride (TG) between rHDL and Intralipid. As a result, the rHDL became depleted of CE and enriched in TG. However, as the loss of CE from the rHDL was greater than the gain of TG, the concentration of core lipids in the rHDL decreased. The decrease in the concentration of rHDL core lipids, which was evident throughout the incubation, was accompanied by a reduction in rHDL diameter from 9.2 to 8.0 nm, the dissociation of apoA-I from rHDL and a decrease in the number of apoA-I molecules, from three/particle in the 9.2-nm rHDL, to two/particle in the 8.0-nm rHDL. Spectroscopic studies showed that the lipid-water interface and phospholipid packing of the 8.0-nm rHDL were, respectively, more polar and less ordered than those of the 9.2-nm rHDL. Quenching studies with KI revealed that the number of exposed apoA-I Trp residues in the 9.2- and 8.0-nm rHDL was two and three, respectively. Circular dichroism established that the 9.2- and 8.0-nm rHDL had identical apoA-I α-helical contents.

Denaturation studies with guanidine hydrochloride demonstrated that apoA-I is more stable in 8.0-nm rHDL than in 9.2-nm rHDL. It is concluded that CETP converts rHDL to small, TG-enriched, apoA-I-depleted particles with increased lipid-water interfacial hydration and less ordered phospholipid packing.

The importance of understanding the effects of CETP on the structure and function of HDL has been highlighted by two recent observations. First, humans with a genetic deficiency of CETP have high concentrations of HDL which are larger than those found in normal subjects(5.Bisgaier C.L. Siebenkas M.V. Brown M.L. Inazu A. Koizumi J. Mabuchi H. Tall A.R. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 21-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such individuals appear to have a decreased incidence of coronary heart disease(6.Inazu A. Brown M.L.

The second observation has been made in mice, a species which is normally deficient in CETP (7.Jiao S. Cole T.G. Kitchens R.T. Pfleger B. Schonfeld G. Metab. Clin.

Such animals are also susceptible to diet-induced coronary heart disease (10.Marotti K.R. Castle C.K. Boyle T.P. Lin A.H. Murray R.W. Melchior G.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Although it is possible to study the effect of CETP on the structure and function of native HDL, the results of such experiments are difficult to interpret because native HDL consist of several subpopulations of particles which vary in size and composition. This problem has been overcome in the present report by using preparations of monodisperse, spherical reconstituted HDL (rHDL). We have shown recently that the interaction of rHDL with CETP is analogous to that of native HDL with CETP in that the rHDL acquire TG and lose CE during incubation with either VLDL or Intralipid(11.Rye K.-A. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10298-10303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We now report on the effects of these processes on the structure, size, and composition of rHDL. Plasma samples for the isolation of HDL, LDL, and apolipoprotein (apo) A-I were donated by the Transfusion Service at the Royal Adelaide Hospital. ApoA-I was prepared from HDL which had been isolated by ultracentrifugation in the 1.07 < d < 1.21 g/ml density range(12.Rye K.-A. Garrety K.H. Barter P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1167: 316-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The HDL were delipidated (13.Osborne Jr., J.C.

VLDL, LDL, and HDL3 were dialyzed against 0.01 M Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 M NaCl, 0.005% (w/v) EDTA-Na2, and 0.006% (w/v) NaN3 before use. Discoidal rHDL were prepared by the cholate dialysis method from 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine, unesterified cholesterol (UC), and apoA-I(16.Matz C.E. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4535-4540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine, UC, and sodium cholate were purchased from Sigma. Spherical rHDL were prepared by incubating discoidal rHDL for 24 h at 37°C with LDL, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, and β-mercaptoethanol(11.Rye K.-A. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10298-10303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting spherical rHDL were isolated by ultracentrifugation in the density range 1.07 < d < 1.21 g/ml with two spins at the lower density and a single spin at the higher density. The rHDL were dialyzed against TBS before use. LCAT was purified to homogeneity using the method of Mahadevan and Soloff (17.Mahadevan V. Soloff L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 752: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with modifications as described by Rajaram and Barter(18.Rajaram O.V. Barter P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 835: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Activity of the preparations was determined as described by Piran and Morin (19.Piran U. Morin R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1979; 20: 1040-1043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using discoidal 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine/UC/apoA-I rHDL labeled with [3H]UC as the substrate. The assay was linear as long as 30% or less of the UC was esterified. The preparation used in this study generated 1 μmol of CE/ml of LCAT/h. CETP was isolated from 2 liters of human plasma (Transfusion Service, Royal Adelaide Hospital). The proteins which precipitated between 35 and 55% saturation of ammonium sulfate were subjected to ultracentrifugation at a density of 1.25 g/ml (20.Pattnaik N.M. Montes A. Hughes L.B. Zilversmit D.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 530: 428-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The d > 1.25 g/ml fraction was applied to an XK 50/60 column containing Phenyl-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (high substitution) (Pharmacia Biotechnology AB) which had been pre-equilibrated with 3 M NaCl. CETP was eluted from the column at a flow rate of 10 ml/min with Milli Q water adjusted to pH 10. The active fractions were pooled, adjusted to 50 mM NaOAc (pH 4.5), and applied to a pre-equilibrated XK 26/40 column containing CM-Sepharose Fast Flow (Pharmacia Biotechnology AB). CETP was eluted from the column at a flow rate of 10 ml/min with a linear 0-0.4 M NaCl gradient. A Mono Q HR 5/5 anion exchange column (Pharmacia Biotechnology AB) was used for the final step of the purification(21.Barter P.J. Rajaram O.V. Chang L.B.F. Rye K.A. Gambert P. Lagrost L. Ehnholm C. Fidge N.H. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). All the chromatographic steps were carried out at room temperature on a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Pharmacia Biotechnology AB). CE transfer activity was quantitated as the transfer of [3H]CE from [3H]CE-HDL3 to LDL (22.Tollefson J.H. Lui A. Albers J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: E894-E902PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Burstein M. Scholnick H.R. Morfin R. J. Lipid Res. 1970; 11: 583-595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay was linear when less than 30% of the total counts were transferred from HDL3 to LDL during 3 h of incubation at 37°C. Activity is expressed in arbitrary units, with 1 unit being the transfer activity of 1 ml of a preparation of pooled human lipoprotein-deficient plasma. Agarose gel electrophoresis was carried out at 10 volts for 1 h in a 0.6% agarose gel(11.Rye K.-A. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10298-10303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobilities were calculated by dividing the electrophoretic velocity (migration distance (μM)/time (s)) by the electrophoretic potential (voltage(V)/length of gel (cm))(24.Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 123-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mobilities were corrected for pI-dependent retardation effects according to the following relationship(24.Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 123-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Mobilitycorrected=Mobilityagarose-0.1361.211(Eq. 1) Various combinations of spherical rHDL, CETP, and Intralipid (20% TG, KabiVitrum AB, Stockholm, Sweden) were incubated in stoppered plastic tubes in a shaking waterbath maintained at 37°C. Nonincubated control samples were maintained at 4°C. Details of individual incubations are described in the figure legends. Samples for nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis were obtained by adjusting 0.1-ml aliquots of the incubation mixtures to 1.25 g/ml with KBr. A 0.4-ml aliquot of a 1.25 g/ml KBr solution was added to the samples which were then subjected to 16 h of ultracentrifugation at 100,000 rpm in a Beckman TLA-100.1 rotor. This procedure was carried out at 4°C in a Beckman TL-100 Tabletop ultracentrifuge. The rHDL were recovered as the supernatant and subjected to electrophoresis on a 3-35% gradient gel (Gradipore, Sydney, Australia)(25.Rye K.-A. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 335-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, the rHDL were isolated from the incubation mixtures by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 rpm in the 1.063 < d < 1.25 g/ml density range, with two 16-h spins at the lower density and a single 16-h spin at the higher density. These procedures were carried out at 4°C using a Beckman TLA-100.2 rotor in a Beckman TL-100 Tabletop ultracentrifuge. As judged by gradient gel electrophoresis, the rHDL in the 1.063 < d < 1.25 g/ml density range were identical in size to the rHDL isolated as the fraction of d < 1.25 g/ml. For the experiments with VLDL, HDL3, and CETP, the VLDL and HDL3 were isolated from the incubation mixtures as the supernatant and infranatant, respectively, after 16 h of ultracentrifugation at 100,000 rpm at a density of 1.019 g/ml. A Beckman TLA-100.2 rotor and a Beckman TL-100 Tabletop ultracentrifuge maintained at 4°C were used for this procedure. Completeness of the separation of VLDL and HDL3 was established by the absence of apoB in the infranatant and the absence of apoA-I in the supernatant. For these studies rHDL (final CE concentration 0.1 mmol/liter) were incubated for 24 h at 37°C with Intralipid (final TG concentration 4.0 mmol/liter) in the presence of TBS or TBS plus CETP (2.7 units/ml). The final volume of the incubation mixtures was 26 ml. When the incubations were complete the rHDL were isolated in the 1.063 < d < 1.25 g/ml density range with two 24-h spins at the lower density and a single 40-h spin at the higher density. A Beckman Ti 50 rotor was used for these procedures. The spins were carried out at 50,000 rpm in a Beckman L8-M ultracentrifuge maintained at 4°C. The isolated rHDL were dialyzed against TBS and subjected to nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. The respective diameters of the rHDL after incubation in the absence and presence of CETP were 9.2 and 8.0 nm (result not shown). Spectroscopic studies were carried out with a Perkin Elmer LS-50 luminescence spectrometer fitted with a thermostatted cell holder and polarizers. The cell holder was connected to a Lauda RM6T recirculating water bath (Lauda-Königshofen, Germany) and sample temperatures were monitored with a digital temperature probe (Baker Medical Research Institute, Melbourne, Australia). Uncorrected intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 380 nm using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm. The respective excitation and emission band passes were 10 and 5 nm. Intrinsic steady state fluorescence polarization values were determined using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm and excitation and emission band passes of 5 nm. These measurements were carried out at 25°C. Packing of rHDL phospholipid head groups was monitored with 1-(4-trimethylammoniumphenyl)-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene p-toluenesulfonate (TMA-DPH)(26.Prendergast F.G. Haugland R.P. Callahan P.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 7333-7338Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Packing of phospholipid acyl chains at the interface of the rHDL core and surface monolayer was assessed with 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH)(27.Ben-Yashar V. Barenholz Y. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1991; 60: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Steady state fluorescence polarization of the TMA-DPH-labeled and DPH-labeled rHDL was measured at 5°C intervals from 5 to 35°C using an excitation wavelength of 366 nm. Polarity of rHDL lipid-water interfacial regions was determined with 6-propionyl-2-(dimethylamino)-naphthalene (PRODAN)(28.Weber G. Farris F.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3075-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). The wavelength of maximum fluorescence of PRODAN-labeled rHDL was determined from 390 to 600 nm uncorrected emission spectra using an excitation wavelength of 366 nm and respective excitation and emission band passes of 5 and 6 nm. Labeling of the rHDL with DPH, TMA-DPH, and PRODAN was carried out exactly as described previously(12.Rye K.-A. Garrety K.H. Barter P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1167: 316-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In all cases the molar ratio of probe/sample was 500:1 and the final concentration of phospholipid was 0.5 mM. The stability of apoA-I in the rHDL was assessed by incubation with increasing concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl). The rHDL were added to aliquots of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0-8 M GdnHCl. The final concentration of apoA-I in these mixtures was 20 μg/ml. Wavelengths of maximum fluorescence were determined from 300 to 380 nm emission scans using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm. The respective excitation and emission band passes were 10 and 5 nm. Initial readings (t = 0 h) were made at 25°C, immediately after the rHDL had been added to the GdnHCl solutions. Measurements at t = 2, 4, 6, and 24 h were made after the samples had been incubated at 25°C for the appropriate time. To determine the fraction of exposed apoA-I Trp residues in the rHDL, fluorescence quenching studies were carried out with KI. Varying amounts of a 5 M KI stock solution were added to aliquots of rHDL so that the final concentration of KI ranged from 0 to 0.33 M and the final concentration of apoA-I was 20 μg/ml. The KI stock solution contained 1 mM Na2S2O4 to inhibit the formation of I3-, which interferes with Trp fluorescence(29.Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3254-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar). To ensure the samples were of comparable ionic strengths, appropriate amounts of 5 M NaCl were added where necessary. The samples were incubated at 25°C for 30 min to allow for uptake of quencher. Fluorescence intensities of the samples were determined from areas under the curves of 310-390 nm uncorrected emission spectra using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm and respective excitation and emission band passes of 10 and 5 nm. Emission spectra of blank samples containing TBS and appropriate concentrations of KI and NaCl were subtracted from the spectra of rHDL. The results were analyzed according to the modified Stern-Volmer equation(29.Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3254-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar),IoIo-I=1fa+1faKs[KI](Eq. 2) where Io is the emission intensity in the absence of quencher, I is the emission intensity in the presence of quencher, fa is the fraction of Trp residues exposed to quencher and Ks is the Stern-Volmer quenching constant. Plots of (Io)/(Io - I) versus 1/([KI]) were linear, with r = 0.997 for lipid-free apoA-I, 0.897 for the 9.2 nm rHDL, and 0.964 for the 8.0 nm rHDL. The α-helical content of rHDL apoA-I was determined by circular dichroism. These studies were carried out by Professor W. Sawyer, Department of Biochemistry, University of Melbourne, Australia. The rHDL were adjusted to an apoA-I concentration of 0.15 mg/ml with 0.02 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and dialyzed against the same buffer. Spectra were recorded from 190 to 250 nm at 24°C on an AVIV circular dichroism spectrometer (AVIV Associates Inc., Lakewood, NJ). Wavelength increments were 0.2 nm and the averaging time for each point was 3 s. The %α-helix was calculated from a fit of the entire spectrum using a mean residue weight of 116.5 for apoA-I. PL, UC, total cholesterol, and TG assays were carried out on a Cobas Fara Centrifugal Analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Zurich, Switzerland) using Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany) kits. TG without free glycerol was measured in the TG assay. Esterified cholesterol concentrations were calculated as the difference between total cholesterol and UC concentrations. Apolipoprotein concentrations were measured by an immunoturbidometric assay(30.Hopkins G.J. Barter P.J. Atherosclerosis. 1989; 75: 73-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Cross-linking experiments were carried out as described by Staros(31.Staros J.V. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3950-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). For immunoblot analysis, aliquots of incubation mixtures which had not been ultracentrifuged were subjected to nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with sheep anti-human apoA-I antiserum (Boehringer Mannheim)(32.Liang H.-Q. Rye K.-A. Barter P.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1187-1199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This experiment was carried out to define the conditions whereby the size of spherical rHDL decreased during incubation with Intralipid and CETP. The size of the rHDL (Profile A) was not affected by incubation for 24 h at 37°C with TBS (Profile B). Similarly, rHDL size was not affected by incubation with Intralipid for 24 h at 4°C (Profile C) or 37°C (Profile D). In these incubations the final concentrations of rHDL CE and Intralipid TG were 0.5 and 4.0 mmol/liter (molar ratio TG/CE = 8:1), respectively. When the same concentrations of rHDL and Intralipid were incubated for 24 h at 37°C with CETP, the diameter of the rHDL increased (Profile E). The rHDL diameter also increased when the concentration of rHDL CE in the incubation was reduced to 0.25 mmol/liter, but those of CETP and Intralipid were not changed (molar ratio TG/CE = 16:1). In this incubation a minor population of small particles was also apparent (Profile F). Further reductions in the concentration of rHDL CE to 0.1 mmol/liter (molar ratio TG/CE = 40/1) (Profile G) or 0.05 mmol/liter (molar ratio TG/CE = 80:1) (Profile H) promoted quantitative conversion of the rHDL to 8.0-nm particles. It is also evident from Profiles E-H that the proportion of 8.0-nm rHDL in the incubation mixtures increased as the initial concentration of rHDL decreased. In this study rHDL were incubated at 37°C with Intralipid and CETP for times ranging from 0 to 24 h. The final concentrations of rHDL CE and Intralipid TG in the incubations were 0.1 and 4.0 mmol/liter, respectively, giving a molar ratio of TG/CE of 40:1. The diameter of the rHDL (Profile A) was not affected by incubation for 24 h at 37°C with TBS (Profile B). Similarly, rHDL size was not affected by incubation with Intralipid for 24 h at 4°C (Profile C) or 37°C (Profile D). No size changes were evident when the rHDL were incubated for 1 h with Intralipid and CETP (Profile E). After 3 h of incubation with Intralipid and CETP, a minor population of small particles was apparent (Profile F). By 6 h the rHDL had been converted to smaller and larger particles (Profile G). After 12 h only small particles were present (Profile H). There was no further reduction in rHDL size when the incubation was continued for up to 24 h (Profile I). When the incubations were repeated in the presence of fatty acid-free albumin (final concentration 20 mg/ml), the changes in rHDL particle size were identical to those described for the incubations carried out in the absence of albumin. The time course for transfers of CE from rHDL to Intralipid and TG from Intralipid to rHDL is shown in Fig. 3(Panels A-C). At 0 h the rHDL contained a small amount of TG (Fig. 3B). This suggested that there was either a spontaneous transfer of TG from Intralipid to rHDL or that a trace of Intralipid remained in the d > 1.063 g/ml fraction after ultracentrifugation. Incubation with CETP and Intralipid resulted in a time dependent decrease in the concentration of rHDL CE (Fig. 3A). During the first 3 h of incubation, the loss of CE from rHDL was partially offset by a gain of TG from Intralipid (Fig. 3B). When the incubation was extended from 3 to 24 h, the concentration of rHDL TG decreased progressively. Fig. 3C shows that the total concentration of rHDL core lipids (CE plus TG) decreased throughout the incubation.Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab To ensure that the loss of rHDL core lipids in Fig. 3C was not specific for the rHDL-CETP-Intralipid system, a further experiment was carried out whereby native HDL3 were incubated with CETP and VLDL for times ranging from 0 to 24 h. The results of this study showed that the HDL3 lost CE (Fig. 3D), gained TG (Fig. 3E), and sustained a net loss of core lipids throughout the incubation (Fig. 3F). The composition of the rHDL in the time course experiment is shown in Table 1 as the number of moles of each constituent/mol of rHDL. Incubation with Intralipid in the absence of CETP had minimal effect on rHDL composition. When CETP as well as Intralipid were present in the incubation, CE was transferred from rHDL to Intralipid such that only a trace of CE remained in the rHDL by 6 h. During the first 3 h, the loss of CE from the rHDL was partially offset by the acquisition of TG from Intralipid. However, when the incubation was extended from 3 to 24 h there was a progressive loss of TG from the rHDL. The moles of apoA-I/mol of rHDL decreased during the incubation (Table 1). This was confirmed by cross-linking studies, which showed that 9.2- and 8.0-nm rHDL contained three and two molecules of apoA-I/particle, respectively (Table 2). This decrease could be explained either by the dissociation of apoA-I from rHDL or by the formation of large, TG-rich rHDL of d < 1.063 g/ml. Given that (i) there was no loss of phospholipid from the 1.063 < d < 1.25 g/ml fraction (Table 1); (ii) there was no apoA-I in the d < 1.063 g/ml fraction (results not shown); and (iii) the rHDL in the 1.063 < d < 1.25 g/ml density range were identical in size to the rHDL in the d < 1.25 g/ml fraction, it is apparent that TG-rich rHDL of d < 1.063 g/ml were not formed during incubation. The decrease in the number of apoA-I molecules is therefore consistent with the dissociation of apoA-I from rHDL. To assess the extent of the dissociation of apoA-I from rHDL, the concentration of apoA-I in the 1.063 < d < 1.25 g/ml density range was determined as a function of time. In the 4 and 37°C control incubations, the concentration of apoA-I was 75.6 and 74.7 μg/ml, respectively. After 1 h of incubation with CETP and Intralipid, the concentration of apoA-I was 79.3 μg/ml. When the incubation was exten"

Apparent Km values for fructosyl aminocaproate, ∊-fructosyl lysine, fructosyl glycine, and ribated lysine were 0.21 mM, 2.73 mM, 3.52 mM, and 1.57 mM, respectively. The enzyme was also active against α-fructosyl lysine and borohydride-reduced Amadori product, weakly active with ribated and glycated polylysine, and inactive with reducing sugars, amino acids, and glycated proteins. The enzymatic activity was highest at pH 6.5 and 25°C in 0.1 M sodium phosphate, while over 80% of the activity was lost above 65°C.

In contrast, however, the new enzyme acts on the alkylamine bond rather than the ketoamine bond of the Amadori product."

In the vertebrate central nervous system, ionotropic glutamate receptors mediate the fast synaptic action of the major excitatory neurotransmitter, L-glutamate. Traditionally, these receptors have been categorized into functionally different types: α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate receptors, high-affinity kainate receptors, and N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) 1The abbreviations used are: NMDAN-methyl D-aspartateNR1 and NR2NMDA receptor subunits 1 and 2, respectivelykbkilobase(s)bpbase pair(s)PCRpolymerase chain reactionRACErapid amplification of cDNA ends.receptors (reviewed in (3.Cotman C.W.

The α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate receptors mediate the fast component of excitatory postsynaptic currents, whereas the slow component is contributed by the NMDA receptors. The NMDA receptor with its characteristic voltage-dependent Mg2+ block can be considered as a coincidence detector of pre- and postsynaptic activity, and its activation is thought to trigger synaptic modulation underlying memory formation.

Similar to other ligand-gated ion channels, the ionotropic glutamate receptors are composed of subunits. For the NMDA receptor, two types of subunits have been molecularly characterized, and members of both are needed to form an active ion channel. The NMDAR1 (NR1) subunit occurs in virtually every neuron and is likely to be a constituent of all NMDA receptor subtypes. Four distinct NR2 subunits (NR2A to NR2D for rat; ∊1 to ∊4 for mouse) have been isolated(9.Ikeda K. Nagasawa M. Mori H. Araki K. Sakimura K. Watanabe M. Inoue Y. Mishina M.

They are expressed as large precursor polypeptides with an N-terminal signal peptide. The mature subunits are predicted to contain four hydrophobic transmembrane sequences (M1 to M4) and a discontinuous agonist-binding region(14.Burnashev N. Schoepfer R. Monyer H. Ruppersberg J.P. Gunther W. Seeburg P.H. Sakmann B. Science. 1992; 257: 1415-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The NR2 subunits contain a uniquely large C terminus of unknown function. Most members of the ionotropic glutamate receptor family occur as molecularly different variants post-transcriptionally modified by alternative splicing and/or RNA editing. Thus, the NR1 subunit exists in eight different molecular forms(16.Sugihara H. Moriyoshi K. Ishii T. Masu M. Nakanishi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 826-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 17.Hollmann M. Boulter J. Maron C. Beasley L. Sullivan J. Pecht G. Heinemann S. Neuron. 1993; 10: 943-954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). No splice variants have been reported for the NR2 subunits. Here we analyze the gene structure of the murine NR2C ( ∊3) subunit with respect to exon-intron organization, transcriptional start site, alternatively spliced transcripts, and nucleotide differences between gene and transcript and compare the gene organization with that of the NR1 subunit. A 129SV murine genomic library in λFIX II (Stratagene) was screened for NR2C gene sequences using as probe a 0.9-kb Eco47III rat cDNA fragment (see Fig. 1A). Two overlapping phages, λNR2C6 and λNR2C4, covering the whole gene were subcloned in pBluescript SK(-) (Stratagene) using SalI of the λFIX II polylinker and an internal SalI site to create plasmids pNR2C6 and pNR2C4. The clones were analyzed by dye terminator cycle sequencing (ABI Advanced Biotechnologies, Inc.). The following oligonucleotides were used to prime sequencing reactions: sense: bs11 (5′-AGCTCTGGGCCACTGCAGGC-3′), bs16 (5′-CTCAGCTGCTGGATTTCGTC-3′), rsp18 (5′-GCTGGAGACTGCCGAAGCCACC-3′), bs59 (5′-TGGTTGTGATCGCTCTCAACC-3′), bs6 (5′-CTGACCCTGGCACAGGTGGC-3′), bs15 (5′-TGTAAGGGCTTCTGCATCG-3′), bs26 (5′-GAGACCGGCATCAGTGTGATGGTG-3′), rsp17 (5′-GCTACACGGCCAATCTGGCAGC-3′), rsp15 (5′-CCACTGGCTATGGCATTGCC-3′), rsp16 (5′-GGGGAAGCTGGACGCCTTC-3′), bs2 (5′-GCGGTGGCCAGTGCGAGTCG-3′), bs13 (5′-GAACAGCTGGCTCGGCGGGAG-3′), bs21 (5′-CAGCCACAGTCCCTGGCTC-3′), and bs28 (5′-CAGGGAAGCTTGTGGGACACAAG-3′); and antisense: bs10 (5′-GTGGCTGGATCTCCAGAGGC-3′), bs29 (5′-CAGCCCTGCCCAAGCACCAAGGAG-3′), bs8 (5′-CGGTGCTTCCCAGCGCCAG-3′), bs24 (5′-CTGCTCCAGGGACACGCCCAGCTG-3′), bs25 (5′-GTGCTGTAGCGAGGCCATACTGG-3′), bs18 (5′-AGTCGTAGGAGAACTTGAC-3′), bs14 (5′-ACATCATCACCCACACGGC-3′), bs5 (5′-TCTTGTCACTAAGGCCCGAC-3′), bs20 (5′-GTTCTCGATGGGAACAGAG-3′), bs3 (5′-TGCCATAGCCAGTGGTGGC-3′), bs23 (5′-CATGTTGTCAATGTCCAGC-3′), and bs1 (5′-TATGGGTGTGCAGGCAGAC-3′). Additionally, the following intronic primers were used: sense: bs61 (5′-GCTGGGTCTGAGGATGTGACCAG-3′), bs17 (5′-GTCCTAGTCAGAGCCACATC-3′), bs54 (5′-CCAGTGATGAAGGGTGTGAGG-3′), bs4 (5′-GTGTCTAAGACTGTGCAGG-3′), bs60 (5′-CAGAGAAGCTCTCCGTCTGAG-3′), and rsp14 (5′-GGGAGCACACAGTTAGGAC-3′); and antisense: bs7 (5′-GATAAGGATTCTAAGACCCAG-3′), bs52 (5′-CACCGTCCCACCTGCAGAGGAC-3′), bs55 (5′-CGCATCCCTCTAACATGGGAG-3′), and bs27 (5′-TCCTAGTCGGGAGAAGTCCAGCAG-3′). In situ hybridization on horizontal sections of adult mouse and rat brains was performed as described (1.Keinänen K. Wisden W. Sommer B. Werner P. Herb A. Verdoorn T.A. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1990; 249: 556-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar) using for the large splice variant the selective antisense oligonucleotide bs42 (5′-GCCAGAGTACAGAGAACCTTCCTAGTCCAAGCACA-3′) and for the small splice variant the oligonucleotide bs41 (5′-ACCCATGTCCACTGGAGGGTCCTAGTCCAAGCACA-3′). Hybridization was at 37°C in 5 × SSC, 40% formamide. Sections were washed in 1 × SSC at 55°C and exposed to x-ray film at −70°C for 2 weeks. Poly(A)+ RNA (10 μg) isolated from mouse cerebellum was resolved on a 1% agarose gel containing 6% formaldehyde. The gel-resolved RNA was transferred onto a nylon filter. The filter was probed with a 32P-labeled 0.6-kb Eco47III rat cDNA fragment covering exons 9-12 (see Fig. 1A). Hybridization conditions were 5 × Denhardt's solution, 3 × SSC, 0.12 M Na2HPO4, 5 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 200 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 50% formamide at 42°C for 12 h. The membrane was washed in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55°C and exposed to x-ray film at −70°C. BALB/c mouse liver DNA digested with HindIII, KpnI, and XhoI was resolved on a 0.8% agarose gel and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was hybridized with the same 32P-labeled 0.9-kb Eco47III rat cDNA fragment used for screening the genomic library. Hybridization was carried out in 0.12 M Na2HPO4, 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1 mg/ml yeast tRNA, 30% formamide for 12 h at 42°C. After hybridization, the membrane was washed in 0.2 × SSC at 65°C for 30 min and exposed to x-ray film at −70°C for 3 days. RNA was isolated from the cerebellums of 3-4-week-old BALB/c mice. Total RNA (5 μg) was transcribed into cDNA using 30 nmol of random 10-mer oligonucleotides (Boehringer Mannheim). Of this cDNA, 2 ng were used as template in a polymerase chain reaction. A sense oligonucleotide (bs37, exon 3, 5′-GCTCTAGATCCCCGACGGCTGAGAGGA-3′) and an antisense oligonucleotide (bs38, exon 4, 5′-CCGAATTCTGCCCAAGCACCAAGGAG-3′) served as primers. These oligonucleotides contain XbaI or EcoRI sites to facilitate subcloning and DNA sequencing of PCR products. To determine the 3′-terminal mRNA sequence including the polyadenylation site, a RACE protocol (CLONTECH) was carried out. From 2 μg of cerebellar poly(A)+ RNA of 3-4-week-old BALB/c mice, first-strand cDNA was primed using an adaptor (dT) 17 (5′-GAGAGAGAGAGACTCGAGTCGACGCGTCGCGATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′). The 3′-end of the cDNA was specifically amplified in a PCR in which the same (dT) 17 and a sense oligonucleotide (bs49, exon 15, 5′-GTTGAGTGGGGCCAACTCACC-3′) were used as primers. Blunt-ended products were gel-purified and cloned into M13mp19 replicative form DNA linearized at the HincII site. Twelve independent clones as judged from the different insert lengths were subjected to sequence analysis. For 5′-end analysis, 30 nmol of random 10-mer oligonucleotides were used to prime cDNA synthesis. The RNA/DNA hybrid was hydrolyzed with 6 N NaOH and purified on glass beads (CLONTECH). A poly(A) tail was synthesized at the 3′-end of the cDNA using terminal transferase (Boehringer Mannheim) for 5 min at 37°C. Polymerase chain reaction was then performed with two primers: an adaptor (dT) 17 (see above) and an antisense oligonucleotide, bs40 (exon 1, 5′-CGCAAAGGCGCGCCTCCCGCTCTC-3′) or bs48 (exon 1, 5′-CCGAATTCGGGGCTGTGTCCCGGCTGCGCAAAGGCGCGC-3′). PCR products (diffuse bands) were gel-purified and inserted into the pGEM-T vector (Promega). Twenty clones with different insert sizes were sequenced for analysis of the 5′-cDNA. Total RNA (50 μg) from mouse cerebellum was hybridized with a 32P-labeled antisense RNA synthesized in vitro from a cloned mouse NR2C gene fragment (positions −1142 to −712). RNase protection was performed according to (2.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The protected RNA was resolved on an 8 M urea, 5% polyacrylamide gel using a DNA sequencing ladder for size determination. An in vitro generated sense RNA (positions −772 to −731) served as a positive control. Hybridization of this RNA to the radiolabeled RNA probe leads to the protection from RNase of a 42-bp RNA duplex. No protected material was seen by hybridizing the RNA probe to tRNA followed by RNase digestion. The sequences for the 15 exons of the mouse NR2C gene have been deposited in the EMBL/GenBankTM data base under accession numbers L35014 to L35028. The upstream region of the mouse gene can be accessed under accession number L35029. Recombinant λ phages carrying the NR2C subunit gene were isolated from a mouse genomic library using a rat cDNA fragment as a hybridization probe. Detailed restriction and sequence analysis of the exonic and most intronic regions in two recombinant overlapping λ clones indicated that the coding region of the gene is spread over 12,800 bp. The gene is divided into 12 exons (Fig. 1A), and all nucleotide sequences flanking the exons (Fig. 2B) match the consensus splice donor and acceptor sequences. The mouse genomic coding sequence and the reported cDNA sequence for ∊3 (10.Kutsuwada T. Kashiwabuchi N. Mori H. Sakimura K. Kushiya E. Araki K. Meguro H. Masaki H. Kumanishi T. Arakawa M. Mishina M. Nature. 1992; 358: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar) differ by five nucleotide exchanges. The nucleotide insertion at position 2924 and the subsequent deletion at position 3037 might reflect a sequencing error in the mouse cDNA since the rat cDNA (11.Monyer H. Sprengel R. Schoepfer R.

Nucleotide substitutions at positions 2909, 3293 (C to A), and 3407 (C to T) are unique in the genomic sequences. They affect the amino acid composition of the NR2C domains and therefore might reflect allelic variations or site-specific RNA editing (18.Sommer B. Köhler M. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Cell. 1991; 67: 11-19Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar) in the mouse NR2C locus. The NR2C gene exists as a single copy in the haploid mouse genome, consistent with the localization of the NR2C gene to human chromosome 7q25(19.Takano H. Onodera O. Tanaka H. Mori H. Sakimura K. Hori T. Kobayashi H. Mishina M. Tsuji S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 922-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A Southern analysis of murine liver DNA using as a probe a cDNA fragment specific for exons 12-15 revealed a fragment pattern that was consistent with the restriction map generated for isolated NR2C gene fragments (Fig. 1E). NR2C mRNA in adult BALB/c mouse brain is 4.9 kb in length (Fig. 1D). This transcript terminates 18 nucleotides 3′ of the polyadenylation signal AUUAAA, 385 bp after the translational stop (Fig. 2C), as revealed by specific PCR amplification of the 3′-end of the NR2C mRNA. An additional, minor NR2C transcript of 12 kb has been observed in a different mouse strain(10.Kutsuwada T. Kashiwabuchi N. Mori H. Sakimura K. Kushiya E. Araki K. Meguro H. Masaki H. Kumanishi T. Arakawa M. Mishina M. Nature. 1992; 358: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar), but was not detected in BALB/c. The 5′-untranslated leader sequence of the NR2C gene, 772 nucleotides in length, is interrupted by three introns. This became apparent when the 5′-untranslated sequences of cloned rat NR2C cDNAs were compared with the mouse genomic sequence. Gene and cDNA sequences diverge upstream of base −112 and become colinear in three subsequent exons after a long intron of 6 kb. PCR amplification of the 5′-untranslated region revealed that two alternative splice products exist for the mouse NR2C mRNA (Fig. 1A). These differ by 97 nucleotides, and both forms can be readily detected by in situ hybridization in the granule cell layer of adult mouse cerebellum (Fig. 1B). In adult rat brain, at least two additional splice variants exist, one containing an additional 58 nucleotides of exonic sequence located between exons 3 and 4. The 58-bp exon is present in one of the rat NR2C cDNA sequences (15.Ishii T. Moriyoshi K. Sugihara H. Sakurada K. Kadotani H. Yokoi M. Akazawa C. Shigemoto R. Mizuno N. Masu M. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2836-2843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in PCR-amplified products of rat brain NR2C cDNA (data not shown), but was not detected in intron 3 of the mouse gene, as judged by hybridization analysis. For the transcriptional start site of the NR2C mRNA, two positions, −772 and −754 nucleotides upstream of the translational start site, were identified by rapid amplification of 5′-ends (see “Materials and Methods”) using the antisense oligonucleotides that prime 42 and 61 nucleotides downstream of the putative transcriptional start site (Fig. 2A). These initiation sites were confirmed by RNase protection of radiolabeled antisense RNA produced from a genomic fragment (positions −1142 to −712) with 50 μg of total RNA from mouse cerebellum. One prominent RNA fragment corresponding to initiation site −754 was protected from RNase digestion. The signal for initiation site −772 was weak and diffuse and was only visible after longer exposure times. One of the transcriptional start sites (position −772) is localized in the consensus sequence pattern YYA+1T/AYY, which is described as the transcriptional initiator for polymerase II transcripts in TATA-containing and TATA-less promoters(20.Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). As in these initiators, NR2C transcription starts at the first A within this element. The region immediately upstream of the identified transcriptional start sites lacks consensus CAAT or TATA sequence motifs, but is highly GC-rich (72-85%), similar to the high GC content of the neighboring, untranslated exon 1. Sequences corresponding to motifs implicated in binding transcription factor Sp1 (GGGGCGGGGC, position −813)(21.Dynan W.S. Saffer J.D. Lee W.S. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1983; 219: 626-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) are located 41, 250, and 385 nucleotides, respectively, upstream of the major transcriptional start sites. The biological importance of these sites needs investigating. The NR2C gene is the first NR2 subunit gene for which a structure has been determined. When compared with the exon-intron organization of other characterized glutamate receptor subunit genes, e.g. rat GluR-B(26.Köhler M. Kornau H.C. Seeburg P.H. J. Biol.

Neuron. 1993; 10: 943-954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar), a close evolutionary origin of NR1 and NR2C subunits can be confirmed. Only between the mouse NR2C gene and the rat NR1 gene were most introns found to interrupt the coding area of the genes in similar or even identical positions (introns 4, 11, and 12 of the NR2C gene and introns 2, 16, 17 of the NR1 gene) (Fig. 3). The NR2C gene contains fewer introns than the gene for NR1 since some of the exons encoding the N-terminal NR2C subunit domain and exons encoding M2 and M3 are fused. Thus, in agreement with the phylogenetic tree(24.Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 325: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 25.Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3662) Google Scholar) and the fact that the NR1 subunit forms functional homomeric channels, the NR1 subunit can be considered to be the oldest member of the NMDA receptor subunit family.

https://openalex.org/W2088609832,"Copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD-1) is an enzyme that is widely expressed in eukaryotic cells and performs a vital role in protecting cells against free radical damage. In mouse testis, three different sizes of SOD-1 mRNAs of about 0.73, 0.80, and 0.93 kilobases (kb) are detected. The 0.73-kb mRNA is found in early stages of male germ cells and in all somatic tissues. The mRNAs of 0.80 and 0.93 kb are exclusively detected in post-meiotic germ cells. RNase H digestions and Northern blot analyses reveal that the three SOD-1 mRNAs are derived from two transcripts, a ubiquitously expressed transcript and a post-meiotic transcript, which differ by 114-120 nucleotides. RNase protection assays demonstrate that the additional nucleotides present in the post-meiotic mRNA are solely in the 5′-untranslated region. Using a probe derived from the 5′-untranslated region of the 0.93-kb SOD-1 mRNA, we have established that it originates from an alternative upstream promoter contiguous with the somatic SOD-1 promoter. Polysomal gradient analysis of the three mouse testis SOD-1 mRNAs reveals that the 0.93-kb SOD-1 mRNA is primarily non-polysomal, while the 0.80- and 0.73-kb SOD-1 mRNAs are mostly polysome associated. A faster migrating form of the 0.93-kb SOD-1 mRNA is present on polysomes as a result of partial deadenylation. In a cell-free translation system, the 0.73-kb SOD-1 mRNA translates about 2-fold more efficiently than the 0.93-kb SOD-1 mRNA. These data demonstrate that male germ cells transcribe two size classes of SOD-1 mRNAs with different translation potential by utilizing two different promoters, post-meiotic SOD-1 mRNAs undergo adenylation changes, and one of the post-meiotic SOD-1 mRNAs is transcribed during mid-spermiogenesis and translated days later in a partially deadenylated form. Copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD-1) is an enzyme that is widely expressed in eukaryotic cells and performs a vital role in protecting cells against free radical damage. In mouse testis, three different sizes of SOD-1 mRNAs of about 0.73, 0.80, and 0.93 kilobases (kb) are detected. The 0.73-kb mRNA is found in early stages of male germ cells and in all somatic tissues. The mRNAs of 0.80 and 0.93 kb are exclusively detected in post-meiotic germ cells.

INTRODUCTIONIn photosynthetic eukaryotes, the Photosystem II (PSII) reaction center mediates the photooxidation of water to molecular oxygen, providing electrons to the photosynthetic electron transfer chain and releasing protons into the lumen of the chloroplast thylakoid membrane. At least five nuclear-encoded and thirteen chloroplast-encoded PSII polypeptide subunits have been identified (for reviews, see Erickson and Rochaix(1992) and Ikeuchi(1992)). The function of PSII centers active on both the donor and acceptor sides, as outlined in Fig. 1 and described in the legend, requires the interaction of the PSII polypeptides and their assembly with the lipid, metal, and ionic cofactors of PSII. At the heart of PSII structure and function is a heterodimer composed of two intrinsic membrane polypeptides, D1 and D2 (Nanba and Satoh, 1987; Marder et al., 1987; Webber et al., 1989; Tang et al., 1990). These two chloroplast-encoded polypeptides provide ligands for the reaction center chlorophyll P680, pheophytin, and the primary and secondary quinone acceptor molecules of PSII, QA and QB, respectively (Trebst, 1987; Svensson et al., 1990; Ruffle et al., 1991).Central to PSII water oxidation is a cluster of 4 manganese ions which advances in oxidation state as electrons are donated from it to the photooxidized PSII reaction center chlorophyll, P680+. When 4 oxidizing eq are accumulated in the manganese cluster, 1 molecule of oxygen is released and the cycle of manganese oxidation begins again (see Fig. 1 legend). The minimal, purified chloroplast PSII particle that retains maximal oxygen-evolving activity in vitro, in the absence of elevated levels of Ca2+ or Cl− (reviewed in Critchley (1985) and Andersson and Åkerlund(1987)), consists of the D1•D2 heterodimer, several additional intrinsic membrane polypeptides, and three extrinsic membrane polypeptides referred to as the oxygen evolution enhancer (OEE) 1The abbreviations used are: OEEoxygen evolution enhancerOECoxygen-evolving complexkbkilobase(s)bpbase pair(s)RFLPrestriction fragment length polymorphismDCMU3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylureaeqequivalents.polypeptides, OEE1, OEE2, and OEE3, of approximately 33, 23, and 17 kDa, respectively. The OEE polypeptides are localized to the lumenal side of PSII and participate with the intrinsic PSII polypeptides in the formation of a fully activated chloroplast oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) (reviewed in Andersson and Åkerlund(1987), Ghanotakis and Yocum (1990), Debus(1992), and Rutherford et al.(1992)). It is generally agreed that the OEC active site, containing Ca2+ and 4 manganese atoms, requires 20 to 24 coordinating ligands provided mainly by oxygen, but with some nitrogen (DeRose et al., 1991). Histidine is now known to be a ligand (Tang et al., 1994), and additional coordination to manganese may be provided by carboxylate and amide moieties and perhaps tyrosine. Most evidence suggests that it is the D1 and, possibly, D2 polypeptides which coordinate manganese (reviewed in Diner et al.(1991), Debus (1992), and Vermaas and Pakrasi(1992)). Aspartate residue 170 (Asp-170) of the D1 polypeptide is found in the lumen only 9 amino acid residues away from D1 tyrosine 161 (YZ) which directly accepts electrons from manganese (Debus et al., 1988; Metz et al., 1989). Asp-170 is conserved in the predicted D1 sequences of all 38 species of photosynthetic eukaryotes and cyanobacteria reviewed (Svensson et al., 1991). The role of aspartate 170 of the D1 polypeptide was recently examined in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803 (Nixon and Diner, 1992; Boerner et al., 1992). These authors found that substitutions at this site abolished or reduced oxygen evolution in mutant cyanobacteria. Results of in vitro spectroscopic analysis of PSII particles isolated from mutant cyanobacteria suggest that D1 aspartate 170 plays an important role in the stable assembly of the manganese cluster of the cyanobacterial OEC.Although photosynthesis in the prokaryotic cyanobacteria is similar in many respects to photosynthetic function in eukaryotic plants and algae, there are several features unique to the structure, function, regulation, and stability of the photosynthetic apparatus of the chloroplast. In eukaryotes, the photosystems are located in a thylakoid membrane within the chloroplast and, hence, totally isolated from the plasma membrane of the cell. Moreover, since the genes encoding polypeptides localized to the chloroplast thylakoid membrane are contained in two distinct genetic compartments as noted above, assembly of the chloroplast photosynthetic apparatus requires the coordinate expression of genes located in the nuclear genome and in the chloroplast genome, the latter of which is polyploid. This genetic complexity is in contrast to the prokaryotic cyanobacteria which lack intracellular organelles and which contain only one genome. Cyanobacteria also lack the highly ordered stacking of thylakoids into appressed and nonappressed membrane regions. There are substantial differences between cyanobacteria and chloroplast thylakoids with respect to the light-harvesting antennae polypeptides and pigments associated with the photosystems, the regulatory mechanisms affecting photosynthetic function (e.g. phosphorylation of the chloroplast reaction center polypeptides), and the ratio of PSII to PSI centers. There are also differences in PSII polypeptide composition. Cyanobacteria lack homologues for the OEE2 and OEE3 polypeptides (Stewart et al., 1985; Shen et al., 1992), and, although an OEE1 homologue exists, site-directed mutagenesis of the cyanobacterial OEE1 gene suggests that OEE1 is not essential for cyanobacterial PSII oxygen evolution in vivo (Bockholt et al., 1991; Mayes et al., 1991; Philbrick et al., 1991; Burnap et al., 1992). This is in marked contrast to the requirement for OEE1 and OEE2 in chloroplast oxygen evolution in vivo (Mayfield et al., 1987a, 1987b). Finally, differences in the interaction of PSII subunits are reflected by the fact that, in chloroplasts, loss of one subunit constituent has a more drastic consequence on the stability of the entire PSII complex (reviewed in Rochaix(1992)).There has been until now little evidence as to whether specific changes in PSII polypeptide structure that affect PSII function in cyanobacteria would have a similar affect on the chloroplastic PSII. Given the above differences between photosynthesis in cyanobacteria and in the chloroplast of eukaryotes, we have undertaken studies to examine the relationship between PSII structure and donor-side function in a eukaryotic photosynthetic organism, C. reinhardtii. This unicellular green alga provides an excellent experimental system for a molecular and genetic approach to dissecting chloroplast PSII structure-function relationships (Rochaix and Erickson, 1988). DNA-mediated transformation of the nuclear (Debuchy et al., 1989; Fernandez et al., 1989; Mayfield and Kindle, 1990) and chloroplast (Boynton et al., 1988) genomes of this algae has been successful. Advantages of using Chlamydomonas to study PSII function include the much greater variable fluorescence compared to cyanobacteria, which allows for the rapid screening of algal colonies for mutant fluorescence phenotypes indicative of mutant PSII function, and the ability of Chlamydomonas to grow heterotrophically in the light or dark, which allows for easy maintenance of mutant strains deficient in photosynthesis. Here we report the site-directed mutagenesis of codon 170 of the chloroplast psbA gene encoding the D1 polypeptide of C. reinhardtii, the in vivo characterization of PSII function in algal transformants with amino acid substitutions at D1 residue 170, and our conclusions that residue 170 is critical for assembly and/or stability of manganese in the OEC of the chloroplast PSII.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial and Algal StrainsEscherichia coli strains C600 and DH5α (Sambrook et al., 1989) and MV1190 (Messing, 1983) were used as hosts for cloning and production of plasmid DNAs. The E. coli dut−ung− strain CJ236 (Kunkel et al., 1987) was obtained from Bio-Rad and used for production of single-stranded phagemid DNA containing uracil. C. reinhardtii 2137 mt+ and 137y mt+ wild-type photosynthetic strains a nd the psbA deletion-mutant strain FuD7 mt+ (Bennoun et al., 1986) were used as hosts for chloroplast transformation. The 2137 and FuD7 strains are green in the dark, while the 137y strain is green only when grown in the light. Growth medium containing acetate (TAP) and minimal medium (HSM) were prepared as in Rochaix et al.(1988). Host and transformant algal cells used for phenotypic assays were grown in TAP liquid medium under low light (10- 12μmol m−2 s−1) at 25°C and harvested when cultures reached midlog stage. Photon flux densities were measured using a quantum radiometer (LI 185B, LiCor, Inc.).Plasmid DNA Constructs and Site-directed MutagenesisThe C. reinhardtii chloroplast restriction fragments contained in plasmids pRR, pRX, pRRX, and pXb1.8 are shown in Fig. 2. The EcoRI chloroplast restriction fragment R16 containing psbA exons 1-4 was cloned in the plasmid vector pBR328 (Erickson et al., 1984) and is here called pRR. The 1.8-kb XbaI fragment containing part of exon 2 and all of exon 3 was subcloned from pRR into the Bluescript KS+ phagemid vector (Stratagene) to produce plasmid pXb1.8. Mutant pXb1.8 plasmids were produced by site-directed mutagenesis as described below. A derivative of plasmid pRR which lacks the 1.8-kb XbaI fragment (pRR-ΔXb1.8) was obtained after digesting pRR DNA with XbaI and religating. Mutant pRR plasmids were constructed by inserting the Xb1.8 fragment isolated from a mutant Xb1.8 plasmid into the XbaI site of pRR-ΔXb1.8. pRX was produced by cloning the 5.7-kb EcoRI/XhoI subfragment of C. reinhardtii chloroplast DNA EcoRI restriction fragment R24 (Rochaix, 1978) into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of the Bluescript SK+ vector. The wild-type pRRX was constructed by inserting the wild-type R16 DNA fragment isolated from pRR into the single EcoRI site of pRX. Mutant pRRX plasmids were constructed using mutant pRR and wild-type pRX. Digestion of pRRX plasmids with XbaI was used to verify the correct orientation of psbA exons 1-4 with respect to exon 5. pPX261, used as a probe for RFLP screening of site-directed algal transformants, was obtained by inserting the 261-bp PstI/XbaI fragment isolated from pXb1.8 (see Fig. 3C) into the Bluescript SK+ vector. Conditions for ligation and bacterial transformation are as described in Sambrook et al.(1989). Plasmid DNAs used for transformation of algal cells were CsCl or column (Qiagen) purified from bacterial lysates.Figure 2Restriction map of the C. reinhardtii chloroplast psbA and rRNA genes and the mutations introduced at psbA codon 170. Upper: black boxes indicate the five exons of psbA (1-5) and the 16 S, 7 S, 3 S, 23 S, and 5 S rRNA genes. Hatched boxes indicate the four psbA introns and the intron in the 23 S rRNA gene. Bars above the restriction map show the relative locations of psbA DNA fragments cloned into recombinant plasmids pXb1.8, pRR, pRX, and pRRX. pCrBH4.8 contains a mutant 16 S rRNA gene which confers spectinomycin resistance to cells (Harris et al., 1989; Newman et al., 1990).

Analysis of DNA isolated from spectinomycin-resistant C. reinhardtii transformants shows the segregation of wild-type and mutant chloroplast DNA BsrI fragments containing a portion of psbA exon 3. DNA samples were prepared from 1.5-ml liquid cultures derived from 8 independent initial isolates (panel A) obtained after co-transformation of the WT2137 algal host with pCrBH4.8 and pRR-D170T plasmid DNAs (see Fig. 2) and from subsequent colony isolates (panel B) produced from the initial isolate shown in lane 3 of panel A. DNAs were subjected to BsrI restriction digestion and 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. Panels A and B show exposures obtained by autoradiography of Southern blots hybridized with a radiolabeled probe (261-bp fragment from pPXb261) indicated above the restriction map in panel C. A portion of psbA exon 3 is indicated by the black box. Restriction enzyme sites are given for BsrI (Bs), PstI (P), and XbaI (Xb). The BsrI site introduced by the D170T mutation in exon 3 is indicated with a star.

A synthetic 25-mer oligonucleotide homologous to the region of psbA surrounding codon 170 (sequence given in Fig. 2) but mutant at the third position of the codon (T) and degenerate at the first (C/A/T) and second (A/C) positions, was used to prime second strand DNA synthesis.Chloroplast Transformation and Selection and Screening of TransformantsAlgal host cells were harvested from liquid culture at midlog stage and 2 × 107 cells spread over the surface of a Nytran nylon membrane filter (0.45 μm, 82-mm diameter, Schleicher and Schull) placed on a TAP agar plate. Tungsten M10 particles (∼0.4-1.5 μm in diameter, now distributed by Bio-Rad) were obtained from Biolistics Inc., Ithaca, NY. 2.5 mg of M10 tungsten particles were coated, as otherwise described by Sanford et al.(1993), with 2.5 μg each of a psbA transforming plasmid construct and the mutant 16 S rRNA spectinomycin resistance plasmid p228 (Newman et al., 1990; received from K. Kindle as pCrBH4.8, see Fig. 2). Biolistic transformation was carried out with the PDS-1000/He (DuPont NEN) as instructed by the manufacturer, with the macrocarrier positioned 1 cm from the rupture disc (1100 p.s.i.) and 1 cm from the stopping screen.Bombarded plates were incubated ∼16 h in the dark, after which filters containing cells were transferred to selective medium. TAP-SPEC agar (165 μg of spectinomycin dihydrochloride/ml) selected for spectinomycin-resistant cells. The spectinomycin-resistant control transformant lines WTsr (from transformation of 137y with p228) and FWTsr (from co-transformation of FuD7 with wild-type pRRX and p228) were isolated. An additional control strain, FWT, was produced by transformation of FuD7 with wild-type pRRX DNA followed by selection for growth on minimal medium (HSM) in the light. Initial colonies were picked into liquid medium and replated on selective medium, and secondary colony isolates were obtained. Primary and secondary isolates were subjected to colony hybridization and/or RFLP screening. All incubations during recovery, selection, screening, and routine maintenance of transformant cell lines were carried out in the dark.Southern Blot Analysis and Colony HybridizationNucleic acids were isolated from ∼50 μl of algal cell pellet as described (Newman et al., 1990) except that the Pronase was omitted from the lysis buffer. DNAs were digested with restriction enzymes, separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred to a nylon membrane filter (Genescreen Plus, DuPont NEN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 65°C as described (Church and Gilbert, 1984). Radiolabeled probes (BRL Random Primers DNA labeling system) were prepared using gel-purified DNA restriction fragments and [α32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham). Autoradiograms were obtained with X-Omat AR film (XAR5, Kodak).Algal colonies grown on nylon membrane filters were screened by colony hybridization using a modification of the method developed for bacterial colonies (Grunstein and Hogness, 1975) as follows. Nylon filters were placed colony side up, for 2 min each treatment, onto 0.75-ml puddles of the following solutions, in sequence: 10% SDS (3 × 0.75 ml); 0.5 M NaOH, 1.5 M NaCl (3 × 0.75 ml); and 0.5 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.5 M NaCl (3 × 0.75 ml). After each puddle treatment, excess liquid was removed from the filter using a Büchner funnel connected to a vacuum line. Filters were processed and hybridized as described above for Southern blot analysis.DNA Sequence Analysis from DNA and RNA TemplatesThe universal and KS Bluescript primers (Stratagene) and custom primers homologous to regions of psbA intron 2 and intron 3 were used for DNA sequence analysis (Sequenase, U. S. Biochemical Corp.) of mutant plasmid DNAs. Algal RNA was isolated (Johanningmeier et al., 1987), and dideoxy sequencing reactions using [α-35S]dATP (1000 Ci/mmol, Amersham) and ∼10 μg of RNA template were carried out as described (Fichot and Girard, 1990). A synthetic oligonucleotide homologous to exon 4 (5′-TCTGCTTGGAATACGATCAT-3′) was used to prime sequencing of the mutation site in exon 3 and was suitable for reading sequences through to exon 1. A synthetic oligonucleotide homologous to exon 5 (5′-GTTGTTTGAGCTAGAGTT-3′) was used to prime sequencing from the primer through exons 4 and 3. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on a Pharmacia Gene Assembler Plus and purified using a glass matrix (Mermaid, Bio 101 Inc.). Sequencing gels containing 7 M urea and 5% or 8% acrylamide (Long Ranger, AT Biochem. Inc.) were prepared and run according to the manufacturer's instructions.In Situ Fluorescence InductionAlgal cells were grown in low light (6 μmol m−2 s−1) on TAP agar plates. Fluorescence induction transients were recorded from cell patches using the Heinz-Walz pulse-amplitude-modulated fluorimeter (Schreiber, 1986). Actinic illumination (1500 μmol m−2 s−1, white incandescent light) was controlled by a shutter (opening time < 2 ms), and transients were stored using a microcomputer running the Heinz-Walz DA100 program. Cells were dark-adapted for at least 10 min prior to assay at room temperature.Quantification of PSIIPSII in whole cells was quantified by measuring the number of [14C]diuron binding sites which were sensitive to competitive dissociation in the presence of 20 μM nonlabeled atrazine (Vermaas et al., 1990). [14C]diuron (Amersham, 57 Ci mol−1) was diluted in assay buffer to seven different concentrations in the range 5-100 nM, and whole cells were added such that each assay tube contained 50 μg of chlorophyll/ml. Chlorophyll concentration was determined in 80% acetone (Arnon, 1949).Oxygen EvolutionRates of oxygen evolution were measured using an oxygen electrode (Hansatech) connected to a chart recorder. Liquid cultures were incubated in darkness for 2 min prior to illumination with saturating white light (500 μmol m−2 s−1). Rates of oxygen evolution were ∼200 μmol of O2/mg of chlorophyll/h for 2137, 137y, and WTsr. The control transformants FWT and FWTsr displayed maximal rates of oxygen evolution of ∼100 μmol of O2/mg of chlorophyll/h. Rates listed in Table 1 are shown as percentages of control rates of WTsr for all transformants where a wild-type host was used and FWTsr where FuD7 was used as host. The minimal detectable rate of oxygen evolution was ∼0.2 μmol of O2/mg of chlorophyll/h.Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Relaxation of Chlorophyll Fluorescence after Saturating Light FlashesThe rates of relaxation of the chlorophyll fluorescence yield following actinic flashes were measured in whole cells using a flash detection spectrophotometer as described (Nixon and Diner, 1992). Algal cells were suspended in TAP medium at an A422 nm of 0.5. In contrast to previous assays using cyanobacteria (Nixon and Diner, 1992), the algal cells were not pretreated with benzoquinone and ferricyanide. A fresh sample was used for each set of delay times between the actinic and detecting flashes.Oxygen Yields after Saturating Light Flashes and Determination of the Rate of Decay of the S2 StateC. reinhardtii cells in 2 ml of TAP medium, adjusted to contain an additional 100 mM KCl, were sedimented onto the surface of an 11-mm bare platinum disk electrode. This electrode was surrounded by a 1-mm-thick Ag/AgCl ring electrode polarized 0.6 V positive with respect to the Pt electrode. The cells were dark-adapted 5-10 min and then subjected to a series (533 ms apart) of saturating light flashes supplied by a xenon strobe (Gen Rad, 1539A). The oxygen signals were measured from 1-51 ms after the actinic flash and captured by an AC-coupled digital oscilloscope (Nicolet). The signals were transferred to a computer (IBM Model 30) that integrated and tabulated the data. The computer also controlled the number and timing of the xenon flashes. The S2 state lifetimes were determined as in Forbush et al.(1971) (see Fig. 9B legend).Figure 9Oxygen yields from Chlamydomonas cells following saturating light flashes. Panel A, relative yields of oxygen were measured following each of a series of saturating light flashes (533 ms apart) given to dark-adapted whole cells, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The FWTsra (control) and D170Hc (transformant) cells were dark-adapted for 10 min prior to illumination. Panel B, lifetime of the S2 state for these cells under the same conditions as for A. The cells were dark-adapted for 5 min and then given a single saturating light flash. Following this flash and at the time intervals indicated, a series of flashes were given 533 ms apart and the relative amplitude of oxygen was measured on the third overall flash. The relative concentration of the S2 state is plotted as the difference, between the third overall flash yield for delay time (t) and the yield of the third overall flash for a delay time of 5 min, divided by the steady state oxygen flash yield.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RESULTSSite-directed Mutagenesis of psbA Codon 170The D1 polypeptide of PSII is encoded by the chloroplast gene, psbA, which in C. reinhardtii is a split gene containing five exons (Erickson et al.(1984); see Fig. 2). In vitro site-directed mutagenesis of pXb1.8, which contains psbA codon 170, was performed and four different mutant pXb1.8 plasmids were identified and characterized. The nucleotide substitutions introduced at psbA codon 170, the amino acid changes in the predicted protein product (aspartate → histidine, asparagine, threonine, or proline), and restriction endonuclease sites introduced by the mutations are summarized in Fig. 2. The DNA sequence of the psbA exon 2 and exon 3 regions of each mutant pXb1.8 was determined (data not shown). Our results confirmed the presence of the mutation at codon 170 as shown in Fig. 2 and verified that no other changes had been introduced inadvertently into the psbA coding regions contained in the mutant pXb1.8 constructs.To facilitate chloroplast transformation of two different algal hosts, the mutant XbaI fragment from each mutant pXb1.8 was transferred into the larger plasmid constructs, pRR and pRRX (see Fig. 2). The resulting mutant pRR constructs (pRR-D170H, pRR-D170N, pRR-D170T, pRR-D170P) were used in co-transformation experiments in which the wild-type photosynthetic C. reinhardtii strains 2137 or 137y served as algal hosts. The mutant pRRX constructs (pRRX-D170H, pRRX-D170N, pRRX-D170T, pRRX-D170P) were used for all co-transformation experiments in which FuD7 was the algal host strain.Chloroplast Transformation and Identification of Homoplasmic C. reinhardtii Co-transformantsSpectinomycin-resistant colonies arising on selective medium after biolistic bombardment of algal host cells with the spectinomycin resistance marker (pCrBH4.8) and a mutant psbA construct were picked and screened by colony hybridization where appropriate (see below) or by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Eight independent spectinomycin-resistant colonies arising after co-transformation of wild-type hosts with pRR-D170T were tested, and two of these were heteroplasmic for the 240-bp BsrI fragment associated with the D170T mutation (Fig. 3A). All secondary colony isolates derived from these heteroplasmic transformant lines were homoplasmic with respect to this RFLP, as shown in Fig. 3B. Extended exposure of the blots revealed no evidence for mixed populations of fragments in any of the secondary isolates.When the psbA deletion mutant FuD7 was used as the algal host for co-transformation, spectinomycin-resistant transformant colonies were screened by colony hybridization. Subsequent Southern blot analysis of DNA isolated from secondary isolates of original colonies which showed positive hybridization signals (data not shown) confirmed the presence of two copies of psbA per chloroplast genome. We were unable to detect any FuD7 host DNA molecules in these transformants using a polymerase chain reaction DNA amplification assay with the sensitivity to detect one copy of the FuD7 chloroplast DNA molecule in 2000, (data not shown) providing further evidence that the mutant lines are homoplasmic.Table 1 summarizes some of the mutant and control algal transformant lines isolated, the algal strains which served as host, and the transforming DNAs used. Three of the mutant transformants (D170N, D170T, D170P) are obligate heterotrophs. The D170H transformant grows very slowly on minimal medium.To verify that the algal co-transformant lines contained the desired site-directed mutations, total RNA was isolated from transformant algal cells and used as a template for avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase in dideoxy DNA sequence reactions. All algal transformants showed the presence of the predicted mutations at codon 170 (Fig. 4), and no other differences were observed between the mutant and wild-type RNA templates. Finally, the mutant phenotype (poor or no growth on minimal medium) could be rescued by transformation of mutants with wild-type pXb1.8 DNA.Figure 4DNA sequence"

INTRODUCTIONA key step in the targeting of newly synthesized acid hydrolases to lysosomes is the recognition by the enzyme UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal enzyme N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphotransferase (abbreviated phosphotransferase) ( 1The abbreviations used are: phosphotransferaseN-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphotransferaseCD-MCD8membrane-anchored cathepsin DIGF-IIinsulin-like growth factor IIFITCfluorescein isothiocyanatemAbmonoclonal antibodyCPchimeric proteinPBSphosphate-buffered salineEndo Hendo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase HERendoplasmic reticulum.)of a protein determinant shared among at least 40 different lysosomal hydrolases(1.von Figura K. Hasilik A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 167-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 2.Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). This interaction results in the phosphorylation of mannose residues on the Asn-linked high mannose oligosaccharides of the lysosomal hydrolases. These phosphomannosyl residues serve as high affinity ligands for binding of the hydrolases to mannose 6-phosphate receptors present in the Golgi and their subsequent translocation to the lysosome (3.Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar).A molecular dissection of the phosphotransferase recognition marker on lysosomal hydrolases was undertaken in this laboratory using a pair of aspartyl proteases, the lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin D and the secretory protein pepsinogen, as sequence donors for chimeric proteins that were tested for their ability to act as phosphotransferase substrates(4.Baranski T.J. Faust P.L. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1990; 63: 281-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Even though cathepsin D and pepsinogen are 45% identical in amino acid sequence and have similar secondary and tertiary structures(5.Metcalf P. Fusek M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1293-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 6.Hartsuck J.A. Koelsch G. Remington S.J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1992; 13: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), they differ in that cathepsin D is well phosphorylated by phosphotransferase, whereas a glycosylated form of pepsinogen is not. These studies led to the identification of a phosphotransferase recognition patch in the carboxyl lobe of cathepsin D formed by two noncontinuous primary sequences (lysine 203 and amino acids 265-292). Although these residues were sufficient to confer recognition by phosphotransferase when substituted into homologous positions in pepsinogen, it was observed that the presence of multiple regions of the amino lobe of cathepsin D enhanced phosphorylation of the chimeric proteins. It was concluded that these elements may be part of an extended carboxyl lobe recognition domain or comprise a second independent recognition domain. It was also observed that although the presence of a phosphotransferase recognition domain located on either lobe of a cathepsin D/glycopepsinogen chimeric molecule is sufficient to allow phosphorylation of oligosaccharides on both lobes, the oligosaccharide on the lobe that contained the recognition domain was the preferred substrate(7.Baranski T.J. Cantor A.B. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23342-23348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Cantor A.B. Baranski T.J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23349-23356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The identification of specific sequences in the amino lobe of cathepsin D which contribute to phosphotransferase recognition was attempted by generating six chimeric proteins using two shared restriction sites in the 550-nucleotide amino lobe region to generate nine constructs(7.Baranski T.J. Cantor A.B. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23342-23348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chimeric proteins containing only a single cathepsin D amino lobe region were not well phosphorylated, but those with the pairwise combinations were phosphorylated to some degree. This suggested that multiple regions are required for generation of the recognition site or are required for proper folding.To characterize further the cathepsin D amino lobe elements that contribute to phosphorylation, we have taken an approach that redefines and extends the limits of the chimeric methodology applied in our original studies. Rather than making a small number of constructs manually and examining each individually, we sought to generate a large library of chimeric molecules and analyze the entire library by a phenotypic selection. Short segments of cathepsin D and pepsinogen encoded by oligonucleotide cassettes were shuffled together through a directed subcloning strategy that ensured high fidelity and representation. The library was expressed in COS cells, and chimeric proteins that folded correctly and were phosphorylated were selected and analyzed. This approach allowed the analysis of 2 orders of magnitude more constructs than had been screened in our prior studies over several years.Our experiments have defined two regions of the amino lobe of cathepsin D which contribute to proper folding and surface expression and two distinct regions that promote phosphorylation of the amino lobe oligosaccharide (CHO 70). Three models are proposed to account for these results.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines, Plasmids, and ReagentsCOS1 cells (9.Gluzman Y.

The cathepsin D and glycopepsinogen cDNAs were described previously(4.Baranski T.J. Faust P.L. Kornfeld S.

Recombinant endoglycosidase H fused to maltose-binding protein, recombinant peptide N-glycosidase F, and restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs and used in buffers supplied with the enzymes. T4 DNA ligase was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. and used in a standard ligation buffer (15.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1987Google Scholar). Human plasma fibronectin was obtained from the New York Blood Center.

Chromatography paper was obtained from Whatman. Dimethyl sulfoxide was obtained from Taylor Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Bovine mannose 6-phosphate/IGF-II receptor (Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor) was purified from fresh or frozen calf liver as described previously except that the receptor was eluted from the affinity column with 10 mM Man-6-P in 1% octyl β-D-glucopyranoside rather than in Triton X-100. Concanavalin A-Sepharose was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Fetal bovine serum and bovine calf serum were obtained from HyClone (Logan, UT). NuSerum was from Collaborative Research. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Phycoerythrin-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG was purchased from BioMeda (Foster City, CA). Other reagents were of the highest purity available and were purchased from Sigma or Fisher.OligonucleotidesOligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 380A solid-phase synthesizer and purified by ethanol precipitation. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used to generate the myc peptide linker, the new restriction sites in cathepsin D and glycopepsinogen, and the cassettes used to construct the chimeric library will be made available on request.Construction of Membrane-anchored Cathepsin D and Shuffle LibraryMembrane-anchored cathepsin D (CD-MCD8) was generated by ligating the SfiI-MaeI fragment containing nucleotides 990-1287 of cathepsin D, a preannealed oligonucleotide cassette corresponding to the myc peptide recognized by the 9E10 mAb (SMEQKLISEEDLN) with MaeI and DraIII cohesive ends, and a DraIII-NotI fragment containing nucleotides 466-1322 of the human CD8 cDNA into the 4-kilobase fragment of Bluescript containing human cathepsin D cDNA (HindIII to BglII/BamHI) that had been cut with SfiI and NotI. The products of the ligation were sequenced through the oligonucleotide cassette. The HindIII-NotI fragment of the CD-MCD8 was subcloned into HindIII-NotI-cut pCDM8 and tested for expression in COS cells (see below). Later the construct was subcloned into pAprM8 for routine COS cell expression. This construct contains the entire sequence of cathepsin D; the myc peptide; and the hinge, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains of CD8 (see Fig. 3A).Thirteen regions were selected which spanned from amino acids 37 to 186 of cathepsin D. The numbering conventions for the amino acid sequence of cathepsin D and glycopepsinogen are outlined in Fig. 1. XhoI and KpnI sites were engineered into the cDNA of cathepsin D and CP3 (which contains the amino lobe of glycopepsinogen up to the HincII site at nucleotide 931) by site-directed mutagenesis in the vector pGBT such that these restriction sites flanked the 5′ and 3′ boundaries of the 13 consecutive segments. The HindIII-XhoI regions of the cathepsin D and CP3 cDNAs were sequenced and used as a source of region 1 for subsequent steps. The 13 regions between the XhoI and KpnI sites were numbered regions 2-14 (Fig. 1). Oligonucleotide cassettes corresponding to regions 2-14 for cathepsin D and glycopepsinogen were synthesized to allow a three-step subcloning strategy outlined in Fig. 2. The oligonucleotides introduce SphI, SacI, BamHI, StyI, EcoRI, and SalI sites into the cathepsin D cDNA and allow complete assembly without altering the sequence of cathepsin D. The introduction of restriction sites SacI (Asp-63 to Glu), StyI (Gln-93 to Ser and Val-94 to Leu), and SalI (Ser-161 to Asp) and the requirement to otherwise maintain compatibility with the cathepsin D sequences in the junctions between regions 3 and 4 (Arg-58 to Lys, Phe-59 to Tyr), regions 7 and 8 (Ile-114 to Val), regions 8 and 9 (Ser-124 to Ile), and regions 13 and 14 (Ser-177 to Pro) resulted in introduction of the indicated changes to the glycopepsinogen sequence (Fig. 1).Figure 1Alignment of cathepsin D and glycopepsinogen amino lobes with junctions for shuffle mutagenesis. Numbering is for cathepsin D sequence with p1-p44 for the propiece and 1-191 from cathepsin D shown. Boxed residues are identical between cathepsin D and glycopepsinogen. The solid vertical bars represent restriction sites remaining in the completed chimeric molecules defining one class of junctions between regions. The dashed vertical/horizontal partitions represent a second class of junctions between regions based on annealing of overhangs between two oligonucleotide cassettes without leaving a unique restriction site. The circles indicate residues that were changed from the glycopepsinogen residue (shown) to another residue (as indicated under “Experimental Procedures”) to splice to the cathepsin D sequence. The solid underline starting at residue 70 marks the site of Asn-linked glycan addition to the amino lobe. The single underlined residues at p34 and 77 are implicated in phosphotransferase recognition as described under “Results.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 2Construction of shuffle library. The numbers at the bottom of the plasmids are the number of potential products after each ligation. In round 1 oligonucleotide cassettes were annealed and ligated into pSP64 as indicated. At this point each potential product was independently prepared and sequenced. The indicated restriction sites were then used to prepare fragments used in subsequent steps. The final shuffle library encoding membrane-anchored chimeric proteins was subcloned into the vector pAprM8. After selection, a subset of constructs was subcloned into a modified version of pCDM for expression as secreted protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The initial round of subcloning into SP64 cut with HindIII and EcoRI resulted in 30 possible ligation products corresponding to every combination of cathepsin D and glycopepsinogen segments for the 13 consecutive regions excluding the propieces. These were sequenced, and validated plasmid copies of each ligation product were prepared as purified plasmid and quantified by A260. In the second subcloning step the versions of each subregion corresponding to each possible cathepsin D/glycopepsinogen combination were mixed in equal ratio based on OD, and the pools were cut with the indicated restriction enzymes. The resulting fragments were then copurified and used in ligations as outlined in Fig. 2. The number of possible combinations at each step are indicated in Fig. 2. The number of colonies pooled at each step was sufficient to obtain greater than 95% of possible combinations(15.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1987Google Scholar).Nomenclature for New Chimeric ConstructsPreviously generated constructs are referred to by the original CP (chimeric protein) nomenclature(4.Baranski T.J. Faust P.L. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1990; 63: 281-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). New constructs generated by the synthetic gene approach can be described in two ways based on the binary logic intrinsic to this system. A base 2 numbering system can be used to describe each construct using 1 = cathepsin D and 0 = glycopepsinogen at each region. In this system a construct with cathepsin D regions 1, 5, 7, and 11 is 10001010001000; a construct with only cathepsin D regions 7 and 12 is 000000100001000. Abbreviated series numbers with the prefix S (shuffle) were generated by converting the base 2 representations above to base 10 such that the two constructs above become S8840 and S132, respectively; the construct with all cathepsin D regions is S16383, which is identical to CP55, whereas the construct with all glycopepsinogen regions is S0, which is CP3 with the changes outlined above. Thus each potential chimeric construct generated from the random cassette mutagenesis strategy has a unique designation. Unless otherwise indicated the constructs also contain glycopepsinogen amino acids 187-230 and cathepsin D amino acids 231-348 plus the myc peptide and a stop codon. The membrane-anchored versions are indicated with suffix MCD8 to indicate the myc peptide and CD8 hinge, transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail regions.COS Cell TransfectionsCOS1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% bovine calf serum by 1:2 dilution every 2-3 days. COS1 cells were transfected with DNA purified by alkaline lysis and polyethylene glycol precipitation using the DEAE-dextran method(13.Peterson A. Seed B. Nature. 1987; 329: 842-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). High DNA transfections were performed with 10 μg of DNA/2 ml of RPMI 1640, 10% NuSerum (Collaborative Research), 50 μg/ml gentamycin that was mixed with 2 ml of the same media containing 200 μg/ml DEAE-dextran and 200 μM choroquine for each 100-mm plate of 50% confluent COS1 cells. Low DNA transfections used 10 ng of plasmid DNA and 10 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA as a carrier with the same volumes and concentrations of other reagents. Twenty 100-mm plates were transfected for each selection. Selections were performed on 60-mm Petri plates coated with 9E10 mAb (2 ml of 10 μg/ml in PBS overnight at 24°C followed by 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin block in PBS and washing) or Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor-coated plates (2 ml of 5 μg/ml bovine liver Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor in 0.1% octyl glucoside detergent in PBS overnight at 24°C followed by 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin block in PBS and washing). Cells were split 1:1 24 h after transfection and used for selection at 48-72 h. The COS1 cells were released from the plates in Hanks' balanced salt solution, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, no Ca2+ or Mg2+, 5% fetal bovine serum, 0.5 mM EDTA. The cells were washed with the same media without EDTA, incubated on the selection plates (one 100-mm plate of COS cells/60-mm selection plate) in 2 ml of media for 60 min at 4°C. The plates were gently washed four times with PBS containing no added protein. Plasmid DNA from adherent cells was recovered by adding 0.4 ml of 1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA to the plate and transferring the lysate to a 1.5-ml tube on ice followed by the addition of 0.1 ml of 5 M NaCl(16.Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (3341) Google Scholar). The tube was gently mixed, left on ice overnight, and centrifuged at 40,000 × g. The supernatant was phenol extracted, ethanol precipitated with 10 μg of tRNA carrier, and used to transform Escherichia coli strain DH10 by electroporation; the cells were plated on selective agar. The colonies were enumerated, and DNA was purified directly from a slurry of the colonies or after several hours of culture in liquid LB medium to increase the number of cells. Size selection on products isolated after one round of high DNA transfections/selection and two rounds of low DNA transfections/selection was carried out by cutting the plasmids with HindIII, isolating the correct band in the 7-kilobase range by excision and adsorption to ceramic particles (GeneClean, Bio101), and then ligation at 1 ng/ml DNA with T4 DNA ligase.Labeling of Man-6-P/IGF-II Receptor with Fluorescein IsothiocyanateMan-6-P/IGF-II receptor micelles were prepared by a concentrating 500 μg of receptor in 1% octyl β-D-glucopyranoside to 50 μl in a Centricon 30 (Amicon, Danvers, MA), diluting it to 2 ml with cold PBS in the upper chamber of the Centricon unit, and concentrating it back to 50 μl. The dilution-concentration cycle was repeated twice more with PBS(17.Dustin M.L. Olive D. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The receptor concentration in the final concentrated sample of 50 μl was determined by Coomassie Blue dye binding(18.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar). The receptor was labeled with FITC at a ratio of 0.025 mg of FITC/mg of receptor for 1 h at room temperature in 0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 8.4. Labeled Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor was separated from free FITC on a Sephadex G-25 column. The FITC-Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor was stored at 500 μg/ml in PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin.Immunofluorescence Staining of COS CellsCOS1 cells transfected with 10 μg of plasmid DNA/100-mm plate were treated with trypsin and replated after 24 h and then removed from the plates with Hanks' balanced salt solution, 10 mM Hepes, 5% fetal bovine serum, 0.5 mM EDTA. Approximately 106 cells were stained with 2.5 μg of FITC-Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor and 50 ng of 9E10 mAb in 50 μl of the same buffer. After 1 h at 4°C, the cells were washed, and 2.5 μg of phycoerythrin-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG was incubated with the cells for 30 min at 4°C. The cells were washed again and analyzed on a FACSCAN (Becton Dickinson) using a Consort 30 analysis package within 12 h.Labeling of COS CellsCOS1 cells transfected with 20 μg of DNA for two 100-mm dishes were replated at 24 h onto a single 100-mm dish coated with 25 μg/ml human serum fibronectin. At 48 h the cell layers were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without glucose. The washed COS cells were incubated with 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10 mM Hepes, 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.5 mMD-glucose, 400 μCi of [2-3H]mannose for 4 h at 37°C at which point additional glucose was added to 5 mM, effectively stopping mannose uptake into the cells. The media were harvested after an additional 12-16 h and were dialyzed against 25 mM Tris•HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% NaN3 to remove free [2-3H]mannose. When cellular material was collected the cell layer was washed twice with imidazole-buffered saline and lysed in imidazole-buffered saline, pH 7.0, plus 1% Triton X-100, 50 trypsin inhibitory unit/ml aprotinin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mM iodoacetamide, and 0.5 mM EDTA at 4°C. After 30 min the lysate was collected and centrifuged at 13,000 × g in a microcentrifuge for 15 min.Immunoprecipitation and Oligosaccharide AnalysisLysates or dialyzed cell media samples were immunoprecipitated with 15 μl of 9E10 antibody coupled to CNBr-activated 4% beaded agarose. After rotating the antibody beads with the lysate or media sample, the beads were washed five times with 100 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mM EDTA, 10 trypsin inhibitory unit/ml, aprotinin and once with 10 mM Tris, pH 6.8. The immunoprecipititated protein was eluted from the beads in 50 μl of 0.5% SDS, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol by heating to ≥ 80°C for 10 min and rinsing the beads with 50 μl of water. Oligosaccharide analysis was carried out by a modification of standard methods(8.Cantor A.B. Baranski T.J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23349-23356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Varki A. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2808-2818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The eluted proteins were treated with 10 milliunits of Endo H overnight at 37°C. The released high mannose oligosaccharides, which include the phosphorylated molecules, were recovered in the flow through of a Centricon 30. The retentate was then treated with 10 mg/ml Pronase or 10 milliunits/ml N-glycanase to generate glycopeptides or oligosaccharides, respectively, for analysis of complex-type oligosaccharides using concanavalin A-Sepharose and to determine the proportion of high mannose oligosaccharides released with Endo H. The Endo H-released oligosaccharides were treated with 20 mM HCl at 100°C for 30 min to remove any GlcNAc residues still linked to phosphates and sialic acid from hybrid oligosaccharides. The samples were then analyzed by QAE-Sephadex chromatography to determine the degree of phosphorylation(19.Varki A. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2808-2818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were loaded onto a column of QAE-Sephadex in 2 mM Tris with ≤ 5 mM total salts and buffers, and the flow through containing neutral high mannose oligosaccharides was collected; the eluate with 70 mM NaCl contained high mannose oligosaccharides with one phosphate and the eluate with 140 mM NaCl contained high mannose oligosaccharides with two phosphates.The Endo H-resistant material that had been treated with Pronase or N-glycanase was loaded onto concanavalin A-Sepharose in Tris/CaCl2 buffer, and three fractions were collected: the flow-through containing tri- and tetraantennary complex oligosaccharides, the 10 mM α-methylglucoside eluate containing biantennary complex oligosaccharides, and the 100 mM α-methyl mannoside eluate containing Endo H-resistant high mannose oligosaccharides. In some experiments the level of phosphorylation of the Endo H-resistant, N-glycanase released high mannose oligosaccharides eluted from concanavalin A-Sepharose with 100 mM α-methylmannoside was determined. This material was found to be significantly underphosphorylated compared with the Endo H-released material. Therefore, no attempt was made to systematically compensate for Endo H-resistant high mannose oligosaccharides in estimating phosphorylation.The percent phosphorylation was calculated as cpm recovered in Endo H-released oligosaccharides with one or two phosphates ÷ total cpm in Endo H-released oligosaccharides (phosphorylated plus neutral) + 2 (Endo H-resistant complex oligosaccharides). The values for the complex oligosaccharides were multiplied by 2 to correct for the fact that they contain 3 mannose residues versus an average of 6 mannose residues per high mannose oligosaccharide. The ratio of oligosaccharides with two and one phosphate was determined directly from the QAE-Sephadex chromatography data.In Vitro Phosphotransferase AssaysUDP-[α-32P]GlcNAc was prepared as described previously(20.Reitman M.L. Lang L. Kornfeld S. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Partially purified rat liver phosphotransferase was prepared by sucrose gradient enrichment of Golgi membranes followed by removal of endogenous acceptors by low detergent extraction in the presence of 10 mM Man-6-P, detergent solubilization, and DEAE-cellulose chromatography(20.Reitman M.L. Lang L. Kornfeld S. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Typically, assays were performed in 10-μl reactions containing 2 mM ATP, 0.5-2.0 μg of acceptor, 5.0 units of phosphotransferase (25,000 units/mg), and 5 × 106 cpm of UDP-[α-32P]GlcNAc at 5,000 cpm/pmol. After 2 h at 37°C, the reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, and the samples were analyzed on a 10% reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and destained extensively prior to autoradiography to remove free radioactivity. The Coomassie Blue-stained gels and autoradiographs were analyzed by a laser densitometer (Molecular Dynamics) to determine the amount of protein in the appropriate size bands and the amount of 32P transferred. The autoradiography results were confirmed by direct counting of bands cut from the gel.RESULTSConstruction and Testing of a Membrane-anchored “Selection” Vector for Aspartyl ProteasesA membrane-anchored form of cathepsin D was generated to a"

https://openalex.org/W2047153162,"A new combinatorial approach that includes the genetic variation of protein structure and the chemical modification of phospholipid structure in polymerized mixed liposomes was used to delineate the structure-function relationships in the interfacial catalysis of bovine pancreatic phospholipase A2 (PLA2). Based on previous structural and mutational studies, several bovine PLA2 mutants were generated in which a positive charge of putatively important lysyl side chains was reversed (K10E, K53E, K56E, and K116E) or neutralized (K56Q and K116Q). Kinetic parameters of bovine wild type and mutant PLA2s determined using polymerized mixed liposomes consisting of 1-hexadecanoyl-2-(1-pyrenedecanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (or -phosphoglycerol) and 1,2-bis[12-(lipoyloxy)dodecanoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol showed that Lys-53 is involved specifically in the interaction with a substrate bound in the active site. Also, these results showed that Lys-10 and Lys-116 are involved in the interaction of bovine PLA2 with anionic interfaces but not in the interaction with the active site-bound substrate. In particular, Lys-116 makes more significant contribution than Lys-10 by ∽1.0 kcal/mol to the binding to anionic interfaces.

In general, the PLA2-catalyzed reaction is described as a two-step process, the initial binding to the membrane surface (interfacial binding) and subsequent catalytic steps (Jain and Berg, 1989). Also, it has been generally believed that PLA2 has an interfacial binding site separated from the active site (for a recent review, see Scott and Sigler(1994)). Recent structural analyses of PLA2-inhibitor complexes for some secretory PLA2s have revealed the interactions of a phospholipid molecule with active site residues of enzyme (Scott et al., 1990a, 1990b, 1991; Thunnison et al., 1990; White et al., 1990). However, the structural basis for the interfacial binding and the identity of protein residues involved in this process are relatively poorly understood due to difficulties inherent in determining the structure of membrane-bound proteins. Recent structure-function studies on bovine and porcine pancreatic PLA2s by site-directed mutagenesis have provided valuable information about the role of individual protein residues in the function of these enzymes (Dupureur et al., 1992a, 1992b; Kuipers, et al., 1989a, 1989b, 1990; Lugtigheid et al., 1993a, 1993b; Noel et al., 1990, 1991; Van den Berg et al., 1988). In many cases, however, an intimate interplay between the interfacial binding step and catalytic steps in the PLA2 catalysis made it difficult to clearly delineate structure-function relationships from kinetic analyses using conventional PLA2 substrates. Recently, we have developed a novel kinetic system using polymerized mixed liposomes that allows an unambiguous distinction between phospholipids interacting with the active site of PLA2 and ones interacting with the interfacial binding site of PLA2 (Wu and Cho, 1993, 1994). In this report, we present kinetic and binding studies of bovine pancreatic PLA2 and its selected mutant proteins using polymerized mixed liposomes. These studies unambiguously identify protein residues that are involved in the interfacial binding and the substrate binding in the active site and evaluate their relative contributions to individual processes. phospholipase A2 1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine 1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol 1-hexadecanoyl-2-(1-pyrenedecanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol 1-hexadecanoyl-2-(1-pyrenedecanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol 1,2-bis[12-(lipoyloxy)dodecanoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine 1,2-bis[12-(lipoyloxy)dodecanoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone phosphatidylglycerol phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylcholine. 1,2-Dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (diC6PE) and -phosphoglycerol (diC6PG), 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (diC8PG) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. 1-Hexadecanoyl-2-(1-pyrenedecanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (pyrene-PE), and -glycerol (pyrene-PG) were from Molecular Probes. 1,2-Bis[12-(lipoyloxy)-dodecanoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (BLPC) and -glycerol (BLPG) were prepared as described previously (Wu and Cho, 1993). Large unilamellar liposomes were prepared by multiple extrusion through 0.1-μm polycarbonate filter (Millipore) in a microextruder Liposofast (Avestin, Ottawa, Ontario) (MacDonald et al., 1991). Phospholipid concentrations were determined by phosphate analysis (Kates et al., 1986). Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin was from Miles Inc. 5,5′-Dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and sodium sulfite were obtained from Aldrich. 2-Nitro-5-(sulfothio)-benzoate was synthesized from 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) according to the procedure of Thannhauser et al.(1984). Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, TPCK-treated trypsin, and oxidized and reduced glutathione were purchased from Sigma. Urea was from Fisher. All of the restriction enzymes, T4 ligase, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. An expression vector for bovine pancreatic PLA2 (pTO-propla2) (Deng et al., 1990) was kindly provided by Dr. Ming-Daw Tsai. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Midland Co. (Midland, TX). The site-directed mutagenesis of bovine pancreatic PLA2 was performed using the M13mp18 vector containing bovine PLA2 gene according to the method of Nakamaye and Eckstein(1986) using an in vitro mutagenesis kit from Amersham Corp. The oligonucleotides used for the construction of mutant proteins were 5′-ATCTTACATTCGATCATTC-3′ (K10E), 5′-TTAGCTTGTTCATAGCAAT-3′ (K53E), 5′-ATCAAGTTTTTCAGCTTGTT-3′ (K56E), 5′-ATCAAGTTTCTGAGCTTGTT-3′ (K56Q), 5′-TATCAAGATTTTCGTGTTCTT-3′ (K116E), 5′-TCAAGATTCTGGTGTTCTT 3′ (K116Q), respectively, in which underlined bases indicate the location of mutation. After DNA sequences of mutants were verified by the sequencing analysis (Sanger et al., 1977) using a Sequenase 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), individual recombinant PLA2 genes were digested with EcoRI and BamHI and inserted into pTO-propla2 vector. Wild-type and recombinant proteins were expressed and purified as described by Noel et al.(1991) with some modifications. An Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) was used as a host for the protein expression. Typically, cultures were grown in 3 × 1 liter of Luria broth containing chloramphenicol (0.02 mg/ml) and ampicillin (0.25 mg/ml). When the absorbance of media at 600 nm reached 0.8, additional ampicillin was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, and the protein expression induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. After 5 h, cells were harvested, and the bacterial pellet was suspended in 60 ml of 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0 containing 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100. Sonication using a Sonifier 450 (Branson) was performed at 300 watts by a pulse mode for 6 × 1 min, and the solution was allowed to stir for 30 min at room temperature. The inclusion body pellet was obtained by centrifugation for 15 min at 10,000 × g at 4°C. The pellet was solubilized in 6 ml of 8 M urea solution containing 0.3 M sodium sulfite, pH 8.0, and stirred vigorously at room temperature for 30 min. Two ml of 2-nitro-5-(sulfothio)-benzoate solution (25 mM) was then added, and the modification was monitored spectrophotometrically at 412 nm. After the modification was complete (∽10 min), the mixture was further stirred for 30 min and eventually centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The supernatant was applied to a Sephadex G-25 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column (2.5 × 20 cm) equilibrated in 25 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 5 M urea and 5 mM EDTA, and the protein peak was collected and dialyzed against water and then against 0.3% (v/v) acetic acid to precipitate the sulfonated protein. The precipitated protein was washed with 120 ml of water and resuspended in 30 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 5 mM EDTA and 8 M urea. The solution was slowly diluted to 120 ml by the addition of 90 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 8 mM reduced glutathione, 4 mM oxidized glutathione, and 5 mM EDTA, kept at room temperature for 20 h, dialyzed against 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, and eventually lyophilized. The protein was then dissolved in 5 ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to remove all insoluble proteins. TPCK-treated trypsin was then added to a final concentration of 0.2% (w/w), and the solution was stirred at room temperature. The PLA2 activity, monitored using pyrene-PG/BLPG polymerized mixed liposomes as a substrate (Wu and Cho, 1994), typically reached a maximum after 2 h. Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride was then added to a final concentration of 0.1 mM, and the solution was dialyzed against 10 mM ammonium acetate, pH 5.0. The solution was filtered through 0.2-μm filters and applied to a Mono S column (Pharmacia) attached to a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Pharmacia). The column was equilibrated in 10 mM ammonium acetate, pH 5.0, and eluted with a linear gradient of increasing NaCl concentration from 0 to 0.5 M in the same buffer. Typically, PLA2 was eluted as a single peak with 0.08-0.1 M of NaCl. The PLA2 peak was collected, dialyzed against water, and lyophilized. The lyophilized protein was stored at −20°C. Purity of protein was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing using a Phast system (Pharmacia). Protein concentrations were determined by the Micro BCA method (Smith et al., 1985) (Pierce). Circular dichroism (CD) spectra of proteins were measured at room temperature using a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter. Each spectrum was obtained from 10 scans between 195 and 250 nm. All of the kinetic experiments were performed at 37°C and at pH 7.4. Kinetics of PLA2-catalyzed hydrolysis of polymerized mixed liposomes were performed according to the procedure previously described (Wu and Cho, 1993). Typically, the hydrolysis was performed in 1 ml of 10 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 μM pyrene-containing phospholipid inserted in 9.5 μM BLPG, 10 μM bovine serum albumin, 0.16 M NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 10 mM CaCl2. Detailed descriptions of the experimental basis for selecting this kinetic condition were reported elsewhere (Wu and Cho, 1994). Phospholipid concentration in the range of 10-50 μM (in total concentration) did not affect the rate constants. The progress of hydrolysis was monitored as an increase in fluorescence emission at 380 nm (F380) using a Hitachi F4500 fluorescence spectrometer with the excitation wavelength set at 345 nm. Spectral bandwidth was set at 5 nm for both excitation and emission. In order to obtain kinetically meaningful rate constants for the comparison of enzymatic activities while avoiding complicated kinetic analyses, we employed the simplest possible kinetic model that is consistent with the observed kinetic patterns. Under the above experimental conditions, the hydrolysis of pyrene-containing phospholipid/BLPG polymerized mixed liposomes by bovine PLA2 and most of mutants followed the first-order kinetics (Fig. 1). Thus, we treated enzymatic reactions as a simple bimolecular process as shown in Equation 1,E+S(ℜcat/Km)→E+P1+P2(Eq. 1) where E, S, P1 and P2, and (kcat/Km)app represent free enzyme, phospholipid, fatty acid, lysophospholipid, and apparent specificity constant, respectively. Accordingly, the entire course of reaction was analyzed using a simple integrated first-order rate equation; i.e. [P] = So•(1 - e−k⋅t) where k is a pseudo first-order rate constant ((kcat/Km)app•Eo) and Eo and So represent total enzyme and substrate concentration, respectively. Pseudo first-order rate constants were directly proportional to enzyme concentrations within the range of enzyme concentration used (5-50 nM); (kcat/Km)app was calculated by dividing the pseudo first-order rate constant by enzyme concentration. According to the model shown in, (kcat/Km)app should contain information about the interfacial binding as well as catalytic steps. As shown in Fig. 1, the hydrolysis of polymerized mixed liposomes by slower PLA2 mutants, most notably K56E(Q) and K116E(Q), gradually deviated from the first-order kinetics with the progress of reaction. To obtain rate constants for these mutants that can be compared with those of bovine wild-type and mutant PLA2s, we measured the initial velocity of reaction. Assuming that all of the reactions at an early stage follow the scheme shown in, (kcat/Km)app can be calculated from the pseudo first-order rate constant ((kcat/Km)app•Eo) determined from the initial velocity measurement according to Equation 2,(ℜcat/Km)app=(1/Eo)×(ΔF/Δt)o×(1/ΔFmax)(Eq. 2) where (ΔF/Δt)o and ΔFmax indicate initial velocity described in terms of fluorescence change at 380 nm and the maximal fluorescence change expected from the complete hydrolysis of pyrene-phospholipid, respectively. ΔFmax was determined by the addition of an excess amount of bovine PLA2 to the reaction mixture for a given concentration of phospholipid. Typically, the initial velocity was determined from the fluorescence change in first 2 min, which generally was high enough to allow accurate rate determinations. Within the enzyme concentration range used for K56E(Q) and K116E(Q) (10-100 nM), the initial velocity was linearly proportional to the enzyme concentration and, accordingly, (kcat/Km)app values were independent of enzyme concentration. For bovine wild-type PLA2 and faster mutants including K53E and K10E, the analysis of entire progress curve and the initial velocity measurement yielded essentially the same (kcat/Km)app values, which further supported the validity of the latter method (data not shown). Kinetics of PLA2-catalyzed hydrolysis of diC6PE and diC6PG monomers were performed with 0.5 mM phospholipid, 0.16 M NaCl, and 10 mM CaCl2. The hydrolysis of mixed micelles was measured in the presence of 2 mM Triton X-100, 1 mM sodium deoxycholate, 0.5 mM diC8PG, and 10 mM CaCl2 as described previously (Dua and Cho, 1994). Time courses of the hydrolysis of phospholipids were monitored with a computer-controlled Metrom pH-stat (Brinkmann Instruments, Inc.) in a thermostated vessel. The completion of hydrolysis was confirmed by the addition of an additional amount of enzyme to the mixture after the reaction. Under these condition, the hydrolysis of phospholipids followed first-order kinetics. Thus, (kcat/Km)app values were calculated by dividing the pseudo first-order rate constant by enzyme concentration. The binding of PLA2 to polymerized liposomes was measured fluorometrically as described previously (Wu and Cho, 1994). Typically, the same concentration of protein (2 μM) was added to a solution containing 0.1-100 μM BLPG, and the fluorescence intensity of protein at 345 nm (F345) was measured after it reached an equilibrium value. Excitation wavelength was set at 280 nm. To enhance relatively weak fluorescence signal of bovine PLA2s, a maximal spectral bandwidth (20 nm) was used for both excitation and emission. Then, the relative fluorescence change (Fre1) for each phospholipid concentration was calculated as (Fmax - F345)/(Fmax - Fmin) where Fmax and Fmin represent the protein fluorescence at 345 nm in the absence of BLPG and in the presence of an excess amount of BLPG, respectively. The Fre1 values were plotted as a function of total BLPG concentration. Assuming each phospholipid molecule as a ligand that binds independently with apparent dissociation constant Kd to n equivalent sites on a PLA2 molecule, values of both n and Kd were determined by the nonlinear least-squares analysis of the Fre1versus [PL]o data using equation (3),Frel=[E]o+Kd+[PL]o/n-([E]o+Kd+[PL]o/n)2-4⋅[E]o[PL]o/n2⋅[E]o(Eq. 3) where [E]o and [PL]0 represent total enzyme and total phospholipid concentrations, respectively. We designed two groups of bovine pancreatic PLA2 mutants based on previous structural and mutational analyses of pancreatic enzymes, substrate binding site (in the active site) mutants, and interfacial binding site mutants. Lugtigheid et al. (1993a, 1993b) showed that Arg-53 of porcine PLA2 (Lys-53 for bovine PLA2) is involved in the head-group specificity of the active site. Also, Noel et al.(1991) reported that Lys-56 is involved in the head-group specificity. We therefore generated substrate binding site mutants by reversing (or removing) the positive charge of these lysine side chains; i.e. K53E, K56E, and K56Q. Independently, we have shown (Wu and Cho, 1993; Dua and Cho, 1994; Shen et al., 1994) that cationic residues in the amino-terminal α-helix of PLA2 are involved in its interaction with anionic interfaces. Based on this information and previous structural (Dijkstra et al., 1981) and chemical modification studies (Van der Wiele et al., 1988a, 1988b), we selected Lys-10 and Lys-116 for the generation of interfacial-binding site mutants; i.e. K10E, K116E, and K116Q. SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis of mutant proteins showed that they all have an expected molecular mass of 14 kDa (data not shown). To rule out a possibility that mutations caused a gross structural change of protein, we measured the CD spectra of wild-type and mutant proteins. As shown in Fig. 2, all the proteins showed essentially the same spectra, indicating the absence of any major structural change due to mutation. Also, all of the mutants were expressed with comparable efficiencies, which implies that they have similar thermal stability. Lastly, the lack of any deleterious structural change was confirmed by comparable or higher activity of all the mutants toward a monomeric substrate, diC6PE (see Table 1).Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab We measured the activity of wild-type and the above mutants toward two different types of polymerized mixed liposomes; pyrene-PE/BLPG and pyrene-PG/BLPG. BLPC-based polymerized mixed liposomes were not used in these studies due to low activity of bovine PLA2 toward these liposomes (Wu and Cho, 1994). We previously showed (Wu and Cho, 1993) that PLA2 selectively hydrolyzed pyrene-containing phospholipids inserted in BLPG polymerized liposomes and that the relative activity of individual enzyme species toward different pyrene-containing phospholipids in these polymerized mixed liposomes reflected their genuine head-group preference. Values of (kcat/Km)app for all of the enzymes are summarized in Table 1. Based on the finding that bovine enzymes slightly favor as a substrate pyrene-PE over pyrene-PC, 2R. Dua and W. Cho, unpublished observations.we mainly used pyrene-PE as a zwitterionic substrate. Accordingly, we describe the preference of the wild-type and mutants for anionic phospholipids in terms of the ratio of their activity toward pyrene-PG to that toward pyrene-PE, which will be referred to as PG preference hereafter. If a lysine residue is involved in the substrate binding in the active site, one would expect that its mutation will affect the PG preference of enzyme. If, on the other hand, the lysine residue is involved only in the interfacial binding, its mutation will not change the PG preference but will lower the activity toward all the anionic BLPG based polymerized mixed liposomes. As reported previously (Wu and Cho, 1994), bovine PLA2 greatly (∽15-fold) preferred anionic pyrene-PG to zwitterionic pyrene-PE inserted in BLPG polymerized mixed liposomes. This high PG-preference has been ascribed to the presence of cationic protein residues, most notably Lys-53 and Lys-56, in the active site. Indeed, both the K53E and K56E mutations greatly reduced the preference for the anionic substrate: K53E and K56E favored PG only by 2-3-fold (Table 1). Despite the similar low PG-preference of these two mutants, however, a dramatic difference was found in their catalytic activity toward any BLPG based polymerized mixed liposomes. Toward pyrene-PG/BLPG polymerized mixed liposomes, for instance, K53E was slightly less active than the wild-type enzyme, whereas K56E showed only 0.7% of the wild-type activity. The low activity of K56E was not due to the deactivation of enzyme by mutation, as this mutant was ∽1.5-fold more active than the wild-type enzyme toward a monomeric substrate, diC6PE (Table 1), and retained 50% of wild-type activity toward another monomeric substrate, diC6PG (Table 2). These results indicate that both Lys-53 and Lys-56 are involved in the substrate binding in the active site and, more importantly, that Lys-56 is also involved in the interfacial binding. This notion is further supported by kinetic properties of K56Q in which the positive charge of lysyl side chain is neutralized rather than being reversed; it showed not only higher activity than K56E toward pyrene-PE/BLPG polymerized mixed liposomes but also exhibited higher PG-preference.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab As expected from their putative role in the binding to anionic interfaces, the mutation of Lys-10 and Lys-116 significantly reduced the activity of enzyme toward anionic BLPG based polymerized mixed liposomes. Toward pyrene-PG/BLPG polymerized mixed liposomes, K10E and K116E showed 20 and 3% of the wild-type activity (Table 2). Again, the low activity of these mutant proteins was not due to the deactivation of enzyme by mutation as they were only slightly less active than the wild-type enzyme toward monomeric substrates, diC6PE and diC6PG (Table 1 and Table 2). The different degree of rate decrease can be accounted for in terms of the different accessibility of these two lysyl side chains. The crystallographic structure of bovine PLA2 shows that Lys-116 is fully exposed, but that Lys-10, although located in the same side of protein molecule, is relatively buried among hydrophobic residues in the amino-terminal α-helix (Dijkstra et al., 1978, 1981). Furthermore, both K10E and K116E showed the same high PG-preference as the wild-type enzyme. Lastly, K116Q, which was slightly more active toward pyrene-PE/BLPG polymerized mixed liposomes than K116E, showed essentially the same PG preference. Taken together, these results indicate that Lys-10 and Lys-116 are involved only in the interfacial binding and that their mutations do not interfere with the binding of an anionic substrate with the active site. In order to test if altered kinetic behaviors of bovine PLA2 mutants toward BLPG based polymerized mixed liposomes were specifically due to the change in their interfacial binding and/or substrate binding, we measured their binding to BLPG polymerized liposomes. We previously showed that one could directly measure the dissociation constant for a PLA2-liposome complex fluorometrically using polymerized liposomes, which greatly simplifies the interpretation of kinetic data measured using polymerized mixed liposomes (Wu and Cho, 1994). The binding isotherms of bovine PLA2 and mutants to BLPG polymerized liposomes are shown in Fig. 3, and thermodynamic parameters determined from the data analysis are summarized in Table 1. The binding isotherms for all the bovine PLA2s showed an identical hyperbolic pattern, indicating a lack of any unusual binding mode for a specific mutant. Also, bovine PLA2 and all of the mutants except K56E have essentially the same n values (∽30). For K56E, which showed the lowest binding affinity toward BLPG polymerized liposomes, the dissociation constant was calculated assuming n = 30. As shown in Table 2, the relative binding affinity of bovine mutant PLA2s for BLPG polymerized liposomes, expressed as a ratio of reciprocal of dissociation constant, is in good agreement with their relative kinetic activity toward pyrene-PG/BLPG polymerized mixed liposomes. For instance, K53E showed only a slight decrease in binding affinity, whereas all of the interfacial binding site mutants exhibited a large degree of decrease. Thus, reduced activity of these interfacial binding site mutants toward BLPG-based polymerized mixed liposomes is mainly due to the decrease in their interfacial binding. In particular, Lys-56, the mutation of which reduced the binding affinity to less than 1% of wild-type binding affinity, appears to be the most critical residue in the interfacial binding of bovine pancreatic PLA2. Lastly, we measured the activity of bovine wild-type and mutant PLA2s toward diC6PE and diC6PG at the concentration below their critical micellar concentration (∽7 mM) (Wells, 1974). Although the premicellar aggregation of short-chain phospholipids with some snake venom PLA2s has been reported (Yuan et al., 1990), it is generally thought that the pancreatic PLA2-catalyzed hydrolysis of these substrates below critical micellar concentration does not involve the interfacial binding and that the substrate specificity determined using these substrates reflects the genuine head group specificity of the active site. As summarized in Table 1, the PG-preference determined using monomeric substrates agreed relatively well with that determined using BLPG-based polymerized mixed liposomes. In particular, the interfacial binding site mutants, including K10E, K116E, and K116Q, showed no significant change in activity toward diC6PE and diC6PG. By contrast, the activity of K53E and K56E increased 7- and 1.5-fold toward diC6PE (Table 1), respectively, and decreased ∽2-fold toward diC6PG (Table 2), again indicating their involvement in the substrate binding. In the previous structure-function studies of pancreatic PLA2s by site-directed mutagenesis, the activity of mutant proteins was measured using short chain phospholipids either as a monomer or as in micelles. Although these studies provided important insights into structure-function relationships in the actions of PLA2, they could not readily distinguish the effect of mutation on the interfacial binding from that on the substrate binding in the active site. For instance, Noel et al.(1991) and Lugtigheid et al. (1993a, 1993b) showed that cationic residues at the positions 53 and 56 of pancreatic PLA2s are involved in their head group specificity but failed to reveal the participation of Lys-56 in the interfacial binding. In this report, we studied the properties of a large number of bovine pancreatic PLA2 mutants, including ones previously characterized. As described under “Results,” kinetic studies of these mutant proteins using polymerized mixed liposomes and binding studies using polymerized liposomes unambiguously identify key residues involved in the interfacial binding of bovine pancreatic PLA2 and evaluate their relative contributions. Although we did not determine the tertiary structure of any mutant proteins described herein, their identical CD spectra and comparable activity toward diC6PE and/or diC6PG preclude a possibility that altered activity of mutants toward polymerized mixed liposomes might result from any deleterious structural changes. Our kinetic data for K53E mutant are consistent with those reported for R53E of the porcine enzyme (Lugtigheid et al., 1993a), i.e., a large increase in activity toward zwitterionic substrate and a slight decrease toward anionic substrate. This agreement indicates that Lys-53 of the bovine enzyme and Arg-53 of the porcine enzyme play the same role of interacting with ethanolamine or glycerol head group rather than with the phosphate anion. In addition, these data rule out a possibility that Lys-53 of the bovine enzyme is involved in interfacial binding. In an early x-ray crystallographic analysis of bovine pancreatic PLA2, Dijkstra et al.(1981) proposed that a face of this protein molecule that is directed toward the interface is composed of three sets of residues; one includes the amino-terminal α-helix and other two include Lys-56 and Lys-116, respectively. By means of chemical modification studies, Van der Wiele et al. (1988a, 1988b) suggested that Lys-10 and Lys-116 of pancreatic PLA2s are involved in the interfacial binding. Our kinetic and binding studies show that these lysines indeed participate in the interfacial binding but that their relative contributions are quite different. Toward pyrene-PG/BLPG polymerized mixed liposomes, the K10E mutation results in a 5-fold rate decrease, whereas the K116E mutation leads to a 30-fold decrease. Also, this rate decrease is in excellent agreement with the decrease in binding affinity for BLPG polymerized liposomes. The decreases in Kd can be approximately translated into a loss in interfacial electrostatic interactions by 1.0 and 2.0 kcal/mol, respectively, at room temperature using an equation, ΔΔG = -RT ln[Kd for mutant/Kd for wild-type], where R and T indicate gas constant and temperature, respectively. These estimated values, which compare well with the known value for electrostatic interactions between two oppositely-charged residues in proteins (1-3 kcal/mol) (Barlow and Thornton, 1983), indicate that Lys-116 makes more significant contributions to the interactions with anionic interfaces than Lys-10 by ∽1.0 kcal/mol. Most importantly, both kinetic and binding data show that Lys-56 makes larger contributions to the interfacial binding than any other residue studied, especially when the bovine enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of anionic interfaces. Toward pyrene-PG/BLPG polymerized mixed liposomes, for instance, the K56E mutation results in a 150-fold rate decrease, whereas the K116E mutation leads to a 30-fold decrease (Table 2). Previously, the K56E mutant of bovine PLA2 (Noel et al., 1991) and the K56Q mutant of porcine PLA2 (Lugtigheid et al., 1993b) were reported to have ∽25 and 67% of the wild-type Vmax value (or kcat value), respectively, toward micelles of short chain phosphatidyl glycerols. These values are much higher than 0.7 and 4% of residual activity observed for K56E and K56Q mutants of the bovine PLA2 toward pyrene-PG/BLPG polymerized mixed liposomes. The difference might arise from different physical shapes of micelles and liposomes. Presumably, the binding of the bovine PLA2 to loosely packed micellar surface might not require strong electrostatic interactions and, consequently, the decrease in electrostatic interactions by the K56E mutation does not cause drastic effects on the enzymatic activity. By contrast, the same mutation exerts dramatic effects on the enzyme activity toward polymerized mixed liposomes because the binding of the bovine PLA2 to densely-packed large liposome surface depends greatly on electrostatic interactions. To evaluate the effects of mutations on the enzyme activity under a physiologically relevant condition, we measured the activity of bovine wild-type and mutant PLA2s using Triton X-100/sodium deoxycholate/diC8PG mixed micelles (4:2:1 in mole ratio), the structure of which is relatively similar to that of physiological substrates for pancreatic PLA2s, i.e. phospholipids emulsified with bile salts. As summarized in Table 3, the rate decrease for interfacial binding site mutants is, in general, less significant than observed with pyrene-PG/BLPG polymerized mixed liposomes but is much bigger than observed with phosphatidyl glycerol micelles. In particular, the K56E mutant shows only 4% of wild-type activity. Implications from these results are 2-fold. First, Lys-56 is indeed a critical residue in the interfacial catalysis of bovine pancreatic enzyme toward anionic substrates under the physiological condition. Second, our polymerized mixed liposome system serves as a highly sensitive probe to identify essential interfacial binding site groups, which has been difficult with conventional micellar substrates.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The critical involvement of Lys-56 in the interfacial binding of bovine PLA2 is further supported by two independent studies. First, Tomasselli et al.(1989) showed that Lys-56 was selectively acylated by artificial PLA2 substrate, 4-nitro-3octanoyloxybenzoic acid (Cho et al., 1988a; Cho and Kezdy, 1991). Earlier, we reported (Cho et al., 1988b) that Lys-7 and Lys-10 of PLA2 from the venom of Agkistrodon piscivorus piscivorus were selectively acylated by 4-nitro-3-octanoyloxybenzoic acid. We recently showed (Shen et al., 1994) that these two lysines are involved in the binding of the PLA2 to anionic interfaces and that their selective acylation is due to their proximity to a reactive ester moiety of 4-nitro-3-octanoyloxybenzoic acid, which forms an anionic aggregate. Likewise, one can reason that Lys-56 of pancreatic enzymes is selectively acylated by 4-nitro-3-octanoyloxybenzoic acid because of its critical involvement in the binding to anionic interfaces. Second, Scott et al.(1994) recently reported the electrostatic potentials calculated for a number of secretory PLA2s with known tertiary structure. Among these secretory PLA2, bovine pancreatic PLA2 showed unique electrostatic potential distribution with high positive potentials around Lys-56. Lys-56 is located in a loop (residues 55-67), which is unique to class I PLA2, particularly mammalian pancreatic enzymes (Scott and Sigler, 1994). Thus, the critical involvement of Lys-56 in the interfacial binding of pancreatic PLA2s implies that these enzymes might have an interfacial binding mode distinct from that of other types of secretory PLA2s. In summary, polymerized mixed liposomes and polymerized liposome provide useful kinetic and thermodynamic systems that allow a systematic structure-function analysis of PLA2. Studies described herein unambiguously show that Lys-56 of bovine pancreatic PLA2 is involved in both the interfacial binding and the substrate binding and that its Lys-116 is an essential residue for the interfacial binding. Also, these studies reassess individual roles of Lys-10 and Lys-53. Although not included in this report, the structure-function study for PLA2 showing considerable activity toward PC liposomes can be further supplemented by measuring the PG-preference of PLA2 in BLPC polymerized mixed liposomes (Wu and Cho, 1993). Structure-function studies of other types of PLA2s based on this approach are in progress."
https://openalex.org/W1979996488,"Lophotoxin and the bipinnatins are members of the lophotoxin family of marine neurotoxins, which covalently react with Tyr190 in the α-subunits of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Bipinnatin-A, -B, and -C are protoxins that have been shown to spontaneously convert from inactive to active toxins during preincubation in buffer. However, in this report, we show that preincubation of lophotoxin did not result in an increase in the subsequent rate of irreversible inhibition of nicotinic receptors. Thus, unlike the bipinnatins, lophotoxin does not appear to be an inactive protoxin. Lophotoxin preferentially inhibited one of the two acetylcholine-binding sites on the receptor, and this preference resulted from both a higher reversible affinity and a faster rate of irreversible inhibition at this site. Association of 125I-α-bungarotoxin in the presence of lophotoxin was analyzed to obtain the apparent reversible association and dissociation rate constants for lophotoxin. The apparent association rate constant of lophotoxin was approximately 106-fold slower than expected for a diffusion-limited interaction, indicating that lophotoxin is a slow binding irreversible inhibitor. The kinetic constants that describe the interaction of lophotoxin with the receptor did not change in the presence of dibucaine, suggesting that, unlike agonists, the slow apparent association of lophotoxin does not result from a slow transition of the receptor to a desensitized conformation.

INTRODUCTIONNicotinic acetylcholine receptors are ligand-gated ion channels found on nerve and muscle cells. Two molecules of acetylcholine must bind to the receptor to open the channel and allow ion flux across the cell membrane. The muscle subtype of the nicotinic receptor is a pentamer of four homologous protein subunits (α2βγδ) in a circular arrangement spanning the membrane bilayer (Unwin, 1993). The two acetylcholine-binding sites of the receptor are located near the α/ γ- and α/ δ-subunit interfaces and have distinct pharmacological properties due to unique contributions of the γ- and δ-subunits (Blount and Merlie, 1989; Sine and Claudio, 1991a).The lophotoxins are marine neurotoxins that share a similar 14-carbon cyclic structure and demonstrate similar biological activity. A total of 12 active lophotoxin analogs have been isolated from various species of the soft corals Lophogorgia and Pseudopterogorgia (Fenical et al., 1981; Culver et al., 1985; Abramson et al., 1989; Wright et al., 1989). A radiolabeled analog was used to show that the lophotoxins irreversibly inhibit nicotinic receptors by forming a covalent bond with Tyr190 in the α-subunits (αTyr190) of the receptor (Abramson et al., 1988, 1989). The lophotoxins are unique among naturally occurring neurotoxins in their selective irreversible inhibition of a neurotransmitter receptor by covalent modification of a specific amino acid. Understanding the mechanism of the irreversible inhibition and the chemical nature of the covalent bond with αTyr190 may provide new insights for the design of novel site-directed irreversible receptor antagonists.The naturally occurring lophotoxin analogs bipinnatin-A, -B, and -C are initially inactive inhibitors (protoxins) that become active upon preincubation in aqueous buffer (Groebe et al., 1994). Although the bipinnatins presumably form an initial reversible complex with the nicotinic receptor prior to formation of a covalent bond with αTyr190, their initial reversible affinity is relatively low (Groebe et al., 1994). However, the bipinnatins are quite selective in that they 1) do not inhibit related neurotransmitter receptors, 2) are covalently incorporated only into the α-subunits of the nicotinic receptor, and 3) react with αTyr190 but not with an adjacent αTyr189 (Abramson et al., 1988, 1989). Due to the influence of the γ- and δ-subunits, the two acetylcholine-binding sites are inhibited by the bipinnatins at different rates. The bipinnatins preferentially inhibit the acetylcholine-binding site located near the α/ δ-subunit interface (Sine and Claudio, 1991a; Groebe et al., 1994). In addition, structural differences among bipinnatin-A, -B, and -C have profound effects on their apparent rates of irreversible inhibition and on the extent to which they discriminate between the two acetylcholine-binding sites (Culver et al., 1985; Abramson et al., 1991; Groebe et al., 1994).Lophotoxin has a chemical structure similar to the bipinnatins, and it has been suggested that lophotoxin is also unstable in aqueous buffer (Culver et al., 1984). However, in contrast to bipinnatin-B, the IC50 of lophotoxin decreases with increasing times of incubation with nicotinic receptors (Abramson, et al., 1991). This would be expected of a relatively stable irreversible inhibitor. An investigation of the stability of lophotoxin and the kinetics of its interaction with the nicotinic receptor is a necessary prerequisite for understanding the structural requirements for binding and, ultimately, the mechanism of irreversible inhibition. In this study, we investigate the stability of lophotoxin and report the kinetic constants for inhibition of nicotinic receptors on intact BC3H-1 cells by lophotoxin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsLophotoxin was purified as previously described and stored as a dry powder at −20°C (Abramson et al., 1991). Stocks of lophotoxin were resuspended to 10 mM in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide and stored at −20°C. Iodinated α-bungarotoxin ( 125I-α-BTX, 1The abbreviation used is: α-BTXα-bungarotoxin.10-20 μCi/μg) was purchased from DuPont NEN. All other materials, chemicals, and media were purchased from Fisher, Life Technologies, Inc., Sigma, and VWR.Maintenance of BC3H-1 CellsBC3H-1 cells were maintained in growth medium, and multiwell plates were treated with denatured porcine skin gelatin as previously described (Groebe et al., 1994). For all experiments, cells in growth medium were seeded into 24-well plates at a density of 8-12 × 103 cells/well. The growth medium was changed upon confluency (day 4 or 5) and changed once more prior to the experiment (days 7-10). The cells were used in experiments 2-3 days following the second medium change. For every experimental protocol, multiwell plates of cells were equilibrated to room temperature for 30 min, washed once with 1.0 ml of assay buffer (140 mM KCl, 25 mM HEPES, 5.4 mM NaCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1.7 mM MgSO4, 0.06 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4), and equilibrated for 20 min in 1.0 ml of fresh assay buffer. The binding site density for 125I-α-BTX was 219 ± 10.2 fmol/well (n = 29).Irreversible Inhibition of Nicotinic Receptors by LophotoxinStocks of lophotoxin (10 mM in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide) were diluted to the indicated toxin concentrations and 1% dimethyl sulfoxide in assay buffer. Irreversible inhibition of nicotinic receptors by lophotoxin was performed at room temperature as described by Groebe et al.(1994). Briefly, the assay buffer was replaced with 250 μl of the diluted lophotoxin preparation. At each time point, the cells were washed twice with 2.0 ml of assay buffer and then incubated for 1 h in 250 μl of a saturating concentration of 125I-α-BTX (15-20 nM). The cells were washed twice with 2.0 ml of assay buffer and resuspended in two 0.5-ml washes of 1% Triton X-100, and the amount of bound 125I-α-BTX was measured. Individual time points were performed in triplicate. Total 125I-α-BTX binding was determined from cells incubated for 1 h with 125I-α-BTX. Nonspecific binding of 125I-α-BTX was determined from cells incubated for 30 min with 100 nM α-BTX prior to 1 h of incubation with 125I-α-BTX.Association of 125I-α-BTX to Nicotinic Receptors in the Presence of Carbamylcholine or LophotoxinTo determine the association rate of 125I-α-BTX, 250 μl of 125I-α-BTX (15-20 nM) was added to multiwell plates of BC3H-1 cells. At the indicated times, the cells were washed twice with 2.0 ml of assay buffer, and the amount of bound 125I-α-BTX was measured. To determine the association and dissociation rates of unlabeled competitors, lophotoxin or carbamylcholine were simultaneously added with 125I-α-BTX. At the indicated times, the cells were washed as before, and the amount of bound 125I-α-BTX measured. To investigate the effect of dibucaine on the association and dissociation rates of lophotoxin and carbamylcholine, cells were equilibrated with 250 μl of dibucaine (20 μM) in assay buffer for 30 min. Simultaneous incubation of lophotoxin or carbamylcholine with 125I-α-BTX was then performed in the continued presence of dibucaine.Data Analysis, Nonlinear Regression, and Calculation of Kinetic ConstantsAn equation describing a double exponential decay as a function of time () was fit by nonlinear regression to data obtained from irreversible inhibition by lophotoxin. Nonlinear regression was performed on a Northgate 386 personal computer using InPlot 4.0 (GraphPad).f(x)=(A)e(1-ℜapp1)(x)+(B)e(-ℜapp2)(x)(Eq. 1) The percentages of available acetylcholine-binding sites are represented by A and B. The rate constants (kapp1 and kapp2) represent the apparent pseudo first-order rates for irreversible inhibition of the available acetylcholine-binding sites (Kitz and Wilson, 1962; Culver et al., 1984). Since it is known that lophotoxin preferentially inhibits one of the two acetylcholine-binding sites, A and B in were each constrained to equal 50 (Culver et al., 1984; Sine and Claudio, 1991a).ℜapp=ℜ3[L]/(Kd+[L])(Eq. 2) View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)d[B⋅R]/dt = (ℜ4*[B]*[R])-(ℜ5*[B⋅R])(Eq. 3) d[L⋅R]/dt=(ℜ1*[L]*[R])-(ℜ2*[L⋅R])-(ℜ3*[L⋅R])(Eq. 4) d[LR]/dt=ℜ3*[L⋅R](Eq. 5) The variables [B], [L], and [R] in can be replaced with the conservation of mass,[BT]=[B]+[B⋅R](Eq. 6) [LT]=[L]+[L⋅R]+[L-R](Eq. 7) [RT]=[R]+[L⋅R]+[L⋅R]+[B⋅R](Eq. 8) where [BT], [LT], and [RT] represent total concentrations of 125I-α-BTX, lophotoxin, and receptor, respectively. The value for k4 was experimentally determined from the association of 125I-α-BTX in the absence of competing drugs (5.49 ± 0.430 × 104M−1 s−1, n = 4). The value for k5 was previously determined to be 3.3 × 10−6 s−1 (Sine and Claudio, 1991b). The value for k3 was experimentally determined from an independent analysis of the irreversible inhibition of nicotinic receptors by lophotoxin (Eq. 2). Because of the limited ability of lophotoxin to distinguish between the two acetylcholine-binding sites, an average of the values for k3 was used in the analysis. Thus, the only unknown parameters in are k1 and k2. were numerically integrated, and the resultant curves were fit to the experimental data using a Marquardt-Levenberg iterative curve-fitting algorithm to determine the best-fit values of k1 and k2. The analysis was performed on a SparcStation 2 computer (Sun Microsystems) using the data analysis software package PROPHET 4.0 (Bolt, Beranek, and Newman, Inc.).RESULTSBipinnatin-A, -B, and -C are protoxins that are spontaneously activated during incubation in aqueous buffer (Groebe et al., 1994). Since the structure of lophotoxin is similar to the bipinnatins (Fig. 1), it might be expected that lophotoxin would also undergo spontaneous activation upon incubation in buffer. Indeed, the instability of lophotoxin has already been proposed (Culver et al., 1984). To investigate the stability and possible activation of lophotoxin, the apparent rate of irreversible inhibition of nicotinic receptors (kapp) by lophotoxin was determined after preincubation of the toxin in buffer for 0, 2, and 8 h. Surprisingly, preincubation of lophotoxin in buffer for up to 8 h did not result in a significant change in the apparent rate of irreversible inhibition of receptors (Fig. 2). In addition, no difference was detected by thin-layer chromatography between 100 μM lophotoxin in ethyl acetate and 100 μM lophotoxin incubated at room temperature for 1 h in water and 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (data not shown). These results suggest that lophotoxin does not undergo activation in aqueous buffer and that it is more stable than the bipinnatins.Figure 1The chemical structures of the lophotoxins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 2Effect of preincubation of lophotoxin on the rate of irreversible inhibition of nicotinic receptors. Receptors were incubated with 20 μM fresh lophotoxin (-•-) or with 20 μM lophotoxin that had been allowed to pre-incubate in assay buffer for 2 h (- -○- -) or 8 h (- -×- -). The value of log (100∗Rt/RT) is the log of the percentage of specifically bound 125I-α-BTX at each time point (Rt) to the specific binding of 125I-α-BTX to cells not exposed to lophotoxin (RT). Lines through the data were obtained by nonlinear regression of a double first-order exponential decay function ().View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The apparent rate of irreversible inhibition of nicotinic receptors by lophotoxin was determined over a toxin concentration range of 0.5-50 μM. At low concentrations of lophotoxin (<5 μM), two apparent rates of irreversible inhibition were clearly observable on a semi-log plot of the data (Fig. 3). At higher concentrations, the difference between the two rates became less pronounced. The apparent rates of irreversible inhibition for the two acetylcholine-binding sites (kapp1 and kapp2) did not increase linearly with increasing toxin concentration but approached upper limits at approximately 50 μM toxin (Fig. 4). Thus, for each binding site, the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) and the rate of irreversible inhibition (k3) could be determined by nonlinear regression of to values of kapp1 and kapp2 as a function of lophotoxin concentration (Table 1). It has been previously shown that lophotoxin preferentially inhibits the site with lower affinity for metocurine and that this site is located near the α/ δ-subunit interface in nicotinic receptors from BC3H-1 cells (Culver et al., 1984; Sine and Claudio, 1991a). Analysis of kapp as a function of lophotoxin concentration suggests that this site preference resulted from both a higher reversible affinity and a faster rate of irreversible inhibition at the α/ δ-site. Comparison of the bimolecular reaction constants (k2nd) for each acetylcholine-binding site reveals that lophotoxin discriminated between the two sites by approximately 4-fold (Table 1).Figure 3Irreversible inhibition of nicotinic receptors by lophotoxin. Receptors were incubated with 0.5 μM (•), 1.0 μM (○), 2.0 μM (×), 5.0 μM ( ▪), 10.0 μM ( ▴), 20.0 μM (□), and 50 μM (▵) lophotoxin. The data shown are from representative experiments at each concentration of toxin. The value of log (100∗Rt/RT) is the log of the percentage of specifically bound 125I-α-BTX at each time point (Rt) to the specific binding of 125I-α-BTX to cells not exposed to lophotoxin (RT).

For example, if it is assumed that the association of lophotoxin is diffusion limited (e.g.k1≥ 1 × 107M−1 s−1), then 100 μM lophotoxin (Kd = 4-11 μM) (Table 1) would be expected to reversibly occupy greater than 90% of the total population of acetylcholine-binding sites within 10−2 s (Motulsky and Mahan, 1984). In comparison, 20 nM 125I-α-BTX (k1 = 5.49 × 104M−1 s−1) requires at least 50 min to occupy the same number of sites. Thus, if 100 μM lophotoxin and 20 nM 125I-α-BTX are simultaneously added to receptors, lophotoxin would be expected to reversibly occupy almost all of the acetylcholine-binding sites before 125I-α-BTX was bound to any significant extent. The result would be a marked reduction in the apparent initial association rate of 125I-α-BTX. Surprisingly, however, 100 μM lophotoxin had little, if any, effect on the apparent initial association rate of 125I-α-BTX over the first 5 min (Fig. 5). These results are inconsistent with a diffusion-limited association rate for lophotoxin.Figure 5Association of 125I-α-BTX to nicotinic receptors in the presence and absence of lophotoxin. Association of 125I-α-BTX (20 nM) to nicotinic receptors was determined in the absence of lophotoxin (•) or after simultaneous addition of 125I-α-BTX and 20 μM (○) or 100 μM (×) lophotoxin. Lines through the data were obtained by nonlinear regression of numerically integrated differential equations as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The association (k1) and dissociation (k2) rate constants for unlabeled reversible competitors can be obtained indirectly by using the integrated rate equation that defines the association of a radiolabeled ligand in the presence of an unlabeled reversible competitor (Motulsky and Mahan, 1984; Contreras et al., 1986; Hawkinson and Casida, 1992). This method can be applied to any radiolabeled ligand and unlabeled reversible competitor provided that measurable accumulation of bound radioligand occurs before the unlabeled competitor reaches equilibrium (Contreras et al., 1986). However, the differential equations that describe the interaction of a radioligand and an unlabeled irreversible competitor with a receptor () are not readily integrated. This limitation can be overcome by numerical integration of the series of differential equations that describe these reactions, coupled with nonlinear regression analysis (Chandler et al., 1972; Williams et al., 1979; Zimmerle and Frieden, 1989; Frieden, 1993). Nonlinear regression of the numerical solutions of was applied to the complete association of 125I-α-BTX in the presence of lophotoxin to determine k1 and k2 for lophotoxin (Fig. 5). As expected, the values obtained for k1 (1580 ± 255 M−1 min−1, n = 6) and k2 (0.027 ± 0.009 min−1, n = 6) were independent of lophotoxin concentrations between 20 and 100 μM. Due to the limited ability of lophotoxin to distinguish between the two acetylcholine-binding sites (Table 1), the values for k1 and k2 at both sites could not be determined. However, the average Kd calculated from the ratio of k2/k1 (16.6 ± 4.6 μM) was similar to the average Kd (7.6 μM) of the two individual binding sites determined independently (Table 1).The observations that 1) the apparent initial association rate of 125I-α-BTX was unaffected for the first 5 min by saturating concentrations of lophotoxin and 2) that lophotoxin has an apparent association rate constant that is approximately 106-fold slower than a diffusion-limited rate indicate that lophotoxin is a slow binding inhibitor (Morrison and Walsh, 1988). A slow conformational isomerization of the receptor from a low affinity state to a higher affinity state is one possible mechanism that could result in a slow apparent association rate (Vauquelin et al., 1980; Contreras et al., 1986; Morrison and Walsh, 1988; Lejczak et al., 1989). Indeed, a slow transition of the nicotinic receptor from a low affinity state to a higher affinity state is thought to occur upon the binding of agonists, and this transition is facilitated by the noncompetitive allosteric inhibitor dibucaine (Weiland et al., 1976, 1977; Boyd and Cohen, 1980; Sine and Claudio, 1991a). For example, a low concentration of carbamylcholine (20 μM) had relatively little effect on the apparent initial association rate of 125I-α-BTX (Fig. 6, upper panel). However, in the presence of dibucaine, the same concentration of carbamylcholine resulted in an immediate and profound decrease in the apparent initial association rate of 125I-α-BTX (Fig. 6, upper panel). In the absence of carbamylcholine, dibucaine did not affect the association rate constant of 125I-α-BTX with the receptor (k1 = 5.48 × 104± 760 M−1 s−1, n = 2).Figure 6Effects of dibucaine on the interaction of carbamylcholine and lophotoxin with nicotinic receptors. Upper panel, association of 125I-α-BTX to nicotinic receptors was determined in the absence (•) and presence (○) of 20 μM carbamylcholine. Association of 125I-α-BTX was also determined in the presence of 20 μM carbamylcholine and 20 μM dibucaine (×). Lines through the data were obtained by nonlinear regression of numerically integrated differential equations describing the association of two reversible ligands with the receptor.

Lower panel, association of 125I-α-BTX to nicotinic receptors was determined in the absence (•-•) and presence (○-○) of 50 μM lophotoxin. The association of 125I-α-BTX was also determined in the presence of 50 μM lophotoxin and 20 μM dibucaine (×- - -×). Lines through the data were obtained by nonlinear regression of numerically integrated differential equations as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)If the slow association rate of lophotoxin resulted from a slow conformational transition of the receptor to a state similar to that induced by agonists, then dibucaine should be expected to facilitate this transition. However, dibucaine had little effect on the kinetic parameters that describe the interaction of lophotoxin with the nicotinic receptor. For example, dibucaine did not significantly effect the apparent rates of irreversible inhibition (kapp1 and kapp2) by lophotoxin (Fig. 6, middle panel). In addition, the association of 125I-α-BTX in the presence of lophotoxin was unaffected by the presence of dibucaine (Fig. 6, lower panel). Thus, no significant changes in k1, k2, or k3 were observed for lophotoxin in the presence of dibucaine, suggesting that the binding of lophotoxin does not induce a slow conformational change in the receptor similar to that induced by agonists.xyDISCUSSIONBipinnatin-A, -B, and -C are converted from inactive protoxins into effective irreversible inhibitors of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors after preincubation in buffer (Groebe et al., 1994). In contrast to the bipinnatins, the apparent rate of irreversible inhibition by lophotoxin did not increase after preincubation in buffer for up to 8 h. Thus, although its structure is similar to the bipinnatins, lophotoxin did not appear to undergo activation to a more effective inhibitor. In addition, the kapp for lophotoxin did not decrease significantly after preincubation in buffer, suggesting that lophotoxin is a relatively stable irreversible inhibitor of nicotinic receptors. These results are consistent with the observation that the longer lophotoxin is incubated with nicotinic receptors, the lower its observed IC50 (Abramson et al., 1991).Comparison of the structure of lophotoxin with the bipinnatins suggests that the greater stability of lophotoxin results from different substituents at positions R1 and R2 (Fig. 1). At position R2, lophotoxin lacks an acetate ester that is present in the bipinnatins. It is possible that spontaneous, non-enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetate ester at position R2 may be an initiating event in activation of the bipinnatins. Alternatively, it is possible that the presence of an aldehyde at position R1 in lophotoxin is responsible for the increased activity of lophotoxin and for its greater stability.Although the ability of lophotoxin to discriminate between the two acetylcholine-binding sites is relatively small, it is sufficient to demonstrate that lophotoxin preferentially inhibits the binding site that has lower affinity for metocurine (Culver et al., 1984). Additional investigations have shown that the higher affinity site for lophotoxin is the acetylcholine-binding site located near the α/ δ-subunit interface (Sine and Claudio, 1991a). In this study, unique values for the reversible affinity (Kd) and the rate of irreversible inhibition (k3) were determined for each acetylcholine-binding site. Preferential inhibition of the site at the α/ δ-subunit interface was shown to result from both a higher affinity and a faster rate of irreversible inhibition at this site. The ratio of k3/Kd defines a bimolecular reaction constant (k2nd) for the interaction of lophotoxin with each binding site of the receptor (Main, 1964; Berman and Leonard, 1989; Groebe et al., 1994). There was an approximate 4-fold difference in the bimolecular reaction constants for the two acetylcholine-binding sites, reflecting the extent to which lophotoxin preferentially inhibits the binding site at the α/ δ-subunit interface. Of the four lophotoxins for which the extent of discrimination between the two binding sites on the receptor is known, lophotoxin is the least able to distinguish between the two sites (Groebe et al., 1994). Apparently, the substituent at R3 is important for determining the extent of site discrimination by the different lophotoxins.Association (k1) and dissociation (k2) rate constants for reversible inhibitors can be determined directly if the inhibitor is radiolabeled. In addition to these rate constants, the rate of irreversible inhibition (k3) can also be determined directly for radiolabeled irreversible inhibitors. For example, the kinetic rate constants for the reversible and irreversible inhibition of μ opioid receptors by the irreversible antagonist β-funaltrexamine were measured directly from the specific binding of [3H]β- funaltrexamine to bovine striatal membrane preparations (Liu-Chen et al., 1990). The association (k1) and dissociation (k2) rate constants of unlabeled reversible inhibitors are difficult to obtain, but they can be determined indirectly from analysis of the extent to which the unlabeled inhibitor reduces the association rate of a radiolabeled ligand (Motulsky and Mahan, 1984; Contreras et al., 1986; Hawkinson and Casida, 1992). This indirect method results in valid estimates of k1 and k2 for unlabeled competitors only if measurable accumulation of bound radiolabeled ligand occurs before the unlabeled competitor reaches equilibrium (Contreras et al., 1986).The values of k1 and k2 for lophotoxin were determined by numerical integration of the series of differential equations that describe the binding of lophotoxin and 125I-α-BTX coupled with nonlinear least-squares regression (Chandler et al., 1972; Williams et al., 1979; Zimmerle and Frieden, 1989; Frieden, 1993). The kinetic rate constants k1 and k2 should be independent of lophotoxin concentration, and, as expected, the values for k1 and k2 determined using this method did not vary systematically with toxin concentrations between 20 and 100 μM. In addition, the average Kd for lophotoxin determined using this method (k2/k1) was similar to the average Kd determined independently from the irreversible inhibition of receptors by lophotoxin. These observations support the validity of this indirect approach for the determination of kinetic rate constants for unlabeled irreversible receptor antagonists.The apparent association rate constant of lophotoxin was approximately 106-fold slower than expected for a diffusion-limited bimolecular interaction. While the apparent values of k1 and k2 depend upon the model chosen, simple steric hindrance of the binding of lophotoxin to the nicotinic receptor () is sufficient to account for the low value observed for k1. However, a more complicated kinetic model that would also be consistent with the slow apparent association rate constant of lophotoxin involves an initial rapid association followed by a slow reversible conversion of the receptor from a conformation with low affinity for lophotoxin to a conformation with higher affinity (Vauquelin et al., 1980; Contreras et al., 1986; Lejczak et al., 1989). For example, agonists of the nicotinic receptor can be considered slow binding ligands because they promote a slow conversion of the receptor from a low affinity state to a higher affinity state (Weiland et al., 1976, 1977; Boyd and Cohen, 1980; Morrison and Walsh, 1988). A similar model has also been proposed for agonists and some antagonists of β-adrenergic receptors (Contreras et al., 1986; Samama et al., 1994). In fact, this may be a general mechanism by which the function of receptors is properly regulated (Karlin, 1967; Jackson, 1989).In the absence of agonist, there is no significant accumulation of desensitized receptors at the concentration of dibucaine used in these investigations (Sine and Taylor, 1982). However, in the presence of agonist, it is thought that dibucaine facilitates transition of the nicotinic receptor from a state with low affinity for agonists to a desensitized state with higher affinity for agonists (Weiland et al., 1977). This is demonstrated in the observation that the presence of dibucaine resulted in a substantial increase in the ability of carbamylcholine to slow the apparent initial association rate of 125I-α-BTX to the nicotinic receptor. If the apparently low value of k1 observed for lophotoxin was due to a slow conformational change in the receptor similar to that induced by agonists, then dibucaine would be expected to increase the apparent rate of irreversible inhibition by lophotoxin. However, dibucaine did not significantly alter the kinetic rate constants for lophotoxin. This indicates that lophotoxin does not induce a transition of the nicotinic receptor to a desensitized state as is observed for agonists. In addition, the kinetic rate constants do not describe lophotoxin's affinity for a desensitized receptor. These results, however, do not rule out the possibility that the binding of lophotoxin stabilizes an as yet uncharacterized conformation of the receptor that has a higher affinity for the toxin and that this conformation may facilitate receptor inhibition (Samama et al., 1994). Since lophotoxin reacts covalently with the receptor, such a mechanism would be consistent with the concept of a quiescent affinity label as described by Krantz et al.(1991).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Under these conditions, a low steady-state concentration of active lophotoxin (<1 nM) could be rapidly produced. If this were the case, then lophotoxin would appear to be a relatively stable, slow binding inhibitor.A complete understanding of the mechanism for the irreversible inhibition of nicotinic receptors by the lophotoxins would necessarily need to account for observed differences in the stabilities and biological activities of the different lophotoxins. It appears that structural differences at positions R1 and R2 contribute to the relative stability of the lophotoxins while differences at position R3 contribute to toxin selectivity for the two acetylcholine-binding sites. However, the effects of these structural differences may only serve to obscure similarities in the mechanism by which the different lophotoxins irreversibly inhibit nicotinic receptors. For example, is an attractive model for the irreversible inhibition of nicotinic receptors because it is consistent with the kinetic data for both lophotoxin and the bipinnatins (Groebe et al., 1994). INTRODUCTIONNicotinic acetylcholine receptors are ligand-gated ion channels found on nerve and muscle cells. Two molecules of acetylcholine must bind to the receptor to open the channel and allow ion flux across the cell membrane. The muscle subtype of the nicotinic receptor is a pentamer of four homologous protein subunits (α2βγδ) in a circular arrangement spanning the membrane bilayer (Unwin, 1993). The two acetylcholine-binding sites of the receptor are located near the α/ γ- and α/ δ-subunit interfaces and have distinct pharmacological properties due to unique contributions of the γ- and δ-subunits (Blount and Merlie, 1989; Sine and Claudio, 1991a).The lophotoxins are marine neurotoxins that share a similar 14-carbon cyclic structure and demonstrate similar biological activity. A total of 12 active lophotoxin analogs have been isolated from various species of the soft corals Lophogorgia and Pseudopterogorgia (Fenical et al., 1981; Culver et al., 1985; Abramson et al., 1989; Wright et al., 1989). A radiolabeled analog was used to show that the lophotoxins irreversibly inhibit nicotinic receptors by forming a covalent bond with Tyr190 in the α-subunits (αTyr190) of the receptor (Abramson et al., 1988, 1989). The lophotoxins are unique among naturally occurring neurotoxins in their selective irreversible inhibition of a neurotransmitter receptor by covalent modification of a specific amino acid. Understanding the mechanism of the irreversible inhibition and the chemical nature of the covalent bond with αTyr190 may provide new insights for the design of novel site-directed irreversible receptor antagonists.The naturally occurring lophotoxin analogs bipinnatin-A, -B, and -C are initially inactive inhibitors (protoxins) that become active upon preincubation in aqueous buffer (Groebe et al., 1994). Although the bipinnatins presumably form an initial reversible complex with the nicotinic receptor prior to formation of a covalent bond with αTyr190, their initial reversible affinity is relatively low (Groebe et al., 1994). However, the bipinnatins are quite selective in that they 1) do not inhibit related neurotransmitter receptors, 2) are covalently incorporated only into the α-subunits of the nicotinic receptor, and 3) react with αTyr190 but not with an adjacent αTyr189 (Abramson et al., 1988, 1989). Due to the influence of the γ- and δ-subunits, the two acetylcholine-binding sites are inhibited by the bipinnatins at different rates. The bipinnatins preferentially inhibit the acetylcholine-binding site located near the α/ δ-subunit interface (Sine and Claudio, 1991a; Groebe et al., 1994). In addition, structural differences among bipinnatin-A, -B, and -C have profound effects on their apparent rates of irreversible inhibition and on the extent to which they discriminate between the two acetylcholine-binding sites (Culver et al., 1985; Abramson et al., 1991; Groebe et al., 1994).Lophotoxin has a chemical structure similar to the bipinnatins, and it has been suggested that lophotoxin is also unstable in aqueous buffer (Culver et al., 1984). However, in contrast to bipinnatin-B, the IC50 of lophotoxin decreases with increasing times of incubation with nicotinic receptors (Abramson, et al., 1991). This would be expected of a relatively stable irreversible inhibitor. An investigation of the stability of lophotoxin and the kinetics of its interaction with the nicotinic receptor is a necessary prerequisite for understanding the structural requirements for binding and, ultimately, the mechanism of irreversible inhibition. In this study, we investigate the stability of lophotoxin and report the kinetic constants for inhibition of nicotinic receptors on intact BC3H-1 cells by lophotoxin."

The two sets differed only in that the Cyt-5 positions of all cytosines (80-90 cytosine residues per molecule) were fully methylated in the members of one set. Determination of the molar cyclization factors, persistence lengths, helix repeats, and torsional elastic constants revealed no significant differences between the two sets. These results imply that, at least for mixed sequence DNA, the biological consequences of cytosine methylation are likely to derive from either local structural distortions in the helix, which do not propagate as altered twist, or from direct protein-methyl cytosine interactions.

INTRODUCTIONThe Cyt-5 methylation of cytosine bases in DNA is known to play an important role in gene expression, in part through its modulation of transcriptional activation(1.Cedar H. Cell. 1988; 53: 3-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 2.Cedar H. Razin A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1049: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Moreover, cytosine methylation is believed to contribute to both inactivation of the X chromosome (3.Migeon B. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1993; 47: 685-686Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and genomic imprinting(4.Li E. Beard C. Janenisch R. Nature. 1993; 366: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar), wherein the phenotype of a particular mutant allele depends on the parent of origin of the allele. As an example of the latter, the fragile X syndrome(5.Hagerman R.J. Silverman A.G. Fragile X Syndrome: Diagnosis, Treatment, and Research. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore1991Google Scholar), the leading stably heritable form of mental retardation, is believed to express its most severe phenotype only when an abnormally expanded triplet-repeat sequence (CGG)n is fully methylated (6.McConkie-Rosell A.

In addition to the functional consequences of cytosine methylation, it is known that methylation can influence the formation of DNA cruciforms (9.Murchie A.I. Lilley D.M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 205: 593-602Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and triple helices(10.Xodo L.E. Manzini G. Quadrifoglio F. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H.

Methylation can also modulate the B to Z transition in DNA (12.Zacharias W. Jost J.P. Saulz H.P. DNA Methylation: Molecular Biology and Biological Significance. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1993: 27-38Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) as well as the apparent curvature of DNA containing A-tracts(13.Hagerman P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1980-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14.Hodges-Garcia Y. Hagerman P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7595-7599Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).The physical mechanisms by which cytosine methylation affects gene expression (or even DNA structure) are unknown. It has been demonstrated that methylation stabilizes Z-DNA and changes the helix twist of poly(dG•dC) copolymers from 10.5 to 10.7 base pairs (bp) 1The abbreviations used are: bpbase pair(s)PCRpolymerase chain reaction.per turn(12.Zacharias W. Jost J.P. Saulz H.P. DNA Methylation: Molecular Biology and Biological Significance. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1993: 27-38Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Moreover, an x-ray crystallographic analysis of synthetic oligonucleotides containing single cytosine (Cyt-5) methyl groups suggested that the methyl moiety induces a small, local structural perturbation of the involved base pair that includes a slight displacement of the base pair toward the minor groove(15.Heinemann U. Hahn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7332-7341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been observed, by our lab and by others (13.Hagerman P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1980-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14.Hodges-Garcia Y. Hagerman P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7595-7599Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 16.Diekmann S. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 4213-4217Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), that methylation of the Cyt-5 position in pyrimidines (dC→Me5dC; dU→dT) can either decrease or enhance curvature within oligo(purine)-oligo(pyrimidine) tracts, depending upon the location of the methylated bases. Those studies, which employed electrophoretic mobility as the assay for curvature, were not able to distinguish between changes in axial curvature and alterations in helix twist. Small differences in A-tract mobility could thus be due, in part, to the latter effect. Therefore, a more direct measurement of the influence of cytosine methylation on twist and intrinsic flexibility is warranted and constitutes the rationale for the current investigation.At present, the most sensitive method for measuring both intrinsic flexibility and helix twist is the T4 DNA ligase-catalyzed cyclization assay, originally described by Shore et al.(17.Shore D. Langowski J. Baldwin R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4833-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), and later developed further by our lab (18.Taylor W.H. Hagerman P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 363-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 19.Hagerman P.J. Ramadevi V.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and by others(20.Shore D. Baldwin R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 170: 957-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). A particular form of the cyclization assay, developed by Taylor and Hagerman(18.Taylor W.H. Hagerman P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 363-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), allows one to determine directly, in a single ligation reaction, the molar cyclization factor, JM. In this approach, one exploits the fact that for a given DNA concentration, the ratio of the initial rates of formation of linear dimer and monomer circle species is directly proportional to JM. The “ratio” approach is particularly suited for comparisons involving small changes in JM, as in the current instance.In the current investigation, cyclization assays were performed on two sets of DNA molecules ranging in length from 158 to 180 bp, the sets differing only in the methylation status of the cytosine residues, which constitute approximately 26% of the bases in the molecules (≈52% GC). The DNA concentrations were adjusted so that both bimolecular and cyclization reactions were always observed. The principal conclusion of this study is that, for mixed sequence DNA, cytosine methylation appears to induce almost no change of either helix twist or intrinsic flexibility.MATERIALS AND METHODSSynthesis and Purification of OligonucleotidesOligodeoxyribonucleotides were synthesized using a Biosearch model 8750 automated oligonucleotide synthesizer. All phosphoramidites were purchased from Milligen/Biosearch. The oligonucleotides were cleaved from their supports, deprotected, and purified as described elsewhere(21.Hagerman P.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7033-7037Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar).EnzymesTaq polymerase and EcoRI and MboI restriction endonucleases were obtained from Promega; calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim; T4 DNA ligase and polynucleotide kinase were purchased from New England Biolabs. Ligase-catalyzed reactions, both for constructs and for cyclization assays, contained 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mM potassium glutamate, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, and 1 mM NaEDTA. The New England Biolabs unit of ligase activity is used herein. 1 unit is defined as the amount of enzyme required to ligate 50% of HindIII DNA fragments of bacterial phage lambda in 30 min at 16°C.Plasmid Construction, Purification, and Sequence VerificationA set of 14 plasmids was produced, with each member of the set containing a distinct EcoRI fragment inserted into the EcoRI site of pGEM-7Zf(+) (Promega). The inserts ranged in size from 185 to 202 bp (Fig. 1). Plasmid-containing DH5αF′ cells were grown on L-broth supplemented with ampicillin at 100 μg/ml. Plasmid purification proceeded as described elsewhere(22.Hagerman P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4632-4636Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The plasmids were sequenced using the chain termination method of Sequenase version 2 from U. S. Biochemical Corp.Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Amplification and Purification of ProductsPCR amplifications were carried out in a Perkin-Elmer DNA Thermal Cycler 480. Reactions (200 μl) employed the following buffer: 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 200 μM of each dNTP. 5-methyl-2′deoxycytidine-5′triphosphate (Boehringer Mannheim) was substituted for dCTP when making methylated DNA. The DNA-primer concentration was 5 μM, and the template DNA concentration was approximately 8 nM (1 μg/ml). Primers L and R (see Fig. 1 and Table 1) were used to generate the majority of the PCR DNA fragments. Primers L1 and R1 each contain one additional nucleotide. Primers L1 and R were used to make the 164-bp PCR product, and primers L1 and R1 were used to make the 165-bp PCR product. These primers introduce MboI sites at each end of the PCR DNA products. The reactions were denatured at 94°C for 60 s, annealed at 60°C for 60 s, and elongated at 72°C for 180 s. PCR products were phenol extracted twice, followed by extraction with diethyl ether and ethanol precipitation. The PCR DNA was cut with MboI, followed by preparative electrophoresis on 7% polyacrylamide gels in E buffer (40 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.9, 20 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM EDTA). DNA was eluted from gel slices using a preparative electroelution system designed in this laboratory(22.Hagerman P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4632-4636Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). DNA concentrations were determined on a Cary 219 spectrophotometer.Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Preparation of Radiolabeled DNADNA molecules were treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.1 mM EDTA) for 30 min at 37°C. The reaction mixture was phenol/ether extracted and ethanol precipitated. The dephosphorylated DNA was 5′-end-labeled with 20 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) for 40 min at 37°C. The reaction mixture contained 0.5 μg of DNA and 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dithiothreitol. The label was then chased with cold ATP (0.1 mM final ATP concentration) and an additional 20 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase to fully phosphorylate the DNA. Labeled linear monomer was added to cold (non-labeled) DNA to the extent of ≤5% total DNA, thus permitting the accurate determination of DNA concentration through the measured A260 values of cold DNA(18.Taylor W.H. Hagerman P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 363-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar).Cyclization ReactionsThe cyclization buffer comprised 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mM potassium glutamate, 10 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM ATP. Cyclization reactions contained either 0.05 or 0.1 μg/ml of a linear DNA fragment having MboI ends and either 200 or 400 units/ml T4 DNA ligase. Reactions were performed at 30°C, and the reaction mixtures were preincubated for 10 min at 30°C before the addition of ligase. Cyclization reactions were terminated at various times with the addition of NaEDTA and sodium dodecyl sulfate to final concentrations of 12.5 mM and 0.5%, respectively. Individual cyclization reactions were always carried out at least three times.Analysis of the Products of Cyclization ReactionsProducts of the timed cyclization reactions were run on 11.5-cm vertical polyacrylamide gels (7% acrylamide; monomer:bisacrylamide ratio, 30.5:1). The gels were run at room temperature in E buffer. Following electrophoresis, the gels were dried under vacuum at 80°C and were used to expose phosphoimaging screens. The image screens were analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant 1.31 software. Volume integration was used to determine the intensities of individual linear and circular species. Standard errors were computed using Sigmaplot (Jandel Scientific). The standard error for the determination of DNA concentrations was approximately 18%.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe Use of a PCR-based Approach for Generating Sets of DNA Molecules for Cyclization StudiesOne of the prerequisites for a detailed study of the flexibility and helical properties of DNA via ligase-catalyzed cyclization is a set of substrate molecules that span at least one turn of the helix. These substrate molecules can be obtained through the direct isolation of cloned DNA fragments(18.Taylor W.H. Hagerman P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 363-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, a convenient alternative, once a suitable DNA sequence has been chosen, is to generate the actual substrate molecules through the use of PCR-based methods(23.Saiki R. Scharf S. Faloona F. Mullis K.B. Horn G.T. Erlich H.A. Arnheim N. Science. 1985; 230: 1350-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (6691) Google Scholar). In particular, PCR primers can be used to generate appropriate restriction sites (24.Arnheim N. Erlich H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 131-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and can also add to the number of DNA lengths available for cyclization through alterations in the number of nucleotides in the initially non-complementary primer sequence(25.Kahn J.D. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6343-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). 2G. Bellomy and P. J. Hagerman, manuscript in preparation.In the current study, a PCR-based approach has been used to produce the desired (MboI-derived) ends for cyclization (25.Kahn J.D. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6343-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and to introduce specific base modifications (Me5C)(26.Colasanti J. Sundaresan V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar).The general outline of the current approach is described in Fig. 1 and Table 1. The plasmids (pGEM) depicted in Fig. 1 contain various members of a set of DNA fragments cloned earlier as EcoRI-HindIII fragments (pESL series) in this laboratory(18.Taylor W.H. Hagerman P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 363-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). For each fragment, the HindIII-generated end was filled and subsequently converted to an EcoRI end by ligation with a linker containing an EcoRI site. The resultant plasmids, with phasing inserts as indicated in Table 1, were used as templates for PCR with R, R1, L, and L1 primers (Fig. 1, Table 1). The products of the PCR reactions, following cleavage with MboI, comprised sets of 14 DNA molecules ranging in length from 158 to 180 bp, slightly more than two turns of helix. The length spacing within each set was generally 2 base pairs, with additional species generated using the L1 and R1 primers. The two sets used in the current study thus differed only in the state of the cytosine residues (modified or non-modified).Determination of the Influence of Cytosine Methylation on the Intrinsic Flexibility and Helix Repeat of Mixed Sequence DNAIn the current study, the molar cyclization factors (JM) for each DNA molecule were determined from the ratios of the band intensities for cyclized monomer (c) and linear dimer (d) species using the following formula (18.Taylor W.H. Hagerman P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 363-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar):JM=4MoLimt→0 [c/d[c/d]],(Eq. 1) where Mo is the initial DNA concentration (molar monomer fragment) and c and d are the band intensities of the cyclic and linear dimer species, respectively. The phosphorimage of one experiment (174 bp) is displayed in Fig. 2; the corresponding c/d ratios (for both methylated and non-methylated 174-bp species) are plotted as a function of time in Fig. 3.Figure 2Phosphorimage of early time points in a cyclization reaction of the 174-bp methylated DNA fragment. m, monomer fragment; d, linear dimer; c, covalently-closed, circular (monomer) species.

The log10JMversus length curves have each been analyzed by subjecting the log10JM data to a global least-squares analysis, utilizing equation 73 of Shimada and Yamakawa(27.Shimada J. Yamakawa H. Macromolecules. 1984; 17: 689-698Crossref Scopus (296) Google Scholar), with the persistence length P, the torsional elastic constant C, and the helix repeat h as independent parameters. The results of both analyses are presented in Table 2. It is clear from these results (Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6) that cytosine methylation has no significant effect on either the helix repeat (identical maxima for the log10JM curves) or the intrinsic flexibility (equal average values and peak trough variations for the two curves) of the mixed sequence DNA molecules employed in the current study.Figure 4Plot of experimental values for log10JM for nonmethylated C residues as a function of length.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1980-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14.Hodges-Garcia Y. Hagerman P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7595-7599Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 16.Diekmann S. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 4213-4217Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that methylation can alter the mobilities of DNA molecules on polyacrylamide gels. In particular, for molecules possessing short homopurine-homopyrimidine tracts, both the extent of methylation and the locations of methyl groups within and adjacent to the tracts can influence the relative mobilities of the methylated species relative to their non-methylated counterparts. Although the methylation-dependent modulation of gel mobility was believed to be due to local changes in the direction of the helix axis, consistent with the notion of local structural perturbations suggested by crystallographic work(15.Heinemann U. Hahn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7332-7341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), one could not rule out contributions due to changes in either the helix repeat or the intrinsic flexibility of DNA. The current results have addressed this issue, providing strong support for a model in which the structural alterations introduced by the methyl groups are, in fact, due primarily to local changes in the direction of the helix axis rather than changes in either twist or flexibility.Although the persistence lengths determined in the current work are only slightly smaller (10-15%) than values previously determined by ligase-catalyzed DNA cyclization (450-490 Å)(18.Taylor W.H. Hagerman P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 363-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 20.Shore D. Baldwin R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 170: 957-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 28.Levene S.D. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we regard these differences as significant (Fig. 4). In particular, for molecules in the 158-180-bp range, an 11% increase in the persistence length (e.g. 400 Å→450 Å) would be accompanied by a 3.7-fold reduction in JM (Fig. 4), well outside of the current limits of error. One possible origin of this difference is a partial phasing of regions of curvature within the monomer fragments which, while not reflected in reduced gel mobilities, may increase the propensity for cyclization. In this regard, the current DNA fragments do possess several short A-tracts (Fig. 1). Moreover, we have observed 3Y. Hodges-Garcia and P. J. Hagerman, unpublished observations.that for DNA molecules closely related to those employed in the current study, monomer fragments are electrophoretically normal whereas dimers of those fragments display slight shifts in mobility, depending on the orientation of the monomers within the dimer. We have not investigated this latter issue in detail since it does not affect the central conclusions regarding the methyl effect. However, the current observations underscore the importance of considering “static” components of the persistence length (i.e. those due to stable bends) (30.Zhurkin V.B. Ulyanov N.B. Gorin A.A. Jernigan R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7046-7050Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 31.Trifonov E.N. Tan R.K.-Z. Harvey S.C. Olson W.K. Sarma M.H. Jundaralingam J. DNA Bending and Curvature. Adenine Press, Schenectady, NY1987: 243-253Google Scholar) 4J. A. Schellman and S. C. Harvey, submitted for publication.when discussing the intrinsic, elastic properties of DNA.The current values for the torsional elastic constant, C (Table 2), are well within the range of values for C (2-3.8 × 10−19 erg-cm) obtained in recent work (see (32.Hagerman P.J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 17: 265-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar) for review, also Refs. 18, 28, 33, and 34). As pointed out by Crothers et al.(35.Crothers D.M. Drak J. Kahn J.D. Levene S.D. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), differences within the above range may reflect real differences among DNA sequences employed for cyclization experiments, and although those authors “prefer” the value of 3.4 × 10−19 erg-cm, a unique value for C may not exist; rather, it may vary with sequence. In fact, in more recent work, Kahn et al.(33.Kahn J.D. Yun E. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1994; 368: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) have observed a value of 2.1 × 10−19 erg-cm from cyclization measurements, within 5% of the value obtained earlier by Taylor and Hagerman(18.Taylor W.H. Hagerman P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 363-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In this regard, the small, albeit reproducible deviations of the 159 and 169-bp fragments from the log10JM curves may again reflect the partial phasing of regions of curvature, leading to a more complex pattern for the length dependence of the log10JM curves. Preliminary Monte Carlo simulations 5Y. Hodges-Garcia and P. J. Hagerman, unpublished results.are consistent with this latter proposal.CONCLUSIONIn the current work, the DNA cyclization assay was used to demonstrate that cytosine methylation has little, if any, influence on either the intrinsic flexibility or the helix repeat of mixed sequence DNA. The values obtained for the torsional elastic constant and the helix repeat are consistent with published results, while the current values for the persistence length are slightly reduced, possibly due to contributions from regions of curvature within the molecules used for these studies. This latter issue warrants further investigation.The observation (29.Brukner I. Dlakic M. Savic A. Susic S. Pongora S. Suck D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1025-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) that GGGCCC elements give rise to curvature in the absence of A-tracts, coupled with earlier observations of the influence of methyl groups in specific GC elements(13.Hagerman P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1980-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14.Hodges-Garcia Y. Hagerman P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7595-7599Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), raises the possibility that the effects of methylation on flexibility and helix repeat may be different in such elements. This last issue also warrants further study. INTRODUCTIONThe Cyt-5 methylation of cytosine bases in DNA is known to play an important role in gene expression, in part through its modulation of transcriptional activation(1.Cedar H. Cell. 1988; 53: 3-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 2.Cedar H. Razin A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1049: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Moreover, cytosine methylation is believed to contribute to both inactivation of the X chromosome (3.Migeon B. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1993; 47: 685-686Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and genomic imprinting(4.Li E. Beard C. Janenisch R. Nature. 1993; 366: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar), wherein the phenotype of a particular mutant allele depends on the parent of origin of the allele. As an example of the latter, the fragile X syndrome(5.Hagerman R.J. Silverman A.G. Fragile X Syndrome: Diagnosis, Treatment, and Research. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore1991Google Scholar), the leading stably heritable form of mental retardation, is believed to express its most severe phenotype only when an abnormally expanded triplet-repeat sequence (CGG)n is fully methylated (6.McConkie-Rosell A.

A novel enzyme, protein NH2-terminal asparagine amidohydrolase, which can function in this pathway by potentially directing critical regulatory proteins possessing an amino-terminal asparagine residue formed from the removal of N-acetylmethionine, has recently been purified and characterized (Stewart, A. E., Arfin, S. M., and Bradshaw, R. A.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 23509-23517). Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a cDNA for porcine protein NH2-terminal asparagine amidohydrolase, which indicates that it is a new type of enzyme, not homologous to any previously identified protein.

INTRODUCTIONEukaryotic proteins with asparagine (as well as aspartic and glutamic acids) in the penultimate position retain the initiator methionine and become Nα-acetylated as a cotranslational event (1.Huang S. Elliot R.C. Liu P.S. Koduri R.K. Weickmann J.L. Lee J.H. Blair L.C. Ghosh-Dastidar P. Bradshaw R.A. Bryan K.M. Einarson B. Kendall R.L. Kolacz K.H. Saito K.

From data base analyses, some 43 unique (nonspecies-redundant) proteins beginning with the Met-Asn- sequence have been identified(4.Stewart A.E. Arfin S.M. Bradshaw R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23509-23517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins are almost exclusively involved in such regulatory functions as transcription, signal transduction, and developmental processes. Such proteins are often rapidly turned over, by as yet uncharacterized degradation pathways, in order to allow tight control over the steady-state level of activity. From previous studies(5.Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar, 6.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar, 7.Varshavsky A. Cell. 1992; 69: 725-735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), it is known that exposure of the penultimate asparagine (or aspartic or glutamic acid) residue destabilizes proteins, rendering them susceptible to N-end Rule-mediated polyubiquitinylation and degradation by the proteasome. The deblocking step is presumably catalyzed by an acylamino-acid hydrolase that removes the Nα-acetylmethionine (Fig. 1). However, neither amide nor acid side chains are recognized by the ubiquitin-protein ligase α (E3α), which has two independent binding sites for basic and large hydrophobic residues, respectively(7.Varshavsky A. Cell. 1992; 69: 725-735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 8.Reiss Y. Kaim D. Hershko A. J. Biol.

Such recognition is a prerequisite for the polyubiquitinylation step. In the case of proteins with either aspartic or glutamic acid at the NH2 terminus, recognition is achieved by the addition of an NH2-terminal arginine via arginyl-tRNA:protein transferase (10.Soffer R.L. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1973; 2: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 11.Ciechanover A. Ferber S. Ganoth D. Elias S. Hershko A. Arfin S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11155-11167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins with NH2-terminal asparagine are not substrates for arginyl-tRNA:protein transferase, and the asparagine must be converted to aspartic acid for them to be handled by this pathway. We developed an assay to detect such activity and have identified and purified to homogeneity an enzyme, protein NH2-terminal asparagine amidohydrolase (PNAA), 1The abbreviations used are: PNAAprotein NH2-terminal asparagine amidohydrolaseRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsGSPgene-specific primerPCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s).from porcine liver extracts that specifically deamidates NH2-terminal asparagine residues(4.Stewart A.E.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23509-23517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but has been herein called by the more systematically correct amidohydrolase.The enzyme does not act on substrates with internal or COOH-terminal asparagines and does not act on glutamine residues in any position. In this report, we describe the cDNA and predicted protein sequence and report the interesting observation that, like its activity, it represents a unique protein, unrelated to any known sequence at a detectable level.MATERIALS AND METHODSCNBr Digestion and Peptide FractionationPNAA was prepared as described previously(4.Stewart A.E.

The enzyme (3.3 μg) was dissolved in 70% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (50 μl), and an excess of CNBr was added. The mixture was purged with argon and placed in the dark for 20 h. The reaction mixture was loaded directly onto a C4 column (2.1 × 30 mm) attached to a Model 140 solvent delivery system (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA) equilibrated in buffer A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient to 100% buffer B (0.07% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) over 60 min. Absorbance at 214 nm was monitored.Protein and Peptide SequencingNative PNAA and PNAA-derived CNBr peptides were sequenced on a Model 477A pulsed-liquid sequenator with an on-line phenylthiohydantoin analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.).

After one step each of denaturation (95°C, 6 min) and annealing (cooling to 25°C over 20 min, followed by an increase to 45°C over 10 min), 2 units of Taq polymerase were added, and the temperature was held at 45°C for 2 min and then at 72°C for 8 min. Samples were then incubated through 40 cycles of 94°C for 1.75 min and 45 and 72°C for 2 min at each temperature, with a final extension at 72°C for 4 min. Amplified products were subcloned into the PCR-II vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions.Figure 2Design of degenerate PCR oligonucleotides based on PNAA amino acid sequences.

S. Biochemical Corp.). DNA sequence analysis was performed with the Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group software package (16.Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11516) Google Scholar) on line at the University of California Irvine Convex cluster and by electronic mail server through the BLAST software package provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information(17.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69088) Google Scholar).Northern Blot AnalysisThe 615-bp PCR fragment was labeled using the Multiprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Corp.) with [α- 32P]dCTP. Poly(A) mRNAs (5 μg each) from rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells and rat brain (kindly provided by Dr. Simona Raffioni) and porcine liver were electrophoresed on a 1% formamide/formaldehyde-agarose gel and blotted onto GeneScreen nylon membrane (DuPont NEN) by standard methods. Prehybridization was for 12 h at 42°C in 750 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaHPO4 (pH 7.4), 50% formamide, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Hybridization (5 × 106 cpm PCR probe) was for 22 h at 42°C. The membrane was washed with 2 × SSPE (standard sodium phosphate with EDTA) for 20 min at room temperature, followed by three 20-min washes at 55°C in 0.1 × SSPE, 2% SDS. The blot was exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film for autoradiography.λgt10 cDNA Library ScreeningPhage and Escherichia coli host strain C600-hfl were propagated and plated on NZYDT medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). A porcine liver λgt10 cDNA library (CLONTECH) was plated at a density of 35,000 plaque-forming units/150-mm plate. Phage plaques were lifted onto nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell) by standard procedures. Filters were prehybridized for 12 h at 42°C in 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 50 mM NaHPO4 (pH 6.8), 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, 2 × Denhardt's solution, and 10 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Hybridization (30 × 106 cpm PCR probe) was carried out for 22 h at 42°C. Filters were washed twice at room temperature in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min, followed by three washes at 42°C in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. Duplicate positive clones were identified by autoradiography, plaque-purified phage DNA was prepared by standard methods, and insert sizes were determined by PCR analysis using primers flanking the EcoRI cloning site.5′-RACE5′-RACE was performed as described by Frohmann et al.(15.Frohmann M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4323) Google Scholar). First strand cDNA synthesis from poly(A) RNA (5 μg) using Superscript II reverse transcriptase was primed with GSP-1 (20 pmol) at 48°C. 5′-RACE PCR reactions were performed with 5 μl of 5′-RACE reaction, GSP-2 nested primer (20 pmol), AP-1 primer (20 pmol), and (dT) 17 adapter primer (10 pmol). PCR reaction conditions were 1.5 min each of denaturation (95°C), annealing (57°C), and extension (72°C) for 24 cycles. RACE products were ligated to the PCR-II vector. Four clones of each product were selected at random and sequenced completely on both strands.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPartial amino acid sequence data were obtained by direct pulsed-liquid sequenator analysis of 50 pmol of high performance liquid chromatography-desalted porcine PNAA and of four CNBr fragments (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). Clearly, CNBr-1 is derived from the NH2 terminus of the protein, indicating that proline is the penultimate residue that is exposed by the cotranslational processing of the nascent protein by methionine aminopeptidase(2.Kendall R.L. Bradshaw R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20667-20673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, CNBr-2 also had an NH2-terminal proline that could have arisen during the CNBr cleavage from acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an Asp-Pro bond(18.Piszkiewicz D. Landon M. Smith E.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 40: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). This was shown not to be the case by sequence analysis of PNAA treated with only 70% trifluoroacetic acid, which produced only the single sequence corresponding to CNBr-1. The fractions containing CNBr-3 and CNBr-4 were actually mixtures of CNBr-1 and CNBr-2, respectively. Their sequences could, however, be accurately deduced by subtraction. Nonetheless, CNBr-1 and CNBr-2 were selected for preparing oligonucleotide primers because the sequence data for these peptides were considered to be more reliable.Figure 3Full-length porcine liver PNAA cDNA clone. The full-length sequence of PNAA constructed by combining the λgt10 library-derived cDNA and the 5′-region with the initiator methionine derived from 5′-RACE is shown. Underlined amino acid sequences correspond to those derived from sequencing of CNBr-1-4 peptides. The arrows indicate the positions and orientations of the PCR primers used to amplify the 615-bp fragment from porcine liver first strand cDNA as discussed in the text. The box-arrow shows the 5′-end of the isolated λgt10 cDNA clone. Boldface italics indicate the 5′- and 3′-stop codons, initiator methionine codon, and polyadenylation signal.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Eight degenerate oligonucleotide primers were prepared corresponding to both orientations from each end of CNBr-1 and CNBr-2 (Fig. 2). PCR was used to amplify a cDNA fragment from porcine liver poly(A) mRNA. An ~600-bp fragment was obtained using the PN-2/PN-5 primer pair. As expected, no products were obtained using the PN-1/PN-6 or PN-3/PN-8 primer pair, which would only produce a fragment if the order of CNBr-1 and CNBr-2 were reversed in the protein. Further positive controls indicated the authenticity of the 600-bp fragment. When the PN-2/PN-5 reaction product was used as template for the primer pairs PN-2/PN-7 and PN-5/PN-8, 564- and 54-bp fragments were produced, respectively, as predicted by amino acid sequence analysis. The PN-2/PN-5 fragment contained a 615-bp open reading frame with all of the CNBr fragment sequences (Fig. 3) and resolved a few amino acid sequencing ambiguities of CNBr-1 (data not shown).Utilizing the 615-bp sequence as a probe, three clones from a recombinant phage λgt10 porcine liver cDNA library were identified and sequenced. One clone (400 bp) had a 285-bp open reading frame (also present in the 615-bp PCR fragment) flanked on the 5′- and 3′-ends by untranslated sequence. In the absence of consensus intron-exon boundaries, it was assumed to be a library artifact. The remaining two clones of 756 bp were shown to be identical and encompassed 567 bp of open reading frame (encoding 189 amino acids) and 189 bp of 3′-untranslated region including a polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) 19 bp upstream from a 29-bp poly(A) tail.Although the continuous reading frame produced by the overlapping PCR and cDNA clones likely represented the full protein sequence (because the 5′-end of the PCR fragment began with the sequence corresponding to the NH2 terminus of the protein), 5′-RACE was employed to establish the 5′-untranslated sequence upstream from the putative initiation site. First strand cDNA prepared by reverse transcription of poly(A) RNA primed with a 5′-gene-specific oligonucleotide (based on the cDNA clone) produced products in the expected size range of 400-500 bp (based on a 1-kilobase RNA transcript determined by Northern analysis; see below) with gene-specific and nested RACE primers. Two cDNA RACE products of 460 and 672 bp were isolated and sequenced. These exactly overlapped the cDNA clone (and the PCR fragment) and contained 33 bp of 5′-untranslated sequence with a putative initiator methionine in the expected position. The upstream sequence (CGCGAGATGCCG) reflects a rarely used start site as judged by Kozak's rules(19.Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2794) Google Scholar). The presence of two in-frame stop codons immediately upstream from the designated translational start site lends support to this assignment. Subsequent analyses with higher stringency reverse transcription demonstrated that the shorter fragment (460 bp) arose from reverse transcriptase “jumping.”As shown in Fig. 3, a full-length sequence for porcine PNAA can be assembled from these data. In addition to the 5′-untranslated sequence, there is an open reading frame of 930 bp encoding 310 amino acids. The deduced composition is in good agreement with that determined for the whole protein(4.Stewart A.E. Arfin S.M. Bradshaw R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23509-23517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), including the 4 methionine residues that formed the basis of the CNBr strategy, and the calculated molecular mass of 34,760 Da is in excellent accord with the values of 33,000 and 34,000 Da observed by reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration, respectively(4.Stewart A.E. Arfin S.M. Bradshaw R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23509-23517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Northern analysis, using the 615-bp PCR fragment as a probe, was carried out with poly(A)-enriched RNAs from pig liver, rat brain, and rat PC12 cells. As shown in Fig. 4, a well resolved transcript of ~1 kilobase was identified. The levels of transcript appear to be much higher in the two neuronal sources (PC12 cells can be induced to differentiate into cells with a phenotype and morphology closely resembling those of sympathetic neurons(20.Greene L.A. Aletta J.M. Ruckenstein A. Green S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 147: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar)). However, the cellular origins of these transcripts are not yet known, and thus, the significance of these observations is not presently clear. Whether they suggest lower levels of potential N-end Rule-mediated turnover (5.Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar) in liver as opposed to brain remains to be determined.Figure 4Northern analysis of PC12 cell, rat brain, and pig liver poly(A)-enriched RNAs with a 615-bp PNAA PCR fragment. mRNAs (5 μg each) from PC12 cells, rat brain, and pig liver (lanes A-C, respectively) were electrophoresed on a 1% formamide/formaldehyde-agarose gel and blotted onto GeneScreen nylon membrane. The subcloned 615-bp PNAA PCR product (5 × 106 cpm) was used as a probe. The blot was hybridized for 22 h at 42°C in 750 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaHPO4 (pH 7.4), 50% formamide, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA.

We particularly examined E. coli asparaginases I (21.Spring K.J. Jerlstrom P.G. Berns P.G. Beacham I.R. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 135-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and II (22.Bonthron D.T. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 91: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) for more detailed comparison because these enzymes perform similar chemical transformations (albeit asparaginase acts only on free asparagine and PNAA only on NH2-terminal asparagines in peptide linkage). These enzymes have similar molecular masses (35,388 and 34,080 Da, respectively) as PNAA (34,760 Da), although both prokaryotic enzymes are tetrameric and PNAA is monomeric(4.Stewart A.E. Arfin S.M. Bradshaw R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23509-23517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Spring K.J. Jerlstrom P.G. Berns P.G. Beacham I.R. J.

However, similarity may still be found at the three-dimensional level when the structures of these (or other) enzymes are determined.Although the strategy to isolate and characterize PNAA(4.Stewart A.E. Arfin S.M. Bradshaw R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23509-23517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ultimately leading to the cloning and sequence determination described herein, was based on a presumed role in the N-acetylmethionine-linked pathway of the N-end Rule (23.Arfin S.M. Bradshaw R.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7979-7984Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), we have no direct evidence that PNAA participates in this pathway or that its activity is limited to this role. It is possible that it may direct the activation (or inactivation) of peptides or proteins that remain to be identified. Such pathways do not necessarily depend on acylamino-acid hydrolase, as NH2-terminal asparagines could be generated by proteolysis of precursor structures. For the most part, these are thought to be extracellular events, and PNAA appears to be an intracellular protein, but such processes may still be found to occur inside cells. There is significant intracellular proteolytic capacity, such as manifested in the calpains, the physiological and cellular relevance of which remains largely unknown(24.Croall D.E. Demartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). However, not withstanding such possibilities, the most likely role for PNAA remains its participation in the regulated turnover of Nα-acetyl-Met-Asn proteins. Given the nature of the proteins that bear this structure(4.Stewart A.E. Arfin S.M. Bradshaw R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23509-23517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this may eventually prove to be among the most important functions of the N-end Rule. INTRODUCTIONEukaryotic proteins with asparagine (as well as aspartic and glutamic acids) in the penultimate position retain the initiator methionine and become Nα-acetylated as a cotranslational event (1.Huang S. Elliot R.C. Liu P.S. Koduri R.K. Weickmann J.L. Lee J.H. Blair L.C. Ghosh-Dastidar P. Bradshaw R.A. Bryan K.M. Einarson B. Kendall R.L. Kolacz K.H. Saito K.

From data base analyses, some 43 unique (nonspecies-redundant) proteins beginning with the Met-Asn- sequence have been identified(4.Stewart A.E. Arfin S.M. Bradshaw R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23509-23517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins are almost exclusively involved in such regulatory functions as transcription, signal transduction, and developmental processes. Such proteins are often rapidly turned over, by as yet uncharacterized degradation pathways, in order to allow tight control over the steady-state level of activity. From previous studies(5.Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar, 6.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar, 7.Varshavsky A. Cell. 1992; 69: 725-735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), it is known that exposure of the penultimate asparagine (or aspartic or glutamic acid) residue destabilizes proteins, rendering them susceptible to N-end Rule-mediated polyubiquitinylation and degradation by the proteasome. The deblocking step is presumably catalyzed by an acylamino-acid hydrolase that removes the Nα-acetylmethionine (Fig. 1). However, neither amide nor acid side chains are recognized by the ubiquitin-protein ligase α (E3α), which has two independent binding sites for basic and large hydrophobic residues, respectively(7.Varshavsky A. Cell. 1992; 69: 725-735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 8.Reiss Y. Kaim D. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2693-2698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Reiss Y. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3685-3690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such recognition is a prerequisite for the polyubiquitinylation step. In the case of proteins with either aspartic or glutamic acid at the NH2 terminus, recognition is achieved by the addition of an NH2-terminal arginine via arginyl-tRNA:protein transferase (10.Soffer R.L. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1973; 2: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 11.Ciechanover A. Ferber S. Ganoth D. Elias S. Hershko A. Arfin S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11155-11167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins with NH2-terminal asparagine are not substrates for arginyl-tRNA:protein transferase, and the asparagine must be converted to aspartic acid for them to be handled by this pathway. We developed an assay to detect such activity and have identified and purified to homogeneity an enzyme, protein NH2-terminal asparagine amidohydrolase (PNAA), 1The abbreviations used are: PNAAprotein NH2-terminal asparagine amidohydrolaseRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsGSPgene-specific primerPCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s).from porcine liver extracts that specifically deamidates NH2-terminal asparagine residues(4.Stewart A.E.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23509-23517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but has been herein called by the more systematically correct amidohydrolase.The enzyme does not act on substrates with internal or COOH-terminal asparagines and does not act on glutamine residues in any position. In this report, we describe the cDNA and predicted protein sequence and report the interesting observation that, like its activity, it represents a unique protein, unrelated to any known sequence at a detectable level.

The β1-AR gene has not been assigned a promoter, although potential elements have been suggested. These elements include an inverted AGCCAAT sequence at −353 2All numbers are relative to the first base of the initiation codon.to −359 in the rat gene (10.Searles R.P. Nipper V.J. Machida C.A. DNA Seq. 1994; 4: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and at the corresponding location in the rhesus macaque gene (10.Searles R.P. Nipper V.J. Machida C.A. DNA Seq. 1994; 4: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and an inverted CCAAT box at −1001 in the human β1-AR gene(11.Collins S. Ostrowski J. Lefkowitz R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1172: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Start sites for the mouse brain β1-AR transcript occur at the equivalent of rat β1-AR gene bases −416, −421, and −492(12.Cohen J.A. Baggott L.A. Romano C. Arai M. Southerling T.E. Young L.H. Kozak C.A. Molinoff P.B. Greene M.I. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Using ribonuclease (RNase) protection assays, we have identified multiple start sites for the rat β1-AR mRNA, occurring primarily in two clusters surrounding bases −250 and −280. Using the same protocol, we have identified two polyadenylation sites, both of which are used in C6 cells and in cardiac tissue. Using transient transfection assays we have identified the region between bases −389 and −325 as necessary for expression. We have also determined that the bases between −1 and −156 and between bases −186 and −211 contain repressor and enhancer activities, respectively, which affect the expression of the rat β1-AR gene.

Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured using an EG & G Berthold AutoLumat LB 953 luminometer. RNA annealing incubations were performed using an MJ Research PTC-100 programmable thermal controller. Rat C6 glioma cells were from Dr. Kim Neve, Veterans Administration Hospital, Portland, OR. Rat L6 myoblast cells were from ATCC. The TriReagent protocol for cultured cells was used to isolate total RNA from rat C6 glioma and rat L6 myoblast cells grown to confluence in 100-mm dishes. Total RNA from 1.1 g of cardiac tissue was prepared using the TriReagent protocol for whole tissue. The integrity of the recovered RNA was verified by electrophoresis using a formaldehyde gel. Total RNA was divided into 20- or 100-μg aliquots and stored as an ethanol precipitate at −20°C until needed. RNA was tested for contaminating chromosomal DNA by RNase protection assay using a β1-AR gene sense transcript. RNase protection assays were based on the method of Gilman(14.Gilman M. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1993: 4.7.1-4.7.8Google Scholar). Template-containing plasmids were linearized and then stored in 1-μg aliquots in 2 μl of water at −20°C. Antisense transcripts were generated from 1 μg of template in a total of 20 μl of reaction mix (40 mM Tris•HCl, pH 7.9, 6 mM MgCl2, 2 mM spermidine, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM rNTPs (rATP, rGTP, rUTP), 12 μM rCTP, 20 units of RNasin, 20 units of T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase, and 50 μCi of 800 Ci/mmol [α- 32P]rCTP). The reaction was incubated at 37°C for 1 h. 25 μg of tRNA was added, and the RNA was precipitated with ethanol. The pellet was resuspended in 5 μl of 50% formamide with xylene cyanol and bromphenol blue and applied to a 6% acrylamide, 8.3 M urea gel to separate transcript from template and unincorporated label. The transcript was visualized by autoradiography, excised, and then eluted into 140 μl of 10 mM Tris•HCl, pH 7.5, 400 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA for 1-3 h. Antisense transcript (106 cpm) was combined with either 20 or 100 μg of total RNA and recovered by ethanol precipitation. The RNA was resuspended in 30 μl of hybridization solution (40 mM PIPES, pH 6.8, 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 80% formamide) and then denatured by incubating the mix at 95°C for 30 min. Annealing conditions were transcript-dependent and are described in the figure legends. Following the annealing step, 29 μl of the hybridization mix was added to an RNase mixture (final volume 400 μl; final composition: 10 mM Tris•HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5.4% formamide, with RNases A and T1 as indicated in the figure legends). Incubation conditions are indicated in the figure legends. The remaining 1 μl of the hybridization solution was used as an undigested control. RNase digestion was terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 20% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 25 μl of 2 mg/ml proteinase K. The mix was incubated first at room temperature for 10 min and then at 37°C for 15 min. The solution was extracted with phenol/chloroform and ethanol precipitated. The recovered sample was resuspended in formamide/dye solution, and the products were separated by electrophoresis on a 6% acrylamide, 8.3 M urea gel. A DNA sequencing ladder using pGEM3Zf(+) as the template was prepared to size the protected fragments. To correct for any differences that might occur between the migration of RNA and DNA, RNA standards of known size were compared with the DNA ladder. Expression was analyzed using the promoterless luciferase-expressing plasmid pXP1(13.Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar). A promoterless luciferase-expressing plasmid with a multicloning site oriented opposite that of pXP1 was constructed using the plasmid pT109luc(13.Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid pT109luc contains a luciferase gene under the control of a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter. The thymidine kinase promoter of pT109luc was removed by an XhoI/BglII double digest, followed by T4 DNA polymerase blunting of the ends and blunt end ligation. The XhoI and BglII sites were regenerated by the final ligation. The multicloning site of this plasmid, pd09, was verified by sequencing using a primer specific for the luciferase gene. The plasmids pXP1 and pd09 differ only in the orientation of the multicloning site, and pd09 is equivalent to pXP2 (13.Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar). The β1-AR gene PstI fragment from base −484 to +270 was subcloned into the PstI site of pGEM3Zf(+). Bases +1 to +270 were then removed from this fragment by exonuclease III deletion(15.Steggles A.W. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 241-242PubMed Google Scholar). A HindIII linker was inserted immediately 3′ of base −1, and the 5′-flanking sequence of the β1-AR gene was reconstructed using this fragment as the 3′ end. Deletion mutants of the rat β1-AR 5′-flanking sequences were then generated by one of two methods. For the first method, deletion mutants were generated by using endogenous restriction sites and available sites in the vector multicloning sites. For the second method, when no conveniently located restriction sites were available, unidirectional overlapping deletions were generated using exonuclease III(15.Steggles A.W. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 241-242PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion mutants were first screened by size and then characterized by sequencing. Selected deletion fragments generated by either protocol were subcloned into the multicloning site of pXP1 or pd09. All constructs were verified by dideoxy sequencing and restriction digests. The nomenclature of the β1-AR gene constructs is [5′ end, 3′ end] to indicate the 5′ and 3′ limits of a segment of DNA. Plasmids were introduced into rat C6 glioma cells by calcium phosphate transfection using HEPES-buffered saline (16.Kingston R.E. Chen C.A. Okayama H. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1990: 9.1.1-9.1.9Google Scholar). C6 cells were seeded at 6 × 105 cell/60-mm dish. After 24-48 h, each dish was cotransfected with 2.5 μg of the β1-AR construct and 2.5 μg of the plasmid ptkβ (Clontech), which expresses the gene for bacterial β-galactosidase under control of the thymidine kinase promoter. Cells were harvested after incubation for 16-24 h following the removal of the precipitate and assayed for luciferase activity, β-galactosidase activity, and protein. Parallel dishes transfected with pT109luc and ptkβ were prepared for each experiment, and all values were expressed as a percentage of the expression of pT109luc after normalizing for ptkβ expression. Because both pT109luc and ptkβ utilize the thymidine kinase promoter, control experiments were performed to verify that the thymidine kinase promoter has a linear response following the transfection of as much as 20 μg of pT109luc. Mock transfected cells were prepared for each experiment to determine the contribution of endogenous β-galactosidase activity. Each experiment included three dishes/construct, and each construct was measured in two or three separate experiments (n = 6 or n = 9). The values for all experiments were combined and subjected to analysis of variance. Significance was determined by the Tukey Compromise post hoc analysis (p = 0.05). Luciferase assays were performed as described(17.Brasier A.R. Tate J.E. Habener J.F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 1116-1122PubMed Google Scholar), with the lysis buffer modified to use 0.1% Triton X-100. β-Galactosidase was assayed using the GalactoLight Kit. Protein was measured using the method of Dulley and Grieve(18.Dulley J.R. Grieve P.A. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 64: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar), which is designed to eliminate interference from detergent. Transcriptional start sites for the mouse β1-AR gene were determined recently by primer extension analysis of total RNA(12.Cohen J.A. Baggott L.A. Romano C. Arai M. Southerling T.E. Young L.H. Kozak C.A. Molinoff P.B. Greene M.I. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We attempted primer extension analysis of the rat β1-AR transcript with two different primers and found that the primers gave different start sites. In addition, the same primers yielded products from rat L6 total RNA control assays, despite the absence of β1-AR transcript in L6 cells(19.Machida C.A. Bunzow J.R. Searles R.P. Van Tol H. Tester B. Neve K.A. Teal P. Nipper V. Civelli O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12960-12965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To resolve these problems, we analyzed the 5′ end of the rat β1-AR transcript in rat C6 glioma cells by RNase protection assay. To circumvent problems encountered when transcribing long probes from the high GC region of the β1-AR DNA, we developed a series of short overlapping probes which allowed us to “walk” along the β1-AR transcript. These three probes are [-216, −1], [-299, −81], and [-484, −159] (Fig. 1A). RNase protection assays using probe [-216, −1] annealed to 20 μg of total RNA showed only a single band about 40 bases shorter than intact probe (data not shown). The 40-base difference is equivalent to the pGEM3Zf(+)-derived sequence in the probe and indicates that the entire length of the β1-AR antisense probe was protected. RNase digestion of probe [-299, −81] annealed to 20 μg of total C6 RNA produced three faint bands. Two of these bands were diffuse and somewhat smaller than the full-length probe; the third appeared to be equivalent to probe minus vector sequence. To increase the signal from these multiple start sites, we increased the amount of total C6 RNA 5-fold to 100 μg and increased the amount of RNase A and T1 4-fold to 140 μg/ml and 7 μg/ml, respectively, to accommodate the increased amount of RNA. The increased amounts of RNase for this assay did not change the pattern of the digestion, but the increased signal allowed us to identify two clusters of start sites at approximately −250 and −280 (Fig. 1B, lane 6). In addition, the third band represented RNA initiated close to or upstream of −299, indicating that all β1-AR start sites are not within the −250 and −280 clusters. Control experiments using 100 μg of C6 cell RNA and probe [-299, −81] digested at 15°C for 2 h with 3.5 μg/ml RNase T1 verified that the clusters are not the result of RNA “breathing” (data not shown). To identify the start sites with greater resolution and to identify additional start sites upstream of base −299, RNase protection assays were performed with probe [-484, −159]. This probe identified the same clusters of start sites as probe [-299, −81] (Fig. 1C, lane 2). In addition to the −280 and −250 clusters, digests using probe [-484, −159] contained several additional bands (Fig. 1C, lane 2). These are derived from transcriptional start sites at −295, −304, and −309. These additional sites contribute to the band at −299 for probe [-299, −81] in lane 6 of Fig. 1B. In total, 18 sites are identified by probe [-484, −159] (Fig. 1D). The darkest band in the −280 cluster (Fig. 1C, lane 2) corresponds to base −281. The probe has a cytosine at the base complementary to base −281. This cytosine is 3′ to 2 consecutive adenosines. Since neither RNase A nor T1 digests 3′ of adenosines, the signal at −281 may represent the signal from start sites at −279, −280, and −281. Alternatively, base −281 may be the primary transcription start site. The digest of probe [-484, −159] also has a product which indicates intact probe minus vector sequence (data not shown). This suggests that there are more start sites upstream of base −484, which is consistent with the transfection analysis of the β1-AR 5′-flanking sequences (below). The control experiments with each of these probes using L6 RNA did not produce any protected fragments. To complement the identification of the transcriptional start sites for this gene, and thereby delineate the 5′ and 3′ extent of the β1-AR transcript, we have used RNase protection assays to characterize the use of the two potential polyadenylation signals found at +2450 and +2732 in the rat β1-AR gene. RNase protection assays using antisense probe [+2084, +2901] hybridized to C6 glioma total RNA gave four bands (Fig. 2A, lane 3). Two bands correspond to the use of each of the potential polyadenylation signals. The 650-base band corresponds to mRNAs that have used the polyadenylation signal at +2732. Based upon relative signal intensities, this signal is the preferred site. The 370-base band corresponds to use of the polyadenylation signal at +2450. We believe that the third band at 817 bases is the product of β1-AR transcript that has not been polyadenylated. Such transcript would be eliminated by the isolation of mRNA using oligo(dT) but is present in the total RNA that we have used for this experiment. The fourth band is undigested probe, the recovery of which is variable, even when the conditions of the hybridization and digestion are unchanged. RNase protection assays of total RNA from cardiac tissue (Fig. 2B, lane 2) produce the same pattern of products in the same proportions, but in this autoradiogram it lacks the band from undigested probe. There is a minor amount of variable background banding in these experiments which has been minimized by the digest conditions. This background results from the high AT content of the probe. To identify regions of importance in the control of rat β1-AR expression, deletion mutants of the 5′-flanking sequences were constructed and then linked to the expression of the gene for firefly luciferase. Deletion of the β1-AR 5′-flanking sequences from the 5′ side showed a moderate increase in activity as the deletion progressed from −3354 to −484 (Fig. 3). Several of these deletions involved large sections of DNA (e.g. the deletion of the bases between −3354 and −1804). Because the transfections are done with a constant 2.5 μg of construct/dish, it is likely that most of the differences in expression are the result of significant changes in the molar amounts of construct as the constructs become smaller. Therefore, no significant elements are identified by this series of deletions. However, the much lower level of expression of the construct [-1253, −479] compared to the expression of construct [-1253, −1] is significant. There is a 76% decline in activity when the segment between bases −484 and −1 is removed. This indicates that important elements of expression are present between bases −484 and −1. The start site data from the RNase protection assays localize the primary start sites to this section of the gene, and the high levels of expression obtained with [-484, −1] indicate that promoter activity is also present in this region. The residual activity of [-1253, −479] is consistent with the RNase protection assay data, which indicate that a portion of the transcript population initiates upstream of −484. To examine further the region between −484 and −1, two series of overlapping deletions were generated and used to promote luciferase expression. Unlike the deletions performed above, these deletions do not result in a significant change in the size of the overall plasmid, and therefore interpretation of changes in expression is not complicated by the change in molar ratios of the transfected DNAs. The first set of deletions progressed from the 5′ side of [-484, −1] (Fig. 4). Overall, there is a 78% difference in activity between [-484, −1] and [-160, −1]. Deletion of the bases between −484 and −389 does not significantly change expression, but when the 18 bases between −389 and −370 are deleted, there is a 35% decline in expression. Expression declines by 61% when the bases between −370 and −299 are deleted. Continued deletion from −299 to −160 does not affect expression. The expression of the last three constructs ([-299, −1], [-244, −1], [-160, −1]) differs significantly from the expression of pXP1 (p = 0.05). This may result from cryptic promoters present in the high GC regions of the remaining DNA. A second set of recombinants was prepared by deletion of [-484, −1] from the 3′ side. Luciferase activity varied in response to the deletion of three specific regions of the gene (Fig. 5). First, there is a 35% increase in signal when the region between bases −1 and −159 is deleted. Second, deletion of the region between bases −159 and −258 results in a 62% decline in activity. The majority of this decline occurs with the deletion of the region between −186 and −211, removal of which results in a 52% loss of activity. Interestingly, activity remains essentially level when the bases between −211 and −325 are removed, even though all of the start sites are deleted. Deletion of bases between bases −325 and −367 results in a loss of 81% of the remaining activity. Expression from the plasmid [-484, −367] is not significantly different from that of pXP1 (p = 0.05). These data imply that the region between −325 and −367 is necessary and sufficient for activity, even in the absence of the endogenous start sites. The region between bases −389 and −325 is implicated by both the 5′ and 3′ deletions as containing elements important for β1-AR gene expression. There is an inverted AGCCAAT box at base −353 to base −359, and the deletion of this element may contribute to the decline in activity which occurs when the region between −389 and −299 is deleted. To examine this, a linker was used to ligate two deletion clones to produce a construct without the inverted AGCCAAT sequence (Fig. 6A). The resultant internal deletion lacked the endogenous bases between bases −348 and −360. Expression of luciferase linked to this internal deletion was not significantly different than expression from the intact fragment [-484, −1] (p = 0.05) (Fig. 6B). This indicates that the inverted AGCCAAT is not a significant factor in the expression of the β1-AR gene. We have identified multiple cap sites for the rat β1-AR mRNA by RNase protection assay. The use of multiple transcription start sites is common among adrenergic receptor genes(9.Kobilka B.K. Frielle T. Dohlman H.G. Bolanowski M.A. Dixon R.A.F. Keller P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7321-7327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Handy D.E. Gavras H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24017-24022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of particular interest, the rat α1b-adrenergic receptor gene has been reported to use five start sites controlled by three different promoters(21.Gao B. Kunos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15762-15767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to this, the human α1b-adrenergic receptor transcript was shown by RNase protection assay and primer extension analysis to possess a cluster of start sites about 177-193 bases upstream from the translation initiation codon(22.Ramarao C.S. Denker J.M.K. Perez D.M. Gaivin R.J. Riek R.P. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21936-21945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the rat and the mouse β1-AR genes both use multiple start sites, but there are no start sites common to the two genes. This may represent species variations, or it may represent tissue variation: the mouse transcript was isolated from brain, and the rat transcript was isolated from a cultured glioma cell line. Overall, the use of multiple start sites may reflect the high GC content commonly found in the genes for the adrenergic receptors, since multiple start sites are common in genes with high GC promoters(23.Feng P. Ohlsson M. Ny T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2022-2027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Luo X. Kim K.-H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3249-3254Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25.Reynolds G.A. Basu S.K. Osborne T.F. Chin D.J. Gil G. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Luskey K.L. Cell. 1984; 38: 275-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In addition to the heterogeneity of the 5′ end of the transcript, our data also identify two functional polyadenylation sites for the β1-AR gene. Multiple sites of polyadenylation for single genes are known, and they can be part of the complex regulation of transcript processing(26.Leff S.E. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1091-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). For example, multiple polyadenylation sites are present in the adenovirus major transcriptional unit, and selection of specific polyadenylation sites varies over the course of infection (27.Mann K.P. Weiss E.A. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 9: 2411-2419Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Functionally, the switching of polyadenylation signals may have an effect on the stability of a transcript by altering the secondary structure of the 3′-untranslated sequence(28.Jackson R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 9-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Therefore, regulation of β1-AR gene expression may be a complex function involving promoter/enhancer elements modulating transcription levels while changes in polyadenylation site alter mRNA stability. Variation in the use of the polyadenylation sites is not apparent in the comparison of C6 cell and cardiac tissue. Whether this is the case for β1-AR mRNAs obtained from other tissue is under investigation. Also, whether there is a shift in the selection of polyadenylation sites under conditions that have an effect on receptor number (e.g.in vitro during agonist-induced down-regulation; (31.Hough C. Chuang D.-M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar)) and in vivo during conditions such as congestive heart failure, which exhibits a marked decline in the levels of β1-AR expression (29.Brodde O.-E. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 203-242PubMed Google Scholar) is also currently under investigation. Transfection analyses of specific upstream flanking sequences of the rat β1-AR gene inserted into luciferase expression vectors show that there is no change in expression when the primary start sites at −280 and −250 are deleted. However, sequences both upstream and downstream from the start sites appear to have a significant effect on expression. First, the combination of 5′ and 3′ deletion constructs identifies the region between bases −389 and −325 as important for expression. There may be multiple elements within this region, since the decline in activity with progressive 5′ deletion has a notably smooth appearance, suggesting the progressive deletion of additive elements. A linker mutant removing the consensus AGCCAAT sequence in this region demonstrates that it is not functional. We are currently examining this region more closely to characterize specific functional elements. Two more important regions of the β1-AR gene flanking sequences, −1 to −186 and −186 to −211, are identified by the 3′ deletion constructs. Both exist downstream of the start sites of transcription, so deletions of these regions must be considered in the context of both transcriptional regulation and transcript structure. The increase in activity accompanying the 3′ deletions from −1 to −211 may represent destabilization of the DNA. Just as we have encountered difficulty in the in vitro transcription of this gene, the high GC content may impede transcription of the gene in vivo, and removal of this portion of the gene may facilitate the progress of the transcription complex. The dramatic decline in activity with the deletion of the 25 bases between −186 and −211 may result from the loss of two overlapping AP-4 (30.Mermod N. Williams T.J. Tjian R. Nature. 1988; 332: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) sites (bases −204 to −196 and bases −201 to −193). However, as indicated above, these variations in expression may also result from changes in transcript structure. In conclusion, we have identified multiple transcription start sites for the rat β1-AR gene. These sites occur primarily in two clusters, located at about bases −280 and −250. Our data indicate that deletion of the sites does not affect expression. Sequences located between −389 and −325 appear to be critical for expression, presumably through the presence of a promoter or an enhancer. An inverted AGCCAAT sequence within this region is not functional. The regions between −1 and −159 and between −186 and −211 also appear to have a significant effect upon the levels of expression. Because these regions are downstream from the transcription start sites, it is not clear whether their effect is transcriptional or if it results from an alteration in the structure of the mRNA. We have also identified two functional polyadenylation signals in the rat β1-AR gene. Further analysis is currently under way to characterize elements necessary for the expression of the β1-AR gene.

https://openalex.org/W2044358266,"Interferon-β (IFN-β) has been shown to regulate epidermal keratinocyte growth and differentiation. In this study, we examined the effects of recombinant human IFN-β on the expression of the gene encoding the 230-kDa bullous pemphigoid antigen (BPAG1), a marker of the mitotic basal cell phenotype in the epidermis. Northern analysis revealed a dose- and time-dependent suppression of BPAG1 expression by IFN-β in cultured human keratinocytes from several different donors, and incubation of the cells with IFN-β in the presence of cycloheximide demonstrated that this effect required ongoing protein synthesis. The inhibition of BPAG1 gene expression was also demonstrated at the protein level by indirect immunofluorescence using a monoclonal antibody recognizing the human 230-kDa bullous pemphigoid antigen. Transient transfections of cultured keratinocytes with BPAG1 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene plasmids indicated marked suppression of the promoter activity by IFN-β, and deletion constructs were able to identify a defined region containing the responsive element (IFN-β inhibitory element). Reduced transcription of the BPAG1 gene by IFN-β was also demonstrated by in vitro nuclear run-on assays. These data, which indicate inactivation of transcription of a basal keratinocyte-specific gene (BPAG1) by IFN-β, provide novel insight into the mechanisms of IFN-β-mediated keratinocyte gene regulation and epidermal differentiation in inflammatory diseases. Interferon-β (IFN-β) has been shown to regulate epidermal keratinocyte growth and differentiation. In this study, we examined the effects of recombinant human IFN-β on the expression of the gene encoding the 230-kDa bullous pemphigoid antigen (BPAG1), a marker of the mitotic basal cell phenotype in the epidermis.

The high M(r) lyase is also present in the mitochondria. The purified enzyme contains at least two proteins with apparent M(r) values of approximately 50,000 and approximately 70,000. Activity is stimulated by dithiothreitol, alpha-keto acids, and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate; aminooxyacetate is an inhibitor. The enzyme catalyzes a competing (half) transamination reaction between pyridoxal 5'-phosphate cofactor and cysteine-S-conjugate substrate; added alpha-keto acids promote conversion of active site pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate to pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. The enzyme also catalyzes a full (but weak) transamination between L-phenylalanine and alpha-keto-gamma-methiolbutyrate. The purified enzyme is not recognized by polyclonal rabbit antibodies to cytosolic rat kidney glutamine transaminase K (another cysteine-S-conjugate beta-lyase of rat kidney) and has no obvious similarities to other pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-containing enzymes. In addition to catalyzing elimination reactions with S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine and S-(1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl)-L-cysteine, the enzyme reacts with leukotriene E4 and 5'-S-cysteinyldopamine. Finally, the cytosolic and mitochondrial enzymes are activated by alpha-ketoglutarate. Thus, the possibility must be considered that, in kidneys of animals exposed to various cysteine conjugates, the high M(r) lyase contributes to the generation of pyruvate, ammonia, and reactive fragments in vivo. Many cysteine conjugates are nephrotoxic, and the high M(r) lyase(s) may be involved."

https://openalex.org/W2065961105,"Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is a cytokine whose actions are largely restricted to the nervous system because of the predominant neuronal distribution of its receptor, CNTFRα. In this study, we sought to define the binding characteristics of CNTF to cultured sympathetic neurons and cell lines of neuronal origin.

Subsequent studies have revealed that CNTF can also enhance the survival of sensory neurons (Skaper and Varon, 1986), motor neurons (Sendtner et al., 1990; Arakawa et al., 1990; Oppenheim et al., 1991), cerebellar neurons (Lärkfors et al., 1994), and hippocampal neurons (Ip et al., 1991). CNTF inhibits proliferation and enhances cholinergic properties of neuronal precusors from the sympathetic ganglion (Ernsberger et al., 1989) and stimulates cholinergic differentiation of mature sympathetic neurons (Saadat et al., 1989). In addition, effects of CNTF on developing oligodendrocytes (Louis et al., 1993), denervated (Helgren et al., 1994) and intact (Gurney et al., 1992; Forger et al., 1993) skeletal muscles have also been documented. ciliary neurotrophic factor interleukin leukemia inhibitory factor superior cervical ganglia nerve growth factor disuccinimidyl suberate. Although CNTF does not contain a signal sequence which is typically associated with secreted proteins, Curtis et al. (1994) have demonstrated that CNTF can be retrogradely transported by adult sensory neurons from the periphery, suggesting a means by which CNTF gains access to neurons. Moreover, both sensory and motor neurons show greatly increased transport of CNTF following peripheral nerve lesion. Taken together, these observations suggest a possible role for CNTF in motor and sensory neurons after injury. Indeed, potent effects of CNTF toward motor neurons have been demonstrated in vitro (Arakawa et al., 1990; Wong et al., 1993) and confirmed in vivo using an axotomized-facial nerve paradigm (Sendtner et al., 1990) or mouse mutants that exhibit neuromuscular deficits (Sendtner et al., 1992; Mitsumoto et al., 1994). These studies suggested therapeutic potential of CNTF in musculomotor diseases and have led to human clinical trials for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Barinaga, 1994). Since the cloning of the CNTF-binding protein (hereon CNTFRα) the signal transduction pathway that mediates the effects of CNTF has been studied extensively. CNTFRα shows greatest homology to the α component of the IL-6 receptor (Davis et al., 1990). Recent findings using MAH cells and other neuronal cell lines have demonstrated that CNTF, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), IL-6, and oncostatin M share common signaling pathways which involve gp130, the signal transducing component for the IL-6 receptor (Ip et al., 1992); and all except IL-6 also share another receptor component LIFR (for review, see Ip and Yancopoulos, 1992). This family of cytokines has recently been shown to utilize the Jak/Tyk family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases (Stahl et al., 1994). gp130 was first identified as a signal transducer for the IL-6 receptor and found to confer high affinity binding to the low affinity IL-6 receptor-α (Taga et al., 1989; Hibi et al., 1990). LIFR, on the other hand, was originally cloned as a LIF-binding protein (Gearing et al., 1991). It has been suggested that gp130 and LIFR together form a functional LIF receptor complex (Gearing et al., 1992; Ip et al., 1992; Davis et al., 1993a) and that addition of soluble CNTFRα to this complex is sufficient to convert a functional LIF receptor into a functional CNTF receptor (Ip et al., 1992; Stahl et al., 1993; Davis et al., 1993b). Whereas the broad distribution of both LIFR and gp130 accounts for the very widespread actions of LIF in neural and non-neural tissues, the limited distribution of CNTFRα (predominantly to the nervous system) is consistent with the much more restricted actions of CNTF (Ip et al., 1993). While the therapeutic potential of CNTF is becoming apparent and its signal transduction pathway is being unraveled, the binding characteristics of CNTF to its receptor, the first step of the signal transduction cascade, need to be elucidated. Given the predominant neuronal distribution of CNTFRα, this study aimed to examine the binding and pharmacological characteristics of 125I-CNTF to post-mitotic (sympathetic) neurons as well as cell lines of neuronal origin. Neonatal rat superior cervical ganglia (SCG) were dissociated and cultured as described previously (Kessler, 1984) in a medium consisting of Ham's nutrient mixture F12 with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), NGF (100 ng/ml), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). Cultures were maintained at 37°C in a humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere. Nonneuronal cells were eliminated by treatment with cytosine arabinoside (10 μM) on days 1 and 3 of culture. Cultures were fed three times/week and were routinely used for binding assays within 2 weeks. Ewing sarcoma (EW-1) and PC12 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM glutamine. MAH cells were maintained in culture as described previously (Birren and Anderson, 1990). Binding assays were usually carried out on cells at 50-80% confluence. Recombinant rat CNTF was iodinated by a modification of the lactoperoxidase method (Marchalonis, 1969) as described previously (DiStefano et al., 1992). The final reaction mixture was chromatographed through a Superdex-75 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column to separate the labeled monomeric CNTF from dimeric and other multimeric derivatives. The percentage of incorporation was about 70-80%, as determined by thin layer chromatography. The specific activity was typically around 1000 Ci/mmol. In all our experiments, only the monomeric radioiodinated CNTF was used; it was stored at 4°C and used within 1 week of preparation. The radiolabeled CNTF showed comparable biological activity (70-90%) to native CNTF in supporting the survival of chick ciliary neurons in culture. Binding was performed directly on a monolayer of cells. Medium was removed, and cells were washed for 60 min with assay buffer consisting of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), 0.1 mM bacitracin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The cells were incubated in 125I-CNTF for 2 h at room temperature, followed by two quick washes with assay buffer. Cells were lysed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% SDS and counted in a Packard Gamma Counter at 90-95% efficiency. Nonspecific binding was defined by the binding in the presence of 100-1000-fold excess of unlabeled CNTF. Specific binding of 125I-CNTF to SCG, EW-1, MAH, and PC12 cells usually ranged from 70 to 95%. The optimal number of cells/well was determined by preliminary experiments to ensure that less than 10% of the ligand would be bound at equilibrium. Total number of cells/well was counted before assay for SCG neurons and estimated from the initial plating densities for cell lines. For cross-linking experiments, SCG neurons were incubated with 500 pM 125I-CNTF for 2 h at room temperature. The receptor(s) was cross-linked to the ligand by the homobifunctional cross-linking agent DSS (150 μM, for 30 min, room temperature), followed by a wash with 50 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA (pH = 7) to inactivate DSS. Protein lysates were boiled in sample buffer; equivalents of 6000-8000 neurons were loaded per lane and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 7.5% acrylamide gels. The gels were dried and exposed to film. Trophic factors tested for their ability to compete with radiolabeled CNTF included rat CNTF, human CNTF, CNTF-myc (Squinto et al., 1990), NGF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), all at concentrations of 100 nM. Rat and human CNTF were the recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (Masiakowski et al., 1991). LIF and IL-6 were obtained from Upstate Biochemical, Inc. (UBI). NGF was purified from mouse salivary glands (Mobley et al., 1976). Recombinant human BDNF and NT-3 were prepared, purified, and provided by Amgen-Regeneron Partners. Data from saturation curves were analyzed using a modification of the nonlinear least-squares regression program, LIGAND (Munson and Rodbard, 1980). Data from inhibition experiments were analyzed using GRAPHPAD (ISI). In this study, cultured rat sympathetic neurons were used, for two reasons, as a model to study CNTF receptor binding. First, it is well established that homogeneous population of SCG neurons can be obtained by tissue culture techniques; thus specific binding reflects only 125I-CNTF binding to sympathetic neurons and not to nonneuronal cells. Second, there is a well-defined physiological response of SCG neurons to CNTF, i.e. the stimulation of cholinergic phenotype and suppression of adrenergic phenotype (Saadat et al., 1989). We compared the binding of 125I-CNTF to SCG neurons with that of other adrenergic cells, namely, PC12 cells and MAH cells. EW-1 was also examined as an example of a responsive, but non-adrenergic cell type. The time course of binding of 125I-CNTF to cultured SCG neurons is shown in Fig. 1. The binding of 125I-CNTF was rapid and reversible. At 22°C, equilibrium was reached by 90 min and remained stable for up to 4 h. Since the ligand concentration did not change appreciably during the binding reaction (5.1% or less bound), our experiments were performed under pseudo-first-order conditions. Dissociation of the bound complex was initiated after 120 min of incubation with the addition of excess cold ligand (100 nM rat CNTF). The association rate constant (k +1) for SCG neurons can be calculated from the pseudo-first-order equation: k +1 = k obs - k −1/[L], where k obs is the slope of a plot of ln(Be/Be-B) versus time (= 2.1 × 10−2 min−1) and k −1 is the negative slope of a plot of ln(B/Bo) versus time (= 1.9 × 10−2 min−1); thus, k +1 = 2.0 × 10−2 nM−1min−1 at 100 pM 125I-CNTF. The dissociation constant (KD) for 125I-CNTF in SCG neurons calculated from the ratio k −1/k +1 was 950 pM. Scatchard analysis of saturation binding data was carried out in SCG neurons (Fig. 2 A), EW-1 (Fig. 2B), PC12 (Fig. 2C), as well as MAH (Fig. 2D) cells, using concentrations of 125I-CNTF ranging from 20 pM to 10 nM. Binding of 125I-CNTF to all the cell types studied was saturable and displayed high and low affinity receptor sites. In SCG neurons, the biphasic Scatchard plot approached linearity at both extremes of 125I-CNTF concentrations (Fig. 2A), suggesting the presence of two classes of receptors. Indeed, Scatchard analysis revealed two dissociation constants with values of 1.1 pM and 2.4 nM, and the number of low affinity binding sites is 87-fold higher than that of the high affinity sites (approximately 6.5 × 106/neuron and 7.5 × 104/neuron, respectively). As a result, the KD derived from kinetic studies (950 pM) is much closer to the low affinity binding constant. Thus, the KD derived from our kinetic studies is an approximation and mostly for the purpose of comparison; the KD derived from Scatchard analysis is more accurate. Scatchard plots of 125I-CNTF binding to EW-1, PC12, and MAH cells also revealed two classes of receptors (Fig. 2, B-D). The high affinity receptors in these cell lines were 6-9-fold lower in affinity than those of SCG neurons (8.6 pM for EW-1, 9.3 pM for PC12, and 5.7 pM for MAH). With the exception of MAH cells (K D2 = 412 pM), the dissociation constants of the low affinity receptor were similar in all cells, 2.4, 1, and 3.4 nM in SCG neurons, EW-1 cells and PC12 cells, respectively (summarized in Table 1). Primary sympathetic neurons, by far, contained the greatest number of both high and low affinity receptor/cell than any of the cell lines examined, most likely a result of their extensive neuritic network. The ratio of high to low affinity sites is similar in SCG neurons and MAH cells (1:87 and 1:69, respectively), but lower in PC12 and, particularly in EW-1 cells (1:20 and 1:5, respectively).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Inhibition of 125I-CNTF binding (at 100 pM) to cultured SCG neurons (Fig. 3A) and EW-1 (Fig. 3B) cells was determined for 15 concentrations of rat and human CNTF. The IC 50 values for rat and human CNTF were 65 pM and 5 nM, respectively, for SCG neurons and 75 pM and 1.2 nM for EW-1 cells (Table 1). Human CNTF was, thus, less potent than rat CNTF in displacing 125I-CNTF binding in both cell types. This is in good agreement with the difference in potency between rat and human CNTF as described previously (Panayotatos et al., 1993). Interestingly, although LIF can elicit the same functional response in SCG neurons as CNTF (i.e. stimulation of choline acetyltransferase activity and decreased tyrosine hydroxylase activity), LIF did not compete for CNTF binding even at 100 nM concentration. The neurotrophins (such as NGF, BDNF, NT-3) and IL-6 did not compete for 125I-CNTF binding in any cell type examined (Fig. 3A). In 125I-CNTF cross-linking experiments in cultured SCG neurons, we observed three specific bands at molecular masses of approximately 100, 150, and 200 kDa, which corresponded to those predicted for the cross-linked products of 125I-CNTF (22 kDa) with CNTFRα (80 kDa), gp130 (145 kDa), and LIFR (190 kDa), respectively (Fig. 4). The identities of the upper two cross-linked products containing LIFR and gp130 have been verified by immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies (Ip et al., 1992; Stahl et al. 1993). Cross-linking to all three protein bands was displaced by rat CNTF, CNTF-myc, and human CNTF, but not by NGF, BDNF, or NT-3. This indicates the specificity of the binding and that binding of CNTF to SCG neurons recruits all three components of the receptor complex. Cultures of SCG neurons and EW-1 cells were treated with CNTF or LIF (0.01-100 ng/ml) for 24 and 72 h, respectively, prior to 125I-CNTF binding assay. We found that pretreatment with CNTF or LIF resulted in a concentration-dependent loss of specific 125I-CNTF binding to SCG neurons (Fig. 5 A), producing a 50% loss at approximately 0.5 ng/ml of CNTF or 5 ng/ml LIF. Similarly, pretreatment of EW-1 cells with CNTF resulted in a comparable loss of binding at approximately 5 ng/ml (Fig. 5B). IL-6 pretreatment had no effect on CNTF binding to either cell types. Our findings show that pretreatment with CNTF or LIF down-regulates CNTFRα in SCG neurons and EW-1 cells. This is consistent with the fact that CNTF and LIF share common receptor components, and further suggests that their signaling pathways converge down stream. In parallel with the discovery and complete characterization of a number of neurotrophic factors has been the molecular characterization of their receptors (for review, see Davis and Yancopoulos, 1993; Ip and Yancopoulos, 1993). The biological effects and signal transduction pathways for one of these factors, CNTF, have been extensively studied, and binding properties of CNTF to its receptor have been reported in transformed hematopoietic cell lines (Gearing et al., 1994). Considering the predominant neuronal distribution of CNTFRα, knowledge of CNTF binding characteristics in neurons is important for understanding the physiological role of CNTF in vivo. In this study, we sought to define the binding characteristics of 125I-CNTF to primary sympathetic neurons and to cell lines of neuronal origin. We report that 125I-CNTF binds to cultured SCG neurons, EW-1, MAH, and PC12 cells via two classes (high and low affinity) of receptors which can be distinguished on the basis of their dissociation constants (KD1 ∼10−12 M and KD2 ∼10−9 M). A hallmark of neurotrophic factors is their potency in producing biological effects; the high affinity binding constant of CNTF is in good agreement with the observed potency of its biological effects on chick ciliary ganglion neurons (EC 50 = ∼2 pM; Masiakowski et al., 1991) and rat sympathetic neurons (EC 50 = ∼20 pM; Sadaat et al., 1989). It has been shown that the three CNTF receptor components (CNTFRα, LIFR, and gp130) are initially unassociated on the cell surface and are brought together in a step-wise fashion upon CNTF binding (Stahl and Yancopoulos 1993). The non-signal transducing binding of CNTF to CNTFRα is most likely low affinity, whereas high affinity binding probably ensues when the tripartite receptor complex is formed. Interestingly, PC12 cells, which lack LIFR, 2N. Y. Ip, N. Stahl, and G. D. Yancopoulos, unpublished data.confer both high and low affinity binding, suggesting that CNTF•CNTFRα complex binds to gp130 with high affinity with or without further heterodimerizing with LIFR. This is in contrast to the findings in transformed hematopoietic cells where LIFR, but not gp130, was shown to be critical for generating high affinity CNTF binding (Gearing et al., 1994). CNTF and LIF have been shown to elicit identical functional responses in SCG neurons (Kotzbauer et al., 1994), and they both induce tis11 and c-fos gene expression and the phosphorylation of LIFR and gp130 in MAH and EW-1 cells (Ip et al., 1993; Stahl et al., 1993). Similarly, retrograde transport of 125I-CNTF in lesioned sciatic nerve was inhibited by excess unlabeled CNTF as well as LIF (Curtis et al., 1994). In the present study, however, we found that the 2 cytokines have different binding characteristics. LIF, even at 100 nM concentration, did not compete for 125I-CNTF binding in SCG neurons. While CNTF and LIF share common signal transduction components (LIFR and gp130), CNTFRα is unique for CNTF. Thus, although LIF does not bind to CNTFRα, it can deplete LIFR and gp130 and, in turn, should block high affinity CNTF binding. However, because the concentration of 125I-CNTF used in our competition experiments (100-300 pM) labeled both high and low affinity binding sites, and since low affinity sites were in great excess, changes in high affinity binding would most likely be obscured. In addition to the classical physiologic responses that neurotrophic factors are known to evoke, they also regulate and modulate the functional properties of their own receptors. They may increase or decrease the number of their receptors or change the efficiency of binding to their receptors. For instance, intrathecal infusion of NGF to dorsal root ganglia resulted in an up-regulation of low affinity NGF receptor mRNA levels (Verge et al., 1992). Our findings showed that CNTF binding to SCG neurons was down-regulated by prior treatment with either CNTF or LIF. It is most likely that these decreases in specific binding were due to down-regulation of receptors, and not simply competition by any residual CNTF left over from treatment because similar down-regulation was also evident after LIF treatment. As LIF and CNTF share common receptor signaling subunits, gp130 and LIFR, all downstream signals produced by these two ligands are identical. However, CNTF is the only cytokine that binds to CNTFRα (for review, see Stahl and Yancopoulos, 1993). LIF does not bind to nor require CNTFRα for signal transduction, but was able to down-regulate CNTF binding in sympathetic neurons; this strongly suggests that such down-regulation is a specific event and not due to competition by any residual CNTF left over from treatment. Moreover, results from kinetic studies have shown that CNTF dissociates from its receptor to an almost base-line level within 20 min following a cold chase (Fig. 1) and within 40 min even without cold chase (data not shown). Since the cultures were washed for 60 min prior to binding, it is unlikely that there was sufficient CNTF left behind to alter the binding results. Taken together, the data represented in Fig. 5 were not the result of receptor saturation, but rather, specific down-regulation of CNTF binding after LIF or CNTF treatment. Unlike the competition experiments, where the ability of LIF to compete for CNTFRα sites was specifically measured, the regulation experiments might reflect the binding of LIF to any of the three components in the CNTFR complex. In this case, LIF binds to LIFR which then heterodimerizes with gp130 and initiates signal transduction; upon activation of their specific receptor components, the signal transduction pathways of CNTF and LIF converge downstream in the neuron. It is possible that SCG neurons cannot distinguish whether the signal was elicited by CNTF or LIF; thus, although LIF does not compete for CNTF binding, it can indirectly down-regulate CNTFRα. This may have functional consequences in vivo under pathological and pharmacological conditions. If LIF is present in the vicinity where CNTF is “released” or administered in vivo, it may cause an indirect down-regulation of CNTF receptors and, in turn, may alter the efficacy of CNTF. Thus, binding characteristics of CNTF and regulation of its receptor complex provide crucial information to the use of CNTF as a therapeutic agent.

https://openalex.org/W1992799550,"Many important mediators of inflammation result from the liberation of free arachidonic acid from phospholipid pools which is thought to result from the action of phospholipase A2 (PLA2). It is believed, therefore, that the inhibition of PLA2 would be an important treatment in many inflammatory disease states. The anti-inflammatory agent BMS-181162 (4-(3′-carboxyphenyl)-3,7-dimethyl-9-(2″,6″,6″-trimethyl-1″-cyclohexenyl)-2Z,4E,6E,8E-nonatetraenoic acid) selectively inhibits PLA2 and has been shown to block arachidonic acid release in whole cells. The mechanism of inhibition of human nonpancreatic-secreted PLA2 by BMS-181162 is investigated in this paper. A scooting mode assay in which the enzyme is irreversibly bound to vesicles of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphomethanol containing 5 mol % of 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, was used to characterize the inhibition. With this assay system, BMS-181162 inhibited the enzyme in a dose-dependent manner. Compounds which inhibit in the scooting mode have been shown to be competitive inhibitors in the interface (Gelb, M. H., Berg, O., and Jain, M. K. (1991) Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 1, 836-843). This was verified by demonstrating that the inhibition was not due to the desorption of the enzyme from the lipid-water interface. Additionally, the compound did not measurably affect the rate of association onto the vesicles. Therefore, the inhibition was not the result of a modulation of the bilayer morphology nor an interaction with the interfacial binding site on the enzyme. The degree of inhibition was dependent on the reaction volume which indicates that the inhibitor is only partially partitioned into the bilayer. After compensating for this partitioning, the dose-dependent inhibition could be defined by kinetic equations describing competitive inhibition at the interface. The equilibrium dissociation constant for the inhibitor bound to the enzyme at the interface (KI*) was determined to be 0.013 mol fraction, thus demonstrating that BMS-181162 represents a novel structural class of tight-binding competitive inhibitors of human nonpancreatic secreted PLA2. Using Escherichia coli membranes as substrate, to which the enzyme binds to the interface reversibly, the inhibition showed a nonclassical kinetic pattern which is also consistent with a partial partitioning of the inhibitor into the bilayer. This was verified by a direct measurement of the amount of inhibitor remaining in solution. The implications for in vivo efficacy which result from this mechanism are discussed. Many important mediators of inflammation result from the liberation of free arachidonic acid from phospholipid pools which is thought to result from the action of phospholipase A2 (PLA2). It is believed, therefore, that the inhibition of PLA2 would be an important treatment in many inflammatory disease states. The anti-inflammatory agent BMS-181162 (4-(3′-carboxyphenyl)-3,7-dimethyl-9-(2″,6″,6″-trimethyl-1″-cyclohexenyl)-2Z,4E,6E,8E-nonatetraenoic acid) selectively inhibits PLA2 and has been shown to block arachidonic acid release in whole cells. The mechanism of inhibition of human nonpancreatic-secreted PLA2 by BMS-181162 is investigated in this paper. A scooting mode assay in which the enzyme is irreversibly bound to vesicles of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphomethanol containing 5 mol % of 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, was used to characterize the inhibition.

https://openalex.org/W2045187349,"Alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase was found in the peroxisomes of animal liver for the first time as follows. The distribution of alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase activity with nonanol as substrate in the light mitochondrial fraction (peroxisome-enriched fraction) of rat liver was examined by centrifugation in a sucrose density gradient. Most of the enzyme activity was localized in the mitochondria, with some activity in the peroxisomes. The administration of clofibrate, a peroxisome proliferator, to rats resulted in a marked increase of the enzyme activity in the peroxisomes, but not in the mitochondria. The enzyme was found to be located in the matrix of the peroxisomes. The evidence was obtained that the enzyme differed from alcohol dehydrogenases and alcohol oxidizing systems found previously. The enzyme activity was not affected by pyrazole, an inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase and sodium azide, an inhibitor of catalase. The enzyme was NAD+-dependent and oxidized straight chain aliphatic alcohols with a variety of carbon chains (C2-C18), showing the maximum on nonanol. Km values toward these aliphatic alcohols decreased with increasing chain length. The major reaction product was identified as the carboxylic acid by using high performance liquid chromatography.

INTRODUCTIONThree separate enzymes have been reported to be involved in conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde in mammalian liver. 1) The most widely known is the NAD+-linked cytosolic alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1), which catalyzes the reversible interconversion of a wide variety of alcohols and their corresponding aldehydes(1.Branden C.-I. J ö rnvall H. Eklund H. Furugren B. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 2. Academic Press, New York1975: 103-190Google Scholar, 2.Pietruszko R. Majchrowicz E. Noble E.P. Biochemistry and Pharmacology of Ethanol. 1. Plenum Press, New York1979: 87-106Crossref Google Scholar). 2) A mixed function oxidase (EC 1.6.2.4, 1.14.14.1), known as the microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system, catalyzes the NADPH and oxygen-dependent oxidation of short chain alcohols to corresponding aldehydes(3.Thurman R.G. Ley H.G. Scholz R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 25: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). 3) Catalase, which is present in the peroxisomes, can also catalyze the oxidation of short chain alcohols to corresponding aldehydes by its peroxidatic activity(4.Chance B. Boveris A. Oshino N. Thurman R.G. Williamson J.R. Drott H.R. Alcohol and Aldehyde Metabolizing Systems. Academic Press, New York1977: 261-274Google Scholar). The latter two enzymes are NAD+-independent and cannot oxidize higher primary alcohols(5.Chance B. Oshino N. Biochem. J. 1971; 122: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).In the present study, we report that a fourth enzyme that can oxidize aliphatic alcohols with a variety of carbon chain (C2-C18) to corresponding aldehydes is present in the peroxisomes of rat liver. The enzyme is NAD+-dependent and induced by the administration of clofibrate, a peroxisome proliferator.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimalsThirty-day-old male rats (body weight, 100-110 g) of the Wistar strain were maintained ad libitum on either a normal diet (Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) or a normal diet supplemented with clofibrate (0.3%, v/w) for 3 weeks.Subcellular Fractionation of Rat Liver by Differential CentrifugationAll procedures were carried out at 0−4°C. Rat livers were cut into small pieces with scissors and homogenized by one excursion in nine volumes of 0.25 M sucrose in 20 mM glycylglycine, pH 7.5, in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer with a Teflon pestle at 600 rpm. The homogenate was filtered through two layers of cheesecloth and subjected to differential centrifugation to obtain heavy mitochondrial, light mitochondrial, microsomal, and soluble fractions as described by de Duve et al.(6.de Duve C. Pressman B.C. Gianetto R. Wattiaux R. Appelmans F. Biochem. J. 1955; 60: 604-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (2554) Google Scholar).Sucrose Density Gradient Centrifugation of Light Mitochondrial Fraction with a Vertical RotorA portion (3 ml) of the light mitochondrial fraction (peroxisome-enriched fraction), corresponding to 2 g of liver, was layered on a 31.5-ml sucrose gradient (24-54%, w/w) with 2.5 ml of 57% sucrose solution as a cushion in the bottom and centrifuged at 132,000 × g for 70 min in a Hitachi (Tokyo, Japan) 55P-72 centrifuge with a vertical rotor (RPV 50T-160). Fractions (2.2 ml) were collected from the bottom of the gradient.Assay of EnzymeAlcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase activity was, unless specified, assayed spectrophotometrically by measuring the rate of NAD+ reduction(7.Bonnichsen R.K. Brink N.G. Methods Enzymol. 1955; 1: 495-500Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The reaction system contained 100 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mM nonanol, 2 mM NAD+, 0.5 mg of bovine serum albumin, and enzyme in a total volume of 1.0 ml. Catalase (EC 1.11.1.6)(8.Aebi H. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, New York1974: 673-684Crossref Google Scholar), glutamate dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.3)(9.Schmidt E. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, New York1974: 650-656Crossref Google Scholar), NADH-cytochrome c reductase (EC 1.6.99.3)(10.Donaldson R.P. Tolbert N.E. Schnarrenberger C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 152: 199-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and palmitoyl-CoA-dependent NAD+ reduction (over all β-oxidation activity of peroxisomes) (11.Lazarow P.B. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 72: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) were assayed by the methods of the cited references. A unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes a formation of product or a decrease in substrate of 1 μmol/min at 37°C. Protein was determined by the method of Bradford(12.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213510) Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin was used as the standard.Identification of Reaction Products by High Performance Liquid ChromatographyFor identification of the reaction products, the UV-absorbing derivatives of aldehydes and carboxylic acids were prepared as previously described(13.Shaikh B. Pontzer N.J. Molina J.E. Kelsey M.I. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 85: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by addition of 0.5 ml of HCl to the assay mixture, and the products were extracted with 3 ml of diethyl ether by vigorous shaking in a sealed test tube. After centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min, the layer of diethyl ether was transferred into a reaction vial and dried up under nitrogen. To prepare the 4-nitrobenzyl oxime, the UV-absorbing derivative of aldehyde, 5 μmol of O-(4-nitrobenzyl)hydroxylamine hydrochloride (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) in 100 μl of methanol and 1 μl of triethylamine were added to the vial. Then it was sealed and heated for 1 h at 65°C. On the other hand, to prepare the 4-nitrobenzyl ester, the UV-absorbing derivative of carboxylic acid, 2.4 μmol of O-(4-nitrobenzyl)-N,N′-diisopropylisourea (Dojindo) in 100 μl of methylene chloride was added to the another vial. Then it was sealed and heated for 2 h at 80°C. After cooling, an aliquot of the each solution of derivatives was subjected to a column (4.6 mm × 25 cm) of TSK gel ODS-120T (Toyo Soda Manufacturing Co., Ltd.). Acetonitrile-water (70:30) was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The effluent from the column was monitored by a UV detector at a wavelength of 262 nm. 0.5 μmol of nonanal or nonanoic acid in 1 ml of 100 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, was used as a standard solution of aldehyde or carboxylic acid, respectively. Instead of the assay mixture, the standard solutions were treated in the same way as described above.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAlcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase activities with nonanol as substrate were determined in subcellular fractions from normal and clofibrate-treated rat livers (Table 1).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Clofibrate treatment resulted in the increase of the specific activity of the enzyme only in the light mitochondrial fraction (peroxisome-enriched fraction) but not in other fractions (Table 1).The result suggests that the enzyme is present in the peroxisomes of rat liver, because clofibrate treatment of rats is known to cause proliferation of the peroxisomes and increase of peroxisomal enzyme activities in liver(14.Lazo O. Contreras M. Singh I. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1991; 100: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).Fig. 1 shows the representative sedimentation profiles of the light mitochondrial fractions (peroxisome-enriched fractions) from normal and clofibrate-treated rat liver in a sucrose density gradient. The peroxisomes and mitochondria were separated; the peroxisomes, marked by catalase, was only at a density of about 1.25 g/ml, and the mitochondria, marked by glutamate dehydrogenase, only at a density of about 1.18 g/ml (Fig. 1A). Compared with normal rats, liver from clofibrate-treated rats showed a marked increase (about 10-fold) in the peroxisomal β-oxidation activity (palmitoyl-CoA-dependent NAD+ reduction) (Fig. 1B). These results show that liver peroxisomes proliferated in clofibrate-treated rats(15.Lazarow P.B. de Duve C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2043-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar, 16.Lazarow P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1522-1528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 1Subcellular distribution of alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase in normal and clofibrate-treated rat livers. The light mitochondrial fractions were prepared from livers of normal and clofibrate-treated rats and were separately subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described in the text. Fractions of 2.2 ml were collected from the bottom of each tube.

However, the treatment with clofibrate resulted in a marked increase (about 5-fold) of the peroxisomal enzyme activity with no effect on the mitochondrial one. These results clearly demonstrate that alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase is located in the peroxisomes of rat liver.To examine intraperoxisomal localization of alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase activity with nonanol as substrate, the light mitochondrial fraction was prepared from livers of clofibrate-treated rats. The light mitochondrial fraction, containing 60 μg of protein, was suspended in 20 mM glycylglycine, pH 7.5, containing 0.25 M sucrose and various concentrations (0-0.3 M) of KCl. After incubation at 4°C for 15 min, each suspension was centrifuged at 12,500 × g for 30 min and each resulting supernatant was assayed for unsedimentable activity. KCl (up to 0.3 M) did not solubilize any the catalase as the peroxisomal matrix marker or alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase activity, showing that alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase is not the peripheral membrane protein that is simply associated with peroxisomes by ionogenic interaction (data not shown).Next, the peroxisomal fractions prepared from livers of clofibrate-treated rats (Fig. 1C, fractions2-4) were combined and diluted with the same volume of 0.01 M pyrophosphate buffer, pH 10.5, which is known to break rat liver peroxisomes(17.Leighton F. Poole B. Lazarow P.B. de Duve C. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 41: 521-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). After being stored overnight at 4°C, about 6 ml of the suspension was subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described previously (10.Donaldson R.P. Tolbert N.E. Schnarrenberger C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 152: 199-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Catalase as the peroxisomal matrix marker was completely solubilized and recovered in the soluble top fraction, and NADH-cytochrome c reductase in the membrane is distributed over a broad density range with a peak of about 1.17 g × ml−1(10.Donaldson R.P. Tolbert N.E. Schnarrenberger C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 152: 199-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 18.Hsieh B. Tolbert N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 4408-4415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nearly all of the alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase activity was recovered in the soluble top fraction. These results show that alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase is located in the peroxisomal soluble matrix.Figure 2Intraperoxisomal localization of alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase. Peroxisomal fractions (fractions 2-4 in Fig. 1C), isolated on a sucrose density gradient, were diluted with the same volume of 0.01 M pyrophosphate butter, pH 10.5, which is known to break rat liver peroxisomes. After being stored overnight at 4°C, the suspension (about 6 ml) was layered on 28 ml of a sucrose gradient (30-56%, w/w) solution and centrifuged at 132,000 × g for 70 min. Fractions of 2.2 ml were collected from the bottom of the tube.

The solubilized fractions of the peroxisomes in Fig. 2(fractions 14-16) were combined and used as the peroxisomal alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase preparation. The reaction system contained 100 μl (0.1 milliunit) of the enzyme preparation in the standard assay mixture. After incubation at 37°C for 17 h, the products were extracted and converted to the appropriate derivatives as described under “Experimental Procedures”. The 4-nitrobenzyl derivatives of nonanal and nonanoic acid as the standards were separated on an ODS column; the 4-nitrobenzyl oxime, corresponding 30 nmol of nonanal, was at a retention time of about 12.7 min and the 4-nitrobenzyl ester, corresponding 10 nmol of nonanoic acid, was at a retention time of about 9.9 min (Fig. 3A). Most of the 4-nitrobenzyl derivative of the reaction product was associated with authentic 4-nitrobenzyl ester of nonanoic acid (Fig. 3B), whereas the only minor peak that was associated with authentic 4-nitrobenzyl oxime of nonanal was detected (Fig. 3C). When these samples were coinjected with authentic derivatives, an enhancement of each peaks was observed. Amounts of produced nonanoic acid and nonanal were estimated at 88.9 and 6.1 nmol, respectively. These results suggest that the nonanol as substrate was oxidized to nonanoic acid with nonanal as a possible intermediate by this reaction system.Figure 3Identification of the reaction products of alcohol:NAD+oxidoreductase by high performance liquid chromatography.

The same preparation of the enzyme in Fig. 2 was used. The Km values of the enzyme toward straight chain aliphatic alcohols decreased with increasing chain length. The enzyme has Km values in the millimolar range only for ethanol and in the micromolar range for longer chain length aliphatic alcohols (C4-C18) (Table 2). On the other hand, the enzyme showed high activities toward medium chain length aliphatic alcohols (C8-C13), showing the maximum activity on nonanol (C9). The enzyme showed low activities toward longer chain length (C14-C18) or shorter chain length (C2-C7) alcohols (Table 2). Methanol did not serve as the substrate even at the high concentration of 2 M. NADP did not serve as a cofactor in all experiments.Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Table 3 shows the effect of inhibitors (1 and 10 mM) on alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase activity of the same preparation in Table 2. The enzyme activity was strongly inhibited by cyanide and N -Ethylmaleimide. However the activity was not affected by addition of iodoacetate, pyrazole (inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase)(19.Theorell H. Yonenatani T. Sjöberg B. Acta Chem. Scand. 1969; 23: 255-260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or sodium azide (inhibitor of catalase) (20.Nicholls P. Biochem. J. 1964; 90: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) to the incubation mixture (Table 3).Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab In the present study, alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase was found to be present in the peroxisomes of rat liver. The enzyme was induced by the administration of a peroxisomal proliferator. The enzyme was NAD+-dependent and oxidized straight chain aliphatic alcohols of a variety of carbon chain (C2-C18) and not inhibited by sodium azide, an inhibitor of catalase (Table 3), showing that the enzyme differs from the peroxisomal catalase. Catalase, in addition to the decomposition of H2O2, can also catalyze the oxidation of short chain alcohols to corresponding aldehydes by the NAD+-independent peroxidatic activity, but cannot oxidize higher primary alcohol(5.Chance B. Oshino N. Biochem. J. 1971; 122: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Furthermore, peroxisomal alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase is also distinguishable from cytosolic alcohol dehydrogenase and microsomal alcohol-oxidizing systems as follows. 1) The peroxisomal enzyme is insensitive to pyrazole (Table 3), a potent inhibitor for cytosolic alcohol dehydrogenase(19.Theorell H. Yonenatani T. Sjöberg B. Acta Chem. Scand. 1969; 23: 255-260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2) The microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system catalyzes the NADP+-dependent oxidation(3.Thurman R.G. Ley H.G. Scholz R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 25: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). However the peroxisomal enzyme cannot utilize NADP+ as cofactor. 3) Recently, it has been reported that the alcohol oxidoreductase that can metabolize long chain aliphatic alcohols (C39-C18) to the corresponding fatty acids with NAD+ as cofactor is present in rat liver(21.Lee T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2892-2896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme is located in the microsomal fraction and named fatty alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase. However, the enzyme cannot oxidize ethanol(21.Lee T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2892-2896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We do not know whether the peroxisomal alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase is involved in ethanol metabolism in vivo or not. Two forms of alcohol dehydrogenase have been reported to be present in the cytosol of rat liver, designed class I and class III isozymes(22.Boleda M.D. Saubi N. Farrés J. Parés X. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 307: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 23.Boleda M.D. Julià P. Moreno A. Parés X. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Only class I isozyme is active with ethanol at the blood concentrations of this compound(22.Boleda M.D. Saubi N. Farrés J. Parés X. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 307: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 23.Boleda M.D. Julià P. Moreno A. Parés X. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Class I isozyme exhibits Km value of 1,400 μM for ethanol (22.Boleda M.D. Saubi N. Farrés J. Parés X. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 307: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 23.Boleda M.D. Julià P. Moreno A. Parés X. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) somewhat higher than that of the peroxisomal enzyme. This minor difference suggests a potential role for the peroxisomal activity in ethanol metabolism.On the other hand, the specific activity of the peroxisomal enzyme for octadecanol is nearly identical with that of rat liver microsomal fatty alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase (1.3 milliunits/mg microsomal protein)(21.Lee T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2892-2896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that alkyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate synthase is mainly localized in peroxisomes (24.Hajra A.K. Bishop J.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 386: 170-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The enzyme catalyzes the biosynthesis of ether lipids from acyl-dihydroxyacetone phosphate and fatty alcohol. These reports and the present data suggest a potential role for the peroxisomal activity in regulating the cellular levels of ether-linked lipids. Quantitative data on the physiological role of the peroxisomal alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase are required.Rizzo et al.(25.Rizzo W.B. Craft D.A. Dammann A.L. Phillips M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17412-17419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that a fatty alcohol cycle is present in human skin fibroblasts. In this cycle, fatty acyl-CoA is converted to the corresponding alcohols by acyl-CoA reductase and generated fatty alcohol is converted to the corresponding fatty acid by fatty alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase. Sjögren-Larsson syndrome, a metabolic disease characterized by abnormal accumulation of fatty alcohols in skin fibroblasts, congenital ichthyosis, and mental retardation, is caused by a defect of fatty alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase in this cycle(26.Rizzo W.B. Dammann A.L. Craft D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 738-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 27.Rizzo W.B. Craft D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Fatty alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase activity has been reported to be associated with the particulate fraction of skin fibroblasts homogenate(27.Rizzo W.B. Craft D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It is of interest whether this disease is caused by disorder of the peroxisomes or not. INTRODUCTIONThree separate enzymes have been reported to be involved in conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde in mammalian liver. 1) The most widely known is the NAD+-linked cytosolic alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1), which catalyzes the reversible interconversion of a wide variety of alcohols and their corresponding aldehydes(1.Branden C.-I.

Biochemistry and Pharmacology of Ethanol. 1. Plenum Press, New York1979: 87-106Crossref Google Scholar). 2) A mixed function oxidase (EC 1.6.2.4, 1.14.14.1), known as the microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system, catalyzes the NADPH and oxygen-dependent oxidation of short chain alcohols to corresponding aldehydes(3.Thurman R.G.

Three separate enzymes have been reported to be involved in conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde in mammalian liver. 1) The most widely known is the NAD+-linked cytosolic alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1), which catalyzes the reversible interconversion of a wide variety of alcohols and their corresponding aldehydes(1.Branden C.-I.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimalsThirty-day-old male rats (body weight, 100-110 g) of the Wistar strain were maintained ad libitum on either a normal diet (Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) or a normal diet supplemented with clofibrate (0.3%, v/w) for 3 weeks.Subcellular Fractionation of Rat Liver by Differential CentrifugationAll procedures were carried out at 0−4°C. Rat livers were cut into small pieces with scissors and homogenized by one excursion in nine volumes of 0.25 M sucrose in 20 mM glycylglycine, pH 7.5, in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer with a Teflon pestle at 600 rpm. The homogenate was filtered through two layers of cheesecloth and subjected to differential centrifugation to obtain heavy mitochondrial, light mitochondrial, microsomal, and soluble fractions as described by de Duve et al.(6.de Duve C.

Uracil residues may be introduced into DNA by the incorporation of dUMP during DNA synthesis or by the deamination of cytosine in DNA. In vivo cytosine deamination occurs at a genetically significant rate to produce a premutagenic U•G mispair(1.Lindahl T. Nyberg B.

Uracil-DNA glycosylase initiates repair by cleaving the N-glycosylic bond between uracil and deoxyribose in DNA to yield free uracil and an abasic site(4.Lindahl T. Ljunquist S. Siegert W. Nyberg B. Sperens B. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3286-3294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The abasic sites induced by the action of uracil-DNA glycosylase cause changes in the structure, dynamics, and chemical stability of DNA (5.Goljer I. Withka J.M. Kao J.Y. Bolton P.H.

The ubiquitous uracil-DNA glycosylase enzyme has been highly conserved throughout evolution as evidenced by the significant amino acid similarity, 55.7% identical residues, between human and bacterial forms of uracil-DNA glycosylase(12.Upton C.

Further, extracts of both E. coli and human cell lines have been shown to generate one nucleotide repair patches following excision of uracil from DNA, suggesting that the entire excision repair pathway itself may be highly conserved(16.Dianov G.

Interestingly, the genomes of several mammalian viruses have been reported to encode uracil-DNA glycosylase(12.Upton C. Stuart D.T. McFadden G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The function of these viral uracil-DNA glycosylases remains to be fully understood. However, recent evidence suggests that the viral enzyme plays a key role in viral replication and reactivation since viral uracil-DNA glycosylase activity is rapidly induced following both herpes simplex virus and pox virus infection(21.Stuart D.T. Upton D.C. Higman M.A. Niles E.G. McFadden G. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Carradonna S.J. Cheng Y. J. Biol.

J. 1993; 292: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In adult neurons mammalian uracil-DNA glycosylase activity was reportedly undetectable; thus, uracil residues may accumulate either by the oxidative deamination of cytosine or by the misincorporation of dUMP in place of dTMP during DNA repair synthesis(24.Focher F. Verri A. Verzeletti S. Mazzarello P. Spadari S. Chromosoma. 1992; 102: S67-S71Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). When a nerve cell is attacked by herpes simplex, pox, vaccinia, or pseudorabies virus, there is often a long latency period. During this period the genome of the virus can acquire uracil residues if host uracil-DNA repair is absent(24.Focher F. Verri A. Verzeletti S. Mazzarello P. Spadari S. Chromosoma. 1992; 102: S67-S71Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Further, uracil residues located in the herpes simplex 1 origin of replication (Oris) hamper specific recognition by the origin binding protein(24.Focher F. Verri A. Verzeletti S. Mazzarello P. Spadari S. Chromosoma. 1992; 102: S67-S71Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and inactivation of the vaccinia and pox virus-encoded uracil-DNA glycosylase gene eliminates viral viability(20.Klupp B.G. Baumeister J. Karger A. Visser N. Mettenleiter T.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3868-3878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Millins A.K. Carpenter M.S. DeLange A.M. Virology. 1994; 198: 504-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, uracil-DNA glycosylase plays an important role in the DNA metabolism of most biological systems, including virus. Bacillus subtilis bacteriophages PBS 1 and 2 are unusual biological systems in that their double-stranded DNA genome contains uracil in place of thymine(26.Takahashi I. Marmur J. Nature. 1963; 197: 794-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Upon infection of the host, phage-induced activities cause depletion of the dTTP pool concomitant with dramatic elevation of the dUTP pool, thereby facilitating the incorporation of dUMP into phage DNA during replication(27.Price A.R. Frato J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8804-8811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Hitzeman R.A. Price A.R. J. Biol.

However, uracil-containing DNA synthesized under conditions of PBS infection must be protected from the B. subtilis uracil-DNA glycosylase to avoid uracil-DNA degradation. This is accomplished by expression of the PBS 2 ugi gene product which directly inactivates the host uracil-DNA glycosylase(29.Friedberg E.C. Ganesan A.K. Minton K. J. Virol. 1975; 16: 315-321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Karran P. Cone R. Friedberg E.C. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6092-6096Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The ugi gene from bacteriophage PBS 2 has been cloned, sequenced, and overexpressed in E. coli, and the purified Ugi protein has been characterized(31.Wang Z. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1082-1091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Wang Z. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1163-1171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ugi is an acidic protein with a pI of 4.2(33.Bennett S.E. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22512-22521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is a heat stable, nonglobular monomeric protein of 84 amino acid residues that exhibits anomalous migration during SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis(32.Wang Z. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1163-1171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Bennett S.E. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22512-22521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Cone R.

The Ugi protein has been shown to inactivate Ung by forming an extremely stable Ung•Ugi complex with 1:1 stoichiometry(33.Bennett S.E. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22512-22521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Ugi inactivates other uracil-DNA glycosylase including those isolated from Micrococcus luteus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, rat liver, and human cells(30.Karran P. Cone R. Friedberg E.C. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6092-6096Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 32.Wang Z. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1163-1171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Cone R. Duncan J. Hamilton L. Friedberg E.C. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3194-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Ung occurs in a noncompetitive manner with respect to the uracil-DNA substrate(35.Wang Z. Smith D.G. Mosbaugh D.W. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 99: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies have shown that the interaction of Ugi with Ung occurs by way of a two-stage mechanism involving a rapid pre-equilibrium “docking” step, followed by a rearrangement or “locking” step that leads irreversibly to the final complex(36.Bennett S.E. Schimerlik M.I. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26879-26885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that Ugi binds Ung at or near the DNA binding site of the enzyme. Ugi binding to Ung prevents enzyme association with DNA (33.Bennett S.E. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22512-22521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ung that has been UV-cross-linked to the DNA oligonucleotide dT 20 at the enzyme DNA binding site fails to form a complex with Ugi; and Ung complexed with Ugi does not UV-cross-link to dT 20(37.Bennett S.E. Jensen O.N. Barofsky D.F. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21870-21879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The high percentage of negatively charged amino acids, 12 Glu + 6 Asp out of 84 residues, further suggests that Ugi may act as a DNA mimic in binding to Ung. Such mimicry may provide an explanation as to how the Ugi protein from PBS is capable of inactivating uracil-DNA glycosylase from diverse biological systems that are under no selective pressure to maintain a Ugi binding site. Additional understanding of the Ung•Ugi complex requires elucidation of the individual protein structures as well as that of the complex. In this article we report on the determination of the secondary structure of Ugi by multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) utilizing isotopically labeled protein. The Ugi secondary structure contains five antiparallel β sheets, that form a contiguous structure with one another, and two helices. The information gained from the secondary structure allows assessment of the regions of Ugi likely to be involved in binding to Ung. E. coli JM105 transformed with pZWtac1 was grown at 37°C in 10 liters of M9 medium in which [15N]ammonium chloride (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) was the sole nitrogen source. The [15N]M9 medium was supplemented with 10 μg/ml thiamine and 0.01% ampicillin. When the culture density reached ∼7.5 × 108 cells/ml, isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside was added to 1 mM to induce ugi gene expression. Following 3 h of additional growth, cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellets were stored at −80°C. A cellular extract was obtained subsequent to sonification and centrifugation; purification of [15N]Ugi was performed essentially as described by Wang et al.(35.Wang Z. Smith D.G. Mosbaugh D.W. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 99: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The DEAE-cellulose chromatography step was carried out using a 19.6 cm2× 12-cm column. Purified Ugi was concentrated ∼12-fold under 55 p.s.i. of prepurified N2 in an Amicon stirred cell equipped with a YM10 25-mm diameter DIAFLO membrane (Amicon). Diafiltration was then conducted with 200 ml of NMR buffer (see below). The sample was further concentrated to 3 mM [15N]Ugi under a stream of nitrogen and contained 25 mM deuterated Tris, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM EGTA, and 100 mM NaCl at pH 7.0. The Ugi preparation was >95%15N-labeled based on the NMR results. All of the NMR spectra were obtained using a Varian Unityplus 400 spectrometer equipped with a Nalorac ID400 probe. The HSQC spectrum of the labeled Ugi was obtained in the usual fashion and a typical result is shown in Fig. 1. The data were collected with 256 increments of the evolution time and processed with a shifted Gaussian in both dimensions. Three-dimensional NOESY-HMQC and TOCSY-HSQC spectra were also obtained for Ugi. The TOCSY-HSQC data was used to group the resonances into spin systems with typical data shown in Fig. 2. The data were collected with eight transients per increment and obtained by the States-Haberkorn method along each indirectly detected dimension. There were 128 increments of t1 and 24 increments of t2 for each of the complex data sets. The data was linear predicted to 256 points along t1 and 48 points along t2. The data were Fourier transformed into 512 × 128 × 1024 points using shifted Gaussians along each dimension. The TOCSY-HSQC data was obtained using the sensitivity enhancement feature(38.Palmer A.G. Cavanagh J. Byrd R.A. Rance M. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 96: 416-424Google Scholar). Fig. 3 contains some of the NOESY-HMQC data used to make sequential assignments in one of the helices and one of the β-sheet regions of the protein. The data was collected with 16 transients per increment and obtained by the States-Haberkorn method along each indirectly detection dimension. There were 128 increments of t1 and 20 increments of t2 for each of the complex data sets. The data were linear predicted to 256 points along t1 and 40 points along t2. The data were Fourier transformed into 512 × 128 × 1024 points using shifted Gaussians along each dimension. Conventional DQCOSY, NOESY, and TOCSY spectra were also obtained on the sample. The chemical shift differences of the C αH protons relative to the random coil, unshifted positions were also determined and reported in Fig. 4.Figure 2The spectra shown are taken from a three-dimensional TOCSY-HSQC data set obtained on Ugi.

The NMR properties of the protein did not change significantly over this temperature range. The NMR properties of the protein did not change significantly over the pH range of 5.5 to 8. The amide protons exchange sufficiently slowly with water at pH 7 to allow the NMR experiments to be carried out a this pH. The exchange rates of the amide protons were determined at pH 7.0 and 20°C by observing the rate of loss of intensity of cross-peaks in the two-dimensional HMQC spectrum as a function of time after the Ugi has been transferred from a H2O solution to a 2H2O solution. The amide protons with the slowest exchange rates are indicated in Fig. 4. The characterization of Ugi began with the determination that this protein adopts a single well defined structure in solution. The HSQC spectrum in Fig. 1 contains cross-peaks whose coordinates are the chemical shifts of the amide nitrogen and amide proton of the non-proline residues. (Chemical shifts of all proton and nitrogen resonances are given in Table 1.) The cross-peaks arising from the NH2 of glutamine and asparagine also appear in this region but are much broader than the cross-peaks from amides. The examination of this spectrum shows that the protein adopts a defined structure since there is a wide dispersion of the chemical shifts along both the nitrogen and proton dimensions. The presence of a number of resonances with proton chemical shifts between 8 and 10 ppm suggests that the protein has a significant percentage of the residues in β-strands.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Many proteins are investigated by NMR at low pH since the crucial amide protons undergo rapid base-catalyzed exchange with the bulk water at neutral pH. It was found that the amide protons of Ugi exchange sufficiently slowly with water at pH 7.0 to allow the NMR experiments to be carried out successfully. This slow rate of amide exchange is also indicative of a highly structured protein. Examination of the spectrum indicated that only one structural form of the protein was present in solution, as there is one cross-peak for the amide of each non-proline residue in the protein. These NMR results indicated that Ugi had a well defined, single structure in solution and that it was well suited for NMR structural studies based on multidimensional NMR and sequential assignment strategies. The next step in the structural characterization was the determination of the chemical shifts of the C αH protons. The resonances of these protons were ascertained from the information present in a DQCOSY spectrum of the proton. The DQCOSY data, not shown, contains cross-peaks between the amide and alpha protons, and makes it possible to distinguish resonances in the HSQC spectrum of amide protons from those of the amino protons of glutamine and asparagine residues. Once determined, the resonances of the amide and α protons were combined with the results of three-dimensional TOCSY-HSQC data to identify the spin systems(39.LeMaster D.M. Prog. NMR Spectroscopy. 1994; 26: 371-419Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 40.W ü thrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar, 41.Wüthrich K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22059-22062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These experiments allow the connection of the α protons to the other protons of the same residue via spin-spin and scalar couplings, and hence allow the classification of groups of resonances to a residue of a particular spin system type. Typical TOCSY-HSQC data is shown in Fig. 2. The sequential assignments of the individual spin systems were based primarily on the information present in the three-dimensional NOESY-HMQC data. From this information the sequential connectivities from amide proton of residue i to amide proton of residue i - 1, the amide proton of residue i + 1 as well as from the amide proton of residue i to C αH proton of residue i - 1 were determined(39.LeMaster D.M.

The spectra containing the sequential connectivities used to assign the resonances of residues in the long helix are shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 also contains the set of spectra used to make the sequential assignments in one of the β-strand regions. The sequential NOE connectivities of all of the residues are indicated in Fig. 4. All of the non-proline residues were assigned except for the terminal residues 1 through 4. Characterization of the secondary structural elements of Ugi was based on several pieces of information. The helices were identified primarily on the basis of strong NOE connectivities between the NH of residue i and the NH of residue i + 1 and residue i - 1. The helices were also characterized by the presence of weak to medium connectivities from the NH proton of residue i to the NH proton of residue i + 3 and weak NOE connectivities between the C αH of residue i and the NH proton of residues i + 2 and i + 3. These NOE connectivities are depicted in Fig. 4 and allowed the identification of the presence of two α-helices in the secondary structure. One of these helices is from residue 5 to residue 14 and the other helix is from residue 27 to residue 35. In general, downfield shifts, positive differences, correlate with β-sheets and upfield shifts, negative differences, correlate with alpha helices(42.Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar). The chemical shift differences of the C αH protons relative to the random coil, unshifted positions are also given in Fig. 4. In the two regions of Ugi assigned to α-helices the expected negative differences between the observed chemical shifts and the random coil chemical shifts are found. The presence of five β-strand regions in the secondary structure of Ugi was determined primarily on the basis of the presence of strong NOE connectivities between the C αH proton of residue i and the amide proton of residue i + 1, strong connectivities between the C βH proton of residue i and the amide proton of residue i + 1, and by the fact that the amide protons of residues in β-strands tend to exchange more slowly with water. The β-strands are from residues 20-24, 41-48, 53-60, 69-74, and 79-84. The characteristic NOE connectivities of the β-strand regions suggested that they are all anti-parallel(40.W ü thrich K.

Robein M.A. Gronenborn A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 82-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This information is summarized in Fig. 4. The chemical shift differences of the C αH protons of the β-strands are expected to exhibit positive differences relative to the random coil, unshifted positions. The experimental results, summarized in Fig. 4, are in agreement with this expectation. Indeed, grouping resonances to spin system type, sequential assignments, NOE connectivities, amide exchange rates, and differences in chemical shift relative to the random coil, unshifted positions are all consistent with each other and the secondary structure assignments. The determination of the arrangements of the β-strands relative to one other was based on the information present in NOE connectivities between CαH and CαH protons on separate β-strands. These NOEs appear at every other site along a β-strand, and are indicated in the depiction of the β-strands in Fig. 5 and in the depiction of the entire secondary structure in Fig. 6. These connections allowed the arrangement of the five β-strands in a connected anti-parallel manner that is shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6.Figure 6A depiction of the overall secondary structure of Ugi.

Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7272-7281Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and the RAS binding domain of human RAF-1(45.Emerson S.D. Waugh D.S. Scheffler J.E. Tsao K.-L. Prinzo K.M. Fry D.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7745-7752Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Both of these proteins contain five anti-parallel β-strands and a single helix, and they are very stable proteins, presumably because of the high β-content of the structures(44.DiStefano D.L. Wand J.H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7272-7281Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 45.Emerson S.D. Waugh D.S. Scheffler J.E. Tsao K.-L. Prinzo K.M. Fry D.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7745-7752Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In ubiquitin and the RAS binding domain, the helix is between the first and fourth β-strands; whereas in Ugi the intervening helix is between the first and second β-strands. The somewhat unusual feature of the β-strands in Ugi is that they are connected sequentially. The secondary structure has six loop or turn regions in which one half of the 18 acidic amino acid residues of the protein are found. The regions from residues 36-40, 49-52, and 61-68 contain six acidic groups, two each, whereas the region 75-78 contains one acidic group; other regions constituting loops or turns are residues 15-19, 25, and 26. The anomalous electrophoretic mobility of Ugi may arise, in part, from the presence of these acidic groups in regions of the protein not involved in the secondary structure. The biological function of Ugi is to inhibit uracil-DNA glycosylase, a DNA repair enzyme that binds single- and double-stranded DNA, recognizes uracil residues, and then catalyzes the hydrolysis of the N-glycosylic bond between the uracil base and the deoxyribose-phosphate “backbone” of DNA. Ugi and Ung react to form a stable protein-protein complex that does not interact with DNA. Thus, Ung may recognize Ugi because the inhibitor protein mimics in some fashion the general properties of its DNA substrate. The secondary structure of Ugi can reveal which regions and residues may be critical to the interaction with Ung. If Ugi is to mimic DNA, then it should have a number of acidic groups which can mimic the electrostatic potential of the phosphate groups in DNA. The secondary structure has eight acidic groups that may be available for this role. The regions 36-40, 49-52, and 61-68 are prime candidates for this activity since these regions are not involved in the secondary structure and contain six of the 18 acidic residues present. While the tertiary structure of the β-strands is not yet known, it may be the case that a barrel type structure is formed in which these negative changes are distributed in a manner similar to the arrangement of the negative changes of DNA, and thus may act as the primary binding site of Ugi to uracil-DNA glycosylase. It is noted that amino acids 49-52 contains the sequence Glu49-Ser50-Thr51-Asp52 and that the serine and threonine residues may serve as hydrogen bond donors in complex formation. It is also possible that residues 75-78 are involved in complex formation as this region contains the sequence Ser75-Gln76-Gly77-Glu78. The serine and glutamine residues offer hydrogen bonding opportunities and the glutamic acid a negative charge. The helix from residues 27 to 35 has a distinctly charged side and a hydrophobic side; however, the helix from 5 to 13 does not appear to have as significant a difference between its two sides. While either or both of these helices could be involved in complex formation, the secondary structure does not make a clear prediction as to what that role(s) might be. The β-strand regions of proteins are typically not involved directly in the activity of proteins. Hence, the β-strand regions of Ugi are likely to be important structurally but are not expected to play significant roles in the interaction with uracil-DNA glycosylase. Based on the secondary structure of the β-strands shown in Fig. 5, no specific pattern in the arrangement of the acidic or other types of residues can be inferred. Ugi contains only three aromatic residues and of these Tyr65 and Trp68 are not present in a secondary structural feature. If Ugi binds to the uracil binding site of uracil-DNA glycosylase, then it is possible that an aromatic residue may occupy that site. The Tyr65 and Trp68 are the only residues apparently available for this role. The tertiary structure of Ugi in solution is now being determined in order to gain information concerning the arrangement of negative charges and other features of Ugi which may be important to the interaction with uracil-DNA glycosylase. Additional studies are planned which will examine the changes in the amide exchange rates and chemical shifts of the amide nitrogen and protons, as well changes in the mobility of the amide nitrogens which may occur when Ugi is complexed with uracil-DNA glycosylase. These studies should offer information about the regions of Ugi which directly interact with uracil-DNA glycosylase. Preliminary results on the complex indicate that the structure of Ugi undergoes considerable change upon complex formation. This is consistent with kinetic results which indicated the presence of a slow, locking step in complex formation(36.Bennett S.E. Schimerlik M.I. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26879-26885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We appreciate the assistance of Dr. Igor Goljer in performing some of the 400 MHz NMR experiments."
