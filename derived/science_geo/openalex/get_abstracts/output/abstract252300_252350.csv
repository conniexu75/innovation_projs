https://openalex.org/W2150104440,"When performing tasks, humans are thought to adopt task sets that configure moment-to-moment data processing. Recently developed mixed blocked/event-related designs allow task set-related signals to be extracted in fMRI experiments, including activity related to cues that signal the beginning of a task block, ""set-maintenance"" activity sustained for the duration of a task block, and event-related signals for different trial types. Data were conjointly analyzed from mixed design experiments using ten different tasks and 183 subjects. Dorsal anterior cingulate cortex/medial superior frontal cortex (dACC/msFC) and bilateral anterior insula/frontal operculum (aI/fO) showed reliable start-cue and sustained activations across all or nearly all tasks. These regions also carried the most reliable error-related signals in a subset of tasks, suggesting that the regions form a ""core"" task-set system. Prefrontal regions commonly related to task control carried task-set signals in a smaller subset of tasks and lacked convergence across signal types."

But the truly transformative power of imaging in the clinical management of cancer patients lies ahead. Today, imaging is at a crossroads, with molecularly targeted imaging agents expected to broadly expand the capabilities of conventional anatomical imaging methods. Molecular imaging will allow clinicians to not only see where a tumor is located in the body, but also to visualize the expression and activity of specific molecules (e.g., proteases and protein kinases) and biological processes (e.g., apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis) that influence tumor behavior and/or response to therapy. This information is expected to have a major impact on cancer detection, individualized treatment, and drug development, as well as our understanding of how cancer arises."

Two report on BPTF (bromodomain and PHD domain transcription factor), a subunit of NURF, the nucleosome remodelling factor. It contains a domain known as a PHD finger, which is shown to bind to histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4) and to maintain proper activity at developmentally critical HOX genes. The accompanying structural study of the complex explains how the site specificity for H3K4 is achieved. The two other papers reveal that the PHD domain of tumour suppressor ING2 also recognizes trimethylated H3K4, and link the histone mark to repression of transcription. The four papers together establish certain PHD finger domains as previously unrecognized chromatin-binding modules. In a News and Views piece, Peter B. Becker discusses what these papers tell us about the function of the chemical modifications of histone tails. One of four papers establishing certain PHD domains as effectors of trimethylated histone H3K4, a chromatin mark generally associated with active transcription. The interaction between H3K4me3 and the ING2 PHD domain is enhanced after DNA damage, recruiting the repressive complex to the promoters of proliferation genes. Dynamic regulation of diverse nuclear processes is intimately linked to covalent modifications of chromatin1,2. Much attention has focused on methylation at lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4), owing to its association with euchromatic genomic regions3,4. H3K4 can be mono-, di- or tri-methylated. Trimethylated H3K4 (H3K4me3) is preferentially detected at active genes, and is proposed to promote gene expression through recognition by transcription-activating effector molecules5. Here we identify a novel class of methylated H3K4 effector domains—the PHD domains of the ING (for inhibitor of growth) family of tumour suppressor proteins. The ING PHD domains are specific and highly robust binding modules for H3K4me3 and H3K4me2. ING2, a native subunit of a repressive mSin3a–HDAC1 histone deacetylase complex6, binds with high affinity to the trimethylated species. In response to DNA damage, recognition of H3K4me3 by the ING2 PHD domain stabilizes the mSin3a–HDAC1 complex at the promoters of proliferation genes. This pathway constitutes a new mechanism by which H3K4me3 functions in active gene repression. Furthermore, ING2 modulates cellular responses to genotoxic insults, and these functions are critically dependent on ING2 interaction with H3K4me3. Together, our findings establish a pivotal role for trimethylation of H3K4 in gene repression and, potentially, tumour suppressor mechanisms."

Though crystal structures for partial Env subunits are known, the structure and distribution of native Env spikes on virions is obscure. We applied cryoelectron microscopy tomography to define ultrastructural details of spikes. Virions of wild-type human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) and a mutant simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) had approximately 14 and approximately 73 spikes per particle, respectively, with some clustering of HIV-1 spikes. Three-dimensional averaging showed that the surface glycoprotein (gp120) 'head' of each subunit of the trimeric SIV spike contains a primary mass, with two secondary lobes. The transmembrane glycoprotein 'stalk' of each trimer is composed of three independent legs that project obliquely from the trimer head, tripod-like. Reconciling available atomic structures with the three-dimensional whole spike density map yields insights into the orientation of Env spike structural elements and possible structural bases of their functions."

One of four papers establishing certain PHD domains as effectors of trimethylated histone H3K4, a chromatin mark generally associated with active transcription. This paper provides structural insight into the recognition of H3K4me3 by the PHD finger of BPTF, a subunit of the chromatin-remodelling complex NURF. Mono-, di- and trimethylated states of particular histone lysine residues are selectively found in different regions of chromatin, thereby implying specialized biological functions for these marks ranging from heterochromatin formation to X-chromosome inactivation and transcriptional regulation1,2,3. A major challenge in chromatin biology has centred on efforts to define the connection between specific methylation states and distinct biological read-outs impacting on function4. For example, histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) is associated with transcription start sites of active genes5,6,7, but the molecular ‘effectors’ involved in specific recognition of H3K4me3 tails remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate the molecular basis for specific recognition of H3(1–15)K4me3 (residues 1–15 of histone H3 trimethylated at K4) by a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger of human BPTF (bromodomain and PHD domain transcription factor), the largest subunit of the ATP-dependent chromatin-remodelling complex, NURF (nucleosome remodelling factor). We report on crystallographic and NMR structures of the bromodomain-proximal PHD finger of BPTF in free and H3(1–15)K4me3-bound states. H3(1–15)K4me3 interacts through anti-parallel β-sheet formation on the surface of the PHD finger, with the long side chains of arginine 2 (R2) and K4me3 fitting snugly in adjacent pre-formed surface pockets, and bracketing an invariant tryptophan. The observed stapling role by non-adjacent R2 and K4me3 provides a molecular explanation for H3K4me3 site specificity. Binding studies establish that the BPTF PHD finger exhibits a modest preference for K4me3- over K4me2-containing H3 peptides, and discriminates against monomethylated and unmodified counterparts. Furthermore, we identified key specificity-determining residues from binding studies of H3(1–15)K4me3 with PHD finger point mutants. Our findings call attention to the PHD finger as a previously uncharacterized chromatin-binding module found in a large number of chromatin-associated proteins."

One of four papers establishing certain PHD domains as effectors of trimethylated histone H3K4, a chromatin mark generally associated with active transcription. This paper describes the structure of the PHD finger from the tumour suppressor ING2 complexed with H3K4me3. Covalent modifications of histone tails have a key role in regulating chromatin structure and controlling transcriptional activity. In eukaryotes, histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) is associated with active chromatin and gene expression1,2,3,4. We recently found that plant homeodomain (PHD) finger of tumour suppressor ING2 (inhibitor of growth 2) binds H3K4me3 and represents a new family of modules that target this epigenetic mark5. The molecular mechanism of H3K4me3 recognition, however, remains unknown. Here we report a 2.0 Å resolution structure of the mouse ING2 PHD finger in complex with a histone H3 peptide trimethylated at lysine 4. The H3K4me3 tail is bound in an extended conformation in a deep and extensive binding site consisting of elements that are conserved among the ING family of proteins. The trimethylammonium group of Lys 4 is recognized by the aromatic side chains of Y215 and W238 residues, whereas the intermolecular hydrogen-bonding and complementary surface interactions, involving Ala 1, Arg 2, Thr 3 and Thr 6 of the peptide, account for the PHD finger's high specificity and affinity. Substitution of the binding site residues disrupts H3K4me3 interaction in vitro and impairs the ability of ING2 to induce apoptosis in vivo. Strong binding of other ING and YNG PHD fingers suggests that the recognition of H3K4me3 histone code is a general feature of the ING/YNG proteins. Elucidation of the mechanisms underlying this novel function of PHD fingers provides a basis for deciphering the role of the ING family of tumour suppressors in chromatin regulation and signalling."

The effector YopJ inhibits mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the nuclear factor κB (NFκB) signaling pathways used in innate immune response by preventing activation of the family of MAPK kinases (MAPKK). We show that YopJ acted as an acetyltransferase, using acetyl–coenzyme A (CoA) to modify the critical serine and threonine residues in the activation loop of MAPKK6 and thereby blocking phosphorylation. The acetylation on MAPKK6 directly competed with phosphorylation, preventing activation of the modified protein. This covalent modification may be used as a general regulatory mechanism in biological signaling."

Combining chip-based technologies with genealogy data, we identified germline mutations in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein ( AIP ) gene in individuals with pituitary adenoma predisposition (PAP). AIP acts in cytoplasmic retention of the latent form of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and also has other functions. In a population-based series from Northern Finland, two AIP mutations account for 16% of all patients diagnosed with pituitary adenomas secreting growth hormone and for 40% of the subset of patients who were diagnosed when they were younger than 35 years of age. Typically, PAP patients do not display a strong family history of pituitary adenoma; thus, AIP is an example of a low-penetrance tumor susceptibility gene."

These underlying processes can be revealed in the statistics of the discrete changes. Through ultraprecise nanoscale measurements on nickel microcrystals, we directly determined the size of discrete slip events. The sizes ranged over nearly three orders of magnitude and exhibited a shock-and-aftershock, earthquake-like behavior over time. Analysis of the events reveals power-law scaling between the number of events and their magnitude, or scale-free flow. We show that dislocated crystals are a model system for studying scale-free behavior as observed in many macroscopic systems. In analogy to plate tectonics, smooth macroscopic-scale crystalline glide arises from the spatial and time averages of disruptive earthquake-like events at the nanometer scale."

The results of recent clinical trials indicate that certain antiangiogenic drugs may produce this long-sought effect. Here, I describe three distinct mechanisms that may help to explain the chemosensitizing activity of these drugs: normalizing tumor vasculature, preventing rapid tumor cell repopulation, and augmenting the antivascular effects of chemotherapy. I then discuss how these potential mechanisms might be exploited to maximize therapeutic efficacy."

Efforts are now being directed at identifying the tumor subtypes and patients who will benefit the most from these drugs. In addition, new compounds that circumvent acquired resistance to the first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors are being tested in patients with refractory disease.

We found that relative to the global-mean trends of the respective layers, both hemispheres have experienced enhanced tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling in the 15 to 45° latitude belt, which is a pattern indicative of a widening of the tropical circulation and a poleward shift of the tropospheric jet streams and their associated subtropical dry zones.

https://openalex.org/W1553587640,"We describe a pathogenetic mechanism underlying a variant form of the inherited blood disorder α thalassemia. Association studies of affected individuals from Melanesia localized the disease trait to the telomeric region of human chromosome 16, which includes the α-globin gene cluster, but no molecular defects were detected by conventional approaches. After resequencing and using a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation and expression analysis on a tiled oligonucleotide array, we identified a gain-of-function regulatory single-nucleotide polymorphism (rSNP) in a nongenic region between the α-globin genes and their upstream regulatory elements. The rSNP creates a new promoterlike element that interferes with normal activation of all downstream α-like globin genes. Thus, our work illustrates a strategy for distinguishing between neutral and functionally important rSNPs, and it also identifies a pathogenetic mechanism that could potentially underlie other genetic diseases."

We studied glucose inhibition of orexin/hypocretin neurons, which promote wakefulness (their loss causes narcolepsy) and also regulate metabolism and reward. Here we demonstrate that their inhibition by glucose is mediated by ion channels not previously implicated in central or peripheral glucose sensing: tandem-pore K+ (K2P) channels. Importantly, we show that this electrical mechanism is sufficiently sensitive to encode variations in glucose levels reflecting those occurring physiologically between normal meals. Moreover, we provide evidence that glucose acts at an extracellular site on orexin neurons, and this information is transmitted to the channels by an intracellular intermediary that is not ATP, Ca2+, or glucose itself.

Mice lacking Shn3 display adult-onset osteosclerosis with increased bone mass due to augmented osteoblast activity. Shn3 was found to control protein levels of Runx2, the principal transcriptional regulator of osteoblast differentiation, by promoting its degradation through recruitment of the E3 ubiquitin ligase WWP1 to Runx2. By this means, Runx2-mediated extracellular matrix mineralization was antagonized, revealing an essential role for Shn3 as a central regulator of postnatal bone mass."

We stimulated the frontal eye field (FEF) of passively fixating monkeys and produced changes in V4 responses similar to known effects of voluntary attention. Subthreshold FEF stimulation enhanced visual responses at particular locations within the RF and altered the interaction between pairs of RF stimuli to favor those aligned with the activated FEF site. Thus, we could influence which stimulus drove the responses of individual V4 neurons. These results suggest that spatial signals involved in saccade preparation are used to covertly select among multiple stimuli appearing within the RFs of visual cortical neurons."

In a genome-wide scan for association of 65 loci with latitude, there was an excess of significant P values, indicative of population structure. Nevertheless, PHYC was the most strongly associated locus across 163 strains, suggesting that PHYC alleles are under diversifying selection in A. thaliana.

https://openalex.org/W2151811471,"Making optimal decisions in the face of uncertain or incomplete information arises as a common problem in everyday behavior, but the neural processes underlying this ability remain poorly understood. A typical case is navigation, in which a subject has to search for a known goal from an unknown location. Navigating under uncertain conditions requires making decisions on the basis of the current belief about location and updating that belief based on incoming information. Here, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging during a maze navigation task to study neural activity relating to the resolution of uncertainty as subjects make sequential decisions to reach a goal. We show that distinct regions of prefrontal cortex are engaged in specific computational functions that are well described by a Bayesian model of decision making.

We show that distinct regions of prefrontal cortex are engaged in specific computational functions that are well described by a Bayesian model of decision making. This permits efficient goal-oriented navigation and provides new insights into decision making by humans. Surviving in a complex environment depends critically on the ability to make planned, often sequential decisions to realize future goals. The information needed to make these decisions is often uncertain, however, posing a major challenge to the animal. One of the least understood sources of uncertainty is that associated with the identity or nature of the current state. This occurs commonly in navigation tasks (Stankiewicz et al., 2006Stankiewicz B.J. Legge G.E. Mansfield J.S. Schlicht E.J. Lost in virtual space: Studies in human and ideal spatial navigation.J. Exp. Psychol. Hum. Percept. Perform. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). For example, if we are trying to find our way back to our hotel in an unfamiliar city, decisions may be difficult because we don't know with certainty where we are—not because we lack the ability to plan routes. These situations are referred to as partially observable decision-making problems (Cassandra et al., 1994Cassandra, A.R., Kaelbling, L.P., and Littman, M.L. (1994). Acting optimally in partially observable stochastic domains. In Proceedings of the Twelfth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Volume 2 (Seattle, WA: AAAI Press/MIT Press), pp. 1023–1028.Google Scholar). Despite considerable recent interests in the neural basis of decision making (Sugrue et al., 2005Sugrue L.P. Corrado G.S. Newsome W.T. Choosing the greater of two goods: neural currencies for valuation and decision making.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 363-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, Wood and Grafman, 2003Wood J.N. Grafman J. Human prefrontal cortex: processing and representational perspectives.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), the strategy used by the brain to solve this type of problem is both poorly studied and little understood. In navigation tasks, such as that investigated here, an individual must constantly maintain an estimate as to his/her current location as a guide for deciding the next turn, but in the absence of incontrovertible a priori information, this estimate is best represented by the subject's belief. As information is acquired through observation, this belief may become increasingly convincing or alternatively may be discarded in favor of a new one. This is an intuitive way of making estimations that are appropriate for many real-world behaviors, adopted also by a wide variety of intelligent machines, and can be expressed simply in the following diagram:(a posteriori information)=(a priori information)+(information from observation),which describes a basic form of incremental information processing. Here, we investigate how different regions of the brain may be responsible for implementing the simple incremental process in the estimation of uncertain states. Recent theoretical studies have suggested that neural processing in sensorimotor (Kording and Wolpert, 2004Kording K.P. Wolpert D. Bayesian integration in sensorimotor learning.Nature. 2004; 427: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar) and visual (Kersten and Yuille, 2003Kersten D. Yuille A. Bayesian models of object perception.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) systems involves supplementing uncertain observation with a priori belief, and we suggest here that this also holds for higher cognitive systems. Furthermore, recent neuroimaging studies have identified activation in the anterior prefrontal cortex (APF) when subjects perform tasks with competitive rules (Braver and Bongiolatti, 2002Braver T.S. Bongiolatti S.R. The role of frontopolar cortex in subgoal processing during working memory.Neuroimage. 2002; 15: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, Koechlin et al., 2000Koechlin E.

USA. 2000; 97: 7651-7656Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, Strange et al., 2001Strange B.A. Henson R.N.A. Friston K.J. Dolan R.J. Anterior prefrontal cortex mediates rule learning in humans.Cereb. Cortex. 2001; 11: 1040-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In such tasks, the correct rule is not explicitly provided, and subjects need to maintain multiple candidate rules and evaluate them using feedback from the currently executed rule; hence, the correct rule as an incomplete (hidden) state has to be estimated using observable stimuli and feedback. These studies led to the hypothesis that APF activation may be involved in hidden-state estimation, which requires the resolution of uncertainty associated with partially observable states, based on the available observation. To test this hypothesis, we studied brain activity during a navigation task in which subjects were required to make sequential decisions based on incomplete information to reach a goal. In brief, subjects performed repeated goal-search or control visuomotor trials, in separate blocks (Figure 1A), in a “wire-frame” maze whose topography had been robustly learned beforehand. Navigation in the goal-search task depended on observations of only the circum-spaces surrounding their current position; this constitutes a partially observable environment, because these observations are themselves frequently ambiguous (Figure 1B). During testing, subjects had to navigate to a specified goal position from the unknown starting position. To achieve this task efficiently requires estimation of the hidden current position using the restricted observations. Here lies a major methodological challenge when interpreting the corresponding brain activity, in the form of an inverse problem: subjective beliefs held by subjects are themselves hidden from the observer and therefore cannot be established unequivocally. We address this issue using a computational technique based on probabilistic model inference: we statistically estimated the individual subjects' ongoing state estimate (belief) and its associated uncertainty, based on their behavioral decision-making sequence, and then used this model to generate regression functions to predict brain (BOLD) activities. We first constructed a hidden Markov model (HMM) (Macdonald and Zucchini, 1997Macdonald I.L. Zucchini W. Hidden Markov and Other Models for Discrete-Valued Time Series. Chapman and Hall/CRC Press, London1997Google Scholar) of each subject's cognitive state. We inferred two cognitive states: the first was a belief about where the subject was in the maze (estimate states), and the second was a cognitive or operant set (operant states). We used a Bayesian belief update procedure to compute the probability distribution over these states for each trial, given the subject's prior performances. We then used these inferred cognitive states to identify regionally specific neurophysiological correlates in the brain using a conventional voxel-based analysis. Full details of the HMM and Bayesian inversion are found in the Supplemental Data. In the goal-search task, to select the optimal actions for goal achievement, it is essential to estimate the hidden current position, based on the memorized map and the history of three-dimensional (3D) scenes (Figure 1D). In addition, there were two cognitive operant states, corresponding to a “proceed or update mode,” and a “re-evaluate or back-track mode” (Figure 1D), which could be determined by whether a predicted 3D scene was the same as an actual one or not. In brief, the HMM comprised a series of estimate states, each of which corresponds to a possible position in the maze and could be switched with back-track operations (Figure 2A). The conditional probability over these states was computed using incremental Bayes, which enabled us to identify the most likely cognitive state at each trial and the uncertainty about various estimate states, which was quantified in terms of entropy. There were multiple paths whose probabilities were different, in particular for a poor profile following a tortuous path; for example, on the middle and the right maps of Figure 2A, there are two reproduced paths for one actual path. We used the probability distribution over the estimate states to compute the conditional uncertainty about where the subject thought they were on each trial, and we used the probability distribution over the operant states to assess how likely the subject was to be in back-track mode. These probabilistic measures, called hidden current position (HCP) entropy (Figure 2B) and back-track (BT) probability (Figure 2C), respectively, were then used to parametrically modulate event-related stimulus functions for each trial. After convolution with a hemodynamic response function, the stimulus functions were entered into a general linear convolution model of evoked hemodynamic responses in the usual way to form statistical parametric maps. A paired t test analyzing the average reaction times (RTs) demonstrated that the RTs in the goal-search tasks (533 ms) were significantly longer than those measured in the visuomotor control tasks (447 ms) (t = 5.20, p < 0.0001). We defined early and late phases as the former and latter halves of trials in each task block and found that the RTs in the early phase of goal-search tasks (594 ms) were significantly longer than those measured in the early visuomotor phase (467 ms) (t = 3.75, p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference, however, between the late goal-search (483 ms) and visuomotor phases (438 ms) (t = 1.67, p = 0.101). Within the goal-search tasks, the RTs at branch (T intersection) states (701 ms), where action selection was explicitly required, were significantly longer than those at other (straight and curve) states (556 ms) in the early goal-search phase (t = 3.10, p < 0.005); in contrast, there was no significant difference between these states in the late goal-search phase (branch = 546 ms, other = 488 ms, t = 1.44, p = 0.156). These results provide behavioral evidence of the importance of position estimation, over and above that related to action selection alone. To establish the face validity of our HMM and the Bayesian inversion, we examined the RTs in detail to see whether they were consistent with the cognitive states inferred by the model. We were particularly interested to ascertain whether being in a back-track mode prolonged RTs and whether increasing conditional uncertainty (measured by HCP entropy) had a similar effect. The RT profiles (Figure 2C) demonstrated a low-frequency trend of a gradual RT decrease with the progression of trials. There is also a high-frequency component with a relatively jagged pattern; these two components are likely related to the manipulation of position candidates. Interestingly, the RT peaks (high-frequency component) correlated temporally with the BT probability peaks estimated by the HMM (Figure 2C). The peaks of BT probability occurred as estimated in 988 trials (32.5% of total of 3038 trials). Surprisingly, the majority of these trials (584 trials, 59.1%) coincided exactly with the peak timings of highly scattered RTs; this coincidence was significant (F0 = 2.99, p < 10−5), based on a goodness-of-fit test for binominal distributions. The inclusion of adjacent trials of BT peaks, which allowed for small differences in timing attributable to subjects' probabilistic behaviors, increased the rate to 86.1% (851 trials). To support this robust synchronism, we examined for each subject the correlation coefficients between the RT sequence and the binary occurrence sequences of BT peaks and branch states in which the RT was longer. The correlations of RT with BT peaks were significant for all 13 subjects (p < 10−5 for 12 subjects, p < 0.05 for one subject), while with the branch states, significant positive correlations were found only for four subjects but negative for the other four subjects, and this result indicated that the principal factor responsible for the RT peaks was likely to be the back-track operations rather than the branch states. By correlation analysis, smoothed RT (low-frequency component of RT), in which the peaks responsible for back-track operations were removed, correlated positively with the HCP entropy for all 13 subjects; the correlations were significantly positive (p < 0.05) for ten of them. In contrast, the distance (the minimum number of steps) to the goal (Figure 2B) demonstrated significant positive correlations with the smoothed RT for only five subjects (p < 0.05), and negative correlations for two subjects. We compared the correlation coefficients over 13 subjects, confirming that the average correlation of the RT with the HCP entropy (r = 0.23 ± 0.16) was significantly higher than that with the distance to the goal (r = 0.17 ± 0.16) (t = 2.39, p < 0.05), even though the distance was obtained directly from the subjects' profiles. The precision of our HMM-based approach was confirmed by the high accordance between the subjects' actions and those predicted by our model (88.7% ± 2.9%). The model's prediction accuracy correlated significantly with the subjects' task performance (r = 0.49, p < 10−5); better performance blocks, in which the subject selected nearly optimal paths (e.g., Figure 2A), were accompanied by a higher prediction accuracy. Note that we are treating the RT as a dependent or response variable, in the same manner with which we treated the hemodynamic response. Both can be explained or caused by changes in the cognitive state. A subtraction analysis comparing the goal-search and visuomotor task blocks revealed significant activation during goal-search tasks in regions of cerebral cortex, including the right dorsolateral cortex (DLPF; BA46), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; BA32/8), and bilateral posterior parietal cortex (PPC; BA40/7), the thalamus, and basal ganglia areas (putamen, caudate, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra) (Figure 3). The statistics can be found in Table S1. To identify neural activity involved in the estimation of the hidden current position, we subsequently conducted a regression analysis using the two regression functions estimated by our HMM. Both the medial PFC (mPFC; BA9/6) on the medial frontal gyrus (Figure 4A) and the bilateral PPC correlated with the BT probability (Table S2). According to a region of interest (ROI) analysis, activity in mPFC was significantly higher during goal-search than during visuomotor tasks (t = 3.59, p < 0.005), as well as in trials associated with back-track mode compared to update mode within goal-search tasks (t = 4.20, p < 10−4) (Figure 4B). The mean correlation coefficient between the mPFC activity and the BT probability over all goal-search blocks (r = 0.12 ± 0.09) was significantly higher than that between the mPFC activity and the RT (r = −0.03 ± 0.04) (t = 5.22, p < 0.001), indicating that our estimation method based on HMM filtering is better able to explain the imaging data than the performance data itself. For the HCP entropy, we observed correlated activity only in the anterior prefrontal cortex (APF), specifically in the bilateral medial frontal gyrus (BA10) and superior frontal gyrus (BA9) (Figure 5A and Table S2). In an ROI analysis, the percent signal change in both right and left medial frontal gyrus (BA10) positively correlated with the HCP entropy for all 13 subjects (left, r = 0.29 ± 0.22; right, r = 0.27 ± 0.19), and for ten of them it was significantly positive (p < 0.05), according to a strict significance test using the relatively small number of samples from each subject (Figure 5B and 5C). Regardless of the subjects' task performance, this positive correlation supported our hypothesis that the APF is activated during the maintenance of partial observability (uncertainty) in accordance with the HCP entropy, which evaluates the essential computational load for the hidden position estimation. We also created a model that included the distance to the goal (which is unobservable by the subject) and the RT as statistical regression functions. These did not identify any significant correlations, excepting a small area correlated with the DG in the left APF (x, y, z = −32, 49, −1; Z = 3.87; k = 285); the correlated area was within but substantially smaller than that associated with the HCP entropy.Figure 5Brain Activation Involved in the Processes Corresponding to Maintenance and Updating of the Estimate StateShow full caption(A) Bilateral APF activity was associated with the HCP entropy.(B and C) The HCP entropy was significantly correlated with BOLD signal change for ROI in the left and right APF (BA10).

Our results provide evidence that activity in different regions of the prefrontal cortex reflect critical computational components involved in decision making in uncertain environments. This fits well with the proposed role of these regions in decision making, which is likely to be crucial in complex real-world environments. We also illustrate the utility of statistical model-based inference and regression in delineating key task parameters that may be represented in spatially distinct brain regions. From a general neuroanatomical perspective, our block-based analysis of goal-search versus visuomotor tasks demonstrates brain areas that are known to play important roles in navigation and goal search. The PPC is thought to be involved in the maintenance of egocentric spatial representation (Colby and Goldberg, 1999Colby C.L. Goldberg M.E. Space and attention in parietal cortex.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 319-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar), particularly in 3D space (Tsutsui et al., 2002Tsutsui K. Sakata H. Naganuma T. Taira M. Neural correlates for perception of 3D surface orientation from texture gradient.Science. 2002; 298: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and may be related to the maintenance of 3D maze topography in our task. The DLPF is thought to be responsible for higher-order functions such as judgment and prediction (Petrides, 1996Petrides M. Specialized systems for the processing of mnemonic information within the primate frontal cortex.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 1455-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), and so would be expected to be involved in a prediction-based optimal action selection task as utilized here. The ACC is robustly associated with the detection of behavioral errors (Braver et al., 2001Braver T.S. Barch D.M. Gray J.R. Molfese D.L. Snyder A.Z. Anterior cingulate and response conflict: Effects of frequency, inhibition, and errors.Cereb. Cortex. 2001; 11: 825-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar) and response conflict (Botvinick et al., 1999Botvinick M.M. Nystrom L. Fissell K. Carter C.S. Cohen J.D. Conflict monitoring vs. selection-for-action in anterior cingulate cortex.Nature. 1999; 402: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar), and the activation during the goal-search task that we observed may relate to the response conflict induced by multiple action candidates for each 3D scene and/or by the lack of clarity concerning the optimal action due to the ambiguity of the current position. We also observed activation of both the thalamus and the basal ganglia nuclei during the goal-search task; these areas are known to constitute parallel loops with the cortex that are important for the control of involuntary motion (Alexander et al., 1986Alexander G.E.

Neurosci. 1986; 9: 357-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (6368) Google Scholar, Middleton and Strick, 2000Middleton F.A. Strick P.L.

Our model-based analysis data provide evidence that more precise computational functions may be engaged in prefrontal cortex. The mPFC is known to be coactivated with self-referential stimuli (Northoff and Bermpohl, 2004Northoff G. Bermpohl F. Cortical midline structures and the self.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2004; 8: 102-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar), and recent recording (Matsumoto et al., 2003Matsumoto K. Suzuki W. Tanaka K. Neuronal correlates of goal-based motor selection in the prefrontal cortex.Science. 2003; 301: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and lesion (Gehring and Knight, 2000Gehring W.J. Knight R.T. Prefrontal-cingulate interactions in action monitoring.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) studies have demonstrated evidence of a link between the mPFC and monitoring of one's individual performance (self-generated actions) based on reward prediction, which engages the lateral PFC to execute performance adjustments. The processes performed during back-track mode, such as error detection and consequent action selection, corresponded closely to these hypothesized functions. However, unlike previous tasks in which the subjects select actions based purely on a given stimulus, the action in our goal-search tasks is selected based on both the observed scenes (stimuli) and the current estimate of the position. Thus, our results suggest that the mPFC is responsible for selecting actions based on both the currently observable and an internally evaluated cognitive state. The correlation of bilateral PPC with BT probability is more speculative, but might represent memory reload to enumerate new position candidates. In this study, we observed activation in medial cortical structures by both goal-search > visuomotor subtraction analysis and regression analysis using the BT probability, which were primarily distributed over the ACC (BA8/32) and the mPFC (BA9), respectively. These results indicate that the ACC was constantly activated during goal-search tasks, while mPFC activity increased in relation to back-track operations. Recently, medial cortical structures have been shown to become activated when action changes are induced by either negative stimuli (error) or positive ones (reward) (Knutson et al., 2001Knutson B. Fong G.W. Adams C.M. Varner J.L. Hommer D. Dissociation of reward anticipation and outcome with event-related fMRI.Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 3683-3687Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar, Shidara and Richmond, 2002Shidara M. Richmond B.J. Anterior cingulate: single neuronal signals related to degree of reward expectancy.Science. 2002; 296: 1709-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). A recent review suggests functional segregation in this area, distinguishing three regions: the orbitomedial PFC (BA10/11/12), dorsomedial PFC (BA8/9, mPFC in our study), and the anterior cingulate (BA24/32), and postulated that these regions correspond to representation, evaluation, and monitoring of self-referential stimuli, respectively (Northoff and Bermpohl, 2004Northoff G. Bermpohl F. Cortical midline structures and the self.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2004; 8: 102-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). During each trial of the goal-search task, the subjects were required to check the 3D scenes that resulted from their actions; subjects were to re-estimate their positions only during back-track trials. These processes can be regarded as the monitoring and evaluation of self-referential stimuli; our results indicating that ACC and mPFC activity, respectively, are consistent with the recent view presented above. Recent imaging studies have demonstrated APF activation during complex cognitive tasks, in particular those involving multiple competitive rules (Braver and Bongiolatti, 2002Braver T.S.

Anterior prefrontal cortex mediates rule learning in humans.Cereb. Cortex. 2001; 11: 1040-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The tasks used in these studies can be regarded as optimal decision problems in partially observable environments: given that the correct rule was not explicitly provided by the environment, the subjects were required to maintain multiple candidates, such as two subtasks in a branching task (Koechlin et al., 2000Koechlin E. Corrado G. Pietrini P. Grafman J. Dissociating the role of the medial and lateral anterior prefrontal cortex in human planning.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 7651-7656Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) or six rules in a categorization task (Strange et al., 2001Strange B.A. Henson R.N.A. Friston K.J. Dolan R.J. Anterior prefrontal cortex mediates rule learning in humans.Cereb. Cortex. 2001; 11: 1040-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and then to examine their possibilities based on feedback. These processes correspond to the maintenance and updating of a hidden state. In these tasks, however, the number of hidden rules was small enough to allow the subjects to memorize them completely. In addition, as feedback clearly indicated whether the used rule had been correct, updating the candidates at each trial did not require the estimation of probabilities for each candidate, but only deletion or retention of the used rule based on feedback. As these studies performed a subtraction analysis between the conditions or events, the results did not fully illuminate the processes functioning during the tasks. Our regression analysis has clarified that APF activities vary according to the HCP entropy, which is the objectively estimated measure of the internal conflict among candidates of the hidden state, adding a dynamic aspect to previous results. Our result is also consistent with recent assertions that the APF is involved in the processing of internally generated information (Christoff et al., 2003Christoff K. Ream J.M. Geddes L.P. Gabrieli J.D. Evaluating self-generated information: anterior prefrontal contributions to human cognition.Behav. Neurosci. 2003; 117: 1161-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and is pivotal in the PFC network by integrating information represented in lateral PFC to select an appropriate behavioral rule (Koechlin et al., 2003Koechlin E. Ody C. Kouneiher F. The architecture of cognitive control in the human prefrontal cortex.Science. 2003; 302: 1181-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). From a computational viewpoint, an optimal action selection problem without hidden states is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP), and reinforcement learning, which is an approach to solving MDPs, may be realized within brain networks primarily including the P"

However, the mechanism underlying the selective vulnerability in dopaminergic pathway due to the inactivation of DJ-1 is unclear. Previously, we have reported that DJ-1 is a neuroprotective transcriptional co-activator interacting with the transcriptional co-repressor pyrimidine tract-binding protein-associated splicing factor (PSF). Here we show that DJ-1 and PSF bind and regulate the human tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) promoter. Inactivation of DJ-1 by small interference RNA (siRNA) results in decreased TH expression and l-DOPA production in human dopaminergic cell lines. Consistent with its role as a transcriptional regulator, DJ-1 specifically suppresses the global SUMO-1 modification. High molecular weight sumoylated protein species, including PSF, accumulate in the lymphoblast cells from the patients carrying pathogenic DJ-1 mutations. DJ-1 elevates the TH expression by inhibiting the sumoylation of PSF and preventing its sumoylation-dependent recruitment of histone deacetylase 1. Furthermore, siRNA silencing of DJ-1 decreases the acetylation of TH promoter-bound histones, and histone deacetylase inhibitors restore the DJ-1 siRNA-induced repression of TH. Therefore, our results suggest DJ-1 as a regulator of protein sumoylation and directly link the loss of DJ-1 expression and transcriptional dysfunction to impaired dopamine synthesis.

Lozano A.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 1044-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (1795) Google Scholar). Dopamine deficiency in PD patients contributes to the typical clinical features, which include tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability. These symptoms can be temporally controlled by administering medications targeting dopamine metabolism and function, such as the dopamine precursor l-DOPA and dopamine agonists. The rate-limiting enzyme for dopamine synthesis is tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Loss-of-function mutations in the DJ-1 gene cause early-on-set Parkinsonism (2Bonifati V. Rizzu P. van Baren M.J.

The role of DJ-1 in neuronal survival is strengthened by in vivo studies using Drosophila lacking DJ-1, which exhibit increased sensitivity to oxidative stress or environmental mitochondrial toxins (10Yang Y.

On the other hand, DJ-1-deficient mice do not reproduce the typical neuropathology of PD patients, such as the loss of the dopaminergic neurons and the formation of intracellular inclusion Lewy bodies, although they exhibit subtle defects in the nigral-striatal pathway and motor functions (12Goldberg M.S.

Patients carrying DJ-1 mutations demonstrate reduced dopamine uptake indistinguishable to patients with sporadic PD (15Dekker M.C. Eshuis S.A. Maguire R.P. Veenma-van der Duijn L. Pruim J.

Due to the lack of pathological evidence from patients with DJ-1 mutations, it remains unclear whether the loss of DJ-1 function affects both dopaminergic neuronal survival and nigral-striatal pathways in humans. Before mutations in the DJ-1 gene were linked to familial PD, DJ-1 had been suggested to regulate transcription by modulating androgen receptor function in the testis (16Niki T. Takahashi-Niki K. Taira T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 247-261PubMed Google Scholar, 17Takahashi K. Taira T. Niki T. Seino C. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37556-37563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). DJ-1 restores the activities of androgen receptor by interacting with and antagonizing the transcriptional repressors PIASxa and DJBP (16Niki T. Takahashi-Niki K. Taira T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 247-261PubMed Google Scholar, 17Takahashi K. Taira T. Niki T. Seino C. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 37556-37563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), and whether transcriptional regulation by DJ-1 is related to PD pathogenesis is yet to be fully characterized. We have recently demonstrated that DJ-1 forms complexes with nuclear proteins pyrimidine tract-binding protein-associated splicing factor (PSF) and p54nrb (7Xu J. Zhong N. Wang H. Elias J.E. Kim C.K. Woldman I. Pifl C. Gygi S.P. Geula C. Yankner B.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 1231-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), two proteins that are highly expressed in the brain and affect RNA metabolism and transcription. DJ-1 serves as a transcriptional co-activator and prevents co-repressor PSF-mediated gene silencing and apoptosis. Consistent with the role of DJ-1 in transcriptional regulation, several protein interaction studies suggest a potential functional link between DJ-1 and small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO). Sumoylation is a reversible ATP-dependent process to covalently attach SUMO to target proteins, usually nuclear proteins (18Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev.

Similar to ubiquitination, this process requires the participation of E1 activating enzymes, E2 conjugating enzymes, and E3 ligases (18Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev.

In addition, DJ-1 interacts with SUMO-1, SUMO-activating enzyme Uba2, and conjugating enzyme ubc-9 in the yeast two-hybrid systems (8Junn E. Taniguchi H. Jeong B.S. Zhao X. Ichijo H. Mouradian M.M.

However, the functional significance of the link between sumoylation and DJ-1 and the potential relevance to PD pathogenesis are unclear. In the current study, we extend our prior findings and identify the human TH as a cellular target of transcriptional regulation by DJ-1 and PSF. DJ-1 promotes the expression of TH by inhibiting the SUMO-1 modification of PSF and preventing the recruitment of histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1 by PSF. Therefore, our results indicate that the transcriptional dysregulation caused by DJ-1 inactivation and the subsequent impairment of dopamine synthesis contribute to the development of PD. Cell Culture, Plasmids, and Chemicals—Human CHP-212 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium/F-12 (50%/50%) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Human SH-SY5Y, HeLa, and HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. For immunofluorescence, cells were grown on coverslips. Wild-type and mutant DJ-1 constructs and SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing these constructs were described previously (7Xu J. Zhong N. Wang H.

The lymphoblasts from patients carrying pathogenic DJ-1 mutations (2Bonifati V. Rizzu P. van Baren M.J. Schaap O. Breedveld G.J. Krieger E. Dekker M.C. Squitieri F. Ibanez P.

Human SUMO-1 construct (pCMV-HA-SUMO-1) was a gift from Dr. Kim Orth at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Human PIASy (pCMV-PIASy) was purchased from ATCC. Rat TH-luc reporter plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Kwang Soo Kim at McLean Hospital, Harvard Medical School, and the pTK-Renilla luciferase plasmid for transfection control was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). A FLAG tag was fused in-frame to the N terminus of human wild-type PSF (7Xu J. Zhong N. Wang H. Elias J.E. Kim C.K. Woldman I. Pifl C. Gygi S.P. Geula C. Yankner B.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 1231-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) to generate a tagged PSF construct (pCMV-FLAG-PSF). To introduce point mutations at the PSF sumoylation site (I337A and K338A), we used a two-step PCR mutagenesis approach to mutate and amplify the PSF fragments flanked by the EcoRI and BamHI sites. The resulting PCR products (979 bp) were then subcloned into an expression vector using pCMV-FLAG-PSF as backbone. The PSF plasmids were confirmed by sequencing. The flanking primers were: forward, 5′-gatgtcggttgtttgttg-3′; reverse, 5′-atctcccatgttcattgct-3′. Mutagenesis primers for PSF-I337A were: forward, 5′-ggattcggatttgctaagcttgaatctagagc-3′; reverse, 5′-gctctagattcaagcttagcaaatccgaatcc-3′. Mutagenesis primers for PSF-K338A were: forward, 5′-ggattcggatttattgcgcttgaatctagagc-3′; reverse, 5′-gctctagattcaagcgcaataaatccgaatcc-3′. Sodium butyrate and trichostatin A were from Sigma. Transfection of siRNA and Plasmids—CHP-212 or SH-SY5Y cells plated in 6-well culture dishes were transfected with 100 nm siRNA constructs against the human DJ-1 (SMARTpool reagent, Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) or nonspecific control siRNA constructs (siControl non-targeting pool, Dharmacon) using the Transfectin reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) following the manufacturer's suggested protocol. Cells were harvested at 48 h post-transfection for RNA extraction or at days 1, 2, and 4 for Western blotting. To analyze the effects of HDAC inhibitors on the TH expression after DJ-1 inactivation, indicated sodium butyrate or trichostatin A was added to fresh medium 48 h after siRNA transfection, and the mixture was cultured for an additional 2 days. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used to transfect various plasmids. To study the transcriptional repression of TH by PSF, CHP-212 cells plated in 10-cm dishes were co-transfected with 20 μg of control vector, WT, or mutant PSF plasmids and 2 μg of green fluorescent protein. Transfected cells were harvested 48 h later and enriched using a Cytomation Mo-Flo cell sorter (Core facility, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA) for subsequent total RNA extraction and mRNA analysis using quantitative PCR. Western Blotting, Immunoprecipitation, and Antibodies—The procedures for Western blotting and immunoprecipitation were described previously (7Xu J. Zhong N. Wang H. Elias J.E. Kim C.K. Woldman I. Pifl C. Gygi S.P. Geula C. Yankner B.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 1231-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). For SUMO-1-conjugated PSF IP, cells were lysed in denaturing radioimmune precipitation assay-deoxycholate buffer; for various co-immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were lysed in non-denaturing lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Antibodies used for IP included: a mouse monoclonal anti-PSF (Sigma), a rabbit polyclonal anti-DJ-1 (7Xu J. Zhong N. Wang H. Elias J.E. Kim C.K. Woldman I. Pifl C. Gygi S.P. Geula C. Yankner B.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 1231-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), and a mouse monoclonal anti-HDAC1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies for Western blotting included: a mouse monoclonal anti-TH (Sigma); monoclonal (Stressgen, San Diego, CA) and a polyclonal anti-DJ-1; a goat anti-β-actin and a mouse monoclonal anti-HDAC1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); a mouse monoclonal anti-SUMO-1 and a rabbit polyclonal anti-SUMO-2/3 (Invitrogen); and a rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG tag and a rabbit polyclonal anti-acetylated histones (Histone sampler kit, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). RNA Extraction and Real-time Quantitative PCR—RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and purified with an RNeasy Kit or an RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen). The quality of extracted RNA was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis. Reference RNA used for the calibration curve was made by pooling equal amounts of RNA from all samples. Q-PCRs were performed using a LightCycler (Roche Applied Science) and a One-Step QuantiTect™ SYBR Green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). Experimental conditions and primer design parameter were set according to the Q-PCR kit instruction manual. Results were normalized to an internal control PCR amplified with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or β-actin primers included in the same run of Q-PCR. The specificity of PCR amplifications was further confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Primers for the human TH were: forward, 5′-cctcgcccatgcactc-3′; reverse, 5′-cctcgcccatgcactc-3′. Primers for PSF were: forward, 5′-accaccagcagcatcacc-3′; reverse, 5′-tcccaacaaacaaccgaca-3′. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—ChIP assays using cultured cells were performed following the instructions of the EZ ChIP Kit (Upstate) with the following modifications. After protein-DNA cross-linking and harvesting, the cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer and sonicated on ice using a Branson Digital Sonifier (Branson Ultrasonics Corp., Danbury, CT) with 16 sets of 4-s pulse at 17% maximum power. The genomic DNA was sheared to 300–1200 bp of length. Aliquots of chromatin solution (each equivalent to 1 × 106 cells) were pre-cleared with Protein G-agarose and incubated with species-matched IgG or specific antibodies overnight at 4 °C with rotation. ChIP assays using brain tissues from normal patients were performed as described before (24Lu T. Pan Y. Kao S.Y. Li C. Kohane I. Chan J. Yankner B.A. Nature. 2004; 429: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1481) Google Scholar). The substantia nigra tissues from a male (postmortem interval, 4.5 h) and a female (postmortem interval, 13 h) patient with no neurological or psychiatric conditions were acquired according to institutional regulations. Tissues surrounding the substantia nigra pars compacta were trimmed off to yield relatively pure nigral tissue. Samples were snapfrozen in liquid nitrogen after dissection and stored under –80 °C until usage. The specific antibodies applied in ChIP assays for DJ-1, PSF, HDAC1, and acetylated histones are described above. The final immunoprecipitated DNA fragments were used as templates for PCR with hot start Platinum Taq (Invitrogen) using the following conditions: 3 min at 94 °C; 32 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 95 °C, 30 s annealing at 57 °C, and 30 s elongation at 72 °C; with one final incubation for 2 min at 72 °C. 27–33 cycles were used for semiquantitative PCR in the TH-promoter-associated acetylated histones IP. Primer 3 software was used to design the PCR primers for amplifying the human TH promoter. The forward primer was 5′-gagccttcctggtgtttgtg-3′; the reverse primer was 5′-ctctccgattccagatggtg-3′. The PCR products correspond to the promoter sequences –2909 to –2707 upstream to the transcriptional initiation site of the human TH gene, and were analyzed by electrophoresis on 2% Tris-acetate-EDTA agarose gels. The primers used to amplify the control human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter were: forward, 5′-tactagcggttttacgggcg-3′; reverse, 5′-tcgaacaggaggagcagagagcga-3′. TH Activity Assay—The TH activity in CHP-212 cells transfected with control or DJ-1-specific siRNA was determined by measuring l-DOPA formation using methods as described (25Hayashi M. Yamaji Y. Kitajima W. Saruta T. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: F28-F33PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 4 days after the siRNA transfection, CHP-212 cells plated in 6-well dishes were rinsed twice with 1 ml of the physiological medium and then incubated for 12 h at 37 °C with 100 mm l-tyrosine and 500 μm n-hydroxybenzylhydrozine (Sigma), a selective DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor. After the incubation, medium was discarded and the cells were collected, resuspended with 0.1 ml of 0.1 n perchloric acid, and sonicated. An aliquot (10 μl) was used to determine protein concentration, and the remainder was centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. A 20-μl aliquot of the supernatant was injected onto an ODS Hypersil column (150 × 4.6 mm, 5-μm particle size, Keystone Scientific Inc., Bellefonte, PA). Mobile phase consisted of (in mm): 50 potassium phosphate, 0.1 EDTA, 0.2 heptane sulfonic acid, and 10% methanol, pH 2.6. l-DOPA peaks were detected with an Antec Leyden Intro amperometric high-performance liquid chromatography system (GBC Analytical Systems). Peaks from samples were compared against a daily 200-pictrogram l-DOPA external standard. Results were normalized per microgram of protein and analyzed through one-way analysis of variance. DJ-1 and PSF Transcriptionally Regulate the Human TH Promoter—Since we have shown that DJ-1 is a transcriptional co-activator, we examined whether DJ-1 regulated the expression of genes involved in dopaminergic neurotransmission, such as tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme that converts tyrosine to the dopamine precursor l-DOPA. To mimic the loss-of-function effects as seen in PD patients with DJ-1 mutations, we used DJ-1-specific siRNA constructs to inhibit the synthesis of endogenous DJ-1 in two human dopaminergic neuroblastoma cell lines, CHP-212 and SH-SY5Y cells. The protein levels of TH and DJ-1 showed time-dependent decreases in CHP-212 cells transfected with DJ-1-specific siRNA (Fig. 1A). 4 days after DJ-1 siRNA transfection, the TH protein expression was reduced by 90% (Fig. 1A). Quantitative real-time PCR results indicated that DJ-1 inactivation by siRNA significantly decreased the TH mRNA levels in both CHP-212 and SH-SY5Y cells as determined by quantitative real-time PCR (Fig. 1B). In addition, the reduction in the TH expression following siRNA knockdown of DJ-1 decreased the TH activity by almost 40% in CHP-212 cells, as determined by the production of l-DOPA using high-performance liquid chromatography (Fig. 1C). Consistent with these observations, the TH mRNA expression was increased by >100% in SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing the human wild-type DJ-1 (Fig. 1D). Previously, we have shown that DJ-1 interacts with and blocks the functions of a transcriptional repressor PSF in human dopaminergic cells (7Xu J. Zhong N. Wang H. Elias J.E. Kim C.K. Woldman I. Pifl C. Gygi S.P. Geula C. Yankner B.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 1231-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). As in SH-SY5Y cells, PSF specifically interacted with DJ-1 in untransfected CHP-212 cells (data not shown). Therefore, we tested whether PSF repressed TH transcription. Transient expression of the wild-type PSF inhibited the human TH mRNA expression in CHP-212 cells (Fig. 1E). To further confirm the transcriptional regulation of the human TH promoter by both DJ-1 and PSF, we performed ChIP assays to assess the physical interactions between these two transcriptional regulators and the TH promoter in vitro and in vivo. The DNA co-immunoprecipitated with either a monoclonal anti-PSF or a polyclonal anti-DJ-1 antibody using the lysates from CHP-212 cells or human substantia nigra pars compacta tissues were amplified by primers specifically recognizing the human TH promoter but not by primers recognizing the human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter (Fig. 1F). Taken together, our results strongly demonstrate that DJ-1 activates the human TH expression and regulates dopamine synthesis. DJ-1 Inhibits the Sumoylation of PSF and Its Repression of the TH Promoter—To elucidate the molecular mechanism of this transcriptional regulation, we assessed the possibility that DJ-1 might regulate the sumoylation of PSF. DJ-1 has been shown to interact with SUMO-1, SUMO-activating enzyme Uba2, and conjugating enzyme ubc-9 (8Junn E. Taniguchi H. Jeong B.S. Zhao X. Ichijo H. Mouradian M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) using the yeast two-hybrid system. In addition, DJ-1 interacts with SUMO ligases PIASxa and PIASy and potentially regulates their functions (17Takahashi K. Taira T. Niki T. Seino C. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37556-37563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, PSF harbors a potential sumoylation site (IKLE) that completely matches the consensus sumoylation motif ΨKXE, where the conserved lysine (K) and glutamic acid (E) are preceded by a hydrophobic amino acid (Ψ) and any amino acid (X), respectively (Fig. 2A). Recently, a proteomic study suggested that PSF is sumoylated, although the site of modification has not been mapped (26Rosas-Acosta G. Russell W.K. Deyrieux A. Russell D.H. Wilson V.G. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 56-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). We first examined the effect of DJ-1 on global sumoylation in SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing the human wild-type DJ-1. Overexpression of the wild-type DJ-1 resulted in an overall decrease in the amount of high molecular weight proteins modified by SUMO-1 but not by SUMO-2 or SUMO-3 (Fig. 2B). To examine whether DJ-1 similarly regulates sumoylation in vivo, we analyzed the lymphoblast cells harvested from normal or PD patients carrying pathogenic mutations in the DJ-1 gene. Consistent with the results from Fig. 2B, DJ-1 inactivation caused by the homozygous deletion of exons 1 to 5 (DEL) or the L166P point mutation resulted in a slight but reproducible increase in the amount of SUMO-1-modified high molecular weight proteins (Fig. 2C, -fold change relative to WT, mean ± S.E., DEL: 1.47 ± 0.09; L166P: 3.07 ± 0.61; p < 0.05, n = 3 for both conditions). Next, we examined whether PSF was sumoylated and whether DJ-1 affected this process. Immunoprecipitation of PSF and Western blotting of SUMO species and PSF using lysates from SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing various DJ-1 constructs indicated that PSF was modified by SUMO-1 (Fig. 2D) but not by SUMO-2 or SUMO-3 (data not shown). Further, the wild-type and the non-pathogenic R98Q DJ-1, but not the pathogenic DJ-1 mutants expressed at similar levels, specifically reduced the abundance of SUMO-1-conjugated PSF (Fig. 2, D and E). The inability of the pathogenic DJ-1 mutants to suppress PSF sumoylation suggests a functional link between the reg"

Upon reaching the high-spin to low-spin transition of Fe 2+ at about 60 GPa, we observed enhanced absorption in the mid- and near-infrared spectral range, whereas absorption in the visible-ultraviolet was reduced. The observed changes in absorption are in contrast to prediction and are attributed to d-d orbital charge transfer in the Fe 2+ ion. The results indicate that low-spin (Mg,Fe)O will exhibit lower radiative thermal conductivity than high-spin (Mg,Fe)O, which needs to be considered in future geodynamic models of convection and plume stabilization in the lower mantle."
https://openalex.org/W2015872566,"A cone photoreceptor releases glutamate at ribbons located atop narrow membrane invaginations that empty onto a terminal base. The unique shape of the cone terminal suggests that there are two transmitter microenvironments: within invaginations, where concentrations are high and exposures are brief; and at the base, where concentrations are low and exposure is smoothed by diffusion. Using multicell voltage-clamp recording, we show that different subtypes of Off bipolar cells sample transmitter in two microenvironments. The dendrites of an AMPA receptor-containing cell insert into invaginations and sense rapid fluctuations in glutamate concentration that can lead to transient responses. The dendrites of kainate receptor-containing cells make basal contacts and respond to a smoothed flow of glutamate that produces sustained responses. Signaling at the cone to Off bipolar cell synapse illustrates how transmitter spillover and synapse architecture can combine to produce distinct signals in postsynaptic neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2026717174,"We investigated rearrangements of connectivity between hippocampal mossy fibers and CA3 pyramidal neurons. We found that mossy fibers establish 10-15 local terminal arborization complexes (LMT-Cs) in CA3, which exhibit major differences in size and divergence in adult mice. LMT-Cs exhibited two types of long-term rearrangements in connectivity in the adult: progressive expansion of LMT-C subsets along individual dendrites throughout life, and pronounced increases in LMT-C complexities in response to an enriched environment. In organotypic slice cultures, subsets of LMT-Cs also rearranged extensively and grew over weeks and months, altering the strength of preexisting connectivity, and establishing or dismantling connections with pyramidal neurons. Differences in LMT-C plasticity reflected properties of individual LMT-Cs, not mossy fibers. LMT-C maintenance and growth were regulated by spiking activity, mGluR2-sensitive transmitter release from LMTs, and PKC. Thus, subsets of terminal arborization complexes by mossy fibers rearrange their local connectivities in response to experience and age throughout life.

In contrast, although there is abundant evidence for pronounced physiological plasticity in the adult, evidence that structural rearrangements of circuitry also take place in the adult has been scarce (but see Knott et al., 2002Knott G.W.

In addition, a study using long-term organotypic hippocampal slice cultures showed that subsets of presynaptic terminals can undergo comparable balanced turnover, and that the extent of this turnover is again enhanced by synaptic activity (De Paola et al., 2003De Paola V. Arber S. Caroni P. AMPA receptors regulate dynamic equilibrium of presynaptic terminals in mature hippocampal networks.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Finally, recent studies of adult mouse barrel and visual cortex have provided evidence for such structural plasticity of presynaptic terminals in vivo (De Paola et al., 2006De Paola V. Holtmaat A.

However, these studies imaged groups of either pre- or postsynaptic elements within small regions of neuropil, and could thus not assign complete sets of synapses by individual identified presynaptic neurons to their postsynaptic targets. Consequently, it has remained unclear to what extent synapse rearrangement processes in the adult produce net alterations in the numbers of synaptic connections between identified synaptic partners. For the same reasons, it has also remained unclear whether, and under what circumstances, repeated rearrangement processes can lead to incremental shifts of connectivity in the adult. To address these questions, we looked for simple and well-characterized circuitry that had been implicated in experience-related anatomical plasticity, and circuitry which was also accessible to large-scale repeated imaging during long periods of time. The mossy fiber projection by dentate gyrus granule cells onto hippocampal pyramidal neurons in CA3 (Johnston and Amaral, 1998Johnston D. Amaral D.G. Hippocampus in The Synaptic Organization of the Brain.in: Shepherd G.M. New York, Oxford University Press1998: 417-458Google Scholar, Henze et al., 2000Henze D.A. Urban N.N. Barrionuevo G. The multifarious hippocampal mossy fiber pathway: a review.Neuroscience. 2000; 98: 407-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) is an attractive system for investigating patterns of synaptic connection rearrangements on a comprehensive scale. First, most of the mossy fiber projection in CA3 is lamellar with respect to the hippocampal long axis, and it exhibits stereotypical and simple relationships with respect to the number of its postsynaptic partners. Each mossy fiber establishes 10–15 large mossy fiber terminals (LMTs) at 80–150 μm intervals along its projection in CA3 that can be unambiguously identified anatomically (Johnston and Amaral, 1998Johnston D. Amaral D.G. Hippocampus in The Synaptic Organization of the Brain.in: Shepherd G.M. New York, Oxford University Press1998: 417-458Google Scholar). The average number of distinct mossy fiber inputs per pyramidal neuron in CA3 has been estimated at about 30–45 (Henze et al., 2000Henze D.A. Urban N.N. Barrionuevo G. The multifarious hippocampal mossy fiber pathway: a review.Neuroscience. 2000; 98: 407-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), suggesting that the probability for random pairs of mossy fibers to synapse onto the same pyramidal neuron is very low. These low-synapse numbers stand in sharp contrast to the very high degree of connectivity among pyramidal neurons in CA3, and from CA3 to CA1. Second, mossy fibers in stratum lucidum establish well-characterized and powerful excitatory synaptic connections with pyramidal cells through LMTs and with inhibitory interneurons through en-passant varicosities and LMT filopodia (Acsady et al., 1998Acsady L.

The latter provide efficient feed-forward inhibition and mediate the predominant outcome of mossy fiber activation when these spike at low frequencies (Lawrence and McBain, 2003Lawrence J.J.

In contrast, mossy fibers elicit increasing excitation of CA3 pyramidal neurons when firing at higher frequencies (Geiger and Jonas, 2000Geiger J.R. Jonas P.

Gahwiler B.H. Gerber U. A frequency-dependent switch from inhibition to excitation in a hippocampal unitary circuit.Nature. 2004; 431: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). As a consequence, and probably depending on spiking frequency, one or a small number of converging LMTs can be sufficient to elicit action potentials in a postsynaptic pyramidal cell, assigning a major instructional role to this synapse in triggering network activity in the hippocampus (Henze et al., 2002Henze D.A. Wittner L. Buzsaki G. Single granule cells reliably discharge targets in the hippocampal CA3 network in vivo.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 790-795PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, postsynaptic spiking induced by LMTs also serves as a powerful trigger to induce LTP at coactive, weaker associational synapses onto the distal sections of the same pyramidal neuron dendrites (Kobayashi and Poo, 2004Kobayashi K. Poo M.M. Spike train timing-dependent associative modification of hippocampal CA3 recurrent synapses by mossy fibers.Neuron. 2004; 41: 445-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Lastly, individual mossy fibers fire rarely during hippocampal recruitment (sparse code), suggesting that small ensembles of coactive granule cells convey information to the hippocampal network, and that the precise outcome of the firing for each of these cells might be functionally important (Johnston and Amaral, 1998Johnston D. Amaral D.G. Hippocampus in The Synaptic Organization of the Brain.in: Shepherd G.M. New York, Oxford University Press1998: 417-458Google Scholar, Henze et al., 2002Henze D.A. Wittner L. Buzsaki G. Single granule cells reliably discharge targets in the hippocampal CA3 network in vivo.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 790-795PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence have implicated the mossy fiber projection in anatomical plasticity related to experience. Neuroanatomical analyses using Timm staining in mice and rats have suggested that mossy fiber projection sizes are correlated to performance in hippocampal-dependent tasks (e.g., Schopke et al., 1991Schopke R. Wolfer D.P. Lipp H.P. Leisinger-Trigona M.C. Swimming navigation and structural variations of the infrapyramidal mossy fibers in the hippocampus of the mouse.Hippocampus. 1991; 1: 315-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, Pleskacheva et al., 2000Pleskacheva M.G. Wolfer D.P. Kupriyanova I.F. Nikolenko D.L. Scheffrahn H. Dell'Omo G. Lipp H.P. Hippocampal mossy fibers and swimming navigation learning in two vole species occupying different habitats.Hippocampus. 2000; 10: 17-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and that experience can lead to significant alterations in the size of the mossy fiber projection (Schwegler et al., 1991Schwegler H. Crusio W.E. Lipp H.P. Brust I. Mueller G.G. Early postnatal hyperthyroidism alters hippocampal circuitry and improves radial-maze learning in adult mice.J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2102-2106PubMed Google Scholar, Ramirez-Amaya et al., 2001Ramirez-Amaya V. Balderas I. Sandoval J. Escobar M.L. Bermudez-Rattoni F. Spatial long-term memory is related to mossy fiber synaptogenesis.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7340-7348PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, long-term stress can lead to reductions in spatial learning performance and in the average density of mossy fiber synapses as determined by electron microscopy, and these impairments can be reversed through training for spatial tasks (McEwen, 1999McEwen B.S. Stress and hippocampal plasticity.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 105-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar, Sandi et al., 2003Sandi C. Davies H.A. Cordero M.I. Rodriguez J.J. Popov V.I. Stewart M.G. Rapid reversal of stress induced loss of synapses in CA3 of rat hippocampus following water maze training.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 17: 2447-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Finally, independent studies have revealed that the dendrites and dendritic spines of CA3 pyramidal neurons are particularly sensitive to stress-inducing treatments and stress-related hormones (e.g., McEwen, 1999McEwen B.S. Stress and hippocampal plasticity.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 105-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar), suggesting that both the pre- and postsynaptic elements of mossy fiber synapses are subject to experience-related anatomical plasticity in the adult. Taken together, these findings from distinct species and experimental approaches support the notion that the mossy fiber projection and its LMT synapses in CA3 provide a promising system for investigating persistent rearrangements of synaptic circuitry influenced by experience in the adult brain. Here we exploited both transgenic mice expressing membrane-targeted GFP in only a few neurons (Thy1-mGFPs) (De Paola et al., 2003De Paola V. Arber S. Caroni P. AMPA receptors regulate dynamic equilibrium of presynaptic terminals in mature hippocampal networks.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and high-resolution imaging to investigate the connectivity of LMTs in fixed mouse tissue and organotypic slice cultures. We find that LMTs are highly heterogeneous in vivo and in slice cultures, and that many of them are connected through 10–200 μm processes to “satellite LMTs” that can contact distinct pyramidal neurons in CA3. LMTs are thus components of local presynaptic terminal arborization complexes by mossy fibers (LMT-Cs), exhibiting varying degrees of divergence with respect to their local targets in CA3. We then show that LMT-Cs exhibit pronounced long-term rearrangements in the adult. We provide evidence for two distinct types of rearrangements: (1) a life-long gradual growth of the largest LMT-Cs along pyramidal cell dendrites, and (2) a dramatic increase in the complexity of many LMT-Cs in mice housed in an enriched environment. We finally show that (1) subsets of LMT-Cs exhibit comparable rearrangements and growth over weeks and months in slice cultures, (2) that these anatomical rearrangements reflect functional rearrangements in the local connectivity of LMT-Cs with pyramidal neurons, (3) that heterogeneities in plasticity and growth reflect local properties of individual LMT-Cs, and (4) that LMT-C maintenance and growth are regulated by synaptic activity, mGluR2-sensitive transmitter release from LMTs, and PKC. Taken together, these results demonstrate the existence of sustained local rearrangements of connectivity by defined terminal arborization structures regulated by activity in the adult. As a prerequisite to investigating the anatomical plasticity of LMTs, we analyzed their morphologies and connectivities, using Thy1-mGFPs transgenic mouse lines expressing membrane-targeted GFP in only a few neurons (De Paola et al., 2003De Paola V. Arber S. Caroni P. AMPA receptors regulate dynamic equilibrium of presynaptic terminals in mature hippocampal networks.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), high-resolution light microscopy of perfused brain tissue, and 3D image processing. The degree of anatomical resolution conferred by the mGFP marker allowed us to provide views of hippocampal LMTs at a very high level of overall organization and resolution (Figure 1). We found that in addition to core terminal regions with filopodia adjacent to the main axon, which had been described in previous studies, LMTs frequently exhibited processes of 10–200 μm in length that emerged from the core LMT and terminated at satellite LMTs (Figure 1A; see also Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data; range of 0–5 satellites per LMT depending on age: 38% [2.5 months], 58% [6 months], and 70% [16 months] of all LMTs exhibited satellites; see Figure 3C). Like core LMTs, satellites were larger than 2.5 μm in diameter, exhibited filopodia, and contacted pyramidal neurons (see below). To rule out the possibility that some of the structures might be due to the mGFP marker itself, we also acquired images from mice expressing cytosolic YFP (Thy1-cYFPs) (Feng et al., 2000Feng G. Mellor R.H. Bernstein M. Keller-Peck C. Nguyen Q.T. Wallace M. Nerbonne J.M. Lichtman J.W. Sanes J.R. Imaging neuronal subsets in transgenic mice expressing multiple spectral variants of GFP.Neuron. 2000; 28: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2246) Google Scholar). Although the resolution was substantially inferior, the cytosolic marker revealed the same types of subcomponents and arrangements, including core regions and satellites, as detected with the mGFP marker (Figure S1B). For the sake of clarity, we therefore introduce the term “LMT complex” (LMT-C) to designate a local presynaptic terminal arborization structure consisting of a core LMT, its filopodia, its satellite LMTs, and their filopodia. Accordingly, mossy fibers establish 10–15 LMT-Cs in CA3, and some of these LMT-Cs exhibit satellites. A comparison among large sets of LMT-Cs within small regions of hippocampus revealed pronounced variations among these presynaptic terminal complexes, which ranged from small core terminal regions to very large and highly complex structures consisting of LMTs with multiple subunits and several satellites (Figure 1; see also Figures 2A, 2C, and 3C). Reconstruction of three LMTs from serial EM sections of nontransgenic hippocampi provided independent evidence that individual LMTs can consist of multiple interconnected subunits (Figure S2). The very large sizes of some LMT-Cs, and the presence of satellites at many of them, suggested that many of these terminal structures might establish synaptic contacts with more than one postsynaptic CA 3 pyramidal neuron. Indeed, a detailed analysis provided clear evidence of individual LMT-Cs in contact with more than one CA3 pyramidal neuron (Figure 1A; Movies S1 and S2). This was not only true for the different LMTs belonging to an LMT-C, but also for large individual LMTs (Figure 1A). In addition to this unexpected local divergence of the outputs by one LMT-C onto distinct pyramidal neurons, we also found clear evidence for extensive convergence of distinct LMT-C inputs onto individual thorny excrescence clusters (Figure 1B). We conclude that LMT-Cs are local terminal arborization structures of mossy fibers exhibiting dramatic differences in their sizes, complexities, and divergence onto CA3 pyramidal neurons in adult mice.Figure 3Experience-Related Increase in the Complexity of LMT-CsShow full caption(A) Quantitative analysis of LMT size distributions in the different EE protocols.

Scale bars, 15 μm (B) and 2 μm (C). We next wondered whether the dramatic complexities and differences among LMT-Cs are present to a similar extent throughout life, or whether LMT-Cs might undergo systematic alterations with maturation and during adulthood. A comparison of LMTs from the same regions of hippocampal CA3, but from mice of different ages, revealed clear differences in the size distributions of these presynaptic terminal structures, with a selective shift to larger sizes with increasing age (Figures 2A–2C). The mGFP construct labeled mossy fibers and LMT-Cs with remarkable and comparable homogeneity throughout life (Figure S3), arguing against the possibility that these LMT size shifts might reflect systematic distortions of the imaging data set. Interestingly, the shifts in LMT sizes did not affect all LMT size groups equally: while a large fraction (50%–80%, depending on age) of LMTs was relatively small (volumes equivalent to 1–3 subunits of 3 μm diameter) at any age, the remaining LMTs shifted to larger sizes, and the average sizes of the largest 5%–10% among them grew dramatically with age (Figure 2B). Remarkably, this gradual age-related growth of larger LMTs was not confined to any particular period of life, but instead continued throughout life, including old age (Figure 2B). This was not accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the average density of LMTs (average densities of LMTs per [92 × 92 × 7.5 μm] volumes of CA3a, normalized per mGFP-positive granule cell on the same section were: 1.14 ± 0.12 [3 months], 1.18 ± 0.20 [6 months], 1.37 ± 0.15 [16 months], 1.34 ± 0.18 [22 months]; n = 8 sections, 16 volumes, from two mice each; range of 21–42 LMTs per volume), arguing against the possibility that the higher contribution of the larger LMTs to the total volume of LMTs with increasing age was due to a corresponding loss of smaller LMTs. A detailed comparison of larger LMTs at different ages revealed that the predominant contributions to their increase in size were longitudinal extensions, which were oriented transversal to the mossy fiber projection (Figure 2C). This was reflected in a gradual increase in LMT long-to-short axis ratio values with increasing age (Figure 2C). High-resolution analysis suggested that this reflected an expansion of the stretch of CA3 pyramidal neuron dendrite occupied by individual, larger LMTs (Figure 2C). Taken together, these results provide evidence that, in the mouse, there is a continuous net growth of the largest subpopulations of LMTs throughout life, and that this growth mainly involves the expansion of LMT subsets along pyramidal neuron dendrites in CA3. This relationship between age and LMT size distributions was detected consistently among BalbC × C57/Bl6 mice grown under standard housing conditions, suggesting that it reflects the impact of a life-long developmental mechanism in the hippocampus. To investigate the possibility that experience might influence LMT-C size distributions and/or complexities, we analyzed LMTs of mice housed under enriched environment (EE) conditions known to promote brain and hippocampal plasticity (van Praag et al., 2000van Praag H. Kempermann G. Gage F.H. Neural consequences of environmental enrichment.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1798) Google Scholar), and compared them to those of littermates kept under standard housing (Ctrl) conditi"

We generated transgenic mouse lines in which projections from multiple populations of VNO neurons, each expressing a distinct V1R, are differentially labeled with fluorescent proteins. This approach revealed that inputs from neurons expressing closely related V1Rs intermingle within shared, spatially conserved domains of the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB). Mitral cell-glomerular connectivity was examined by injecting intracellular dyes into AOB mitral cells and monitoring dendritic contacts with genetically labeled glomeruli. We show that individual mitral cells extend dendrites to glomeruli associated with different, but likely closely related, V1Rs. This organization differs from the labeled line of OR signaling in the main olfactory system and suggests that integration of information may already occur at the level of the AOB."

The barrier had relatively low rupture speed, slip, and aftershock density as compared to its surroundings, and the time of the main energy release in the earthquake coincided with the barrier's rupture.

https://openalex.org/W2128359245,"The initial migration of motor growth cones from the spinal cord into the periphery requires extrinsic cues, yet their identities are largely unknown. In zebrafish diwanka mutants, motor growth cones are motile but fail to pioneer into the periphery. Here, we report on the positional cloning of diwanka and show that it encodes LH3, a myotomally expressed multifunctional enzyme with lysyl hydroxylase and glycosyltransferase domains. Cloning, expression analysis, and ubiquitous overexpression of other LH family members reveals that only diwanka (lh3) possesses a critical role in growth cone migration. We show that this unique role depends critically on the LH3 glycosyltransferase domain, and provide compelling evidence that diwanka (lh3) acts through myotomal type XVIII collagen, a ligand for neural-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases that guide motor axons. Together, our results provide the first genetic evidence that glycosyltransferase modifications of the ECM play a critical role during vertebrate motor axon migration."

https://openalex.org/W1978969691,"The ERK/MAP kinase cascade is important for long-term memory formation and synaptic plasticity, with a myriad of upstream signals converging upon ERK activation. Despite this convergence of signaling, neurons routinely activate appropriate biological responses to different stimuli. Scaffolding proteins represent a mechanism to achieve compartmentalization of signaling and the appropriate targeting of ERK-dependent processes. We report that kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR1) functions biochemically in the hippocampus to scaffold the components of the ERK cascade, specifically regulating the cascade when a membrane fraction of ERK is activated via a PKC-dependent pathway but not via a cAMP/PKA-dependent pathway. Specificity of KSR1-dependent signaling also extends to specific downstream targets of ERK. Behaviorally and physiologically, we found that the absence of KSR1 leads to deficits in associative learning and theta burst stimulation-induced LTP. Our report provides novel insight into the endogenous scaffolding role of KSR1 in controlling kinase activation within the nervous system."

Connexins, the basic building blocks of gap junctions, are expressed in most mammalian tissues including the developing and adult central nervous system. During brain development, connexins are temporally and spatially regulated suggesting they play an important role in the proper formation of the central nervous system. In the current study, connexins 32 and 43 were overexpressed in PC12 cells to determine whether connexins are involved in neuronal differentiation. Both connexin 32 and 43 were appropriately trafficked to the cell membrane following overexpression and resulted in the formation of functional gap junctions. Connexin overexpression was found to cause enhanced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells treated with nerve growth factor to initiate neuritogenesis. Surprisingly, however, enhanced neurite outgrowth was found to be the consequence of functional hemichannel formation as opposed to traditional intercellular communication. Additional analysis revealed that ATP was released into the media likely through hemichannels and acted on purinergic receptors to cause enhanced neurite outgrowth. Collectively, the results of the current study suggest that connexins may play an important role in neuronal differentiation by non-traditional mechanisms.

Collectively, the results of the current study suggest that connexins may play an important role in neuronal differentiation by non-traditional mechanisms. Gap junctions form transmembrane channels through the plasma membranes of adjacent cells providing an intercellular link from the cytoplasm of one cell to the next. Traditionally, gap junctions were thought to mediate cell-cell communication through the cytoplasmic exchange of molecules such as Ca2+ and ATP (1Bruzzone R. White T.W. Paul D.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have shown that gap junctions may serve additional functions within the cell including regulating gene expression and the release of small signaling molecules through hemichannels directly into the extracellular environment (2Goodenough D.A. Paul D.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 285-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Gap junctions are composed of oligmerized connexin (Cx) 2The abbreviations used are: Cx, connexin; NGF, nerve growth factor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PC12, pheochromocytoma; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; CBX, carbenoxolone; PPADS, pyridoxal phosphate-6-azo(benzene-2,4-disulfonic acid); 2-MeSATP, 2-methylthioadenosine triphosphate; PI, propidium iodide; TrkA, tropomyosin receptor kinase A. proteins and more than 20 different mammalian Cx genes have been identified to date (3Sohl G. Willecke K. Cell Commun. Adhes. 2003; 10: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Cx genes are expressed in most mammalian tissues although not every individual Cx is expressed in every tissue. In the central nervous system, the expression of several different Cx proteins, including Cx26, 29, 30, 32, 36, 43, 45, and 47, has been reported (4Sohl G. Maxeiner S. Willecke K. Nat. Rev.

Trends Neurosci. 2005; 28: 188-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In the adult brain, specific Cx proteins tend to be enriched in particular cell types. For example, Cx43 is highly expressed in astrocytes, whereas Cx29 and Cx32 have been found in oligodendrocytes (6Rash J.E. Yasumura T. Davidson K.G. Furman C.S. Dudek F.E. Nagy J.I. Cell Commun.

Kleopa K.A. Postma F.R. Scherer S.S. Paul D.L. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6458-6470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Cx36 and Cx45 were identified as the predominant connexins expressed in adult neurons (9Sohl G. Degen J. Teubner B. Willecke K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 10Srinivas M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9848-9855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Maxeiner S. Neuroscience. 2003; 119: 689-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Deletion of either of the adult neuronal Cx genes, Cx36, or Cx45, results in deficiencies in signaling and transmission properties of neurons (12Maxeiner S. Dedek K. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 566-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Deans M.R. Volgyi B. Goodenough D.A. Bloomfield S.A. Paul D.L.

In the developing central nervous system, the role of gap junctions in neurons or cells destined to become neurons is less clear. Studies have shown that Cx genes such as Cx32 and Cx43 are highly expressed in the developing brain and that distinct regional and temporal expression patterns are formed by different Cx proteins (15Belliveau D.J. Kidder G.M. Naus C.C. Dev. Genet. 1991; 12: 308-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 16Belliveau D.J. Naus C.C. Dev.

For example, in the developing neocortex, Cx32 protein expression is most abundant in the later stages of development and found to be localized in areas of myelinated axons and clusters of developing neurons (16Belliveau D.J. Naus C.C. Dev. Neurosci. 1995; 17: 81-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 19Nadarajah B. Jones A.M. Evans W.H. Parnavelas J.G. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3096-3111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cx43, in contrast, is expressed throughout cortical development in both neurons and radial glia (16Belliveau D.J. Naus C.C. Dev. Neurosci. 1995; 17: 81-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 19Nadarajah B. Jones A.M. Evans W.H. Parnavelas J.G. J.

Radial glia were classically thought to provide a temporary structural framework for neuronal migration. However, recent evidence suggests that radial glia are in fact neuronal progenitor cells that later become excitatory cortical neurons (21Noctor S.C. Flint A.C. Weissman T.A. Dammerman R.S. Kriegstein A.R. Nature. 2001; 409: 714-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar, 22Malatesta P. Hartfuss E. Gotz M.

Neuron. 2003; 37: 751-764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the extracellular release of ATP via Cx hemichannels in radial glia was shown to promote cortical neural progenitor cell proliferation (24Weissman T.A. Riquelme P.A. Ivic L. Flint A.C. Kriegstein A.R. Neuron. 2004; 43: 647-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Cx32 and Cx43 were also found to be temporally regulated in dopaminergic neurons of the midbrain at times that coincided with the development of the forebrain dopaminergic projection system (18Leung D.S.Y. Unsicker K. Reuss B. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 2002; 20: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Collectively, the results suggest that Cx proteins may play an important role in proper central nervous system development including the migration and development of neurons. Consistent with the premise that Cx proteins may play a prominent role in neuronal development, several recent studies conducted in vitro have demonstrated that connexins and gap junctions affect neuronal differentiation. For example, human NT2/D1 and rat P19 cells can be differentiated to obtain neurons using retinoic acid (25McBurney M.W. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1993; 37: 135-140PubMed Google Scholar, 26Andrews P.W. Dev. Biol. 1984; 103: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Both cell lines express Cx43 and are coupled (27Bani-Yaghoub M. Bechberger J.F. Naus C.C. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 28Belliveau D.J. Bechberger J.F. Rogers K.A. Naus C.C. Dev. Genet. 1997; 21: 187-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Treatment of NT2 and P19 cells with 18 α-glycyrrhetinic acid or carbenoxolone to block connexon channels resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of mature neurons following retinoic acid differentiation (29Bani-Yaghoub M. Bechberger J.F. Underhill T.M. Naus C.C. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 156: 16-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 30Bani-Yaghoub M. Underhill T.M. Naus C.C. Dev. Genet. 1999; 24: 69-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To help further elucidate the role of Cx genes in neuronal differentiation, Cx32 and Cx43 were overexpressed in PC12 (pheochromocytoma) cells. PC12 cells are neural crest-derived cells that can be differentiated to form neurons following treatment with nerve growth factor (NGF) (31Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4873) Google Scholar). The advantage of PC12 cells compared with other cell lines is that they only form neurons and not other neural cell types upon NGF differentiation. Furthermore, they do not contain appreciable levels of Cx32 or Cx43 (10Srinivas M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9848-9855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Lynn B.D. Marotta C.A. Nagy J.I. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 199: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and are readily infected with retroviral constructs (33Cushing P. Bhalla P. Johnson A. Rushlow W.J. Meakin S.O. Belliveau D.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 82: 788-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Overexpressed Cx32 or Cx43 is trafficked appropriately in PC12 cells resulting in functional gap junction formation. In the current study we report that constitutive expression of Cx32 or Cx43 in PC12 cells resulted in enhanced neurite outgrowth upon treatment with NGF. Enhanced neurite outgrowth is the consequence of hemichannel formation and the release of ATP into the extracellular milieu. Collectively the results suggest that Cx genes may play an important role in the process of neuronal differentiation. Cell Culture—PC12 cells obtained from ATCC were maintained in high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, and penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a 37 °C humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. For all of the differentiation assays, PC12 cells were treated with NGF (50 ng/ml) in defined media (DMEM containing N2 supplement and penicillin/streptomycin). The NGF and N2 media were replaced every 2 days. All of the media, serum, and supplements used throughout the study were obtained from Invitrogen unless otherwise noted. Cells were grown on Corning tissue culture plates and NGF was obtained from Cedarlane Laboratories (Hornby, Ontario). The 293GPG retroviral packaging cell line (34Ory D.S. Neugeboren B.A. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11400-11406Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. Richard C. Mulligan (Children's Hospital, Boston, MA). The packaging cells were maintained in high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1.0 μg/ml tetracycline (Sigma), 2.0 μg/ml puromycin, and 0.3 μg/ml geneticin in a humidified 37 °C incubator containing 5% CO2. Constructs and Generation of Retrovirus—The Cx32, Cx32-EGFP, Cx43, Cx43-EGFP, and EGFP constructs were generated through directional subcloning of the cDNAs of interest into the AP2 vector with the original IRES EGFP site excised. Orientation of the inserts was confirmed by bidirectional sequencing and high quality cDNA necessary to generate virus obtained from transformed bacteria using a Qiagen Midiprep Kit (Mississauga, Ontario). Retrovirus containing Cx, Cx-EGFP, or EGFP was generated as previously described (35Mao J. Bechberger J. Galipeau J. Naus C.C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34407-34414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293GPG packaging cells were plated at a density of 6 × 106 cells/100-mm cell culture plate overnight and then transfected with the constructs of interest using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). OPTI-MEM I media (3 ml total volume) supplemented with 1 μg/ml of tetracycline was used during the transfection procedure in place of serum containing medium. After 6 h, PC12 media supplemented with 1 μg/ml of tetracycline was added to the plates and the cells were left overnight in the incubator. The following day, the medium was replaced with fresh PC12 medium (without tetracycline) to allow the cells to begin to generate virus. The medium was collected and filtered every 24 h using a 0.45-μm syringe-mounted filter (Gelman Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI), then stored at –80 °C. After the final collection, medium was thawed, pooled, aliquoted, tested, and stored at –80 °C until needed. The AP2 retroviral vector was kindly provided by Dr. J. P. Galipeau (Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Montreal, PQ) (36Galipeau J. Benaim E. Spencer H.T. Blakley R.L. Sorrentino B.P. Hum. Gene Ther. 1997; 8: 1773-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The Cx43 cDNA (1.45 Kb) was kindly provided by Dr. E. Beyer (University of Chicago, Chicago, IL) and the Cx32 and Cx43 EGFP-tagged cDNAs were a generous gift from Dr. D. Laird (The University of Western Ontario, London, ON). Additional virus containing media prepared using Cx43-G21R and Cx43-G138R mutant constructs was generously provided by Dr. D. Laird. The G21R and G138R mutants are able to traffic to the membrane appropriately but are unable to form functional Cx43 channels (37Roscoe W. Veitch G.I.L. Gong X.-Q. Pellegrino E. Bai D. McLachlan E.

Confirmation of Expression and Infection Efficiency—To estimate infection efficiency, PC12 cells were plated at a density of 5 × 106 cells on collagen type I (10 μg/ml)-coated 60-mm plates containing glass coverslips the day prior to infection. The following day, cells were infected with EGFP, Cx32, Cx32-EGFP, Cx43, or Cx43-EGFP retrovirus for 48 h and then fixed with 70% ethanol containing 0.15 m NaCl at room temperature for 10 min. Cx32 and Cx43 proteins were detected using immunocytochemistry with anti-Cx32 (Zymed Laboratories Inc., 1:200) or anti-Cx43 (Zymed Laboratories Inc., 1:100) monoclonal antibodies, respectively. Cx32 and Cx43 were visualized using Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen, 1:200). All of the infected cells were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (100 ng/ml) to visualize nuclei and aid in the quantification of infection efficiency. The coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Images were captured from 5 fields on an Axiovert S100 microscope (Zeiss). The number of cells expressing the retroviral protein was determined and expressed as a percentage of the total number of cells. The experiments were conducted in 5 separate replicates using the same lot of virus. In addition to determining infection efficiency, Cx32-EGFP- or Cx43-EGFP-infected cells were also stained using immunocytochemistry for Cx32 and Cx43, respectively, to determine whether the pattern of immunostaining and EGFP labeling matched. To confirm appropriate expression of Cx, protein was extracted from native PC12 cells, PC12 cells overexpressing EGFP alone, or PC12 cells overexpressing the various Cx constructs. The protein extracts were used to generate Western blots and probed for either Cx32 (Sigma; dilution 1:600) or Cx43 (Sigma; dilution 1:8000) as appropriate. Cell lysis, electrophoresis, Western blotting, and visualization of the proteins of interest were conducted as outlined previously (33Cushing P. Bhalla P. Johnson A. Rushlow W.J. Meakin S.O. Belliveau D.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 82: 788-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Microinjection and Coupling—PC12 cells were plated on collagen-coated 60-mm plates, at a density of 5 × 106 cells/plate (2 days post-infection analysis) or 2 × 106 cells/plate (96-h post-NGF treatment analysis). Cells were infected and analyzed for functional gap junction coupling 2 days post-infection (EGFP, Cx32, Cx32EGFP, Cx43, and Cx43EGFP) or 4 days following NGF treatment (EGFP, Cx32, and Cx32EGFP). Individual cells infected with Cx32 or Cx43 were pressure injected with 2.5% Lucifer Yellow, whereas cells infected with EGFP, Cx32-EGFP, or Cx43-EGFP were injected with Alexa Fluor 594 dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) using an Eppendorf microinjection system and an Axiovert S100 microscope (Zeiss). Injection time was set for 10 s. Cells were examined 1 min following dye injection to determine whether dye had passed from the injected cell to neighboring cells. Cells were considered to be coupled if the injected cell passed dye to at least one adjacent cell. The percentage of coupled cells was defined as the [number of cells that passed dye divided by the total number of injected cells] × 100. The order of coupling was determined by counting the number of cells receiving dye from the injected cell, to the farthest cell that received dye. Neurite Outgrowth of PC12 Cells—Cells were plated at a density of 8 × 104 cells/plate (60 mm, collagen coated) and infected the following day with EGFP, Cx32, Cx32-EGFP, Cx43, Cx43-EGFP, Cx43-G21R, or Cx43-G138R retrovirus. Two days post-infection the cells were treated with NGF (50 ng/ml) in N2-supplemented DMEM (Invitrogen). NGF and media were refreshed every second day. The number of neurites and neurite length was examined 2 days following infection (time 0) and at 1, 2, 3, and 4 days after the commencement of NGF. After each time point the cells were fixed using 70% ethanol containing 0.15 m NaCl and analyzed using an Axiovert S100 microscope and Northern eclipse software. Neurite length was measured in terms of the number of cell body widths. For quantification of the number of neurites, a neurite was defined as an extension from the cell body equivalent or greater than 1× the cell body diameter (38Yip P.M. Siu C.-H. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1552-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 39Gysbers J.W. Guarnieri S. Mariggio M.A. Pietrangelo T. Fano G. Rathbone M.P. Neuroscience. 2000; 96: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 40Gysbers J.W. Rathbone M.P. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 220: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Quantification of neurite length and the number of neurites was performed by examining 20 fields of cells, in five separate experimental replicates. Data were analyzed using an analysis of variance followed by Tukey's Multiple Comparison Test. Results obtained from measuring neurite length suggested that overexpression of Cx proteins alone was sufficient to cause some autodifferentiation of the PC12 cells. Therefore neurite outgrowth in Cx-infected PC12 cells untreated with NGF was further evaluated. Cells were infected with EGFP, Cx32, Cx32-EGFP, Cx43, or Cx43-EGFP retrovirus, and neurite length was measured 48, 72, and 120 h following infection (48 h = time 0 in the NGF experiments). Co-culture Experiments—Microinjection experiments using the Cx32-EGFP and Cx43-EGFP constructs revealed that only cells expressing the Cx proteins were functionally coupled. However, during analysis of neurite length it was observed that all PC12 cells measured from the Cx-infected culture plates showed enhanced neurite outgrowth although ∼20% of the cells appeared not to express Cx as determined by the transfection efficiency analysis. To evaluate the possibility that gap junctions might cause enhanced neurite outgrowth by a mechanism other than intercellular communication, PC12 cells were infected with EGFP, Cx32-EGFP, or Cx43-EGFP. Two days post-infection the cells were lifted, counted, and re-plated as co-cultures of EGFP and Cx32-EGFP or EGFP and Cx43-EGFP (1:1). The cells were then treated with NGF for 0, 24, or 96 h and neurite length was measured in EGFP and Cx-EGFP expressing cells. Treatment of PC12 with ATP Receptor Agonists and Antagonists—Results of the co-culture experiments indicated that enhanced neurite outgrowth associated with Cx overexpression is likely mediated by a diffusible factor in the media. Because gap junctions are known to allow the passage of ATP and purinergic receptors can regulate neurite outgrowth (41D'Ambrosi N. Murra B. Cavaliere F. Amadio S. Bernardi G. Burnstock G. Volonte C. Neuroscience. 2001; 108: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 42Stout C.E. Costantin J.L. Naus C.C. Charles A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10482-10488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar), ATP agonists and antagonists were examined to determine whether they could affect neurite outgrowth. PC12 cells were treated with either ATP or 2-methylthioadenosine triphosphate (2-MeSATP, P2Y agonist) to determine whether either purinergic receptor agonists could induce neurite growth in the presence of NGF. For these experiments, PC12 cells were plated as indicated previously and infected with EGFP, Cx32-EGFP, or Cx43-EGFP (for direct comparison). EGFP-infected cells were treated with ATP (10 μm), 2-MeSATP, or vehicle (water). Following 48 h of treatment, the medium was replaced with N2-supplemented DMEM containing 50 ng/ml NGF. Neurite length was measured prior to the addition of NGF as well as 24 and 96 h following addition of NGF. For the antagonist experiments, the cells were infected with EGFP, Cx32-EGFP, or Cx43-EGFP as outlined above. One experimental replicate was treated with virus alone, whereas the other two replicates received virus plus 100 μm suramin (P2X, P2Y antagonist) or virus plus pyridoxal phosphate-6-azo(benzene-2,4-disulfonic acid) (PPADS, P2 antagonist). Forty-eight hours post-infection, NGF (50 ng/ml) was added to the cells and the length of the neurites was measured prior to the addition of NGF (day 0) and 24 and 96 h following addition of NGF. ATP Measurements—To determine whether ATP was released from the Cx-infected cells, ATP measurements were obtained from the media of EGFP-, Cx32-EGFP-, or Cx43-EGFP-infected cells. The cells were treated as previously described except that N2 media containing NGF lacked the colored indicator phenol red. Twenty-four hours post-treatment with NGF, the medium was collected, cell debris removed by centrifugation, and the conditioned media stored at –80 °C until analyzed. Because overexpression of Cx32 and Cx43 in the absence of NGF caused some limited autodifferentiation 48 h post-infection (undetectable by 96 h), media was also collected from non-NGF-treated cells 48 and 96 h following infection with the control and Cx constructs. Relative ATP measurements were obtained using an ATP assay kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Statistical analysis was conducted using an analysis of variance followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test (n = 4 × 2 experimental replicates, p < 0.05). Conditioned Media and Apyrase Treatment—To further confirm that ATP (as opposed to gap junctions) was responsible for the observed enhancement of neurite outgrowth, cells were grown and infected with EGFP, Cx32-EGFP, or Cx43-EGFP overnight. The virus containing media was removed and the cells were gently washed with DMEM three times to remove any residual virus. Serum-free media (DMEM + N2) was then added and the cells were allowed to condition the media for 48 h. The conditioned media was then collected and stored frozen at –80 °C until needed. Untreated PC12 cells were plated as described for the neurite outgrowth studies but not infected. Instead, conditioned media was mixed 1:1 with fresh media and NGF added. Forty-eight hours following the addition of the conditioned media containing NGF, neurite outgrowth was measured as outlined above. As an additional control, NGF was added to native untreated PC12 cells and neurite length was measured after 48 h in parallel with the conditioned media-treated cells to ensure that media nutrient depletion did not affect neurite outgrowth. In addition, some of the conditioned media was treated with apyrase (Sigma; 0.25 units/ml) to degrade ATP prior to adding it to the cells. Finally, the cells treated with the conditioned media were carefully examined using a fluorescence microscope to ensure that there was no inadvertent transfer of virus and subsequent infection of the native PC12 cells. Protein was also extracted from some additional cells treated with the conditioned media and tested for Cx32-EGFP and Cx43-EGFP expression by Western blotting (data not shown). Blocking Cx43 Channels—To demonstrate that functional Cx hemichannels are necessary for enhanced neurite outgrowth, PC12 cells were infected with EGFP, Cx32, or Cx43 as outlined previously. Forty-eight hours post-infection, NGF (50 ng/ml) was added along with either the gap junction channel blocker carbenoxolone (CBX, 100 μm) or the control compound glycyrrhizic acid (100 μm). Carbenoxolone is known to inhibit Cx hemichannels (43Ye Z.-C. Wyeth M.S. Baltan-Tekkok S. Ransom B.R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3588-3596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Kamermans M. Fahrenfort I. Schultz K. Janssen-Bienhold U. Sjoerdsma T. Weiler R. Science. 2001; 292: 1178-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Neurite outgrowth was quantified 24 h post-treatment. PC12 cells were also infected with two mutant Cx43-EGFP constructs (G21R or G138R) and neurite outgrowth was measured 24 h post-NGF treatment and compared with EGFP and Cx43-EGFP-infected cells treated with NGF. Dye Uptake Assays—To determine whether Cx overexpression (i.e. autodifferentiation) and NGF treatment had a functional effect on hemichannels, propidium iodide (PI) uptake assays were conducted. PC12 cells were treated with EGFP, Cx32, and/or Cx43 viral containing media for 12 h. The infection media was replaced with N2 media for 36 h and then replaced once again with fresh N2 media with or without NGF added for an additional 48 h. Consequently, EGFP- and Cx43-infected cells untreated with NGF were obtained 48 h post-infection and EGFP-, Cx32-, and Cx43-infected cells treated and untreated with NGF were obtained 96 h post-infection (48 h post-NGF treatment). Following treatment, PI (1 mg/ml final concentration) was added directly to the N2 media for 15 min. The cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde, rinsed, and examined using a Zeiss Axiovert microscope. Images of representative fields were captured using a Sony 3CCD camera and Northern Eclipse Software (Empix Imaging). Changes in PI labeling intensity were quantified using Kodak Molecular Imaging software and analyzed statistically using an analysis of variance followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test (n = 4 × 3 fields/replicate, p < 0.05). Cx32 and Cx43 Overexpression and the Formation of Gap Junctions—Native PC12 cells and cells infected with EGFP alone did not express any detectable levels of either Cx32 or Cx43 proteins. However, PC12 cells infected with Cx32, Cx32-EGFP, Cx43, or Cx43-EGFP retrovirus expressed readily detectable levels of Cx protein of the appropriate Mr (Fig. 1A). Cells infected with Cx or Cx-EGFP fusion proteins and examined histologically using immunofluorescence to detect Cx43 or Cx32 revealed abundant labeling and the expected staining pattern (Fig. 1B). For example, cells infected with Cx43-EGFP showed labeling in the cytoplasm and between adjacent cells when viewed using confocal microscopy (Fig. 1C). Cells infected with Cx43-EGFP or Cx32-EGFP and double labeled using immunofluorescence for Cx43 or Cx32 showed an overlapping distribution that was virtually identical (data not shown). Overexpression of the Cx, Cx-EGFP, or EGFP alone did not cau"
https://openalex.org/W2036258428,"Visinin-like protein-1 (VILIP-1) is a member of the neuronal Ca2+ sensor protein family that modulates Ca2+-dependent cell signaling events. VILIP-1, which is expressed primarily in the brain, increases cAMP formation in neural cells by modulating adenylyl cyclase, but its functional role in other tissues remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that VILIP-1 is expressed in murine pancreatic islets and β-cells. To gain insight into the functions of VILIP-1 in β-cells, we used both overexpression and small interfering RNA knockdown strategies. Overexpression of VILIP-1 in the MIN6β-cell line or isolated mouse islets had no effect on basal insulin secretion but significantly increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. cAMP accumulation was elevated in VILIP-1-overexpressing cells, and the protein kinase A inhibitor H-89 attenuated increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Overexpression of VILIP-1 in isolated mouse β-cells increased cAMP content accompanied by increased cAMP-responsive element-binding protein gene expression and enhanced exocytosis as detected by cell capacitance measurements. Conversely, VILIP-1 knockdown by small interfering RNA caused a reduction in cAMP accumulation and produced a dramatic increase in preproinsulin mRNA, basal insulin secretion, and total cellular insulin content. The increase in preproinsulin mRNA in these cells was attributed to enhanced insulin gene transcription. Taken together, we have shown that VILIP-1 is expressed in pancreatic β-cells and modulates insulin secretion. Increased VILIP-1 enhanced insulin secretion in a cAMP-associated manner. Down-regulation of VILIP-1 was accompanied by decreased cAMP accumulation but increased insulin gene transcription.

Gundelfinger E.D. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 295: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The NCS family consists of ∼40 members in different species divided into five subfamilies (1Braunewell K.-H. Gundelfinger E.D. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 295: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Group III, the VILIP family, includes VILIP-1, VILIP-2, VILIP-3, hippocalcin, and neurocalcin-δ (1Braunewell K.-H. Gundelfinger E.D. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 295: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). NCS family members possess four EF-hand Ca2+-binding motifs. Calcium binding leads to a conformational change in the proteins, a mechanism termed the Ca2+-myristoyl switch, which facilitates their association with lipid bilayers (2Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The NCS proteins are reported to have a variety of biological functions. These include involvement in the modulation of voltage-gated Ca2+ and A-type K+ channels (3An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W.

Neurochem. 2005; 92: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). VILIP-1 was first cloned from a rat brain cDNA library (9Kuno T. Kajimoto Y. Hashimoto T. Mukai H. Shirai Y. Saheki S. Tanaka C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 1219-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and at the protein level, it was shown to have 100% homology to human visinin-like peptide-1 (10Polymeropoulos M.H. Ide S. Soares M.B. Lennon G.G. Genomics. 1995; 29: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To date, studies on VILIP-1 have focused primarily on its role in neurons. Some of these studies have demonstrated Ca2+-dependent association with plasma membranes (11Lin L. Braunewell K.-H. Gundelfinger E.D. Anand R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 12Spilker C. Dresbach T. Braunewell K.-H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7331-7339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Golgi membranes (12Spilker C. Dresbach T. Braunewell K.-H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7331-7339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which might be a mechanism for the coordinated regulation of signaling cascades. Furthermore, in a human embryonic kidney cell line (tsA201), VILIP-1 has been shown to increase cell-surface expression of α4- and β2-subunits of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which belongs to a superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels (13Lin L. Jeanclos E.M. Treuil M. Braunewell K.-H. Gundelfinger E.D. Anand R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41872-41878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In addition, VILIP-1 has modulatory effects on signaling of cAMP and cGMP in neuronal and peripheral cells (11Lin L. Braunewell K.-H. Gundelfinger E.D. Anand R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14Brackmann M. Schuchmann S. Anand R. Braunewell K.-H. J.

Cell Biol. 1997; 72: 151-158PubMed Google Scholar). VILIP-1 has also been shown to increase cGMP levels in transfected C6 and PC12 cells by directly acting on guanylyl cyclase (17Braunewell K.-H. Brackmann M. Schaupp M. Spilker C. Anand R. Gundelfinger E.D. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 1277-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that VILIP-1 modulates the activity of the receptor, guanylyl cyclase B, through clathrin-dependent receptor cycling, supporting a general physiological role for VILIP-1 in membrane trafficking within the central nervous system (14Brackmann M. Schuchmann S. Anand R. Braunewell K.-H. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2495-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition, VILIP-1 has been shown to bind double-stranded RNA as a protein-RNA complex for regulating the stability and localization of specific mRNAs, implicating its role in the regulation of gene expression (19Mathisen P.M. Johnson J.M. Kawczak J.A. Tuohy V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31571-31576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). VILIP-1 is expressed primarily in the brain, but lower expression has also been found in some peripheral organs, including the heart, testes, ovaries, and colon (20Gierke P. Zhao C. Brackmann M. Linke B. Heinemann U. Braunewell K.-H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although many studies have reported on the biological functions of VILIP-1 in neurons, very little information is available regarding physiological roles in other tissues. In MIN6 cells, however, expression profiling of fatty acid-responsive genes has shown that oleic acid can significantly induce expression of VILIP-1 (21Wang X. Li H. De Leo D. Guo W. Koshkin V. Fantus I.G. Giacca A. Chan C.B. Der S. Wheeler M.B. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified VILIP-1 in mouse pancreatic islets, and using overexpression and small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown strategies, we determined that VILIP-1 can regulate insulin secretion and insulin gene transcription. This study provides the first evidence that VILIP-1 plays a functional role in pancreatic β-cells. Reagents—The polyclonal antibody to VILIP-1 (rabbit anti-serum) and the vector harboring the full-length cDNA of VILIP-1 or the fusion protein VILIP-1-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) have been described previously (12Spilker C. Dresbach T. Braunewell K.-H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7331-7339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Braunewell K.-H. Spilker C. Behnisch T. Gundelfinger E.D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2129-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Vectors expressing SNAP25 (synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa) and syntaxin-1A in mammalian cells were described in previous studies (22Kang Y. Leung Y.M. Manning-Fox J.E. Xia F. Xie H. Sheu L.

The constructs of firefly luciferase driven by the rat insulin I promoter and Renilla luciferase driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter were gifts from Dr. Donald Fleenor (Duke University). The vector expressing NCS-1 protein was kindly provided by Dr. John Roder (Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto). Bovine serum albumin, oleic acid, H-89, forskolin, ionomycin, collagenase V, dispase II, rabbit polyclonal antibody against β-actin, and mouse monoclonal antibodies against syntaxin-1A and SNAP25 were products of Sigma. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against cellular subfractionation marker proteins annexin II, caveolin-1, and lamin A/C were obtained from Clontech. Guinea pig anti-insulin and mouse anti-glucagon antibodies were from Dako. Fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Cy5-conjugated secondary antibody was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Lipofectamine 2000, TRIzol, SuperScript II RNase H reverse transcriptase, ROX reference dye, SYBR Green dye, and Platinum Taq were purchased from Invitrogen. The cAMP assay kit was obtained from Biomedical Technologies, Inc. (Stoughton, MA). The Dual-Luciferase reporter assay kit was from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). The siRNA duplex was designed using the program provided by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA), and the synthesis and high pressure liquid chromatography purification of the siRNAs were performed by the same company. The fluorescein-conjugated scrambled siRNA was from Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). The Qproteome compartment kit was purchased from Qiagen Inc. Cell Culture—MIN6 cells (a gift from Dr. S. Seino, Chiba University), α-TC6 cells (kindly provided by Dr. Y. Moriyama, Okayama University), and HEK293 cells (purchased from American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown in monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2). Cells were passaged every 4-5 days at 80% confluence. Mouse Islet Isolation and Treatment—Mouse islets were isolated from male FVB/N mice (∼2 months of age) as described previously (24Joseph J.W. Koshkin V. Saleh M.C. Sivitz W.I. Zhang C.Y. Lowell B.B. Chan C.B. Wheeler M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51049-51056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To obtain single islet cells, these intact mouse islets were dispersed in dispase II solution (0.6-2.4 units/ml) for 5 min and loaded onto glass coverslips after being washed with culture medium. The intact islets and single islet cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 11.1 mm glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin for 24 h before being assayed. Construction and Expression of siRNAs, Viruses, and Plasmids—The sequences of the siRNA duplex targeted to VILIP-1 were 5′-GAACAAAGAUGACCAGAUUTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAUCUGGUCAUCUUUGUUCTT-3′ (antisense), corresponding to nucleotides 480-498 of mouse VILIP-1 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number D21165). The oligonucleotide sequences were subjected to a BLAST search, and no significant identity to other sequences was detected. The scrambled nonsense siRNA duplex sequences used as a negative control in MIN6 cells were 5′-UCAGAGUCUCGCAAUCACGTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGUGAUUGCGAGACUCUGATT-3′ (antisense) as described (25Mitchell K.J. Tsuboi T. Rutter G.A. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The control duplex showed no significant homology to any known protein as assessed using the BLAST and NCBI Databases. VILIP-1 down-regulation was obtained by transfecting cells with the siRNA duplex (referred to as V1-siRNA) using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. 100 pmol of siRNA complexed by 5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 was used in 1 ml of medium. Fluorescein-conjugated siRNA duplex was used for cotransfection with V1-siRNA or scrambled siRNA to identify cells incorporated with the siRNA duplex. The full-length cDNA of VILIP-1-EGFP was subcloned into a cytomegalovirus promoter-driven adenoviral vector (AdLox.HTM) via HindIII and XbaI, yielding Ad-VILIP-1-EGFP. The virus was created according to the protocol described previously (26Chan C.B. MacDonald P.E. Saleh M.C. Johns D.C. Marban E. Wheeler M.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Recombinant adenovirus particles of Ad-VILIP-1-EGFP or the control virus (Ad-EGFP) produced after recombination were amplified by passage in CRE8 cells as described (26Chan C.B. MacDonald P.E. Saleh M.C. Johns D.C. Marban E. Wheeler M.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Recombinant adenovirus particles (∼1010 plaque-forming units/ml) were used to infect isolated mouse islets (multiplicity of infection of 104, assuming 103 β-cells/islet). Overexpression of VILIP-1 in MIN6 or single islet cells was achieved by transfection of VILIP-1-EGFP using Lipofectamine 2000 (27Gromada J. Bark C. Smidt K. Efanov A.M. Janson J. Mandic S.A. Webb D.L. Zhang W. Meister B. Jeromin A. Berggren P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10303-10308Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and that in intact mouse islets by adenoviral transduction. A pilot study with the control virus Ad-EGFP demonstrated that 70-80% of the cells in islets were infected as detected by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Evaluation of Insulin Secretion and Content in MIN6 Cells and Mouse Islets—MIN6 cells were seeded into 24-well plates and incubated for 48-72 h before glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) studies. Cells were preincubated for 1 h in glucose-free Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer (125 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 1.28 mm CaCl2, 5.0 mm NaCO3, 25 mm HEPES, and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) in a 37 °C humidified incubator. The cells were then incubated in the same buffer containing 2.8 mm (basal concentration) or 20 mm (stimulatory concentration) glucose for 1 h or 20 mm glucose with 20 mm arginine for 5 min. Islets (10/condition) were preincubated for two sequential 30-min periods in Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer and for 2 h at the indicated glucose concentration (either 2.8 or 20 mm) (24Joseph J.W. Koshkin V. Saleh M.C. Sivitz W.I. Zhang C.Y. Lowell B.B. Chan C.B. Wheeler M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51049-51056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The supernatants of the cells were collected and centrifuged at 300 g × for 10 min to remove cell debris for insulin secretion assessment, and the cell pellets were lysed with acid ethanol (75% ethanol containing 1.5% (v/v) HCl) for DNA quantification or insulin content assessment (21Wang X. Li H. De Leo D. Guo W. Koshkin V. Fantus I.G. Giacca A. Chan C.B. Der S. Wheeler M.B. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The insulin concentration in the supernatant or cell lysate was measured by radioimmunoassay as described previously (28Brubaker P.L. Lee Y.C. Drucker D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20728-20733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The insulin secretion data were normalized by total DNA content. Measurement of Intracellular cAMP Content—Intracellular cAMP was measured as described previously (29Salapatek A.M. MacDonald P.E. Gaisano H.Y. Wheeler M.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1305-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed with cold Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer after removal of the supernatant. Intracellular cAMP was extracted with 80% ethanol and resuspended in cAMP assay buffer (0.05 mm sodium acetate (pH 6.2) and 0.01% sodium azide) and measured by radioimmunoassay using an intracellular cAMP assay kit. Quantitative Real-time PCR—Total RNA was extracted from MIN6 cells using TRIzol reagent and further purified with RNeasy kits according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified RNA was converted to cDNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase, and real-time PCR was performed using an ABI PRISM 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the same protocol described previously (21Wang X. Li H. De Leo D. Guo W. Koshkin V. Fantus I.G. Giacca A. Chan C.B. Der S. Wheeler M.B. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Primer Express Version 2.0 (Applied Biosystems) was used to design primers for real-time PCR. Platinum Taq DNA polymerase reagents were used to amplify target cDNA sequences, and SYBR Green was used to quantify PCR products. A standard curve was generated using mouse genomic DNA for quantification purposes. The measurements of gene expression were normalized by β-actin transcripts in the same sample.

The assay was performed using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system. The ratio of the activity of firefly to Renilla luciferase is presented as the relative luciferase activity. Luciferase expression without an upstream promoter was taken as the basal activity. Fractionation, Immunoblotting, and Immunoprecipitation— Tissues and MIN6 cells were homogenized in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The subcellular fractionation of MIN6 cells was performed according to the protocol of the Qproteome compartment kit. Differential speed centrifugation of the lysate was implemented to obtain subcellular fractions. The supernatant from the 1000 × g centrifugation contained cytosolic proteins, that from the 6000 × g centrifugation contained membrane proteins, and that from the 6800 × g centrifugation contained nuclear proteins. The fractions or whole cell lysates were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The rabbit polyclonal antibody against VILIP-1 used for immunoblotting has been described previously (30Braunewell K.-H. Gundelfinger E.D. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 234: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The intensity of the appropriate immunoreactive bands was measured by densitometry, and the data were normalized by β-actin content as described (21Wang X. Li H. De Leo D. Guo W. Koshkin V. Fantus I.G. Giacca A. Chan C.B. Der S. Wheeler M.B. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and analyzed using image analysis software (Scion Image Version 4.02, Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (31Leung Y.M. Kang Y. Gao X. Xia F. Xie H. Sheu L. Tsuk S. Lotan I. Tsushima R.G. Gaisano H.Y. J. Biol.

Briefly, HEK293 cells transfected with the cDNA of VILIP-1, syntaxin-1, or SNAP25 were harvested in binding buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 20 μm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μm pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). After sonification and centrifugation to remove cell debris, the supernatant was incubated overnight with glutathione S-transferase (GST; negative control), GST-syntaxin-1A, or GST-SNAP25 at 4 °C with constant agitation. Fusion proteins GST-syntaxin-1A and GST-SNAP25 were prepared as described (22Kang Y. Leung Y.M. Manning-Fox J.E. Xia F. Xie H. Sheu L. Tsushima R.G. Light P.E. Gaisano H.Y. J. Biol.

The beads were washed three times with binding buffer. The eluants from the beads were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE; transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes; and identified with rabbit anti-VILIP-1 polyclonal antibody (1:5000), mouse anti-syntaxin-1A monoclonal antibody (1:1000), or mouse anti-SNAP25 monoclonal antibody (1:1000). Immunohistochemistry—Pancreases were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated, and processed for paraffin embedding using routine procedures. Sections (5 μm) were adhered to glass slides, rehydrated, and blocked with 3% H2O2 for 10 min. After being washed with phosphate-buffered saline, sections were incubated in appropriate non-immune serum (5%) for 30 min (goat for VILIP and rabbit for insulin). Sections were blotted to remove excess serum prior to overnight application of anti-insulin (1:1000) or anti-VILIP-1 (1:800) primary antibody (32Bernstein H.G. Baumann B. Danos P. Diekmann S. Bogerts B. Gundelfinger E.D. Braunewell K.-H. J. Neurocytol. 1999; 28: 655-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) at 4 °C. Positive immunostaining was detected by incubating sections with goat antirabbit or rabbit anti-guinea pig peroxidase (1:100) for VILIP-1 and insulin, respectively, for 60 min at room temperature, followed by application of diaminobenzidene/H2O2 for 8 min. Dispersed mouse islet cells on glass coverslips were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. After being washed with phosphate-buffered saline, the coverslips were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin for 2 h before overnight application of primary antibody against VILIP-1, insulin, or glucagon at 4 °C. Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody was used to detect VILIP-1; fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated rat anti-mouse and FITC donkey anti-guinea pig secondary antibodies were used to detect glucagon and insulin, respectively. The images were captured by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Capacitance Measurements—Cells expressing EGFP or exhibiting fluorescein fluorescence were selected and patch-clamped in the whole cell configuration at 33 °C. The capacitance measurements were performed using an EPC-9 amplifier and PULSE software from HEKA Elektronik (Lambrecht, Germany). Patch pipettes were pulled from 1.5-mm thin-walled borosilicate glass tubes using a two-stage Narishige micropipette puller and had typical resistances of 3-6 megaohms when fire polished and filled with an intracellular solution containing 120 mm CsCl, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.05 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm cAMP, and 5 mm MgATP, pH 7.3, with CsOH. Extracellular solutions contained 118 mm NaCl, 20 mm triethylammonium chloride, 2.6 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 5.6 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm glucose, pH 7.4, with NaOH. Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—Islets overexpressing VILIP-1-EGFP were analyzed using a Zeiss LSM-510 laser scanning confocal imaging system with a ×40 water immersion Plan Apochromat objective. Samples were subjected to optical sectioning by moving the focal plane along the vertical (z) axis. HEK293 cells transiently transfected with VILIP-1-EGFP were treated with 1 mm ionomycin in Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer. Serial images of these cells were taken every 15 s with the same apparatus. Statistics—All data are presented as the means ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were performed using Student's t test. Patch clamp data were analyzed with IGOR Pro Version 3.12 software (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Differences were considered to be significant when p < 0.05.

These biological functions are attributed to the binding of α3NC1 to integrin αvβ3. However, in some tumor cells that express integrin αvβ3, the α3NC1 domain does not inhibit proliferation, suggesting that integrin αvβ3 expression is not sufficient to mediate the anti-tumorigenic activity of this domain. Therefore, in the present study, we searched for novel binding receptors for the soluble α3NC1 domain in cells lacking αvβ3 integrin. In these cells, soluble α3NC1 bound integrin α3β1; however, unlike αvβ3, α3β1 integrin did not mediate cell adhesion to immobilized α3NC1 domain. Interestingly, in cells lacking integrin α3β1, adhesion to the α3NC1 domain was enhanced due to activation of integrin αvβ3. These findings indicate that integrin α3β1 is a receptor for the α3NC1 domain and transdominantly inhibits integrin αvβ3 activation. Thus integrin α3β1, in conjunction with integrin αvβ3, modulates cellular responses to the α3NC1 domain, which may be pivotal in the mechanism underpinning its anti-angiogenic and anti-tumorigenic activities.

The NC1 4The abbreviations used are: NC1, noncollagenous domain of type IV collagen; mAb, monoclonal antibody; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin. domain of certain α-chains of type IV collagen display activity as inhibitors of angiogenesis and tumor growth. The capacity of the exogenous α1NC1 and α2NC1 domains to disrupt basement membrane assembly, blocking tissue development in vivo, was first described in Hydra vulgaris (1Zhang X. Hudson B.G. Sarras Jr., M.P. Dev. Biol. 1994; 164: 10-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Subsequent to these observations, we were the first to demonstrate that the recombinant α2NC1 and α3NC1 domains of human collagen IV potently inhibited tumor growth and angiogenesis by binding to endothelial cells in an integrin αvβ3-dependent manner (2Petitclerc E. Boutaud A. Prestayko A. Xu J. Sado Y. Ninomiya Y. Sarras Jr., M.P. Hudson B.G. Brooks P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8051-8061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Since these initial observations, NC1 domains of different collagen IV chains have emerged as a new class of anti-angiogenic and anti-tumorigenic molecules (3Colorado P.C. Torre A. Kamphaus G. Maeshima Y. Hopfer H. Takahashi K. Volk R. Zamborsky E.D. Herman S. Sarkar P.K. Ericksen M.B. Dhanabal M. Simons M. Post M. Kufe D.W. Weichselbaum R.R. Sukhatme V.P. Kalluri R.

These domains exert their effects by direct binding to tumor and endothelial cells where they induce apoptosis and/or inhibit cell proliferation. The mechanism of action of the NC1 domains is attributed to their interactions with integrins, transmembrane receptors for extracellular matrix components (5Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6951) Google Scholar). NC1 domains bind to distinct integrins, for example α1NC1 to integrin α1β1 (3Colorado P.C. Torre A.

The α3NC1 domain is the best characterized of these domains and its anti-tumorigenic effects are predominantly ascribed to its potent anti-angiogenic properties. Endothelial cells adhere to this domain in an integrin αvβ3-dependent manner (2Petitclerc E. Boutaud A. Prestayko A. Xu J. Sado Y. Ninomiya Y. Sarras Jr., M.P. Hudson B.G. Brooks P.C. J. Biol.

Furthermore, integrin αvβ3 is thought to mediate α3NC1-dependent inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation (9Maeshima Y. Sudhakar A. Lively J.C. Ueki K. Kharbanda S. Kahn C.R. Sonenberg N. Hynes R.O. Kalluri R. Science. 2002; 295: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In addition to its anti-angiogenic effects, the α3NC1 domain or peptides derived from its C-terminal third also inhibit melanoma cell growth both in vivo and in vitro in an integrin αvβ3-dependent manner (10Pasco S.

Interestingly, the tumor cell inhibition is cell type specific, as the α3NC1 domain does not inhibit the proliferation of PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells or 786-O renal carcinoma, although these cells express functionally active integrin αvβ3 This dichotomy raises the issue of how integrin αvβ3 mediates the anti-tumorigenic activity of the α3NC1 domain. One possible mechanism is by transdominant inhibition and activation of αvβ3 by other integrins. In this context, αvβ3 affinity is higher in cells deficient in integrin α5β1 and increased expression of α5β1 reduces αvβ3-mediated adhesion and migration (14Ly D.P. Zazzali K.M. Corbett S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21878-21885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Similarly, integrin α3β1 has been demonstrated to alter the function of other integrins and the formation of stress fibers in mouse keratinocytes (15Hodivala-Dilke K.M. DiPersio C.M. Kreidberg J.A. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1357-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We therefore undertook an unbiased approach to determine whether other integrin receptors might bind the α3NC1 domain and modulate integrin αvβ3 functions. Utilizing flow cytometry, we found that integrin α3β1, a non-classical collagen binding integrin, is a novel receptor for soluble α3NC1 domain. Furthermore, we provide evidence that integrin αvβ3 affinity is negatively modulated by integrin α3β1. Thus integrin α3β1 may play a key role in mediating the anti-tumorigenic activity of the α3NC1 domain. Materials—Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to FLAG peptide (M2) and fibronectin were from Sigma.

Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), obtained from BioWhittaker, were grown in EGM-2 MV medium (BioWhittaker) and used between passages 4 and 8. Human melanoma HT-144 and lung carcinoma A549 were from ATCC and maintained in McCoy modified medium or F12K medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Renal papilla cells from kidney of E18 integrin α3-deficient mice (B10) and integrin α3-deficient cells reconstituted with the human α3 integrin subunit (R10) (kindly provided by Dr. Jordan Kreidberg, Childrens Hospital, Boston, MA) were cultured as described previously (18Wang Z.

Recombinant Proteins—In all studies where soluble human α3NC1 domain has shown anti-tumorigenic activity in vivo, the domain contains a 12-residue collagenous sequence at the N terminus containing an RGD motif in addition to the 232-amino acid noncollagenous region. This domain was originally produced by collagenase digestion of native basement membranes, to ensure the preservation of epitopes for Goodpasture auto-antibodies (21Neilson E.G. Kalluri R. Sun M.J.

Bolton W.K. Kidney Int. 2003; 64: 2108-2120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Cell Adhesion Assay—Proteins at different concentrations were coated on 96-well plates in Na2CO3/NaHCO3, pH 9.5, at 4 °C. After 12 h nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) at 37 °C for 2 h. Cells were harvested, washed, and suspended in RPMI supplemented with 0.25% BSA and 1 mm MgCl2. Where indicated adhesion buffer was supplemented with 0.2 mm MnCl2. 105 cells in 100 μl were added to each well and incubated at 37 °C. After 1 h nonadherent cells were removed by washing with phosphate buffer. The attached cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with 0.1% crystal violet, and lysed with 10% acetic acid. Cell adhesion was quantified by reading the plates at 595 nm with a microtiter plate reader. The absorbance of the wells coated with 1% BSA was subtracted from each well. For adhesion blocking experiments antibodies to indicated integrins (10 μg/ml) were added to 96-well plates prior to addition of cells. Flow Cytometry—In all the flow cytometry assays performed, the α3NC1 domain was preincubated with mAb EB3 for 30 min at a 2:1 molar ratio. This ensures detection of ligand receptor interactions that rely not only on integrin affinity but also on avidity (25Konstandin M.H. Sester U. Klemke M. Weschenfelder T. Wabnitz G.H. Samstag Y. J.

After 1 h, cells were washed twice, incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG1 antibodies, and analyzed using a FACScan (BD Biosciences). For divalent cation chelating experiments, the RPMI was supplemented with 5 mm EDTA. For integrin-blocking experiments, cells were incubated with anti-integrin antibodies (0.5 mg/ml) prior to addition of the α3NC1 + mAb EB3 mixture.α3NC1 binding to cells was detected with a FITC-conjugated monoclonal rat anti-mouse IgG1 which does not react with any of the anti-integrin antibodies. For WOW-1 binding, cells were incubated sequentially with the α3NC1 + mAb EB3 mixture, WOW-1, and a FITC-conjugated anti-His Tag mouse mAb that recognizes WOW-1. Data collected in flow cytometry experiments were analyzed using Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences). To evaluate integrin expression levels cells were incubated with specific integrin antibodies for 45 min, washed twice, and then incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-hamster antibodies and analyzed with a FACScan. Proliferation Assays—CT26 cells (5 × 103 cells/well) were seeded into 96-well plates and treated with α3NC1 at various concentrations in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum and proliferation was measured using [3H]thymidine incorporation as described (26Chen D. Roberts R. Pohl M. Nigam S. Kreidberg J. Wang Z. Heino J. Ivaska J. Coffa S. Harris R.C. Pozzi A. Zent R. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: F602-F611Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Solid Phase Ligand Binding Assays—Purified integrin α3β1 (Chemicon) was coated on 96-well plates at 1 μg/ml in TBS overnight at 4 °C. The plates were blocked with TBS with 0.1% BSA and 0.3% Tween 20. The NC1 domains preincubated with mAb EB3 were added to integrin coated wells in binding buffer (TBS, 0.1% BSA, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm octyl glucoside) and incubated for 90 min at room temperature. After extensive washes (TBS, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Tween), the bound proteins were detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibodies. p-Nitrophenyl phosphate substrate (Sigma) was added to wells, and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm. Statistical Analysis—The Student's t test was used for comparisons between two groups, and analysis of variance using Sigma-Stat software for statistical differences between multiple groups. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The Binding of Soluble α3NC1 Domain to HUVECs Is Integrin-dependent—The α3NC1 domain is thought to mediate its effects primarily by binding to αv integrins. These receptors were identified using cell adhesion assays or affinity chromatography where the NC1 domain was immobilized on a fixed substratum. However, soluble, and not the immobilized NC1 domain, is the exogenous physical form used in cell culture and animal experiments. Hence, we developed a flow cytometry-based cell binding assay to determine whether soluble α3NC1 domain interacts with other membrane receptors. As integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5, the major α3NC1 domain-binding receptors (8Pedchenko V. Zent R. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2772-2780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), are highly expressed on endothelial cells, we initially performed our flow cytometry assay on HUVECs. As shown in Fig. 1A, the α3NC1 domain bound to HUVECs, and this binding was significantly inhibited by EDTA, suggesting that the principal receptors for this ligand were integrins. As HUVECs express αvβ3, the principal integrin to which the α3NC1 domain binds, we investigated whether this binding was dependent on the RGD sequence located at the N terminus of the α3NCI domain. Thus, the α3NC1 domain, with or without the RGD motif, was utilized for flow cytometric assays. Both forms of the domain bound to HUVECs with equal efficiency, indicating that the binding is independent of the RGD sequence (Fig. 1B). The binding was specific for the α3NC1 domain as C6, a recombinant protein derived from the α1NC1 domain, which contains the epitope for mAb EB3 (22Netzer K.O. Leinonen A. Boutaud A. Borza D.B. Todd P. Gunwar S. Langeveld J.P. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11267-11274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), did not bind to HUVEC (Fig. 1C). To determine whether binding of the α3NC1 domain was primarily dependent on αv integrins, flow cytometry was performed in the presence of cyclo-RGD peptides, which block the ligand binding site of αv integrins. Surprisingly, these peptides did not affect α3NC1 domain binding (Fig. 1D), suggesting that non-RGD binding receptors for the α3NC1 domain are present on HUVEC. To determine whether α3NC1 domain binding was dependent on a β1 integrin, similar flow cytometry assays to those described above were performed on mouse endothelial cells. Human cells cannot be used for antibody-dependent inhibition experiments because functional blocking antibodies, like EB3, are of the IgG1 isotype and interfere with detection by flow cytometry. A small decrease in α3NC1 binding to mouse endothelial cells was seen in the presence of an antibody to β1 integrin (Fig. 1E), suggesting that αsβ1 integrins could potentially be receptors for the α3NC1 domain in the absence of integrin αvβ3. α3NC1 Domain Binds to Integrin α3β1—To identify these putative αsβ1 receptors, we used mouse colon carcinoma CT26 cells, as these cells do not express integrin β3 and only very low levels of integrin αv (Ref. 27Yao B. He Q.M. Tian L. Xiao F. Jiang Y. Zhang R. Li G. Zhang L. Hou J.M. Wang L. Cheng X.C. Wen Y.J. Kan B. Li J. Zhao X. Hu B. Zhou Q. Zhang L. Wei Y.Q. Hum. Gene Ther. 2005; 16: 1075-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar and data not shown). As seen in Fig. 2A, despite the lack of integrin αvβ3 expression, the α3NC1 domain bound to CT26 cells. To confirm whether a β1 integrin was the receptor, we preincubated the cells with anti-β1 integrin antibody before addition of the α3NC1 domain. This antibody markedly decreased the binding, indicating that the α3NC1 domain binds to a β1 containing integrin (Fig. 2B). To identify the α subunit, we analyzed integrin expression of CT26 cells by flow cytometry and Western blot analysis and found high levels of integrin α2, α3, α5, and α6 (data not shown). Blocking antibodies to mouse α2, α5, α6, and αv integrins had no significant effect on α3NC1 binding (data not shown), suggesting that these integrins were not involved. Thus, integrin α3β1 was the best candidate receptor for the α3NC1 domain. Since neutralizing antibodies to mouse integrin α3β1 are not available, integrin α3-null cells were used for subsequent experiments. Integrin α3-null cells from kidney papillae (B10) and integrin α3-null cells reconstituted with human α3 integrin (R10) have been characterized (18Wang Z. Symons J.M. Goldstein S.L. McDonald A. Miner J.H. Kreidberg J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2925-2935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Chen D. Roberts R. Pohl M. Nigam S. Kreidberg J. Wang Z. Heino J. Ivaska J. Coffa S. Harris R.C. Pozzi A. Zent R. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: F602-F611Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, R10 cells bound soluble α3NC1 domain at much higher levels than B10 cells. This difference is exclusively attributed to integrin α3β1 since the levels of expression for other αβ1 and β4 integrins is similar in both cell populations (26Chen D. Roberts R. Pohl M. Nigam S. Kreidberg J. Wang Z. Heino J. Ivaska J. Coffa S. Harris R.C. Pozzi A. Zent R. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: F602-F611Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Furthermore the expression of integrins β3 and αv was similar in the two cell lines (2.19 ± 0.58-fold versus 1.966 ± 0.91-fold increase in fluorescence β3 integrin and 7.003 ± 4.14 versus 4.89 ± 2.42 for αv integrin in B10 and R10 cells, respectively). To verify that integrin α3β1 does indeed bind α3NC1, a solid phase ligand binding assay was performed. The α3NC1 domain bound to immobilized integrin α3β1, while C6, used as a negative control, showed no binding (Fig. 3B). Thus, integrin α3β1 is a receptor for the α3NC1 domain. Integrin α3β1 Binding to α3NC1 Domain Requires Residues 177–232—Three distinct binding sites for integrin αvβ3 have been mapped in the α3NC1 domain: a RGD site at the N terminus, a second site between amino acids 56–75 and a third site between amino acids 185–203 (8Pedchenko V. Zent R. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2772-2780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). To identify the binding sites for integrin α3β1, we used α3/α1NC1 chimeric proteins in which fragments of α3NC1 were replaced with homologous fragments of α1NC1 (1-3-1, 3-3-1, 1-3-3) (Fig. 4A). The binding site for mAb EB3, required for detection, is located in the middle of all the chimeric proteins. In a solid phase binding assay, no binding to immobilized integrin α3β1 was detected with 1-3-1 or 3-3-1 chimeras, while both the 1-3-3 chimera and α3NC1 bound to integrin α3β1 (Fig. 4B). Similar results were obtained by flow cytometry on CT26 cells with the 1-3-3 and α3NC1 domain showing significant binding, while the 1-3-1 and 1-3-3 chimera bound poorly (Fig. 4C). Thus, the C-terminal third of the α3NC1 domain encompassing residues 177–232 is required for binding to α3β1 integrin. CT26 Cells Proliferation Is Decreased by α3NC1—As HUVEC proliferation is decreased by the α3NC1 domain via interactions with αv integrins and cell adhesion to the α3NC1 domain is primarily mediated by the same integrins (8Pedchenko V. Zent R. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2772-2780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 28Maeshima Y. Manfredi M. Reimer C. Holthaus K.A. Hopfer H. Chandamuri B.R. Kharbanda S. Kalluri R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15240-15248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), we determined whether either of these cell functions could be induced by α3NC1 in the absence of integrin αvβ3. As shown in Fig. 5A, CT26 cell proliferation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner with increasing concentrations of soluble α3NC1 domain. In contrast, there was minimal adhesion of CT26 cells to immobilized α3NC1 domain (Fig. 5B) at concentrations where endothelial cells adhered well (data not shown). CT26 cells, however, adhered well to their natural ligand fibronectin (Fig. 5B). Thus, the binding of soluble α3NC1 domain to CT26 cells expressing integrin α3β1 correlates with the inhibition of cell proliferation. However, in the absence of integrin αvβ3, CT26 cell adhesion to immobilized α3NC1 domain is minimal. Integrin α3β1 Is a Trans-dominant Inhibitor of Integrin αv—Full-length and fragments of the α3NC1 domain do not decrease cell proliferation in all tumor cells that express integrin αvβ3 (4Maeshima Y.

Furthermore, it is well known that the affinity of αv integrins can be altered by the transdominant effect of other integrins (14Ly D.P. Zazzali K.M. Corbett S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21878-21885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 15Hodivala-Dilke K.M. DiPersio C.M. Kreidberg J.A. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1357-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To test whether integrin α3β1 can indeed alter the affinity of αv integrins, we measured the activation status of αv integrins in B10 and R10 cells. WOW-1, an antibody that recognizes only the active form of αv integrins (17Pampori N. Hato T. Stupack D.G. Aidoudi S. Cheresh D.A. Nemerow G.R. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21609-21616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), was used to measure αv integrin affinity. R10 and B10 cells express similar but low levels of αv integrin (18Wang Z. Symons J.M. Goldstein S.L. McDonald A. Miner J.H. Kreidberg J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2925-2935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and only 1.63% of R10 cells expressed activated αv integrins. In contrast, the percentage of B10 cells (4.25%) that bound WOW-1 in the absence of the α3NC1 domain was more than double that of R10 cells (Fig. 6A). This difference was enhanced in B10 cells (8.15%) by incubation with the α3NC1 domain suggesting that α3NC1 domain per se can activate integrin αvβ3. Together these data suggest that αv integrins are transdominantly inhibited by the expression of integrin α3β1. Cell adhesion assays were then performed to determine whether this transdominant effect changed cell adhesion on immobilized α3NC1 domains. As shown in Fig. 6B, R10 cells adhered significantly less than B10 cells. When Mn2+ was added, R10 and B10 cell adhesion to α3NC1 increased, but the enhancement was greater with the R10 cells (5.5-fold versus 1.8-fold for 1.6 μg/ml α3NC1). Thus α3β1-dependent transdominant inhibition of αv integrin affinity decreases cell adhesion to the α3NC1 domain. Since most cells expressing αv integrins also express α3β1 integrin, we examined whether the expression levels of α3β1 influences integrin αv affinity. We screened for human cell lines that expressed varying levels of integrins α3β1 and αvβ3, as functional blocking antibodies to human α3 integrin are available. We found that melanoma HT-144 cells express high levels of αvβ3 and α3β1, HUVECs express high levels of integrin αvβ3 but slightly lower levels of integrin α3β1 than HT-144 cells, and the lung carcinoma cells A549 express similar levels of integrin α3β1 but lower levels of integrin αvβ3 compared with HT-144 cells (Fig. 7A). As expected, the adhesion of these cells to the α3NC1 domain correlated with the levels of αvβ3 integrin with HT-144 and HUVEC cells adhering significantly more than A549 cells (Fig. 7B). In the presence of aα3 integrin blocking antibody, adhesion of A549 cells increased significantly. Interestingly, the adhesion of HT-144 cells to the α3NC1 domain also increased when integrin α3β1 was blocked, although not to the same extent as for A549 cells. In contrast, this antibody had a minimal effect on HUVECs (which express the lowest levels of integrin α3β1). Adhesion of all three cell lines to the α3NC1 domain is integrin αvβ3-dependent as antibodies to this integrin completely inhibited their adhesion (Fig. 7B). These data suggest that modulating both the expression and occupancy of integrin α3β1 alters the affinity and adhesive functions of integrin αvβ3. The efficacy of soluble α3NC1 domain as an anti-tumorigenic agent has been ascribed to its binding to αvβ3 integrin (2Petitclerc E. Boutaud A. Prestayko A. Xu J. Sado Y. Ninomiya Y. Sarras Jr., M.P.

Chem. 2000; 275: 4796-4802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This binding was defined by either integrin αv-dependent cell adhesion or affinity chromatography with immobilized NC1 domain. To identify whether the physical immobilization influenced integrin binding, a flow cytometry assay was devised to explore the cellular receptors for soluble α3NC1 domain. This assay is similar to a novel flow cytometry method recently described to quantify integrin affinity and avidity changes at the single cell level (25Konstandin M.H. Sester U. Klemke M. Weschenfelder T. Wabnitz G.H. Samstag Y. J. Immunol. Methods. 2006; 310: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, the nonclassical collagen receptor, integrin α3β1, was shown to bind α3NC1 domain. CT26 cell proliferation was inhibited by soluble α3NC1 domain; however, these cells only minimally adhere to immobilized α3NC1 domain. These results reveal the limitation of assays that rely on immobilized ligands, when screening for receptors for soluble NC1 domain. In addition, we demonstrate that functional blocking of integrin α3β1 transdominantly increases αv-integrin affinity for the α3NC1 domain. Taken together, these results raise the possibility that, in addition to αv integrins, integrin α3β1 might play a role in the anti-tumorigenic effects of theα3NC1 domain by either directly affecting cell proliferation or altering the affinity of αv integrins on either tumor or endothelial cells. The identification of receptors that bind to the soluble form of NC1 domain is important as this is the physical state in which they are administered and exert their biological effects. Our result that integrin α3β1 binds soluble α3NC1 domain, but cell adhesion is not mediated upon mobilization of the same ligand, highlights this point. Thus only performing assays with NC1 domain attached to fixed substrata might not identify critical receptors that are expressed by tumor cells and may mediate anti-tumoral effects. We showed that the integrin α3β1 binding site encompasses residues 177–232 of the α3NC1 domain. This region overlaps with residues 185–203 that constitutes a peptide that promotes adhesion of human melanoma cells and inhibits their proliferation in vitro (12Pasco S. Ramont L. Venteo L. Pluot M. Maquart F.X. Monboisse J.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 301: 251-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This peptide is proposed to mediate its effects by interacting with the integrin αvβ3 CD47-integrin-associated protein complex (31Shahan T.A. Ziaie Z. Pasco S. Fawzi A. Bellon G. Monboisse J.C. Kefalides N.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4584-4590PubMed Google Scholar). However, our data suggest the mechanism of action of this peptide on tumor cell proliferation might be mediated through integrin α3β1 as CT26 cells do not express integrin αvβ3, and residues 185–203 are encompassed in the integrin α3β1 binding site on the α3NC1 domain. Overexpression of the C-terminal fragment of α3NC1 (residues 183–232) inhibits tumor growth of B16F1 melanoma cells in vivo (12Pasco S. Ramont L. Venteo L. Pluot M. Maquart F.X. Monboisse J.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 301: 251-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore mice treated with a plasmid DNA encoding the α3NC1 domain develop smaller CT26 cell-derived tumors than control animals (27Yao B. He Q.M. Tian L. Xiao F. Jiang Y. Zhang R. Li G. Zhang L. Hou J.M. Wang L. Cheng X.C. Wen Y.J. Kan B. Li J. Zhao X. Hu B. Zhou Q. Zhang L. Wei Y.Q. Hum. Gene Ther. 2005; 16: 1075-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that these in vivo anti-tumorigenic effects of the α3NC1 domain might be mediated by its binding to integrin α3β1, rather than via proposed αvβ3-mediated effects on endothelial cells. The mechanisms whereby the α3NC1 domain induces its anti-tumorigenic effects are becoming increasingly complex. Some groups proposed that its action is mediated by anti-angiogenic activity residing in residues 54–132, while the C-terminal derivatives do not inhibit angiogenesis (4Maeshima Y. Colorado P.C.

Furthermore the same group proposed that these effects are mediated by both endogenous and exogenously administered α3NC1 domain. In contrast, others found that polypeptides encompassing amino acids 179–208 within the C terminus have both anti-angiogenic (33Shahan T. Grant D. Tootell M. Ziaie Z. Ohno N. Mousa S. Mohamad S.

Connect Tissue Res. 2004; 45: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These effects have only been observed with exogenously administered α3NC1 domain or when the α3NC1 domain is produced by tumor cells. We now demonstrate that the C-terminal third of the α3NC1 domain interacts with integrin α3β1 where it decreases tumor cell proliferation in vitro. Taken together the data suggest that the anti-angiogenic affects of the α3NC1 domain in vivo might be mediated by both the C and N terminus of the domain. In contrast, the anti-tumorigenic effects are mediated only by the C terminus of the domain, via interactions with either integrin αvβ3 or α3β1. The relative expression levels of these integrins on tumor cells in vivo might determine their response to exogenous α3NC1 domain exposure. We demonstrated that both expression levels and occupancy of integrin α3β1 by ligand alters integrin αvβ3 affinity. Endothelial cells and most carcinomas express both of these integrins in varying amounts. Thus, soluble NC1 domain interactions with integrin α3β1 might alter αvβ3-dependent cell functions by transdominant activation or inhibition. This mechanism of modulating integrin function is well described in αv integrins. Expression of integrin α5β1 reduces αvβ3-mediated adhesion (14Ly D.P. Zazzali K.M. Corbett S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21878-21885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and αvβ3-mediated endothelial cell migration is altered by the ligation state of integrin α5β1 (14Ly D.P. Zazzali K.M. Corbett S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21878-21885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Furthermore, antibodies against αvβ3 can inhibit both integrin α5β1-mediated phagocytosis (34Blystone S.D. Graham I.L. Lindberg F.P. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) as well as α3β1/α6β1-mediated cell adhesion to α4-laminin (35Gonzalez A.M. Gonzales M. Herron G.S. Nagavarapu U. Hopkinson S.B. Tsuruta D. Jones J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16075-16080Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Moreover, the observation that cells lacking integrin α3β1 adhere to fibronectin and collagen better than wild type cells (15Hodivala-Dilke K.M. DiPersio C.M. Kreidberg J.A. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1357-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) shows that integrin α3β1 is also a trans-dominant inhibitor of integrin activation. Thus, our data that the ligation state and expression levels of integrin α3β1 can exert significant alterations on integrin αvβ3 function might explain why certain tumor cells are not responsive to the anti-proliferative effects of the α3NC1 domain despite their expression of integrin αvβ3. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the α3NC1 domain binds integrin α3β1, and cell proliferation is decreased in cells that lack integrin αvβ3 but express integrin α3β1. In addition, the ligation state of integrin α3β1 can modulate the affinity of αvβ3 integrin, a key integrin required for tumor angiogenesis. Thus, integrin α3β1 might be a direct mediator of the anti-tumorigenic actions of the α3NC1 domain. In addition, interactions between the α3NC1 domain and α3β1 integrin might play a key role in the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis by altering αvβ3 integrin affinity on endothelial cells.

Here, we show that US11 and US2 bind the ER chaperone BiP. Four related HCMV proteins, US3, US7, US9, and US10, which do not promote degradation of MHC proteins, did not bind BiP. Silencing BiP reduced US11- and US2-mediated degradation of MHC class I heavy chain (HC) without altering the synthesis or translocation of HC into the ER or the stability of HC in the absence of US11 or US2. Induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR) did not affect US11-mediated HC degradation and could not explain the stabilization of HC when BiP was silenced. Unlike in yeast, BiP did not act by maintaining substrates in a retrotranslocation-competent form. Our studies go beyond previous observations in mammalian cells correlating BiP release with degradation, demonstrating that BiP is functionally required for US2- and US11-mediated HC degradation. Further, US2 and US11 bound BiP even when HC was absent and degradation of US2 depended on HC. These data were consistent with a model in which US2 and US11 bridge HC onto BiP promoting interactions with other ER-associated degradation proteins.

ER chaperones, including BiP, calnexin (CNX), and calreticulin (CRT) promote folding of ER proteins. However, unsuccessful folding or assembly may force these chaperones to withdraw from folding cycles and target substrates for retrotranslocation (3Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar, 8Romisch K. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 1435-1456Crossref Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 30Fewell S.W. Travers K.J.

One process that determines the duration of retention of a glycoprotein in the ER involves the monitoring of N-linked oligosaccharides. CNX and CRT bind immature monoglucosylated proteins and promote ER retention, folding, and assembly (31Parodi A.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 69-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). However, protracted cycles of CNX and CRT binding and release leads to binding of ERAD enhancing α-mannosidase-like (EDEM) protein that accelerates ERAD (32Molinari M. Calanca V. Galli C. Lucca P.

However, interactions between EDEM, Yos9p, or protein disulfide isomerase and retrotranslocation channels or other ERAD components have not yet been described, so it is not clear how binding of these proteins promotes ERAD.BiP recognizes hydrophobic regions of misfolded or partially assembled proteins, promoting ER retention and protein folding (3Ellgaard L.

The role of BiP in ERAD can be genetically separated from its role in translocation, and degradation of ERAD substrates is slowed in yeast expressing mutant forms of BiP (9Plemper R.K. Bohmler S.

BiP can function to reduce aggregation and maintain the solubility of ERAD substrates so that substrates are retrotranslocation-competent (42Kabani M. Kelley S.S. Morrow M.W. Montgomery D.L.

However, overexpression of wild-type BiP in the presence of mutant BiP did not overcome defects in ERAD, although substrates were no longer aggregated (42Kabani M. Kelley S.S. Morrow M.W.

In mammalian cells, evidence for BiP function in ERAD involves correlations between the extent of BiP binding and rates of substrate release (26Chillaron J. Haas I.G. Mol. Biol.

These results suggest that BiP stabilizes potential ERAD substrates and might transfer substrates onto other components of the ERAD machinery. BiP binds to the luminal side of the Sec61 translocon, sealing or gating the channel (49Johnson A.E. Haigh N.G. Cell. 2000; 102: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and might therefore promote transfer of ERAD substrates to retrotranslocation channels, although there is no evidence for this at present. Arguing against this notion, the same BiP sequences are involved in binding both to ERAD substrates and the translocon (50Alder N.N. Shen Y. Brodsky J.L. Hendershot L.M. Johnson A.E. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, without mammalian cells lacking BiP or expressing mutant forms that overcome the native BiP, it is difficult to understand how BiP promotes ERAD.HCMV glycoproteins US2 and US11 bind MHC class I and II proteins and trigger their degradation by proteasomes, a process mechanistically similar to ERAD, but with extremely rapid kinetics (12Wiertz E.J.

However, events in the ER lumen that promote US11- or US2-mediated degradation are poorly understood. Specifically, it is not clear how binding of US2 or US11 to normal MHC proteins triggers rapid ERAD. We and others have suggested that US2 and US11 might bridge MHC complexes onto cellular components of the ERAD machinery (58Furman M.H. Ploegh H.L. Tortorella D. J. Biol.

Several homologous HCMV proteins, that bind MHC proteins but do not cause their degradation, did not bind BiP. Silencing of BiP did not alter the stability of HC in the absence of US11 or US2 but decreased US11- and US2-mediated degradation of HC. BiP promotes degradation of HC in US2- and US11-expressing cells by a mechanism distinct from maintaining HC solubility or “retrotranslocation competence.” US2 and US11 bound to BiP, even in the absence of HC, and bind directly to HC suggesting that the US proteins bridge BiP onto HC to promote binding onto other ERAD machinery.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells, Viruses, Antibodies, and Drugs—U373-MG human astroglioma and Vero cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine growth supplement (HyClone) and antibiotics. 1858 melanoma cells were obtained from Paul Robbins (NCI, National Institutes of Health) and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.

The cells were trypsinized, labeled in suspension with [35S]Met/Cys (300–500 μCi/ml, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the label was chased in medium containing a 10-fold excess of Met/Cys. For direct immunoprecipitations, cell extracts were made with Nonidet P-40-deoxycholate (Nonidet P-40-DOC) buffer. Proteins of interest were immunoprecipitated from clarified lysates with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to HCMV US2–11 proteins (61Hegde N.R. Tomazin R.A. Wisner T.W. Dunn C. Boname J.M. Lewinsohn D.M. Johnson D.C. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 10929-10941Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and protein A-Sepharose, as described (53Tomazin R. Boname J. Hegde N.R. Lewinsohn D.M. Altschuler Y. Jones T.R. Cresswell P. Nelson J.A. Riddell S.R. Johnson D.C. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1039-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). For precipitation of HC with mAb HC10, lysates were heated to 60 °C for 1 h, cooled to room temperature, and clarified. Endoglycosidase H (endoH, New England Biolabs) analyses were performed as per the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis using 8–12% polyacrylamide gels, the gels were fixed, dried, and exposed to PhosphorImager screens (Molecular Dynamics).For assessing protein complexes, cells were lysed with 1% digitonin (Calbiochem) or 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and proteins were immunoprecipitated as above. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and stained with silver reagent (Pierce) or were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore) and Western blotted using a chemiluminescence kit (New England Nuclear or Pierce). Blots were exposed to x-ray film, or bands were quantified using a Lumi-Imager (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For Derlin-1, 5–6 × 106 cells were homogenized in 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.35), 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, and postnuclear supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g to obtain microsomes that were dissolved in digitonin buffer and diluted in 4× sample loading buffer before analysis by immunoblotting.Mass Spectroscopic Analyses—Silver-stained protein bands were reduced in 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), alkylated in 10 mm iodoacetamide, and then subjected to in-gel trypsin hydrolysis (65Holowaty M.N.

Peptides were purified and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry using a cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix (Sigma) on a Voyager DE-STR instrument (Applied Biosystems). Proteins were then identified using the ProFound software.RNA Silencing—6 × 105 U373 cells in 100-mm dishes in 4 ml of serum-free Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) were incubated with 100 nm small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. The following oligonucleotides were used: (a) BiP siRNA #1 targeting nucleotides 684–704 (CCUUCGAUGUGUCUCUUCUdTdT), (b) BiP siRNA #2 targeting nucleotides 1666–1686 (GGAGCGCAUUGAUACUAGUdTdT), (c) Derlin-1 siRNA #1 targeting nucleotides 279–297 (GAGGCCAGCAGACUAUUUAdT-dT), (d) Derlin-1 siRNA #2 targeting nucleotides 445–463 (CGAUUUAAGGCCUGCUAUUdTdT), (e) control siRNA #1 representing a scrambled sequence of BiP siRNA #1 (UGACUUCCGUCUCUGUUCAdTdT), and (f) control siRNA #2, targeting firefly luciferase (Dharmacon catalog # D-001210-02). After 4 h, 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 30% fetal bovine serum was added to each dish, and the cells were incubated an additional 14–16 h before the siRNA and Oligofectamine were removed, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum was added. 48 h after transfection, the cells were infected with Ad vectors for 18 h to express HCMV proteins. For silencing in smaller or bigger dishes, the proportion of reagents was scaled down or up accordingly.Analysis of Induction of the Unfolded Protein Response—UPR induction was assessed by detecting the splicing of X-box-binding protein-1 (XBP-1) using reverse transcription-PCR. For positive controls, cells were either treated with 2 mm DTT or heated (42 °C) for 60 min. Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Room temperature reaction was performed with 1 μg of total RNA using the SuperScript III system (Invitrogen). 10% of the room temperature reaction was used in PCR amplification to detect a fragment of XBP-1 using the primers 5′-CTGGAACAGCAAGTGGTAGA-3′ and 5′-CTGGGTCCTTCTGGGTAGAC-3′. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a loading control using the primers 5′-CCACCCATGGCAAATTCCATGGCA-3′ and 5′-TCTAGACGGCAGGTCAGGTCCACC-3′. Bands were visualized in 1.2% agarose gels.Analysis of Protein Aggregation—U373 cells in 150-mm dishes were transfected with siRNAs and infected with Ad vectors as above, treated with 1 μm epoxomicin for 1 h, and labeled for 20 min with [35S]Met/Cys in the presence of 1 μm epoxomicin. Cell extracts were made using 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 50 mm KOAc, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. A small fraction of the lysate was removed for Western blot analysis of BiP, and extracts were layered over 10–40% sucrose step gradients in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100 (TENT buffer) and centrifuged at 145,000 × g for 20 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW50.1 rotor. 0.7-ml fractions were collected, and 0.7 ml of TENT buffer was used to solubilize the pellet by sonication. Gradient fractions were diluted with 0.7 ml of TENT buffer containing 0.2% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% DOC, and 2× protease inhibitors, heated to 60 °C for 1 h, cooled to room temperature for 15 min, centrifuged at 8000 × g for 10 min at room temperature, and HC was immunoprecipitated using mAb HC10.RESULTSHCMV Glycoproteins US11 and, to a Lesser Extent, US2 Bind BiP—HCMV US2–US11 region encodes eight homologous ER-retained type I membrane glycoproteins (66Huber M.T.

However, whether such a presynaptic regulation of quantal size can be induced under physiological conditions as a potential alternative mechanism to alter the strength of synaptic transmission is unknown. Here we show that presynaptic vesicles of glutamatergic synapses of Drosophila neuromuscular junctions increase in size as a result of high natural crawling activities of larvae, leading to larger quantal sizes and enhanced evoked synaptic transmission. We further show that these larger vesicles are formed during a period of enhanced replenishment of the reserve pool of vesicles, from which they are recruited via a PKA- and actin-dependent mechanism. Our results demonstrate that natural behavior can induce the formation, recruitment, and release of larger vesicles in an experience-dependent manner and hence provide evidence for an additional mechanism of synaptic potentiation.

Since the pioneering work of Bernard Katz and colleagues (Fatt and Katz, 1952Fatt P. Katz B. Spontaneous subthreshold activity at motor nerve endings.J. Physiol. 1952; 117: 109-128PubMed Google Scholar), the unitary synaptic potential produced by the release of a single vesicle, i.e., the quantal size, has generally been considered to be invariant. Recent work in secretory cells as well as in neurons has, however, demonstrated that the quantal size can vary with experimental manipulations. Adrenal chromaffin cells vary quantal size by changing vesicular catecholamine content following alterations in stimulation frequency and second messenger systems (Elhamdani et al., 2001Elhamdani A. Palfrey H.C. Artalejo C.R. Quantal size is dependent on stimulation frequency and calcium entry in calf chromaffin cells.Neuron. 2001; 31: 819-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Furthermore, alterations in the activity of the vesicular monoamine transporter or the vacuolar proton pump were shown to be associated with quantal size changes and concomitant alterations in the volume of secretory vesicles (Gong et al., 2003Gong L.W.

Similar results have been obtained in dopaminergic neurons (Pothos, 2002Pothos E.N. Regulation of dopamine quantal size in midbrain and hippocampal neurons.Behav.

Quantal release of serotonin.Neuron. 2000; 28: 205-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). These data challenged the universality of the quantal hypothesis of transmitter release and raised questions as to whether similar mechanisms could contribute to activity-dependent plasticity of fast synapses (Burgoyne and Barclay, 2002Burgoyne R.D. Barclay J.W. Splitting the quantum: regulation of quantal release during vesicle fusion.Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 176-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A number of manipulations have been shown to modify quantal size at vertebrate neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), including treatment with catecholamines, insulin, ACTH, and cAMP derivatives (van der Kloot and van der Kloot, 1986van der Kloot W. van der Kloot T.E.

Similar effects of an altered expression of vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT) were recently observed at hippocampal synapses (Wilson et al., 2005Wilson N.R. Kang J. Hueske E.V. Leung T.

Krantz D.E. DiAntonio A. Increased expression of the Drosophila vesicular glutamate transporter leads to excess glutamate release and a compensatory decrease in quantal content.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10466-10474Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Furthermore, genetic manipulations of the clathrin adaptor protein LAP (Like-AP180) (Zhang et al., 1998Zhang B. Koh Y.H. Beckstead R.B. Budnik V. Ganetzky B. Bellen H.J.

Horne J.A. Meinertzhagen I.A. Schwarz T.L.

These data demonstrated that quantal size can be experimentally modified at fast synapses (Atwood and Karunanithi, 2002Atwood H.L. Karunanithi S. Diversification of synaptic strength: presynaptic elements.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 497-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence have suggested that changes in quantal size can occur in response to altered neuronal activities. GABAergic interneurons upregulate the expression of the GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamate decarboxylase (GAD65/67) under conditions of increased network activity (Esclapez and Houser, 1999Esclapez M. Houser C.R. Up-regulation of GAD65 and GAD67 in remaining hippocampal GABA neurons in a model of temporal lobe epilepsy.J. Comp.

Conversely, prolonged periods of reduced activity result in a downregulation of GAD and GABA in the somatosensory cortex (Garraghty et al., 1991Garraghty P.E. LaChica E.A. Kaas J.H.

Brain Res. 1999; 71: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and in reduced expression of the vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter VGAT in cultured hippocampal neurons (Hartman et al., 2006Hartman K.N. Pal S.K. Burrone J. Murthy V.N. Activity-dependent regulation of inhibitory synaptic transmission in hippocampal neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 642-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In such hippocampal cultures, chronic hyperactivity or hypoactivity lead to a reciprocal down- or upregulation of the expression of VGLUT1, respectively, and hence lead to accordingly smaller or larger excitatory quantal sizes (Wilson et al., 2005Wilson N.R. Kang J. Hueske E.V. Leung T. Varoqui H. Murnick J.G. Erickson J.D. Liu G. Presynaptic regulation of quantal size by the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT1.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6221-6234Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Together with previous observations from cholinergic NMJs (Lupa, 1988Lupa M.T.

Van der Kloot T.E. Activity increases quantal size at the frog neuromuscular junction.Experientia. 1985; 41: 47-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), these data indicate that chronic increases in synaptic firing activities can result in quantal size changes to enhance synaptic transmission (Van der Kloot and Van der Kloot, 1985Van der Kloot W.

Activity increases quantal size at the frog neuromuscular junction.Experientia. 1985; 41: 47-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) or to homeostatically maintain a stable degree of network activity (Hartman et al., 2006Hartman K.N.

Neurosci. 2006; 9: 642-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004Turrigiano G.G. Nelson S.B. Homeostatic plasticity in the developing nervous system.Nat. Rev.

Presynaptic regulation of quantal size by the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT1.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6221-6234Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). However, it is currently not known whether such presynaptic mechanisms of changing the efficacy of synaptic transmission are used under physiological conditions in vivo as potential additional mechanism of synaptic plasticity. In this study we used NMJs of Drosophila larvae to assess whether differences in natural larval crawling activities can affect the strength of transmission at glutamatergic synapses. Our analysis revealed that high natural crawling activities of wild-type Drosophila larvae result after an initial lag phase in potentiated synaptic transmission, which is transiently mediated by a PKA-dependent release of large vesicles from the reserve pool (RP) (phase I potentiation). We further show that large RP vesicles are absent in lag phase and that the replenishment of RP vesicles is enhanced in phase I, suggesting that the large vesicles in the RP are newly formed and released during phase I potentiation. These results demonstrate that natural behavior can alter the transmitter content of presynaptic vesicles in an experience-dependent manner. We have developed a monitoring system of larval behavior to continuously quantify crawling activities of individual larvae on a food-free surface. Upon transfer from standard Drosophila food vials onto a moist and food-free crawling arena, the majority of isogenic wild-type third-instar larvae (Canton S) exhibited persistently high crawling activities (i.e., few and short resting phases; >25 cm/5 min; filled squares in Figure 1A), some larvae exhibited low crawling activities with frequent and long resting phases (<15 cm/5 min; white squares in Figure 1A), and others' behavior was highly variable (data not shown). We found similar behavioral differences in other inbred Drosophila strains (Oregon R, w1118) as well as in heterozygous and transheterozygous genotypes used in this study, suggesting that the differences in the crawling profiles of size- and age-matched third-instar larvae are independent of their genotypes. The different crawling profiles of individual larvae are likely to be associated with an altered average usage of NMJs, which potentially results in use-dependent changes at these NMJs. To systematically assess whether different crawling activities have an effect on synaptic transmission, we analyzed NMJs of size- and age-matched mid-third-instar larvae either directly after they have been taken out of the food slurry (25°C; “naive” larvae) or after various times of exposure to the crawling arena (moist, food-free, 25°C). Within the food slurry, mid-third-instar larvae exhibit on average very low crawling activities (4.4 ± 1.5 cm/5 min, n = 4; Sigrist et al., 2003Sigrist S.J. Reiff D.F. Thiel P.R. Steinert J.R. Schuster C.M. Experience-dependent strengthening of Drosophila neuromuscular junctions.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6546-6556PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, larvae that have been transferred to the food-free crawling arena showed much higher crawling activities (“slow” larvae: 12.0 ± 3.1 cm/5 min, n = 18; “fast” larvae: 33.1 ± 0.1 cm/5 min, n = 28, p < 0.05; larval size: 3.1 ± 0.2 mm2 and 3.2 ± 0.3 mm2, respectively, n = 14 each). The time point of transfer of naive larvae onto the food-free crawling arena marks therefore the beginning of an intensified foraging behavior with individually variable, but on average higher, crawling activities than before. Following the indicated times after start of crawling (x axis in Figures 1D and 1E), we analyzed the efficacy of synaptic transmission of fast, slow, and naive larvae. Intracellular recordings of excitatory junctional potentials (EJPs) revealed no differences in miniature and evoked junctional potentials (mEJPs and eEJPs) between naive (leftmost data points in Figures 1D and 1E) and fast (black symbols) or slow (white squares) wild-type larvae within the initial 35 min of surface crawling (Figures 1B–1E). Recording parameters such as the input resistances (Rin) and the resting membrane potentials (MP) were also similar among the analyzed cells (Rin-naive: 4.1 ± 1.2 MW, n = 16; MP: −70.3 ± 1.2 mV, n = 40; Rin-fast: 5.6 ± 1.6 MW, n = 4; MP: −68.8 ± 1.9 mV, n = 7; Rin-slow: 6.2 ± 2.6 MW, n = 3; MP: −75.6 ± 3.6 mV, n = 4; means ± SEM), demonstrating that naive, fast-crawling, and slow-crawling larvae have similar synaptic properties. When larvae were analyzed at any time point later than 35 min of crawling, eEJP amplitudes were found to be increased in fast larvae compared to slow larvae or naive larvae taken directly out of the food slurry (Figures 1D and 1E). Potentiated eEJPs and unaltered membrane parameters (Rin-65min: 5.6 ± 0.9 MΩ, n = 15; MP: −71.5 ± 1.3 mV, n = 35; Rin-120min: 6.0 ± 1.0 MΩ, n = 14, MP: 69.1 ± 1.5 mV, n = 14; mean ± SEM) were recorded in all larvae that exhibited high crawling activities for more than 40 min, suggesting that extended periods of continuous crawling have robust effects on the strength of junctional signal transmission. In addition to the crawling-induced potentiation of evoked synaptic transmission, we noticed that larvae analyzed between 40 to 80 min of fast crawling showed an increase in the mean mEJP amplitudes (Figures 1B and 1E). This increase in the mEJP amplitude coincided with the onset of eEJP potentiation (Figures 1C and 1D) and was characterized by the appearance of additional and increasingly larger mEJPs over time (Figure 2A). The mean mEJP amplitude reached a peak in larvae between 70 and 80 min of fast crawling (Figure 1E). In this time window, the estimated junctional quantal content was unaltered compared to naive controls (right bars in Figure 5B), indicating that eEJP potentiation is likely to be mediated by the large mEJPs. However, at later time points (90–120 min) the large mEJPs abruptly disappeared, reestablishing the typical mean mEJP amplitudes (Figures 1E and 2A) while the mean amplitudes of eEJPs remained elevated. Potentiation in this time window was associated with a significant increase in the junctional quantal content compared to naive animals (QC90min: 71.5 ± 4.8; 137.5% ± 9.2% of controls; n = 7; p < 0.005), suggesting different underlying mechanisms in this phase than in larvae analyzed after a shorter time of behavioral stimulation. These results suggest that experience-dependent potentiation of synaptic transmission at larval NMJs can be differentiated by the presence or absence of large mEJPs. We therefore divided the first 2 hr of experience-dependent synaptic potentiation into three distinct phases: (1) the initial lag phase (0–35 min) shows similar synaptic parameters among naive larvae and those with high and low crawling activities; (2) the subsequent phase I potentiation (40–80 min) is characterized by simultaneous occurrence of large eEJP and mEJP amplitudes; (3) the subsequent phase II potentiation (90–120 min) shows large eEJP amplitudes that are not associated with large mEJPs (Figures 1B, 1E, and 2A). It is remarkable how abrupt phase I potentiation undergoes a transition into phase II when examined in animals taken after either 80 min or 90 min of high crawling activities (Figure 1E). To exclude the possibility that this apparently rapid transition from phase I to phase II is an artifact of animal selection, we analyzed the time course of the disappearances of large mEJPs in dissected preparations. We dissected larvae after 65 min of fast crawling (time point 0 in Figures 1F and 1G) and recorded mEJPs and eEJPs every 5 min for the next 40 min. In these preparations we observed a similarly rapid disappearance of large mEJPs (Figure 1G), while eEJP potentiation remained apparently unaltered (Figure 1F). It should be noted that the potentiated eEJPs of phase I and phase II are in an amplitude range (>50 mV) in which nonlinear summation of quantal events may effectively mask a further increase or slight decrease of the eEJP amplitudes. It is therefore possible that the absolute level of eEJP potentiation might be slightly different in phase I and phase II and that these potential differences are masked in our current-clamp recordings (Figure 1D). Nevertheless, our results clearly show that persistent larval crawling activities are sufficient to initiate and execute at least two different mechanisms that potentiate glutamatergic transmission at NMJs. They further suggest that the transition between phase I and phase II potentiation is a highly coordinated process to ensure maintained potentiation. To assess whether crawling-induced potentiation is associated with a rapid outgrowth of new synaptic boutons, we performed a time-lapse study in which we imaged NMJs in vivo before and after 2 hr of fast crawling. No large-scale morphological differences at NMJs were detected (Figure 2B), demonstrating that, within 2 hr of fast crawling, experience-dependent potentiation is not due to the outgrowth of new boutons. Alterations in mEJPs have been commonly interpreted as the result of changes in the postsynaptic responsiveness to released transmitter. We therefore first assessed whether postsynaptic alterations are involved in the transient generation of large mEJPs in phase I. Five ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits have so far been identified at Drosophila NMJs, of which DGluRIII (Marrus et al., 2004Marrus S.B. Portman S.L. Allen M.J. Moffat K.G. DiAntonio A.

These two principal glutamate receptor complexes, whose exact stoichiometry of subunits is currently not solved (Qin et al., 2005Qin G. Schwarz T. Kittel R.J. Schmid A. Rasse T.M. Kappei D.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3209-3218Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), are thought to be responsible for the majority, if not all, of the postsynaptic signal transmission at larval NMJs (Marrus et al., 2004Marrus S.B.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3209-3218Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The increased mEJP amplitudes seen during phase I potentiation could therefore rely on changes of any of the two major postsynaptic receptor complexes. We therefore used knockout mutants of dglurIIA and dglurIIB as well as gain-of-function genotypes to assess whether either of the two major receptor complexes is responsible for the large mEJPs observed in phase I. Consistent with previous results (DiAntonio et al., 1999DiAntonio A. Petersen S.A. Heckmann M. Goodman C.S.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7362-7372PubMed Google Scholar), we found that the mean mEJP amplitudes of lag phase larvae were smaller in DGluRIIA-ko mutants and larger in DGluRIIB-ko larvae compared to wild-type controls or larvae mildly overexpressing either DGluRIIA or DGluRIIB in larval muscles (filled bars in Figure 3A). However, all genotypes showed significant increases in mEJP amplitudes in phase I (white bars in Figure 3A), indicating that the experience-dependent changes of mEJP amplitudes are insensitive to the subunit composition of postsynaptic glutamate receptors. In addition, whenever mEJP amplitudes were increased we found a corresponding increase in eEJP amplitudes (white bars in Figure 3B), supporting the idea that the mEJP changes seen in phase I are involved in the potentiation of evoked responses in phase I. To assess whether other postsynaptic changes could be responsible for the occurrence of large mEJPs in phase I, we applied defined amounts of glutamate iontophoretically onto lag phase and phase I NMJs. We found that iontophoretic application of glutamate evoked consistent and argiotoxin-sensitive postsynaptic depolarizations (Figure 3C) that were similar in lag phase (28.1 ± 1.4 mV; n = 9) and phase I (25.2 ± 2.6 mV; n = 9; black bars in Figure 3D). However, the same cells showed significant differences in the mEJP amplitude (white bars in Figure 3D; lag phase: 1.1 ± 0.1 mV; phase I: 1.6 ± 0.12 mV; n = 9 each; p < 0.01). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that postsynaptic alterations are not responsible for the large mEJPs seen in phase I. Accumulating evidence from studies on larvae overexpressing VGLUT and mutants of genes encoding proteins involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (LAP180, synaptojanin) has suggested that glutamatergic vesicles can increase in size and are responsible for the occurrence of larger mEJPs (Daniels et al., 2004Daniels R.W.

To assess whether presynaptic vesicle sizes are altered during phase I potentiation, we performed an ultrastructural examination of type Ib boutons of lag phase and phase I NMJs. We blindly measured the outer diameters of 951 vesicles from 37 electron-dense profiles (Figure 4A) of lag phase NMJs (muscle 6/7, abdominal segment 2, two animals) and 1051 vesicles from 59 electron-dense profiles (Figure 4B) of phase I NMJs (two animals). The frequency histogram of measured outer vesicle diameters (Figure 4C) revealed that phase I synapses tend to harbor somewhat larger vesicles (whi"

Recent results show that 9-1-1 interacts with several base excision repair proteins. It binds the DNA glycosylase MutY homolog, and stimulates DNA polymerase β, flap endonuclease 1, and DNA ligase I. 9-1-1 resembles proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which stimulates some of these same repair enzymes, and is loaded onto DNA in a similar manner. The complex of 9-1-1 with DNA ligase I can be immunoprecipitated from human cells. Moreover, UV irradiation stimulates 9-1-1·ligase I complex formation, suggesting a role for 9-1-1 in DNA repair. Examining the nature of 9-1-1 interaction with DNA ligase I, we show that there is a similar degree of stimulation on ligation substrates with different structures, and that there is specificity for DNA ligase I. 9-1-1 improves the binding of DNA ligase I to nicked double strand DNA. Furthermore, although high concentrations of casein kinase II strongly inhibits DNA ligase I activity, it does not affect the ability of 9-1-1 to stimulate. This suggests that 9-1-1 is also an activator of DNA ligase I during DNA damage. Unlike PCNA, 9-1-1 stimulates DNA ligase I activity to the same extent on both linear and circular substrates, indicating that encirclement is not a requirement for stimulation. These data are consistent with a direct role for 9-1-1 in DNA repair, but possibly employing a different mechanism than PCNA.

Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) 2The abbreviations used are: PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; 9-1-1, Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 checkpoint complex; FEN1, flap endonuclease 1; CK2, casein kinase II; BER, base excision repair; LP, long patch; IR, ionizing radiation; RFC, replication factor C. is a toroidal sliding clamp that serves as a platform for the sequential actions of proteins involved in eukaryotic DNA replication and repair. DNA damage produces a response that inhibits DNA replication while allowing DNA repair. It includes induction of p21, a protein that mediates growth arrest. A domain of p21 binds and inactivates PCNA (1Chen J. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Dutta A. Nature. 1995; 374: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 2Luo Y. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Nature. 1995; 375: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Expression of this domain can cause cells to arrest in G1 phase, suggesting that inhibition of PCNA is part of the damage response (3Chen J. Peters R. Saha P. Lee P. Theodoras A. Pagano M. Wagner G. Dutta A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1727-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 4Chen U. Chen S. Saha P. Dutta A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Physiol. 2004; 286: L506-L513Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). PCNA binds and stimulates proteins with dual roles in DNA replication and repair, e.g. the flap endonuclease FEN1 and DNA ligase I (6Timson D.J. Singleton M.R. Wigley D.B. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 301-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In an effort to identify whether there is a substitute platform for DNA repair if PCNA were inactivated, we considered the Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 (9-1-1) checkpoint complex. Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 (9-1-1) bears a strong structural, but not sequence, resemblance to PCNA. It is loaded to encircle double-stranded DNA in vitro by a variant of RFC, the PCNA clamp loader, called Rad17-RFC (7Ellison V. Stillman B. PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: E33Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 8Zou L. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2003; 100: 1633-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Rad17-RFC can recruit 9-1-1 onto chromatin, and this action is independent of the phosphorylation of Rad17, which can be phosphorylated by ATM and ATR after DNA damage in vivo (10Bao S. Tibbetts R.S. Brumbaugh K.M. Fang Y. Richardson D.A. Ali A. Chen S.M. Abraham R.T. Wang X.F. Nature. 2001; 411: 969-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 11Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). These studies show that 9-1-1 can load on chromatin, recognize DNA damage, and then activate the checkpoint pathway, suggesting that 9-1-1 is a damage sensor (12Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-Kacmaz K. Linn S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar). Other results point to a direct role of 9-1-1 as a mediator and possible platform for DNA repair. 9-1-1 stimulates or associates with enzymes involved in nearly every step of the long patch base excision repair (LP-BER) pathway (13Helt C.E. Wang W. Keng P.C. Bambara R.A. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 529-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In this pathway, damaged bases are removed by glycosylases, the abasic site is cleaved by an abasic nuclease, and a short patch of synthesis is carried out by DNA polymerase β, δ, or ϵ, displacing a 5′ flap that is removed by FEN1. The nick produced by this reaction is sealed by DNA ligase I (14Dianov G.L. Sleeth K.M. Dianova I.I. Allinson S.L. Mutat. Res. 2003; 531: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The DNA glycosylase MutY homolog in yeast co-immunoprecipitated with the yeast 9-1-1 homolog (15Chang D.Y. Lu A.L. J. Biol.

Hottiger M.O. Hübscher U. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3316-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Finally, 9-1-1 was shown to bind DNA ligase I and stimulate ligation (19Smirnova E. Toueille M. Markkanen E. Hübscher U. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). DNA ligase I is toroidal and can encircle a nicked DNA substrate (20Pascal J.M. O'Brien P.J. Tomkinson A.E. Ellenberger T. Nature. 2004; 432: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). DNA ligase I activity is high in proliferating cells (21Soderhall S. Lindahl T.

Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Enzyme/DNA mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in binding buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 40 mm KCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin with 0.1 mm ATP). Samples were then run on a 12% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TBE buffer (44.5 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 1 mm Na2EDTA). The gel was analyzed by PhosphorImager. Immunoprecipitation—TK6 cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then harvested after treated by 9 gray γ-irradiation or 50 J/m2 UV. Nuclear extracts of TK6 cells were prepared by standard methods (38Wadman I.A. Osada H. Grutz G.G. Agulnick A.D. Westphal H. Forster A. Rabbitts T.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3145-3157Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Protein G beads (Roche Diagnostics) were equilibrated with buffer C + 0.01% Nonidet P-40 prior to addition of antibody. Five μl of human Rad9 monoclonal antibody (Calbiochem, San Diego) and hemagglutinin monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) were added to the protein G beads and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed twice with buffer C + 0.01% Nonidet P-40. 5 mg of nuclear extract was mixed with protein G beads and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed 3 times with buffer C + 0.01% Nonidet P-40 and then with buffer A + 0.01% Nonidet P-40. The beads were then collected by centrifugation. Sample buffer was added and then the samples were run on SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by DNA ligase I antibody (10H5, GeneTex, Inc., San Antonio, TX) and Rad9 antibody, respectively. Pulldown Assays—Because human DNA ligase I was tagged by histidine and human Rad1 was tagged by FLAG, 20 μl of histidine or FLAG antibody-conjugated beads were used in these experiments. Histidine antibody-conjugated agarose beads (Novus Biologicals, Inc.) and FLAG antibody-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma) were equilibrated with buffer C + 0.1% Nonidet P-40. One pmol of purified 9-1-1 or DNA ligase I was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with FLAG antibody-conjugated agarose beads and histidine antibody-conjugated agarose beads, respectively. After being washed twice with buffer C + 0.1% Nonidet P-40, FLAG beads or histidine beads were further incubated with 2 pmol of purified DNA ligase I or 9-1-1 at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were washed three times with buffer C + 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and once with buffer A + 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Finally beads were suspended in SDS sample buffer. After SDS-PAGE, samples were analyzed by DNA ligase I monoclonal antibody (10H5, GeneTex, Inc.) and Rad1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). 9-1-1 Interaction with DNA Ligase I Is Promoted by DNA Damage—PCNA has been shown to interact directly with both FEN1 and DNA ligase I. This interaction is presumed to mediate stimulation of both catalytic activities (39Li X. Li J. Harrington J. Lieber M.R. Burgers P.M. J. Biol.

Previous pulldown experiments showed that purified His-tagged DNA ligase I interacts with purified 9-1-1 (19Smirnova E. Toueille M. Markkanen E. Hübscher U. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Here we tested whether the two proteins interact in cell extracts. Human Rad9 monoclonal antibody was used for immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1A). The results showed that DNA ligase I was immunoprecipitated from either untreated TK6 cells (lane 1) or cells exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light (lanes 2 and 3). Significantly, the amount of DNA ligase I·Rad9 complex increased 2-fold in UV-irradiated cells compared with that in untreated cells. These results indicate that 9-1-1 and DNA ligase I do interact in vivo and that this interaction is stimulated by UV damage. The amount of DNA ligase I·Rad9 did not change in ionizing radiation (IR)-treated cells. This suggests that the nature of the damage determines the amount of complex formation. We also confirmed the interaction between purified DNA ligase I and 9-1-1 using a pulldown assay. We found that Rad1 could be pulled down only in the presence of DNA ligase I (Fig. 1B, lane 1). Similarly, we found that DNA ligase I could be pulled down only in the presence of 9-1-1 (Fig. 1B, lane 5), but not in its absence (Fig. 1B, lane 6). These results show that 9-1-1 directly interacts with DNA ligase I. 9-1-1 Stimulates DNA Ligase I without an Apparent Change in Mechanism—To assess the mechanism of stimulation of human DNA ligase I by 9-1-1, we first confirmed the robust stimulation reported on a linear nicked substrate (19Smirnova E. Toueille M. Markkanen E. Hübscher U. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, lanes 7–12). We then asked whether 9-1-1 altered the specificity of ligation for different types of substrates. We considered three possibilities. First, the substrate equilibrates into many structures only a few of which are ligatable. For this we employed a substrate with overlapping primers containing tandem CTG triplet repeats (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–6). The substrate can equilibrate into numerous bubble, flap, double flap, and fold-back flap structures (43Liu Y. Zhang H. Veeraraghavan J. Bambara R.A. Freudenreich C.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4049-4064Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 44Veeraraghavan J. Rossi M.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42854-42866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Only a few of the many possible structures have bubble configurations that produce a nick susceptible to ligation. Second, we tested a substrate with a nick in which the 5′ position was an abasic site (Fig. 2A, lanes 13–18). Third, the substrate had a nick with a mismatched 5′ nucleotide (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–6). In all cases, 9-1-1 stimulated ligase I activity to the same extent (Fig. 2, A and B). These results suggest that the stimulation is general, and not capable of altering substrate specificity.FIGURE 39-1-1 stimulates DNA ligase I but not T4 ligase. In the experiments, the 5′-end of the downstream primers of substrates were radiolabeled using [γ-32P]ATP. Each reaction contained 10 fmol of substrate (D1:T1:U1). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Lane 1 contained just substrate. Lane 2 contained substrate and 500 fmol of 9-1-1 complex. Lanes 3–8 contained substrate, 2 fmol of DNA ligase I, and 0, 25, 50, 100, 250, and 500 fmol of 9-1-1, respectively. The addition of 9-1-1 did not increase the amount of ligation product generated by T4 ligase (data not shown). The proportion of product was calculated as described in the legend of Fig. 2. nt, nucleotide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further assess specificity we compared the effect of 9-1-1 on T4 ligase and DNA ligase I (Fig. 3 and data not shown). Under our assay conditions, 9-1-1 enhanced DNA ligase I activity ∼6-fold and had no effect on T4 ligase (Fig. 3, lanes 4–8 and data not shown). This suggests a stimulation specificity for DNA ligase I. It is also consistent with the interpretation that 9-1-1 does not alter the structure of the substrate to make it more efficient for ligation. 9-1-1 Promotes DNA Ligase I Binding to Nicked Substrates—As with PCNA, the stimulation of ligation might be based on improved affinity for the substrate. To test this possibility, we assessed DNA ligase binding to the DNA substrate by a gel mobility shift assay. The results showed that 9-1-1 enhances DNA ligase I binding to nicked double-stranded DNA (Fig. 4, lanes 4–6). There is virtually no ligase binding to intact double-stranded DNA without 9-1-1, and only marginal binding is seen with 9-1-1 (Fig. 4, lane 7). Interestingly, no 9-1-1 remains with the DNA in the presence or absence of DNA ligase I. These results are consistent with improvement of ligase binding to the substrate or activation of more molecules of ligase for binding activity. 9-1-1 Enhances the Sequential Action of FEN1 and DNA Ligase I—FEN1 and DNA ligase I are thought to act sequentially in LP-BER. Because 9-1-1 interacts with both components, it might either enhance or interfere with their sequential functions. To resolve this question, we designed a substrate to simulate an LP-BER intermediate formed during the strand displacement synthesis step that pushes the 5′ abasic site up into a flap. Our substrate has an upstream primer and downstream flap annealed to a template in such a way that FEN1 cleavage would produce a nick for ligation. The upstream primer has an unannealed 3′-nucleotide creating the most favored double flap structure for FEN1 cleavage. Addition of DNA ligase I alone generated no product, verifying that the initial substrate has no nicks (Fig. 5, lane 2). In the presence of a limiting amount of FEN1 in the reaction to create nicks, a small amount of ligation product was observed (Fig. 5, lane 4). Following the addition of 9-1-1 complex, both increased FEN1 cleavage product and ligation product were observed, indicating that 9-1-1 stimulates both FEN1 and DNA ligase I. Using the same amount of 9-1-1 complex, the stimulation of FEN1 alone was 1.7-fold of that in the presence of DNA ligase I and FEN1 (Fig. 5, lanes 8 and 9). This is consistent with the efficient use of the FEN1 product as a substrate for ligation. These results show that 9-1-1 promotes stepwise FEN1 cleavage and DNA ligase I activity. Casein Kinase II Inhibits DNA Ligase I but Allows 9-1-1 Stimulation—Recent evidence indicates that phosphorylation of DNA ligase I by CK2 reduces its activity (42Tom S. Henricksen L.A. Park M.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24817-24825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 45Teraoka H. Minami H. Iijima S. Tsukada K. Koiwai O. Date T. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2925-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Similarly, it was found that CK2 phosphorylates the base excision repair protein XRCC1, suggesting that CK2 has a direct role in DNA repair (47Loizou J.I. El-Khamisy S.F. Zlatanou A. Moore D.J. Chan D.W. Qin J. Sarno S. Meggio F. Pinna L.A. Caldecott K.W. Cell. 2004; 117: 17-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). 9-1-1 stimulates ligation as expected in the absence of CK2 (Fig. 6A, lanes 4 and 5). In the presence of CK2, there is reduced ligation activity overall, but an enhancement by 9-1-1 is still observed (Fig. 6A, lanes 9 and 10). Moreover, the proportion of stimulation by 9-1-1 was approximately the same. Comparing lanes 3 to 8 in Fig. 6A, we found that DNA ligase I activity itself decreased by CK2. To clarify the effect of CK2 on ligation, we titrated the kinase included in the reaction. As shown in Fig. 6B, we observed that increased CK2 was progressively more inhibitory. DNA ligase I activity was almost completely abolished in the highest concentration of CK2 (lane 7, 2 milliunits/20 μl). In our previous studies, CK2 was shown to prevent PCNA from stimulating ligation activity by phosphorylating DNA ligase I (42Tom S. Henricksen L.A. Park M.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24817-24825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Here we showed that CK2 did not inhibit 9-1-1 stimulation activity, but altered the basal level of ligation activity indicating that the phosphorylation of DNA ligase I affects its interactions with these two clamps differently. 9-1-1 Can Stimulate DNA Ligase I without Encircling the DNA—Proper loading of PCNA so that it encircles DNA is carried out by RFC, an ATP-dependent clamp loader (48Waga S. Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). 9-1-1 can be loaded to encircle DNA by the variant RFC form Rad17-RFC (7Ellison V. Stillman B. PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: E33Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 8Zou L. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2003; 100: 1633-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). To determine whether 9-1-1 has to encircle the DNA to stimulate DNA ligase I, we employed primed ϕx174 circular single-stranded DNA. As shown in Fig. 7, even without Rad17-RFC and replication protein A, the addition of 9-1-1 still leads to increased DNA ligase I activity (Fig. 7, lanes 10–12). The degree of stimulation on the linear and circular substrates was nearly the same. We conclude that stimulation does not require 9-1-1 loading and encirclement of the DNA. We previously proposed that 9-1-1 is a damage-specific substitute for PCNA, in acting as a platform and coordination factor for DNA repair proteins (17Wang W. Brandt P. Rossi M.L. Lindsey-Boltz L. Podust V. Fanning E. Sancar A. Bambara R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16762-16767Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This possibility is consistent with the proposed movement of 9-1-1 to damage sites to serve its role as a damage sensor (49Jiang G. Sancar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It is also consistent with its structural and functional resemblance to PCNA. This hypothesis also offers an explanation for how repair functions could be maintained during a damage response in which p21 is induced and halts DNA replication by inactivation of PCNA (1Chen J. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Dutta A. Nature. 1995; 374: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 4Chen U. Chen S. Saha P. Dutta A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To gain insight into the molecular interactions of modified nucleotides, we investigated the modification status of Thermus thermophilus 5 S and 23 S ribosomal RNA by mass spectrometry and chemical derivatization/primer extension. A total of eleven modified nucleotides was found in 23 S rRNA, of which eight were singly methylated nucleotides and three were pseudouridines. These modified nucleotides were mapped into the published three-dimensional ribosome structure.

All cellular protein synthesis is performed by ribosomes, which are large ribonucleoprotein particles. The prokaryote ribosome consists of two stable and separable entities, a 50 S and a 30 S subunit. The 50 S subunit contains two rRNAs of ∼3000 and 120 nucleotides (23 S and 5 S rRNA, respectively) and around 35 proteins, whereas the 30 S subunit contains 16 S rRNA of ∼1600 nucleotides and around 20 proteins; the exact numbers vary with the species. Eukaryotic ribosomes are larger, but structural features are remarkably conserved between the domains of life. rRNAs are post-transcriptionally modified at specific nucleotides, but the number of modified nucleotides varies greatly. The large ribosomal RNA in mitochondria contains just a few modified nucleotides (1Sirum-Connolly K. Peltier J.M. Crain P.F. McCloskey J.A. Mason T.L. Biochimie (Paris). 1995; 77: 30-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), Escherichia coli 23 S rRNA has 25 (2Andersen T.E. Porse B.T. Kirpekar F. RNA (N.

Progress Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 39: 241-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The function of post-transcriptional rRNA modifications is far from clear, although they have been implicated in various processes. Specific rRNA methylation is used by numerous antibiotics-producing microorganisms as a means of autoprotection (see e.g. Refs. 5Treede I. Jacobsen L. Kirpekar F. Vester B. Weitnauer G. Douthwaite S. Bechthold A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar and 6Skinner R.H. Cundliffe E. J. General Microbiol. 1982; 128: 2411-2416Google Scholar), but only a small fraction of post-transcriptional modifications can be assigned to this well defined function. E. coli 23 S rRNA modifications cluster in functionally principal parts of the ribosome such as the peptidyl transferase center and inter-subunit bridges when modeled into the structure of the Haloarcula marismortui large ribosomal subunit (7Hansen M.A. Kirpekar F. Ritterbusch W. Vester B. RNA (N. Y.). 2002; 8: 202-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The modified nucleotides in the central domains of 23 S rRNA from H. marismortui itself are all located in regions of intra- or intermolecular RNA-RNA contact (8Kirpekar F. Hansen L.H. Rasmussen A. Poehlsgaard J. Vester B. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 563-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) suggesting structure stabilization. The post-transcriptionally modified rRNAs are essential for assembly of functional E. coli ribosomal subunits (9Cunningham P.R. Richard R.B. Weitzmann C.J. Nurse K. Ofengand J. Biochimie (Paris). 1991; 73: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 10Green R. Noller H.F. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 1011-1021PubMed Google Scholar). This is in contrast to Bacillus stearothermophilus, where functional ribosomes can be assembled with in vitro transcribed 23 S rRNA, albeit less efficiently than with authentic 23 S rRNA (11Green R. Noller H.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Inactivation of the modifying enzymes in E. coli has been reported to impair protein synthesis and cell growth (12Caldas T. Binet E. Bouloc P. Richarme G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Gustafsson C. Persson B. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 359-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Raychaudhuri S. Conrad J. Hall B.G.

Because it is now well established that the 23 S rRNA constitutes the peptidyl transferase activity with numerous modified nucleotides but no proteins located in the active site (19Yusupov M.M.

Most of the modifications were found directly by mass spectrometry (MS), but the mass-silent modification pseudouridine was located by chemical modification with a carbodiimide reagent followed by reverse transcriptase primer extension (24Bakin A. Ofengand J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9754-9762Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). A total of 11 modified nucleotides were found and were fitted into the three-dimensional structure of the T. thermophilus ribosome (19Yusupov M.M. Yusupova G.Z. Baucom A. Lieberman K. Earnest T.N. Cate J.H.D. Noller H.F. Science. 2001; 292: 883-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar). The function of the modified nucleotides is discussed in light of their placement. Isolation of rRNA—T. thermophilus (strain HB8) was grown as batch culture in a 3-liter BTS-05 bioreactor (Applicon, B.V., Schiedam, the Netherlands) at 72 °C and pH-controlled at 7.5. The growth medium contained 4 g/liter yeast extract, 8 g/liter polypeptone, and 2 g/liter NaCl with maize oil as antifoam. Ribosomal subunits from 30-g dry weight of harvested cells were prepared via sucrose gradients as described (25Gogoya Z.V. Yusupov M.M. Spirina T.N. Mol. Biol. 1986; 20: 415-421Google Scholar). The fractions containing the large ribosomal subunit were pooled, and the RNA-protein complex was precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ethanol. The RNA was purified by three rounds of extraction with a 1:1-mixture of phenol/chloroform and recovered by ethanol precipitation. 5 S rRNA was separated from 23 S rRNA by ultrafiltration through a Microcon YM-100 membrane filter (Millipore) as described by the manufacturer. The flow-through contained the 5 S rRNA. 23 S rRNA was isolated from 5 S rRNA by gel filtration through a Microspin S400 HR column (Amersham Biosciences) as recommended by the manufacturer. Details on the site-directed mung bean nuclease protection for isolation of rRNA subfragments can be found in a previous study (2Andersen T.E. Porse B.T. Kirpekar F. RNA (N. Y.). 2004; 10: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to T. thermophilus 23 S rRNA position 2505-2568 (E. coli 2492-2557) or 2240-2289 (E. coli 2229-2278) were annealed to the 23 S rRNA followed by digestion with a combination of mung bean nuclease and RNase A to degrade single-stranded nucleic acids. The digestion mixture was separated on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel and stained with ethidium bromide. The band corresponding to the protected 23 S rRNA subfragment was cut out and eluted. RNase Digestion— 6 pmol of 5 S rRNA was digested with either 0.4 μg of RNase A (Sigma) or 10 units of RNase T1 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), and 2 pmol of 23 S rRNA was digested with either 3 μg of RNase A or 100 units of RNase T1 as described (26Kirpekar F. Douthwaite S. Roepstorff P. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). 0.5 volume of 0.5 m HCl was added to the RNase T1 digestions to hydrolyze 2′,3′-cyclic phosphates with incubation at room temperature for 30 min. The HCl was removed under vacuum after addition of 4 volumes of H2O. The 23 S rRNA digestions were size-separated by in-house fabricated micro reverse-phase columns (5Treede I. Jacobsen L. Kirpekar F. Vester B. Weitnauer G. Douthwaite S. Bechthold A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) with minor adjustments. Poros 50R3 (Perseptive Biosystems) was used as column material, and columns were equilibrated and washed with 10 mm triethylammonium acetate (TEAA) pH 7.0. RNase A digestions were eluted in two steps using 8% acetonitrile (MeCN)/10 mm TEAA and 15% MeCN/10 mm TEAA, respectively. The first elution buffer contained 6% MeCN/10 mm TEAA for the RNase T1 digestions. The eluates were dried and dissolved in water to a final concentration of to 2 pmol of intact rRNA per microliter. Mass Spectrometry and Data Analysis—MALDI mass spectrometry was performed as previously described (26Kirpekar F. Douthwaite S. Roepstorff P. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) using 3-hydroxypicolinic acid as matrix on either a Bruker Reflex IV (Bruker-Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) or a Perseptive Voyager STR (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) instrument in positive ion reflector mode, using delayed ion extraction. The spectra were processed using the “m/z” free software (Proteomics Ltd., New York, NY) with three-point internal calibration on predicted unmodified digestion fragments. Theoretical digestions of rRNA were done using a “Mongo Oligo Mass Calculator” (www-medstat.med.utah.edu/massspec/mongo.htm). The calculated compositions from observed masses were obtained by using an “Oligo Composition Calculator” (medstat.med.utah.edu/masspec/compo.htm) with the following parameters: a mass accuracy of ±0.005%, one to four methyl groups, and one to three guanosine nucleotides for RNase T1 digestions or one to three pyrimidine nucleotides for RNase A digestions. Matching of nucleotide compositions to the T. thermophilus 23 S rRNA sequence was done with the GPMAW software (Lighthouse Data, Odense, Denmark). MALDI quadrupole time-of-flight (MicroMass, Manchester, UK) tandem mass spectrometry on positive ions was performed as reported (27Mengel-Jorgensen J. Kirpekar F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e135Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Nanoelectrospray ionization on a Bruker Esquire electrospray ion trap instrument (Bruker-Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) was performed in negative ion mode. These samples were dissolved in 50% MeCN/10 mm TEAA to a concentration of 1-2 pmol/μl. The nanoelectrospray needles (Proxeon, Odense, Denmark) were washed with 80% formic acid prior to sample loading to reduce cation salt formation. Sequencing of 23 S/5 S rRNA Operons—T. thermophilus has two operons coding for 23 S and 5 S rRNA. The two operons have identical 5′-promoter regions but different 3′-downstream regions (28Vogel D.W. Hartmann R.K. Kröger B. Ulbrich N. Erdmann V.A. Biochem. Int. 1987; 14: 167-175Google Scholar). Two PCRs were performed with the common promoter-specific primer 5′-AGCGGGGGATCTTGAAAGCTGGGGT-3′ (−54 to −30 upstream of the coding region) and the two different downstream primers 5′-TGTCTAGAAGCTTCACCTTATCCCCCTTTGC-3′ (complementary to position 3270-3300 in the region termed “675” in Ref. 28Vogel D.W. Hartmann R.K. Kröger B. Ulbrich N. Erdmann V.A. Biochem. Int. 1987; 14: 167-175Google Scholar) or 5′-ACGCGCCCACCTGGAGGTGT-3′ (complementary to position 3273-3292 in the region termed “700” in Ref. 28Vogel D.W. Hartmann R.K. Kröger B. Ulbrich N. Erdmann V.A. Biochem. Int. 1987; 14: 167-175Google Scholar) to amplify the two operons. The DNA template was obtained from a T. thermophilus colony that was suspended in water and boiled. The desired PCR products were purified via agarose gels and sequenced using a “Big Dye” terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). Regions of 23 S rDNA that did not correspond to the sequence published by Hopfl et al. (29Hopfl P. Ulbrich N. Hartmann R.K. Ludwig W. Schleifer K.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9043Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) (GenBank™ accession number X12612) were sequenced on both strands. GenBank™ accession numbers for the two T. thermophilus 23 S/5S operons are AY379548 and AY379549, respectively. Structure Modulation of T. thermophilus Ribosome—The coordinates for the structure of the T. thermophilus ribosome reported in a previous study (19Yusupov M.M. Yusupova G.Z. Baucom A. Lieberman K. Earnest T.N. Cate J.H.D. Noller H.F. Science. 2001; 292: 883-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar) can be found in the Protein Data Bank (accession 1GIY). The MOLMOL software (30Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6487) Google Scholar) was used to investigate the ribosome structure around the methylated nucleotides and to graphically highlight these nucleotides. Sequencing of T. thermophilus 23 S/5 S rDNA Genes—Our strategy for mapping post-transcriptional modifications is based on complete digestion of the RNA with a nucleotide-specific RNase and subsequent analysis of the digestion mixture by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Fragments harboring post-transcriptional modifications are identified by deviations between the observed fragment masses and the masses calculated from the gene sequence (26Kirpekar F. Douthwaite S. Roepstorff P. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We therefore needed the exact sequence of the T. thermophilus large ribosomal subunit RNA genes. T. thermophilus has two operons each encompassing genes for 23 S rRNA, 5 S rRNA, and tRNAGly. After PCR amplification, we sequenced each of the 23 S/5 S rDNA operons and found them identical. Compared with the previously published 23 S rDNA (29Hopfl P. Ulbrich N. Hartmann R.K. Ludwig W. Schleifer K.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9043Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) (GenBank™ accession number X12612), G445 and G1180 were absent and an extra Gly at position 519 was present in our version of T. thermophilus strain HB8. The 5 S rDNA was identical to the previously published sequences (28Vogel D.W. Hartmann R.K. Kröger B. Ulbrich N. Erdmann V.A. Biochem. Int. 1987; 14: 167-175Google Scholar). Detection of 23 S rRNA Post-transcriptional Modifications by Mass Spectrometry—rRNA from the large ribosomal subunit was purified via isolation of the ribosomes followed by separation of the ribosomal subunits by centrifugation through sucrose density gradients. The 23 S/5 S rRNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction, and the two rRNA species were size-separated by gel filtration or ultrafiltration. The 5 S rRNA was digested to completion with either RNase A or RNase T1, and the digestions were mass analyzed (data not shown). We did not detect any post-transcriptional modifications in 5 S rRNA, which is in accordance with absence of post-transcriptional modifications in all other bacterial 5 S rRNA investigated. The only unexpected observation was the presence of a mixed population of 5 S rRNAs with either a single or two A-nucleotides at the 5′-end. T. thermophilus 23 S rRNA was likewise digested to completion with either RNase A or RNase T1. The digestions were additionally separated into two fractions by reverse phase chromatography. This was necessary mainly to reduce the amount of mono- and dinucleotides that otherwise tend to form gas-phase clusters appearing in the m/z regions of less abundant digestion fragments of larger size. Fig. 1A shows the low mass region of the RNase A digestion. Four fragments, at m/z 990.14, 1671.30, 1718.24, and 1992.33 did not correspond to calculated digestion fragments, and are therefore likely to harbor a post-transcriptional modification. No further potentially modified fragments were identified in the higher m/z range after RNase A digestion (data not shown). Fig. 1B shows the high mass region of the RNase T1 digestion; here a single candidate for a post-transcriptionally modified fragment appeared at m/z 3565.51. Spectra from the lower m/z regions indicated candidates for post-transcriptionally modified fragments at m/z 723.16, 1013.16, 1623.21, and 3213.32 after RNase T1 cleavage (Table 1).TABLE 1Modified nucleotides in T. thermophilus 23 S rRNA as identified by RNase digestion, MS, and MS/MSm/zEnzymeSequence by composition calculation and tandem MSaNm indicates ribose methylation, mN indicates base methylation (with methylated atom designate by the number in superscript), and N+Me indicates a not precisely located methyl groupSequence present in 23 S rRNAbThe fragment is assumed to be preceded by, and end in, an RNase substrate nucleotide in the 23 S rRNA sequenceModifications in 23 S rRNAaNm indicates ribose methylation, mN indicates base methylation (with methylated atom designate by the number in superscript), and N+Me indicates a not precisely located methyl groupAnalogous nucleotides in E. coli990.14RNase A[Um]GU11 timesUm2563cModified nucleotide assigned after site-directed mung bean nuclease purification of a 23 S rRNA subfragments; see text for detailsUm25521671.30RNase AGAA[AU+Me]5 timesmU1960dThis RNase A fragment is assumed to overlap with the RNase T1 fragment at position 1932–1942m5U19391718.24RNase AG[Gm]GGC6 timesGm2262cModified nucleotide assigned after site-directed mung bean nuclease purification of a 23 S rRNA subfragments; see text for detailsGm22511992.33RNase AAA[Cm]GGUOnce (1939–1944)Cm1941C1920 unmodified723.16RNase T1[Gm]G163 timesGm2262cModified nucleotide assigned after site-directed mung bean nuclease purification of a 23 S rRNA subfragments; see text for detailsGm22511013.16RNase T1[mA]UG17 timesmA2514cModified nucleotide assigned after site-directed mung bean nuclease purification of a 23 S rRNA subfragments; see text for detailsm2A25031623.21RNase T1AC[mC]UGOnce (1981–1985)mC1983m5C19623213.32RNase T1AAA[U+Me]UC[C+Me]UUGOnce (1957–1966)mU1960; C1963+Mem5U1939; C1942 unmodified3565.51RNase T1UAAC[U+Me]AUAA[CG+Me]Once (1932–1942)mU1936; Cm1941m3Ψ1915; C1920 unmodifieda Nm indicates ribose methylation, mN indicates base methylation (with methylated atom designate by the number in superscript), and N+Me indicates a not precisely located methyl groupb The fragment is assumed to be preceded by, and end in, an RNase substrate nucleotide in the 23 S rRNA sequencec Modified nucleotide assigned after site-directed mung bean nuclease purification of a 23 S rRNA subfragments; see text for detailsd This RNase A fragment is assumed to overlap with the RNase T1 fragment at position 1932–1942 Open table in a new tab Determination of Modified Nucleotides—McCloskey and co-workers have reported how the nucleotide composition and methylation level of RNase T1 digestion products can be predicted as a function of mass accuracy (31Pomerantz S.C. Kowalak J.A. McCloskey J.A. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 4: 204-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Methylation is by far the most common mass-increasing modification in rRNA. We therefore calculated the possible nucleotide composition of all the above fragments potentially harboring post-transcriptionally modified nucleotides assuming a mass accuracy of ±0.005%, allowing one to four methyl groups and up to two sites where cleavage after the normal target nucleotides is prevented due to methylation. The calculations gave unique composition for all digestion fragments, but for the two longest RNase T1 fragments, which yielded three and four possible compositions, respectively. We then compared potential compositions of all the modified digestion fragments to the T. thermophilus 23 S rRNA sequence, also taking the enzyme specificities into account. An RNase substrate nucleotide was assumed in the 3′-end of the fragment, and methylations were assumed on internal, uncleaved substrate nucleotides. Only the largest modified RNase T1 fragment (m/z 3565.51) could be located on the T. thermophilus 23 S by this strategy, here to position 1932-1942. All the remaining smaller modified RNase fragments could have originated from numerous positions in the 23 S rRNA, and an exact location could therefore not be assigned. We subsequently performed tandem mass spectrometry on the post-transcriptionally modified (i.e. methylated) fragments to obtain a sequence and information on the exact location of the modification; the predicted compositions were taken into account in tandem mass spectrum interpretations. Fig. 2A shows an electrospray ionization-ion trap MS/MS mass spectrum of the doubly deprotonated RNase T1 digestion fragment with the predicted composition (A, C2, G, U, and Me). The sequence 5′-AC[C+Me]UG-3′ can be read from the c- and y-ion series (nomenclature according to Ref. 32McLuckey S.A. Van Berkel G.J. Glish G.L. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1992; 3: 60-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), and the methyl group must be on the nucleobase, because a distinct signal corresponding to neutral loss of a methylated cytosine is present at m/z 748.0. An RNase T1 digestion fragment with the deduced sequence 5′-ACCUG-3′ preceded by a G-nucleotide is present only once in T. thermophilus 23 S rRNA, and we can therefore assign the methylated C to position 1983. An example of MS3 to disclose a methyl group on the ribose is shown in Fig. 2B. The MS/MS results of the RNase A digestion fragment (G, U2, and Me) revealed that the methyl group was present on a tandem MS fragment that harbored the first two nucleotides (a c2-fragment; not shown). Using this fragment as precursor for MS3 resulted in signals corresponding to an unmodified G-nucleotide (x1) and the loss of an unmodified uracil-base (M-UH)−, leaving the ribose of the uridine-nucleotide as the only possible site for methylation. We obtained better tandem MS results on the larger digestion products with a MALDI-quadrupole-TOF instrument, exemplified in Fig. 3 with the m/z 3213.38 species from the RNase T1 digestion as precursor ion. A series of backbone fragment ions (dominated by y-ions) plus a series of y8-ions that have lost consecutive nucleotides from the 3′-end allowed complete reading of the sequence. The two methyl groups were assigned to U1960 and C1963, respectively. By a similar tandem MS approach, we assigned the two methyl groups in the m/z 3565.51 RNase T1 digestion fragment to U1937 and C1941. The C1941-methylation is on the ribose, deduced from tandem MS of the unique overlapping RNase A fragment at m/z 1992.33. The sequence of the modified digestion fragments together with the sites of methylations as determined by tandem MS are summarized in Table 1. Assuming that the RNase T1 fragment [Gm]G overlaps with the RNase A fragment G[Gm]GGC, and that the RNase A fragment GAA[AU+Me] overlaps with the RNase T1 fragment AAA[U+Me]UC[C+Me]UUG, we found eight nucleotide monomethylations in the 23 S rRNA from T. thermophilus. Three of the methylated nucleotides could not be assigned to a specific position in the 23 S rRNA, because their sequence contexts were present in numerous copies. These were [Um]GU, [mA]UG, and G[Gm]GGC. However, comparison with modification patterns in other organisms gives suggestions to the location of these modifications. E. coli and a number of other species harbor ribose-methylated uridine at position 2552 (E. coli numbering) in the sequence context [Um]GU, identical to the above (1Sirum-Connolly K. Peltier J.M.

https://openalex.org/W2019577645,"Mast cells express the high affinity IgE receptor FcϵRI, which upon aggregation by multivalent antigens elicits signals that cause rapid changes within the mast cell and in the surrounding tissue. We previously showed that FcϵRI aggregation caused a rapid increase in phosphorylation of both Fer and Fps/Fes kinases in bone marrow-derived mast cells. In this study, we report that FcϵRI aggregation leads to increased Fer/Fps kinase activities and that Fer phosphorylation downstream of FcϵRI is independent of Syk, Fyn, and Gab2 but requires Lyn. Activated Fer/Fps readily phosphorylate the C terminus of platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (Pecam-1) on immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) and a non-ITIM residue (Tyr700) in vitro and in transfected cells. Mast cells devoid of Fer/Fps kinase activities display a reduction in FcϵRI aggregation-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Pecam-1, with no defects in recruitment of Shp1/Shp2 phosphatases observed. Lyn-deficient mast cells display a dramatic reduction in Pecam-1 phosphorylation at Tyr685 and a complete loss of Shp2 recruitment, suggesting a role as an initiator kinase for Pecam-1. Consistent with previous studies of Pecam-1-deficient mast cells, we observe an exaggerated degranulation response in mast cells lacking Fer/Fps kinases at low antigen dosages. Thus, Lyn and Fer/Fps kinases cooperate to phosphorylate Pecam-1 and activate Shp1/Shp2 phosphatases that function in part to limit mast cell activation.

Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 931-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). FcϵRI signaling is initiated by binding of IgE, which is sufficient for induction of survival pathways as well as cytokine production (3Kalesnikoff J. Huber M. Lam V. Damen J.E. Zhang J.

Some highly cytokinergic IgEs can induce antigen-independent degranulation, survival, adhesion, and chemotaxis of mast cells (5Kawakami T. Kitaura J. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 4167-4173Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, in most cases, aggregation of FcϵRI by multivalent antigens is required for a full mast cell response including degranulation, lipid mediator release, increased cell adhesion, and increased motility (6Metcalfe D.D. Baram D. Mekori Y.A. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1033-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar). The Src family protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) Lyn is constitutively associated with FcϵRI (7Vonakis B.M. Haleem-Smith H. Benjamin P. Metzger H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and upon antigen-mediated clustering of receptor chains, Lyn phosphorylates ITAMs on β- and γ-chains. The β-chain ITAMs are thought to recruit additional Lyn and Fyn kinases, the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, SH2-containing inositol 5′-phosphatase, and Shp2 phosphatase (8Furumoto Y. Nunomura S. Terada T. Rivera J. Ra C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49177-49187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated ITAMs on the γ-chains recruit the dual SH2 domain-containing PTK Syk (9Siraganian R.P. Zhang J. Suzuki K. Sada K. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 38: 1229-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Syk activity is essential for signal transduction downstream of FcϵRI, because Syk-deficient mast cells fail to degranulate, synthesize leukotrienes, and secrete cytokines following antigen challenge (10Costello P.S. Turner M. Walters A.E. Cunningham C.N. Bauer P.H. Downward J. Tybulewicz V.L. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2595-2605PubMed Google Scholar). Although FcϵRI-induced tyrosine phosphorylation is greatly reduced in Syk-deficient mast cells, phosphorylation of the receptor ITAMs and Lyn are maintained (10Costello P.S. Turner M. Walters A.E. Cunningham C.N. Bauer P.H. Downward J. Tybulewicz V.L. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2595-2605PubMed Google Scholar). Lyn-deficient mast cells, despite severely reduced tyrosine phosphorylation and delayed calcium flux, are able to degranulate and secrete cytokines (11Odom S. Gomez G. Kovarova M. Furumoto Y. Ryan J.J. Wright H.V. Gonzalez-Espinosa C. Hibbs M.L. Harder K.W. Rivera J. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1491-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In fact, Lyn-deficient mast cells release more of the granule constituent β-hexosaminidase than do wild type mast cells. Further studies have shown that multiple responses to FcϵRI aggregation are delayed in Lyn-deficient mast cells, including tyrosine phosphorylation of receptor subunits, calcium flux, and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate production but persist far longer than in wild type mast cells (12Hernandez-Hansen V.

Other notable characteristics of Lyn-deficient mast cells are that Fyn kinase is hyperactivate, whereas SH2-containing inositol 5-phosphatase is completely inactive (12Hernandez-Hansen V. Smith A.J. Surviladze Z. Chigaev A. Mazel T. Kalesnikoff J. Lowell C.A. Krystal G. Sklar L.A. Wilson B.S. Oliver J.M. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 100-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to initiating signaling downstream of FcϵRI, Lyn is also involved in signal termination at least partly through activation of SHZ-containing inositol 5-phosphatase, which hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and thereby reduces the plasma membrane localization of pleckstrin homology domain-containing proteins. The pleckstrin homology domain-containing adaptor protein Gab2 (Grb2-associated binding-2), is required for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation (13Gu H. Saito K. Klaman L.D. Shen J. Fleming T. Wang Y. Pratt J.C. Lin G. Lim B. Kinet J.P. Neel B.G. Nature. 2001; 412: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and, together with Fyn, contributes to activation of RhoA, microtubule formation, and delivery of granules to the plasma membrane (14Nishida K. Yamasaki S. Ito Y. Kabu K. Hattori K. Tezuka T. Nishizumi H. Kitamura D. Goitsuka R. Geha R.S. Yamamoto T. Yagi T. Hirano T. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar).FcϵRI aggregation also leads to phosphorylation of plateletendothelial cell adhesion molecule (Pecam-1) on ITIMs that recruit Shp1 and Shp2 phosphatases (15Sagawa K. Kimura T. Swieter M. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31086-31091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Both Pecam-1 and Shp1 have been shown to negatively regulate FcϵRI-triggered degranulation, although the mechanism has not been established (16Kamata T. Yamashita M. Kimura M. Murata K. Inami M.

Miller S. Mohsenin A. Tucker A. Madri J.A. Dev. Biol. 2001; 232: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 19Carrithers M. Tandon S. Canosa S. Michaud M. Graesser D. Madri J.A. Am. J.

Physiol. 2005; 288: H159-H164Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This has been attributed to impaired signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation in endothelial cells and lymphocytes and elevated production of inflammatory cytokines in Pecam-deficient mice. Phosphorylation of a non-ITIM tyrosine (Tyr701) in human Pecam-1 allows recruitment of STAT3 or STAT5 via their SH2 domains (19Carrithers M. Tandon S. Canosa S. Michaud M. Graesser D. Madri J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2005; 166: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). While tethered to Pecam-1, STAT3 phosphorylation is likely regulated by a Pecam-1-associated kinase or Shp2 phosphatase (21Ilan N. Madri J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar).We recently showed that Fps and Fer kinases are both activated within 1 min of FcϵRI aggregation (22Craig A. Greer P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6363-6374Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism by which FcϵRI aggregation leads to Fps and Fer activation is unknown, one or more of Lyn, Fyn, and Syk are likely required, because these are the earliest signaling molecules activated upon FcϵRI aggregation. Here, we report that FcϵRI aggregation leads to elevated Fer and Fps kinase activities. Phosphorylation of Fer and Fps downstream of FcϵRI is independent of Syk, Fyn, and Gab2 but requires Lyn kinase for rapid activation. Once activated, Fer and Fps can phosphorylate both ITIMs and a non-ITIM residue (Tyr700) in Pecam-1. In mast cells devoid of Fer/Fps kinase activities, the overall phosphorylation of Pecam-1 is reduced, whereas recruitment of Shp1/Shp2 is unaffected. In contrast, Lyn-deficient mast cells display a significant defect in Pecam-1 phosphorylation and Shp2 recruitment. Similar to previous studies on Pecam-1- and Shp1-deficient mast cells, we observe a hyperdegranulation response in Fer/Fps-deficient mast cells at low antigen dosages. Thus, a Lyn/Fer/Fps pathway from FcϵRI to Pecam-1/Shp1 functions in limiting mast cell activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Strain-matched wild type and transgenic mice used in this study have been described: ferDR/DR (DR) (23Craig A.W.

Phycoerythrin-conjugated CD117 (c-Kit; BD Biosciences), and fluorescein-conjugated anti-IgE (Southern Biotech) were used along with isotype controls to assess the maturity of BMMCs by flow cytometry.Pecam-1 Expression Plasmids—Bacterial expression constructs were generated using glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions to the cytoplasmic tail of Pecam-1 by amplification of the desired sequences from either plasmid DNAs or from cDNA pools from BMMCs generated by reverse transcription-PCR. The full-length Pecam-1 C-tail (with and without ITIM mutations) was amplified from mouse Pecam-1 expression plasmids provided by Andre Veillette (Institut de Recherches Cliniques, Montreal, Canada) (28Cao M.Y.

The Δ14/15 isoform was derived from an IMAGE clone (Open Biosystems), and the Δ15 isoform was cloned from BMMC cDNA. GST fusion proteins were purified from transformed BL21 using glutathione-conjugated beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences).A point mutation in exon 15 (Y700F) was made in the Pecam-1 cDNA (wild type and Y662F) using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the following primers: 5′-AATCTCATGGAAAACAGATTCTCGAGAACGGAAGGCTCCC-3′ and 5′-AGCCTTCCGTTCTCGAGAATCTGTTTTCCATGAGATTAGG-3′.BMMC Cultures—Femurs were isolated aseptically from 4–8-week-old, strain-matched wild type and transgenic or knock-out mice, and bone marrow cells were isolated by repeated flushing with BMMC medium (Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% (v/v) antimicrobial-antimycotic solution (Invitrogen), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), 1% (v/v) nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), 1% (v/v) conditioned medium from X63-IL-3 cells (32Xie Z.H. Ambudkar I. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4682-4691Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Rob Rottapel, University of Toronto), 50 μm α-monothioylglycolate (Sigma)). The cultures were maintained at 0.5 × 106 to 1.5 × 106/ml of nonadherent cells, with adherent cells being discarded. After >4 weeks of culturing, the purity of BMMCs was monitored by flow cytometry. For the detection of FcϵRI, 106 BMMCs were incubated overnight with antibody to α-dinitrophenyl (DNP) IgE (1 μg/ml (Sigma) or in some cases 10% (v/v) conditioned medium from SPE-7 cells (kindly provided by Juan Rivera, National Institutes of Health)), washed, and then labeled with α-IgE-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC; Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.) and α-Kit-phycoerythrin (Caltag Labs), or with isotype controls: rat IgG1-FITC (Caltag Labs) and rat IgG2b-phycoerythrin (Caltag Labs) and analyzed by flow cytometry. Prior to experimentation, all of the BMMCs were ≥90% positive for both c-Kit and FcϵRI, as measured by flow cytometry.BMMC Stimulations—BMMCs (107/time point) were simultaneously starved of IL-3 and incubated with anti-DNP-IgE (SPE-7 clone; 10% (v/v)) for 18 h, rinsed in Tyrode's buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.4 mm CaCl, 1 mm MgCl, 5.6 mm glucose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin), and resuspended in Tyrode's with or without DNP-HSA (100 ng/ml (Sigma)) for the times indicated in each figure or figure legend. BMMCs were rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (containing sodium orthovanadate) and lysed in kinase lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 10 μg of aprotinin/ml, 10 μg of leupeptin/ml, 1 mm vanadate, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After centrifugation, soluble cell lysates (SCLs) were obtained and subjected to immunoprecipitations (IPs) using Gamma-bind Sepharose (for polyclonals; Amersham Biosciences) or protein G-agarose (for monoclonals; Roche Applied Science).In Vitro Kinase Assays—The in vitro kinase assays using [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were performed on anti-DNP-IgE-sensitized BMMCs (WT, DR, and KR/DR) treated with or without DNP-HSA in kinase reaction buffer, as previously described (27Craig A.W.B. Zirngibl R. Greer P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19934-19942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To assess the preferred sites of Pecam-1 tyrosine phosphorylation by Fer and Fps, we performed similar in vitro kinase assays, but with unlabeled ATP (1 μm), and analyzed them by Western blotting with anti-pY.Transfection of Pecam-1 and Fer Plasmids—COS-7 cells were grown on 60-mm plates and transfected with the indicated combinations of mouse Pecam-1 and Myc-tagged Fer (WT and KR) expression plasmids using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). SCLs were prepared after 48 h of transfection and subjected to IPs, followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as indicated.BMMC Degranulation Assay—Degranulation assays using annexin V-reactivity of cells that have undergone fusion with exocytic vesicles were performed as described (29Demo S.D. Masuda E. Rossi A.B. Throndset B.T. Gerard A.L. Chan E.H. Armstrong R.J. Fox B.P. Lorens J.B. Payan D.G. Scheller R.H. Fisher J.M.

Briefly, WT and KR/DR BMMCs were sensitized with anti-TNP-IgE (1 μg/ml; BD Biosciences) for 18 h and washed once in warm Tyrode's buffer, and 5 × 105 cells were stimulated in the absence and presence of DNP-HSA (0.1, 1, 10, and 100 ng/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C. BMMCs were washed once prior to staining with propidium iodide (2 μg/ml) and FITC-conjugated annexin V (5 μl/sample). The percentage of annexin V-positive/propidium iodide-negative cells and mean fluorescence intensity (of annexin V staining) were analyzed on an EPICS Altra HSS flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter).RESULTSIncreased Activities of Fer and Fps Kinases upon Aggregation of FcϵRI on Mast Cells—We previously reported that FcϵRI aggregation induces phosphorylation of Fer and Fps kinases in mast cells (22Craig A. Greer P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6363-6374Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The fact that kinase-defective mutants of Fps and Fer also become phosphorylated upon FcϵRI aggregation (24Senis Y.A. Craig A.W. Greer P.A. Exp. Hematol. 2003; 31: 673-681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) suggests that Fer and Fps are substrates for an upstream kinase. To address potential effects of FcϵRI aggregation-induced phosphorylation on Fer and Fps kinase activities, we cultured BMMCs from WT, ferDR/DR (DR), and fpsKR/KRferDR/DR (KR/DR) mice, sensitized with anti-DNP-IgE, and treated them with or without antigen (DNP-HSA). Soluble cell lysates were subjected to IP with anti-Fps/Fer antisera (which recognizes both proteins (27Craig A.W.B. Zirngibl R. Greer P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19934-19942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)), and in vitro kinase assays were performed (Fig. 1A). The lysates from either untreated or DNP-HSA-treated BMMCs are indicated at the top. Recombinant, purified GST, or a GST fusion to the cytoplasmic tail of Pecam-1 (Δ14/15 isoform, containing only one ITIM residue, Tyr662) were added as potential substrates. In WT cells, IPs recovered both Fer and Fps kinases (lanes 1–3, lower panel). Fer and Fps displayed increased autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation when recovered from cells treated with antigen (lanes 1–3, top panel). To address Fps activity directly, we performed a similar assay on DR BMMCs (which lack Fer kinase activity and express very low levels of FerDR because of protein instability (23Craig A.W. Zirngibl R. Williams K. Cole L.A. Greer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar)). Both autophosphorylation of Fps and substrate phosphorylation were significantly elevated upon antigen treatment (compare lanes 5 and 6, with lane 4 in top panel). To address whether substrate phosphorylation was indeed carried out by Fer and Fps kinases, we performed a parallel experiment with KR/DR BMMCs (which lack both Fer and Fps kinase activities (24Senis Y.A. Craig A.W. Greer P.A. Exp. Hematol. 2003; 31: 673-681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar)). Despite recovering similar amounts of Fer and Fps (lanes 7–9, bottom panel), we detected no signals for autophosphorylation or substrate phosphorylation. Coomassie staining of our substrate preparations indicated that the proteins were relatively pure and ran at their expected molecular masses (Fig. 1B).FcϵRI-induced Phosphorylation of Fer Is Independent of Syk—Because Syk kinase plays a central role in signaling pathways emanating from the FcϵRI (9Siraganian R.P. Zhang J. Suzuki K. Sada K. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 38: 1229-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), we wished to address its potential involvement in Fer kinase activation. Using rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3), a Syk-deficient subline (B2), and B2 cells that were stably transfected with a Syk expression plasmid (B2-Syk+), we sensitized the cells with anti-DNP-IgE and stimulated them with antigen (DNP-HSA) for various times (Fig. 2). Antigen-induced changes in tyrosine phosphorylation were noted in all cell lines (top panel), but the B2 cells were defective in phosphorylation of many proteins, including a prominent 70-kilodalton protein that co-migrated with Syk (data not shown). We tested Fer phosphorylation in each cell line and found that Fer phosphorylation downstream of FcϵRI aggregation does not require Syk (compare lanes 1–3 with 4–6). Although the basal amount of Fer phosphorylation was higher in B2-Syk+ cells, a similar increase in Fer phosphorylation was observed upon antigen treatment (compare lanes 7–9 with lanes 1–3). Similar results were obtained using Fps/Fer antisera; however, we have not been able to convincingly resolve endogenous Fer and Fps proteins in RBL-2H3 cells. These experiments, together with picetannol treatment of BMMCs (data not shown), suggest that Fer activation downstream of FcϵRI is Syk-independent.FIGURE 2FcϵRI-induced phosphorylation of Fer is independent of Syk. RBL-2H3, TB1A2 (B2 (Syk-)), and TB1A2/Syk+ cells were sensitized with anti-DNP-IgE without serum for 18 h, stimulated with DNP-HSA for 0, 1, or 5 min, and lysed in the presence of protease/phosphatase inhibitors. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FerLA antisera. IPs and SCLs were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. SCL were immunoblotted with anti-pY. IPs were immunoblotted sequentially with anti-pY and anti-Fer. Normalized pY indicates the ratio of phosphorylated Fer relative to total Fer, as determined by densitometry.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FcϵRI-induced Phosphorylation of Fer Is Independent of Fyn Kinase and the Gab2 Adaptor—Recently, Fyn kinase and the adaptor protein Gab2 were shown to regulate FcϵRI aggregation-induced degranulation (31Parravicini V. Gadina M. Kovarova M. Odom S. Gonzalez-Espinosa C. Furumoto Y. Saitoh S. Samelson L.E. O'Shea J.J. Rivera J. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 741-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Studies in RBL-2H3 cells and BMMCs have shown potential involvement of Gab2 in FcϵRI aggregation-induced p38 MAPK activation (13Gu H. Saito K. Klaman L.D. Shen J. Fleming T. Wang Y. Pratt J.C. Lin G.

Immunol. 2002; 168: 4682-4691Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because we have observed defects in p38 MAPK activation in Fer-deficient BMMCs (22Craig A. Greer P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6363-6374Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we wanted to address whether Fer may signal in the Fyn/Gab2 pathway. We generated BMMCs from wild type (fyn+/+) and fyn knock-out (fyn–/–) mice, sensitized them with anti-DNP-IgE, and treated them with antigen for various times (Fig. 3A). Analysis of Fer phosphorylation revealed that peak phosphorylation of Fer was similar between genotypes (compare lanes 1–4 with lanes 5–8). A similar experiment using wild type (gab2+/+) and gab2–/– BMMCs, revealed no involvement of Gab2 for FcϵRI aggregation-induced phosphorylation of Fer (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3FcϵRI-induced phosphorylation of Fer is independent of Fyn and Gab2. A, WT and fyn–/– BMMCs were sensitized with anti-DNP-IgE and starved of IL-3 for 18 h, stimulated with DNP-HSA (100 ng/ml) for 0, 2, 10, or 20 min, and lysed in the presence of protease/phosphatase inhibitors. SCLs were subjected to IP with anti-Fer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and IB sequentially with anti-pY and anti-Fer. B, WT and gab2–/– BMMCs were sensitized with anti-DNP-IgE and starved of IL-3 for 18 h, stimulated with DNP-HSA (100 ng/ml) for 0, 2, 10 min, and lysed in the presence of protease/phosphatase inhibitors. SCLs were subjected to IP with anti-Fer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted sequentially with anti-pY and anti-Fer. The ratio of phosphorylated Fer relative to total Fer was determined by densitometry.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Rapid FcϵRI-induced Phosphorylation of Fer Requires Lyn Kinase—To assess whether the upstream kinase acting on Fer is potentially FcϵRI-associated Lyn kinase, we generated BMMCs from wild type (lyn+/+) and lyn–/– mice, sensitized them with anti-DNP-IgE, and treated them with antigen for various times (Fig. 4). SCLs were prepared, and immunoblotting confirmed the absence of both Lyn isoforms (p51/p53) in lyn–/– cells. Characterization of Fer phosphorylation revealed that the rapid phosphorylation of Fer, which was maximal at 1 min in wild type cells, was lost in lyn–/– cells (compare lanes 1–4 with lanes 5–8). This difference was not due to the amounts of Fer recovered, because we have recovered more Fer in lyn–/– samples (bottom panel). The phosphorylation of Fer increased gradually in Lyn-deficient cells and did not reach the levels of phosphorylation that occurred within 1 min in lyn+/+ cells. Comparable results were obtained for two independent cultures of lyn+/+ and lyn–/– BMMCs and suggest that Lyn is required for rapid phosphorylation of Fer but that another kinase, or perhaps Fer itself, can partially compensate for Lyn in mediating Fer activation.FIGURE 4Rapid FcϵRI-induced phosphorylation of Fer requires Lyn kinase.

We show here that phosphorylation likely modulates RPA functions during MMR. Unphosphorylated RPA initially binds to nicked heteroduplex DNA to facilitate assembly of the MMR initiation complex. The unphosphorylated protein preferentially stimulates mismatch-provoked excision, possibly by cooperatively binding to the resultant single-stranded DNA gap. The DNA-bound RPA begins to be phosphorylated after extensive excision, resulting in severalfold reduction in the DNA binding affinity of RPA. Thus, during the phase of repair DNA synthesis, the phosphorylated RPA readily disassociates from DNA, making the DNA template available for DNA polymerase δ-catalyzed resynthesis. These observations support a model of how phosphorylation alters the DNA binding affinity of RPA to fulfill its differential requirement at the various stages of MMR.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3107-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although RPA phosphorylation is not essential for nucleotide excision repair (30Ariza R.R. Keyse S.M. Moggs J.G.

A. 1995; 92: 4636-4640Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), its role and relevance in MMR remains unknown. In this study, we monitored the time-dependent association of several key MMR proteins in HeLa nuclear extracts with a biotin-streptavitin-bound mismatched DNA substrate, and demonstrate here that RPA, MSH2 (a subunit of human MutS heterodimers), MLH1 (a subunit of human MutL heterodimers), PCNA, and DNA polymerase δ bind to the heteroduplex in a sequential manner. Surprisingly, RPA binds to the DNA substrate at a time earlier than the known MMR initiation factors MutSα, MutLα, and PCNA and remains bound throughout the repair reaction. Additionally, we show that the functions of RPA in MMR are regulated by phosphorylation. Unphosphorylated RPA possesses a high DNA binding affinity and preferentially stimulates mismatch-provoked excision; phosphorylated RPA preferentially facilitates DNA resynthesis via reducing its DNA binding ability, allowing its displacement by DNA polymerases to make DNA template available for nucleotide polymerization. Preparations of Nuclear Extracts and Proteins—HeLa S3 cells were purchased from the National Cell Culture Center (Minneapolis, MN), and nuclear extracts were prepared as described (32Parsons R. Li G.M. Longley M.J. Fang W.H. Papadopoulos N. Jen J. de la Chapelle A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Modrich P. Cell. 1993; 75: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Three different forms of human RPA were used in this study, the wild-type RPA and its hyperphosphorylated (RPA2D) and non-phosphorylated (RPA2A) isoforms (33Binz S.K. Lao Y. Lowry D.F. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35584-35591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These RPA isoforms were expressed in E. coli and purified essentially as described (34Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant MutSα, MutLα, PCNA, EXO1, RFC, and pol δ were expressed and purified as described (11Zhang Y. Yuan F. Presnell S.R. Tian K. Gao Y. Tomkinson A.E. Gu L. Li G.M. Cell. 2005; 122: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). DNA-PK was purified from HeLa nuclear extracts essentially as described (35Chan D.W. Mody C.H. Ting N.S. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). DNA Substrate Preparation and MMR Assays—A 6.4-kb circular substrate containing either a G-T mismatch and a strand break 128 bp 5′ to the mismatch or a 171-nt gap was constructed as described (36Guo S. Presnell S.R. Yuan F. Zhang Y. Gu L. Li G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16912-16917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The circular DNA substrates were digested with BspHI to produce linear duplexes with 5′ overhang sequences of 5′-CATG, which served as a template for 3′ biotin labeling (see Fig. 1) in the presence of Klenow DNA polymerase, dCTP, and biotin-dATP as described (37Gabrielsen O.S. Huet J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 508-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). An otherwise identical linear homoduplex was similarly prepared. The biotinylated DNA substrates were incubated with streptavidin-Sepharose at 4 °C for 2 h. The resulting complex was used for MMR assay essentially as described (32Parsons R. Li G.M. Longley M.J.

Briefly, the repair assay was performed in a 45-μl reaction containing 140 fmol of biotin-streptavidin-attached DNA heteroduplex and 250 μg of HeLa nuclear extracts. The repair reactions were incubated at 37 °C for an indicated time, on a rotating rack, and the DNA samples were recovered and digested with BspDI and HindIII to score for repair on agarose gel. To analyze mismatch-provoked excision intermediates, reactions were assembled identically to the MMR reaction but in the absence of dNTPs. After digestion with SspI, DNA excision products were fractionated through a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel. DNA samples were subjected to Southern blot analysis using a 32P-labeled probe (5′-ATTGTTCTGGATATTACC-3′) as described (38McCulloch S.D. Gu L. Li G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50803-50809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Protein Pulldown Assay—To pull down proteins participating in MMR, 250 μg of HeLa nuclear extracts were incubated with 500 or 140 fmol of biotinylated heteroduplex or homoduplex DNA substrates attached to streptavidin at 37 °C for an indicated time under the repair conditions (32Parsons R. Li G.M. Longley M.J. Fang W.H. Papadopoulos N. Jen J. de la Chapelle A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Modrich P. Cell. 1993; 75: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Reactions were terminated by the addition of 800 μl of a low salt washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (0.3 mg/ml benzamidine hydrochloride, 0.5 μg/ml of pepstatin A, 0.5 μg/ml of leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml of antipain)). The beads were recovered by centrifugation and washed once each with a high salt washing buffer (same as the low salt washing buffer but with 500 mm NaCl) and the low salt washing buffer to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. Proteins that remained on the beads were eluted with the SDS gel loading buffer and separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, followed by Western blot analysis. Mismatch-excision and DNA Gap-filling Assays—Excision assays were performed in 20-μl reactions containing 24 fmol of the 5′ G-T heteroduplex (see Fig. 1A, substrate I), 5 fmol of EXO1, 400 fmol of MutSα, 260 fmol of MutLα, 190 fmol of RFC, 290 fmol of homotrimer of PCNA, and 800 fmol of the indicated forms of RPA. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min as described previously (11Zhang Y. Yuan F. Presnell S.R. Tian K. Gao Y. Tomkinson A.E. Gu L. Li G.M. Cell. 2005; 122: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). DNA samples were recovered by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. Excision was scored by NheI digestion. DNA gap-filling assay was performed by incubating purified proteins (pol δ and one of RPA isoforms) with a circular DNA duplex containing a 171-nt gap (see Fig. 1A, substrate III). After incubation for the indicated times, DNA samples were digested with SspI, fractionated through a 6% polyacrylamide gel, and subjected to Southern blot analysis using a 32P-labeled probe (5′-AAAATTTAACGCGAATTTT-3′) as described (38McCulloch S.D. Gu L. Li G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50803-50809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Stopped-flow Assays—The 21-mer (5′-GCTGAAGCAGAAGGCTTGCAA-3′) and its 5′-hexachlorofluorescein-labeled analog were synthesized by Gene Link (Hawthorne, NY) and purified as described (39Bao K.K. Skalka A.M. Wong I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12099-12108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using extinction coefficients calculated according to Cantor et al. (40Cantor C.R. Warshaw M.M. Shapiro H. Biopolymers. 1970; 9: 1059-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Real-time fluorescence changes were measured using a KinTek SF 2001 stopped-flow spectrophotometer (KinTek Instruments, State College, PA) with upgraded Hamamatsu light source/monochromator fitted with a 150-watt xenon arc lamp. Reactions containing the indicated RPA and oligonucleotides were maintained at a constant 37 °C with a Neslab RTE-111 refrigerated bath. Intrinsic protein fluorescence was excited at λex = 290 nm while monitoring total emission at wavelengths >325 nm using an Oriel 51960 filter. Hexachlorofluorescein fluorescence was excited at λex = 535 nm while monitoring total emission at wavelengths >560 nm using a Corion LG-560-F filter. Time courses were fitted by nonlinear least-square regression to a single of exponential function, y = A1 (1 − e−ktt) + C. Dynamic Protein-DNA Association during the MMR Process—A biotinylated linear DNA heteroduplex containing a G-T mismatch and a nicked 128 base pairs 5′ to the mismatch immobilized on streptavidin beads (Fig. 1A, substrate II) was constructed to use in pulldown assays during MMR. In HeLa nuclear extracts, the linear heteroduplex was efficiently repaired (Fig. 2A) with appearance of repair products after 6 min incubation at 37 °C. Mismatch-provoked excision assay under the condition of limited DNA synthesis (38McCulloch S.D. Gu L. Li G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50803-50809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) showed little excision before and at 1 min (Fig. 2B), as almost all DNA molecules remained as nicked substrate (second band from top) and a small amount of directly ligated side product (top band). Onset of bands corresponding to smaller excision products indicated the initiation of mismatch-provoked excision at 2 min. By 4 min, extensive excision was observed. However, as little repair products were detected at 6 min in the presence of dNTPs (Fig. 2A), DNA resynthesis past the mismatch required at least 6 min for the majority of molecules. To correlate the repair progress with the repair proteins assembled on the heteroduplex substrate in real time, the resin-bound substrate was used to pull down proteins involved in MMR (Fig. 2F). To ensure recovery of sufficient proteins for analysis, 500 fmol of the streptavidin-bound heteroduplex (3.5-fold more compared with the repair reaction) was incubated with 250 μg of HeLa nuclear extract under the repair conditions. Proteins pulled down at various times were analyzed by Western blotting to profile proteins bound during the course of the MMR reaction (Fig. 2C). As expected, MMR initiation components, MSH2, MLH1, and PCNA, were detected 0.5 min after incubation at 37 °C, the amounts of these proteins apparently increased, particularly after the mismatch had been removed (at 6 min). However, this increase in the level of MSH2 and MLH1 may not necessarily reflect their requirement for the late steps of the reaction. Instead, it is likely due to their association with unrepaired heteroduplexes, where these proteins could spread along the nick-ligated and ends-blocked molecules after loading to the mismatch. Due to the poor specificity of the commercial antibodies, EXO1 was not directly detectable; however, the appearance of pol δ binding at ∼2 min (Fig. 2C) implied that excision must have occurred at or prior to 2 min, consistent with the excision profile shown in Fig. 2B. When antibodies against the 70-(RPA1) and 34-kDa (RPA2) subunits of RPA were used to monitor the status of RPA during MMR, two surprising phenomena were observed: (i) RPA bound to the DNA substrate earlier than MSH2, MLH1, and PCNA (Fig. 2C), suggesting involvement of RPA in the initiation step of MMR; (ii) the RPA2 antibody detected two species (a fast-migrating and a slow-migrating) of RPA2, with the fast migrating species appearing at the earlier steps of the reaction and the slow migrating one covering the later steps of the reaction (Fig. 2C). The two RPA2 species are reminiscent of phosphorylated (slow-migrating) and unphosphorylated (fast-migrating) RPA2 observed during cellular response to DNA damage in published reports (41Carty M.P. Zernik-Kobak M. McGrath S. Dixon K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2114-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 42Liu V.F. Weaver D.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7222-7231Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This was confirmed in experiments supplemented with 4 μm wortmannin, a potent inhibitor of PI 3-kinases, where the fast migrating species was no longer detectable (data not shown), suggesting strongly that the slow migrating RPA2 was likely formed from the fast migrating species via phosphorylation by PI 3-kinases (43Brush G.S. Anderson C.W. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12520-12524Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 44Brush G.S. Morrow D.M. Hieter P. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15075-15080Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 45Dutta A. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Comparison with the excision profile (Fig. 2B) revealed that unphosphorylated RPA, appearing from 0 to 6 min (Fig. 2C), was associated with excision initiation and complete removal of the mismatch (from 0 to 6 min, see Fig. 2B), whereas phosphorylated RPA appeared just before the binding of pol δ to the DNA substrate and accumulated throughout the resynthesis phase of the reaction (Fig. 2C). These results, therefore, suggest that unphosphorylated RPA is required for the excision step, whereas phosphorylated RPA is necessary for the resynthesis step of MMR. In control experiments performed with an otherwise identical, nicked DNA substrate without the mismatch, little MSH2 and MLH1 binding to the homoduplex substrate was detected initially as expected (MLH1 was detected only at a much later reaction time, Fig. 2D). The binding profile of other protein components to the nicked homoduplex also appeared similar. However, RPA2 phosphorylation in the homoduplex reaction appeared much faster as complete phosphorylation was observed at 4 min as compared with the 10 min required for the heteroduplex reaction (Fig. 2, C and D). These results are repeatable and likely reflect the known differences in the length of the ssDNA gap generated in these two reactions (see “Discussion” for details). Significantly, in either case, RPA2 phosphorylation consistently coincided with or slightly preceded pol δ binding, suggesting again that RPA2 phosphorylation may play a critical role in triggering DNA synthesis, even in the homoduplex reaction where a significant amount of DNA synthesis unrelated to MMR has been reported previously (46Holmes Jr., J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 47Thomas D.C. Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3744-3751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, although RPA (RPA2) was readily pulled down by both the nicked hetero- and homo-duplexes, identical constructs lacking the nick were poor substrates for RPA binding (Fig. 2E). The requirement for a nick in the substrate implies that RPA likely binds to the DNA substrate at or via the strand break. Unphosphorylated RPA Promotes the Excision Reaction, but Phosphorylated RPA Facilitates the Resynthesis in MMR—The human MMR system has recently been reconstituted using purified proteins, and it can be subdivided into the excision and resynthesis reactions (11Zhang Y. Yuan F. Presnell S.R. Tian K. Gao Y. Tomkinson A.E. Gu L. Li G.M. Cell. 2005; 122: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). To determine the role of RPA phosphorylation in MMR, two RPA isoforms that functionally mimic phosphorylated and unphosphorylated RPA (48Vassin V.M. Wold M.S. Borowiec J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1930-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) were used in the reconstituted excision and resynthesis reactions. These RPA isoforms were obtained by substituting the phosphorylation sites of wild-type RPA2 with aspartate (RPA2D) and alanine (RPA2A), respectively (33Binz S.K. Lao Y. Lowry D.F. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35584-35591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and the individual RPA trimers containing RPA2D and RPA2A were referred to as RPA2D or RPA2A here, respectively. The mobility of RPA2A and RPA2D in SDS-PAGE correlated well with that of unphosphorylated and hyperphosphorylated RPA2, respectively (Fig. 1B). Fig. 3A shows the excision assay in the reconstituted system in the presence of these different RPA isoforms. Relative to the reaction with the phosphorylated isoform, RPA2D, 2.2- and 1.7-fold higher excision activities were observed in reactions using unphosphorylated wild-type RPA (RPAWT) and the unphosphorylated isoform, RPA2A. These results suggest a preferential role for the unphosphorylated form of RPA in stimulating the mismatch-provoked excision phase of the reaction. To explore the role of RPA phosphorylation in the resynthesis step of MMR, gap-filling activity was assayed in a defined system containing purified pol δ and either phosphorylated or unphosphorylated RPA using a circular DNA substrate with a 171-nt single-stranded gap (Fig. 1A, III) to mimic the MMR excision product. Resynthesis products were detected by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 3B) and the percentage of resynthesis products are plotted as a function of time in Fig. 3C. As previously observed, pol δ by itself can efficiently fill the 171-nt gap (11Zhang Y. Yuan F. Presnell S.R. Tian K. Gao Y. Tomkinson A.E. Gu L. Li G.M. Cell. 2005; 122: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The addition of RPAWT to the reaction resulted in a severe, greater than 4-fold reduction in the rate of gap-filling (Fig. 3C). Gap filling activity was also similarly inhibited in reactions supplemented with RPA2A. However, a greater than 2-fold recovery of gap filling activity was observed when RPA2D was substituted for RPAWT or RPA2A, which partially mitigated but did not completely abolish the overall inhibitory effect of adding RPA (Fig. 3, B and C). These results suggest a preferential role for phosphorylated RPA during DNA resynthesis. To demonstrate that the faster gap filling observed with RPA2D was due to RPA phosphorylation, gap filling assay was conducted using RPAWT in the presence or absence of purified DNA-PK, which has been shown to be capable of phosphorylating RPA in vitro (17Binz S.K. Sheehan A.M. Wold M.S. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 26Niu H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Pan Z.Q. Lee S.H. Tempst P. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12634-12641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous observations, we found that DNA-PK purified from HeLa cells (see Fig. 1B) could efficiently phosphorylate recombinant RPA (data not shown), although we do not know whether or not RPA was hyperphosphorylated in this manner. As shown in Fig. 3D, addition of DNA-PK to the reaction containing pol δ and RPAWT stimulated the gap filling activity by more than 1.7-fold, and the stimulation by DNA-PK was abolished in the presence of wortmannin, a potent inhibitor of"

Pulse-chase experiments and Escherichia coli two-hybrid assays demonstrate that OrfAB binds to and stabilizes OrfAB′, thus increasing the transposition activity of IS629. This is the first transposable element in the IS3 family shown to have two functional frameshifted products involved in transposition and to use a transframe product to regulate transposition. IS629 is 1,310 bp in length with a pair of 25-bp imperfect inverted repeats at its termini. Two partially overlapping open reading frames, orfA and orfB, are present in IS629, and two putative translational frameshift signals, TTTTG (T4G) and AAAAT (A4T), are located near the 3′-end of orfA. With the lacZ gene as the reporter, both T4G and A4T motifs are determined to be a −1 frameshift signal. Two peptides representing the two transframe products designated OrfAB′ and OrfAB, are identified by a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric approach. Results of transposition assays show that OrfAB′ is the transposase and that OrfAB aids in the transposition of IS629. Pulse-chase experiments and Escherichia coli two-hybrid assays demonstrate that OrfAB binds to and stabilizes OrfAB′, thus increasing the transposition activity of IS629. This is the first transposable element in the IS3 family shown to have two functional frameshifted products involved in transposition and to use a transframe product to regulate transposition. The insertion sequence IS629 is a member of the IS3 family of transposable elements. It was initially isolated from the chromosome of Shigella sonnei (1Matsutani S. Ohtsubo H. Maeda Y. Ohtsubo E. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 445-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and has been detected in many other enteric bacteria, including S. dysenteriae, S. flexneri, S. boydii, Escherichia coli C, E. coli O157:H7, Enterobacter cloacae MD36, and Serratia marcescens (2Matsutani S. Ohtsubo E. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 127: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). IS629 is 1,310 bp in length and has a pair of 25-bp imperfect inverted repeats at its termini (3Matsutani S. Ohtsubo E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Similar to the genetic organization of other members of the IS3 family, two consecutive and partially overlapping open reading frames, designated orfA and orfB, are present in IS629 (see Fig. 1). The coding potential of orfA (nucleotides 55–381) is 108 amino acids, and that of orfB (nucleotides 378–1,268) is 296 amino acids (3Matsutani S. Ohtsubo E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The stop codon (379TGA) of orfA overlaps the initiation codon (378ATG) of orfB (see Fig. 1). A putative promoter and the Shine-Dalgarno sequence are found upstream from the initiation codon of orfA, but no such sequences are present in the upstream region of orfB (3Matsutani S. Ohtsubo E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).Two putative −1 translational frameshift signals, TTTTG (T4G) and AAAAT (A4T), are located near the 3′-end of the orfA at nucleotide positions 342–346 and 375–379, respectively (Fig. 1) (4Chandler M. Fayet O. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of two frameshifted products. In this study, we demonstrated that both of these two putative frameshift signals are functional, causing a −1 translational frameshift and resulting in the production of two transframe products designated OrfAB′ and OrfAB. OrfAB′ was shown to be the transposase of IS629, and OrfAB was demonstrated to bind and stabilize OrfAB′.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning of IS629—A fragment containing both orfA and orfB sequences of IS629 was amplified by PCR from the chromosome of S. sonnei (ATCC 9290) or E. coli O157 with primers FNdeI-55 and REcl136II-Term (Table 1). The PCR product thus generated was cloned into pGEMT-Easy (Promega) to produce pGEMT629. Subsequently, the 1.2-kb NdeI-Ecl136II fragment containing orfA and orfB without terminal repeats was isolated from pGEMT629 and then inserted into the corresponding sites of pET-29a(+) (Novagen), generating pET629. DNA fragments containing different portions of IS629 for various experiments were generated from pGEMT629 or pET629 by PCR using oligonucleotide primers listed in Table 1.

The 3.2-kb SmaI-PstI fragment containing the lacZ gene from pMC1871 (5Shapira S.K. Chou J. Richaud F.V. Casadaban M.J. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) was cloned into the corresponding sites of pUCD1752X (6Li C.-C. Characterization of the Putative Frameshift Signal T6Gof IS1372. National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan1999Google Scholar) to generate pUCDlacZ. To investigate the function of the two putative frameshift motifs, a DNA fragment (IS629 nucleotides 55–425) containing the two motifs was amplified from pGEMT629 using primers FXbaI-55 and RRsrII-425 and cloned between XbaI and SmaI sites of pUC18, generating pUC629-21. The 450-bp XbaI-Acc65I fragment from pUC629-21 was then inserted into the corresponding sites of pUCDlacZ to generate pF1wF2wIw, thus making the expression of the lacZ gene dependent on −1 frameshifting. For this and subsequent plasmid designations, F1, F2, and I represent frameshift signal 1 (T4G), frameshift signal 2 (A4T), and initiation codon for orf B, respectively, whereas “w” denotes wild-type sequence, and “m” means mutated sequence. Because this 450-bp XbaI-Acc65I fragment contained the initiation codon of orf B, which may render the lacZ gene constitutively expressed, this initiation codon was mutated, generating pF1wF2wIm. To investigate the function of the first frameshift motif T4G (F1), the sequence AAAAT (F2) was mutated to TCGAT to create pF1wF2mIm. Similarly, the sequence TTTTG (F1) was changed to TACTG to investigate the function of the second frameshift motif, generating pF1mF2wIm. The plasmid that contained mutations of both motifs and the orfB initiation codon was called pF1mF2mIm, whereas the one containing the two mutated motifs with the wild-type orfB initiation codon was referred to as pF1mF2mIw. Mutations were created by PCR on the 450-bp XbaI-Acc65I fragment using primers listed in Table 1, and the new 450-bp XbaI-Acc65I fragment with a certain mutation was used to replace the XbaI-Acc65I fragment on pF1wF2wIw to generate various plasmids (Table 2 and Fig. 2).FIGURE 2The function of the putative frameshift motifs. DNA fragments (IS629 nucleotides 55–425) containing the wild-type or mutated frameshift motifs were fused with the lacZ gene. The nucleotide sequence of the frameshift window (fsw) and the deduced amino acids encoded by 0 and −1 reading frames in the window are shown. The stop codon of orfA is indicated by asterisks. The wild-type (T4G and A4T) or mutated frameshift motifs are underlined. The two ATG initiation codons for orf B and the mutated sequences are boxed. The β-galactosidase levels in Miller units derived from each construct are shown. The value derived from pF1mF2mLacZ on which the lacZ gene is fused in-frame to the fsw sequence is set as 100%, and the relative values of those derived from other constructs are shown in parenthesis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Purification and Detection of Transframe Products—To detect and identify the frameshifted products of IS629, the gene encoding a portion (amino acids 147–402) of the E. coli maltose-binding protein (MBP) with a His6 tag at the 3′-end was fused to a DNA fragment containing either one of the two frameshift motifs so that MBP-His6 is produced only when a −1 frameshift occurs. IS629 fragment (nucleotides 334–375) containing the T4G motif was amplified from pET629 with primers FBamHI-334 and RAscI-375 and then inserted between BamHI and Ecl136II sites of pET-29a(+) to yield pET629T4G. The 767-bp BssHII-HindIII fragment containing the malE gene encoding MBP from pMAL-C2 (New England Biolabs) was then inserted between AscI and HindIII sites on pET629T4G to obtain pET629T4GMBP, thus fusing MBP to the T4G motif. The hybrid gene was driven by the T7 promoter and regulated by the lac operator. To fuse the A4T motif with MBP-His6, IS629 fragment (nucleotides 367–458) containing the A4T motif was amplified from pGEMT629 with primers FBamHI-367 and RAscI-458. The resulting PCR product was digested with BamHI and AscI, and plasmid pET629A4TMBP was generated by substituting the BamHI-AscI fragment on pET629T4GMBP with the digested PCR product.The plasmid pET629T4GMBP or pET629A4TMBP was then introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3). Overnight cultures of cells containing the plasmid were diluted 1:100 in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and grown to an A600 of 0.8. Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to the culture to a final concentration of 1 mm to induce protein expression. After 2.5 h of induction, the cells were harvested and lysed with the B-PER bacterial protein extraction reagent (Pierce) and lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 8 m urea, and 500 mm NaCl, pH 8.0). The whole cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation, and the His-tagged recombinant protein was purified by affinity column chromatography with the ProBond resin (Invitrogen). The proteins bound to the resin were washed with 50 ml of lysis buffer and then with 50 ml of wash buffer (500 mm NaCl and 20 mm NaPO4 buffer, pH 6.0). Finally, the bound proteins were eluted with elution buffer (150 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm NaPO4 buffer, pH 6.0). The eluted proteins were concentrated and washed extensively with wash buffer using an Amicon Ultra PL-30 filter (Millipore). The purified proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for visualization by Coomassie Blue staining or Western blotting. For Western blotting, the proteins on the gel were electrotransferred onto Immobilon-P transfer membranes (Millipore). The membranes were then probed with a 1:1,000 dilution of the anti-MBP antibody (7Tsay Y.G. Chen C.C. Hu S.T. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 339: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and a 1:1,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies (Sigma). The signals on the blots were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Mass Spectrometry—The gel piece containing the transframe protein was subjected to reduction, pyridylethylation, and ingel digestion with trypsin or Asp-N as described by Tsay et al. (7Tsay Y.G. Chen C.C. Hu S.T. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 339: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The digested products were separated by an Agilent 1100D high-performance liquid chromatography system, which was interfaced with the ThermoFinnigan LCQ Deca XP ion trap tandem mass spectrometer. A 150-× 0.3-mm Agilent 300SB C18 column (3-μm particle diameter, 300-Å pore size) with mobile phases of 0.1% formic acid in water and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile was used to separate peptides.The occurrence of frameshifting was confirmed by detecting peptides that were produced by a −1 frameshift by matching the mass spectra of the peptides against two data-bases created based on the frameshift model of Jacks et al. (8Jacks T. Madhani H.D. Masiarz F.R. Varmus H.E. Cell. 1988; 55: 447-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). These two databases contained computer-generated nucleotide sequences of different peptides that may be produced by trypsin or Asp-N digestion of fsw(T4G)-MBP-His6 and fsw(A4T)-MBP-His6, respectively, translated in both the 0 and −1 frames. Because the region located between the most downstream peptide sequence derived from the 0 translation frame and the most upstream peptide sequence derived from the −1 translation frame is where frameshifting may occur, this region is referred to as the “frameshift region.” Two additional new databases were then created. The first one contained the nucleotide sequences of different peptides derived from a −1 frameshift that occurs at each codon within the first frameshift region (fsw(T4G)-MBP-His6), and the second one contained those derived from the second frameshift region (fsw(A4T)-MBP-His6). Each nucleotide sequence corresponded to a resultant peptide from one −1 frameshifting event within a frameshift region.The collision-induced dissociation spectra of a peptide were acquired as three successive scans as described by Tsay et al. (9Tsay Y.G. Wang Y.H. Chiu C.M. Shen B.J. Lee S.C. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The acquired collision-induced dissociation spectra were interpreted using a ThermoFinnigan software package, the Turbo-SEQUEST browser, which matches the tandem mass spectrum with those in the databases described above. The MS/MS data that matched the peptide sequences with appropriate cleavage sites at the right positions were subjected to manual analysis using another computer program (EverNew Biotech) to confirm the results.Transposition Assays—To investigate effects of IS629-encoded proteins on IS629 transposition in vivo, a mini-IS629 with the kanamycin resistance gene was first constructed, and proteins that may affect IS629 transposition were supplied in trans. The left terminal repeat (IRL) sequence of IS629 was amplified from the chromosome of S. sonnei ATCC 9290 with primers FIRL-BamHI and RAscI-375, and the PCR product was ligated into pGEMT-Easy (Promega) to generate pGEMT-IRL. The right terminal repeat (IRR) was amplified with primers F316-Bst1107I and RIRR-BamHI and similarly cloned into pGEMT-Easy to generate pGEMT-IRR. The 1.9-kb ScaI-BamHI fragment containing the IRL from pGEMT-IRL and the 1.2-kb ScaI-BamHI fragment containing the IRR from pGEMT-IRR were joined together to obtain pGEMT-mini629. The 1.3-kb BamHI fragment containing the kanamycin resistance gene from pUC4K (Amersham Biosciences) was then inserted into the BamHI site of pGEMT-mini629 to generate pGEMT-mini629Km. Finally, pMini629 was constructed by inserting the 1.3-kb NotI fragment containing the mini-IS629 with the kanamycin resistance gene from pGEMT-mini629Km into pET-22b(+) (Novagen).The 1.2-kb NdeI-Ecl136II fragment containing the orfA and orfB sequences of IS629 from pGEMT629 was then inserted into the corresponding sites of pMini629 to generate pMini629AB′-AB-A-B, which would express OrfAB′, OrfAB, OrfA, and OrfB. The 370-bp NdeI-RsrII DNA on pMini629AB′-AB-A-B was then replaced with the 370-bp PCR-generated NdeI-RsrII DNA fragment encoding OrfAB′, OrfAB, and OrfA to produce pMini629AB′-AB-A. Similarly, pMini629AB′-A that would express OrfAB′ and OrfA was constructed by replacing the same NdeI-RsrII DNA on pMini629AB′-AB-A-B with the 370-bp PCR-generated NdeI-RsrII DNA fragments encoding OrfAB′ and OrfA (Table 2).The transposition activity of IS629 was determined by the standard mating-out assay as described previously (10Hu S.T. Lee C.H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 214: 490-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Derivatives of pMini629 (Kmr) carrying various IS629 genes were transformed into E. coli DH1(DE3) cells (Strs) harboring an F-derived conjugative plasmid pCJ105 (Cmr), which served as the target for IS629 transposition. Because pCJ105 carries a chloramphenicol resistance gene, transposition of mini629Km onto pCJ105 will render the host resistant to both kanamycin and chloramphenicol. To determine the transposition frequency of IS629, pCJ105::mini629Km was mated out from E. coli DH1(DE3) to E. coli HB101(Strr) at 37 °C for 90 min. Appropriate dilutions of the conjugation mix were plated on LB agar plates containing both chloramphenicol (50 μg/ml) and streptomycin (150 μg/ml) as well as on plates containing kanamycin (50 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (50 μg/ml), and streptomycin (150 μg/ml). Colonies that appeared on these plates were counted, and the transposition frequency was determined as the ratio of the number of Cmr Kmr Strr colonies to that of the Cmr Strr colonies. To confirm transposition, some of the transposition products (pCJ105:: mini629Km) were isolated and examined for direct repeat sequences flanking the mini-IS629. The direct repeat sequence adjacent to IRR was identified by nucleotide sequencing using primer FP-1 (Table 1), which anneals to the 3′-end of the kanamycin resistance gene 140 bp upstream from IRR. To detect the direct repeat sequence adjacent to IRL, primer PRP-1 (Table 1), which anneals to the 5′-end of the kanamycin resistance gene 164 bp downstream from IRL, was used for sequencing.Pulse-Chase Experiments—Pulse-chase experiments were performed to investigate the half-life of OrfAB′ and OrfAB. To express OrfAB′, the 1.2-kb NdeI-Ecl136II fragment from pMini629AB′-A was cloned into the corresponding sites on pET-29a (+) (Novagen) to generate pET629A-AB′. Similarly, the NdeI-Ecl136II fragments from pMini629AB-A and pMini629AB′-AB-A were inserted between NdeI and Ecl136II sites on pET-29a (+) to generate pET629A-AB and pET629A-AB′-AB that express OrfAB and OrfAB′+OrfAB, respectively.Overnight cultures of E. coli DH1(DE3) cells containing pET629A-AB′, pET629A-AB, or pET629A-AB′-AB were diluted 1:50 with fresh M9 minimal medium containing kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and grown to an A600 of 0.3. The cells in the culture were pelleted, washed with M9 buffer (11Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and suspended in M9 minimal medium containing 2% methionine assay medium (Difco Laboratories). After 100-min incubation at 37 °C, IPTG was added to the culture to a final concentration of 1 mm to induce the synthesis of the T7 RNA polymerase. Forty minutes later, rifampin (200 μg/ml) was added, and the culture was incubated for another 40 min. The cells were then labeled with [35S]methionine (20 μCi/ml, Amersham Biosciences) for 10 min and subsequently chased with an excess amount of non-radioactive methionine (final concentration, 2.5 mg/ml). Samples were taken at different time points, pelleted, and suspended in electrophoresis sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue). The samples were boiled for 5 min and electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gels were scanned with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences), and quantification of the protein was performed with the program ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences).Bacterial Two-hybrid Assay—To assess the interaction between OrfAB′ and OrfAB, an E. coli two-hybrid experiment was performed. In this system (BacterioMatch Two-Hybrid System, Stratagene), the bait plasmid pBT (Cmr) encodes the bacterial phage λcI protein under the control of the lac-UV5 promoter. This λcI protein contains the N-terminal DNA-binding domain and the C-terminal dimerization domain. The protein of interest, the bait, is fused to the λcI protein. The target plasmid pTRG (Tcr) contains an RNAPα gene, which is driven by the E. coli lipoprotein promoter (lpp) and regulated by the lac operator. The target protein is fused to the N-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase α subunit.DNA fragments encoding OrfAB′ or OrfAB were cloned into these plasmids to fuse OrfAB′ or OrfAB to λcI or RNAPα to generate λcI-OrfAB′, λcI-OrfAB, RNAPα-OrfAB′, and RNAPα-OrfAB. When interaction between λcI-OrfAB′ and RNAPα-OrfAB′, λcI-OrfAB and RNAPα-OrfAB, λcIOrfAB′ and RNAPα-OrfAB, or λcI-OrfAB and RNAPα-OrfAB′ had occurred, these complexes would bind to theλ operator (OR2) located upstream from the reporter cassette containing the lacZ genes in E. coli XL-1 Blue MRF′ (Kmr). This binding would recruit and stabilize the binding of RNA polymerase at the promoter and activate the transcription of the reporter gene. Thus, the protein-protein interaction between OrfAB and OrfAB′ or between themselves could be determined by the levels of β-galactosidase activity.The bait and target plasmids were constructed as follows. The IS629 fragment containing an insertion of a thymine residue within the T4G motif was amplified from pET629A-AB′ with primers FT5 and REcl136II-Term. The PCR product was digested with EcoRV and HindIII and then cloned into the corresponding sites of pGEMT629, resulting in pGEMT629T5. A 1.2-kb NotI-EcoRI fragment containing IS629(T5) without the terminal repeats was then amplified from pGEMT629T5 with primers FNotI-55 and RT7 and then cloned into the corresponding sites of pBT and pTRG to yield pBT-AB′ and pTRG-AB′. For construction of pBT-AB and pTRG-AB, the IS629 fragment (nucleotides 55–425) with an adenine insertion within the A4T motif was amplified from pET629A-AB with primers FNotI-55 and RA5. This PCR product was ligated into pGEMT-Easy vector (Promega) to generate pGEMT629A5NR. The RsrII-SphI fragment containing the IS629 nucleotides 420–1,269 from pGEMT629 was then inserted into the corresponding sites of pGEMT629A5NR to obtain pGEMT629A5. The NotI-EcoRI fragment of pGEMT629A5 was inserted between NotI and EcoRI sites on pBT and pTRG to generate pBT-AB and pTRG-AB, respectively.E. coli XL-1 Blue MRF′ was co-transformed with various combinations of recombinant bait and target plasmids to examine interaction between OrfAB′ and OrfAB or with non-recombinant pBT and pTRG vectors to serve as negative controls for the interaction analysis. Transformants were selected on LB agar plates containing 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline, 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 50 μg/ml kanamycin. In the presence of 20 μm IPTG, cells were cultured at 30 °C to mid-log phase, and then assayed for β-galactosidase activity by the method of Miller (12Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) using o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as the substrate.RESULTSTwo Functional −1 Frameshift Signals—To determine whether the T4G or the A4T motif was able to provoke a −1 frameshift, a lacZ reporter gene was fused to the 3′-end of a DNA fragment (nucleotides 55–425) containing the entire orfA, the first 48 bp of orfB, and the wild-type or mutated putative frameshift motifs. The lac promoter and E. coli RNA polymerase were used to express the hybrid gene on these constructs (Table 2). Translation of mRNA derived from each of these plasmids would start at frame 0 of orfA, and the β-galactosidase would be expressed only when a −1 frameshift had occurred, because lacZ was fused to the −1 reading frame of orfA. The β-galactosidase activity in cells harboring a certain construct after IPTG induction was measured (Fig. 2). As the positive control for β-galactosidase production, the lacZ gene on pF1mF2mLacZ was fused in-frame to orfA. The β-galactosidase activity conferred by this plasmid was determined to be 3,896 ± 243 units (Fig. 2) and designated as 100%. pF1wF2wIw, which contained the wild type of both T4G and A4T sequences fused to the lacZ gene, conferred 665 ± 50 units (17.1% of control) of β-galactosidase activity, suggesting that a −1 frameshift had occurred. To determine whether both T4G and A4T motifs were essential for frameshifting, they were mutated to TACTG and TCGAT, respectively. Surprisingly, pF1mF2mIw, which harbors these mutations, still conferred 504 units (12.9% of control) of β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 2). A careful analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed the presence of two tandem translation initiation codons (78ATGATG83) located at the beginning of orf B. To determine whether the lacZ activity conferred by pF1mF2mIw was due to translation initiated from one of these two codons, the sequence ATGATG on pF1mF2mIw was changed to ATAATC to generate pF1mF2mIm. As expected, pF1mF2mIm with both the two putative frameshift signals and both the two ATG codons mutated conferred very little β-galactosidase activity (1.69 ± 0.15 units, 0.04% of control). This result indicates that the majority of β-galactosidase activity conferred by pF1wF2wIw was derived from translation initiated from the initiation codons of orf B.To assess the frameshifting function of T4G, the TACTG sequence on pF1mF2mIm was changed back to TTTTG, generating pF1wF2mIm. pF1wF2mIm was found to confer 148 ± 14 units of β-galactosidase (3.8% of control), indicating that the T4G sequence is a functional −1 frameshift signal. Similarly, the TCGAT sequence on pF1mF2mIm was changed back to AAAAT, generating pF1mF2wIm to examine the frameshifting ability of A4T, and pF1mF2wIm was found to confer 173 ± 11 units of β-galactosidase (4.4% of control). This result indicates that A4T is also a functional frameshift signal. When both of the mutated frameshift motifs were changed back to wild type, the plasmid pF1wF2wIm, which carries these changes, conferred 174 ± 14 units of β-galactosidase (4.5% of control). Because pF1wF2wIm had a mutated initiation codon for orfB, this result indicates that the β-galactosidase activity derived from frameshifting was ∼4.5%.Identification of Frameshift Sites—To confirm that frameshifting indeed occurred, the transframe products were identified. A DNA fragment containing nucleotides 334–375 of IS629 with a portion of orfA and the T4G motif was fused out-of-frame to the sequence encoding His6-tagged maltose binding protein (MBP-His6), generating pET629T4GMBP (Fig. 3A). On this plasmid, the MBP-His6 would be translated only when a −1 frameshift had occurred. The fused gene was driven by the T7 promoter under the control of the lac operator. After IPTG induction, proteins were purified with nickel affinity column chromatography, electrophoresed on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 3B, left panel), and immunoblotted with anti-MBP antibodies (Fig. 3B, right panel). The 32-kDa band of the expected frameshifted product and two additional bands were seen. These two additional bands could be degradation products of fusion protein. The 32-kDa band was isolated from the gel and then subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis. A peptide with the sequence GSoMADIGSAYFCEGGVRPPLEIHR was identified (Fig. 3C). This sequence was the resultant product from a −1 frameshift that took place at the T4G motif.FIGURE 3Verification of the T4G motif as a −1 frameshift site.
