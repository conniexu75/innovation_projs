We set out to ascertain the mechanism by which VEGF regulates paracellular permeability in rats. Intra-ocular injection of VEGF caused a post-translational modification of occludin as determined by a gel shift from 60 to 62 kDa. This event began by 15 min post-injection and was maximal by 45 min. Alkaline phosphatase treatment revealed this modification was caused by a change in occludin phosphorylation. In addition, the quantity of extracted occludin increased 2-fold in the same time frame. The phosphorylation and increased extraction of occludin was recapitulated in retinal endothelial cells in culture after VEGF stimulation. The data presented herein are the first demonstration of a change in the phosphorylation of this transmembrane protein under conditions of increased endothelial permeability. In addition, intra-ocular injection of VEGF also caused tyrosine phosphorylation of ZO-1 as early as 15 min and increased phosphorylation 4-fold after 90 min. In conclusion, VEGF rapidly increases occludin phosphorylation as well as the tyrosine phosphorylation of ZO-1. Phosphorylation of occludin and ZO-1 likely contribute to regulated endothelial paracellular permeability.

These barriers contribute to the maintenance of specific neural tissue environments by regulating ion concentrations, water permeability, and delivery of amino acids and sugars and by preventing exposure to circulating antibodies and immune cells. These requirements imply the need for regulation of the blood-brain/retinal barrier, which permits selective delivery of needed substrates in response to varying local tissue demands and systemic metabolic influences. Endothelial cells regulate the blood-brain/retinal barrier through a number of mechanisms including transporter activity, e.g. glucose transport via GLUT-1 and transcytosis. In this report we provide evidence for regulation of paracellular permeability by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)1 through the rapid phosphorylation of tight junction proteins. The endothelial cells of the blood-brain and blood-retinal barriers contain tight junctions that confer highly selective barrier properties to these vessels. Tight junctions contain at least seven proteins including occludin, zonula occludens 1, 2, and 3 (Z0–1, -2, or -3), cingulin, the 7H6 antigen, and symplekin (reviewed in Refs. 1Mitic L.L.

Recent studies of an occludin knockout mouse line revealed that claudins may also influence permeability (6Furuse M. Fujita K. Hiiragi T. Fujimoto K. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1539-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar), whereas other laboratories have identified novel isoforms of occludin by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (7Muresan Z. Paul K.L. Goodenough D.A. Proceedings of the American Society for Cell Biology 38th Annual Meeting. 9. American Society for Cell Biology, San Francisco1998: 83aGoogle Scholar). Signaling molecules including Rab proteins, large G-proteins, and soluble tyrosine kinases have also been identified at tight junctions (reviewed in Refs. 1Mitic L.L. Anderson J.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 121-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar and2Anderson J.M. Van Itallie C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G467-G476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that occludin plays a crucial role in the function of tight junctions and control of vascular permeability. Hydrophobicity plots from several species predict that occludin spans the plasma membrane at four regions presenting two extracellular loops (8Ando-Akatsuka Y. Saitou M. Hirase T. Kishi M. Sakakibara A. Itoh M. Yonemura S. Furuse M. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Also, occludin tissue expression and content correlate well with barrier properties (9Hirase T. Staddon J.M. Saitou M. Ando-Akatsuka Y. Itoh M. Furuse M. Fujimoto K. Tsukita S. Rubin L.L. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and overexpression of occludin increases transendothelial electrical resistance in MDCK cells (10McCarthy K.M. Skare I. Stankewich M.C. Furuse M. Tsukita S. Rogers R.A. Lynch R.D. Schneeberger E. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2287-2298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and confers adhesiveness in fibroblasts (11Van Itallie C.M. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1113-1121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, microinjection of occludin increases Xenopus oocyte barrier properties (12Chen Y. Merzdorf C. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 891-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The molecular structure of ZO-1 indicates a functional capacity for multiple protein/protein interactions. It is a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase family of proteins (MAGuK proteins) and as such contains a region of homology to guanylate kinase. However, this region of homology lacks certain amino acids necessary for guanylate kinase activity, and no such activity has been demonstrated for ZO-1. Consistent with MAGuK family members, ZO-1 contains an SH3 domain, three PDZ domains, and a 90-amino acid domain unique to MAGuK family members (1Mitic L.L. Anderson J.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 121-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 13Anderson J.M. Fanning A.S. Lapierre L. Van Itallie C.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 470-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). ZO-1 also contains a leucine zipper region, a proline-rich region, and four PEST sequences that are associated with proteins that undergo rapid turnover. In vitro binding studies have revealed that ZO-1 can interact directly with occludin (14Furuse M. Itoh M. Hirase T. Nagafuchi S. Yonemura S. Tsukita S.A. Tsukita S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar) as well as with ZO-2 and ZO-3 (15Wittchen W.S. Stevenson B.R. Proceedings of the American Society for Cell Biology 38th Annual Meeting. 9. American Society for Cell Biology, San Francisco1998: 82aGoogle Scholar), and mutational analysis by Fanning et al. (16Fanning A.S. Jameson B.J. Jesaitis L.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29745-29753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar) has identified the sites of occludin interaction. Because of its multiple protein/protein interaction domains, current models place ZO-1 at the center of tight junction assembly and organization. In a previous report we found that chronic incubation of bovine retinal endothelial cells (BREC) with VEGF decreased occludin content after 3–6 h, coinciding with changes in barrier permeability properties (17Antonetti D. Barber A. Khin S. Lieth E. Tarbell J. Gardner T. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1953-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Here we present the first evidence of occludin phosphorylation associated with a regulated increase in barrier permeability. VEGF causes a rapid phosphorylation of occludin both in BREC cultures and when injected into the vitreous cavity of rat eyes. VEGF also induces ZO-1 tyrosine phosphorylation when injected into the vitreous cavity. These rapid changes in the tight junction protein phosphorylation state may serve as a mechanism by which VEGF regulates endothelial barrier permeability. These observations are significant for understanding the physiologic regulation of vascular permeability as well as discerning the underlying mechanism of abnormal permeability associated with diabetic retinopathy and VEGF-producing tumors. The following antibodies were used: polyclonal, rabbit anti-ZO-1, and anti-occludin antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.); anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Cell culture reagents and chemicals were obtained through Sigma except minimum Eagle's medium vitamins were from Mediatech, endothelial cell growth supplement from Collaborative Biochemical, antibiotic/antimycotic from Life Technologies, Inc., and cell culture plastic ware from Falcon. For gel electrophoresis and transfer, the following reagents were used: polyacrylamide from Amresco, CAPS buffer from Research Organics, and nitrocellulose with 0.22-μm pore size (Micron Separations Inc.). Recombinant human VEGF 165 was obtained from R & D Systems Inc., and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase was from New England Biolabs. Protease inhibitor tablet CømpleteTM (EDTA-free) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, MA) weighing approximately 175–200 g were maintained on a 12-h alternating light/dark cycle and received food and water ad libitum . All experiments were conducted in accordance with the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology “Statement for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.” Rats were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (50/0.5 mg/kg intramuscularly). VEGF, or vehicle alone, was injected into the vitreous cavity of the rat eye in 10 μl of saline, yielding a final concentration of ∼25 ng/ml. The rats were sacrificed by decapitation, eyes were enucleated, and the retinas were removed under a dissecting microscope on ice and were then frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. Primary BREC culture was carried out as described previously (18Gardner T.W. Lesher T. Khin S. Vu C. Barber A.J. Brennan W.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 717-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The day before the experiment, the cells were stepped down from 20 to 10% fetal calf serum, or the cells were stepped down to serum-free medium with 103 nmhydrocortisone for 2 days. Recombinant human VEGF was added to the cell culture at 500 (12 nm), 50 (1.2 nm), or 5 ng/ml (0.12 nm). Cells were returned to the incubator for the indicated time and then washed two times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (200 μm) and harvested in lysis buffer as described below. The retinas were homogenized in 6 m urea buffer (6 m urea, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris pH 8.0, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2 5 mmEGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm benzamidine (which had been shown previously to extract nearly 100% of ZO-1 (19Anderson J.M. Stevenson B.R. Jesaitis A. Goodenough D.A. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1141-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar)). 5-s pulses with a probe sonicator (Tekmar) were used to disrupt the cells. Cells were solubilized in 6 m urea buffer with scraping or using a Triton/deoxycholate/SDS buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm benzamidine) along with CømpleteTM (EDTA-free), a protease inhibitor mixture tablet. Additionally, both buffers were brought to 1 mmNaV04, 10 mm NaF, and 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate. Western blotting of occludin allowed quantification of the protein as well as identification of a post-translational modification. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay and an albumin standard curve. For occludin blots, equal protein content was loaded onto 10% SDS gels and 12-mA current was applied for approximately 16 h. Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose using CAPS transfer buffer (10 mm, 10% MeOH) at 50 V for 1.5 h. Nitrocellulose was blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST), blotted with anti-occludin antibody at 1:3000 dilution, and washed and blotted with biotin-linked anti-rabbit antibody followed by avidin-linked alkaline phosphatase. Binding was detected using enhanced chemifluorescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and a FluorImager 595 with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Tyrosine phosphorylation of ZO-1 was determined by immunoprecipitation followed by phosphotyrosine blotting. Retinas from eyes injected with VEGF or saline were sonicated in 300 μl of 6 m urea buffer, rocked for 15 min, and spun in a microfuge for 10 min, and supernatants were collected. For immunoprecipitation, 100 μl of lysates were diluted 10-fold with lysis buffer without urea, and 5 μl of anti-ZO-1 antibody and 60 μl of protein A-Sepharose were added. Samples were incubated for at least 4 h at 4 °C, pelleted, washed twice with a buffer identical to the lysis buffer except containing only 1 m urea, and finally washed once with 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Samples were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and then transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked with 3% albumin, and phosphotyrosine was detected by blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (1:1000 dilution) followed by secondary anti-mouse IgG antibody linked to alkaline phosphatase and enhanced chemifluorescence or by blotting with 125I-labeled protein A. Protein concentrations were determined to ensure that nearly equal protein was used for the immunoprecipitation, and a straight blot for ZO-1 content was carried out. Phosphotyrosine content was expressed as the amount of ZO-1 phosphotyrosine per ZO-1 protein. Bands were quantified using volume analysis in ImageQuant software or by scanning autoradiograms and analyzing the images using NIH Image analysis software. Vascular permeability factor/vascular endothelial growth factor causes rapid post-translational modifications to the tight junction protein occludin. Previously, we demonstrated that VEGF treatment of BREC in culture decreased tight junction protein occludin content by 50% after 6 h (17Antonetti D. Barber A. Khin S. Lieth E. Tarbell J. Gardner T. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1953-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). However, VEGF increases retinal vascular permeability to fluorescein in vivo within 10 min of injection into the vitreous cavity (20Aiello L.P. Bursell S.E. Clermont A. Duh E. Ishii H. Takagi C. Mori F. Ciulla T.A. Ways K. Jirousek M. Smith L.E.H. King G.L. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1473-1480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and begins to increase water permeability in BAEC cultures within 20 min and in BREC by 1 h (21Yaccino J. Chang Y. Hollis T. Gardner T. Tarbell J. Curr. Eye Res. 1997; 16: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). 2Y. S. Chang, L. L. Munn, M. V. Hillsley, R. O. Dull, T. W. Gardner, R. K. Jain, and J. M. Tarbell, manuscript in preparation. Therefore, we set out to determine whether VEGF also induced rapid alterations in the tight junction proteins, which could account for the observed early changes in barrier permeability. Toward this end, VEGF was injected into rat vitreous cavity, and changes in occludin were observed through Western blot analysis. Rats were anesthetized, and VEGF was injected into one eye to a final concentration of 25 ng/ml while vehicle was injected into the contralateral eye. The eyes were enucleated and the retinas extracted within 3 min. The retinas were homogenized in 6 murea buffer that was previously shown to extract nearly 100% of ZO-1 (19Anderson J.M. Stevenson B.R. Jesaitis A. Goodenough D.A. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1141-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). This buffer extracted approximately 75–90% of the occludin when compared with the amount extracted from the insoluble pellet using Laemmli sample buffer. 3D. A. Antonetti, unpublished observations.Western blotting of equal protein content revealed a series of bands from approximately 60 to 70 kDa and additional faint bands at approximately 80 kDa as compared with a negative control with no primary antibody (data not shown). Previous immunohistochemical staining of rat retinas in our laboratory revealed that occludin expression was restricted to the retinal vasculature (17Antonetti D. Barber A. Khin S. Lieth E. Tarbell J. Gardner T. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1953-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). After VEGF injection, an increase in occludin content was observed at 15 min, was maximal by 45 min, and began to decrease by 90 min, as seen in Fig.1. The same observation was made from a separate set of animals (blot not shown). This increase probably represents the movement of occludin from an insoluble pool to a soluble pool or could be because of increased protein synthesis of occludin. Evidence for a change in occludin post-translational modification was observed as a change in occludin migration on the polyacrylamide gels. In the saline-injected eyes, the strongest band was the fastest migrating band at ∼60 kDa, which we have termed occludin α. Strikingly, after VEGF injection about half of the occludin migrated as a 62-kDa form, which we have termed occludin β (Fig. 1). The difference in occludin α and β contents are shown in Fig.1 B . Notice that occludin β, or the post-translationally modified occludin, increases to a greater extent than occludin α, particularly at the 45-min time point. The change in occludin migration was caused by a change in the phosphorylation state of occludin. Treating samples with 20 units of alkaline phosphatase caused occludin to run as a single band as compared with control samples or samples incubated in parallel without alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 2). This change in occludin migration pattern was observed for both saline- and VEGF-treated rat retinas. The single band observed with alkaline phosphatase incubation may have run faster than the fastest migrating band in the control samples and could be caused by a persistent phosphorylation of occludin, although a definitive conclusion could not be drawn. This rapid change in occludin phosphorylation and extractability correlates well with the ability of VEGF to increase vascular permeability. Experiments by Aiello et al. (20Aiello L.P. Bursell S.E. Clermont A. Duh E. Ishii H. Takagi C. Mori F. Ciulla T.A. Ways K. Jirousek M. Smith L.E.H. King G.L. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1473-1480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that VEGF caused fluorescein to leak into the retina from the vascular lumen starting at about 10 min after injection of hormone into the rat vitreous cavity. The ability of VEGF to stimulate occludin phosphorylation and transiently increase the amount of occludin extracted was also observed in bovine retinal endothelial cells. BREC cultures were brought to confluence for 2 days, were stepped down from 20 to 10% serum overnight, and were then treated with VEGF for varying amounts of time before being harvested in urea extraction buffer. Untreated BREC yielded two bands of approximately 60 and 62 kDa when blotted for occludin (occludin α and β, respectively). The higher base-line level of occludin phosphorylation in the BREC cultures correlates with the greater permeability of retinal endothelial cells in culture compared with in vivo conditions. Addition of VEGF caused a complete shift to the slower migrating band of ∼62 kDa and a trend toward an increase in the amount of occludin extracted within 15 min. These changes were maintained until 30 min and returned by 60 min (Fig.3, A and B ). Alkaline phosphatase treatment of the lysates again caused occludin to migrate as a single band at ∼60 kDa, whereas immunoprecipitation of occludin and phosphotyrosine blotting did not yield any evidence for occludin tyrosine phosphorylation (results not shown). These data suggest that VEGF causes occludin phosphorylation on serine or threonine residues. The same increase in extractability of occludin occurred when the experiment was conducted using a different extraction buffer containing 0.2% SDS, sodium deoxycholate, and Nonidet P-40 (Fig. 3 C ). The decrease in extractable occludin at the longer time points may represent a return of occludin to an insoluble pool or may represent an increase in occludin degradation. The effect of VEGF on BREC was also assessed under serum-free conditions. While VEGF is a potent permeabilizing agent, hydrocortisone reduces vascular permeability and tissue edema. We found that endothelial cells could be maintained in culture without serum for 2 days in the presence of 103 nm hydrocortisone. These cells were treated with 1.2 nm VEGF and extracted in the urea buffer. Again, the shift in occludin migration from two bands, as seen after 0 and 5 min, to one band, after 15 and 30 min, was observed, and this effect partly reversed by 60 min. Additionally, the increased extractability of occludin was even more pronounced under these conditions (Fig. 4, A andB ). Further studies of the effects of hydrocortisone on endothelial cell barrier properties are currently being completed. The observed increase in occludin phosphorylation and extractability in cells in culture again correlate with increased permeability. Previous experiments by Yaccino et al. (21Yaccino J. Chang Y. Hollis T. Gardner T. Tarbell J. Curr. Eye Res. 1997; 16: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and Chang et al. reveal an increase in BAEC and BREC water permeability in response to VEGF, which started at about 20 or 60 min, respectively, after the addition of VEGF.2 In these experiments the water permeability continued to increase as long as the measurements were obtained (up to 4 h). Thus, if the observed correlation in occludin phosphorylation is indeed associated with the mechanism for increased water permeability, then the phosphorylation may be an initiating event that would precede additional changes in the tight junctions, yielding continued increased permeability. In a previous report we showed that VEGF treatment of BREC cultures reduced occludin content by 50% after 6 h (17Antonetti D. Barber A. Khin S. Lieth E. Tarbell J. Gardner T. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1953-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar); therefore, it is possible that occludin phosphorylation signals a degradation process. Conversely, occludin phosphorylation may initiate allosteric conformational changes allowing acute increases in permeability across the endothelial barrier, and degradation of the tight junction protein may then contribute to long term increased permeability. To our knowledge this is the first observation of occludin phosphorylation associated with increased barrier permeability. Previously, Sakakibara et al. (22Sakakibara A. Furuse M. Saitou M. Ando-Akatsuka Y. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) reported occludin phosphorylation associated with decreased barrier permeability in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. The investigators showed that a fraction of occludin in the Nonidet P-40 insoluble pool was hyperphosphorylated and migrated at an apparent molecular mass of ∼82 kDa. Furthermore, this phosphorylated form of occludin was lost upon low calcium treatment, which caused increased permeability. Our observation differs from their report in several ways; occludin phosphorylation in response to VEGF occurs in a time frame consistent with mediating increased barrier permeability, causes occludin to migrate at ∼62 kDa, and represents the majority of the occludin protein after VEGF treatment. The increase in the occludin phosphorylation state migrating at 62 kDa could be because of an increase in kinase activity or because of a phosphatase active on hyperphosphorylated occludin. Determinations of the sites of phosphorylation as well as the kinases or phosphatases responsible are currently under way in our laboratory. In addition to changes in the occludin phosphorylation state, VEGF induces tyrosine phosphorylation of ZO-1. In experiments identical to those described above, VEGF (final concentration 25 ng/ml) was injected into the vitreous cavity of anesthetized rats, and vehicle was injected into the contralateral eye. The eyes were enucleated, and retinas were removed and homogenized in urea extraction buffer as described above. A portion of the sample was diluted 1 in 10, and ZO-1 was immunoprecipitated. Precipitated proteins were separated on polyacrylamide gels, blotted, and probed for phosphotyrosine. As seen in Fig. 5 A , VEGF induced an increase in ZO-1 tyrosine phosphorylation after 15 and 45 min. Thetop two arrows indicate the typical doublet of ZO-1 depicting the α+ and α− isoforms at ∼220 kDa, and the lower arrow may represent ZO-2, a protein of ∼180 kDa. In a separate experiment the tyrosine phosphorylation of ZO-1 was observed at 90 min and quantitated relative to immunoprecipitated ZO-1 content. VEGF caused a 4-fold increase in ZO-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in rat retinas 90 min after intravitreal injection (Fig. 5, B and C ). A role for ZO-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in tight junction regulation is not unprecedented; pervanadate and the more specific tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor phenylarsine oxide both increased the tyrosine phosphorylation state of a number of junctional complex proteins including ZO-1 and decreased trans -electrical resistance in MDCK cells (23Staddon J.M. Herrenknecht K. Smales C. Rubin L.L. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 609-619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Temperature-sensitive v-Src transformed cells increased ZO-1 tyrosine phosphorylation at the permissive temperature and decreased trans -electrical resistance (24Takeda H. Tsukita S. Cell Struct. Funct. 1995; 20: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Conversely, EGF stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of ZO-1 and was associated with the movement of ZO-1 from a diffuse cytoplasmic location to the plasma membrane in subconfluent A431 cells (25Itallie C.M.V. Balda M.S. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1735-1742PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that ZO-1 tyrosine phosphorylation is a component of tight junction regulation. Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness in the United States and is strongly correlated with vascular permeability (26Klein R. Klein B.E.K. Moss S.E. Cruickshanks K.J. Ophthalmology. 1995; 102: 7-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). The cause of the vascular changes is still under debate. However, recent studies have revealed an increase in permeabilizing agents in the retina of both animal models and patients with diabetes. Studies by Aiello et al. have revealed that VEGF levels are increased in the vitreous fluid of patients with diabetic retinopathy (27Aiello L.P. Avery R.L. Arrigg P.G. Keyt B.A. Jampel H.D. Shah S.T. Pasquale L.R. Thieme H. Iwamoto M.A. Park J.E. Nguyen H.V. Aiello L.M. Ferrara N. King G.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 331: 1480-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (3407) Google Scholar) as well as in animal models of diabetes (20Aiello L.P. Bursell S.E. Clermont A. Duh E. Ishii H. Takagi C. Mori F. Ciulla T.A. Ways K. Jirousek M. Smith L.E.H. King G.L. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1473-1480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, a soluble form of the VEGF receptor inhibited vascular angiogenesis in a hypoxia model of retinopathy (28Aiello L.P. Pierce E.A. Foley E.D. Takagi H. Chen H. Riddle L. Ferrara N. King G.L. Smith L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10457-10461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar). An increase in VEGF appears after 6 mo of experimentally induced diabetes in the rat (29Murata T. Nakagawa K. Khalil A. Ishibashi T. Inomata H. Sueishi K. Lab. Invest. 1996; 74: 819-825PubMed Google Scholar), a time when vascular permeability is induced but vascular angiogenesis remains dormant. Experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis increases the expression of VEGF and transforming growth factor-β and also induces increased vascular permeability without stimulating angiogenesis (30Vinores S. Chan C. Vinores M. Matteson D. Chen Y. Klein D. Shi A. Ozaki H. Campochiaro P. J. Neuroimmunol. 1998; 89: 43-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The ability of VEGF to increase permeability in an endothelial barrier may arise from a number of distinct mechanisms that are not mutually exclusive. VEGF may stimulate transporter activity for specific molecules as was observed for GLUT-1 glucose transporter activity in BREC culture (31Sone H. Kumagai A.K. Baynes J.W. King G.L.

Alternatively, VEGF may stimulate endocytosis and vesicular transport. Interestingly, VEGF stimulates the production of vesiculo-vacuolar organelles, or VVOs, that may act as a channel through venule endothelial cells (32Feng D. Nagy J.A. Hipp J. Pyne K. Dvorak H.F.

Miller C. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1987; 28: 2000-2014PubMed Google Scholar), and production of large VVOs in retinal blood vessels has not been reported in diabetes. Alternatively, VEGF may regulate paracellular permeability by regulating endothelial cell to cell junctions, a mechanism supported by the data presented herein. VEGF-induced changes in tight junction protein phosphorylation state may be a fundamental mechanism by which vascular permeability is regulated. These findings have importance for the understanding of physiologic regulation of vascular permeability for normal tissue function, and the observed changes in tight junction proteins may contribute to the tissue edema that results from acute inflammatory insults and chronic diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy and tumors."

One of the earliest changes observed in arthritis is the depletion of cartilage aggrecan due to increased proteolytic cleavage within the interglobular domain. Two major sites of cleavage have been identified in this region at Asn341-Phe342 and Glu373-Ala374. While several matrix metalloproteinases have been shown to cleave at Asn341-Phe342, an as yet unidentified protein termed “aggrecanase” is responsible for cleavage at Glu373-Ala374 and is hypothesized to play a pivotal role in cartilage damage. We have identified and cloned a novel disintegrin metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs that possesses aggrecanase activity, ADAMTS11 (aggrecanase-2), which has extensive homology to ADAMTS4 (aggrecanase-1) and the inflammation-associated gene ADAMTS1 . ADAMTS11 possesses a number of conserved domains that have been shown to play a role in integrin binding, cell-cell interactions, and extracellular matrix binding. We have expressed recombinant human ADAMTS11 in insect cells and shown that it cleaves aggrecan at the Glu373-Ala374 site, with the cleavage pattern and inhibitor profile being indistinguishable from that observed with native aggrecanase. A comparison of the structure and expression patterns of ADAMTS11, ADAMTS4, and ADAMTS1 is also described. Our findings will facilitate the study of the mechanisms of cartilage degradation and provide targets to search for effective inhibitors of cartilage depletion in arthritic disease.

Aggrecan contains two N-terminal globular domains, G1 and G2, separated by a proteolyticaly sensitive interglobular domain, followed by a glycosaminoglycan attachment region and a C-terminal globular domain (G3). The G1 domain of aggrecan interacts with hyaluronic acid and link protein to form large aggregates containing multiple aggrecan monomers that are trapped within the cartilage matrix. Cleavage of aggrecan has been shown to occur at Asn341-Phe342 and Glu373-Ala374 within the interglobular domain, with the cleaved aggrecan being free to exit the matrix since it lacks the G1 domain, which is responsible for formation of the high molecular weight complexes. Results from several studies suggest that cleavage at the Glu373-Ala374 site is responsible for the increased aggrecan degradation observed in inflammatory joint disease.

The ADAMs have been shown to have similar domain arrangements, consisting of pre-, pro-, proteinase, disintegrin-like, cysteine-rich, epidermal growth factor-like, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains. A novel ADAM family member containing multiple carboxy thrombospondin motifs, ADAMTS1 (a disintegrin andmetalloproteinase withthrombospondin motifs), has recently been described in mice (18Kuno K. Kanada N. Nakashima E. Fujiki F. Ichimura F. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 556-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). ADAMTS1 is structurally conserved with other members of the ADAM family; however, unlike the majority of ADAM family members, it lacks a transmembrane domain and contains unique thrombospondin motifs that are responsible for extracellular matrix binding (18Kuno K.

Another ADAM family member, kuzbanian, is required for proteolytic processing of theNotch ligand Delta , which is involved in neural cell fate determination (24Qi H. Rand M.D. Wu X. Sestan N. Wang W. Rakic P. Xu T. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Science. 1999; 283: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). However, to date, the function of the majority of ADAMs family members has yet to be elucidated.In the work reported herein, we describe the purification, cloning, and expression of an aggrecanase from the ADAMTS family, ADAMTS11. Recently, we have also described the purification and characterization of another aggrecanase, ADAMTS4 (aggrecanase-1), using a different purification protocol from that used to purify ADAMTS11 (25Tortorella M.D. Burn T.C.

Since the analysis of the ADAMTS11 sequence revealed extensive homology to ADAMTS4 and murine ADAMTS1, we also examined levels of gene expression for these family members in a variety of normal and arthritic human tissues. ADAMTS11, along with ADAMTS4, is likely to play a key role in inflammatory joint disease and the subsequent cartilage degradation. Thus, the availability of the recombinant protein provides a valuable tool in the effort to identify and characterize therapeutically useful inhibitors.DISCUSSIONWe have described the cloning of a novel disintegrin metalloproteinase and demonstrate that it possesses aggrecanase activity. Our data indicate that the aggrecanase/ADAMTS1 subfamily has multiple members, with the family being conserved from C. elegans through human. The two human aggrecanases and ADAMTS1 described in this report are expressed in a variety of tissues in addition to arthritic tissues; however, it is impossible to draw any broad conclusions about underlying themes of gene expression patterns based on the tissues examined. In situ hybridizations will be required to determine what cell types are responsible for the observed gene expression in each tissue. Based on the broad expression patterns of ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS11 , it is likely that they have other roles in addition to cartilage remodeling. At present, it is unknown whether any of these genes are up-regulated in inflammatory joint disease due to the limited availability of human RNA from matched normal and arthritic tissues. Animal models will probably be required to address this latter issue. The fact that all three family members are expressed in the limited number of arthritic tissues examined in this report suggests that they are likely to play a role in inflammatory joint disease.Sequence analysis of ADAMTS11 suggests that the enzyme is synthesized in an inactive pro-form that may be processed by furin during transit through the secretory pathway. This hypothesis is supported by data indicating that the N-terminal peptide sequence of the enzyme purified from bovine cartilage conditioned medium starts immediately C-terminal of a consensus furin cleavage site. Furthermore, inhibition of furin may be responsible for the previously described block in aggrecan cleavage seen in response to a serine-protease inhibitor (55Bryson H. Bunning R.A. Feltell R. Kam C.M. Kerrigan J. Powers J.C. Buttle D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).ADAMTS11 exhibits the consensus motif, HEXX HXX GXX H, whose three conserved histidine residues are involved in binding of the catalytically essential zinc ion in members of the metzincin superfamily (38Stocker W. Grams F. Baumann U. Reinemer P. Gomis-Ruth F.X. McKay D.B. Bode W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 823-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). This protein also has an aspartic acid following the third conserved histidine residue, as is found in the adamalysin family, and a conserved methionine downstream of the active site, which is found in members of the metzincin family as part of a “Met turn” (38Stocker W. Grams F. Baumann U. Reinemer P. Gomis-Ruth F.X. McKay D.B. Bode W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 823-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 56Bode W. Gomis-Ruth F.X. Huber R. Zwilling R. Stocker W. Nature. 1992; 358: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). While both ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS1 have a similar zinc-binding motif, with an aspartic acid residue following the third histidine and a downstream methionine, these two proteins have an asparagine residue between the second and third histidine instead of a glycine. In the metzincins whose crystal structures have been determined, the active site helix is terminated at this invariant glycine residue, which results in the main chain abruptly turning downward into the lower domain of the protein (38Stocker W. Grams F. Baumann U. Reinemer P. Gomis-Ruth F.X. McKay D.B. Bode W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 823-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). The conserved glycine in each of the enzymes exhibits an identical conformation not accessible to non-Gly residues. This raises the possibility that ADAMTS11 may exhibit subtle structural differences in this region from ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS1. However, this has not been observed as any difference in cleavage of aggrecan by ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS11 or in inhibitor profiles against these two proteases. Further elucidation of the effect of this substitution awaits determination of the crystal structures of these proteases.ADAMTS11 possesses several different domains that are likely to play a role in adhesion. Disintegrin proteins are found in snake venoms, where they act as inhibitors of platelet aggregation by binding to integrins through a conserved RGD motif (16Blobel C.P. Cell. 1997; 90: 589-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 49Gould R.J. Polokoff M.A. Friedman P.A. Huang T.F. Holt J.C. Cook J.J. Niewiarowski S. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1990; 195: 168-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Disintegrin-like domains, while lacking the RGD motif, have also been implicated in integrin binding (50Almeida E.A. Huovila A.P. Sutherland A.E. Stephens L.E. Calarco P.G. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. Sonnenberg A. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. White J.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13094-13102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The function of the disintegrin-like domain of ADAMTS11 is unclear; it may allow binding to integrins expressed on the articular chondrocytes (57Salter D.M. Hughes D.E. Simpson R. Gardner D.L. Br. J. Rheumatol. 1992; 31: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The TSP type I motif of thrombospondin has been implicated in binding to matrix macromolecules and cell adhesion (52Guo N.H. Krutzsch H.C. Negre E. Zabrenetzky V.S. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19349-19355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,53Guo N.H. Krutzsch H.C. Negre E. Vogel T. Blake D.A. Roberts D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3040-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), with recent data indicating that the TSP motif and submotif of murine ADAMTS1 bind to heparin and the extracellular matrix (18Kuno K. Kanada N. Nakashima E. Fujiki F. Ichimura F. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 556-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 19Kuno K. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13912-13917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The TSP motif and submotif of ADAMTS11 may be responsible for binding to the glycosaminoglycans of aggrecan. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that deglycosylation of aggrecan decreases the production of Glu373-Ala374 cleavage products by aggrecanases (58Pratta M.A. Arner E.C. Trans. Orthop. Res. Soc. 1997; 22: 453Google Scholar). Sequences within the spacer region between the TSP motifs of ADAMTS11 are conserved in all the family members and are likely to provide an additional adhesion motif, since recent studies demonstrate that sequences within the spacer region of murine ADAMTS1 can themselves bind tightly to the extracellular matrix (19Kuno K. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13912-13917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The variable number of TSP submotifs in the ADAMTS family members may lead to altered affinities for glycosaminoglycans, since the TSP submotifs of ADAMTS1 have been shown to play a role in extracellular matrix binding (19Kuno K. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13912-13917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar).Comparison of the intron/exon structure of the murineADAMTS1 gene to the protein domains indicates that the two TSP submotifs are present in the final exon of the gene (59Kuno K. Iizasa H. Ohno S. Matsushima K. Genomics. 1997; 46: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Based on this observation, the evolution of the variable number of submotifs in ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS11 is likely to have involved more than the simple deletion of an internal exon encoding an individual TSP submotif. Determination of the exon/intron structure of the three family members is likely to shed light on evolutionary paths that have led to the present diversity in this gene family. A comparison of the promoters for the genes may also provide insight into the different regulatory elements controlling the expression of the family members.In preliminary experiments, we have identified additional genes that have a high degree of homology to the members of the aggrecanase/ADAMTS1 subfamily. It is unclear if other family members besides ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS11 will possess aggrecanase activity. However, it is possible that ADAMTS1 has aggrecanase activity given its high degree of homology with ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS11, as well as its high level of expression in arthritic tissues. Additional work will focus on the role of the ADAMTS family of enzymes in inflammation and joint disease and the regulation of the respective genes. The availability of recombinant proteins for this family of genes will aid in the identification of specific inhibitors of the different enzymes that will be important tools for deciphering the biological role of the individual family members. In addition, the recombinant proteins will facilitate the development of potential therapeutics for inhibiting aggrecan degradation and the subsequent cartilage damage associated with inflammatory joint disease. Aggrecan is the major proteoglycan of cartilage and is responsible for its compressibility and stiffness. Aggrecan contains two N-terminal globular domains, G1 and G2, separated by a proteolyticaly sensitive interglobular domain, followed by a glycosaminoglycan attachment region and a C-terminal globular domain (G3). The G1 domain of aggrecan interacts with hyaluronic acid and link protein to form large aggregates containing multiple aggrecan monomers that are trapped within the cartilage matrix.

The ADAMs have been shown to have similar domain arrangements, consisting of pre-, pro-, proteinase, disintegrin-like, cysteine-rich, epidermal growth factor-like, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains. A novel ADAM family member containing multiple carboxy thrombospondin motifs, ADAMTS1 (a disintegrin andmetalloproteinase withthrombospondin motifs), has recently been described in mice (18Kuno K. Kanada N. Nakashima E. Fujiki F. Ichimura F. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 556-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). ADAMTS1 is structurally conserved with other members of the ADAM family; however, unlike the majority of ADAM family members, it lacks a transmembrane domain and contains unique thrombospondin motifs that are responsible for extracellular matrix binding (18Kuno K.

Early ADAM family members were shown to play roles in sperm-egg fusion and myotube fusion (20Blobel C.P. Wolfsberg T.G. Turck C.W. Myles D.G. Primakoff P. White J.M.

Nature. 1995; 377: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Recently, the enzyme responsible for processing precursor tumor necrosis factor-α has been shown to be a disintegrin metalloproteinase (22Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P. Srinivasan S. Nelson N. Boiani N. Schooley K.A. Gerhart M. Davis R. Fitzner J.N. Johnson R.S. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Cerretti D.P.

Nature. 1997; 385: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar). Another ADAM family member, kuzbanian, is required for proteolytic processing of theNotch ligand Delta , which is involved in neural cell fate determination (24Qi H. Rand M.D. Wu X. Sestan N. Wang W. Rakic P. Xu T. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Science. 1999; 283: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). However, to date, the function of the majority of ADAMs family members has yet to be elucidated. In the work reported herein, we describe the purification, cloning, and expression of an aggrecanase from the ADAMTS family, ADAMTS11. Recently, we have also described the purification and characterization of another aggrecanase, ADAMTS4 (aggrecanase-1), using a different purification protocol from that used to purify ADAMTS11 (25Tortorella M.D. Burn T.C. Pratta M.A. Abbaszade I. Hollis J.M. Liu R. Rosenfeld S.A. Copeland R.A. Decicco C.P. Wynn R. Rockwell A. Yang F. Duke J.L. Solomon K. George H. Bruckner R. Nagase H. Itoh Y. Ellis D.M. Ross H.

Since the analysis of the ADAMTS11 sequence revealed extensive homology to ADAMTS4 and murine ADAMTS1, we also examined levels of gene expression for these family members in a variety of normal and arthritic human tissues. ADAMTS11, along with ADAMTS4, is likely to play a key role in inflammatory joint disease and the subsequent cartilage degradation. Thus, the availability of the recombinant protein provides a valuable tool in the effort to identify and characterize therapeutically useful inhibitors. DISCUSSIONWe have described the cloning of a novel disintegrin metalloproteinase and demonstrate that it possesses aggrecanase activity. Our data indicate that the aggrecanase/ADAMTS1 subfamily has multiple members, with the family being conserved from C. elegans through human. The two human aggrecanases and ADAMTS1 described in this report are expressed in a variety of tissues in addition to arthritic tissues; however, it is impossible to draw any broad conclusions about underlying themes of gene expression patterns based on the tissues examined. In situ hybridizations will be required to determine what cell types are responsible for the observed gene expression in each tissue. Based on the broad expression patterns of ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS11 , it is likely that they have other roles in addition to cartilage remodeling. At present, it is unknown whether any of these genes are up-regulated in inflammatory joint disease due to the limited availability of human RNA from matched normal and arthritic tissues. Animal models will probably be required to address this latter issue. The fact that all three family members are expressed in the limited number of arthritic tissues examined in this report suggests that they are likely to play a role in inflammatory joint disease.Sequence analysis of ADAMTS11 suggests that the enzyme is synthesized in an inactive pro-form that may be processed by furin during transit through the secretory pathway. This hypothesis is supported by data indicating that the N-terminal peptide sequence of the enzyme purified from bovine cartilage conditioned medium starts immediately C-terminal of a consensus furin cleavage site. Furthermore, inhibition of furin may be responsible for the previously described block in aggrecan cleavage seen in response to a serine-protease inhibitor (55Bryson H. Bunning R.A. Feltell R. Kam C.M. Kerrigan J. Powers J.C. Buttle D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).ADAMTS11 exhibits the consensus motif, HEXX HXX GXX H, whose three conserved histidine residues are involved in binding of the catalytically essential zinc ion in members of the metzincin superfamily (38Stocker W. Grams F. Baumann U. Reinemer P. Gomis-Ruth F.X. McKay D.B. Bode W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 823-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). This protein also has an aspartic acid following the third conserved histidine residue, as is found in the adamalysin family, and a conserved methionine downstream of the active site, which is found in members of the metzincin family as part of a “Met turn” (38Stocker W. Grams F. Baumann U. Reinemer P. Gomis-Ruth F.X. McKay D.B. Bode W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 823-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 56Bode W. Gomis-Ruth F.X. Huber R. Zwilling R. Stocker W. Nature. 1992; 358: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). While both ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS1 have a similar zinc-binding motif, with an aspartic acid residue following the third histidine and a downstream methionine, these two proteins have an asparagine residue between the second and third histidine instead of a glycine. In the metzincins whose crystal structures have been determined, the active site helix is terminated at this invariant glycine residue, which results in the main chain abruptly turning downward into the lower domain of the protein (38Stocker W. Grams F. Baumann U. Reinemer P. Gomis-Ruth F.X. McKay D.B. Bode W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 823-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). The conserved glycine in each of the enzymes exhibits an identical conformation not accessible to non-Gly residues. This raises the possibility that ADAMTS11 may exhibit subtle structural differences in this region from ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS1. However, this has not been observed as any difference in cleavage of aggrecan by ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS11 or in inhibitor profiles against these two proteases. Further elucidation of the effect of this substitution awaits determination of the crystal structures of these proteases.ADAMTS11 possesses several different domains that are likely to play a role in adhesion. Disintegrin proteins are found in snake venoms, where they act as inhibitors of platelet aggregation by binding to integrins through a conserved RGD motif (16Blobel C.P. Cell. 1997; 90: 589-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 49Gould R.J. Polokoff M.A. Friedman P.A. Huang T.F. Holt J.C. Cook J.J. Niewiarowski S. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1990; 195: 168-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Disintegrin-like domains, while lacking the RGD motif, have also been implicated in integrin binding (50Almeida E.A. Huovila A.P. Sutherland A.E. Stephens L.E. Calarco P.G. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. Sonnenberg A. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. White J.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13094-13102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The function of the disintegrin-like domain of ADAMTS11 is unclear; it may allow binding to integrins expressed on the articular chondrocytes (57Salter D.M. Hughes D.E. Simpson R. Gardner D.L. Br. J. Rheumatol. 1992; 31: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The TSP type I motif of thrombospondin has been implicated in binding to matrix macromolecules and cell adhesion (52Guo N.H.

Roberts D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3040-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), with recent data indicating that the TSP motif and submotif of murine ADAMTS1 bind to heparin and the extracellular matrix (18Kuno K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 13912-13917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The TSP motif and submotif of ADAMTS11 may be responsible for binding to the glycosaminoglycans of aggrecan. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that deglycosylation of aggrecan decreases the production of Glu373-Ala374 cleavage products by aggrecanases (58Pratta M.A. Arner E.C. Trans. Orthop. Res. Soc. 1997; 22: 453Google Scholar). Sequences within the spacer region between the TSP motifs of ADAMTS11 are conserved in all the family members and are likely to provide an additional adhesion motif, since recent studies demonstrate that sequences within the spacer region of murine ADAMTS1 can themselves bind tightly to the extracellular matrix (19Kuno K. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13912-13917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The variable number of TSP submotifs in the ADAMTS family members may lead to altered affinities for glycosaminoglycans, since the TSP submotifs of ADAMTS1 have been shown to play a role in extracellular matrix binding (19Kuno K. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13912-13917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar).Comparison of the intron/exon structure of the murineADAMTS1 gene to the protein domains indicates that the two TSP submotifs are present in the final exon of the gene (59Kuno K. Iizasa H. Ohno S. Matsushima K. Genomics. 1997; 46: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Based on this observation, the evolution of the variable number of submotifs in ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS11 is likely to have involved more than the simple deletion of an internal exon encoding an individual TSP submotif. Determination of the exon/intron structure of the three family members is likely to shed light on evolutionary paths that have led to the present diversity in this gene family. A comparison of the promoters for the genes may also provide insight into the different regulatory elements controlling the expression of the family members.In preliminary experiments, we have identified additional genes that have a high degree of homology to the members of the aggrecanase/ADAMTS1 subfamily. It is unclear if other family members besides ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS11 will possess aggrecanase activity. However, it is possible that ADAMTS1 has aggrecanase activity given its high degree of homology with ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS11, as well as its high level of expression in arthritic tissues. Additional work will focus on the role of the ADAMTS family of enzymes in inflammation and joint disease and the regulation of the respective genes. The availability of recombinant proteins for this family of genes will aid in the identification of specific inhibitors of the different enzymes that will be important tools for deciphering the biological role of the individual family members. In addition, the recombinant proteins will facilitate the development of potential therapeutics for inhibiting aggrecan degradation and the subsequent cartilage damage associated with inflammatory joint disease.

Eckman C. Jensen M. Song X. Citron M. Suzuki N. Bird T.D. Hardy J. Hutton M. Kukull W. Larson E. Levylahad E. Viitanen M. Peskind E. Poorkaj P. Schellenberg G. Tanzi R.E Wasco W. Lannfelt L.

We have previously found that Zn(II), Cu(II), and, to a lesser extent, Fe(III), at low μm concentrations, induce the rapid aggregation of synthetic Aβ (3Bush A.I. Pettingell W.H. Multhaup G.

These transition metal ions are highly concentrated in the neocortical regions most affected in AD, and all three metal ions are both significantly elevated in the neuropil of these regions in Alzheimer's disease and further concentrated within amyloid plaque deposits (4Lovell M.A. Robertson J.D. Teesdale W.J. Campbell J.L. Markesbery W.R. J. Neurol. Sci. 1998; 158: 47-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar). We recently reported that Zn(II)- or Cu(II)-induced Aβ precipitation is reversed by treating the aggregate with metal chelators (5Huang X. Atwood C.S. Moir R.D. Hartshorn M.A. Vonsattel J.P.

We hypothesized that if the metal ions within brain amyloid mediated the assembly of Aβ aggregates, then treating tissue with metal chelators should induce the solubilization of Aβ. We tested this hypothesis by extracting Aβ amyloid-bearing post-mortem brain tissue in the presence and absence of various metal ion chelators and assaying the distribution of Aβ within the soluble and insoluble phases. Post-mortem tissues, stored at −80 °C, were obtained from the National Heath and Medical Research Council-supported Brain Bank at the University of Melbourne together with accompanying histopathological and clinical data. AD was assessed according to Consortium to Establish a Register for Alzheimer's Disease criteria (7Mirra S.S. Heyman A. McKeel D. Sumi S.M. Crain B.J. Brownlee L.M. Vogel F.S. Hughes J.P. van Belle G. Berg L. Neurology. 1991; 41: 479-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to examine the chemical architecture of the Aβ deposition that is observed in non-AD aged brain, Aβ immunohistochemistry was used to select age-matched control (AC) cases that did not reach Consortium to Establish a Register for Alzheimer's Disease criteria and in which amyloid deposition, if present, was detectable only in the form of diffuse plaques but not neuritic plaques. No available chelator is exclusively specific for any particular metal ion; therefore, we surveyed the effects of chelators that display various respective affinities for zinc and/or copper ions relative to more abundant metal ions such as calcium and magnesium. The pK a values ofN ,N ,N ′,N ′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN) are as follows: Al(III), negligible; Ca(II), 3; Cu(II), 20.2; Fe(III), 14.4; Mg(II), negligible; Zn(II), 15.4. The pK a values of EGTA are as follows: Al(III), 13.9; Ca(II), 10.9; Cu(II), 17.6; Fe(III), 11.8; Mg(II), 5.3; Zn(II), 12.6. The pK a values of bathocuproine (BC) are as follows: Al(III), negligible; Ca(II), negligible; Cu(II), 6.1; Cu(I), 19.1; Fe(III), negligible; Mg(II), negligible; Zn(II), 4.1 (see Ref. 8National Institute of Standards and Technology (1995) Database of Critically Selected Stability Constants for Metal Complexes, Version 2.0.Google Scholar). The cortical meninges were removed, and gray matter (0.5 g) was homogenized using a DIAX 900 homogenizer (Heidolph & Co, Kelheim, Germany) for three 30-s periods at full speed, with a 30-s rest between strokes, in 3 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Bio-Rad), with the exception of EDTA, or in the presence of either various chelators or metal ions prepared in PBS. To obtain the PBS-extractable fraction, the homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was removed and divided into 1-ml aliquots. Protein within a 1-ml supernatant sample was precipitated using 1:5 ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, and pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 20 min. The pellet was prepared for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by boiling for 10 min in Tris-Tricine SDS-sample buffer containing 8% SDS, 10% mercaptoethanol, and 8 m urea. Total Aβ in the cortical samples was obtained by homogenizing in 1 ml of PBS and boiling in sample buffer as above. Tris-Tricine polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed by loading samples onto 10-well, 10–20% gradient gels (Novex, San Diego, CA), followed by transfer onto 0.2-mm nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The Aβ was detected using monoclonal antibodies WO2 (which detects Aβ40 and Aβ42 at an epitope between 5–8), G210 (which is specific for Aβ species that terminate at carboxyl residue 40), or G211 (which is specific for Aβ species that terminate at carboxyl residue 42) (9Ida N. Hartmann T. Pantel J. Schroder J. Zerfass R. Forstl H. Sandbrink R. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol.

Each gel included two or more lanes containing known quantities of synthetic Aβ (Keck Laboratory, Yale University, New Haven, CT) as reference standards. Blot films were scanned using a Relisys scanner with transparency adapter (Teco Information Systems, Taiwan), and densitometry was performed using Image 1.6 software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The dynamic range of the film/scanner was determined using a step tablet (catalog no. 911ST600, Eastman Kodak Co.), a calibrated film exposed by the manufacturer to provide steps of known increasing intensity. The quantifiable range of signal intensity for densitometric analysis of our Aβ bands was based on the comparison with a curve obtained by scanning and densitometry of the step tablet. The dynamic range of the scanner was increased by using a transparency adapter rather than reflection. For the survey comparing levels of Aβ in post-mortem brain samples from AD cases and controls (Fig. 3), the combined signals generated from 4.3-kDa immunoreactive Aβ (apparent monomer) and 8.6-kDa immunoreactive Aβ (apparent dimer) were quantified. Successive ECL exposure times of 2 min, 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, and 30 min were routinely performed to establish the optimal exposure for each individual blot, so that the relative amounts of Aβ measured by transmission densitometry remained in the linear response range of the assay, while determining at what point the signal from the Aβ standards had reached saturating intensity. Preliminary blots were routinely performed to determine how the samples were to be subsequently diluted in order to try to ensure that the Aβ signals fell within the quantifiable portion of the Aβ standard curve. All of the experimental samples extracted from the same brain specimen were initially diluted to the same degree and included on the same blot for analysis (as in Fig. 3 A ). However, it was usually not possible to determine all of the Aβ readings from one blot at one dilution. The Aβ content varied broadly between the extracted samples (note the range in Aβ intensity between the various extracts of the same brain specimens illustrated in the blots in Fig. 3 A ), and therefore it was usually necessary to perform subsequent individual blots on specific samples that had been further diluted in order to generate Aβ signals that fell within the linear range of the standard curve. This technique was chosen for the Aβ assay in preference to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, since it has the advantage of discriminating the M r of the Aβ immunoreactivity and therefore is less likely to inappropriately detect non-Aβ species such as APP fragments, like those that have recently been found to have been inadvertently cross-reacting with APP in an assay that previously had been considered to be well characterized (10Morishima-Kawashima M. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15248-15253Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The efficiency of the trichloroacetic acid precipitation procedure was validated by testing samples of whole human serum diluted 1:10 to which had been added 2 mg of synthetic Aβ 1–40 or Aβ 1–42. Aβ recovery was assessed by extracting the precipitate into SDS sample buffer and performing Western blot analysis against synthetic Aβ standards as above. Protein in the trichloroacetic acid pellet was estimated by resuspending the pellet in water and assaying the protein recovery using a BCA assay (Pierce). This indicated that the efficiency of protein and Aβ precipitation was approximately 90%. The efficiency of the 8 m urea solubilization was found to be higher and less variable that of formic acid in a parallel, blinded assay conducted independently. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. The postcentrifugation pellets were dissolved in 4 ml of 3 n HNO3 plus 1n HCl for 24 h and then assayed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. AD frontal cortex was compared with tissue from the same region of AC. A survey of the effects of the chelators at a range of concentrations (0–5 mm) on six AD cases confirmed that the solubilization of Aβ was specifically enhanced by the presence of chelator (Fig. 1), although total trichloroacetic acid-precipitable protein was not affected by any of the chelators at the concentrations tested (data not shown). Extraction of AD brain into PBS alone liberated a small amount of Aβ into the soluble phase in every case, confirming previous reports (11Tamaoka A. Kondo T. Odaka A. Sahara N. Sawamura N. Ozawa K.

In contrast, homogenization in the presence of either EGTA or TPEN at concentrations between 0.004 and 0.1 mm significantly increased soluble Aβ extraction. The optimum concentrations of EGTA or TPEN for the resolubilization of Aβ varied considerably from case to case and did not show linear concentration dependence. Typically, as illustrated in Fig.1 A , there was a biphasic response in Aβ extraction as concentrations of EGTA or TPEN were increased. One peak typically occurred when homogenization was performed in the presence of 0.004 mm of either chelator. A second peak in Aβ soluble extraction occurred at about 0.1 mm for EGTA and 2 mm for TPEN (although there was considerable case-to-case variation, and the case illustrated in Fig. 1 A had an extraction peak in response to 0.1 mm TPEN). Both TPEN and EGTA were less effective at extracting Aβ when present at concentrations in the millimolar range, and EGTA at ≥2 mmabolished the signal for Aβ (Fig. 1 B ). In contrast, BC elicited a concentration-dependent increase in Aβ extracted from AD tissue (Fig. 1 C ) plateauing at 10 mm. This finding is of interest because BC is highly selective for Cu(I), and the result is compatible with our recent finding that Aβ rapidly binds and reduces Cu(II) to Cu(I) (6Atwood C.S. Moir R.D. Huang X. Scarpa R.C. Bacarra N.M.E. Romano D.M. Hartshorn M.K. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Biol.

Lim J. Moir R.D. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7609-7616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar), suggesting that a proportion of Aβ assembly is mediated by Cu(I). Insulin-degrading enzyme, a zinc-metalloproteinase, has been reported to cleave Aβ in the brain and in biological fluids (15Kurochkin I.V. Goto S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). To determine whether chelator-mediated augmentation of Aβ solubilization was due to inhibition of this enzyme, we also performed homogenizations in the presence of 1 mm N -ethylmaleimide, a potent inhibitor of insulin-degrading enzyme. Enhancement of Aβ signal was not observed above that of PBS alone (data not shown). To determine whether other enzymatic activities may be artifactually modifying the data, we compared extraction of the brain Aβ at 4 °C to extraction at 37 °C. There was no decrease in Aβ signal to suggest enhanced degradation at the higher temperature. These controls suggest that inhibition of Aβ-cleaving enzymatic activities by chelators does not contribute to the generation of soluble Aβ under these conditions. To characterize the metal ions participating in the precipitation of brain-derived Aβ and to investigate the nonlinear response of Aβ extraction in the presence of EGTA or TPEN, we added additional metal ions to the extraction system. The presence of Cu(II) or Zn(II) in the PBS homogenization buffer abolished the increased extraction of Aβ caused by chelator treatments (data not shown). Also, the presence of additional Zn(II) (≥5 μm) or Cu(II) (≥50 μm) in the homogenization buffer without chelator abolished extraction of Aβ due to treatment with PBS alone (Fig.2 A ). Therefore, these metal ions can modulate the solubility of Aβ in this system. The presence of Cu(II) at 5 μm in the PBS homogenization buffer without chelator increased the extraction of Aβ by PBS (Fig.2 A ). At pH 7.4, Zn(II) induces far more Aβ aggregation than Cu(II), hence this result may be due to Cu(II) displacing Zn(II) from Aβ. At 20 μm, Cu(II) induces the appearance of an apparent SDS-resistant Aβ dimer, which may be due to an oxidative modification of the peptide or may represent an intermediate produced during the process of Aβ aggregation. Because millimolar concentrations of TPEN or EGTA unexpectedly suppressed Aβ resolubilization, we suspected that Mg(II) or Ca(II) may participate in the resolubilization of Aβ. Mg(II) and Ca(II) are more abundant than Cu(II) and Zn(II) in brain samples. Therefore, given the relative affinities of the chelators used, sequestration of Mg(II) and Ca(II) would require higher chelator concentrations than those necessary to complex Zn(II) and Cu(II). Samples of frontal cortex (0.5 g) from AD were homogenized in 2 mm EGTA, a condition that consistently abolishes the solubilization of Aβ (see Fig.3) while removing Zn(II), Cu(II), and other metal ions from the solid phase of the homogenate. The homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatants were discarded. The remaining (metal-depleted) pellets were rehomogenized in a further 2 ml of PBS (pH 7.4) alone, 2 mm MgCl2 in PBS, or 2 mm CaCl2 in PBS, and the homogenates were subjected to centrifugation again at 100,000 × g . Aβ in the soluble fraction was visualized by Western blot with W02 as described. When Mg(II) (2 mm) or Ca(II) (2 mm) was added to the homogenization buffer, there was no appreciable alteration in the extraction of soluble Aβ (data not shown). However, when supplemented to the pellet fraction of a brain homogenate previously depleted of metals by treatment with 2 mm EGTA during homogenization, Mg(II), and to a lesser extent Ca(II), both resolubilized the sedimentable Aβ (Fig. 2 B ). Taken together, these data indicate that although removal of metal ions like Zn(II) and Cu(II) may be necessary for the resolubilization of Aβ deposits, the presence of Mg(II) and Ca(II) is required for the sedimentable Aβ to resolubilize. Therefore, the optimal chelator concentration for the resolubilization of Aβ deposits depends upon an interplay of antagonistic factors, which may explain the nonlinear response of Aβ extraction to increasing chelator concentrations (Fig.1, A and B ) and the case-to-case variability of the chelator concentrations required to achieve maximal extraction of Aβ. In order to investigate which metal ions are removed by chelator treatments, we measured the amounts of various metals (aluminum, iron, magnesium, calcium, copper, and zinc) remaining in the brain pellet after treatment with PBS with or without chelator. Analysis of the effects of 0.1 mm TPEN was performed first, since this treatment induced an increase in soluble Aβ in the first six AD samples analyzed and because complete complexation of Mg(II) and Ca(II) was unlikely at that concentration of chelator. The observed increase in extractable Aβ correlated with significant depletion (30%) in zinc and, to a lesser extent, copper, in each of 10 AD cases examined, when compared with PBS-treated tissue. No other metal measured was significantly influenced by treatment at this concentration (Table I). A survey of the metal content of pellets taken from AD brain homogenates (n = 2) treated with the complete range of chelator concentrations described in Fig. 1, confirmed that EGTA treatment at ≥2 mm depleted (>30%) the sample of zinc, calcium, and magnesium, whereas treatment with TPEN at similar concentrations depleted zinc, copper, calcium, and iron. Measurement of metals remaining in the pellet following treatment of these samples over the range of BC concentrations studied indicated that none of the metals was depleted (data not shown). Since BC has an affinity for Cu(I) that is 13 orders of magnitude greater than for Cu(II), the lack of detectable total copper depletion caused by treatment with BC is not unexpected, since copper levels were relatively low in these preparations and the proportion of copper that exists as Cu(I) is likely to be small.Table IResidual metal levels following treatment of brain homogenates with TPENZincCopperIronCalciumMagnesiumAluminumPBS50.7 ± 4.911.9 ± 1.5227 ± 28.8202 ± 28.3197 ± 39.144.0 ± 46.2TPEN33.2 ± 4.1*9.8 ± 1.7239 ± 31.7210 ± 37.0230 ± 39.265.0 ± 45.0Frontal cortex from AD (n = 10) was homogenized in the presence or absence of 0.1 mm TPEN and metal levels in postcentrifugation pellets were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, normalized for the starting wet weight of the tissue sample.

An asterisk indicates significant difference from treatment with PBS alone on t test (p < 0.01). Results are shown ±S.E. To determine the consistency of chelator effects upon Aβ extraction from brain, we surveyed a larger sample of specimens using two chelator concentrations (0.1 and 2 mm), and also measured the total amount of Aβ in the samples by 8 m urea solubilization. After measuring the effects of treatment with the three chelators upon AD (n = 9) and AC (n = 8) brain samples, a significant pattern emerged (Fig. 3). For AD cases, significant increases of solubilized Aβ, compared with the base-line amount liberated by PBS treatment, were induced by TPEN at 2 mm (2.7-fold, p < 0.001) and BC at 0.1 mm (2.8-fold, p < 0.005) and at 2 mm (4.1-fold, p < 0.001). The effects of chelators upon the release of Aβ from the AC group were markedly attenuated and therefore did not reach significance with the exception of the effect of 0.1 mm EGTA, which induced a significant increase (2-fold, p < 0.01). These data support the possibility that Zn(II) and Cu(I) maintain the aggregated state of Aβ in AD brain but are less important in the architecture of Aβ aggregates in AC. EGTA (2 mm) inhibited the extraction of Aβ in both AD (decreased 80%, p < 0.001) and AC (decreased 50%, not significant) groups. This result is compatible with the extraction of Ca(II) and Mg(II) from the tissue homogenates, since these are metal ions that are required for the release of Aβ from deposits that have been depleted of zinc and copper (Fig. 2). The cases analyzed in Fig. 3 were also assayed with reference to the total amount of Aβ extracted from the individual brain specimens (TableII). The concentration of total Aβ in the AD specimens was much greater (31 μg/g) than the total amount in the AC samples (2.1 μg/g). The concentration of Aβ in AD brains that was extracted by PBS alone was 0.7 ± μg/g, representing 3.1% of total Aβ. The amount of Aβ in AD brain extracted by a single treatment with 2 mm BC increased significantly to 1.9 ± μg/g, representing 9.6% (range 2.0–28.8%) of total Aβ. This proportion is likely to be an underestimate of the amount of Aβ that is assembled by biometals, since the result was achieved by exposing the individual brain specimens to only one brief chelator treatment. Repeated extraction cycles resulted in further Aβ release, up to 50% of the starting values. We limited the highest concentration of BC to 2 mm for comparison with other chelators at equimolar concentrations, because our initial data (Fig. 1) indicated that millimolar concentrations of TPEN and EGTA suppressed Aβ solubilization.Table IIConcentrations of Aβ extracted by PBS, chelator, and 8 murea treatment of AD and AC specimensAD subjectX ± S.E.123456789Total Aβ2277128015248331031 ± 9.3PBS0.2 (0.9)1.3 (1.7)0.1 (0.8)0.3 (0.4)0.9 (6.0)0.5 (2.1)0.4 (5.0)1.6 (4.8)0.6 (6.0)0.7 ± 0.2 (3.1 ± 0.8)TPEN, 0.1 mm0.6 (2.7)2.8 (1.7)0.4 (3.4)0.3 (0.4)0.8 (5.3)0.9 (3.8)0.8 (10)1.6 (4.8)0.7 (7.0)1.0 ± 0.3 (4.3 ± 0.9)TPEN, 2 mm0.3 (1.4)1.8 (2.3)0.9 (7.5)0.8 (1.0)2.0 (13)1.3 (5.4)1.2 (15)2.9 (8.8)0.5 (5.0)1.3 ± 0.3 (6.6 ± 1.7)EGTA, 0.1 mm0.3 (1.4)1.5 (1.9)0.04 (0.3)0.5 (0.6)1.1 (7.3)0.5 (2.1)0.7 (8.8)1.7 (5.2)0.4 (4.0)0.8 ± 0.2 (3.5 ± 1.0)EGTA, 2 mm0.1 (0.5)0.8 (1.0)0 (0)0 (0)0.2 (1.3)0 (0)0.1 (1.3)0.5 (1.5)0.1 (1.0)0.2 ± 0.1 (0.7 ± 0.2)BC, 0.1 mm0.14 (0.6)1.8 (2.3)0.9 (7.5)1.4 (1.8)1.2 (8.0)0.9 (3.8)1.6 (20)3.1 (9.4)0.5 (5.0)1.3 ± 0.4 (6.5 ± 1.9)BC, 2 mm0.8 (3.6)3.3 (4.3)0.8 (6.7)1.6 (2.0)1.7 (11.3)1.5 (6.3)2.3 (28.8)3.7 (11.2)1.5 (15.0)1.9 ± 0.3 (9.6 ± 2.7)AC subjectX ± S.E.12345678Total Aβ0.70.51.04.22.73.23.60.52.1 ± 0.52PBS0.17 (24)0.16 (32)0.03 (3.0)0.13 (3.0)0.18 (6.7)0.11 (3.4)0.66 (18.3)0.06 (12)0.19 ± 0.07 (12.8 ± 3.9)TPEN, 0.1 mm0.12 (17)0.17 (34)0.10 (10)0.29 (6.9)0.10 (3.7)0.10 (3.1)0.60 (16.7)0.08 (16)0.19 ± 0.07 (13.4 ± 3.7)TPEN, 2 mm0.22 (31)0.17 (37)0.10 (10)0.38 (9.0)0.26 (9.6)0.09 (2.8)1.1 (30)0.09 (18)0.30 ± 0.12 (18.4 ± 4.5)EGTA, 0.1 mm0.39 (55.7)0.22 (44)0.17 (17)0.28 (6.7)0.15 (5.5)0.12 (3.8)1.0 (27.8)0.10 (20)0.30 ± 0.1 (22.6 ± 7.0)EGTA, 2 mm0.15 (21.4)0.03 (6.0)0.03 (3.0)0 (0)0 (0)0.04 (1.25)0.2 (5.5)0 (0)0.06 ± 0.03 (4.6 ± 2.7)BC, 0.1 mm0.09 (12.9)0.15 (30)0.15 (15)0.20 (4.8)0.18 (6.7)0.08 (2.5)0.98 (27.2)0.08 (16)0.23 ± 0.11 (14.3 ± 3.7)BC, 2 mm0.03 (4.3)0.04 (8.0)0.15 (15)0.24 (5.7)0.30 (11)0.08 (2.5)1.16 (32)0.10 (20)0.26 ± 0.14 (12.3 ± 3.5)See legend of Fig. 3.

Treatment of AD specimens with chelators generated an apparent SDS-resistant Aβ dimer (immunoreactivity migrating at approximately 8.6 kDa) that was not evident when the specimen was treated with PBS alone in over 60% of cases (Fig.4 A ). Frequently, the appearance of an 8.6-kDa Aβ species was not accompanied by a proportional increase in the amount of apparent Aβ monomer (Fig.4 A ). These findings are relevant because SDS-resistant dimeric forms of Aβ purified from AD brain have been reported to possess increased neurotoxic properties (16Kuo Y.M. Emmerling M.R. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Kasunic T.C. Kirkpatrick J.B. Murdoch G.H. Ball M.J. Roher A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4077-4081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). The possibility that there is a specific metal ion-mediated abnormality of neurotoxic Aβ dimer assembly is being investigated further. We analyzed Western blots of brain extracts with antibodies that are specific for AβX-40 (G210) and AβX-42 (G211) (Fig. 4 B ), since the latter Aβ subspecies is enriched in AD amyloid plaques (17Miller D.L. Papayannopoulos I.A. Styles J. Bobin S.A. Lin Y.Y. Biemann K. Iqbal K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). We found that treatment with BC significantly increased the solubilization of both Aβ subspecies in AD samples, indicating that AβX-42, while less soluble than the more abundant AβX-40 (18Hilbich C. Kisters-Woike B. Reed J. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 460-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) is nonetheless released by chelation of Cu(I). These data indicate that there is a pool of Aβ within the affected neocortex in AD that is held in sedimentable aggregates by metal ions, likely to be Cu(I) and Zn(II), and that these aggregates are solubilized by treatment with chelators. Mg(II) and Ca(II) were found to be essential for the release of Aβ. The microanatomical site of these collections cannot be determined by our methods, but it is likely to be extracellular, since this is where Aβ deposition in AD is readily demonstrable by morphological techniques and because chelator treatment of AC tissue (possessing much less extracellular plaque deposit) did not release as much Aβ. The possibility of the artifactual combination of cellular metal ions with soluble Aβ leading to Aβ precipitation as a consequence of the tissue homogenization must also be considered. However, since the precipitated fraction of Aβ in AD neocortex is much greater than the soluble cellular pool, this possibility is unlikely to contribute substantially to the phenomenon that we have observed. Other recent observations detecting enrichment of zinc, copper, and iron in amyloid deposits by histological means (4Lovell M.A. Robertson J.D. Teesdale W.J. Campbell J.L. Markesbery W.R. J. Neurol. Sci. 1998; 158: 47-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar) support the likelihood that our observations reflect the chemical structure of Aβ assembly in amyloid deposits.

Our data support the development of chelator compounds as chemotherapeutic agents for AD. One previous clinical trial of a chelator compound, desferrioxamine, was reported to significantly arrest the progression of the disease (14Crapper-McLachlan D.R. Dalton A.J. Kruck T.P. Bell M.Y.

Desferrioxamine, like all chelators, is not perfectly specific for a particular metal ion, and although the desferrioxamine trial was thought to target Al(III), it is possible that the beneficial effect of the treatment was due to chelation of Fe(III), Cu(II), and Zn(II). Our current findings indicate that an ideal therapeutic to dissolve Aβ amyloid would involve a compound that is relatively selective for Cu(I), Zn(II), and possibly Fe(III); that does not sequester Mg(II) or Ca(II); and that coordinates metal ions in the cerebral amyloid mass but not systemically. We have recently concluded a larger study comparing soluble and insoluble Aβ in AD and AC brains and have found a significant correlation between the PBS-extractable Aβ component and disease severity. 2C. A. McLean, R. A. Cherny, F. Fraser, S. J. Fuller, M. J. Smith, K. Beyreuther, A. I. Bush, and C. L. Masters, submitted for publication. Although representing only a small portion of the total Aβ load, an approximate 3-fold difference in the levels of the most readily mobilized Aβ fraction distinguished AD from non-AD in an age-matched population. The present study suggests that 4–7-fold increases in PBS-extractable Aβ can be achieved by direct chelation. At the concentrations used, this effect is observed without apparent impact upon the solubility of other proteins. We have observed that chelator concentrations as low as 4 μm were effective at resolubilizing Aβ deposits from AD brain samples, which indicates that delivering an effective biometal-depleting compound to the amyloid load in vivo may not necessitate biologically incompatible doses. Clearly, compounds targeted to the dissolution of aggregated amyloid only have promise as therapeutic agents if the resolubilized and potentially toxic Aβ can be effectively cleared from the AD brain."

Interestingly, the over-expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) induces the expression of all of the enzymes suppressed by PUFA. This observation led us to hypothesize that PUFA coordinately inhibit lipogenic gene transcription by suppressing the expression of SREBP-1. Our initial studies revealed that the SREBP-1 and FAS mRNA contents of HepG2 cells were reduced by 20:4(n -6) in a dose-dependent manner (i.e. EC50 ∼10 μm), whereas 18:1(n -9) had no effect. Similarly, supplementing a fat-free, high glucose diet with oils rich in (n -6) or (n -3) PUFA reduced the hepatic content of precursor and nuclear SREBP-1 60 and 85%, respectively; however, PUFA had no effect on the nuclear content of upstream stimulatory factor (USF)-1. The PUFA-dependent decrease in nuclear content of mature SREBP-1 was paralleled by a 70–90% suppression in FAS gene transcription. In contrast, dietary 18:1(n -9),i.e. triolein, had no inhibitory influence on the expression of SREBP-1 or FAS. The decrease in hepatic expression of SREBP-1 and FAS associated with PUFA ingestion was mimicked by supplementing the fat-free diet with the PPARα-activator, WY 14,643. Interestingly, nuclear run-on assays revealed that changes in SREBP-1 mRNA abundance were not accompanied by changes in SREBP-1 gene transcription. These results support the concept that PUFA coordinately inhibit lipogenic gene transcription by suppressing the expression of SREBP-1 and that the PUFA regulation of SREBP-1 appears to occur at the post-transcriptional level.

Because PPARs are lipid-activated transcription factors, they have often been proposed as the “master switches” that regulate the expression of enzymes involved in lipid synthesis and degradation (19Schoonjans K.

However, several lines of evidence, including studies with PPARα knock-out mice, indicate that the PUFA suppression of lipogenic gene transcription does not directly involve PPARα (22Clarke S.D.

Despite several years of investigation, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the PUFA regulation of genes encoding enzymes of lipid synthesis remain poorly defined. Functional mapping studies have identified candidate response regions in the S14 (24Jump D.B. Clarke S.D. MacDougald O. Thelen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Acta. 1997; 1349: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), but the identity of the transcription factors affected by PUFA remain unclear. Recently, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) was identified as a transcription factor that appears to play a pivotal role in the expression of lipogenic genes (26Magana M.M. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32689-32694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 27Lopez J.M. Bennett M.K. Sanchez H.B. Rosenfeld J.M. Osborne T.F. Proc. Natl.

Chem. 1998; 273: 35299-35306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). SREBPs are transcription factors that were first isolated as a result of their properties for binding to the sterol regulatory element and conferring sterol regulation to several genes involved with cholesterol synthesis (31Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar). SREBPs are synthesized as 125-kDa precursor proteins that contain two transmembrane domains for insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (31Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain, which is a 68-kDa, helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factor (i.e. mature SREBP), is released for nuclear translocation by a sterol-dependent proteolytic cascade (31Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar). Over-expression of mature SREBP-1 in transgenic mice greatly increases the hepatic abundance for numerous lipogenic enzymes including fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (28Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 30Shimomura I. Shimano H. Korn B.S. Bashmakov Y. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35299-35306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Moreover, the nuclear abundance of SREBP-1 has been found to be reduced by fasting and greatly increased by carbohydrate refeeding (29Horton J.D. Bashmakov Y. Shimomura I. Shimano H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5987-5992Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). In addition, changes in the nuclear content of SREBP-1 resulting from starving-refeeding displayed a temporal pattern that was similar to the pattern of change oberved for fatty acid synthase gene transcription (11Blake W.L. Clarke S.D. J. Nutr. 1990; 120: 1727-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 29Horton J.D. Bashmakov Y. Shimomura I. Shimano H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5987-5992Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Further support for the role of SREBP-1 in lipogenic gene expression was demonstrated by the discovery that the region of −71 to −54 of the rat fatty acid synthase appears to contain SREBP-1 response sequences and that binding of SREBP-1 to this region enhances fatty acid synthase gene promoter activity (26Magana M.M. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32689-32694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In light of these collective data, we hypothesized that PUFA coordinately suppress the transcription of hepatic lipogenic and glycolytic genes by suppressing the expression of SREBP-1. In this report, we demonstrate that PUFA reduced the hepatic concentration of precursor and mature SREBP-1 protein and concomitantly lowered the hepatic abundance of SREBP-1 mRNA. Moreover, the reduction in SREBP-1 protein was paralleled by a comparable decrease in the transcription of hepatic fatty acid synthase. The impact of fatty acids on the hepatic expression of SREBP-1 and fatty acid synthase was examined in HepG2 cells treated with varying concentrations of albumin-bound 18:1(n -9) or 20:4(n -6) and in rats fed a high carbohydrate diet containing triolein, safflower oil, or fish oil. HepG2 cells (ATCC no. HB-8065) were plated onto dry collagen-coated tissue culture plates and maintained in minimum essential medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm pyruvate, and 10% fetal bovine serum (32Javitt N.B. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). After the cells reached confluence, serum was removed from the medium. After 48 h of serum stavation, 1 μm insulin and dexamethasone were added to the medium, and the cells (n = 4 plates per treatment) were subsequently treated with 0, 10, 50, 100, or 200 μmalbumin-bound (fatty acid/albumin molar ratio 4/1) 18:1(n -9) or 20:4(n -6) (Nu-Chek Prep) for 24 h. Total RNA was extracted for Northern analyses using phenol-guanidinium isothiocyanate (33Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). To examine the influence that dietary PUFA exert on SREBP-1 and fatty acid synthase gene expression, male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Sprague-Dawley) were adapted to a 3 h/day meal-feeding regimen (2Clarke S.D. Armstrong M.K. Jump D.B. J. Nutr. 1990; 120: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) using a high glucose, fat-free diet (Dyets). After a 7-day adaptation period, the rats were randomly assigned to dietary treatments (n = 4–5 rats per diet) that consisted of the fat-free diet; the fat-free diet supplemented (10 g/100 g of diet) with triolein (99% 18:1(n -9)), safflower oil (65% 18:2(n -6)), or sterol-free, menhaden fish oil (35% 20:5 and 22:6(n -3)); or the fat-free diet supplemented with 0.1% WY 14,643 (Chemsyn Science Labs). Following an additional 5-day feeding period, rats were killed immediately after the last 3-h meal. This dietary design was employed in three separate dietary studies. The abundance of a variety of hepatic transcripts described in the figures was determined by Northern analysis using total RNA extracted by the phenol-guanidinium isothiocyanate procedure (2Clarke S.D. Armstrong M.K. Jump D.B. J. Nutr. 1990; 120: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 33Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). The cDNA probes for hybridization were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products) using either polymerase chain reaction radiolabeling or random prime labeling (Life Technologies). Corrections for variations in RNA loading of each lane were made using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA as the reference transcript. The impact of various dietary fats on the in vivo transcription of the hepatic fatty acid synthase, SREBP-1, SREBP-2, and acyl-CoA oxidase was determined by nuclear run-on assays using nuclei isolated from the livers of rats from the various dietary treatments (11Blake W.L.

Briefly, liver was homogenized in 20 ml of Buffer A (15 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 0.15 mmspermidine, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm EGTA) containing 0.34 m sucrose. The homogenate was centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of Buffer B (Buffer A containing 1 m sucrose and 0.5% Triton X-100). The resuspended pellet was centrifuged for 10 min at 2500 ×g . The resulting pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of Buffer C (Buffer A containing 0.25 m sucrose, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100) and centrifuged for 10 min at 2500 × g . The nuclear pellet was then resuspended in nuclear storage buffer (40% glycerol, 75 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 0.15 mm spermidine, 0.5 mm spermine, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm EGTA) and the nuclei were stored at −80 °C. The trancription assay was conducted by incubating the nuclei with transcription reaction mixture for 20 min at 26 °C in a 300-μl reaction volume. The final reaction mixture contained 20% glycerol, 75 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 60 mm KCl, 15 mmNaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm spermidine, 0.5 mm spermine, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 260 units/ml RNasin (Promega), 10 μm creatine phosphate, 16 units/ml creatine kinase, 0.5 mm CTP, 0.5 mm GTP, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 μm UTP, and 100 μCi [α-32P]UTP (NEN Life Science Products). Labeled nascent RNA transcripts were extracted with organic phenol/chloroform and precipitated by ethanol. Nascent transcripts for fatty acid synthase, acyl-CoA oxidase, SREBP-1, and SREBP-2 were quantified by their hybridization to their respective cDNAs. RNA hybrids were quantified by cutting out each slot and counting the membrane slots by liquid scintillation counting. The effect of dietary fat on the membrane (precursor) and nuclear (mature) content of SREBP-1 was determined by isolating microsomal and nuclear proteins from liver freshly removed from rats fed the various types of fat described previously (36Sheng Z. Otani H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 37Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Wright M. Yao K.M. Mueller E. Solanes G. Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). To prevent proteolysis of precursor and mature SREBP-1, all buffers contained 50 μg/ml N -acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal, 24 μg/ml pefabloc, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. Briefly, liver was homogenized in 30 ml of Buffer A (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 25 mm KCl, 1 mmsodium EDTA, 2 m sucrose, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.15 mm spermine, 2 mm spermidine, and protease inhibitors). The homogenate was layered over a 10-ml cushion of Buffer A and was centrifuged in a SW-27 rotor (Beckman) at 75,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of Buffer B (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and protease inhibitors). After the addition of ammonium sulfate (4 m, pH 7.9) the suspension was centrifuged at 257,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was collected as nuclear protein extract. For membrane protein extraction, the liver was homogenized in 20 mmTris/HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mmCaCl2 plus protease inhibitors. The homogenate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Microsomal membranes were collected by centrifuging the 800 ×g supernatant for 1 h, 100,000 × g at 4 °C (SW-55 rotor, Beckman). The pellet was rinsed briefly with homogenization buffer and subsequently resuspended in 1.5 ml of 250 mm Tris/HCl (pH 6) and 2 mm CaCl2plus protease inhibitors. The membrane proteins were extracted by adding an equal volume of 2 mm CaCl2, 320 mm NaCl, 2% Triton X-100,and protease inhibitors to the membrane pellet, mixing, and subsequently centrifuging for 45 min at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. The abundance of SREBP-1 and USF-1 was determined by Western blotting (36Sheng Z. Otani H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunoreactive SREBP-1 was identified using monoclonal anti-SREBP-1 (IgG-2A4) prepared from hybridoma cells (ATCC, CRL 2121), and immunoreactive USF-1 was identified by incubating with buffer containing 0.1 μg/ml anti-USF-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Bands were quantified for relative intensity using the Ambis imaging system. The possibility that PUFA may inhibit the expression of SREBP-1 was initially examined by treating HepG2 cells with varying concentrations of 20:4(n -6). The pattern for the dose-dependent reduction in SREBP-1 and fatty acid synthase mRNA abundance elicited by 20:4(n -6) was almost identical for both transcripts (Fig. 1). Maximum reduction in SREBP-1 and fatty acid synthase mRNA occurred at approximately 50 μm. The amount of 20:4(n -6) required to achieve a 50% reduction in both SREBP-1 and fatty acid synthase mRNA was approximately 10–15 μm (Fig. 1), which is within the physiological range for the plasma unesterfied 20:4(n -6). The expression of SREBP-1 and fatty acid synthase in HepG2 cells was not inhibited by 18:1(n -9), which was consistent with numerous dietary studies showing that monounsaturated fatty acids do not suppress lipogenic gene transcription (2Clarke S.D. Armstrong M.K. Jump D.B. J. Nutr. 1990; 120: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 3Jump D.B. Clarke S.D. Thelen A. Liimatta M. J.

The suppression of SREBP-1 and fatty acid synthase expression by 20:4(n -6) was paralleled by a marked decrease in fatty acid synthase promoter activity (data not shown). To ascertain if the PUFA suppression of SREBP-1 expression extended to the intact animal, rats were fed a fat-free, high glucose diet that was supplemented with a variety of fats that varied in number and location of the double bonds. Relative to the fat-free diet, both safflower oil, which contains 65% of its fatty acid as 18:2(n -6), and sterol-free fish oil, which is rich in 20:5 and 22:6(n -3), significantly reduced the microsomal content of precursor SREBP-1 (Fig. 2,A and C ) and the nuclear content of mature SREBP-1 (Fig. 2, B and C ). On the other hand, supplementing the fat-free diet with triolein, which provided only 18:1(n -9), had no effect on the amount of either the precursor or the mature form of SREBP-1 (Fig. 2). In general, the nuclear content of SREBP-1 reflected the amount of precursor SREBP-1 (Fig. 2). However, the ingestion of cholesterol-free fish oil was associated with an 85% decrease in the nuclear content of mature SREBP-1, whereas the content of membrane-bound precursor SREBP-1 was reduced only 60% (Fig. 2). These data suggest that fish oils may impair the proteolytic release of mature SREBP-1. Neither triolein nor PUFA altered the nuclear content of USF-1 (Fig.3).Figure 3The hepatic abundance of nuclear USF-1 was unaffected by dietary (n -6) and (n -3) PUFA . The influence of dietary oils rich in (n -9), (n -6), and (n -3) fatty acids (i.e. Triolein , Safflower oil , and Fish oil , respectively) on the hepatic concentration of USF-1 was determined by Western analysis using the same nuclear protein extracts depicted in Fig. 2. A , a representative USF-1 Western (25 μg protein/lane). B , hepatic content of USF-1 relative to that observed in rats fed the fat-free diet. Data are means ± S.E.;n = 4 rats/ treatment. Similar results were observed in two separate dietary studies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The PUFA-dependent reduction in hepatic content of precursor and mature SREBP-1 was accompanied by a comparable decrease in the amount of hepatic SREBP-1 mRNA (Fig.4). Moreover, the hepatic abundance of SREBP-1 mRNA was positively correlated with the hepatic abundance of fatty acid synthase mRNA (Fig. 4). Although the PUFA suppression of lipogenic genes does not appear to directly involve a PPARα-mediated mechanism (22Clarke S.D. Jump D.B. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1997; 57: 65-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 23Ren B. Thelen A.P. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Jump D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26827-26832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), PUFA activation of hepatic PPARα could be responsible for the suppression of SREBP-1 expression. Such a mechanism would provide a unifying explanation for how PUFA induce genes of hepatic lipid oxidation and concomitantly suppress genes of lipogenesis. To examine this hypothesis, the expression of SREBP-1 was examined in rats fed the fat-free diet supplemented with WY 14,643, a potent activator of PPARα. As expected, the ingestion of WY 14,643 greatly increased the level of mRNA for the PPARα-regulated gene, peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase (Fig. 5 B ). Consistent with the possibility that PUFA suppressed SREBP-1 expression by functioning as ligand activators for PPARα, we found that the hepatic level of SREBP-1 was reduced 50% by the ingestion of the PPARα-specific activator WY 14,643 (Fig. 5 A ). Moreover, the decrease in hepatic abundance of SREBP-1 mRNA was paralleled by a significant reduction in the hepatic abundance of fatty acid synthase mRNA (Fig. 5). Nuclear run-on assays were employed to determine whether the reduction in the hepatic abundance of fatty acid synthase and SREBP-1 mRNA was accompanied by a decrease in fatty acid synthase and SREBP-1 gene transcription (TableI and Fig.6). Consistent with our earlier observations (11Blake W.L. Clarke S.D. J. Nutr. 1990; 120: 1727-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), hepatic fatty acid synthase gene transcription was markedly reduced by the ingestion of PUFA, whereas the consumption of 18:1(n -9) had no effect (Table I and Fig. 6). Interestingly, WY 14,643 suppressed fatty acid synthase gene transcription approximately 70%, which was similar to the degree of suppression associated with the consumption of safflower oil (Table I and Fig. 6). On the other hand, WY 14,643 induced the transcription of acyl-CoA oxidase severalfold. which is consistent with prior findings that ligand activation of PPARα induces peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase promoter activity (18Latruffe N. Vamecq J. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that PUFA and WY 14,643 both significantly reduced the hepatic abundance of SREBP-1 mRNA, SREBP-1 gene transcription was not suppressed by the ingestion of either PUFA or WY 14,643 (Table I and Fig. 6). Similarly, SREBP-2 gene transcription was not inhibited by either PUFA or WY 14,643 (Table Iand Fig. 6). These data suggest that PUFA and WY 14,643 may govern the level of SREBP-1 mRNA by regulating the stability of SREBP-1 and -2 transcripts.Table IEffects of dietary PUFA and WY 14,643 on hepatic gene transcription activityHepatic gene transcriptTranscription activityTrioleinSafflower oilFish oilWY 14,643SREBP-1125 ± 19118 ± 36104 ± 2296 ± 14SREBP-280 ± 20168 ± 5292 ± 1584 ± 39FAS106 ± 1634 ± 812 ± 233 ± 6AOX84 ± 14135 ± 41100 ± 211576 ± 223Nuclear run-on assays were performed to determine the influence of triolein, safflower oil, fish oil, or WY 14,643 on the transcription of SREBP-1, SREBP-2, FAS, and peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX).

Complete sequence analysis revealed no other similarities with TSP1, but identified unique signal sequences, as well as metalloprotease and disintegrin-like domains in the NH2 termini. We named these proteins METH-1 and METH-2 due to the novel combination of metalloprotease andthrombospondin domains.

To characterize these proteins functionally, we isolated full-length cDNAs, produced recombinant protein, and generated antisera to the recombinant proteins. Both METH-1 and METH-2 represent single copy genes, which encode secreted and proteolytically processed proteins. METH proteins suppressed fibroblast growth factor-2-induced vascularization in the cornea pocket assay and inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor-induced angiogenesis in the chorioallantoic membrane assay. Suppression of vessel growth in both assays was considerably greater than that mediated by either thrombospondin-1 or endostatin on a molar basis.

The region responsible for the anti-angiogenic activity has been mapped to the 385–522 amino acid region of the protein, which contains three type 1 (properdin or TSP) repeats (2Tolsma S.S. Volpert O.P. Good D.J. Frazier W.A. Polverini P.J. Bouck N. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 497-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Recombinant and proteolytic fragments containing these repeats exhibited angio-inhibitory activity in the rabbit corneal pocket and chorioallantoic membrane assays (2Tolsma S.S. Volpert O.P.

Furthermore, peptides derived from the same region induce apoptosis of endothelial cells and suppress tumor growth when injected systemically (8Guo N. Krutzsch H.C. Inman J.K. Roberts D.D.

Of the five known members of the TSP family, only TSP1 and TSP2 contain type 1 repeats, and are the only members that inhibit angiogenesis (10Volpert O.V. Tolsma S.S. Pellerin S. Feige J.-J. Chen H. Mosher D.F. Bouck N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar,11Kyriakides T.R. Zhu Y.H. Smith L.T. Bain S.D. Yang Z. Lin M.T. Danielson K.G. Iozzo R.V. LaMarca M. McKinney C.E. Ginns E.I. Bornstein P. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 140: 419-430Crossref Scopus (379) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that TSP/type 1 repeats might be present in other yet unidentified proteins, in a context that enables activity as inhibitors of capillary growth. We therefore initiated a search for novel cDNAs using the anti-angiogenic region of TSP1 as bait. The strategy led to the identification of several novel cDNAs. Two of these sequences, isolated from human heart and lung libraries, were strikingly similar to each other. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed the presence of two to three TSP repeats segregated in the carboxyl terminus and the presence of metalloprotease and disintegrin domains toward the amino-terminal end of each cDNA. This second feature resembles structural elements of the reprolysin subfamily of metalloproteases that includes ADAM (adisintegrin and metalloprotease) and snake venom metalloproteases (12Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 13Wolsberg T.G. White J.M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 340-389Google Scholar). Because of these structural features, we suggest that these genes represent chimeras between the TSP and the ADAM families of proteins. Due to the presence of bothmetalloprotease and thrombospondin domains, we have referred to them as METH-1 and METH-2. The murine homolog of METH-1 has been cloned and referred to as ADAMTS1 (14Kuno K. Kanada N. Nakashima E. Fujiki F. Ichimura F. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 556-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 15Kuno K. Lizasa H. Ohna S. Matsushima K. Genomics. 1997; 46: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Further analysis of the data base showed that a recently identified protein, pNPI (procollagenase I N-proteinase) (16Colige A. Li S. Sieron A.L. Nusgens B.V. Prockop D.J. Lapiere C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2374-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), has structural resemblance and high sequence similarity to both METH-1 and METH-2 and thus represents an additional family member. All three cDNAs encode metalloprotease (reprolysin subfamily) domains, putative disintegrin domains, and two to four TSP repeats in the carboxyl-terminal end. Four additional ESTs represent potential partial clones of additional related proteins. We therefore propose that METH-1, METH-2, pNPI, and potentially other genes belong to a unique family of proteins, which we have referred to as metallospondins. In this study, we describe the cDNA structure of human METH-1 and METH-2, characterize their pattern of expression, and provide functional evidence that the encoded proteins represent novel inhibitors of angiogenesis. We demonstrate that the proteins are proteolytically processed and secreted from cells consistent with their proposed activity as extracellular signaling factors. Recombinant METH-1 and METH-2 inhibited angiogenesis in two independent bioassays, and both proteins exhibited higher potencies of inhibition than was mediated by either TSP1 or endostatin. In addition, both proteins block endothelial cell proliferation in a reversible fashion. The mechanism of inhibition appears to be specific, since METH-1 and METH-2 do not suppress either smooth muscle or fibroblast growth. A large human cDNA data base of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) was screened for sequences homologous to the second type 1 repeat of TSP1. Several ESTs were found to encode proteins with TSP-like domains. Two clones from human heart (METH-1) and lung libraries (METH-2), respectively, were further sequenced and selected for functional analysis. The amino-terminal end of METH-1 was obtained using standard cDNA library screening and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (Marathon cDNA amplification kit, CLONTECH). The amino-terminal end of METH-2 was obtained partially by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends polymerase chain reaction and confirmed by isolation of a genomic fragment. For the genomic screen, BAC clones (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO) were initially identified by polymerase chain reaction. Positive BAC clones containing 150–200 kb of sequence were subsequently subcloned into a pGEM vector (Promega, Madison, WI) as small fragments and sequenced in both directions at either the sequencing facility core of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center or Harvard Medical School (Boston, MA), or at the Molecular Biology Core Facility of Human Genome Sciences (Rockville, MD). Total RNA was purified from cells by guanidinium-isothiocyanate extraction, as described previously (17Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was extracted using oligo(dT) linked to magnetic beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Some poly(A)+RNA blots, which include the human and fetal organs were purchased fromCLONTECH. TSP1, METH-1, and METH-2 probes corresponded to the entire human cDNAs. A 1.3-kb Pst I fragment of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) was used to normalize for loading and transfer efficiency. For Southern blots, human genomic DNA was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI) and digested with Eco RI and Pst I . In vitro translation was performed with a transcription/translation kit from Promega. pGEM vectors containing full-length METH-1 and METH-2 were initially used for transcription. The products were then introduced into a reticulocyte lysate for translation, signal cleavage, and glycosylation. Translation was performed in the presence of [35S]methionine for visualization of the protein product. Recombinant constructs for expression of His-tagged fusion proteins were generated for expression in bacteria. METH-1 nucleotides 605–1839 (from ATG) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers containing Bam HI andPst I sites and subcloned into the pRSET vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The construct was sequenced to verify frame and sequence fidelity and were then transformed into BL21 (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA). Purification was performed by affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA columns. Recombinant protein was eluted with 500 mm imidazole in phosphate-buffered saline. Fractions containing recombinant protein were dialyzed against phenol-red free DMEM and used to generate antisera. Antiserum was generated by intramuscular injection of a 1:1 mixture of recombinant protein (500 μg/ml) and Freund's adjuvant. Eight animals (five guinea pigs and three rabbits) were injected every 15 days for three cycles. After the third injection, serum was evaluated for presence of anti-METH-1 antibodies; only two of the guinea pigs showed significant titers. The antibodies recognized recombinant protein on Western blots and were able to immunoprecipitate METH-1 protein from cell extracts and recognize the protein by immunocytochemistry (data not shown). Preimmune serum was always included as control. One of the guinea pig antibodies was also able to recognize METH-2. For mammalian expression, full-length METH-1 and METH-2 cDNA were cloned into pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen). Recombinant protein was obtained by transient transfection of 293T cells using standard calcium phosphate precipitation. Upon transfection, cells were incubated for 6–16 h in serum-containing media and then switched to serum-free media for 36 h for accumulation of recombinant protein. As control, pcDNA3.1 vector alone was transiently transfected in parallel plates. Purification of the protein included 30% ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by dialysis in HS buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2, and 1 mm MgSO4). Samples were then subjected to heparin-affinity chromatography. Elution from heparin columns was achieved with HS buffer containing 550 mm NaCl. Fractions were then loaded on 5–30% sucrose gradients and spun at 48,000 rpm. Separation on sucrose gradients was assessed by Western blotting, and purity was determined by Coomassie Blue and silver nitrate staining. Swiss Webster mice were purchased from Charles River (Boston, MA) and used between 8 and 10 weeks of age for implantation of Hydron pellets. Cornea pockets were performed as described by Kenyon and colleagues (18Kenyon B.M. Voest E.E. Chen C.C. Flynn E. Folkman J. D'Amato R.J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 1625-1632PubMed Google Scholar). Generation of the pellets was as follows; a solution of 10 μg of recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) plus 1 mg of sucralfate (a gift from Dr. Joyce Bishop, Children's Hospital, Boston, ma ) were mixed with 10 μl of Hydron (200 mg/ml in ethanol; New Brunswick, NJ) and the recombinant protein of interest (concentrations in the figure legends). The suspension was then smeared onto a sterile nylon mesh square (pore size 500 μm; Tetko Inc., Briarcliff Manor, NY) and allowed to dry for 30 min. The fibers of the mesh were pulled to produce pellets of 500 μm3 that were stored at −20 °C. Uniformly sized pellets were selected under a microscope and used for the assays. Five days after pellet implantation, corneal angiogenesis was evaluated and photographed. CAM assays were performed on Leghorn chicken embryos (SPAFAS, MA) at 12–14 days of embryonic development. Matrigel (750 μg/ml), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; 250 ng/mesh) alone or mixed with TSP1, endostatin, or metallospondins, at concentrations specified in the figure legends, were placed onto nylon mesh (pore size 250 μm; Tetko Inc.) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and at 4 °C for 2 h for polymerization. Positive (Matrigel and VEGF) and negative (VEGF alone) controls were also prepared for each CAM. Polymerized meshes were placed onto the outer region of the CAM and incubated for 24 h as described (5Iruela-Arispe M.L. Dvorak H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 672-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 6Iruela-Arispe M.L. Lombardo M. Krutzsch H.C. Lawler J. Roberts D.D. Circulation. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). To visualize vessels, 400 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (100 μg/ml, Sigma) was injected in the chick blood stream. After 5–10 min of incubation, the chick was topically fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 5 min. The meshes were then dissected and mounted on slides. Fluorescence intensity was analyzed with a computer-assisted image program (NIH Image 1.59). TSP1 purified as described previously (5Iruela-Arispe M.L. Dvorak H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 672-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 6Iruela-Arispe M.L. Lombardo M. Krutzsch H.C. Lawler J. Roberts D.D. Circulation. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant endostatin was a kind gift from Dr. Vikas Sukhatme (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA) (19Dhanabal M. Ramchandran R. Volk R. Stillman I.E. Lombardo M. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Simons M. Sukhatme V.P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 189-197PubMed Google Scholar). Human dermal endothelial cells (HDEC) were isolated as described previously (20Vazquez F. Rodriguez-Manzaneque J.C.

Cells were grown on Vitrogen™-coated Petri-dishes in EBM (Clonetics, San Diego, CA) supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum, 25 μg/ml cAMP, and 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone-21-acetate and were used from passages 3 to 6. Vascular smooth muscle cells were a gift from Elaine Raines (Department of Pathology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA). Human dermal fibroblasts were isolated from neonatal foreskin by enzymatic dissociation. Both fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For proliferation assays, cells were made quiescent by incubation of confluent monolayers with phenol red-free EBM containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 48 h. Quiescent HDEC were then plated on Vitrogen™-coated 24-well plates in EBM supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% fetal calf serum, and 1 ng/ml FGF-2 in the presence or absence of the recombinant protein (for dosage, see figure legends) and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. Vascular smooth muscle and fibroblasts were incubated under the same conditions using DMEM instead of EBM. A pulse of [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/ml/well) was added during the last 4 h prior to harvesting. Cells were washed and fixed in 10% trichloroacetic acid. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine was determined by scintillation counting, as described previously (21Iruela-Arispe M.L. Sage E.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 52: 414-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was done using In-Stat (Graph Pad Software) for Macintosh. Assuming normal distributions, data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, followed by either t test for comparisons between groups, or Student-Newman-Keul's test for multiple comparisons between groups. In an effort to identify new inhibitors of angiogenesis, we screened expressed sequence tag sequences for novel cDNAs containing the anti-angiogenic motif of TSP1. Two previously unknown partial clones were found in human adult heart and lung libraries. Complete predicted amino acid sequences of both proteins is presented in Fig. 1. Analysis and comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with the GenBank, EMBL, and SwissProt data bases suggested that these genes belong to a new subfamily of metalloproteases with the highest homology to the reprolysin subfamily at their NH2-terminal domains, however, containing variable number of TSP-like motifs in their COOH-terminal end. Consequently, we named these cDNAs METH-1 and METH-2 due to the presence of metalloprotease andthrombospondin domains. During the course of this project, the mouse homologue of METH-1 was identified and named ADAMTS-1 (14Kuno K. Kanada N. Nakashima E. Fujiki F. Ichimura F. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 556-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Direct comparison of the human and mouse sequences revealed a high level of conservation (83.4% amino acid identity). Thus far no homologues for METH-2 have been identified. Interestingly, a recently identified protein named pNPI (procollagen I N-proteinase) (16Colige A. Li S. Sieron A.L. Nusgens B.V. Prockop D.J. Lapiere C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2374-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) showed a striking sequence and structural similarity to METH-1 and METH-2 (Fig. 1). As with the METH genes described here, pNPI also contains metalloprotease (reprolysin subfamily) and TSP domains. Although the sequence for pNPI is of bovine origin, sequence alignment revealed identical structural features. The amino acid identity between METH-1 and METH-2 is 51.7%, and between METH-1 or METH-2 and pNPI the homology is 33.9% and 36.3%, respectively. Sequence analysis showed that the open reading frame of METH-1 and METH-2 coded for proteins of 950 and 890 amino acids, respectively. pNPI contains a deduced 1205-amino acid sequence (Fig. 1). In all three proteins, the NH2-terminal end contains a putative signal peptide, indicating that these proteins are secreted. There are no clear transmembrane domains as deduced from the hydrophilicity plots (data not shown). Adjacent sequences in the NH2-terminal half of each coding region show motifs consistent with a zinc metalloprotease. This region can be subdivided into a prodomain, a metalloprotease domain, and a cysteine-rich region. The sequences RKKR in METH-1 and RTKR in METH-2 (double underlined in Fig. 1), localized at the boundary between the prodomain and the metalloprotease domain, are potential cleavage sites for mammalian convertases, such as furins (22Barr P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Proteolytic processing occurs in snake venom metalloproteases to yield soluble metalloproteases and disintegrins (23Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 345-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) and has also been detected in some ADAMs (13Wolsberg T.G. White J.M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 340-389Google Scholar). In fact, our results would indicate that proteolytic processing occurs in both METH-1 and METH-2 (see below). Additionally, both proteins contain a conserved Zn2+--binding site (dotted upper line in Fig. 1) that is presumed to be part of the catalytic active site, based on the conservation of certain functionally important amino acids in metalloproteinases (12Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that these proteins may be active proteases. Following the metalloprotease domain, there is a cysteine-rich region that contains two putative disintegrin loops (marked byupper arrows in Fig. 1). Disintegrin domains are found in some members of the superfamily of metalloproteases, which includes snake venom metalloproteases and ADAMs (12Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). In snake venom metalloproteases, the disintegrin region has been shown to inhibit binding of integrins to their ligands. Conversely, the ADAM-disintegrin-like domain, as part of membrane-anchored proteins, have been shown to promote rather than disrupt, cell-cell interactions (13Wolsberg T.G. White J.M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 340-389Google Scholar). All three metallospondin genes contain a variable number of TSP-like domains located in the COOH-half of the coding region. METH-1 contains one TSP domain, a spacer region, followed by two additional TSP domains. METH-2 presents a similar structure, but only one TSP domain after the spacer region (Fig.2 A ). The alignment of the TSP-like domains of METH-1 and METH-2 with those of TSP1 and TSP2 are shown in Fig. 2 B . The overall homology ranges between 19.2% and 52% amino acid identity among all the TSP repeats. The presence of 6 cysteines (C), numbered 1–6, and 2–3 tryptophans (W), labeled byasterisks , is highly conserved. Southern blots of human genomic DNA provided evidence that METH-1 and METH-2 are present as single copy genes. METH-1 and METH-2 probes revealed non-overlapping patterns in multiple restriction digests, suggesting that they are transcribed from different genes (Fig.3, and data not shown). The expression pattern of METH-1 and METH-2 was examined in human adult and fetal tissues by Northern analysis of poly(A)-enriched blots under high stringency conditions. METH-1 and METH-2 transcripts revealed single bands of 4.6 and 3.7 kb, respectively. While expression of METH-1 mRNA was seen in all tissues analyzed, abundant METH-1 mRNA expression was observed in adrenal, heart, and placenta, followed by skeletal muscle, thyroid, and stomach (Fig. 4, A andB ). Of the embryonic tissues analyzed, kidney showed the highest expression of METH-1 mRNA (Fig. 4 C ). Distribution of METH-2 mRNA was more restricted and less abundant than that of METH-1. The highest expression was seen in lung, both embryonic and adult (Fig. 4, B and C ). Interestingly, in several tissues including brain, liver, and pancreas, METH-1 and METH-2 expression do not appear to overlap. For purpose of comparison, we also assessed the expression levels of TSP1 transcripts in the same blots. Highest expression of TSP1 mRNA was seen in the adult placenta (Fig. 4). In contrast to METH-1 and METH-2, we observed relatively ubiquitous and higher levels of TSP1 transcript in the embryonic tissues examined. The cell type distribution was also studied by Northern blot analysis of poly(A) RNA (Fig. 5). METH-1 mRNA was detectable in dermal fibroblasts and at low levels in vascular smooth muscle, endometrial stromal, and in some endothelial cells. Two cancer cell lines, HeLa and G631, expressed relatively high levels of METH-1 mRNA; both cell lines are of epithelial origin. METH-2 mRNA was detected only in SW480, a colon carcinoma cell line. Expression of METH-2 appeared negligible or absent from all other cell lines and primary cell cultures analyzed (Fig. 5, A andB ). Generation of recombinant protein was initially done in bacteria. A METH-1 expression vector was generated containing an amino-terminal His tag to aid on the purification. The resulting protein coded for all METH-1 translated sequence except the prodomain. Affinity chromatography on Ni2+ beads showed an unique band of 68 kDa (Fig.6 A ). Isolation and purification was always performed under denaturing conditions, and attempts to refold the protein met with little success, probably due to a significant number or intramolecular disulfide bonds associated with the high number of cysteines. Nonetheless, the protein was used to generate antibodies. From eight animals injected, only two were able to mount an immune response and generate specific antibodies, possibly due to the high conservation across species. Both antibodies recognized recombinant METH-1 protein before and after purification on Ni2+ columns (Fig. 6 B ). The antibody was also used to evaluate expression of the protein on Western blots of cell lysates. A single band of approximately 105–110 kDa was detected in stromal fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells (Fig. 6 C ). To test the hypothesis that METH-1 and METH-2 could function as regulators of angiogenesis, we generated recombinant full-length protein in mammalian cells. Evaluation of correct reading frame and molecular mass was initially tested by in vitro translation (Fig. 7 A ). Translation of the METH-1 open reading frame revealed a 110-kDa protein, slightly higher than the size predicted by translation of the cDNA sequence. As previously indicated (15Kuno K. Lizasa H. Ohna S. Matsushima K. Genomics. 1997; 46: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), there are several putative glycosylation sites; the higher size of the protein is likely due to addition of sugar residues. Similarly, METH-2 was also slightly higher than its predicted size, showing a 98-kDa protein. Recombinant proteins were isolated from 293T supernatants under native conditions to preserve secondary structure. From analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence and published information on the murine homolog, ADAMTS-1 (15Kuno K. Lizasa H. Ohna S. Matsushima K. Genomics. 1997; 46: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we predicted that both proteins could bind to heparin and used affinity chromatography for purification. Both cell layer and conditioned media of 293T cells transfected with METH-1, METH-2, and vector control were used for purification. The molecular weight of METH-1 and METH-2 were similar to those from the reticulocyte lysate. As predicted, both proteins are secreted. Interestingly, the medium contains both full-length (110 kDa) and two processed forms of 85 and 67 kDa for METH-1, and 79 and 64 kDa for METH-2. The 85- and 79-kDa respective molecular masses agree with the predicted size for both proteins after cleavage at the consensus subtilisin site: RKKR for METH-1 and RTKR for METH-2. However, a second processing event must take pl"

We have shown that increased production of Aβ is a consequence of neuronal apoptosis, suggesting that apoptosis activates proteases involved in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing. Here, we investigate key effectors of cell death, caspases, in human neuronal apoptosis and APP processing. We find that caspase-6 is activated and responsible for neuronal apoptosis by serum deprivation. Caspase-6 activity precedes the time of commitment to neuronal apoptosis by 10 h, indicating possible activity without subsequent apoptosis. Inhibition of caspase-6 activity prevents serum deprivation-mediated increase of Aβ. Caspase-6 directly cleaves APP at the C terminus and generates a C-terminal fragment of 3 kDa (Capp3) and an Aβ-containing 6.5-kDa fragment, Capp6.5, that increases in serum-deprived neurons. A pulse-chase experiment reveals a precursor-product relationship between Capp6.5, intracellular Aβ, and secreted Aβ, indicating a potential alternate amyloidogenic pathway. Caspase-6 proenzyme is present in adult human brain tissue, and the p10 active caspase-6 fragment is detected in AD brain tissue.

Hollister R. West H. Mui S. Growdon J. Petersen R. Parisi J. Hyman B. Ann. Neurol. 1996; 41: 17-24Crossref Scopus (1139) Google Scholar, and reviewed in Ref. 2Morrison J. Hof P. Science. 1997; 278: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). In mild cases of AD, there is already a 50% loss of neurons in the entorhinal cortex, which forms the connections necessary for memory and learning between the hippocampus and the neocortex (3Gomez-Isla T. Price J. McKeel D. Morris J. Growdon J. Hyman B. J. Neurosci. 1997; 16: 4491-4500Crossref Google Scholar). Neuronal loss in AD is accompanied by the deposition of amyloid β peptide (Aβ) in senile plaques and cerebrovascular tissue and the presence of neurofibrillary tangles. Generally, Aβ deposition is considered important in AD. Increased production of an Aβ of 40 (Aβ1–40) or 42 (Aβ1–42) amino acids in length, which arises through proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), is common to all familial forms of AD whether caused by mutations of APP, presenilin I, or presenilin II genes (reviewed in Ref. 4Selkoe D. Science. 1997; 275: 630-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). The etiology of the most common sporadic form of the disease, which includes approximately 90% of AD cases, remains unknown. Whereas the pathology of sporadic cases of AD is identical to that of familial AD, the reason for increased Aβ in sporadic AD is unclear. We have previously shown that human primary neuron cultures committed to apoptosis produce 2–4-fold more Aβ than healthy neurons (5LeBlanc A.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 7837-7846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in sporadic AD, initiation of a neuronal cell death program may contribute significantly to the increased production of Aβ. It is also possible that neuronal apoptosis contributes to increased Aβ in familial AD cases because overexpression of APP, and mutations of APP or presenilin, induce neuronal cell apoptosis or vulnerability (6Yoshikawa K. Aizawa T. Hayashi Y. Nature. 1992; 359: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 7Wolozin B. Iwasaki K. Vito P. Ganjei J.K. Lacana E. Sunderland T. Zhao B. Kusiak J.W. Wasco W. D'Adamio L.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2387-2398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because Aβ is neurotoxic and induces apoptosis, the neuronal apoptosis-mediated increase in Aβ could trigger a cascade of events, leading to further initiation of neuronal cell death (11Yankner B.A. Duffy L.K. Kirschner D.A. Science. 1990; 250: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar, 12Forloni G. Chiesa R. Smiroldo S. Verga L. Salmona M. Tagliavini F. Angeretti N.

The progressive nature of neuronal cell dysfunction and death in AD individuals is consistent with an apoptotic mechanism of neuronal cell death (15Thompson C. Science. 1994; 267: 1456-1462Crossref Scopus (6205) Google Scholar). However, due to the continuous clearance of apoptotic bodies in live tissues, progressive neuronal apoptosis will unlikely yield high numbers of detectable apoptotic neurons at any time after the onset of disease (16LeBlanc A.C. Tanzi W.W.A.R. Molecular Mechanisms of Dementia. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ1996: 57-71Google Scholar). In addition, the obligate use of post-mortem brain tissue only allows evaluation of the end point of the disease and not necessarily the process by which neuronal cell death has occurred. Despite these problems in the detection of apoptotic cells in tissues, there is some evidence that apoptosis occurs in AD brains. Although terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP end labeling (TUNEL) staining, which identifies 3′-ends of DNA strands, a phenomenon resulting from DNA fragmentation in apoptotic cells, yields variable results in AD brains (17Lassmann H.

Both Jun and Fos co-localize with neurofibrillary tangle marker, PHF-1, in some neurons.

Regulator proteins of apoptosis such as Bcl-2 and Bax proteins increase in AD neurons, except in neurofibrillary tangle-positive cells (32Satou T. Cummings B.J. Cotman C.W.

A caspase-3-generated actin fragment is produced in neurons of AD brains but not in age-matched controls and strongly supports apoptosis as a key component of neuronal cell demise in AD (34Yang F. Sun X. Beech W. Teter B. Wu S. Sigel J. Frautschy S. Cole G. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 379-389PubMed Google Scholar). Caspases recognize four amino acid substrate sites as their target and cleave C-terminal to an obligatory aspartic acid (XXX D). These proteins have been subdivided in three classes based on their specific substrates: Group I (caspase-1, -4, and -5; WEHD or YVAD substrate), Group II (caspase-2, -3, -7, and -10; DEX D) and Group III (caspase-6, -8, and -9; (I,V,L)EX D) (35Thornberry N.A.

The activation of the proenzyme form of caspases is a key determinant of apoptotic function (36Alnemri E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The role of caspases in neuronal cell death is evident in developmental and injury-mediated neuronal apoptosis of the peripheral and central nervous system. Caspase-3 and possibly caspase-2 play a role in developmental neuronal cell death (37Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C.-Y. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A.

Faden A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7415-7424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, caspase activation and its role in neuronal cell death is both cell type- and signal-dependent. The increased production of Aβ in neurons committed to apoptosis (5LeBlanc A.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 7837-7846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that proteases directly involved in APP processing are activated through programmed cell death. Because caspases are well known effectors of cell death in the CNS, we investigated the potential role of caspase family members in APP metabolism and human neuronal cell death. Neurons were cultured as described previously (5LeBlanc A.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 7837-7846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Paradis E. Douillard H. Koutroumanis M. Goodyer C. LeBlanc A. J.

Briefly, brains were dissociated in trypsin, treated with deoxyribonuclease I, filtered through 130 and 70 μm nylon mesh, and plated on poly-lysine coated tissue culture flasks or multiwell plates at a density of 3 × 106 cells/ml. Neurons elaborate an extensive neuritic network within 3 days of plating and do not show any signs of neurodegeneration for approximately 4 weeks. Neurons plated on aclar coverslips were serum-deprived at ten days of culture in the absence or presence of various concentrations of caspase inhibitors Z-VAD-fmk, BOC-Asp(OMe)-fmk (BOC), Z-DEVD-fmk, and Z-IETD-fmk for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. Neurons were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.75 mm sodium citrate, and stained for apoptotic neurons by TUNEL using the Cell death Kit I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described by the manufacturer. Cells were counterstained with 100 ng/ml propidium iodide for 20 min. The number of TUNEL-positive neurons was counted over approximately 100 cells in five areas of each coverslip (minimum of 500 cells per sample). The percentage of apoptotic neurons was determined by calculating the number of TUNEL-positive neurons (green fluorescence) over the total amount of neurons (red fluorescence by propidium iodide). The IC50 was determined as the concentration of Z-DEVD-fmk inhibiting 50% of apoptosis at each time point. Duplicates of each experiment were done and the experiment was repeated on three independent cultures. Data represent the mean ± S.E. Protein from neuron cultures or AD brain tissue (see description below) were extracted in cell lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA with 0.05% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/mlN α-p -tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin as protease inhibitors; all protease inhibitors from ICN, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) on ice. Insoluble proteins were removed by centrifugation. Samples were maintained at −80 °C until assayed or assayed immediately. Caspase activity in approximately 10 μg of protein was measured on 2 μm Ac-YVAD-AFC, Ac-DEVD-AFC, Ac-VEID-AFC, or Ac-IETD-AMC as substrates (all from Bio-Mol) in caspase reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol). Release of AFC and AMC was detected in time in a Bio-Rad Fluoromark apparatus at an excitation value of 390 nm and emission of 538 nm for AFC and an excitation of 390 nm and emission 460 nm for AMC. Measurements were read every 2 min for the first 1 h and then every 10 min for 2 h to mark the linearity of the enzymatic reaction in time. A standard curve of AFC or AMC allowed conversion to nmoles of released AFC or AMC. Proteins were measured with nanoOrange (Molecular Probes) on the Fluoromark (excitation, 485; emission, 590). Results were expressed as nmoles released AFC or AMC/mg protein/min within the linear range of the response. The human adult brains obtained from the Canadian Tissue Brain Bank were chosen from previously untouched frozen tissue with low post-mortem interval and availability of age-matched tissue. The age at death of the AD case was 76 years (duration of disease, 10 years) and the age of death of non-AD controls was 83 years. Tissue was collected within 3 h post-mortem for AD and 9.5 h for non-AD. The brains had not been touched since they were frozen at autopsy, and they were kept at −70 to −80 °C. We dissected each area while keeping the tissue frozen on dry ice and immediately placed aliquots of the dissections at −80 °C. Caspase proteins were detected in total protein extracts from neuron cultures or fetal brains (10–20 μg/lane) or adult brain tissue (50 μg/lane) by Western blotting 10 μg of protein for caspase-3 (Csp-3) and 50 μg for caspase-6 after separation on a 15% polyacrylamide gel. Caspases were detected with Csp-3 polyclonal antisera p17 against CPP32 (kind gift from D. Nicholson, Merck Frosst), monoclonal antibodies (clone B93–4; Pharmingen) or polyclonal antisera (Stressgen) to caspase-6 p10 active fragment, monoclonal antibodies to caspase-8 (clone B9–2) or polyclonal caspase-9 (both from Pharmingen). Poly(A)DP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and β-actin were detected with anti-PARP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and anti-β-actin (Sigma). Immunoreactivity was detected with either alkaline phosphatase- or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The blots were developed with 0.32 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (Fisher Biotech) and 0.16 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate (Fisher Biotech) in alkaline phosphatase buffer, pH 9.5, or with chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL or NEN Life Science Products Renaissance). At 10 days of culture, neurons were serum-deprived for 12 h in the absence or presence of 5–10 μm caspase inhibitors conjugated to fmk (Enzyme Systems Products or Bio-Mol). Metabolic labeling was done in the presence or absence of the inhibitor as described previously (5LeBlanc A.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 7837-7846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47LeBlanc A. Papadopoulos M. Bélair C. Chu W. Crosato M. Powell J. Goodyer C. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1183-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, neurons were labeled with 500 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (Easy Tag, NEN Life Science Products) for 5 h. Secreted and cellular proteins were extracted in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), containing 0.05% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml TLCK, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin as protease inhibitors (all protease inhibitors from ICN) and 1× radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mmTris, pH 8.0, 0.005% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.02 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.2 μg/ml TLCK, and 0.02 μg/ml leupeptin, Sigma). Cellular APP was immunoprecipitated with anti-C21 antisera (48LeBlanc A.C. Xue R. Gambetti P. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2300-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and secreted sAPP and Aβ were immunoprecipitated with anti-N (kind gift from B. Greenberg, Cephalon) and F25276 anti-Aβ1–40 antisera (48LeBlanc A.C. Xue R. Gambetti P. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2300-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on tris-tricine gels (49Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Proteins were detected by autoradiography on BioMax or X-OMAT x-ray films (Eastman Kodak) and quantitated by phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics). Statistical significance of the difference between two groups was assessed by Student's unpairedt test. For the pulse-chase experiment, neurons were labeled for 5 h as above, and the media removed and replaced after one rinse with [35S]methionine-free media. Cellular and secreted proteins were collected at 0, 1, 2, 4, and 7 h of chase and processed for immunoprecipitation as described above. Neuronal extracts (40 μg of total protein) in caspase lysis buffer were incubated with 10 ng of recombinant caspases (caspase-3 from Bio Mol. or Pharmingen and caspase-6, -7, and -8 from Pharmingen) for 2–4 h at 37 °C. Proteins were electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P). APP was detected with monoclonal 22C11 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or anti-C21. Tau was immunodetected with R43 antisera (kind gift from H. Paudel, Dept. Neurol., McGill U.). Neurons were metabolically labeled with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 5 h, and APP695 was immunoprecipitated with anti-C21 antisera ((48)). The immunoprecipitated APP695 was retained on protein A-agarose beads and washed with caspase assay buffer. The immunoprecipitated APP695 was then incubated in caspase assay buffer with 20 ng of recombinant caspase for 2–4 h at 37 °C. Epitope mapping on APP released from caspase cleavage was done by reimmunoprecipitation of proteins with either 4G8, anti-I (kind gift from D. Selkoe, Harvard University), or anti-C21 antisera in 1× radioimmune precipitation buffer. We have previously observed a 2–4-fold increase in secreted Aβ in apoptotic human neurons (5LeBlanc A.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 7837-7846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the apoptosis-dependent proteolytic caspases are responsible for the increased production of Aβ in serum-deprived neurons (5LeBlanc A.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 7837-7846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), APP metabolism was assessed in serum-deprived neurons in the presence or absence of a caspase-3-type inhibitor, Z-DEVD-fmk, shown to be involved in neuronal cell death (37Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C.-Y. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar). Commitment of neurons to apoptosis by serum deprivation induced the production of Aβ by over 2-fold and reduced secretion of the nonamyloidogenic α-secretase-clipped APP (sAPP) by 50%, whereas cellular APP levels remained normal (Fig.1, A and B ). Serum deprivation of neurons in the presence of 10 μmZ-DEVD-fmk abolished the increased production of Aβ and decreased the amount of Aβ produced by 50% compared with untreated neurons. Low levels of intracellular Aβ paralleled the amount of secreted Aβ (not shown). Z-DEVD-fmk did not inhibit the reduced secretion of sAPP. The addition of Z-DEVD-fmk considerably reduced the level of apoptosis to 10% or less, compared with 40% in serum-deprived neurons (Fig.1 C ). The most effective concentration at 10 μmZ-DEVD-fmk limited apoptosis to approximately 5% of the culture. An IC50 of ≤0.1 μm was maintained between 24 and 96 h of serum deprivation. These results show that caspases are involved in the metabolism of APP into Aβ but not in the alternate α-secretase pathway. The inhibition of apoptosis by Z-DEVD-fmk coupled with the reduced amount of Aβ clearly indicates a crucial role for caspases in the production of Aβ and human neuronal cell death. Caspase inhibitors are usually used at ∼10 μm to inhibit cell death in cultures but only nm amounts are required for in vitro inhibition. Because caspase inhibitors have broad range specificity at high concentrations, it is possible that 10 μm Z-DEVD-fmk acts on other caspases. We directly assessed caspase activity in serum-deprived neurons with an in vitro fluorogenic assay. We measured the specific activity of caspase-1-like group I (Ac-YVAD-fmk substrate), caspase-3-like group II (Ac-DEVD-AFC substrate), and caspase-8-like group III (Ac-IETD-AMC substrate) enzymes directly in protein extracts collected at various times of serum deprivation. Surprisingly, compared with group I and group III, little group II activity was detected up to 96 h of serum deprivation (Fig. 2 A ), despite obvious activity when using recombinant caspase-3 or caspase-7 on the Ac-DEVD-AFC substrate (Fig. 2 B ). In contrast, group III activity increased significantly as a biphasic response at 1.5 and 12 h of serum deprivation. Group I activity increased also, but the basal level in non-serum-deprived neurons was already high, suggesting that it may not be significantly involved in apoptosis. In addition, group I activity was very low at 12 h of serum deprivation, the time of Aβ measurement in serum-deprived neurons. The caspase assay was validated with commercially available active recombinant caspase-3, -6, -7, and -8 (Fig. 2 B ). None of these caspases cleave Ac-YVAD-AFC. Recombinant caspase-3 prefers the Ac-DEVD-AFC and Ac-VEID-AFC substrates. Caspase-6 prefers the Ac-IETD-AMC and Ac-VEID-AFC substrates. Caspase-7 actively cleaves the Ac-DEVD-AFC substrate, and caspase-8 is not able to cleave any of these substrates efficiently. Therefore, under the conditions used for the assay, the group III activity in neuronal extracts is unlikely to be due to caspase-8 and is quite possibly due to caspase-6 or caspase-9. Caspase-9 activity was not assessed directly due to the unavailability of recombinant caspase. Because Z-DEVD-fmk inhibits cell death (Fig. 1 C ) and Aβ production in serum-deprived neurons (Fig. 1, A andB ), we verified the effect of Z-DEVD-fmk on group I and group III activity (Fig. 2 C ). Group I activity is not significantly altered by 10 μm Z-DEVD-fmk. In contrast, group III activity is significantly decreased by Z-DEVD-fmk at 12–24 h of serum deprivation, which is the time at which Aβ was measured (Fig. 1, A and B ). We therefore conclude that caspase-6 or -9 activity is likely to be responsible for increased Aβ production and apoptosis in neurons. To clearly demonstrate that caspases from group III are responsible for apoptosis of human primary neurons, we evaluated the effect of various concentrations of group III specific inhibitor, Z-IETD-fmk, on apoptosis (Fig. 3 A ). At 5, 10, 50, or 100 μm, both Z-DEVD-fmk and Z-IETD-fmk are potent inhibitors of cell death from 2 to 7 days of serum deprivation of primary cultures of human neurons. Z-IETD-fmk protects 50–60% of neurons after 2 days and 70–90% after 4 and 7 days of serum deprivation. General inhibitors, Z-VAD-fmk and BOC (not shown) are effective only at 50–100 μm concentrations by 7 days. In addition, Z-IETD-fmk prevents group III caspase activation in serum-deprived neurons (Fig. 3 B ) and serum deprivation-mediated increase in intracellular and secreted Aβ (Fig.3 C ). These results confirm the role of group III caspases on APP metabolism and neuronal cell death. Numerous caspase-3 (DXX D) and caspase-6 (VXX D) sites are present in APP695 (Fig. 4 A ). To determine whether caspases directly utilize APP as a substrate, we incubated protein extracts from neuron cultures that contain high endogenous levels of APP695 (47LeBlanc A. Papadopoulos M. Bélair C. Chu W. Crosato M. Powell J. Goodyer C. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1183-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) with commercially available active recombinant caspase-3, -6, -7, and -8. Immunoreactivity of full-length APP was observed at the expected 95–100 kDa (Fig. 4 B ). Caspase-3 and caspase-6 did not cleave full-length APP (Fig. 4 B ). In contrast, both caspase-7 and caspase-8 reduced the amount of N-terminally detected APP and abrogated immunodetection of the C terminal region of APP. The cleaved N-terminal fragments of APP are clearly detected between 19 and 28 kDa in the caspase-7 cleaved protein extracts. Specific caspase inhibitors (Ac-DEVD-CHO for caspase-7 and Ac-IETD-CHO for caspase-8) eliminated cleavage of APP. The C-terminal fragments (CTFs) generated by caspase-7 and -8 were not detected by Western blot, possibly indicating small fragments of less than 15 kDa. The lack of caspase-3 and caspase-6 act"

All family members share a tripartite structural organization, comprising an N-terminal Ena/VASP homology (EVH) 1 domain, a more divergent proline-rich central part, and a common C-terminal EVH2 region of about 160–190 amino acids. Using chemical cross-linking, sucrose gradient sedimentation, and gel filtration analyses of different truncated VASP constructs, we demonstrate that the VASP EVH2 region is both necessary and sufficient for tetramerization. Moreover, co-sedimentation and fluorescent phalloidin staining showed that the EVH2 region binds and bundles F-actin in vitro and localizes to stress fibers in transfected cells. Analysis of the functional contribution of highly conserved blocks within this region indicated that residues 259–276 of human VASP are essential for the interaction with F-actin, whereas residues 343–380 are required for tetramerization, probably via coiled-coil formation. Interactions with F-actin are enhanced by VASP tetramerization. The results demonstrate that the C-terminal EVH2 segment is not only conserved in sequence but also forms a distinct functional entity. The data suggest that the EVH2 segment represents a novel oligomerization and F-actin binding domain.

While Ena is a substrate of the Abelson tyrosine kinase (Abl) and is also genetically linked to the Abl signaling pathway (2Gertler F.B. Comer A.R. Juang J.-L. Ahern S.M. Clark M.J. Liebl E.C.

VASP phosphorylation in response to cyclic nucleotide regulating vasodilators (i.e. cAMP-elevating prostaglandins and cGMP-elevating NO donors) closely correlates with platelet inhibition and in particular with the inhibition of fibrinogen binding to the human platelet integrin αIIbβ3 (3Halbrügge M.

All Ena/VASP family members share a tripartite structural organization consisting of highly homologous N-terminal and C-terminal parts (Ena-VASP homology domains 1 and 2 (EVH1 and EVH2)) that are separated by a central proline-rich core (1Haffner C.

Moreover, distinct proline-rich motifs, which are present in multiple copies in the VASP and Mena and once in the Evl central segment, have been shown to be involved in profilin binding to VASP and Mena (7Gertler F.B.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8384-8392Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Similarly, the proline-rich central segment of Ena is also involved in profilin binding (28Ahern-Djamali S.M.

Microinjection of a profilin binding VASP peptide into Listeria -infected cells arrests bacterial motility (31Kang F. Laine R.O. Bubb M.R. Southwick F.S. Purich D.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8384-8392Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In contrast to other EVH1 domain containing proteins (32Callebaut I. Cossart P. Dehoux P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), a hallmark of all Ena/VASP family proteins is the presence of a C-terminal EVH2 region, about 160–190 amino acids in length, with a repetitive mixed charge cluster at its C-terminal end (1Haffner C. Jarchau T. Reinhard M. Hoppe J. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 13Reinhard M. Jarchau T. Reinhard K. Walter U. Kreis T. Vale R. Guidebook to the Cytoskeleton and Motor Proteins. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 168-171Google Scholar). Despite some preliminary observations, the function of the EVH2 segment has remained elusive. Thus, focal adhesion localization of human VASP lacking part of the EVH2 region (residues 285–380) was markedly affected, and association with stress fibers differed from that of the wild-type protein (1Haffner C. Jarchau T. Reinhard M. Hoppe J. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). A recessive lethal nonsense mutation of Drosophila ena leads to a truncated protein lacking the C-terminal 49 amino acids. This mutant Ena not only failed to form oligomers but was also impaired in its zyxin and Abl-SH3 domain binding ability and subcellular distribution (11Ahern-Djamali S.M. Comer A.R. Bachmann C. Kastenmeier A.S. Reddy S.K. Beckerle M.C. Walter U. Hoffmann F.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2157-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that VASP can bind to filamentous actin (F-actin) (12Reinhard M. Halbrügge M. Scheer U. Wiegand C. Jockusch B.M. Walter U. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2063-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), a function that appears also to reside within the EVH2 region, adding an additional level of complexity. Therefore, this study was initiated to define the possible role of the EVH2 segment in tetramerization and F-actin binding. Here we demonstrate that two distinct sites within the EVH2 region are essential for tetramerization and F-actin binding, respectively. We further show that an EVH2 fragment comprising both sites is required and sufficient to confer actin cross-linking activity to the protein. Constructs used for transient expression in eukaryotic cells (see Fig. 7 A as a summary) were as follows. Plasmids based on the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) were constructed to encode four different C-terminal VASP fragments encompassing the complete EVH2 region (residues 225–380) or amino acids 259–380 (containing block B, the B/C linker region l , and block C of the EVH2 region), 277–380 (essentially lacking block B), and 259–342 (essentially lacking block C), respectively. These VASP constructs (termed pcD-EVH2, pcD-Bl C, pcD-l C, and pcD-Bl ) were generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification with the human VASP cDNA as a template and the primer pairs GF-1/VASP-CR1, VASP-CF1/VASP-CR1, VASP-CF2/VASP-CR1, and VASP-CF1/VASP-CR2, respectively (see below). Upstream primers were designed for optimal expression in eukaryotic cells (33Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar), with the VASP specific sequence immediately following the start codon. Fragments were amplified by Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) and cloned into pcDNA3 Bam HI andEco RI restriction sites. Regions amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloning junctions were confirmed by sequencing. As a control, pVSV-VASP was used (6Smolenski A. Bachmann C. Reinhard K. Hönig-Liedl P. Jarchau T. Hoschuetzky H. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20029-20035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). For expression of the corresponding hexahistidine-tagged C-terminal VASP proteins in Escherichia coli (see Fig. 7 A as a summary), the respective fragments were released from pcDNA3 by digestion with Bam HI and Eco RV and cloned into the Bam HI and Sma I-sites of pQE-30 (Qiagen). The resulting plasmids pQE-EVH2, pQE-Bl C, pQE-l C, and pQE-Bl encode the corresponding VASP sequences preceded by a 14-amino acid peptide (MRGSH6GSAM). Fusion proteins were termed His-EVH2, His-Bl C, His-l C, and His-Bl, respectively. The VASP sequence and cloning junctions were confirmed by sequencing, revealing a 1-base pair deletion at the Sma I/Eco RV junction in the 3′-UTR of pQE-l C. For the construction of pQE-VASPΔC (encoding hexahistidine-tagged VASP amino acids 1–342), an N-terminal VASP fragment was amplified beyond an internal Pfl MI site with primers NF-0 and 845-R, digested with Bam HI andPfl MI, and, in a three-fragment ligation, ligated with thePfl MI/Bst EII fragment of the VASP cDNA and the Bst EII/Bam HI vector fragment of pQE-Bl . pQE-VASPΔC was constructed to encode an identical 14-amino acid peptide preceding the VASP sequence. The polymerase chain reaction primers used in this study were as follows: VASP-GF1, 5′-cgcggatccgccatgGGCCTGGCCGCAGCTATTG-3′; VASP-CF1, 5′-cgcggatccgccatgGGAGGTGGGGGACTCATG-3′; VASP-CR1, 5′-ccggaattcTCAGGGAGAACCCCGCTTCCTCAG-3′; VASP-CF2, 5′-cgcggatccgccatgGCCACGCAAGTTG-3′; VASP-CR2, 5′-ccgccgccggaattctcaCGAGTAATCACTG-3′; NF-0, 5′-cgcggatccgccatgAGCGAGACGGTCATCTGTTC-3′; 845-R 5′-CGCTGCAGCTGGGACCCCCGAAG-3′. Capital letters represent VASP coding sequence; Bam HI and Eco RI restriction sites are underlined. E. coli BL21(DE3) (34Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4842) Google Scholar) carrying the repressor plasmid pREP4 (Qiagen) were transformed with the bacterial expression vectors (see above) and grown in 2× YT medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin. Expression of the fusion proteins was induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration) to a log phase culture. Cells were harvested after overnight induction. For the purification of the highly expressed C-terminal VASP fusion proteins His-EVH2, His-Bl C, His-l C, and His-Bl , cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm NaPi, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 units/ml Trasylol®, 5 mm benzamidine, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed by sonication after incubation with lysozyme (1 mg/ml) for 30 min on ice. After incubation (30 min) with DNase (5 μg/ml) and RNase (10 μg/ml), cell debris was pelleted. The resulting supernatant was applied to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, which had been pre-equilibrated with wash buffer (50 mm NaPi, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl) supplemented with 10 mm imidazole (for the purification of His-Bl C and His-l C) or 5 mm imidazole (for the purification of His-Bl ). The matrix was washed and subsequently eluted with a step gradient of 10–500 mm imidazole in wash buffer. Proteins were dialyzed against PBS and stored at 4 °C. Because of much lower expression levels, His-VASPΔC was purified according to a modified protocol. The lysis buffer contained 50 mm NaCl and was supplemented with 5% glycerol. After cell lysis and the addition of 1 mm imidazole and 0.5% Triton X-100 (final concentrations), the respective proteins were extracted by stirring on ice for 20 min followed by centrifugation. The supernatant was adjusted to 300 mm NaCl, cleared by centrifugation, and loaded onto a HiTrap® Chelating column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), pre-equilibrated with NiSO4. The column was washed with lysis buffer containing 1 mm imidazole and eluted with a step gradient of 1–500 mm imidazole in 50 mmNaPi (pH 8.0) and 300 mm NaCl. Proteins were further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex-200 column equilibrated in PBS. Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance measurement at 205 nm (35Stoschek C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 50-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar) or by Coomassie Blue staining. In both cases, bovine serum albumin was used as a standard (A 280[1 mg/ml] = 0.66). Actin was purified from porcine skeletal muscle acetone powder essentially as described (36Jockusch B.M. Isenberg G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3005-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Actin was stored in G buffer (2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm dithioerythritol, and 0.2 mm CaCl2) at 4 °C. The actin concentration was calculated from the absorbance at 290 nm (37Gordon D.J. Yang Y.-Z. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7474-7479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). His-Bl C, His-l C, and His-Bl proteins were cross-linked in PBS at final concentrations of 70 μm and 7 μm protein. His-VASPΔC was cross-linked at a protein concentration of 10 μm. The reactions were started by the addition of 100 mm1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDAC; Molecular Probes) and 10 mm N -hydroxysulfosuccinimide (NHSS; Molecular Probes) or 500 μm ethylene glycolbis (succinimidylsuccinate) (EGS; Molecular Probes). After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, EDAC/NHSS-containing reactions were quenched by the addition of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) followed by SDS sample buffer, whereas EGS-containing samples were directly stopped by the addition of Tris-containing SDS sample buffer (pH 6.8). Equal amounts of proteins were analyzed by Tricine-SDS gel electrophoresis (38Schägger H. v. Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) followed by Coomassie Blue staining. For determination of the Stokes radii (R s), 1.2 ml of the respective protein solutions in PBS were chromatographed at concentrations of 0.1–1.5 mg/ml on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column had been pre-equilibrated with PBS and calibrated with standard proteins of known Stokes radii (see Fig. 3 A ). Runs were performed at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min and monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. Peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Gel filtration experiments under reducing conditions were performed in the presence of 15 mmdithiothreitol in protein samples and buffers. For determination of the sedimentation coefficients, sucrose gradient centrifugation was performed essentially as described by Martin and Ames (39Martin R.G. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1372-1379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using 5 ml of linear 5–20% (w/v) sucrose gradients in PBS. Each 50 μg of calibration proteins (see Fig. 3 B ), VASP proteins or VASP proteins mixed with calibration proteins as internal standards were applied in a total volume of 100 μl of PBS. After centrifugation in a Beckman SW 55 Ti rotor (4 °C; ω2t = 2.0 × 1012 rad2/s), gradients were eluted at a constant flow rate, and aliquots of 100-μl- or 200-μl fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The molecular masses of the VASP mutants were calculated from the apparent Stokes radii, the sedimentation coefficients, and the partial specific volumes vp (40Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar), estimated for each mutant from its amino acid composition (41Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids and Peptides as Ions and Dipolar Ions. Reinhold Publishing Corp., New York1943: 370-381Google Scholar). G-actin (910 μg/ml in G buffer) was allowed to polymerize for 1 h at 37 °C by the addition of 2 mm MgCl2 and 20 mm KCl (final concentrations). 5 volumes (200 μg) of the F-actin solution was mixed with 1 volume (50 μg) of the respective VASP mutant in F buffer (10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm dithioerythritol), resulting in a final KCl content of 33 mm. Where indicated, the KCl concentration was adjusted to 150 mm. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at high speed (100,000 × g at 22 °C or 4 °C for 1 h) to test for F-actin binding. The supernatants were carefully aspirated, and equivalent aliquots of the supernatants and pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. For assaying F-actin filament cross-linking by VASP mutants, samples were centrifuged at low speed (12,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h). Low speed centrifugation pellets actin filament aggregates but leaves dispersed filaments in the supernatant. “F-actin filament cross-linking” will henceforth be used as a nondiscriminating term comprising both actin filament bundle and isotropic actin filament network formation (52Otto J.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This assay is based on a protocol by Korneeva and Jockusch (42Korneeva N.L. Jockusch B.M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 71: 351-355PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Actin was induced to polymerize and the VASP mutants were incubated with F-actin under the same conditions as in the sedimentation assays (final KCl content, 33 mm). Then aliquots of the samples were applied to parafilm, covered with poly-l-lysine (200 μg/ml)-coated glass coverslips, and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The absorbed proteins were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min at 4 °C and washed with PBS, and actin filaments were stained with Alexa® 488 phalloidin (Molecular Probes). The specimens were washed with PBS, mounted in Mowiol® 4–88 solution (Hoechst) containing 2.5% (w/v) n -propylgallate, and examined with a Leitz Aristoplan microscope equipped with epifluorescence. Photographs were taken on Kodak TriX-Pan film. Transfection of PtK2cells and immunofluorescence microscopy were done essentially as described (11Ahern-Djamali S.M. Comer A.R. Bachmann C.

We transformed yeast with a series of linearized plasmids to examine the role of Pol4 (Pol IV, DNA polymerase β) in repair at a variety of end configurations. Mutation of POL4 did not impair DNA polymerase-independent religation of fully compatible ends and led to at most a 2-fold reduction in the frequency of joins that require only DNA polymerization. In contrast, the frequency of joins that also required removal of a 5′- or 3′-terminal mismatch was markedly reduced in pol4 (but not rev3 ,exo1 , apn1 , or rad1 ) yeast. In a chromosomal double strand break assay, pol4 mutation conferred a marked increase in sensitivity to HO endonuclease in arad52 background, due primarily to loss of an NHEJ event that anneals with a 3′-terminal mismatch. The NHEJ activity of Pol4 was dependent on its nucleotidyl transferase function, as well as its unique amino terminus. Paradoxically, in vitro analyses with oligonucleotide substrates demonstrated that although Pol4 fills gaps with displacement of mismatched but not matched 5′ termini, it lacks both 5′- and 3′-terminal nuclease activities. Pol4 is thus specifically recruited to perform gap-filling in an NHEJ pathway that must also involve as yet unidentified nucleases.

Unlike rDSBR, NHEJ proceeds in a template-independent fashion, with simple rejoining of broken ends. For this reason, NHEJ is more dependent on the DNA ends themselves, because many DSBs will have incompatible or damaged bases that could potentially block joining. Although it is well established that the NHEJ apparatus can resolve such obstacles through mechanisms such as terminal microhomology usage, the molecular basis of this ability is not understood.Early steps in the NHEJ reaction mechanism presumably involve formation of a stable joining complex that tolerates base incompatibilities. The Ku 70/86 heterodimer is implicated in this by virtue of its end binding function (7Chu G. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 217: 113-132PubMed Google Scholar, 8Milne G.T. Jin S. Shannon K.B.

Of these polymerases, Pol β has features that might suggest its involvement in NHEJ as well as BER, including low processivity and a preference for short strand gaps. Yeast Pol4 shares these biochemical properties, but has an additional 30 kDa of sequence of undetermined function and is not required for BER (35Prasad R. Widen S.G. Singhal R.K. Watkins J.

Rather, pol4 yeast exhibit reduced spore viability with abnormally high levels of intragenic meiotic recombination and persistent meiotic DSBs (36Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 108-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 38Leem S.H. Ropp P.A. Sugino A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3011-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These phenotypes might be explained by impaired NHEJ.We have previously used a color-based plasmid transformation assay to document that the yeast NHEJ pathway can create processed joins at compatible restriction site ends (17Wilson T.E. Grawunder U. Lieber M.R. Nature. 1997; 388: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Here, we extend the versatility of our assay to examine in detail the handling of more complex end configurations, with an emphasis on defining the role of Pol4 in NHEJ, if any. We find that like mammalian cells, yeast can efficiently execute remarkably complex NHEJ reactions, making extensive use of even very limited base pairing (microhomologies) between protruding single-stranded ends. Pol4 is indeed involved in this, a finding confirmed using chromosomal cutting assays. Surprisingly, although nucleotidyl transfer is essential to Pol4's NHEJ function, thepol4 phenotype cannot be explained by this activity alone. Rather, Pol4 is stringently required only for joins that necessitate removal of 5′- or 3′-terminal mismatches. Despite this, in vitro studies using gapped oligonucleotide substrates confirm the absence of nuclease activities in Pol4. We discuss the implications of these potentially paradoxical findings in the context of the multiple pathways of NHEJ. Eukaryotes have evolved two distinct enzymatic pathways of DNA double strand break repair (DSBR)1 to maintain genomic integrity (1Chu G. J. Biol.

Unlike rDSBR, NHEJ proceeds in a template-independent fashion, with simple rejoining of broken ends. For this reason, NHEJ is more dependent on the DNA ends themselves, because many DSBs will have incompatible or damaged bases that could potentially block joining. Although it is well established that the NHEJ apparatus can resolve such obstacles through mechanisms such as terminal microhomology usage, the molecular basis of this ability is not understood. Early steps in the NHEJ reaction mechanism presumably involve formation of a stable joining complex that tolerates base incompatibilities. The Ku 70/86 heterodimer is implicated in this by virtue of its end binding function (7Chu G. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 217: 113-132PubMed Google Scholar, 8Milne G.T. Jin S. Shannon K.B.

Ikeda J. Nature. 1997; 388: 900-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The Rad50-Mre11-Xrs2 complex is also required for NHEJ in yeast, probably at an early stage, but its precise role is unclear (8Milne G.T. Jin S. Shannon K.B. Weaver D.T. Mol. Cell.

In mammalian cells, the DNA-dependent protein kinase and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase may serve a structural role, transmit cell cycle signals, activate the joining machinery, or a combination of these (13Morrison C.

It is not clear whether XRCC4/DNA ligase IV is also involved in assembly of the joining complex, however. Least is known about the proteins that contribute processing activities during NHEJ (i.e. polymerization and nucleolysis). Mre11 has a 3′-5′ nuclease activity that can promote joining of ends in vitro , but the contribution of this activity to NHEJ in vivo remains to be established (12Haber J.E.

DNA polymerase (Pol) α (designated Pol I in yeast, where POL1 is the gene for the polymerase subunit), Pol ε (Pol II,POL2 ), and Pol δ (Pol III, POL3 ) together catalyze the essential functions of DNA replication. Pol δ and Pol ε are also involved in certain DNA repair events, notably nucleotide excision repair. Pol ζ (REV3 ) and Pol η (RAD30, 31) mediate different forms of translesion bypass synthesis in yeast. Pol β (Pol IV, POL4 ) is a 39-kDa monomeric polymerase in vertebrates that mediates base excision repair (BER) (32Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H.

Our main objective was to determine whether various types of cell cycle arrest confer resistance to apoptosis. We postulated that KC cell cycle and cell death programs are tightly regulated to ensure epidermal homeostasis. In this report, simultaneous expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (p15, p16, p21, and p27), a marker of early differentiation (keratin 1), mediators of apoptosis (caspases 3 and 8), and NF-κB were analyzed in three types of KCs. By comparing the response of proliferating, senescent, and immortalized KCs (HaCaT cells) to antiproliferative agents followed by UV exposure, we observed: 1) Normal KCs follow different pathways to abrupt cell cycle arrest; 2) KCs undergoing spontaneous replicative senescence or confluency predominantly express p16; 3) Abruptly induced growth arrest, confluency, and senescence pathways are associated with resistance to apoptosis; 4) The death-defying phenotype of KCs does not require early differentiation; 5) NF-κB is one regulator of resistance to apoptosis; and 6) HaCaT cells have undetectable p16 protein (hypermethylation of the promoter), dysfunctional NF-κB, and diminished capacity to respond to antiproliferative treatments, and they remain highly sensitive to apoptosis with cleavage of caspases 3 and 8. These data indicate that KCs (but not HaCaT cells) undergoing abruptly induced cell cycle arrest or senescence become resistant to apoptosis requiring properly regulated activation of NF-κB but not early differentiation.

J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2807-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 2Dotto P. Front. Biosciences. 1998; 3: 502-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In this life-long self-renewing process, quiescent stem cells are triggered to produce transiently amplifying cells, which then give rise to early stages of differentiation followed by terminal differentiation and death. This process is responsible for maintaining the proper cutaneous thickness and barrier function of stratified epithelium (2Dotto P. Front. Biosciences. 1998; 3: 502-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Such dynamic tissue homeostasis involving cells in the basal layer and throughout suprabasilar levels requires a delicate balance of epidermal cells entering the proliferating poolversus cells in various stages of differentiation, senescence, and death (3Haake A.R. Polakowska R.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 107-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These cellular transitions take place within a few cell layers each month over the span of several decades. Although the relationship between proliferation, replicative senescence and apoptosis has been extensively explored in dermal fibroblasts, less is known regarding these complex processes in epidermis (4Wang E. Lee M.J. Pandey S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 5Linskens M.H. Harley C.B. West M.D. Campisi J. Hayflick G.

Furthermore, because dermal fibroblasts do not undergo terminal differentiation like KCs, it is unclear whether differentiation-inducing treatments influence apoptotic-related events. To fill this experimental void, various types of skin-derived KCs were used to explore molecular mechanisms that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, senescence, and apoptosis in skin (10Campisi J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 3: 1-5Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Our working hypothesis extends observations by previous investigators who established there are multiple pathways leading to senescence and protection from apoptosis in other organ systems (4Wang E. Lee M.J. Pandey S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 5Linskens M.H. Harley C.B. West M.D. Campisi J. Hayflick G.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2997-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), and that KCs can also follow different biochemical pathways leading to cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, we postulated that these pathways will have distinctive characteristics as regards subsequent cell fate decisions such as differentiation, senescence, and susceptibility/resistance to apoptosis. The goal of this project was to begin to elucidate the phenotype and biochemical pathways regulating KC growth arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis. We postulated that there would be biochemical links between KC replication, senescence, and apoptosis and designed experiments to address how various types of KCs would respond to rapidly induced growth arrest or spontaneous replicative senescence, followed by exposure to high levels of ultraviolet radiation (UV light) that acutely triggers apoptosis. Primary KC cultures proliferate for several passages in a low calcium, serum-free medium (11Nickoloff B.J. Mitra R.S. Riser B.L. Dixit V.M. Varani J. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 132: 543-551Google Scholar). Freshly isolated, proliferating, and relatively undifferentiated KCs can become growth-arrested and subsequently follow at least five different pathways. First, if growth supplements are removed, KCs maintained in basal medium will become quiescent and remain viable for at least several days, but retain the capacity to re-enter the cell cycle (12Ruisser F. Erp P.E.J. Jongh G.J. Boezeman J.B.M. Kerkhof P.C.M. Schalkwijk J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2219-2228PubMed Google Scholar). Another distinct method for inducing reversible growth inhibition of KCs is exposure to anti-proliferative agents such as transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) (13Missero C. Calautti E. Eckner R. Chin J. Tsai L.H. Livingston D.M. Dotto G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1995; 92: 5451-5455Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). These initial two growth-arresting pathways can be reversed if quiescent cells are subsequently stimulated to re-enter the cell cycle and proliferate by addition of competence and progression factors following withdrawal of TGF-β (14Nickoloff B.J. Misra P. Morhenn V.B. Hintz R. Rosenfeld R. Dermatologica. 1988; 177: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A third pathway involves growth arrest such that no further proliferation is possible, and growth arrest does not induce early markers of diffentiation (i.e. keratin 1), such as after exposure to phorbol ester and/or interferon γ (IFN-γ) (15Sark M.W.J. Fisher D.F. Demeijer E. Vandepatte P. Backendorf C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24687-24692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (68) Google Scholar,16Saunders N. Dahler A. Jones S. Smith R. Jetten A. J. Dermatol. Sci. 1996; 13: 98-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A fourth pathway involves irreversible growth arrest and early differentiation, which occurs when extracellular calcium ion concentration is increased (17Rosenthal D.S. Steinert P.M. Ching S. Huff C.A. Johnson J. Yuspa S.H. Roop D.R. Cell Growth. Differ. 1991; 2: 107-113PubMed Google Scholar). A fifth pathway for KCs is to undergo replicative senescence, in which case they remain viable and metabolically active but not capable of any further replicative expansion (18Loughran O. Malliri A. Owens D. Gallimoe P.H. Stanley M.A. Ozanne B. Frame M.C. Parkinson E.K. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 561-568PubMed Google Scholar). The purpose of this investigation was to delineate the response of KCs to various stimuli that can influence all five potential pathways and to examine the interactive behavior of both cell cycle regulatory proteins that predominantly localize to the nucleus, with members of the caspase family that are present in the cytoplasm and regulate apoptosis (19Mitra R.S. Wrone-Smith T. Foreman K.E. Nunez G. Nickoloff B.J. Lab. Invest. 1997; 76: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar). Because NF-κB is a key transcription regulator in KCs and plays a critically important role in both regulation of the cell cycle as well as influencing cell death pathways, particular focus was directed at this transcription factor (20Beg A.A. Baltimore D.M. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar, 21Seitz C.S. Lin Q. Deng M. Khavari P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sci. 1998; 17: 167-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition to the aforementioned cell cycle arresting agents, UV light was also used because it can induce apoptosis in human skin and is regarded as an important etiological factor in development of skin cancer (23Rehemtulla A. Hamilton C.A. Chinnaiyan A.M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25783-25786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 24Aragane Y. Kulms D. Metze D. Wilkes G.

Chem. 1998; 273: 29995-30002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The death defying behavior of normal skin-derived KCs was compared with senescent KCs and immortalized HaCaT cells (26Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3493) Google Scholar, 27Fusenig N.E. Boukamp P. Mol. Carcinogen. 1998; 23: 144-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Because the orderly process of KC proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis occurs with a high degree of fidelity in skin, we postulated that the regulatory mechanisms involved in maintaining homeostasis would reveal a remarkable degree of coordination among the pathways that regulate the cell cycle (i.e. proliferation), and several key molecular participants involved in caspase cascades (i.e. cell death). Interestingly, just as KC differentiation is not required for cells to undergo apoptosis (19Mitra R.S. Wrone-Smith T. Foreman K.E. Nunez G. Nickoloff B.J. Lab. Invest. 1997; 76: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar), we observed that early stages of differentiation were not required for growth-arrested or senescent KCs to acquire an apoptotic-resistant phenotype. Because the c-myc proto-oncogene is a central regulator of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, expression of c-Myc protein levels were also examined (28Henriksson M. Luscher B. Adv.

By comparing the behavior and response of normal KCs, senescent KCs, and immortalized KCs to antiproliferative agents followed by UV light, new insights were gained into the complex interactions of molecular mediators that regulate KC proliferation, growth arrest, differentiation, senescence, and apoptosis. Primary KCs were isolated from freshly excised neonatal foreskins as described previously (11Nickoloff B.J. Mitra R.S. Riser B.L. Dixit V.M. Varani J. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 132: 543-551Google Scholar) HaCaT cells, an immortalized KC cell line, were obtained from Professor N. Fusenig (Heidelberg, Germany) (26Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3493) Google Scholar). Both normal KCs and HaCaT cells were maintained in a low calcium (0.15 mm) KC growth medium (KGM, Clonetics, San Diego, CA). Cells were treated with either KGM alone or KGM containing various treatments for 8 and 48 h. In some experiments, KGM was replaced with a basal medium (KBM) lacking growth supplements. Treatments to reduce cell proliferation included addition of recombinant IFN-γ (103 units/ml, Genentech Inc., San Francisco, CA), 12-O -tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA, 5 nmol/liter; Sigma) or transforming growth factor-β (10 ng/ml; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) or increasing the extracellular calcium ion concentration to 2.0 mm. Counting of cells was performed manually using a calibrated slide chamber hemacytometer. The caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK and IEDT were purchased from Enzyme System Products (Livermore, CA), and DEVD was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). In some experiments KCs were pre-exposed for 2 h to the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (0.1–1 μm, BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA) to inhibit NF-κB activation as described previously (30Kothny-Wilkes G. Kulms D. Poppelmann B. Luger T.A. Kubin M. Schwarz T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2925-29247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (98) Google Scholar). SW13 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. The anti-caspase-3/CPP32 antibody was used at 1:2,000 (c31720, Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), and the anti-caspase 8 and anti-poly(ADP)ribose polymerase antibodies were purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Antibody against Bcl-x was obtained from Craig Thompson (University of Chicago) and used as described previously (19Mitra R.S. Wrone-Smith T. Foreman K.E. Nunez G. Nickoloff B.J. Lab. Invest. 1997; 76: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies against p15 (sc-612R), p16 (sc-468R), p21 (sc-397R), and p27 (sc-528R) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), as were antibodies against the p50 (sc-7178) and p65 (sc-109) subunits of NF-κB, the antibody against c-Myc (clone 9E10), and the antibody against heat shock protein 27 (sc-1048). Flow cytometry was performed on single cell suspensions obtained using trypsin/EDTA as described previously (19Mitra R.S. Wrone-Smith T. Foreman K.E. Nunez G. Nickoloff B.J. Lab. Invest. 1997; 76: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, for cell cycle analysis propidium iodide staining (50 μg/ml, Sigma) was performed following the manufacturer's instructions. Also, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay positive cells were detected following fixation and staining as described previously (19Mitra R.S. Wrone-Smith T. Foreman K.E. Nunez G. Nickoloff B.J. Lab. Invest. 1997; 76: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptosis was induced by irradiating KCs with a Panelite Unit (Ultralite Enterprises, Inc., Lawrenceville, GA) equipped with four UVB bulbs (FS36T12/UVB-VH0) that have the majority of their output in the UVB range (65%), with minor output in the UVA and UVC range (34 and 1%, respectively). KCs were irradiated with dish lids removed using a dose of 25 mJ/cm2. The UV dose was monitored with an International Light Inc. (Newburyport, MA) radiometer fitted with a UVB detector. In selected experiments, cells were pretreated with caspase inhibitors for 30 min prior to irradiation as described previously (25Denning M.F. Wang Y. Nickoloff B.J. Wrone-Smith T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29995-30002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Another method for inducing apoptosis was to place a single cell suspension of KCs in KGM medium containing 1.68% methylcellulose (4000 centipoises, Sigma) for 48 h as described previously (19Mitra R.S. Wrone-Smith T. Foreman K.E. Nunez G. Nickoloff B.J. Lab. Invest. 1997; 76: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear cell lysate and whole cell lysate were prepared to detect different proteins. In brief, for nuclear lysates cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted in buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol with 0.1% Nonidet P-40), incubated in ice for 15 min, and microcentrifuged, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in buffer C (20 mm Hepes, 0.4 mNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 15 min on ice. Cells were vortexed and microcentrifuged, and the supernatant was saved and frozen at −80 °C. For the whole cell lysate, KCs were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and were incubated in ice for 15 min in CHAPS buffer (31Liles W.C. Ledbetter J.A. Waltersdoeph A.W. Klebanoff S.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 155: 2175-2184Google Scholar). Cells were microcentrifuged, and supernatants were saved and frozen at −80 °C. Protein concentration of each sample was determined by Lowry assay. 30 μg of protein were loaded on 8–12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to Immobilon-p (polyvinylidene difluoride) membrane and blocked in 5% nonfat powdered milk in TBST (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaC1, 0.01% Tween 20). The membrane was incubated with the primary antibody in 2.5% powdered milk in TBST and was washed extensively with TBST and then incubated with 1:1500 diluted anti-rabbit or mouse horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were visualized with ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to manufacturer's instruction. Loading of proteins to verify equivalent distribution of proteins in each well was confirmed by Ponceau S staining. Total cellular RNA was extracted using Trizol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The RNase protection assay was performed according to the supplier's instructions (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Briefly, human apoptosis template set hAP0–5 was labeled with [α-32P]uridine triphosphate. RNA (10 μg) and 8 × 105 cpm of labeled probes were used for hybridization, and after RNase treatment, the protected probes were resolved on a 5% sequencing. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (24Aragane Y. Kulms D. Metze D. Wilkes G. Poppelmann B. Luger T.A. Schwarz T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). In brief, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 104 cpm of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide were incubated with 5 μg of nuclear protein on ice for 30 min. The reaction mixture was separated on 4% native polyacrylamide gel, dried, and autoradiographed. The NF-κB oligonucleotide had the following sequence: 5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′. Competition analysis was performed by adding excess unlabeled oligonucleotides. For supershift experiments, 4 μg of rabbit polyclonal antibodies against p50, p65, RelB, and c-Rel (Santa Cruz) subunits of NF-κB were incubated with 5 μg of nuclear proteins for 30 min on ice, prior to the addition of 32P-labeled probe. Examination of the p16 gene in HaCaT cells was performed initially by sequence analysis of exons 1 and 2 using an automated DNA sequencer as described previously (32Timmermann S. Hinds P.W. Munger K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3445-3453Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, detection of p16 promoter methylation was performed by Southern blot analysis as described previously (33Otterson G.A. Khlief S.N. Chen W. Coxon A.B. Karge F.J. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1211-1216PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of total genomic DNA was isolated from HaCaT cells, normal KCs, and a cell line known to have p16 DNA hypermethylation (SW13). DNA was subjected to restriction endonuclease digestion with Eco RI alone or Eco RI and Sac II or Eco RI andEag I (Life Technologies, Inc.). After running on 1% agarose gel, DNA was transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. This membrane was analyzed with a genomic DNA fragment (1.1-kilobase probe) containing the promoter and exon 1 of human p16 gene as described previously (33Otterson G.A. Khlief S.N. Chen W. Coxon A.B. Karge F.J. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1211-1216PubMed Google Scholar). When neonatal foreskin-derived KCs are maintained at subconfluent density in a low calcium serum-free medium, they proliferate and are highly sensitive to induction of apoptosis by UV irradiation. A representative cell cycle profile for proliferating normal KCs is presented in Fig.1 A in which less than 1% of the cells have a sub-G0 DNA content and 5% are TUNEL-positive. Typically, proliferating KCs have 45–55% of cells in G1, 30–40% of cells in S, and 5–15% of cells in G2M. 18 h after UV irradiation (25 mJ/cm2), subconfluent KCs undergo apoptosis with over 55% of the KCs having sub-G0 DNA, and 39% becoming TUNEL-positive (Fig. 1 B ). However, if KCs become confluent and then exposed to UV (Fig. 1 C ), substantially less apoptosis (17% sub G0 DNA, 22% TUNEL-positive) is induced. If confluent KCs cultures have their growth supplements removed (i.e. washed and maintained in KBM for 24 h), the resistance to apoptosis observed for the confluent cultures is reduced, and over 70% of KCs have sub-G0 DNA and greater than 40% of the cells are TUNEL-positive after UV exposure (Fig.1 D ). To further assess the consequences of growth-arresting treatments, normal KCs at 50–60% confluence were treated for 24 h with 2 mm Ca2+, TPA, IFN-γ, or TGF-β and then washed and maintained in KGM for an additional 24 h. In this scenario, there is irreversible growth arrest for all of the treatments except TGF-β. KC cultures exposed to elevated Ca2+, TPA, IFN-γ, or TGF-β had a reduction in proliferation assessed by manual cell counting of viable cells revealing substantial reductions compared with untreated cells in KGM of 79 ± 8, 92 ± 8, 93 ± 6, and 83 ± 6%, respectively. After the pulse/wash treatments, the dishes were then exposed to UV light (25 mJ/cm2), and the KCs were examined as before. KCs pulsed/washed with Ca2+ (Fig. 1 E ) were highly resistant to UV-induced apoptosis (10% sub G0; 14% TUNEL-positive), as were KCs pulsed/washed after exposure to TPA (Fig. 1 F ) or IFN-γ (Fig. 1 G ). However, TGF-β-treated KCs were not as consistently protected as revealed by 45% sub-G0 DNA content and over 32% TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 1 H ). Resistance to apoptosis for these treatments was not unique to UV light treatment, because similar results were observed when different KC cultures treated as above with identical pulse/wash protocols were trypsinized followed by 48 h of suspension in methylcellulose (data not shown). When the results using 24 h pulse/wash were compared with 48 h of continuous exposure similar levels of protection from UV-induced apoptosis were observed, with the exception that continuous growth arrest produced by 48 h of treatment with TGF-β enhanced the resistance to apoptosis (29% sub G0; 23% TUNEL-positive) compared with the pulse/wash protocol. Interestingly, in cultures of normal KCs that underwent spontaneous replicative senescence (i.e. passages 3–5), the exposure to UV did not induce apoptosis in these subconfluent cultured cells (Fig.1 I ). Pretreatment of senescent KCs with the aforementioned growth-arresting agents did not alter this resistance to UV-induced apoptosis (data not shown). To determine whether a similar phenotypic response would occur in immortalized KCs, HaCaT cells were treated following the same protocol as described above for early passage normal human KCs. HaCaT cells were also growth-arrested by exposure to elevated Ca2+, TPA, or IFN-γ as determined by manual cell counting, although with an overall diminished antiproliferative response. Compared with untreated HaCaT cells, cultures (n = 3) exposed for 72 h to elevated Ca2+, TPA, IFN-γ, or TGF-β had reductions in cell proliferation of 38 ± 5, 31 ± 85, 68 ± 8, and 54 ± 11%, respectively. In marked contrast to growth-arrested normal KCs, none of the treatments (i.e. either pulse/wash or continuous) reduced the extent of apoptosis present in HaCaT cells after UV exposure (Fig. 2). To better view the HaCaT cultures, only cell cycle DNA profiles are presented (although similar trends in TUNEL assays were also identified; data not shown). Briefly, subconfluent HaCat cells had only approximately 3% of the cells undergoing spontaneous apoptosis (sub-G0 DNA: Fig. 2 A ), whereas after UV exposure subconfluent (Fig.2 B ) or confluent cultures (Fig. 2 C ) or cells placed in KBM (Fig. 2 D ) had markedly increased numbers of cells with sub-G0 DNA (48–58%). Pulse/wash treatments using Ca2+, TPA, IFN-γ, or TGF-β prior to UV exposure provided no protective effects (Fig. 2, E–H , respectively). Also, 48 h of continuous exposure to these antiproliferative treatments did not change the ability of UV light to induce apoptosis in the HaCaT cells (data not shown). To determine the molecular mediators involved in the UV-induced apoptosis, Western blot analysis was performed on whole cell extracts before and after UV exposure with a focus on the caspase 8, caspase 3, and poly(ADP)ribose polymerase. UV-induced apoptosis in KCs is caspase-dependent, because it can be blocked by caspase inhibitors (25Denning M.F. Wang Y. Nickoloff B.J. Wrone-Smith T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29995-30002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Because caspase 3 is a primary executioner intermediate in this apoptotic pathway, the change in caspase 3 will be highlighted (Fig. 3), although similar changes were also observed for caspase 8 and poly(ADP)ribose polymerase (data not shown). Prior to UV irradiation, proliferating normal KCs and HaCaT cells had intact caspase 3, but after UV exposure both types of cells undergoing apoptosis had proteolysis (i.e. activation) of caspase 3. Normal KCs in either a confluent state or after pretreatment/wash with Ca2+, TPA, IFN-γ, or TGF-β had less evidence of caspase 3 cleavage upon subsequent UV exposure, which correlated with diminished induction of apoptosis. HaCaT cells treated in a similar fashion had no or barely detectable intact caspase 3 levels, consistent with the induction of apoptosis under these conditions induced by UV. To determine whether HaCaT cells were capable of acquiring an apoptotic resistant phenotype, several different caspase inhibitors such as z-VAD, DEVD, and IETD, were utilized (25Denning M.F. Wang Y. Nickoloff B.J. Wrone-Smith T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29995-30002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of HaCaT cells with these compounds prior to UV exposure decreased the apoptotic response (data not shown), with concomitant prevention of the cleavage of caspase 3 (Fig. 3). Overall, the degree of protection from UV-B-induced apoptosis and extent of caspase 3 degradation using these inhibitors was similar between KCs and HaCaT cells (data not shown). Two differentiation-related proteins were measured before and after the pulse/wash or continuous treatments including keratin-1 (present in suprabasilar KCs undergoing early differentiation) and keratin-14 (detectable in basal layer KCs in vivo and relatively undifferentiated cells in culture). Over 90% of cultured normal KCs were keratin 14-positive (expect for small foci of stratified clusters of KCs), and HaCaT cells were diffusely and uniformly expressed keratin-14 (Fig. 4,upper panel ). In contrast, only rare focal clusters of keratin-1-positive normal KCs maintained in KGM were"

These cells are defective in invertase secretion and accumulate vesicles similar to those in the late <i>sec</i> mutants.

https://openalex.org/W1985735468,"Several members of the ABC family of proteins have been implicated in multidrug resistance associated with cancer therapies. A novel member of this gene family, designated pABC11, has been identified using degenerate polymerase chain reaction.

Northern blot analysis detected five transcripts that were differentially expressed in several tissue types, and the gene encoding pABC11 was mapped to chromosome 3. Confocal imaging of HEK293 cells expressing a green fluorescent protein-pABC11 construct confirmed plasma membrane localization of the fusion protein. Overexpression of pABC11 resulted in reduced labeling with the fluorochromes 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate, fluorescein diacetate, and 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5 (and-6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester but not with calcein or rhodamine derivatives, consistent with pABC11 being an anion transporter. Fluorochrome export was ATP-dependent but glutathione-independent.

Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3346) Google Scholar, 2Decottignies A. Goffeau A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Although structurally homologous, diverse biological functions have been ascribed to different members of this gene family. Some ABC proteins are involved in ion channel formation and/or regulation, such as the sulfonylurea receptors (SUR1, SUR2A, and SUR2B), which form KATPchannels (3Aguilar-Bryan L. Clement J. Gonzalez G. Kunjilwar K. Babenko A. Bryan J. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 227-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, which functions as a chloride channel (4Riordan J. Rommens J. Kerem B. Alion N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J. Drumm M. Iannuzzi M. Collins F. Tsui L. Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (5858) Google Scholar). Other members of this family are known to confer resistance to toxic substances. InSaccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cadmium resistance factor (YCF1) contributes to CdCl2, antimony and arsenic resistance and has been shown to transport the glutathione-arsenic complex (5Szczypka M. Wemmie J. Moye-Rowley W. Thiele D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22853-22857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ghosh M. Shen J. Rosen B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5001-5006Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Studies in Caenorhabditis elegans have shown that targeted inactivation of the homologue of human multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP),1 mrp-1, results in increased sensitivity to both CdCl2 and NaAsO2 (7Broeks A. Gerrard B. Allikmets R. Dean M. Plasterk R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6132-6143Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and MRP are known to be involved in the resistance of some cancerous cell lines to certain cytotoxic drugs (8Riordan J. Deuchars K. Kartner N. Alon N. Trent J. Ling V. Nature. 1985; 16: 817-819Crossref Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 9Higgins C. Callaghan R. Linton K. Rosenberg M. Ford R. Semin.

BioEssays. 1998; 20: 931-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Although these two proteins share only approximately 18% amino acid identity, they are both able to confer resistance to a broad spectrum of cytotoxic agents. There is some overlap in the substrate specificities of Pgp and MRP, although the latter has a preference for more anionic substrates, particularly glutathione conjugates (11Cole S. Deeley R. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 931-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). However, with observations that drug resistance can often occur in cells not expressing Pgp or MRP, it has become increasingly apparent that these two drug pumps alone cannot account for all of the drug resistance observed. Recently, other ABC proteins have been implicated, including BCRP in anthracycline resistance and MXR1 and MXR2 in mitoxantrone resistance (12Chen Y. Mickley L. Schwartz A. Acton E. Hwang J. Fojo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10073-10080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Doyle L. Yang W. Abruzzo L. Krogmann T. Gao Y. Rishi A. Ross D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 8-13PubMed Google Scholar). Additional members of the MRP family have also been described (15Kool M. de Haas M. Scheffer G. Scheper R. van Eijk M. Juijn J. Baas F. Borst P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3537-3547PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kool M. van der Linden M. de Haas M. Baas F. Borst P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 175-182PubMed Google Scholar), and investigations have shown that MRP2 (canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter (cMOAT)), when overexpressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, has drug export activity (17Evers R. Kool M. van Deemter L. Janssen H. Calafat J. Oomen L. Paulusma C. Oude Elferink R. Baas F. Schinkel A. Borst P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1310-1319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems that the resistance profile of a given cell line may well involve the activity of several different efflux pumps, and an understanding of the substrate specificity of candidate drug resistance genes would help to unravel the complexities of multidrug resistance.In this study, we isolated a novel member of the ABC gene family, designated pABC11, using a degenerate polymerase chain reaction strategy. During the course of our work, an almost identical sequence, MOAT-C, has been published (18Belinsky M. Bain L. Balsara B. Testa J. Kruh G. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 1735-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar); therefore, differences between the two sequences will be highlighted in this paper. Our sequence also extends that of an expressed sequence tag (277145) previously identified as an ABC protein (19Allikmets R. Gerrard B. Hutchinson A. Dean M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1649-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), which Kool et al. (15Kool M. de Haas M. Scheffer G. Scheper R. van Eijk M. Juijn J. Baas F. Borst P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3537-3547PubMed Google Scholar) termed MRP5. Examination of a panel of drug-resistant cell lines revealed that MRP5 was up-regulated in three cisplatin-resistant lines but unchanged in others, leading to the conclusion that the role of MRP5 in this kind of drug resistance is uncertain (15Kool M. de Haas M. Scheffer G. Scheper R. van Eijk M. Juijn J. Baas F. Borst P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3537-3547PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have developed a stable cell line that overexpresses pABC11 (MOAT-C/MRP5), examined the subcellular localization of the heterologous protein, and investigated whether it is able to confer resistance to cytotoxic agents. Our results demonstrate that expression of pABC11 results in increases in fluorochrome transport and resistance to certain heavy metal compounds.DISCUSSIONA novel member of the ABC family of proteins has been cloned. We predict that the initiating codon begins at nt 198 resulting in a protein of 1437 amino acids. Although the sequence surrounding this putative initiating Met, 5′-AAGAUGA-3′, is not identical to a consensus Kozak sequence, 5′-ACCAUGG-3′, the dominant purine at position −3 is present, rendering the nucleotides at positions −2, −1, and +4 less influential in determining the translational start site. Pairwise alignments indicate that this protein shares similar degrees of homology with several ABC proteins of diverse function, including SUR1, YCF1, and MRP, and that the majority of conserved residues lie within the nucleotide binding domains and the second transmembrane domain, with the NH2-terminal transmembrane domain being the most divergent portion of the protein.Although pABC11 may be closest in amino acid composition to a subgroup of ABC proteins, its mRNA expression profile is very different. For example, cMOAT expression is restricted mainly to the liver (17Evers R. Kool M. van Deemter L. Janssen H. Calafat J. Oomen L. Paulusma C. Oude Elferink R. Baas F. Schinkel A. Borst P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1310-1319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas multiple transcripts of pABC11 are observed in several tissue types. Although it has not been conclusively proven, we suspect that these multiple species arise through alternative splicing of a single gene, a phenomenon already reported for other ABC proteins, including SUR2 (35Bryan J. Aguilar-Bryan L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 36Isomoto S. Kondo C. Yamada M. Matsumoto S. Higashiguchi O. Horio Y. Matsuzawa Y. Kurachi Y. J.

Neuron. 1996; 16: 1011-1017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar), the major histocompatibility complex-encoded peptide transporter Tap2 (38Yan G. Shi L. Faustman D. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 852-859PubMed Google Scholar), MRP3 (39Fromm M. Leake B. Roden D. Wilkinson G. Kim R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and MRP (40Grant C. Kurz E. Cole S. Deeley R. Genomics. 1997; 45: 368-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Valuable but limited information can be gained from the protein sequence, mRNA tissue distribution, and homology searching with respect to the function of this novel ABC protein. Therefore, to get further insight into its function, the effect of overexpression of the protein in HEK293 cells was investigated.Overexpression of EGFP-pABC11 fusion protein did not increase resistance to a range of anticancer drugs or arsenic. However, small but statistically significant increases in resistance to CdCl2 (2.4×) and potassium antimonyl tartrate (2.9×) were seen, although it is debatable whether these increases are biologically relevant. This pattern of resistance differs from that found for overexpression of other ABC proteins. For example, with MRP (24Stride B. Grant C. Loe D. Hipfner D. Cole S. Deeley R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 344-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 41Cole S. Sparks K. Fraser K. Loe D. Grant C. Wilson G. Deeley R. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5902-5910PubMed Google Scholar), similar levels of resistance to potassium antimonyl tartrate were found, but high levels of resistance to anticancer drugs (in the range 5–25×) were also found. This suggests a difference in specificity between pABC11 and other transporters, but other possibilities must be considered. For example, does EGFP tagging affect function? We cannot answer this question for pABC11 because attempts to express untagged or His-tagged protein were unsuccessful. However, for other ABC proteins, tagging was consistent with function (42Li Z. Szczypka M. Lu Y. Thiele D. Rea P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6509-6517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 43Chang X. Hou Y. Riordan J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3369-3374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cell background is another possible variable, but the studies on MRP cited above were also done in HEK293 cells (24Stride B. Grant C. Loe D. Hipfner D. Cole S. Deeley R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 344-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These reservations on the function of overexpressed, tagged protein also apply to its subcellular localization, which may be altered relative to the native protein, as has been seen for MRP (discussed by Tommasini et al. (45Tommasini R. Evers R. Vogt E. Mornet C. Zaman G. Schinkel A. Borst P. Martinoia E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6743-6748Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar)).Our studies on fluorochrome transport also suggest that pABC11 differs in specificity from MRP and Pgp. Like MRP, EGFP-pABC11 overexpression results in reduced labeling with BCECF·AM and CMFDA (31Roelofsen H. Vos T. Schippers I. Kuipers F. Koning H. Moshage H. Jansen P. Muller M. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 46Draper M. Martell R. Levy S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar): BCECF is also a substrate for Pgp (47Homolya L. Hollo Z. Germann U. Pastan I. Gottesman M. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21493-21496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A striking observation in our study is the failure of EGFP-pABC11 to reduce labeling by calcein·AM and rhodamine derivatives, both classes of compounds being substrates for MRP and Pgp, albeit with differing efficiencies (29Feller N. Kuiper C. Lankelma J. Ruhdal J. Scheper R. Pinedo H. Broxterman H. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 72: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). For EGFP-pABC11, there was a clear structure activity relationship for fluorochrome export (Fig. 5) with an increase in size and/or positive charge resulting in decreased efflux. Like MRP (28Versantvoort C. Bagrij T. Wright K. Twentyman P. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 63: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), EGFP-pABC11 appears to have a preference for the anionic hydrolysis products of fluorochromes rather than the uncharged ester, which is preferred by Pgp (46Draper M. Martell R. Levy S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this context, it is significant that antimonyl tartrate is also an organic anion.Glutathione is necessary for transport of many substrates by MRP and its homologues (reviewed by Ishizawa et al. (48Ishikawa T. Li Z. Lu Y. Rea P. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 189-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar)) but not for calcein or BCECF (28Versantvoort C. Bagrij T. Wright K. Twentyman P. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 63: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 46Draper M. Martell R. Levy S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In our studies, BSO treatment to deplete glutathione did not affect fluorochrome transport by EGFP-pABC11 (but did inhibit activity of the constitutively expressed transporter). This shows that glutathione is not necessary for EGFP-pABC11 efflux of the fluorochromes FDA and CMFDA, but we cannot exclude the possibility that it may be required for other substrates.Although EGFP-pABC11 is functionally different from MRP, it has more in common with MRP than Pgp, as expected from the amino acid homologies. However, one final piece of evidence highlights the distinction between MRP and EGFP-pABC11. Probenecid and sulfinpyrazone are broadly reactive anion transport inhibitors that effectively block MRP when used in the mm range, but at this concentration, these compounds had minimal effect on EGFP-pABC11.In conclusion, EGFP-pABC11 is an organic anion transporter that appears to be functionally different from previously described ABC transporters. However, it must be stressed that the studies described here were performed using an overexpression system, and the next step is to see whether they can be confirmed with the native protein in a more physiological setting. The ABC gene family encodes a group of structurally related proteins typically composed of one or two transmembrane domains (containing several membrane spanning regions) and one or two nucleotide binding domains characterized by Walker motifs (A and B) and an ATP-binding cassette signature (1Higgins C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3346) Google Scholar, 2Decottignies A. Goffeau A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Although structurally homologous, diverse biological functions have been ascribed to different members of this gene family. Some ABC proteins are involved in ion channel formation and/or regulation, such as the sulfonylurea receptors (SUR1, SUR2A, and SUR2B), which form KATPchannels (3Aguilar-Bryan L. Clement J. Gonzalez G. Kunjilwar K. Babenko A. Bryan J. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 227-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, which functions as a chloride channel (4Riordan J. Rommens J. Kerem B. Alion N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J. Drumm M. Iannuzzi M. Collins F. Tsui L. Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (5858) Google Scholar). Other members of this family are known to confer resistance to toxic substances. InSaccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cadmium resistance factor (YCF1) contributes to CdCl2, antimony and arsenic resistance and has been shown to transport the glutathione-arsenic complex (5Szczypka M. Wemmie J. Moye-Rowley W. Thiele D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22853-22857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ghosh M. Shen J. Rosen B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5001-5006Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Studies in Caenorhabditis elegans have shown that targeted inactivation of the homologue of human multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP),1 mrp-1, results in increased sensitivity to both CdCl2 and NaAsO2 (7Broeks A. Gerrard B. Allikmets R. Dean M. Plasterk R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6132-6143Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and MRP are known to be involved in the resistance of some cancerous cell lines to certain cytotoxic drugs (8Riordan J. Deuchars K. Kartner N. Alon N. Trent J. Ling V. Nature. 1985; 16: 817-819Crossref Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 9Higgins C. Callaghan R. Linton K. Rosenberg M. Ford R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 10Higgins C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 11Cole S. Deeley R. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 931-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Although these two proteins share only approximately 18% amino acid identity, they are both able to confer resistance to a broad spectrum of cytotoxic agents. There is some overlap in the substrate specificities of Pgp and MRP, although the latter has a preference for more anionic substrates, particularly glutathione conjugates (11Cole S. Deeley R. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 931-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). However, with observations that drug resistance can often occur in cells not expressing Pgp or MRP, it has become increasingly apparent that these two drug pumps alone cannot account for all of the drug resistance observed. Recently, other ABC proteins have been implicated, including BCRP in anthracycline resistance and MXR1 and MXR2 in mitoxantrone resistance (12Chen Y. Mickley L. Schwartz A. Acton E. Hwang J. Fojo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10073-10080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Doyle L. Yang W. Abruzzo L. Krogmann T. Gao Y. Rishi A. Ross D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 8-13PubMed Google Scholar). Additional members of the MRP family have also been described (15Kool M. de Haas M. Scheffer G. Scheper R. van Eijk M. Juijn J. Baas F. Borst P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3537-3547PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kool M. van der Linden M. de Haas M. Baas F. Borst P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 175-182PubMed Google Scholar), and investigations have shown that MRP2 (canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter (cMOAT)), when overexpressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, has drug export activity (17Evers R. Kool M. van Deemter L. Janssen H. Calafat J. Oomen L. Paulusma C. Oude Elferink R. Baas F. Schinkel A. Borst P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1310-1319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems that the resistance profile of a given cell line may well involve the activity of several different efflux pumps, and an understanding of the substrate specificity of candidate drug resistance genes would help to unravel the complexities of multidrug resistance. In this study, we isolated a novel member of the ABC gene family, designated pABC11, using a degenerate polymerase chain reaction strategy. During the course of our work, an almost identical sequence, MOAT-C, has been published (18Belinsky M. Bain L. Balsara B. Testa J. Kruh G. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 1735-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar); therefore, differences between the two sequences will be highlighted in this paper. Our sequence also extends that of an expressed sequence tag (277145) previously identified as an ABC protein (19Allikmets R. Gerrard B. Hutchinson A. Dean M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1649-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), which Kool et al. (15Kool M. de Haas M. Scheffer G. Scheper R. van Eijk M. Juijn J. Baas F. Borst P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3537-3547PubMed Google Scholar) termed MRP5. Examination of a panel of drug-resistant cell lines revealed that MRP5 was up-regulated in three cisplatin-resistant lines but unchanged in others, leading to the conclusion that the role of MRP5 in this kind of drug resistance is uncertain (15Kool M. de Haas M. Scheffer G. Scheper R. van Eijk M. Juijn J. Baas F. Borst P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3537-3547PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have developed a stable cell line that overexpresses pABC11 (MOAT-C/MRP5), examined the subcellular localization of the heterologous protein, and investigated whether it is able to confer resistance to cytotoxic agents. Our results demonstrate that expression of pABC11 results in increases in fluorochrome transport and resistance to certain heavy metal compounds.

This pattern of resistance differs from that found for overexpression of other ABC proteins. For example, with MRP (24Stride B. Grant C. Loe D. Hipfner D. Cole S. Deeley R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 344-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 41Cole S. Sparks K. Fraser K. Loe D. Grant C. Wilson G. Deeley R. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5902-5910PubMed Google Scholar), similar levels of resistance to potassium antimonyl tartrate were found, but high levels of resistance to anticancer drugs (in the range 5–25×) were also found. This suggests a difference in specificity between pABC11 and other transporters, but other possibilities must be considered. For example, does EGFP tagging affect function? We cannot answer this question for pABC11 because attempts to express untagged or His-tagged protein were unsuccessful. However, for other ABC proteins, tagging was consistent with function (42Li Z. Szczypka M. Lu Y. Thiele D. Rea P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6509-6517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 43Chang X. Hou Y. Riordan J. J. Biol.

Cell background is another possible variable, but the studies on MRP cited above were also done in HEK293 cells (24Stride B. Grant C. Loe D. Hipfner D. Cole S. Deeley R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 344-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These reservations on the function of overexpressed, tagged protein also apply to its subcellular localization, which may be altered relative to the native protein, as has been seen for MRP (discussed by Tommasini et al. (45Tommasini R. Evers R. Vogt E. Mornet C. Zaman G. Schinkel A. Borst P. Martinoia E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6743-6748Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar)). Our studies on fluorochrome transport also suggest that pABC11 differs in specificity from MRP and Pgp. Like MRP, EGFP-pABC11 overexpression results in reduced labeling with BCECF·AM and CMFDA (31Roelofsen H. Vos T. Schippers I. Kuipers F. Koning H. Moshage H. Jansen P. Muller M. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 46Draper M. Martell R. Levy S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar): BCECF is also a substrate for Pgp (47Homolya L. Hollo Z. Germann U. Pastan I. Gottesman M. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21493-21496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A striking observation in our study is the failure of EGFP-pABC11 to reduce labeling by calcein·AM and rhodamine derivatives, both classes of compounds being substrates for MRP and Pgp, albeit with differing efficiencies (29Feller N. Kuiper C. Lankelma J. Ruhdal J. Scheper R. Pinedo H. Broxterman H. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 72: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). For EGFP-pABC11, there was a clear structure activity relationship for fluorochrome export (Fig. 5) with an increase in size and/or positive charge resulting in decreased efflux. Like MRP (28Versantvoort C. Bagrij T. Wright K. Twentyman P. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 63: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), EGFP-pABC11 appears to have a preference for the anionic hydrolysis products of fluorochromes rather than the uncharged ester, which is preferred by Pgp (46Draper M. Martell R. Levy S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this context, it is significant that antimonyl tartrate is also an organic anion. Glutathione is necessary for transport of many substrates by MRP and its homologues (reviewed by Ishizawa et al. (48Ishikawa T. Li Z. Lu Y. Rea P. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 189-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar)) but not for calcein or BCECF (28Versantvoort C. Bagrij T. Wright K. Twentyman P. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 63: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 46Draper M. Martell R. Levy S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In our studies, BSO treatment to deplete glutathione did not affect fluorochrome transport by EGFP-pABC11 (but did inhibit activity of the constitutively expressed transporter). This shows that glutathione is not necessary for EGFP-pABC11 efflux of the fluorochromes FDA and CMFDA, but we cannot exclude the possibility that it may be required for other substrates. Although EGFP-pABC11 is functionally different from MRP, it has more in common with MRP than Pgp, as expected from the amino acid homologies. However, one final piece of evidence highlights the distinction between MRP and EGFP-pABC11. Probenecid and sulfinpyrazone are broadly reactive anion transport inhibitors that effectively block MRP when used in the mm range, but at this concentration, these compounds had minimal effect on EGFP-pABC11. In conclusion, EGFP-pABC11 is an organic anion transporter that appears to be functionally different from previously described ABC transporters. However, it must be stressed that the studies described here were performed using an overexpression system, and the next step is to see whether they can be confirmed with the native protein in a more physiological setting.

The effects of hypoxia on the stress- and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways were studied in PC12 cells. Exposure to moderate hypoxia (5% O2) progressively stimulated phosphorylation and activation of p38γ in particular, and also p38α, two stress-activated protein kinases. In contrast, hypoxia had no effect on enzyme activity of p38β, p38β2, p38δ, or on c-Jun N-terminal kinase, another stress-activated protein kinase. Prolonged hypoxia also induced phosphorylation and activation of p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase, although this activation was modest compared with nerve growth factor- and ultraviolet light-induced activation. Hypoxia also dramatically down-regulated immunoreactivity of cyclin D1, a gene that is known to be regulated negatively by p38 at the level of gene expression (Lavoie, J. N., L'Allemain, G., Brunet, A., Muller, R., and Pouyssegur, J. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 20608–20616). This effect was partially blocked by SB203580, an inhibitor of p38α but not p38γ. Overexpression of a kinase-inactive form of p38γ was also able to reverse in part the effect of hypoxia on cyclin D1 levels, suggesting that p38α and p38γ converge to regulate cyclin D1 during hypoxia. These studies demonstrate that an extremely typical physiological stress (hypoxia) causes selective activation of specific p38 signaling elements; and they also identify a downstream target of these pathways.

Even brief periods of oxygen deprivation (hypoxia/ischemia) can result in profound cellular and tissue damage. Thus, it is vital that organisms meet changes in O2 tension with appropriate cellular adaptations; however, the specific intracellular pathways by which this occurs are not well delineated. The stress- and mitogen-activated protein kinase (SAPK1 and MAPK) pathways play a critical role in responding to cellular stress and promoting cell growth and survival (1Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar, 2Su B. Karin M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 8: 402-411Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the effect of hypoxia on the SAPK and MAPK signaling pathways.SAPKs and MAPKs are the downstream components of three-member protein kinase modules (3Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). Five homologous subfamilies of these kinases have been identified, and the three major families include p38/SAPK2/RK, JNK/SAPK, and p42/p44 MAPKs/ERKs (1Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe B. Johnson G.L.

In general, the stress-activated protein kinases (p38 and JNK) are activated primarily by noxious environmental stimuli such as ultraviolet light, osmotic stress, inflammatory cytokines, and inhibition of protein synthesis (7Hibi M.

However, increasing evidence suggests that, at least under certain conditions, these pathways can also be activated by mitogenic and neurotrophic factors (11Logan S.K. Falaska M. Hu P. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5784-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 12Xing J. Kornhauser J.M. Xia Z. Thiele E.A. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell.

Thus, we hypothesized that hypoxia, a prevalent physiological stressor in many disease states, may regulate the activity of the SAPK and MAPK signaling pathways.The pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 is a catecholaminergic, excitable cell type that has been used widely as an in vitro model for neural cells (15Green S.H. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1995; 7: 222-237Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Upon prolonged exposure to nerve growth factor (NGF), PC12 cells decrease proliferation and extend neurite-like processes (15Green S.H. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1995; 7: 222-237Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that PC12 cells are an O2-sensitive cell type that provides a useful system to study the effects of hypoxia on catecholaminergic gene expression (16Czyzk-Krzeska M.F.

Brain Res. 1995; 697: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). PC12 cells are exquisitely sensitive to hypoxia in that very small reductions in atmospheric O2 (from 21 to 15% O2) dramatically induce tyrosine hydroxylase gene expression and mRNA stability (16Czyzk-Krzeska M.F.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23774-23779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Hypoxia also induces activation of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and c-fos transcription factors in this cell type (17Norris M.L. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23774-23779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 20Beitner-Johnson D. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol.

Brain Res. 1995; 697: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, PC12 cells tolerate moderate hypoxia well in that they maintain greater than 95% cell viability for up to 72 h of exposure to hypoxia (5% O2, ∼50 mm Hg) (22Beitner-Johnson D. Leibold J. Millhorn D.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 241: 61-68Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Finally, PC12 cells also express hypoxia-regulated ion channels, as shown by the finding that PC12 cells depolarize during hypoxia via an oxygen-regulated K+ current (23Zhu W.H. Conforti L. Czyzk-Krzeska M.F. Millhorn D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 40: C658-C665Crossref Google Scholar, 24Conforti L. Millhorn D.E. J.

Thus, this cell type is an ideal system in which to study regulation of intracellular signaling systems by hypoxia.In the current studies, we have used this cell line to investigate the effect of hypoxia on the SAPK and MAPK signaling pathways. We show that hypoxia selectively activates the p38γ and p38α isoforms of the p38 pathway in this cell type. The p38γ subtype in particular is most strongly targeted by hypoxia. Furthermore, we identify cyclin D1, a gene that has been shown previously to be regulated by p38 (27Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Muller R. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20608-20616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar), as a downstream target of hypoxia-induced activation of both p38 and p38γ.RESULTSHypoxia is an extremely common physiological stressor. To investigate the effects of hypoxia on the stress- and mitogen-activated signaling pathways, PC12 cells were exposed to 5% O2 for various times, between 20 min and 6 h. Whole cell lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then immunoblotted with an antibody specific for Thr180/Tyr182-phosphorylated p38α. Phosphorylation at these sites is both necessary and sufficient for enzymatic activation of p38α (5Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2038) Google Scholar). It can be seen in Fig.1 A that exposure to hypoxia progressively induced phospho-p38 immunoreactivity in two closely migrating bands. Phospho-p38 blots were then stripped and reblotted with an antibody that equally recognizes phospho- and dephospho-p38α (i.e. total p38α). Fig. 1 B shows that thelower phospho-p38 immunoreactive protein shown in Fig.1 A corresponded to p38α, as determined by alignment of films using luminescent markers affixed directly to the blot. As shown in Fig. 1 B , hypoxia did not alter the total amount of p38α protein. Of the time points examined, maximal hypoxia-induced phosphorylation of p38α occurred at 6 h, where there was an average 4.5-fold increase in p38α phosphoimmunoreactivity (Fig.1 C ). The upper phospho-p38 immunoreactive band was identified as the p38γ isoform, as described below. Phosphoimmunoreactivity of p38γ was increased more strongly by hypoxia, with an average of 12.7-fold increase over control levels by a 6-h exposure to hypoxia (Fig. 1 C ). These results suggest that both p38α and p38γ are activated by hypoxia. Phosphorylation of p38α and p38γ declined somewhat but was still elevated above control levels up to 24-h exposure to hypoxia (data not shown).The upper phospho-p38 immunoreactive band shown in Fig. 1 A was identified as p38γ by stripping and reblotting with a specific antibody raised against full-length recombinant p38γ (28Li Z. Jiang Y. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), an isoform of p38 also known as ERK6 and SAPK3 (32Lechner C. Zahalka M.A. Giot J.F. Moller N.P.H. Ullrich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4355-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 33Mertens S. Craxton M. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Alignment of the resulting films showed that p38γ comigrated exactly with the upper phospho-p38 immunoreactive protein (data not shown). Although p38β and p38δ were also expressed in PC12 cells, neither of these proteins comigrated with p38γ, as determined using specific antibodies for the p38β and p38δ subtypes (data not shown).To characterize further the effects of hypoxia on p38 enzyme activity, PC12 cells were transfected with FLAG epitope-tagged versions of p38α, p38β, p38β2, p38γ, or p38δ. Cells were then exposed to either normoxia (21% O2) or hypoxia (5% O2, 6 h). The various kinases were then immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody, and immune complex kinase assays were performed, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig.2 A , hypoxia stimulated both p38α and p38γ enzyme activity. In contrast to these results, hypoxia did not significantly alter p38β, p38β2, or p38δ enzyme activity. Hypoxia-induced changes in enzyme activity were not the result of differences in transfection efficiency as cell lysates blotted with anti-FLAG show equal amounts of the transfected protein (Fig. 2 B ). It can be seen that the effect of hypoxia on the p38γ isoform is by far the most robust (average 5.9-fold activation, Fig. 2 C ).Figure 2Effect of hypoxia on enzyme activity of the various p38 isoforms. PC12 cells were transfected with FLAG-p38α, FLAG-p38β, FLAG-p38β2, FLAG-p38γ, FLAG-p38δ, or the pCDNA3 vector. After 48 h, cells were exposed to either control conditions (C , 21% O2) or hypoxia (H , 5% O2, 6 h). Panel A , enzyme activity of various p38 isoforms was determined in immune complex kinase assays by the amount of 32P incorporation into myelin basic protein (mbp ) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Panel B , whole cell lysates were immunoblotted for FLAG as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Panel C , protein kinase activity of the various p38 isoforms after exposure to normoxia (black bars ) or hypoxia (shaded bars ) is expressed as average percent of control ± S.E. and represents six to nine dishes in each group, performed in at least two separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next evaluated the effect of hypoxia on JNK, another SAPK. PC12 cells were exposed to hypoxia for various times, from 20 min to 6 h, and JNK enzyme activity was measured in an immune complex kinase assay, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Unlike its effects on p38, hypoxia did not alter JNK enzyme activity significantly, whereas exposure of cells to UV light increased JNK activity markedly (Fig. 3).Figure 3Lack of effect of hypoxia on JNK activity. PC12 cells were exposed to either hypoxia (5% O2) for various times between 0 and 6 h, as indicated, or to 300 J/m2 UV light for 30 min. JNK was immunoprecipitated by the addition of 1 μg of anti-JNK1 polyclonal antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” JNK enzyme activity was determined in an immune complex kinase assay by the amount of 32P incorporation into c-Jun as quantified by PhosphorImager. Similar results were found in three separate experiments representing three dishes in each group.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine the effect of hypoxia on p42/p44 MAPK, PC12 cells were again exposed to either normoxia (21% O2) or hypoxia (5% O2) for various times, between 20 min and 6 h. Samples of whole cell lysates were immunoblotted with either an antibody specific for tyrosine-phosphorylated (activated) p42/p44 MAPK or an antibody that equally recognizes phospho- and dephospho-p42/p44 MAPK (total MAPK). Hypoxia had no significant effect on the levels of phospho-p42/p44 MAPK at the earliest time points studied. However, exposure to hypoxia for 6 h caused an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK (Fig. 4,A and C ). The total amount of p42/p44 MAPK was not affected by hypoxia, as shown in Fig. 4 B . MAPK enzyme activity was measured directly by immune complex kinase assay. Fig.4 C shows that p42 MAPK enzyme activity, like the MAPK phosphorylation state, increased after 6 h of hypoxia. To compare the effects of hypoxia with the prototypical activators of MAPK, we also evaluated p42/p44 MAPK phosphorylation in response to NGF and UV light. In contrast to the rather modest effect of hypoxia, these stimuli caused a robust phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK (Fig.4 D ).Figure 4Hypoxia modestly activates p42/p44 MAPK .PC12 cells were exposed to hypoxia (5% O2) for various times between 0 and 6 h, as indicated.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar); however, very little is known about the specific genes that are regulated in response to activation of the p38 pathways. The cyclin D1 gene is one known target of p38, as Lavoie et al. (27Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Muller R. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol.

We therefore tested whether hypoxia regulated cyclin D1 levels in PC12 cells. We found that exposure to hypoxia (0, 3, 6, or 24 h at 5% O2) progressively down-regulated cyclin D1 levels, with an 81% decrease of cyclin D1 from control levels observed at 24 h (Table I). Pretreatment of cells with SB203580, a relatively selective inhibitor of p38 (43Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C.

These results are expressed quantitatively in Fig. 5 B , where it can be seen that pretreatment with SB203580 resulted in a partial, but statistically significant, recovery of cyclin D1 toward control levels. The inhibitory effect of SB203580 on hypoxic regulation of cyclin D1 was observed at low doses (0.3–1 μm) as was its inhibitory effect on anisomycin-activated MAPKAP kinase-2. MAPKAP kinase-2 is a protein kinase that is specifically phosphorylated and activated by the p38 family of protein kinases (Fig. 5 C ). The fact that SB203580 only partially reversed the effects of hypoxia may be because this drug does not inhibit the p38γ isoform (45Cuenda A. Cohen P. Buee-Scherrer V. Goedert M.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). Our finding that hypoxia induces a down-regulation of cyclin D1 suggested that hypoxia may cause cells to accumulate in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. We therefore evaluated the relative percentage of cells in the various phases of the cell cycle in PC12 cells that were exposed to either normoxia or hypoxia for 24 h. Cells were stained with propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry. It can be seen in Fig. 5 D that hypoxia caused a 17.4% increase in the number of cells in G0/G1. Furthermore, pretreatment with SB203580 followed by a 24-h exposure to hypoxia was able to reverse in part this accumulation in G0/G1.Our results show that hypoxia activates both p38α and p38γ; however, the p38γ isoform is insensitive to inhibition by SB203580 (45Cuenda A.

This raised the possibility that p38γ might also contribute to the inhibition of cyclin D1 by hypoxia (i.e. the portion of the effect that was not inhibited by SB203580). To test this hypothesis, we generated stably transfected PC12 cell lines that express p38γAF, a kinase-inactive mutant of p38γ. Overexpression of a similar mutant (Y185F) has been shown previously to inhibit endogenous p38γ enzyme activity effectively (32Lechner C. Zahalka M.A. Giot J.F. Moller N.P.H. Ullrich A. Proc. Natl.

Fig.6 shows that, compared with vector-transfected cells, the hypoxia-induced decrease in cyclin D1 is partially reversed in the p38γAF cell line. These results were confirmed in two separate clones and show that p38γ, like p38α, is involved in the down-regulation of cyclin D1 during hypoxia; however, pretreatment of p38γAF-expressing cells with SB203580 did not result in a further impairment of the effect of hypoxia on cyclin D1 expression (data not shown).Figure 6Role of p38γ in the hypoxia-induced decrease in cyclin D1.

This indicates that the origin of the nitrogen atom of pyridoxine in S. cerevisiae is different from that of E. coli (17Tazuya K. Adachi Y. Masuda K. Yamada K. Kumaoka H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1244: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).In Aspergillus nidulans a pyridoxine auxotrophic mutation termed pyroA4 defines a gene involved in the biosynthesis of pyridoxine (18Pontecorvo G. Adv. Genet. 1953; 5: 141-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar). We have sequenced pyroA and show it encodes a highly conserved protein found in all major phylogenetic domains (19Woese C.R. Kandler O. Wheelis M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4576-4579Crossref PubMed Scopus (4441) Google Scholar) but for which a function was previously unknown. Our data indicate that the function of this highly conserved protein is the synthesis of pyridoxine in a novel pathway that is distinct from the pathway utilized in E. coli , which does not contain this gene. Interestingly, mutation of the pyroA homologue ofCercospora nicotianae (SOR1 ) causes increased sensitivity to singlet oxygen generated by photosensitizer compounds, and our analysis provides a molecular explanation for this phenomenon.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains were grown and maintained as described previously (20Bussink H.J.

For incubation in the light, an F15 CW 8-watt fluorescent bulb was fixed in a 35 °C incubator, and plates were placed directly below the light source at a distance of 12 inches. For incubation in the dark, plates were double-wrapped in heavy duty aluminum foil and placed in the same incubator. Strains employed were GR5 (pyrG89 ;wA3 ; pyroA4 ), R153 (wA3 ;pyroA4 ), and SO53 (wA3 nimT23 ).

Proceedings of the EMBO-Alko Workshop on Molecular Biology of Filamentous Fungi. 6. Foundation for Biotechnical and Industrial Fermentation Research, Helsinki, Finland1989: 11-20Google Scholar) was sequenced on both strands to tentatively identify the pyroA encoding region. Overlapping 5′-RACE1 PCR was employed using conditions as described by the manufacturer (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) to define the 5′ and 3′ end of the pyroA transcript. The region defined by RACE PCR was PCR-amplified and cloned directionally into the conditionalA. nidulans expression plasmid pAL5 (22Waring R.B. May G.S. Morris N.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 79: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) to generate plasmid pPYRO4. Induction and repression of transformants containing pPYRO4 were as described (22Waring R.B. May G.S. Morris N.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 79: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Data bank BLAST searches were performed at the National Center of Biotechnology Information (23Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59138) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONA. nidulans is able to grow when supplied with trace elements, inorganic salts, and a simple carbon source. However, this filamentous ascomycete requires pyridoxine for growth when thepyroA gene is mutated. The pyroA4 mutation therefore defines an essential function for pyridoxine biosynthesis. The pyroA gene is shown to encode a member of a highly conserved protein family with members in the Archaea , bacteria, and Eukarya but for which no function was previously known. We propose this function is an enzymatic step in the biosynthetic pathway to pyridoxine.The nitrogen atom of pyridoxine has a different origin in E. coli compared with S. cerevisiae , suggesting that the biosynthetic route to pyridoxine is different between these organisms (17Tazuya K. Adachi Y. Masuda K. Yamada K. Kumaoka H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1244: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Two of the genes involved in pyridoxine biosynthesis in E. coli , pdxA and pdxJ , are highly conserved in some of the bacteria but absent from others. Those bacteria that do not contain pdxA or pdxJ instead contain apyroA homologue. We have been unable to identify genes similar to pdxA or pdxJ in the Archaea or Eukarya , which either contain pyroA homologues or do not contain pdx or pyroA genes. These genetic and biochemical data strongly argue that there are two pathways to pyridoxine synthesis, one involving the pdx genes and another involving pyroA . Numerous parasitic organisms lack both pdx genes and pyroA and are likely to require pyridoxine to grow. Crown eukaryotes are also unlikely to encode these enzymes but instead need pyridoxine in their diet.In some S. cerevisiae strains there are multiple genes, termed SNZ1 , -2 , etc., that are homologous topyroA . Each SNZ gene is adjacent to a member of a second conserved gene family termed SNO genes, suggesting that their functions are linked. Like pyroA , SNO genes are found in all three phylogenetic domains and are distributed in a similar fashion (26Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 443-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 27Padilla P.A. Fuge E.K. Crawford M.E. Errett A. WernerWashburne M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5718-5726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If an organism contains apyroA homologue then it also contains a SNO -like gene. Because of the tight linkage of pyroA -like genes andSNO genes in the genomes of several organisms and their identical distribution among the Archaea , bacteria, andEukarya , it is possible that SNO -related genes function in the pyroA pathway of pyridoxine biosynthesis. Because of low level sequence similarity it has been proposed that SNO proteins are related to glutamine amidotransferase enzymes (26Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 443-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This proposed function would fit well with the suggestion that SNO proteins play a role in the biosynthesis of pyridoxine, given that glutamine acts as the nitrogen donor for pyridoxine synthesis in yeast.pyroA -related genes (SNZ genes) have been implicated in the starvation response in S. cerevisiae as cells accumulate during the stationary phase. One possibility is that this is due to depletion of the pyridoxine pool, causing an increased requirement for biosynthetic capacity for pyridoxine. It is likely that the biosynthetic pathway to pyridoxine is under negative feedback control and that the genes in this pathway will not be expressed at high levels if sufficient pyridoxine in present. It has also been noted that SNZ mutants are sensitive to 6-azauracil, an inhibitor of purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis (27Padilla P.A. Fuge E.K. Crawford M.E. Errett A. WernerWashburne M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5718-5726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is also consistent with the proposed role for pyroA (SNZ ) in pyridoxine biosynthesis, as pyridoxine is a precursor for the pyrimidine moiety of thiamine in S. cerevisiae (28Tazuya K. Yamada K. Kumaoka H. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 279: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar).In another ascomycete fungus, the filamentous plant pathogen C. nicotianae , a pyroA homologue (SOR1 ) has been implicated in singlet oxygen (1O2) resistance. This fungus produces cercosporin, a compound that generates1O2 when exposed to light and is therefore called a photosensitizer. Mutation of SOR1 renders normally resistant strains of C. nicotianae sensitive to1O2-generating compounds such as cercosporin and methylene blue. S. cerevisiae SNZ mutants are also sensitive to methylene blue and light. Similarly, our data show thatA. nidulans pyroA4 mutants are also sensitive to methylene blue and light. However, by exposing plates containing pyridoxine and methylene blue or rose bengal to light prior to inoculation we have found A. nidulans pyroA4 mutants unable to grow subsequently on these plates in the dark. pyroA4 strains complemented with the pyroA gene are able to grow on such plates normally. This is not a specific effect caused by the pyroA4 mutation as a mutation in a second gene involved in pyridoxine biosynthesis, pyroB100 , also renders cells sensitive to photosensitizers and light. These data indicate that pyridoxine is sensitive to photosensitizers when exposed to light. We predict that other organisms having mutations in pyroA - orpyroB -like genes will also be sensitive to photosensitizers and light as pyridoxine will be destroyed and they will be unable to synthesize pyridoxine. Indeed, any mutation causing pyridoxine auxotrophy should show sensitivity to photosensitizers and light.The realization that pyroA -like genes are required to synthesize pyridoxine helps to explain some previously confusing aspects of this gene family. The proposed role of SOR1 in1O2 resistance in Cercospora is at odds with the occurrence of members of this gene family in anaerobic organisms (25Ehrenshaft M. Jenns A.E. Chung K.R. Daub M.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 603-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The fact that pyroA is required for pyridoxine biosynthesis explains the occurrence of gene family members in anaerobic organisms, and our data suggest that the role ofSOR1 in 1O2 resistance may be an indirect effect related to the stability of pyridoxine. However, it will be interesting to ascertain if SOR1 plays an additional role in resistance to photosensitizers apart from supplying pyridoxine for normal growth of Cercospora . The distribution ofpyroA to a subset of the bacteria can also now be explained if two pathways of pyridoxine biosynthesis exist, one involvingpyroA and another the pdx genes. What is less clear is why two highly conserved pathways for pyridoxine biosynthesis have evolved and what evolutionary pressures caused some bacteria to retain pyroA while others evolved instead withpdx genes. The precise enzymatic function ofpyroA , pdxA , and pdxJ may help to shed some light on this new conundrum. The pathway leading to pyridoxine (vitamin B6) synthesis has been largely defined in Escherichia coli through the study of pyridoxine auxotrophic mutants and tracer experiments using radiolabeled precursors (1Spenser I.D. Hill R.E. Nat. Prod. Rep. 1995; 12: 555-565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Although little work has been done on the pyridoxine biosynthetic pathway in Eukarya (eukaryotes), results of these studies suggest that the pyridoxine biosynthetic pathway is significantly different between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and E. coli because the label ofl-[amide -15N]glutamine is incorporated efficiently into pyridoxine in S. cerevisiae but not in E. coli . This indicates that the origin of the nitrogen atom of pyridoxine in S. cerevisiae is different from that of E. coli (17Tazuya K. Adachi Y. Masuda K. Yamada K. Kumaoka H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1244: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In Aspergillus nidulans a pyridoxine auxotrophic mutation termed pyroA4 defines a gene involved in the biosynthesis of pyridoxine (18Pontecorvo G. Adv. Genet. 1953; 5: 141-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar). We have sequenced pyroA and show it encodes a highly conserved protein found in all major phylogenetic domains (19Woese C.R. Kandler O. Wheelis M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4576-4579Crossref PubMed Scopus (4441) Google Scholar) but for which a function was previously unknown. Our data indicate that the function of this highly conserved protein is the synthesis of pyridoxine in a novel pathway that is distinct from the pathway utilized in E. coli , which does not contain this gene. Interestingly, mutation of the pyroA homologue ofCercospora nicotianae (SOR1 ) causes increased sensitivity to singlet oxygen generated by photosensitizer compounds, and our analysis provides a molecular explanation for this phenomenon. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains were grown and maintained as described previously (20Bussink H.J. Osmani S.A.

DISCUSSIONA. nidulans is able to grow when supplied with trace elements, inorganic salts, and a simple carbon source. However, this filamentous ascomycete requires pyridoxine for growth when thepyroA gene is mutated. The pyroA4 mutation therefore defines an essential function for pyridoxine biosynthesis. The pyroA gene is shown to encode a member of a highly conserved protein family with members in the Archaea , bacteria, and Eukarya but for which no function was previously known. We propose this function is an enzymatic step in the biosynthetic pathway to pyridoxine.The nitrogen atom of pyridoxine has a different origin in E. coli compared with S. cerevisiae , suggesting that the biosynthetic route to pyridoxine is different between these organisms (17Tazuya K. Adachi Y. Masuda K. Yamada K. Kumaoka H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1244: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Two of the genes involved in pyridoxine biosynthesis in E. coli , pdxA and pdxJ , are highly conserved in some of the bacteria but absent from others. Those bacteria that do not contain pdxA or pdxJ instead contain apyroA homologue. We have been unable to identify genes similar to pdxA or pdxJ in the Archaea or Eukarya , which either contain pyroA homologues or do not contain pdx or pyroA genes. These genetic and biochemical data strongly argue that there are two pathways to pyridoxine synthesis, one involving the pdx genes and another involving pyroA . Numerous parasitic organisms lack both pdx genes and pyroA and are likely to require pyridoxine to grow. Crown eukaryotes are also unlikely to encode these enzymes but instead need pyridoxine in their diet.In some S. cerevisiae strains there are multiple genes, termed SNZ1 , -2 , etc., that are homologous topyroA . Each SNZ gene is adjacent to a member of a second conserved gene family termed SNO genes, suggesting that their functions are linked. Like pyroA , SNO genes are found in all three phylogenetic domains and are distributed in a similar fashion (26Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 443-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 27Padilla P.A. Fuge E.K. Crawford M.E. Errett A. WernerWashburne M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5718-5726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If an organism contains apyroA homologue then it also contains a SNO -like gene. Because of the tight linkage of pyroA -like genes andSNO genes in the genomes of several organisms and their identical distribution among the Archaea , bacteria, andEukarya , it is possible that SNO -related genes function in the pyroA pathway of pyridoxine biosynthesis. Because of low level sequence similarity it has been proposed that SNO proteins are related to glutamine amidotransferase enzymes (26Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 443-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This proposed function would fit well with the suggestion that SNO proteins play a role in the biosynthesis of pyridoxine, given that glutamine acts as the nitrogen donor for pyridoxine synthesis in yeast.pyroA -related genes (SNZ genes) have been implicated in the starvation response in S. cerevisiae as cells accumulate during the stationary phase. One possibility is that this is due to depletion of the pyridoxine pool, causing an increased requirement for biosynthetic capacity for pyridoxine. It is likely that the biosynthetic pathway to pyridoxine is under negative feedback control and that the genes in this pathway will not be expressed at high levels if sufficient pyridoxine in present. It has also been noted that SNZ mutants are sensitive to 6-azauracil, an inhibitor of purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis (27Padilla P.A. Fuge E.K. Crawford M.E. Errett A. WernerWashburne M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5718-5726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is also consistent with the proposed role for pyroA (SNZ ) in pyridoxine biosynthesis, as pyridoxine is a precursor for the pyrimidine moiety of thiamine in S. cerevisiae (28Tazuya K. Yamada K. Kumaoka H. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 279: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar).In another ascomycete fungus, the filamentous plant pathogen C. nicotianae , a pyroA homologue (SOR1 ) has been implicated in singlet oxygen (1O2) resistance. This fungus produces cercosporin, a compound that generates1O2 when exposed to light and is therefore called a photosensitizer. Mutation of SOR1 renders normally resistant strains of C. nicotianae sensitive to1O2-generating compounds such as cercosporin and methylene blue. S. cerevisiae SNZ mutants are also sensitive to methylene blue and light. Similarly, our data show thatA. nidulans pyroA4 mutants are also sensitive to methylene blue and light. However, by exposing plates containing pyridoxine and methylene blue or rose bengal to light prior to inoculation we have found A. nidulans pyroA4 mutants unable to grow subsequently on these plates in the dark. pyroA4 strains complemented with the pyroA gene are able to grow on such plates normally. This is not a specific effect caused by the pyroA4 mutation as a mutation in a second gene involved in pyridoxine biosynthesis, pyroB100 , also renders cells sensitive to photosensitizers and light. These data indicate that pyridoxine is sensitive to photosensitizers when exposed to light. We predict that other organisms having mutations in pyroA - orpyroB -like genes will also be sensitive to photosensitizers and light as pyridoxine will be destroyed and they will be unable to synthesize pyridoxine. Indeed, any mutation causing pyridoxine auxotrophy should show sensitivity to photosensitizers and light.The realization that pyroA -like genes are required to synthesize pyridoxine helps to explain some previously confusing aspects of this gene family. The proposed role of SOR1 in1O2 resistance in Cercospora is at odds with the occurrence of members of this gene family in anaerobic organisms (25Ehrenshaft M. Jenns A.E. Chung K.R. Daub M.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 603-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The fact that pyroA is required for pyridoxine biosynthesis explains the occurrence of gene family members in anaerobic organisms, and our data suggest that the role ofSOR1 in 1O2 resistance may be an indirect effect related to the stability of pyridoxine. However, it will be interesting to ascertain if SOR1 plays an additional role in resistance to photosensitizers apart from supplying pyridoxine for normal growth of Cercospora . The distribution ofpyroA to a subset of the bacteria can also now be explained if two pathways of pyridoxine biosynthesis exist, one involvingpyroA and another the pdx genes. What is less clear is why two highly conserved pathways for pyridoxine biosynthesis have evolved and what evolutionary pressures caused some bacteria to retain pyroA while others evolved instead withpdx genes. The precise enzymatic function ofpyroA , pdxA , and pdxJ may help to shed some light on this new conundrum.

However, the remaining C-terminal structures including the two other α-helices and the disulfide bond need to be preserved for PrPRes to be infectious (3Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5088) Google Scholar, 6Korth C. Stierli B. Streit P. Moser M. Schaller O. Fischer R. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Kretzschmar H. Raeber A. Braun U.

Nature. 1997; 39: 74-77Crossref Scopus (538) Google Scholar).The events leading to the conversion of PrPC to PrPRes are, at present, not fully understood. In the inherited prion diseases, which have only been associated with mutations in the PrP gene (PRNP ), the mutation is believed to destabilize the mutant PrP (PrPM), which then undergoes a spontaneous conformational change into the protease-resistant and pathogenic form (7Parchi P. Gambetti P. Piccardo P. Ghetti B. Kirkham N. Lemoine N.R. Progress in Pathology. Churchill Livingstone, Edinburgh, UK1998: 39-77Google Scholar, 8Ghetti B. Gambetti P. Mattson M.

Biol. 1996; 61: 473-493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty-three pathogenic mutations inPRNP have been reported to date, which are associated with three phenotypes: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, fatal familial insomnia, and Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker disease (GSS) (8Ghetti B. Gambetti P. Mattson M. Genetic Aberrancies and Neurodegenerative Disorders. Jai Press, Inc., Greenwich, CT1999Google Scholar, 9Prusiner S.B. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1996; 61: 473-493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite their congenital presence, all mutations cause diseases that become symptomatic in the adult or advanced age. Of the seven PRNP mutations associated with GSS, a chronic cerebellar ataxia and dementia characterized by the presence of prominent amyloid plaques containing internal PrPM fragments, all are missense mutations except for the mutation at codon 145 that replaces tyrosine (TAT) with a stop (TAG) codon (Y145stop) (10Ghetti B. Piccardo P. Frangione B. Bugiani O. Giaccone G. Young K. Prelli F. Farlow M.R. Dlouhy S.R. Tagliavini F. Brain Pathol. 1996; 6: 127-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 11Kitamoto T.

A. 1996; 93: 744-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar).The 145 mutation is especially challenging because it results in the premature termination of protein synthesis and yields a truncated PrP (PrP145) that lacks the C-terminal 146–231 amino acids including the glycosylphosphatidyl inositol anchor, which links PrP to the cell surface, and the two sites for N -glycosylation, which are known to stabilize the PrP molecule (13Petersen R.B.

Thus, although PrP145 includes the 90–112 segment where the major conformational changes take place and almost all the ∼80–147 internal fragment that is found in PrP amyloid, it lacks the C-terminal region containing the two α-helices and the disulfide bond, which are required for the PrPC-PrPRes conversion (15Kaneko K. Zulianello L. Scott M. Cooper C.M. Wallace A.C. James T.L. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10069-10074Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar,16Kaneko K. Vey M.

Moreover, most of the PrP145 is likely to include the 23–90-residue N-terminal region of PrP, which has been shown to be superfluous for conversion to PrPRes (15Kaneko K. Zulianello L. Scott M.

Yet, the Y145stop mutation is associated with a phenotype not basically different from that of the GSS subtypes associated with other mutations, which do not result in the truncation of PrPM(10Ghetti B. Piccardo P. Frangione B. Bugiani O. Giaccone G. Young K. Prelli F. Farlow M.R. Dlouhy S.R. Tagliavini F. Brain Pathol. 1996; 6: 127-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The only significant difference is the presence of numerous PrP-amyloid deposits in the cerebral vessels rather than in the brain parenchyma as in the other GSS subtypes (10Ghetti B. Piccardo P. Frangione B. Bugiani O. Giaccone G. Young K. Prelli F. Farlow M.R. Dlouhy S.R. Tagliavini F. Brain Pathol. 1996; 6: 127-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 11Kitamoto T. Iizuka R.

A. 1996; 93: 744-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar).Currently, there are no animal or cellular models of the Y145stop mutation. Expression of the truncated PrP145 was not detected in transgenic animals and transfected neuroblastoma cells following deletion of the 144–231 region, which results in a PrPM identical in primary structure to that generated by the Y145stop mutation (17Fischer M. Rülicke Raeber A. Sailer A. Moser M. Oesch B. Bradner S. Aguzzi A. Weissmann C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 18Muramoto T. DeArmond S.J. Scott M. Telling G.C. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 750-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of this mutation on the metabolism of PrP145, hence to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of this GSS variant, we have transfected human neuroblastoma cells withPRNP constructs carrying the Y145stop mutation or wild typePRNP . We report, for the first time, that mutant PrP145 is degraded through the proteasomal pathway. Inhibition of proteasomal degradation results in the accumulation of PrP145 in intracellular compartments, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the cis -medial-Golgi compartment, and the nucleus. Most of the accumulated PrP145 is aggregated and partially resistant to mild proteinase K treatment. Protease-resistant PrP145 is also present in the detergent-soluble fraction, suggesting that the PrP145 protease resistance is not simply because of aggregation.DISCUSSIONThe Y145stop mutation in the human prion protein gene,PRNP , is associated with a GSS variant of prion disease. Previous attempts to generate a model of this GSS variant in transgenic mice and transfected cells have failed because no expression of the mutant PrP145 could be detected in these models (18Muramoto T. DeArmond S.J. Scott M. Telling G.C. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 750-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 24Bradner S. Isenmann S. Raeber A. Fischer M. Sailer A. Kobayashi Y. Marino S. Weissmann C. Aguzzi A. Nature. 1996; 379: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that in a transfected cell model, PrP145is expressed in two truncated forms, one of which conserves the signal peptide. Both forms are unstable and are rapidly degraded through the proteasomal pathway. However, both accumulate in significant quantities in intracellular compartments and become aggregated and weakly protease-resistant when proteasomal degradation is impaired. These findings may resolve the dilemma posed by the previous models. They also widen the spectrum of pathogenetic mechanisms that may be involved in prion diseases and provide novel avenues of investigation toward the understanding of this puzzling GSS variant.The Uncleaved Signal Peptide Predisposes PrP145 to AggregationInefficient cleavage of the N-terminal signal peptide because of naturally occurring mutations within the signal has been shown to be pathogenic in various conditions, but it is unprecedented in prion diseases (25Arnold A. Horst S.A. Gardella T.J. Baba H. Levine M.A. Kronenberg H.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1084-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 26Racchi M. Watzke H.H. High K.A. Lively M.O. J. Biol.

A. 1996; 93: 9606-9611Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This “proform” appears to accumulate intracellularly and tends to aggregate more readily than the signal-cleaved form. The inefficient immunoprecipitation of this form is probably because of a change in conformation of its “soluble” pool, in addition to the formation of detergent-insoluble aggregates (see below). Thus, under normal experimental conditions, the amount of the signal peptide containing PrP145 recovered in immunoblots is more than four times the amount recovered after immunoprecipitation. After lactacystin treatment, the signal peptide containing PrP145 accounts for almost all of the detergent-insoluble and weakly protease-resistant aggregates that accumulate intracellularly. With continuous lactacystin treatment, both the signal-uncleaved and -cleaved forms are secreted into the medium through a brefeldin A-sensitive pathway, although the signal-uncleaved form comprises the major secreted form. The preferential detection of the latter in the medium could be because of its greater stability. Thus, both forms translocate into the ER lumen, and the signal-uncleaved form is not inserted in the lipid bilayer through the signal peptide. This conclusion is consistent with the lack of detectable PrP145 on the cell surface by either immunofluorescence or biotinylation. None of the PrP145forms were found to be bound to any of the major ER-specific chaperones, either in the presence or absence of lactacystin.PrP145 Is Degraded by the ProteasomeThe PrP145 has a half-life of ∼10 min and at steady state is nine times less abundant than PrPC. Therefore, it is by far the most unstable of all the forms of mutant PrP we have examined to date (13Petersen R.B. Parchi P. Richardson S.L. Urig C.B. Gambetti P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12661-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 19Singh N. Zanusso G. Chen S.G. Fujioka H. Richardson S. Gambetti P. Petersen R.B. J. Biol.

The lack of all major post-translational modifications and presence of the signal peptide, both of which target PrP145 for rapid degradation and aggregation, easily explain the marked instability of PrP145.The turnover of both PrP145 forms that persists at 15 °C and in the presence of brefeldin A point to a pre-Golgi site of degradation. Following inhibition of proteasomal degradation, PrP145 accumulates primarily in the ER, Golgi, and in the nucleus, but apparently not in the late endosomes or lysosomes. The precise site of PrP145 proteasomal degradation has not been established in this study. PrP145 might be degraded by proteasomes on the cytosolic face of the ER membrane, as has been reported for the T-cell receptor α-chain and other ER luminal and secretory proteins (29Yu H. Kaung G.

It would then accumulate upstream in the secretory pathway in the ER and Golgi and also diffuse to the nucleus from the cytosol when the degradation is blocked. Recently, cytosolic accumulation of two transmembrane proteins, presenilin-1 and cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator, has been described upon inhibition of proteasomal function (37Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar). We do not observe significant accumulation of PrP145 in the cytosol after proteasomal inhibition. Instead, PrP145 seems to be specifically targeted to the nucleus by a nuclear localization signal that becomes functional when the carboxyl end of the protein is truncated at residue 145. One type of nuclear localization sequence comprises one or more clusters of basic amino acid residues, which, however, lack tight consensus sequence (38Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the N terminus of PrP has a cluster of amino acids (KKRPKP) similar to the SV-40 large T antigen nuclear localization signal (PKKKRKV). Studies are ongoing to establish if this sequence functions as a cryptic nuclear localization signal.We did not detect ubiquitinated PrP145 even though our data prove conclusively that the proteasomal pathway degrades PrP145. Whether PrP145 is degraded without ubiquitination as observed for other proteins (29Yu H. Kaung G. Kobayashi S. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20800-20804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) or is tagged by some other ubiquitin-like protein (39Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14001-14004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) remains to be determined.Applicability of the Present Model to the 145 GSS Human DiseaseThe PrP145 forms present several unusual characteristics when they are compared with the other mutant PrPs expressed in transfected cells (13Petersen R.B. Parchi P. Richardson S.L. Urig C.B. Gambetti P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12661-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 14Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28461-28470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). First, they are highly unstable and are for the most part rapidly degraded. Second, when degradation is impaired, they become partially resistant to protease digestion. Third, paradoxically, the PrP145 is more protease-resistant in the dispersed than in the aggregated form and, in this form, the protease-resistant fragments include the intact N terminus, whereas a 1.5–2-kDa sequence located at the C terminus remains protease-sensitive. This contrasts with the data from the other transfected cell models of inherited prion diseases in which the mutant PrP spontaneously becomes protease-resistant, the protease-resistant fraction is present only in the aggregated form, and the protease-resistant core includes residues ∼90–231 (14Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21479-21487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 19Singh N. Zanusso G. Chen S.G. Fujioka H. Richardson S. Gambetti P.

A. 1993; 90: 3182-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The present findings argue that also the N-terminal region of PrP, including the signal peptide, may aggregate and become weakly resistant to proteases. Moreover, they indicate that because PrP145is also resistant to protease treatment in the dispersed state, the protease resistance is not exclusively because of aggregation but to other mechanisms such as, for example, the presence of a protective ligand or the adoption of a β-sheet conformation in a monomeric or oligomeric state. A recent report supports this assumption (47Jackson G.S. Hosszu L.L.P. Power A. Hill A.F. Kenney J. Saibil H. Craven C.J. Waltho J.P. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Science. 1999; 283: 1935-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). It has also been recently shown that the PrP 121–231 C terminus segment can adopt a β-sheet conformation at acidic pH, independently of other segments (40Hornemann S. Glockshuber R. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6010-6014Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar).The salient histopathological features of the human Y145stop variant of GSS are the widespread PrP amyloid deposits in vessels and parenchyma of brain and the presence of intraneuronal fibrillary inclusions called neurofibrillary tangles, whereas spongiform degeneration is lacking (7Parchi P. Gambetti P. Piccardo P. Ghetti B. Kirkham N. Lemoine N.R. Progress in Pathology. Churchill Livingstone, Edinburgh, UK1998: 39-77Google Scholar,11Kitamoto T. Iizuka R. Tateishi J. Biochem. Biophys.

The amyloid deposits have been shown to immunostain with antibodies raised to the N-terminal 25 amino acids of PrP, indicating the presence of N-terminal fragment(s) of PrP145 (11Kitamoto T. Iizuka R. Tateishi J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In addition, an N and C terminus-truncated ∼7.5-kDa PrP fragment has been detected in monomeric and oligomeric forms, which by epitope mapping is believed to include amino acids 90–147 (12Ghetti B. Piccardo P. Spillantini M.G. Ichimiya Y. Porro M. Perini F. Kitamoto T. Tateishi J. Seiler C. Frangione B. Bugiani O. Giaccone G. Prelli F. Goedert M. Dlouhy S.R. Tagliavini F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 744-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). A ∼7.5-kDa PrP fragment has also been isolated from the amyloid deposits of other GSS variants associated with PRNP point mutations, and it has been found to be the only PK-resistant PrP form recovered from the brain when spongiform degeneration is absent (8Ghetti B. Gambetti P. Mattson M. Genetic Aberrancies and Neurodegenerative Disorders. Jai Press, Inc., Greenwich, CT1999Google Scholar, 10Ghetti B. Piccardo P. Frangione B. Bugiani O. Giaccone G. Young K.

In the P102L GSS variant, the ∼7.5-kDa fragment has been shown to span residues 78–82 to residues 147–150 by sequence and mass spectrophotometric analyses (42Parchi P. Chen S.G. Brown P. Zou W. Capellari S. Budka H. Hainfellner J. Reyes P.F. Golden G.T. Hauw J.J. Gajdusek D.C. Gambetti P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8322-8327Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Therefore, the 7.5-kDa fragment present in the amyloid deposits of Y145stop GSS variant is likely to include residues ∼80 to ∼145 and to be the only major PK-resistant PrP fragment present in the brain parenchyma of subjects affected by this disease.It is not immediately evident how the findings of the human disease and the present findings can be reconciled. We did not find a 7.5-kDa PrP fragment or any fragment of smaller size. Data obtained from cell models of inherited prion diseases have been compared with those obtained from brains affected by the corresponding disease in a previous study (13Petersen R.B. Parchi P. Richardson S.L. Urig C.B. Gambetti P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12661-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). It was found that although the cell model does not form a PK-resistant PrP comparable with that of the disease, it reproduces the metabolic changes occurring in the mutant PrP in the brain (13Petersen R.B. Parchi P. Richardson S.L. Urig C.B. Gambetti P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12661-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is reasonable to postulate that PrP14 and 15.5 forms are expressed in the brain of the subjects carrying the Y145stop PRNP mutation and are in large amount cleared through the proteasomal pathway. Effective proteasomal degradation of PrP145 along with the presence of the PrPCencoded by the normal allele may prevent the expression of disease until adult age. However, a decrease in proteasomal function with advanced age or the low but continuous intracellular accumulation and secretion of the aggregated and weakly PK resistant PrP145would result in the formation of the highly amyloidogenic ∼7.5-kDa PrP fragment and formation of amyloid deposits. Future studies of Y145stop GSS variant-affected brains should search for the presence and distribution of the PrP14 and 15.5 forms. It would be important to determine whether PrP145 is present in aggregated and weakly PK-resistant form and whether some of it is located inside the nucleus. These findings would provide indirect evidence that proteasomal degradation is impaired in the human disease.Other neurodegenerative diseases have also been shown to involve the proteasome. Recently, it has been shown that the proteasomal system participates in the metabolism of amyloid β peptide, the main component of the amyloid accumulating in Alzheimer's disease (33Kim T.W.

The presence of PrP145 in the nucleus also provides an interesting analogy with a group of inherited neurodegenerative diseases, which include Huntington's chorea and forms of cerebellar ataxia. In each of these diseases, the presence of polyglutamine repeat expansions leads the mutated protein to adopt a β-sheet structure and to form insoluble, ubiquitinated aggregates in the nucleus (43Paulson H.L.

Mutations of Gly-533 to valine or leucine in the top channel of mCOX-2 abolished the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin G2, presumably because of a steric clash between the ω-end of the substrate and the introduced side chains. A smaller G533A mutant retained partial COX activity. The loss of COX activity with these mutants was not the result of reduced peroxidase activity, because the activity of all mutants was equivalent to the wild-type enzyme and the addition of exogenous peroxide did not restore full COX activity to any of the mutants. However, the Gly-533 mutants were able to oxidize the carbon 18 fatty acid substrates linolenic acid and stearidonic acid, which contain an allylic carbon at the ω-5 position. In contrast, linoleic acid, which is like arachidonic acid in that its most ω-proximal allylic carbon is at the ω-8 position, was not oxidized by the Gly-533 mutants. Finally, the ability of Gly-533 mutants to efficiently process ω-5 allylic substrates suggests that the top channel does not serve as a product exit route indicating that oxygenated substrate diffuses from the cyclooxygenase active site in a membrane proximal direction.

Ogino N. Yamamoto S. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 829-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first activity catalyzes the oxygenation and cyclization of arachidonic acid within the cyclooxygenase (COX) active site to produce PGG2. PGG2 then exits the cyclooxygenase active site and undergoes a two-electron reduction, yielding PGH2at the peroxidase active site (2Smith W.L. Marnett L.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1083: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Two isoforms of COX exist, COX-1 and COX-2, that effect the same enzymatic reactions (3Herschman H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). They are approximately 60% identical in sequence and are highly homologous in both active site regions. Not surprisingly, their three-dimensional structures are nearly superimposable (4Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar, 5Luong C.

COX-1 and COX-2 are mediators of numerous physiological and pathological responses, and therefore considerable effort has been devoted to developing selective COX inhibitors. This is especially true of COX-2, which is a significant contributor to inflammation, hyperalgesia, and cancer (7DuBois R.N. Abramson S.B. Crofford L. Gupta R.A. Simon L.S.

However, the orientation of the rest of the substrate molecule, particularly the ω-end, is uncertain. We have approached the problem of arachidonic acid-COX interaction by attempting to match the chemical mandates of the cyclooxygenase reaction to complementary regions on the protein. COX catalyzes the conversion of an achiral molecule into a product with five chiral centers (15Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5336-5343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Noteworthy is the generation of the endoperoxide ring with the trans -substituted alkyl side chains. This stereochemistry is opposite that observed in the auto-oxidation of arachidonic acid in solution in which the alkyl side chains are oriented cis (16O'Connor D.E. Mihelich E.D. Coleman M.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 3577-3584Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thus, the enzyme must orientate the arachidonic acid molecule in the COX active site to facilitate the formation of the trans -substituted ring. Any model for COX-arachidonate binding must accommodate this stereochemical mandate. Some time ago it was predicted that the enzyme holds arachidonate in a kinked or l-shaped conformation to facilitate cyclization to form a trans -disubstituted dioxabicycloheptane ring (17Marnett L.J. Maddipati K.R. Everse J. Everse K.E. Grisham M.B. Peroxidases in Chemistry and Biology. 1. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 293-334Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Therefore, we modeled such a conformation into the COX-1 active site with the carboxylate adjacent to Arg-120 and the 13-pro-S -hydrogen adjacent to Tyr-385; this starting structure was then energy-minimized. The minimized conformation positioned the ω-end of arachidonate above Ser-530 projecting into a region that we term the top channel. The importance of the top channel was tested using site-directed mutagenesis of murine COX-2, which can be expressed at high levels in insect cells and purified to homogeneity. The results of the mutagenesis experiments are strongly supportive of a role for the top channel in binding the ω-end of arachidonic acid and are consistent with the predictions of the energy minimized model. Linoleic acid (9Z ,12Z -octadecadienoic acid), linolenic acid (9Z ,12Z ,15Z -octadecatrienoic acid), and stearidonic acid (6Z ,9Z ,12Z ,15Z -octadecatetraenoic acid) were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Arachidonic acid (5Z ,8Z ,11Z ,14Z -eicosatetraenoic acid) and [14C]arachidonic acid were purchased from Nu-Check-Prep, Inc. and NEN Life Science Products, respectively. Electrophoresis and chromatography reagents were purchased from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules, CA). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. All modeling of arachidonic acid and sheep COX-1 was performed using InsightII (Biosyms Technologies, San Diego, CA) in the manner described previously (18Lanzo C.A. Beechem J. Talley J. Marnett L.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Arachidonic acid was built using the Builder module and then positioned within the cyclooxygenase active site with the carboxylate group in close proximity to Arg-120 and Tyr-355. The arachidonate main chain was then oriented upward toward the apex of the channel, with carbon 13 placed next to Tyr-385. The ω-end of arachidonate was then placed above Ser-530, protruding into the top channel toward Asn-375. Using the Discover module, several rounds of energy minimization were performed, maintaining the sheep COX-1 structure as a fixed entity and allowing arachidonate to freely rotate into its most energetically favorable orientation. Several rounds of energy minimization were necessary to obtain a structure that was energetically favorable and consistent with the predicted stereochemical requirements of PGG2 production,i.e. maintenance of all cis double bonds and positioning of the 13-pro-S- hydrogen in close proximity to Tyr-385. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on a mCOX-2 pBS(+) vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutant containing regions were subcloned into the mCOX-2 pVL1393 baculovirus expression vector (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) using the Stu I restriction site in mCOX-2 and the Xba I restriction site present in both the pBS(+) and pVL1393 vectors. The subcloned region was fully sequenced to ensure that no accidental mutations were incorporated. Wild-type and mutant protein was expressed by homologous recombination of the mCOX-2·pVL1393 vector with the Baculogold vector (PharMingen) in SF-9 cells (Novagen, Madison, WI). After virus amplification, 4 liters of SF-9 cells (95–100% viable) were grown in TNM-FH medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 1%l-glutamine, and 0.1% (v/v) pluronic F68 and then infected with fresh viral stock. Upon reaching 65–70% viability, the 4-liter total volume was harvested by centrifugation at 2500 rpm in a Sorvall RC-3B, and the pellet was washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and recentrifuged. The final cell pellet was stored at −70 °C. Purification of wild-type and mutant COXs were performed at 4 °C in a manner similar to that described previously (19Gierse J.K. McDonald J.J. Hauser S.D.

Frozen cells were resuspended to 30 × 106 cells/ml in 80 mmTris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mmdiethyldithiocarbamic acid, pH 7.2. After centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 45 min, the pellet was resuspended using a Dounce homogenizer to a final volume of 72 ml. Solubilization of the COX protein from the membrane was initiated by the dropwise addition of 8 ml of 11% (w/v) CHAPS. After stirring for 1 h, the sample was recentrifuged as described above and the supernatant removed and then diluted 4-fold by the addition of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.4% CHAPS, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mmdiethyldithiocarbamic acid, pH 8.0 (Buffer B). The diluted sample was then loaded onto a 25-ml Macro-prep High-Q ion exchange column equilibrated with Buffer B. COX enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient (500 ml) of increasing KCl to 0.3 m. An analytical 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was run of candidate COX-containing fractions to determine the fractions to pool for the gel filtration procedure. Appropriate tubes were concentrated in an Amicon concentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA) to a final volume of 1.5 ml. The sample was then loaded onto a 90-ml Superose-12 column that was pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.4% CHAPS, 0.15m NaCl, pH 8.0. Fractions containing COX enzyme, as determined from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis (as described above), were concentrated to approximately 2 mg/ml and stored at −70 °C. The purity of wild-type and mutant COX-2 proteins was evaluated by analysis of a Coomassie-stained 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel using an E-C Apparatus Model EC910 scanning densitometer. Oxygen consumption was measured with a Gilson Model 5/6 oxygraph (Gilson Medical Electronics, Inc., Middletown, WI) fitted with a Clark electrode and a thermostatted cuvette set to 37 °C in a 100 mm Tris-HCl, 500 μm phenol, pH 8.0, buffer. The rate and magnitude of oxygen uptake were determined in the manner previously described (20Kalgutkar A.S. Crews B.C. Marnett L.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9076-9082Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The peroxidase activity of all purified proteins was measured using the guaiacol peroxidase assay. Purified wild-type mCOX-2 or mCOX-2 mutants were suspended in 1 ml of 118 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at a final concentration of 100 nm. Guaiacol at 500 μm was added, and the dual cuvettes were auto-zeroed in a Shidmadzu UV 160U spectrophotometer before the addition of 400 μmH2O2 to the same cuvette. Oxidation of guaiacol was monitored at 436 nm (E 436 = 6390m−1 cm−1), and the initial rate was measured from the linear portion of the curve. Cyclooxygenase product assays were performed with purified protein reconstituted with 2 eq of hematin. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 100 μm [14C]arachidonic acid. Conditions such as the concentration of phenol, supplementation with H2O2, and time were varied and are indicated in the figure captions. All assays were terminated and analyzed by thin layer chromatography in the manner described previously (21Kalgutkar A.S. Crews B.C. Rowlinson S.W. Garner C. Seibert K. Marnett L.J. Science. 1998; 280: 1268-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Arachidonate was anchored at the carboxyl end through interactions with Arg-120 and Tyr-355 and by positioning the 13-pro-S- hydrogen adjacent to Tyr-385. The ω-end was placed into the region we term the top channel. Several rounds of energy minimization and refinement were carried out to optimally position the substrate in the sheep COX-1 active site. In the final model (Fig. 2), the carboxylic acid moieties of arachidonic acid are 3.0 and 3.1 Å from Arg-120 and Tyr-355, respectively, and the 13-pro-S -hydrogen is 2.4 Å from the hydroxyl of Tyr-385. The ω-end of arachidonate protrudes into the top channel region, and although the opening to this channel is narrow, there is sufficient room for carbons 17–20 to reside above Ser-530 and Leu-534 and project into the solvent-accessible cavity toward Gly-533. Carbon 20 resides 3.3 Å from the α carbon of Gly-533. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a series of site-directed mutants at Gly-533. This residue is conserved in all COX sequences, and we anticipated that increasing the steric bulk at this position would reduce arachidonate binding. Both wild-type and mutant COX-2 cDNAs were expressed in insect cells from baculovirus vectors, and recombinant proteins were purified by ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All of the purified proteins were shown by densitometric scanning of a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel to be equal to or greater than 80% pure (TableI).Table ICharacterization of Gly-533 mutant cyclooxygenasesConstructPurityPeroxidase activityCyclooxygenase activity, initial rateCyclooxygenase activity, total products%% wt mCOX-2% wt mCOX-2% wt mCOX-2wt mCOX-284.3100100100G533A80.099 ± 57.6 ± 0.526.3 ± 0G533V80.097 ± 400G533L80.0107 ± 300The purity of wild-type and mutant COX-2 proteins was determined from Coomassie-stained 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels.

Open table in a new tab The purity of wild-type and mutant COX-2 proteins was determined from Coomassie-stained 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Peroxidase activities were analyzed using the guaiacol peroxidase assay, and the cyclooxygenase activity initial rates and total product production were determined in the manner described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are the average of three determinations ± S.E. wt, wild type. Table I lists both the peroxidase activity and the cyclooxygenase activity of the three Gly-533 mutants. The similarities of the peroxidase activities to that of wild-type COX-2 demonstrate that the mutations did not introduce gross structural perturbations. However, the cyclooxygenase activities of all three mutants were affected significantly. The G533L and G533V mutants were unable to convert arachidonate to PGG2, whereas the G533A mutant had a much slower initial rate for substrate conversion and demonstrated just 26% of wild-type total COX-2 activity. One possibility that could explain the low turnover rate observed with G533A could be a decreased activation of cyclo-oxygenase catalysis. PGG2 released from the cyclooxygenase active site is converted to PGH2 at the peroxidase active site with concomitant formation of a heme-oxo complex (22Dietz R. Nastainczyk W. Ruf H.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This complex oxidizes Tyr-385 and generates the catalytically active tyrosyl radical. As the G533A substitution compromises conversion of arachidonate to PGG2, this lower activity could be further pronounced because of less PGG2 available to maximally activate all the COX molecules in solution. To address the concern of insufficient peroxide activation, three different approaches were employed: 1) lowering the concentration of reducing substrate (phenol) in the assay buffer to slow down the reduction of exogenous peroxides and cyclooxygenase-synthesized fatty acid hydroperoxides; (2Smith W.L. Marnett L.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1083: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) adding H2O2 to generate higher oxidation states of the peroxidase; and (3Herschman H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar) adding enzyme-synthesized fatty acid hydroperoxide as an activator. Reducing the phenol concentration from 500 to 100 μmresulted in an increase in cyclooxygenase activity of the G533A mutant from 5.5 to 18.9% converted substrate (Fig.3 A ). Likewise, the addition of 15 μm H2O2 increased the conversion of arachidonate from 3.4 to 22% (Fig. 3 B ). However, changing these conditions did not restore cyclooxygenase activity to the level observed with an equivalent amount of wild-type mCOX-2 nor did it restore any activity to either G533V or G533L. To evaluate whether PGG2 could enhance G533A turnover, G533A mCOX-2 was incubated with a 13-fold lower concentration of Mn-PPIX reconstituted ovine COX-1. Mn-PPIX reconstituted ovine COX-1 has full cyclooxygenase activity but only 0.8% of the peroxidase activity of Fe-PPIX reconstituted COX-1 (23Odenwaller R. Maddipati K.R. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13863-13869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Strieder S. Schaible K. Scherer H.-J. Dietz R. Ruf H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13870-13878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, G533A mCOX-2 should be able to use the COX-1-derived PGG2 to increase the rate of tyrosyl radical formation and cyclooxygenase activity. After subtracting the cyclooxygenase activity resulting from COX-1 turnover, it was found that the G533A activity was equivalent to that observed when G533A was incubated with 15 μmH2O2 as an activator. 3B. C. Crews, unpublished observation. These results suggest that the reduced cyclooxygenase activity of the G533A mutant leads to a slower rate of auto-activation. However, even when maximally activated, the cyclooxygenase activity of this mutant is reduced by 80% compared with the wild-type enzyme, and the G533V and G533L mutants are completely inactive. Analysis of the arachidonate/sheep COX-1 model suggests that the most likely reason for the reduced activity is steric hindrance between arachidonate carbon 20 and the introduced side chains at position 533. Therefore, the Gly-533 mutants were compared with wild-type enzyme for their ability to metabolize two fatty acids that are substrates for COX-2 but contain an abstractable hydrogen closer to the ω-end (ω-5 position). It was predicted that these shorter substrates (Fig.4) would not protrude as far into the top channel, thereby reducing the chances of steric clash with the introduced side chain at position 533. To obtain maximal rates and extents of O2 uptake, this study was first performed in the presence of 15 μm H2O2 (TableII). All three Gly-533 mutants were able to oxidize linolenic and stearidonic acid. In fact, G533A was more efficient than wild-type at converting linolenic acid, and both G533A and G533V metabolized more linolenic acid on a molar basis than did the wild-type enzyme. With stearidonic acid, the rate of substrate conversion for G533A was similar to wild-type mCOX-2, but it decreased upon increasing the chain length at position 533 to valine and leucine. As seen with linolenic acid, the total turnover was greater with G533A and G533V than with wild-type. As a control, incubations were performed with linoleic acid, which contains two fewer carbons at the carboxylate end of the substrate but the same number of carbons as arachidonate between its abstractable hydrogen at its ω-end. None of the Gly-533 mutants oxidized linoleic acid.Table IIActivity of H2O2-activated wild-type and Gly-533 mutants with different fatty acid substratesmCOX-2G533AG533VG533Lμmol arachidonic acid/min/mg9.6 ± 0.20.8 ± 0.100μm O2consumed50.7 ± 0.215.3 ± 0.200μmol linoleic acid/min/mg5.3 ± 0.6000μm O2consumed16.7 ± 0.6000μmol linolenic acid/min/mg5.0 ± 0.66.7 ± 0.62.9 ± 0.21.0 ± 0.1μm O2 consumed11.7 ± 0.225.0 ± 0.919.7 ± 0.25.3 ± 0.16μmol stearidonic acid/min/mg6.6 ± 0.36.2 ± 0.12.7 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.1μmO2 consumed15.0 ± 0.525.0 ± 0.521.2 ± 0.310.3 ± 0.2Oxygen consumption was measured in the manner described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fatty acids (100 μm) and H2O2 (15 μm) were added to the oxygraph cell followed by hematin-reconstituted enzyme (150 nm).

Comparison of wild-type mCOX-2 treated with or without 15 μmH2O2 (Tables II and III) showed that the addition of H2O2 had little effect on either the rate or the total substrate conversion. The Gly-533 mutants, in contrast, showed much more dependence on H2O2, as both the rate and amount of substrate converted were reduced in its absence. The addition of 15 μmH2O2 to the reaction was able to reactivate substrate conversion for the Gly-533 mutants.Table IIIActivity of wild-type and Gly-533 mutants with linolenic acid before and after H2O2 additionMutantOxygen consumption with linolenic acidRate with linolenic acidOxygen consumption after H2O2Rate after H2O2μmμmol/min/mgμmμmol linolenic acid/min/mgWild type12.9 ± 0.26.1 ± 0.300G533A5.8 ± 0.41.9 ± 0.216.0 ± 0.61.8 ± 0.3G533V2.5 ± 01.0 ± 0.218.7 ± 0.32.9 ± 0.1G533L006.8 ± 0.30.6 ± 0.1Oxygen consumption was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Linolenic acid (100 μm) and hematin-reconstituted enzyme (150 nm) were added to the oxygraph cell, and oxygen consumption was monitored for 2 min before the addition of H2O2 (15 μm).

We propose a model for the binding of arachidonic acid in the cyclooxygenase active site that is consistent with the chemical mandates for its oxidation to PGG2 and with existing information on its interaction with individual protein residues. The carboxylate of arachidonate is anchored to Arg-120 and Tyr-355 by ionic and hydrogen bonding interactions, respectively (Fig. 2). The substrate backbone then projects upward into the apex of the cyclooxygenase active site where it bends around the 9,10-single bond into anl-shape. Carbon 13 is positioned under Tyr-385 with the 13-pro-S -hydrogen 2.4 Å from the phenolic hydroxyl group. Finally, the ω-end of arachidonate extends above Ser-530 and Leu-534 into the top channel. Maintenance of this l-shaped conformation is essential for generating the dioxobicycloheptane ring of PGG2 with the pendant alkyl chains orientedtrans to each other. Considering the chemical steps necessary to generate PGG2 from the perspective of this structural model suggests that the individual reactions can occur with minimal motion of the bound intermediates. Furthermore, the model predicts the generation of PGG2 with all five stereocenters in the correct absolute configuration, because once the arachidonate is bound as indicated in Fig. 2, the only available space through which O2 can approach the radical intermediates is through the center of the active site channel. Thus, O2 approaches the bound fatty acid from the opposite side from which the 13-pro-S -hydrogen is removed. This antarafacial relationship is consistent with the stereochemistry of PGG2. The key feature of our model is that the ω-end of arachidonate projects into an area of the protein we term the top channel, which is located above Ser-530 and Leu-534. There are two major pieces of experimental information consistent with this hypothesis. The first is that introduction of steric bulk at position 533 by site-directed mutagenesis significantly reduces or completely abolishes the ability of the mutant COX-2s to oxidize arachidonic acid. The loss of oxygenase activity is not due to a major structural change in the proteins, because the peroxidase activity of each of the position 533 mutants is identical to that of wild-type enzyme. Likewise, the loss of activity is not due to an inability of the mutant proteins to activate the cyclooxygenase activity, although activity is stimulated to some extent by addition of H2O2. The second piece of experimental information consistent with a role for the top channel in arachidonate binding is that all of the position 533 mutants are able to oxidize unsaturated fatty acid substrates that contain three less carbons at their ω-end than arachidonate relative to the position of the hydrogen abstracted by the tyrosyl radical of Tyr-385. By contrast, the mutants are unable to oxidize linoleic acid, which contains two fewer carbons on the carboxyl end than arachidonate but the same distance between its abstractable hydrogen and its ω-end. The ability of the Gly-533 mutants to oxidize linolenic and stearidonic acids but not arachidonic or linoleic acids establishes that the distance between the hydrogen abstracted by the tyrosyl radical of Tyr-385 and the ω-end of the fatty acid is an important determinant of COX-fatty acid interactions. Positioning of fatty acids in the top channel may be as important for determining substrate specificity as the positioning of the carboxylate adjacent to Arg-120 at the mouth of the channel. There appears to be flexibility in the distance from the hydrogen abstracted by Tyr-385 to the carboxylate of the fatty acid, especially in the case of COX-2. Substrates with an abstractable hydrogen at the 11, 13, or 14 carbon from the carboxylate are oxidized by COX-2. Laneuville et al. (25Laneuville O. Breuer D.K. Xu N. Huang Z.H. Gage D.A. Watson J.T. Lagarde M. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19330-19336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) have proposed that the substrate adapts to the accessible space between Tyr-385 and Arg-120 by adopting a linear conformation (11-carbon length) or a kinked conformation (13- or 14-carbon lengths). The extra space in the side pocket off the main channel of COX-2 relative to COX-1 may permit the kinking required to accommodate different length substrates. A corollary of the ability of the position 533 mutants to oxidize linolenic and stearidonic acid is that the top channel does not represent part of an exit route to the top surface of the protein. An examination of the crystal structures of both COX-1 and COX-2 indicates that the channel around Gly-533 connects to another channel that eventually leads to an opening on the surface of the protein near the dimer interface (6Kurumbail R.G. Stevens A.M. Gierse J.K. McDonald J.J. Stegeman R.A. Pak J.Y. Gildehaus D. Miyashiro J.M. Penning T.D. Seibert K. Isakson P.C. Stallings W.C. Nature. 1996; 384: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). Conceivably, this opening could represent an exit port through which product escapes the cyclooxygenase active site. Indeed, this could be an explanation for the inability of sterically blocked mutants (e.g. G533V and G533L) to oxidize arachidonic acid. The first molecules of PGG2 synthesized from arachidonic acid would be unable to exit and would prevent the binding of additional molecules of arachidonic acid into the cyclooxygenase active site. However, blocking the exit channel should also prevent the release of the products of linolenic acid and stearidonic acid, thereby stopping turnover. The high activity of the Gly-533 mutants toward these carbon 18 fatty acids eliminates the possibility that the top channel is part of an exit route for products. Our model is consistent with the chemistry of the production of PGG2 from arachidonic acid and with all the currently available site-directed mutagenesis results. Thus, it is likely that this is the conformation by which COX enzymes convert arachidonic acid to its major enzymatic product. This conclusion does not rule out the possibility that arachidonate binds in the cyclooxygenase active site in alternate conformations. For example, arachidonate is oxygenated to a series of hydroxy acids by cyclooxygenase including 11-(S )-HETE, 15-(S )-HETE, and 15-(R )-HETE (15Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5336-5343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lecomte M. Laneuville O. Ji C. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13207-13215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The production of 11-(S )-HETE and 15-(S )-HETE have been assumed to result from O2 trapping of carbon radicals produced following removal of the 13-pro-S- hydrogen. However, 15-(R )-HETE is produced by aspirin-acetylated COX-2 and is likely to arise from an alternate conformation of arachidonic acid (26Lecomte M. Laneuville O. Ji C. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13207-13215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, Xiao et al. (27Xiao G. Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Boyar W.C. Marshall P.J. Kulmacz R.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1836-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) have recently shown that 15-(R )-HETE also can be made by unacetylated COX-2 at high concentrations of arachidonic acid. Thus, 15-(R )-HETE appears to represent an alternate product that results from a less favored substrate conformation. We thank K. Kozak and D. Goodwin for helpful discussions and suggestions."

This report demonstrates that the expansion of (CTG·CAG)n in vivo also occurs by homologous recombination as shown by biochemical and genetic studies. A two-plasmid recombination system was established in Escherichia coli with derivatives of pUC19 (harboring the ampicillin resistance gene) and pACYC184 (harboring the tetracycline resistance gene). The derivatives contained various triplet repeat inserts ((CTG·CAG), (CGG·CCG), (GAA·TTC), (GTC·GAC), and (GTG·CAC)) of different lengths, orientations, and extents of interruptions and a control non-repetitive sequence. The availability of the two drug resistance genes and of several unique restriction sites on the plasmids enabled rigorous genetic and biochemical analyses. The requirements for recombination at the TRS include repeat lengths >30, the presence of CTG·CAG on both plasmids, and recA andrecBC . Sequence analyses on a number of DNA products isolated from individual colonies directly demonstrated the crossing-over and expansion of the homologous CTG·CAG regions.

Neurosci. 1996; 19: 79-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Numerous workers in human genetics have proposed DNA replication, gene conversion, recombination, and related processes as the mechanism(s) responsible for these alterations in repeat sequence lengths. Subsequent in vivo studies in genetically tractable systems (1Wells R.D. Warren S.T. Genetic Instabilities and Hereditary Neurological Diseases.

Similar molecular studiesin vivo on gene conversion and recombination are lacking. Several human genetic studies on patient materials reported haplotype analyses, especially related to myotonic dystrophy (DM) and the fragile X syndrome, which implicated gene conversion and/or unequal crossing-over (types of recombination) to genetic instabilities. In the first report, Korneluk and co-workers (5Tsilfidis C. MacKenzie A.E. Mettler G. Barcelo J. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 6O'Hoy K.L.

This conclusion was derived from haplotype analyses of six polymorphic markers in the DM region. The TRS was presumed to be the site of the discontinuous gene conversion events. Second, Nelson and collaborators (7Van den Ouweland A.M.W. Deelen W.H. Kunst C.B. Uzielli M.-L.G. Nelson D.L. Warren S.T. Oostra B.A. Halley J.J. Hum. Mol.

They described a daughter of a female carrier who inherited the fragile X premutation chromosome based on haplotype analyses using flanking markers. The (CGG·CCG) repeat sequence and the intragenic polymorphic marker FMRb showed the normal maternal alleles, whereas two other intragenic markers showed the risk haplotype. Since the other intragenic markers are located between the markers (CGG·CCG) and FMRb, this results in patches of normal and fragile X sequence in the FMR1 gene of the daughter and was explained on the basis of gene conversion. Likewise, prenatal diagnosis of the fragile X syndrome showed a loss of mutation owing to a double recombinant or gene conversion at the FMR1 locus (8Losekoot M. Hoogendoorn E. Olmer R. Jansen C.C.A.M. Oosterwijk J.C. Van den Ouweland A.M.W. Halley D.J.J. Warren S.T. Willemsen R. Oostra B.A. Bakker E. J. Med. Genet. 1997; 34: 924-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).

Based on these haplotype analyses of nearby markers to the (CGG·CCG) repeats, revertants were discovered in a small percentage of the premutation carrier offspring. Gene conversion (9Brown W.T.

Fourth, homologous recombination involving unequal pairing of sister chromatids leading to the formation of a four-stranded synaptic structure was suggested by Wieringa and co-workers (11Jansen G. Willems P. Coerwinkel M. Nillesen W. Smeets H. Vits L. Howeler C. Brunner H. Wieringa B. Am. Soc. Hum. Genet. 1994; 54: 575-585PubMed Google Scholar) as the mechanism to explain the (CTG·CAG) expansion responsible for gonosomal mosaicism in DM patients. Fifth, Warren (12Warren S.T. Science. 1997; 275: 408-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) interpreted the work of Olsen and co-workers (13Muragaki Y. Mundlos S. Upton J. Olsen B.R. Science. 1996; 272: 548-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) on the polyalanine expansion in synpolydactyly to result from unequal crossing-over in the HOXD13 protein gene and the authors agreed (12Warren S.T.

Several patterns of haplotype variation and linkage disequilibria were explained on the basis of gene conversion events such as unequal sister-chromatid recombination. For these six cases, it was presumed that the TRS were the sites for the recombination (or gene conversion) events. However, for the majority of the instabilities in TRS involved in hereditary neurological diseases, evidence was not available to specifically identify the molecular mechanism(s) of the processes (i.e. replication, recombination, or repair) (reviewed in Ref. 1Wells R.D. Warren S.T. Genetic Instabilities and Hereditary Neurological Diseases. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1998Google Scholar). Some workers (15Richards R.I. Holman K. Kozman H. Kremer E. Lynch M. Pritchard M. Yu S. Mulley J. Sutherland G.R. J. Med. Genet. 1991; 28: 818-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 16Richards R.I. Sutherland G.R. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 7-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 17McMurray C.T. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1995; 104: 2-13PubMed Google Scholar) have supported the concept that recombination is not involved in expansion. During the mapping of the genes for these neurological disorders, substantial linkage analyses were performed utilizing flanking markers, some quite near the repeats. Since the exchange of flanking markers was not generally found (15Richards R.I. Holman K. Kozman H. Kremer E. Lynch M. Pritchard M. Yu S. Mulley J. Sutherland G.R. J. Med. Genet. 1991; 28: 818-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 16Richards R.I. Sutherland G.R. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 7-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), simple homologous recombination, as a general mechanism for expansion, has not been favored. Recently, experiments in yeast have tried to elucidate the independent roles of the RAD50–55 family of genes, which are responsible for various pathways of recombination. CTG·CAG sequences were shown (18Freudenreich C.H. Kantrow S.M. Zakian V.A. Science. 1998; 279: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) to be susceptible to strand breaks, and the occurrence of double-strand breaks was length-dependent. Also, experiments with yeastrad27 strains had augmented instability of the TRS; RAD27 encodes a nuclease involved in Okazaki fragment processing. It is known that the majority of errors that accumulate in rad27 strains are processed via single-strand annealing as well as double-strand break repair (types of recombination) (19Tishkoff D.X. Filosi N. Gaida G.M. Kolodner R.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Herein, we demonstrate that gene conversion or unequal crossing-over with or without exchange of flanking sequences is a powerful mechanism for (CTG·CAG) expansion in Escherichia coli . The plasmids used in these experiments are derivatives of the unidirectionally replicating pUC19 and pACYC184. The cloning and characterization of plasmids containing CTG·CAG, CGG·CCG, and GTC·GAC repeating sequences were described (23Bowater R.P. Rosche W.A. Jaworski A. Sinden R.R. Wells R.D. J. Mol.

All of the CTG·CAG sequences cloned into pUC19 contain no interruptions but the (CTG·CAG)175 cloned in pACYC184 (pRW3239) contains two G-to-A polymorphisms at the 28th and at the 69th repeat as well as 16 bp of human sequence at the proximal end relative to the interruptions and 43 bp distal to the interruptions. pRW3041 containing (CGG·CCG)81 with two interruptions was constructed as follows: a DNA fragment containing (CGG·CCG)81 was isolated from RN2 (46Verkerk A.J.M.H.

All strains were obtained from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center, Yale University, New Haven, CT. Plasmid preparation, agarose gel, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoreses were carried out according to standard laboratory protocols (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Transformations were performed by electroporation (48Hanahan D. Jessee J.

For the cotransformation experiments, each strain was cotransformed with a mixture of the two appropriate plasmids; the plasmids were originally grown in AB10289 which is therecA − strain. Forty microliters of washed cells of each strain (5 × 107 cells/ml) was initially transformed with 1 μl of the supercoiled DNA (0.5 μg/ml) listed in Fig. 1. For the experiments involving cotransformation, cells were prepared for electrotransformation, and the transformation mixture contained various combinations of the pUC19 and pACYC184 derivatives. The supercoiled plasmid volume was equally divided between the two test plasmids. A voltage of 2000 was delivered for 4.1 to 5.8 ms. The cuvette size was 0.2 mm. Cotransformants were selected on LB agar plates containing ampicillin (amp) and tetracycline (tet) since pUC19 and pACYC184, respectively, harbor these drug resistance genes. The cells were allowed to recover in 800 μl of SOC media (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and kept at 37 °C for 1 h or longer. The cells were plated on LB agar that contained ampicillin (75 μg/ml) and tetracycline (12 μg/ml) and grown for 4–16 h at 37 °C. Individual colonies were selected for culture and were grown to mid-logarithmic phase (A 600 = 0.3–0.9, 4–16 h) at 37 °C in LB media containing ampicillin (75 μg/ml) and tetracycline (12 μg/ml) under aerobic conditions. Plasmid purification and gel electrophoresis and analysis were conducted as described (23Bowater R.P. Rosche W.A. Jaworski A. Sinden R.R. Wells R.D. J. Mol.

The plasmid products obtained from recA + strains were quantitated by staining the agarose gels with ethidium bromide and photographed. The amount of DNA in the RB region (defined in Fig. 2) versus the total DNA in the gel lane was determined by quantitating the areas of the negative with a computer densitometer (Molecular Dynamics 400S). The same areas of the gel for the experiments involvingrecA − andrecB−C − strains were also quantitated and used as background and thus were subtracted from the analyses involving recA + strains. The plasmid inserts and flanking sequences were characterized by dideoxy sequencing on both strands with Sequenase (version 2.0). The pACYC184 primers, purchased from Genosys Inc., were the following: primer 4244 (ACGGTCTTTAAAAAGGCCG) which 3′-terminates at map position 95; primer 4245 (CGTCAGTAGCTGAACAGGAGGG) which 3′-terminates at map position 522. The pACT-2 primer was purchased from CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., and was primer GAL4 AD (ACCACTACAATGGATG) which 3′-terminates at map location 5155. Restriction mapping reactions and ligase reactions were conducted as described (25Shimizu M. Gellibolian R. Oostra B.A. Wells R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 614-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The frequency of the survival of amp-tetr colonies due to the presence of the TRS was calculated by counting the number of colonies on LB agar plates containing ampicillin and tetracycline using standard microbiological techniques. pUC19 derivatives and pACYC184 derivatives were transformed into E. coli strains and grown at 37 °C. The number of viable cells was determined by growth in the presence of streptomycin (20 μg/ml). The number of mutant cells was determined by growth in the presence of ampicillin and tetracycline. E. coli AB1157 and JC10289 were washed and diluted to a concentration of 5 × 107 cells/ml and cotransformed with combinations of plasmids as indicated: for example, pUC19 + pRW3239; pRW3080 + pACYC184; or pRW3080 + pRW3239. To evaluate the potential role of homologous recombination in the expansion of TRS, a two-plasmid system was established in E. coli . (The term recombination is used in a general sense and includes gene conversion, unequal crossing-over, and sister chromatid exchange.) For our study, one family of plasmids (Fig. 1) was a derivative of pUC19 (a diminutive form of pBR322) that contains the unidirectional ColE1 origin of replication and harbors the ampicillin resistance gene (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The other family of plasmids was derived from pACYC184 (21Rose R.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 355Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) that harbors the tetracycline resistance gene. A computer search revealed that little or no sequence identity exists between these two vectors; only single copies of identical tracts that were 48, 30, 23, 20, 16, and 12 bp in length were found along with several copies of 9- to 5-bp segments. Thus, the non-identical sequences of these two vectors enabled our focus on the potential effects of cloned tracts of different TRS on recombination. Prior investigations (22Jaworski A. Hsieh W.-T. Blaho J.A. Larson J.E. Wells R.D. Science. 1987; 238: 773-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) revealed the stable cotransformation of derivatives of these two plasmids. To analyze the recombination behavior of these plasmids (Fig. 1), experiments were conducted in three E. coli strains that are isogenic but differ in their recombination capacity. To test the recombination capacity of CTG·CAG repeat sequences, compared with controls, each strain (AB1157, JC10289, and JC5519) was transformed with the parental control vectors pUC19 and pACYC184 that lack TRS. As a second control, each strain was cotransformed with the vector pACYC184 along with various pUC19 derivatives that contained different lengths and types of TRS. Third, the vector pUC19 was cotransformed along with pRW3239 (which contains (CTG·CAG)175). Finally, the three strains were cotransformed with various pUC19 derivatives that contained different lengths and types of TRS along with pRW3239. The only segments of the non-homologous plasmids that had identical sequences were the repeating tracts of (CTG·CAG), (GTC·GAC), (GTG·CAC), (GAA·TTC), (CGG·CCG), and a fragment of phage λ DNA. A strength of this experimental approach is the capacity to select for cells harboring recombinant DNA products that contain both drug resistances and to assay rigorously these products for expansions by restriction mapping and/or DNA sequencing since they contain unique recognition sites. Since the two vectors have different replication origins and copy numbers, exhaustive control studies, described above, were performed followed by analyses of either the supercoiled or linearized DNA which provided confidence of the products formed by recombination. For the 11 control experiments, described above, the CTG·CAG tracts were unchanged in length and/or deletions occurred, as expected (28Kang S. Jaworski A. Ohshima K. Wells R.D. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 29Ohshima K. Kang S. Wells R.D. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2090-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Thus, the differences in the origins of replication and the copy numbers per se did not affect the TRS stability. Fig. 2 shows a typical gel electropherogram of supercoiled plasmids as isolated fromE. coli AB1157, which is recA +. The plasmids used for transformation and cotransformations are listedabove each lane and are depicted on the right . The 1st 5 lanes are controls, and the last lane contains a new product and complete loss of the original transforming DNAs. Considering the singly transformed cells, lane a shows the 1.8-kbp band (monomer supercoiled DNA), whereas the other bands are dimers, trimers, and other multimeric forms of pRW3080. The formation of multimers of plasmids in recA + cells was reported previously (47Bi X. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Since each plasmid is entirely homologous with itself, intraplasmid recombination in arecA + background is expected. Lane b shows the monomer supercoiled form of pRW3239. Its lower copy number precluded the observation of dimers and higher multimers. Note that the size relationship between these control plasmids is as expected. Considering the cotransformed cells, lane c shows the DNA isolated from E. coli AB1157 cotransformed with the vectors pUC19 and pACYC184. This lane shows the supercoiled starting materials, as expected; monomer supercoiled pUC19, at 1.7 kbp, migrated slightly faster than the larger pUC19 derivative, pRW3080 (which contains (CTG·CAG)80 shown in lane a ). Likewise, the dimer of pUC19, the band at 3.9 kbp, migrated slightly faster than the dimer of pRW3080 (at 4.1 kbp). Since the supercoiled vectors were recovered unchanged in size, no recombination occurred between these two DNAs. pACYC184, although not visible on this gel due to its lower copy number, is present since our media contained tetracycline (as well as ampicillin). Lane d shows the results of the cotransformation of pUC19 and pRW3239; the supercoiled monomer of pUC19 is the band at 1.7 kbp (identical to lane c ). The next largest band in lane d is at 3.6 kbp which is the monomer of pRW3239 and comigrates with the molecules found in lane b , as expected. Thus, when one plasmid harbors a TRS, the interaction between the two plasmids is no different than when both vectors, which both lack TRS tracts, are cotransformed intorecA + cells. The identity of the other bands found in lane d is interpreted as for the data inlanes a and c . Lane e shows the results of cotransformation of pRW3080 and pACYC184. The 1.8-kbp band comigrates with the DNA in lane a , as expected. The DNAs found above 1.8 kbp comigrate with the DNAs found in lanes a–d , as described above. Hence, even though the recA system was intact, no new products were detected that could be ascribed to recombination. These results are as expected and are identical to the data obtained from the two-plasmid system when conducted in the 11 control studies with isogenic, but recombination-deficient, strains. Lane f shows the extraordinary result of the formation of large recombinant bands from recA + cells cotransformed with pRW3080 and pRW3239. A loss of the monomer forms of both plasmids and the formation of DNA (∼55% of the total DNA) that migrates in the recombinant band (RB) region is revealed. Hence, comparison of the products in lanes c–e with the products found in lane f (the cotransformation with both plasmids containing the TRS) clearly demonstrates the loss of monomer forms of the starting plasmids and formation via recombination of new recombinant products, which contain both plasmids in various ratios. In addition, homodimers and other homomultimers are visible, as expected, and in some cases represent up to ∼45% of the total DNA. The same experiment conducted in isogenic recombination-deficient strains failed to yield RB and the loss of the plasmid monomers (see “Requirement for Recombination Genes”). The general features revealed in Fig. 2have been found in at least 100 other similar determinations. Not only is the formation of the very long RB products (∼18–40 kbp) extraordinary, but the complete loss of the pRW3080 (and probably also the not visible pRW3239) starting material was dramatic. This result was found even for very short culture times (less than 4 h). Hence, the reaction in vivo to form the RB from the appropriate (CTG·CAG) containing plasmids was very powerful. Furthermore, lane f does not contain a smear of DNA products suggesting that the formation of a discrete series of plasmids may have been triggered by secondary structures within the triplet repeat sequences themselves, as observed for other instabilities (23Bowater R.P.

Wilms' tumor insulin-like growth factor II adenovirus-transformed baby-rat kidney 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole β-galactosidase cytomegalovirus immediate early Wilms' tumor (WT)1 is a pediatric kidney malignancy that affects 1 in 10,000 children and is thought to arise from pluripotent renal stem cells that fail to differentiate properly (1Beckwith J.B. Kiviat N.B. Bonadio J.F. Pediatr. Pathol. 1990; 10: 1-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Mutations in the WT1 gene are found in about 15% of all Wilms' tumors (2Hastie N.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1994; 28: 523-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Consequently,WT1 has been classified as a tumor suppressor gene. In addition to its involvement in Wilms' tumor, the WT1 gene is heterozygously mutated in several syndromes, all of which include malformations of the urogenital system (2Hastie N.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1994; 28: 523-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 3Barbaux S. Niaudet P. Gubler M.C. Grunfeld J.P. Jaubert F. Kuttenn F. Fekete C.N. Souleyreautherville N. Thibaud E. Fellous M. Mcelreavey K. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). An essential role for the WT1 gene product in urogenital development is further underscored by the finding that WT1 knockout mice fail to develop kidneys and gonads (4Kreidberg J.A. Sariola H. Loring J.M. Maeda M. Pelletier J. Housman D. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1993; 74: 679-691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar). In accordance with the phenotype ofWT1 -null mice, expression of WT1 is found mainly in kidneys, ovaries, and testes (5Armstrong J.F. Pritchard-Jones K. Bickmore W.A. Hastie N.D. Bard J.B. Mech. Dev. 1993; 40: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The WT1 gene contains 10 exons and spans about 50 kilobases on chromosome 11p13. Exons 5 and 9 are differentially spliced, ultimately giving rise to four different protein isoforms with molecular masses ranging from 52 to 54 kDa. WT1(−/−) lacks both splice inserts, WT1(+/+) accommodates the 17-amino acid and the 3-amino acid KTS splice inserts, and WT1(+/−) and WT1(−/+) contain either the 17-amino acid or the KTS splice insert (Ref. 6Haber D.A. Sohn R.L. Buckler A.J. Pelletier J. Call K.M. Housman D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9618-9622Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar; see Fig. 1). In addition to these WT1 isoforms, the existence of larger WT1 proteins, which result from translation initiation at an in-frame CUG upstream of the initiator AUG, has been reported (7Bruening W. Pelletier J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8646-8654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). A further level of complexity is added by RNA editing at position 839 of the WT1 mRNA, which replaces leucine 280 in WT1 proteins by proline (8Sharma P.M. Bowman M. Madden S.L. Rauscher III, F.J. Sukumar S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 720-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The WT1 gene may thus produce 16 different protein isoforms. Exons 7–10 of the WT1 gene encode four zinc fingers of the Krüppel type (9Buckler A.J. Pelletier J. Haber D.A. Glaser T. Housman D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1707-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 10Gessler M. Konig A. Bruns G.A. Genomics. 1992; 12: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), which can mediate binding to GC-rich DNA sequences (11Rauscher III, F.J. Morris J.F. Tournay O.E. Cook D.M. Curran T.

Biol. 1995; 15: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). WT1 may, depending on promoter architecture and cell type, repress or stimulate promoter activity. Growth-related genes repressed by WT1 include transforming growth factor-β1 (13Dey B.R. Sukhatme V.P. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Rauscher F.J. Kim S.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), platelet-derived growth factor-A (14Gashler A.L. Bonthron D.T. Madden S.L. Rauscher III, F.J. Collins T. Sukhatme V.P. Proc.

Rauscher III, F.J. Science. 1992; 257: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The minimal transcription activation and repression domains of WT1 have been mapped to two separate regions of WT1 (16Wang Z.Y. Qiu Q.Q. Gurrieri M. Huang J. Deuel T.F. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1243-1247PubMed Google Scholar), and the dimerization domain of WT1 is located within the first 182 amino acids (17Reddy J.C. Morris J.C. Wang J. English M.A. Haber D.A. Shi Y. Licht J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10878-10884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In addition to its function as a transcription factor, WT1 may also be involved in post-transcriptional processing of RNA. WT1 proteins containing the KTS splice insert, which alters the spacing between zinc fingers three and four, preferentially associate with splicing factors (18Larsson S.H. Charlieu J.P. Miyagawa K. Engelkamp D. Rassoulzadegan M. Ross A. Cuzin F. van H.V. Hastie N.D.

Hastie N.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3217-3225Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of WT1 has different effects on cells, including arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (20Kudoh T. Ishidate T. Moriyama M. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4517-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and induction of apoptosis (21Englert C. Hou X. Maheswaran S. Bennett P. Ngwu C. Re G.G. Garvin A.J. Rosner M.R. Haber D.A.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1353-1363PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, WT1 represses the tumorigenicity of several cell lines (23Luo X.N. Reddy J.C. Yeyati P.L. Idris A.H. Hosono S. Haber D.A. Licht J.D. Atweh G.F. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 743-750PubMed Google Scholar, 24Mcmaster M.L. Gessler M. Stanbridge E.J. Weissman B.E.

Oncogene. 1996; 12: 537-546PubMed Google Scholar). In many cases, the effects observed are splice form-dependent. While testing a number of cell lines for WT1 protein expression, we consistently detected novel WT1 isoforms with apparent molecular masses of 36–38 kDa in addition to the 52–54-kDa and larger isoforms of WT1. In this study, we demonstrate that translation initiation at a downstream, in-frame AUG results in synthesis of the novel WT1 proteins. These N-terminally truncated WT1-isoforms can bind to DNA, have transcription-regulatory properties distinct from those of the main forms, and are still capable of inducing apoptosis. Our findings show that WT1 gene expression is even more complex than previously recognized and emphasize that a delicate balance between the different WT1 gene products may be required for proper WT1 function. A pcDNA3.1-WT1(−/−) full-length construct was generated by excising aNot I–Hin cII fragment out of CB6+-WT1(−/−) (30Morris J.F. Madden S.L. Tournay O.E. Cook D.M. Sukhatme V.P. Rauscher III, F.J. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 2339-2348PubMed Google Scholar) and ligating it intoNot I–Eco RV-digested pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The ATG at codon 127 of WT1 was mutated by exchanging a Bsp 120I–Xho I fragment of CB6+-WT1(−/−) for an identical oligonucleotide in which the ATG had been mutated into CTC. The pcDNA3.1 construct pcDNA3.1-WT1(−/−) Bsp, which can only direct synthesis of the smaller isoform of WT1(−/−) was generated by ligating aBsp 120I–Hin cII fragment of WT1(−/−) into pcDNA3.1, generating a WT1(−/−) cDNA which begins 5′ of the second in-frame ATG. The WT1(−/−)-PM construct was made by polymerase chain reaction with primers that were designed to anneal around the first ATG of WT1(−/−) and around codon 256, which was mutated into a stop codon by primer-directed mutagenesis. The polymerase chain reaction product was ligated into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), and this vector was used for in vitro transcription/translation of WT1(−/−)-PM. The luciferase vector containing three WTE consensus sites (5′-GCGTGGGAGT-3′; Ref. 12Nakagama H. Heinrich G. Pelletier J. Housman D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) with spacers of six base pairs in between was made by introducing an oligonucleotide containing these sequences into the Bgl II site of the pBL2-TATA-luciferase reporter (26van Dam H.

The CMV promoter-driven CB6+-WT1(−/−) and CB6+-WT1(+/+) expression vectors and the AdBRK cell lines containing the constructs have been described previously (25Menke A.L.

After transfection, the cells were cultured in selective medium in order to establish polyclonal and monoclonal cell lines expressing CB6+-Neo, CB6+-WT1(−/−), or CB6+-WT1(−/−)ATG. The polyclonal anti-WT1 antibody (C19) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) recognizes the C-terminal 19 amino acids of WT1, and the monoclonal anti-WT1 antibody (H2) from Dako is directed against an epitope within the first 80 amino acids of WT1. The monoclonal anti-LacZ antibody was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Cells were grown to 70% confluence, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in IPB 0.7 buffer (20 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.8, 0.7m NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% deoxycholate) supplemented with inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mg/ml NaF, β-glycerophosphate, Na3VO4, trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mg/ml Na4P2O7). Tumor material was fragmented in liquid nitrogen in a microdismembrator (B. Braun AG) prior to lysis in IPB 0.7. The protein concentration was determined with the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). 50 or 100 μg of each protein sample were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subsequently transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) in ice-cold blotting buffer containing 20% methanol, 20 mmTris, and 150 mm glycine at 300 mA for 3 h. The blots were blocked for 30 min in Tris-buffered saline (10 mmTris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 2% nonfat dry milk (Nutricia) and subsequently incubated for 1 h with the primary antibody, followed by a 30-min incubation with the secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), diluted in the blocking buffer. Protein bands were visualized with the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 3-cm dishes of Epi-7 cells were grown to 70% confluence and rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline. After a 30-min preincubation in methionine-free label medium, the cells were labeled for 2.5 h with 150 μCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Subsequently, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and either lysed immediately in IPB 0.7 or incubated for 1.5–22 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 8% fetal calf serum before lysis in IPB 0.7. Debris was removed, and lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-WT1 antibody (C19) for 4 h at 4 °C and washed four times. Immunocomplexes were boiled in sample buffer and separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gels were incubated in 2,5-diphenyloxazole-Me2SO, washed, and dried before being exposed to x-ray films at −80°. Quantifications were done with the GDS8000 gel documentation and analysis system (Ultra-Violet Products). The various WT1 proteins were in vitro transcribed/translated with the TNT reticulocyte lysate kit (Promega). The electrophoretic mobility shift assay was essentially performed as described previously (31Scharnhorst V. Kranenburg O. Van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G.

Biol. 1995; 15: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) was used as a probe. A nonspecific competitor oligonucleotide containing a p53-binding site was obtained by annealing of 5′-CCGGGCATGTCCGGGCATGTCCGGGC-3′ and 5′-ACATGCCCGGACATGCCCGGACATGC-3′. Reactions were carried out with a 15-min preincubation of the in vitro translated proteins and, where applicable, a competitor oligonucleotide or the H2 antibody at room temperature in a reaction mixture containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 70 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 12% glycerol, 5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm ZnCl2. Subsequently, the labeled probe was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated for a further 30 min at room temperature. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved from the free probe by electrophoresis on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel (19:1 acrylamide:N ,N ′-methylene-bisacrylamide; ICN) in a 1× Tris/glycine-buffered system. 3-cm dishes of U2OS cells were transfected with 1.5 μg of reporter plasmid and 1.2 μg of either pcDNA3.1-WT1(−/−) expression vector or the empty pcDNA3.1 vector for 16 h by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (32van der Eb A.J. Graham F.L. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 826-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Each precipitate was made in triplicate. Cells were washed and incubated with fresh culture medium for another 24 h. Lysates were prepared in cell culture lysis reagent (Promega), and analysis of luciferase activity was carried out in a luminometer (Berthold) following the manufacturer's protocol. Luciferase activities were corrected for protein content of each lysate. Hep3B cells were grown on coverslips and transfected with pcDNA3.1-LacZ alone or in combination with either pcDNA3.1-WT1(−/−) or the shorter isoform of WT1(−/−). Each precipitate contained equal amounts of CMV constructs. The next morning, cells were washed, and new culture medium was added. 5 days later, cells were fixed in 80% acetone, and indirect immunofluorescence was performed as described earlier (31Scharnhorst V. Kranenburg O. Van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 133-143PubMed Google Scholar). LacZ-positive or LacZ- and WT1-double positive cells with weakly DAPI-stained, condensed nuclei were classified apoptotic. At least 100 LacZ-positive or LacZ- and WT1-positive cells were counted. TheWT1 gene is known to be translated from two alternative start sites (see Fig. 1). The four main protein isoforms are translated from the first AUG, giving rise to proteins of molecular masses ranging from 52 to 54 kDa. An in-fame upstream CUG can also serve as a translation initiation site (7Bruening W. Pelletier J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8646-8654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) giving rise to WT1 proteins with a higher molecular mass of 60–62 kDa. All of these isoforms can be detected by the anti-WT1 antibody C19 on Western blots of total cell lysates, as shown in the upper panel in Fig. 2 A . The hatched arrow points to the larger 60–62-kDa proteins, and the black arrow points to the four main isoforms running at 52–54 kDa. The upper panel in Fig. 2 A shows that in addition to these isoforms, smaller WT1 proteins of molecular masses ranging from 36 to 38 kDa can also be identified (indicated by the gray arrow in Fig. 2). In lysates of End-2 and Epi-7 cells, late-passage p530/0 mouse embryo fibroblasts 2Spontaneously immortalized p530/0mouse embryo fibroblasts express WT1; V. Scharnhorst and A. G. Jochemsen, manuscript in preparation., and mouse testes, they appear as a doublet band that most likely represents the presence or absence of the 17-amino acid splice insert. The AdBRK WT1 (−/−) cell line contains a stable integration of the WT1 cDNA which codes for amino acids 1–429. This cDNA thus lacks the upstream CTG and both splice inserts. In lysates of this AdBRK cell line, the main WT1 protein band of 52 kDa and a smaller protein band of 36 kDa are detected by the C19 antibody on a Western blot as shown in Fig. 2 A . The AdBRK WT1(+/+) cell line, which synthesizes WT1 proteins with both splice inserts (+/+ in Fig. 2 A ), contains proteins of molecular masses of approximately 54 and 38 kDa. As expected, no WT1 isoforms were detected in AdBRK cells transfected with the empty expression vector (vector in Fig. 2 A ). The novel 36- and 38-kDa WT1 proteins were not detected with the monoclonal anti-WT1 antibody H2 directed against an epitope in the first 80 amino acids of WT1 (lower panel in Fig. 2 A ). To test whether the smaller isoforms of WT1 are also present in human cells, we probed a Western blot prepared from lysates of Wilms' tumors with the anti-WT1 antibody C19. Fig. 2 B demonstrates that both the main (black arrow ) and the smaller (gray arrow ) WT1 isoforms are detectable in Wilms' tumor lysates by Western blotting. Out of five tumors tested, two clearly contained the smaller WT1 proteins. In order to investigate whether the 36–38-kDa WT1 protein forms are generated through translation initiation from the downstream, in-frame AUG (see Fig. 1), we transfected AdBRK cells with a WT1(−/−) cDNA and with a WT1(−/−) cDNA in which the ATG codon at position 127 had been mutated into CTC. Stable cell lines of these transfectants were established. Fig. 3 shows that a polyclonal cell line transfected with wild-type WT1 cDNA (Fl PC ) contains both the main WT1 (−/−) form of 52 kDa and the smaller WT1 (−/−) form of 36 kDa, while the polyclonal and monoclonal transfectants carrying the mutant WT1 cDNA ( ATG PC/MC ) contain the main isoform only. The control lane (+) contains lysate of U2OS cells transiently transfected with a WT1(−/−) expression plasmid, which can direct synthesis of the 36-kDa isoform of WT1 only. Immunofluorescence data demonstrated that after transfection the smaller isoform of WT1(−/−) is exclusively localized in the nucleus (data not shown). These data show that additional isoforms of WT1 with an approximate molecular mass of 36–38 kDa exist, which arise as a result of internal translation initiation at the second AUG of the WT1 open reading frame. Next, we wanted to characterize the properties of the smaller WT1 isoforms in comparison with the main forms. In order to determine the half-life of the different WT1 forms, Epi-7 cells were labeled with [35S]methionine for 2.5 h followed by chase periods of 0–22 h. Fig.4 A shows an autoradiogram of Epi-7 cells that had been chased for different time periods prior to lysis and anti-WT1 immunoprecipitation. The relative radioactivity of the main and smaller WT1 proteins was quantified and set out against the chase time, and the half-lives were determined (Fig.4 B ). The main and smaller WT1 protein forms have similar half lives, with 2 h 15 min for the main and 2 h 40 min for the smaller isoforms (mean of three experiments). WT1 proteins have previously been shown to bind several DNA consensus sequences in electrophoretic mobility shift assay (11Rauscher III, F.J. Morris J.F. Tournay O.E. Cook D.M. Curran T. Science. 1990; 250: 1259-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 12Nakagama H. Heinrich G. Pelletier J. Housman D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 33Little M. Holmes G. Bickmore W. van Heyningen V. Hastie N. Wainwright B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To characterize the DNA binding properties of the different WT1 protein forms, WT1 cDNAs were transcribed and translated in vitro and subsequently tested in electrophoretic mobility shift assays with the EGR-1 (11Rauscher III, F.J. Morris J.F. Tournay O.E. Cook D.M. Curran T. Science. 1990; 250: 1259-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar) and WTE oligonucleotide (12Nakagama H. Heinrich G. Pelletier J. Housman D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) as probes. Fig.5 A shows a Western blot of thein vitro translated WT1 proteins used in this assay. All of these WT1 proteins lack the 17-amino acid and the KTS splice inserts. The WT1-PM mutant was isolated from a patient with Denys-Drash syndrome (34Baird P.N. Santos A. Groves N. Jadresic L. Cowell J.K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1992; 1: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and, due to a premature stop at amino acid 256, lacks all four zinc fingers. In vitro translated WT1(−/−) and the smaller isoform of WT1(−/−) (lanes Fl and Bsp in Fig.5 B ) bind to the radioactive EGR-1 oligonucleotide and resolve at different positions on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, probably due to their different molecular weights. The addition of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled EGR-1 probe to the reaction mixture abolishes DNA binding by both WT1 isoforms, whereas a nonspecific oligonucleotide does not influence formation of the DNA-protein complexes (lane nonsp.c. ). Next, we tested for the binding of in vitro translated WT1(−/−) and the smaller isoform of WT1(−/−) to the WTE oligonucleotide. 1, 2, and 4 μl of either WT1 (lanes Fl ) or the smaller WT1 isoform (lanes Bsp ) were added to the reaction mixture. Fig. 5 B reveals that in vitro translated WT1(−/−) and the smaller isoform of WT1(−/−) bind to the radioactive WTE oligonucleotide with approximately equal affinity. Similar to their binding pattern to the EGR-1 probe, they resolve at different positions on a polyacrylamide gel, probably due to their different molecular weights. The binding of WT1 to the WTE oligonucleotide is specific, since the WT1-DNA complexes are completely competed out by a 100-fold excess of unlabeled WTE probe (lane comp .), while a nonspecific competitor (lane nonsp .c .) does not affect the WT1-WTE complex. It is known that WT1 proteins can homodimerize (17Reddy J.C. Morris J.C. Wang J. English M.A. Haber D.A. Shi Y. Licht J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10878-10884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutant WT1 proteins, which cannot bind to DNA but still dimerize with WT1, diminish transcription activation by WT1 (17Reddy J.C. Morris J.C. Wang J. English M.A. Haber D.A. Shi Y. Licht J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10878-10884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wanted to test whether heterodimerization between full-length WT1 and the shorter isoform of WT1 on DNA occurs, which may ultimately lead to altered transcription regulation. Increasing amounts of the smaller isoform were preincubated with a constant amount of full-length WT1(−/−) prior to the addition of the WTE oligonucleotide. The shorter isoform-probe complex clearly intensifies with increasing amounts of protein added, while no change in the WT1(−/−)-probe complex is detectable. This finding indicates that no heterodimerization of full-length WT1(−/−) and the smaller isoform takes place under these conditions. This notion is further supported by the observation that in vitro co-translated full-length and smaller WT1(−/−) proteins also form two distinct complexes (Fl + Bsp in Fig. 5 B ). The upper complex, containing full-length WT1, is supershifted to a discrete position by the addition of an anti-WT1 antibody directed toward an epitope in the first 80 amino acids of WT1 (lane H2 in Fig. 5 B ), while the lower molecular weight complex remains unaffected. To investigate whether the lack of dimerization between WT1(−/−) and the shorter isoform is caused by the absence of most of the self-association domain in the shorter isoform (see Fig. 1), WT1-PM was used. This WT1 mutant lacks the zinc fingers and cannot bind to the WTE oligonucleotide by itself (lane PM in Fig. 5) but can still dimerize to WT1 in a GST pull-down assay (17Reddy J.C. Morris J.C. Wang J. English M.A. Haber D.A. Shi Y. Licht J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10878-10884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). WT1-PM was preincubated together with WT1(−/−) prior to the addition of the probe. If dimerization was a prerequisite for DNA binding, excessive amounts of WT1-PM should abrogate DNA binding by WT1(−/−). However, Fig. 5 B shows that preincubation of WT1(−/−) with increasing amounts of WT1-PM neither abrogates the binding of WT1(−/−) to the probe nor alters the position of the DNA-protein complex, suggesting that dimerization is not required for DNA binding by WT1. Thus, both the full-length and the novel, shorter form of WT1(−/−) may bind DNA as monomers, and the difference in migration observed in electrophoretic mobility shift assay is due to the difference in protein weight rather than lack of dimerization of the shorter WT1 forms. WT1 has been shown to act as a transcription factor, which, depending on promoter context and cell type, can either activate or repress transcription of reporter constructs. To assess the transcription regulation properties of the smaller WT1(−/−) isoform and the main WT1(−/−) form, we constructed a luciferase reporter construct with a minimal promoter containing three WTE consensus sequences followed by a TATA box in front of the luciferase gene.

An extensive panel of site-directed mutant IgAs was used to identify IgA residues critical for FcαR (CD89) binding and triggering. Although a tailpiece-deleted IgA1 was able to bind and trigger CD89, antibodies featuring CH3 domain exchanges between human IgA1 and IgG1 could not, indicating that both domains but not the tailpiece are required for FcαR recognition. To further investigate the role of the interdomain region, numerous IgA1s, each with a point substitution in either of two interdomain loops (Leu-257—Gly-259 in Cα2; Pro-440—Phe-443 in Cα3), were generated. With only one exception (G259R), substitutions produced either ablation (L257R, P440A, A442R, F443R) or marked reduction (P440R) in CD89 binding and triggering. Further support for involvement of these interdomain loops was provided by interspecies comparisons of IgA. Thus a human IgA1 mutant, LA441–442MN, which mimicked the mouse IgA loop sequence through substitution of two adjacent residues in the Cα3 loop, was found, like mouse IgA, not to bind CD89. In contrast, bovine IgA1, identical to human IgA1 within these interdomain loops despite numerous differences elsewhere in the Fc region, did bind CD89. We have thus identified motifs in the interdomain region of IgA Fc critical for FcαR binding and triggering, significantly enhancing present understanding of the molecular basis of the IgA-FcαR interaction.

Fcα receptor Chinese hamster ovary polymerase chain reaction 3-nitro-4-hydroxy-5-iodophenylacetate phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 bovine serum albumin Human IgA is both a major serum immunoglobulin and the most abundant antibody class in seromucous secretions (1Kerr M.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The mucosal surfaces bathed by these secretions, such as those of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts, are major potential sites of invasion due to their vast surface area. IgA therefore serves as a key first line of defense against many invading pathogens. Like all antibodies, IgA is capable of both recognizing the foreign invader and triggering its elimination. The latter process is frequently mediated by the interaction of the Fc region of IgA with Fcα receptors (FcαR)1 present on the surface of neutrophils, macrophages, monocytes, and eosinophils (2Morton H.C. van Egmond M. van de Winkel J.G.J. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 16: 423-440PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kerr M.A. Woof J.M. Ogra P.L. Mestecky J. Lamm M.E. Strober W. McGhee J.R. Bienenstock J. Mucosal Immunology. 2nd Ed. Academic Press Inc., San Diego1998: 213-224Google Scholar). The human myeloid FcαR, CD89, possesses two extracellular Ig-like domains and displays homology to the three classes of human IgG Fc receptors (FcγRI, FcγRII and FcγRIII) and the high affinity IgE receptor FcεRI, albeit at a lower level than these receptors do to each other (4Maliszewski C.R. March C.J. Schoenborn M.A. Gimpel S. Shen L. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Interaction of CD89 with IgA, aggregated either by binding to antigen or artificially, acts as a potent trigger for an array of myeloid cell functions including phagocytosis, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, superoxide generation, enzyme and inflammatory mediator release, and clearance of immune complexes (3Kerr M.A. Woof J.M. Ogra P.L. Mestecky J. Lamm M.E. Strober W. McGhee J.R. Bienenstock J. Mucosal Immunology. 2nd Ed. Academic Press Inc., San Diego1998: 213-224Google Scholar). A detailed understanding of the molecular basis of the IgA-FcαR interaction is clearly important if the increasingly appreciated potential of recombinant IgA in numerous therapeutic applications (5Ma J.K.-C.

Capra J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8348-8352Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and plant cells (5Ma J.K.-C. Hikmat B.Y. Wycoff K. Vine N.D. Chargelegue D. Yu L. Hein M.B. Lehner T. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 601-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), we have expressed hapten-specific recombinant human IgA of both subclasses, IgA1 and IgA2, in mammalian cell hosts (9Morton H.C. Atkin J.D. Owens R.J. Woof J.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4743-4752PubMed Google Scholar, 10Atkin J.D. Pleass R.J. Owens R.J. Woof J.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar, 11Krugmann S. Pleass R.J. Atkin J.D. Woof J.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 244-249PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we have used an extensive panel of chimeric and site-directed mutant IgAs expressed in CHO K1 cells to identify residues critical for FcαR binding. We have constructed domain swap antibodies through exchange of the homologous C-terminal CH3 domains between human IgA1 and IgG1 in order to ascertain the contribution of each Fc domain to the interaction with FcαR. An IgA1 lacking the C-terminal 18 amino acid tailpiece has also been assayed for ability to bind the receptor. To allow more precise localization of the interaction site, a number of IgA1 mutants with single substitutions in loop regions lying at the interface of the CH2 and CH3 domains have been generated. The effects of such mutations on the ability to bind FcαR are consistent with the interdomain region of the Fc playing a critical role in binding to the receptor. Further support for this proposal is lent through correlation of the binding ability of IgAs derived from other species with sequence differences in these loops. To more readily assess receptor interaction, we have developed stable CHO cell transfectants expressing high levels of CD89, which have allowed, for the first time, comparison of the relative binding affinities of the different IgA molecules. As an additional, more physiologically relevant test for function, we have also assessed the ability of the antibodies to elicit a respiratory burst in neutrophils. The combined use of these receptor systems with targeted mutagenesis of IgA has facilitated identification of motifs on human IgA critical for interaction with FcαR and subsequent triggering via the receptor, further dissecting the molecular basis of this important antibody-receptor interaction. Chimeric IgG/IgA vectors were constructed by PCR overlap extension mutagenesis (12Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2614) Google Scholar) using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and plasmid vectors containing wild-type human IgG1 γ chain and IgA1 α chain genes as templates, as described previously (10Atkin J.D. Pleass R.J. Owens R.J. Woof J.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar, 11Krugmann S. Pleass R.J. Atkin J.D. Woof J.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 244-249PubMed Google Scholar). In each case, the mutated PCR products were ligated into unique restriction sites in the expression vectors, replacing the wild-type sequence in the appropriate region. To facilitate this approach, appropriate flanking primers were used throughout. For domain swap experiments, a 5′-flanking primer, which anneals 5′ of a uniqueXho I site in the α chain vector, has been described previously (10Atkin J.D. Pleass R.J. Owens R.J. Woof J.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the α chain 3′ primer (5′-CGCGCGCGGAATTCCTCACACCAGCGAGGCC-3′) annealed at ∼240 base pairs downstream of the stop codon and incorporated an Eco RI site. For the γ chain, the 5′-flanking primer (5′-AGGACTCTACTCCCTCAGCAGC-3′) annealed 5′ of a uniqueBst EII site in the Cγ1 exon, whereas the 3′-flanking primer (5′-ATACACGGTGTCGACGCTTTATTTCCATGCTG-3′) annealed at ∼100 base pairs 3′ of the stop codon and incorporated a Sal I site. For the domain swap antibody α1α2γ3 (constant domain structure Cα1, Cα2, Cγ3) internal primers 5′-TCTCAAAATCCGGGCAGCCCCGAG-3′ and its complement incorporated sequences complementary to the 3′ end of Cα2 (in bold) and the 5′ end of Cγ3, allowing fusion of the two gene segments. Similarly, for γ1γ2α3 (constant domain structure Cγ1, Cγ2, Cα3), internal primer 5′-CCAAAGCCAAAGGAAACACATTCC-3′ (sequence complementary to α chain in bold) and its complement allowed fusion of Cγ2 to Cα3. IgA1 mutants were created by similar means using wild-type IgA1 vector as the template and the 5′ α chain-flanking primer as above with a previously described 3′-flanking primer annealing 3′ of a uniqueSal I site (10Atkin J.D. Pleass R.J. Owens R.J. Woof J.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar). For mutant P440R, internal mismatch primer 5′-CGAGGCCCTGCGGCTGGCCTTCA-3′ and its complement were used to incorporate a CCG to CGG substitution, whereas for mutant P440A, in which the same Pro residue is replaced by Ala, primer 5′-ACGAGGCCCTGGCGCTGGCCTTC-3′ and its complement were used. Mutant A442R was generated using internal primer 5′-CCCTGCCGCTGAGATTCACACAGAA-3′ and its complement. Similarly, mutant F443R resulted from use of internal mismatch primer 5′-TGCCGCTGGCCCGCACACAGAAGA-3′ and its complement to introduce a TTC to CGC substitution. For mutant LA441–442MN, in which the codons for residues Leu-441 and Ala-442 were replaced, respectively, by those for the Met and Asn present at these positions in mouse IgA, internal primer 5′-GAGGCCCTGCCGATGAACTTCACACAGAA-3′ and its complement were used. For mutant L257R, only a single round of PCR amplification using mismatch primer 5′-ACCGGCCCTCGAGGACCTGCGCTTAGGTTC-3′ (incorporating in bold a CTC to CGC substitution and the uniqueXho I site) and 3′-flanking primer was required. Similarly for mutant G259R, a single PCR amplification using primer 5′-ACCGGCCCTCGAGGACCTGCTCTTACGTTCAGAAG-3′ (incorporating a GGT to CGT substitution and the Xho I site) and the 3′-flanking primer was needed to generate the mutant fragment. A mammalian expression vector for an IgA/IgG domain swap antibody containing an additional mutation was also created by PCR overlap extension using a domain swap IgG/IgA expression construct as template and the same flanking primers as those used originally to generate the domain swap. Thus, in mutant α1α2γ3PLAF, replacement of residues His-433, Asn-434, His-435, and Tyr-436 (Eu numbering (13Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Reid-Miller M. Perry H. Gottesman K.S.

C.1987Google Scholar)) of the Cγ3 domain of the parent α1α2γ3 construct by the Pro, Leu, Ala, Phe motif present at the equivalent position in the Cα3 domain of IgA1 was achieved using internal primer 5′-GCATGAGGCTCTGCCCCTCGCCTTCACGCAGAAGAGCC-3′ and its complement. To verify incorporation of the desired mutations and check for PCR-induced errors, the entire PCR-amplified regions of all the expression vectors were sequenced using the dideoxy chain termination method (14Chen E.Y. Seeburg P.H. DNA (N. Y.). 1985; 4: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). All the expression vectors contain the mouse Vnp variable domain gene to aid in the purification and analysis of expressed antibodies and the bacterial xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase selectable marker to allow isolation of positive transfectants. A 2.4-kilobase Sac II-Xba I fragment containing the bovine α gene, isolated from a plasmid kindly provided by Professor K. Knight (15Knight K.L. Suter M. Becker R.S. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 3654-3659PubMed Google Scholar), was subcloned into pBluescript SK (Stratagene, Cambridge, UK). The resultant plasmid was used as a template for PCR using primer 5′-CGCGCGCGGGATCCCCGCGGGGCCGTCAGGGGTCC-3′, which anneals at ∼60 base pairs 5′ of the Cα1 domain and incorporates a Bam HI site, and T3 primer, which anneals outside a Bam HI site in pBluescript. The amplified fragment was inserted into a Bam HI site downstream of a Vnp domain in the expression vector (9Morton H.C. Atkin J.D. Owens R.J. Woof J.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4743-4752PubMed Google Scholar) and sequenced as above. CHO K1 cells were maintained as described previously (9Morton H.C. Atkin J.D. Owens R.J. Woof J.M. J.

Atkin J.D. Owens R.J. Woof J.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4743-4752PubMed Google Scholar). Positive transfectants were selected in growth medium supplemented with hypoxanthine and thymidine (HT supplement; Life Technologies, Inc.), xanthine (0.25 mg/ml), and mycophenolic acid (10 μg/ml). Resistant colonies were picked, and cell lines producing the highest yields of antibody were identified using an antigen (NIP) binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (9Morton H.C. Atkin J.D. Owens R.J. Woof J.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4743-4752PubMed Google Scholar) before expansion into bulk culture. Stable transfectants for mutant IgA1 antibodies C311S (a Cys to Ser substitution at residue 311), N263A (a Asn to Ala substitution at residue 263 resulting in loss ofN -glycan acceptor site), and PTerm455 (the codon for Pro-455, the first residue of the tailpiece, is replaced with a stop codon, thus deleting the entire tailpiece) have been described previously (10Atkin J.D.

Recombinant antibodies were purified from supernatants of CHO K1 transfectants as described previously, by affinity chromatography on NIP-Sepharose (9Morton H.C. Atkin J.D. Owens R.J. Woof J.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4743-4752PubMed Google Scholar). Affinity-purified antibodies were analyzed on 8.4% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels under reducing and nonreducing conditions. For Western blotting, recombinant human wild-type IgA1 and/or IgG1 were used as controls. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, which were then blocked by incubating at room temperature for 1 h in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) and 5% nonfat milk powder. After three washes in PBST, blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in appropriate anti-human Ig antibodies diluted 1:500 in PBST. For mutant human IgA1 antibodies, goat anti-human IgA (α chain-specific) (A-7032; Sigma) or sheep anti-human IgA Fc (Serotec, Oxford, U.K.) peroxidase conjugates were used. For chimeric IgA/IgG antibodies, goat anti-human IgG (γ chain-specific) peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) and mouse anti-human IgG (Cγ3 domain-specific) (Serotec) were also used. For the latter, after three washes in PBST, an additional incubation step in sheep anti-mouse IgM peroxidase conjugate (Serotec) was performed. After three washes in PBST followed by two with PBS, substrate (a mixture of 10 mg of diaminobenzidine, 3 mg of NiCl2, and 100 μl of 30% H2O2 in 10 ml of PBS) was added, and the blot was allowed to develop for 1- 5 min. A full-length CD89 cDNA derived from THP-1 cells in the pcDNA3 vector (17Pleass R.J. Andrews P.D. Kerr M.A. Woof J.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) was subcloned as aBst XI-Xba I fragment into pBluescript KS and subsequently as a Eco RI fragment into a derivative of the mammalian cell expression vector pEE6.HCMV (18Whittle N. Adair J. Lloyd C. Jenkins L. Devine J. Schlom J. Raubitschek A. Colcher D. Bodmer M. Prot. Eng. 1987; 1: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing revealed that the sequence was identical with previously cloned full-length FcαR cDNA (17Pleass R.J. Andrews P.D. Kerr M.A. Woof J.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). CHO K1 cells were transfected with the plasmid as above, and after selection for the guanine phosphoribosyltransferase marker, resistant colonies were picked. Cell lines expressing the highest levels of CD89 were selected by reactivity with the anti-FcαR monoclonal antibody A77, assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy as described previously (17Pleass R.J. Andrews P.D. Kerr M.A. Woof J.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). High levels of mRNA for the receptor were confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR. A final selection was based on the ability of a high percentage of cells to form rosettes with IgA1-coated erythrocytes as below. Human erythrocytes were derivatized by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with 200 μg/ml NIP-caproate-O -succinimide (Genosys, Cambridge, UK) in isotonic borate buffer, pH 8.5, washed three times with PBS, and sensitized with up to 500 μg/ml wild-type IgA, mutant IgA1, chimeric IgA/IgG, or mutant chimeric IgA/IgG antibodies, making use of their specificity for the hapten NIP, as described previously (19Walker M.R. Kumpel B.M. Thompson K. Woof J.M. Burton D.R. Jefferis R. Vox Sang. 1988; 55: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Coating levels for each antibody were found to be equivalent by reactivity with anti-λ light chain fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (Nordic Immunological Laboratories, Tilburg, The Netherlands) as assessed by flow cytometry. Neutrophils were isolated as described previously (17Pleass R.J. Andrews P.D. Kerr M.A. Woof J.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) from heparinized blood taken from healthy volunteers. CHO K1 cells transfected with full-length CD89 were released from tissue culture flasks with trypsin/EDTA (Life Technologies), washed twice in PBS, and resuspended at 1 × 106 cells/ml. Rosetting of sensitized erythrocytes to CD89 transfectants or to neutrophils was performed as previously described (19Walker M.R. Kumpel B.M. Thompson K. Woof J.M. Burton D.R. Jefferis R. Vox Sang. 1988; 55: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A rosette was defined as an effector cell surrounded by three or more erythrocytes. Wells of a chemiluminescence microtiter plate (Dynatech Laboratories, Billinghurst, Sussex, UK) were coated with 150 μl of 10 μg/ml NIP-BSA in PBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After washing three times with PBS, 150 μl of diluted antibody (50 μg) were added in triplicate to the wells and left overnight at 4 °C. After washing as before, 100 μl of luminol (67 μg/ml in Hanks' buffered saline solution (HBSS) containing 20 mm HEPES and 0.1 g/100 ml globulin-free BSA (HBSS/BSA)) were added to each well. After the addition of 50 μl of neutrophils (106/ml in HBSS/BSA) to each well, the plate was transferred to a Microlumat LB96P luminometer, and the chemiluminescence was measured at regular intervals for 1 h. DNA sequence analysis confirmed that the desired domain swaps/mutations had been correctly incorporated into each expression vector and that no misincorporations had occurred. After expression in CHO K1 cells and hapten affinity purification, the intregrity and purity of each antibody was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For each antibody produced, reactivity with specific antibodies both in solution (in hapten binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays) and on nitrocellulose filters (on Western blots) confirmed that introduction of mutations had affected neither antigen binding ability nor epitope recognition, suggesting that no gross conformational changes had been introduced. Fig.1 shows Western blotting results with wild-type IgA1 (lanes 1 , 4 , and 7 ), domain swap γ1γ2α3 (lanes 2 , 5 , and8 ), and domain swap α1α2γ3 (lanes 3 ,6 , and 9 ) as typical examples. Although all three are reactive with anti-IgA (lanes 1–3 ) and the two domain swap antibodies also react with anti-IgG (lanes 5 and6 ), only the α1α2γ3 is recognized by an anti-Cγ3-specific antibody (lane 9 ), confirming that the desired domain switches had been made. The ability of the domain swap antibodies, γ1γ2α3 and α1α2γ3, and the tailpiece-deleted mutant PTerm455 to interact with CD89 was assessed by rosetting both with neutrophils and with CD89 transfectants (Fig.2). Wild-type IgA1 and wild-type IgG1 mediated rosette formation with neutrophils presumably via the constitutively expressed FcαR and FcγRII/FcγRIII, respectively, since no rosettes formed in the absence of coating antibody. However, the two domain swap antibodies, each coated on erythrocytes at comparable levels with wild-type antibody, were unable to mediate rosette formation. The tailpiece-deleted mutant, in contrast, appeared similar to or slightly more effective than wild-type IgA1 at rosette formation when coated at comparable levels. Similar results were obtained using the CD89 transfectants, with the exception that wild-type IgG1 did not bind these cells, since they express only FcαR and not FcγR. To investigate the relationship between FcαR recognition and triggering of FcαR-mediated cellular responses, we studied the capacity of the antibodies to trigger a neutrophil respiratory burst. The oxidative burst is a biologic response of major importance in both host defense and in inflammatory diseases. The ability of the antibodies to mediate rosette formation via FcαR was found to correlate very well with their capacity to trigger a respiratory burst in neutrophils when presented in an aggregated form on a hapten-coated surface (Fig. 3). Hence, although wild-type IgA1 and PTerm455 both elicited strong respiratory bursts, as measured by luminol chemiluminescence, the two domain swap antibodies did not produce significant bursts. Furthermore, we have shown earlier that the mutant N263A, which lacks the N -linked sugar moieties normally attached to the Cα2 domain, binds CD89 with affinity comparable with that of wild-type IgA1 (16Mattu T.S. Pleass R.J. Willis A.C. Kilian M. Wormald M.R. Lellouch A.C. Rudd P.M. Woof J.M. Dwek R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2260-2272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Here, our results show that N263A triggers a burst comparable with that of wild-type IgA1 (Fig. 3), reaffirming the correlation between binding to CD89 and ability to trigger the neutrophil respiratory burst. Our results suggest that the presence of regions in both the Cα2 and Cα3 domains of IgA is required for efficient interaction with CD89 and for triggering via this receptor. Our earlier results showed that both N263A and IgA1 mutant C311S, in which Cys-311 lying on the surface of Cα2 is changed to Ser, bound to CD89 with affinity comparable with wild-type IgA1 (11Krugmann S. Pleass R.J. Atkin J.D. Woof J.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 244-249PubMed Google Scholar, 16Mattu T.S. Pleass R.J. Willis A.C. Kilian M. Wormald M.R. Lellouch A.C. Rudd P.M. Woof J.M. Dwek R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2260-2272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that neither residue 263 and the carbohydrate attached to it nor residue 311 are directly involved in interaction with CD89. It is likely, therefore, that regions of the Cα2 domain other than those proximal to these residues form the receptor interaction site. Furthermore, the presence of the tailpiece is not essential for FcαR recognition or triggering, indicating that part of the Cα3 globular domain itself must be required for efficient FcαR binding. Since a clear requirement for both domains of IgA Fc in FcαR binding had been established, we chose to determine if the interdomain region might be directly involved in interaction with the receptor. We generated a panel of IgA1 antibodies, each with a single amino acid substitution in either of two interdomain loops, comprising Leu-257—Gly-259 in the Cα2 domain and Pro-440—Phe-443 in the Cα3 domain. Molecular modeling (20Boehm M.K. Woof J.M. Kerr M.A. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1421-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) suggests that these loops essentially occupy the analogous position to the Staphylococcus aureus protein A binding site on human IgG (Fig. 4). In our mutagenesis, we generally used Arg substitution since conversion to this bulky side chain in a critical residue was thought likely to be sufficient to ablate rosetting. Indeed, it served as a mimic of the Arg seen in human IgG3 m{5} and {21} allotypes at position 435 in the protein A site (Fig. 4). These allotypes do not bind protein A, whereas the IgG3 m{15,16} allotype with His at this position does bind protein A. Model building (21Deisenhofer J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2361-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar) has indicated that the lengthy side chain of arginine prevents favorable IgG-protein A contact formation, thereby resulting in the inability of such IgG3 molecules to bind protein A. We also made amino acid alignments of IgAs from different species and discovered that mouse IgA, previously found not to bind human FcαR, 2M. A. Kerr and W. W. Stewart, personal communication. differed from human IgA1 at only two residues in the two loops of interest (Fig. 4). Therefore we generated a human IgA1 mutant, termed LA441–442MN, which through replacement of Leu-Ala with Met-Asn at positions 441–442, mimicked mouse IgA in these two loops. In addition, we expressed bovine IgA1, since this antibody is identical to human IgA1 within these two interdomain loops (Fig. 4), despite numerous differences elsewhere in the Fc region. When this panel of antibodies was assessed for ability to form rosettes via CD89 on either neutrophils or CD89 transfectants, we found that the majority of point substitutions in the two loops resulted in loss of ability to bind the receptor on either neutrophils or the CD89 transfectants (Table I), suggesting that these two loops do contribute to FcαR binding. Only two of the IgA1 point mutants remained capable of mediating rosette formation, namely G259R and P440R. G259R exhibited an ability to form rosettes similar to that of wild-type IgA1, forming comparable numbers of rosettes with CD89 transfectants when coated to the same level on derivatized erythrocytes (Fig. 5), indicating that substitution at this residue did not perturb the IgA-FcαR interaction to any appreciable extent. Half-maximal rosette formation was seen for both wild-type IgA1 and G259R at coating concentrations of around 50 μg/ml. P440R, however, had a reduced ability to form rosettes with the transfectants, with half-maximal rosette formation with CD89 transfectants seen at coating concentrations of around 250 μg/ml. Substitution of Arg for Pro at residue 440 therefore results in an apparent reduction in affinity of the interaction by approximately 5-fold. Interestingly, conversion of the same residue to Ala, with its smaller side chain, rendered the mutant P440A unable to form rosettes. Hence, residue 440 also appears to contribute in some way to the conformation of the receptor site on IgA, with certain residues serving as better substitutes for Pro at this position than others.Table IRosette formation with CD89-bearing cells mediated by IgA antibodiesAntibodyRosette formation with CD89NeutrophilsCD89 transfectantsWild-type IgA1++L257R−−G259R++P440A−−P440R++A442R−−F443R−−LA441–442MN−−Bovine IgA++α1α2γ3PLAF−−Each antibody was coated at essentially equivalent levels onto RBC.

The hFOG-2 gene was initially detected in K562 cells using a polymerase chain reaction approach with degenerate primers corresponding to zinc finger regions of mFOG-1. A murine homologue of hFOG-2 was also identified in the mouse expressed sequence tag data banks, indicating that a family of FOG genes exists in mammals. hFOG-2 appears to be widely expressed, while mFOG-1 is expressed primarily in erythroid and megakaryocytic cells and plays a fundamental role in the development of these lineages. Sequencing of the full-length hFOG-2 cDNA indicates that the interaction domains for transcription factors GATA-1 and mCtBP2 are both conserved and we have shown that this new FOG protein also physically interacts with these factors. We have demonstrated that hFOG-2, like mFOG-1, can act in concert with GATA-1 to activate gene expression from the p45 NF-E2 promoter region, but that it can also act to repress GATA-mediated activation of additional reporter constructs. Finally, we have identified a repression domain in hFOG-2 and show that repression is dependent upon the integrity of the mCtBP2 interaction motif Pro-Ile-Asp-Leu-Ser.

Friend-of-GATA fetal bovine serum polymerase chain reaction rapid amplification of cDNA ends kilobase pair(s) glutathioneS -transferase growth hormone GATA-1 is the founding member of the GATA family of transcription factors that bind to (T/A)GATA(A/G) motifs in DNA via C4-type zinc fingers. GATA motifs are found within the regulatory regions of many genes, and it has been suggested that GATA-1 is involved in the regulated expression of most, if not all, erythroid-specific genes (reviewed in Ref. 1Orkin S.H. Blood. 1992; 80: 575-581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2Weiss M.J. Orkin S.H. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar). Gene inactivation experiments have shown that GATA-1 is essential for red blood cell formation (3Pevny L. Simon M.C. Robertson E. Klein W.H. Tsai S.F. V. D.A. Orkin S.H. Costantini F.

A. 1996; 93: 12355-12358Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). GATA-1 contains two zinc fingers and an N-terminal transcriptional activation domain (6Martin D.K. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1886-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The C-terminal finger is essential for DNA binding, while the N-terminal finger stabilizes this interaction (7Trainor C. Omichinski J. Vandergon T. Gronenborn A. Clore G. Felsenfeld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2238-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Several findings hinted at the possibility that GATA-1 recruits a co-factor in hematopoietic cells. First, a truncated GATA-1, lacking the trans-activation domain, is still capable of megakaryocytic conversion of the myeloid precursor cell line, 416B (8Visvader J.E. Crossley M. Hill J. Orkin S.H. Adams J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 634-641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and rescue of terminal maturation of GATA-1−/− erythroid precursors (9Weiss M.J. Yu C. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1642-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In addition, although the N-terminal zinc finger is not essential for DNA binding, it is absolutely required for terminal erythroid maturation (9Weiss M.J. Yu C. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1642-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In an effort to identify co-factor proteins that interacted with the N-terminal zinc finger of GATA-1, a yeast two hybrid screen was performed and resulted in the isolation of the transcriptional cofactor Friend-of-GATA (mFOG-1) (10Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A. Fujiwara Y. Yu C. Weiss M.J. Crossley M. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). mFOG-1 is highly expressed in erythroid and megakaryocytic cell lines and in the spleen, liver, and testis (10Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A. Fujiwara Y. Yu C. Weiss M.J. Crossley M. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Recent work has shown that mFOG-1 plays a critical role during hematopoiesis. The targeted disruption of mFOG-1 in mice leads to embryonic lethality, with mice dying of severe anemia between embryonic day 11 and 12 (11Tsang A. Fujiwara Y. Hom D. Orkin S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1176-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Examination of the mFOG-1−/− embryos revealed that overall development was not grossly affected, indicating instead a specific failure of primitive hematopoiesis. mFOG-1−/− embryos were impaired in both primitive and definitive erythropoiesis, and no megakaryocytes or megakaryocytic markers could be detected indicating an extremely early block in megakaryocytic development. Several findings attest to mFOG-1 being a genuine, in vivo co-factor of GATA-1. Apart from showing that these factors specifically interact and are expressed in parallel during embryo development, they were also shown to co-operate in cell lines to promote erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation (10Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A. Fujiwara Y. Yu C. Weiss M.J. Crossley M. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Differences in the defects seen in knockout mice, however, suggest that mFOG1 may also play a role in megakaryocyte lineage commitment that is independent of GATA-1 (11Tsang A. Fujiwara Y. Hom D. Orkin S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1176-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). mFOG-1 has nine zinc fingers with four of the TFIIIA-like CCHH-type and five of the variant CCHC-type. Zinc fingers may be involved in protein:DNA or protein:protein interactions. Although mFOG possesses numerous zinc fingers of a type that has been shown to interact with DNA (12Bellefroid E.J. Bourguignon C. Holleman T. Ma Q. Anderson D.J. Kintner C. Pieler T. Cell. 1996; 87: 1191-1202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), mFOG has not yet been shown to bind DNA directly. In the absence of a specific DNA-binding domain, mFOG might be recruited to a consensus GATA DNA target via its interaction with GATA-1. Indeed, transfection experiments in mammalian cells have demonstrated the synergistic activation of transcription from the hematopoietic-specific p45 NF-E2 regulatory region by mFOG-1 and GATA-1 (10Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A. Fujiwara Y. Yu C. Weiss M.J. Crossley M. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). As well as functioning as a co-activator, there is evidence that mFOG-1 may be involved in negatively regulating gene expression. Recently, mFOG-1 was shown to interact with the transcriptional co-repressor mCtBP2 (13Turner J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5129-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The founding member of the CtBP family of proteins, hCtBP1, was initially identified as a protein which bound to the C-terminal region of the adenovirus E1a protein, modulating its function (14Boyd J. Subramanian T. Schaeper U. LaRegina M. Bayley S. Chinnadurai G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The list of mammalian proteins that specifically associate with mCtBP2 (highly related to hCtBP1) has now been extended to include mFOG-1, BKLF, AREB6, ZEB, and Evi-1 (13Turner J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5129-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). mCtBP2 binds to a region of mFOG-1 containing the CtBP interaction motif Pro-Ile-Asp-Leu-Ser (N-terminal to zinc finger 7), which is distinct from the zinc finger to which GATA-1 binds (zinc finger 6; Ref. 15Fox A. Kowalski K. King G. Mackay J. Crossley M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33595-33603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, the possibility exists that mFOG-1, on binding to mCtBP2, becomes associated with a repressor complex. The Drosophila factor U-shaped (16Cubadda Y. Heitzler P. Ray R.P. Bourouis M. Ramain P. Gelbart W. Simpson P. Haenlin M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 95-3083Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar) has limited homology to mFOG-1 in its zinc finger regions. U-shaped also interacts with a GATA factor, Pannier, and this interaction has been shown to play an important role in Drosophila bristle cell formation and proneural gene expression (16Cubadda Y. Heitzler P. Ray R.P. Bourouis M. Ramain P. Gelbart W. Simpson P. Haenlin M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 95-3083Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 17Haenlin M. Cubadda Y. Blondeau F. Heitzler P. Lutz Y. Simpson P. Ramain P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 108-3096Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that mFOG-1 and U-shaped belong to a class of factors that modulate the transcriptional activity of GATA proteins.

Similarly, the cell lines Mo7e-IL3 and Mo7e-TPO were also cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium except that their medium contained 15% FBS and was supplemented with 20 ng/ml interleukin-3 and 20 ng/ml thrombopoietin, respectively. The majority of the other human cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% FBS, streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml). The cell line TF-1 required RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS and 20 ng/ml granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor. The fibrosarcoma cell line, HT-1080, was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% FBS. Poly(A)+ RNAs (2 μg) isolated from MEL cells and K562 cells were converted to cDNA using an oligo(dT) primer and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). The four degenerate primers (forward: F1 5′-AATATCAACAACTTYTAYGTSCAYAA-3′, F2 5′-CACGAAACCTACACYGTSCAYAA-3′; reverse: R1 5′-ATGCGGTACACTCRTGRTARTC-3′, R2 5′-GTAATACTTCTTRTGNGCRATRAA-3′, where Y is C or T; S is C or G; R is A or G; and N is C, G, A, or T) corresponding to regions within mFOG-1 zinc finger domains 5 (F1), 6 (F2), 7 (R1), and 9 (R2) (GenBank accession number AF006492; nucleotides 2147–2172, 2468–2490, 2846–2867, and 3278–3361) were employed in different combinations for PCR amplification. Me2SO (10%) was included in the PCR mix. The following PCR conditions were used: an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min, 2 units of Taq (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was then added, two PCR rounds of 92 °C 1 min, 37 °C 2 min, 72 °C 1 min, followed by 35 cycles of 92 °C 1 min, 53 °C 1 min, 72 °C 1 min. Amplified products were visualized by ethidium bromide staining after agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR products were cloned into the plasmid pGEM-Teasy (Promega). RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) was performed in order to obtain the full-length hFOG-2 cDNA. Two hFOG-2-specific primers were used in these experiments: hFOG-2 5′-RACE (reverse, 5′-GACGTGGTCGTCCGCTCAGACTG-3′), and hFOG-2 3′-RACE (forward, 5′-ACGACCCTCCACTGAAGAGGTCTG-3′). RACE was performed using K562 poly(A)+ RNA, the two hFOG-2-specific RACE primers, and the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH) as described by the manufacturer, except that five rounds of PCR amplification were performed using only the hFOG-2 RACE primers prior to the addition of the CLONTECH AP1 primer. An additional 35 PCR cycles were then performed (5 cycles of 94 °C 5 s, 72 °C 4 min; 5 cycles of 94 °C 5 s, 70 °C 4 min; 25 cycles of 94 °C 5 s, 68 °C 4 min). Southern analysis was performed to identify the RACE fragments corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-hFOG-2 cDNA ends. Briefly, one tenth of the 5′- and 3′- RACE reactions were separated on an agarose gel and transferred to Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A fragment extending between the two RACE primers was generated by PCR, creating fog2race3–5. This fragment was 32P-labeled and used as a hFOG-2-specific probe. The cDNA fragments corresponding to the largest RACE products that hybridized to the fog2race3–5 probe were excised from the agarose gel and cloned into the plasmid pGEM-Teasy (Promega). Multiple independent copies of the largest RACE products that hybridized to a hFOG-2-specific probe, approximately 2.6- and 2.2-kb products for the 5′- and 3′-RACE, respectively, were cloned and sequenced. The overlapping region between 5′- and 3′-RACE products was found to contain a unique Stu I restriction site. Full-length hFOG-2 cDNA was obtained by subcloning using this site and theNot I sites within the RACE primers (CLONTECH) used to generate the cDNA. Total RNA was isolated from approximately 5 × 107 cells of the various cell lines by guanidinium isothiocyanate lysis (Trizol, Life Technologies, Inc.). Poly(A)+ RNA was then isolated using oligo(dT)-cellulose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 2-μg samples were separated by electrophoresis through formaldehyde-agarose gels. These RNAs were then transferred to Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham). A 32P-labeled hFOG-2-specific PCR fragment, fog2race3–5, was used as a probe and hybridization was performed under high stringency conditions using ExpressHyb (CLONTECH). This fragment was also used to probe two commercial filters, a multiple tissue Northern (CLONTECH) containing poly(A)+ RNA from 12 human tissues and a dot-blot array of 50 RNA samples isolated from human adult and embryonic tissues (CLONTECH). The yeast two-hybrid system was performed as described in the manufacturer's protocol (CLONTECH). Briefly, interaction between proteins was assessed by cloning cDNAs in-frame into either the Gal4activation domain (gal4AD-) plasmid pGAD10, or the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (gal4DBD) plasmid, pGBT9. These plasmids were co-transfected into the yeast strain HF7c and transformants were selected on Trp/Leu-deficient media (SD-L-T). Colonies were patched onto Trp/Leu/His-deficient media (SD-H-L -T), and growth within 30 h was considered indicative of interaction between bait and prey proteins. Full-length hFOG-2 was cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), and 35S-labeled hFOG-2 was generated by in vitro transcription and translation using T7 polymerase and the TNT system (Promega). 35S-Labeled mCtBP2 and GATA-1 were generated as described previously (13Turner J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5129-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 23Mackay J.P. Kowalski K. Fox A.H. Czolij R. King G.F. Crossley M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7-30560Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins and binding assays were carried out as described previously (24Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2437-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine. Transfections were carried out by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (25Chen C. Okyama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar, 26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with the amounts of plasmid DNA indicated. All data shown represents the sum of several sets of experiments with duplicate preparations of plasmid DNA. Transfections were normalized by reference to co-transfected lacZ reporter plasmids. Cells or media were harvested 24 or 48 h after transfection. Growth hormone assays were carried out using Nichols Inst. Allegro GH assay kits according to the manufacturer's instructions. Homology between mFOG-1 and Drosophila U-shaped is essentially restricted to the zinc finger motifs of the CCHC-type. When the zinc fingers of this type are aligned, approximately 50% of the amino acids are identical (up to 68% identity when mFOG-1 zinc finger 6 and the fourth U-shaped zinc finger are compared). In contrast, zinc fingers of the CCHH-type typically show 25% identity. Therefore, we designed degenerate primers corresponding to several zinc fingers of the CCHC-type, mFOG-1 fingers 5, 6, 7, and 9, as we reasoned that these regions might be conserved in other FOG-like genes. Initially, the optimal PCR conditions for each primer combination was determined using cDNA from the murine cell line MEL, which was known to express mFOG-1. We repeated these PCR reactions using K562 cDNA as the starting material. Primers F2 and R1 resulted in the amplification of a product of approximately 0.5 kb, similar to that expected for a human equivalent of mFOG-1. This cDNA fragment, designated F2-R1 (see underlined region in Fig.1 A ), was cloned and sequenced, and data bank searches revealed that it overlapped two other sequences, one in each of the human and murine EST data banks (GenBank accession nos. AA442019 and AA231039, respectively). The putative proteins encoded by these partial cDNAs show greater than 93% identity. They also show significant homology to mFOG-1 zinc fingers 5, 6, and 7. The existence in mice of both mFOG-1 and the cDNA AA231039indicates that the differences between our F2-R1 clone and mFOG-1 were not purely due to sequence divergence between equivalent genes in mice and humans. Instead, we propose that clone F2-R1 is a partial cDNA corresponding to a second mammalian FOG family member. Accordingly, we refer to the original FOG gene as mFOG-1 and our new gene as hFOG-2. 5′- and 3′-RACE strategies extended the putative open reading frame of hFOG-2. Ultimately, this led to the isolation of a 4.5-kb cDNA containing a 3453-base pair open reading frame (potentially encoding 1151 amino acids), and a 1-kb 3′-untranslated region (GenBank accession no. AF119334). The entire coding sequence of hFOG-2 was cloned into pcDNA3, and following in vitro transcription/translation, a protein product with an apparent mass of 166 kDa was detected (data not shown). This differs from the predicted molecular mass of hFOG-2 (128 kDa). The reason for this is unknown, although a similar observation has been made for mFOG-1, which has a predicted mass of 110 kDa, but migrates with an apparent mass of 150 kDa (10Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A. Fujiwara Y. Yu C. Weiss M.J. Crossley M. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A , the protein contains eight putative zinc fingers. Both the types of zinc fingers (CCHC and CCHH) and the spacing between fingers, with four zinc fingers grouped toward the N terminus, is reminiscent of mFOG-1. A notable exception is that a zinc finger corresponding to mFOG-1 zinc finger 8 is absent in hFOG-2. In addition, the distance between hFOG-2 zinc fingers 7 and 8 is 244 amino acids, compared with only 106 amino acids between the corresponding zinc fingers in mFOG-1 (fingers 7 and 9). This additional sequence is largely responsible for the difference in size between mFOG-1 and hFOG-2. An alignment of hFOG-2 and mFOG-1 (Fig.1 B ) shows that the homology between mFOG-1 and hFOG-2, although varying in degree, extends over the entire length of the proteins and there is 40% amino acid identity overall. This is significantly greater than the 22% and 21% amino acid identity seen when U-shaped is aligned with mFOG-1 or hFOG-2, respectively. With regard to the various zinc fingers of mFOG-1 and hFOG-2, the most striking sequence conservation is seen in zinc fingers 1 (91% identity) and 6 (86% identity). The second zinc finger in each protein is of the CCHH-type. When the zinc fingers of this type in mFOG-1, hFOG-2 and U-shaped are compared, generally few amino acids align other than those involved in co-ordinating the zinc atom, resulting on average in 25% amino acid identity between fingers. Thus, the 61% identity between the second zinc fingers of hFOG-2 and mFOG-1 is seen as significant. Finally, hFOG-2 zinc fingers 5 and 8 show 68% identity to mFOG-1 zinc fingers 5 and 9. In addition to the conservation of zinc fingers, mFOG-1 and hFOG-2 are highly homologous at both the N and C termini, and the N termini of zinc fingers 1, 5, and 7. Due to the importance of mFOG-1 in megakaryocyte development and the isolation of hFOG-2 from the erythroid cell line K562 cDNA, we performed Northern blot analysis on 18 human cell lines representing different lineages within the hematopoietic system using a hFOG-2-specific probe extending between, but not including, zinc fingers 6 and 7. A 4.5-kb hFOG-2 transcript was detected in 13 of the cell lines tested, including the fibrosarcoma cell line HT-1080, which was used as a non-hematopoietic cell line control (Fig. 2 A ). We then assessed the level of hFOG-2 expression in 12 human tissues (Fig.2 B ) and a dot-blot array of RNAs isolated from 50 human adult and embryonic tissues (data not shown) and again found that hFOG-2 was expressed at low levels in the majority of tissues. The size of the transcript, approximately 4.5 kb, is similar to that of our cDNA and suggests that we have sequenced the full-length gene product. mFOG-1 has been shown to interact with GATA-1 via zinc finger 6 (10Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A. Fujiwara Y. Yu C. Weiss M.J. Crossley M. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 15Fox A. Kowalski K. King G. Mackay J. Crossley M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33595-33603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Due to the high degree of homology between the sixth zinc fingers of mFOG-1 and hFOG-2, we then sought to determine whether hFOG-2 also interacts with GATA-1. This was assessed both in vitro by GST pull-down experiments, and in vivo in yeast, using a subfragment of hFOG-2 (FOG-2Zf5/6) containing zinc fingers 5 and 6. Fig. 3 A shows the results of the GST pull-down experiments. 35S-labeled GATA-1 does not interact with GST alone (lane 2 ) but is retained by GST-FOG-2Zf5/6 immobilized on agarose beads (lane 3 ). The yeast two-hybrid system was then employed to independently assess the interaction between these two factors. The hFOG-2 subfragment FOG2Zf5/6 was shown to interact with the N-finger of GATA-1, as did the mFOG-1 control, FOG-1Zf5/6/7 (Fig. 3 B ). The FOG-2Zf5/6 subfragment did not interact with either the C-finger of GATA-1 or the gal4DBD alone (Fig. 3 B ). Therefore, a GATA-binding domain of hFOG-2 has been mapped to a region including zinc finger 6, and this subfragment can interact with full-length GATA-1 or specifically with the GATA-1 N-finger. It was previously demonstrated that mFOG-1 functions with GATA-1 to co-activate the p45 NF-E2 promoter (10Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A. Fujiwara Y. Yu C. Weiss M.J. Crossley M. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). A similar activity is also observed with hFOG-2 (Fig. 4). GATA-1 alone has little effect when co-transfected with a reporter harboring 7 kb of the p45 NF-E2 promoter upstream of growth hormone (GH). However, co-expression of both GATA-1 and hFOG-2 (from pcDNA3) activates this promoter approximately 3-fold. Although both mFOG-1 and hFOG-2 have been shown to act as co-activators for mGATA-1 (10Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A. Fujiwara Y. Yu C. Weiss M.J. Crossley M. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar), theDrosophila FOG-like protein, U-shaped, is well characterized as negative regulator of the Drosophila GATA factor Pannier (17Haenlin M. Cubadda Y. Blondeau F. Heitzler P. Lutz Y. Simpson P. Ramain P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 108-3096Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar). It is possible that the mammalian FOG family members may also repress transcription in certain contexts, perhaps through interaction with co-repressors of the CtBP-family. mCtBP2, a co-repressor for various hematopoietic transcription factors (13Turner J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5129-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), has been shown to interact with a region of mFOG-1, N-terminal to zinc finger 7, which contains the CtBP interaction motif Pro-Ile-Asp-Leu-Ser (13Turner J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5129-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this motif is conserved in hFOG-2 in the same position relative to the seventh zinc finger, within a region that otherwise shares little similarity to mFOG-1 (see Fig. 1 B ). This suggests that CtBP proteins may also interact with hFOG-2. Using bothin vitro pull-down assays and the yeast two hybrid system, we have tested the interaction of mCtBP2 and a hFOG-2 subfragment similar to the mFOG-1 fragment shown to interact with mCtBP2. This fragment (FOG-2CBD), spanning amino acids 809–852 of hFOG-2, contains the putative C tBP-b inding d omain. When FOG-2CBD is fused with GST and immobilized on agarose beads, it is able to efficiently retain 35S-labeled mCtBP2, while GST protein alone does not bind mCtBP2 (Fig.5 A , lanes 3 and2 , respectively). It has previously been shown that mutation of the CtBP interaction motif within various transcription factors, from Pro-X -Asp-Leu-Ser to Pro-X -Ala-Ser-Ser, abolishes their interaction with CtBP proteins (13Turner J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5129-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 27Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10467-10471Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The corresponding mutation in FOG-2CBD, creating FOG-2CBD(MUT), completely abolishes interaction with mCtBP2 in this in vitro assay (Fig. 5 A , lane 4 ), demonstrating that the integrity of the Pro-Ile-Asp-Leu-Ser motif is required for the interaction of mCtBP2 with FOG-2CBD. To test whether full-length hFOG-2 could also interact with mCtBP2, we generated a GST fusion protein with mCtBP2 and assessed its ability to retain full-length 35S-labeled hFOG-2 in an in vitro pull-down assay. As shown in Fig. 5 B , GST alone does not retain full-length hFOG-2 (lane 2 ), whereas a strong interaction is observed with a GST-mCtBP2 fusion (lane 3 ). Hence, full-length hFOG-2 is able to interact with mCtBP2. We next determined whether this interaction could also be observed in the yeast two-hybrid assay. Yeast expressing both the gal4AD-FOG-2CBD and gal4DBD-mCtBP2 hybrids grow on media lacking His, Leu, and Trp (SD-H-L-T), indicating interaction between mCtBP2 and this fragment of hFOG-2 (Fig. 5 C ). The requirement of the Pro-Ile-Asp-Leu-Ser motif for hFOG-2 interaction with mCtBP2 is again highlighted by the inability of the yeast transformants harboring gal4DBD-mCtBP2 and gal4-FOG-2CBD(MUT) to grow on the SD-H-L-T media. We also tested the interaction of FOG-2CBD with another member of the CtBP family, hCtBP1. Again, in the yeast system we observed a strong interaction between these two factors, dependent on the integrity of the Pro-Ile-Asp-Leu-Ser motif in FOG-2CBD (data not shown). Hence, FOG2CBD is able to interact with both hCtBP1 and mCtBP2. To test whether the hFOG-2 subfragment harboring the CtBP binding domain can mediate repression, we utilized a gal4DBD-FOG-2CBD fusion protein such that FOG-2CBD is directed to a gal4-dependent promoter driving GH gene expression. We tested the ability of this fusion protein to repress expression in the cell line NIH-3T3, which harbors endogenous CtBP proteins. Fig. 6 A shows the results of these experiments. The fusion protein efficiently represses GH expression in a dose-dependent manner (columns 5–7 ), whereas the gal4DBD has little effect on promoter activity (columns 2–4 ). Repression by gal4DBD-FOG-2CBD(MUT) is significantly impaired (columns 8–10 ), suggesting that interaction with the co-repressor CtBP is necessary for this dose-dependent repression. Therefore, we have mapped a small repression domain in hFOG-2 to a region overlapping the Pro-Ile-Asp-Leu-Ser motif, between amino acids 809 and 852, and have shown that repression is dependent on the integrity of this motif. To verify this repression in the context of full-length hFOG-2, we developed an assay to test hFOG-2's effect on GATA-1-dependent activation of the M1α promoter, containing one GATA-1 site from the murine α-globin promoter, upstream of a minimal TATA box and the GH gene. GATA-1 activates this promoter (Fig. 6 B , column 2 ). However, when GATA-1 is co-expressed with increasing amounts of full-length hFOG-2, GATA-1 activation is dose-dependently repressed to approximately 3-fold (Fig. 6 B , columns 7–10 ). This effect is also seen with mFOG-1 (columns 3–6 ). The residues within the N-finger of GATA-1 responsible for interaction with mFOG-1 are conserved among all GATA factors (15Fox A. Kowalski K. King G. Mackay J. Crossley M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33595-33603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, we reasoned that hFOG-2 may also play a role in repressing the activity of other GATA family members. To test this, we co-expressed GATAs -1, -2, and -4 with hFOG-2 and compared its ability to repress GATA-mediated activation (Fig. 6 C ). hFOG-2 efficiently represses all three GATA factors, and this result suggests hFOG-2 may function to modulate activities of GATA family members in tissues where FOG-1 expression is absent. In this study, we sought to determine whether a family of FOG transcription factors exists in humans. We have identified a novel factor, hFOG-2, and have shown that it is related to mFOG-1, not just at the amino acid level but in its ability to associate with certain protein partners. We have shown that like mFOG-1, hFOG-2 physically interacts with GATA-1 (the N-finger but not the C-finger of mGATA-1) and the co-repressor CtBP (mCtBP2 and hCtBP1). Interestingly, the Drosophila FOG-like protein U-shaped interacts with the GATA factor Pannier, and the presence of a putative CtBP interaction domain within U-shaped suggests that it too may interact with this factor (13Turner J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5129-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). However, unlike U-shaped, which displays little homology to the FOG-like factors outside its zinc finger regions, an alignment of hFOG-2 and mFOG-1 clearly demonstrates the conservation of amino acid sequence (40% identity overall) across their entire lengths and hints at a common ancestry. The structural requirements of certain regions to enable interaction with shared interaction partners will of course put constraints on sequence divergence. Examples of this may be the highly conserved sixth zinc fingers of hFOG-2 and mFOG-1, which interact with GATA-1, and the Pro-Ile-Asp-Leu-Ser motifs responsible for interaction with CtBP. It is interesting that high level homology extends to several of the other CCHC-type fingers, and we are currently testing the hypothesis that they too may be involved in interacting with GATA proteins. Several regions within the FOG proteins are notable for their differences. The double zinc finger, mFOG-1 fingers 2 and 3, which are separated by the evolutionarily conserved H/C-link motif found in many Krüppel-like factors (28Chowdhury K. Deutsch U. Gruss P. Cell. 1987; 48: 771-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), is absent in hFOG-2. In addition, the region between the seventh and last zinc fingers of the two FOG factors differ; hFOG-2 has an additional 138 amino acids separating these fingers, yet a finger corresponding to mFOG-1 zinc finger 8 is absent in hFOG-2. This region shows no significant homology to known proteins. Finally, the proline-rich regions described for mFOG-1 are not generally conserved in hFOG-2. As a consequence, hFOG-2 and mFOG-1 may differ with respect to their interaction with protein partners or possibly, their DNA targets. Neither FOG factor has yet been shown to interact with DNA directly, and it has been proposed that FOG is recruited to the regulatory regions of certain genes primarily through its association with GATA factors (10Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A. Fujiwara Y. Yu C. Weiss M.J. Crossley M. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 11Tsang A. Fujiwara Y. Hom D. Orkin S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1176-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The FOG interaction and DNA interaction faces of GATA-1 are found on opposite sides of the N-terminal zinc finger and it is therefore assumed that FOG will piggy-back onto GATA-1 and not compromise its DNA binding activity (15Fox A. Kowalski K. King G. Mackay J. Crossley M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33595-33603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, FOG may alter GATA binding through a change in protein conformation or through a direct DNA association such that FOG-GATA complexes may bind only a subset of GATA consensus sites. It is also possible that FOG and GATA are involved in long range associations, bringing enhancer and promoter regions together via their interactions. Previously, transfection studies in mammalian cells showed that mFOG-1 and GATA-1 can synergistically transactivate expression from the regulatory region of the hematopoietic-specific gene, p45 NF-E2 (10Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A. Fujiwara Y. Yu C. Weiss M.J. Crossley M. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Likewise, we have shown that hFOG-2 can also act in a similar manner. In contrast, both hFOG-2 and mFOG-1 reduced the ability of GATA-1 to activate transcription of the M1α promoter, a reporter containing the mouse α-globin GATA site. We have mapped a small repression domain in hFOG-2 to a region encompassing the Pro-Ile-Asp-Leu-Ser motif (necessary for interaction with CtBP), and have shown that repression is dependent on the integrity of this motif. This suggests that upon interaction of hFOG-2 with the CtBP co-repressors, hFOG-2 may be involved in down-regulating expression of GATA-target genes. Prior to this, mFOG-1 was believed to function solely as a co-activator. We have now shown that FOG proteins can also act to repress transcription, at least in part through the recruitment of the co-repressor CtBP. It is likely that mFOG-1 and hFOG-2 may act as molecular links to complexes involved in either activation or repression, and thereby modulate GATA activity differently in different promoter contexts. We detected low level expression of hFOG-2 mRNA in 13 hematopoietic cell lines (Fig.2 A ), 7 human tissues (Fig. 2 B ), the murine erythroid cell line MEL (data not shown), and all 50 samples present on a human RNA array (data not shown). hFOG-2 would therefore seem to be broadly expressed. The importance of hFOG-2 in certain tissues and cell types may be governed by the distribution of its associated protein partners. Although expression of mFOG-1 and GATA-1 is largely restricted to hematopoietic tissues, the other GATAs have a broader tissue distribution and may be regulated by hFOG-2. The precise amino acids of the GATA-1 N-finger involved in binding mFOG-1 (15Fox A. Kowalski K. King G. Mackay J. Crossley M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33595-33603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and hFOG-2 (data not shown) have been defined and are conserved in all mammalian GATA factors. Therefore, we predict that FOG-2 will be able to interact with all six mammalian GATA factors. This expectation is supported by the observed repression of GATA-2 and GATA-4 by hFOG-2 shown here (Fig.6 C ). Co-expression of particular FOG and GATA factors may not always reflect their functional interaction. For example, although mFOG-1 is co-expressed with mGATA-2 and mGATA-3 in multipotential progenitor and T-lymphocyte cell lines, respectively, and it has been shown to physically interact with these factors in the yeast two-hybrid system, it is believed that mFOG-1 is not an essential functional co-factor for these GATA factors (10Tsang A.P.

This conclusion follows from the observation that multipotential progenitors, mast cells, and T-lymphocytes that are known to rely on mGATA-2 and mGATA-3 in vivo are not affected in the mFOG-1 knockout (11Tsang A.

It remains possible, therefore, that there is limited redundancy in the few tissues in which the two proteins are co-expressed.

https://openalex.org/W1985043450,"The human tissue kallikrein (KLK ) family of serine proteases, which is important in post-translational processing events, currently consists of just three genes—tissue kallikrein (KLK1) , KLK2 , and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (KLK3 )—clustered at chromosome 19q13.3–13.4. We identified an expressed sequence tag from an endometrial carcinoma cDNA library with 50% identity to the three known KLK genes. Primers designed to putative exon 2 and exon 3 regions from this novel kallikrein-related sequence were used to polymerase chain reaction-screen five cosmids spanning 130 kb around the KLK locus on chromosome 19. This new gene, which we have named KLK4, is 25 kb downstream of theKLK2 gene and follows a region that includes two other putative KLK-like gene fragments. KLK4 spans 5.2 kb, has an identical genomic structure—five exons and four introns—to the otherKLK genes and is transcribed on the reverse strand, in the same direction as KLK1 but opposite to that ofKLK2 and KLK3 . It encodes a 254-amino acid prepro-serine protease that is most similar (78% identical) to pig enamel matrix serine protease but is also 37% identical to PSA. These data suggest that the human kallikrein gene family locus on chromosome 19 is larger than previously thought and also indicate a greater sequence divergence within this family compared with the highly conserved rodent kallikrein genes.

R., and Evans, B. A. (1990) Proceedings of the Genome Conference, Abstract POS-1-27, Lorne, Australia.Google Scholar) suggested that the human KLK gene family may be potentially larger than previously thought. Several early estimations of the size of this family, using Southern analysis, predicted just 3–4 genes (3Baker A.R. Shine J. DNA. 1985; 4: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 5Fukushima D. Kitamura N. Nakanishi S. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 8037-8043Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 6Schedlich L.J.

However, heterologous probing of a human genomic Southern blot with a monkey kallikrein cDNA suggested that it may contain as many as 19 different genes (16Murray S.R. Chao J. Lin F.K. Chao L. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1990; 15: S7-S16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Determination of the true size of the human gene family is important to our understanding of the contribution of the kallikreins to human biology and their roles as peptide processing enzymes. The three best characterized KLK families (human, rat, and mouse) are all localized within gene clusters on single chromosomes. The human family currently spans 60 kb on chromosome 19q13.3–13.4 (17Riegman P.H.J. Vlietstra R.J. Suurmeijer L. Cleutjens C.B.J.M. Trapman J. Genomics. 1992; 14: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The rat family, although in two clusters, is tightly linked at one locus spanning 480 kb on chromosome 1 (11Southard-Smith M. Pierce J.C. MacDonald R.J. Genomics. 1994; 22: 404-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 18Kurtz T.W. St. Lezin E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1992; 3: 28-34PubMed Google Scholar, 19Wines D.R. Brady J.M. Southard E.M. MacDonald R.J. J. Mol. Evol. 1991; 32: 476-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Similarly, the mouse kallikrein family has been localized to a single 310-kb locus on chromosome 7, a position that is analogous to the human KLK locus on chromosome 19 (4Evans B.A. Yun Z.X.

Overall, these findings suggest that if there are more members of the human kallikrein gene family they should be localized within close proximity to the currentKLK locus on chromosome 19q13.3–13.4. All kallikrein genes described to date are 5–7 kb in size and are structurally identical in the genomic arrangement of the five exons and four introns (2Rittenhouse H.G. Finlay J.A. Mikolajczyk S.D.

The considerable homology shared by members of these gene families, both within and between species, suggests that they are derived from gene duplications, exon shuffling, and subsequent divergence from a common ancestor (19Wines D.R.

Whereas the rat and murine family members are highly homologous (74–89% protein similarity), the three fully characterized members of the human family have lower homology (52–78% protein similarity), suggesting that the human KLK gene family has diverged further than in the rodent (1Clements J.A.

However, their precise localization in relationship to the KLK locus is not known. Thus, further characterization of the human KLK locus on chromosome 19 will determine whether these novel kallikrein-related proteases are part of the human KLK family and also may identify other members of this important family of serine proteases. We are currently mapping and sequencing several cosmids and BACs that span over 430 kb surrounding the known KLK locus. A concurrent search of the expressed sequence tag (EST) data base for novel kallikrein-related sequences identified an EST sequence (EST 40886; accession number AA336074) from an endometrial carcinoma cDNA library that was 50% similar at the nucleotide level to the exon2-exon3 regions of the three characterized human KLK genes. We now report the cloning and mapping of the gene encoding this kallikrein-related cDNA to the KLK locus. Although it has also recently been described as a prostate-specific serine protease, prostase (27Nelson P.S. Gan L. Ferguson C. Moss P. Gelinas R. Hood L. Wang K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999; 96: 3114-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), we have called this endometrial- and prostate-expressed gene, KLK4, given its close relationship to the other previously described KLK genes. Five cosmid clones (F24242, R28297, F18306, F22702, R28781) that represent a region previously positive on genomic Southern blots with the pHRK-1 KLK1 probe (4Evans B.A. Yun Z.X. Close J.A. Tregear G.W. Kitamura N. Nakanishi S. Callen D.F. Baker E. Hyland V.J. Sutherland G.R. Richards R.I. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3124-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) were used for the following studies. These cosmids span ∼130 kb near the q13.3–13.4 band junction on the metric physical map of human chromosome 19.3 Using the Qiagen Midiprep kit, DNA was isolated from these cosmids transformed inEscherichia coli DH5a cells and grown in a 500-ml culture of Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 15 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Primers were designed from the putative exon 2 and exon 3 sequences of the endometrial carcinoma EST 40886 to amplify this region, including intron 2, from the five cosmids as potential positive templates. PCR amplification was carried out in an Omnigene thermocycler with the following PCR conditions: 4 mmMgCl2, 200 μm each deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate, 10 ng of each primer, and 1.3 units of Taq polymerase in 1× PCR buffer (Roche Biochemical). Cycling conditions included an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, with a final extension of 7 min at 72 °C. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis through 1% agarose gels and isolated using the Qiagen Gel Extraction kit. Cosmid DNA (10 μg) was digested with the restriction enzyme Eco RI (Roche Biochemical) and Southern blots were prepared using Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) under standard conditions. Hybridizations and washes were carried out at high stringency using the amplified genomic fragment of EST 40886 (KLK4 ) (prepared by PCR as described above) labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Bresatec, Adelaide, SA) using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Megaprime labeling reaction or KLK1, KLK2 , and KLK3 exon 4-specific oligonucleotide probes (KLK1 , codons 142–152;KLK2 and KLK3 , codons 161–167) were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Bresatec). TheKLK4 genomic PCR fragment from cosmid F22702 was subcloned using the Promega pGEM-T Easy TM cloning kit and sequenced fully with the ABI PRISMTM Dye Terminator cycle sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Perkin-Elmer) using 500 ng of plasmid and 3.2 pmol of primer. Extension products were purified by ethanol precipitation and analyzed using an automated Applied Biosystems 373A DNA Sequencer. Further sequence was obtained by primer walking along F22702. Sequence alignments were performed using the Align program at the Genestream network server, IGH, France. PCR analysis of the five cosmids spanning the KLK locus, with EST 40886 specific primers designed to putative exon 2 and 3 regions, identified a band of ∼480 bp from the F22702 and R28781 cosmids (data not shown). Comparison of the intron sizes of other kallikreins predicted that, if this gene was in fact a kallikrein, this fragment could be up to 1.5 kb in size. Although smaller than the predicted fragment, DNA sequencing identified it as the expected product, and analysis of the sequence indicated that the intron was in the correct position. Sequence comparison of this intron with that of the PSA intron 2 suggested that the difference in size was because of the absence of Alu and MER repeat units within the novel genomic sequence (data not shown). The sequence of theKLK4 gene, comprising the coding region and part of the 5′- and 3′-noncoding sequence, was obtained by primer walking along theF22702 cosmid and is shown in Fig. 1. Comparison with the amino acid sequence, deduced from a cDNA isolated in parallel from a prostate cDNA library (data not shown), indicated that the KLK4 gene consists of five exons and four introns, although the presence of a further upstream exon cannot be ruled out. All of the intron/exon junctions conformed to the consensus sequence for eukaryotic splice sites and were in comparable positions to those of the other human KLK gene family members (Figs. 1and 2). In addition, the exonic positions of the serine protease catalytic triad residues (His-71, Asp-116, Ser-207), the signal peptide, and the putative cleavage site of the mature enzyme are common to all four KLK genes, althoughKLK4 is missing a “kallikrein loop” region (Figs. 1 and2). KLK4 encodes a 254-amino acid prepro-serine protease that is 78% identical to pig enamel matrix serine protease and ∼37% identical to PSA, tissue kallikrein, and the K2 enzyme. The amino acid sequence was identical to the serine protease sequence recently reported as prostase (27Nelson P.S. Gan L. Ferguson C. Moss P. Gelinas R. Hood L. Wang K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999; 96: 3114-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) except for a Gln (Q) to His (H) change at residue 197 that results from a single nucleotide change in the codon (CAA to CAC). With the addition of the 3′-untranslated region from the prostase cDNA sequence (27Nelson P.S. Gan L. Ferguson C. Moss P. Gelinas R. Hood L. Wang K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999; 96: 3114-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession numberAF113140), the full size of the gene is estimated at ∼5 kb, again like that reported for the KLK1–3 genes (4Evans B.A. Yun Z.X.

This sequence lacks any obvious TATA box, CAAT box or GC-rich regions, but the sequence at −35 to −21 from the ATG start site (ctaagtctcagtcc) has two overlapping regions with similarity to the initiator sequence (ctcantct) described for a TATA-less promoter, which is often located from −3 to +5 relative to the transcription initiator site (28Adams M.J.

Although promoter elements for PSA are located up to 6 kb from the start of the gene (29Cleutjens K.B.J.M. van der Korput H.A.G.M. Ehren-van Eeklen C.C. Sikes R.A. Fasciana C. Chung L.W. Trapman J.

Characterization of the full promoter sequence of this gene is required to confirm whether these are indeed functional elements. Five cosmids that span the 170 kb of chromosome 19q13.3–13.4 that incorporates the 60-kb kallikrein locus were digested with Eco RI for Southern analysis. Hybridization with the KLK4 cDNA sequence identified two bands in cosmid F22702 of 4.3 and 0.5 kb and two bands of 9.26 and 0.5 kb from the adjacent R28781 cosmid (Fig.3). The fainter hybridizing bands inlanes 1–3 are cross-hybridization of the KLK1 and KLK3 genes located on these cosmids. TheEco RI restriction fragments on each of the five cosmids that were positive with the KLK1, KLK2, and KLK3 probes and two additional but small KLK -like fragments are indicated in Fig. 4. Comparison of the Southern analysis with the Eco RI restriction map of the cosmid clones indicated that the KLK4 gene is located 25 kb downstream of KLK2 (Fig. 4). Restriction enzyme analysis of the KLK4 gene sequence obtained from the F22702 cosmid identified an Eco RI site in the fifth exon. This indicates that the KLK4 gene is transcribed on the reverse strand, in a similar direction to KLK1 but the opposite direction toKLK2 and KLK3. A comparison of these results with the genomic sequence that is now available for other cosmids F25479 and R333593 in this region confirms both the distance between all four KLK genes and the direction of transcription.Figure 4A , Eco RI restriction map (with sizes of Eco RI fragments indicated for each cosmid) of the seven cosmids spanning the KLK locus on chromosome 19q13.3–13.4 used in this study. Five cosmids (F24242, R28297, F18306,F22702, and R28781) were used for restriction mapping the position of all four KLK genes and PCR analysis and sequencing of theKLK4 gene. As further genomic sequencing was completed in this region, two cosmids (indicated by asterisks on the figure) were used to confirm the position, sequence, and orientation of the four KLK genes. Two further small KLK -like gene fragments (Frag #1 , Frag #2 ) were also identified in the region betweenKLK2 and KLK4 .

The exact position of the KLK1 gene relative to the otherKLK genes is still to be confirmed from chromosome 19 sequence data but has been reported to be 31 kb upstream ofKLK3 (17Riegman P.H.J.

In addition we have identified, within the same locus, a fourth member of this family of serine proteases that we have designatedKLK4. Several criteria, which are particularly pertinent to the rodent KLK/Klk families, have been used previously to determine inclusion of a gene in this family. These are a high conservation of sequence with the tissue kallikrein (KLK1 ) gene, a similar genomic organization and size, and localization within a cluster of related genes on the one chromosome in that species. As noted below, the KLK4 gene fits all these criteria, although in terms of sequence it would appear to have diverged further. The KLK4 gene consists of five exons and four introns spanning ∼5.2 kb, a structure and size that is common to all members of the kallikrein gene families (reviewed in Ref. 1Clements J.A. Farmer S.

Nature. 1988; 336: 429-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), with these genes being separated into five different groups based on intron position and position of the amino acid residues (His-71, Asp-116, Ser-207, chymotrypsin numbering) that make up the catalytic triad. Several factors clearly indicate thatKLK4 belongs to the group that includes all the humanKLK family, as well as NES1 and trypsinogen. First, the region encoding the signal peptide is in the first coding exon. Second, the catalytic residues His-71 and Ser-207 are separated in different exons and almost adjacent to the exon boundaries. Third, there is only one intron between exons coding for the His-71 and Asp-116 catalytic residues and, finally, the cleavage site in the zymogen or pro-enzyme, that leads to activation of the mature enzyme, is localized in the same exon as the His-71 residue. Because the gene structure and coding sequence in all serine proteases, including members of the trypsin family and the kallikreins, is very similar, these genes are thought to have derived from a common ancestor (19Wines D.R. Brady J.M. Southard E.M. MacDonald R.J. J. Mol. Evol. 1991; 32: 476-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 21Murray S.R. Chao J. Chao L.

Nature. 1988; 336: 429-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). During evolution, some members of this ancestral gene family have split to different chromosomes, e.g. trypsin to chromosome 7 and tissue plasminogen activator to chromosome 8, butKLK4 and the rest of the KLK gene family remain close to each other on chromosome 19, suggesting that they constitute a sub-family of these related serine proteases. Three Alu repeated sequences are associated with the KLK2 gene: one in the second intron and two approximately 0.4 and 1.2 kb upstream (33Schedlich L.J. Morris B.J. Clin. Exp. Pharm. Phys. 1988; 15: 339-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Alu and Mer repeats are also found in the second intron of PSA andKLK1 in a very similar gene organization (4Evans B.A. Yun Z.X. Close J.A. Tregear G.W. Kitamura N. Nakanishi S. Callen D.F. Baker E. Hyland V.J. Sutherland G.R. Richards R.I.

Commun. 1988; 159: 95-102Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar) but theKLK4 intron 2 lacks these repeat sequences. This suggests that KLK4 may have separated from the ancestral serine protease gene before the formation of the rest of the kallikrein genes, and it could possibly be a precursor to these other genes. Full characterization of all KLK genes and other serine proteases in this locus will further clarify their relationships and the ultimate size of this sub-family of serine proteases. The human KLK gene family is clustered in a 60-kb region on chromosome 19q13.3 -q13.4 in the order of centromere–KLK1 –KLK3 –KLK2 –telomere (17Riegman P.H.J. Vlietstra R.J. Suurmeijer L. Cleutjens C.B.J.M. Trapman J. Genomics. 1992; 14: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). From the chromosomal sequence that is now available for this region, we have confirmed the distance from KLK1 toKLK3 is at least 26 kb and from KLK3 toKLK2 is 12 kb. We have mapped KLK4 25 kb downstream of KLK2 and have determined that it is transcribed in a similar direction to KLK1 , in the opposite direction to PSA and KLK2. Two KLK -like fragments (KLK Frag #1, KLK Frag #2), also identified (14Digby, M. R., and Evans, B. A. (1990) Proceedings of the Genome Conference, Abstract POS-1-27, Lorne, Australia.Google Scholar) 4S. Stephenson, K. Verity, M. Digby, and J. A. Clements, unpublished observation. between KLK2 and KLK4 , do not appear to date to be part of full-length genes and may constitute pseudo-genes. Two other serine protease genes have also been mapped close to the human KLK gene family. Fluorescence in situ hybridization, somatic cell, and radiation hybrid mapping have localized the recently identified NES1 gene to chromosome 19q13.3 (26Luo L. Herbrick J.A. Scherer S.W. Beatty B. Squire J. Diamandis E.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 580-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), although its precise distance from the current KLK genes is not known. A second serine protease gene, Protease M (also known as zyme and neurosin) (23Anisowicz A. Sotiropoulou G. Stenman G. Mok S.C. Sager R. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 624-636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Yamishuiro K. Tsuruoka N. Kodama S. Tsulimoto M. Yamamura Y. Tanaka T. Nakazato H. Yamaguchi N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) was also localized to this same 19q13.3.-13.4 region by fluorescence in situ hybridization. (23Anisowicz A. Sotiropoulou G. Stenman G. Mok S.C. Sager R. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 624-636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These authors suggested that this gene is also close to the KLK locus and proposed that the order of these genes is centromere–ProteaseM–Nes1–KLK1 –PSA–KLK2 –19–telomere. Although the information gained from radiation hybrid and somatic cell mapping and fluorescent in situ hybridization is less precise than the restriction mapping and sequencing approach that we have employed, it is likely that these two genes (NES1 and protease M) are still part of a larger KLK cluster in this locus, akin to that seen in the rodent families (11Southard-Smith M. Pierce J.C. MacDonald R.J. Genomics. 1994; 22: 404-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 12Evans B. Drinkwater C. Richards R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8027-8034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore propose that the order of the expanded kallikrein locus is 19centromere–KLK1 –PSA –KLK2 –KLK frag #1–KLK frag #2–KLK4 –19telomere, with the inclusion of protease M and NES1 although the precise order and distance of protease M and NES1 from the other KLK genes is yet to be defined. The human KLK gene family is clearly less conserved than its rodent counterparts whose enzymes share 75–85% identity (10Wines D.R. Brady J.M. Pritchard D.B. Roberts J.L. MacDonald R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7653-7662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Evans B. Drinkwater C. Richards R. J. Biol.

Evol. 1991; 32: 476-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The encoded proteins of PSA and KLK2 are highly conserved (78% identity), however, they are less similar to KLK1 (52–60% identity) (3Baker A.R. Shine J. DNA. 1985; 4: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 4Evans B.A. Yun Z.X. Close J.A. Tregear G.W. Kitamura N. Nakanishi S. Callen D.F. Baker E. Hyland V.J. Sutherland G.R. Richards R.I.

Commun. 1989; 160: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). KLK4 would appear to have diverged further, being only 37% similar to PSA, KLK2, andKLK1 and no longer containing a “kallikrein loop,” a region of 11 amino acids encoded in exon 3 and thought to be important in the substrate specificity of these enzymes (1Clements J.A. Farmer S. The Kinin System. Academic Press, San Diego1997: 72-97Google Scholar, 2Rittenhouse H.G. Finlay J.A. Mikolajczyk S.D. Partin W. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab.

However, the conservation is greater at the nucleotide level (50%), as noted previously for KLK1–3 (74–85%, Ref. 9Hentuu P Vihko P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 160: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Of note, the encoded protein of KLK4 is most similar to a pig enamel matrix protease (78% identity), indicating that it is probably the human homologue of that enzyme. Moreover, if NES1 and protease M are also part of the human KLK gene family, along withKLK4, they may constitute a sub-group within this family that have diverged further in sequence from their namesake, tissue kallikrein or KLK1. The KLK4 gene was also recently cloned by Nelson et al. , (27Nelson P.S. Gan L. Ferguson C. Moss P. Gelinas R. Hood L. Wang K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999; 96: 3114-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) but given the name prostase because it was suggested to be expressed specifically in the prostate. From our earlier identification of an EST KLK4 sequence that was derived from an endometrial carcinoma cDNA library and evidence thatKLK4 is expressed in other tissues, albeit at lower levels, 5S. Stephenson, S. Myers, F. Rae, A. Kaushal, and J. A. Clements, unpublished observation. we would suggest that the KLK gene family designation (34Berg T. Bradshaw R.A. Carretero O.A. Chao J. Chao L.

Recent Progress on Kinins. I. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel1992: 19-25Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar) is more appropriate than a tissue-specific nomenclature that is difficult to extensively verify. Similarly, the recent designation of prostase as PRSS17, 6Recent designation of the Human Gene Nomenclature Committee. and thus part of a family of serine proteases that are dispersed across several chromosomes, also should be modified given our localization ofKLK4 (alias prostase/PRSS17) to the KLK locus. Although the function of this new gene is unknown, it is likely to be as important in post-translational processing events as tissue kallikrein, PSA and the K2 enzyme have proven to be in a large range of biological events (1Clements J.A. Farmer S. The Kinin System. Academic Press, San Diego1997: 72-97Google Scholar, 2Rittenhouse H.G. Finlay J.A. Mikolajczyk S.D. Partin W. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 580-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and the putative ARE-like sequences noted here in the 5′ flanking region of the KLK4 gene would support this notion. The further characterization of the human KLK locus is likely to provide the location of further KLK -related genes, either known (NES1, protease M) or as yet unknown, that will add to this diverse family of serine proteases.

We examined the energetics of furin specificity using a series of peptidyl methylcoumarinamide substrates. In contrast to previous reports, we found that furin can cleave such substrates with kinetics comparable to those observed with extended peptides and physiological substrates. With the best of these hexapeptidyl methylcoumarinamides, furin displayedk cat /K m values greater than 106m−1 s −1. Furin exhibited striking substrate inhibition with hexapeptide but not tetrapeptide substrates, an observation of significance to the evaluation of peptide-based furin inhibitors. Quantitative comparison of furin and Kex2 recognition at P1, P2, and P4 demonstrates that whereas interactions at P1 make comparable contributions to catalysis by the two enzymes, furin exhibited a ∼10-fold lesser dependence on P2 recognition but a 10–100-fold greater dependence on P4 recognition. Furin has recently been shown to exhibit P6 recognition and we found that this interaction contributes ∼1.4 kcal/mol toward catalysis independent of the nature of the P4 residue. We have also shown that favorable residues at P2 and P6 will compensate for less than optimal residues at either P1 or P4.

In the secretory pathway, the cleavage sites are typically marked by sequences of basic amino acids. Seven distinct proteases that cleave at such sites have been identified in mammals including such neural/neuroendocrine-specific enzymes as PC1 and PC2 and more widely expressed enzymes such as furin, PACE4, and PC7 (1Steiner D.F. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). These enzymes are members of the subtilisin superfamily of serine proteases and are closely related to the yeast proprotein processing protease Kex2 (kexin, EC 3.4.21.61) but more distantly related to degradative subtilisins. Of the mammalian processing proteases, human furin (EC 3.4.21.85) was the first to be identified and has been studied extensively (2Fuller R.S. Brake A.J. Thorner J.

Furin, which is thought to be expressed in essentially all cell types, has been shown to function in the constitutive secretory pathway and to be localized primarily to the trans -Golgi network (3Nakayama K.

Although the list of proteins that contain this general recognition has expanded in recent years, our understanding of the specific enzyme-substrate interactions responsible for furin specificity has lagged. An important reason for this disparity is the relative lack of specificity data derived from systematic, kinetic studies of structurally informative substrates. Indeed, previous studies have suggested that furin cleaves peptidyl methylcoumarinamide substrates much more poorly than substrates having P′ residues (17Angliker H. Neumann U. Molloy S.S. Thomas G.

Such substrates reacted much faster than related peptidyl-MCA2 substrates (MCA, methylcoumarinamide) and, based on these data as well as data for the cleavage of anthrax protective antigen, it has been suggested that furin may require specific residues C-terminal to the cleavage site for efficient catalysis, that simple chain extension N-terminal to the P4 site may enhance reactivity or that the bulky coumarin moiety of the peptidyl-MCA substrates may interfere with binding through interactions with the S1′ position (17Angliker H. Neumann U. Molloy S.S. Thomas G. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To examine these possibilities and develop a more detailed understanding of furin specificity, we synthesized a systematic set of hexapeptidyl-MCA substrates that assess enzyme-substrate interactions at all four subsites (P1, P2, P4, and P6) thought to be involved in furin specificity. Based on a kinetic analysis of the furin-catalyzed cleavage of these substrates, we now report that optimally substituted hexapeptidyl-AMC substrates are hydrolyzed by furin withk cat/K m comparable to those reported for internally quenched peptide substrates and anthrax protective antigen. These improved peptidyl-MCA substrates have allowed the quantitative characterization of subsite binding preferences for furin and, in particular, the additive contribution by P6basic residues to substrate cleavage. We have also found that at high substrate concentrations hexapeptidyl-MCA substrates (but not tetrapeptidyl-MCA substrates) show substrate inhibition with furin. Quantitative analysis of substrate specificity requires determination of k cat/K m values, which can be measured directly under pseudo first-order kinetics (i.e. with [S] ≪ K m). By determiningk cat/K m values for furin in this way, substrate concentrations were kept well below those which inhibit furin and therefore substrate inhibition did not affect our characterization of furin specificity. Furin substrate inhibition does, however, have important implications for the interpretation ofk cat and K m values for model substrates and for the development of substrate-based inhibitors of furin. Standard solvents, reagents, and buffers were obtained from Sigma, Aldrich, or Fisher. AMC (7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin) was obtained from Aldrich and was used as received. Acetylhexapeptides and acetyltetrapeptides were prepared using standard solid phase methods by the University of Michigan Protein and Carbohydrate Synthesis Core Facility. Secreted, soluble furin (hereafter referred to as furin) was purified by a modification of the published method (7Bravo D.A. Gleason J.B. Sanchez R.I. Roth R.A. Fuller R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25830-25837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Active-site titration of furin (7Bravo D.A. Gleason J.B. Sanchez R.I. Roth R.A. Fuller R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25830-25837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was done by measuring an initial burst of product formation with substrate 5 using a Kintek RQF-3 rapid quenched-flow apparatus; the enzyme concentration was found to be 1.9 μm. Peptidyl-MCA substrates were prepared from the trifluoroacetic acid salts of the acetylhexapeptides and acetyltetrapeptides using a previously described modification of Zimmerman's chloroformate-based coupling procedure (22Rockwell N.C. Wang G.T. Krafft G.A. Fuller R.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1912-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 23Zimmerman M. Ashe B. Yurewicz E.C. Patel G. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 78: 47-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Substrates 6, 12, and 13 were solubilized inN -methylpyrrolidinone by addition of LiCl (3 equivalent relative to peptide) prior to activation with isobutylchloroformate. Peptidyl-MCA substrates were purified by reverse-phase HPLC (Rainin Dynamax C18 column, 21.4 × 250 mm) using water/acetonitrile gradients containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. All substrates eluted between 15 and 30%. Substrates 2, 7, and 11 were partially (approximately 15–25%) epimerized at P1during the coupling reaction as determined by HPLC analysis of the crude reaction products. The diastereomers were separated by HPLC and assignment of the stereochemistry was made by differential trypsin digestion. Substrates were also characterized by UV-visual absorption spectroscopy (scans at 200–450 nm) and mass spectroscopy. Synthetic yields varied with the exact sequence of the peptide (10–30%) with lower yields obtained in the examples with multiple basic residues (e.g. substrates 6, 12, and 13). Standard furin assays were performed at 37 °C in 0.2 m MES (pH 7.0 at 37 °C), 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% (v/v) aqueous acetic acid or acetonitrile (depending upon the substrate), and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Reactions (600 μl) were started by addition of enzyme (final concentration > 12 pm). Samples (100 μl) were taken at times between 2 and 40 min and were quenched with 0.5 mZnSO4 (600 μl). Enzyme activity did not decay under assay conditions as shown both by control preincubation experiments and by the linearity of time courses with saturating substrate concentrations (data not shown). Fluorescence was measured using a Perkin-Elmer LS-5B luminescence spectrometer (λex = 385 nm, λem = 465 nm). Raw fluorescence data were fitted to a first-order curve with floating end points (Equation 1) by nonlinear regression using Kaleidagraph v3.0 (Fig. 1 B ),Fluorescence=F0e−kappt+F∞Equation 1 where F 0 is the amplitude of the change in fluorescence, k app is the apparent first-order rate constant, and F ∞ is the end point of the reaction. The resulting first-order rate constants were then divided by enzyme concentration to determinek cat /K m. The values ofk cat /K m were shown to be independent of substrate concentration or of enzyme concentration for each substrate, confirming that the reactions proceeded under pseudo first-order conditions. At least two substrate concentrations differing by 10-fold or two enzyme concentrations differing by 4-fold were tested for each substrate. Substrate concentrations were all below 1 μm. Only progress curves with r > 0.99 (Pearson's r value) were used in the determination ofk cat /K m values. Reported kinetic constants are the mean of at least three trials and errors are reported as standard deviations about the mean. Reactions (100 μl) were started by addition of enzyme and quenched by addition of 0.5 mZnSO4 (600 μl).k cat /K m values were obtained from dividing the slope of the linear portion (low substrate concentrations) of a plot of v i versus [S] by [E 0],vi=(kcat/KM)[E0][S]Equation 2 Hexapeptidyl-MCA substrates did not show simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics under saturation conditions. At high substrate concentrations, the initial velocity decreased as a function of substrate concentration, suggesting some form of substrate inhibition (Fig.1 A ). The initial reaction velocities could be fitted to Equation 3 describing substrate inhibition,vi=kcat[E0][S]KM+S+S2/Ks′Equation 3 where K s values is the binding constant for the second substrate molecule (22Rockwell N.C.

Freeman and Co., New York1985: 80-88Google Scholar). The model did not, however, provide reliable k cat orK m values and, hence, all substrate comparisons are based on relative k cat /K mvalues. Estimates of k cat for substrates 2, 3, and 5 were made based on the maximum observed velocities and represent a lower limit for the actual values. Pseudo first-order and saturation kinetics were carried out as described previously (22Rockwell N.C. Wang G.T. Krafft G.A. Fuller R.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1912-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Fersht A.R. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1985: 80-88Google Scholar). Secreted, soluble Kex2 (hereafter, “Kex2”) was purified and active-site titrated by initial burst as described (20Brenner C. Fuller R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 86: 922-926Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar,22Rockwell N.C. Wang G.T. Krafft G.A. Fuller R.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1912-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25Rockwell N.C. Fuller R.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3386-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In order to study the substrate discrimination properties of the four putative furin subsites (P1, P2, P4, and P6), we prepared a series of hexapeptidyl-AMC substrates based on a core tetrapeptide sequence of Ac-Arg-Tyr-Lys-Arg-MCA. Furin-catalyzed cleavage of the AMC derivative of the core sequence (substrate 1) followed simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics under saturation conditions withk cat = 1.3 s−1 andK m = 2.3 μm(k cat /K m = 5.2 × 105m−1 s−1; TableI). Extension of the core sequence by two alanine residues gave substrate 2, which was cleaved with a similark cat /K m under pseudo first-order conditions (2.3 × 105m−1 s−1) but which did not display simple saturation kinetics. Indeed, in this case as well as with the other two hexapeptidyl-MCA substrates (3 and 5, Fig.1 A ) with which saturation kinetics were attempted, significant substrate inhibition was observed at high substrate concentrations. Attempts to fit these data to a standard kinetic model of substrate inhibition did not provide reliable values for k cat and K m (22Rockwell N.C. Wang G.T. Krafft G.A. Fuller R.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1912-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar,24Fersht A.R. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1985: 80-88Google Scholar). Consequently we were not able to determine independentk cat or K m values for the hexapeptidyl-MCA substrates. Estimates of the lower limit ofk cat based on the maximum observed velocity indicate that 2 is cleaved with a k cat (about 1 s−1) similar to the tetrapeptidyl substrate (k cat estimates for substrates 3 and 5 were also about 1 s−1). Kex2 cleavage of tetrapeptidyl- and hexapeptidyl-MCAs in this series (substrates 1, 3, and 5) was examined as a control. Kex2 exhibited normal saturation kinetics with all of these substrates (Table II), indicating that the substrate inhibition seen with furin is genuine.Table IFurin cleavage of peptidyl-MCA substrate librarySubstrateSequencek cat/K MRelativek cat/K MErrorm−1 s−1%11-aValues measured under pseudo first-order conditions.AcRYKR↓MCA5.2 × 1050.22021-bValues measured from the linear portion ofv i versus [S] plot.AcAARYKR↓MCA2.3 × 1050.12231-bValues measured from the linear portion ofv i versus [S] plot.AcRARYKR↓MCA2.6 × 1061.03841-bValues measured from the linear portion ofv i versus [S] plot.AcKARYKR↓MCA2.2 × 1060.851051-bValues measured from the linear portion ofv i versus [S] plot.AcRYRFKR↓MCA1.3 × 1060.53461-bValues measured from the linear portion ofv i versus [S] plot.AcRAKYKR↓MCA8.3 × 1040.031971-aValues measured under pseudo first-order conditions.AcRAAYKR↓MCA<1000<0.000481-aValues measured under pseudo first-order conditions.AcAAKYKR↓MCA7.9 × 1030.0021091-aValues measured under pseudo first-order conditions.AcAAAYKR↓MCA<100<0.00004101-aValues measured under pseudo first-order conditions.AcRAπYKR↓MCA1-cπ, norvaline.4.4 × 1030.00220111-bValues measured from the linear portion ofv i versus [S] plot.AcRARYAR↓MCA1.7 × 1050.073121-bValues measured from the linear portion ofv i versus [S] plot.AcRARYRR↓MCA1.9 × 1060.737131-aValues measured under pseudo first-order conditions.AcRARYKK↓MCA1.6 × 1040.0065Values are the mean of at least three independent trials for each substrate, and errors are reported as the standard deviation of those trials.

Because the substrate inhibition did not affect data obtained at low substrate concentrations (i.e. concentrations well below K m), we were able to obtain reliable measurements ofk cat /K m for hexapeptidyl-AMC substrates under pseudo first-order conditions (see example in Fig.1 B ) and, thereby, compare the specificity of cleavage within an internally consistent set of substrates (Table I). Based on the core hexapeptide substrate 2, substrates with systematic substitutions at P6, P4, P2, and P1 were prepared, and the k cat /K m for each was determined. The P5 and P3 positions were held constant in the series except in the case of substrate 5, where the P5 Ala was exchanged for a Tyr and the P3 Tyr was converted to a Phe. Although numerous reports in the literature have established that substrates with basic residues at P6 are recognized by furin (3Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar), a systematic assessment of the nature of this interaction has not been reported. Toward this end, a series of substrates with either an aliphatic or a basic residue at P6 was prepared. Substitution of the P6 Ala of substrate 2 with either Arg (substrate 3) or Lys (substrate 4) led to an approximately 10-fold increase in k cat /K m. Thek cat /K m value observed for substrate 3 (2.6 × 106m−1s−1) was within 2–3-fold of those reported for cleavage of internally quenched substrates and an authentic proprotein (13Molloy S.S.

Biochem. 1995; 224: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) indicating that P′ residues do make large contributions to energetics of substrate recognition. In a similar fashion, substitution at P6 of Ala for Arg in substrates 6 and 7 to give substrates 8 and 9 led to 10-fold decreases ink cat /K m, suggesting that the P6 subsite contributes to substrate recognition in an additive manner. Recognition of basic residues at P6 was found to be somewhat sensitive to reaction pH (Table II). Cleavage of P6 Arg substrate 3 at pH 6 was ∼ 5-fold slower than the corresponding reaction at pH 7, whereas cleavage of substrates with Lys (substrate 4) or Ala (substrate 2) at P6 was not appreciably altered by lower pH. Co-expression studies have shown that biologically relevant furin substrates contain either a basic residue (the majority) or an aliphatic residue at P4. Not surprisingly, replacement of the P4 Arg (substrate 2) with Ala (substrate 9) led to an extremely lowk cat /K m (<100m−1 s−1). Likewise, substituting Ala for Arg at P4 within the context of the best substrate (compare substrate 3 and substrate 7) in the series also drastically reduced k cat /K m from 2.6 × 106m−1 s−1to < 1 × 103m−1s−1. Extension of the aliphatic chain of a P4residue from one carbon (Ala, substrate 7) to three carbons (Nvl, substrate 10) improved reactivity slightly (k cat /K m of 4.4 × 103m−1 s−1), suggesting that recognition at P4 is partly due to hydrophobic interactions between the substrate and the S4-binding pocket. In contrast to the behavior observed with P6 variations, the identity of the basic residue at P4 did affect reactivity at pH 7 as shown by the fact that replacement of P4 Arg with Lys led to 30-fold reductions ink cat /K m for substrates 6 and 8. The identity of the basic residue at P2had little effect on k cat /K m(substrate 3 versus 12), whereas replacement of a P2 basic residue with Ala led to a decrease in reactivity of 14-fold (substrate 3 versus 11). The conservative replacement of Arg at P1 with Lys led to a much larger reduction (150-fold) in reactivity (substrate 3 versus 13). Notably, substrate 13 is one of the few examples of reasonably efficient cleavage by furin at a P1 Lys indicating that, as in the case of Kex2, optimal binding at other subsites can partially compensate for a poor at P1 residue (22Rockwell N.C. Wang G.T. Krafft G.A. Fuller R.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1912-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25Rockwell N.C. Fuller R.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3386-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Selected substrates in this series were also cleaved with the yeast processing protease Kex2 for comparison (Table II). Pre-steady state kinetics of Kex2 cleavage of substrate 3 showed a burst, consistent with previous examinations of Kex2 cleavage of model peptide substrates. Additionally, no substrate inhibition was observed with any of the substrates examined (Table II). Extension of the backbone beyond P4 with Ala-Ala (substrate 2) had very little effect, in keeping with previous observations that tetrapeptidyl- and pentapeptidyl-MCAs were cleaved by Kex2 with comparable efficiency (22Rockwell N.C.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3386-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The nature of the P6 side chain had a negligible effect onk cat /K m for Kex2 (Table II). Interestingly, higher k cat values were observed for substrates 1, 3, and 5, h"

In contrast, in human intestines, approximately 80% of the total measurable ACAT activity in vitro is resistant to immunodepletion, suggesting that ACAT activity in this particular tissue may be largely due to the presence of a different ACAT protein (20Lee O.

Orthologs of ACAT-1 in various species have been identified (reviewed in Ref. 5Chang T.Y. Chang C.C.Y. Cheng D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 613-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). In mice, ACAT-1 gene knockout mice have been generated (22Meiner V.L. Cases S. Myers H.M. Sande E.R. Bellosta S. Schambelan M. Pitas R.E. McGuire J. Herz J. Farese R.V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The homozygous knockout mice show markedly reduced ACAT activity and reduced amounts of cholesteryl esters in adrenal glands and in macrophages but not in the liver, suggesting the presence of at least one additional ACAT gene. Two different ACAT genes are present in yeast (23Yang H. Bard M. Bruner D.A. Gleeson A. Deckelbaum R.J. Alijinovic G. Pohl T.M. Rothstein R. Sturley S.L.

The predicted ACAT-2 protein sequence shares significant homology with that of the ACAT-1 protein, particularly near the C-terminal halves of the polypeptides. Whether ACAT-2 protein is responsible for most of the observed ACAT activity in human intestines is not clear at present. Unlike the ACAT-1 mRNAs, the expression levels ofACAT-2 mRNAs in various species examined thus far are tissue-restricted (25Anderson R.A. Joyce C. Davis M. Reagan J.W. Clark M. Shelness G.S.

Previously, immunofluorescence studies showed that the hACAT-1 protein in human melanoma cells or expressed in CHO cells mainly resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (19Chang C.C.Y. Chen J.

The topographical arrangement of ACAT-1 in membranes is unknown. Based on various protein structure prediction programs available, ACAT-1 protein may have up to eight potential transmembrane domains (TMDs). Our current goal is to provide experimental data to define the exact numbers and locations of the TMDs in ACAT-1. In this report, we used a well established procedure for studying membrane protein topography in the ER of intact cells (for two examples, see Refs. 28Roitelman J. Olender E.H. Bar-Nun S. Dunn Jr., W.A. Simoni R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 959-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar and 29Otto J.C. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19868-19875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This procedure consists of fixing cells with formaldehyde, exposing cells with low concentrations of digitonin, which only permeabilizes the plasma membranes, or fixing cells with agents such as Triton X-100 or cold methanol, which permeabilizes both the plasma membranes and internal membranes. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, one then monitors the locations of various specific antigenic sites within the protein. We created various antigenic sites within the ACAT-1 protein by epitope tagging. To express the tagged hACAT-1 proteins, we performed transient transfections in CHO cell mutant AC29 (12Cadigan K.M. Heider J.G. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 274-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AC29 cells lack endogenous ACAT-1 protein (19Chang C.C.Y. Chen J. Thomas M. Cheng D.

Anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (HA11) was from Babco; anti-GRP78 (BIP) IgGs were from Affinity Bioreagents, Inc.; anti-T7 monoclonal antibody was from Novagen; and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Texas Red and goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with FITC were from Vector Laboratories, Inc. Anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody was from Sigma. The impure digitonin (80%) and Triton X-100 were from Sigma; the highly purified digitonin, also called saponin, was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs and from Life Technologies, Inc. The DNA primers were synthesized by the molecular biology core facility at Dartmouth or purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. [9,10-3H]oleic acid was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. This construct (indicated in Fig.1 C ) contains a six-histidine tag immediately followed by the T7 tag, designated as the HisT7 tag, at the C terminus of hACAT-1. It was created by a two-step procedure. First, a DNA fragment containing the sequence encoding the HisT7 tag (34 amino acids, Met-Arg-Gly-Ser-His-His-His-His-His-His-Gly-Met-Ala-Ser-Met-Thr-Gly-Gln-Gln-Met-Gly-Arg-Asp-Leu-Tyr-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys-Asp-Arg-Trp-Gly) flanked with the Eco RI and Xba I sites, was polymerase chain reaction-amplified from the pBlue BacHis A vector sequence (Invitrogen). The polymerase chain reaction product was confirmed by DNA sequencing. This fragment was ligated into thepcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) at the multiple linker region between the Eco RI and the Xba I sites. The new expression vector, designated as pcDNA3HisT7C , provides a HisT7 tag at the C terminus of any protein if the protein coding sequence is inserted in frame with the HisT7 tag at theEco RI site. Next, the stop codon present in thehACAT1 cDNA was deleted by polymerase chain reaction, using hACAT-1 cDNA as the template, the oligonucleotide GGGCTGGATCCGTCGACATGGTGGGTGAAGAGAAGATGTCTC (designated asN-ACAT1 ) as the 5′- primer, and the oligonucleotide CGCTCTAGACCTAGAATTCAAACACGTAACGACAAGTCCAGG (designated asNonstop ACAT1–3′ ) as the 3′-primer; the resultantACAT-1 without the stop codon was ligated into the vectorpcDNA3HisT7C between the Bam HI andEco RI sites. The identity of the HisT7 -taggedACAT1 construct in pcDNA3 was confirmed by DNA sequencing. This new construct, designated aspcDNA3-ACAT1-HisT7 , was used as the template for various site-specific mutagenesis experiments described below. The hemagglutinin epitope tag (HA tag, 9 amino acids: Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Asp-Val-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Ala) (30Wilson I.A. Niman H.L. Houghten R.A. Cherenson A.R. Connolly M.L. Lerner R.A.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 509-519Google Scholar) was inserted into the ACAT-1 protein at each of 12 specific sites as indicated in Fig. 1,A and C ; the specific amino acid after which the HA tag was inserted has been indicated in parentheses in Fig. 1 C . For constructs ACAT1-HA1a , -HA2 , -HA3 , -HA4 , -HA6 , -HA7 , -HA8 , -HA6m , and -HA7m , the tag was inserted by site-specific mutagenesis of the pcDNA3 -hACAT1-HisT7 cDNA described above, using the GeneEditor kit from Promega according to the manufacturer's procedure. Each of the mutagenic primers used was 67 bp in length, containing 27 bp encoding the HA tag (TACCCATATGACGTCCCGGACTACGCC), flanked by two 20-bp ACAT-1 coding sequences, located at each side of a given insertion site. The constructs ACAT1-HA1 and ACAT1-HA5 (Fig. 1) do not contain the HisT7 tag at their 3′-ends of the coding region. These two constructs were produced by the same site-specific mutagenesis procedure described above, using hACAT-1 cDNA inpUC19 as the template; afterward, the resultant mutant cDNA constructs were transferred directly from the pUC 19 vector to pcDNA3 between the uniqueHin dIII and Bam HI sites. The sequences of the mutant cDNAs covering the insertion sites were all confirmed by DNA sequencing. The construct ACAT1-HA2a was generated by polymerase chain reaction by the following method. Using hACAT-1 inpcDNA3 as the template, the N-ACAT1 primer described above and the primer with the sequence CGGAATTCGGCGTAGTCCGGGACGTCATATGGGTATGCTAACACAACATATG (designated as ACAT1-HA2aU ) were employed to produce anACAT-1 N-terminal fragment, containing the first 735 bp of the ACAT-1 coding sequence (11Chang C.C.Y. Huh H.Y. Cadigan K.M. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20747-20755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), flanked withBam HI at the 5′-end and the HA tag sequence and theEco RI sequence at the 3′-end; the other two primers with the sequences ATGAATTCTATACACTGCCACCAGC (designated asACAT1-HA2aD ) and TTCCATGCGGCCGCAAGCTTCTAAAACACGTAACGACAAGTC (designated as C-ACAT1 ) were employed to produce aACAT-1 C-terminal fragment, containing the last 915 bp of the ACAT-1 coding sequence flanked with an Eco RI sequence at the 5′-end and the Not I sequence at the 3′-end. The product containing the N-terminal fragment was cut byBam HI and Eco RI; the product containing the C-terminal fragment was cut by Eco RI and Not I; and the expression vector pcDNA3 (from Invitrogen) was cut by Bam HI and Not I. Afterward, the two fragments and the vector underwent three-piece ligation reaction. The resultant ACAT-HA2a inserted in pcDNA3 was confirmed by DNA sequencing.

Human melanoma 2058 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS in 10% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. The vector pcDNA3 was used for expressing various ACAT-1 constructs in AC29 cells. For Western blotting analysis and ACAT activity in intact cell assay, the cells were grown to around 70% confluency in 25-cm2 flasks and then transfected with 3 μg of the tagged ACAT-1 constructs per flask. For cytoimmunofluorescence assay, the cells were plated on glass coverslips in six-well plates (Corning Glass), grown to 50% of confluency, and then transfected with 2 μg of the tagged ACAT-1 constructs/well. For transfection, Lipofectamine and OPTI-MEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transfection time was 8 h. After transfection, AC 29 cells were grown in F-12 with 10% FBS for 48 h and then lysed with 0.5 ml of 2% SDS per flask. Protein concentration was determined by a method previously described (32Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7065) Google Scholar). One-fifth volume of 5 × loading buffer (5% SDS, 1 m β-mercaptoethanol, 25% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 6.8) was then added to each sample containing 150 μg of protein. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis as described previously (15Cheng D. Chang C.C.Y. Qu X. Chang T.Y. J. Biol.

To briefly describe the procedure, after transfection, AC 29 cells were grown in F-12 with 10% FBS for 24 h at 37 °C in the CO2 incubator. Then 20 μl of 10 mm [3H]oleate (1.34 × 106 cpm/10 μl) in 10% bovine serum albumin was added per flask for 2 h at 37 °C. The lipid analysis was as described previously.

We have also addressed whether Apx is required for the expression of amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents by cloned ENaC. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation of A6 cell detergent extracts showed co-sedimentation of xENaC, α-spectrin, and Apx. Immunoblot analysis of proteins co-immunoprecipitating under high stringency conditions from peak Xenopus ENaC/Apx-containing gradient fractions indicate that ENaC, Apx, and α-spectrin are associated in a macromolecular complex. To examine whether Apx is required for the functional expression of ENaC, αβγ mENaC cRNAs were coinjected into Xenopus oocytes with Apx sense or antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. The two-electrode voltage clamp technique showed there was a marked reduction in amiloride-sensitive current in oocytes coinjected with antisense oligonucleotides when to compared with oocytes coinjected with sense oligonucleotides.

A 160-kDa polypeptide expressed in A6 cells, termed Apx (apical proteinX enopus ) has been cloned by Staub and co-workers (7Staub O. Verrey F. Kleyman T.R. Benos D.J. Rossier B.C. Kraehenbuhl J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1497-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Antibodies directed against Apx cross-react with the biochemically purified Na+ channels, indicating that Apx is associated with this channel. However, it is unclear whether Apx represents an associated regulatory protein or a subunit of the channel. Although Apx did not reconstitute amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents when expressed in Xenopus oocytes, coinjection of either Apx antisense mRNA or antisense oligonucleotides with A6 cell total mRNA inhibited the expression of amiloride-sensitive currents, suggesting that Apx has a regulatory function (7Staub O.

Transfection of Apx into a human melanoma cell line lacking amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels resulted in the expression of a 9 pS,1amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel (8Prat A.G. Holtzman E.J. Brown D.

The molecular cloning of the highly Na+-selective epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) from a variety of epithelial cells, including A6 cells, has revealed that is composed of three homologous subunits, α, β, and γ (2Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar, 9Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C.

This channel has a single channel conductance of 4 pS when expressed in Xenopus oocytes and exhibits ion selectivity, gating kinetics, and an amiloride-pharmacological profile similar to that of the 4 pS, highly Na+-selective channel expressed in native Na+-reabsorbing epithelia (2Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar, 9Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C.

Although the relationship of the cloned ENaC to the biochemically purified Na+ channel has been a point of contention, Rokaw et al. (11Rokaw M.D. Wang J.-M. Edinger R.S. Weisz O.A. Hui D. Middleton P. Shlyonsky V. Berdiev B.K. Ismailov I. Eaton D.C. Benos D.J. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28746-28751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) have recently presented data indicating that α, β, and γ ENaC are components of the epithelial Na+ channel biochemically isolated from A6 cells. In addition, Kleyman and co-workers (12Kieber-Emmons T. Lin C. Foster M.H. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9648-9655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) have revealed that the monoclonal antibody RA 6.3, which was used to biochemically isolate a Na+ channel complex from A6 cells, recognizes the amiloride-binding site on α ENaC. There is evidence indicating that both the biochemically purified epithelial Na+ channel and the α subunit of ENaC are linked to the spectrin-based membrane cytoskeleton. Elements of the spectrin-based membrane cytoskeleton remain associated with the renal epithelial Na+ channel during purification from both bovine papillary collecting ducts and A6 cells (13Smith P.R. Saccomani G. Joe E.-H. Angelides K.J. Benos D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6971-6975Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The SH3 domain of α-spectrin interacts with proline-rich sequences in the C terminus of α ENaC in in vitro assays and endogenous α-spectrin binds to αENaC in transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells overexpressing α ENaC (14Rotin D. Bar-Sagi D. O'Brodovich H. Merlainen J. Lehto P.V. Canessa C.M. Rossier B.C. Downey G.P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4440-4450Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Although association of epithelial Na+ channels with the membrane cytoskeleton has been implicated in maintaining the polarized distribution of the channels to the apical membrane domain in Na+-reabsorbing epithelial cells and in modulating epithelial Na+ channel activity,in vivo evidence for this association is lacking. The molecular cloning of ENaC provides the opportunity to identify proteins associated with the channel that function in regulating its cell surface expression and activity. Here we have examined whether ENaC is associated with Apx and α-spectrin in A6 renal epithelial cells. In addition, we have addressed whether Apx is required for expression of amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents by cloned ENaC in Xenopus oocytes. We reveal that ENaC is associated in a macromolecular complex with Apx and α-spectrin in A6 cells. In agreement with Staub et al. (7Staub O. Verrey F. Kleyman T.R. Benos D.J. Rossier B.C. Kraehenbuhl J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1497-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we demonstrate that Apx is required for the expression of amiloride-sensitive Na+currents by αβγ ENaC in Xenopus oocytes. A6 renal epithelial cells, derived from the distal nephron of Xenopus laevis , were obtained at passage 69 from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and used through passage 84. Cells were cultured as described previously (5Sariban-Sohraby S. Benos D.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4639-4646Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A6 cells were subcultured onto either Millipore (Bedford, MA) HAWP filter rings for membrane preparations (5Sariban-Sohraby S. Benos D.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4639-4646Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) or 24-mm Anocell tissue culture inserts (Nunc, Naperville, IL) for immunofluorescence microscopy. Cultures were exposed to aldosterone (final concentration, 10−7m; Sigma) 3 days prior to use. Monolayers were used 5–7 days and 10–14 days after plating for immunofluorescence microscopy and biochemical experiments, respectively. A6 cell apical membrane preparations were prepared as described previously (5Sariban-Sohraby S. Benos D.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4639-4646Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A microsomal fraction fromXenopus oocytes was prepared as described (15Geering K. Theulaz I. Verrey F. Hauptle M.T. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C851-C858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane preparations were stored at −80 °C, and protein concentrations were determined with a Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay kit using bovine serum albumin as the protein standard. The rabbit anti-Apx antibody generated against a 16-mer synthetic peptide corresponding with the C terminus of Apx (7Staub O. Verrey F. Kleyman T.R. Benos D.J. Rossier B.C. Kraehenbuhl J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1497-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) has been described previously (16Stoner L.C. Engbretson B.G. Viggiano S.C. Benos D.J. Smith P.R. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 144: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The rabbit polyclonal anti-Apx antibody used for immunofluorescence microscopy was raised against amino acids 1194–1395 of the C terminus of Apx expressed as a maltose-binding protein-Apx fusion protein. The antibody was affinity purified on a maltose-binding protein-Apx affinity resin as described previously (8Prat A.G. Holtzman E.J. Brown D. Cunningham C.C. Reisin I.L. Kleyman T.R. McLaughlin M.

The rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against the α subunit of xENaC was generated by Lofstrand Laboratories (Bethesda, MD) using a 20-mer synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 107–125 (CQNDLQELDKETQRTLYEL) in the extracellular loop of α xENaC (17Puoti A. May A. Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.-D. Schild L. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C188-C197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A second rabbit polyclonal anti-αxENaC antibody was generated by Lofstrand Laboratories using a 14-mer synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 618–632 (SNRSYYEENGGRRN) of the C terminus of α xENaC. The immunizing peptides were coupled to Sulfolink agarose (Pierce), and the anti-α xENaC antibodies were affinity purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. A rabbit antibody generated against a 35-mer synthetic peptide corresponding to the C terminus of β xENaC (11Rokaw M.D. Wang J.-M. Edinger R.S. Weisz O.A. Hui D. Middleton P. Shlyonsky V.

P. Johnson (University of Pittsburgh). The mouse monoclonal antibody against nonerythroid α-spectrin was obtained from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Proteins (∼30 μg/lane) were separated by 7.5% SDS/PAGE and transferred to Immobilon PVDF paper (Millipore) as described (16Stoner L.C. Engbretson B.G. Viggiano S.C. Benos D.J. Smith P.R. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 144: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Blots were probed with rabbit anti-Apx (20 μg/ml), rabbit anti-α xENaC (15 μg/ml), or mouse anti-α-spectrin (1:1000 dilution) followed by the appropriate secondary antibody coupled to either alkaline phosphatase or biotin. Bound antibodies were detected using either a Western-Lite (alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies) or a Western-Lite Plus (biotinylated secondary antibodies followed by alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated avidin) chemiluminescent detection system (Tropix, Bedford, MA). Controls consisted of preincubation of anti-peptide antibodies with excess free peptide (40 μg/ml for Apx peptide; 100 μg/ml for α xENaC peptide) or substitution of a comparable concentration of nonimmune serum for the immune serum. Filter grown A6 cell monolayers were extracted in 0.5% Triton X-100 extraction buffer (18Nelson W.J. Hammerton R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 19Nelson W.J. Wilson R. Mays R.W. Stevenson B.R. Gallin W.J. Paul D.L. Cell-Cell Interactions: A Practical Approach.

The 0.5% Triton X-100 soluble fraction was concentrated to a volume of 1 ml using Centricon 10 concentrators (Amicon, Beverly, MA). Linear sucrose gradients (5–20%) were overlain with 200 μl of the concentrated, 0.5% Triton X-100 soluble fraction and centrifuged in a SW 50.1 rotor (Beckman) at 40,000 rpm for 22 h at 4 °C. Protein standards (Sigma) of known S values (apoferritin, 17.2 S; catalase, 11.35 S; aldolase, 7.35 S; bovine serum albumin, 4.6 S; cytochrome C, 1.75 S) were centrifuged on replicate 5–20% gradients. Gradients were fractionated from bottom to top into 20 fractions (250 μl/fraction). Individual fractions from two gradients were pooled (total volume, 0.5 ml/fraction) prior to analysis. The distributions of α xENaC, Apx, and α-spectrin within the 20 fractions were determined by immunoblotting analysis followed by scanning densitometry. The scanned immunoblots were analyzed on a Macintosh IIci computer using the IPLab Gel densitometry program (Scanalytics Corporation, Vienna, VA). Individual sucrose gradient fractions or aliquots of pooled sucrose density gradient fractions 4–8 containing ∼200 μg of protein in a 1-ml volume were precleared for 30 min by inverting on a rotator at 4 °C with 20 μl of a 50% suspension of protein A-agarose beads/tube. Fractions were subsequently centrifuged for 2 min and transferred to new tubes and incubated with 10 μl of nonimmune rabbit IgG for 1 h. 20 μl of protein A-agarose beads were then added for an additional 30 min. Following centrifugation, the supernatants were transferred to new tubes and incubated with primary antibody (5 μl of anti-Apx or anti-α xENaC antibodies) or an equivalent concentration of nonimmune rabbit IgG for 2 h while inverting at 4 °C. Antigen-antibody complexes were recovered by adding protein A-agarose beads (50 μl/tube of a 50% suspension) and inverting for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were alternately pelleted (2 min) in a microfuge and washed three times in high stringency wash buffer, once in high salt high stringency wash buffer, and twice in low salt wash buffer (18Nelson W.J. Hammerton R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Protein A-agarose beads were resuspended in 50 μl of 2× Laemelli sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and centrifuged for 2 min to pellet beads. Supernatants were analyzed by 7.5% SDS/PAGE and immunoblotting as described above. Controls consisted of substituting nonimmune serum for the immune serum or preincubation of anti-peptide antibodies with excess free peptide. α, β, and γ xENaC cDNAs were generously provided by the laboratory of Dr. Douglas Eaton (Emory University). The cDNAs were transcribed and translatedin vitro using the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of [35S]methionine following the manufacturer's instructions. 20 μl of in vitro translated product was diluted to 0.5 ml of a buffer containing 0.4% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 50 mm EGTA. 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing a protease inhibitor mixture (10 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm antipain, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A) and immunoprecipitated using the anti-α xENaC antibody (22 μg/ml) as described above. Immunoprecipitated samples were eluted into SDS/PAGE sample buffer and subjected to 7.5% SDS/PAGE and autoradiography. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed on A6 cell monolayers grown on Anocell filters. Monolayers were washed with PBS twice and then fixed in either 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature (single labeling) or in methanol for 20 min at −20 °C (dual labeling). After further rinsing with PBS, filters were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in PBS supplemented with 10% normal goat serum (PBS-NGS) were then incubated overnight at 4 °C in anti-Apx fusion protein antibody (20 μg/ml) diluted in PBS-NGS containing 0.2% Triton X-100. Following extensive washing in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 1% bovine serum albumin, filters were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) diluted 1:50 in PBS-NGS for 1 h at room temperature. Controls consisted of preincubation of anti-Apx antibody with excess free fusion protein, nonimmune serum, and secondary antibodies alone. Following five or six washes in PBS supplemented with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 1% bovine serum albumin, filters were mounted in mounting medium (glycerol/PBS, 9:1 v/v) containing 0.1% phenylenediamine. For dual label experiments, monolayers were incubated overnight in the anti-α-spectrin antibody (1:100 dilution). Following extensive washing monolayers were incubated for 1 h in the corresponding Texas Red-labeled secondary antibody as described above. Monolayers were subsequently incubated in the anti-Apx antibody for 2 h at room temperature. Following extensive washing, monolayers were incubated in the appropriate fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Monolayers were then washed and mounted as described above. Single and dual scan confocal images were obtained using a Leica laser scanning confocal microscope. For dual scan confocal images, microscope settings controlling laser intensity and detection sensitivity were standardized to ensure an optimal signal to noise ratio prior to simultaneous detection of the fluorescein isothiocyanate and Texas Red fluorochromes. Digital images in a confocal series were processed in Adobe Photoshop under identical settings. α, β, and γ mENaC cDNAs were linearized, treated with proteinase K, phenol-chloroform extracted, and subsequently ethanol precipitated prior to transcription of the capped RNA using the either T7 or T3 RNA polymerase and mMessage mMachinein vitro transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Stage V and VI oocytes for injection with ENaC cRNA and Apx oligonucleotides were isolated from X. laevis females and placed in a solution (CF-SOS) containing 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH. 7.6. Oocytes were defolliculated in CF-SOS with collagenase (mg/ml, type IV, Sigma) at room temperature for 20 min. Oocytes were subsequently washed in CF-SOS supplemented with 1.8 mm CaCl2 (SOS) and stored at 19 °C in SOS supplemented with 2.5 mmsodium pyruvate and 100 μg/ml gentamicin. Two pairs of synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to Apx were synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. The first pair of oligonucleotides was complementary to nucleotides +455 to +479 of Apx (sense, 5′-GCA TTA AGC AGA ATC GCC CTA ACC AC-3′; antisense, 5′-GTG GTT AGG GCG ATT CTG CTT ATG C-3′). The second pair of oligonucleotides was complementary to nucleotides −30 to −13 of Apx (sense, 5′-CAA TTC AGT TTC AAA GGG-3′; antisense, 5′-GCA TTA AGC AGA ATC GCC CTA ACC AC-3′). Paired oocytes were injected with a 50 nl volume containing: (i) 2 or 10 ng of α, β, and γ mENaC cRNA and 25 ng of Apx antisense oligonucleotide or (ii) 2 or 10 ng of α, β, and γ mENaC cRNA and 25 or 50 ng of Apx sense oligonucleotide. A further control was performed by injecting oocytes with 2–10 ng ofα, β and γ mENaC cRNA and 25 nl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated H2O. Injected oocytes were than incubated at 19 °C in modified Barth's solution for 24–48 h prior to electrophysiological measurements. Oocytes were perfused with a solution containing 100 mm sodium gluconate, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, and 5 mm BaCl2, pH 7.2. Whole cell current was measured at a holding potential of −100 mV in the presence or absence of amiloride (10 μm). Amiloride-sensitive current was determined for each oocyte at −100 mV by subtracting the residual current in the presence of amiloride from the base line as described previously (21Kosari F. Sheng S.

Specificity of the antibody directed against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 107–125 of α xENaC was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of in vitro translated α xENaC. An ∼70-kDa polypeptide, corresponding to the predicted molecular mass of α xENaC, was observed (Fig.1 A ). This polypeptide was not immunoprecipitated when the anti-α xENaC antibody was preincubated with excess free immunogenic peptide, nor did this antibody show cross-reactivity with in vitro translated β and γ xENaC (Fig. 1 A ). The anti-α xENaC antibody specifically recognized ∼ 70-, ∼150-, and ∼180-kDa polypeptides on immunoblots of A6 cell Triton X-100 extracts (Fig. 1 B ). Cell surface biotinylation has revealed that the ∼180-kDa polypeptide is expressed at the apical cell surface in A6 cell monolayers. 2J. B. Zuckerman, X. Chen, B. Hu, P. R. Smith, and T. R. Kleyman, manuscript in preparation. To corroborate that the 180-kDa polypeptide recognized by the anti-α xENaC antibody represents α xENaC rather than an unrelated peptide sharing a common epitope with α xENaC, we generated a second anti-α xENaC antibody against the C terminus of α xENaC. An A6 cell apical membrane fraction was immunoprecipitated using the anti-α xENaC antibody (amino acids 107–125). Immunoprecipitates were subsequently immunoblotted with the anti-C-terminal α xENaC antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 C , an ∼180-kDa polypeptide was specifically recognized within the immunoprecipitate by the anti-C-terminal antibody. To further corroborate that the anti-α xENaC antibody specifically recognizes α xENaC, we examined whether β xENaC coimmunoprecipitates with the 180-kDa α xENaC polypeptide from an A6 cell apical membrane fraction. As shown in Fig. 1 D , a ∼97-kDa polypeptide (11Rokaw M.D. Wang J.-M. Edinger R.S. Weisz O.A. Hui D. Middleton P. Shlyonsky V. Berdiev B.K. Ismailov I. Eaton D.C. Benos D.J. Johnson J.P. J. Biol.

The rabbit anti-Apx C-terminal peptide antibody specifically recognized a ∼165–175-kDa polypeptide, corresponding to Apx on immunoblots of A6 cell apical membrane proteins (Fig. 2,lane 1 ). The mouse monoclonal anti-nonerythroid α-spectrin antibody recognized α-spectrin (∼240 kDa) as well prominent ∼150- and ∼120-kDa proteolytic fragments of α-spectrin (Fig. 2,lane 4 ). Specificity of antibody binding was determined by preincubation of the anti-peptide antibodies with an excess of free immunogenic peptide (Fig. 2, lane 2 ) or by substituting nonimmune serum or IgG for the primary antibodies (Fig. 2, lane 4 ). Laser scanning confocal microscopy was used to examine the distribution of Apx in A6 cell monolayers. As shown in Figs. 3 and4, there is heterogeneity in the apical expression of Apx. Optical sectioning of A6 cells revealed that Apx exhibits a punctate staining pattern that is localized to the apical and apico-lateral membrane domains as well as in the apical cytoplasm (Figs. 3 and 4). No specific labeling was observed when the anti-Apx antibody was preincubated with excess free fusion protein (data not shown).Figure 4Laser scanning confocal imaging series of apical expression of Apx in A6 cell monolayer. The paraformaldehyde fixed monolayer was permeabilized and incubated with anti-Apx antibodies followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody.

Because of the difficulty in dissociating protein complexes from the detergent insoluble membrane cytoskeleton, we looked for Triton X-100-soluble complexes containing α xENaC, Apx, and α-spectrin. Nelson and co-workers have previously used this approach to demonstrate an association of Na+/K+ATPase with the spectrin-based membrane cytoskeleton in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (18Nelson W.J. Hammerton R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and retinal pigment epithelial cells (20Marrs J.A. Napolitano E.U. Murphy-Erdosh C. Mays R.W. Reichardt L.F. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To determine whether solubilized α xENaC is in a complex with Apx and α-spectrin, 0.5% Triton X-100 extracts of A6 cell monolayers were separated on 5–20% linear sucrose density gradients. The distributions of α xENaC, Apx, and α-spectrin within the sucrose density gradient fractions were determined by immunoblotting followed by densitometry. Fig. 5 illustrates the results from a representative gradient. Analysis of the sedimentation profile revealed a peak of Apx in fraction 6 that overlapped with the peak of α-spectrin (fractions 4–6) and the 180-kDa polypeptide specifically recognized by the anti-α xENaC antibody (∼10.5 S). The ∼70-kDa α xENaC polypeptide sedimented in fractions 6–13, peaking in fraction 8. In contrast, the ∼150-kDa polypeptide recognized by the anti-α xENaC antibody peaked in fractions 11–13, which was well separated from the peak distributions of Apx, and α-spectrin.

CD14 is a monocyte/macrophage differentiation marker and is strongly up-regulated during monocytic cell differentiation. Here, we report the direct binding of C/EBP to the monocyte-specific promoter of CD14. Transactivation analyses demonstrate that C/EBP family members significantly activate the CD14 promoter. These data indicate that C/EBP is directly involved in the regulation of CD14 gene expression. When myelomonoblastic U937 cells are treated with vitamin D3 and TGF-β, they differentiate toward monocytic cells. Using specific antibodies against different C/EBP family members in electrophoretic mobility shift assays and Western blot assays, we have identified a specific increase in the DNA binding and the expression of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ during U937 monocytic cell differentiation, and we found C/EBPα and C/EBPβ bind to the promoter in heterodimer. Furthermore, with stably transfected cell lines, we demonstrate that the C/EBP binding site in the CD14 promoter plays a critical role for mediating TGF-β signaling in the synergistic activation of CD14 expression by vitamin D3 and TGF-β during U937 differentiation. This may indicate that C/EBPs have important functions in the process of TGF-β signal transduction during monocyte differentiation.

Using specific antibodies against different C/EBP family members in electrophoretic mobility shift assays and Western blot assays, we have identified a specific increase in the DNA binding and the expression of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ during U937 monocytic cell differentiation, and we found C/EBPα and C/EBPβ bind to the promoter in heterodimer. Furthermore, with stably transfected cell lines, we demonstrate that the C/EBP binding site in the CD14 promoter plays a critical role for mediating TGF-β signaling in the synergistic activation of CD14 expression by vitamin D3 and TGF-β during U937 differentiation. This may indicate that C/EBPs have important functions in the process of TGF-β signal transduction during monocyte differentiation.

However, the mechanism associated with the differentiation of monocytes from hematopoietic progenitor cells has not yet been fully elucidated. CD14 is highly expressed on the surface of monocytes/macrophages and is strongly up-regulated during the differentiation of monocytic precursors into monocytes (14Griffin J.D. Ritz J. Nadler L.M.

Therefore, the regulation of CD14 expression has been investigated as a model to provide critical insight into the mechanisms of monocyte differentiation. During monocyte differentiation, the expression of CD14 is specifically and strongly up-regulated at the transcription level (17Zhang D.E. Hetherington C.J. Gonzalez D.A. Chen H.M. Tenen D.G. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3276-3284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The upstream sequence of the CD14 gene shows a strong tissue-specific promoter activity (10Zhang D.E. Hetherington C.J. Tan S.

Functionally, CD14 is a receptor for the complex of lipopolysaccharide and its binding protein (18Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C.

In the present study, we have identified a C/EBP site in the critical region of the CD14 promoter and investigated the expression of the CD14 gene under the regulation of C/EBP. Furthermore, we have analyzed the regulation of CD14 expression during vitamin D3- and TGF-β-induced monocyte differentiation with U937 cells. Our results demonstrate that C/EBP is an important transcription factor for CD14 promoter activity and that the C/EBP binding site is crucial for the synergistic signaling from vitamin D3 and TGF-β to induce monocyte differentiation, and we are the first to demonstrate that C/EBPs mediate TGF-β signaling in a model of monocyte development. Human promonocytic THP-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) TIP202, Manassas, VA) were grown in RPMI 1640 (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 2 mm l-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 2 × 10−5m2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). Human myelomonoblastic U937 cells (ATCC, CRL 1593) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. Human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells (ATCC, CCL2) and African green monkey kidney fibroblast-like CV-1 cells (ATCC, CCL70) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker) with 10% calf serum (Sigma) and 2 mm l-glutamine. Human Mono Mac 6 cells were propagated as described (34Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Thiel E. Futterer A. Herzog V. Wirtz A. Riethmuller G. Int. J. Cancer. 1988; 41: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Vitamin D3 (kindly provided by Dr. Milan R. Uskokovic of Hoffman-La Roche, Nutley, NJ) was dissolved in 100% ethanol at 10−3m and diluted in cell culture medium to 1 × 10−7m or the concentrations described in the figure legends. TGF-β was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and used according to the manufacturer's protocol at 1 ng/ml. The characterization of monocyte differentiation of U937 cells induced by vitamin D3 and/or TGF-β was based on a previous report (35Testa U. Masciulli R. Tritarelli E. Pustorino R. Mariani G. Martucci R. Barberi T. Camagna A. Valtieri M. Peschle C. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2418-2430PubMed Google Scholar). According to the analysis with fluorescent-activated cell sorter, 99% of U937 cells were positive for CD14 expression after 48 h induction by vitamin D3 and TGF-β. pXP2 is a promoterless luciferase construct (36Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-458PubMed Google Scholar). The construction of p-227CD14-luc was described previously (10Zhang D.E. Hetherington C.J. Tan S. Dziennis S.E. Gonzalez D.A. Chen H.M. Tenen D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11425-11434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). p-227CD14(m135)-luc, which contains a mutation in the C/EBP binding site (bp −129 to −135) of p-227CD14-luc, was generated by polymerase chain reaction. Plasmid p-227CD14-luc was used as template with a pair of primers, 5′-GGGGTACCCCGATAAGTCTTCCGAACCTC-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCCTGAGTCATCAGGACAC-3′, to generate PCR fragment A, or with another pair of primers, 5′-GGGGTACCCCGATAAGTCTTCCGAACCTC-3′ and 5′-GGGGTACCATTTCCAGGAAAGG-3′, to generate PCR fragment B. PCR fragment A was digested with Kpn I and Bam HI, and PCR fragment B was digested with Kpn I and Sac I. The digested fragments were then ligated into the Bam HI andSac I sites of pXP2 to create p-227CD14(m135)-luc. pCMV-hC/EBPα was kindly provided by G. Darlington (37Timchenko N. Wilson D.R.

Auron) into the Eco RI/Xho I sites of pcDNA1. pCMV-hC/EBPδ was generated by inserting a 2.6-kilobase Pst I fragment of human C/EBPδ (kindly provided by Dr. K. G. Xanthopoulos) (38Cleutjens C.B. van E.C. van D.H. Smit E.M. Hagemeijer A. Wagner M.J. Wells D.E. Trapman J. Genomics. 1993; 16: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) into the Pst I site of pCMV5. THP-1 and U937 cells were cultured to a concentration of 4 × 105 cells/ml, and HeLa cells were cultured to 50–70% confluence. The cells were subsequently harvested for nuclear protein preparation. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (39Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 176419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides (oligo A: 5′-ACATCCTTCATTGCAATATTTCCATTAAAGG-3′ containing bp −144 to −115 of the CD14 promoter; the underlined sequence is a putative C/EBP binding site) for EMSA were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 kinase and purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. EMSAs were performed by incubating 5 μg of nuclear protein extracts with labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 10 mm HEPES-KOH buffer (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) at room temperature for 20 min. For competition analysis, a 50-fold molar excess (except as otherwise noted in the figure legends) of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was added to the nuclear extracts prior to the addition of the labeled probe. For the supershift assays, polyclonal antibodies against C/EBPα, -β, -δ, Sp1, normal rabbit serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or C/EBPε (kindly provided by Dr. K. G. Xanthopoulos), were incubated with the nuclear extracts for 15 min followed by the addition of radiolabeled probe. The binding reactions were resolved on 6% polyacrylamide gels in 1× TBE. The transfection procedure is described elsewhere (40Pahl H.L. Burn T.C. Tenen D.G. Exp. Hematol. 1991; 19: 1038-1041PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were harvested 5 h after transfection in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer, and luciferase assays were performed as described previously (40Pahl H.L. Burn T.C. Tenen D.G. Exp. Hematol. 1991; 19: 1038-1041PubMed Google Scholar). The transfection efficiency was normalized by the levels of growth hormone expressed from 2 μg of co-transfected plasmid containing the Rous sarcoma virus promoter directing human growth hormone gene expression (RSV-hGH). Growth hormone concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay (Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA). 2 × 105 CV-1 cells were plated in 4 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum in 60 mm plates 1 day prior to the transfection. Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method as described elsewhere (41Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with 10 μg of reporter plasmid (p-227CD14-luc or p-227CD14(m135)-luc), 1 μg of expression plasmid (pCMV-hC/EBPα, pCMV-hC/EBPβ or pCMV-hC/EBPδ), 0.5 μg of RSV-hGH (as an internal transfection efficiency control), and sheared salmon sperm DNA (Sigma) to a total of 20 μg of DNA per transfection. Control plates received 1 μg of empty expression vector to allow a precise comparison. The medium was changed 12–16 h after transfection. The luciferase activities were measured 48 h after transfection. The transfection efficiency was normalized as described above by human growth hormone expression. Total RNA was isolated using the Tri-Reagent method according to the manufacturer's protocol (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (17Zhang D.E. Hetherington C.J. Gonzalez D.A. Chen H.M. Tenen D.G. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3276-3284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Radomska H.S. Huettner C.S. Zhang P. Cheng T. Scadden D.T. Tenen D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4301-4314Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). CD14 cDNA was labeled by the random priming method. The blot was washed twice with 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 65 °C. Autoradiography was performed using Kodak BioMax MR film at −80 °C with Kodak BioMax MS intensifying screens. Quantitation of related mRNA levels was performed with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described above. Proteins (80 μg) were diluted 1:1 with Laemmli 2× sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred by electroblotting (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) to nitrocellulose membranes. Human C/EBPα and C/EBPβ were detected after 1 h of incubation with a 1:500 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-rat C/EBPα and C/EBPβ antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. They were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (diluted 1:1000). Quantitation of relative protein levels was performed with ImageQuant software from Molecular Dynamics. U937 cells were transfected by electroporation in RPMI 1640 medium at 960 μF and 250 V. Linearized pXP2, p-227CD14-luc or p-227CD14(m135)-luc (10 μg) were co-transfected with PGK-neo (1 μg) into 1 × 107cells. Geneticin (G418) (1 mg/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to the cell medium 48 h after transfection. Positive clones were assayed for luciferase activity using a luciferase assay kit from Promega (Madison, WI). Four individual transfected stable lines for each luciferase construct were assayed after induction with 1 × 10−7m vitamin D3 and/or 1 ng/ml TGF-β for 24 h in three independent experiments. In a previous study (10Zhang D.E. Hetherington C.J. Tan S. Dziennis S.E. Gonzalez D.A. Chen H.M. Tenen D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11425-11434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we defined the proximal promoter of the CD14 gene, in which four regions of the CD14 proximal promoter were protected by nuclear proteins from monocytic cells in DNase I footprinting analysis. Three Sp1 sites were located in this region. The Sp1 binding site at bp −110 is critical for the tissue-specific activity of the CD14 promoter. However, the function of a protected site further upstream (bp −121 to −154) and the identity of the protein interacting with this site remained unknown. In order to elucidate this protein/DNA interaction, the sequence of this region was analyzed. We found that the sequence between bp −128 and −136 (TATTGCAAT) of the noncoding strand was almost identical to the C/EBP consensus sequence TTNNGNAAT (43Natsuka S. Akira S. Nishio Y. Hashimoto S. Sugita T. Isshiki H. Kishimoto T. Blood. 1992; 79: 460-466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To verify the functional importance of the putative C/EBP site for CD14 promoter activity, six base pairs (bp −129 to −135) in the core C/EBP binding site were mutated by PCR-mediated site-specific mutagenesis from TGCAAT in the CD14 promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct, p-227CD14-luc, to GGTACC in p-227CD14(m135)-luc. This mutation destroyed the ability of the region from bp −115 to −144 to interact with nuclear protein(s) in EMSA (data not shown). Luciferase constructs with and without this mutation in the CD14 promoter were used in transient transfection assays in the myelomonoblast cell line U937 and the monocytic cell line Mono Mac 6 (Fig. 1). The mutation reduced CD14 promoter activity to 40% of the wild type promoter in U937 cells and to 30% of the wild type in Mono Mac 6 cells. These results demonstrate that the putative C/EBP site is important for CD14 promoter activity. To demonstrate that the nuclear protein(s) interacting with the putative C/EBP site of the CD14 promoter are C/EBP family members, EMSAs were performed. Oligo A was radiolabeled and incubated with nuclear extracts from THP-1 cells. The nuclear protein(s) showed a strong interaction with oligo A (Fig.2 A, lane 2 ). The major shifted complex (labeled with C/EBP) can be efficiently competed with unlabeled self oligonucleotide and a C/EBP binding oligonucleotide from the M-CSF receptor promoter (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and 4 ) (8Zhang D.E. Hetherington C.J. Meyers S. Rhoades K.L. Larson C.J. Chen H.M. Hiebert S.W. Tenen D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1231-1240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, non-C/EBP binding oligonucleotides with the consensus sequences of Sp1 or PU.1 failed to compete with labeled oligo A (Fig.2 A, lanes 5 and 6 ). In addition, nuclear extracts from nonmonocytic HeLa cells do not form the same complex with oligo A (Fig. 2 A, lane 7 ). C/EBPs are not normally expressed in HeLa cells (7Zhang D.E. Fujioka K. Hetherington C.J. Shapiro L.H. Chen H.M. Look A.T. Tenen D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8085-8095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Zhang D.E. Hetherington C.J. Meyers S. Rhoades K.L. Larson C.J. Chen H.M. Hiebert S.W. Tenen D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1231-1240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that the protein(s) binding to bp −115 to −144 of the CD14 promoter belongs to the C/EBP family. C/EBPs are a family of transcription factors that have high homologies at their C-terminal dimerization domains and DNA binding domains. In order to verify which C/EBP member interacts with the CD14 promoter, specific antibodies against different members of the C/EBP family were used in an EMSA. As shown in Fig. 2 B, a strong supershifted band was observed with the C/EBPα antibody, and the original shifted band was significantly reduced in the presence of the C/EBPα antibody (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2 and 3 ). The antibodies against C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ also reacted with the DNA-C/EBP complex (Fig. 2 B, lanes 4 and5 ). However, in comparison to the C/EBPα antibody, the reduction of the complex by C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ antibodies was less significant. As negative controls, the antiserum against Sp1 and normal rabbit serum were used and do not have any effect on the DNA-C/EBP complex (Fig. 2 B, lanes 6 and 7 ). The results indicate that C/EBPα, -β, and -δ are able to bind to the CD14 promoter. Furthermore, C/EBPα is the major C/EBP family member interacting with the CD14 promoter in promonocytic THP-1 cells. To further demonstrate the importance of C/EBPs for CD14 promoter activity, C/EBP transactivation experiments were conducted in the C/EBP negative cell line CV-1 (Fig.3). Compared with CD14 promoter activity in the absence of any C/EBP expression, C/EBPα activated the CD14 promoter 11-fold, whereas C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ activated the promoter 4.8- and 8.5-fold, respectively. When the construct with the mutated C/EBP site was used in parallel experiments, C/EBPα, -β, and -δ significantly lost their ability to transactivate the CD14 promoter. These data indicate that C/EBPα, -β, and -δ can activate the CD14 promoter and that this transactivation by C/EBPs is through the identified C/EBP site at bp −129 to −136 of the CD14 promoter. The above results demonstrate that C/EBPs are important transcription factors for CD14 expression. To further study the role of C/EBP in CD14 expression during monocyte differentiation, U937 cells were treated with vitamin D3; these myelomonoblastic cells undergo differentiation toward monocytes (44Olsson I. Gullberg U. Ivhed I. Nilsson K. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 5862-5867PubMed Google Scholar, 45Munker R. Norman A. Koeffler H.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 46Liu M. Lee M.H. Cohen M. Bommakanti M. Freedman L.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 142-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). TGF-β can synergize with vitamin D3 to strongly induce monocyte differentiation (35Testa U. Masciulli R. Tritarelli E. Pustorino R. Mariani G. Martucci R. Barberi T. Camagna A. Valtieri M. Peschle C. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2418-2430PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, CD14 expression was elevated upon such induction. CD14 mRNA was detectable by Northern blot analysis when cells were treated with vitamin D3 (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 3 ). CD14 expression was highly up-regulated when cells were treated with both vitamin D3 and TGF-β (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and6 ) but not by TGF-β (lane 4 ). Densitometry analysis revealed a 30-fold increase relative to treatment by vitamin D3 alone. To investigate whether C/EBP is involved in the induction of CD14 expression, an EMSA was performed with nuclear extracts from untreated and variously treated U937 cells, as shown in Fig. 5. Under both treatments, an increase of C/EBP binding to the CD14 promoter was detected. Treatment with a combination of vitamin D3 and TGF-β showed a much higher level of the increase than is seen in treatment with vitamin D3 alone (Fig. 5, lanes 2, 7, and12 ). To identify which C/EBP family members were responsible for the increase of C/EBP binding during monocyte differentiation, antibodies against C/EBPα, -β, -δ, and -ε were independently added to the reaction mixtures. The results showed that the majority of the binding before the inductions was C/EBPα (Fig. 5, lanes 2–6 ). C/EBPα and C/EBPβ were the major contributors in the increase of the DNA-C/EBP complex after the cells were treated with vitamin D3 or vitamin D3 plus TGF-β (Fig. 5,lanes 7–16 ). Because the addition of either C/EBPα or C/EBPβ antibody removed almost the entire complex (Fig. 5,lanes 8, 9, 13, and 14 ), it indicates not only that C/EBPα and C/EBPβ are the major binding factors but also that they form heterodimers.Figure 5The increase of C/EBP binding during monocyte differentiation. Promonocytic U937 cells were treated with 1 × 10−7m vitamin D3 or with 1 × 10−7m vitamin D3 and 1 ng/ml TGF-β to induce differentiation. A double-stranded oligonucleotide containing bp −144 to −115 of the CD14 promoter was radiolabeled with 32P and incubated in the absence (lane 1 ) or the presence of 5 μg of nuclear extracts from wild type U937 cells (lanes 2–6 ), U937 cells treated with vitamin D3 (lanes 7–11 ), or U937 cells treated with vitamin D3 and TGF-β (lanes 12–16 ). Various C/EBP antisera were added to the binding reaction mixtures. Theasterisk marks a relatively nonspecific complex. Thedots mark the complexes possibly formed between DNA and the short forms of C/EBPβ.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the reason for the elevation of C/EBP binding during monocyte differentiation, Western blot analyses were performed with nuclear proteins from U937 cells after various inductions. The expression of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ was increased when U937 cells were treated with either vitamin D3 or TGF-β (Fig. 6). However, the strongest increases of both C/EBP factors were seen upon treatment with both vitamin D3 and TGF-β. Densitometry analysis revealed a 13-fold increase for both C/EBPα and C/EBPβ. It has been reported that phosphorylation regulates the ability of C/EBPs to interact with DNA (47Mahoney C.W. Shuman J. McKnight S.L. Chen H.C. Huang K.P. J. Biol.

Amino acid sequence and structural homology of hGUSB and Escherichia coli β-galactosidase active sites led us to propose that residues Glu451, Glu540, and Tyr504 in hGUSB are involved in catalysis, Glu451 being the acid-base residue and Glu540 the nucleophile. To test this hypothesis, we introduced mutations in these residues and determined their effects on enzymes expressed in COS cells and GUSB-deficient fibroblasts. The extremely low activity in cells expressing Glu451, Glu540, and Tyr504 hGUSBs supported their roles in catalysis. For kinetic analysis, wild type and mutant enzymes were produced in baculovirus and purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography. Thek cat/K m values (mm−1·s−1) of the E540A, E451A, and Y504A enzymes were 34,000-, 9100-, and 830-fold lower than that of wild type hGUSB, respectively. High concentrations of azide stimulated the activity of the E451A mutant enzyme, supporting the role of Glu451 as the acid-base catalyst. We conclude that, like their homologues in E. coli β-galactosidase, Glu540 is the nucleophilic residue, Glu451 the acid-base catalyst, and Tyr504 is also important for catalysis, although its role is unclear.

Deficiency of β-glucuronidase (GUSB)1 in humans produces a mucopolysaccharide storage disease referred to as mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (Sly syndrome) (1Sly W.S. Quinton B.A. McAlister W.H. Rimoin D.L. J. Pediatr. 1973; 82: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 2Hall C.W. Cantz M. Neufeld E.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1973; 155: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the absence of GUSB, chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and heparan sulfate are only partially degraded and accumulate in the lysosomes of many tissues. The GUSB enzyme, synthesized as an 80-kDa glycoprotein monomer precursor (653 amino acids), is processed to a 78-kDa monomer by proteolytic cleavage, removing 18 amino acids from the C terminus (3Islam M.R. Grubb J.H. Sly W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22627-22633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Shipley J.M. Grubb J.H. Sly W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12193-12198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mature GUSB is normally a homotetramer, but there is evidence that the homodimer can also be enzymatically active (5Gehrmann M.C. Opper M. Sedlacek H.H. Bosslet K. Czech J. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Glycosidases function by using one of two general mechanisms leading either to retention or inversion of the anomeric configuration at the hydrolysis site (6McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 7Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1489) Google Scholar). In either case, two acidic residues, usually two glutamic acids, participate directly in catalysis. One amino acid acts as a catalytic nucleophile and the other as an acid-base catalyst or the proton donor. A number of mutations in hGUSB result in complete to partial loss of in vitro activity and have been associated with different disease phenotypes (8Tomatsu S. Fukuda S. Sukegawa K. Ikedo Y. Yamada S.

However, none of these amino acids have been established as essential to the catalytic mechanism. Based on the effects of salt, pH, and group-specific chemical reagents on the activity, Wang and Touster (19Wang C.-C. Touster O. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2644-2649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that a carboxylic acid and a carboxylate anion are the catalytic functional groups. Another approach to predict candidate catalytic residues is by sequence comparison with homologous enzymes whose active site residues have been identified. According to a recent classification based on amino acid sequence similarity, hGUSB was placed into family 2 together withEscherichia coli β-galactosidase (EGAL) (13Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar, 14Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2600) Google Scholar). X-ray crystal structure (15Jacobson R.H. Zhang X.-J. DuBose R.F. Matthews B.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar), inhibitor studies (16Gebler J.C. Aebersold R. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11126-11130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and site-directed mutagenesis (17Cupples C.G. Miller J.H. Huber R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5512-5518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) studies of EGAL unequivocally established that the important catalytic residues include Glu537 as the nucleophile and Glu461 as the acid-base catalyst. Tyr503 was also found to be important for catalysis, but its role is not yet clear (18Ring M. Huber R.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 283: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). From a sequence comparison of hGUSB with EGAL and a number of additional bacterial β-galactosidases, the candidate residues which correspond to the Glu537, Glu461, and Tyr503 in EGAL were identified as Glu540, Glu451, and Tyr504, respectively, in hGUSB (Fig. 1). Hydrophobic cluster assay, where homologous folds in glycosidases within the same family were compared, also predicted that Glu540 might be the nucleophile, whereas Glu451might be the acid catalyst in hGUSB (20Henrissat B. Callebaut I. Fabrega S. Lehn P. Mornon J.-P. Davies G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7090-7094Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). On the other hand, by comparing the x-ray crystal structure of hGUSB with those of lysozyme and EGAL, Jain et al. (21Jain S. Drendel W.B. Chen Z.-W. Mathews F.S. Sly W.S. Grubb J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) proposed that the Asp207-Glu451 pair might form the nucleophile-acid-base catalyst pair in hGUSB, analogous to the Glu35-Asp52 pair in lysozyme. In this report, we modified all the candidate residues proposed to be important for catalysis in hGUSB using site-directed mutagenesis. From the enzymatic activity and kinetic analyses, we concluded that Glu540-Glu451, not Asp207-Glu451, forms the nucleophile-acid catalyst pair in hGUSB. Furthermore, Tyr504, the residue analogous to Tyr503 in EGAL and also located in the active site cavity of hGUSB (20Henrissat B. Callebaut I. Fabrega S. Lehn P. Mornon J.-P. Davies G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7090-7094Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), is also important for catalysis. M13mp18, DEAE dextran, and nucleotides for DNA sequencing were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Enzymes for molecular biology were from Omega and Promega, except for Sequenase®, which was from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Chloroquine and 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-glucuronide were from Sigma. LipofectAMINE was from Life Technologies, Inc. Tissue culture medium was from Life Technologies, Inc. Tran35S-label was from ICN, IgGsorb was from the Enzyme Center (Malden, MA), and EN3HANCE was from NEN Life Science Products. The bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit was from Pierce. The mutations were generated with a single-strand mutagenesis system from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech in M13 vector and with a double-strand system usingCLONTECH Corp. in pBluescript (pBS KS) vector. In both vectors, a full-length hGUSB cDNA had been cloned into theEco RI site. The mutant oligonucleotides (antisense) were as follows: E451A, GTG GCC AAC GCG CCT GCG TCC; E415Q, GTG GCC AAC CAG CCT GCG TCC; E540A, CAG AGC GCG TAT GGA GCA G; E540D, CAG AGC GAC TAT GGA GCA; E540Q, CAG AGCCAG TAT GGA GCA G; E515A, GGG CAC CTG GCG TTG ATT CAG CTG C; Y508A, CTC TTG GGC TCA CGA CTA CGG; Y504A, GAA CAG CGC CTA CTC TTG G; Y504H, GAA CAG CCA CTA CTC TTG G; Y504F, GAA CAG CTT CTA CTC TTG G; D207A, CAT ATT TCG CCT TCT TCA ACT ACG. For all mutants except D207A, a 428-base pair fragment betweenSac II (1322) and Sac I (1750) was excised from the respective mutant clone and swapped with the wild type fragment in human cDNA that had been previously cloned into theEco RI site of expression vector pJC119RI (22Sprague J. Condra J.H. Arnheiter H. Lazzarini R.A. J. Virol. 1983; 45: 773-781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the D207A mutant, a 262-base pair fragment generated by digestion withApa I (478) and Bgl II (740) was exchanged with the normal fragment between Apa I-Bgl II in pJC119RI vector. All mutant fragments transferred into the wild type were verified to exclude undesired mutations by DNA sequencing using the dideoxy chain termination method (23Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52465) Google Scholar). The full-length mutant cDNAs constructed in this way were subcloned into the Eco RI site of expression vector pCAGGS (24Miyazaki J. Takaki S. Araki K. Tashiro F. Tominaga A. Takatsu K. Yamamura K. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 79: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) or Backpack-8, a baculovirus transfer vector (25Luckow V.A. Prokop A. Bajpai R.K. Ho C.S. Recombinant DNA Technology & Applications. McGraw-Hill, New York1991: 97-152Google Scholar). COS-7 cells (26Gluzman Y. Cell. 1981; 23: 175-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar) were transfected with cDNAs in pJC119RI using the DEAE-dextran method. Mouse GUSB-deficient 3521 cells were transfected with the cDNAs in pCAGGS using 6 μl of LipofectAMINE and 3 μg of plasmid DNA in a total volume of 200 μl in 35-mm Petri dishes. Media were collected, and cells were solubilized in 0.6 ml of 0.25% sodium deoxycholate 76–78 h after the start of transfection. Metabolic labeling with Tran35S-label, chase with unlabeled media, and harvest of cells and media followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-hGUSB antibody were done as described previously (3Islam M.R. Grubb J.H. Sly W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22627-22633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Clonal recombinant baculoviruses containing wild type and E540A, E451A, and Y504A mutant cDNAs were produced according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH) by transfecting SF21 cells in p35 Petri dishes withSau I-digested viral genome and transfer vector, Backpack-8 containing the wild type, or mutant cDNA. The plaques obtained with the wild type hGUSB were screened by GUSB activity, whereas the plaques obtained for mutants were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a polyclonal anti-hGUSB antibody. The recombinant baculoviruses containing the wild type or the mutant cDNAs were amplified in SF21 cells. A 500-ml SF21 culture was then infected with medium containing the amplified virus to produce the wild type or mutant GUSB enzymes, which were secreted into medium. The wild type and the mutant enzymes produced in the infected SF21 culture medium were purified by affinity chromatography on monoclonal antibody columns of 1-ml bed volume as described (3Islam M.R. Grubb J.H. Sly W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22627-22633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ho K.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1991; 2: 63-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). After elution, the enzymes were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl containing 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. Purity of the enzyme preparations was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206514) Google Scholar), followed by staining with Coomassie Blue R-250. The purified enzymes were passed over a TSK G3000 SW column connected to an isocratic high pressure liquid chromatography system. Column equilibration and sample elution were carried out with 0.1 m phosphate buffer containing 0.1m Na2SO4, pH 6.7. β-Glucuronidase activity was determined using 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-glucuronide. One unit is the amount of activity that releases 1 nmol of 4-methylumbelliferone/h (29Brot F.E. Bell C.E. Sly W.S. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured by bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions using bovine serum albumin as standard. Wild type and mutant enzymes in 0.5× heat inactivation buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) were incubated at 68 °C for 0–2 h and assayed for β-glucuronidase activity (30Brot F.E. Glaser J.H. Roozen K.J. Sly W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 57: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The pH profiles for wild type and mutant enzymes were determined by adding 10 μl of the enzymes to 100 μl of 12.5 mm 4-methylumbelliferyl β-d-glucuronide in the buffers of the respective pH levels (0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 3–5.5, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.0–8.0) followed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. The kinetic parameters were determined by assaying β-glucuronidase activity at 37 °C in 0.2m acetate buffer at the respective pH optima with 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mm 4-methylumbelliferyl β-d-glucuronide. The K m andV max were obtained from a double-reciprocal plot of initial substrate concentration versus rate of product formed. The mutants constructed by changing the wild type residues Glu451, Tyr504, and Glu540 were E451A, E451Q, Y504A, Y504H, Y504F, E540A, E540Q, and E540D. For comparison, we also made changes in Tyr508, Glu515, and Asp207, which were alternate candidates for the nucleophile and acid-base catalyst, producing E515A, Y508A, and D207A. All of these mutants were transiently expressed in COS cells from the SV40 late promoter in vector pJC119. β-Glucuronidase activity was measured in cells and medium, and the sum of activity in cells and medium produced by each mutant during the 76 h following transfection was determined (Table I). The mutants thought to be candidates for involvement in catalysis were also expressed in 3521 cells, a mouse cell line with no endogenous β-glucuronidase activity (3Islam M.R. Grubb J.H. Sly W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22627-22633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wu B.M. Tomatsu S. Fukuda S. Sukegawa K. Orii T. Sly W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23681-23688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike with COS cells, where endogenous GUSB activity makes it difficult to demonstrate the low activity of mutant enzymes, the 3521 cell transfections with wild type and mutant cDNAs expressed in pCAGGS vector allow characterization of low activity mutant enzymes (24Miyazaki J.

Table I shows that different mutants of Glu540, the residue homologous to nucleophilic residue Glu537 in EGAL, all had greatly reduced residual activity when expressed in COS cells and 3521 cells. The D207A mutant, which Jain et al. (21Jain S. Drendel W.B. Chen Z.-W. Mathews F.S. Sly W.S. Grubb J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) had suggested might be the nucleophile, had 1.5% (COS cells) and 4.9% (3521 cells) of wild type activity, more than would be expected if it were the nucleophilic residue. The E451A mutant transfections produced only 0.6% of wild type activity in both cell types, whereas the E451Q mutant produced 1.5% (COS cells) and 5.9% (3521 cells) of wild type activity. These low activities are consistent with Glu451 being the acid-base catalyst. The higher activity of E451Q could be explained by a low level of lysosomal deaminase activity converting the Q to E. These results contrast with the relatively high activity of the E515A mutant, which excludes it as an important residue in catalysis. The three different mutants of Tyr504, which is homologous to the required 503 in EGAL, had activities ranging from 0.1–0.5% in COS cells and 0.6–2.4% in 3521 cells. By contrast, Y508A had 14.7% of the wild type activity in COS cells. Taken together, these data suggest that Glu540, Glu451, and Tyr504 in hGUSB have comparable roles in catalysis as their homologues in EGAL, i.e. that Glu540 is the nucleophilic residue, Glu451 is the acid-base catalyst, and Tyr504 is also important for catalysis like Tyr503 in EGAL, whose role in catalysis is not yet defined, although it clearly is located in or near the active site in EGAL (15Jacobson R.H. Zhang X.-J. DuBose R.F. Matthews B.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) as is Tyr504 in the active site of GUSB (21Jain S. Drendel W.B. Chen Z.-W. Mathews F.S. Sly W.S. Grubb J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). To compare synthesis, processing, and secretion of wild type and mutant enzymes, we carried out metabolic labeling of transfected COS cells. As shown in Fig. 2, when labeled for 1 h, the biosynthesis of all the mutant enzymes tested appeared comparable with that of the wild type. After a 24-h chase, all but one mutant (E540D) showed processing to the mature form (which is known to involve removal of the C-terminal 18 amino acid residues) and were secreted in amounts comparable to that of the wild type enzyme. E540D was exceptional. Even though some of the E540D enzyme was secreted, no processed enzyme was evident, and the intracellular enzyme appeared to be more rapidly degraded (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 6 ). These observations could mean that some of the E540D mutant enzyme was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and underwent endoplasmic reticulum-mediated degradation (31Knittler M.R. Dirks S.

The fact that the other mutants were processed normally to the mature form and secreted into the medium indicated that they were properly folded and were recognized by receptors in the secretory and lysosomal targeting pathways and by the processing enzyme(s) in endosomes and/or lysosomes. To purify and characterize the mutant enzymes without contaminating wild type endogenous enzyme, the E540A, E451A, and Y504A mutants were transferred to the baculovirus genome by homologous recombination and produced in SF21 insect cells. The enzymes secreted into the growth medium were purified by affinity chromatography. As shown in Fig.3, the purified mutant enzymes had the same migration patterns on SDS-PAGE as the wild type, except for Y504A, which had slightly faster migration. This faster mobility of Y504A could be due to a different level of glycosylation in SF21 cells. In fact, when the mutant enzyme was expressed in COS cells (Fig. 2,lanes 19–21 ), it showed the same mobility as the wild type enzyme. Size exclusion chromatography on TSK gel revealed that all three mutant enzymes were tetrameric (not shown). The kinetic parameters obtained from the assays of the purified wild type and mutant enzymes are presented in TableII. Thek cat/K m values were decreased 33,000-fold in E540A, 9,100-fold in E451, and 830-fold in Y504A mutant enzymes. However, the K m values were similar to the wild type hGUSB. These kinetic studies are consistent with our assignments of Glu540 as the nucleophile, Glu451 as the acid-base catalyst, and Tyr504 as an important active site residue whose role is still not established.Table IIKinetic values of E540A, E451A, and Y504A mutant enzymesConstantWild typeE540AE451AY540AK m(mm)2.761.201.331.67k cat(s−1)2760.0040.0150.20k cat/K m(mm−1 · s−1)1000.0030.0110.12Fold decrease33,0009,100830Measurements were made with 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-glucuronide at 37 °C.K m values were calculated from double-reciprocal plots of reaction velocity versus substrate concentration.

All the proteins including the wild type were produced in baculovirus and purified by affinity chromatography using an monoclonal antibody tresyl column. The enzyme activities of the wild type and mutant enzymes at different pH levels are shown in Fig.4. Y504A had a broad pH activity profile between pH 3.0 and 8.0, similar to that of the wild type enzyme. The E540A mutant enzyme had an optimum at pH 5.0 instead of 4.5. The E451A enzyme showed a broader pH optimum (pH 4.0–5.0), and its activity drop with increasing pH was more gradual than that of wild type GUSB. It retained 35% of its activity at pH 8. Fig. 5 compares the heat stability of wild type and mutant enzymes. Human GUSB is relatively stable to heat inactivation. Less than 40% of the activity was inactivated by heating to 68 °C for 2 h at pH 7.5 in 75 mm NaCl and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Y504A activity was as stable as the wild type up to 2 h. E540A activity was inactivated at a faster rate than the wild type. The E451A enzyme was completely inactivated within 30 min at 68 °C. The greater heat lability of the E540A and the E451A enzymes suggests that the carboxyl groups of Glu540and Glu451 contribute to stability of the enzyme. Jainet al. (21Jain S. Drendel W.B. Chen Z.-W. Mathews F.S. Sly W.S. Grubb J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) suggested from structural analysis that Glu540 forms salt bridges to His385 and Arg382, which probably contribute to stability of the wild type enzyme, and Glu451 is surrounded by three Asn residues. MacLeod et al. (32MacLeod A.M. Lindhorst T. Withers S.G. Warren R.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6371-6376Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 33Yuan J. Martinez-Bilbao M. Huber R.E. Biochem.

Biol. 1988; 204: 607-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) proposed that stimulation of activity of mutant enzymes by azide can be used to identify the acid-base catalyst in retaining type hydrolases for substrates that do not require protonic assistance for initial bond cleavage. They inferred from stimulation of E127A in exoglucanase/xylanase that this residue was the acid-base catalyst. When we studied the effects of azide on wild type and mutant GUSB activities, wild type hGUSB was found to be inactivated with increasing sodium azide concentrations (Fig. 6). Such inhibition was not noted by MacLeod et al. (32MacLeod A.M. Lindhorst T. Withers S.G. Warren R.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6371-6376Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and its basis is unclear. Like the wild type enzyme, the E451A mutant enzyme also showed inhibition by azide and lost 70% of its original activity in 50 mm azide. However, concentrations of azide between 50 mm and 0.5 m stimulated activity of the E451A enzyme. Activity was 4-fold greater at 500 mmazide than that seen at 50 mm azide. Further increase in azide concentration to 1 m inhibited the E451A enzyme like the wild type enzyme. Azide had no effect on the extremely low activity of the E540A mutant enzyme. Recent classification of glycosyl hydrolases based on comparison of amino acid sequences in the active sites placed hGUSB into family 2 together with EGAL (6McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 7Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1489) Google Scholar). The active site of the latter has been studied in great detail, and two glutamate/glutamic acid residues (Glu537 and Glu461) were identified to be involved in catalysis (15Jacobson R.H. Zhang X.-J. DuBose R.F. Matthews B.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 16Gebler J.C. Aebersold R. Withers S.G. J. Biol.

Recently, the three-dimensional structure of EGAL confirmed that Glu537 and Glu461 are in the active site cleft and positioned at a distance that would be consistent with them forming the nucleophile and acid-base catalyst pair and their participating in the retaining type catalysis. In addition, early mutational studies had identified Tyr503 in EGAL as an important catalytic residue. Although structural studies show that Tyr503 forms part of the active site cavity, its role in catalysis is still unknown (16Gebler J.C. Aebersold R. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11126-11130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence comparison of hGUSB with mouse, rat, or E. coli GUSB and EGAL revealed the three residues in hGUSB that correspond to Glu537, Glu461, and Tyr503 in EGAL to be Glu540, Glu451, and Tyr504, respectively (Fig. 1). The data presented here support the predictions based on homology to active site residues in EGAL and those based on hydrophobic cluster analysis (20Henrissat B. Callebaut I. Fabrega S. Lehn P. Mornon J.-P. Davies G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7090-7094Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) implicating Glu540 and Glu451 as the nucleophile/acid-base pair involved in catalysis of hGUSB. Furthermore, based on alignment of a variety of retaining-type glycosyl hydrolases (32MacLeod A.M. Lindhorst T. Withers S.G. Warren R.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6371-6376Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and on hydrophobic cluster assay of regions surrounding the catalytic amino acids identified for a few retainingO -glycosyl hydrolases, similar motifs were present in over 150 glycosyl hydrolases. In all for which the nucleophilic residue has been identified, the putative proton donor (acid-base catalyst) is located upstream of the nucleophile and is preceded immediately by an invariant Asn residue and also preceded by a conserved Trp residue five residues upstream. In GUSB, Glu451 is upstream of Glu540 and is located in the sequenceWSVANEP. Another piece of evidence consistent with Glu451 being the acid-base residue is the increase in activity of the E451A mutant enzyme in the presence of azide. MacLeod et al. (32MacLeod A.M. Lindhorst T. Withers S.G. Warren R.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6371-6376Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) suggested from the increase in k cat with some substrates seen with E127A mutant exoglucanase/xylanase in the presence of 60 mm to 2 m azide that azide can occupy a vacant anionic site created by removal of the acid-base catalyst (E127A in their case and E451A in GUSB) and react rapidly with the glucosyl-enzyme intermediate, increasing the steady state rate and forming the glycosyl azide product. We interpret the stimulation of E451A hGUSB by 50–500 mm azide to support its role as the acid-base catalyst, although inhibition of the wild type enzyme by azide, the mechanism of which is not yet clear, complicates the interpretation of this experiment. Furthermore, it has been noted in the retaining type glycosyl hydrolases for which crystal structures are available (20Henrissat B. Callebaut I. Fabrega S. Lehn P. Mornon J.-P. Davies G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7090-7094Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) that both active site residues are located in the C-terminal TIM barrel. The x-ray crystal structure of hGUSB placed residues Glu451 and Glu540 in the C-terminal TIM barrel formed by residues 343–642 and located both residues in the active site cleft (21Jain S. Drendel W.B. Chen Z.-W. Mathews F.S. Sly W.S. Grubb J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Using another approach to characterize the mechanism of hydrolysis of GUSB and to identify its active site residues, Wong et al. (35Wong A.W. He S. Grubb J.H. Sly W.S. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34057-34062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) recently determined that hGUSB is a retaining acid hydrolase using NMR analysis of the product of hydrolysis. In addition, by analysis of the labeled peptides after hydrolysis of hGUSB-substrate analogue complex, they concluded that the nucleophile in hGUSB is Glu540, as suggested by the studies reported here. Despite remarkable conservation of the catalytic residues identified in the active site of hGUSB and in most of the other O -glycosyl hydrolases, there is evidence of extensive evolutionary diversification in the residues that confer substrate specificity (20Henrissat B. Callebaut I. Fabrega S. Lehn P. Mornon J.-P. Davies G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7090-7094Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). It is interesting that no patient so far reported to have the Sly syndrome has been found to have a mutation involving Glu540, Glu451, or Tyr504. Possibly such active site mutations would produce severe enough clinical consequences to be incompatible with survival. However, three mutations have been reported in patients that affect two residues close to the active site cleft in which these three residues reside (11Vervoort R. Islam M.R. Sly W.S. Zabot M.T. Kleijer W.J. Chabas A. Fensom A. Young E.P. Liebaers I. Lissens W. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 58: 457-471PubMed Google Scholar). These are R382H, R382C, and Y508C. Although none of the MPS VII mutations reported affect the three active site residues described here, most of the MPS VII mutations that have been characterized affect residues that are conserved in both mammalian and E. coli GUSBs. Presumably these mutations affect folding and/or stability of the mutant enzyme rather than catalysis. We thank Dr. A. Waheed and Dr. Thomas Davis for critical discussion during the study and during preparation of the manuscript and Elizabeth Torno for editorial assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2020197688,"Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) is a potent growth inhibitor and inducer of cell death in B-lymphocytes and is essential for immune regulation and maintenance of self-tolerance. In this report the mouse immature B cell line, WEHI 231, was used to examine the mechanisms involved in TGF-β-mediated apoptosis. Induction of apoptosis is detected as early as 8 h after TGF-β administration. Coincident with the onset of apoptosis, the cytoskeletal actin-binding protein, αII-spectrin (α-fodrin) is cleaved into 150-, 115-, and 110-kDa fragments. The broad spectrum caspase inhibitor (Boc-D-fmk (BD-fmk)) completely abolished TGF-β-induced apoptosis and αII-spectrin cleavage. Caspase 3, although present in WEH1 231 cells, was not activated by TGF-β, nor was its substrate, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. These results identify αII-spectrin as a novel substrate that is cleaved during TGF-β-induced apoptosis. Our data provide the first evidence of calpain and caspase 3-independent cleavage of αII-spectrin during apoptosis and suggests that TGF-β induces apoptosis and αII-spectrin cleavage via a potentially novel caspase. This report also provides the first direct evidence of caspase 3 activation in WEH1 231 cells and indicates that at least two distinct apoptotic pathways exist."

This complex uses the energy of light to drive electron transfer from plastocyanin or cytochromec 6 to ferredoxin (Fd) (1Brettel K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 322-373Crossref Scopus (438) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, PSI is composed of at least five chloroplast-encoded polypeptides (PsaA, -B, -C, -I, and -J) and six nucleus-encoded polypeptides (PsaD, -E, -F, -G, -H, and -K) (2Golbeck J.H.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 322-373Crossref Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The terminal electron acceptors FA and FBare two [4Fe-4S] clusters coordinated by the 8–9-kDa subunit PsaC (3Hayashida N. Matsubayashi T. Shinozaki K. Sugiura M. Inoue K. Hiyama T. Curr.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5093-5099Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The midpoint potentials of FA and FB have been determined in spinach using low temperature electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and are −540 and −590 mV, respectively (6Heathcote P.

It is, however, not clear whether these values of midpoint potentials are valid at physiological temperature (see Ref. 1Brettel K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 322-373Crossref Scopus (438) Google Scholar for a discussion). A structural model for the PsaC subunit has been proposed based on the crystal structure of the 2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxin from Peptococcus asaccharolyticus (Peptococcus aerogenes ) (8Dunn P.P.J. Gray J.C.

The x-ray structure of PSI has been solved at a resolution of 4 Å in which the position of the three iron-sulfur clusters is clearly defined (10Schubert W.D. Klukas O. Krauss N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 741-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). One cluster is proximal to FX at a distance of 15 Å, whereas the more distal cluster is at a distance of 22 Å from FX. Interaction of the negatively charged Fd with the PSI complex is mediated by basic residues provided by the stromal subunits PsaC, -D, and -E, which are all required for efficient electron transfer to Fd (11Xu Q.

The present resolution of the PSI structure is, however, not sufficient to determine the orientation of the PsaC subunit within the complex in particular because of the local 2-fold pseudosymmetry of this subunit (19Klukas O.

More recent work still leads to contradictory results with reconstitution of modified PsaC supporting FA as the distal cluster (27Chiou H.C. Biggins J. J. Phys.

In this work, we have used in vivo site-directed mutagenesis of the PsaC subunit of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to modify residues that are located close to the iron-sulfur clusters to alter the electron transfer properties of these mutant PSI complexes. We have previously used a similar approach to alter the properties of cluster FA by modifying two positively charged residues located next to this cluster (31Fischer N. Setif P. Rochaix J.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Here we describe mutations close to FA that alter its EPR properties and that lead to partial destabilization of the complex; we show that introduction of basic residues or removal of acidic residues close to FB allows for stable assembly of the complex and leads to an increase of Fd affinity for the PSI complex. These results provide additional strong evidence that FB is the cluster interacting with Fd and the terminal electron acceptor of PSI.

IRL Press, Oxford1988: 253-275Google Scholar). The FA2 and FB1 mutations were introduced in the psaC coding region by single tube polymerase chain reaction as described (35Picard V. Ersdal-Badju E. Lu A. Bock S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The D9N, D9K, E46Q, and E46K mutations were introduced by a two-step amplification with pairs of complementary oligonucleotides that carry the desired mutation and introduce a restriction site into the sequence. The third base of the codon to be mutated carried a 2-fold degeneracy to generate DNA fragments carrying both mutations with a single pair of oligonucleotides. The following oligonucleotides were used: D9N and D9K, 5′-CGTTAAAATTTACAA(C/A)ACGTGTATT GGTTGTAC-3′ and 5′-GTACAAATACACGT(G/T)TTGTAAATTTTAACG-3′ (Mae II site introduced); E46Q and E46K, 5′-CAGCTCCACGCACT(A/C)AGGACTGTGTAGGTTG-3′ and 5′-GCAACCTACACAGTCCT(G/T)AGTGCGTGGAGCTGA-3′ (Dde I site introduced); FA2, 5′-CGCACTGAAGACTGTATTGGTTGCACTCAATGTGAAACAGCTT-3′; and FB1, 5′-ACAAGCACGTACACAACGTTTACAACCAACACAAGTATCGTAAAT-3′. These mutagenic oligonucleotides were used for amplification together with oligonucleotides complementary to the 5′ and 3′ ends ofpsaC and carrying Nde I and Bgl II restriction sites, respectively. The amplified DNA fragments were gel purified, digested with Nde I and Bgl II, cloned into the plasmid pBSEP5.8 aadA (Nde I/Bgl II), and sequenced. This plasmid contains a 5.8-kilobase Eco RI-Pst I fragment from the chloroplast Eco RI fragment R23 (36Rochaix J.-D. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 126: 597-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) with uniqueNde I and Bgl II restriction sites introduced at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the psaC coding sequence (31Fischer N. Setif P. Rochaix J.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This vector contains also an aadA expression cassette conferring spectinomycin and streptomycin resistance to C. reinhardtii (37Goldschmidt-Clermont M.

Chloroplast transformation of C. reinhardtii was carried out as described (38Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Harris E.H. Hosler J.P. Johnson A.M. Jones A.R. Randolph-Anderson B.L. Robertson D. Klein T.M.

Setif P. Rochaix J.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Integrity of the wild type and mutant PSI particles was tested by measuring the flash-induced absorption changes at 820 nm. These measurements showed that the PSI complexes had retained all the redox cofactors and were able to perform stable charge separation between P700+ and (FA, FB)− (data not shown). Decay kinetics of P700+ at 820 nm and ferredoxin reduction at 580 nm were recorded at 296 K with a microsecond time resolution as described previously (40Setif P.Q. Bottin H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8495-8504Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 41Setif P.Q. Bottin H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9059-9070Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the absence of Fd, an absorption change at 580 nm is also observed, and the contribution of P700+ decay is different in the presence or absence of Fd (for a detailed description see Ref. 41Setif P.Q. Bottin H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9059-9070Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These contributions were subtracted from the signals shown in Fig. 5. Recombinant C. reinhardtii ferredoxin was kindly provided by J.-P. Jacquot (42Rogers W.J. Hodges M. Decottignies P. Schmitter J.M. Gadal P. Jacquot J.P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Low temperature EPR spectroscopy was performed with a Bruker ESR300D X-band spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments helium cryostat. For chemical cross-linking,N -ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) andN -hydroxysulfosuccinimide ester (sulfo-NHS) were purchased from Sigma. Native Fd at 100 μm concentration was activated with 5 mm EDC, 10 mm sulfo-NHS in 10 mm MOPS, pH 6.5, and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The sample was then loaded on a PD10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. The brown band corresponding to Fd was eluted with 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and concentrated on a YM5 centricon centrifugation unit (Amicon). PSI particles at a concentration of 0.1 mg of chlorophyll/ml were incubated with 10 μm activated Fd in 1 mmascorbate, 0.03% β-dodecylmaltoside (CalBiochem), 3 mmMgCl2, and 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out according to Ref. 43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207523) Google Scholar. After electrophoresis, proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose as described (44Hippler M. Ratajczak R. Haehnel W. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 280-284Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar), probed with specific antibodies, and revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence using the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). We targeted two classes of residues in the PsaC subunit. First, we mutated Asp9 and Glu46, which are located one residue upstream of the first cysteine liganding clusters FB and FA, respectively. Asp9 has been proposed to mediate docking of PsaC on the core complex by interacting electrostatically with basic residues of PsaA or PsaB (24Rodday S.M. Do L.T. Chynwat V. Frank H.A. Biggins J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11832-11838Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis but also to assess whether these residues participate in determining the properties of the iron-sulfur clusters, we introduced the following changes into the PsaC subunit: D9N, D9K, E46Q, and E46K. In another set of mutants we exchanged three amino acids located between cysteines liganding FA by the corresponding residues located close to FB and vice versa . The following triple mutations were designed: I12V/T15K/Q16R and V49I/K52T/R53Q (for simplicity these sets of mutations will be referred to as FB1 and FA2, respectively). We used oligonucleotides carrying the desired mutations together with oligonucleotides flanking the psaC coding sequence to generate via polymerase chain reaction mutated versions of thepsaC gene (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The amplified products were cloned into a vector comprising a 5.8-kilobase DNA fragment of the chloroplast genome containing thepsaC gene and the aadA cassette that confers spectinomycin and streptomycin resistance to C. reinhardtii (37Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4083-4089Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The constructs were introduced into the chloroplast genome ofC. reinhardtii via biolistic transformation (38Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Harris E.H. Hosler J.P. Johnson A.M. Jones A.R. Randolph-Anderson B.L. Robertson D. Klein T.M. Shark K.B. Sanford J.C. Science. 1988; 240: 1534-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). The D9N, D9K, E46Q, and E46K mutations were transformed into a wild type strain, whereas FB1 and FA2 were transformed into a strain in which the psaC coding region had been deleted (45Fischer N. Stampacchia O. Redding K. Rochaix J.D. Mol Gen Genet. 1996; 251: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The transformants were selected on TAP medium plates supplemented with 150 μg/ml spectinomycin under low light conditions (5 μE/m2/s). Growing colonies were restreaked several times on the same selective medium and analyzed. The D9N, D9K, E46Q, and E46K mutations modify a restriction site in the genome. The homoplasmicity of the mutant genomes was verified by Southern blot analysis (data not shown, see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Because no wild type copy of the psaC gene is present in the recipient strain, the presence of the FB1 and FA2mutations in the transformants was checked by polymerase chain reaction and confirmed by sequencing of the amplification product (data not shown). Cells grown under dim light conditions (5 μE/m2/s) were dark adapted for 5 min before recording their fluorescence transients to determine whether they contained functional PSI (46Bennoun P. Delepelaire P. Edelman M. Hallick R.B. Chua N.H. Methods in Chloroplast Molecular Biology. Elsevier Biomedical Press, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1982: 25-38Google Scholar). With the exception of FB1, all the transformants displayed fluorescence transients comparable with wild type, indicating that they accumulate functional PSI (Fig.1). The fluorescence transient of the FB1 strain is intermediate between those characteristic of PSI-deficient (like psaC :: aadA ) and wild type strains. This suggests that the FB1 mutant accumulates PSI complexes that are not fully functional and/or present in reduced amounts. Growth properties of the transformants and control strains are shown in Table I. Both the FA2 and FB1 mutants are unable to grow photoautotrophically under 60 μE/m2/s illumination and are photosensitive at 600 μE/m2/s on TAP (acetate containing) medium, suggesting a defect in photosynthetic activity. The D9N, D9K, E46Q, and E46K mutations do not affect the growth properties of the transformants.Table IGrowth phenotypes of wild type and mutantsStrainTDLTLTHLHSMLHSMHLWT+++++psaC∷aadA+−−−−D9N+++++D9K+++++E46Q+++++E46K+++++FB1++−−−FA2++−−−psaC∷aadA , disruption of the psaC gene.

We determined the level of steady-state accumulation of the PSI complex by Western blot analysis of total cells extracts with antibodies raised against the PsaA, -D, and -E subunits of PSI. Fig.2 shows that PSI accumulates normally in the mutants except in the FA2 strain in which PSI is reduced to 20–30% of wild type level, as determined by PhosphorImager quantification (data not shown). This result shows that the FA2 mutations destabilize the complex, whereas all the other mutations have essentially no effect on PSI steady-state accumulation. The data also suggest that the PSI complex present in the FB1 strain is not fully functional, because the growth phenotype and fluorescence transient of this strain cannot be explained by a reduced PSI level (Fig. 1 and Table I). The PSI complex was purified by solubilization of thylakoid membranes with β-dodecylmaltoside and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Integrity of the PSI complex was checked by Western blot analysis and flash absorption spectroscopy at 820 nm (data not shown). Below 30 K, PSI undergoes a stable light-induced charge separation between P700+ and (FA, FB)− that can be observed by EPR spectroscopy. When samples are incubated in the dark with DCPIP to reduce P700+ and frozen in darkness, photoreduction of PSI leads to the formation of FA− and FB− that can be distinguished by their respective g values (FA−, 2.047, 1.945, and 1.857; FB−, 2.07, 1.932, and 1.878). Fig.3 shows light-induced EPR spectra of PSI complexes isolated from wild type and the different mutants measured after 2 min of illumination at 15 K and recorded in darkness (g values of FA− and FB− in theupper spectrum are indicated by continuous anddotted lines , respectively). Two other signals at g ≈ 1.91 and 2.11 were previously ascribed to a modified form of FA−, which is only observed in C. reinhardtii (16Fischer N. Hippler M. Setif P. Jacquot J.P. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Signals were normalized to the same concentration of intact PSI as measured by absorption changes at 820 nm. The amount of charge separation is the same (±10%) in all samples as measured by double integration of similar spectra recorded under nonsaturating conditions (2 mW microwave power). All the spectra gave g values similar to wild type values except for the FA2mutant, for which a new signal on the left part of the spectrum is clearly visible. To characterize this signal, EPR light minus dark difference spectra of wild type and FA2 PSI were recorded at 9 K and 20 mW microwave power (Fig.4). Under these conditions, the FB− signals are saturated and become hardly visible (compare WT spectra in Figs. 3 and 4). Comparison of the wild type and FA2 spectra in Fig. 4 indicates that, in the FA2 mutant, the new signal is most probably due to a modified FA−. The two lower spectra in Fig. 4represent a weighted difference between the FA2 and wild type spectra recorded at 9 K (Fig. 4, dif. 1 ) and 15 K (Fig. 4, dif. 2 ) in which the wild type spectrum has been multiplied by a factor of 0.65 to minimize the normal FA− signals. These two difference spectra share common features and three g values for the modified FA− signals can be determined around 2.08, 1.915, and 1.87. Assuming no significant saturation at 15 K of any of the FA− signals, the above weighted differences would mean that in 65% of the complexes, FA− is as in the wild type, whereas 35% feature a modified FA−.Figure 4Light-induced EPR spectra of PSI complexes isolated from wild type and from the FA2 mutant under conditions where the signals corresponding to FB are barely detectable. EPR conditions were as follows: temperature, 9 K; microwave power, 20 mW; modulation amplitude, 1 mT; microwave frequency, 9.419 Ghz. The samples were treated as in Fig. 3. The two lower spectra correspond to the weighted difference of the wild type and FA2 spectra from this figure (dif. 1 ) and from Fig. 3 (dif. 2 ). The wild type spectrum was in both case multiplied by a factor 0.65. Dif. indicates FA2 − 0.65*WT.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Electron transfer from PSI to Fd has been studied in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and in C. reinhardtii (16Fischer N. Hippler M. Setif P. Jacquot J.P. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 31Fischer N. Setif P. Rochaix J.D.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9059-9070Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). When isolated PSI complexes are illuminated by a saturating laser flash, Fd reduction is accompanied by an absorption change in the 400–600 nm range, which was shown to correspond to electron transfer from (FA, FB)− to Fd (40Setif P.Q. Bottin H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8495-8504Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 41Setif P.Q. Bottin H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9059-9070Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This process was studied mostly at 480 and 580 nm in the cyanobacterial system, whereas the measurements are restricted to a single wavelength (580 nm) in C. reinhardtii because of the large antenna absorption at 480 nm. A signal recorded in the absence of Fd was subtracted from that recorded in its presence, to eliminate contributions from other processes,i.e. P700+ formation and decay of carotenoid triplet states. Therefore, the signals shown in the upper part of Fig.5 correspond to electron transfer from (FA, FB)− to Fd. When absorption transients are measured with wild type PSI and Fd (Fig. 5, left upper panel , trace WT ), three phases of Fd reduction are observed: the two fastest phases (t 12 of <1 μs and about 4.5 μs) were identified as first-order components because their half-times are unaffected by Fd concentration and their amplitudes increase together with Fd concentration; the slowest phase was identified as a slower second-order component because its rate depends linearly upon Fd concentration (16Fischer N. Hippler M. Setif P. Jacquot J.P. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 31Fischer N. Setif P. Rochaix J.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The first-order phases are ascribed to electron transfer within a PSI-Fd complex formed prior to the laser flash, whereas the second-order phase is due to diffusion-limited Fd reduction by PSI that does not initially bind Fd. At 580 nm, the amplitude of the 4.5-μs phase is about 2-fold larger than the submicrosecond phase in WT PSI. The WT kinetic trace can be compared in th"

We now show the expression, purification, and kinetics of the autoprocessing reaction of a PR precursor linked to 53 amino acids of the native flanking transframe region (ΔTFP-p6pol) of Gag-Pol and containing its two native cleavage sites. The PR contains the two cysteine residues exchanged to alanines, mutations that do not alter the kinetics or the structural stability of the mature PR. ΔTFP-p6pol-PR, which encompasses the known PR inhibitor sequence Glu-Asp-Leu within ΔTFP, undergoes cleavage at the ΔTFP/p6pol and p6pol/PR sites in two consecutive steps to produce the mature PR. Both ΔTFP-p6pol-PR and p6pol-PR exhibit low intrinsic enzymatic activity. The appearance of the mature PR is accompanied by a large increase in catalytic activity. It follows first-order kinetics in protein concentration with a rate constant of 0.13 ± 0.01 min−1 in 0.1 m acetate at pH 4.8. The pH-rate profile for the observed first-order rate constant is bell-shaped with two ionizable groups of pK a 4.9 and 5.1. The rate constant also exhibits approximately 7-fold higher sensitivity to urea denaturation as compared with that of the mature PR, suggesting that the cleavage at the N terminus of the PR domain from the precursor leads to the stabilization of the dimeric structure.

Luftig R.B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 157: 153-185PubMed Google Scholar, 3Louis J.M. Dyda F. Nashed N.T. Kimmel A.R. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2105-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A protease (PR) cleavage site separates each of the subdomains of the precursors (Fig. 1). The 99-amino acid HIV-1 PR is encoded in the Pol open reading frame of the large Gag-Pol precursor and is flanked by the p6pol and reverse transcriptase (RT) domains at its N and C termini, respectively (2Oroszlan S. Luftig R.B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 157: 153-185PubMed Google Scholar, 3Louis J.M. Dyda F. Nashed N.T. Kimmel A.R. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2105-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The PR is a member of the family of aspartic acid proteases, active only as a homodimer, and is responsible for its own release from the Gag-Pol and the processing of Gag and Gag-Pol to release the mature structural and functional proteins (2Oroszlan S. Luftig R.B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 157: 153-185PubMed Google Scholar). Stage-specific regulation of PR activity in the viral replication cycle is crucial for proper assembly and maturation of the viral polyproteins to produce infectious virion. Maturation of the PR from Gag-Pol is suggested to occur after viral assembly and packaging (4Kaplan A.H. Manchester M. Swanstrom R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6782-6786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular alteration of the spatial arrangement or enzymatic activity of PR impairs processes of assembly and maturation leading to the formation of non-infectious virion (5Kaplan A.H. Zack J.A.

Thus, the PR has proven to be a promising target for anti-retroviral therapy, and various PR inhibitors are now in clinical use (9Flexner C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). The role of the native transframe region (TFR) sequences that flank the N terminus of PR in the Gag-Pol precursor is not fully understood but may function similar to a proregion found in zymogen forms of cellular aspartic proteases (see Fig. 1 and Ref. 10Khan A.R. James M.N. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 815-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The TFR does not exhibit a stable secondary or tertiary structure except for a small potential for helix formation at its N terminus (11Beissinger M. Paulus C. Bayer P. Wolf H. Rosch P. Wagner R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). TFR consists of two domains, a conserved N-terminal transframe octapeptide (TFP) followed by a 48–60 amino acid variable region p6pol. TFP and p6polare separated by a PR cleavage site (3Louis J.M. Dyda F. Nashed N.T. Kimmel A.R. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2105-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 12Phylip L.H. Mills J.S. Parten B.F. Dunn B.M. Kay J.

III. 1994; 317: 183-189PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of the TFR in fusion with PR has a negative effect on PR processing (14Partin K. Zybarth G. Ehrlich L. DeCrombrugghe M. Wimmer E. Carter C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4776-4780Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, addition of the NC domain to TFR-PR seems to relieve this negative effect possibly by influencing PR dimerization (15Zybarth G. Carter C. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3878-3884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The isolated TFP is a specific competitive inhibitor of the mature PR (3Louis J.M. Dyda F. Nashed N.T. Kimmel A.R. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2105-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanism by which TFR regulates the autocatalytic maturation of the PR from the Gag-Pol precursor is not fully understood. PR-mediated processing of Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins and particle maturation are complex events (for a review, see Ref. 16Vogt V.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 214: 95-131PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous studies using a model precursor, which consisted of the PR domain flanked at both ends by short native Gag-Pol sequences and an N-terminal maltose-binding domain (MBP), had shown that it undergoes maturation in two independent sequential steps. The first step involves the cleavage at the N terminus of the protease domain concomitant with a large increase in mature-like enzymatic activity and the appearance of the transient protease intermediate containing the flanking C-terminal RT polypeptide (17Louis J.M. Nashed N.T. Parris K.D. Kimmel A.R. Jerina D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7970-7974Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The flanking C-terminal RT sequences, which do not appear to influence the catalytic activity of the PR precursor, are cleaved subsequently in a second step via an intermolecular process (18Wondrak E.M. Nashed N.T. Haber M.T. Jerina D.M. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4477-4481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with results that blocking the cleavage at the p6pol-PR site leads to much reduced cleavage at the C terminus of PR (19Loeb D.D. Hutchison C.A. Edgell M.H.

In contrast to our observation that the model precursor exhibits low catalytic activity prior to the cleavage at the p6pol/PR junction, several reports of mutated PR fusion proteins that either contain a mutation at the p6pol/PR junction or contain short native or non-native sequences flanking the N terminus of PR possess wild type enzymatic activity (16Vogt V.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 214: 95-131PubMed Google Scholar, 21Zybarth G. Krausslich H.G. Partin K. Carter C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 240-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wondrak E.M.

This raised the question whether the MBP in our model construct impeded PR folding/dimerization, catalytic activity, and observed kinetics of the autocatalytic maturation reaction. In order to clarify these critical steps in the maturation cascade, we expressed and purified PR precursor proteins linked to the native TFR containing the native cleavage sites and characterized the autoprocessing reactions in vitro . To circumvent aggregation of the fusion proteins associated with intermolecular disulfide bond formation that may lead to anomalous kinetic measurements of the autoprocessing reaction, we used PR fusions with Cys residues replaced by Ala, mutations that do not alter the kinetic parameters of the mature enyzme. By using these TFR-PR constructs we examined the mechanism and the pH-rate profile of the autocatalytic maturation reaction, and the stability of the proteins by product analyses and kinetics. In addition and more importantly, we show that two temporally regulated N-terminal cleavages, first at the native TFP/p6pol followed by cleavage at the p6pol/PR, are crucial for PR maturation and enzymatic activity. The buffers employed in this study are as follows: buffer A, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm benzamidine HCl, 5 mm DTT; buffer B, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 m guanidine HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT; buffer C, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm DTT, 5 mm EDTA, 5m urea; buffer D, 100 mm acetate, pH 5.0, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100. The HIV-1 PR linked to native transframe region was expressed inEscherichia coli as described (24Cheng Y.S. McGowan M.H. Kettner C.A. Schloss J.V. Erickson-Viitanen S. Yin F.H. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 87: 243-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) using the expression vector pET11a and host bacteria, BL21 (DE3 (25Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar)). The native viral sequence spans nucleotide positions 2093–2549 of HIV-1 isolate HIVHXB2 (GenBankTM accession number HIVHXB2CG). Cys-63 and Cys-95 in the PR domain was either individually or collectively substituted to Ala using the polymerase chain reaction (26Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7677Crossref PubMed Scopus (2104) Google Scholar, 27Davis D.A. Dorsey K. Wingfield P.T. Stahl S.J. Kaufman J. Fales H.M. Levine R.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2482-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The cloning strategy that was employed introduces four non-native amino acids, Met-Glu-Phe-Met, linked to the fourth amino acid of TFP from its N terminus beginning with the sequence Glu-Asp-Leu-Ala-Phe-Leu-Gln-Gly-Lys. This precursor is termed ΔTFP-p6pol-PR (see Fig. 1), where Leu-Gln-Gly-Lys is the N terminus of p6pol. Cells were grown in minimal media at 37 °C, 30% pO2, pH 7, in a 2-liter Braun model MD fermentor. When the cell density reached an optical density of 0.5 at 600 nm, protein expression was induced by the addition of 2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 32 °C for 4 h. The cell pellet (∼25 g wet weight) was suspended in 5 volumes of buffer A. Cells were lysed by the French press, and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 45 min. The insoluble recombinant protein (inclusion bodies) was washed by resuspension with buffer A containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 1 m urea, and the suspension was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. This step was repeated twice, and the final pellet was solubilized with 30 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5 containing 8 m guanidine HCl and 5 mm DTT. After clarification of the extract by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm (45Ti rotor, Beckman) for 1 h, the sample was applied to a Superdex 200 column (6 × 60 cm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer B and run at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. Fractions containing the precursor proteins (ΔTFP-p6pol-PR and p6pol-PR, see Fig. 2) and the smaller molecular weight mature PR that is released by autoprocessing were well separated. Column fractions were analyzed on 18% SDS-polyacrylamide pre-cast gels (Novex) after removing the guanidine HCl from the protein fractions (28Pepinsky R.B. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 195: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The peak fraction containing the two PR fusion proteins was further fractionated by RP-HPLC on POROS RII resin (Perspective Biosystems) using a linear gradient of 0–60% acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid for a period of 12 min to attain nearly homogeneous proteins. Protein fractions were dialyzed (Slide-A-Lyzer 10K dialysis cassettes, Pierce) in 1000-fold excess of 25 mm formic acid, pH 2.8, at 4 °C for 1.5–2 h, concentrated on centricon 10 concentrators (Amicon, MA), and stored at 4 °C. Alternatively, protein fractions after RP-HPLC separation were lyophilized, dissolved to a concentration of 20–30 μm in buffer C, and stored frozen in aliquots at −70 °C. Protein concentrations for kinetic studies were determined as described previously (22Wondrak E.M. Louis J.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12957-12962Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto ProBlott membranes (Perkin-Elmer). The bands were excised and applied to a Blott cartridge (Perkin-Elmer), and each sample was subjected to 20 cycles of N-terminal sequencing using an Applied Biosystems model 477A protein sequencer (Perkin-Elmer) to confirm the N-terminal residues of ΔTFP-p6pol-PR and p6pol-PR. Two methods were utilized for protein renaturation of the precursor proteins ΔTFP-p6pol-PR and p6pol-PR. 2.5 μl of protein in 25 mm formic acid was diluted in 40-fold excess of appropriate buffer (formate, acetate, or phosphate) to attain final pH values between 4 and 6.5. Alternatively 10 μl of protein in buffer C was diluted with 90 μl of buffer D to compare the first-order rate constant for the N-terminal maturation reaction of p6pol-PR with that of the model precursor reported previously (17Louis J.M. Nashed N.T. Parris K.D. Kimmel A.R. Jerina D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7970-7974Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The wild type and mutant mature proteases (17–18 μm in buffer B) were renatured by 33-fold dilution in buffer D or 50-fold from 50 mm formic acid, pH 2.6. The kinetic parameters of the mature wild type PR and its mutants were measured using the substrate Lys-Ala-Arg-Val-Nle-Phe(NO2)-Glu-Ala-Nle-NH2(where Phe(NO2) is 4-nitrophenylalanine) (California Peptide Research) at 25 °C as described previously (17Louis J.M.

Reactions were carried out at 25 °C, and aliquots were drawn at various time intervals and assayed for enzymatic activity or subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting and densitometry as described previously (17Louis J.M.

A plot of initial rateversus protein concentration is linear (see inset of Fig. 5), and the slope of the line is the observed first-order rate constant. Alternatively, the first-order rate constant is calculated by fitting the first-order equation to data using the program Enzfitter (published by Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). Sodium acetate buffers (100 mm) containing 100 mm NaCl and the same additives as that of buffer D, but without Triton X-100, were used to obtain the pH-rate profile. The pK a values were calculated using the program Enzfitter and the equation ((k cat/K m)H = (k cat/K m)lim/(1 + [H+]/K a1 +K a2/[H+])) (see Ref.29Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons Inc., New York1975: 892Google Scholar). To circumvent any problems associated with the oxidation of Cys thiol groups in wild type PR which leads to protein aggregation and complicates kinetic experiments, PR mutants with either Cys-67 or Cys-95 or both residues substituted with Ala were constructed fused to the transframe region (ΔTFP-p6pol-PR, see Fig.1). Expression of the wild type and mutant constructs in E. coli results in the efficient processing of the precursors to release mature PR. The mature wild type and Cys to Ala mutants were purified. Similar to the wild type enzyme (18Wondrak E.M. Nashed N.T. Haber M.T. Jerina D.M. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4477-4481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22Wondrak E.M. Louis J.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12957-12962Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the Cys to Ala mutants exhibit >95% of their enzymatic activity instantaneously with no lag period at pH 5.0 when a denatured solution of the protein in buffer B is folded by 33-fold dilution in buffer D. The kinetic parameters for the wild type and Cys mutants of PR-catalyzed hydrolysis of a chromogenic substrate under the same conditions are nearly identical (TableI). The dimer stability of the C67A/C95A mutant mature PR examined by urea denaturation shows 50% loss in enzymatic activity at 1.8 m urea unchanged from that of the wild type PR (see below). Thus, mutating the Cys residues to Ala does not appear to alter the environment of the active site of the mature HIV-1 PR or the overall structure of the enzyme (30Wu J. Adomat J.M. Ridky T.W.

In all constructs the induced protein accumulates in the form of inclusion bodies. Analysis of the inclusion bodies by SDS-PAGE verified the presence of a major band that corresponds in mobility to the mature PR. The mature PR released via autoprocessing of ΔTFP-p6pol-PR in the double Cys mutant (C67A/C95A) also represented a major portion (95%) of the total induced protein, but unlike the expression pattern observed with the construct bearing the wild type PR, two novel precursor forms were also present in nearly equal amounts (<5%). These two precursor proteins were separated from the mature PR by gel filtration chromatography under denaturing conditions (Fig.2, lanes 1 and 4 ). The two precursor forms were separated by reverse-phase HPLC. N-terminal sequence analyses show that the larger of the two proteins corresponds to the intact ΔTFP-p6pol-PR, whereas the smaller has the N-terminal sequence Leu-Gln-Gly-Lys corresponding to the N terminus of p6pol (see Fig. 1). Purified proteins corresponding to ΔTFP-p6pol-PR and p6pol-PR (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 3, respectively) were used for studies of the autocatalytic maturation of the PR. ΔTFP-p6pol-PR has two known native PR cleavage sites, ΔTFP/p6pol and p6pol/PR (see Fig. 1). Since PR-catalyzed hydrolyses of peptides having amino acid sequences corresponding to the two cleavage sites, TFP/p6pol and p6pol-PR, have comparable kinetic parameters (12Phylip L.H. Mills J.S.

Wondrak, unpublished results.we anticipated complex kinetics and multiple products for the maturation of the PR from ΔTFP-p6pol-PR. In contrast, ΔTFP-p6pol-PR undergoes an ordered two-step maturation reaction (see Fig. 3). The first step involves the cleavage of the peptide bond at the ΔTFP/p6pol site to produce the transient intermediate p6pol-PR, which is subsequently converted to the mature PR. Although detailed kinetics of the conversion of ΔTFP-p6pol-PR to the intermediate p6pol-PR was not carried out due to limited availability of the purified protein, the half-life (t 12) of the reaction was estimated by comparing the relative band intensities of the starting material and the intermediate assuming first-order kinetics (see Fig.3 A ). The rate of formation of p6pol-PR from the ΔTFP-p6pol-PR precursor (t 12 ∼20 min, k 1 ∼0.035 min−1) is about three times slower than that of the disappearance of p6pol-PR and release of PR (t 12 ∼6 min, k 2 ∼0.12 min−1) at pH 5.4 (Scheme I).ΔTFP­p6pol­PR →k1Step 1 p6pol­PR →k2Step 2 PRSCHEME 1A plot of the rate of appearance of enzymatic activityversus time is characterized by a lag period followed by a first-order process (Fig. 3 B ) indicating that cleavage at the N terminus of the PR (p6pol/PR site) is required for the activity of PR. Thus, the rate of appearance of mature-like catalytic activity is concomitant with the cleavage at the p6pol/PR site (Step 2) and not of the cleavage at the TFP/p6pol site (Step 1). The hydrophilic ΔTFP, which is known to inhibit the mature PR in a pH-dependent manner (3Louis J.M. Dyda F. Nashed N.T. Kimmel A.R. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2105-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), may play a role in determining this stepwise cleavage. Further investigation with the PR precursor having the entire TFP domain is required to assess fully its regulatory role. Similar to the wild type mature PR and its Cys mutants, the denatured p6pol-PR folds instantaneously as indicated by the lack of observable time-dependent change in the intrinsic protein fluorescence (17Louis J.M. Nashed N.T. Parris K.D. Kimmel A.R. Jerina D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7970-7974Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The folded p6pol-PR undergoes a time-dependent maturation reaction concomitant with increase in enzymatic activity. At pH ≥5.0, the reaction proceeds in a single step to produce the mature enzyme, whereas at pH <5.0 it is characterized by the appearance and disappearance of a single protein intermediate that migrates between p6pol-PR and PR (see Fig. 4). This intermediate (termed Δp6pol-PR), which is generated by cleavage at the Leu-24↓Gln-25 site within p6pol, was confirmed by subjecting an aliquot of the reaction mixture to RP-HPLC linked to a electrospray-mass spectrometer (data not shown; see Fig. 1). This observation is in agreement with a previous report by Zybarth et al. (21Zybarth G. Krausslich H.G. Partin K. Carter C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 240-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The maturation reaction of p6pol-PR displays good first-order kinetics between pH 4.0 and 6.5 as indicated by a linear relation between the rate of increase in mature-like catalytic activity and protein concentration (inset, Fig.5). Plots of the measured densities corresponding to the starting material and the product (mature PR) and the rate of increase in mature-like catalytic activityversus time are shown superimposed on each other (Fig. 5). The first-order rate constants for the maturation reaction under different conditions are shown in TableII. The first-order rate constant displays a bell-shaped dependence on pH with two ionizable groups having pK a values of 4.9 and 5.1 (Fig.6). The complete pH profile for the maturation of p6pol-PR is in agreement with studies of the time-dependent maturation of a mini precursor in which a mutant HIV-1 PR (A28S) was linked to 25 amino acids of the flanking p6pol sequence (32Ido E. Han H.P. Kezdy F.J. Tang J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24359-24366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Co E. Koelsch G. Lin Y. Ido E. Hartsuck J.A. Tang J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1248-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Also, the higher pK a of 5.1 is in agreement with the pK a values of 4.8 and 5.2 obtained for the mature PR (34Polgar L. Szeltner Z. Boros I. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9351-9357Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and PR-ΔPol (18Wondrak E.M. Nashed N.T. Haber M.T. Jerina D.M. Louis J.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12957-12962Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, the lower pK a of 4.9 is about 1.8 pH units higher than that observed for the mature PR.Table IIFirst-order rate constants for the N-terminal maturation reaction of the HIV-1 PRPrecursorkpHUreamin−1mp6pol-PR0.13 ± 0.014.80p6pol-PR0.047 ± 0.015.00.5MBP-ΔTF-PR-ΔPol0.033 ± 0.0035.00.5100 mm sodium acetate buffer contained 1 mm DTT and 1 mm EDTA. Open table in a new tab 100 mm sodium acetate buffer contained 1 mm DTT and 1 mm EDTA. Our results for the processing of p6pol-PR to mature PR are consistent with the mechanism proposed for the maturation of PR from the model precursor MBP-ΔTF-PR-ΔPol (17Louis J.M. Nashed N.T. Parris K.D. Kimmel A.R. Jerina D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7970-7974Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The pH-rate profile (Fig.6) and the inhibition constant (17Louis J.M. Nashed N.T. Parris K.D. Kimmel A.R. Jerina D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7970-7974Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) for the maturation reaction are similar to that reported for the mature PR. These studies indicate that the active site of the p6pol-PR precursor resembles that of the mature PR. The concomitant increase in mature-like enzymatic activity and appearance of the mature PR product (Figs. 4 and 5) are consistent with a single rate-limiting step involving the cleavage of the scissile bond at the p6pol/PR junction. The first-order kinetics for the maturation of the PR from the native precursor p6pol-PR indicate that this N-terminal cleavage reaction occurs intramolecularly similar to that observed for the model precursor MBP-ΔTF-PR-ΔRT. Also, the observation of first-order kinetics at pH 4.5 where the minor species Δp6pol-PR accumulates indicates that this intermediate form is not mandatory in the reaction pathway. This precursor form could be liberated either through an intramolecular process at a competing site that becomes available for productive binding and hydrolysis below pH 5 or through an intermolecular process by the released mature PR. The formation of these intermediate precursors under suboptimal conditions for the autoprocessing reaction is similar to that observed for the conversion of zymogen form of the gastric protease pepsinogen, which unlike retroviral proteases is a monomeric enzyme (10Khan A.R. James M.N. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 815-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Pepsinogen differs from mature pepsin by a 44-amino acid long positively charged N-terminal proregion. Below pH 2.0, pepsinogen is converted in a single step through an intramolecular maturation process to pepsin with a homogenous N terminus, whereas at pH 4.0 the activation product is heterogeneous with multiple N-terminal products (35al-Janabi J. Hartsuck J.A. Tang J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4628-4632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Comparisons of the first-order rate constants for the autoprocessing of the model precursor MBP-ΔTF-PR-ΔPol and the native precursor p6pol-PR are similar indicating that the MBP domain, which mimics nearly the size of the Gag domain of Gag-Pol, does not perturb the maturation reaction in any significant manner. Thus, the maturation of PR from the native TFR-PR precursor appears to be a sequential multi-step ordered process that involves at least two peptide bond cleavages upstream to the PR domain prior to the generation of optimal enzymatic activity. In the first step, ΔTFP-p6pol-PR is converted to p6pol-PR with the same low catalytic activity as that of ΔTFP-p6pol-PR. It is most likely that cleavage at the ΔTFP/p6pol site also occurs via an intramolecular mechanism as an increase in mature-like catalytic activity is concomitant only with cleavage at the p6pol-PR site (Step 2). The dimeric form of p6pol-PR, which is mandatory for the formation of an active site capable of supporting a hydrolytic reaction, is highly sensitive to urea denaturation compared with the mature enzyme (Fig. 7). Loss in enzymatic activity relates to loss of stable tertiary structure (18Wondrak E.M. Nashed N.T. Haber M.T. Jerina D.M. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4477-4481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22Wondrak E.M. Louis J.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12957-12962Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), suggesting that p6pol-PR is structurally less stable than the mature PR. This result complements our previous studies showing that the PR domain when fused to 19 amino acids of the flanking C-terminal reverse transcriptase sequence (PR-ΔPol) or short native or non-native sequences at its N terminus is also less stable toward urea denaturation (18Wondrak E.M. Nashed N.T. Haber M.T. Jerina D.M. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4477-4481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22Wondrak E.M. Louis J.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12957-12962Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The above results are also consistent with results showing that the mature PR is largely dimeric above 10 nm (18Wondrak E.M. Nashed N.T. Haber M.T. Jerina D.M. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4477-4481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), whereas inactive N-terminally extended forms of the PR linked to the TFR fail to dimerize in a qualitative assay (15Zybarth G. Carter C. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3878-3884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that the maturation reaction of the native p6pol-PR is monitored by following the increase in enzymatic activity (see Fig. 3 B and 5) is clear evidence that there is a large difference between the catalytic activity of the mature PR and that of p6pol-PR. The low catalytic activity seems to be intrinsic to the PR when linked to the native TFR having the native cleavage sites. This low catalytic activity could be either due to a conformational difference of the dimeric precursor or can be an apparent effect of the equilibrium that largely favors the unfolded or partially folded form of the protein relative to the folded enzymatically active dimer. In contrast to our results that indicate that native TFR sequences perturb the structure and PR activity, other PR precursors containing truncated p6pol or short non-native regions flanking the N terminus of PR exhibited catalytic activities that are comparable with that of the mature PR (21Zybarth G. Krausslich H.G. Partin K. Carter C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 240-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wondrak E.M. Louis J.M.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1248-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These results emphasize the fact that the full-length TFR with its native cleavage sites is critical for the regulated processing of PR from the Gag-Pol and optimal catalytic activity. In accordance with this interpretation, a blocking mutation at the p6pol/PR cleavage site in the Gag-Pol precursor allows the maturation of PR at the native TFP/p6pol and PR/RT sites to release a p6pol-PR intermediate, which is defective in Gag processing and in viral infectivity (36Tessmer U. Krausslich H.G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3459-3463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We are thankful to Drs. A. M. Gronenborn and G. M. Clore for discussions; P. Spinella for N-terminal sequencing; J.

https://openalex.org/W2031551101,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) hyperplasia is a fundamental physiological response to cold; it involves an acute phase of mitotic cell growth followed by a prolonged differentiation phase. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are key regulators of fatty acid metabolism and adipocyte differentiation and may therefore mediate important metabolic changes during non-shivering thermogenesis. In the present study we have investigated PPAR mRNA expression in relation to peroxisome proliferation in rat BAT during cold acclimatization. By immunoelectron microscopy we show that the number of peroxisomes per cytoplasmic volume and acyl-CoA oxidase immunolabeling density remained constant (thus increasing in parallel with tissue mass and cell number) during the initial proliferative phase and the acute thermogenic response but increased after 14 days of cold exposure, correlating with terminal differentiation of BAT. A pronounced decrease in BAT PPARα and PPARγ mRNA levels was found within hours of exposure to cold, which was reversed after 14 days, suggesting a role for either or both of these subtypes in the proliferation and induction of peroxisomes and peroxisomal β-oxidation enzymes. In contrast, PPARδ mRNA levels increased progressively during cold exposure. Transactivation assays in HIB 1B and HEK-293 cells demonstrated an adrenergic stimulation of peroxisome proliferator response element reporter activity via PPAR, establishing a role for these nuclear receptors in hormonal regulation of gene transcription in BAT. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) hyperplasia is a fundamental physiological response to cold; it involves an acute phase of mitotic cell growth followed by a prolonged differentiation phase. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are key regulators of fatty acid metabolism and adipocyte differentiation and may therefore mediate important metabolic changes during non-shivering thermogenesis. In the present study we have investigated PPAR mRNA expression in relation to peroxisome proliferation in rat BAT during cold acclimatization. By immunoelectron microscopy we show that the number of peroxisomes per cytoplasmic volume and acyl-CoA oxidase immunolabeling density remained constant (thus increasing in parallel with tissue mass and cell number) during the initial proliferative phase and the acute thermogenic response but increased after 14 days of cold exposure, correlating with terminal differentiation of BAT. A pronounced decrease in BAT PPARα and PPARγ mRNA levels was found within hours of exposure to cold, which was reversed after 14 days, suggesting a role for either or both of these subtypes in the proliferation and induction of peroxisomes and peroxisomal β-oxidation enzymes. In contrast, PPARδ mRNA levels increased progressively during cold exposure. Transactivation assays in HIB 1B and HEK-293 cells demonstrated an adrenergic stimulation of peroxisome proliferator response element reporter activity via PPAR, establishing a role for these nuclear receptors in hormonal regulation of gene transcription in BAT. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor(s) acyl-CoA oxidase brown adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase thymidine kinase luciferase human embryonic kidney polymerase chain reaction base pair cytomegalovirus rapid amplification of cDNA ends untranslated region electrophoretic mobility shift assay peroxisome proliferator response element retinoid X receptor N -[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N ,N ,N -trimethylammonium methyl sulfate, C/EBP, CCAAT/enhances binding protein Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs)1 are ligand-activated transcription factors that control the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism.

These subtypes exhibit tissue-specific expression and selectivity of ligand activation. PPARα is the predominant subtype in rodent liver. Disruption of the mouse PPARα gene by homologous recombination demonstrated the important role for this PPAR subtype in the transcriptional regulation of peroxisome proliferator-responsive genes and in hepatic peroxisome proliferation (5Motojima K.

PPARγ expression is highest in adipose tissue. Ectopic expression of PPARγ (and to a lesser extent PPARα) can effectively induce adipose phenotype such as fat accumulation and induction of adipose markers in fibroblasts and premyotic cells (11Brun R.P.

PPARδ is expressed ubiquitously. Its physiological function is not yet clear, but like the other PPAR subtypes PPARδ has also been implicated in adipocyte development (15Amri E.Z. Bonino F.

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a major site for non-shivering thermogenesis because of a very high capacity for uncoupled oxidation of fatty acids. Norepinephrine released from sympathetic nerves innervating the tissue acts both as an acute inducer of the thermogenic function and as a promoter of tissue recruitment (for review, see Ref.16Cannon B. Jacobsson A. Rehnmark S. Nedergaard J. Int. J. Obes. 1996; 20: S36-S42Google Scholar). Increased BAT metabolic activity occurs in concert with increased expression of some adipocyte genes (i.e. lipoprotein lipase (LPL), uncoupling protein, and C/EBPβ) (17Mitchell J.R.D. Jacobsson A. Kirchgessner T.G. Schotz M.C. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E500-E506PubMed Google Scholar, 18Jacobsson A. Stadler U. Glotzer M.A. Kozak L.P. J. Biol.

Smith R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1964; 23: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar,22Thomson J.F. Habeck D.A. Nance S.L. Beetham K.L. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 41: 312-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial ultrastructure changes (23Barnard T. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1969; 29: 311-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and the tissue mass increases about 3–4-fold after 2 weeks of cold exposure (21Cameron I.L. Smith R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1964; 23: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 24Page E. Babineau L.M. Rev. Can. Biol. Exp. 1950; 9: 202-206Google Scholar). This increase is caused by activation of cellular proliferation within the tissue, which reaches its maximum after 1 week of cold exposure (25Hunt T.E. Hunt E.A. Anat. Rec. 1967; 157: 537-546Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar,26Rehnmark S. Nedergaard J. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 180: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The cessation of mitotic cell growth in the tissue is followed by differentiation of the cells into brown adipocytes (27Lean M. Branch W.J. James W. Jennings G. Ashwell M. Biosci. Rep. 1983; 3: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 28Arnold J. Patel H.V. Ridley R.G. Freeman K.B. Biosci. Rep. 1985; 5: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The heat is produced mainly by mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, which is increased dramatically through the action of the BAT-specific mitochondrial uncoupling protein that uncouples cellular respiration from oxidative phosphorylation (29Nicholls D.G. Locke R.M. Physiol. Rev. 1984; 64: 1-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). Cold acclimatization of rats results in proliferation of peroxisomes (30Ahlabo I. Barnard T. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1971; 19: 670-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and in a 10-fold induction of peroxisomal β-oxidation enzyme activity (31Nedergaard J. Alexson S. Cannon B. Am. J. Physiol. 1980; 239: C208-C216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because PPAR is a known mediator of peroxisome proliferation and PPAR subtypes have been implicated in adipogenesis, physiological stimulation of BAT offers an excellent in vivo model for studying PPARs in relation to adipogenesis and peroxisome proliferation under physiological conditions. In an attempt to unravel the biological functions of PPARα, PPARγ, and PPARδ in a physiological context, we have investigated the expression of these receptors in rat BAT during cold acclimatization and correlated the expression of the different receptor subtypes with the particular metabolic and developmental state of the tissue. Quantitative analysis of peroxisome proliferation in BAT was performed by immunoelectron microscopy. The data indicate that peroxisome proliferation correlates with the expression of PPARα and γ. In a transactivation assay utilizing the brown preadipose cell line HIB 1B, it was found that norepinephrine, 8-bromo-cAMP, and forskolin induced AOx-tk-Luc reporter gene activity, suggesting that the β-adrenergic signaling pathway can activate endogenous PPARs. The PPAR dependence of this activation was confirmed in a cell line (HEK-293) that is devoid of detectable endogenous PPARs, suggesting that PPARs are involved in the thermogenic activation of BAT and proliferation of peroxisomes in this tissue. BAT may thus serve as a promising in vivo system for identification of the physiological ligands for PPARs and elucidation of the biological functions of these receptors. PCR template cDNA was synthesized from 10 μg of BAT RNA utilizing a cDNA synthesis system (Life Technologies, Inc.). Two sets of degenerate oligonucleotide primers were designed to amino acid regions conserved in mouse and Xenopus PPARγ. The 5′-primer corresponds to amino acids TVDFSSI near the amino terminus (5′-GCGGATCCAC(A/T)GT(A/T)GA(T/C)TT(T/C)TCCAGCAT-3′), and the 3′-primer corresponds to amino acids QEIY(R/K)DMY at the carboxyl terminus (5′-GCGGTACCTACATGTC(T/C)TTGTA(A/G)ATCTC(T/C)TG-3′). Bam HI and Kpn I recognition sites were included at the 5′-end of the oligonucleotide primers for cloning purposes. PCRs performed as described previously (32Wong C.W. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 551-562PubMed Google Scholar) yielded a 1,325-bp cDNA fragment. This fragment was digested with Bam HI and Kpn I resulting in a 980-bp fragment that was cloned into the pBluescript II KS cloning vector (Stratagene) and partially sequenced in the core facility (CyberGene) by cycle sequencing. To generate a rat PPARδ probe, two oligonucleotides were designed to amino acid regions conserved in mouse and human PPARδ (NUC1). The 5′-primer corresponds to the amino-terminal amino acids MEQPQEEAPE (5′-ATGGACAGCCACAGGAGGACCCTGAGG-3′), and the 3′-primer corresponds to the carboxyl-terminal amino acids LLQE- IYKDMY (5′-GTCCTTGTAGATTCCTGGAGCAGGGGTGC-3′). PCRs utilizing BAT cDNA and the Expand™ Long Template PCR system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) resulted in amplification of a 1,323-bp PPARδ. This 1,323-bp PCR product was cloned into the pCRII cloning vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Rat interscapular BAT mRNA was purified utilizing Ultraspec™ (Biotecx) and oligo(dT)-cellulose (Stratagene) and utilized to construct a cDNA library in the pBKCMV phagemid according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The 980-bp PPARγBam HI/Kpn I cDNA fragment and the 1,323-bp PPARδ cDNA fragment were labeled by random priming and used independently to screen the rat BAT cDNA library. Four independent PPARγ plaques were purified and the cDNA rescued into pBKCMV plasmid and sequenced (CyberGene). Three of the isolated clones corresponded to the full-length rPPARγ2 subtype (clones 9, 10, and 11) and one to the full-length PPARγ subtype (clone 7). Two independent clones containing partial PPARδ coding sequences were purified and the cDNA rescued as pBKCMV plasmid. RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) was employed to obtain the 5′-UTR and amino-terminal sequences of the PPARδ subtype utilizing the Marathon-Ready cDNA system (CLONTECH) and the gene-specific primer (5′-CGCTTCCAGAAGTGCCTGGCACTCGGCATG-3′). A 654-bp cDNA fragment was cloned into the pCR2.1 cloning vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (B&K Universal AB, Stockholm) weighing about 150 g were preacclimated to standard animal house conditions for 1 week before handling. For thermoregulatory studies, rats were housed individually at 28 °C (controls) or in the cold (4 °C) for the periods of time indicated. Two separate time course experiments were carried out, one with three rats in each time point (up to 21 days in the cold) and another experiment with two animals in each time point (up to 28 days in the cold). Interscapular BAT was dissected out and processed individually for RNA purification utilizing the Ultraspec system (Biotecx). This method was also utilized to isolate RNA from HIB 1B and HEK-293 cells. The RNA samples were resolved in 1.2% agarose gels containing 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, and 6% formaldehyde. The gels, containing 10 μg of total RNA/well, were blotted onto Hybond-N nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by capillary transfer. Membranes were hybridized with32P-labeled cDNA probes in a hybridization buffer containing 5% SDS, 400 mm NaPO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 50% formamide. PPAR Northern analyses were carried out with full-length probes to PPARα (accession number M88592 (33Göttlicher M. Widmark E. Li Q. Gustafsson J.-Å. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

After 16-h hybridizations at 42 °C, blots were washed at 53 °C in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, and 1 mmEDTA and exposed to a PhosphorImaging plate (Fuji). Female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats weighing approximately 150 g were housed individually at 5 °C or at standard animal house conditions (23 °C). All rats had free access to food (rat pellets, Oriental M, Tokyo) and water. Tissue processing and immunohistochemical staining of Lowicryl-K4membedded specimens, using the protein A-gold technique, were performed as described previously (39Usuda N. Reddy M.K. Hashimoto T. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Lab. Invest. 1988; 58: 100-111PubMed Google Scholar). The infiltration of the resin into BAT isolated from control rats was highly inefficient, probably because of high fat content. Therefore, tissues isolated from rats housed in the cold for 4 days represent the shortest time point available for analysis. After the immunostaining, the sections were stained with 1% uranyl acetate solution and were examined in a Hitachi H700 electron microscope at an accelerated voltage of 150 kV. The morphometric analysis of changes in the peroxisome volume and labeling densities was performed as described previously (39Usuda N. Reddy M.K. Hashimoto T. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Lab. Invest. 1988; 58: 100-111PubMed Google Scholar), using 20 electron micrographs of each period of cold acclimatization selected from 200 pictures. The immunostaining was performed with all samples at the same time to equalize the staining conditions. The analysis was performed with a computer-assisted image analyzer, Digigramer G (Muto Co., Tokyo, Japan). The peroxisome volume density was calculated as the ratio of the area of peroxisomes to the cytoplasmic area excluding the lipid droplets. The labeling density was expressed as the number of gold particles/μm2 of peroxisome area, and the immunolabel concentration was expressed as the number of gold particles/unit of cytoplasmic volume by multiplying the peroxisome volume density with the labeling density. The statistical analyses were done using analysis of variance and Student's t tests. The PPRE probe in our EMSA was a double-stranded oligonucleotide, 5′-TCGAGACGTGACCTTTGTCCTGGTC-3′, derived from the AOx PPRE, which was labeled by a Klenow fill-in reaction in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. Nuclear protein extracts were obtained from cells harvested in TEN buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 10 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl) by extraction in the presence of complete TM (EDTA-free) protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. PPARγ (6 × His-tagged full-length) and RXRα (6 × His-tagged full-length) were translated utilizing the Promega TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate system. 25-μl incubation mixes contained 2–5 μg of protein (nuclear extract), 20,000 cpm of probe, 20 mm KCl in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol, 500 ng of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), and 500 ng of sonicated salmon sperm DNA. Samples were resolved on a 5% polyacrylamide gel. Antibodies used were RXRα mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against the ligand binding domain, which were a kind gift from Dr. Pierre Chambon, and PPARy2 mouse monoclonal antibody (sc 7273x) from Santa Cruz Biotech Inc. Specific competitors corresponding to DR2 (5′-CGACCCCAGTTCACCAGGTCAGGGCT-3′) and DR5 (5′-TCGACTGGGTTCACCGAAAGTTCACAGTC-3′) and an unspecific competitor were used as indicated. The dried gels were exposed to film overnight. For cell culture experiments, all reagents were purchased from Life Technologies unless specified otherwise. HEK-293 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection and were maintained in a 50:50 mix of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and gentamycin (25 μg/ml). HIB 1B cells, kindly provided by Dr. Bruce Spiegelman, were maintained in preadipocyte medium, a 50:50 mix of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and gentamycin (25 μg/ml). The luciferase reporter plasmids utilized in our experiments contain the herpesvirus thymidine kinase (tk) basal promoter linked upstream of the luciferase gene (tk-Luc). PPAR activity was monitored by transfection of a AOx-tk-Luc plasmid, which contains two copies of the AOx PPRE upstream of the basal tk promoter in the tk-Luc plasmid. The CMV-α, CMV-γ2, and CMV-δ plasmids contain the open reading frames of the PPARα cDNA (accession number M88592 (33Göttlicher M. Widmark E. Li Q. Gustafsson J.-Å. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4653-4657Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar)) and PPARγ2 and δ cDNAs described here, respectively. For transient transfections, cells were plated at a density of 100,000 cells/30-mm plate 24 h before transfection. DNA:DOTAP mixes were prepared as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were incubated for 6 h with 1.25 μg of reporter (HIB 1B and HEK-293 cells) and 125 ng of CMV expression plasmid (HEK-293 cells only)/plate and lysed 36 h later. Regulators were prepared as 1,000 × concentrated stocks. Cells were treated for 10–12 h with the indicated compounds. Luciferase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's specifications (Promega). Duplicate plates were used in all experiments for both control and treated conditions. All experiments were repeated several times with consistent results. Unless specified otherwise, data shown represent the mean ± S.E. of the mean for three or four independent experiments. cDNA clones encoding the PPARγ and δ subtypes were isolated from a rat interscapular BAT cDNA library. Two rat PPARγ isoforms, γ1 and γ2, were obtained which, as has been reported for the mouse PPARγ isoforms, probably result from differential splicing of PPARγ RNA. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the rat PPARγ and γ2 subtypes are shown in Fig.1. Of the four positive clones isolated, only one encoded PPARγ1. The rat PPARγ1 cDNA clone contains an open reading frame that encodes a protein of 475 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 54.5 kDa (Fig. 1 A ). The PPARγ2 cDNA clone encodes a 57.6-kDa protein containing 30 additional amino acids at the amino terminus (Fig. 1 B ) compared with PPARγ1. A partial rat PPARδ cDNA clone was also isolated. This clone contained a sequence encoding amino acids 85–440 and approximately 2 kilobases of 3′-UTR. The 5′-end of the rat PPARδ cDNA was isolated by RACE, resulting in amplification and cloning of a 654-bp cDNA fragment that contains part of the 5′-UTR and the nucleotides encoding the amino-terminal 137 amino acids of the protein. The combined sequence information obtained from the RACE, PCR, and library screen products results in a PPARδ cDNA encoding a predicted protein of 440 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 49.7 kDa. The published PPARδ sequence (40Xing G. Zhang L. Zhang L. Heynen T. Yoshikawa T. Smith M. Weiss S. Detera-Wadleigh S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 1015-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) differs slightly from the sequence obtained here. In the sequence published previously, the nucleotide differences in the coding region which would encode different amino acids are: C305 (Thr instead of Met21), T436 (Ser instead of Pro65), and T1271 (Val instead of Asp343). The predicted rat PPAR sequences contain the expected DNA binding domain typical of nuclear receptors and a highly homologous ligand binding domain at the carboxyl terminus which may mediate activation of these receptors. Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of the rat PPAR subtypes to rat PPARα demonstrated a high conservation in the DNA binding domain and ligand binding domain relative to the highly divergent amino termini (not shown). In vitro transcription and translation of these PPAR cDNA clones resulted in proteins of the expected molecular masses (data not shown). The PPAR subtype mRNAs are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. As reported recently, the PPARγ subtype is expressed predominantly in adipose tissue where it is thought to play a crucial role in adipogenesis (14Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3133) Google Scholar). Because this process is pivotal to BAT function and the mammalian adaptation to cold, we hypothesized that the PPARα, γ, and δ subtypes may be expressed in BAT and that the mRNA levels could be affected during adipogenesis triggered by cold exposure. We have tested this hypothesis by analyzing expression of these PPAR subtypes in rat BAT as a function of time in the cold (4 °C). Two independent time course experiments were performed. In the first experiment rats were exposed to cold for up to 21 days, and in the second time course experiment rats were exposed to the cold for up to 28 days. RNA samples were analyzed from each animal by Northern analysis. Our results demonstrate that the PPAR subtype mRNAs are regulated differentially during cold exposure (Fig.2, A and B ). PPARα mRNA was decreased markedly after 5 h of cold exposure and was almost undetectable after 1 day in the cold. After about 10 days of cold exposure, PPARα mRNA increased gradually but remained lower than in the controls. PPARγ mRNA levels were also repressed profoundly within hours of cold exposure and remained decreased for 5–10 days in the cold (30–35% of control levels). After 10 days in the cold PPARγ levels increased to control levels after 28 days in the cold. In contrast, the PPARδ mRNA level increased progressively during acclimatization to cold. Fig.2 B shows PhosphorImager quantitation of Northern blots on RNA samples obtained at various time points of cold exposure, analyzed from three different rats at each time point. In another cold exposure experiment, RNA samples were analyzed from two rats at each time point with essentially the same results (as shown in Fig. 2 A ). C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and PPARs are expressed sequentially and seem to determine the adipocyte phenotype in concert (14Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3133) Google Scholar, 41Wu Z. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4128-4136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Wu Z.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 169-191Crossref Scopus (813) Google Scholar), therefore we also analyzed the expression of these mRNAs in BAT during cold exposure. RNA from two animals at each time point were analyzed, and the results demonstrated that the expression of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ mRNAs is rapidly and differentially regulated during the cold exposure of rats (Fig. 2 A ). PhosphorImager quantitation showed that the C/EBPα mRNA level was decreased transiently within 5 h of cold exposure, to less than 50% of the control levels, then returned to control level after 5–10 days and remained at about this level throughout the experiment (not shown). In contrast, the C/EBPβ mRNA level increased rapidly, almost 3-fold within 1 h of cold exposure, after which the expression returned to near control level at 24 h and remained slightly elevated for the remaining experimental period. Because the AOx gene is transcriptionally regulated by PPARα in the liver (2Tugwood J.D. Issemann I. Anderson R.G. Bundell K.R. McPheat W.L. Green S.

These complexes are thought to regulate the serum IGFs by restricting IGF movement out of the circulation. However, little is known about how ALS binds to IGFBP-3 or -5, which link the IGFs to ALS. To investigate potential sites of interaction, the ALS structure has been modeled with the crystal structure of the LRR protein porcine ribonuclease inhibitor as a template. ALS is predicted to be a donut-shaped molecule with an internal diameter of 1.7 nm, an external diameter of 7.2 nm, and a thickness of 3.6 nm. These dimensions are supported by rotary shadowing electron microscopy of ALS. The internal face is lined with a substantial region of electronegative surface potential that could interact with the positively charged region on IGFBP-3 known to be involved in ALS binding. The model also predicts that three potentialN -linked oligosaccharide sites within the LRR domain are clustered together, which may be important in light of recent studies showing ALS glycan involvement in complex formation with IGFBP-3.

It is thought that the size of these complexes prevents IGF access to target cells, while free IGFs and IGFs in binary complexes with the IGFBPs can easily cross the capillary endothelial barrier. Furthermore, the ALS-containing complex significantly increases the serum half-lives of both the IGFs and IGFBP-3 and in this way maintains a circulating store of these molecules (1Guler H.P. Zapf J.

ALS binding is the limiting step in complex formation, since the affinity of ALS for the IGF·IGFBP-3 complex is up to 2000-fold less than the affinity of IGFBP-3 for the IGFs in physiological salt concentrations, pH and temperature (3Holman S.R. Baxter R.C. Growth Regul. 1996; 6: 42-47PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Twigg and Baxter (4Twigg S.M. Baxter R.C. J. Biol.

Therefore, it is not yet clear how ALS interacts physically with IGFBP-3 to form the ternary complexes. However, one major structural feature of ALS is that around 75% of its residues are ordered into 18 tandem repeats of 24 amino acids plus two partial repeats, all of which contain the consensus motif for the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) superfamily of proteins.

Therefore, it is likely that this domain of ALS is involved in binding to IGFBP-3.The porcine ribonuclease inhibitor (RI) is the only LRR protein with a solved crystal structure (13Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1993; 366: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Overall, RI has an unusual, nonglobular horseshoe shape with the internal face exposed to solvent. Each repeat of RI contains a β-strand and an α-helix that alternate with each other when a number of repeats are linked. Consequently, the internal face of RI is lined with a parallel β-sheet lying perpendicular to the plane of the molecule and an external face that is mostly made up of α-helices and loops. The overall shape of RI is determined by the consensus leucines and other aliphatic residues, while the amino acids between these provide the specificity for interactions as demonstrated by the solved structure of RI bound to ribonuclease (14Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1995; 374: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar).Although RI has 28 and 29 residues per repeat, which is more than that for the typical LRR protein, other groups have successfully used RI as a template for homology modeling LRR proteins (15Jiang X.

Since serum ALS is difficult to purify above microgram quantities, we also used modeling and electron microscopy to identify regions of ALS that are potentially involved in ternary complex formation. Like many other LRR proteins, ALS has more repeats than RI; ALS has 18 perfect and 2 imperfect LRRs, while RI has only 15. Our model predicts that unlike the open horseshoe structure of RI, or indeed any LRR protein modeled so far, the 5 extra repeats in ALS have closed the structure so that it more closely resembles a donut. Furthermore, charged regions on ALS were identified which may be involved in IGFBP-3 and -5 binding.

IL-16 structure and function are highly conserved across species, suggesting similar conservation of a putative IL-16 binding site on CD4. Comparison of the human CD4 amino acid sequence with that of several different species revealed that immunoglobulin-like domain 4 is the most conserved extracellular region. Potential interaction of this domain with IL-16 was studied by testing murine D4 sequence-based oligopeptides for inhibition of IL-16 chemoattractant activity and inhibition of IL-16 binding to CD4 in vitro . Three contiguous 12-residue D4 region peptides (designated A, B, and C) blocked IL-16 chemoattractant activity, with peptide B the most potent. Peptides A and B were synergistic for inhibition, but peptide C was not. Peptides A and B also blocked IL-16 binding to CD4 in vitro , whereas peptide C did not. CD4, in addition to its known function as a receptor for major histocompatibility complex class II, contains a binding site for IL-16 in the D4 domain. The D4 residues required for IL-16 binding overlap those previously shown to participate in CD4-CD4 dimerization following class II major histocompatibility complex binding, providing a mechanistic explanation for the known function of IL-16 to inhibit the mixed lymphocyte reaction.

Subsequent studies showed that IL-16 is a multifunctional cytokine, selectively inducing the migration of CD4+ T cells, eosinophils, and monocytes. IL-16 also acts as a growth factor for resting CD4+ T cells, promoting their entry into the G1 phase of the cell cycle and inducing interleukin-2 receptor and major histocompatibility (MHC) class II protein expression on the cell surface. These activating functions are associated with intracellular signals including the synthesis of inositol trisphosphate and a transient increase of intracellular Ca2+concentration (reviewed in Ref. 3Cruikshank W.W. Kornfeld H. Center D.M. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 523-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Previous functional data suggest that CD4 is a receptor for IL-16. IL-16 induces chemotactic responses in CD4+ but not CD4− T lymphocytes (4Berman J.S. Cruikshank W.W. Center D.M. Theodore A.C. Beer D.J. Cell Immunol. 1985; 95: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The T cell chemoattractant response to IL-16 is inhibited by co-incubation with Fab fragments of the anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody OKT 4, and the magnitude of the IL-16-induced cell migration by monocytes is directly proportional to the amount of CD4 expressed on the responding cells (5Cruikshank W.W. Berman J.S. Theodore A.C. Bernardo J. Center D.M. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3817-3823PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, transfection of human CD4 confers IL-16 responsiveness to an otherwise unresponsive L3T4− murine hybridoma cell line as demonstrated by the induction of cell motility and rises in intracellular Ca2+ and inositol trisphosphate which are inhibited by OKT4 Fab (6Cruikshank W.W. Greenstein J.L. Theodore A.C. Center D.M. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2928-2934PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to this functional evidence, there is direct physical evidence for an IL-16-CD4 interaction. IL-16 can be co-immunoprecipitated with recombinant soluble CD4, and rIL-16 partially displaces OKT4 bound to CD4 (7Cruikshank W.W. Center D.M. Nisar N. Wu M. Natke B. Theodore A.C. Kornfeld H. Proc.

Data from several laboratories indicate a high degree of sequence and functional homology for IL-16 across different animal species (8Bannert N. Adler H.S. Werner A. Baier M. Kurth R.

These data suggest that the site(s) on CD4 interacting with IL-16 are also likely to be conserved. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences of CD4 across several species led us to hypothesize that the D4 domain is critical for IL-16 bioactivity. Murine spleens were harvested from healthy 8-week-old male BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratory). Splenocytes were isolated by grinding spleens between frosted slides in M199 culture medium (BioWhittaker), supplemented with 0.4% bovine serum albumin, 22 mm HEPES buffer, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (M199-HPS). Cells were washed and erythrocytes were lysed in Gey's solution. Splenocytes were washed twice in M199 and resuspended to a final concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. By flow cytometry, 25% of the isolated splenocytes within the lymphocyte cloud were CD4+. Recombinant murine IL-16 was produced in Escherichia coli (strain HMS 174, Novagen) as a polyhistidine fusion protein containing the 118 C-terminal residues encoded by the previously reported murine cDNA (9Keane J. Nicoll J. Kim S. Wu D.M. Cruikshank W.W. Brazer W. Natke B. Zhang Y. Center D.M. Kornfeld H. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5945-5954PubMed Google Scholar), using the bacterial expression vector pET16b (Novagen). The recombinant product corresponds to the secreted form of natural murine IL-16 following cleavage by caspase-3 (11Zhang Y. Center D.M. Wu D.M. Cruikshank W.W. Yuan J. Andrews D.W. Kornfeld H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1144-1149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The rIL-16 was purified by metal chelation chromatography, and the polyhistidine tag was cleaved with factor Xa (New England Biolabs). Synthetic oligopeptides based on murine CD4 D4 sequences were purchased from Research Genetics. Lyophilized oligopeptides were resuspended in double-distilled H2O at 2 mg/ml as stock solutions and subsequently diluted in M199-HPS for experiments. The following peptides corresponding to the indicated residues of murine CD4 were prepared: peptide A (aa 351–362), VSEEQKVVQVVA; peptide B (aa 365–376), TGLWQCLLSEGD; and peptide C (aa 374–385), EGDKVKMDSRIQ. A random scrambled peptide designated peptide D (LSKQKMVSREGT) synthesized for use as a negative control was designed to be neutral in charge, hydrophilic, and devoid of cysteine to avoid possible dimer formation. Four 6-amino acid peptides were synthesized based on the native murine CD4 D4 domain sequence as follows: VSEEQK (aa 327–338); VVQVVA (aa 333–338); WQCLLS (aa 344–349); and VAPETG (aa 337–342). Five 6-amino acid peptides were derived based on the above peptides but with selected non-conservative amino acid substitutions as follows: VKQVVA (aa 334, V:K); VVQKVA (aa 336, V:K); WACLLS (aa 345, Q:A); WQALLS (aa 346, C:A); WQCELS (aa 347, L:E). Cell migration was assessed by a modified Boyden chamber as described (1Center D.M. Cruikshank W.W. J. Immunol. 1982; 128: 2563-2568PubMed Google Scholar, 2Cruikshank W.W. Center D.M. J. Immunol. 1982; 128: 2569-2574PubMed Google Scholar). Murine splenocytes (5 × 106 cells/ml) in M199-HPS were loaded into the top wells of a microchemotaxis chamber, and 10−9m murine rIL-16 in M199-HPS (or M199-HPS alone) was added to the bottom wells. For blocking experiments, 10−9m murine rIL-16 with various concentrations of oligopeptides was mixed and placed in the lower well. The upper and lower wells were separated by an 8-μm pore size nitrocellulose filter membrane (Neuroprobe). Following incubation (3 h, 37 °C), the membranes were removed, stained with hematoxylin, and dehydrated. Cell migration was quantified by counting the number of cells migrating beyond a depth of 40 μm. Counts were compared with control cells exposed to M199-HPS alone, which was normalized to 100%. Cell migration is expressed as the mean percent control migration. All samples were tested in duplicate, with five high power fields counted in each duplicate. Results from multiple experiments were analyzed using Student's t test for paired variables and Tukey's test for multiple variables. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant. Induction of IL-2R (CD25) on rIL-16-stimulated murine splenocytes was detected by staining with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IL-2R Ab (PharMingen). Cells were fixed with 10% formalin and stored at 4 °C in the dark before analysis with a Becton Dickinson FACScan 440 flow cytometer. The percentage of IL-2R+ cells was determined by subtracting the percent isotype control positive from the total percent positive events. Radiolabeled murine IL-16 was prepared by in vitro translation and transcription (TNT T7, Promega) of a murine IL-16 cDNA construct in pET-16b expressing the C-terminal 118 amino acids of IL-16. Each coupled transcription-translation reaction was conducted in medium supplemented with [35S]methionine according to the manufacturer's instructions. A glutathione S -transferase (GST)-murine D3D4 fusion protein was produced by subcloning the murine D3D4 domain cDNA sequences encoding the CD4 protein open reading frame from Phe182 to Phe372 into pGEX-5X.1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The GST-D3D4 fusion protein was purified according to the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech GST fusion protein purification protocol using glutathione-conjugated Sepharose 4B beads in the presence of 2 mm dithiothreitol. Native GST was purified using the same method, for use as a control in the in vitro binding experiments. To investigate IL-16 interaction with the D3D4 of CD4, the GST-D3D4 fusion protein, or GST alone, was bound to the glutathione-conjugated Sepharose 4B beads. Five μl of the in vitro translation product containing 35S-labeled rIL-16 was added to 15 μl of the bead-bound proteins in 230 μl of PBS and 50 μl of NETN buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0). After incubating at 4 °C for 2 h, the beads were washed 3 times in NETN buffer. The GST-D3D4 or GST proteins were released from the beads by boiling in SDS gel loading buffer, and the supernatant was analyzed by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The presence of35S-labeled mrIL-16 was detected by autoradiography of the dried gel. Specificity was demonstrated by competition with an excess (10−5m) of unlabeled rIL-16, and the effects of the three 12-residue D3D4 domain peptides on rIL-16 binding was tested by adding each peptide (10−5m) to the binding reaction at time 0. In other preliminary experiments (data not shown), neutralizing anti-IL-16 antibody blocked rIL-16 binding to GST-D3D4, and an irrelevant recombinant protein (luciferase) failed to displace rIL-16 bound to GST-D3D4. The crystal structure of the D3 and D4 domains of rat CD4 (Brookhaven Protein Data Bank code 1cid.pdb) was chosen to model domain 4 of murine CD4 that contains the oligopeptide sequences VSEEQKVVQVVA, TGLWQCLLSEGD, and EGDKVKMDSRIQ. The program “O” (12Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W.

The program MOLMOL (13Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. Journal of Molecular Graphics. 1929; 14: 51-55Crossref Scopus (6498) Google Scholar) was used to create ribbon diagrams and solvent accessible surface maps. Analysis of predicted amino acid sequences derived from IL-16 cDNA clones of different species indicates a high degree of homology (8Bannert N. Adler H.S. Werner A. Baier M. Kurth R.

It is postulated that IL-16 exerts bioactivity through an interaction with CD4 (14Center D.M. Kornfeld H. Cruikshank W.W. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 476-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), and together with the structural and functional conservation of IL-16, we hypothesized that an IL-16-binding site on CD4 might also be conserved across species. The predicted amino acid sequences of the four extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains of CD4 from different species were compared by the method of Lipman and Pearson (15Lipman D.J. Pearson W.R. Science. 1985; 227: 1435-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (2554) Google Scholar), using Lasergene software (DNASTAR). Each of these four domains (designated D1 through D4) of cat (16Norimine J. Miyazawa T.

Cell. 1985; 42: 93-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) CD4 sequence (Fig.1). In each case, the D4 domains were found to have a higher similarity index than the other three domains. Based on the CD4 sequence comparison, we hypothesized that IL-16 interacts with residues in the D4 domain. To test this hypothesis, synthetic oligopeptides based on murine D4 domain sequences with the highest homology to human CD4 (Fig. 2) were tested for their ability to block murine rIL-16-stimulated murine splenocyte migration. Initial experiments identified three 12-residue D4-based oligopeptides designated A, B, and C that had IL-16 inhibitory activity. Peptide B (aa 341–352) includes the sequence WQCLLS (residues 344–349) which is 100% conserved in all the species examined. Peptide A (aa 327–338) and peptide C (aa 351–362) correspond to the N-terminal and C-terminal flanks of peptide B, respectively. A random scrambled 12-residue peptide (LSKQKMVSREGT) designated peptide D was used as a negative control for nonspecific effects of peptide administration on splenocyte motility. Criteria for the design of peptide D included overall hydrophilicity, neutral charge, and no cysteine residues (to prevent possible dimer formation). The effect of co-treatment with the 12-residue peptides on rIL-16-stimulated splenocyte migration is shown in Fig.3. In the absence of added peptides, rIL-16 (10−9m) activated murine splenocytes to migrate ∼200% over background in all the experiments. Peptide B at 10−7m significantly inhibited IL-16. Peptides A and C were not inhibitory at 10−7m, but both demonstrated significant inhibitory activity at 10−6m. In contrast, peptide D failed to inhibit IL-16-stimulated splenocyte migration. None of these peptides (at 10−9 to 10−5m) inhibited murine splenocyte migration in response to an optimal concentration of the murine chemokine JE (10−9m; data not shown). These results indicate that certain D4 domain peptides specifically inhibit IL-16-stimulated splenocyte motility. To demonstrate that peptide inhibition is not limited to the chemoattractant activity of IL-16, the D4 sequence peptides were tested for their capacity to inhibit IL-16-stimulated induction of IL-2R on resting murine splenocytes. As shown in Table I, rIL-16 increased basal IL-2R expression by 50%, and this was completely inhibited by peptide B at 10−6 and 10−7m. Peptides A and C were inhibitory at 10−7m but not 10−6m. The negative control peptide D (10−6m) had no effect on rIL-16-stimulated IL-2R expression. The D4 region peptides are equally potent inhibitors of two distinct IL-16 bioactivities, the induction of motility and the up-regulation of IL-2R.Table ICD4 peptides inhibit IL-2R induction by rIL-16ConditionIL-2R+ cells%No stimulation24rIL-16 10−9m36IL-16 + peptide A 10−6m21IL-16 + peptide A 10−7m37IL-16 + peptide B 10−6m22IL-16 + peptide B 10−7m26IL-16 + peptide C 10−6m20IL-16 + peptide C 10−7m35IL-16 + peptide D 10−6m37Murine splenocytes were incubated in control buffer, rIL-16 alone, or rIL-16 plus the indicated peptide.

Isotype control antibody binding ranged from 1 to 4%. Open table in a new tab Murine splenocytes were incubated in control buffer, rIL-16 alone, or rIL-16 plus the indicated peptide. IL-2R expression was determined by flow cytometry using FITC-conjugated anti-IL-2R antibody. The percent IL-2R+ was determined by subtracting the FITC-conjugated isotype control antibody binding from the FITC-conjugated anti-IL-2R antibody binding. Isotype control antibody binding ranged from 1 to 4%. Because peptide B was active at 10-fold lower concentration than peptides A or C, we next sought to define residues within peptide B critical for IL-16 inhibition. Within peptide B, the six residues WQCLLS are highly conserved between species. A synthetic WQCLLS oligopeptide inhibited IL-16 at 10−7m(Fig. 4), comparable to the activity of the 12-residue peptide B. Preliminary experiments with truncated peptides indicated that the Trp344 and Ser349residues are dispensable with respect to IL-16 inhibition (data not shown). The substituted peptide WQALLS was equally as effective as the native WQCLLS, suggesting that Cys346 is also dispensable. In contrast, the substituted peptides WACLLS and WQCELS failed to block IL-16, suggesting that the D4 domain residues Gln345 and Leu347 might be involved in IL-16 binding or activation via CD4. The peptide VAPETG which bridges sequences between peptide A and peptide B lacked inhibitory activity, indicating that the two C-terminal residues of peptide A, the two intervening residues between peptides A and B, and the two N-terminal residues of peptide B are dispensable. Since peptides A and C inhibit rIL-16-induced splenocyte migration at 10−6m, it is possible that the corresponding regions in the D4 domain of CD4 are involved in cell activation by IL-16. We hypothesized that a combination of IL-16-inhibiting peptides would be synergistic if they simultaneously blocked IL-16 binding at distinct touch points on CD4, or if contact with discrete binding and activating domains was blocked. This was investigated using combinations of peptides A, B, and C at sub-optimal inhibitory concentrations. As shown in Fig. 3, none of the three peptides alone at 10−8m inhibited IL-16 activity. However, the combination of peptide A and peptide B at a final concentration 10−8m significantly inhibited chemotaxis (Fig. 5). The combination of peptide A plus peptide C, or peptide B plus peptide C, did not inhibit IL-16 at this concentration. These data suggest that sequences within both peptide A and peptide B may be important for IL-16 activation via CD4 but do not indicate whether this involves contiguous sequences or discrete domains within the combined 24 residues covered by the peptides. The failure of VAPETG to block IL-16 favors a model with discrete touch points. To identify the residues that are responsible for the synergistic effect of peptide A, two 6-residue peptides were prepared as follows: VSEEQK and VVQVVA represent the N-terminal half and the C-terminal half of peptide A, respectively. The C-terminal half-sequence VVQVVA inhibited rIL16-induced splenocyte migration at 10−6mcomparably to peptide A, whereas the N-terminal VSEEQK demonstrated no inhibitory activity (Fig. 6). Furthermore, VVQVVA at 10−8m had synergistic activity with peptide B, whereas no synergy was observed when peptide B was combined with VSEEQK (data not shown). To identify residues in VVQVVA required for IL-16 inhibition, and for synergy with peptide B, non-conservative substitutions were tested. Sequence comparison across species shows that Val334 and Val336 are conserved in all cases studied except that for rat whose sequence is VIQVQA. The substituted oligopeptides VKQVVA and VVQKVA were compared with the native sequence peptide VVQVVA for inhibition of IL-16-stimulated splenocyte motility. Each peptide was separately combined at various concentrations (0.5 × 10−6m to 0.5 × 10−9m) with a sub-optimal concentration of peptide B (fixed at a constant 0.5 × 10−8m). As shown in Fig. 7, the substituted peptide VVQVKA plus peptide B did not block IL-16 at any concentration, whereas the substituted peptide VKQVVA in combination with peptide B reduced IL-16-stimulated splenocyte migration at 10−6 and 10−7m. However, the inhibitory activity of VKQVVA was weaker than the native sequence VVQVVA which (in combination with peptide B) significantly inhibited motility of stimulated splenocytes at 10−8m. These data suggest that the D4 region residues Val334 and Val336 may be important for IL-16 stimulation via CD4. The ability of D4 oligopeptides sequences to block the chemoattractant activity of IL-16 is postulated to be mediated by structural mimicry of binding sites for IL-16 on its receptor. To test this hypothesis, and to corroborate previously published evidence that IL-16 interacts directly with CD4, an in vitro binding system was developed. A recombinant chimeric protein consisting of GST fused to the N terminus of the murine CD4 D3D4 region was expressed in E. coli as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Radiolabeled murine rIL-16 produced by in vitro transcription and translation in the presence of [35S]methionine was incubated with GST-D3D4 bound to glutathione-conjugated Sepharose 4B beads. Native GST was also tested for each condition to control for nonspecific binding. Following incubation of 35S-labeled rIL-16 with GST-D3D4 or GST-coated beads, complexes were washed three times and then boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer prior to electrophoresis and autoradiography. Although some background binding of rIL-16 to native GST was observed, binding to GST-D3D4 was much more intense and was specifically competed by an excess of unlabeled rIL-16 (Fig.8). Nonspecific binding of35S-labeled rIL-16 to GST alone was not competed with cold rIL-16, and specific binding of rIL-16 to GST-D3D4 was not competed with an excess of irrelevant protein (recombinant luciferase; data not shown). IL-16 binding in this system was reduced to background in the presence of either peptide A or peptide B alone and with peptide A and B combined. In contrast, peptide C failed to reduce IL-16 binding. These data indicate that peptide A and peptide B function as competitive receptor antagonists for IL-16. The ability of peptide C to inhibit IL-16-stimulated splenocyte motility at 10−6m appears to be mediated by a different mechanism. The locations of the three 12-residue oligopeptide sequences, and of those amino acids critical for IL-16 inhibition, were evaluated in the context of the three-dimensional structure of rat CD4 and previous studies demonstrating CD4-CD4 dimer formation (reviewed in Ref. 22Song L. Satoh T. Korngold R. Huang Z. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 455-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The sequence homology between rat and mouse CD4 domains 3 and 4 is 87%, and it is expected that the tertiary structure of murine CD4 is similar to the rat. Furthermore, the sequences of the 12-residue murine peptides used in our experiments are conserved in relationship to the corresponding sequences of rat CD4, with the exception of Val337 which is Gln in rat. This residue is located in a β-strand and is solvent-exposed in the rat structure, suggesting that this amino acid difference would not affect the core packing of domain 4, thus preserving the tertiary structure. Fig. 9A is ribbon diagram of domains 3 and 4 of rat CD4. β-Sheets are depicted as flat ribbons on domain 4 only. The sequence corresponding to peptide A (colored blue in the figure) is located in strands C′, E, and the EF loop. Peptide B (colored red ) spans the C-terminal half of the EF loop, all of the F strand, and a portion of the FG loop. Peptide C (coloredgreen ) corresponds to the FG loop and G strand. The residues lying between peptide A and B are colored gold , and those shared by peptides B and C are colored orange . The two faces of the β-sandwich form an apex at the EF loop. Residues in peptides A and B that are proximal to the EF loop might constitute a binding site, as can be seen in Fig. 9 A . The modeling results indicate that peptide A does not lie within the predicted dimerization region of domain 4 (23Wu H. Kwong P.D. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Portions of peptide B lie within the dimer interface, particularly Gln345 (corresponding to Gln346 in human CD4) that is in the center of the interface zone. Peptide C also partially overlaps the suggested dimerization region of D4. A solvent-accessible surface map was generated (Fig. 9 B ), again displaying the residues corresponding to peptides A inblue , peptide B in red , and peptide C ingreen . Our functional studies indicated that Gln345 and Leu347 of peptide B and Val334 and Val336 of peptide A are required for inhibition of IL-16. The structural modeling indicates that all of these residues are solvent-accessible and therefore might contribute to binding interactions with IL-16. Fig. 9 C shows the solvent-accessible residues Gln345 and Leu347in red and orange , respectively, forming part of a potential binding site. CD4 is a co-receptor with the T cell receptor complex (reviewed in Ref. 24Julius M. Maroun C.R. Haughn L. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 177-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It facilitates the association between T cells and antigen-presenting cells by interaction with the non-polymorphic region of MHC class II and contributes to signal transduction through its cytoplasmic association with the lymphocyte tyrosine kinase p56lck. CD4 is also the major receptor for human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), HIV-2, and human herpesvirus-7 (25Dalgleish A.G. Beverley P.C.L. Clapham P.R. Crawfor D.H. Greaves M.F. Weiss R.A.

Originally identified as a differentiation antigen on T lymphocytes, CD4 was later found to be expressed on a variety cell types including monocytes, macrophages, eosinophils, hematopoietic progenitor cells, neurons, and spermatozoa (28Foti M.

It has been described as a major event in morphogenesis and in pathological situations such as invasion and metastasis of tumor cells (1Thiery J.P. Cell Differ. 1984; 15: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 2Strauli P. Weiss L. Eur. J. Cancer. 1977; 13: 1-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Most cell motility factors are also growth factors (GFs),1 a most intriguing duality of function that implies the possibility of common or related signaling transduction pathways (3Stocker M. Gherardi E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 81-102PubMed Google Scholar). Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), also known as scatter factor (SF), is a pleiotropic GF that, besides promoting cell survival and proliferation, has the ability to dissociate epithelial sheets and to stimulate cell motility (3Stocker M. Gherardi E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 81-102PubMed Google Scholar). HGF/SF predominantly acts as a paracrine factor. Nearly 90% of human malignant tumors arise from epithelial tissue, and most carcinoma cells express the c-Met/HGF receptor and are likely to use HGF/SF produced from stromal tissue (4Matsumoto K. Horikoshi M. Rikimaru K. Enomoto S. J. Oral Pathol. Med. 1989; 18: 498-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 5Tajima H. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 202: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). On the other hand, GFs such as the epidermal growth factor (EGF) can enhance motility in an autocrine manner in several tumor cell lines (6Liotta L.A. Mandler R. Murano G. Katz D.A. Gordon R.K. Hing P.K. Shiffmann E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3302-3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The EGF receptor (EGFR) has also been extensively studied. GF activation of EGFR influences a number of phenotypic properties in malignant cells in vitro , including mitogenesis and cell motility stimulation (7Lung-Johansen M. Bjerkvig R. Humphrey A.P. Bigner H.S. Bigner D.D. Laerum O. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6039-6044PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of EGFR is correlated more strongly with metastasis and invasion than with tumor size (7Lung-Johansen M. Bjerkvig R. Humphrey A.P. Bigner H.S. Bigner D.D. Laerum O. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6039-6044PubMed Google Scholar).Growth/motility factors such as EGF and HGF/SF, initiate a response by binding to receptors and thereby activating a tyrosine kinase domain located in the cytoplasmic portion of the receptor (8Cross M. Dexter T.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). This event leads to the autophosphorylation of the receptors on tyrosine residues. The presence of phosphotyrosine at specific sites on receptors is crucial for downstream signaling: within a specific sequence context, phosphotyrosines act as binding sites for many signal-transducing molecules within the cells (9Cantley L.C. Songyang Z. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 18: 121-126Crossref Google Scholar, 10Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The common element that confers the specific property of phosphotyrosine-containing sequence recognition to all these target molecules is the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain (11Pawson T. Schlessinger J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 434-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar).Grb2 is an adaptor protein made of one SH2 domain flanked by two SH3 domains. Grb2 interacts via its SH2 domain with activated receptors and via its SH3 domains to the nucleotide exchange factor Sos, which thus becomes activated as a positive regulator of Ras (12Schlessinger J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Design of molecules that block the interaction between the phosphotyrosine-containing activated receptors and the SH2 domain of Grb2 should interrupt the Ras signaling pathway and may promise therapeutic leads for diseases like cancer, in which the Ras signaling pathway plays a major role (13Sastry L. Cao T. King R. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 70: 208-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Grb2 may have other functions as well. Micro-injection studies with anti-Grb2 antibodies in rat kidney cells suggest that Grb2 may play a role in signaling from receptor tyrosine kinases to the small GTPase Rac, a protein involved in motility-related events (14Matuoka K. Shibasaki F. Shibata M. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3467-3473Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).We have reported the rational drug design of CGP78850, a potent and selective inhibitor of Grb2 SH2 domain (15Furet P. Gay B. Caravatti G. Garcia-Echeverria C. Rahuel J. Schoepfer J. Fretz H. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 3442-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We have already demonstrated that CGP78850 inhibits Grb2 SH2 domain binding and Ras activation in live cells and prevents anchorage independence of growth (16Gay B. Suarez S. Caravatti G. Furet P. Meyer T. Schoepfer J. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). CGP85793 is a prodrug derivative of CGP78850 with improved cell penetration (16Gay B. Suarez S. Caravatti G. Furet P. Meyer T. Schoepfer J. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar).In this study, using both compounds, we explored the possibility that Grb2 may also play a role in cell motility. Significantly, we demonstrate that inhibition of Grb2 SH2 domain prevents HGF/SF-induced A431 and MDCK cell motility and cytoskeletal rearrangements essential for this process. We also establish that EGF can no longer activate Rac in A431 cells.DISCUSSIONA parameter often associated with epithelial invasiveness is motility. Cell motility requires several distinct steps that must occur in a coordinated fashion for cellular translocation to occur. Following the establishment of adhesion to the underlying substratum, the cell must be able to form protrusions, establishing new adhesions, and be able to break older adhesions for translocation to occur (3Stocker M. Gherardi E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 81-102PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that so many GFs can, at least in some cells, stimulate movement as well as growth suggests that there may be some link in the early stage of signal transduction. Grb2 is a SH2/SH3 domain-containing adaptor protein that links receptor tyrosine kinases to the Ras signaling pathway and mitogenesis (18Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J. Batzer A.G. Li W. Margolis B. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Skolnik E.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1992; 70: 431-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). Earlier studies have shown that the injection of an antibody against Grb2 into normal rat kidney-derived fibroblasts had an effect on the cytoskeletal rearrangements induced by EGF and platelet-derived growth factor (14Matuoka K.

Because regulated changes in actin microfilament organization underlie cell motility, we have also monitored early changes in the cytoskeleton of A431 cells. Membrane ruffles and lamellipodia are found at the leading edges of motile cells and are believed to play a fundamental role in migration (28Bussolino F. Di Renzo M.F. Ziche M. Bochietto E. Olivero M. Naldini L. Gaudino G. Tamagnone L. Coffer A. Comoglio P.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 629-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar, 29Small J.V. Electron Microsc. Rev. 1988; 1: 155-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Membrane ruffling formation is due to extensive actin polymerization. In this respect it is of interest to mention that EGF has been demonstrated as causing actin polymerization (30Rijken P.J. Hage W.J. Van Bergen en Henegowen P.M.P. Verkeij A.J. Boonstra J. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 491-499PubMed Google Scholar). The strong colocalization of Grb2 to membrane ruffles and the observation that Grb2 SH2 inhibitors prevented membrane ruffle formation support a role for Grb2 in cell motility and provide evidence that Grb2 is essential for tyrosine kinase signaling to the cytoskeleton.The GTPase that appears most likely to control cell surface protrusive activity associated with translational locomotion is Rac (21Ridley A.J. Comoglio P.M. Hall A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1110-1122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of constitutively active Rac promotes the formation of ruffling lamellae in fibroblasts (26Nobes C. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3700) Google Scholar). In quiescent A431 cells, we observed Rac in the cytosol, correlating with the inactive state and its translocation to the cell periphery to regions of ruffling activity upon stimulation. CGP85793 completely blocked this translocation, indicating that Rac translocation is dependent on Grb2 binding to phosphoproteins. However, the different localization of Grb2 (mostly membranous) and Rac (cytosolic) before stimulation suggests that Grb2 effect on Rac translocation is indirect and may occur through Ras. Moreover, our demonstration that Rac and Grb2 are recruited and colocalize upon stimulation to the sites of ruffling activity suggests that Grb2 may be involved in the two aspects of GF regulation of Rac activity, i.e. not only in the recruitment of Rac from the cytosol to the membrane but also, as for Ras, in its guanine nucleotide exchange activity, possibly, as recently proposed, directly through Sos Dbl homology domain (31Anjaruwee S.N. Bogdan A.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar).We establish for the first time that Grb2 is involved directly in the regulation of cell motility. The present study also demonstrates that, at least in A431 cells, Grb2 plays a role in cell motility-related phenomena, including Rac regulation and cytoskeletal rearrangements downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases. Our Grb2 SH2 inhibitors are now prototypes for a new class of therapeutic agents that may control the ability of tumor cells to move and traverse interstitial barriers. Acquisition of cell motility is a prerequisite to biological processes taking place in tissue remodeling. It has been described as a major event in morphogenesis and in pathological situations such as invasion and metastasis of tumor cells (1Thiery J.P. Cell Differ. 1984; 15: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 2Strauli P. Weiss L. Eur. J. Cancer. 1977; 13: 1-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Most cell motility factors are also growth factors (GFs),1 a most intriguing duality of function that implies the possibility of common or related signaling transduction pathways (3Stocker M. Gherardi E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 81-102PubMed Google Scholar). Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), also known as scatter factor (SF), is a pleiotropic GF that, besides promoting cell survival and proliferation, has the ability to dissociate epithelial sheets and to stimulate cell motility (3Stocker M. Gherardi E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 81-102PubMed Google Scholar). HGF/SF predominantly acts as a paracrine factor. Nearly 90% of human malignant tumors arise from epithelial tissue, and most carcinoma cells express the c-Met/HGF receptor and are likely to use HGF/SF produced from stromal tissue (4Matsumoto K. Horikoshi M. Rikimaru K. Enomoto S. J. Oral Pathol. Med. 1989; 18: 498-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 5Tajima H. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 202: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). On the other hand, GFs such as the epidermal growth factor (EGF) can enhance motility in an autocrine manner in several tumor cell lines (6Liotta L.A. Mandler R. Murano G. Katz D.A. Gordon R.K. Hing P.K. Shiffmann E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3302-3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The EGF receptor (EGFR) has also been extensively studied. GF activation of EGFR influences a number of phenotypic properties in malignant cells in vitro , including mitogenesis and cell motility stimulation (7Lung-Johansen M. Bjerkvig R. Humphrey A.P. Bigner H.S. Bigner D.D. Laerum O. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6039-6044PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of EGFR is correlated more strongly with metastasis and invasion than with tumor size (7Lung-Johansen M. Bjerkvig R. Humphrey A.P. Bigner H.S. Bigner D.D. Laerum O. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6039-6044PubMed Google Scholar). Growth/motility factors such as EGF and HGF/SF, initiate a response by binding to receptors and thereby activating a tyrosine kinase domain located in the cytoplasmic portion of the receptor (8Cross M. Dexter T.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). This event leads to the autophosphorylation of the receptors on tyrosine residues. The presence of phosphotyrosine at specific sites on receptors is crucial for downstream signaling: within a specific sequence context, phosphotyrosines act as binding sites for many signal-transducing molecules within the cells (9Cantley L.C. Songyang Z. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 18: 121-126Crossref Google Scholar, 10Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The common element that confers the specific property of phosphotyrosine-containing sequence recognition to all these target molecules is the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain (11Pawson T. Schlessinger J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 434-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Grb2 is an adaptor protein made of one SH2 domain flanked by two SH3 domains. Grb2 interacts via its SH2 domain with activated receptors and via its SH3 domains to the nucleotide exchange factor Sos, which thus becomes activated as a positive regulator of Ras (12Schlessinger J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Design of molecules that block the interaction between the phosphotyrosine-containing activated receptors and the SH2 domain of Grb2 should interrupt the Ras signaling pathway and may promise therapeutic leads for diseases like cancer, in which the Ras signaling pathway plays a major role (13Sastry L. Cao T. King R. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 70: 208-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Grb2 may have other functions as well. Micro-injection studies with anti-Grb2 antibodies in rat kidney cells suggest that Grb2 may play a role in signaling from receptor tyrosine kinases to the small GTPase Rac, a protein involved in motility-related events (14Matuoka K. Shibasaki F. Shibata M. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3467-3473Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We have reported the rational drug design of CGP78850, a potent and selective inhibitor of Grb2 SH2 domain (15Furet P. Gay B. Caravatti G. Garcia-Echeverria C. Rahuel J. Schoepfer J. Fretz H. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 3442-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We have already demonstrated that CGP78850 inhibits Grb2 SH2 domain binding and Ras activation in live cells and prevents anchorage independence of growth (16Gay B. Suarez S. Caravatti G. Furet P. Meyer T. Schoepfer J. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). CGP85793 is a prodrug derivative of CGP78850 with improved cell penetration (16Gay B. Suarez S. Caravatti G. Furet P. Meyer T. Schoepfer J. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, using both compounds, we explored the possibility that Grb2 may also play a role in cell motility. Significantly, we demonstrate that inhibition of Grb2 SH2 domain prevents HGF/SF-induced A431 and MDCK cell motility and cytoskeletal rearrangements essential for this process. We also establish that EGF can no longer activate Rac in A431 cells. DISCUSSIONA parameter often associated with epithelial invasiveness is motility. Cell motility requires several distinct steps that must occur in a coordinated fashion for cellular translocation to occur. Following the establishment of adhesion to the underlying substratum, the cell must be able to form protrusions, establishing new adhesions, and be able to break older adhesions for translocation to occur (3Stocker M. Gherardi E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 81-102PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that so many GFs can, at least in some cells, stimulate movement as well as growth suggests that there may be some link in the early stage of signal transduction. Grb2 is a SH2/SH3 domain-containing adaptor protein that links receptor tyrosine kinases to the Ras signaling pathway and mitogenesis (18Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J. Batzer A.G. Li W. Margolis B. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Skolnik E.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1992; 70: 431-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). Earlier studies have shown that the injection of an antibody against Grb2 into normal rat kidney-derived fibroblasts had an effect on the cytoskeletal rearrangements induced by EGF and platelet-derived growth factor (14Matuoka K. Shibasaki F. Shibata M. Takenawa T.

https://openalex.org/W2065952937,"Thromboxane A2(TxA2) is a potent vasoconstrictor and platelet agonist. Pharmacological studies have defined two classes of thromboxane receptors (TPs) in human platelets; sites that bind the agonist 1S -(1,2(5Z ),3-(1E ,3S ),4)-7- 3-(3-hydroxy-4-(4′-iodophenoxy)-1-butenyl)-7-oxabicyclo-2.2.1-heptan-2-yl-5-heptenoic acid (I-BOP) with high affinity support platelet shape change, whereas low affinity sites that bind irreversibly the antagonist GR 32191 transduce platelet aggregation. As the mechanisms of signal transduction involved in platelet aggregation begin to be elucidated, few results concern those involved in platelet shape change, which is independent of the engagement of GPIIb/IIIa. To elucidate the respective role of the two classes of pharmacological binding sites of TPs in shape change, platelets were incubated with I-BOP at low concentrations or stimulated by I-BOP at high concentrations after pretreatment with GR 32191 or activated with low concentrations of 8-epi -prostaglandin F2α. Under these three conditions, there is a rapid stimulation of protein tyrosine phosphorylation of the 80/85-kDa doublet identified as the cytoskeletal protein cortactin. Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is kinetically correlated with the occurrence of shape change. These biochemical and morphological events are both inhibited by SQ 29548, a TP antagonist, indicating the specificity of the signal.Since tyrosine kinase Syk was activated early during platelet activation, we examined the possibility that cortactin is a potential substrate of Syk in TxA2-induced platelet shape change. p72 Syk phosphorylation and kinase activity took place during the period when platelets were changing shape upon low concentrations of I-BOP stimulation. Furthermore, cortactin was associated with Syk, and this association increases along with the level of phosphorylation. These data suggest a novel pathway for a G protein-coupled TxA2high affinity receptor to the protein-tyrosine kinase Syk, which is associated with cortactin in the very early steps of platelet activation.

Allan C.J. Davis-Bruno K. J. Lipid Mediators. 1995; 12: 361-378Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It also stimulates mitogenesis and hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells (2Ali S. Davis M.G. Becker M.W. Dorn G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17397-17403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hanasaki K. Nakano T. Arita H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 40: 2535-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Its mimetics induce apoptosis of immature thymocytes and may regulate thymocyte differentiation and development (4Ushikubi F. Aiba Y. Nakumura K. Namba T. Hirata M. Mazda O. Katsura Y. Naruyima S. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1825-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These actions are attributed to TxA2 interacting with its specific receptors, which belong to the heptahelical superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors. Platelet TxA2 receptors (TPs) have been reported to couple to Gαq Gα12and Gα13 and Gαι2 (5Baldassare J.J. Tarver A.P. Henderson P.A. Mackin W.M. Sahagan B. Fisher G.J. Biochem.

Laugwitz K.L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 504-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Because of the chemical instability of TxA2, a number of stable agonists have been synthesized, such as U 46619 and I-BOP. Evidence suggests that two different TPs within the platelets or two different affinity states of the same receptor may exist. Analysis of the binding of 125I-labeled I-BOP by platelet membranes indicates two platelet binding sites of high affinity (K d = 270 ± 60 pm) and low affinity (K d = 3.9 ± 1–2 nm) (8Dorn G.W. De Jesus A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: H327-H334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The K d values correspond to the EC50values for I-BOP to induce shape change and aggregation. Thus, the binding of I-BOP to low affinity receptors induces secretion and aggregation, whereas its binding to high affinity receptors induces shape change (8Dorn G.W. De Jesus A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: H327-H334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, a TP antagonist such as GR 32191 shows noncompetitive inhibition of platelet aggregation but competitive inhibition of platelet shape change, consistent with the existence of two subtypes of receptors (9Takahara K. Murray R. FitzGerald G.A. Fitzgerald D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6836-6844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One possible explanation for the pharmacological evidence for distinct platelet thromboxane binding sites is that the affinity of a single receptor type can be modulated by the type of G proteins that the receptors are coupled to. Allanet al. (10Allan C.J. Higashiura K. Martin M. Morinelli T.A. Kurtz D.T. Geoffroy O. Meier G.P. Gettys T.W. Halushka P.V. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 277: 1132-1139PubMed Google Scholar) provide evidence that the affinity state of the TP can be altered by Gα13 and Gαq when cotransfected with Gα13 and Gαq into COS-7 cells. Stimulation of TPs leading to platelet aggregation involves (i) an activation of phospholipase Cβ and subsequent generation of inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol (5Baldassare J.J. Tarver A.P. Henderson P.A. Mackin W.M. Sahagan B. Fisher G.J. Biochem.

Grelac F. Caen J.P. Maclouf J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 73: 857-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). As the mechanisms of signal transduction involved in platelet aggregation begin to be elucidated, few results concern those involved in platelet shape change (12Negrescu E.V. de Quintana K.L. Siess W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1057-1061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that cortactin was the only tyrosine-phosphorylated substrate that occurred in thrombin-induced Glanzmann thrombasthenic platelets, that is to say in the absence of integrin engagement and aggregation (13Rosa J.P.

To enhance understanding of the signal transduction that occurs in the absence of integrin engagement and that leads to morphological changes, we used thromboxane analogues that only induce the first steps of platelet activation. To elucidate the respective roles of the two classes of pharmacological binding sites of TP in thromboxane-mediated platelet shape change, platelets were (i) incubated with I-BOP at low concentrations; (ii) stimulated by I-BOP at high concentrations after pretreatment with GR 32191, a TP antagonist that dissociates very slowly, if at all, from the low affinity binding sites (9Takahara K. Murray R. FitzGerald G.A. Fitzgerald D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6836-6844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); or (iii) activated with low concentrations of 8-epi -PGF2α. This isoprostane is synthesized mostly independently of the activity of cyclooxygenase (in vivo ) through the free radical-catalyzed peroxidation of arachidonic acid and may be active as a partial platelet activator at high concentrations (14Morrow J.D. Minton T.A. Roberts L.J. Prostaglandins. 1992; 44: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 15Pratico D. Smyth E.M. Violi F. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol.

Therefore, by using appropriate concentrations of thromboxane analogues that only induce shape change, we found that a 80/85-kDa protein, cortactin, a substrate involved in the cytoskeletal reorganization, is tyrosine-phosphorylated in platelets, and cortactin associates with the tyrosine kinase Syk. We demonstrated that both Syk kinase activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin are kinetically correlated with platelet shape change, which is the earliest platelet response.

(Costa Mesa, CA). Tyrphostin A23 and tyrphostin A1 were from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Human blood was taken from healthy volunteers after informed consent in accordance with the French Etablissement de Transfusion Sanguine. Blood was obtained by venipuncture on ACD-C (130 mm citric acid, 124 mm Na3 citrate, 110 mm glucose; 1 volume for 9 volumes of blood) in the presence of 1 mmacetylsalicylic acid to prevent TxA2 endogenous synthesis. Platelet-rich plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 120 ×g for 15 min at room temperature. For some experiments, part of the platelet-rich plasma was incubated with 1 μm GR 32191, a TP antagonist, for 30 min at room temperature to block the TP low affinity binding sites, with the other part serving as control. Platelets were isolated by centrifugation at 1,200 × g for 15 min, resuspended in washing buffer, pH 6 (140 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 12 mm Na3 citrate, 10 mm glucose, 12.5 mm sucrose) in the presence of 0.1 μm prostaglandin E1 and recentrifuged for 15 min at 1,200 × g before resuspension in Hanks' buffer, pH 7.4 (0.44 mm KH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.34 mm Na2HPO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 1.8 mm CaCl2). Platelets (0.4 ml, 3 × 108 platelets/ml) were preincubated without stirring for 1 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of SQ 29548 (10 μm), an antagonist of TP. Platelet activation was initiated in an aggregometer cuvette with constant stirring, by the addition of (i) a low concentration of I-BOP (1 nm), (ii) 8-epi -PGF2α (5 μm), or (iii) a high concentration of I-BOP (10 nm) to platelets pretreated with 1 μm GR 32191, as described in the previous section. These three different stimulations only induce shape change. In some experiments, platelets were preincubated for 2 min with 100 μm cytochalasin D, 1 mm tyrphostin A23 or A1, or an equivalent volume of Me2SO. The addition of a high concentration of I-BOP to platelets not treated with GR 32191 at the platelet-rich plasma level led to aggregation, which was monitored by light transmission in a Chronolog aggregometer and expressed as the percentage change in light transmission with the blank sample (buffer without platelets) defined as 100%. Shape change, which takes place within the first 30 s after the I-BOP addition as a decrease in light transmission, was measured as a major deflection and expressed in millimeters. The electrical sensitivity of the recorder was increased to quantify the shape change better. Stimulation was stopped each time with 100 μl of lysis solution (2% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaF, 0.5 mm Pefabloc), and samples were stored at −20 °C. Platelet lysates were heated for 30 min at 60 °C in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol (5% w/v). Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 7% polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using a semidry transfer system (Hoeffer; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.). Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating membranes with TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% (w/v) low fat powder milk before the incubation with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (1:5000) for 60 min at room temperature. After washing with TBS, bound primary antibodies were detected after incubation with sheep anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG for 60 min. Membranes were further washed in TBS and treated with ECL reagents. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions. Tyrosine-phosphorylated protein bands were measured by laser densitometry (Ultroscan XL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Phosphorylation intensity was expressed in arbitrary units in -fold over basal level at time 0. Platelet suspensions (0.4 ml, 6 × 108 platelets/ml), obtained as described above, were lysed in an equal volume of ice-cold modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm Pefabloc, 50 mm NaF). Insoluble cell fractions were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Cortactin (p80/85) was immunoprecipitated using 5 μg of mouse anti-cortactin mAb and 5 μg of rabbit anti-mouse IgG pAb. After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, protein A-Sepharose was added for 3 h at 4 °C. Syk kinase was immunoprecipitated using 3 μg of rabbit anti-Syk kinase pAb under similar conditions. After three washings in modified radioimmune precipitation buffer, immunoprecipitates were recovered in Laemmli sample buffer under reducing conditions, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with (i) anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (1:5000), (ii) anti-cortactin mAb (1:1000), or (iii) anti-Syk pAb (1:1000). Syk kinase activation was evaluated as autophosphorylation activity as described previously (17Taniguchi T. Kobayashi T. Kondo J. Takahashi K. Nakamura H. Suzuki J. Nagai K. Yamada T. Nakamura S. Yamamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15790-15796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following stimulation with I-BOP, platelets (1.2 ml; 6 × 108 platelets/ml) were lysed in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mmNaCl, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm Pefabloc, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF). Clarified platelet lysates were immunoprecipitated with 3 μg of anti-Syk pAb for 1 h at 4 °C. To examine the autophosphorylating activity of Syk kinase, the immunoprecipitates were washed in the same buffer twice; washed once in 10 mmTris-HCl pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmMnCl2; and then incubated in 25 μl of kinase assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mmMnCl2, 1 μm ATP) containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 15 min at 25 °C. The reaction was stopped by washing with 1 ml of ice-cold buffer B. Immunoprecipitates were recovered in Laemmli sample buffer before being subjected to 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. The addition of 10 nm of I-BOP to washed platelets for 2 min with constant stirring caused the platelets to aggregate. Fig.1 shows that the light transmission after 2-min stimulation was about 40%. The increase in light transmission was preceded by a decrease in light transmission in the 10 first seconds, which corresponded to a shape change (Fig. 1 A ). In contrast, the addition of 1 nm of I-BOP only induced the shape change in the absence of any aggregation (Fig.1 A ). Fig. 1 B shows the shape change at high and low concentrations of I-BOP. The addition of the TP antagonist SQ 29548 (Fig. 1 C ) inhibited the I-BOP-induced platelet aggregation and the shape change, which was observed whether the I-BOP concentration was high or low. In the absence of I-BOP (Fig.2), only a few proteins were significantly phosphorylated at tyrosine residues, including the 60-kDa protein previously identified as the Src kinase and the 64- and the 130-kDa bands. After 20- and 90-s stimulation with 10 nmI-BOP, phosphorylation of these substrates increased and additional tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins appeared with molecular masses of 80/85, 100/105, and 130 kDa. The increase in tyrosine phosphorylation correlated with the increase in platelet aggregation, which reached about 40% at 90 s (Fig. 2). In the absence of platelet aggregation, 20–90-s stimulation with 1 nm of I-BOP resulted in a shape change of 16 mm. Under these conditions, we only observed the additional tyrosine-phosphorylated band of 80 kDa, which slightly decreases at 90 s (Fig. 2). The treatment of platelets with SQ 29548 inhibited the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation induced by low or high concentrations of I-BOP. This inhibition was accompanied by the inhibition of shape change and aggregation. Two other conditions induced platelet shape change in the absence of aggregation. Platelets were stimulated either with high concentrations of I-BOP after pretreatment with GR 32191 or with 5 μm of 8-epi -PGF2α (Fig.3 B ). Fig. 3 A shows that when platelets were pretreated with GR 32191 before the addition of 10 nm I-BOP (middle ), or when they are stimulated with 8-epi -PGF2α for 30 s (bottom ), the tyrosine phosphorylation of 80-kDa substrate was the major substrate obtained. As in the presence of 1 nm I-BOP, the addition of SQ 29548 inhibited both the tyrosine phosphorylation of the 80-kDa substrate (Fig. 3 A ) and the shape change observed under these conditions (Fig.3 B ). Quantification by densitometry demonstrates that the level of phosphorylation of 80 kDa is increased by about 10-fold upon stimulation with low concentrations of I-BOP, 8-fold with 8-epi -PGF2α, or 5-fold upon high concentrations of I-BOP after pretreatment with GR 32191. However, this represents a much lower level of phosphorylation than that obtained upon stimulation with high concentrations of I-BOP (30-fold over the basal level) (Fig. 3 C ). The results confirm that tyrosine phosphorylation of the 80-kDa band is subjected to two different waves of phosphorylation, the second one due to the integrin engagement (13Rosa J.P. Artçanuthurry V. Grelac F. Maclouf J. Caen J.P. Lévy-Tolédano S. Blood. 1997; 89: 4385-4392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 80-kDa band appeared as the main phosphorylated substrate obtained during the early steps of platelet activation. Cortactin is a cytoskeletal tyrosine-phosphorylated protein that migrates as a doublet within the 80-kDa range and was reported previously to be tyrosine-phosphorylated in activated platelets (13Rosa J.P. Artçanuthurry V. Grelac F. Maclouf J. Caen J.P. Lévy-Tolédano S. Blood. 1997; 89: 4385-4392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We intended to analyze further whether the 80 kDa corresponded to cortactin. We thus immunoprecipitated I-BOP- (1 nm) and 8-epi -PGF2α-activated platelet lysates with a mAb specific for cortactin, followed by Western blot analysis with an anti-phosphotyrosine Ab (Anti-PY ). Fig. 4 (top ) shows that an 80/85-kDa phosphorylated doublet corresponding to cortactin was obtained in platelets stimulated by I-BOP or 8-epi -PGF2α, whereas it was strongly abolished when platelets were pretreated with SQ 29548. No phosphorylated doublet was observed either in resting platelets (I-BOP and8-epi , Fig. 4, top ) or in the presence of SQ 29548 alone (not shown). Blotting of the immunoprecipitates with the anti-cortactin mAb showed constant distribution of cortactin protein under the different conditions (Fig. 4, bottom ). Shape change was induced either by low concentrations of 8-epi -PGF2α or I-BOP. Preincubation of platelets with the protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, tyrphostin A23 at 1 mm inhibited both platelet shape change and tyrosine phosphorylation of the cortactin (Fig.5 A ). Scanner densitometry indicates that upon stimulation by 8-epi -PGF2α or I-BOP, the level of phosphorylation of cortactin returns to the basal level in the presence of A23, whereas the structurally inactive analogue tyrphostin A1 slightly decreases the level by 25% (Fig.5 C ). By preincubation of platelets with 10 μmcytochalasin D, which induces depolymerization of cytoplasmic actin, cortactin phosphorylation and shape change induced by I-BOP were also inhibited (Fig. 5 B ). The kinase activities responsible for the phosphorylation of cortactin are not well defined in platelets activated with thromboxane analogues. We wondered whether the 72-kDa Syk tyrosine kinase, which exhibits early activation during platelet activation (18Clark E.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. Bolen J. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28859-28864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), would be a potential candidate for cortactin phosphorylation throughout I-BOP-induced shape change. We first examined whether I-BOP activated Syk in platelets. After I-BOP stimulation, platelets were solubilized as described under “Experimental Procedures” at the indicated times, and Syk was immunoprecipitated by anti-human Syk pAb. Fig.6 A shows that Syk is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to low concentrations of I-BOP (1 nm) at early times (10 and 20 s) followed by a slight dephosphorylation (line 1 ). Then an in vitro kinase assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Syk kinase activity was increased at 10 and 20 s after I-BOP stimulation and then slightly decreased at 90 s (line 2 ). To address the relation between Syk activation and phosphorylation of cortactin, the same blots were immunoblotted with anti-cortactin antibody. Line 3 shows that there was an increased association of cortactin at early times (10 and 20 s) after stimulation, whereas the association decreased at 90 s. It is noteworthy that cortactin seems to be associated with Syk even in the absence of stimulation by I-BOP (Fig. 6 A , line 3 ). The amount of precipitated Syk did not change throughout the time course judging from the immunoblot analysis with anti-human Syk mAb (Anti-Syk) (line 4 ). In our experiments, Syk could not be detected in the immunoprecipitates with anti-cortactin mAb. One possibility is that the anti-cortactin mAb destabilized cortactin-Syk complexes. A similar observation was described in K 562 cells (29Maruyama S. Kurosaki T. Sada K. Yamanashi Y. Yamamoto T. Yamamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6631-6635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Finally, SQ 29548 inhibited Syk phosphorylation at all times (Fig. 6 B ), indicating the specificity of the signal sent by the activated TP receptor. We have shown previously that A23 inhibited cortactin phosphorylation upon stimulation by low concentrations of I-BOP. We wondered if the tyrosine kinase inhibitor would affect the association of cortactin with Syk. Fig. 6 C shows that A23 inhibits not only the tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk in response to low concentrations of I-BOP at early times (20 s) (line 1 ) but also the association of cortactin, which was previously detected (line 2 ). The amount of precipitated Syk did not change throughout the different conditions (line 3 ). In this study, we demonstrate that upon stimulation of platelets by low concentrations of I-BOP or by high concentrations in platelets pretreated with GR 32191 (which blocks the low affinity sites involved in aggregation) or 8-epi -PGF2α, there is a rapid stimulation of protein tyrosine phosphorylation of the 80/85-kDa doublet identified by immunoprecipitation as the cytoskeletal protein cortactin. Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is kinetically correlated with the occurrence of shape change. These effects therefore appear to be mediated by receptors with high affinity for I-BOP. The molecular basis for this functional segregation of pharmacological TP receptors subtypes is unclear. A single gene encodes the human TP receptor (19Negishi M. Namba T. Sugimoto Y. Irie A. Katada T. Narumiya S. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26067-26070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), of which there are two identified splice variants, TPα and TPβ (20Nusing R.M. Hirata M. Kakizuka A. Eki T. Ozawa K. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25253-25259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although mRNA for these isoforms has been described in human platelets (21Hirata T. Ushikubi F. Kakizuka A. Okuma M. Narumiya S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), there was no information that related either TPα or TPβ to the subtypes of TPs that have been defined pharmacologically as high or low affinity receptors. However, it has recently been shown that TPα was the major isoform expressed in platelets and that rapidly induced phosphorylation of the TPα by high I-BOP concentrations appeared to involve low affinity binding sites. However, neither low I-BOP concentrations (which induce platelet shape change) nor high agonist concentrations on platelets pretreated with GR 32191 (which blocks the low affinity sites) cause TPα phosphorylation (22Habib A. FitzGerald G.A. Maclouf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2645-2651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The inhibition of both tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin as well as platelet shape change by SQ 29548 (23Yin K. Halushka P.V. Yan Y-T Wong P.Y-K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 270: 1192-1196PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrates the role of the TP receptor inducing these biochemical and morphological events. Cortactin was initially described as a 80/85-kDa p60 c-Src substrate. It was phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in v-Src-transformed chicken embryo cells (24Wu H. Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5113-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). In normal cells, cortactin is known to be phosphorylated in response to various stimulants including growth factor and thrombin (25Wong S. Reynolds A.B. Papkoff J. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2407-2415PubMed Google Scholar, 26Maa M.C. Wilson L.K. Moyers J.S. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Parsons S.J. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2429-2438PubMed Google Scholar, 27Durieu-Trautmann O. Chaverot N. Cazaubon S. Strosberg A.D. Couraud P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12536-12540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In platelets, tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin and activation of Syk were induced by thrombin treatment both in the presence or absence of integrin engagement (13Rosa J.P. Artçanuthurry V. Grelac F. Maclouf J. Caen J.P. Lévy-Tolédano S. Blood. 1997; 89: 4385-4392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Gao J. Zoller K.E. Ginsberg M.H. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6414-6425Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Moreover, a direct association between Syk and cortactin has been demonstrated at an early stage of megakaryocytic differentiation in K 562 cells upon TPA stimulation (29Maruyama S. Kurosaki T. Sada K. Yamanashi Y. Yamamoto T. Yamamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6631-6635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The following evidence suggests here that cortactin could be a substrate for Syk at low I-BOP concentrations. (i) p72 Syk phosphorylation took place during the period when platelets were changing shape (10–30 s). This phosphorylation is accompanied by a kinase activity. (ii) Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is kinetically correlated with the activation of Syk kinase. (iii) Cortactin is associated with Syk, and this association increases along with the level of phosphorylation. A slight association of cortactin with Syk is already detected before I-BOP stimulation. The same results were observed when K 562 cells were stimulated with 12-O -tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (29Maruyama S. Kurosaki T. Sada K. Yamanashi Y. Yamamoto T. Yamamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6631-6635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, these data indicate that the kinase activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of p72 Syk can be induced through a G protein coupled to TP receptors of high affinity. TP receptors of human platelets are known to couple endogenously to at least four G proteins (Gαq, Gα12, Gα13, and Gαi2). The low affinity platelet TP receptor that mediates platelet aggregation seems to be regulated via Gαq (6Knezevic I. Borg C. Lebreton G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26011-26017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but no data were available for possible G proteins mediating platelet shape change via the apparent high affinity TP receptor. Allan et al. (10Allan C.J. Higashiura K. Martin M. Morinelli T.A. Kurtz D.T. Geoffroy O. Meier G.P. Gettys T.W. Halushka P.V. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 277: 1132-1139PubMed Google Scholar) present the first pharmacological evidence that at least two of the Gα proteins (Gαq and Gα13) thought to interact with the human platelet TP receptors are capable of regulating the affinity state of the megakaryocyte-like HEL cell TP receptor. Gα13 appears to increase the affinity of the HEL TP receptor for 125I-labeled I-BOP, although Gαqdoes not increase the affinity to the same extent. Moreover, platelets from mice deficient in Gαq can still change shape but do not aggregate after the addition of U 46619, a thromboxane analogue, therefore emphasizing the coupling of the low affinity TP receptors to Gαq (30Offermanns S. Toombs C.F. Hu Y-H. Simon M.I. Nature. 1997; 389: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Taking into account these two observations, it is suggested that high affinity TP receptors could be regulated via Gα13. This novel pathway would lead to Syk activation necessary for the phosphorylation of cortactin, a specific substrate that accompanies platelet shape change. It is noteworthy that Syk activation, cortactin phosphorylation, and shape change are kinetically correlated. What would be the role of cortactin phosphorylation within platelets? Cortactin is an F-actin-binding protein primarily localized at cortical structures and is thought to be important for microfilament-membrane interactions (13Rosa J.P. Artçanuthurry V. Grelac F. Maclouf J. Caen J.P. Lévy-Tolédano S. Blood. 1997; 89: 4385-4392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cortactin also has an F-actin cross-linking activity and is implicated in cytoskeletal reorganization. According to Huang et al. (31Huang C. Ni Y. Wang T. Gao Y. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13911-13915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), cortactin may act as an important mediator for intracellular tyrosine kinases in regulating cytoskeletal reorganization in vivo . The same authors provide evidence for the involvement of tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in the migration of endothelial cells (32Huang C. Liu J. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25770-25776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is recent evidence for important roles of cortactin in the formation and regulation of cell-cell adhesion and communication during growth, differentiation, and tumorigenesis (33Katsube T. Takahisa M. Ueda R. Hashimoto N. Kobayashi M. Togashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29672-29677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). All of these cellular processes involve dramatic changes in the cortical cytoskeleton and emphasize the role of cortactin in cell morphological changes. In platelets, actin polymerization and membrane cytoskeleton depolymerization are required for early shape change (34Fox J.E.B. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Fox J.E.B. Shattil S.J. Kinlough-Rathbone R.L. Richardson M. Packham M.A. Sanan D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7004-7011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Previous data have also demonstrated that an early pool of phosphorylated cortactin translocates to the cytoskeleton (36Ozawa K. Kashiwada K. Takahashi M. Sobue K. Exp. Cell. Res. 1995; 221: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This suggests that cortactin could play a role in cytoskeletal movements that support shape change. Our data indicate that phosphorylation of cortactin is dependent on the formation of actin skeleton, since its disruption by cytochalasin D significantly inhibits both phosphorylation and shape change. Our data also point to a role for tyrosine phosphorylation in the induction of shape change elicited by high affinity TP receptor activation, since a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, tyrphostin A23, inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin together with shape change, whereas the inactive analogue, tyrphostin A1, had no inhibitory activity. It is also noteworthy that cortactin does not any more associate to Syk in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation. Besides the role of cortactin in the cytoskeletal reorganization, it is also possible that tyrosine phosphorylation may promote its binding to cellular proteins containing Src homology 2 domains. Lastly, the structure of cortactin contains several potential signaling motifs including Src homology 3 domain at the distal C terminus (37Du Y. Weed S.A. Xiong W-C. Marshall T.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5838-5851Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). A novel cortactin-binding protein (cortactin-binding protein 1) expressed predominantly in brain tissue and colocalized with cortical actin filaments in fibroblasts has recently been identified. The Src homology 3 domain of cortactin was found to direct this interaction (37Du Y. Weed S.A. Xiong W-C. Marshall T.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5838-5851Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). All of these observations strongly suggest that cortactin mediates formation of the multiprotein complexes within the cortical cytoskeleton and may serve as a cortical actin-specific docking protein for binding partners. In conclusion, we describe a novel pathway for a G protein-coupled TxA2 high affinity receptor to the protein-tyrosine kinase Syk, which associates with a specific protein substrate, cortactin, involved in the very early steps of platelet activation, such as shape change and which requires cytoskeletal reorganization. The tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk raises the problem of its activation. Gao et al. (28Gao J. Zoller K.E. Ginsberg M.H. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6414-6425Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) indicate that engagement of the integrin GPIIb/IIIa causes an increase in the catalytic activity of the tyrosine kinase Src required for induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk. However, Syk activation does not seem to be strictly dependent on Src kinases under all conditions (38Zoller K.E. MacNeil I.A. Brugge J.S. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1650-1659PubMed Google Scholar, 39Latour S. Fournel M. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4434-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). How Syk undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in the absence of fibrinogen binding to GPIIb/IIIa and aggregation remains to be elucidated."

Although the TATA-binding subunit (TBP) of TFIID is able to support core promoter and activator-dependent transcription under some circumstances, the roles of TBP-associated factors (TAFIIs) in TFIID-mediated activation remain unclear. To define the evolutionarily conserved function of TFIID and to elucidate the roles of TAFIIs in gene activation, we have cloned the mouse TAFII55 subunit of TFIID and further isolated mouse TFIID from a murine FM3A-derived cell line that constitutively expresses FLAG-tagged mouse TAFII55. Both mouse and human TFIIDs are capable of mediating transcriptional activation by Gal4 fusions containing different activation domains in a highly purified human cell-free transcription system devoid of TFIIA and Mediator. Although TAFII-independent activation by Gal4-VP16 can also be observed in this highly purified human transcription system with either mouse or yeast TBP, TAFIIs are strictly required for estrogen receptor-mediated activation independently of the core promoter sequence. In addition, TAFIIs are necessary for transcription from a preassembled chromatin template. These findings clearly demonstrate an essential role of TAFIIs as a transcriptional coactivator for estrogen receptor and in chromatin transcription.

Currently, there are three classes of general cofactors commonly thought to be essential for activator-dependent transcription. The first class is RNA polymerase II-specific TBP-associated factors (TAFIIs)1initially defined as components of TFIID (1Burley S.K. Roeder R.G. Annu. Rev.

TAFIIs are highly conserved through evolution and exhibit many properties accounting for the functional activities of TFIID. In general, TFIID is a core promoter-binding factor that has intrinsic activity to recognize the TATA box, initiator and downstream promoter elements, and initiates preinitiation complex assembly on both TATA-containing and TATA-less promoters (1Burley S.K. Roeder R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 769-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 7Burke T.W. Kadonaga J.T.

The nucleation pathway for preinitiation complex formation usually begins with TFIID binding to the core promoter region, followed either by sequential assembly of other general transcription factors (GTFs) and RNA polymerase II (pol II) or by recruitment of a preassembled pol II holoenzyme complex (9Struhl K. Cell. 1996; 84: 179-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 10Ptashne M. Gann A. Nature. 1997; 386: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 11Myer V.E.

In addition to the core promoter-binding activity, TFIID has also been implicated as a general coactivator or corepressor in transducing the regulatory signals to the general transcription machinery, as exemplified by many protein-protein interactions occurring between gene-specific regulatory factors and components of TFIID (1Burley S.K.

This viewpoint is further substantiated by the observation that the requirement of the largest subunit of TFIID for transcription of G1/S cyclin genes is mainly determined by the sequence context of the core promoter region (22Walker S.S.

TFIID also possesses protein kinase activity that phosphorylates the RAP74 component of TFIIF (30Dikstein R. Ruppert S. Tjian R.

Indeed, the findings that TBP-free TAFII-containing complex can functionally substitute for TFIID in mediating basal and activated transcription from both TATA-containing and TATA-less promoters (39Wieczorek E. Brand M. Jacq X. Tora L. Nature. 1998; 393: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and that yeast TAFII61/68 is required for SPT-ADA-GCN5-acetyltransferase-dependent nucleosomal histone acetyltransferase activity and transcriptional activation from chromatin templates in vitro (36Grant P.A.

The second class of general cofactors is upstream stimulatory activity-derived components found in the phosphocellulose P11, 0.85m KCl fraction of HeLa nuclear extracts (40Meisterernst M. Roy A.L. Lieu H.M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1991; 66: 981-993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Further fractionation of upstream stimulatory activity led to the identification of several positive cofactors (PCs) including PC1, PC2, PC3, and PC4, and negative cofactors (41Kaiser K. Meisterernst M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 342-345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4478-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interestingly, TFIIA and TFIIH, working in conjunction with PC4, TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and pol II are able to support Gal4-VP16-mediated activation in vitro in the absence of TAFIIs (20Wu S.-Y. Kershnar E. Chiang C.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4478-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), suggesting that TFIIA and TFIIH may potentially function as coactivators in TAFII-independent activation. The third class of general cofactors is Mediator which joins the initiation complex via its interaction with the nonphosphorylated form of pol II and is also found as a component of pol II holoenzyme (11Myer V.E.

Cell. 1998; 2: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), in activator-dependent transcription remains to be elucidated. To define the evolutionarily conserved function of TFIID and to elucidate the roles of TAFIIs in gene activation, we have cloned the mouse TAFII55 (mTAFII55) subunit of TFIID and further isolated mouse TFIID from a murine FM3A-derived cell line that expresses FLAG-tagged mTAFII55. The protein composition of mouse TFIID is similar to that of human TFIID, as judged by silver staining and Western blotting with both anti-human TBP and anti-human TAFII antibodies. The ability of mouse TFIID in mediating basal and activated transcription was then examined in a highly purified human cell-free transcription system reconstituted with recombinant TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, PC4, Gal4 fusions containing different activation domains, and epitope-tagged TFIID, TFIIH, and pol II complexes (20Wu S.-Y. Kershnar E. Chiang C.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4478-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The evolutionarily conserved functions between human and mouse TFIIDs were also evidenced by the finding that both mouse and yeast TBPs can support transcriptional activation mediated by Gal4-VP16 in this highly purified human transcription system in the absence of TAFIIs. To further define the role of TBP and TAFIIs in activator-dependent transcription, we extend our studies toward the use of more physiologically relevant activators and transcriptional templates. We found that TAFIIs become essential when the transcriptional activity of human estrogen receptor α (ER) was investigated in this highly purified in vitro transcription system. The TAFII-dependent ER-mediated activation can be observed with a DNA template containing four estrogen response elements (EREs) linked to the adenovirus major late promoter, which is the same core promoter also linked to five Gal4-binding sites in a DNA template used for TAFII-independent Gal4-VP16-mediated activation, suggesting that TAFIIs are collectively required as a coactivator, not as a core promoter-binding factor, for ER-mediated activation. Furthermore, by using the Drosophila S190 chromatin assembly extract and purified core histones for chromatin assembly (58Kamakaka R.T. Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1779-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) in conjunction with an in vitro transcription system comprising a preassembled TFIID-deficient pol II holoenzyme complex and either TFIID or TBP (19Wu S.-Y. Chiang C.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12492-12498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we demonstrate that TAFIIs are necessary for transcription from a preassembled chromatin template. These findings clearly illustrate an essential role of TAFIIs as a transcriptional coactivator for ER-mediated activation and in chromatin transcription. A DNA fragment encoding human TAFII55 was excised from pF:55(ORF)-11d (59Chiang C.-M. Roeder R.G. Science. 1995; 267: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) with Nde I and Bam HI, and used as probe to screen a 16-day mouse embryo cDNA library (Novagen, catalog number 69640-1). The probe was made by using the multiprimer DNA labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and purified by passing through a Nick column containing Sephadex G-50 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Plating and screening of the cDNA library were performed as described (60Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) except that 25% of formamide was also included in the prehybridization and hybridization solutions. After hybridization at 42 °C overnight, the filters were washed with 4X SSC plus 0.1% SDS (60Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) four times at room temperature and three times at 42 °C (10 min for each wash), and finally one time at room temperature for 60 min. Autoradiography of filters was done at −80 °C. Eleven clones that hybridized with the hTAFII55 probe were picked up and replated for a secondary screening. Five clones were then further analyzed by DNA sequencing after excision and plasmid rescue according to the manufacturer's protocols. The sequence of a full-length mouse TAFII55 cDNA, determined from a single phage isolate, was deposited to GenBank with accession number AF144562. A DNA fragment with an N-terminalNde I site and a C-terminal Bam HI site flanking the mTAFII55-coding region was isolated by polymerase chain reaction amplification from pEXlox-mTAFII55 (number 28), which is the mTAFII55 cDNA-containing plasmid rescued from a mouse cDNA library. The polymerase chain reaction fragment was then cloned into pBn-F:55 (59Chiang C.-M. Roeder R.G. Science. 1995; 267: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) and pF:TBP-11d (61Chiang C.-M.

Peptide Res. 1993; 6: 62-64PubMed Google Scholar), after replacing the original insert with the mTAFII55-coding region betweenNde I and Bam HI sites, to generate pBn-F:mTAFII55 and pF:mTAFII55–11d, respectively. A bacterial expression plasmid, pF:yTBP-11d, which contains FLAG-tagged yeast TBP, was similarly made by cloning the yeast TBP insert from pGEMIID8 (obtained from A. Hoffmann and R. G. Roeder) into pF:TBP-11d between Nde I and Bam HI sites. The p4EREΔ53 plasmid, containing 4 copies of the Xenopus vitellogenin A2 gene ERE (62Walker P. Germond J.-E. Brown-Luedi M. Givel F. Wahli W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 8611-8626Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) linked to the adenovirus major late core promoter (AdMLP) in front of a G-less cassette of approximately 280 nucleotides, was created by polymerase chain reaction amplification with a pair of the Eco RI site-containing primers (sense primer: 5′-AAGGATCCGAATTCAAGCTTGCATGCCTGCAG-3′; antisense primer: 5′-AAGGATCCGAATTCATAGGACTGGGGATCCTC-3′) that bind to the sequences flanking the 4 EREs of pERE (63Kraus W.L. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), and cloned into theEco RI-linearized pMLΔ53 plasmid (40Meisterernst M. Roy A.L. Lieu H.M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1991; 66: 981-993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The pHMC2AT-200 plasmid with a G-less cassette of approximately 200 nucleotides preceded by the HIV-1 TATA and AdMLP initiator elements was also constructed by polymerase chain reaction with anEco RI site-containing sense primer (5′-AGTGAATTCGAGCTCGGTAC-3′) that anneals to the 5′-flanking sequence of the HIV-1 TATA box and an Xba I site-containing antisense primer (5′-GGATAAGATTTCTAGAGGGGAGG-3′) that anneals to ∼200 nucleotides downstream of the transcription start site of pMHIVTATA (40Meisterernst M. Roy A.L. Lieu H.M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1991; 66: 981-993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and cloned into pML(C2AT) (64Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4394-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) betweenEco RI and Xba I sites. To construct a baculovirus-expressing plasmid for the expression of FLAG-tagged human papillomavirus type 11 (HPV-11) E2 protein, we first subcloned the HPV-11 E2 cDNA from p6HisF:E2–11d (59Chiang C.-M. Roeder R.G. Science. 1995; 267: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) into pFLAGo(S)-7 (65Wu S.-Y. Chiang C.-M. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) between Nde I andBam HI sites to create pFo:E2–7. The FLAG-tagged HPV-11 E2-coding region was then isolated from pFo:E2–7 between Eco RI and Bam HI sites, and cloned into pVL1392 (Invitrogen) at the same enzyme-cutting sites to generate pVL-Fo:E2. The baculovirus-expressing plasmid pVL-F:Sp1(FL), containing the full-length open reading frame of human Sp1, was constructed initially by cloning the Nde I (created at the initiation codon) and Sma I-digested fragment from pBS-Sp1-f1 (obtained from J.-L. Chen and R. Tjian) into pF:TBP-11d after removing the TBP insert between Nde I and Klenow enzyme-treated Bam HI sites to generate pF:Sp1(FL)-11d, in which the Sp1 insert was subsequently cloned into pFLAG(AS)-7 (66Chiang C.-M. Ge H. Wang Z. Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2749-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) between Nde I and Eco RI sites to create pF:Sp1(FL)-7. The FLAG-tagged Sp1-coding sequence was then cleaved from pF:Sp1(FL)-7 between Nsi I and Xba I sites and cloned into pVL1392 between Pst I and Xba I sites to produce pVL-F:Sp1(FL). FLAG-tagged mouse TFIID was purified from a mouse FM3A-derived cell line, FM55-3, that constitutively expresses the FLAG-tagged mTAFII55 subunit of mouse TFIID following P11 chromatography and immunoaffinity purification. The FM55-3 cell line was cloned by limiting dilution from pooled G418-resistant colonies, initially obtained by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer with pBn-F:m55 as described (66Chiang C.-M. Ge H. Wang Z. Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2749-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Both FM55-3 and FM3A cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with either 10% fetal bovine serum for monolayer culture or 5% calf serum for suspension culture. Mouse TFIID was then purified from the P11, 0.85 mKCl fraction of FM55-3 nuclear extracts following the same procedure for purification of FLAG-tagged human TFIID (66Chiang C.-M. Ge H. Wang Z. Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2749-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), except that BC100 was used for the final wash before peptide elution. FLAG-tagged TFIIH and FLAG-tagged pol II were purified from the P11, 0.5 m KCl fraction of F:62-8(H) nuclear extracts and hRPB9-3 S100, respectively (31Kershnar E. Wu S.-Y. Chiang C.-M. J. Biol.

Purification of recombinant TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, PC4, and various Gal4 fusion proteins was conducted as described previously (19Wu S.-Y. Chiang C.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12492-12498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed FLAG-tagged mouse and yeast TBPs were purified following the same procedure for purification of FLAG-tagged human TBP (61Chiang C.-M. Roeder R.G. Peptide Res. 1993; 6: 62-64PubMed Google Scholar). Drosophila S190 chromatin assembly extracts and core histones were prepared according to the published protocol (58Kamakaka R.T. Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1779-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The TFIID-deficient pol II holoenzyme complex (f:pol II) was purified from hRPB9-3 cells that conditionally express the FLAG-tagged RPB9 subunit of human pol II as described previously (19Wu S.-Y. Chiang C.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12492-12498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Further purification of f:pol II was conducted by applying 1 ml of the immunoaffinity-purified f:pol II complex (isolated from S100) onto a Mono-Q HR5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 100 mmKCl-containing BC buffer (66Chiang C.-M. Ge H. Wang Z. Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2749-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) with 10% glycerol. Proteins were fractionated with a 10-ml linear gradient from 0.1 to 1.2 mKCl-containing BC buffer with 10% glycerol and collected at 0.5 ml/tube at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The number 11 fraction elutes at a KCl concentration around 0.65 m. FLA"

In contrast to the parental HL-60 cells, HL-525 is resistant to TNF-α-induced apoptosis but sensitive to anti-Fas mAb-induced apoptosis. Both cell types expressed similar levels of the TNF-receptor I, whereas the Fas receptor was detected only in HL-525 cells. Transfecting the HL-525 cells with an expression vector containing PKC-β reestablished their susceptibility to TNF-α-induced apoptosis. The apoptotic effect of TNF-α in HL-60 and the transfectants was abrogated by fumonisin, an inhibitor of ceramide generation, and by the peptide Ac-YVAD-BoMK, an inhibitor of caspase-1 and -4. Supplementing HL-525 cells with exogenous ceramides bypassed the PKC-β deficiency and induced apoptosis, which was also restrained by the caspase-1 and -4 inhibitor. The apoptotic effect of anti-Fas mAb in HL-525 cells was abrogated by the antioxidantsN -acetylcysteine and glutathione and by the peptide z-DEVD-FMK, an inhibitor of caspase-3 and -7.

TNF-α and Fas ligand (or specific agonistic monoclonal antibodies) induce apoptosis by binding to their respective death domain-containing receptors, TNF-RI and Fas (15Pan G. O'Rourke K.

This domain is a protein-protein interaction motif that orchestrates the assembly of a signaling complex leading to the recruitment of the proapoptotic protease caspases. These proteases, related to the Caenorhabditis elegans death geneCed-3 , are cysteine aspartases that can be divided into two classes on the basis of the lengths of their N-terminal prodomains. Caspase-1, -2, -4, -5, -8, and -10 have long prodomains, whereas caspase-3, -6, -7, and -9 have short prodomains (16Villa P. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 388-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Recently, caspases were shown to be key executioners of apoptosis mediated by various inducers, including TNF-α and anti-Fas mAb (16Villa P. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Trends Biochem.

The human HL-60 myeloid leukemia cell line is often used as a model system to study apoptosis in myeloid progenitor cells (1Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A.

Blood. 1993; 82: 3133-3140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From HL-60 cells, we have developed in our laboratory a variant cell line, HL-525 (22Homma Y. Henning-Chubb C.B. Huberman E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7316-7319Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), that is deficient in PKC-β gene expression (23Tonetti D.A. Henning-Chubb C. Yamanishi D.T. Huberman E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11576-11582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These cell lines, therefore, serve as useful cell models for studying critical cellular events that require PKC, in particular PKC-β isozyme. Previously, it was reported that PKC is antagonistic to apoptosis mediated by certain inducers (1Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar, 25Porn-Ares M.I. Chow S.C. Slotte J.P. Orrenius S. Exp.

Additional work, however, has indicated that PKC can act not only as a negative regulator of cell death but also a potentiator of the apoptotic effect of other inducers (20Bertrand R. Solary E. Jenkins J. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 207: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 21Bhalla K. Ibrado A.M. Tourkina E. Tang C. Grant S. Bullock G. Huang Y. Ponnathpur V. Mahoney M.E.

The reason for this discrepancy may be due to the presence of discrete PKC isozyme patterns in different cell systems, with specific isoforms or combinations of isoforms having different and sometimes opposing effects. This study was initiated to (a ) examine the role of one of these isozymes, PKC-β, in TNF-α and Fas-mediated apoptosis in human myeloid progenitor cells and (b ) determine the temporal relationship of this PKC with other apoptotic mediators, including ceramides, reactive oxygen intermediates, and caspases, in this process. Reagents Ac-YVAD-pNA, Ac-DEVD-pNA, and Z-DEVD-FMK and the mAb to Fas (IgG1 and DX2) were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Ac-YVAD-BoMK was from Bachem (Torrance, CA). Cell permeant C2-ceramide, IgG1, glutathione,N -acetylcysteine, fumonisin-B1, andd-erythro-sphingosine were from Sigma. The sphingolipids were initially dissolved in 100% ethanol and stored at −70 °C. For experimental use, sphingolipid stocks were prepared as described previously (28Jarvis W.D. Fornari Jr., F.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8275-8284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). mAbs to TNF-RI and TNF-RII (IgG1) were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), and indocarcyanine-conjugated anti-murine goat immunoglobulin (Cy3TM) was from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). TNF-α and the in situ apoptosis detection kit were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The ProtoBlot II AP system with stabilized substrate was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). The human myeloid HL-60 leukemia cell line was originally obtained from R. C. Gallo of the NCI, National Institutes of Health. The HL-525 cells were established in our laboratory and have been described previously (22Homma Y. Henning-Chubb C.B. Huberman E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7316-7319Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated in tissue culture plates with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Intergen Co., Purchase, NY), penicillin (100 μg/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 2 mm l-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in an humidified atmosphere containing 8% CO2. Stable transfectants were obtained by electroporation using a Bio-Rad gene pulser apparatus with a capacitance extender in 0.4-cm gap electroporation cuvettes (Eppendorf Scientific, Madison, WI) as described previously (23Tonetti D.A. Henning-Chubb C. Yamanishi D.T. Huberman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23230-23235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pMV7-RP58 plasmid (kindly provided by I. B. Weinstein, Columbia University) contained both the full-length rat PKC-β1 cDNA and the bacterial neomycin phosphotransferase gene (neo ) that confers resistance to the antibiotic G418 (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.). The pMV7 plasmid contained neo only. For each transfection, 5 × 106 cells in 0.2 ml of medium were mixed with 10 μg of supercoiled plasmid DNA and 0.2 ml of phosphate-buffered sucrose (272 mm sucrose, 7 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.4) in a total volume of 0.5 ml. The cells were electroporated at 250 V and allowed to recover in 10 ml of serum-supplemented RPMI medium for 24 h prior to selection in a medium containing 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin. The Geneticin-resistant transfectants were obtained by limited dilution in 24-well plates and tested for PKC-β expression and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate inducibility of macrophage markers. The selected clones were maintained in Geneticin-containing medium. Because of their instability, we used pMV7-RP58 transfectants within 2 months (23Tonetti D.A. Henning-Chubb C. Yamanishi D.T. Huberman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23230-23235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), before they lost their functionally restored PKC-β phenotype. The immunostaining procedures were carried out at 4 °C by using either 96-microwell plates or tissue culture chamber slides (Nunc, Inc., Naperville, IL). The cells (5 × 105/ml) were washed twice with PBSA (PBS solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% NaN3) and incubated for 45 min with IgG1 or 10–50 μg/ml specific mAb. The cells were then washed twice with PBSA and incubated for an additional 45 min with a goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to CY3TM. After a wash with PBSA, the slides were mounted with phosphate-buffered GelvatolTM (Becton Dickinson, Sunnyvale, CA). Fluorescence was examined by using a Micro-Tome Mac Digital Confocal system (VayTek, Fairfield, IA) attached to a Leitz Orthoplan fluorescence microscope. Pellets containing 109 cells were lysed in buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) by Dounce homogenization and stirred for 30 min on ice. Nuclei and cellular debris were removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min. Samples containing equal protein amounts were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 10% gels. Proteins were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes or were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 to verify equal loading. Immunoblots were incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween-20) for 30 min. The blocking solution was decanted and replaced with solutions containing mAbs to either Fas, TNF-RI, or TNF-RII in TBST at 50 μg/ml and incubated with agitation for 2 h. After three TBST washes, the immunoblots were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-IgG for 30 min, washed three times in TBS buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 150 mmNaCl), and then incubated with alkaline phosphatase substrate. When the color of the reaction developed to the desired intensity, the reaction was quenched by washing the immunoblots in deionized water. The experimental procedure for the TUNEL was conducted as described previously (29Sgonc R. Boeck G. Dietrich H. Gruber J. Rechets H. Wick G. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 41-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell pellets were washed twice in PBS/1% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C, adjusted to 106cells/ml, and then transferred into a V-bottomed 96-well microtiter plate. A freshly prepared paraformaldehyde solution (4% in PBS, pH 7.4) was added to the cell suspension for 30 min at room temperature. After being washed twice, the cells were permeabilized by incubation with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate for 2 min at 4 °C. As a positive control, 1 mg/ml DNaseI was added to permeabilized and fixed cells to induce DNA strand breaks. The TUNEL reaction was carried out with using the manufacturer's supplied buffer and terminal transferase and nucleotides for 60 min at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere in the dark. As a negative control, buffer without terminal transferase was added to the cells. After a wash, the pellet was resuspended in 10 μl of phosphate-buffered GelvatolTM and transferred onto slides. The incorporation of the fluorescein-labeled nucleotides into DNA strand breaks was detected by using the VayTek confocal fluorescent microscope. Caspase activities in cell lysates were assayed with fluorogenic pNA substrates. Briefly, 10 μl of cell lysate samples containing equal protein concentrations, were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 0.1 ml of protease buffer (100 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.6), 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 8 mm glucose, and 1% bovine serum albumin) in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml substrate. Formation of the pNA product in the supernatant was assayed at 405 nm. Initially, we examined the apoptotic effect of TNF-α and anti-Fas mAb in HL-60 and its variant HL-525 cells, because these agents have been reported to induce apoptosis (1Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M.

Biochem. 1997; 250: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To assess apoptotic changes, we used an in situ method for detection of fluorescein-labeled DNA strand breaks, which is based on the TUNEL method (29Sgonc R. Boeck G. Dietrich H. Gruber J. Rechets H. Wick G. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 41-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 30Pihlgren M. Thomas J. Marvel J. Biochemica. 1996; 3: 12Google Scholar). Unlike detection by the typical “DNA ladder” on agarose gels, the TUNEL method detects apoptosis at a single-cell level (29Sgonc R. Boeck G. Dietrich H. Gruber J. Rechets H. Wick G. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 41-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 30Pihlgren M. Thomas J. Marvel J. Biochemica. 1996; 3: 12Google Scholar). By using this method we were able to show that treatment of HL-60 cells with 2 × 103 units/ml TNF-α resulted in a time-dependent increase in the percentage of cells exhibiting apoptosis, whereas only a limited apoptotic effect was observed after incubation with the anti-Fas mAb (Fig. 1). The inverse situation was observed in HL-525 cells: TNF-α was inactive, whereas the anti-Fas mAb (but not the IgG control) caused a time-dependent increase in the percentage of cells exhibiting apoptosis (Fig. 1). The induction of apoptosis caused by TNF-α and anti-Fas mAb in HL-60 and HL-525 cells, respectively, was also dose-dependent (data not shown). These results indicate that TNF-α and anti-Fas mAb have divergent apoptotic effects in HL-60 and HL-525 cells. TNF-α and Fas mAb induce apoptosis by binding to their respective receptors, TNF-RI (and possibly TNF-RII) and Fas (15Pan G. O'Rourke K. Chinnaiyan A.M. Gentz R. Ebner R. Ni J. Dixit V.M.

Because the absence of such receptors may account for the inability of their respective ligands to generate an apoptotic effect, we compared the expression of these receptors in HL-60 and HL-525 cells by Western blotting. We detected similar levels of the TNF-RI and the weakly expressed TNF-RII in both cell types, whereas the Fas receptor was detected in HL-525 cells but not in HL-60 cells (Fig.2). In addition, to demonstrate that these proteins were not only expressed but also manifested on the cell surface, we conducted immunostaining of viable HL-60 and HL-525 cells using the same antibodies used in the Western blotting experiments. The results (data not shown) demonstrated a similar pattern and level of cell surface manifestation of these receptors as seen in the Western blot. These results suggest that the inability of HL-60 cells to undergo anti-Fas mAb-induced apoptosis is caused by the absence of the Fas receptor in these cells, whereas the inability of TNF-α to induce apoptosis in HL-525 cells is due either to a defective TNF-RI/II or to an impaired TNF-α signaling pathway. It has been suggested that cooperation of both TNF-RI and TNF-RII may mediate the TNF-α-induced apoptosis process (31Murray J. Barbara J.A. Dunkley S.A. Lopez A.F. VanOstade X. Condliffe A.M.

One would speculate that receptor ligation with neutralizing mAbs to the individual TNF-α receptors could distinguish which receptor mediated the apoptotic effect of TNF-α in HL-60 cells. By using specific anti-TNF-RI and TNF-RII mAbs (at 10 μg/ml), we found that induction of apoptosis in HL-60 cells by TNF-α was attenuated by more than 70% using the anti-TNF-RI mAb, whereas the anti-TNF-RII mAb was ineffective, suggesting that TNF-RII is not critical for this process. We have previously demonstrated that HL-525 cells are deficient in PKC-β gene expression and that restoration of PKC-β gene expression results in recovery of sensitivity to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced macrophage differentiation (22Homma Y. Henning-Chubb C.B. Huberman E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7316-7319Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 23Tonetti D.A. Henning-Chubb C. Yamanishi D.T. Huberman E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11576-11582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To determine whether deficient expression of PKC-β or another PKC isozyme plays a similar role in the resistance to TNF-α-induced apoptosis, we screened the HL-60 and HL-525 cell lines for the expression of nine PKC isoenzymes using immunofluorescence. We found that, with the exception of PKC-β, which is expressed in HL-60 but not in HL-525 cells (23Tonetti D.A. Henning-Chubb C. Yamanishi D.T. Huberman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23230-23235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Xie B. Laouar A. Huberman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11576-11582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), the expression of the other PKC isoenzymes showed the same pattern between HL-60 and HL-525 cells. Both cell lines highly express PKC-α, -λ, and -μ and rack-1, weakly express PKC-ε, -θ, and -δ, and express little or no PKC-ζ (data not shown). Therefore, we examined the possibility that PKC-β isozyme is involved in TNF-α-induced apoptosis. We isolated stable HL-525 clones transfected with an expression plasmid containing the full-length PKC-β cDNA and neo , the gene that confers Geneticin resistance. As a control, we isolated HL-525 clones transfected with a plasmid containing neo only. Stable transfectants were then screened for their expression of PKC-β mRNA by Northern blotting. Our results indicate that PKC-β gene expression was restored in the HL-525 cells transfected with the PKC-β expression plasmid, whereas the control cells remained deficient (Fig. 3 A ). Because the PKC-β transfectants are unstable and lose their functional PKC-β within 2 months (23Tonetti D.A. Henning-Chubb C. Yamanishi D.T. Huberman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23230-23235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these clones were used in the experiments prior to a major drift in this phenotype. The transfectants with functional PKC-β regained susceptibility to TNF-α-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3 B ). No restoration of TNF-α-induced apoptosis was observed in HL-525 cells transfected with the control vector (Fig. 3 B ). On the other hand, restoration of PKC-β gene expression in HL-525 cells reduced the susceptibility of these cells to anti-Fas mAb-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3 B ) and diminished Fas immunostaining from 100% to about 40% of the cell population. Taken together, these results implicate PKC-β in the signal transduction pathway leading to TNF-α-mediated apoptosis in the HL-60 cell system; the inability of TNF-α to induce apoptosis in HL-525 cells seems to be due to an insufficient level of this PKC isoenzyme. The inability of anti-Fas mAb to induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells may be attributed to a lack of the Fas receptor, which seems to be negatively regulated by PKC-β. To demonstrate that PKC activity, rather than just the presence of the introduced PKC-β protein, was necessary for TNF-α activity, we employed inhibitors of PKC and PKA/PKG. Pretreatment of HL-60 cells with 25 μm H7, a specific inhibitor of PKCs, repressed the ability of 2000 units/ml TNF-α to induce apoptosis by 87%, whereas 100 μm HA1004, an inhibitor of PKA and PKG enzyme activities, was without significant effect. Therefore, the mere presence of a PKC protein is not sufficient; PKC must exert activity as well to transduce the apoptosis-inducing properties of TNF-α in HL-60 cells. Because ceramides and ROIs were reported to be involved in various pathways leading to apoptosis (3Wolff R.A. Dobrowsky R.T. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

To delineate the specific mediators involved in these pathways, we incubated these cells with 0.5 μm fumonisin, an inhibitor of ceramide generation (36Boland M.P. Foster S.J. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol.

At these doses, the inhibitors themselves did not affect the viability of untreated HL-60 or IgG-treated HL-525 cells (Fig.4 A ). Our results indicated that fumonisin effectively inhibited TNF-α-mediated apoptosis in HL-60 cells but not anti-Fas mAb-mediated apoptosis in HL-525 cells (Fig. 4 A ). On the other hand, the antioxidantsN -acetylcysteine and gluthatione effectively inhibited apoptosis induction by the anti-Fas mAb in HL-525 cells and to a limited degree by TNF-α in HL-60 cells (Fig. 4 A ). These results implicate ceramides as mediators of TNF-α-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells and ROIs in anti-Fas mAb-induced apoptosis. It was, therefore, of interest to determine whether supplying ceramides exogenously to HL-525 cells would bypass the PKC-β deficiency and would induce apoptosis. In a similar fashion, it was of interest to determine whether exogenous H2O2, which generates intercellular ROIs, would induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells. For this reason, we cultured HL-60 and HL-525 cells with 10 μm of either cell permeable c2-ceramide ord-erythrosphingosine, a ceramide precursor (37Jafferrezou J.P. Levade T. Bettaieb A. Andrieu N.

Ascorbate is transported as such or is oxidized extracellularly to dehydroascorbic acid, transported by glucose transporters, and reduced internally (3Rumsey S.C. Levine M. J. Nutr.

Under physiologic conditions in the absence of oxidation, ascorbate is the primary, if not the only, substrate available (13Dhariwal K.R. Hartzell W.O. Levine M. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1991; 54: 712-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 14Koshiishi I. Mamura Y. Liu J. Imanari T. Clin. Chem. 1998; 44: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it remains unknown whether normal intracellular ascorbate accumulation occurs solely due to ascorbate transport itself or whether some fraction of ascorbate is oxidized at the cell membrane to dehydroascorbic acid, transported, and reduced intracellularly. A serious disadvantage in using ascorbate itself to discriminate these mechanisms of transport is that ascorbate can be accumulated by both pathways. To characterize the mechanisms of ascorbate accumulation physiologically, a compound is needed that is similar to ascorbate but is transported by only one mechanism. Such a compound has not been available. An ideal compound should meet several criteria. It should be similar to ascorbate because this is the substrate found physiologically. The compound should be measurable in small amounts. Its utility would be greatly enhanced if the compound could be detected easily, for example by HPLC or, especially, by radiochemical detection. Current radioactive detection of ascorbate is problematic because of low specific activity of available radiolabeled ascorbate, emphasizing the need for a much higher specific activity radiolabeled analog. Finally, an ideal compound to study transport and accumulation would be specific for mechanisms of ascorbate transport only and would show no activity toward dehydroascorbic acid transport mechanisms. To address these issues, we synthesized or obtained 21 structural analogs of ascorbate having substitutions or conformational changes at positions 2–6. We studied the ability of each analog to inhibit ascorbate transport in cultured human fibroblasts, cells in which ascorbate transport kinetics have been previously characterized (15Welch R.W. Bergsten P. Butler J.D. Levine M. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we synthesized 6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbate and [125I]6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbate,a high specific activity ascorbate analog, and we characterized their transport characteristics in fibroblasts and in Xenopus oocytes expressing glucose transporter isoforms GLUT1 or GLUT3. The results suggested that 6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbate and [125I]6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbate may be ideal compounds for quantitation of ascorbate-specific transport.

The analogs 6-deoxy-, 6-deoxy-6-iodo-, 6-deoxy-6-chloro-, 6-deoxy-6-fluoro-, 6-deoxy-6-bromo-, 6-O- phenyl-, 6-O- (3-nitro)phenyl-, and 6-O- (3-trifluoro)phenyl-l-ascorbic acid were synthesized as described below. 6-deoxy-l-ascorbic acid and 6-deoxy-6-halo-l-ascorbic acid analogues were prepared using a published procedure with modifications (16Kiss J. Berg K.P. Dirsherl A. Oberhansli W.E. Arnold W. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1980; 63: 1728-1739Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The halogenated analogs were synthesized by halogenation of methyl 2,3-O- isopropylidene-l-gulonate, followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis/rearrangement to form the ascorbic acid derivative. This latter step was carried out in methanolic HCl, a modification of the published procedure that gave improved yields of 6-chloro- and 6-bromo-6-deoxy-l-ascorbic acids. Nucleophilic addition of fluoride and iodide to methyl 2,3-isopropylidene-6-O -trifluoromethylsulfonyl-l-gulonate, followed by methanolic HCl-mediated hydrolysis and rearrangement, produced 6-deoxy-6-fluoro- and 6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbic acids, respectively. In the nucleophilic substitution, use of the trifluoromethanesulfonate ester rather than thep -toluenesulfonate ester (16Kiss J. Berg K.P. Dirsherl A. Oberhansli W.E. Arnold W. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1980; 63: 1728-1739Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) resulted in a more rapid reaction and improved yields. 6-Deoxy-l-ascorbic acid was prepared by hydrogenolysis of 6-bromo-l-ascorbic acid over palladium on carbon (16Kiss J.

Melting point and NMR spectral data of these analogues were in agreement with reported values. 6-O- Aryl-l-ascorbic acids were prepared by reaction of methyl 2,3-isopropylidene-6-O- trifluoromethylsulfonyl-l-gulonate with the corresponding sodium phenoxides, followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis and rearrangement of the intermediate 6-substituted gulonic ester, as above. 6-O- (3-Trifluoromethyl)phenyl-l-ascorbic acid (melting point 155–156 °C), 6-O- (4-trifluoromethyl)phenyl-l-ascorbic acid (melting point 185–186 °C), and 6-O- (3-nitro)phenyl-l-ascorbic acid (melting point 185–187 °C) were prepared by this method. [125I]6-Deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbic acid was synthesized by an exchange reaction between methyl 2,3-isopropylidene-6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-gulonate and [125I]NaI (NEN Life Science Products). [125I]NaI (71 μl of the aqueous original solution, 25 mCi) was added to methyl 2,3-isopropylidene-6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-gulonate (1 mg in 200 μl of acetone), and the resulting solution was evaporated to dryness with nitrogen to remove water. Acetone was added (200 μl), and the vial was sealed and heated at 60 °C for 3 days. After evaporation of the solvent with nitrogen, the residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate (400 μl) and extracted with H2O (2 × 200 μl) to remove unbound free [125I]iodide. The organic layer was evaporated with nitrogen, and a solution of concentrated HCl (50 μl) in methanol (400 μl) was added. This solution was heated in the same sealed vial at 60 °C for 2 h and then evaporated to dryness under a slow stream of nitrogen to yield [125I]6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbic acid (0.67 mg, specific activity 1.4 × 104 mCi/mm). The dry radiolabeled analog was stored at −70 °C and used within 1 week. Before use the analog was diluted with ultrapure water containing 1 mm DTT to form a stock concentration of 3.5 mm. Human skin fibroblasts, strains CRL 1501 and CRL 1497, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Fibroblasts were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 1% nonessential amino acids, 2 mmglutamine, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Cultures were subdivided using 0.05% trypsin with 0.53 mm EDTA (Life Technologies). Experiments were performed using cultures with passage numbers 5–15. Fibroblasts were plated in 12-well tissue culture dishes (Costar, Cambridge, MA) and grown until confluent, approximately 7 days. Fifteen minutes before experiments, culture medium was removed and replaced with two changes of balanced salt solution (BSS) containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.9 mm KH2PO4, 1.1 mm Na2HPO4, 0.3 mmMgSO4·7H2O, 1 mmMgCl2·6H2O, 1.5 mmCaCl2·2H2O, 10 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. Inhibition of ascorbic acid transport was determined by adding the indicated concentration of inhibitor to plated cells along with [14C]ascorbic acid, final concentration 10 μm. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for the times specified in the legends. After incubation, cells were placed on ice and washed three times with 2 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Intracellular ascorbic acid was measured either by solubilizing cells with 0.1 n NaOH, 1% CHAPS or by extracting intracellular ascorbic acid with 0.5 ml of ice cold 60% methanol, 1 mmEDTA. Both methods provided similar results. The methanol/EDTA was gently swirled in the culture wells for 2 min, removed, and immediately frozen on dry ice for later HPLC analysis. An aliquot of either NaOH cell lysate or methanol/EDTA extraction solution was removed, and radioactivity was quantified using scintillation spectrometry. Two analogs, 3-O- benzyl-l-ascorbate and 3-O- octadecyl-l-ascorbate, were initially solubilized in ethanol because of poor water solubility. Final concentrations of ethanol in the assay buffer were ≤ 1% (v/v), and control values were obtained from cells incubated with ascorbate and ethanol without inhibitor. All other inhibitors were suspended in HPLC grade H2O at final assay concentrations of ≤2% (v/v). Transport and accumulation of 6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbic acid and [125I]6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbic acid were measured in a similar manner as ascorbate above except that 0.1 mm DTT was added to the incubation medium, and 1 mm DTT was added to the 60% methanol, 1 mmEDTA extraction solution. The DTT addition was necessary to prevent analog oxidation during extraction. Cell protein was quantified from NaOH/CHAPS cell lysates using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce) (17Smith P. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Probenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.K. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18349) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as the standard. Results were calculated as pmol of ascorbate/μg of cellular protein and converted to micromolar amounts based on an intracellular volume for human fibroblasts of 11.0 ± 2.0 μl/mg of cell protein (15Welch R.W. Bergsten P. Butler J.D. Levine M. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Experimental points represent the mean ± S.D. of at least three samples. Error bars were omitted when the S.D. was less than the size of the symbol. Ascorbate mass was measured by reverse-phase HPLC using a 5μ, 250 × 4.6-mm C-18 column (Columbus, Phenomenex, Torrance CA) with coulometric electrochemical detection as described previously (18Washko P.W. Hartzell W.O. Levine M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 181: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). 6-Deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbate was measured by HPLC with electrochemical detection using the same detection system and settings, but the mobile phase used for ascorbate was modified to contain 55% methanol. [125I]6-Deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbic acid was measured using the HPLC separation conditions for unlabeled compound, with the addition of an online scintillation spectrometry detection system after the coulometric detector (12Rumsey S.C.

Xenopus oocytes were isolated and injected with mRNA coding for the glucose transporter isoforms GLUT1 or GLUT3 as described (12Rumsey S.C. Kwon O. Xu G.W. Burant C.F. Simpson I. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18982-18989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Three days postinjection, individual oocytes were incubated for 15 min at room temperature with 50 μm of either [14C]ascorbic acid or [125I]6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbate in the presence or absence of either hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (8 mm) or xanthine (50 μm) and xanthine oxidase (0.05 units/ml) (Sigma) and 36 μm DTT. The presence of DTT was due to dilution of DTT present in original stock material. After 15-min incubations, oocytes were washed four times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 μm phloretin. Individual oocytes were solubilized with 10% SDS, and internalized radioactivity was quantified by scintillation spectrometry (12Rumsey S.C. Kwon O. Xu G.W. Burant C.F. Simpson I. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18982-18989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Ascorbic acid analogs with stereochemical inversion or substitutions on carbons 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 were examined individually for their ability to inhibit ascorbic acid uptake in cultured fibroblasts (TableI). Without analog, ascorbate was accumulated at least 8-fold against a concentration gradient (not shown). Little inhibition of ascorbic acid transport was observed with compounds containing substitutions on carbon 2 or 3. Analogs examined included 2-amino-l-ascorbic acid, 2-sulfato-l-ascorbic acid, 3-O- benzyl-l-ascorbic acid, and 3-O- octadecyl-l-ascorbic acid (Table I). Two other analogs, 2-O- octadecyl-l-ascorbic acid and 2-O- myristyl-l-ascorbic acid, were also tested, but these compounds decreased adherence of fibroblasts to tissue culture plates, making interpretation of results difficult. The addition of these same compounds to human neutrophils did not inhibit ascorbate transport without toxicity as measured by trypan blue dye exclusion (not shown).Table IAnalog inhibition of ascorbate transportModificationAscorbate analogAscorbate transport (percentage of transport with no inhibitor)0 μm10 μm100 μm1000 μm%%%%Nonel-Ascorbic acid100 ± 4.664 ± 0.819 ± 0.66 ± 0.3Carbon 22-Amino-100 ± 6.4100 ± 4.389 ± 2.170 ± 4.9Carbon 22-Sulfate-100 ± 1189 ± 5.0103 ± 8.083 ± 2.0Carbon 33-O -Benzyl-100 ± 2276 ± 4.995 ± 9.871 ± 4.9Carbon 33-O -Octadecyl-100 ± 5.3102 ± 3.5107 ± 5.3109 ± 12Carbons 4 and 5d-100 ± 5.0100 ± 5.0100 ± 0.079 ± 0.0Carbon 4l-Iso-100 ± 5.084 ± 5.084 ± 5.053 ± 0.0Carbon 5d-Iso-100 ± 5.090 ± 0.070 ± 0.040 ± 10Carbons 5 and 65,6-Isopropylidene-100 ± 0.274 ± 0.068 ± 0.026 ± 0.0Carbons 3, 5, and 63-O -Methoxymethyl, 5,6-isopropylidene-100 ± 4.5100 ± 0.091 ± 0.082 ± 9.1Carbon 66-Deoxy-100 ± 1275 ± 4.051 ± 9.011 ± 0.0Carbon 66-Deoxyfluoro-100 ± 1979 ± 8.033 ± 7.017 ± 3.0Carbon 66-Deoxychloro-100 ± 1033 ± 5.05.0 ± 0.05.0 ± 0.0Carbon 66-Deoxybromo-100 ± 6.033 ± 0.06.0 ± 0.06.0 ± 0.0Carbon 66-Deoxyiodo-100 ± 1235 ± 6.06.0 ± 0.06.0 ± 0.0Carbon 66-Deoxyphenyl-100 ± 6.274 ± 0.068 ± 0.026 ± 0.0Carbon 66-Deoxynitrophenyl-100 ± 1674 ± 3.058 ± 4.013 ± 1.0Carbon 66-Deoxytrifluorophenyl100 ± 1570 ± 3.045 ± 5.010 ± 0.00 μm20 μm200 μm2000 μmCarbon 55-Deoxy-100 ± 9.374 ± 1.530 ± 1.88 ± 1.0Carbons 5 and 66-Iodo-5-deoxy-100 ± 6.820 ± 1.54 ± 3.34 ± 0.5Carbons 5 and 66-Phenoxy-5-deoxy-100 ± 4.666 ± 1.776 ± 3.223 ± 1.7Carbons 5 and 66-Phenylsulfide-5-deoxy-100 ± 8.073 ± 2.920 ± 1.112 ± 1.2Human skin fibroblasts were incubated with 10 μm[14C]ascorbate in BSS, pH 7.4, at 37 °C with the stated concentrations of inhibitors for 2 h. Intracellular ascorbic acid accumulation was measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” All compounds were of l-conformation unless noted. Because 5-deoxy compounds consisted of racemic mixtures, they were added at twice the concentration. Data represent mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. Open table in a new tab Human skin fibroblasts were incubated with 10 μm[14C]ascorbate in BSS, pH 7.4, at 37 °C with the stated concentrations of inhibitors for 2 h. Intracellular ascorbic acid accumulation was measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” All compounds were of l-conformation unless noted. Because 5-deoxy compounds consisted of racemic mixtures, they were added at twice the concentration. Data represent mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. d-Ascorbic acid, the enantiomer of l-ascorbic acid, was a poor inhibitor of ascorbate transport.l-Isoascorbic acid and d-isoascorbic acid, with stereochemical inversions at carbons 4 and 5, respectively, were only slightly more effective. 5,6-Isopropylidene-l-ascorbic acid was a moderate inhibitor, but inhibition was lost with the addition of a methoxymethyl group onto carbon 3. A series of 5-deoxy- and 6-deoxy-l-ascorbic acid analogs all effectively inhibited ascorbate transport (Table I). This series included 5- and 6-deoxy ascorbic acid, 5-deoxy and 6-deoxy-6-halo-l-ascorbic acids, and several 6-O- phenyl ethers. The 6-deoxy-6-halo compounds were by far the best inhibitors tested. The chloro, bromo, and iodo analogs were better inhibitors than l-ascorbate itself (Table I). Based on these data, we examined inhibition kinetics of the 6-halo series in greater detail. All of the 6-deoxy-6-halo-l-ascorbic acid analogs inhibited ascorbic acid transport competitively (Fig. 1,A–E ). For each analog, an inhibition constant (K i) was determined by replotting the slopes of the lines against inhibitor concentration (TableII). Without analog, ascorbate was accumulated at least 4.7-fold against a concentration gradient (not shown).Table IIInhibition constants (Ki) of 6-halo analogs for ascorbate transportCompoundK iμm6-Deoxy-l-ascorbic acid1406-Deoxy-6-fluoro-l-ascorbic acid326-Deoxy-6-chloro-l-ascorbic acid2.96-Deoxy-6-bromo-l-ascorbic acid2.86-Deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbic acid3.2l-Ascorbic acid16Inhibition constants were determined by plotting the slopes of the lines in the double reciprocal plots (Fig. 1, A–E )versus inhibitor concentration. Open table in a new tab Inhibition constants were determined by plotting the slopes of the lines in the double reciprocal plots (Fig. 1, A–E )versus inhibitor concentration. Effects of the 6-halo series on dehydroascorbic acid transport were also examined. Incubations of fibroblasts with 40 μmradiolabeled [14C]dehydroascorbic acid in the presence or absence of 1 mm analog showed no difference in dehydroascorbic acid transport or ascorbate accumulation (not shown). Lack of inhibition of ascorbate transport by analogs with alterations at position 2 or 3 suggests that these positions are needed for functional interaction with the ascorbate transporter. The specificity of the stereochemical configuration at carbons 4 and 5 is indicated by the minimal inhibition observed with the ascorbate stereochemical isomers d-ascorbate, d-isoascorbate, andl-isoascorbate. In contrast, substitutions ofl-ascorbate at carbon 5 or 6 did not appreciably affect the ability of compounds to inhibit ascorbate transport. As noted above, the 6-deoxy-6-halo analogs had lower K i values for ascorbic acid transport than ascorbic acid itself. Other structurally related compounds, including 2-deoxyglucose, 3-O- methyl glucose, serine, leucine, and threonine, did not inhibit ascorbate transport (not shown). As shown above, 6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbate was a potent and specific inhibitor of ascorbate transport. We chose this analog for further study because of two potential advantages in biochemical and cell studies. Because of the double bond at C-2–C-3, 6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbate had the possibility of being measured by HPLC with electrochemical detection. Of particular interest, it was conceivable that this compound could be made in radioiodinated form. [125I]6-Deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbic acid was synthesized by treating an excess of 2,3-isopropylidene-6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-gulonate with [125I]NaI, followed by acid-catalyzed rearrangement (see “Materials and Methods”). [125I]6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbic acid was isolated in an approximate chemical yield of 70%, with a specific activity 1.4 × 104 mCi/mm. Both nonradiolabeled and 125I-labeled 6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbate were measured using HPLC with electrochemical detection. Also, the radiolabeled compound was separated by HPLC and quantitated using on-line scintillation spectrometry. Chromatograms of each compound are shown in Fig.2. The purity of [125I]6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbate was approximately 90% after synthesis as measured by HPLC. Two small peaks, representing potential degradation products, eluted at approximately 4.3 and 5 min. No detectable free iodide was measured during HPLC analysis. Specific activity of the radiolabeled analog was over 1000-fold higher than that of commercially available14C-labeled ascorbate, resulting in a marked increase in measurement sensitivity. This is illustrated in Fig. 2 C , where the HPLC profile of 35 pmol of [125I]6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbate is compared with that of 1000 pmol of [14C]ascorbate. Using HPLC, we examined the stability of both radiolabeled and nonradiolabeled 6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbate in water; 60% methanol, 1 mm EDTA; and BSS. Stability was maintained for 6 h at 4 °C, and <5% loss occurred after 2 h at 37 °C (not shown). 0.1 mm DTT prevented loss at 37 °C and was added in experiments examining kinetics of cellular uptake. Although degradation was minimal in 60% methanol, 1 mm EDTA at 4 °C alone, some degradation occurred during cell extraction (not shown). Therefore, 1 mm DTT was added during cell extraction with 60% methanol/EDTA to prevent analog loss. Because HPLC accurately measured nonradiolabeled 6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbate, its transport properties and kinetics were examined in cultured human skin fibroblasts. Accumulation of 50 μm analog was linear for 2 h, occurred 4-fold against a concentration gradient, and was inhibited nearly 80% by 1 mm l-ascorbate (not shown). We determined whether transport and accumulation of 6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbate are sensitive to the presence of sodium, as is ascorbate transport. Fibroblasts were incubated with analog 5–130 μm in balanced salt solution with or without sodium, which was replaced by equimolar amounts of choline and potassium. Without sodium, transport and accumulation of the ascorbate analog were inhibited as much as 95% (Fig.3). Transport kinetics of 6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbate were determined by incubating fibroblasts with analog 3.75–900 μm for 1 h at 37 °C (Fig.4 A ). Data analysis demonstrated two component transport, an initial high affinity component and a secondary linear component, within the range of analog concentrations used. The high affinity component was calculated by subtracting a line extrapolated from the linear portion of the curve (15Welch R.W. Bergsten P. Butler J.D. Levine M. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As calculated by Eadie-Hofstee transformation of these data, the apparent K m was 6.7 μm and the apparent V max was 51.5 μm/h (Fig.4 B ). Calculation of transport kinetics by nonlinear curve fitting gave comparable results (not shown). We predicted that transport properties of the radiolabeled analog would be similar to those of the unlabeled compound. Transport and accumulation of [125I]6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbate (10 or 20 μm) in cultured fibroblasts were inhibited byl-ascorbate in a concentration-dependent fashion (Fig. 5 A ). Maximal inhibition of 87 and 81% for 10 and 20 μm, respectively, occurred with an external concentration of 1 mm ascorbate. Transport was examined with and without sodium (Fig. 5 B ). Without sodium, [125I]6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbate transport was inhibited as much as 93%. Apparent transport kinetics of [125I]6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbate were studied by incubating cultured fibroblasts with analog 3.75–800 μm for 1 h at 37 °C (Fig.6). Similar to results with nonradiolabeled compound, data analysis demonstrated a two component transport process: an initial high affinity component and a later nonsaturating linear component. The slope of the linear portion was identical to that seen with transport without sodium (not shown). Derivation of the data, by subtracting a line extrapolated from the linear portion of the curve followed by Eadie-Hofstee transformation, resulted in an apparent K m of 5.2 μmand an apparent V max of 17.2 μm/h. Nonlinear curve fitting yielded similar results (not shown). High affinity sodium-dependent and low affinity sodium-independent [125I]6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbate transport are consistent with ascorbate transport data in fibroblasts (15Welch R.W. Bergsten P. Butler J.D. Levine M. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Interpretations of experiments examining transport of ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid are complicated by the reversible nature of substrate oxidation and reduction. The ability to distinguish ascorbate transport from dehydroascorbic acid transport with a specific analog would be a useful tool. As described above, the 6-haloascorbate analogs did not inhibit dehydroascorbic acid transport in fibroblasts. Unlike ascorbic acid, the 6-deoxy-6-haloascorbate analogs when oxidized cannot form a stable cyclic hemiketal structure in solution because of the absence of a free 6-OH group. If, as seems possible, it is this stabilized cyclic form of dehydroascorbic acid that is transported, oxidized 6-halo analogs, including [125I]6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbate, should not be transported by mechanisms that transport dehydroascorbic acid. Dehydroascorbic acid is transported by glucose transport isoforms GLUT1 or GLUT3 expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes (12Rumsey S.C. Kwon O. Xu G.W. Burant C.F. Simpson I. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18982-18989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). To examine transport of [125I]6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbate, oocytes expressing either GLUT1 or GLUT3 were incubated with [14C]ascorbate or [125I]6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbate in the presence or absence of the oxidizing agents hydrogen peroxide or xanthine/xanthine oxidase (Fig. 7,A and B ). Consistent with previously reported data demonstrating dehydroascorbic acid transport by GLUT1 and GLUT3 (12Rumsey S.C. Kwon O. Xu G.W. Burant C.F. Simpson I. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18982-18989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 19Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Zhang R.H. Farber C.M. Golde D.W. Blood. 1994; 84: 1628-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), oxidation of [14C]ascorbate by hydrogen peroxide or xanthine/xanthine oxidase resulted in a 6- or 13-fold increase in oocyte radiolabel uptake (Fig. 7 A ). In the absence of oxidation, transport of ascorbate was not different from that in control oocytes not expressing glucose transport proteins. Transport of [125I]6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbate was also not different from control uninjected oocytes. In contrast to the results with [14C]ascorbate, oxidation of [125I]6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbate resulted in no increased uptake (Fig. 7 B ). To verify our interpretation of these results, oxidation of [14C]ascorbic acid and [125I]6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbate during incubations was measured by HPLC. Because DTT was present in the [125I]6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbate stock solution, all incubations were adjusted to contain similar amounts of DTT (37 μm), and oxidants were adjusted accordingly to assure adequate substrate oxidation. Initial concentrations of [14C]ascorbic acid and [125I]6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbate were 50 μm. Fifteen minutes after the addition of xanthine/xanthine oxidase, [14C]ascorbic acid concentration decreased 60%, and [125I]6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbate concentration decreased 55% (not shown). After the addition of H202, [14C]ascorbic acid decreased 85%, and [125I]6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbate decreased 90% (not shown). No oxidation occurred in control samples (not shown). Therefore, [125I]6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbate and its oxidized product are not transported by either GLUT1 or GLUT3-mediated mechanisms of dehydroascorbic acid transport, irrespective of the oxidation state of the analog. Goals of these experiments were to identify an ascorbate analog that is transported exclusively by ascorbate transporters, with no activity toward dehydroascorbic acid transport mechanisms. As a first step, the ability of ascorbate analogs to inhibit ascorbate transport was examined. These results provided insights into structure/activity relationships of transport inhibition. Inhibition of ascorbate transport required a C-4S absolute configuration in a five-member reduced ring with no substitutions on carbon 2 or 3. Alterations at positions 2–4 effectively eliminated or greatly reduced the ability of these compounds to interact with the ascorbate transport processes. In contrast, several compounds with substitutions on carbons 5 and 6 were inhibitors of ascorbate transport. Even analogs with comparatively large substituents, including 6-O- aryl ethers, were effective inhibitors. Of all analogs tested, 6-deoxy-6-halo-l-ascorbic acids were the best inhibitors. None of the 6-halo analogs inhibited dehydroascorbic acid transport. These initial data suggested that 6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbic acid would be a promising candidate for further development. To that end it was necessary to develop detection systems for this analog, characterize its transport characteristics as an ascorbate-like compound, and examine its selectivity toward ascorbate and dehydroascorbic acid transporters. We established a new method to quantitate 6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbic acid by HPLC with electrochemical detection. Sensitivity and specificity of quantitative detection of the analog by this method were comparable with the results obtained for ascorbic acid. This method was used to show that 6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbate was accumulated in fibroblasts with transport kinetics comparable with those previously described for ascorbate (15Welch R.W. Bergsten P. Butler J.D. Levine M. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Ascorbate transport in fibroblasts has a Na+-dependent high affinity component (K m of 6 μm) (15Welch R.W. Bergsten P. Butler J.D. Levine M. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and 6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbic acid showed a Na+-dependent high affinity component with similar kinetics (K m of 5.2 μm). The possibility of incorporating radioiodine into 6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbate sparked our interest in developing this analog as a new tool to study ascorbate transport and function. Synthesis was performed by incorporating [125I]iodide into methyl 2,3-isopropylidene-6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-gulonate, followed by acid-catalyzed rearrangement to the radiolabeled derivative. The specific activity of the final compound was approximately 1000-fold greater than that of commercially available [14C]ascorbate. Radiolabeled and nonradiolabeled analogs had identical HPLC elution times. Cellular transport of the radiolabeled compound was sodium-dependent, was inhibited by ascorbate, and had an apparent transport affinity similar to that of ascorbate. Although stability of both radiolabeled and nonradiolabeled compounds was less than that of ascorbic acid, this was addressed by utilizing either low temperatures (≤4 °C during HPLC analysis) or by the addition of 0.1–1 mm DTT. Greater instability of these compounds may be related to their inability to form stable hemiketal structures after oxidation as discussed below. Data from several laboratories (9Washko P.W. Wang Y.

Acta. 1998; 1369: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) strongly support the existence in cells of separate transport processes for ascorbate and dehydroascorbic acid. Because of the dual nature of ascorbate accumulation and because ascorbate can be oxidized to dehydroascorbic acid, experiments examining transport and accumulation of these compounds can be difficult to perform. Specific inhibitors of either transport activity would be very useful in the analysis of the relative roles of ascorbate and dehydroascorbic acid in cellular accumulation. Although glucose and similar molecules inhibit dehydroascorbic acid transport (23Mann G.V. Newton P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1975; 258: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), in some cells glucose also inhibits ascorbate transport (24Washko P. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23568-23574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the current studies, the 6-halo analogs were very effective inhibitors of ascorbate transport but did not affect dehydroascorbic acid transport. Dehydroascorbic acid exists in solution predominantly as a hydrated hemiketal (4Tolbert B.M. Ward J.B. Seib P.A. Tolbert B.M. Ascorbic Acid: Chemistry, Metabolism, and Uses. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1982: 101-123Google Scholar), which has a half-life of approximately 6 min at pH 7.4 at 37 °C (25Bode A.M. Cunningham L. Rose R.C. Clin. Chem. 1990; 36: 1807-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The 6-halo analogs do not have the necessary OH group required for cyclization to form this structure. Based on this consideration, we reasoned that oxidation of 6-dexy-6-iodo-l-ascorbic acid would lead to compounds that could not utilize transport mechanisms known to transport dehydroascorbic acid. To test this hypothesis, we expressed inXenopus oocytes GLUT1 and GLUT3, glucose transport proteins that efficiently transport dehydroascorbic acid (12Rumsey S.C. Kwon O. Xu G.W. Burant C.F. Simpson I. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18982-18989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Oxidation of 6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbic acid by either hydrogen peroxide or xanthine/xanthine oxidase failed to induce transport in this system. However, when ascorbate was oxidized similarly, transport of newly formed dehydroascorbic acid resulted in a 6–13-fold increase in ascorbic acid accumulation. Thus, although 6-dexy-6-iodo-l-ascorbic acid was a potent competitive inhibitor of ascorbate transport, its oxidation did not lead to its transport and accumulation via pathways similar to those of dehydroascorbic acid. This observation demonstrates that 6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbic acid can be used to characterize the specific contribution of ascorbate transport pathways to total intracellular ascorbate accumulation. In addition to sodium-dependent transport, ascorbate is transported in fibroblasts by a low affinity sodium-independent temperature-sensitive component (15Welch R.W. Bergsten P. Butler J.D. Levine M. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The low affinity transport activity could not be accounted for by diffusion and appeared to be carrier-mediated (15Welch R.W. Bergsten P. Butler J.D. Levine M. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this paper, we found that 6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbate also displayed sodium-independent low affinity transport, which appeared linear up to approximately 1 mm external substrate concentration. These new findings with 6- iodoascorbate provide further evidence that the low affinity transport activity exists. One interpretation of this activity is that it is due to external ascorbate oxidation, dehydroascorbic acid transport, and internal reduction (15Welch R.W. Bergsten P. Butler J.D. Levine M. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The results presented here make this interpretation unlikely, because oxidation of 6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbate did not result in its transport in oocytes expressing GLUT1 or GLUT3. Additional mechanisms to explain the low affinity sodium-independent transport activity include secondary transport processes mediated by the sodium-dependent transport protein or transport mediated by a distinct protein. Experiments to test these possibilities may be feasible using 6-deoxy-6-iodo-l-ascorbate together with a functionally expressed ascorbate transporter, which has now become available (26Tsukaguchi H. Tokui T. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Chen X-Z. Wang Y.X. Brubaker R.F. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). We thank K. Rice, A. Hopper, T.

In the presence of ligand, this transcription factor increases expression of target genes that are primarily associated with lipid homeostasis. We have previously reported PPARα as a nuclear receptor of the inflammatory mediator leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and demonstrated an anti-inflammatory function for PPARα in vivo (Devchand, P. R., Keller, H., Peters, J. M., Vazquez, M., Gonzalez, F. J., and Wahli, W. (1996) Nature 384, 39–43). LTB4 also has a cell surface receptor (BLTR) that mediates proinflammatory events, such as chemotaxis and chemokinesis (Yokomizo, T., Izumi, T., Chang, K., Takuwa, Y., and Shimizu, T.

The compounds selected were originally characterized as synthetic BLTR effectors, both agonists and antagonists. Here, we evaluate the compounds as effectors of the three PPAR isotypes (α, β, and γ) by transient transfection assays and also determine whether the compounds are ligands for these nuclear receptors by coactivator-dependent receptor ligand interaction assay, a semifunctional in vitro assay. Because the compounds are PPARα selective, we further analyze their potency in a biological assay for the PPARα-mediated activity of lipid accumulation.

Dysregulation or disruption of their signaling pathways can manifest in various ways, with defects that range in severity, rate of onset, and organ systems affected. For instance, a prolonged disturbance of lipid homeostasis is often associated with many late-onset inflammatory conditions, obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. In order to efficiently treat and prevent these prominent metabolic problems, a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in lipid regulation is required. Intracellular targets for lipid mediators have been postulated for many years (1Fiore S. Ryeom S.W. Weller P.F. Serhan C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16168-16176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is only recently that we have seen the emergence of reports describing nuclear receptors for fatty acids and their derivatives (see Refs. 2Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar and 3Lemberger T. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 335-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar and references therein). Particular attention has focused on a group of ligand-activated transcription factors called peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs).1 The three PPAR isotypes (α, β/δ, and γ) form a distinct subclass of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily (4Dreyer C. Krey G. Keller H. Givel F. Helftenbein G. Wahli W. Cell. 1992; 68: 879-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). The functional complex is a heterodimer of PPAR and the retinoid X acid receptor (RXR) that binds to a consensus sequence in the promoter of target genes and can up-regulate transcription in the presence of a PPAR ligand. Although the PPAR target genes identified so far, are generally associated with lipid homeostasis, the extent of their involvement in biological processes related to disease are yet to be elucidated. In transient transfection experiments, PPARα activity can be induced by a range of structurally diverse compounds (see Ref. 5Devchand P.R. Wahli W. O'Malley B.W. Hormones and Signalling. 1. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1997: 236-265Google Scholar and references therein). Many of these natural and synthetic compounds are bona fide PPARα ligands (6Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar, 7Dowell P. Peterson V.J. Zabriskie T.M. Leid M. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 779-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Although it is now clear that PPARα is a nuclear receptor for various fatty acids (e.g. linoleic and arachidonic acid), eicosanoids (e.g. 8(S)-HETE and LTB4) and hypolipidemic drugs (e.g. fibrates and Wy14,643), we are only beginning to understand the functional relevance of these receptor-ligand interactions. Our knowledge of the biology of PPARα is still superficial but is increasing rapidly. Extensive analyses of PPARα knockout mice indicate that PPARα can be associated with many homeostatic functions of peroxisomes and also with response to various compounds termed peroxisome proliferators (for review, see Ref. 12Gonzalez F.J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 422: 109-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For example, wild-type mice respond to hypolipidemic drugs such as fibrates and Wy14,643; but the PPARα(−/−) mice display neither lowering of blood lipid levels nor the proliferation of peroxisomes in the liver (13Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar,14Peters J.M.

Consistent with this, PPARα(−/−) mice exhibit normal basal levels of hepatic fatty acid ω- and β-oxidation. However, they lack the ability to increase expression of these genes in response to various peroxisome proliferators (13Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar). In the liver, these inducible pathways serve not only to regulate normal dietary fatty acids but also as a detoxification or degradation process for xenobiotics and potent eicosanoid mediators, such as the chemoattractant leukotriene B4 (15Harper T.W. Garrity M.J. Murphy R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5414-5418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Jedlitschky G. Mayatepek E. Keppler D. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1993; 33: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). PPARα has also been evaluated for its ability to induce adipogenesis (17Brun R.P. Tontonoz P. Forman B.M. Ellis R. Chen J. Evans R.M. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 974-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). In vitro , NIH 3T3 fibroblasts can be retrovirally infected to express high levels of PPARα and then challenged with potent activators to promote lipid droplet accumulation. High levels of lipid accumulation can in turn potentiate fat cell differentiation, a process that presumably involves a pathway mediated by the adipogenic regulator, PPARγ. So far, two studies have reported a role for PPARα in inflammation. Recently, Staels et al. (18Staels B. Koenig W. Habib A. Merval R. Lebret M. Torra I.P. Delerive P. Fadel A. Chinetti G. Fruchart J.C. Najib J. Maclouf J. Tedgui A. Nature. 1998; 393: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar) have proposed that in vascular walls, PPARα has an anti-inflammatory action that is mediated via repression of NF-κB signaling. We have previously shown, in vivo , that PPARα has a role in inflammation control (6Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar, 19Serhan C.N. Nature. 1996; 384: 23-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Compared with wild-type mice, the PPARα(−/−) mouse exhibits a prolonged inflammatory response when challenged by the eicosanoid LTB4 and its precursor arachidonic acid, but not the phorbol ester 12-O -tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Based on the available data, a potential mechanism proposed for this anti-inflammatory role of PPARα is a negative feedback loop. LTB4 would effectively control its own degradation by initiating the up-regulation of the fatty acid oxidation pathways. This catabolic inactivation of the eicosanoid is facilitated by direct interaction and activation of PPARα, a nuclear receptor for LTB4 (K D of 60 and 90 nm,determined by two independent groups using fluorometric (20Lin Q. Ruuska S.E. Shaw N.S. Dong D. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and radioligand (6Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar) binding assays). Leukotriene B4 also binds to a cell surface receptor, BLTR (21Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Bray M.A. Doig M.V. Shipley M.E. Smith M.J. Nature. 1980; 286: 264-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). A full-length cDNA for BLTR has recently been isolated from human HL-60 leukemia cells and characterized (22Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). The predicted protein contains the classical seven membrane-spanning domains but shows little amino acid homology to other known proteins. The proinflammatory effects of LTB4 are thought to be triggered by high affinity binding to the BLTR on immune cells (K D = 0.15 nm). Analyses of downstream signaling pathways in stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells indicate that BLTR potentially couples to different G-proteins. At the mechanistic level, little is known about the LTB4signaling pathways. Elucidation of these pathways would be greatly facilitated by the use of chemical probes that could differentially target cell surface and nuclear LTB4 receptors. PPARα and BLTR are promising targets in therapeutic invention for lipid-related disorders. Indeed, the pharmaceutical industry has deployed considerable resources to the development of antagonists of BLTR as anti-inflammatory drugs and agonists of PPARα as lipid-lowering compounds. Here, we investigate some of these compounds to find useful probes for BLTR and PPARα function, the reasoning being that if PPARα and BLTR share a ligand (LTB4), then one would expect to find some overlap in recognition of other ligands. We report the effect of some BLTR effectors on transcriptional activation by the three PPAR subtypes. We then established whether the effects are mediated by direct interaction with the PPARs. Finally, we used NIH 3T3-mPPARα cells as a biological assay to evaluate the potential of these activators in the PPARα-associated activity of lipid accumulation. Transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation technique in HeLa cells, as described previously (6Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were incubated with indicated concentrations of test compound (ZK151657, ZK158252, ZK183838 (Schering), LTB4 (Cascade Biochemicals Ltd.), or Wy14,643 (Campro Scientific)) or solvent (Me2SO). Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assays were normalized using β-galactosidase activities (internal standard). The LBD fragments (shown in Fig. 2 A ) for mPPARα and mPPARβ were amplified by PCR from clones containing the full-length sequences, whereas mPPARγ fragment was isolated as aBam HI-Xba I fragment from the vector pSG5-mPPARγ-stop. The fragments were cloned in-frame intoBam HI site of either pGEX-1 (for mPPARα) or pGEX-5X-3 (for mPPARβ and mPPARγ). The GST-PPAR (LBD) fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL2 DE3 (pLysS) bacteria. Briefly, a freshly transformed colony was used to start a 2-ml innoculum (in log phase) for a 500-ml culture. After 12 h, cultures were diluted with 500 ml of medium and induced with either 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4–6 h (for mPPARβ and mPPARγ) or 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 9 h (for mPPARα). All cultures were grown at 30 °C in LB medium containing 17 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Bacteria pellets were stored at −70 °C as aliquots equivalent to 50 ml of culture. The CARLA was performed as described by Krey et al. (11Krey G. Braissant O. L'Horset F. Kalkhoven E. Perroud M. Parker M.G. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 779-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The above bacterial pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline A containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed by repeated freeze-thaw. The DNA and insoluble matter were removed by centrifugation. Fusion proteins were purified onto glutathione-Sepharose beads at 4 °C (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed three times in lysis buffer, and equilibrated in NETN buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 nm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 1% (w/v) of dry 2% milk powder prior to use in CARLA. The amount of protein used per reaction was 1 μg for mPPARα and 2–3 μg for mPPARβ and mPPARγ. Reactions were performed in NETN buffer supplemented with 1% (w/v) of dry 2% milk powder, and the first wash contained 0.5% milk powder. The exposure times for autoradiography was 12–24 h for mPPARα, and 1–4 h for mPPARβ and mPPARγ. Generation of virally infected stable NIH mPPARα cell lines and adipogenesis assays were performed as described by Brun et al. (17Brun R.P. Tontonoz P. Forman B.M. Ellis R. Chen J. Evans R.M. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 974-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). All test compounds were dissolved in Me2SO. Cells were used for either Oil Red O staining of neutral lipids or RNA isolation followed by Northern blot analysis of the aP2 message. The ligand-induced complex (LIC) assays were performed similar to Forman et al. (8Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar). Briefly, reaction volumes were 20 μl. The two proteins, baculovirus-expressed mRXRβ (0.4 μl) and in vitro translated mPPARα (0.7 μl), were incubated for 10 min on ice in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 3.5 μg of poly(dI-dC). After addition of test compounds (eicosanoids, drugs, or solvent control) and a 30-min incubation on ice, 1 ng of radiolabeled probe (the PPAR response element consensus site) was added, and the reaction was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Complexes were resolved on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE. Gels were dried, and results were visualized by autoradiography. LTB4 acts as a potent chemoattractant for leukocytes (23Samuelsson B. Dahlen S.E. Lindgren J.A. Rouzer C.A. Serhan C.N. Science. 1987; 237: 1171-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1960) Google Scholar). This process involves binding and activation of the LTB4 to the cell surface receptor, BLTR (22Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Based on this biological activity, one can evaluate effectors of BLTR by their ability to modulate LTB4-induced neutrophil chemotaxis. Compounds that enhance chemotaxis are classified as BLTR agonists, and those that inhibit chemotaxis are classified as antagonists. In this study, we used four BLTR effectors (Ref. 24Glesen C. Buchmann B. Frohlich W. Ekerdt R. Heindl J. Skuballa W. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1998; 290: 51Google Scholar and TableI): two agonists (LTB4 itself and ZK151657) and two antagonists (ZK158252 and ZK183838). For convenience, the synthetic compounds ZK151657, ZK158252 and ZK183838 are referred to as BLTR agonist 1 (BAg1), BLTR antagonist 1 (BAntag1), and BAntag2, respectively.Table IEffect of chemical probes on BLTR functionBLTRChemotactic coefficient1-aInduction by agonists shown as EC50; inhibition by antagonists shown as K B.mAgonistsLTB43.4 × 10−9ZK 151 657 (BAg1)2.0 × 10−8AntagonistsZK 158 252 (BAntag1)2.1 × 10−8ZK 183 838 (BAntag2)7.1 × 10−8Chemotaxis of human PMNs in a modified Boyden chamber assay (24Glesen C.

Res. 1998; 290: 51Google Scholar). The effects of the compounds on the three PPAR isotypes were evaluated by transient transfection experiments. In this system, HeLa cells are co-transfected with three constructs: a PPAR expression vector, a reporter construct containing the CAT gene driven by a PPAR-responsive promoter element (see Fig.1 A ), and a vector that constitutively expresses β-galactosidase to standardize between different samples. After exposure to test compounds for 48 h, cells were harvested and lysed, and the CAT enzymatic activity per β-galactosidase unit was measured. A test compound that increases standardized CAT activity in a PPAR-dependent manner was classified as a PPAR activator. We first determined the effect of 10 μm concentrations of the synthetic compounds on the three isotypes of mouse PPARs (mPPARs, see Fig. 1 B ). Transfection results of empty pSG5 expression vector indicate that in the absence of exogenous PPAR, none of the compounds induced a positive response from the reporter construct. However, when the different mPPARs were cotransfected, isotype-specific responses to the synthetic compounds were observed. BAg1 and BAntag1 are activators that are selective for mPPARα. At a 10 μm concentration, BAg1 also induced a small response in the presence of mPPARβ. The third compound, BAntag2, did not induce mPPAR activity. Interestingly, mPPARγ activity was not induced by these compounds. Similar activation profiles were observed from PPARα from other species (Xenopus and human) (data not shown). The level of mPPARα activation observed with 10 μm of BAg1 and BAntag1 was 40–50% that of the standard activator and ligand Wy14,643. This could reflect either that higher doses of the compounds are required for maximal activation or that the compounds are partial agonists. An activation profile showing the mPPARα response in the presence of increasing amounts of compound, helps to differentiate between the two scenarios (Fig. 1 C ). In these transient transfection assays, BAg1 and BAntag1 are partial agonists with equal efficacy; at 10 μm, they gave quantitatively indistinguishable responses. Log dose curves show that BAg1 (EC50 = 0.5 μm) is more potent than BAntag1 (EC50 = 8 μm) and LTB4(EC50 > 10 μm). The transient transfection assays report the activity of PPARs when cells are challenged with a given compound. This increased transcriptional activity could conceivably be a consequence of different mechanisms: a direct interaction of the compound with the nuclear receptor, an indirect mechanism of activation, such as production of a metabolite, or a combination of both. We used a semifunctional assay to evaluate whether the compounds can directly bind to the PPARs and render them functionally active. Transcriptional activation by nuclear hormone receptors can be mediated by a class of proteins called co-activators (25Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). The current model indicates that the binding of a ligand to the nuclear hormone receptor induces a conformational change in the ligand binding domain (LBD) that allows interaction with the co-activator. For example, the steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1) binds to xPPARα in the presence of its ligand Wy14,643 but not in the presence of a nonligand such as β-estradiol. This type of semifunctional assay (CARLA, see Fig.2 A ), has been successfully exploited to identify different fatty acids, eicosanoids, and hypolipidemic agents as ligands for PPARs (11Krey G. Braissant O. L'Horset F. Kalkhoven E. Perroud M. Parker M.G. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 779-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Studies have indicated that although PPAR response to natural compounds, such as fatty acids and eicosanoids, is conserved between species, response to xenobiotics can be species-specific (10Keller H. Devchand P.R. Perroud M. Wahli W. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 651-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For this reason, GST fusion proteins with the different mouse PPAR LBDs were constructed (Fig. 2, B and C ). Expression of soluble fusion protein of the mouse PPARα isotype was not as efficient as for PPARβ and PPARγ. However, all proteins were active, as confirmed by CARLA on known ligands (Fig.2 D ). CARLA was used to evaluate the three BLTR effectors as ligands of mPPARs (Fig. 3). At 10 μmconcentrations, BAg1 and BAntag1 were ligands of mPPARα, but BAntag2 was not. Similar profiles were obtained with the Xenopus PPARα (data not shown). BAg1, the weak activator of mPPARβ in transfection experiments, also bound to mPPARβ. None of the compounds induced SRC-1 interaction with PPARγ. The function of PPARγ as a master gene in adipogenesis was first demonstrated by its ability to induce the adipogenic program in fibroblastic cells (for review, see Ref. 26Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 377-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). Different strains of NIH 3T3 cells do not induce lipid accumulation or expression of adipocyte markers when cultured under conditions permissive for adipogenesis. However, when PPARγ is ectopically expressed in these cells using a retroviral system, one can stimulate both the accumulation of lipid droplets and gene expression of adipocyte markers, such as the fatty acid-binding protein aP2 (27Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar). Similar functional evaluation of the PPARα and PPARβ isotypes have highlighted some important mechanistic differences between members of the PPAR family (17Brun R.P. Tontonoz P. Forman B.M. Ellis R. Chen J. Evans R.M. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 974-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). For instance, the PPARα isotype can prime fibroblastic cells to accumulate lipid droplets and also turn on the adipocyte markers. However, this PPARα-mediated process seems to be distinct from that of PPARγ, and moreover is sensitive to the efficacy of the PPARα activator. We used this PPARα functional assay to evaluate the biological potency of our BLTR effectors. NIH PPARα stable cell lines were created by transduction of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts with packaged pBABE-mPPARα retroviral vector. Cells were cultured under conditions that permit adipogenesis and challenged with the various compounds. The effects of the compounds on cells were analyzed by staining of neutral lipids with Oil Red O or Northern blot analyses of the transcript for adipocyte marker, aP2 . Consistent with published data (17Brun R.P. Tontonoz P. Forman B.M. Ellis R. Chen J. Evans R.M. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 974-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), NIH PPARα cells treated with Me2SO solvent scored negative for lipid accumulation, whereas those treated with the mPPARα activator Wy14,643 accumulated lipid to a reasonable extent (Fig.4 A ). In comparison to these standards, one can rank the potency of the BLTR effectors. Surprisingly, even though BAg1 is a partial agonist in transient transfection assays, it is a more potent inducer of PPARα-mediated lipid accumulation than Wy14,643. The staining pattern with BAntag1 was positive, but less efficient than the standard Wy14,643. BAntag2 scored negative in this assay. Depending on their potency in lipid accumulation, activators of PPARα can also trigger the adipogenic program in NIH PPARα cells (17Brun R.P. Tontonoz P. Forman B.M. Ellis R. Chen J. Evans R.M. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 974-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). For instance, Wy14,643 will induce expression of adipogenic genes, whereas a weaker mPPARα activator will not. Analyses of NIH mPPARα cells treated with BLTR effectors were consistent with this (Fig.4 B ). The weak inducer of lipid accumulation (BAntag1) did not significantly increase aP2 mRNA, whereas BAg1, the most potent inducer of lipid accumulation, also induced expression of this adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein. The adipogenesis assay result with LTB4 as inducer (Fig. 4 A ) was surprising, as one would expect that a ligand with reported K Dvalues of 60 and 90 nm as estimated by radioligand and fluorescence-based assays (6Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar, 20Lin Q. Ruuska S.E. Shaw N.S. Dong D. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) would induce lipid accumulation to a significant level at 10 μm concentrations. This lack of response could be due to an inefficient uptake of this eicosanoid, although this is probably not the main reason because the two synthetic analogues (BAg1 and BAntag1) were effective in the assay. An alternate explanation is that LTB4 is unstable under these assay conditions. We further explored this possibility. The chemical and metabolic stability of LTB4 (see Fig.5) can be improved significantly by either stabilizing the reactive triene system (BAg1) or by introducing a trifluoromethyl group at the ω-position (CF3-LTB4, Fig.6 A and Ref. 28Tanaka Y.

If it is the instability of LTB4 that hinders response in the assays, then modification of the molecule by either of the two methods should improve the outcome.Figure 6Stabilizing LTB 4 to ω-oxidation.

G protein-coupled receptor thyrotropin-releasing hormone TRH receptor green fluorescent protein G protein-coupled receptor kinase polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phosphate-buffered saline vesicular stomatitis virus Many members of the seven transmembrane element, G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)1 superfamily undergo rapid desensitization following exposure to agonist ligands (1Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar,2Lohse M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). In many circumstances, a key contribution to such desensitization is produced by phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues in the carboxyl-terminal tail of the GPCR mediated by members of the family of G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) (3Inglese J. Freedman N.J. Koch W. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23735-23738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Such phosphorylation, although integral to the process, is not the defining aspect that results in interference in the efficiency of interactions between GPCRs and G proteins. This is provided by the binding of members of the arrestin family to the phosphorylated GPCRs (5Ferguson S.G.G. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 420-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 6Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This process may also be integral to the internalization of GPCRs via clathrin-coated pits as the nonvisual arrestins interact with clathrin (7Goodman Jr, O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). Although this process has been widely examined for rhodopsin, the GPCR of the visual system, and the β2-adrenoreceptor, in the majority of other studies, agonist-dependent GPCR phosphorylation following either addition of a recombinant GRK or transient expression of an appropriate cDNA is taken as an end point, and the direct contribution of an arrestin is hypothesized rather than being demonstrated directly. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is a hypothalamic tripeptide intimately involved in controlling the production of thyrotropin and prolactin from the anterior pituitary (8Gershengorn M.C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 175-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 9Hinkle P.M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 7: 370-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). At least in the rat, TRH functions via binding to a small group of GPCRs, the first cloned of which (10Sellar R.E. Taylor P.L. Lamb R.F. Zabavnik J. Anderson L. Eidne K.A. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 10: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) is now known as TRH receptor-1 (TRHR-1). By selectively interacting with Gq and G11, this GPCR causes activation of phospholipase Cβ1 and the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (11Hsieh K.P. Martin T.F.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1673-1681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Aragay A.M. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24983-24988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lee T.W.

Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 646-655PubMed Google Scholar). As with many other GPCRs, there has been great interest in mechanisms of regulation of the TRH receptors (15Anderson L. Alexander C.L. Faccenda E. Eidne K.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 16Yu R. Hinkle P.M. J. Biol.

Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 16Yu R. Hinkle P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28301-28307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the contribution of GRKs or arrestins to this process have not been examined in detail. Barak et al . (19Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) have recently provided evidence for the interaction of β-arrestin-2 with the β2-adrenoreceptor and the dopamine1A receptor by examining the movement of a β-arrestin-2-GFP fusion construct to the plasma membrane in response to agonist in cells transiently co-transfected with β-arrestin-2-GFP and the appropriate GPCR. Herein, we expand this strategy following construction of a β-arrestin-1-GFP fusion protein. Transient transfection of this construct into HEK293 cells stably expressing the long isoform of the rat TRHR-1 (20Kim G.D. Carr I.C. Anderson L.A. Zabavnik J. Eidne K.A. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19933-19940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) results in an agonist and time-dependent translocation of β-arrestin-1-GFP to the plasma membrane. Visualization of this process by confocal microscopy further allowed subsequent detection of the internalization of β-arrestin-1-GFP into discrete, intracellular vesicles. To further explore potential co-localization of the GPCR and β-arrestin-1 in response to agonist stimulation, HEK293 clones stably expressing either β-arrestin-1-GFP or TRHR-1-GFP were generated. Transient introduction of either β-arrestin-1 or an epitope-tagged form of TRHR-1 into appropriate cell lines allowed demonstration of TRH-induced co-localization of β-arrestin-1 and TRHR-1 in intracellular vesicles only in cells that had become dually transfected with a GPCR and an arrestin construct. All materials for tissue culture were supplied by Life Technologies, Inc. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Cruachem Ltd. (Glasgow, United Kingdom). Production and subcloning of the β-arrestin-1-GFP fusion protein was performed in two separate steps. In the first step the coding sequence of a modified form of GFP (21Zernicka-Goetz M. Pines J. McLean Hunter S. Dixon J.P.C. Siemering K.R. Haseloff J. Evans M.J. Development. 1997; 124: 1133-1137PubMed Google Scholar) was altered by PCR amplification. Using the amino-terminal primer 5′-CCGCTCGAGAGTAAAGGAGAAGAACTTTTCAC-3′, an Xho I restriction site (underlined) was introduced adjacent to the sequence of codon 2 of GFP. The ATG initiator codon was removed. Using the carboxyl-terminal primer 5′-TGCTCTAGATTATTTGTATAGTTCATCCATGCC-3′, an Xba I restriction site (underlined) was introduced following the stop codon. The amplified fragment of GFP digested with Xho I andXba I was ligated into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen) digested with Xho I and Xba I. To obtain the β-arrestin-1-GFP fusion protein, the coding sequence of β-arrestin-1 (22Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR. Using the amino-terminal primer 5′-AAAAAAGCTTTCTACCATGGGCGACAAAGGGACAC-3′, aHin dIII restriction site (underlined) and a partial Kozak site were introduced in front of the initiator Met of β-arrestin-1. Using the carboxyl-terminal primer 5′-AACTCGAGTCTGTTGTTGAGGTGTGGAGAGC-3′, an Xho I restriction site (underlined) was introduced just in front of the stop codon of β-arrestin-1. Finally, the GFP construct in pcDNA3 was digested with Xho I and Hin dIII and was ligated together with the PCR product of the β-arrestin-1 amplification, which was digested with Hin dIII and Xho I. The open reading frame so produced represents the coding sequence of β-arrestin-1-GFP. This construct was fully sequenced prior to its expression and analysis. Functionality of the β-arrestin-1-GFP was characterized by binding experiments with rhodopsin (see below). HEK293 cells and clone E2M11 (14Svoboda P. Kim G.D. Grassie M.A. Eidne K.A. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 646-655PubMed Google Scholar) cells were maintained in minimum essential medium (Sigma), supplemented with 0.292 g/literl-glutamine, and 10% newborn calf serum at 37 °C. Cells were grown to 60–80% confluency prior to transient transfection. Transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To generate cell lines stably expressing β-arrestin-1-GFP or VSV-TRHR-1-GFP, 2 days after transfection cells were seeded/diluted and maintained in minimum essential medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Medium was replaced every 3 days with minimum essential medium containing 1 mg/ml Geneticin. Clonal expression was examined initially by fluorescence microscopy, and clones for further study were selected and expanded. Plasma membrane-containing P2 particulate fractions were prepared from cell pastes that had been stored at −80 °C after harvesting. Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5 (Buffer A), and rupture of the cells was achieved with 50 strokes of a hand-held Teflon/glass homogenizer followed by passage (10 times) through a 25-gauge needle. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min in an IEC Micromax RF centrifuge to pellet the nuclei and unbroken cells, and P2 particulate fractions were then recovered by centrifugation of the supernatant at 200,000 ×g for 30 min in a Beckman TL 100 benchtop ultracentrifuge using a Beckman TLA 100.2 rotor. P2 particulate fractions were resuspended in Buffer A and stored at −80 °C until required. Protein concentrations were determined with the bicinchonic acid (BCA) procedure (23Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goebe N.M. Olsen B.J. Klenick D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 75-85Crossref Scopus (18489) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Where appropriate, sample concentration was performed according to the method of Bensadoun and Weinstein (24Bensadoun A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2732) Google Scholar). All protein samples were solubilized prior to gel loading by heating to 95 °C for 5 min in sample buffer (0.06m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 50 mmdithiothreitol, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 0.002% (w/v) bromphenol blue). Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on vertical slab gels (12 cm × 14 cm × 1.5 mm) containing a fixed percentage of polyacrylamide (10% (w/v)) using the buffer system of Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206281) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was carried out at either 40 mA per gel constant current for 3 to 4 h, or 7.5 mA per gel constant current overnight in Tris-glycine buffer comprising 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.9, 0.192 m glycine, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS. SDS-PAGE-separated proteins were electroblotted to polyvinylidene fluoride (NEN Life Science Products) membrane according to the manufacturer's instructions at 140 mA constant current for 90 min at 25 °C using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech semidry electrophoretic transfer unit. Transferred proteins were visualized by staining the membrane in 0.1% (w/v) Ponceau S, 3% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid for 30 s to 3 min and destaining with deionized water. After removing the lane of markers, the blots were incubated in PBS (0.14 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4and 8.1 mm Na2HPO4) containing 0.3% (v/v) Tween-20 (PBS-T), and 5% (w/v) milk powder (Marvel) for 1 h in order to block binding sites on the membrane. Blots were incubated with the primary antibody (1:2000 to 1:10,000) for 1 h. Following incubation with primary antibody the blot was washed six times for 10 min each in PBS-T. The blots were subsequently incubated for 1 h with either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or sheep anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:1,000 dilution) and then washed for 6 × 10 min with PBS-T. Cross-reacting polypeptides were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescent system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were observed using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 100) using a Zeiss Plan-Apo 63 × 1.40 NA oil immersion objective, pinhole of 35, and electronic zoom 1 or 3. The GFP was exited using a 488 nm argon/krypton laser and detected with 515–540 nm band pass filter. The images were manipulated with Zeiss LSM or MetaMorph software. Two different protocols for preparation of cells were used. When examining the time course of internalization, short time exposures to TRH were used. Cells were grown on glass coverslips and mounted on the imaging chamber. Cells were maintained in KRH buffer, and temperature was maintained at 37 °C. In other studies, fixed cells were used. Cells on glass coverslips were washed with PBS and fixed for 20 min at room temperature using 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS/5% sucrose, pH 7.2. After one wash with PBS, coverslips were mounted on microscope slides with 40% glycerol in PBS. After relevant TRH treatments, cells were prepared and fixed. If required, cell membranes were permeabilized with 0.4% (w/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 3 min at room temperature and washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% goat serum and 0.2% gelatin (PBSGG) for 5 min at room temperature and then three times in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies; anti-β-arrestin-1 (Transduction Laboratories) or anti-VSV (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was diluted to a final concentration of 1:400 (1–4 μg/ml) in PBSGG and added to the coverslips for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were subsequently washed three times with PBSGG for 5 min and then three times in PBS for 5 min. An Alexa™ 594-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) diluted 1:200 was added to the coverslips for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were then washed with PBSGG and PBS as above and mounted onto microscope slides with 40% glycerol in PBS. Microscope slides were stored in the dark prior to confocal microscope analysis. The Alexa™ 594 label was excited using a 543 nm argon/krypton laser and detected with a 590 nm long pass filter. Appropriate controls were routinely performed to exclude bleed-through from either red or green signals, potentially contributing to identified overlap of the signals. Bovine β-arrestin-1 and β-arrestin-1-GFP binding assays to either light exposed or dark adapted rhodopsin were performed according to the method described in Söhlemann et al . (26Söhlemann P. Hekman M. Puzicha M. Buchan C. Lohse M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 464-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A PCR-based strategy was used to ligate together a cDNA encoding β-arrestin-1 and a humanized and thermostabilized form of the green fluorescent protein from Aequorea victoria with enhanced fluorescence characteristics (21Zernicka-Goetz M. Pines J. McLean Hunter S. Dixon J.P.C. Siemering K.R. Haseloff J. Evans M.J. Development. 1997; 124: 1133-1137PubMed Google Scholar) to generate β-arrestin-1-GFP (Fig. 1). Transient expression of either β-arrestin-1-GFP or the isolated GFP was achieved in HEK293 cells following transfection with the appropriate cDNA species. Homogenization of the cells followed by a crude separation into particulate and supernatant fractions, resolution by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting with an antibody to GFP resulted in detection of the 27-kDa GFP as a cytosolic protein (Fig.2). A polypeptide of some 82 kDa was detected in the supernatant fraction of cells transfected to express β-arrestin-1-GFP with the anti-GFP antibody. Such a protein was not detected in the cells transfected with the GFP cDNA. A polypeptide of the same size was also detected in the soluble fraction only of cells transiently transfected with β-arrestin-1-GFP by immunoblotting with an antibody to β-arrestin-1 (Fig. 2).Figure 2β-Arrestin-1-GFP and GFP are soluble proteins following transient expression into HEK293 cells.

The cells were homogenized and centrifuged to generate particulate (lanes 1, 3, and5 ) and supernatant (lanes 2, 4, and 6 ) fractions. These fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using antibodies to GFP. Right panel, HEK293 cells were either mock-transfected (lane 1 ) or transiently transfected with either GFP (lane 2 ) or β-arrestin-1-GFP (lane 3 ).

Both polypeptides interacted with rhodopsin in a manner that was entirely dependent upon light (Fig.3). We have previously established clone E2M11, which stably expresses the long isoform of the rat TRHR-1 and elevated levels of its cognate G protein G11α, by consecutive transfections of HEK293 cells with cDNAs encoding the receptor and murine G11α (14Svoboda P.

Transient transfection of these cells with the GFP cDNA resulted in visualization of GFP in confocal microscopy as an evenly distributed cytoplasmic fluorescence. The distribution of GFP was not altered by addition of TRH (10 μm) to the cells for various time periods between 1 and 30 min (data not shown). Transient transfection of the β-arrestin-1-GFP cDNA into clone E2M11 cells also resulted in a uniform cytoplasmic distribution of fluorescence monitored in the confocal microscope (Fig.4 a ). However, following addition of TRH (10 μm), real time visualization of β-arrestin-1-GFP allowed detection of the transfer of a substantial fraction of the cellular fluorescence to the plasma membrane within 10 min (Fig. 4 b ). In many cells, this bulk transfer of β-arrestin-1-GFP fluorescence to the plasma membrane was virtually complete (Fig. 4). No effect of TRH was observed on the distribution of β-arrestin-1-GFP following transient expression of the cDNA construct into HEK293 cells that did not express TRHR-1 (data not shown). Co-expression of GRK2 into E2M11 cells along with β-arrestin-1-GFP increased the kinetics of movement of β-arrestin-1-GFP to the plasma membrane in response to TRH (data not shown), and on this basis, subsequent experiments routinely employed co-expression of GRK2. Following co-expression of GRK2 with β-arrestin-1-GFP into clone E2M11 fields of intact cells were visualized for an extended period before and after addition of TRH (Fig.5). Translocation of β-arrestin-1-GFP to the plasma membrane could be observed to be proceeding as rapidly (within 30 s) as measurement could be initiated (compare the cells in the center of the field of view in Fig. 5, a andb ). At early time points, the plasma membrane distribution of the recruited β-arrestin-1-GFP was essentially homogenous, as we have previously noted for the distribution of a TRHR-1-GFP fusion protein stably expressed in HEK293 cells (27Drmota T. Gould G.W. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24000-24008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Transfer of β-arrestin-1-GFP to the plasma membrane was more pronounced at time points between 0.5 and 2 min, and within this time frame, distinct, punctate foci of β-arrestin-1-GFP began to appear at sites around the plasma membrane (Fig. 5 c ) in many of the cells. At time points beyond 10 min, clear intracellular, punctate spots of β-arrestin-1-GFP were visible in many cells. This pattern was maintained over the longest time point monitored (30 min) (Fig.5 d ). Because we were unable to concurrently monitor the distribution of both β-arrestin-1-GFP and TRHR-1 in this system, β-arrestin-1-GFP was stably expressed in HEK293 cells, and a number of distinct clones were isolated. Expression of β-arrestin-1-GFP could be monitored in the confocal microscope in all of the cells as evenly distributed cytoplasmic fluorescence (Fig.6 A ). These cells were transiently transfected with an amino-terminally VSV-epitope tagged form of TRHR-1, which we have previously constructed and characterized (27Drmota T. Gould G.W. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24000-24008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cell fixation with permeabilization and immunostaining with an anti-VSV antibody was followed by an AlexaTM 594-labeled goat, anti-mouse secondary antibody permitted detection of cells expressing VSV-TRHR-1 (Fig. 6 B ). As with many transient transfections of cDNA species encoding GPCRs, not all the expressed protein was effectively delivered to the plasma membrane. Clear evidence for appropriate plasma membrane delivery of a fraction of VSV-TRHR-1 in such transient transfections was obtained by fixing the cells without permeabilization followed by immunocytochemical detection with the anti-VSV antibody. Now only the plasma membrane located GPCR could be recorded (see later). Merging of the red and green signals in Fig. 6, A and B, indicated a lack of co-localization of VSV-TRHR-1 and β-arrestin-1-GFP (Fig.6 C ). Following addition of TRH for 30 min, the cells expressing VSV-TRHR-1 showed distinct intracellular punctate relocalization of the GPCR (Fig. 6 E ). Punctate, intracellular bright patches of β-arrestin-1-GFP fluorescence could also be observed (Fig. 6 D ). These were only present in the cells that were immunopositive for the presence of VSV-TRHR-1 (Fig.6 E ), and merging of the signals from the two proteins indicated a high degree of co-localization (Fig. 6 F ). To ascertain that such co-localization was seen routinely in response to TRH, the same experimental protocol was repeated with three distinct clones stably expressing β-arrestin-1-GFP. Equivalent results were obtained in all cases (data not shown). We then assessed whether short term treatment with TRH of β-arrestin-1-GFP-expressing cells that had been transiently transfected with VSV-TRHR-1 would result in plasma membrane co-localization of the two proteins. Cells treated with or without TRH for between 20 s and 5 min were examined following cell fixation without permeabilization. With or without TRH treatment, over these time periods cells, transiently expressing VSV-TRHR-1 were detected by the presence of red plasma membrane defined immunoreactivity following immunocytochemistry with the anti-VSV antibody (Fig.7, B and E ). Without treatment with TRH, VSV-TRHR-1 and β-arrestin-1-GFP were clearly separated (Fig. 7, A–C ). However, with TRH treatment, clear plasma concentration of β-arrestin-1-GFP could be observed (Fig. 7 D ). This occurred only in cells expressing VSV-TRHR-1 and merging of the red and green signals indicated obvious overlap of distribution of VSV-TRHR-1 and β-arrestin-1-GFP (Fig.7 F ). To examine whether equivalent co-localization could be achieved by reversal of the above strategy, a clone stably expressing VSV-TRHR-1 with GFP linked to the carboxyl-terminal tail of the GPCR was established (27Drmota T. Gould G.W. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24000-24008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). VSV-TRHR-1-GFP was predominantly plasma membrane targeted in naive cells (27Drmota T. Gould G.W. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24000-24008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) (Fig.8 A ). This clone was transiently transfected with cDNA encoding β-arrestin-1 and, following fixation and cell permeabilization, stained with an anti-β-arrestin-1 antibody followed by an AlexaTM594-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. Cells successfully transfected with β-arrestin-1 displayed an essentially homogenous cytoplasmic distribution of the protein (Fig. 8 B ) that was entirely distinct from the distribution of VSV-TRHR-1-GFP (Fig.8 C ). Addition of TRH for 30 min resulted in the internalization of most of the VSV-TRHR-1-GFP (Fig. 8 D ), as we have reported previously (27Drmota T. Gould G.W. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24000-24008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), even in cells that were not immunostained positive for β-arrestin-1. Although the bulk movement of the β-arrestin-1 population in immunopositive cells was not as profound and complete as in cells of clone E2M11, which express very high levels of TRHR-1 (14Svoboda P. Kim G.D. Grassie M.A. Eidne K.A. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 646-655PubMed Google Scholar), intracellular, vesicular clustering of a proportion of the expressed β-arrestin-1 was observed (Fig.8 E ). Merging of the signals again confirmed co-localization of VSV-TRHR-1-GFP in vesicles occupied by β-arrestin-1 immunoreactivity (Fig. 8 F ). Modified forms of the GFP from A. victoria with enhanced fluorescence characteristics have become widely used to monitor gene expression (28Kakinoki Y. Somers J. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32308-32314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 29Venkateswarlu K. Oatey P.B. Tavare J.M. Cullen P.J. Curr.

Metabol. 1998; 9: 13-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), details of agonist-induced internalization have been elucidated following expression of these proteins with forms of GFP attached to their carboxyl terminus. Very recently, Barak et al . (19Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) have extended this idea to examine the cellular redistribution of a β-arrestin-2-GFP construct from cytosol to plasma membrane in an agonist-dependent manner following transient co-expression of β-arrestin-2-GFP and a range of GPCRs. As members of the arrestin family bind to GPCRs that have been phosphorylated by one or more members of the GRK family as part of the phenomenon of agonist-dependent homologous desensitization, the studies by Barak et al . (19Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) presumably require both agonist occupancy of the GPCR and its subsequent phosphorylation. Support for this concept was derived from studies that demonstrated enhanced movement of the β-arrestin-2-GFP construct following co-expression with GRK2 (19Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In the current study, we extended this approach to using a GFP fusion protein with β-arrestin-1 and to introducing this construct into a cell stably expressing high levels of the long isoform of the rat TRHR-1 (14Svoboda P. Kim G.D. Grassie M.A. Eidne K.A. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 646-655PubMed Google Scholar). Transient introduction of β-arrestin-1-GFP and monitoring of its intrinsic fluorescence in single cells and patches of cells grown on coverslips indicated the protein to be uniformly distributed within the cytoplasmic space, to be excluded from the nucleus, and to show no obvious plasma membrane concentration. (Fig.4 a ). Simple partitioning of cells expressing the construct after homogenization into particulate and supernatant fractions confirmed the protein to be cytosolic (Fig. 2). Addition of TRH produced a substantive redistribution of β-arrestin-1-GFP from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, which could be monitored in intact cells and in real time. Even without co-expression of excess GRK, this effect was dramatic (Fig. 4 b ). However, the co-expression of GRK2 appeared to shorten the kinetics of agonist-induced translocation of β-arrestin-1-GFP (data not shown). The basis for the translocation of β-arrestin-1-GFP to the plasma membrane remains unclear, as in many cells (see Figs. 4 and 5) virtually the entire cellular content of β-arrestin-1-GFP was mobilized and redistributed. As noted also by Barak et al . (19Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) for β-arrestin-2-GFP, there did not appear to be a specific pool(s) of β-arrestin-1-GFP, closely apposed to the membrane, for example, which responded upon agonist addition. However, it is worth noting that the degree of effect varied between cells, even between those imaged in the same field during the same time period (see Fig. 5for example). Two obvious possibilities may underlie such observations. Although clone E2M11 cells are a stable clone expressing TRHR-1, it would not be unusual for individual cells within the population to express the GPCR to differing levels. Secondly, to see the most effective bulk transfer of β-arrestin-1-GFP to the membrane in response to TRH, the cells transiently transfected with this construct must express it to sufficient levels to have high enough fluorescence for effective monitoring but not to such high levels that only a small fraction of the expressed protein is attracted/redistributed to the membrane. Each of these aspects can be observed in the field of cells visualized over the time course displayed in Fig. 5. Following stable expression of a TRHR-1-GFP construct in HEK293 cells, we have noted that in the absence of agonist, the plasma membrane distribution of this protein is entirely even around the plasma membrane (27Drmota T. Gould G.W. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24000-24008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As such, it was not surprising that upon addition of TRH to clone E2M11, cells transiently transfected to express β-arrestin-1-GFP the protein moved to the plasma membrane with an equally homogeneous distribution, at least over short time spans (Figs.4 and 5). Using the stably expressed TRHR-1-GFP construct we have previously examined the ability of TRH to cause internalization of the GPCR (27Drmota T. Gould G.W. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24000-24008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We have noted a rapid agonist-induced internalization that proceeds via concentration into clathrin-coated vesicles. Following transfer of β-arrestin-1-GFP to the plasma membrane in these studies further examination of this process demonstrated the appearance of distinct plasma membrane-delineated, punctate spots of β-arrestin-1-GFP fluorescence (Fig. 5). Subsequently, internalized, punctate spots of β-arrestin-1-GFP were observed (Fig. 5). These could only be observed in cells in which virtually all of the expressed β-arrestin-1-GFP had previously been translocated to the plasma membrane, because in other cells, such internalization would be masked by the fluorescence from the remaining cytosolic construct. Although the data of Fig. 5 represent the first clear visualization of a β-arrestin becoming internalized in response to agonist activation of a GPCR, transient introduction of β-arrestin-1-GFP into clone E2M11 cells did not allow direct monitoring of potential co-internalization of β-arrestin-1-GFP and TRHR-1. Schematic representations of the internalization of GPCRs via clathrin-coated vesicles usually indicate the co-internalization of the arrestin (Fig.9), presumably owing to the known capacity of these proteins to interact with clathrin (6Goodman Jr., O.B.

J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15011-15016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). To address this issue directly we generated clones of HEK293 cells stably expressing β-arrestin-1-GFP. A VSV-epitope tagged form of TRHR-1, which we have previously shown to bind TRH normally and to effectively cause activation of phosphoinositidase C in response to TRH (27Drmota T. Gould G.W. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24000-24008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), was subsequently transiently introduced. The green autofluorescence corresponding to β-arrestin-1-GFP was evenly distributed in the cytoplasm of all cells of the clone, and immunological detection of VSV-TRHR-1 allowed identification of individual cells in a field that were expressing the GPCR. The distribution of these proteins did not overlap in unstimulated cells (Fig. 6). However, following exposure to TRH (10 μm) for 30 min, both the GPCR and a significant amount of β-arrestin-1-GFP became internalized into punctate, intracellular vesicles. Merging of the signals indicated the location of these vesicles to overlap strongly. Interestingly, even without immunological detection of the GPCR, it was clear that intracellular punctate concentration of β-arrestin-1-GFP occurred in response to TRH only in a fraction of the cells (Fig. 6 D ). Immunolocalization of VSV-TRHR-1 (Fig. 6 E ) confirmed that these were the cells that were expressing the GPCR. Such studies provided the first direct evidence for co-internalization of a GPCR and β-arrestin-1-GFP. To extend this analysis, we generated a clone of HEK293 cells stably expressing a carboxyl-terminally GFP-tagged form of VSV-TRHR-1 (27Drmota T. Gould G.W. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24000-24008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and transiently introduced β-arrestin-1 (Fig. 8) into these cells. Now autofluorescent detection of the GPCR construct and immunological detection of β-arrestin-1 again demonstrated entirely separate locations of these proteins in unstimulated cells. Following TRH treatment (10 μm, 30 min), intracellular co-localization of the GPCR and β-arrestin-1 was again observed in cells co-expressing the two proteins. Not all of the immunologically detected β-arrestin-1 was transferred into these vesicles, and this is likely to relate to the levels of expression achieved. More interestingly, VSV-TRHR-1-GFP was internalized in response to TRH in cells in which β-arrestin-1 was not transiently introduced. This may reflect either the expression of low levels of endogenous β-arrestin-1 in these cells, although we did not detect significant levels of this protein by immunoblotting the cytosolic fraction of untransfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 2), or the contribution of related proteins, such as β-arrestin-2, which would not be identified by the antiserum used. Although previous studies have demonstrated rapid desensitization of the TRHR-1 in response to agonist, the detailed mechanism(s) responsible have not been elucidated. The current studies demonstrate both the capacity of TRHR-1 to interact with β-arrestin-1 and thus, by extension, the likely phosphorylation of TRHR-1 by a GRK. However, it should be noted that previous studies on the β2-adrenoreceptor have demonstrated that overexpression of GRK2 can allow a mutant form of this GPCR, which is a poor substrate for GRK-mediated phosphorylation, to attract β-arrestin-2-GFP to the cell membrane (19Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). As such, it may be possible to encourage non-physiologically relevant GRK-mediated phosphorylation of a GPCR when using such transient transfection protocols. We did, however, perform a number of important controls in the present studies. TRH-mediated translocation of β-arrestin-1-GFP did not occur in cells lacking TRHR-1, and expression of GFP alone did not result in TRH-mediated movement of this protein in E2M11 cells. These studies provide a novel, real time examination of the role of β-arrestin-1 and demonstrate that TRHR-1 is subject to rapid, agonist-induced interaction with β-arrestin-1 with their subsequent co-internalization. The usefulness of GFP-tagged signaling polypeptides suggests that their use will grow rapidly in examination of the dynamics of cell signaling processes.

Extensive mutational analysis and receptor three-dimensional molecular modeling have led to valuable information concerning “small ligand” and peptide/protein ligand receptor-binding sites (for review, see Refs. 1Strader C.D.

In 1995, we published the mapping of arginine-vasopressin (AVP)1-binding site in the V1a receptor subtype and described a major localization within transmembrane regions (TMR) in a position equivalent to that defined for the cationic neurotransmitters (7Mouillac B.

Because all receptor residues potentially interacting with AVP are conserved in the different members of the AVP/oxytocin (OT) receptor family, we proposed that the binding pocket identified in the V1a might be common to V2, V1b, and OT receptor subtypes. Extracellular residues responsible for receptor-selective and species-selective binding have also been identified (8Ufer E. Postina R. Gorbulev V. Fahrenholz F.

The photoaffinity labeling technique is an essential complement to modeling and mutagenesis approaches and allows direct unambiguous identification of the contact regions between a receptor and its specific photoactivatable ligands (for review see Ref. 14Kotzyba-Hibert F. Kapfer I. Goeldner M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1995; 34: 1296-1312Crossref Scopus (388) Google Scholar). At the present time, very few photoaffinity labeling studies have led to the direct determination of labeled amino acid residues in peptide G protein-coupled receptor; remarkable results with bovine V2receptor (15Kojro E. Eich P. Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13537-13544Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), human NK1 tachykinin receptor (16Girault S. Sagan S. Bolbach G. Lavielle S. Chassaing G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and rat type A cholecystokinin receptor (17Ji Z. Hadac E.M. Henne R.M. Patel S.A. Lybrand T.P. Miller L.J. J. Biol.

Very recently, a first radioiodinated photoreactive linear peptide antagonist has been used in our laboratory to photolabel the human and rat V1a receptors (12Phalipou S. Cotte N. Carnazzi E.

Biochem. 1997; 247: 906-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Our results have clearly indicated that covalent attachment of the [125I]3N3Phpa-LVA occurs in a restricted domain of the human receptor including TMR VII. Based both on this photolabeling result and on the hypothetical three-dimensional model of the human V1a receptor, residues potentially involved in binding and affinity of the antagonist ligand have been targeted. An interaction between the hydrophobic N terminus of the [125I]3N3Phpa-LVA ligand and an aromatic cluster of residues in the TMR VI has thus been experimentally verified. However, because of the lack of structural and conformational data for this family of V1a-selective compounds and because of their peptidic nature and highly variable linear structure, the determination of a single contact point between the peptide antagonist and the receptor does not provide enough information to propose a docking mode of the ligand into the receptor. To allow a more complete location of the binding sites for this family of V1a linear peptide antagonists and to generate meaningful information on receptor-antagonist interactions, we thus decided to label the human V1a receptor with a second radioiodinated photoreactive antagonist. In the present study, properties of [125I][Lys(3N3Phpa)8]HO-LVA, an antagonist containing an azido group at a position (side chain of lysine residue 8) likely to covalently bind another domain of the receptor are described. Combining photolabeling with this new ligand of the human V1a receptor, cyanogen bromide cleavage and endoproteinase digestions of the receptor, a restricted photolabeled domain has been identified which spans the first extracellular loop from Asp112 to Pro120. Taking into account the present and previous photolabeling data, three-dimensional models of antagonist-bound receptors have been constructed and experimentally verified. Residues possibly involved in the interactions with the photoactivatable antagonists have been mutated, and affinities of the mutant receptors for the ligands have been estimated. The peptide 4HO-Phpa-DTyr(Me)-Phe-Gln-Asn-Arg-Pro-Lys-NH2·2CF3CO2H and the acid 3N3Phpa were synthesized, purified by reverse phase HPLC, and characterized by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry as described previously (18Carnazzi E.

J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 1312-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The peptide (7 mg, 5.2 μmol) was dissolved in anhydrous Me2SO (100 μl) and mixed with an excess of azidoacid (1.9 mg, 10 μmol), PyBOP (5.2 mg, 10 μmol) (21Coste J. Le Nguyen D. Castro B. Tetrahedron Lett. 1990; 31: 205-208Crossref Scopus (645) Google Scholar), and (iPr)2EtN (4 μl) and kept in the dark. After 1 h, monitoring of the reaction was done by injection of ≈0.2 μl of mixture onto the analytical HPLC (end-capped C18 Merck Lichrosorb column, 4 × 250 mm, 5-μm particle size, 100 Å porosity, linear 1%/min CH3CN gradient in water, all acidified by 0.1% CF3CO2H (v/v)) and eluted at 2 ml/min using a dual wavelength (214 nm and 254 nm) UV detection (22Seyer R. Aumelas A. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1990; 1: 3289-3299Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The mixture was acidified using CF3CO2H, injected onto the semi-preparative HPLC (C18 Vydac 218TP1022, 25 × 250 mm, 10-μm particle size, 80 Å porosity), and eluted at 10 ml/min using a 0.5%/min linear CH3CN:0.1% CF3CO2H gradient. In these conditions, an impurity (noniodinatable) was eluted immediately before the expected compound and was poorly separated. The lyophilized preparation was injected onto two coupled semi-preparative columns (Vydac, as above, and Whatman Magnum 20, Partisil ODS-3, 25 × 500 mm, 10-μm particle size, 80 Å porosity) and eluted at 10 ml/min using a 0.2%/min CH3CN:0.1% CF3CO2H gradient, running from 20 to 40%. In these conditions, the impurity eluted after the target compound and was well separated, as shown by the analytical screening of the fractions. The photoactivatable antagonist was lyophilized and characterized (see “Results”). Under HPLC monitoring, around 1 molar equivalent of ICl in MeOH (10−2m, 50 μl) was added to a solution of the precedent compound (2 10−4m, 3.5 ml) in order to obtain the monoiodinated analogue (second peptide peak) as the major species. The three compounds were separated (Vydac column, 10 ml/min and 1%/min CH3CN: 0.1% CF3CO2H, starting from 0%) as follows: noniodinated (41%), monoiodinated (44%), and diiodinated (47%). The monoiodinated compound (fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, M+1 = 1412) was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, lyophilized, and used as HPLC standard for radioiodination. After synthesis, the photoactivatable linear peptide antagonist was radioiodinated at position 1 on the phenolic substituent in the presence of the oxidant 1,3,4,6-tetrachloro-3α,6α-diphenyl-glycouril (Iodo-Gen®, Pierce) by means of 1 mCi of Na125I (IMS 30, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (23Barberis C.

Neuroendocrinology. 1995; 62: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The radioiodinated peptide was purified on a HPLC column (Waters C18 μBondapak) by two subsequent runs. The specific radioactivity of the monoiodinated antagonist was 2,200 Ci/mmol. The human V1a receptor cDNA was a generous gift of Dr. M. Thibonnier (24Thibonnier M. Auzan C. Madhun Z. Wilkins P. Berti-Mattera L. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3304-3310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and CHO cells were transfected as described before (12Phalipou S. Cotte N. Carnazzi E.

CHO cells stably expressing the human V1a, V1b, V2, or OT receptor were maintained in culture in Petri dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 4 mm l-glutamine, 500 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin, 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Depending on the experiment to be conducted, cells were treated overnight with 5 mm sodium butyrate to increase receptor expression (25Kassis S. Henneberry R.C. Fishman P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4910-4916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Park C. Chamberlin M.E. Pan C.J. Chou J.Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9807-9814Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested, washed two times in PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+, polytron-homogenized in lysis buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm EDTA) and centrifuged at 100 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were recovered and centrifuged at 44,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Pellets were washed in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2) and centrifuged at 44,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Membranes were suspended in a small volume of Buffer A, and protein contents were determined. Aliquots of membranes were used immediately in binding assays and photolabeling experiments or stored at −80 °C. As described in previous papers (7Mouillac B. Chini B. Balestre M.N. Elands J.

Membrane were incubated in Buffer A with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and with radiolabeled and displacing peptides for 30 min (with [3H]AVP) or 60 min (with radioiodinated antagonists). Affinities (K d) for [125I]HO-LVA, [125I]3N3Phpa-LVA, and [125I][Lys(3N3Phpa)8]HO-LVA (concentrations from 10 to 600 pm), as well as for [3H]AVP (concentrations from 0.1 to 20 nm) were directly determined in saturation experiments. Affinities (K i) for unlabeled ligands were determined from competition experiments using [3H]AVP (1–2 nm) or [125I]HO-LVA (50–100 pm) as the radioligands. The concentrations of the unlabeled ligands varied from 1 pm to 10 μm. AVP (10 μm) and HO-LVA (400 nm) were used to determine nonspecific binding, respectively. Bound and free radioactivity were separated by filtration over bovine serum albumin presoaked Whatman GF/C filters. The ligand binding data were analyzed by nonlinear least squares regression using the computer program Ligand (27Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). Inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation was determined as described (28Berridge M.J. Downes C.P. Hanley M.R. Biochem. J. 1982; 206: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (1798) Google Scholar). Briefly, CHO cells expressing the human V1a receptor were plated and grown in 6-well dishes for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-supplemented medium and then labeled for 24 h withmyo -[2-3H]inositol (10–20 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) at a final concentration of 1 μCi/ml in a serum-free, inositol-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were washed twice with PBS medium, equilibrated at 37 °C in PBS for 1 h, and then incubated for 10 min in PBS supplemented with 10 mm LiCl in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of [Lys(3N3Phpa)8]HO-LVA or 3N3Phpa-LVA (from 10−12 to 10−6m). CHO cells were stimulated for 15 min with 10−9m AVP (a concentration close to theK act value determined in CHO cells). After stopping the reaction with perchloric acid, total IPs were extracted and purified by anion exchange chromatography column (Dowex AG1x8, formate form, 200–400 mesh; Bio-Rad). For each sample, a fraction containing total IPs was collected and counted.K inact constants were calculated asK inact = IC50/(1 + [AVP]/K act), in which IC50 is the concentration of antagonist leading to 50% inhibition, [AVP] = 1 nm and K act is the concentration of AVP inducing half-maximal accumulation of IP (K act = 0.32 nm in CHO cells expressing the wild-type human V1a receptor (12Phalipou S.

These experiments were conducted as described before for the previous photoactivatable antagonist [125I]3N3Phpa-LVA (12Phalipou S. Cotte N. Carnazzi E. Seyer R. Mahe E. Jard S. Barberis C. Mouillac B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26536-26544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes (500 μg) were resuspended in 4 ml of binding Buffer A containing bovine serum albumin (0.5 mg/ml) and were incubated for 1 or 3 h in the dark in the presence of [125I][Lys(3N3Phpa)8]HO-LVA (1–2 nm) with or without vasopressin (10 μm) to define specific labeling. Membranes were separated from unbound ligand by two subsequent centrifugations (20 min, 44,000 ×g , 4 °C) and washed with Buffer A. The final pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of Buffer A and irradiated with UV light (254 nm) for 1 min on ice. After photolysis, membranes were washed twice (2 × 1 ml of Buffer A) and finally resuspended in Laemmli buffer (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) using 1-mm-thick 12% cross-linked gels. Gels were fixed in glacial acetic acid:methanol:Me2SO:water (16:40:2:42), dried, and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film at −80 °C. In order to evaluate the yield of covalent binding, dried gels were also cut into slices, and radioactivity contents in the slices were determined. Covalent binding was calculated as percentage of the total number of receptor pmol expressed in the membrane preparation. Photolabeled membranes were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 12% cross-linked gels. The labeled bands were excised from the preparative gel and the human V1a vasopressin receptor was electroeluted with electroeluter model 422 (Bio-Rad) in Tris/glycine running buffer (25 mm Tris, 182 mm glycine, pH 8.3, 0.1% SDS). Samples containing “partially purified” V1a receptors were washed and concentrated using Microcon-30 (Amicon). Deglycosylation with N -glycosidase F and fragmentation with cyanogen bromide and endoproteases were performed on these concentrated samples. The photolabeled CHO membranes or the partially purified receptors were resuspended in deglycosylation buffer (100 mm Na2HPO4, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1% digitonin, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1% SDS) and digested with 2 units ofN -glycosidase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 2 days at 37 °C. Deglycosylated receptors were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 12% cross-linked gels. The electroeluted receptors were subjected to digestion with CNBr, Lys-C protease, or Asp-N protease. Double digestions were also performed (first digestion with CNBr followed by a second one with Lys-C or Asp-N protease). CNBr (a few crystals) cleavage of the electroeluted V1a receptors was carried out on samples in a 100-μl volume of 70% (v/v) formic acid. The mixture was incubated in the dark for 24 h at room temperature under argon, and the reaction was then stopped by adding 500 μl of water. Sample volume was reduced under vacuum, and solvent exchange (removing formic acid) with water was accomplished. Endoproteinase Lys-C (sequencing grade fromLysobacter enzymogenes , Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used at 0.2 μg/assay in a final 50-μl volume. The digestion was performed in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS at 37 °C for 16–24 h and stopped by addition of Laemmli buffer. Endoproteinase Asp-N (sequencing grade from Pseudomonas fragi , Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used at 0.1 μg/assay for 48 h at 25 °C in a final 50-μl volume of 25 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.8. To perform double fragmentations, the CNBr digests were washed several times with water, and volume sample was reduced before dilution in Lys-C or Asp-N buffer. Results of CNBr and protease digestions were analyzed by a Tricine discontinuous SDS-PAGE system (10–16.5% cross-linked gels) applied to the separation of small molecular mass species (30Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Gels were then fixed in glacial acetic acid:methanol:Me2SO:water (10:50:2:38), dried, and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film at −80 °C. The three-dimensional model of the human V1a vasopressin receptor hosting AVP was constructed using the procedure already extensively described in a previous publication for the rat V1a receptor (7Mouillac B. Chini B. Balestre M.N. Elands J. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Hibert M. Jard S. Barberis C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25771-25777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Briefly, the transmembrane part of the V1a receptor was constructed by using the three-dimensional model first developed on the bacteriorhodopsin experimental structure (31Hibert M.F. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Bruinvels A. Hoflack J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 8-15PubMed Google Scholar, 32Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Bruinvels A. Hibert M. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 3448-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) and refined on the bovine rhodopsin footprint (33Schertler G.F. Villa C. Henderson R. Nature. 1993; 362: 770-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). The extracellular regions of the receptor were then built in an acceptable conformation. The rat residues were exchanged for the corresponding human residues. Transmembrane domain VII was rotated of about 20° to bring residues Thr710 and Ala711, 2Thr710 and Ala711 positions 10 and 11 in TMR VII. In the three-digit numbers that appear with the three-letter residue codes throughout, the first digit corresponds to the helical TMR, and the next two digits indicate the rank of the residue in the considered helix. pointing both toward the core of the binding cleft. 3N. Cotte, M. N. Balestre, A. Aumelas, E. Mahé, S. Phalipou, D. Morin, C. Barberis, M. Hibert, and B. Mouillac, manuscript in preparation. The whole receptor structure was then energy minimized in order to relax the structure and to remove unfavorable steric constraints. AVP was manually docked as reported and validated in previous publications (7Mouillac B. Chini B. Balestre M.N. Elands J. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Hibert M. Jard S. Barberis C. J. Biol.

First, the ligand was built using Sybyl 6.3 (TRIPOS Associates, Inc.) facilities and energy minimized in a fully extended conformation. The backbone and side chain of the photoactivatable ligand have then been superimposed on the corresponding features of AVP docked into the V1a receptor, as already published. The conformations of the ligand and of the side chains have been manually controlled to optimize the electrostatic and steric interactions with the receptor walls. The ligand-receptor complex has then been minimized without constraints (TRIPOS force field, Gasteiger-Hückel charges, 5,000 iterations). Alternative binding modes have been tried, but none of them was more satisfactory than the AVP-based model, on a physicochemical and energetical point of view. The same practical procedure has been followed to dock the previously published photoaffinity labeling agent, [125I]3N3Phpa-LVA (12Phalipou S. Cotte N. Carnazzi E. Seyer R. Mahe E. Jard S.

The construction of mutants W613A, F616V, and F617L (see legend of Fig. 8 and Table IV for numbering) has been reported in a previous paper (12Phalipou S. Cotte N. Carnazzi E. Seyer R. Mahe E.

Point mutations Y225D, Q218A, K308A and Q413A were introduced in the human V1a vasopressin receptor using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).

https://openalex.org/W2029027799,"Infections by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) involve interactions of the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 with CD4 and then with a coreceptor. R5 isolates of HIV-1 use CCR5 as a coreceptor, whereas X4 isolates use CXCR4. It is not known whether coreceptors merely trigger fusion of the viral and cellular membranes or whether they also influence the energetics of virus adsorption, the placement of the membrane fusion reaction, and the metabolism of adsorbed gp120. Surprisingly, the pathway for metabolism of adsorbed gp120 has not been investigated thoroughly in any cells. To address these issues, we used purified125I-gp120s derived from the R5 isolate BaL and from the X4 isolate IIIB as ligands for binding onto human cells that expressed CD4 alone or CD4 with a coreceptor. The gp120 preparations were active in forming ternary complexes with CD4 and the appropriate coreceptor. Moreover, the cellular quantities of CD4 and coreceptors were sufficient for efficient infections by the corresponding HIV-1 isolates. In these conditions, the kinetics and affinities of125I-gp120 adsorptions and their subsequent metabolisms were strongly dependent on CD4 but were not significantly influenced by CCR5 or CXCR4. After binding to CD4, the 125I-gp120s slowly became resistant to extraction from the cell monolayers by pH 3.0 buffer, suggesting that they were endocytosed with half-times of 1–2 h. Within 20–30 min of endocytosis, the 125I-gp120s were proteolytically degraded to small products that were shed into the media. The weak base chloroquine strongly inhibited125I-gp120 proteolysis and caused its intracellular accumulation, suggesting involvement of a low pH organelle. Results supporting these methods and conclusions were obtained by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. We conclude that the energetics, kinetics, and pathways of 125I-gp120 binding, endocytosis, and proteolysis are determined principally by CD4 rather than by coreceptors in cells that contain sufficient coreceptors for efficient infections. Therefore, the role of coreceptors in HIV-1 infections probably does not include steerage or subcellular localization of adsorbed virus. Infections by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) involve interactions of the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 with CD4 and then with a coreceptor. R5 isolates of HIV-1 use CCR5 as a coreceptor, whereas X4 isolates use CXCR4.

Moreover, the cellular quantities of CD4 and coreceptors were sufficient for efficient infections by the corresponding HIV-1 isolates. In these conditions, the kinetics and affinities of125I-gp120 adsorptions and their subsequent metabolisms were strongly dependent on CD4 but were not significantly influenced by CCR5 or CXCR4. After binding to CD4, the 125I-gp120s slowly became resistant to extraction from the cell monolayers by pH 3.0 buffer, suggesting that they were endocytosed with half-times of 1–2 h. Within 20–30 min of endocytosis, the 125I-gp120s were proteolytically degraded to small products that were shed into the media. The weak base chloroquine strongly inhibited125I-gp120 proteolysis and caused its intracellular accumulation, suggesting involvement of a low pH organelle. Results supporting these methods and conclusions were obtained by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. We conclude that the energetics, kinetics, and pathways of 125I-gp120 binding, endocytosis, and proteolysis are determined principally by CD4 rather than by coreceptors in cells that contain sufficient coreceptors for efficient infections. Therefore, the role of coreceptors in HIV-1 infections probably does not include steerage or subcellular localization of adsorbed virus. human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fetal bovine serum Infections by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)1 involve binding of the oligomeric viral gp120-gp41 complexes onto cell surface CD4 followed by interactions with a coreceptor which result in fusion of the viral and cellular membranes (1Wu L.

Recent evidence suggests that purified monomeric gp120 forms a ternary complex with CD4 and an appropriate coreceptor and that the initial association with CD4 induces a conformational change in gp120 which enhances its affinity for the coreceptor (1Wu L.

The observation that infections occur efficiently in cells that contain only a trace of coreceptor and a vast excess of CD4 has implied that membrane fluidity can contribute to formation of the ternary complexes that are necessary for infection (20Platt E.J. Wehrly K. Kuhmann S.E. Chesebro B. Kabat D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2855-2864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The above results raise the possibility that coreceptors might substantially modify the kinetics and energetics of gp120 adsorption onto CD4-positive cells and that they might also control the route for subsequent virus or gp120 metabolism. To address these issues, we used125I-gp120s derived from R5 and X4 isolates of HIV-1 for binding onto human cells that lack CD4 and coreceptors and onto derivative cells that contain CD4 alone or CD4 plus CCR5 or CXCR4.

Because gp120s bind to both CD4 and coreceptors, either of these cell surface associations could possibly have a dominating influence on the pathways of viral entry into cells and on gp120 metabolism. HeLa cells and HeLa clonal derivatives expressing CD4 alone or CD4 plus CCR5 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) as described previously (20Platt E.J. Wehrly K. Kuhmann S.E. Chesebro B. Kabat D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2855-2864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Kabat D. Kozak S.L. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2570-2577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human astroglioma U87MG cells were from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Clones of U87MG expressing CD4 described previously by Kozak et al. (37Kozak S.L. Platt E.J. Madani N. Ferro Jr., F.E. Peden K. Kabat D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 873-882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used to prepare derivatives that stably express CXCR4 or CCR5. The plasmid encoding CXCR4 (pcDNA3-LESTR) was provided by Marcel Loetscher (Theodor Kocher Institute, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland), whereas the CCR5 expression vector was constructed by cloning the CCR5 cDNA into the Bam HI and Xho I sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). U87MG cells and their derivatives were maintained in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS, minimum essential medium nonessential amino acids (0.1 mm) (Life Technologies, Inc.), and minimum essential medium sodium pyruvate (1 mm) (Life Technologies, Inc.). The M-tropic HIV-1 isolate BaL and the plasmids encoding the 5′-region (p83-2) and 3′-region (p83-10) of the genome of the T cell-tropic HIV-1 isolate NL4-3, contributed by Suzanne Gartner, Mikulas Popovic, and Robert Gallo, and by Ronald Desrosiers, respectively, were obtained from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health. HIV-1 BaL was amplified by brief passage in fresh phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. To propagate the T cell-tropic HIV-1 isolate, NL4-3, HeLa cells were cotransfected with linearized p83-2 and p83-10 DNAs using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (34Gibbs J.S. Regier D.A. Desrosiers D.C. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1994; 10: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 35Graham F.L. van der Eb J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). Culture medium was collected 72 h after transfection and passed through a filter (0.45-μm pore size). This initial viral stock was amplified in HeLa-CD4 clone HI-J cells until high viral titers were achieved. HIV-1 isolates BaL and NL4-3 were used to infect U87MG-CD4 cells expressing CCR5 and CXCR4, respectively, and the cells were assayed for infection using the focal infectivity method as described previously (36Chesebro B. Wehrly K. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 3779-3788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,37Kozak S.L. Platt E.J. Madani N. Ferro Jr., F.E. Peden K. Kabat D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 873-882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Monomeric T cell-tropic gp120 IIIB was a gift from Shiu-Lok Hu (Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Seattle). Monomeric M-tropic gp120 BaL was purified as described previously from the culture medium of Schneider 2 Drosophila cells that were generously donated by Dr. Raymond Sweet (Smith-Kline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, King of Prussia, PA) (38Ivey-Hoyle M. Culp J.S. Chaikin M.A. Hellmig B.D. Matthews T.J. Sweet R.W. Rosenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Samples (10–25 μg) of the gp120 preparations were labeled either on amine groups with 125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA) according to the manufacturer's directions, or on tyrosine residues with125I (NEN Life Science Products) using the lactoperoxidase method as described previously (39Warren R.A. Green F.A. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2116-2121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Unlabeled gp120 and125I-gp120 were analyzed for purity by electrophoresis in 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS followed by Coomassie Blue dye staining or autoradiography, respectively. Densitometric scanning suggested that these gp120 preparations were 92–95% pure. As expected, the major components in these gp120 preparations specifically bound antibodies to gp120. Cells (2.5 × 105) were plated in 2-cm2 wells of a 24-well tissue culture plate the day before the assay. The cells were incubated with 1–3 pm125I-gp120 in 0.2 ml of medium with 10% FBS at 37 °C. At various times, the cells were washed twice with medium with 10% FBS and once with phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were then solubilized in 0.1 n NaOH for measurement of radioactivity in a gamma counter. An aliquot of each solubilized sample was used for protein determination using the Coomassie Blue method (Bio-Rad). Before being solubilized, some wells were treated with cold pH 3.0 acid buffer to remove the surface125I-gp120 as described previously (21Pelchen-Matthews A. Armes J.E. Marsh M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3641-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 22Pelchen-Matthews A. Armes J.E. Griffiths G. Marsh M. J. Exp.

Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To study the metabolism of 125I-gp120, cells were incubated with125I-gp120 for 60 min at 37 °C, washed, replenished with fresh medium, and subsequently incubated at 37 °C for various periods of time. The media were collected, precipitated by adjusting to 10% trichloroacetic acid, and centrifuged; and the radioactivity in the trichloroacetic acid-soluble and -insoluble fractions was determined (21Pelchen-Matthews A. Armes J.E. Marsh M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3641-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The cells were then solubilized and processed as described above. In some experiments, chloroquine (20 μm) (Sigma) was present in the chase medium. To determine the Kd for binding, the cells were incubated with 3 pm125I-gp120 in the presence of increasing amounts of competing unlabeled gp120 at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were washed, solubilized and counted as above. To study the competitive displacement of the natural CCR5 ligand by gp120 BaL, the cells were initially incubated with various amounts of unlabeled gp120 in 0.1 ml/well at 37 °C for 30 min. Then 0.5 mm125I-MIP1β (2,200 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Sciences Products) was added and incubated for another 30 min, after which the cells were processed and counted as described above. HeLa-CD4/CCR5 cells were seeded on eight-chambered coverglasses (Nunc, Inc., Naperville, IL) at 2 × 104 cells/chamber. All incubations were in DMEM and 10% FBS and at 37 °C unless otherwise noted. After 24 h, the cells were incubated with or without BaL gp120 at 10 μg/ml for 90 min. They were then incubated for 90 min either in the presence or in the absence of 20 μm chloroquine as indicated. After this chase period, surface gp120 was removed from the indicated wells by treatment with cold pH 3.0 acid buffer for 2 min with subsequent recovery in DMEM, 10% FBS, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, at 37 °C for 10 min. The cells were then stained for either surface-bound gp120 or intracellular gp120. To detect surface gp120, the viable cells were incubated sequentially with sheep anti-gp120 serum (AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH: contributed by Dr. Michael Phelan) at 1:300 for 60 min and Alexa 594 donkey anti-sheep IgG conjugate (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) at 1:250 for 60 min. Finally, cells were fixed in ice-cold methanol for 10 min. Intracellular gp120 was detected in cells that were acid-treated after the chase period by fixing them in ice-cold 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min. They were then permeablized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min and quenched in 20 mm glycine, 20 mmHepes, pH 7.5, in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. The cells were then incubated sequentially with sheep anti-gp120 serum at 1:400 for 90 min and Alexa 594 donkey anti-sheep IgG conjugate at 1:250 for 60 min and fixed again with ice-cold methanol for 10 min. All stained cells were stored under FluoroGuard antifade mounting reagent (Bio-Rad) and viewed by fluorescence confocal microscopy with a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 ES laser confocal imaging system. Assuming that the cell surface (S) and endocytosed (E) pools of125I-gp120 are homogeneous and that there is no ligand recycling to cell surfaces (see “Results”), thend [S]/dt = −ke [S], where ke is the rate constant for endocytosis, and d [E]/dt = ke [S] − kd [E], where kd is the rate constant for degradation. After removal of 125I-gp120 from the medium, the ratio of (d [S]/dt )/(d [E]/dt ) was observed to reach a steady-state value that is identical to the ratio of [S]/[E] (see “Results”). These ratios differ somewhat for different cells but range between approximately 1.3 and 2.0. By algebra, these considerations imply that kd is 2.3–3.0 times greater than ke . The gp120 preparations, which were highly purified as seen by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, were labeled either on amine groups with 125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent or on tyrosines with 125I (see Fig.1). The gp120s labeled by these methods had very similar properties and adsorbed specifically onto CD4-positive cells. However, the 125I-labeled gp120s were less stable and lost much of their activity within several days. Typically, the nonspecific binding onto HeLa cells was approximately 5% or less of the binding onto HeLa-CD4 (clone HI-J) cells (see below). As determined by competitive displacement of 125I-gp120 by unlabeled gp120 (20Platt E.J. Wehrly K. Kuhmann S.E. Chesebro B. Kabat D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2855-2864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Horuk R. Huang J.J. Covington M. Newton R.C. J. Biol.

We have shown previously that these gp120 preparations interact specifically with the appropriate coreceptors (16Madani N. Kozak S.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Kabat D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8005-8010Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, the X4 gp120 IIIB specifically antagonized CXCR4 signaling in response to the chemokine SDF-1, whereas the R5 gp120 BaL specifically antagonized CCR5 signaling responses to MIP1α (16Madani N. Kozak S.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Kabat D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8005-8010Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2, the gp120 BaL preparation also competitively displaced the CCR5-specific ligand125I-MIP1β from surfaces of HeLa-CD4/CCR5 (clone JC 53) cells, whereas the X4 gp120 IIIB preparation was inactive. Control HeLa cells lack CCR5 and do not bind 125I-MIP1β (40Horuk R. Huang J.J. Covington M. Newton R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16275-16278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although we attempted the converse experiment using 125I-SDF-1α and U87MG-CD4/CXCR4 cells, this was unsuccessful because of a very high background of binding onto control U87MG cells. Because U87MG cells lack CXCR4 (see below), we infer that the background may be caused by125I-SDF-1α binding to proteoglycans (43Wagner L. Yang O.O. Garcia-Zepeda E.A. Ge Y. Kalams S.A. Walker B.D.

Initially, we analyzed the binding and metabolism of 125I-gp120 IIIB using HeLa-CD4 (clone HI-J) cells that contain a large amount of CD4 (about 4–4.5 × 105 CD4/cell) and CXCR4 and are highly susceptible to LAV/IIIB and other X4 isolates of HIV-1 (20Platt E.J.

A. 1998; 95: 8005-8010Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the trace concentration of125I-gp120 adsorbed slowly onto the HeLa-CD4 cells for 1–2 h, after which a steady state of labeling was achieved (see Fig.3 A ). In contrast, negligible binding occurred onto the control HeLa cells. Presumably, the kinetics of 125I-gp120 labeling of the HeLa-CD4 cells would be affected not only by the rates of ligand binding and dissociation but also by metabolism. As also shown in Fig.3 A , removal of unbound 125I-gp120 from some of the culture wells after 60 min resulted in a slow diminution of the total cell-associated radioactivity. Approximately 70% of the cell-associated radioactivity in the 60-min samples was extracted with acidic pH 3.0 buffer at 0 °C, suggesting that it was on cell surfaces, but this percentage declined somewhat during further incubation of the cells. Consistent with previous studies using other ligands (e.g. 21–23, 29), these brief rinses at pH 3.0 did not reduce cellular viability or adherence to the dishes, and additional rinses did not extract more 125I-gp120 from the cells. Because 125I-gp120 did not accumulate in the acid-resistant presumptive intracellular fraction during incubation of the cultures at 37 °C, we presumed that it might be degraded and released from the cells with a half-time that was considerably shorter than the half-time of endocytosis (see “Discussion”). Consistent with this interpretation, small radioactive products that were soluble in 10% trichloroacetic acid were released into the culture medium (see Fig. 3 B ). The latter results implied that 125I-gp120 IIIB might be endocytosed slowly and then degraded proteolytically in HeLa-CD4 cells. To address this further, we incubated 125I-gp120 IIIB with the cells for 60 min at 37 °C and then rinsed the cells and compared the metabolism in the presence and absence of the weak base chloroquine. Weak bases including chloroquine accumulate in lysosomes, raise their pH, and inhibit their degradative functions (44Anderson R.G.W. Orci L. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 A , chloroquine had no effect on removal of 125I-gp120 IIIB from the acid-extractable cell surface fraction, suggesting that it did not perturb endocytosis. However, chloroquine caused a substantial increase of 125I-gp120 IIIB in the intracellular fraction and a corresponding decrease in release of trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactive products into the culture medium (Fig. 4 B ). These results strongly suggest that 125I-gp120 IIIB is endocytosed slowly into HeLa-CD4 cells (half-time of approximately 100 min) and that it is then proteolytically degraded relatively rapidly. Furthermore, these data substantiate our methods for distinguishing cell surface and endocytosed pools of 125I-gp120. Support for these methods and conclusions was also obtained by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (see below). Previous evidence suggested that endocytosed125I-monoclonal antibody-CD4 complexes are partially recycled to cell surfaces (21Pelchen-Matthews A. Armes J.E. Marsh M.

This evidence relied on the observation that the endocytosed complexes were resistant to pH 3.0 extraction at 0 °C and that this treatment did not reduce cell viability. After adding fresh culture medium at 37 °C, however, some of the labeled complexes slowly returned to the cell surface fraction. We performe"

The physiological role of MAO B is to oxidize exogenous and endogenous amines, many of which could mimic the function of neurotransmitters. MAO A oxidizes neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. The structures and mechanisms of these enzymes are currently being investigated. The gene sequences of both MAO A and B from human liver have been determined to be ∼70% identical (4Bach A.W. Lan N.C. Johnson D.L. Abell C.W. Bembenek M.E. Kwan S.W. Seeburg P.H. Shih J.C. Proc.

A covalently bound FAD cofactor is present in either enzyme, attached to a conserved cysteinyl residue (Cys-406 in MAO A and Cys-397 in MAO B) via an 8α-S -cysteinyl flavin linkage (Scheme FS1). Neither the need for covalent FAD attachment nor the mechanism of covalent incorporation is known.Covalent attachment of flavin cofactors has been found in more than 20 proteins that catalyze a variety of reactions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (5Edmondson D.E. DeFrancesco R. Muller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. 1. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 73-104Google Scholar). The processes by which flavins are incorporated into proteins appear to differ and to vary in complexity. The simplest known system is the heterodimeric p -cresol-methylhydroxylase fromPseudomonas putida . The enzyme is capable of autoflavinylation in vitro (formation of an 8α-O -tyrosyl-FAD), requiring only the recombinantly produced purified flavin-binding subunit, a separately expressed and purified heme-containing subunit, and FAD (6Kim J. Fuller H. Kuusk V. Cunane L. Chen Z. Matthews F.S. McIntire W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31202-31209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Flavinylation of the mitochondrial matrix enzyme succinate dehydrogenase to form 8α-N (3)-histidyl-FAD appears to be more complex than that of p -cresol-methylhydroxylase. In vitro studies indicate that flavinylation requires the presence of other factors including molecular chaperones, ATP, and effector molecules such as succinate, fumarate, or malate (7Robinson K.M. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4055-4060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These additional factors have been suggested to aid in folding the enzyme into a conformation that permits covalent attachment of the flavin (8Robinson K.M. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4061-4067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Flavinylation of MAO B has been examined by its expression in riboflavin-depleted COS-7 cells (9Zhou B.P. Lewis D.A. Kwan S.W. Abell C.W. J. Biol.

Electroporation of these cells with a cDNA encoding MAO B and either FAD or 8α-hydroxy-FAD results in the production of catalytically active enzyme. In the absence of added FAD, the inactive apoenzyme form of MAO B is produced. These results have been suggested to support a flavinylation mechanism for MAO B involving additional factors that would process and activate the 8α position of the flavin prior to covalent attachment (9Zhou B.P.

Massey V. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The application of this approach to those flavoenzymes containing covalently bound flavins has not been extensively investigated due to the technical limitations involved in introducing flavin analogues into a covalent linkage with the protein. The pioneering work of Lambooy and co-workers (13Kim Y.S. Lambooy J.P. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1978; 157: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 14Dix B.A. Lambooy J.P. J.

Biochem. 1985; 17: 975-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) first demonstrated the possibility of using flavin analogues as probes of structure and mechanism in this subclass of flavoenzymes. These studies involved feeding flavin analogues with modifications in the 7 and 8 positions of the flavin ring to riboflavin-deficient rats. The activities of MAO and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) were determined and compared with riboflavin-fed control animals. Incorporation of 8α-methylriboflavin and 7α-methylriboflavin into succinate dehydrogenase and into MAO was shown using 14C-labeled analogues. Some catalytic activity was observed for both enzymes when either flavin analogue or no flavin analogue was present in the diet, although the level of activity depended on which riboflavin analogue was used and which tissue sample was analyzed. This work was limited in that it was not possible to isolate sufficient quantities of enzyme for detailed kinetic and structural analysis. Additionally, the number of analogues that could be tested was limited due to the anti-vitaminic activity of some flavins in whole animals. Later studies (16Oltmanns O. Lingens F. Z. Naturforsch. 1967; 226: 751-754Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) investigating the covalent incorporation of flavin analogues into succinate dehydrogenase used yeast strains deficient in the biosynthesis of riboflavin. This allowed the use of several flavin analogues as probes for their ability to be incorporated and function catalytically in yeast SDH (17Oestreicher G. Grossman S. Goldenberg J. Kearney E.B. Edmondson D.E. Singer T.P. Lambooy J.P. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1980; 67B: 395-402Google Scholar). Preparations of yeast succinate dehydrogenase were catalytically active with either 7α-methylriboflavin or 8α-methylriboflavin. The 8α-methylriboflavin analogue was demonstrated to be covalently incorporated into SDH by isolation and analysis of the respective flavin-containing peptide (17Oestreicher G. Grossman S. Goldenberg J. Kearney E.B. Edmondson D.E. Singer T.P. Lambooy J.P. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1980; 67B: 395-402Google Scholar).The recent successful expression of the human liver MAO A and MAO B genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (18Urban P. Andersen J.K. Hsu H.P. Pompon D. FEBS Lett. 1991; 286: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 19Weyler W. Titlow C.C. Salach J.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 1205-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) prompted us to develop a riboflavin-deficient yeast strain as a system to study the incorporation of flavin analogues as substitutes for the normal flavin in MAO A and B. Such a system would allow experimental approaches to probe the effects of structural alterations of the flavin coenzyme on the catalytic properties of either MAO A or MAO B as well as the structural requirements of the flavin molecule necessary for covalent flavin incorporation into these enzymes. By separately expressing MAO A or MAO B, such a system avoids the difficulties of interpretation of results from the animal system, where both MAO A and MAO B are expressed in most tissues. For those flavin analogues that are covalently incorporated into MAO, new insights into the mechanistic role of the flavin coenzyme in catalysis might be determined. With the yeast expression system it should be possible to isolate sufficient quantities of MAO to allow structural and kinetic analysis of the enzyme forms produced with various flavin analogues and possibly provide new insights into the mechanistic role of the flavin in catalysis.This work describes two systems for the covalent incorporation of flavin analogues with alterations in the isoalloxazine ring or in the ribityl side chain into MAO A or MAO B. Flavinylation is monitored by the expression of catalytically functional enzymes and from the use of flavin-specific antisera as described by Barber et al . (20Barber M.J. Eichler D.C. Solomonson L.P. Ackrell B.A. Biochem. J. 1987; 242: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Those flavin analogues whose structures prevented covalent incorporation or were not converted to their FAD coenzyme form failed to support any catalytic activity with either enzyme. Conversely, all flavin analogues that were covalently bound to either enzyme did support catalytic activity. Structural analysis of MAO A expressed in the presence of 7-nor-7-bromoriboflavin demonstrated that covalent incorporation occurred at Cys-406 at the 8α position of the flavin. Flavin analogues with 8-nor-8-halogen substituents were incorporated into either enzyme as the 8-nor-8-S -thioflavin. Both MAO A and MAO B exhibit similar specificities for flavin analogue incorporation.DISCUSSIONFlavin analogues provide a useful tool to probe both the structure and mechanism of enzymes containing a flavin cofactor. The approach outlined in this paper extends this application to those flavoenzymes containing a covalently bound flavin that can be heterologously expressed in S. cerevisiae . Alternatively, this approach may be useful for flavin analogue incorporation into those flavoenzymes containing non-covalent flavins but are refractory to reversible resolution of the bound flavin by known techniques. The major limitation of the approach is the ability of the flavokinase and FAD synthetase of yeast to convert the riboflavin analogue under investigation to the FMN and FAD levels. Of the analogues tested in this study, N (3)-methylriboflavin and 8-nor-8-aminoriboflavin are inactive with the yeast flavokinase system. The failure to observe incorporation of either of these analogues into MAO A or MAO B is undoubtedly due to a requirement for the FAD coenzyme form for covalent incorporation.The use of mutant strain RM2 allows growth of the organism on normal riboflavin for optimal formation of other metabolically essential flavoenzymes and permits the use of flavin analogues that might exhibit anti-vitaminic activity for testing of incorporation into expressed MAO. The flavin concentration requirement for optimal MAO activity is relatively high compared with the trace levels of the vitamin found in the growth media or in metabolic pools of the organism. Although strain RM3 expresses high levels of MAO A, the “leakiness” of MAO expression requires that only the riboflavin analogue of interest be used both for growth of the organism as well as for MAO induction. This situation may place limits on flavin analogues used in that they would also have to be functional in other key metabolic flavoenzymes in order for the organism to grow.From the data presented in Table III and in Figs. 3 and 4, a large number of 7- or 8-substituted flavin analogues are covalently incorporated into MAO A and into MAO B and support catalytic activity. The two enzymes appear to exhibit similar specificities as to which flavin analogues are incorporated and support catalytic activity. One major difference between the two enzymes is the higher catalytic activity exhibited by MAO B with 7α-methyl, 8α-methylriboflavin than is observed with MAO A. The results obtained using 7α-methylriboflavin and 8α-methylriboflavin in the system described here differ somewhat from those obtained by Lambooy and co-workers (13Kim Y.S. Lambooy J.P. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1978; 157: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 14Dix B.A. Lambooy J.P. J. Nutr. 1981; 111: 1397-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 15Kim Y.S. Lambooy J.P. Int. J. Biochem. 1985; 17: 975-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) using riboflavin-depleted rats. Both 7α-methylriboflavin and 8α-methylriboflavin significantly reduced the observed MAO activity (both MAO A and MAO B) in riboflavin-depleted rats. In the yeast expression system (relative to riboflavin), 7α-methylriboflavin decreases both MAO A and MAO B activities, whereas 8α-methylriboflavin decreases MAO A activity and results in an enhanced MAO B activity. Understanding the detailed molecular basis for this difference is beyond the scope of this paper and will ultimately be resolved from x-ray structural elucidation of MAO A and MAO B. This behavior does support the notion of quite different structures about the active sites which is apparent from a comparative study of substrate substituent effects on binding and rates of flavin reduction that are ongoing in this laboratory. The lowered activities of 7α-methyl-substituted flavins with MAO A suggest steric effects about the benzenoid ring of the bound flavin that influence the expression of catalytic activity in a currently undefined manner. The effect of removing the 2′-hydroxy group from the flavin ribityl side chain decreases the turnover numbers of lipoamide dehydrogenase, mercuric ion reductase, and glutathione reductase (50Murthy Y. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19915-19921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and results in an inactive form of general acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (47Ghisla S. Engst S. Vock P. Kieweg V. Bross P. Nandy A. Rasched I. Strauss A.W. Yagi K. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1993: 283-292Google Scholar). 2′-Deoxyriboflavin is incorporated covalently into MAO A, and no significant difference (relative to riboflavin) in catalytic activity is observed (Table III). These results demonstrate that the 2′-hydroxyl group on the flavin side chain is not required for either process in MAO A.The data on purified MAO A demonstrates conclusively that the covalent incorporation of 8-halogen-8-nor-substituted flavins occurs by a nucleophilic attack of the thiol of Cys-406 on the 8-halogenated position of the flavin as shown in SchemeFS4. This reaction has been shown previously in Massey's laboratory to occur in solution on reaction of 8-nor-8-chloroflavin with N -acetylcysteine. We have employed this reaction to prepare a model flavin peptide that exhibits the same HPLC retention time and fluorescence properties as that of the peptide derived from the enzyme. These data support Cys-406 as the attacking thiol group and suggest the 8-nor-8-halogenated FAD binds to a partially folded form of MAO A containing a FAD-binding site prior to nucleophilic displacement. Further evidence for the correct thiol (Cys-406) as the nucleophile is the demonstration that 7-nor-7-bromo-FAD forms a covalent 8α-S -thioether linkage to Cys-406 resulting in a peptide with the expected sequence. Our failure to characterize the 8-thioflavin peptide by normal Edman sequencing and MALDI mass spectrometric techniques is probably due to the enhanced reactivity of this flavin linkage and its lability to oxidative alterations during normal peptide purification techniques.Figure FS4Mechanism of 8-thioflavin formation in MAO.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Two flavin analogues were specifically synthesized to determine if attachment of the flavin cofactor to MAO could occur by a halogen moiety alone at either Cys-7 or Cys-8 of the flavin ring. The analogues 7,8-nor-7-chlororiboflavin and 7,8-nor-8-chloro-riboflavin were examined for activity and covalent attachment to MAO A. Only 7,8-nor-8-chlororiboflavin produced active flavinylated MAO A indicating that, in agreement with the results described here on 7-nor-7-bromoriboflavin, no nucleophilic attack of the Cys-406 thiol on the 7-halogen substituent occurs. This result also suggests that no substituent is required at Cys-7 for covalent flavinylation or enzyme activity.The demonstration of a direct nucleophilic attack of the cysteinyl thiol on the 8-halogen substituent of the flavin provides supporting evidence for the quinone methide mechanism for covalent incorporation of flavins into proteins as originally suggested by Frost and Rastetter (1Frost J.W. Rastetter W.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 7157-7159Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (Scheme FS5). Consistent with this mechanism is the absence of a covalent attachment between the 7,8-nor-7-chloroflavin analogue and MAO A. This analogue does not contain a potential electrophilic site for nucleophilic attack by the cysteine thiolate. Failure of 5-carba-5-deazariboflavin to form a covalent linkage with MAO A or B is likely due to the inability of the enzyme-flavin adduct to be reoxidized to form a stable 8α-S -thioether linkage (Scheme FS4). No evidence is apparent for any requisite flavin ring modification prior to covalent incorporation as has been suggested previously (9Zhou B.P. Lewis D.A. Kwan S.W. Abell C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23653-23660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). If the mechanism shown in Scheme FS4 is operative, then one predicts that covalent attachment of 8α-methyl-riboflavin analogues to MAO is expected to occur at the 8α-carbon and not the 8β-carbon. Work is underway in this laboratory to test this prediction.Figure FS5Proposed quinone-methide mechanism for covalent flavin incorporation into MAO.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The observation that all analogues producing active enzymes are covalently attached to MAO A or B suggests that covalent flavinylation of either enzyme is required for activity. This conclusion is inconsistent with the report by Hiro and colleagues (51Hiro I. Tsugeno Y. Hirashiki I. Ogata F. Ito A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) who have described a C406A mutant of rat liver MAO A that exhibits catalytic activity without benefit of covalent flavin attachment. We have confirmed this finding with the same mutant form of human MAO A expressed in S. cerevisiae . 3R. Nandigama and D. E. Edmondson, unpublished observations. These observations demonstrate that covalent flavin incorporation is not an absolute requirement for catalytic activity in MAO A. Similar results have been demonstrated with mutants of Escherichia coli fumarate reductase (52Blaut M. Whittaker K. Valdovinos A. Ackrell B.A.C. Gunsalus T.P. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13599-13604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) which contain FAD rather than 8α-N (3)-histidyl-FAD. Thus, the basis for covalent attachment of flavins in certain enzymes may have no mechanistic significance other than to prevent dissociation of the flavin coenzyme from its binding site. Monoamine oxidases A and B (MAO A and MAO B)1 (EC 1.4.3.4) are homodimeric flavoenzymes found in the outer membrane of mitochondria of higher eukaryotes and are expressed in a tissue-specific manner (2Weyler W. Hsu Y.P. Breakefield X.O. Pharmacol. Ther. 1990; 47: 391-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). These enzymes catalyze the oxidation of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines to imines with concomitant reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide (3Kearney E.B. Salach J.I. Walker W.H. Seng R.

The physiological role of MAO B is to oxidize exogenous and endogenous amines, many of which could mimic the function of neurotransmitters. MAO A oxidizes neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. The structures and mechanisms of these enzymes are currently being investigated. The gene sequences of both MAO A and B from human liver have been determined to be ∼70% identical (4Bach A.W. Lan N.C. Johnson D.L. Abell C.W. Bembenek M.E. Kwan S.W. Seeburg P.H. Shih J.C. Proc.

A covalently bound FAD cofactor is present in either enzyme, attached to a conserved cysteinyl residue (Cys-406 in MAO A and Cys-397 in MAO B) via an 8α-S -cysteinyl flavin linkage (Scheme FS1). Neither the need for covalent FAD attachment nor the mechanism of covalent incorporation is known. Covalent attachment of flavin cofactors has been found in more than 20 proteins that catalyze a variety of reactions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (5Edmondson D.E. DeFrancesco R. Muller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. 1. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 73-104Google Scholar).

Flavinylation of the mitochondrial matrix enzyme succinate dehydrogenase to form 8α-N (3)-histidyl-FAD appears to be more complex than that of p -cresol-methylhydroxylase. In vitro studies indicate that flavinylation requires the presence of other factors including molecular chaperones, ATP, and effector molecules such as succinate, fumarate, or malate (7Robinson K.M. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4055-4060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These additional factors have been suggested to aid in folding the enzyme into a conformation that permits covalent attachment of the flavin (8Robinson K.M. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4061-4067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Flavinylation of MAO B has been examined by its expression in riboflavin-depleted COS-7 cells (9Zhou B.P. Lewis D.A. Kwan S.W. Abell C.W. J. Biol.

Electroporation of these cells with a cDNA encoding MAO B and either FAD or 8α-hydroxy-FAD results in the production of catalytically active enzyme. In the absence of added FAD, the inactive apoenzyme form of MAO B is produced. These results have been suggested to support a flavinylation mechanism for MAO B involving additional factors that would process and activate the 8α position of the flavin prior to covalent attachment (9Zhou B.P.

CRC Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoproteins. 2. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 343-375Google Scholar). Flavin analogues that have modifications in the isoalloxazine ring or in the ribityl side chain have been used extensively to address structure-activity and mechanistic questions in flavoproteins containing non-covalently bound flavin coenzymes (12Ghisla S. Massey V. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The application of this approach to those flavoenzymes containing covalently bound flavins has not been extensively investigated due to the technical limitations involved in introducing flavin analogues into a covalent linkage with the protein. The pioneering work of Lambooy and co-workers (13Kim Y.S. Lambooy J.P. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1978; 157: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 14Dix B.A. Lambooy J.P. J.

Biochem. 1985; 17: 975-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) first demonstrated the possibility of using flavin analogues as probes of structure and mechanism in this subclass of flavoenzymes. These studies involved feeding flavin analogues with modifications in the 7 and 8 positions of the flavin ring to riboflavin-deficient rats. The activities of MAO and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) were determined and compared with riboflavin-fed control animals. Incorporation of 8α-methylriboflavin and 7α-methylriboflavin into succinate dehydrogenase and into MAO was shown using 14C-labeled analogues. Some catalytic activity was observed for both enzymes when either flavin analogue or no flavin analogue was present in the diet, although the level of activity depended on which riboflavin analogue was used and which tissue sample was analyzed. This work was limited in that it was not possible to isolate sufficient quantities of enzyme for detailed kinetic and structural analysis. Additionally,"

The structure-activity analysis, based on various deletion analogs, led to the identification of two minimal functional peptides, which by themselves exhibit adequate antibacterial activity againstEscherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium . The common features between these two peptides are that they both share an aromatic-proline-aromatic (ArProAr) sequence motif, and their sequences are retro with respect to one another.

The role of different residues in structure and function of tritrypticin was delineated by analyzing antibacterial activity and circular dichroism spectra of various designed analogs. Three main results arise from this study. First, the ArProAr sequence motif in proteins has definitive conformational features associated with it.

N -(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl tryptic soy broth protein data bank aromatic-proline-aromatic polyproline type II The survival of all living organisms necessitates a rapid and effective host defense against invading pathogens. The higher organisms that have arrived much later in a world inhabited by prokaryotes developed many host defense mechanisms, including gene-encoded antimicrobial peptides to face the challenge of these pathogens (1Barra D. Simmaco M. Boman H.G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 2Hancock R.E.W. Lancet. 1997; 349: 418-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). While the antimicrobial peptides serve as one of the first line of defense against pathogens in vertebrates, they represent the major component of the immune response in invertebrates (3Boman H.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar, 4Nicolas P. Mor A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 277-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). They are generally localized at specific sites that are exposed to microbial invasion. A class of antibacterial peptides called cathelicidins, which are synthesized as larger precursor molecules in bone marrow, are thus active in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (5Zanetti M. Gennaro R. Romeo D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Several members of cathelicidin family have been characterized and include CAP18 from rabbit granulocyte (6Lichtenstein A.K. Ganz T. Nguyen T.-M. Selsted M.E. Lehrer R.I. J.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The shared N-terminal domain in all these precursor molecules is homologous to cathelin, a known host defense molecule of innate immune response (11Pungercar J. Strukelj B. Kopitar G. Renko M. Lenarcic B. Turk F.G.V. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A part of the C-terminal domain varying in length from 13 to 30 residues and having no homology among different members of cathelicidins has antimicrobial activity. Tritrypticin is one such 13-residue tryptophan-rich bactericidal peptide derived from C12 (12Lawyer C. Pai S. Watabe M. Borgia P. Mashimo T. Eagleton L. Watabe K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The inherent genetic plasticity on one hand and the ability to adapt to challenging environments on the other have led to the development of antibiotic resistance by many microorganisms (2Hancock R.E.W. Lancet. 1997; 349: 418-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar).

The structure and mechanism of action of tritrypticin were, therefore, undertaken by a knowledge-based approach involving analysis of conformational patterns in homologous sequences under the experimentally derived structural constraints (14Gupta H.M. Talwar G.P. Salunke D.M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1993; 16: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Here we report the functionally relevant structural features of tritrypticin and shed light on the possible mechanisms associated with its activity. 4-Hydroxymethyl phenoxymethyl polystyrene resin, solvents, and reagents used for synthesis were supplied by Applied Biosystems Inc.

Trifluoroacetic acid, 1,2-ethanedithiol, and thioanisole for cleavage were procured from Sigma. Phenol crystals (analytical reagent) and diethyl ether (analytical reagent) were purchased from S. D. Fine Chem. Ltd. (Boisar, India). High performance liquid chromatography grade acetonitrile was obtained from Merck. The Gram-negative bacterial strains Salmonella typhimurium 3261 PNP2 Gro A mutant and Escherichia coli BL21(λD3) were used for radial diffusion assay. Agarose I (Biotechnology grade) was obtained from Amresco, and tryptic soy broth (TSB) was from Himedia Laboratories Pvt. Ltd. (Mumbai, India). Tween 20 was purchased from Aldrich. Sterilized round Petri plates were purchased from Tarsons (Calcutta, India). Tritrypticin and its analogs were synthesized by solid phase method using an automated peptide synthesizer Model 431A (Applied Biosystems Inc.) employing standard Fmoc methodology. The peptides were cleaved from the resin by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid/thioanisole/phenol/water/1,2-ethanedithiol in ratio as recommended by Applied Biosystems Inc. The crude peptides were purified using C-18 column (Deltapak-100Å, 15 μm spherical, 19 × 300 mm, Waters), and peptide purity was verified using C-18 analytical column (Deltapak-300Å, 15 μm, spherical, 7.8 × 300 mm, Waters). Elution of the peptides was accomplished with a linear gradient from 15 to 80% acetonitrile containing 0.1%trifluoroacetic acid over 30 min. Characterization was performed by molecular mass determination using single Quadruple mass analyzer (Fisons Instruments, Altrincham, UK). The radial diffusion assay was performed using double-layered agarose as described by Lehrer et al. (15Lehrer R.I. Rosenman M. Harwig S.S.S.L. Jachson R. Eisenhauer P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 137: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) with slight modification. Bacteria were grown overnight for 18 h at 37 °C in 10 ml of full strength (3% w/v) TSB; 10 μl of this culture was inoculated into 10 ml of fresh TSB and incubated for an additional 3 h at 37 °C to obtain midlogarithmic phase organisms. About 1 × 106 cells were then mixed with 1% agarose in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.02% Tween 20 and 0.03% TSB. The mixture was poured into round Petri plates after rapidly dispersing, and a 5-μl peptide sample was placed in each well made in the agarose and then incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. The overlay agar containing 1% agarose in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 3% TSB was then poured over it and further incubated at 37 °C for 18–24 h. The diameter of the clear zone surrounding the well was measured for the quantitation of inhibitory activities. The circular dichroism (CD) experiments were carried out on a JASCO 710 spectropolarimeter with 1.0 nm bandwidth at 0.1-nm resolution and 1 s response time using a 10-mm path-length cell. Typically, 20 scans at a speed of 200 nm/min were accumulated at 10 °C and averaged. The peptide concentrations used were 10 μm in water. Results were expressed as mean residue molar ellipticity in deg cm2/dmol. BLAST program (16Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol.

The BIOSYM software INSIGHTII (Biosym Technologies) was used on INDIGO2 workstation (Silicon Graphics) for model building, analysis, and display of structural data. Template-based peptide modeling was carried out using the HOMOLOGY module based on the coordinates of individual homologous sequences in the corresponding PDB files. The models were refined in AMBER force field (18Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. Nguyen D.T. Case D.A. J. Comput. Chem. 1986; 7: 230-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (3595) Google Scholar) using energy minimization. Distance-dependent dielectric constant was used, and no cross-term energies were included. The antibacterial activity of tritrypticin (SN13) against S. typhimurium and E. coli , determined by radial diffusion assay, is shown in Fig.1. The dose-dependent increase in the antibacterial activity of SN13 was evident in both the cases, although it is slightly more active against E. coli than S. typhimurium . These curves were used as reference for all the subsequent experiments designed to compare activities of the tritrypticin analogs. Activities of the analogs were assayed at 5 and 50 nmol as both these quantities fall into the linear region of the dose-dependent activity curve. It was observed that the comparative activities of the analogs inferred on the basis of inhibition zone area at 5 and 50 nmol are consistent with each other; therefore, data corresponding only to 5 nmol are given in subsequent comparisons of the activities of tritrypticin analogs. The shortest active fragment of SN13 was identified by synthesizing various deletion analogs and subjecting them to the antibacterial activity assay. Table I shows different analogs identified by their sequences and an internally consistent code defining each of these peptides. Activity of the peptide is given as the inhibition zone area at the peptide dose of 5 nmol as well as the relative activity (%) with reference to SN13. Behavior of various deletion analogs of tritrypticin appeared similar in the two bacterial strains. As shown in Table I, an analog with deletion of Val-1 (SN12) had activity comparable with that of SN13. Subsequent N-terminal deletions showed progressive decrease in the activity except in case of SN10, which seemed to show drastic reduction in activity to about 22% for S. typhimurium and 30% for E. coli . Further deletion of another residue (Phe-4) led to regaining of the activity (74% for S. typhimurium and 94% for E. coli ) in case of SN9. SN8 becomes the smallest active fragment of tritrypticin if those analogs with activity more than 50% of the native tritrypticin were defined as active.Table IComparison of antibacterial activities of the deletion analogs of tritrypticinPeptide codeSequenceArea in mm2(S.E.) at 5 nmol% inhibition (S.E.) at 5 nmolS. typhimuriumE. coliS. typhimuriumE. coliSN13VRRFPWWWPFLRR106.2 (12.4)143.9 (5.3)100.0 (11.6)100.0 (3.7)SN12RRFPWWWPFLRR109.1 (8.0)144.4 (5.6)102.7 (7.5)100.3 (3.9)SN11RFPWWWPFLRR85.3 (9.0)137.1 (1.8)80.3 (8.5)95.3 (1.3)SN10FPWWWPFLRR23.5 (1.5)42.8 (1.0)22.1 (1.4)29.7 (1.0)SN9PWWWPFLRR79.0 (4.4)135.4 (4.7)74.4 (4.1)94.1 (3.3)SN8WWWPFLRR60.1 (6.5)69.0 (3.6)56.6 (6.1)47.9 (2.5)SN7WWPFLRR16.0 (5.4)17.5 (1.7)15.1 (5.1)12.2 (1.2)SN6WPFLRR0.0 (0.0)5.8 (2.6)0.0 (0.0)4.0 (1.8)SYM11RRFPWWWPFRR144.4 (6.4)177.4 (10.2)135.9 (6.0)123.3 (7.1)CT7WWWPFRR78.4 (4.9)111.8 (3.1)73.8 (4.6)77.7 (2.2)NT7RRFPWWW88.0 (9.7)126.9 (8.8)82.9 (9.1)88.2 (6.1) Open table in a new tab The sequence of SN13 is somewhat symmetric, and deletion of Val-1 does not affect its activity. Therefore, it was expected that the deletion of Val-1 and Leu-11 in SN13, which makes it a perfectly symmetric peptide (SYM11) in terms of amino acid sequence, could also be active. It turned out that SYM11 was more active than the native peptide (TableI). Correspondingly, CT7, an analog of SN8 with deletion of Leu-6 was also showing comparatively more activity. The corresponding inversely equivalent N-terminal peptide (NT7) also showed high antibacterial activity (Table I). Thus, NT7 and CT7 are the minimal bioactive analogs of tritrypticin. The sequences of NT7 and CT7 are related, considering that they essentially represent two halves of a symmetric larger peptide. The design of their sequences is such that the two peptides are mirror images of each other. They both are made up of a central tripeptide sequence motif, aromatic-proline-aromatic (ArProAr), with two cationic residues on one side and two tryptophans on the other. The conformational preferences of the ArProAr sequence motif, common among these two almost equally active seven-residue peptides, were analyzed in PDB using XX ArProArXX as the search sequence, where X is any amino acid. The search using BLAST led to the identification of 45 unique 7-residue sequences incorporating this motif. The least square superimpositions of these seven-residue segments led to the identification of conformational clusters showing two distinct patterns. The backbone conformations of these segments were superimposed using the coordinates from the corresponding protein structures in PDB for each of the two groups. Group I consisted of 15 different segments having backbone torsion angles approximately corresponding to polyproline type II (PP II) conformation. The central five residues of these structures could be superimposed such that the corresponding Cα atoms overlap completely (Fig.2 A ). On the other hand, group II consisted of 13 segments exhibiting type III β-turn. The residues 3–6 could be superimposed in all these entries such that the Cα atoms overlap in this case as well (Fig.2 B ). The remaining 17 sequences were widely distributed such that they could not be classified into any major conformational cluster. The backbone torsion angles for group I and II were analyzed by help of the Ramachandran plot (Fig. 3). The φ and ϕ values of overlapping residues of the 7-residue segments in group II (Fig. 3 A ) and group I (Fig. 3 B ) were indicated on the Ramachandran plot. The residues 3, 4, and 5 in group I showed clustering around the average φ and ϕ values of −75°, +140° representing PP II conformation, and the residues 4 and 5 in group II showed clustering around the average φ and ϕ values of −60°, −30° representing type III β-turn. Because the β-turn is stabilized by an hydrogen bond, the spread in the backbone torsion angles in this case is less than in the case of PP II, which is an extended conformation. The PP II conformation also extends to the next residue on either side in majority of the cases among this group. The structural models for CT7 and NT7 were built using the template coordinates of segments in group I and II, respectively. The van der Waals surface drawings of these models, color-coded to indicate the hydropathy nature of the residues, are shown in Fig.4, A and B , respectively. There was a distinct clustering of the aromatic residues and the cationic residues in both these groups. However, the clustering was more prominent in group I, which forms PP II structure, compared with group II, which forms β-turn structure. Also, these clusters are spaced differently in groups I and II. The average distance between the center of gravity of the cationic cluster and that of the hydrophobic cluster was about 10 Å for β-turn structures and about 16 Å for PP II structures. In case of the other structures, which did not fall into either of the common patterns, such an obvious segregation could not be easily defined. The solution structures of the minimal bioactive analogs were investigated. The CD profiles of NT7 and CT7 in aqueous medium are shown in Fig.5. The profile in the 250–190-nm range suggested that the two analogs each have a definitive, although very different structure in solution. CT7 showed a mean residue molar ellipticity minima at 206 nm, characteristic of the PP II conformation. NT7, which has mirroring sequence with respect to CT7, showed a maximum at 212 nm that corresponds to β-turn conformation. Both these peptides exhibited a prominent CD signal at around 225 nm, which arises primarily from the interactions of the aromatic tryptophan residues (19Woody R.W. Hruby V.J. Circular Dichroism of Peptides in Peptides: Anal. Synth. Biol.7. Academic Press, Inc., London1985: 15-114Google Scholar). This signal showed a negative peak in the case of NT7 but an opposite, positive and equal peak at the same wavelength for CT7. The antibacterial activity of NT7 as well as CT7 decreased in the presence of Mg2+ (data not shown) as in case of tritrypticin (12Lawyer C. Pai S. Watabe M. Borgia P. Mashimo T. Eagleton L. Watabe K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), an observation suggested to represent functional measure of the cationic peptide antibiotics (2Hancock R.E.W. Lancet. 1997; 349: 418-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). Antibacterial activity of native tritrypticin was compared with that of different deletion analogs of SN13 to delineate the functional role of different N- and C-terminal residues (Table I and Fig.6 A ). As described earlier, deletion of a pair of N-terminal cationic residues (SN10) led to drastic loss in activity. Similarly, NT9, the peptide arising from deletion of the C-terminal cationic residues (RRFPWWWPF) also led to significant loss in activity. The deletion of Phe-1 in SN10 (leading to SN9) resulted in enhancement of activity compared with that of SN10. Substitution of all the arginines to lysines in the symmetric peptide SYM11 led to an analog (SYM11KK) with activity comparable with that of SYM11 and about 140% that of native tritrypticin. The CD profile of SN13 is shown in Fig. 6 B . The positive mean residue molar ellipticity at 212 nm suggests a characteristic β-turn conformation. In addition, there was distinct negative mean residue molar ellipticity at 225 nm arising from the interaction of the tryptophan side chain with the backbone involving nearest-neighbor residues. Thus, the predominant structural feature revealed by CD is a β-turn, although there was a small signal at 196 nm corresponding to an extended conformation. Fig. 6 B also shows the comparison of CD profiles of the deletion analogs SN10, SN9, SN8, and NT9 with that of native SN13. SN10 and NT9, which had negligible antibacterial activity, exhibited an enhanced β-turn signal with corresponding loss in the PP II component. However, SN9, which had regained activity compared with SN10 with deletion of N-terminal Phe, appears to exist as a combination/mixture of β-turn and PP II conformations. A complete transition of conformation from β-turn in the case of native peptide to PP II in the case of SN8 was observed with further deletion of a proline. The CD signal at 225 nm also changed sign in this case. The symmetric analog, SYM11, has enhanced β-turn character compared with SN13. Similarly, SYM11KK also exhibited CD profile similar to that of SYM11 (Fig. 6 C ). Both these peptides did not exhibit any minima in the region of 196–206 nm, perhaps indicating that they do not have any fraction of the structure in either extended or PP II conformation. The SN13 analogs, in which the tryptophan residues were substituted by either an aromatic residue (tyrosine) or a nonaromatic residue (serine), were analyzed to characterize the role of tryptophans in antibacterial activity and structural integrity. All the three tyrosine substituted analogs showed about 25% enhancement in the activity (Fig.7 A ). The analogs with nonaromatic substitution at any of the three positions were marginally more active than those substituted by tyrosine. The comparisons of the CD profiles of tyrosine- and serine-substituted analogs with that of SN13 are shown in Fig. 7, B and C , respectively. The substitution of Trp-8 → Tyr showed a decrease in the β-turn signal at 212 nm and appearance of a small signal at 206 nm. The 225-nm signal, however, did not change significantly. The substitution of Trp-7 → Tyr led to more pronounced changes. The β-turn signal at 212 nm completely disappeared, and the signal at 206 nm corresponding to PP II conformation became very prominent. The 225-nm signal corresponding to the interaction between tryptophan side chains and the backbone of aromatic residues in this case is almost negligible. The Trp-6 → Tyr substitution led to the conversion of conformation from β-turn to PP II in every respect. There is a significant negative mean residue molar ellipticity corresponding to PP II, a pronounced positive peak at 225 nm, and absolutely no signal corresponding to the β-turn. Similar but somewhat more prominent changes were observed in the analogs with serine substitutions for each of the tryptophan residues. Tritrypticin belongs to the class of cationic antibacterial peptides. Generally, the cationic peptides have two distinguishing features. These molecules are amphipathic, and they carry a net positive charge of at least +2 (2Hancock R.E.W. Lancet. 1997; 349: 418-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). The cationic peptide antibiotics are potent candidates for countering antibiotic resistance developed by the microbes against established antibiotics. Although there are inherent difficulties in exploiting peptidyl molecules as drug candidates (20Boman H.G. Marsh J. Goode J.A. Antimicrobial Peptides, CIBA Foundation Symposium. 186. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 1-283Google Scholar), they provide ideal templates for peptidomimetic design with enhanced half-life and potency while maintaining structure and specificity. The cationic antibacterial peptides show pronounced structural heterogeneity. The three-dimensional structures of at least one member of three different families of peptidyl antibiotics have been determined (21Holak T.A. Engstrom A. Kraulis P.J. Lindeberg G. Bennich H.

Genet. 1994; 20: 52-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As the functional specificity and mechanism of killing are obviously dependent on the three-dimensional structure and chemical nature of the peptide, diverse families of cationic antibacterial peptides are unlikely to adopt a common mechanism of action. The structural insights gained in the functional context could make tritrypticin among the most suitable candidates for peptidomimetic design. Tritrypticin is a pseudosymmetric molecule. Although it was suggested that the 13-residue tritrypticin is a processed antibiotic (12Lawyer C. Pai S. Watabe M. Borgia P. Mashimo T. Eagleton L. Watabe K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), alignment of the precursor sequence with other cathelicidin precursors implies that Val-1 in this sequence should correspond to the elastase cleavage site (11Pungercar J. Strukelj B. Kopitar G. Renko M. Lenarcic B. Turk F.G.V. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, Val-1 in tritrypticin probably has no functional role. The comparison of SN12 and SN13 activities confirmed this interpretation. A symmetric analog (SYM11) also shows enhanced antibacterial activity. Besides, NT7 and CT7 are both active and may correspond to two independent minimal functional domains. This would imply that the symmetric composite peptide SYM11 or the native SN13 are naturally designed to enhance activity by some sort of duplication. NT7 and CT7 are not entirely unrelated. Their sequences are retro with respect to each other. Another common feature of these two minimal bioactive peptides is the ArProAr motif incorporated within their sequences. A couple of other peptides having similar sequence features have also been shown to possess definitive structural folds (26Yao J. Feher V.A. Espejo B.F. Reymond M.T. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 736-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 27Kaur K.J. Khurana S. Salunke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5539-5543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Considering that both NT7 and CT7 are equally active, this common motif was critical in deriving the structural and functional features associated with their antibacterial activities. Pattern recognition in the protein structure data base led to the identification of two distinct conformational motifs, namely PP II and β-turn, for the ArProAr sequence motif. It can be inferred that the ArProAr sequence motif has an inherent structural preference for one of these two conformations. Although linear peptides of this size are normally observed to have multiple conformational populations in solution, the present case appears to be different. The structural motifs associated with the ArProAr sequence motif in PDB appear to have some additional sequence contraints imposed by the nature of residues downstream of the ArProAr sequence. The consensus in one of the two residues on the right side of ArProAr motif is a charged residue for the group I, which adopts PP II conformation. Similarly, consensus among the two residues at this position is hydrophobic in group II, which adopts β-turn conformation. Identification of the conformational patterns associated with specific sequence signatures is relevant in the context of protein design rules. The architectural design of proteins is such that a finite number of structural modules are used again and again in different contexts and combinations (28Richardson J.S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1981; 34: 167-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (3059) Google Scholar,29Efimov A.V. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Infinitely diverse overall topologies associated with equally diverse functions seem to have emerged from this clever design. Analyses of many such independent structural modules reveal that it is possible to define sequence signature of a motif by identifying certain invariant residues, which occur at equivalent positions in a consensus manner (30Rice P.A. Goldman A. Steitz T.A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 8: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 31Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1993; 366: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 32Chavali G.B. Nagpal S. Majumdar S.S. Singh O. Salunke D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 33Gupta H.M. Salunke D.M. Curr. Sci. (Bangalore). 1992; 62: 374-376Google Scholar). The two structural folds associated with their respective sequence signatures are the important addition to this library of structural modules. Two structural motifs derived from the patterns in protein structures are consistent with the solution conformations of the two minimal bioactive analogs. NT7, which exhibits β-turn conformation, has two hydrophobic residues following the ArProAr motif, and CT7, which shows PP II conformation, has two charged residues following the ArProAr motif, similar to the consensus feature observed in the protein data base. Both the conformations show clear amphipathic nature with the segregation of cationic residues and aromatic residues. However, the distance between these clusters is more in the case of the PP II conformation compared with the β-turn conformation. This may have direct implications to achieving complementarity vis àvis the receptor on the membrane. The ArProAr motif with similar structural preferences has been characterized in peptides among certain other contexts as well (26Yao J. Feher V.A. Espejo B.F. Reymond M.T. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 736-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 27Kaur K.J. Khurana S. Salunke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5539-5543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). One of the characteristic features of the CD profiles of tritrypticin analogs is the dichroic signal at about 225 nm, which is expected to arise because of the conformational environment of the tryptophan residue. The asymmetric indole derivative of the tryptophan side chain could lead to either positive or negative circular dichroic rotation depending on the backbone conformation in the immediate neighboring residues (19Woody R.W. Hruby V.J. Circular Dichroism of Peptides in Peptides: Anal. Synth. Biol.7. Academic Press, Inc., London1985: 15-114Google Scholar). All the analogs discussed in the present study have multiple tryptophan residues. It is evident that in some of them the mean residue molar ellipticity is positive, and in some others it is negative. However, there is a direct correlation of the sign of ellipticity at 225 nm with secondary structural characteristics. All the peptides with negative molar ellipticity at 225 nm have a distinct positive signal at 212 nm corresponding to β-turn. Similarly those peptides that exhibit positive mean residue molar ellipticity at 225 nm exhibit PP II structure as indicated by a negative signal at 206 nm. Thus, the characteristic circular dichroic signal arising from the aromatic side chain-peptide backbone interactions is also linked with the two distinct conformational states associated with this motif. Tritrypticin has a definitive structure in solution. There is a clear β-turn signal, but also, in addition, there is a small minimum corresponding to an extended structure in the CD profile of the native peptide. The minima corresponding to the extended structure began to shift toward PP II and appeared prominently as the residues from the N-terminal were sequentially deleted. The conformational features of the individual minimal functional domains of SN13, namely NT7 and CT7, have direct correlation with the conformation of tritrypticin. Obviously, the N-terminal domain of tritrypticin, which essentially corresponds to NT7, can be suggested to have a β-turn-fold, and the C-terminal domain, which primarily constitutes CT7, can be suggested to have PP II or extended conformation in the molecule. The three tryptophan residues, apparently important for structure as well as activity, are actually shared by both the domains. It is also evident that the charge and not the nature of the side chain is important for activity in the case of the terminal cationic residues. SN10 and NT9 may have some shielding effect of the terminal Phe residue while binding to the relevant membrane receptor, resulting in abnormally low activity. It is clear that the amphipathic nature of the peptide alone is not adequate for its activity, as the smaller amphipathic analogs were not active. Tritrypticin apparently undergoes a conformational transition while approaching the membrane receptor. The majority of the small bioactive peptides, which are not constrained through an intramolecular disulfide bridge, undergo a transition from an unstructured to a structured active form in the vicinity of the receptor (14Gupta H.M. Talwar G.P. Salunke D.M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1993; 16: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A disorder-order transition is involved in the activation of such peptides in most cases where the peptide does not indicate any preferred conformation. Tritrypticin is unique in that it adopts a well defined type III β-turn conformation in solution. The minimal functional analogs of tritrypticin, NT7 and CT7, show β-turn conformation and PP II conformation, respectively, and both are equally active. Many different single substitution analogs of tritrypticin show enhanced antibacterial activity accompanied by a change in conformation, from β-turn to PP II. It can therefore be inferred that the functional activation of tritrypticin may involve a transition from the solution conformation constituting a β-turn to the bioactive conformation, which is predominantly PP II type. The precise mechanism of bacterial killing by tritrypticin is not known. A diverse array of mechanisms by which other peptidyl antibiotics attack the bacterial cell have been proposed. Many cationic antibiotic peptides are suggested to be membrane-active and assemble forming channels (34Ludkte S.J. He K. Heller W.T. Harroun T.A. Yang L. Huang H.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13723-13728Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 35Falla T.J. Karunaratne D.N. Hancock R.E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19298-19303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Alternatively, certain peptides cluster at the membrane surface and cause a cooperative permeabilization by the carpet effect (36Shai Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 460-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). On the other hand, apidaecins function through a receptor-activated nonpore-forming mechanism involving stereospecificity (37Casteels P. Tempst P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The bactenecins are suggested to cause loss of macromolecular synthesis ability (38Skerlavaj B. Romeo D. Gennaro R. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3724-3730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The nonlytic PR-39 kills bacteria by interrupting both DNA and protein synthesis (39Boman H.G. Agerberth B. Boman A. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 2978-2984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA binding property of tachyplesin I has also been implicated in the antibiotic activity (40Yonezawa A. Kuwahara J. Fujii N. Sugiura Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2998-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The observed differences in the mechanism for bacterial killing appear to be consistent with the structural diversity among these molecules. However, the initial event common to all the cationic peptides is the binding of positively charged residues to the negatively charged molecules exposed at the target cell surface. The peptide antibiotics show differential activities against different bacterial strains, which may be related to the differences in the composition of the cell surface molecules. The tritrypticin and its minimal functional domains exhibit activity against at least two different Gram-negative bacteria. It does not necessarily imply that it would similarly work against any bacterial strain. The amphipathic structural design may be relevant for the specificity of tritrypticin. It may be achieved by clustering of the hydrophobic residues and cationic residues on its either side, appropriately distanced as in any PP II structure, such that it can match a complementary site on the receptor. Both the hydrophobic clustering and the electrostatic interactions accompanied by the relative flexibility in the peptide molecule would provide certain leeway within this specificity. In summary, tritrypticin has predominantly β-turn conformation in its N-terminal region and is designed by duplication to have enhanced activity involving two independent functional domains. More than half as active as tritrypticin, these domains are functionally equivalent but structurally very different from each other. As an initial event in bacterial killing, tritrypticin apparently undergoes functional activation through a conformational transition from β-turn to PP II while specifically binding to the negatively charged receptor exposed at the target bacterial membrane. The specificity of tritrypticin binding to the membrane surface may be achieved by the appropriate juxtaposition of the hydrophobic residues and the cationic residues so as to match a complementary site on the receptor.

In addition to phagocytosing and killing bacterial and fungal cells, they play key roles in the innate immune process by which animals recognize invading microbes. They react to conserved microbial molecules, such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide, by releasing mediators that amplify and diversify the host inflammatory response. They are also major cellular sources of the leukotrienes, potent agonists for chemotaxis, smooth muscle contraction, and cell cycle stimulation (proliferation). Microbial recognition is mediated by a multistep process in which mCD14,1 a 55-kDa glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane protein, is thought to play an important role by binding bacterial lipopolysaccharide and other ligands to the plasma membrane. In addition to its key role in antimicrobial host defense, CD14 may be an important lipid transfer protein. Soluble CD14, which lacks the GPI anchor, can transfer several lipids to plasma lipoproteins or artificial lipid membranes (1Wurfel M.M. Hailman E. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1743-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 2Yu B. Hailman E. Wright S.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and mCD14 is a receptor for phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) and phosphatidylserine (3Wang P.-Y. Kitchens R.L. Munford R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24309-24313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We recently reported that binding PtdIns and phosphatidylserine to mCD14 is facilitated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), a molecule that, like PtdIns, is found in plasma (3Wang P.-Y. Kitchens R.L. Munford R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24309-24313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). PtdIns is an important precursor of numerous signaling molecules (diacylglycerol, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and various phosphatidylinositides) and a potential source of arachidonic acid (the precursor of prostaglandins and leukotrienes). It is also incorporated into the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors used by many membrane proteins. We therefore asked whether extracellular, mCD14-bound PtdIns is utilized by the cells. We show here that mCD14-bound extracellular PtdIns is rapidly internalized to an intracellular compartment where, upon cell activation, it can be acted upon by cytosolic phospholipase A2. The arachidonate released from PtdIns then has several fates, including conversion to HETEs and leukotriene B4(LTB4), but not to prostaglandins E2 or F2α, and secretion from the cell. 1-Stearoyl-2-[14C]arachidonyl-phosphatidylinositol (26.7 or 48 mCi/mmol), [3H]arachidonic acid (212 Ci/mmol), andl-A-[myo-inositol-2-3H]phosphatidylinositol (6.6 Ci/mmol) were from NEN Life Science Products (Boston, MA). Arachidonic acid, prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2α, 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid, 5-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid, diacylglycerol, triarachidonate, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and cholesteryl oleate were purchased from Sigma. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3(VD3), leukotriene B4, MK-886, ibuprofen, and MAFP were from Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (Bacillus cereus ) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Newborn calf serum (Sigma) was delipidated by ultracentrifugation at ρ = 1.3 g/ml (KBr) and then dialyzed against normal saline. After delipidation, it contained 38 mg/liter cholesterol, 27 mg/liter triglyceride, and 5.2 g/liter protein. Phospholipids were dried under argon and resuspended by sonication (400 watts, three pulses of 30 s each; Braunsonic 1510 sonicator; B. Braun, Melsungen AG) in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. For most of the experiments, the resuspended lipids were then added to RPMI 1640 medium that contained 10% lipoprotein-poor newborn calf serum. Human monocytic THP-1 cells (4Tsuchiya S. Yamabe M. Yamaguchi Y. Kobayashi Y. Konno T. Tada K. Int. J. Cancer. 1980; 26: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar) were obtained, cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum, and transfected to express wild-type human CD14 (CD14-GPI) as described previously (5Kitchens R.L. Wang P.-Y. Munford R.S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5534-5545PubMed Google Scholar). The human myeloid HL-60 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in the same medium. Before the experiments, HL-60 cells were differentiated into monocyte-like cells by adding 100 nm VD3 for 5 days. Human monocytes were kindly provided by David Wilkinson (The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). To label cellular lipids, [3H]arachidonic acid was added to the culture medium (0.5 μCi/ml) for 24 h before each experiment. HL-60 cells were labeled on the fourth day of VD3treatment. 1 volume of cell suspension was added to 6 volumes of methanol/chloroform/acetic acid (2:1:0.01, v/v). After incubating with frequent mixing for 1 h at room temperature, 3 volumes of 0.05 m KCl were added. After vortexing, 2 volumes of chloroform were added. The sample was vortexed again and then centrifuged for 5 min at ∼700 × g . The organic phase was collected, and the sample was re-extracted with 3 volumes of chloroform. The combined organic phases were dried under argon, and the lipids were resuspended in chloroform/methanol (1:1). The lipids were separated on Silica Gel G plates (J.T. Baker, Inc., Phillipsburg, NJ or Whatman, Inc., Clifton, NJ) using solvent A (chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water, 10:4:3:2:1) or, for better separation of eicosanoids, solvent B (the upper (organic) phase of ethyl acetate/isooctane/acetic acid/water (55:25:10:50)) (6Flower R.J. Blackwell G.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1975; 25: 285-291Crossref Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 7Bailey J.M. Hla T. Muza B. Pash J. Bailey J.M. Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes, and Lipoxins. Plenum Press, New York and London1984: 148-156Google Scholar). Bands were identified by fluorography or phosphorimager, and those that co-migrated with lipid standards were scraped and added to scintillation fluid for radioactivity counting. TypicalRf values of compounds separated in solvent B were as follows: (a ) triglyceride, 0.83; (b ) diacylglycerol, 0.73; (c ) arachidonate, 0.66; (d ) 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid, 0.59; (e ) 5-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid, 0.48; (f ) LTB4, 0.39; (g ) prostaglandin E2, 0.20; and (e ) prostaglandin F2α, 0.10; phospholipids remained at the origin. Lipids that migrated in a band with Rf = 0.45–0.49 were considered “HETE-like.” [3H]PtdIns, labeled to high specific activity in the inositol moiety, was used to measure PtdIns internalization by CD14-expressing THP-1 cells (8Wongkajornsilp A. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9147-9153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A trace amount of [3H]PtdIns was mixed with [14C]PtdIns, dried under argon, and then resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium. The PtdIns concentration was estimated by counting the [14C]PtdIns because the [3H]PtdIns mass was negligible. GPI-CD14 THP-1 cells were washed twice in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium, resuspended in either serum-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, or SEBDAF buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 1mm EDTA, 2 mm NaF, 300 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm NaN3, 5 mmdeoxyglucose) (to block ligand internalization by depleting ATP stores) (9Kirkland T.N. Finley F. Leturcq D. Moriarty A. Lee J.-D. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24818-24823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at 7–8 × 106 cells/ml, and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. To measure the effect of cytochalasin D on PtdIns internalization, different concentrations of cytochalasin D were added to the assay medium before incubation. [3H]/[14C]PtdIns vesicles (1 μm, final concentration) prepared as described above were added to 50 μl of the cell suspension in the presence or absence of recombinant LBP (0.1 μg/ml), and the incubation was continued at 37 °C. At each time point, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline by low-speed centrifugation. The cells were then suspended in 50 μl of ice-cold RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.2 unit/ml PI-PLC and incubated on ice for 2 h. After 150 μl of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline were added to the cell suspension, the cells were pelleted, and the 3H in the supernatant and the cell pellet was counted. PI-PLC can remove both GPI-CD14 (and thus CD14-bound PtdIns) and the inositol-phosphate moiety of PtdIns from the cell surface. The cell-associated, PI-PLC-resistant 3H in the SEBDAF-treated cells was subtracted from that in the RPMI 1640 medium-incubated cells to obtain an estimate of the internalized [3H]PtdIns at each time point. Cell viability, as assessed by trypan blue exclusion, was >85% for both RPMI 1640 medium- and SEBDAF-incubated cells. GPI-CD14-transfected THP-1 cells or VD3-differentiated HL-60 cells (2–5 × 106) were suspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. When indicated, recombinant LBP-containing medium or control medium (10% of the total volume) (3Wang P.-Y. Kitchens R.L. Munford R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24309-24313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) was used (final LBP concentration, approximately 0.07 μg/ml). To examine the role of GPI-CD14 in mediating arachidonate release, 5–10% lipoprotein-poor newborn calf serum was added to the medium to provide LBP, and 30 μg/ml anti-CD14 mAb (60bca or 1H3) (3Wang P.-Y. Kitchens R.L. Munford R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24309-24313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) or isotype-matched IgG was incubated with the cells for 10–20 min on ice before adding [14C]PtdIns. The cells were incubated with 3–5 μm [14C]PtdIns for 5–20 min at 37° C, primed with TNF-α (100 ng/ml) or PMA (100 nm) for 15 min at 37 °C, and finally stimulated with 1–2 μm A23187 for 5–30 min at 37° C. After stimulation, the cells were chilled and pelleted by centrifugation. Both the supernatant and cell pellet were immediately subjected to lipid extraction as described above. To compare the fate of arachidonate derived from exogenous [14C]arachidonyl-PtdIns with that of endogenous cellular arachidonate, the cells were labeled overnight with [3H]arachidonate. PLA2 inhibitor LY311727 (secretory PLA2 inhibitor) (10Schevitz R.W. Bach N.J. Carlson D.G. Chirgadze N.Y. Clawson D.K. Dillard R.D. Draheim S.E. Hartley L.W. Wery J.-P. Nat. Struct.

After TLC analysis, the3H and 14C in the arachidonate bands were counted to determine the arachidonate derived from exogenous [14C]PtdIns or endogenous 3H-lipids. VD3-differentiated HL-60 cells were used to study the specific metabolism of arachidonate derived from extracellular [14C]PtdIns. The cellular lipids were labeled with [3H]arachidonic acid as described above. When desired, inhibitors of 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (inhibitor MK-886) or cyclooxygenase (ibuprofen) were added to the cells for 10 min at 37 °C before adding [14C]PtdIns. After priming with 100 nm PMA for 15 min at 37 °C and stimulating with 2 μm A23187 for 30 min, the cells were pelleted, and lipids were extracted from the medium and cells. The lipids were separated by TLC using solvent B, and the bands that co-migrated with each standard were scraped and counted. Specific binding of extracellular PtdIns to mCD14 was accomplished by adding PtdIns to mCD14-expressing cells in the presence of recombinant LBP or serum (3Wang P.-Y. Kitchens R.L. Munford R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24309-24313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Alternatively, in some experiments, PtdIns-mCD14 binding was inhibited by pre-incubating the cells with an anti-CD14 mAb. When desired, PtdIns internalization was blocked by incubating the cells in SEBDAF buffer to deplete ATP stores; cell-associated PtdIns under these conditions was assumed to be bound to the cell surface. In preliminary experiments, we found that [14C]PtdIns binding to mCD14-expressing cells occurs in 10% fetal bovine serum and that binding is substantially higher when the serum has been depleted of lipoproteins (Fig. 1). Pre-incubating labeled PtdIns in normal serum greatly inhibited PtdIns binding to both mCD14-expressing and mock-transfected THP-1 cells; however, specific binding was still observed (in three independent experiments, 6- to 8-fold more PtdIns bound to mCD14-expressing cells than to mock-transfected cells). Pre-incubating [14C]PtdIns in lipoprotein-poor serum was less inhibitory, suggesting that much of the PtdIns added to normal serum binds to lipoproteins. For many experiments we used 10% lipoprotein-poor newborn calf serum to provide both a source of LBP and a more physiological medium for the studies. The serum proteins also bound secreted radiolabeled lipids and prevented their re-uptake by the cells. We found that phosphatidyl-[3H]inositol that binds to mCD14 quickly becomes inaccessible to cleavage by extracellular PI-PLC. Loss of surface accessibility did not occur in metabolically poisoned cells, and PtdIns that bound to cell surface molecules other than mCD14 remained largely on the cell surface (Fig.2). Loss of surface accessibility thus required both the expenditure of energy and binding to mCD14. Cytochalasin D inhibited mCD14-mediated PtdIns disappearance from the cell surface by approximately 80% (Fig.3), suggesting that the actin cytoskeleton is involved in PtdIns internalization and arguing that the loss of surface accessibility is not simply due to the movement of PtdIns within the plasma membrane so that its headgroup is no longer surface-exposed.Figure 3Cytochalasin D inhibits mCD14-dependent PtdIns internalization.mCD14-expressing THP-1 cells were incubated with cytochalasin D or SEBDAF buffer for 30 min at 37 °C as indicated. Vesicles containing phosphatidyl-[3H]inositol were then added in the presence or absence of recombinant LBP, and incubation was continued for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were then chilled, washed, treated with PI-PLC, and pelleted by centrifugation. A , the PI-PLC-resistant, cell-associated 3H dpm are shown. Cytochalasin D inhibited only LBP-dependent (mCD14-mediated) PtdIns internalization, reducing it almost to background (SEBDAF buffer) levels.

Priming the cells for 15 min with PMA or TNF-α increased [14C]arachidonate release above that observed after A23187 treatment alone. When labeled PtdIns bound mCD14, arachidonate release occurred more promptly and to a greater extent than when it bound other surface molecules (Fig.5, A, B, and D). In contrast, a mAb that blocked PtdIns-mCD14 binding had no effect on the stimulus-induced release of [3H]arachidonate from the endogenous cellular pool (Fig. 5 C ).Figure 5mCD14 ( LBP )-dependent release of arachidonate from exogenous PtdIns . A , mCD14-expressing THP-1 cells were incubated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 5% (v/v) lipoprotein-poor serum with anti-CD14 mAb 1H3 or isotype control IgG2b for 20 min on ice. 1-Stearoyl-2-[14C]arachidonyl-PtdIns (3 μm) was then allowed to bind to the cells for 20 min at 37 °C. After exposing the cells to TNF-α (100 ng/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C, calcium ionophore A23187 (1 μm) was added, and incubation was continued for the indicated time periods. The cells were chilled and pelleted by centrifugation. The cells and the medium supernatants were extracted, and the [14C]arachidonate in the organic phase was quantitated by TLC and scintillation counting. Agonist-induced [14C]arachidonate release into the medium was greatly inhibited by the anti-CD14 antibody. Similar results were found in three additional experiments and when the cells were primed with PMA instead of TNF-α. Note that essentially all of the free [14C]arachidonate was found in the medium. B , 1-stearoyl-2-[14C]arachidonyl-PtdIns (3 μm) was incubated with mCD14-expressing THP-1 cells in the presence or absence of LBP for 20 min at 37 °C. After exposure to PMA (100 nm) for 15 min at 37 °C, the cells were treated (or not treated) with calcium ionophore A23187 (1 μm) for 5 min, chilled, and pelleted by centrifugation. Each medium supernatant was extracted with chloroform-methanol-acetic acid, and the free [14C]arachidonate was quantitated by TLC and scintillation counting. The bars show the average fold increase (A23187-treated divided by untreated) in medium [14C]arachidonate ± 1 S.E. for five independent experiments. Stimulus-induced arachidonate release was significantly greater when the cells bound PtdIns via mCD14. C andD , HL-60 cells were treated with calcitriol (100 nm) for 5 days. On the fourth day, [3H]arachidonate (0.5 μCi/ml) was added to label the cellular lipids. On day 5, the cells were washed and suspended in RPMI 1640 medium that contained 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10% lipoprotein-poor serum, and either anti-CD14 mAb 60bca or isotype control murine IgG1. After incubation for 10 min on ice, 1-stearoyl-2-[14C]arachidonyl-PtdIns (4 μm) was allowed to bind to the cells for 5 min at 37 °C. 100 nm PMA was added, incubation was continued for 15 min at 37 °C, and A23187 was added for the indicated times. Lipids were extracted from the entire incubation mixture, separated by TLC, and quantitated by scintillation counting. Pre-treatment with the anti-CD14 mAb blocked the release of [14C]arachidonate from exogenous PtdIns (D ) but had no effect on the release of endogenous [3H]arachidonate (C ). The experiment was repeated three times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next tested the ability of two selective phospholipase A2 inhibitors to block [14C]arachidonate release from mCD14-acquired exogenous PtdIns. MAFP, a selective inhibitor of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (12Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), effectively blocked [14C]arachidonate release from mCD14-acquired PtdIns (Fig. 6). In contrast, the highly selective inhibitor of secretory PLA2 (10Schevitz R.W. Bach N.J. Carlson D.G. Chirgadze N.Y. Clawson D.K. Dillard R.D. Draheim S.E. Hartley L.W. Wery J.-P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 458-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), LY311727, had little effect. The ID50 for MAFP on arachidonate release from mCD14-acquired PtdIns (<2.5 μm) was slightly lower than its ID50 for the release of arachidonate from endogenous cellular stores (Fig. 6). Similar findings were obtained using another human leukocyte cell line, HL-60 (Fig.7), and normal human peripheral blood monocytes (data not shown). The data suggest that arachidonate release from mCD14-acquired exogenous PtdIns is mediated principally by cytosolic PLA2.Figure 7Metabolic fates of arachidonate derived from mCD14-acquired PtdIns and intracellular stores. HL-60 cells were treated with VD3 for 5 days; on the fourth day, [3H]arachidonate was added to label the cellular lipids. The labeled cells were washed and incubated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 10% lipoprotein-poor serum. Anti-CD14 mAb 60bca (30 μg/ml), MAFP (20 μm), LY311727 (20 μm), ibuprofen (100 μm), or MK-886 (20 μm) was added for 10 min at 37 °C. 1-Stearoyl-2-[14C]arachidonyl-PtdIns (4 μm) was then allowed to bind to the cells for 5 min at 37 °C. After priming with 100 nm PMA for 15 min, the cells were treated with A23187 (2 μm) for 30 min. The cells were pelleted, and lipids were extracted from the supernatants and separated by TLC.3H- and 14C-containing bands that co-migrated with the indicated standards were scraped, and the radioactivity was quantitated by scintillation counting. The A23187-stimulated release of each compound was expressed as the percentage of the labeled arachidonate released from control (stimulated, no inhibitor added) cells in the same experiment. Values from primed but unstimulated cells were subtracted. In five experiments, 26,814 ± 26,075 (range, 10,227–72,422) 3H dpm and 187 ± 76 (range, 110–241)14C dpm were released after the activation of control cells. Each bar represents the average ± S.E. of three to five independent experiments.

Asterisks indicate significant differences from vehicle-only control (analysis of variance, p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then compared the fate of mCD14-acquired [14C]arachidonate (from extracellular PtdIns) with that of endogenously labeled [3H]arachidonate. Essentially no free [3H]arachidonate was found in unstimulated HL-60 cells (data not shown), and the free [3H]arachidonate released from [3H]arachidonate-labeled cellular lipids was almost entirely (>90%) secreted into the culture medium. Of the other3H-lipids recovered in the medium, [3H]triglyceride was the most abundant (Fig.7 A ), although it represented less than 10% of the total cellular [3H]triglyceride (data not shown). The ability of the 5-lipoxygenase activating protein inhibitor MK-886 to diminish the amount of released [3H]triglyceride is consistent with the reported esterification of [3H]arachidonate-derived HETE into triglyceride after ionophore stimulation of neutrophils (13Stenson W.F. Parker C.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 64: 1457-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and it suggests that most of the [3H]triglyceride secreted by the HL-60 cells was newly synthesized. As expected, ibuprofen significantly inhibited the conversion of endogenous arachidonate to prostaglandin E2. In contrast, the 14C in the [14C]arachidonate cleaved from mCD14-acquired PtdIns was incorporated into cellular triglyceride (data not shown), or it was released from the cells as arachidonate, HETEs, or LTB4 (Fig. 7 B ). Negligible conversion to prostaglandins or retention in the cells as free [14C]arachidonate was detected (14Kuwae T. Schmid P.C. Johnson S.B. Schmid H.H.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5002-5007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, MAFP and anti-CD14 mAb 60bca blocked the release of [14C]arachidonate from PtdIns as well as its conversion to leukotrienes, MK-886 inhibited [14C]arachidonate conversion to HETEs and LTB4, and ibuprofen and LY311727 had no effect on these metabolic steps. The fates of the PtdIns-derived extracellular [14C]arachidonate and the [3H]arachidonate from the cellular pool were thus strikingly different. Whereas less than 10% of the secreted 3H was found in 5-lipoxygenase metabolites, over half of the 14C was in HETEs or LTB4. The findings suggest that mCD14 targets PtdIns-derived arachidonate to intracellular sites at which rapid and selective metabolism by 5-lipoxygenase can occur. Although arachidonic acid is an essential fatty acid, it is highly active toward cells. Perhaps for this reason, essentially no free arachidonate is transported in the blood or found in cells. Instead, arachidonate is both carried and stored in phospholipids (14Kuwae T. Schmid P.C. Johnson S.B. Schmid H.H.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5002-5007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although alkenyl-arachidonyl phosphatidylethanolamine is the most arachidonate-enriched lipid in plasma, over 50% of the PtdIns molecules in plasma contain sn -2 arachidonate (15Myher J.J. Kuksis A. Pind S. Lipids. 1989; 24: 408-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 16Breckenridge W.C. Palmer F.B.S.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 712: 707-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Normal plasma contains approximately 50–100 μm PtdIns, most of which is bound to lipoproteins (17Cunnane S.C. Ho S.-Y. Dore-Duffy P. Ells K.R. Horrobin D.F Am. J. Ind. Med. 1989; 50: 801-806Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18Bagdade J.D. Buchanan W.F. Pollare T. Lithell H. Atherosclerosis. 1995; 117: 209-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 19Bradamante S. Barchiesi E. Barenghi L. Zoppi F. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 185: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Little is known about its sources or about how it is taken up and utilized by cells. In addition to providing a potential source of arachidonate to the cells that acquire it, PtdIns also is the precursor of several signaling phosphatidylinositides, diacylglycerol, and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Leukocytes can synthesize PtdIns from inositol and CDP-diacylglycerol, yet de novo PtdIns biosynthesis is thought to occur very slowly (20Catz S.D. Speziale E.H. Sterin-Speziale N.B. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 1998; 55: 245-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Having a mechanism for acquiring extracellular PtdIns may thus endow mCD14-expressing cells with the ability to supplement their existing PtdIns and arachidonate stores. In keeping with this notion, incubation with liposomes containing PtdIns suppressed stimulus-induced PtdIns turnover (biosynthesis) in mouse macrophages (21Wassef N.M. Roerdink F. Richardson E.C. Alving C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2655-2659Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Approximately one-fourth of the extracellular PtdIns that bound to mCD14 on THP-1 cells was rapidly internalized. Although the internalization mechanism is not known, another mCD14-binding ligand, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, is largely internalized via non-coated plasma membrane invaginations and membrane-derived vesicles (5Kitchens R.L. Wang P.-Y. Munford R.S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5534-5545PubMed Google Scholar) with a time course that resembles that found here. Although we have not tried to study the fate of PtdIns that binds PtdIns receptors such as SR-BI and CD36 (22Rigotti A. Acton S.L. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16221-16224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), extracellular PtdIns that bound to cell surface molecules other than MCO14 on THP-1 cells was internalized very slowly (Figs. 2 B and 3 A ), and it was a relatively poor source of secreted arachidonate (Fig. 5, A, B , andD ). Platelets can also take up and metabolize extracellular phospholipids (23Engelmann B. Schaipp B. Dobner P. Stoeckelhuber M. Hermetter A. Siess W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27800-27808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 24Dobner P. Engelmann B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E777-E784PubMed Google Scholar). Although the uptake mechanism has not been defined, transfer of phosphatidylethanolamine from plasma lipoproteins to platelets increases after thrombin stimulation, and arachidonate derived from the exogenous phosphatidylethanolamine can be metabolized to HETE and thromboxane in a stimulus-dependent manner (23Engelmann B. Schaipp B. Dobner P. Stoeckelhuber M. Hermetter A. Siess W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27800-27808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). There is also a precedent for cellular uptake of extracellular PtdIns. When extracellular PtdIns was delivered to Friend erythroleukemia cells via PtdIns transfer protein, it did not undergo conversion to phosphorylated metabolites, whereas spontaneously incorporated PtdIns was both phosphorylated to PtdIns-4-phosphate and deacylated (25Hohengasser C.J.M. Thornburg J.T. van Paridon P.A. van der Schaft P. Wirtz K.W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6255-6259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, both free arachidonate and cholesterol-arachidonate can be taken up by cells. When resting monocytes take up low-density lipoprotein that contains cholesterol-[14C]arachidonate, they use the arachidonate for prostaglandin synthesis (26Salbach P.B. Specht E. von Hodenberg E. Kossmann J. Janssen-Timmen U. Schneider W.J. Hugger P. King W.C. Glomset J.A. Habenicht A.J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2439-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation with A23187, however, they convert some of the low-density lipoprotein-derived [14C]arachidonate into LTB4 and leukotriene C4. Free [14C]arachidonate can also be converted to leukotrienes after ionophore stimulation (26Salbach P.B. Specht E. von Hodenberg E. Kossmann J. Janssen-Timmen U. Schneider W.J. Hugger P. King W.C. Glomset J.A. Habenicht A.J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2439-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Compartmentalization of lipids in leukocyte membranes occurs in at least two known ways. First, lipid-rich domains exist in the plasma membrane; because mCD14 can be found in low-density fragments of the THP-1 plasma membrane (27Wang P.-Y. Kitchens R.L. Munford R.S. J. Inflammation. 1996; 47: 126-137Google Scholar), it is interesting to note that the conversion of PtdIns to PtdIns-4-phosphate is thought to occur in such domains (28Waugh M.G. Lawson D. Tan S.K. Hsuan J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17115-17121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Whether mCD14-acquired PtdIns can be phosphorylated to PIP or PIP2 is presently unknown. Second, leukocytes can accumulate arachidonate-rich lipids into discrete intracellular organelles called lipid bodies (29Bozza P.T. Payne J.L. Morham S.G. Langenbach R. Smithies O. Weller P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11091-11096Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 30Yu W.G. Bozza P.T. Tzizik D.M. Gray J.P. Cassara J. Dvorak A.M. Weller P.F. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 759-769PubMed Google Scholar). However, PtdIns is only a minor component of these bodies, and we were unable to show that extracellular PtdIns or PtdIns-derived arachidonate co-localizes with lipid bodies in THP-1 cells, at least in short-term experiments. 2P.-Y. Wang, unpublished observations. The data in Fig. 6 suggest that exogenous PtdIns is a substrate for cytosolic PLA2. Although this enzyme is thought to act at various sites within the cytosol, including the nuclear envelope and the inner surface of the plasma membrane, exogenous PtdIns would presumably have to flip within the membrane before it could be accessible to cytosolic PLA2 attack. Although the existence of such a “flippase” has been postulated by analogy to the aminophospholipid transporter, its presence has not been established. Approximately 3% of the [14C]arachidonate in mCD14-acquired [14C]arachidonyl-PtdIns was cleaved after cell stimulation (data not shown). Similarly, 1–3% of the cellular [3H]arachidonate was released from phospholipid storage after stimulation. If one assumes that 20% of the mCD14-acquired PtdIns is internalized (Fig. 2) and that it is the internalized fraction that is cleaved by PLA2, approximately 15% of the internalized PtdIns is attacked by PLA2. These calculations are obviously approximate, yet they suggest that the arachidonate in mCD14-acquired PtdIns may be more susceptible to PLA2cleavage than the arachidonate in the endogenous cellular lipid pool. Finding that the arachidonate contained in mCD14-acquired PtdIns undergoes stimulus-induced conversion to HETEs is consistent with previous observations on the fate of endogenous arachidonate in human neutrophils (13Stenson W.F. Parker C.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 64: 1457-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and HL-60 cells (31Bennett C.F. Chiang M.-Y. Monia B.P. Crooke S.T. Biochem J. 1993; 289: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Differentiation of HL-60 cells with VD3 may actually enhance this conversion because VD3 treatment greatly increases 5-lipoxygenase activity in these cells (31Bennett C.F. Chiang M.-Y. Monia B.P. Crooke S.T. Biochem J. 1993; 289: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Because conversion of arachidonate to leukotrienes by 5-lipoxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein is thought to occur on the nuclear membrane or in the endoplasmic reticulum (32Rouzer C.A. Kargman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10980-10988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Brock T.G. McNish R.W. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21652-21658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), our results suggest that extracellular PtdIns, or arachidonate derived from it, can move to these sites. Other mCD14-bound ligands have been reported to traffic within monocytes (5Kitchens R.L. Wang P.-Y. Munford R.S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5534-5545PubMed Google Scholar, 34Thieblemont N. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 2095-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Leukotriene biosynthesis occurs principally in myeloid cells, which require leukotrienes for effective phagocytosis and microbial killing (35Bailie M.B. Standiford T.J. Laichalk L.L. Coffey M.J. Strieter R.M. Peters-Golden M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5221-5224PubMed Google Scholar, 36Mancuso P. Standiford T.J. Marshall T. Peters-Golden M. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 5140-5146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In A23187-stimulated human neutrophils, the major source of arachidonate used for leukotriene biosynthesis is 1-ether-linked phospholipids (37Chilton F.H. Biochem J. 1989; 258: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), whereas endogenous PtdIns is a relatively minor source. In keeping with our results, Chilton (37Chilton F.H. Biochem J. 1989; 258: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) reported that a very small fraction of the arachidonate released from endogenous neutrophil lipids is converted to leukotrienes. In striking contrast, we found that over half of the 14C-lipid secreted by cells that had taken up [14C]arachidonyl-PtdIns via mCD14 were HETE-like molecules or LTB4. Although these results do not reveal the contribution that exogenously acquired PtdIns makes to overall monocyte PtdIns content or to total signal-induced arachidonate or leukotriene release, they do indicate that the fate of the arachidonate derived from mCD14-acquired PtdIns is very different from that of the arachidonate in the bulk cellular pool. The arachidonate derived from extracellular PtdIns may be selectively targeted for leukotriene production. Therefore, it may not be coincidental that some of the major cells that produce leukotrienes (monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils) are cells that constitutively express mCD14; mCD14 may provide these highly active blood cells with access to a source of arachidonate that can rapidly contribute to leukotriene biosynthesis.

Ho for delipidated newborn calf serum, Chris Vesy for antibodies, Jerrold Weiss for helpful advice, and Leon Eidels and Mark Lehrman for improving the manuscript."

Parathyroid hormone (PTH), a calcium-regulating hormone, and parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), which shares several properties with PTH, have profound effects on skeletal growth and new bone formation. In order to define further the mechanism by which PTH/PTHrP promotes the cartilage phenotype, chondrocytes isolated from the rib cages of developing rat embryos were evaluated for the biosynthesis of aggrecan. Cells treated with PTH-(1–34) for a 4-h period followed by a 20-h recovery period showed a significant increase in cartilage proteoglycan (aggrecan) synthesis in a dose-dependent manner. Only N-terminally intact PTH and PTHrP were effective in stimulating aggrecan synthesis. Addition of a neutralizing antibody to insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) during PTH treatment resulted in the inhibition of PTH-stimulated aggrecan synthesis, whereas the addition of a neutralizing antibody to insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2) resulted in an increase in synthesis in both the control and PTH-treated cells. In addition, PTH treatment resulted in an increase in the mRNA for aggrecan, a reduction in IGFBP-3 mRNA, and no discernible changes in IGF-I mRNA levels, which was complemented by quantitative changes in IGFBP-3 and free IGF-I levels. The reciprocal relationship in the expression of aggrecan and IGFBP was further confirmed in chondrocytes from various gestational stages during normal development. Collectively, our results indicate that the effect of PTH may be mediated at least in part through the regulation of the IGF/IGFBP axis, by a decrease in the level of IGFBP-3, and an increase in free IGF-I levels. It is likely that the local increase in IGF-I may lead to an increase in cartilage type proteoglycan synthesis and maintenance of the cartilage phenotype. The consequence of the prolonged maintenance may be to halt mineralization while a new scaffolding is created. During endochondral bone formation, the growth plate chondrocytes proliferate, become hypertrophic, lose the cartilage phenotype, undergo mineralization, and provide a scaffold upon which subsequent longitudinal bone growth occurs.

The consequence of the prolonged maintenance may be to halt mineralization while a new scaffolding is created. parathyroid hormone parathyroid hormone-related peptide insulin-like growth factor-I insulin-like growth factor binding protein polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propane sulfonate Endochondral bone formation is associated with a cascade of events that include condensation of undifferentiated mesenchyme, the subsequent differentiation of the core of the limb buds into cartilage, and maturation of chondrocytes into hypertrophic cells leading to new bone formation (1Reddi A.H. Piez K.A. Reddi A.H. Extracellular Matrix Biochemistry. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1984: 375-412Google Scholar, 2Erlebacher A. Filvaroff E.H. Gitelman S.E. Derynck R. Cell. 1995; 80: 371-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Thus, chondrocytes play a crucial role in bone formation, both by promoting the growth of the skeletal elements as well as by providing a scaffold upon which new bone is laid down. The differentiation of cells into discrete cell types is associated with the synthesis of a unique set of matrix molecules that characterize the differentiation stage of the cells and which may further influence subsequent differentiation processes (1Reddi A.H. Piez K.A. Reddi A.H. Extracellular Matrix Biochemistry. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1984: 375-412Google Scholar). Chondrocytes from various regions of the growth plate exhibit morphological and functional differences that are characterized by distinct matrix molecules (3Ali S.Y. Hall B.K. Calcification of Cartilage. 1. Academic Press, New York1983: 343-378Google Scholar, 4Byers S. van Rooden J.C. Foster B.K. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1997; 60: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Improper assembly and organization of the growth plate leads to chondrodysplasias that are associated with skeletal abnormalities (5Rimoin D.L. Lachman R.S. Emery A.E. Rimoin D.L. Principles and Practice of Medical Genetics. Churchill Livingstone, Edinburgh, Scotland1983: 703-735Google Scholar). Multiple autocrine, endocrine, and paracrine factors have been shown to influence endochondral bone formation (6Canalis E. Centrella M. Burch W. McCarthy T.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 83: 60-65Crossref Scopus (472) Google Scholar). These factors influence the proliferation of chondrocytes or differentiation or both. PTHrP1 has recently been demonstrated to be critical in embryonic skeletal development (7Vortkamp A. Lee K. Lanske B. Segre G.V. Kronenberg H.M. Tabin C.J.

When administered intermittently, both PTH, an agent that plays a crucial role in calcium homeostasis, and PTHrP, which shares several properties with PTH, stimulate new bone formation (10Dempster D.W. Cosman F. Parisien M. Shen V. Lindsay R. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 690-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 11Gunness-Hey M. Hock J.M. Metab. Bone Dis. & Relat.

Both proteins bind to a unique G-protein-coupled receptor (type I PTH/PTHrP receptor) that is present on a variety of cell types, including chondrocytes (13Enomoto M. Kinashita A. Pan H.O. Suzuki F.

Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 868-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Mice with null mutations for the type I PTH receptor or for PTHrP develop skeletal abnormalities (7Vortkamp A. Lee K.

Thus, PTH and PTHrP play a crucial role in skeletal growth and maturation. In order to define further the mechanisms by which PTH/PTHrP may promote and prolong the expression of the cartilage phenotype, we evaluated the effects of PTH-(1–34) on the biosynthesis of cartilage proteoglycans. Upon treatment with PTH-(1–34), chondrocytes isolated from the rib cages of rat embryos showed a dramatic increase in aggrecan synthesis, which was associated with an increase in mRNA levels for aggrecan. The effects of PTH were reduced or blocked by a neutralizing antibody to IGF-I and mimicked by a neutralizing antibody to IGFBP-2. Further detailed analysis indicated that PTH-(1–34)-stimulated aggrecan synthesis was associated with a reduction in IGFBP-3 levels and an increase in free IGF-I levels. Thus, a local increase in IGF-I caused by PTH treatment may lead to an increase in cartilage type proteoglycan synthesis and maintenance of the cartilage phenotype. The consequence of the prolonged maintenance may be to halt mineralization while a new scaffolding is created. Rat PTH-(1–34), human PTH-(53–84), rat/human PTHrP-(1–34), bovine PTH-(3–34), bovine PTH-(7–34), rat PTH-(1–84), and rat/human PTHrP-(1–86) were purchased from Bachem, Torrance, CA. Human recombinant IGF-I and neutralizing antibodies to IGF-I, IGF-II, and IGFBPs were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY. Costal chondrocytes were isolated from rib cages of timed pregnant rat embryos. For most of the studies, gestational day 17/18 rat embryos were utilized. Rib cages were treated in sequence with a solution of 500 μg/ml trypsin, 200 μg/ml EDTA for 1 h at 37 °C followed by 2 mg/ml collagenase (CLS-2; Worthington) for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were plated at 5 × 104/cm2 in Ham's F-12 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin and were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Only confluent primary cultures were used for this study. Cultures grown in 24-well plates were washed free of serum with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. Treatments were added for the indicated intervals in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid. The cultures were then washed extensively and allowed to recover for the indicated times in the same medium (without PTH). At the end of each recovery period, the cells were labeled for 4 h in fresh medium with 100 μCi/ml Na235SO4 (NEN Life Science Products; specific activity 555 mCi/mmol). Where indicated, neutralizing antibodies were present throughout the treatment, recovery, and labeling periods. The cell layer (matrix) was extracted with 4 m guanidinium chloride, 80 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0, 10 mm Na2EDTA, 25 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, 100 mm6-aminohexanoic acid, and 10 mm chaps. This extract and the labeled conditioned media were dialyzed against deionized water in 12,000–14,000 molecular weight cut-off tubing (Spectra/por, Spectrum Industries, Los Angeles, CA). The radioactive incorporation into these nondialyzable fractions was determined by scintillation counting. The radiolabeled components were analyzed by electrophoresis on 3–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under denaturing and reducing conditions. Samples were loaded based on the products from an equal number of cells. After electrophoresis, the gels were saturated with fluor (Entensify; NEN Life Science Products), vacuum-dried, and exposed to x-ray film (Reflection; NEN Life Science Products). Molecular weights were determined by globular protein standards (Bio-Rad). Relative band intensities were determined using a Fluor-S Multi-imager and Quantity One image acquisition and analysis software (Bio-Rad). In order to verify the aggrecan nature of the molecules, sulfate-labeled samples were evaluated by chromatography on a hyaluronate-Sepharose column (15Chandrasekhar S. Phadke K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 265: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In brief, human umbilical cord hyaluronic acid (Sigma) was purified from sulfated glycosaminoglycans by cetyl pyridinium chloride precipitation and was coupled to EAH-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a published procedure (16Ototoni N. Yosizawa Z. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1978; 84: 1005-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The proteoglycan samples were dissolved in 0.005 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, and were chromatographed on a column (5 × 0.24 cm) of hyaluronate-Sepharose equilibrated in the same buffer. The unbound material was removed by washing with 4 column volumes of the buffer, and the bound materials were eluted in sequence with 2 column volumes each of 0.5 and 4.0 m guanidinium chloride in 0.005m phosphate, pH 6.8. The samples were extensively dialyzed against deionized water, lyophilized, and evaluated by SDS-PAGE/fluorography, as above. The radiolabeled samples (106 dpm each) were solubilized in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 60 mm sodium acetate, plus protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm N -ethylmaleimide, and 10 mmNa2EDTA) and were treated with chondroitinase ABC or AC lyase (0.025 units/ml; ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) for 40 min at 37 °C. The digested samples were dialyzed and evaluated by SDS-PAGE/fluorography. Total RNA from various treatments was extracted using Ultraspec RNA (Biotecx Laboratories, Inc., Houston, TX), and 30 μg each was subjected to electrophoresis on a 1% (w/v) agarose/formaldehyde gel and transferred to GeneScreen membranes (NEN Life Science Products). The probes for rat aggrecan, IGF-I, and IGFBP-3 were generated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and were subsequently cloned into a pCR II vector using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The cDNA probe for human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was obtained from CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). All probes were random labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) to a specific activity of 108 cpm/μg. The filters were prehybridized for 30 min at 60 °C in Rapid-hyb buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The hybridization was carried out at 60 °C for 3 h in the same buffer containing 1 × 106 cpm/ml of the labeled probes. After washing, the filters were exposed to x-ray film (Reflection; NEN Life Science Products) or were quantitated by analysis in a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Sunnyvale, CA). Conditioned media from control and PTH-treated cultures were analyzed for the presence of free rat IGF-I by a radioimmunoassay kit that specifically recognizes only rat IGF-I and for IGFBP-3 by an immunoradiometric assay kit (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Inc., Webster, TX). Initially, we evaluated the effect of PTH-(1–34) on the chondrogenic phenotype in vitro by assessing proteoglycan synthesis. Costal chondrocyte cultures from day 18 rat embryos were treated for 4 or 20 h with 10 nmPTH-(1–34), were washed extensively to remove the PTH, and were allowed to recover for 20 or 4 h, respectively, in serum-free medium. During the last 4 h of the recovery period, the cultures were labeled with Na235SO4, and the extracts of the cell layer + matrix were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/fluorography. The major polydisperse sulfated molecules that migrated near the top of the gel are likely to be aggrecan. An additional band of approximate molecular size of 220 kDa was also identified and is likely to be biglycan, based on the relative migration positions in the gel and by comparison with globular molecular weight standards (17Fisher L.W. Hawkins G.R. Tuross N. Termine J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9702-9708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PTH-(1–34) treatments (20 and 4 h + 20 h recovery) resulted in an increased incorporation of aggrecan and the 220- kDa band into the cell layer/matrix (Fig.1, lanes 4 and 6 , respectively). As expected, a 4-h PTH treatment + labeling was not effective (Fig. 1, lane 2 ). More extensive time course studies confirmed that a PTH exposure time of 4–6 h, followed by a 20-h recovery, was sufficient to cause an increase in proteoglycan synthesis. For subsequent experiments, the regimen involving a 4–6-h PTH treatment followed by a 20-h recovery was utilized. In order to establish the optimal time of recovery needed to observe an effect on proteoglycan synthesis, chondrocytes were treated for 4 h with 10 nmPTH-(1–34), allowed to recover for various times in serum-free medium and finally labeled during the last 4 h of each recovery period. The results of 4- and 18-h recovery times are shown in Fig. 2. A time-dependent difference was observed in the distribution of the aggrecan and the 220-kDa band. Within 4 h of recovery, aggrecan was only barely detectable in the media and the cell layer, whereas a significant amount of the 220-kDa band was present in both the media and the cell layer. By 18 h of recovery, aggrecan synthesis was clearly evident in the cell layer. Within 4 h of recovery, PTH treatment resulted in only a slight increase in aggrecan levels (1.2-fold). After an 18-h recovery, a substantial increase in aggrecan (1.8-fold) and the 220-kDa band was evident. Within 4 h of recovery, there was a slight increase in the amount of aggrecan secreted into the medium, with higher levels reached at 18 h of recovery. These results suggest that PTH-(1–34) promotes both the synthesis and the incorporation of aggrecan and the 220-kDa band into the cell layer/extracellular matrix. For most of the studies, we have concentrated on the large molecular weight aggrecan that is specifically associated with the cartilage phenotype. In order to determine the optimal PTH concentration, chondrocytes were exposed to various concentrations of PTH-(1–34) for 4 h, and the sulfate incorporation was determined after a 20-h recovery followed by Na235SO4labeling during the last 4 h. The results (Fig.3) indicate that there was a dose-related increase in sulfate incorporation, with the majority of the increase occurring at 10 nm PTH-(1–34). For subsequent experiments, only a concentration of 10 nm PTH-(1–34) was used. In order to evaluate whether chondrocytes treated transiently with PTH display a more pronounced effect after a second transient treatment with PTH, the cells were treated with two cycles of PTH (4 h treatment and 24 h recovery) followed by Na235SO4 label during the last 4 h. The results (Fig. 4) show that there was a significant increase in the aggrecan released into the medium (1.5-fold), but there was a dramatic increase (17-fold) in aggrecan incorporated into the cell layer. Similar results were obtained when cells were treated with two 24-h treatments of PTH (data not shown). The results suggest that chondrocytes not only retain the ability to respond to a second transient or prolonged treatment but that the response is greater than after a single transient exposure to PTH. To determine the specificity of the response, we compared the effects of PTH-(1–34) and PTH-(53–84), a fragment that does not stimulate cAMP accumulation but does stimulate alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin production in osteoblasts (18Murray T.M. Rao L.G. Muzaffar S.A. Ly H. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 1097-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 19Sutherland M.K. Rao L.G. Wylie J.N. Gupta A. Ly H. Sodek J. Murray T.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition, PTHrP-(1–34), which is similar to PTH-(1–34) in a variety of biological activities, was also evaluated. Cells were treated for 4 h with 10 nm each of PTH-(1–34), PTH-(53–84), or PTHrP-(1–34). The treatments were removed; the cells were allowed to recover for 24 h, and the proteoglycan incorporation into the cell layer was evaluated after labeling during the last 4 h of recovery. Only PTH-(1–34) and PTHrP-(1–34) increased proteoglycan synthesis (Fig.5). PTH-(53–84) (see Fig. 5) and other fragments (PTH-(3–34) and PTH-(7–34)) that do not stimulate cAMP were ineffective. 2A. K. Harvey, X.-P. Yu, C. A. Frolik, and S. Chandrasekhar, unpublished data. In order to establish the identity of the newly synthesized proteoglycan, Na235SO4-labeled samples from control and PTH-treated cultures were tested for hyaluronate binding activity and susceptibility to chondroitinase digestion. Cells were treated with PTH-(1–34) using a repetitive treatment regimen (Fig. 4), and an aliquot of the cell layer/matrix extract was subjected to hyaluronate affinity chromatography. The bound samples were eluted in sequence with 0.5 and 4 m guanidinium chloride (Fig.6, lanes 3 and 4 ). The results are shown only for PTH treated samples (Fig. 6, lanes 1–7 ). Similar results were obtained for untreated controls (data not shown). The high molecular weight band was eluted only by 4.0m guanidinium chloride, suggesting that the aggrecan was capable of binding to hyaluronan strongly (lane 4 ), since it was not present in either the unbound fraction (lane 2 ) or the 0.5 m guanidinium chloride-eluted fraction (lane 3 ). In order to confirm further the proteoglycan nature of the Na235SO4 molecules, samples from PTH-treated cells were subjected to digestion with chondroitinase ABC or AC lyase. The results establish that both bands (Fig. 6, lanes 6 and 7 ) were digested by the enzymes and are therefore likely to be chondroitin sulfate-containing proteoglycans. Previous studies have suggested that PTH effects on bone cells may involve IGF-I as a mediator and that IGFs may play a crucial role in cartilage proteoglycan metabolism (6Canalis E. Centrella M. Burch W. McCarthy T.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 83: 60-65Crossref Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 20Olsson C. Nilsson A. Isaksson O.G.P. Lindahl A. J. Endocrinol. 1992; 133: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 22McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. Canalis E. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 1247-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In order to determine if IGFs played a role in the PTH-mediated increase in proteoglycan synthesis and incorporation, proteoglycan synthesis was evaluated in the presence of neutralizing antibodies to IGF-I, IGF-II, or IGFBP-2. The results are shown in Fig. 7 as follows: (a ) in comparison to control, PTH treatment resulted in a 2.1-fold increase in aggrecan synthesis; (b ) antibody to IGF-I significantly reduced aggrecan synthesis in both the control and PTH-treated cells, whereas IGF-II antibody had no effect on either the control or PTH-treated cells. In the presence of IGFBP-2 antibody, there was a dramatic increase in aggrecan synthesis in the control and PTH-treated cells. These results suggest that free IGF-I that is likely to have been released from the binding protein may play a role in increasing aggrecan synthesis in both the control and PTH-treated cells. Since local IGF levels can be influenced by the amount of IGF-binding protein present, we wanted to evaluate whether PTH can influence binding protein levels and whether the effects of PTH are dependent on the developmental age of the cells. An initial 125I-IGF ligand blot analysis of chondrocyte-conditioned media from day 18 embryos revealed that the predominant binding protein present was IGFBP-3 (data not shown). We next asked whether a relationship exists between aggrecan and IGFBP-3 levels during normal chondrocyte differentiation. Rat costal chondrocytes from various stages of gestation were evaluated for proteoglycan synthesis (sulfate incorporation) and IGFBP-3 secretion (immunoradiometric assay). The results (Fig.8) demonstrate a developmental stage-dependent reciprocal relationship between aggrecan and IGFBP-3 levels. The peak of aggrecan synthesis in this experiment was on day 18, whereas IGFBP-3 levels were at the lowest in the corresponding samples. These results are consistent with the suggestion that a reduction in IGFBP-3 may contribute to the normal aggrecan synthesis during development. Because chondrogenic differentiation in rats occurs between day 17 and 18 and since PTH receptor expression is specific to developmental age, we next evaluated whether PTH-(1–34) exhibited stage-specific effects on aggrecan synthesis. Chondrocytes from various gestational days of development (days 17, 18, 20, and 21) were exposed to a repetitive treatment regimen with PTH-(1–34), and the total cellular RNA was isolated 2 h after the second treatment. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis and transferred to GeneScreen, and the membranes were hybridized with a random labeled probe for aggrecan. The results (Fig. 9) show that in comparison to respective controls, PTH treatment resulted in significant increases in aggrecan mRNA levels in chondrocytes isolated from day 17 (2.3-fold) and day 18 (2.1-fold) embryos, with very little effect on cells from day 20 and day 21 embryos. The results are consistent with the differentiation stage-specific expression of PTH receptors on chondrocytes (23Iwamoto M. Jikko A. Murakami H. Shimazu A. Nakashima K. Iwamoto M. Takigawa M. Baba H. Suzuki F. Kato Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17245-17251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and suggest that PTH may enhance the cartilage phenotype by promoting cartilage-specific macromolecules. We next asked whether PTH-(1–34) resulted in altered levels of free IGF-I and IGFBP-3 and whether exogenously added human IGF-I was effective in influencing PTH effects on aggrecan synthesis. Chondrocytes from day 18 embryos were treated with 10 nm PTH-(1–34), 100 ng/ml IGF-I, or both, and aggrecan synthesis was evaluated by sulfate incorporation and SDS-PAGE analysis. The results confirmed that PTH treatment resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in aggrecan synthesis (Fig.10 A, lane 2 ). In the same cultures, PTH treatment also resulted in a 35% increase in free IGF-I and a 22% reduction in IGFBP-3 levels (Fig. 10 B ) without affecting total IGF-I levels (data not shown). Surprisingly, exogenously added human IGF-I was not effective in eliciting aggrecan synthesis (Fig. 10 A ), either alone (lane 2 ) or in combination with PTH (lane 4 ). Similarly, there was no difference in free IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels (Fig. 10 B ) between PTH and PTH + IGF-I-treated cultures. These results further establish that PTH effects on aggrecan synthesis are associated with an increase in free IGF-I that is likely to be available due to a reduction in IGFBP-3 levels. We next evaluated if the PTH effects on IGFBP-3 and IGF-I were also observed at the mRNA level. Cultures obtained from day 18 embryos were treated with PTH-(1–34) for 4 h, and the total cellular RNA was isolated after a 2-h recovery and evaluated by Northern blot. The results (Fig. 11) further establish that in comparison to control, PTH treatment resulted in the following: (a ) an increase in aggrecan mRNA (80% increase); (b ) a decrease in IGFBP-3 mRNA (60% reduction); and (c ) a minor (24%) or no reduction in IGF-I mRNA levels. These data confirm that PTH treatment in vitro regulates aggrecan mRNA directly and aggrecan synthesis indirectly by reducing IGFBP-3 levels, ultimately regulating the phenotype of cells that are likely to be chondrogenic. Longitudinal skeletal growth is the direct result of epiphyseal chondrogenesis and accompanying endochondral bone formation. A variety of endocrine and growth factors regulate and influence chondrocyte differentiation. Previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that PTH and PTHrP decrease terminal differentiation of chondrocytes (9Lee K. Lanske B. Karaplis A.C. Deeds J.D. Kohno H. Nissenson R.A. Kronenberg H.K. Segre G.V. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5109-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 23Iwamoto M. Jikko A. Murakami H. Shimazu A. Nakashima K. Iwamoto M. Takigawa M. Baba H. Suzuki F. Kato Y.

Invest. 1990; 85: 626-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate the following: (a ) PTH-(1–34) treatment of rat costal chondrocytes resulted in an increase in aggrecan mRNA and aggrecan synthesis; (b ) PTH effects on enhanced aggrecan synthesis were dependent on the stage of chondrocyte development; and (c ) increased synthesis was associated with a reduction in IGFBP-3/2 and a corresponding increase in free IGF-I. The results are consistent with the suggestion that PTH-(1–34) may prolong the maintenance of the chondrocyte phenotype by promoting the expression of cartilage-specific proteoglycan. Proteoglycan synthesis was evaluated by sulfate incorporation studies and by steady-state mRNA analysis. The major sulfated proteoglycan was confirmed as aggrecan based on its ability to bind to hyaluronan and its digestion with chondroitinase ABC and AC. In addition, using Western blot, we have observed that the sulfated molecules were recognized by a polyclonal antibody against rat chondrosarcoma aggrecan core protein and also by a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the hyaluronate binding region (1-C-6 from Dr. B. Caterson, data not shown). These results confirm that the high molecular weight proteoglycan was indeed aggrecan. The lower molecular mass band (∼220-kDa, based on globular molecular mass standards) was not characterized but is likely to be biglycan (17Fisher L.W. Hawkins G.R. Tuross N. Termine J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9702-9708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since this molecule was digested by both chondroitinase ABC and AC, it is likely to be chondroitin sulfate-substituted rather than a dermatan sulfate molecule. Taken together, these results establish that PTH treatment resulted in increased aggrecan synthesis. The increase in aggrecan synthesis by chondrocytes was dependent on the concentration of PTH, with 10 nm eliciting a maximal response. The increase in aggrecan synthesis was observed when the cells were treated for 20 or 4 h followed by a 16-h recovery in the absence of PTH. Previous studies using adult rabbit chondrocytes have demonstrated an effect of PTH only after a 24-h treatment and not within a 4-h treatment (25Kato Y. Koike T. Iwamoto M. Kinoshita M. Sato K. Hiraki Y. Suzuki F. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 1991-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These differences may be a reflection of species or developmental age or both. For our studies, we have utilized chondrocytes from rat embryos at different gestational ages, whereas the cells used by Kato et al. (25Kato Y. Koike T. Iwamoto M. Kinoshita M. Sato K. Hiraki Y. Suzuki F. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 1991-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) were obtained from 400-g rabbits. Furthermore, there are significant differences in receptor density for PTH (23Iwamoto M. Jikko A. Murakami H. Shimazu A. Nakashima K. Iwamoto M. Takigawa M. Baba H. Suzuki F. Kato Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17245-17251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in PTH responsiveness during development (Fig.9).2 Treatment of chondrocytes with PTH for 4–6 h, followed by a recovery time of 18–24 h, resulted in optimal aggrecan synthesis, suggesting that PTH may initially stimulate factors that regulate aggrecan synthesis. Although several candidates can play such a role, our studies have focused on IGF-I as a potential mediator of PTH action on aggrecan synthesis, since previous studies have suggested such a role for IGF-I in mediating PTH action on bone cells (21Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar, 22McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. Canalis E. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 1247-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). IGF action can be regulated both by synthesis of IGF or by local release of IGF from the IGF·IGFBP complex. Several observations presented in this study demonstrate the latter possibility. First, a neutralizing antibody to IGF-I, when included in the treatment medium, caused a significant decrease in the levels of aggrecan and the 220-kDa band in control and PTH-treated cells. A neutralizing antibody to IGF-II had no such activity. Conversely, inclusion of a neutralizing antibody to IGFBP-2 resulted in a dramatic increase in aggrecan and biglycan levels in both control and PTH-treated cells. In addition, quantitative determination of mRNA levels for aggrecan, IGF-I, and IGFBP-3 (Fig.11) and measurement of free IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels (Fig. 10) further confirm that PTH stimulation of aggrecan may be associated with a reduction in IGFBP-2 and/or -3. Although there are several IGFBPs, for this study, we have focused on IGFBP-3 (Figs. 8, 10, and 11) and IGFBP-2 (Fig. 7), because our initial ligand blot analysis indicated that IGFBP-3 was the major band. 3C. A. Frolik, A. K. Harvey, and S. Chandrasekhar, unpublished data. Thus, a reduction in IGFBPs may release free IGF-I at the local level, leading to increased aggrecan synthesis. It is interesting to note that a reduction in IGFBP may play a role in aggrecan synthesis during normal cartilage development, as a reciprocal relationship exists between aggrecan and IGFBP levels (Fig. 8). Collectively, these results suggest that aggrecan synthesis in normal chondrocytes is dependent on local IGF-I levels and availability and that PTH may enhance aggrecan synthesis by increasing free IGF-I and decreasing IGFBP production (Figs. 10 and11). It is not clear why the exogenously added human IGF-I was not effective in eliciting aggrecan synthesis (Fig. 10). Several conditions were attempted, including “serum starving” the cells for 24–48 h before IGF-I was added or by adding IGF-I during the recovery time after a 4- or 20-h PTH treatment (data no shown). One possible explanation is that rat cells are not responsive to human IGF-I. It is important to recognize, however, that IGF-I/IGFBP-3-mediated aggrecan synthesis is not the only mechanism by which PTH may influence aggrecan synthesis. PTH-(1–34) appears to have a direct effect on aggrecan synthesis, since a 4–6-h PTH exposure resulted in an increase in aggrecan mRNA accumulation (Fig. 9). PTH activities on target cells are mediated through a G-protein-coupled receptor that transduces signal through cAMP-mediated protein kinase A pathways (26Segre G.V. Bilezikian J.P. Levine M.A. Marcus R. The Parathyroids. Raven Press, New York1994: 213-229Google Scholar). Our results show that only PTH-(1–34) and PTHrP, which are known to stimulate cAMP production, were capable of stimulating proteoglycan synthesis. Other analogs (PTH-(3–34), PTH-(7–34), and PTH-(53–84)), which do not have such an ability, failed to affect proteoglycan synthesis (Fig. 5).3 Furthermore, forskolin and 8-bromo-cAMP also stimulated aggrecan synthesis. 4S. Chandrasekhar and A. K. Harvey, manuscript in preparation. These results are consistent with the suggestion that the protein kinase A pathway may play a direct role in aggrecan synthesis. However, in the presence of IGFBP-3 antibody, aggrecan synthesis was significantly increased even in control chondrocytes that were not treated with exogenously added PTH (Fig. 7) indicating that aggrecan synthesis indeed can be regulated by local level IGF-I availability without PTH-stimulated cAMP induction. It is therefore conceivable that aggrecan synthesis can be influenced both by cAMP-dependent and IGF-I-dependent pathways, but the relative contributions of each of the pathways remain to be established. The role of IGF-I in chondrocyte proteoglycan synthesis has been well documented (27Iannotti J.P. Brighton C.T. Iannotti V. Ohisi T. J. Orthop. Res. 1990; 8: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 28Itagane Y. Inada H. Fujita K. Isshiki G. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 29Maor G.

Furthermore, PTH has been shown to alter local IGF-I levels in calvaria (21Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar, 22McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. Canalis E. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 1247-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that PTH effects on embryonic (gestational days of 18 days or less) chondrocytes may be mediated by similar local control mechanisms. Since proteoglycans have generally been suggested to cause the inhibition of mineralization, a potential role for PTH is to delay the onset of hypertrophy of the cartilage by stimulating aggrecan synthesis (23Iwamoto M. Jikko A. Murakami H. Shimazu A. Nakashima K. Iwamoto M. Takigawa M. Baba H. Suzuki F. Kato Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17245-17251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The delay in chondrocyte maturation might allow cells to add more cartilage, which can be subsequently mineralized for serving as a scaffold for new bone. This would require a very precise regulation of PTH/PTHrP action, but it is not known whether such a regulation occursin vivo . PTH/PTHrP receptor is expressed in prehypertrophic chondrocytes (7Vortkamp A. Lee K. Lanske B. Segre G.V. Kronenberg H.M. Tabin C.J.

Eukaryotic ABC proteins are often composed of two homologous halves, each containing a transmembrane domain (TMD) with six predicted membrane-spanning segments, and a NBF that contains the highly conserved Walker A (GXX GX GK(S/T)), Walker B (RX 6–8hyd4D) (3Walker J.E.

Walker A and Walker B are common to a wide variety of nucleotide-binding proteins, whereas the signature region, just upstream of the Walker B motif, is distinctive to the ABC family. Midway between the Walker A and B regions lies the “center” region, which does not form a true consensus sequence, although certain residues are conserved among ABC proteins subsets (5Michaelis S. Berkower C. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; LX: 291-307Crossref Google Scholar). Certain ABC transporters have an additional R domain that serves regulatory functions (6Cheng S.H. Rich D.P. Marshall J. Gregory R.J. Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 1027-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), and others have a large N-terminal hydrophobic region (7Tusnády G.E. Bakos E. Váradi A. Sarkadi B. FEBS Lett.. 1997; 402: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic ABC transporters include the human CFTR, multidrug resistance and MRP1 proteins, and the yeast a-factor transporter (Ste6p), pleiotropic drug resistance (Pdr5p), and Ycf1p proteins (1Higgins C.F.

Ycf1p is a vacuolar membrane protein that transports Cd2+ions and several drugs as glutathione conjugates (GS-conjugates) with a requirement for ATP hydrolysis, playing a critical role in Cd2+ tolerance in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (11Li Z.-S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22853-22857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ycf1p has strong sequence similarity with CFTR and MRP1; in a comparison of all known yeast and human ABC transporters, these three proteins are classified in the same subgroup (5Michaelis S. Berkower C. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; LX: 291-307Crossref Google Scholar, 14Decottignies A. Goffeau A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Ycf1p and MRP1 share with CFTR a region comparable with the R domain in CFTR, which mediates cAMP-dependent regulation of the chloride channel. The sequence identity of these proteins suggests that they probably have similar overall structures. Structure-function analysis of Ycf1p can thus provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanism of transport by ABC proteins. We selected 22 amino acid residues of Ycf1p for extensive mutational analysis of the protein. Most of the selected residues are conserved in CFTR and MRP1 proteins, and the substitutions or deletions introduced are analogous to reported cystic fibrosis (CF)-associated mutations. Mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis in NBF1, NBF2, the R domain, and ICL4 that joins TMD2 transmembrane segments X and XI. Mutants were analyzed phenotypically by assaying their Cd2+tolerance. The mutant protein expression level was quantitated by immunodetection in vacuolar membranes; those showing expression were functionally characterized by measuring ATP-dependent transport of LTC4 into vacuolar membrane vesicles. The kinetic parameters for LTC4 uptake were determined for the wild type and mutants. The results presented here show that the mutations introduced in the highly conserved NBF domains are extremely deleterious for Ycf1p function. In addition, the mutational analysis identified a group of mutants located in the putative R domain in which Cd2+ tolerance was dissociated from the in vitro measured transport activity of the protein. We discuss a model for the regulatory role of the R-like domain in transporter function. A Δycf1 derivative of S. cerevisiae strain W303–1A (15Ronne H. Rothstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In all experiments, growth was at 30 °C in SD medium (0.7% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (U. S. Biological, Swampscott, MA), 2% glucose, pH 5.5) supplemented with required amino acids (100 μg/ml). SD medium for Cd2+ resistance assays was supplemented with drop-out mix (BIO 101, Joshua Way, Vista CA). A 1.1-kbBam HI-Sma I fragment from pJJ242 (16Jones J.S. Prakash L. Yeast. 1990; 6: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) containing the URA3 gene, was used to replace a 4.7-kbBgl II-Sal I (blunt-ended) fragment of pIBIYCF1 (13Szczypka M.S. Wemmie J.A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22853-22857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thus eliminating most of the promoter and coding sequence. A 3.5-kb Sac I-Mlu I fragment containing theYCF1 disruption cassette was used to transform strain W303–1A to uracil prototrophy. Gene disruption was verified by Southern hybridization (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning : A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989: 931-957Google Scholar). A 7.1-kb fragment from pIBIYCF1, excised by Sph I (blunt-ended with Klenow fragment) andSac I digestion, containing YCF1 gene was subcloned into Sma I-Sac I-digested pRS315 (18Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to give pRS315YCF1. Digestion with Xho I-Mlu I, blunt-ending with Klenow fragment, and religating eliminated restriction sites between Xho I-Sma I sites in the pRS315 polylinker, giving plasmid pIB1157. Blunt-end ligation regenerated the Mlu I site. Plasmid pIB1197 was constructed by insertion of a 4.5-kb Eco RV-Sal I fragment from pIBIYCF1 into pBluescript KS vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), digestion with Hin dIII, and ligation to generate a 1.1-kbHin dIII deletion internal to theEco RV-Sal I fragment. The following fragments fromYCF1 were subcloned into M13mp19 (19Norrander J. Kempe T. Messing J. Gene. 1983; 26: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar) for mutagenesis: (i) 1.4-kb Sal I-Sph I fragment (epitope tagging); (ii) 2.1-kb Stu I-Sal I fragment (mutations D777N, R1143C, Q1148P, G1306E, G1311R, N1366K, G1413D); (iii) 1.1-kbHin dIII fragment (remaining mutations). TheStu I-Sal I fragment was first subcloned into pSL301 (20Brosius J. DNA. 1989; 8: 759-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and recovered as Sac I-Sal I to be cloned into M13mp19. Mutagenesis was performed by the Eckstein method (21Taylor J.W. Ott J. Eckstein F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8749-8764Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) with the SculptorTM in vitro Mutagenesis System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Epitope tagging of Ycf1p was performed by inserting the coding sequence for the 9-amino acid 12CA5 epitope (sequence: YPYDVPDYA) from human influenza hemagglutinin protein (HA) immediately before the YCF1 termination codon. The tagged YCF1 was designated YCF1-HA. AllYCF1 fragments subjected to oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis were sequenced. The YCF1 1.4-kbSal I-Mlu I fragment containing the HA epitope sequence was obtained from the replicative form of M13mp19 and exchanged with the corresponding wild type segments of pIB1157, generating pIB1201. The YCF1 1.1-kb Hin dIII fragments containing the mutations generated were obtained from the replicative form of M13mp19 and inserted into pIB1197. The 4.5-kbEco RV-Sal I fragments from the resultant plasmids were exchanged with the corresponding wild type segments ofYCF1-HA in pIB1201. MutagenizedStu I-Sal I fragments were liberated from the replicative M13mp19 form and used to replace the corresponding fragments in pIB1201. All replacements of wild type by mutant fragments were confirmed by sequencing. The 7.1-kbApa I-Sac I fragment from pIB1201 containing the promoter and open reading frame was also cloned into pRS425 (22Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene. 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar) to render the YCF1-HA gene on multicopy plasmid. The resulting plasmids were used to transform the Δycf1 strain using the lithium acetate procedure (23Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA was sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemical Corp.). Qualitative and quantitative determinations of Cd2+ resistance were performed. Cells were cultured for 2 days and suspended in water to anA 660 of 0.4 (2.4 × 107cells/ml) to be used as inoculum. For qualitative assays, 5 μl were dropped on plates alone or with CdCl2 at the indicated concentrations. Growth was scored after a 3-day incubation. For quantitative determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), flat-bottom 96-well microtiter plates containing medium with CdCl2 concentrations ranging from 0 to1 mm were inoculated to a final cell density of 6 × 105cells/ml. Inoculum-free wells were also included. The optical density (A 595) of each well was determined after a 2-day incubation. Data were fitted to a sigmoidal dose-response equation using Prism 2.0 GraphPad Software. The MIC value is defined as the lowest Cd2+ concentration at which prominent inhibition of cell growth (90–95%) is observed. Vacuolar membrane vesicles were prepared from cultures grown to anA 660 of 1.0. After washing cells with H2O, spheroplasts were obtained with Zymolyase 20T (U. S. Biological, Swampscott, MA) (25Kim E.J. Zhen R.-G. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), using a shortened procedure with only one cycle of flotation centrifugation. The resulting vacuole fraction was vesiculated in 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mmKCl, 10 mm Tris-MES, pH 6.9, pelleted by centrifugation (37,000 × g , 25 min), and resuspended in buffer (1.1m glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm Tris-MES, pH 7.6) (11Li Z.-S.

Dithiothreitol and EGTA were omitted in vacuolar preparations used for transport assays. All buffers used contained a protease inhibitor mixture (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Standard uptake experiments were performed at 30 °C in TS buffer (250 mm sucrose, 25 mm Tris-MES, pH 8.0) containing 4 mm ATP, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 20 units/ml creatine kinase, and 50 nm[3H]LTC4 (13 nCi/pmol) in a final volume of 55 μl. Uptake was initiated by the addition of vesicles (10 μg of protein). LTC4 uptake into vacuolar vesicles increased linearly with the amount of vacuolar membrane protein, at least to 30 μg. Aliquots (10 μl) were removed at the times indicated, diluted in 1 ml of ice-cold TS buffer, immediately filtered through nitrocellulose filters (pore size 0.45 μm, Millipore, Bedford, MA) presoaked in TS buffer and washed twice with 5 ml of ice-cold TS buffer. The retained radioactivity was counted using liquid scintillation fluid. Initial rates were calculated from the first 1.5 min of uptake. Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method (27Bradford M.M. Anal.

Western blots were scanned with a StudioscanII (Agfa-Gevaert, Leverkusen, Germany), and Adobe Photoshop and NIH Image 1.60/fat software were used to quantitate the Ycf1p amounts. Standard default settings were used for all measurements, and all mutant enzymes were compared with an internal wild type control on the same gel. [3H]LTC4 (165 Ci/mmol) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Unlabeled LTC4was from Sigma.

We chose LTC4 as substrate of Ycf1p since human MRP1, a GS-X pump that transports LTC4and structurally related conjugates in mammalian cells (33Leier I. Jedlitschky G. Bucholz U. Cole S.P.C.

We measured [3H]LTC4 uptake into vacuolar membrane vesicles from a Δycf1 yeast strain harboring the wild type gene carried on either single or multiple copy plasmid. Incubation of the vacuolar vesicles with 50 nm[3H]LTC4 in the presence of ATP resulted in rapid LTC4 uptake (Fig.1 A ). In vesicles from wild type cells expressing YCF1 from a single or a multicopy plasmid, the initial rates in the presence of ATP were 45 and 182 pmol·min−1·mg of protein−1, respectively, and 0.1 and 15 pmol·min−1 ·mg protein−1in the absence of ATP. LTC4 uptake in the presence of a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, adenosine 5′-O -(3-thiotriphosphate), or into vacuolar vesicles prepared from the Δycf1 deletion mutant was negligible under these conditions (not shown). Ycf1p-dependent transport activity correlated roughly with Cd2+ tolerance (Fig. 1 B ) and the amount of Ycf1p (Fig. 1C) of these strains. This indicates that LTC4 uptake is Ycf1p-dependent, allowing the use of quantitative transport assays as an indicator of Ycf1p function. The effect of LTC4 or ATP concentration on the rate of LTC4 uptake was measured in vacuolar vesicles prepared from a Δycf1 strain expressing the epitope-taggedYCF1-HA from a single copy plasmid. The uptake was saturated with respect to LTC4 and ATP concentrations with an apparent K m of 0.82 ± 0.14 μmfor LTC4 and 55 ± 9.7 μm for ATP. TheV max was 1.85 ± 0.12 nmol·min−1·mg of protein−1 (Table III). The results revealed that Ycf1p affinity is higher for LTC4than for other substrates previously assayed, such asS -(2,4-dinitrophenyl) glutathione (K m = 14.1 μm) (11Li Z.-S. Szczypka M. Lu Y.-P.

Glutathione (1 mm GSH) had a weak inhibitory effect, concurring with the low affinity of Ycf1p for this compound (37Rebbeor J.F. Connolly G.C. Dumont M.E. Ballatori N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33449-33454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), whereas 100 μm GS-conjugates such asS -decyl glutathione or S -azidophenacyl glutathione inhibited LTC4 transport by 60–63% (TableI). LTC4 uptake was also inhibited by 45% with 500 μm Cd2+ in the presence of 1 mm GSH. Agents that dissipate the H+ electrochemical gradient established by the vacuolar H+-ATPase did not decrease LTC4 transport significantly. In contrast, DIDS and probenecid, potent inhibitors of anion transporters (36Akerboom T.P.M. Narayanaswami V. Kunst M. Sies H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13147-13152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), completely abolished LTC4 uptake at the concentrations used. These results show that the energy-dependent LTC4 uptake is not linked to the vacuolar electrochemical H+ gradient and has properties similar to those of GS-conjugate transport by other GS-X pumps.Table IInhibition of ATP-dependent LTC4 uptake in vacuolar membrane vesiclesAdditionLTC4 uptake% of controlControl100GSH (1 mm)85GSH (1 mm) + Cd2+(0.5 mm)55Azidophenacyl-GS (100 μm)37Decyl-GS (100 μm)40Gramicidin D (10 μm) + KCl (50 mm)93CCCP (100 μm)96DIDS (1 mm)0Probenecid (5 mm)4Vacuolar membrane vesicles (10 μg of protein) were incubated with 50 nm [3H]LTC4, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Additions were made 5 min before initiation of the uptake reaction.

Individual Ycf1p amino acids were selected for site-directed mutagenesis with the following criteria.

One group of transcription elongation factors, which includes prokaryotic GreA and GreB and eukaryotic SII (TFIIS), acts by stimulating the endonucleolytic cleavage reaction within the elongation complex (7Uptain S.M. Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 117-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Although the in vivo role for this group of elongation factors remains unknown, studies suggest their cleavage stimulating activity may (i) maintain transcription fidelity by facilitating the removal of misincorporated nucleotides (8Erie D.A.

In an arrested state, the RNAP cannot continue RNA synthesis but also does not dissociate from the DNA template and RNA transcript (14Levin J.R. Chamberlin M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 61-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). According to one model, arrest is associated with backward translocation of the RNAP, which disengages the 3′-end of the transcript from the catalytic center of the enzyme. Factor-stimulated cleavage of an internal phosphodiester bond (wherever the RNAP catalytic center is positioned) results in the generation of a new 3′-OH in register with the catalytic center, which allows for renewed RNA synthesis (15von Hippel P.H. Science. 1998; 281: 660-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Evidence for this model comes from experiments indicating the RNAP catalytic site also performs the cleavage reaction (3Rudd M.D. Isban M.G. Luse D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1995; 373: 636-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) comprises an N-terminal domain (NTD) consisting of an antiparallel α-helical coiled-coil, which extends into solution, and a globular C-terminal domain (CTD). Based on the high sequence similarity, the functional similarities, and the fact that GreA and GreB have identical CD spectra, homology modeling was used to derive a structural model of GreB (21Koulich D. Orlova M. Malhotra A. Sali A. Darst S.A. Goldfarb A. Borukhov S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7201-7210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The structures led to a model of how the Gre factors interact with RNAP (20Stebbins C.E. Borukhov S. Orlova M. Polyakov A. Goldfarb A. Darst S.A.

One face of each factor is strongly acidic, whereas the opposite face, in the case of GreA, is neutral with a small basic patch and, in the case of GreB, is highly basic. It was posited that upon interaction with TECs, the acidic face of a Gre factor would be oriented away from the acidic surface of RNAP (the pI of Escherichia coli core RNAP is 5.34). Consequently, the opposite face would be positioned to interact with the TEC (20Stebbins C.E. Borukhov S. Orlova M. Polyakov A. Goldfarb A. Darst S.A. Nature. 1995; 373: 636-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 21Koulich D. Orlova M. Malhotra A. Sali A. Darst S.A. Goldfarb A. Borukhov S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7201-7210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The structural differences between the Gre factors could be related to their functional differences. GreA generally induces the cleavage of short fragments (2–3 nucleotides) from the 3′ terminus of the RNA, whereas GreB can induce cleavage of longer (2–18 nucleotides) fragments (13Borukhov S. Sagitov V. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1993; 72: 459-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Functional studies of Gre factor domains have led to the conclusion that the CTD is primarily involved in binding RNAP, whereas the NTD participates directly to induce the transcript cleavage reaction (22Koulich D. Nikiforov V. Borukhov S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 23Polyakov A. Richter C. Malhotra A. Koulich D. Borukhov S. Darst S.A. J. Mol.

Earlier, we reported the low resolution, three-dimensional structure ofE. coli core RNAP complexed with GreB (23Polyakov A. Richter C. Malhotra A. Koulich D. Borukhov S. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 262-266Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar), which localized the binding site for GreB on the RNAP structure. The present work investigates sites on GreB that are involved in interactions with RNAP and a TEC. GreB was chosen for this work because it binds to RNAP with a considerably higher affinity than GreA (24Orlova M. Intrinsic Transcript Cleavage Activity of RNA Polymerase. Institute of Molecular Genetics, Russian Academy of Science, Moscow, Russia1995Crossref Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Hydroxyl radical protein footprinting (25Loizos N. Darst S.A. Structure. 1998; 6: 691-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) was used to identify areas within GreB involved in interactions with core RNAP and a TEC, either through direct binding or indirectly through conformational changes. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis (26Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar) was used to further delineate a putative RNAP-binding region detected from both TEC and core RNAP footprints on GreB. Upon binding core and TECs, conformational changes within GreB were observed and suggest how the domains communicate with each other for proper orientation during interactions with a ligand. A modified pET-16b (Novagen) plasmid containing coding sequences for a heart muscle kinase (HMK) site directly upstream of the hexahistidine (His6) tag was used (27Kelman Z. Yao N. O'Donnell M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 166: 177-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The GreB open reading frame was inserted between the Nde I and Bam HI restriction sites of this plasmid, yielding plasmid PK-pET16Gb. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with PK-pET16Gb expressed GreB with an N-terminal HMK site (LRRASV) and His6 tag (HMK-His6-GreB) in soluble form. HMK-His6-GreB was purified as described for overexpressed wild type GreB (28Borukhov S. Goldfarb A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) with modifications. Specifically, cells were grown in 2 liters of LB medium with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) to anA 620 of 0.35. Expression of recombinant protein was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside to 1 mm, and cells were grown for an additional 3 h at 37 °C. Cells harvested by centrifugation were resuspended in lysis buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl, 5% glycerol, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed using a French press. After removal of cellular debris by centrifugation (10,000 × g , 25 min), Polymin P was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 0.3% v/v. The precipitate formed was pelleted by centrifugation (10,000 × g , 25 min) and discarded. Powdered (NH4)2SO4 was then added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 0.8 m, and the formed precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation (10,000 ×g , 25 min) and discarded. The supernatant was then dialyzed against binding buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.6m NaCl, 0.8 m(NH4)2SO4 and 5 mmimidazole) to remove EDTA and DTT prior to Ni2+-column chromatography. The sample was then loaded onto a Poros MC20 column (Perspective Biosystems) loaded with Ni2+, and bound proteins were eluted in binding buffer supplemented with 250 mm imidazole. The eluate was then applied onto a 10-ml butyl-Toyopearl TSK 650 m column pre-equilibrated in binding buffer containing 10 mm EDTA and 1 mmDTT but lacking 5 mm imidazole. The column was washed with 30 ml of this buffer and eluted with 80 ml of a linear 0.8 to 0m (NH4)2SO4 gradient in the same buffer plus 5% glycerol. The fractions containing pure HMK-His6-GreB were pooled and dialyzed into storage buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 40% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT) and kept at −20 °C. Alanine substitution mutants of HMK-His6-GreB were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene). All mutant proteins were purified as described above except the Polymin P and (NH4)2SO4precipitation steps were omitted, and E. coli lysates were applied directly onto the Poros MC20 column in lysis buffer B (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 m NaCl). The column was washed with lysis buffer B containing 45 mm imidazole prior to the elution step. Instead of being loaded onto the butyl-Toyopearl column, the MC20 column eluates were concentrated using a Millipore centrifugal filter and loaded onto a 16/60 Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, 1 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. Fractions containing pure mutant protein were pooled, dialyzed into storage buffer, and stored at −20 °C. Picomole quantities of pure TEC23 (T7A1 promoter-containing DNA template, E. coli RNAP, and 23-mer transcript) were generated in a scaled up and modified version of that described previously (29Nudler E. Avetissova E. Markovtsov V. Goldfarb A. Science. 1996; 273: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The DNA template was a polymerase chain reaction-derived 375-base pair fragment where one of the oligonucleotides used in the polymerase chain reaction was biotinylated (for immobilization during TEC formation). AHin dIII restriction site (for solubilizing TECs after formation) is located 145 bases upstream of the start point for transcription (transcribed sequence, ATCgAgAggg ACACggCgAA TAg). The RNAP holoenzyme was prepared by incubating pure core RNAP (1200 pmol) with a 1.5 molar excess of ς70 (1800 pmol) at 37 °C for 5 min in 40 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8, 80 mmammonium acetate, pH 7.8, 15% glycerol, 8 mm DTT, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, and 1 mmMgCl2. It was assumed that about 25% of the formed holoenzyme was active (300 pmol). Twenty TEC-forming reactions were performed simultaneously in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. In each reaction, 15 pmol (7.5 μl) of T7A1 promoter-containing DNA template, 15 pmol (25 μl) of active holoenzyme, and 7.5 μl of initiation buffer (IB, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2) were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. To this mix was added 25 μl of IB-equilibrated streptavidin-immobilized agarose beads (Pierce), and incubation was continued for 5 min at 25 °C. A starting mixture (10 μl) containing 150 μmCpApUpC and 187.5 μm each of ATP, GTP, and CTP was added, yielding a final concentration of 20 and 25 μm for the primer and nucleotides, respectively. After incubation for 5 min at 37 °C, the beads were washed 4 times by adding 1.5 ml of IB and mixing the beads by inverting the tube 3 times, followed by a 2–3-s spin in a table top centrifuge. One of the 4 washes contained buffer with 700 mm instead of 50 mm KCl and was incubated at 25 °C for 2 min prior to centrifugation to remove uninitiated RNAPs. The resulting TEC20 (20-mer nascent transcript) was resuspended in 125 μl of IB containing 25 μm each of ATP, UTP, and GTP and incubation continued for 7 min at 25 °C to complete the formation of the 23-mer transcript. The beads were then washed twice with 1.5 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 50 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2, and resuspended in 100 μl of the same buffer. Twenty units ofHin dIII (New England Biolabs) was added, and DNA cleavage proceeded at 25 °C for 15 min. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatants from all 20 reactions were combined. The sample was then simultaneously dialyzed (against 10 mm Mops/NaOH, pH 7.2, and 100 mm NaCl) and concentrated using a collodion membrane (25,000 or 75,000M r cut off) and all-glass collodion apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell) to a final volume of 40 μl. In pilot experiments incorporating [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) into 23-mer transcripts, it was estimated that 6 pmol of TEC product was obtained from the combined 20 reactions described above. The TEC23 product contained approximately 70% 23-mer, 5% 20-mer, and 25% remaining transcript lengths (1–22-mers), as determined by PhosphorImager analysis of transcript products in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/urea gels (see Fig.5 A ). Purified HMK-His6-GreB was 33P- (or32P)-end-labeled in a 400-μl reaction containing 40 μg (5 μm) of HMK-His6-GreB, 100 units of reconstituted HMK (Sigma; P2645), 0.05 μm[γ-33P]ATP (2000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products), 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, and 12 mm MgCl2. The kinase was reconstituted in 40 mm DTT, and 0.02 μm[γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) was substituted for [γ-33P]ATP when32P-end-labeled protein was desired. Following an incubation time of 15–20 min at 37 °C, 20 μl of Ni2+-NTA agarose beads, pre-equilibrated in buffer A (10 mm Mops/NaOH, pH 7.2, 500 mm NaCl and 10 mm MgCl2), were added, the sample was gently mixed and incubated on ice for 15 min. The beads were then pelleted and washed (washes performed as described above for TEC formation) twice with 1 ml of buffer A to remove free label. The beads were resuspended in 200 μl of buffer A plus 250 mm imidazole (1m imidazole stock solution pH to 7.5 with concentrated HCl), incubated on ice for 10 min, then pelleted by centrifugation and discarded. The 200-μl supernatant, now containing the eluted, labeled protein, was diluted with 300 μl of buffer A and concentrated in a Microcon 10 microconcentrator (Amicon) to approximately 100 μl. The sample was then diluted again with 400 μl of buffer A and re-concentrated in the same microconcentrator. These dilution and concentration steps lowered the imidazole level to <20 mm. The typical yield of labeled protein was 6 mg (285 pmol) in a 100-μl volume. Prior to each footprinting experiment, labeled GreB was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and phosphorimaging to confirm that no other contaminating proteins were labeled (data not shown). In addition, control experiments showed no incorporation of label into native GreB under the phosphorylation conditions described (data not shown). Footprinting reactions were performed at 25 °C for 20 min in a mixture containing labeled HMK-His6-GreB free or with a ligand, 10 mm Mops/NaOH (pH 7.2), 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm(NH4)2Fe(SO4)2, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm ascorbate, 1 mmH2O2. Reactions were initiated by simultaneously adding Fe-EDTA (freshly prepared complex of 10 mm(NH4)2Fe(SO4)2, 20 mm EDTA), ascorbate, and H2O2. For core RNAP footprints on HMK-His6-GreB, 25 (or 50) pmol of core was incubated with 25 pmol of HMK-His6-GreB at 25 °C for 5 min prior to the addition of cleavage reagents. The final concentrations of core and HMK-His6-GreB in these footprinting reactions were 1.2 (or 2.4) and 1.25 μm, respectively. For TEC23 footprints on HMK-His6-GreB, 2–4 pmol of TEC23 were incubated with 1 pmol of HMK-His6-GreB at 25 °C for 5 min prior to the addition of cleavage reagents, and MgCl2 was omitted from the buffer to preclude cleavage of the transcript. The final concentrations of TEC23 and HMK-His6-GreB in these footprinting reactions were 0.08 and 0.03 μm, respectively. Reactions were terminated as described (30Heyduk T. Heyduk E. Severinov K. Tang H. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10162-10166Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), products loaded onto Tricine/SDS 16.5% T, 3% C polyacrylamide gels (31Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10457) Google Scholar), and analyzed by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics model Storm). The data were analyzed as described previously (30Heyduk T. Heyduk E. Severinov K. Tang H. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10162-10166Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 32Wang Y. Severinov K. Loizos N. Fenyo D. Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Chait B.T. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 648-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, PhosphorImager intensities were integrated across full lane widths and plotted versus electrophoretic mobilities using IMAGEQUANT (Molecular Dynamics). To correct for lane-to-lane distortions, intensity plots were aligned using the program ALIGN (30Heyduk T. Heyduk E. Severinov K. Tang H. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10162-10166Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Subsequent data analysis was performed using Microsoft EXCEL. Intensity plots were normalized to correct for gel loading and cleavage efficiencies, and electrophoretic mobilities were converted into the position of the cleavage site in the primary sequence of GreB. Difference plots, (I complex − I GreB)/(I complex + I GreB) versus residue number, were calculated (where I complex is the corrected intensity for the complex, and I GreB is the corrected intensity for GreB alone). Ten difference plots were generated from four independent experiments for the Core/GreB interaction and three difference plots were generated from two independent experiments for the TEC/GreB interaction. Core/GreB complex − GreB and TEC/GreB complex − GreB difference plots were each averaged and used in the determination of regions of statistically significant protections. We tested the statistical significance of the differences between the (GreB − GreB) control experiments and the (Core/GreB complex − GreB) and (TEC/GreB complex − GreB) experiments using a Student'st test for small samples with unequal variances. There were no statistically significant differences between independent data sets of GreB − GreB. Molecular weight standards were generated by residue-specific cleavage (30Heyduk T. Heyduk E. Severinov K. Tang H. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10162-10166Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) of HMK-His6-GreB in reactions containing CNBr (methionine-specific), endoproteinase Lys-C (lysine-specific), endoproteinase Glu-C (glutamic acid-specific), or endoproteinase AspN (aspartic acid-specific). Knowledge of the residue specificity for each endoproteinase, as well as the primary amino acid sequence for GreB, allowed us to determine how many bands (i.e. molecular weight standards) and their mobilities relative to each other would be generated under limited cleavage conditions. Reaction mixtures (6 μl) containing 10 mmMops/NaOH, pH 7.2, 230 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 7% glycerol, the indicated amounts of core RNAP, and 32P-labeled GreB derivatives (166 nm for experiments shown in Fig. 4, A and B , 125 nm for experiments shown in Fig. 4, C andD ) were incubated for 5 min at 25 °C. Following the incubation, 1 μl of each reaction was loaded onto a 4–15% gradient PhastGel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and run for 160 V-h at 15 °C using native buffer strips. Gels were visualized by phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics Storm), and intensities of core-GreB derivative complexes were quantitated using Imagequant (Molecular Dynamics). The amount of bound derivative was determined by multiplying the intensity value for the complexes [I ] by the amount of derivative in 1 μl of a reaction [A ] divided by the total intensity value for 1 μl of a reaction [I t] (I × A /I t). The total intensity value was determined by spotting 1 μl of a reaction into the gel after an electrophoresis run and quantitating the spot intensity. For end-labeling GreB, a derivative containing an N-terminal heart muscle kinase (HMK) recognition site, hexahistidine tag (His6), and 9-amino acid linker was generated. This GreB derivative (HMK-His6-GreB), containing 22 non-native N-terminal amino acids in total, behaved as wild type GreB by several criteria. First, HMK-His6-GreB was soluble when overexpressed in E. coli . Second, it was equally active inin vitro transcript cleavage assays (Fig.1). Third, it bound core RNAP in a direct assay for binding to RNAP in tubular crystals (23Polyakov A. Richter C. Malhotra A. Koulich D. Borukhov S. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 262-266Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Finally, it bound core RNAP in a native gel-shift assay (see Fig. 4) with an affinity essentially the same as that observed for WT GreB. The dissociation constant (K d) for HMK-His6-GreB was approximately 0.87 × 10−7m, compared with a K d of 1–2 × 10−7m in the case of WT GreB (24Orlova M. Intrinsic Transcript Cleavage Activity of RNA Polymerase. Institute of Molecular Genetics, Russian Academy of Science, Moscow, Russia1995Crossref Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 A shows the range of fragments generated by hydroxyl radical cleavage of HMK-His6-GreB free in solution. The molecular weights of the cleaved fragments, and thus the sites of radical cleavage, were interpolated from the standard curve of log(M r)versus relative mobility (Fig. 2 B ). The cleavage profile revealed areas of GreB that were more sensitive to radical cleavage than others (Figs. 2, A and C , and6 A ). Beyond about residue 140, the cleavage profile was overwhelmed by the large peak of radioactivity due to uncleaved GreB and could not be analyzed (green in Fig. 6 A ). The region most susceptible to cleavage, centered at residue 38, is the loop (L1) at the tip of the NTD coiled-coil. Other preferentially cleaved areas are just at the beginning of the L2 loop (centered at residue 78), the C-terminal end of β3, and the loop connecting β3 and β4 (centered at residue 94), part of the exposed loop L3 (centered at residue 107), α3 (centered at residue 125), and the loop connecting α3 and β6 (centered at residue 132). There is a good correlation between solvent accessibility (according to the modeled structure) and susceptibility to radical cleavage (Fig. 6 A ). Essentially all the regions of the backbone susceptible to radical cleavage are relatively exposed, although not all regions that appear to be exposed are susceptible to cleavage.Figure 6Hydroxyl radical protein footprinting and alanine-scanning mutagenesis results mapped onto the GreB model.Shown are backbone representations of the GreB model, determined by homology modeling from the GreA crystal structure (20Stebbins C.E.

These two residues are within the region of GreB protected from radical cleavage by both core RNAP (B ) and TEC (D ), and alanine substitutions at these positions were found to impair binding to RNAP (Fig. 4).

Although this refolded derivative was active in transcript cleavage assays, dynamic light scattering showed it to be somewhat aggregated. The presence of aggregates or possibly a fraction of misfolded proteins in a preparation of the C-terminal derivative could affect cleavage susceptibility to hydroxyl radicals and thereby complicate the analysis of cleavage profiles. Indeed, the hydroxyl radical cleavage profile for GreB-His6-HMK was altered when c"

We used the progesterone receptor DNA binding domain and selected for mutants that gained the ability to bind to the ERE. We used a mutagenesis protocol based on degenerate oligonucleotides to create a large and diverse pool of mutants in which 10 nonconsensus amino acids in the DNA recognition helix of the progesterone receptor DNA binding domain were randomly mutated. After a single cycle of modified P22 challenge phage selection, 37 mutant proteins were identified, all of which lost the ability to bind to the progesterone response element. In gel mobility shift assays, approximately 70% of the genetically selected mutants bound to the consensus ERE with a >4-fold higher affinity than the naturally occurring estrogen receptor DBD. In the P-box region of the DNA recognition helix, the selected mutants contained the amino acids found in the wild-type estrogen receptor DBD, as well as other amino acid combinations seen in naturally occurring steroid/nuclear receptors that bind the aGGTCA half-site. We also obtained high affinity DBDs with Trp585 as the first amino acid of the P-box, although this is not found in the known steroid/nuclear receptors. In the linker region between the two zinc fingers, G597R was by far the most common mutation. In transient transfections in mammalian cells using promoter interference assays, the mutants displayed enhanced affinity for the ERE. When linked to an activation domain, the transfected mutants activated transcription from ERE-containing reporter genes.We conclude that the P-box amino acids can display considerable variation and that the little studied linker amino acids play an important role in determining affinity for the ERE. This work also demonstrates that the P22 challenge phage genetic selection system, modified for use with a mammalian protein, provides a novel, single cycle selection for steroid/nuclear receptor DBDs with altered specificity and greatly enhanced affinity for their response elements.

Individual proteins within the superfamily must bind to their DNA response elements with high specificity and affinity. The steroid/nuclear receptors bind to a specific DNA sequence, termed a hormone response element (HRE).1 In general, HREs are composed of two core sequences 5′-AGNNCA-3′ that are separated by a spacer region of 0–6 nucleotides and are arranged as either a direct repeat or an inverted or everted palindrome. Recognition of HREs by steroid/nuclear receptors is mediated through a DNA binding domain (DBD) of 65–70 amino acids. The core DBD is highly conserved (3Parker M.G. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1998; 63: 45-50PubMed Google Scholar). Structural analyses of several DBDs (5Schwabe J.W.R. Chapman L. Finch T. Rhodes D.

The first helix in the N-terminal zinc finger, called the DNA recognition helix, is important for specific DNA binding. Upon interaction of the DBD with the HRE, amino acid side chains in the recognition helix make sequence-specific contacts with nucleotides exposed in the major groove of the DNA. A dimerization surface, called the D-box, found in the second helix allows the DBD to recognize the two HRE half sites as a dimer. Mutational analyses (9Mader S. Kumar V. Verneuil H.D. Chambon P.

Nature (Lond.). 1991; 352: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar) to discriminate between their respective HREs is at least partially due to three amino acids in the DNA recognition helix of the DBD, called the P-box (11Umesono K. Evans R.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 1139-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). However, further analysis demonstrated that not all of the side chains of the defined P-box triplet contact the bases of their DNA target. Many contacts involve nucleotides common to both the estrogen response element (ERE) and the progesterone response element/glucocorticoid response element (PRE/GRE) and involve contacts with the side chains of amino acids conserved in the ER-DBDs and GR-DBDs. Of course, several other factors play a role in DNA binding, including steric hindrance, expulsion of water molecules or ions (12Arbuckle N.D. Luisi B. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 13Kosztin D. Schulten K. Biophys.

Biol. 1992; 12: 2037-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) upon DNA-protein interaction. The reduced ability to activate transcription of a mutant ER in which the P-box amino acid triplet has been changed to alter binding specificity from the ERE to the PRE/GRE (9Mader S. Kumar V. Verneuil H.D. Chambon P. Nature. 1989; 338: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) suggests that additional amino acids may play a role in determining affinity for the HRE. We therefore employed discrimination between the ERE and the PRE/GRE as a system for identifying additional amino acids important in binding of a DBD to an HRE. In the natural process of protein evolution and selection, proteins containing random mutations that confer an advantage on the cell are selected from the large number of neutral or deleterious mutations that occur over time. To simulate the process of natural selection in shifting DNA binding specificity from the ERE to the PRE/GRE, we needed both a system for producing large numbers of mutants with random amino acid changes and a powerful selection for the relatively rare mutant DBDs exhibiting the desired ERE binding properties. We developed a rapid and simple procedure for saturation mutagenesis of a short region of a protein using degenerate oligonucleotides and Pfu DNA polymerase. To select the mutants from this large mutant pool that had gained the ability to recognize the ERE, we adapted the powerful P22 challenge phage (15Maloy S. Youderian P. Methods Genet. 1994; 3: 205-233PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lee E.C. Hales L.M. Gumport R.I. Gardner J.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Numrych T.E. Gardner J.F. Semin. Virol. 1995; 6: 5-13Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar) system for use with a vertebrate protein. In the P22 system, substantial numbers of mutants are screened in a single selection cycle using a life-death selection. In this work, we show that the P22 challenge phage selection system can be used to select for mutants exhibiting a substantial change in DNA binding specificity. The P22 challenge phage selection system provides a new tool for engineering steroid/nuclear receptor DBDs with a desired DNA binding specificity and affinity. To facilitate identification of amino acids important in discrimination between the ERE and the PRE/GRE, it seemed critical to identify the amino acid changes that accompany a shift in DNA binding specificity from the PRE/GRE to the ERE. Because the PR-DBD binds to the PRE/GRE with a higher affinity than the GR-DBD (18Petz L.N. Nardulli A.M. Kim J. Horwitz K.B. Freedman L.P. Shapiro D.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 60: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we employed the PR-DBD in these studies. We selected and identified mutant PR-DBDs containing amino acid sequences exhibiting high affinity binding to the ERE. We find that the first and third P-box amino acids are the most critical residues for DNA binding specificity, and that mutation of amino acids in the linker region can lead to DBDs whose affinity for the ERE is severalfold higher than that exhibited by the wild-type ER-DBD. Salmonella typhimurium LT2:MS 1582 carrying P22 c2 + mnt −prophage MS1868, MS1883 (15Maloy S. Youderian P. Methods Genet. 1994; 3: 205-233PubMed Google Scholar) and phage P22 mnt::Kan9 arc(Am)H1065 (15Maloy S. Youderian P. Methods Genet. 1994; 3: 205-233PubMed Google Scholar) were used in the challenge phage assays.Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI) was used for protein expression with a vector derived from the pET21b(+) plasmid (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI). To construct P22 phage carrying the ERE at −3 relative to the transcription start site of theant promoter (Pant), we inserted a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the consensus ERE (5′-AGGTCAcagTGACCT-3′) into the Sma I site of pPY190, which carries a ∼500-bp DNA fragment of phage P22 imm I DNA cloned into theEco RI–Hin dIII sites of pBR322 (15Maloy S. Youderian P. Methods Genet. 1994; 3: 205-233PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pPY190 containing the ERE was transformed by electroporation intoS. typhimurium MS1883 (15Maloy S. Youderian P. Methods Genet. 1994; 3: 205-233PubMed Google Scholar), and the cells infected by P22 mnt::Kan9arc(Am)H1065 and recombinant phages were selected as a large clear plaque and purified twice on a lawn of MS1582. High titer phage lysates were prepared and purified from MS1883 (15Maloy S. Youderian P. Methods Genet. 1994; 3: 205-233PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of the ERE in the P22 phage was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmid pBAD ER-DBD containing the ER-DBD gene under the control of the arabinose promoter (19Guzman L-M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3940) Google Scholar) was constructed from pCMVhER by three successive cycles of polymerase chain reaction amplification. This generated a Sna BI site followed by a Shine-Delgarno sequence and a unique Nhe I site at the 5′-end, and anEco RI site, stop codon, and Hin dIII site at the 3′-end. The final product was digested with Sna BI andHin dIII and cloned into pBAD18 (19Guzman L-M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3940) Google Scholar) digested withNhe I and filled in with the Klenow fragment to give a blunt end DNA and consecutively digested with Hin dIII. To prepare plasmid pBAD PR-DBD, the PR-DBD gene from plasmid pGST-PR-DBD (18Petz L.N. Nardulli A.M. Kim J. Horwitz K.B. Freedman L.P. Shapiro D.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 60: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) was digested with Nhe I and Eco RI and ligated into pBAD ER-DBD digested with the same enzymes. Saturated random mutagenesis of the PR-DBD recognition helix was carried out by a modified mutagenesis protocol we developed. Two PR-DBD complementary primers were used, with D denoting degenerate nucleotides; 5′-GGTGTCCTTACCTGTDDDDDDTGTAAGDDDTTCTTTAAGAGGDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDTACTTATGTGCTGGA-3′ and 5′-TCCAGCACATAAGTADDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDCTTCTTAAAGAADDDCTTACADDDDDDACAGGTAAGGACACC-3′. The nucleotides were randomized with a 17% degeneracy at a 3:3:2:2 ratio of A:C:G:T. The primers were incorporated into plasmid DNA by extension around the plasmid in a 50-μl reaction with 2.5 units ofPfu DNA polymerase in 1× Pfu buffer (Stratagene), 0.15 fmol of circular plasmid pBAD PR-DBD, and 4.8 pmol of each degenerate primer. The extension reaction was carried out in a thermocycler for 18 cycles with 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 50 °C, and 12 min at 68 °C. These extension and amplification conditions differ from those in a recently described Pfu mutagenesis protocol (20Parikh A. Guengerich F.P. BioTechniques. 1998; 24: 428-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The nicked circular DNA products were digested for 1 h at 37 °C in the same buffer with 10 units ofDpn I (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and directly transformed into S. typhimurium host cells by electroporation at 1600 V, 25 microfarads, 200 ohms for screening and selection or into E. coli DH5α to prepare DNA for sequencing. S. typhimurium MS1868 was transformed by electroporation with the pool of mutated pBAD PR-DBD DNA, plated on LB plates containing 0.2% glucose and 75 μg/ml Timentin (SmithKline Beecham, Philadelphia, PA), and incubated overnight at 37 °C. For each challenge phage assay, ∼5,000 colonies were pooled and grown in LB liquid media containing 0.2% glucose and 75 μg/ml Timentin to an A 600 of ∼0.6. Bacteria were pelleted and resuspended in LB medium containing 1% arabinose and 75 μg/ml Timentin to an A 600of ∼0.2. After 1 h, 100 μl of cells were mixed with the P22-ERE phage lysate at a multiplicity of infection of ∼25 and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The infected cells were plated on LB agar containing 1% arabinose, 75 μg/ml Timentin, and 50 μg/ml kanamycin and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Plasmids from lysogens grown on selective medium were purified and sequenced. The T7 expression plasmid pET21PR-DBD, which produces FLAG-PR-DBD, was constructed by cloning the 276-base pair Nhe I–Eco RI fragment from pBAD PR mutants into the Nhe I and Eco RI sites of plasmid pET21b(+)ER-DBD (21Kuntz M.A. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27949-27956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Plasmid pET21PR-DBD mutants and pET21ER-DBD were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLys; plated on LB agar containing 0.2% glucose, 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 150 μg/ml ampicillin; and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The bacteria on the plate were pooled and grown in LB liquid medium containing the same concentrations of glucose and antibiotics used on the plates, to an A 600 of ∼0.6. Bacteria were then pelleted and resuspended in LB medium containing 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 150 μg/ml ampicillin for 3 h at 37 °C in order to induce protein expression. FLAG-ER-DBD, FLAG-PR-DBD, and the selected FLAG PR-DBD mutants were purified to near homogeneity by immunoaffinity chromatography using the M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody and elution with FLAG peptide (22Chiang C-M. Roeder R.G. Peptide Res. 1993; 6: 62-64PubMed Google Scholar). Gel mobility shift assays were performed essentially as we have described (21Kuntz M.A. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27949-27956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The reactions were carried out in 20 μl in reaction buffer containing 50 mmKCl, 15 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 4 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25 ng of poly(dI-dC), and 10% glycerol. Free probe and protein-DNA complexes were quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). HepG2 cells were transfected with a total of 8 μg of DNA including 100 ng of the CMV-(ERE)2-CAT promoter interference reporter plasmid (23Reese J.C. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the indicated amounts of CMV-FLAG-DBD expression plasmid, 400 ng of pCMV-luciferase (23Reese J.C. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and carrier DNA (pTZ18U). 20–24 h after transfection, the cells were subjected to a 3-min shock in 20% glycerol, fed with fresh medium, and harvested 40–48 h after the glycerol shock. Cell lysates were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity. CAT activity was determined by our mixed phase assay (24Nielsen D.A. Chang T-C. Shapiro D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed as described above with some modifications. HepG2 cells were transfected with a total of 8 μg of DNA including 2 μg of (ERE)4-TATA-luciferase reporter plasmid, 2G. De Haan, S. Chusacultanachai, and D. J. Shapiro, submitted for publication. 40 ng of pRL-Renilla luciferase internal control plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI), one of the pCMV-DBD-VP16 expression plasmids, and pTZ18U as carrier DNA. Dual luciferase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). Both wild-type ER-DBD and high affinity ERE binding mutants expressed in E. coli or in the Salmonella typhimurium used in the challenge phage assay are highly toxic to the bacteria. Evidence that the ability of the DBDs to bind to ERE sequences was critical to their toxicity came from our observation that ER-DBD mutants, which had lost the ability to bind to the ERE in vitro , were not toxic in E. coli (data not shown). We concluded that the plasmid loss and cell death that resulted from toxicity of the ERE binding DBDs was due to the presence of nine consensus EREs (cEREs) in the E. coli genome (NCBI number U00096). We found that expression from the tightly regulated arabinose promoter (19Guzman L-M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3940) Google Scholar) minimized toxicity when the inducer was absent. We also replaced the ampicillin in the growth medium with Timentin, a combination of clavulanic acid and ticarcillin, which more effectively blocks growth of bacteria that have lost the expression plasmid and no longer produce β-lactamase. Challenge phage are derivatives of bacteriophage P22 that are designed to study protein-nucleic acid interactionsin vivo (15Maloy S. Youderian P. Methods Genet. 1994; 3: 205-233PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of the imm I region makes bacteriophage P22 especially well suited to genetic selections based on lysis or lysogeny. The imm I region is not present in bacteriophage λ. We use Salmonella , not E. coli , because P22 cannot infect E. coli . Upon infection with a P22 challenge phage, the decision between lysis of the infectedSalmonella and lysogeny is controlled by expression of theant gene, whose product, the antirepressor (Ant), prevents the establishment and maintenance of lysogeny. Our challenge phage contain a cERE (aGGTCAcagTGACCt) inserted into the ant promoter at −3 relative to the transcription start site. We selected for mutant PR-DBDs that bound with high affinity to the ERE. If an infected host cell transformed with the PR-DBD mutant pool does not express a mutant PR-DBD that binds to the ERE, the cell is killed by the P22 phage. If an infected cell expresses a mutant PR-DBD that binds with good affinity to the ERE, the cell survives, because binding of the mutant DBD to the ERE blocks ant transcription. In addition, since the challenge phage carry a Kan9 , cassette, lysogens can be selected as kanamycin- and ampicillin-resistant colonies (Fig. 1). While this system had found significant application, it had not previously been used with a vertebrate protein. Since our application of the challenge phage selection required a single step selection of mutant proteins exhibiting a substantial change in DNA sequence specificity, in preliminary studies we tested the effectiveness of the selection system. To determine the background of false positive colonies, 107 S. typhimurium host cells were transformed with different ratios of a control plasmid (pBAD PR-DBD) that produces wild-type PR-DBD, which does not bind to the ERE. The system was spiked with various ratios of the positive plasmid (pBAD ER-DBD) expressing the ER-DBD, which should produce lysogens with the P22-ERE phage. No lysogens were detected when 107 cells expressing PR were challenged. When the positive control cells containing the pBAD ER-DBD plasmid were added at a ratio of 1 pBAD ER-DBD:106 pBAD PR-DBD cells, five lysogens were obtained. Increasing numbers of lysogens were detected with higher ratios of cells expressing the ER-DBD relative to the PR-DBD (TableI). These data show that the challenge phage selections exhibited an exceptionally low background of <1 false positive lysogen in 107 and that a single positive cell can be readily detected in a single selection cycle from a background of 106 negative cells.Table IThe challenge phage assay can identify one mutant in >106negative cellsPositive cells with ER-DBD:Negative cells with PR-DBD1-a107 cells containing different ratios of positive control plasmid (pBADER-DBD) and negative control plasmid (pBADPR-DBD) were challenged with P22-ERE phage as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Number of lysogens0:10701:10651:105331:1042121:10312441-a 107 cells containing different ratios of positive control plasmid (pBADER-DBD) and negative control plasmid (pBADPR-DBD) were challenged with P22-ERE phage as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab To study the roles of amino acids in the recognition helix in ERE binding, we had to consider the strong selective pressure against changes in the zinc finger region of the DBD (26Weiler I.J. Lew D. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To avoid generating a pool in which almost all of the mutants had lost their ability to bind to the ERE, we created a pool of mutants that averaged three mutations per protein. We did not mutate the amino acids conserved in the ER and PR-DBDs, which are known to be important for maintaining the structure and function of the protein (amino acids 587–588 and 590–593 in PR). We randomly mutated the nonconsensus amino acids shown in boldface type585 GSCKVFFKRAMEGQHN 600in the PR-DBD recognition helix (Ref. 27Kastner P. Krust A. Turcotte B. Stropp U. Tora L. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1603-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar; TableII). We tried several mutagenesis methods including error-prone polymerase chain reaction (28Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods Applications. 1992; 2: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 29Leung D.W. Chen E. Goeddel D.V. Technique. 1989; 1: 11-15Google Scholar). The only mutagenesis method to achieve the requisite density and localization of mutations was a protocol we developed using Pfu DNA polymerase. In this protocol, a pool of oligonucleotides, degenerate in the region of interest and containing complementary sequence encoding the wild-type sequence at both ends, was prepared and annealed to the wild-type pBAD PR-DBD, and the mutations were incorporated by extension with Pfu DNA polymerase (see “Experimental Procedures”). Parental wild-type plasmids were eliminated by digestion withDpn I. The mutant pool was transformed directly into bacterial cells without ligation, resulting in a library size of approximately 109 per set of degenerate oligonucleotide primers. Sequencing individual mutants prior to selection demonstrated that they contained the expected distribution and frequency of random mutations (data not shown). This mutagenesis strategy provides a rapid, simple, and effective way to create a highly saturated mutant library with a controlled mutation rate.Table IIRelative binding affinity of the PR-DBD specificity switch mutants for the concensus ERE, PRE/GRE, and pS2 EREMutantRelative binding affinity2-aBinding of WT ER-DBD to the consensus ERE and of the WT PR-DBD to the PRE/GRE were set equal to 100.

Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1984; 35: 15-44Crossref Google Scholar). The loss of photosynthetic productivity that occurs when organisms are exposed to visible light quanta above the level required for saturating photosynthetic electron flow is known as “photoinhibition” (2Kyle D.J. Kyle D.J. Osmond C.B. Arntzen C.J. Photoinhibition. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1987: 197-226Google Scholar). Under photoinhibitory conditions, the reaction center of photosystem (PS)1 II, which consists of D1 and D2 proteins (3Nanba O. Satoh K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 109-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is specifically inactivated (4Prasil O. Adir N. Ohad I. Barber J. The Photosystems: Structure, Function and Molecular Biology.

Acta. 1993; 1143: 113-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanisms of photoinactivation have not been fully elucidated, the process involves several steps, including an initial reversible reduction of electron flow and irreversible damage to the D1 protein (6Mattoo A.K.

Although site-specific mutagenesis seldom confers new function, this technique has produced some mutants in which PSII and D1 gained partial resistance to high irradiance (9Mäenpää P. Kallio T.

In vitro random mutagenesis, ideally saturation mutagenesis, coupled with appropriate methods for screening mutants, is a useful method to obtain new species of D1 protein that are phototolerant. For these experiments, we have chosen the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. In addition to having plant-like photosynthetic activity,Synechocystis can be genetically transformed at high efficiency and can be easily screened as colonies under defined conditions (13Dzelzkalns V.A. Bogorad L. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 964-971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONWhat events occur prior to bleaching in cyanobacterial cells under irradiance? The cell-doubling times of the control strain KC and all mutants were nearly identical at approximately 24 h under irradiance at 500 μmol m−2 s−1 (data not shown), when the control strain gradually bleached. Therefore, bleaching is an event primarily independent of cell growth. Superoxide anion radical known as the primary product of oxygen photoreduction in thylakoids (27Asada K. Foyer C.H. Mullineaux P.M. Causes of Photooxidative Stress and Amelioration of Defense Systems in Plants. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1994: 77-104Google Scholar) may degrade photosynthetic pigments. Absorption spectra of the control strain KC and mutant G3 as determined time-sequentially after exposure to irradiance indicate that chlorophyll a content diminishes specifically during bleaching in the control strain (28Narusaka Y. Murakami A. Saeki M. Kobayashi H. Satoh K. Plant Sci. 1996; 115: 261-266Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This observation is contrary to the phenomenon ofsodB − mutant of the cyanobacteriumSynechococcus sp PCC 7942, which is deficient in functional iron superoxide dismutase (29Thomas D.J. Avenson T.J. Thomas J.B. Herbert S.K. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 1593-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), where the carotenoid-to-chlorophyll ratio strikingly decreased when cultured in the presence of methyl viologen. Active oxygen species have also been reported to degrade D1 protein (30Miyao M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9722-9730Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), in relation to “damage-repair cycle of D1 protein” (26Greenberg B.M. Gaba V. Mattoo A.K. Edelman M.

In the present investigation, the rate of degradation of D1 protein did not change in the wild-type and mutant strains under irradiance (Fig. 4). Therefore, the possibility that generation of oxygen radicals is reduced in the mutants may be excluded.Phototolerance associated with PSII in photosynthetic organisms has been suggested to occur by one or more mechanisms: (i) an efficient energy dissipation or leakage at the stage of excitation energy transfer in the pigment system (33Weis E. Berry J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 894: 198-208Crossref Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 34Demmig-Adams B. Biochim. Biophys.

Fertilizer Res. 1990; 25: 199-211Google Scholar), and (ii) an efficient electron leakage via some kind of cyclic electron flow around the PSII in the electron transport system due to instability or redox potential change of the primary or secondary reactants as detected by shifts in thermoluminescence bands (40Thompson L.K. Brudvig G.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6653-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 41Telfer A. Rivas J.D.L. Barber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1060: 106-114Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar). It is hypothesized that redox signaling can regulate gene expression (42Allen J.F. Alexciev K. Hakansson G. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 869-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 43Allen J.F. Physiol. Plant. 1995; 93: 196-205Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and physical linkage that facilitates energy transfer between light-harvesting complex II and PSII/PSI (44Allen J.F. Nilsson A. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 863-868Crossref Google Scholar, 45Vener A.V. VanKan P.J.M. Rich P.R. Ohad I. Andersson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 46Gal A. Zer H. Ohad I. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 869-885Crossref Google Scholar) through protein phosphorylation. The redox sensor is postulated to be an electron carrier located between PSII and PSI (42Allen J.F. Alexciev K. Hakansson G. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 869-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and a kinase is activated by a reduced cytochrome b/f complex interacting with a plastoquinol at the QB site (46Gal A. Zer H. Ohad I. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 869-885Crossref Google Scholar).Our preliminary analysis of the thermoluminescence profiles indicates that changes by the mutagenesis of D1 in the equilibrium between QA and QB due to (i) changes in their stability including redox-potential and (ii) low efficiency of electron transport in PSII, could explain the observed phototolerance (47Minagawa J. Narusaka Y. Inoue Y. Satoh K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 770-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Analysis of the fluorescence measurements indicates that these mutants perform low quantum-yield electron flow in PSII (47Minagawa J. Narusaka Y. Inoue Y. Satoh K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 770-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that mutated D1 proteins influence redox signaling and in this way interfere with down-regulation of the biogenesis of the photosynthetic apparatus. This may explain the retention of cell pigmentation in these mutants under high irradiance. These hypotheses in turn suggest the existence of an intrinsic protection mechanism in wild-type cells that copes with photoinhibition by down-regulating phycobilisome formation.In phototolerant mutant species of D1, most amino acid conversions involved changes from nonpolar species to polar or charged ones,i.e. to Ser (32%), Asp (14%), Arg (7%), and Tyr (5%); the conversion of Phe to Ser occurred most often. This may indicate the increase in the hydrophilic or hydrogen-bonding interactions in the D1 protein is responsible for the enhanced phototolerance of the organism. Interestingly, Ser → Phe substitution in the lumenal loop of the D2 protein (48Ermakova-Gerdes S. Shestakov S. Vermaas W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) appears to endow PSII with photosensitivity. Further biophysical analysis of cyanobacterial cells harboring the mutated species of D1 is needed to prove this proposal. Although photosynthetic organisms require light for growth, they can suffer damage from high light intensity, especially at low temperatures and reduced concentrations of CO2 (1Powles S.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1984; 35: 15-44Crossref Google Scholar). The loss of photosynthetic productivity that occurs when organisms are exposed to visible light quanta above the level required for saturating photosynthetic electron flow is known as “photoinhibition” (2Kyle D.J. Kyle D.J. Osmond C.B. Arntzen C.J. Photoinhibition. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1987: 197-226Google Scholar). Under photoinhibitory conditions, the reaction center of photosystem (PS)1 II, which consists of D1 and D2 proteins (3Nanba O. Satoh K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 109-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is specifically inactivated (4Prasil O. Adir N. Ohad I. Barber J. The Photosystems: Structure, Function and Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1992: 295-348Crossref Google Scholar, 5Aro E.-M. Virgin I. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 113-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanisms of photoinactivation have not been fully elucidated, the process involves several steps, including an initial reversible reduction of electron flow and irreversible damage to the D1 protein (6Mattoo A.K. Hoffman-Falk H. Marder J.B. Edelman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1380-1384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ohad I. Kyle D.J. Arntzen C.J. J.

Recovery of PSII activity can occur when irreversibly photodamaged D1 is replaced by newly synthesized protein (7Ohad I. Kyle D.J. Arntzen C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Site-directed or deletion mutagenesis has been employed to investigate the basic mechanisms of the photosensitivity, including the relationships between the structure and function of D1 (9Mäenpää P.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14919-14927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although site-specific mutagenesis seldom confers new function, this technique has produced some mutants in which PSII and D1 gained partial resistance to high irradiance (9Mäenpää P. Kallio T. Mulo P. Salih G. Aro E.-M. Tyystjärvi E. Jansson C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 22: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 10Tyystjärvi T. Aro E.-M. Jansson C. Mäenpää P. Plant Mol.

In vitro random mutagenesis, ideally saturation mutagenesis, coupled with appropriate methods for screening mutants, is a useful method to obtain new species of D1 protein that are phototolerant. For these experiments, we have chosen the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. In addition to having plant-like photosynthetic activity,Synechocystis can be genetically transformed at high efficiency and can be easily screened as colonies under defined conditions (13Dzelzkalns V.A. Bogorad L. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 964-971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DISCUSSIONWhat events occur prior to bleaching in cyanobacterial cells under irradiance? The cell-doubling times of the control strain KC and all mutants were nearly identical at approximately 24 h under irradiance at 500 μmol m−2 s−1 (data not shown), when the control strain gradually bleached. Therefore, bleaching is an event primarily independent of cell growth. Superoxide anion radical known as the primary product of oxygen photoreduction in thylakoids (27Asada K. Foyer C.H. Mullineaux P.M. Causes of Photooxidative Stress and Amelioration of Defense Systems in Plants. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1994: 77-104Google Scholar) may degrade photosynthetic pigments. Absorption spectra of the control strain KC and mutant G3 as determined time-sequentially after exposure to irradiance indicate that chlorophyll a content diminishes specifically during bleaching in the control strain (28Narusaka Y. Murakami A. Saeki M. Kobayashi H. Satoh K. Plant Sci. 1996; 115: 261-266Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This observation is contrary to the phenomenon ofsodB − mutant of the cyanobacteriumSynechococcus sp PCC 7942, which is deficient in functional iron superoxide dismutase (29Thomas D.J. Avenson T.J. Thomas J.B. Herbert S.K. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 1593-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), where the carotenoid-to-chlorophyll ratio strikingly decreased when cultured in the presence of methyl viologen. Active oxygen species have also been reported to degrade D1 protein (30Miyao M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9722-9730Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), in relation to “damage-repair cycle of D1 protein” (26Greenberg B.M. Gaba V. Mattoo A.K. Edelman M.

https://openalex.org/W2022719876,"Factors regulating retinal biosynthesis in halobacteria are not clearly understood. In halobacteria, events leading to the biosynthesis of bacteriorhodopsin have been proposed to participate in stringent regulation of retinal biosynthesis. The present study describes a novel approach of in vivo introductions of mRNA and membrane proteins via liposome fusion to test their role in cellular metabolism. Both the bacterioopsin-encoding mRNA and the liposome-encapsulated bacterioopsin (apoprotein) are independently introduced in spheroplasts of the purple membrane-negative strain Halobacterium salinarium that initially contain neither bacterioopsin nor retinal. Isoprenoid analyses of these cells indicate that the expression/presence of bacterioopsin triggers retinal biosynthesis from lycopene, and its subsequent binding to opsin generates bacteriorhodopsin. When bacteriorhodopsin and excess retinal were independently introduced into spheroplasts of purple membrane-negative cells, the introduction of bacteriorhodopsin resulted in an accumulation of lycopene, indicating an inhibition of retinal biosynthesis. These results provide direct evidence that the formation of bacterioopsin acts as a trigger for lycopene conversion to β-carotene in retinal biosynthesis. The trigger for this event does not lie with either transcription or translation of the bop gene. It is clearly associated with the folded and the membrane-integrated state of bacterioopsin. On the other hand, the trigger signaling inhibition of retinal biosynthesis does not lie with the presence of excess retinal but with the correctly folded, retinal-bound form, bacteriorhodopsin.

FEBS Lett. 1990; 265: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Retinal acts as a chromophore and is essential for the light-induced activity of these retinal proteins. In the case of bacteriorhodopsin (bR),1the apoprotein bacterioopsin (bOp) is attached toall-trans -retinal via the Lys-216 residue to form the chromoprotein bR (6Rothschild K.J. Argade P.V. Earnest T.N. Huang K.S. London E. Liao M.J. Bayley H. Khorana H.G. Herzfeld J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8592-8595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In halobacteria, intermediates in the pathway of retinal biosynthesis are well characterized, and its final biosynthetic stages are known to involve the cyclization of lycopene to β-carotene, followed by an oxidation of β-carotene to all-trans -retinal (7Sumper M. Reitmeier H. Oesterhelt D. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1976; 15: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Early studies indicate that retinal biosynthesis in halobacteria may be stringently regulated, and factors involved in such a control remain poorly understood. There are four possible regulatory factors: (a ) transcriptional events leading to bacterioopsin mRNA, (b ) the translation of bop mRNA to bacterioopsin protein, (c ) all-trans -retinal, and (d ) the folded chromoprotein bacteriorhodopsin. In this study, we report a new approach to understand the regulating factors involved in retinal biosynthesis in halobacteria. In particular, this approach involves the in vivo introduction of mRNA or membrane proteins via liposome fusion into halobacterial spheroplasts. Three potential regulatory elements, bop mRNA (the transcriptional product of the bop gene), bOp (the translational product), and bR (the final refolded protein), were independently introduced into spheroplasts of purple membrane-negative (Pum−) strains that initially contain neither bacterioopsin nor retinal. Subsequent isoprenoid analysis shows that bacterioopsin triggers the biosynthesis of retinal. Furthermore, to determine the regulation leading to inhibition of retinal biosynthesis, both excess retinal and chromoprotein bR were independently introduced into Pum− spheroplasts. These results show that although bacterioopsin triggers retinal biosynthesis, it is the formation of bacteriorhodopsin and not the excess of retinal that inhibits its biosynthesis. Synthetic oligonucleotides were custom synthesized from Genetech Associates (Mumbai, India). Restriction enzymes and other enzymes such as T7 RNA polymerase were purchased from Bangalore Genei (Bangalore, India). Other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. N -NBD-PE and N -Rh-PE were obtained from Molecular Probes. 1,2-Dimyristoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and CHAPS were purchased from Fluka Inc. (Buchs, Switzerland). Lipofectin was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Bacto yeast extract and Bacto-tryptone were obtained from Difco. all-trans -Retinal was a kind gift from Dr. A. K. Singh (Chemistry Department, Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, Mumbai, India). Pum− strains were obtained by screening several colonies of H. salinarium S9 on agar plates as orange-colored colonies. These colonies were further characterized using Southern hybridization with a bop gene-specific probe, as described previously (8Das Sarma S. Raj Bhandary U.L. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2201-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Two strains were found to be of the SD9 type and were characterized as Pum−, strains in which the bop gene has been found to be inactivated by the insertion of the ISH1 type of transposable element, as described previously (8Das Sarma S.

Two genes encoding bacterioopsin with and without leader sequences were synthesized using synthetic oligonucleotides and assembled as shown in Fig.1. The 5′-region contains the Shine-Dalgarno sequence for Escherichia coli expression (10Coleman M. Sonar S. Patel N. Rothschild K.J. Technologies and Applications Conference Emerging Technologies: Transitioning Challenge to Commercial Applications. 1. Suny Institute of Technology, Utica, NY1994: 326-341Google Scholar) and the bop leader sequence, as reported previously (11Xu Z. Moffett D.B. Peters T.R. Smith L.D. Perry B.P. Whitmer J. Stokke S.A. Teintze M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24858-24863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The remaining bop sequence was adapted as described by Dunnet al. (12Dunn R.J. Hackett N.R. McCoy J.M. Chao B.H. Kimura K. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9246-9254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the minor modification of replacing the 3′-terminal Eco RI site with Hin dIII. Both genes were cloned into pGEM3(z) vector (Promega, Madison, WI) atEco RI-Hin dIII sites. Both plasmids pGEM-SBOP-L+ and pGEM-SBOP-L− were linearized at Hin dIII sites, and the corresponding bop mRNAs were obtained using in vitro T7-based transcription (13Sonar S. Patel N. Fischer W. Rothschild K.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13777-13781Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Lipofectin-complexed bop mRNA (Lipofectin:mRNA ratio, 2.5:1) was prepared as described previously (14Malone R.W. Felgner P.L. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6077-6081Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) and mixed with a suspension of spheroplast cells (3:5 (v/v); see below). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. Bacterioopsin samples with and without the leader peptide sequence were isolated and purified after isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducedE. coli expression as described previously (13Sonar S. Patel N. Fischer W. Rothschild K.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13777-13781Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 15Braiman M.S. Stern L.J. Chao B.H. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9271-9276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).E. coli -expressed bOp was refolded using halobacterial lipids and all-trans -retinal (13Sonar S. Patel N. Fischer W. Rothschild K.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13777-13781Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) to obtain bR. bOp- and bR-containing liposomes were prepared using sonication (16Driessen A.J. Konings W.N. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 221: 394-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 17van Dijck P.W.M. van Dam K. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 88: 17Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). A chloroform/methanol solution containing 2 mg of egg phosphatidylcholine and 18 mg of acetone-ether-washed halobacterial lipids (18Popot J.L. Gerchman S.E. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 655-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) was dried under N2 gas, lyophilized, and dispersed into 0.5 ml of 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, and 100 mm KCl. The lipid suspension was then diluted with an equal volume of distilled water containing 76.8 nmol of bR or bOp and sonicated (cycles of 15-s sonication and 45-s rest) at 4 °C for 20 min under N2gas. The proton pumping activity of bR proteoliposomes was measured as described previously (19Sonar S. Marti T. Rath P. Fischer W. Coleman M. Nilsson A. Khorana H.G. Rothschild K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28851-28858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both bOp (after regeneration by the addition of all-trans -retinal) and bR were incorporated predominantly in an inside-out direction because light-induced alkalinization of bulk medium was observed (data not shown). Cell growth and spheroplast preparation were carried out essentially as described by Seehra and Khorana (20Seehra J.S. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4187-4193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both Pum+ and Pum−strains were grown in a medium (250 g of NaCl, 20 g of MgSO4·7H2O, 3 g of trisodium citrate·2H2O, 2 g of KCl, 3 g of Bacto yeast extract, and 5 g of Bacto tryptone per liter) at 37 °C (doubling time, 14–18 h). For anaerobic growth, cells were grown strictly in the presence of nitrogen and 0.5% arginine as described previously (21Hartmann R. Sickinger H.D. Oesterhelt D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3821-3825Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested in the mid-log phase (turbidity, ∼0.7–1.0 unit at 578 nm) by centrifugation (7,000 × g ) at 30 °C and washed with the basal salt solution that contained 250 g of NaCl, 20 g of MgSO4·7H2O, and 2 g of KCl per liter. Washed cells grown in a 250-ml culture were suspended in 10 ml of 4m NaCl containing 25 mm KCl and 5 g/liter ofl-alanine (pH 7.5). A total of 2.5 ml of 0.5 mEDTA (pH 7.5) were then added, and the suspension was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. At this time, spheroplast conversion was complete. Proteoliposomes containing bOp or bR were fused with spheroplasts by combining bOp/bR proteoliposome solution (2.5 ml of proteoliposomes prepared as described above) and spheroplast suspension (7.5 ml of suspension containing spheroplasts prepared from H. salinarium cells grown in 250-ml cultures). For the FRET fusion assay, N -NBD-PE and N -Rh-PE (0.08 meach) (when necessary) were incorporated into the bilayers of proteoliposomes (22Struck D.K. Hoekstra D. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were carried out at room temperature in a fusion buffer containing basal salt solution adjusted to pH 7.4. Two min after adding 25 μl of the proteoliposome solution, 75 μl of the spheroplast solution were added. The final volume in the cuvette was 2 ml. Fluorescence measurements (excitation at 465 nm; emission at 530 nm) were carried out as functions of time over 1 h. To calibrate the fluorescence scale, the initial fluorescence of the liposomes was taken as the zero level, and the fluorescence at the maximum probe dilution (determined by the addition of 0.5% Triton X-100) was taken as 100% (22Struck D.K. Hoekstra D. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). FRET fusion assays were performed to determine the fusion efficiency of following proteoliposome with Pum− spheroplasts for three systems: (a ) N -NBD-PE + bR, (b )N -NBD-PE + N -Rh-PE, and (c )N -NBD-PE + bOp + N -Rh-PE. After liposome fusions and the appropriate incubations, spheroplast solutions were washed with basal salts containing 0.1 m MgCl2, and the cells were suspended in growth medium containing peptone (the volume was the same as that used during the original growth). The cells were grown for 12 h, harvested by centrifugation (20,000 ×g for 30 min), and washed with 4 m NaCl. For anaerobic growth, cells were grown on 0.5% arginine and in the presence of nitrogen as described previously (21Hartmann R. Sickinger H.D. Oesterhelt D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3821-3825Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The pelleted cells were lysed by suspension in distilled water, and the membranous fraction was collected by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min and washed three times with distilled water (20 ml). Samples were removed and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After the final wash, the pellet was layered on a 15–65% (w/v) sucrose density gradient (25 ml) and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 16 h (23Oesterhelt D. Stoeckenius W. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). The purple band of bR was isolated and washed four times with distilled water (25 ml) to remove sucrose. Bacteriorhodopsin obtained in this manner was characterized using UV-visible spectroscopy and SDS-PAGE. For electrophoresis, equal amounts of cells were lysed with water, and aliquots were separated by electrophoresis using 15% SDS-PAGE. Isoprenoids were isolated from H. salinarium cells as described previously (24Sumper M. Herrmann G. FEBS Lett. 1976; 71: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Spheroplasts grown in a 100-ml volume were lysed in 1 ml of water and treated with DNase. Under vigorous stirring, the lysate was added into 9 ml of acetone. After 20 min in the dark, 4 ml ofn -hexane and 1 ml of water were added. The upper phase containing the pigments was evaporated under a vacuum, and the pigments were diluted in 100 μl of toluene. The sample was applied to an Alumina column (16 g; activity grade II). The elution of β-carotene was carried out by adding 60 ml of 20% diethyl ether inn -hexane, and the elution of retinal was carried out by a further addition of 140 ml of the same solvent mixture. The elution of lycopene was carried out with 40 ml of diethyl ether. The amount of each compound obtained was calculated spectrophotometrically (25Kushwaha S.C. Kates M. Weber H.J. Can. J. Microbiol. 1980; 26: 1011-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The values are expressed on a protein basis (26Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as micrograms/gram of cellular proteins. A threefold experimental strategy has been used in this study: (a ) to see whether the presence of bOp acts as a trigger for retinal biosynthesis, bop mRNA was introduced using lipofection and subsequently translated into a Pum− strain; (b ) to see whether exogenously added bOp triggers retinal biosynthesis, the apoprotein bOp was introduced into spheroplasts via liposome fusion; and (c ) to distinguish between apoprotein- and chromoprotein (retinal-containing protein)-mediated control, bR was introduced into spheroplasts via proteoliposome fusion. Cells were lysed to assay the presence of bR and to determine the change in isoprenoid composition (the amount of lycopene, β-carotene, and retinal). Lycopene is known to be a precursor of retinal (27Danon A. Brith-Lindner M. Caplan S.R. Biophys. Struct. Mech. 1977; 21: 1-17Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and its presence has been used to track retinal biosynthesis in halobacteria (7Sumper M. Reitmeier H. Oesterhelt D. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1976; 15: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Spheroplasts were prepared according to methods described previously (20Seehra J.S. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4187-4193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Cline S.W. Doolittle W.F. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1341-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The viability of spheroplasts was determined by titering them on spheroplast regeneration plates as described previously (29Jarrell K.F. Sprott G.D. Curr. Microbiol. 1984; 10: 147-152Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 30Mescher M.F. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2687-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and it was found that spheroplasts were viable. Fig. 2 A shows SDS-PAGE analysis of partially purified membranes from spheroplasts. The samples subjected to SDS-PAGE were aliquoted before the sucrose density gradient step (23Oesterhelt D. Stoeckenius W. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 A (lane 2 ) shows the clear absence of bOp in spheroplasts of Pum− origin. The absorption spectrum of a sample subjected to SDS-PAGE also shows a lack of the characteristic absorption peak corresponding to bR at 560 nm (Fig. 2 A, inset ), suggesting that spheroplasts of the Pum− strain do not produce bR or bOp. Fig. 2 A shows that when Lipofectin-mediated introduction of bop mRNA was carried out in Pum− spheroplasts, bacteriorhodopsin is produced in the correctly folded form, as seen from SDS-PAGE (lane 4 ) and the characteristic 560 nm absorption peak (13Sonar S. Patel N. Fischer W. Rothschild K.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13777-13781Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 31Sonar S. Krebs M.P. Khorana H.G. Rothschild K.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2263-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (Fig.2 A, inset ). Sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation shows that bOp expression leads to its assembly as a purple membrane lattice. This indicates that exogenously addedbop mRNA is translated efficiently in spheroplasts of Pum− cells. In a control experiment in which only Lipofectin lacking mRNA was used, no bOp production was observed (Fig. 2 A, lane 3 ), thus indicating that the transfection protocol did not induce a latent/preexisting bop gene. Another control experiment in which bop mRNA was lipofected into Pum− cells and grown in the presence of N2 gas (see below) showed that bR formation does not take place. This is due to the inhibition of the oxidation of β-carotene to retinal. The newly isolated bR showed characteristic light-dark adaptation and proton pumping activity (data not shown). These results indicate that bOp translated from bop mRNA is integrated into the membranes of halobacterial cells and binds to intrinsic retinal to form a functional bacteriorhodopsin. It has been shown that spheroplasts are incapable of processing immature bR, and only when they are returned to normal cells can they process bR to cleave off the leader sequence (20Seehra J.S. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4187-4193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 B shows the presence of unprocessed bR in spheroplasts of Pum− cells that were lipofected with bop mRNA containing the leader sequence and where the spheroplasts had yet to revert to normal cells (lane 3 ). Lane 4 shows the presence of both unprocessed bR and processed bR in spheroplasts that were allowed to convert to normal cells. When mRNA lacking the leader sequence was used in lipofection, no detectable bOp expression was found (lane 2 ). This observation is in agreement with previously reported works (11Xu Z. Moffett D.B. Peters T.R. Smith L.D. Perry B.P. Whitmer J. Stokke S.A. Teintze M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24858-24863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 32Betlach M. Friedman J. Boyer H.W. Pfeifer F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7949-7959Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) in which it has been indicated that the leader sequence of bop mRNA is essential for binding to the ribosomal binding site in halobacteria. The hairpin structure formed by bop mRNA may also add to the intracellular stability of the exogenously introduced mRNA (11Xu Z. Moffett D.B. Peters T.R. Smith L.D. Perry B.P. Whitmer J. Stokke S.A. Teintze M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24858-24863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 32Betlach M. Friedman J. Boyer H.W. Pfeifer F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7949-7959Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The fusion of proteoliposomes containing bOp and bR was done with spheroplasts of the Pum− strain ofH. salinarium . The isolation and purification of protein show that the exogenously introduced apoprotein bacterioopsin forms the chromoprotein bacteriorhodopsin and is incorporated into the membranes of H. salinarium (Fig. 2 A, lane 5 ). After reconstitution, the isolated chromoprotein exhibited normal proton pumping activity, indicating that the protein is functional (data not shown). The liposome fusion process was monitored using FRET. Fluorescent donor-labeled lipids and acceptor-labeled lipids (N -NBD-PE and N -Rh-PE; see “Experimental Procedures”) were incorporated into liposomes and fused with spheroplasts. In the case of proteoliposomes containing bR, the fluorescence of N- NBD-PE is quenched by bR due to its strong absorption at 560 nm. FRET analysis was performed, and the results indicated that over a period of 1 h, the fluorescence intensity increased as the donor- and acceptor-labeled lipid/bR molecules move away from each other within the membrane as a result of fusion. As a result, a decrease in the quenching of fluorescence occurs as the distance between the label and the protein increases as a function of time (Fig.3). These results show that liposome fusion has taken place with the spheroplast membranes of H. salinarium . Fusion efficiency is estimated (33Arvinte T. Hildenbrand K. Wahl P. Nicolau C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 962-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and is found to be in the range of 50–60%. In control experiments, neither spheroplasts nor liposomes alone showed any appreciable fluorescence change over a 1-h period. Spheroplasts alone do not show any detectable emission at 530 nm (λex, 465 nm). Pum− spheroplasts that were fused with bop mRNA, apoprotein bOp, or chromoprotein bR were lysed to determine the key isoprenoid pigments found in the retinal biosynthetic pathway (TableI). The analysis of Pum+cells shows a characteristic absence of lycopene, indicating its efficient conversion to β-carotene, which, in the presence of oxygen, is spontaneously converted into all-trans -retinal (Table I, column 1). In contrast, isoprenoid analysis of Pum− cells indicates the accumulation of lycopene and the absence of β-carotene and retinal (Table I, column 2). When Pum− cells are lipofected with bop mRNA, pigment analysis indicates that lycopene is consumed to form β-carotene and all-trans -retinal in agreement with bR formation (Table III, column 3). The introduction of the bOp protein via proteoliposomes in Pum− cells also results in an increase in the concentration of β-carotene (Table I, column 4).Table IAnalysis of terminal isoprenoids in the retinal biosynthetic pathwayPum+ spheroplasts 1Pum−spheroplasts 2Pum− spheroplasts lipofected withbop mRNA 3Pum− spheroplasts fused with proteoliposomes containing bOp 4Pum− spheroplasts fused with proteoliposomes containing bR 5Pum−spheroplasts lipofected with bop mRNA, grown under anaerobic conditions 6Pum− spheroplasts containing excess retinal, lipofected with bop mRNA, and grown under anaerobic conditions 7Pum− spheroplasts containing excess retinal, grown under anaerobic conditions 8Pum− spheroplasts containing excess retinal, fused with proteoliposomes containing bR grown under anaerobic conditions 9LycopeneTrace1700 ± 30TraceTrace16001700 ± 301500 ± 301800 ± 1001380 ± 180β-Carotene560 ± 300480 ± 40450 ± 34Trace1430 ± 301480 ± 10TraceTraceRetinal44 ± 3 (54)1-aValues of retinal content expected from the isolated bacteriorhodopsin content.040 ± 8 (60)1-aValues of retinal content expected from the isolated bacteriorhodopsin content.24 ± 5 (27)1-bValue of retinal expected from the averaged 50% fusion efficiency of bOp- or bR-containing proteoliposome fusion.25 ± 5 (27)1-bValue of retinal expected from the averaged 50% fusion efficiency of bOp- or bR-containing proteoliposome fusion.Trace1148 ± 120 (60)1-aValues of retinal content expected from the isolated bacteriorhodopsin content.1250 ± 1801480 ± 210bR formationYesNoYesYesYesNoYesNoYesEstimated according to Materials and Methods, expressed as μg of pigment/g of cellular protein.

Isopentenyl-PP →→→ Lycopene → β-carotene → all-trans -retinal When spheroplasts of Pum− cells were fused with liposomes containing bR, the protein was found to be incorporated into the membranes of the regenerated cells. Pigment analysis of these cells (Table I, column 5) showed lycopene accumulation and hence the inhibition of the conversion of lycopene to β-carotene by bR. The exogenously introduced bR was isolated and found to be functionally unaltered when checked for proton pumping (data not shown). It has been established that the conversion of β-carotene to retinal is a spontaneous and oxygen-dependent process and is inhibited under anaerobic conditions (7Sumper M. Reitmeier H. Oesterhelt D. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1976; 15: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Under anaerobic conditions, β-carotene should accumulate, and retinal should be absent. When spheroplasts of Pum− cells were lipofected with bop mRNA and grown under anaerobic conditions, although bOp-induced lycopene-to-β-carotene conversion is seen (Table I, column 6), β-carotene-to-retinal conversion remains inhibited. When excess retinal is introduced in Pum− cells lipofected withbop mRNA under anaerobic conditions, excess retinal does not seem to inhibit lycopene-to-β-carotene conversion (Table I, column 7), as evidenced by the increased β-carotene content in contrast to the data shown in Table I, column 8. It should be noted that if bR is introduced under similar anaerobic conditions in the presence of excess retinal, no β-carotene is formed (Table I, column 9), indicating that it is bR and not the excess retinal that is inhibiting the lycopene-to-β-carotene conversion. Purple membrane, a differentiated domain of the plasma membrane, contains only one protein species, bacterioopsin, which is complexed with retinal in a 1:1 stoichiometry. The biogenesis of purple membrane is inducible by limiting the oxygen supply (34Oesterhelt D. Stoeckenius W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2853-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar) which turns on the synthesis of both bacterioopsin and retinal (35Sumper M. Herrmann G. FEBS Lett. 1976; 69: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In contrast, most of the lipid molecules necessary for purple membrane formation are synthesized long before the start of bacterioopsin and retinal synthesis, i.e. lipids are taken from the pool of the cell membrane (24Sumper M. Herrmann G. FEBS Lett. 1976; 71: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 35Sumper M. Herrmann G. FEBS Lett. 1976; 69: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Most of the retinal present in halobacteria is associated with bacterioopsin; hence, one observes a nearly stoichiometric relationship between bacterioopsin and retinal content. This fact suggests the existence of a highly efficient regulation mechanism coordinating the bacterioopsin and retinal synthetic pathways. In a classic piece of work by Sumper and Herrmann (24Sumper M. Herrmann G. FEBS Lett. 1976; 71: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), it has been found that whereas bOp may be the trigger for retinal biosynthesis from its precursors, it is unclear which of the two (excess retinal or bacteriorhodopsin in the membrane) generates the feedback signal to stop retinal biosynthesis. From the existing data, the following questions emerge on events that trigger retinal biosynthesis (Fig.4): (a ) Which of the two steps (lycopene-to-β-carotene conversion or β-carotene-to-retinal conversion) is triggered by bacterioopsin? (b ) Which of the two events (bop transcription orbop translation) acts as a trigger of retinal biosynthesis? (c ) If, instead of possibility b , protein product bOp is the trigger, which form of the protein (unfolded nascent polypeptide or folded polypeptide) acts as a trigger of retinal biosynthesis? The results of the present study aimed at understanding the factors triggering retinal biosynthesis show that both endogenously expressed bOp and exogenously introduced bOp are converted into the retinal-bound form, bacteriorhodopsin. A concomitant decrease in the lycopene content and the formation of retinal suggests that the presence of the apoprotein bOp has triggered the conversion of lycopene to β-carotene and hence the formation of retinal. Furthermore, our results show that this trigger operates at the lycopene-to-β-carotene conversion and not at the β-carotene-to-retinal conversion. It should be noted that nicotine binding and oxygen dependence studies show that the β-carotene-to-retinal conversion is spontaneous (7Sumper M. Reitmeier H. Oesterhelt D. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1976; 15: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 35Sumper M. Herrmann G. FEBS Lett. 1976; 69: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The fact that bop mRNA as well as bOp triggers the lycopene-to-β-carotene conversion indicates that the trigger does not lie within the events associated with transcription or translation of the bop gene. The next question is which form of bOp (the totally unfolded form or the partially folded form) triggers retinal biosynthesis. In the present study, bOp has been introduced as the partially folded or membrane-integrated form. Due to the extreme hydrophobicity of bOp (16Driessen A.J. Konings W.N. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 221: 394-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and the membrane-associated nature of proteoliposomes, we rule out the possibility of direct introduction of bOp in the cytoplasm of Pum− spheroplasts. Furthermore, the study of Driessen et al. (16Driessen A.J. Konings W.N. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 221: 394-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and our regeneration experiments on proteoliposomes suggest that bOp was introduced only in the correctly folded form. Thus, we conclude that bOp-mediated retinal formation is not associated with the unfolded nascent polypeptide present in the cytoplasm. Instead, the trigger is clearly associated with the folded and the membrane-integrated form of bOp. Similarly, the following questions emerge regarding the trigger that inhibits or stops retinal biosynthesis: (a ) Which of the two (excess retinal or bR) acts as a trigger for inhibition? (b ) At what stage does the feedback signal operate,e.g. at the lycopene-to-β-carotene conversion or at the β-carotene-to-retinal conversion? These questions are addressed by the in vivo introduction of both bR and excess retinal. When bR is introduced into Pum− spheroplasts, lycopene accumulation occurs, suggesting that the presence of bR triggers the inhibition of retinal biosynthesis. In contrast, when excess retinal is introduced, no lycopene accumulation/inhibition occurs, indicating that the trigger signaling inhibition does not lie within the presence of excess retinal. Also, when the Pum− strain containing excess retinal was allowed to grow anaerobically in the presence of bOp, it did not inhibit bOp-induced lycopene-to-β-carotene conversion. Thus, we conclude that it is the presence of bR that inhibits and then regulates the lycopene-to-β-carotene conversion and imparts stringency to retinal biosynthesis. At present, neither the mechanism for how this triggering occurs nor the mechanism for how retinal biosynthesis is initiated is clear. It is not clear whether the trigger lies within trimeric unit formation. It is also unclear what role, if any, halorhodopsin and/or sensory rhodopsin play in retinal biosynthesis. This is the first report on the in vivo liposome-mediated introduction of macromolecules for the determination of factors regulating the biosynthesis of cofactors and their binding to proteins. The approach is simple and novel and involves the in vivo introduction of mRNA and membrane apoprotein into spheroplasts lacking the protein as well as the cofactor. Such a study could provide information about the regulation of the pathway involved in the synthesis of its cofactor. We are grateful to Prof. A. K. Singh for the gift of all-trans -retinal."
