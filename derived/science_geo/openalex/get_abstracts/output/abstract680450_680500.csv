https://openalex.org/W3198511950,"Breast cancers are complex cellular ecosystems where heterotypic interactions play central roles in disease progression and response to therapy. However, our knowledge of their cellular composition and organization is limited. Here we present a single-cell and spatially resolved transcriptomics analysis of human breast cancers. We developed a single-cell method of intrinsic subtype classification (SCSubtype) to reveal recurrent neoplastic cell heterogeneity. Immunophenotyping using cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) provides high-resolution immune profiles, including new PD-L1/PD-L2+ macrophage populations associated with clinical outcome. Mesenchymal cells displayed diverse functions and cell-surface protein expression through differentiation within three major lineages. Stromal-immune niches were spatially organized in tumors, offering insights into antitumor immune regulation. Using single-cell signatures, we deconvoluted large breast cancer cohorts to stratify them into nine clusters, termed ‘ecotypes’, with unique cellular compositions and clinical outcomes. This study provides a comprehensive transcriptional atlas of the cellular architecture of breast cancer. A multi-omic atlas of breast cancers, integrating single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics and immunophenotyping, identifies nine ecotypes associated with cellular heterogeneity and prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W3197290161,"Late-onset Alzheimer’s disease is a prevalent age-related polygenic disease that accounts for 50–70% of dementia cases. Currently, only a fraction of the genetic variants underlying Alzheimer’s disease have been identified. Here we show that increased sample sizes allowed identification of seven previously unidentified genetic loci contributing to Alzheimer’s disease. This study highlights microglia, immune cells and protein catabolism as relevant to late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, while identifying and prioritizing previously unidentified genes of potential interest. We anticipate that these results can be included in larger meta-analyses of Alzheimer’s disease to identify further genetic variants that contribute to Alzheimer’s pathology. A genome-wide association study performed in 1,126,563 individuals identifies seven new loci associated with Alzheimer’s disease and implicates microglia and immune cells in late-onset disease."
https://openalex.org/W3113754461,"Characterizing genetic influences on DNA methylation (DNAm) provides an opportunity to understand mechanisms underpinning gene regulation and disease. In the present study, we describe results of DNAm quantitative trait locus (mQTL) analyses on 32,851 participants, identifying genetic variants associated with DNAm at 420,509 DNAm sites in blood. We present a database of >270,000 independent mQTLs, of which 8.5% comprise long-range (trans) associations. Identified mQTL associations explain 15–17% of the additive genetic variance of DNAm. We show that the genetic architecture of DNAm levels is highly polygenic. Using shared genetic control between distal DNAm sites, we constructed networks, identifying 405 discrete genomic communities enriched for genomic annotations and complex traits. Shared genetic variants are associated with both DNAm levels and complex diseases, but only in a minority of cases do these associations reflect causal relationships from DNAm to trait or vice versa, indicating a more complex genotype–phenotype map than previously anticipated. DNA methylation quantitative trait locus (mQTL) analyses on 32,851 participants identify genetic variants associated with DNA methylation at 420,509 sites in blood, resulting in a database of >270,000 independent mQTLs."
https://openalex.org/W3196426274,"Many gene expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies have published their summary statistics, which can be used to gain insight into complex human traits by downstream analyses, such as fine mapping and co-localization. However, technical differences between these datasets are a barrier to their widespread use. Consequently, target genes for most genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals have still not been identified. In the present study, we present the eQTL Catalogue ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eqtl ), a resource of quality-controlled, uniformly re-computed gene expression and splicing QTLs from 21 studies. We find that, for matching cell types and tissues, the eQTL effect sizes are highly reproducible between studies. Although most QTLs were shared between most bulk tissues, we identified a greater diversity of cell-type-specific QTLs from purified cell types, a subset of which also manifested as new disease co-localizations. Our summary statistics are freely available to enable the systematic interpretation of human GWAS associations across many cell types and tissues."
https://openalex.org/W3194625583,"Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by overproduction of immune mediators, but the role of interferons (IFNs) of the type I (IFN-I) or type III (IFN-III) families remains debated. We scrutinized the production of IFNs along the respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients and found that high levels of IFN-III, and to a lesser extent IFN-I, characterize the upper airways of patients with high viral burden but reduced disease risk or severity. Production of specific IFN-III, but not IFN-I, members denotes patients with a mild pathology and efficiently drives the transcription of genes that protect against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In contrast, compared to subjects with other infectious or noninfectious lung pathologies, IFNs are overrepresented in the lower airways of patients with severe COVID-19 that exhibit gene pathways associated with increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation. Our data demonstrate a dynamic production of IFNs in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and show IFNs play opposing roles at distinct anatomical sites."
https://openalex.org/W3196488607,"Lung cancer in never smokers (LCINS) is a common cause of cancer mortality but its genomic landscape is poorly characterized. Here high-coverage whole-genome sequencing of 232 LCINS showed 3 subtypes defined by copy number aberrations. The dominant subtype (piano), which is rare in lung cancer in smokers, features somatic UBA1 mutations, germline AR variants and stem cell-like properties, including low mutational burden, high intratumor heterogeneity, long telomeres, frequent KRAS mutations and slow growth, as suggested by the occurrence of cancer drivers’ progenitor cells many years before tumor diagnosis. The other subtypes are characterized by specific amplifications and EGFR mutations (mezzo-forte) and whole-genome doubling (forte). No strong tobacco smoking signatures were detected, even in cases with exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke. Genes within the receptor tyrosine kinase–Ras pathway had distinct impacts on survival; five genomic alterations independently doubled mortality. These findings create avenues for personalized treatment in LCINS. Whole-genome sequencing of lung cancer in never smokers identifies different copy number subtypes and shows a lack of tobacco smoking signatures, even in cases exposed to secondhand smoke."
https://openalex.org/W3198822349,"Males and females present differences in complex traits and in the risk of a wide array of diseases. Genotype by sex (GxS) interactions are thought to account for some of these differences. However, the extent and basis of GxS are poorly understood. In the present study, we provide insights into both the scope and the mechanism of GxS across the genome of about 450,000 individuals of European ancestry and 530 complex traits in the UK Biobank. We found small yet widespread differences in genetic architecture across traits. We also found that, in some cases, sex-agnostic analyses may be missing trait-associated loci and looked into possible improvements in the prediction of high-level phenotypes. Finally, we studied the potential functional role of the differences observed through sex-biased gene expression and gene-level analyses. Our results suggest the need to consider sex-aware analyses for future studies to shed light onto possible sex-specific molecular mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3197106984,"Abstract Despite early domestication around 3000 BC, the evolutionary history of the ancient allotetraploid species Brassica juncea (L.) Czern &amp; Coss remains uncertain. Here, we report a chromosome-scale de novo assembly of a yellow-seeded B. juncea genome by integrating long-read and short-read sequencing, optical mapping and Hi-C technologies. Nuclear and organelle phylogenies of 480 accessions worldwide supported that B. juncea is most likely a single origin in West Asia, 8,000–14,000 years ago, via natural interspecific hybridization. Subsequently, new crop types evolved through spontaneous gene mutations and introgressions along three independent routes of eastward expansion. Selective sweeps, genome-wide trait associations and tissue-specific RNA-sequencing analysis shed light on the domestication history of flowering time and seed weight, and on human selection for morphological diversification in this versatile species. Our data provide a comprehensive insight into the origin and domestication and a foundation for genomics-based breeding of B. juncea ."

https://openalex.org/W3198100569,"Ultra-high field MRI at 7 T can produce much better visualization of sub-cortical structures compared to lower field, which can greatly help target verification as well as overall treatment monitoring for patients with deep brain stimulation (DBS) implants. However, use of 7 T MRI for such patients is currently contra-indicated by guidelines from the device manufacturers due to the safety issues. The aim of this study was to provide an assessment of safety and image quality of ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging at 7 T in patients with deep brain stimulation implants. We performed experiments with both lead-only and complete DBS systems implanted in anthropomorphic phantoms. RF heating was measured for 43 unique patient-derived device configurations. Magnetic force measurements were performed according to ASTM F2052 test method, and device integrity was assessed before and after experiments. Finally, we assessed electrode artifact in a cadaveric brain implanted with an isolated DBS lead. RF heating remained below 2°C, similar to a fever, with the 95% confidence interval between 0.38°C-0.52°C. Magnetic forces were well below forces imposed by gravity, and thus not a source of concern. No device malfunctioning was observed due to interference from MRI fields. Electrode artifact was most noticeable on MPRAGE and T2*GRE sequences, while it was minimized on T2-TSE images. Our work provides the safety assessment of ultra-high field MRI at 7 T in patients with DBS implants. Our results suggest that 7 T MRI may be performed safely in patients with DBS implants for specific implant models and MRI hardware."
https://openalex.org/W3198826474,"Advances in remote sensing and machine learning enable increasingly accurate, inexpensive, and timely estimation of poverty and malnutrition indicators to guide development and humanitarian agencies' programming. However, state of the art models often rely on proprietary data and/or deep or transfer learning methods whose underlying mechanics may be challenging to interpret. We demonstrate how interpretable random forest models can produce estimates of a set of (potentially correlated) malnutrition and poverty prevalence measures using free, open access, regularly updated, georeferenced data. We demonstrate two use cases: contemporaneous prediction, which might be used for poverty mapping, geographic targeting, or monitoring and evaluation tasks, and a sequential nowcasting task that can inform early warning systems. Applied to data from 11 low and lower-middle income countries, we find predictive accuracy broadly comparable for both tasks to prior studies that use proprietary data and/or deep or transfer learning methods."
https://openalex.org/W3198019398,"Nanoscience paves the way for producing highly potent fertilizers and pesticides to meet farmer’s expectations. This study investigated the physiological and molecular responses of soybean seedlings to the long-time application of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) and their bulk type (BZnO) at 5 mg L -1 under the two application methods (I- foliar application; II- soil method). The ZnO NPs/BZnO treatments in a substance type- and method-dependent manner improved plant growth performance and yield. ZnO NPs transactionally upregulated the EREB gene. However, the expression of the bHLH gene displayed a contrary downward trend in response to the supplements. ZnO NPs moderately stimulated the transcription of R2R3MYB . The HSF -34 gene was also exhibited a similar upward trend in response to the nano-supplements. Moreover, the ZnONP treatments mediated significant upregulation in the WRKY1 transcription factor. Furthermore, the MAPK1 gene displayed a similar upregulation trend in response to the supplements. The foliar application of ZnONP slightly upregulated transcription of the HDA3 gene, while this gene showed a contrary slight downregulation trend in response to the supplementation of nutrient solution. The upregulation in the CAT gene also resulted from the nano-supplements. The concentrations of photosynthetic pigments exhibited an increasing trend in the ZnONP-treated seedlings. The applied treatments contributed to the upregulation in the activity of nitrate reductase and the increase in the proline concentrations. ZnO NPs induced the activity of antioxidant enzymes, including peroxidase and catalase by averages of 48.3% and 41%, respectively. The utilization of ZnO NPs mediated stimulation in the activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and increase in soluble phenols. The findings further underline this view that the long-time application of ZnO NPs at low concentrations is a safe low-risk approach to meet agricultural requirements."
https://openalex.org/W3196577363,"Sleep disorders are increasingly being characterized in modern society as contributing to a host of serious medical problems, including obesity and metabolic syndrome. Changes to the microbial community in the human gut have been reportedly associated with many of these cardiometabolic outcomes. In this study, we investigated the impact of sleep length on the gut microbiota in a large cohort of 655 participants of African descent, aged 25-45, from Ghana, South Africa (SA), Jamaica, and the United States (US). The sleep duration was self-reported via a questionnaire. Participants were classified into 3 sleep groups: short (<7hrs), normal (7-<9hrs), and long (≥9hrs). Forty-seven percent of US participants were classified as short sleepers and 88% of SA participants as long sleepers. Gut microbial composition analysis (16S rRNA gene sequencing) revealed that bacterial alpha diversity negatively correlated with sleep length (p<0.05). Furthermore, sleep length significantly contributed to the inter-individual beta diversity dissimilarity in gut microbial composition (p<0.01). Participants with both short and long-sleep durations exhibited significantly higher abundances of several taxonomic features, compared to normal sleep duration participants. The predicted relative proportion of two genes involved in the butyrate synthesis via lysine pathway were enriched in short sleep duration participants. Finally, co-occurrence relationships revealed by network analysis showed unique interactions among the short, normal and long duration sleepers. These results suggest that sleep length in humans may alter gut microbiota by driving population shifts of the whole microbiota and also specific changes in Exact Sequence Variants abundance, which may have implications for chronic inflammation associated diseases. The current findings suggest a possible relationship between disrupted sleep patterns and the composition of the gut microbiota. Prospective investigations in larger and more prolonged sleep researches and causally experimental studies are needed to confirm these findings, investigate the underlying mechanism and determine whether improving microbial homeostasis may buffer against sleep-related health decline in humans."
https://openalex.org/W3198885266,"Background According to WHO, the deaths due to NCDs in Nepal have soared from 60% of all deaths in 2014 to 66% in 2018. The study assessed the prevalence and determinants of non-communicable disease risk factors among adult population of Kathmandu. Materials and methods A community based cross-sectional study was conducted from September 2019 to February 2020 among 18–69 years adults residing in municipalities of Kathmandu district. Multi-stage random sampling technique was used to select 245 subjects who were interviewed using WHO NCD STEPS instrument. Chi-square test and logistic regression analysis were done to explore the determinants of NCD risk factors. Results The prevalence of current smoking, alcohol consumption, low intake of fruits and vegetables and low physical activity was found to be 22%, 31%, 93.9% and 10.2% respectively. More than half (52.2%) of the participants were overweight or obese and the prevalence of raised blood pressure was 27.8%. Smoking was associated significantly with male gender (AOR = 2.37, CI: 1.20–5.13) and respondents with no formal schooling (AOR: 4.33, CI: 1.50–12.48). Similarly, the odds of alcohol consumption were higher among male gender (AOR: 2.78, CI: 1.47–5.26), people who were employed (AOR: 2.30, CI: 1.13–4.82), and those who belonged to Chhetri (AOR: 2.83, CI: 1.19–6.72), Janajati (AOR: 6.18, CI: 2.74–13.90), Dalit and Madhesi, (AOR: 7.51, CI: 2.13–26.35) ethnic groups. Furthermore, respondents who were aged 30–44 years (AOR: 5.15, CI: 1.91–13.85) and 45–59 years (AOR: 4.54 CI: 1.63–12.66), who were in marital union (AOR: 3.39, CI: 1.25–9.13), and who belonged to Janajati (AOR: 3.37, CI: 1.61–7.04), Dalit and Madhesi (AOR: 4.62, CI: 1.26–16.86) ethnic groups were more likely to be associated with overweight or obesity. Additionally, the odds of raised blood pressure were higher among people who were of older age (AOR: 6.91, CI: 1.67–28.63) and those who belonged to Janajati ethnic group (AOR: 3.60, CI: 1.46–8.87) after multivariate analysis. Conclusion The findings of the study highlighted high prevalence of behavioral and metabolic risk factors, which varied on different socio-demographic grounds. Thus, population specific health promotion interventions centered on public health interests is recommended to reduce risk factors of NCDs."
https://openalex.org/W3197125765,"Public health and social interventions are critical to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Ethiopia has implemented a variety of public health and social measures to control the pandemic. This study aimed to assess social distancing and public health preventive practices of government employees in response to COVID-19. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1,573 government employees selected from 46 public institutions located in Addis Ababa. Data were collected from 8 th to 19 th June 2020 using a paper-based self-administered questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS version 23.0. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data. Binary logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with outcome variables (perceived effectiveness of facemask wearing to prevent coronavirus infection, and COVID-19 testing). Majority of the participants reported facemask wearing (96%), avoiding close contact with people including handshaking (94.8%), consistently followed government recommendations (95.6%), frequent handwashing (94.5%), practiced physical distancing (89.5%), avoided mass gatherings and crowded places (88.1%), restricting movement and travelling (71.8%), and stayed home (35.6%). More than 80% of the participants perceived that consistently wearing a facemask is highly effective in preventing coronavirus infection. Respondents from Oromia perceived less about the effectiveness of wearing facemask in preventing coronavirus infection (adjusted OR = 0.27, 95% CI:0.17–0.45). About 19% of the respondents reported that they had ever tested for COVID-19. Respondents between 40–49 years old (adjusted OR = 0.41, 95% CI:0.22–0.76) and 50–66 years (adjusted OR = 0.43, 95% CI:0.19–0.95) were less likely tested for coronavirus than the younger age groups. Similarly, respondents from Oromia were less likely to test for coronavirus (adjusted OR = 0.26, 95% CI:0.12–0.56) than those from national level. Participants who were sure about the availability of COVID-19 testing were more likely to test for coronavirus. About 57% of the respondents perceived that the policy measures in response to the pandemic were inadequate. The findings showed higher social distancing and preventive practices among the government employees in response to COVID-19. Rules and regulations imposed by the government should be enforced and people should properly apply wearing facemasks, frequent handwashing, social and physical distancing measures as a comprehensive package of COVID-19 prevention and control strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3193953379,"A DNA-prime/human adenovirus serotype 5 (HuAd5) boost vaccine encoding Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) and Pf apical membrane antigen-1 (PfAMA1), elicited protection in 4/15 (27%) of subjects against controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) that was statistically associated with CD8+ T cell responses. Subjects with high level pre-existing immunity to HuAd5 were not protected, suggesting an adverse effect on vaccine efficacy (VE). We replaced HuAd5 with chimpanzee adenovirus 63 (ChAd63), and repeated the study, assessing both the two-antigen (CSP, AMA1 = CA) vaccine, and a novel three-antigen (CSP, AMA1, ME-TRAP = CAT) vaccine that included a third pre-erythrocytic stage antigen [malaria multiple epitopes (ME) fused to the Pf thrombospondin-related adhesive protein (TRAP)] to potentially enhance protection.This was an open label, randomized Phase 1 trial, assessing safety, tolerability, and VE against CHMI in healthy, malaria naïve adults. Forty subjects (20 each group) were to receive three monthly CA or CAT DNA priming immunizations, followed by corresponding ChAd63 boost four months later. Four weeks after the boost, immunized subjects and 12 infectivity controls underwent CHMI by mosquito bite using the Pf3D7 strain. VE was assessed by determining the differences in time to parasitemia as detected by thick blood smears up to 28-days post CHMI and utilizing the log rank test, and by calculating the risk ratio of each treatment group and subtracting from 1, with significance calculated by the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method.In both groups, systemic adverse events (AEs) were significantly higher after the ChAd63 boost than DNA immunizations. Eleven of 12 infectivity controls developed parasitemia (mean 11.7 days). In the CA group, 15 of 16 (93.8%) immunized subjects developed parasitemia (mean 12.0 days). In the CAT group, 11 of 16 (63.8%) immunized subjects developed parasitemia (mean 13.0 days), indicating significant protection by log rank test compared to infectivity controls (p = 0.0406) and the CA group (p = 0.0229). VE (1 minus the risk ratio) in the CAT group was 25% compared to -2% in the CA group. The CA and CAT vaccines induced robust humoral (ELISA antibodies against CSP, AMA1 and TRAP, and IFA responses against sporozoites and Pf3D7 blood stages), and cellular responses (IFN-γ FluoroSpot responses to CSP, AMA1 and TRAP) that were not associated with protection.This study demonstrated that the ChAd63 CAT vaccine exhibited significant protective efficacy, and confirmed protection was afforded by adding a third antigen (T) to a two-antigen (CA) formulation to achieve increased VE. Although the ChAd63-CAT vaccine was associated with increased frequencies of systemic AEs compared to the CA vaccine and, historically, compared to the HuAd5 vectored malaria vaccine encoding CSP and AMA1, they were transient and associated with increased vector dosing."
https://openalex.org/W3196596687,"The flanking regions of Guaymas Basin, a young marginal rift basin located in the Gulf of California, are covered with thick sediment layers that are hydrothermally altered due to magmatic intrusions. To explore environmental controls on microbial community structure in this complex environment, we analyzed site- and depth-related patterns of microbial community composition (bacteria, archaea, and fungi) in hydrothermally influenced sediments with different thermal conditions, geochemical regimes, and extent of microbial mats. We compared communities in hot hydrothermal sediments (75-100°C at ~40 cm depth) covered by orange-pigmented Beggiatoaceae mats in the Cathedral Hill area, temperate sediments (25-30°C at ~40 cm depth) covered by yellow sulfur precipitates and filamentous sulfur oxidizers at the Aceto Balsamico location, hot sediments (&gt;115°C at ~40 cm depth) with orange-pigmented mats surrounded by yellow and white mats at the Marker 14 location, and background, non-hydrothermal sediments (3.8°C at ~45 cm depth) overlain with ambient seawater. Whereas bacterial and archaeal communities are clearly structured by site-specific in-situ thermal gradients and geochemical conditions, fungal communities are generally structured by sediment depth. Unexpectedly, chytrid sequence biosignatures are ubiquitous in surficial sediments whereas deeper sediments contain diverse yeasts and filamentous fungi. In correlation analyses across different sites and sediment depths, fungal phylotypes correlate to each other to a much greater degree than Bacteria and Archaea do to each other or to fungi, further substantiating that site-specific in-situ thermal gradients and geochemical conditions that control bacteria and archaea do not extend to fungi."
https://openalex.org/W3196896362,"Histone arginine methylation is a key post-translational modification that mediates epigenetic events that activate or repress gene transcription. Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) are the driving force for the process of arginine methylation, and the core histone proteins have been shown to be substrates for most PRMT family members. However, previous reports of the enzymatic activities of PRMTs on histones in the context of nucleosomes seem contradictory. Moreover, what governs nucleosomal substrate recognition of different PRMT members is not understood. We sought to address this key biological question by examining how different macromolecular contexts where the core histones reside may regulate arginine methylation catalyzed by individual PRMT members (i.e., PRMT1, PRMT3, PRMT4, PRMT5, PRMT6, PRMT7, and PRMT8). Our results demonstrated that the substrate context exhibits a huge impact on the histone arginine methylation activity of PRMTs. Although all the tested PRMTs methylate multiple free histones individually, they show a preference for one particular histone substrate in the context of the histone octamer. We found that PRMT1, PRMT3, PRMT5, PRMT6, PRMT7, and PRMT8 preferentially methylate histone H4, whereas PRMT4/coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 prefers histone H3. Importantly, neither reconstituted nor cell-extracted mononucleosomes could be methylated by any PRMTs tested. Structural analysis suggested that the electrostatic interaction may play a mechanistic role in priming the substrates for methylation by PRMT enzymes. Taken together, this work expands our knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of PRMT substrate recognition and has important implications for understanding cellular dynamics and kinetics of histone arginine methylation in regulating gene transcription and other chromatin-templated processes."
https://openalex.org/W3197933887,"Populations of large wildlife have declined in many landscapes around the world, and have been replaced or displaced by livestock. The consequences of these changes on the transfer of organic matter (OM) and nutrients from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems are not well understood. We used behavioural data, excretion and egestion rates and C: N: P stoichiometry of dung and urine of zebu cattle, to develop a metabolism-based estimate of loading rates of OM (dung), C, N and P into the Mara River, Kenya. We also directly measured the deposition of OM and urine by cattle into the river during watering. Per head, zebu cattle excrete and/or egest 25.6 g dry matter (DM, 99.6 g wet mass; metabolism) - 27.7 g DM (direct input) of OM, 16.0–21.8 g C, 5.9–9.6 g N, and 0.3–0.5 g P per day into the river. To replace loading rates OM of an individual hippopotamus by cattle, around 100 individuals will be needed, but much less for different elements. In parts of the investigated sub-catchments loading rates by cattle were equivalent to or higher than that of the hippopotamus. The patterns of increased suspended materials and nutrients as a result of livestock activity fit into historical findings on nutrients concentrations, dissolved organic carbon and other variables in agricultural and livestock areas in the Mara River basin. Changing these patterns of carbon and nutrient transport and cycling are having significant effects on the structure and functioning of both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems."

https://openalex.org/W3198071284,"Introduction Community engagement (CE) is an effective public health strategy for improving health outcomes. There is limited published knowledge about effective approaches to CE in ensuring effective responses to COVID-19 throughout lockdowns, travel restrictions and social distancing. In this paper, we contribute to bridging this gap by highlighting experience of CE in Vietnam, specifically focusing on migrant workers in Vietnam. Methods A cross-sectional qualitative study design was used with qualitative data collection was carried out during August-October 2020. Two districts were purposefully selected from two large industrial zones. Data was collected using in-depth interviews (n = 36) with individuals and households, migrants and owners of dormitories, industrial zone factory representatives, community representatives and health authorities. Data was analyzed using thematic analysis approach. The study received ethics approval from the Hanoi University Institutional Review Board. Results The government’s response to COVID-19 was spearheaded by the multi -sectoral National Steering Committee for the Prevention and Control of COVID-19 , chaired by the Vice Prime Minister and comprised different members from 23 ministries . This structure was replicated throughout the province and local levels and all public and private organizations . Different activities were carried out by local communities, following four key principles of infection control: early detection, isolation, quarantine and hospitalization. We found three key determinants of engagement of migrant workers with COVID-19 prevention and control: availability of resources, appropriate capacity strengthening, transparent and continuous communication and a sense of trust in government legitimacy. Discussion and conclusion Our results support the current literature on CE in infection control which highlights the importance of context and suggests that future CE should consider five key components: multi-sectoral collaboration with a whole-of-community approach to strengthen governance structures with context-specific partnerships; mobilization of resources and decentralization of decision making to encourage self-reliance and building of local capacity; capacity building through training and supervision to local institutions; transparent and clear communication of health risks and sensitization of local communities to improve compliance and foster trust in the government measures; and understanding the urgent needs ensuring of social security and engaging all parts of the community, specifically the vulnerable groups."
https://openalex.org/W3198491269,"In several nations, caries in pre-school children remain a significant oral health issue. In an outbreak period such as the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), remote contact and education aimed at the prevention of oral diseases and the preservation of children’s oral health are more relevant than ever. Currently, the amount of published applications is far higher than the published scientific studies while the problems of usability remains vulnerable. The goal of this paper was to comprehensively document the phase of development and usability testing of a mobile application for diet and oral health, namely Gigiku Sihat , which was primarily intended to be used by parents and guardians of pre-school children. The mobile application was developed using the System Development Life Cycle principle. Apart from searching for the available oral health application on Android platform, the initial requirement gathering process consisted of situational analysis, concept generation, content development, and features and functional requirement determination. The mobile application design and implementation evolved at each phase before being finalised. Gigiku Sihat was successfully developed in the Bahasa Malaysia. Finalised Gigiku Sihat was installed on mobile devices to determine the usability using translated and validated System Usability Scale questionnaire namely Skala Kebolehgunaan Aplikasi Mudah Alih (SKAMA). The mean score usability with score of 68 and above was deemed to have good usability. This study found that Gigiku Sihat mean (SD) usability score was 77.0 (14.18). The results were promising as they showed that Gigiku Sihat had a good usability. Thus, the development of this mobile application focusing on diet and oral health served as a new source of oral health education and provided a necessary foundation in developing future improved mobile application development for parents in the prevention of early childhood caries."
https://openalex.org/W3197487369,"Introduction Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) may be a life threatening nosocomial infection encountered in intensive care units. Currently the emergence of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative pathogens has become worrisome threat worldwide. Material and methods Endotracheal aspirates samples were collected from patients who were under mechanical ventilation for &gt; 48 h. The bacterial isolates were identified by MALDI-TOF-MS and antibiotic susceptibility testing performed. All carbapenem resistant isolates were tested by Modified Hodge test (MHT), modified carbapenem inactivation method (mCIM), and EDTA-CIM (eCIM) and PCR were performed to detect blaIMP, blaVIM and blaNDM producing MBL genes. Results VAP occurred in 172/353(48.7%), 23.3% had early-onset VAP and 76.7% had late-onset VAP. Males (69.2%) were found to suffer more from VAP. Prior antibiotic therapy, CPI&gt;6, prior surgery and tracheostomy were associated with VAP. The mortality in VAP (58.1%) contrasted with non-VAP (40%). 99/169 (58.6%) Gram-negative isolates were resistant to carbapenems. Acinetobacter baumannii , Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae were common pathogens found in late onset VAP, whereas K. pneumoniae, A . baumannii and Staphylococcus aureus were common in early onset VAP. The PCR results detected blaNDM in 37/172(21.5%) and blaVIM in 30/172(17.4%); 15/172(8.7%) isolates carried both genes. Conclusion The blaNDM-1 and blaVIM genes are the main antibiotic-resistance genes that induce resistance patterns to carbapenems in VAP, highlighting CRE strains of potential public health concern and therapeutic challenge. Diagnostic laboratories in India must get on high caution for early MBL detection as it may limit the wide dispersal of MBL genes."
https://openalex.org/W3198141568,"The goal of this cross-sectional, correlational study was to evaluate (a) whether beliefs about stress as enhancing versus debilitating (i.e., stress mindsets) vary across sources of stress that differ in duration (acute vs. chronic) and controllability, and (b) how general and source-specific stress mindsets relate to health and academic performance. College students (n = 498) self-reported their general and source-specific stress mindsets, perceived distress, health, coping, and GPA. Stress mindsets varied as a function of duration and controllability, and general stress mindsets were only weakly associated with source-specific mindsets. Consistent with previous research, general stress mindsets were associated with health, but some source-specific mindsets were more predictive of health than others-viewing stress from chronic controllable sources as debilitating was most predictive of poor mental and physical health. Measures of stress were also associated with health, and this association was moderated by stress mindsets, suggesting that viewing stress as enhancing can provide a psychological ""buffer"" against the negative effects of stress. Approach coping and perceived distress were examined as potential mediators of the links between stress mindset and health. Viewing stress as enhancing was related to greater use of approach coping and lower perceived distress, which in turn was related to better health. This research suggests that stress mindset interventions may benefit students' health, and that interventions targeting mindsets for chronic controllable sources of stress may be more effective than general stress mindset interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3198700308,"Untreated and minimally treated wastewater discharged into the environment have the potential to adversely affect groundwater dependent ecosystems and nearshore marine health. Addressing this issue requires a systems approach that links land use and wastewater management decisions to potential impacts on the nearshore marine environment via changes in water quality and quantity. To that end, a framework was developed to assess decisions that have cascading effects across multiple elements of the ridge-to-reef system. In an application to Kona (Hawai‘i, USA), eight land use and wastewater management scenarios were evaluated in terms of wastewater system upgrade costs and wastewater related nutrient loads in groundwater, which eventually discharge to nearshore waters, resulting in potential impacts to marine habitat quality. Without any upgrades of cesspools or the existing wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), discharges of nutrients are expected to increase substantially with permitted development, with potential detrimental impacts to the marine environment. Results suggest that converting all of the existing cesspools to aerobic treatment units (ATU) and upgrading the existing WWTP to R-1 quality provide the highest protection to nearshore marine habitat at a cost of $569 million in present value terms. Other wastewater management options were less effective but also less costly. For example, targeted cesspool conversion (a combination of septic and ATU installation) in conjunction with the WWTP upgrade still provided a substantial reduction in nutrients and potential impacts to marine habitat quality relative to the present situation at a price point roughly $100 million less than the entirely ATU option. Of note, results were more sensitive to the inclusion of the WWTP upgrade option than they were to assumptions regarding the efficiency of the cesspool conversion technologies. The model outputs also suggest that the spatial distribution of potential impacts should be carefully considered when comparing different wastewater management scenarios. When evaluated separately, the WWTP option reduced total nutrients by more than the targeted cesspool conversion option at a fraction of the cost. However, potential improvements in marine habitat quality only occurred in the immediate vicinity of the WWTP, whereas the benefits under targeted cesspool conversion were more evenly distributed along the coast."
https://openalex.org/W3198833320,"Elevated intracellular levels of dNTPs have been shown to be a biochemical marker of cancer cells. Recently, a series of mutations in the multifunctional dNTP triphosphohydrolase (dNTPase), sterile alpha motif and histidine–aspartate domain–containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), have been reported in various cancers. Here, we investigated the structure and functions of SAMHD1 R366C/H mutants, found in colon cancer and leukemia. Unlike many other cancer-specific mutations, the SAMHD1 R366 mutations do not alter cellular protein levels of the enzyme. However, R366C/H mutant proteins exhibit a loss of dNTPase activity, and their X-ray structures demonstrate the absence of dGTP substrate in their active site, likely because of a loss of interaction with the γ-phosphate of the substrate. The R366C/H mutants failed to reduce intracellular dNTP levels and restrict HIV-1 replication, functions of SAMHD1 that are dependent on the ability of the enzyme to hydrolyze dNTPs. However, these mutants retain dNTPase-independent functions, including mediating dsDNA break repair, interacting with CtIP and cyclin A2, and suppressing innate immune responses. Finally, SAMHD1 degradation in human primary-activated/dividing CD4+ T cells further elevates cellular dNTP levels. This study suggests that the loss of SAMHD1 dNTPase activity induced by R366 mutations can mechanistically contribute to the elevated dNTP levels commonly found in cancer cells.

SAMHD1 harbors additional biological activities that are independent of the enzyme's dNTPase capability. First, SAMHD1 is involved in dsDNA break repair, which requires interaction with CtlP in order to promote DNA end resection and homologous recombination during repair (21Daddacha W. Koyen A.E. Bastien A.J. Head P.E. Dhere V.R. Nabeta G.N. Connolly E.C. Werner E. Madden M.Z. Daly M.B. Minten E.V. Whelan D.R. Schlafstein A.J. Zhang H.

Next, SAMHD1 promotes cellular DNA replication by facilitating the removal of nascent DNAs at stalled replication forks by enhancing Mre11 nuclease (22Coquel F. Silva M.J. Techer H. Zadorozhny K. Sharma S. Nieminuszczy J. Mettling C. Dardillac E. Barthe A. Schmitz A.L. Promonet A. Cribier A. Sarrazin A. Niedzwiedz W. Lopez B. et al.SAMHD1 acts at stalled replication forks to prevent interferon induction.Nature. 2018; 557: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This process appears to reduce the synthesis of cellular nucleic acid products that can induce innate immunity activation (22Coquel F. Silva M.J. Techer H. Zadorozhny K. Sharma S. Nieminuszczy J.

Lopez B. et al.SAMHD1 acts at stalled replication forks to prevent interferon induction.Nature. 2018; 557: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In addition, SAMHD1 suppresses the innate immune response by inhibiting NF-κB and interferon regulatory transcription factor 7 (IRF7) activation by reducing the phosphorylation of the NF-κB inhibitory protein, IκBα, and reducing inhibitor-κB kinase ε–mediated IRF7 phosphorylation, respectively (23Chen S. Bonifati S. Qin Z. St Gelais C. Kodigepalli K.M. Barrett B.S. Kim S.H. Antonucci J.M. Ladner K.J. Buzovetsky O. Knecht K.M. Xiong Y. Yount J.S. Guttridge D.C.

An inducible transcription factor activates expression of human immunodeficiency virus in T cells.Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar). Finally, SAMHD1 binds single-stranded nucleic acids, primarily when in the monomeric form (27Seamon K.J. Sun Z. Shlyakhtenko L.S. Lyubchenko Y.L. Stivers J.T. SAMHD1 is a single-stranded nucleic acid binding protein with no active site-associated nuclease activity.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: 6486-6499Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 28Yu C.H.

Nucleic acid binding by SAMHD1 contributes to the antiretroviral activity and is enhanced by the GpsN modification.Nat. Commun. 2021; 12: 731Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). SAMHD1 activity is regulated at multiple levels. First, the enzymatically active SAMHD1 tetramer is formed when dGTP/GTP and dNTPs bind to two allosteric sites of SAMHD1, A1 and A2, respectively (29Ji X. Wu Y. Yan J. Mehrens J. Yang H. DeLucia M. Hao C. Gronenborn A.M. Skowronski J. Ahn J. Xiong Y. Mechanism of allosteric activation of SAMHD1 by dGTP.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Chem. 2013; 288: 25001-25006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Second, the phosphorylation of SAMHD1 residue T592 at the enzyme's C-terminal tail by cyclin A2/cyclic-dependent kinase 1/cyclic-dependent kinase 2 regulates HIV-1 restriction activity (32White T.E. Brandariz-Nuñez A. Valle-Casuso J.C. Amie S. Nguyen L.A. Kim B. Tuzova M. Diaz-Griffero F.

However, phosphorylated inactive SAMHD1 becomes dephosphorylated by cellular PP2A–B55a phosphatase during mitotic exit of dividing cells (33Schott K. Fuchs N.V. Derua R. Mahboubi B. Schnellbächer E. Seifried J. Tondera C. Schmitz H. Shepard C. Brandariz-Nuñez A. Diaz-Griffero F. Reuter A. Kim B. Janssens V. König R. Dephosphorylation of the HIV-1 restriction factor SAMHD1 is mediated by PP2A-B55α holoenzymes during mitotic exit.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 2227Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Finally, SAMHD1 restricts HIV-1 replication in nondividing myeloid cells such as macrophages and microglia, whereas HIV-2 and some simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) strains effectively escape from SAMHD1 restriction by employing their accessory proteins, viral protein X (Vpx) or Vpr, to proteasomally degrade SAMHD1 and elevate dNTP levels (10Hrecka K.

Cancer cells harbor 6 to 11-fold higher intracellular dNTP levels than normal cells, and this dNTP elevation is a biochemical marker of cancer cells (36Traut T.W. Physiological concentrations of purines and pyrimidines.Mol. Cell Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar).

As shown in an immunoblot assay with the transfected 293T cells (Fig. 1C), R145Q, Y155C, P158S, I201N, L244F, and R451C displayed a marked reduction in expression level when compared with WT SAMHD1, suggesting their cellular protein instability.

Importantly, the R366C/H mutants show similar expression levels to WT SAMHD1. Mutants from this initial screen that have poor cellular expression profiles likely possess several functional impairments because of their general protein instability. However, the unaltered cellular expression of R366C and R366H allowed us to use these mutants as a tool for investigating which functions of SAMHD1 may be implicated in the enzyme's role in cancer cells. In order to further probe the overall protein stability changes induced by the R366C/H mutations, we overexpressed WT and mutant SAMHD1 proteins in Escherichia coli and purified these proteins for several biochemical and biophysical analyses. First, we employed a thermal shift assay to monitor the temperature-dependent stability of the SAMHD1 proteins. For this, each protein was incubated with activator dGTP and SYPRO Orange, and denaturation was monitored by increased relative fluorescence, as a function of temperature (Fig. 2A). Y155C, which displayed reduced cellular expression levels in 293T cells (Fig. 1C), exhibited an altered thermal shift curve and Tm. Conversely, R366C and R366H displayed only minor alterations in thermal shift curves and melting temperatures. These minor alterations are not sufficient to induce changes in cellular protein level (Fig. 1C). As mutants that showed altered cellular protein stability had alterations in the allosteric site residues, it is possible that these stability changes are due to an inability to form the more stable tetramer conformation.

The aim of the two studies presented in this paper was to investigate the impact of basic psychological needs on performance with the simultaneous presence of external incentives. Study 1 tested whether the satisfaction of competence and relatedness during task performance (while external incentives were present) can impact individual's performance. Study 2, on the other hand, investigated whether the basic psychological needs and provision of external incentives can impact an individual's performance. Moreover, in both studies the mechanisms behind the need-performance relationship was checked. Our results showed that out of the three basic needs, competence had the strongest positive impact on performance, which was partially mediated by the subjective evaluation of the levels of difficulty and intrinsic motivation. The weak relationship between relatedness and task performance was fully mediated by the level of intrinsic motivation."

They were promoted as possible cessation aids and were considered to be potentially less harmful than traditional tobacco-based cigarettes. However, there is little information on the toxicants present in e-liquids and their possible carcinogenic effects.Western blot analysis was performed to identify the protein levels of cancer progression related signal transducers. Patient-derived brain tumor cells (CSC2) were injected into mouse brains and tumor growth was then observed by performing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of the whole brain. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining and Immunofluorescence staining were performed to study the expression of pEGFR and pERK.Western blotting revealed that e-liquids increased pEGFR and pERK expression in a dose dependent manner. Animal experiments revealed that the e-liquid treated group had accelerated tumor growth and poor prognosis compared to the vehicle group. Histological staining showed activation of pEGFR and pERK in the e-liquid treated group.Our study revealed that e-liquid activates pEGFR and pERK, leading to accelerated brain tumor growth and poor prognosis."

Histopathology, second harmonic generation imaging and backscatter electron imaging were used to characterize changes in the structure, organic and mineral components of the bone after RFA. RFA treatment was shown to be effective in targeting tumor cells and promoting subsequent new bone formation without impacting the surrounding bone negatively. Mineralization profiles of metastatic models were significantly improved post-RFA treatment with respect to mineral content and homogeneity, suggesting a positive impact of RFA treatment on the quality of cancer involved bone. Evaluating the impact of RFA on bone quality is important in directing the growth of this minimally invasive therapeutic approach with respect to fracture risk assessment, patient selection, and multimodal treatment planning."

On the one hand, it is possible to split a selected volume (nodule) into three parts, which are reduced separately according to individual concepts.

Actinobacteria strains were found predominantly. Phylogenetic analysis revealed 13 Actinobacteria clusters of Streptomyces, the main genus. Three Streptomycetes, strains MW562814, MW562805, and MW562807 showed antiproliferative activities against three tumor cell lines: U251 glioma, MCF7 breast, and NCI-H460 lung (non-small cell type); and antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Escherichia coli ATCC 10536, and the multidrug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii AC-972. The antiproliferative activities (measured as total growth inhibition [TGI]) of Streptomyces sp.

Effects of a moderate dose of red wine (≈ 40.98 g of ethanol) on consciousness were examined in a naturalistic study taking place in a wine bar located in one of the most touristic areas of Lisbon, Portugal. One hundred two participants drank in one of three conditions: alone, in dyad, or in groups up to six people. Red wine increased pleasure and arousal, decreased the awareness of time, slowed the subjective passage of time, increased the attentional focus on the present moment, decreased body awareness, slowed thought speed, turned imagination more vivid, and made the environment become more fascinating. Red wine increased insightfulness and originality of thoughts, increased sensations of oneness with the environment, spiritual feelings, all-encompassing love, and profound peace. All changes in consciousness occurred regardless of volunteers drinking alone, in dyad or in group. Men and women did not report different changes in consciousness. Older age correlated with greater increases in pleasure. Younger age correlated with greater increases in fascination with the environment of the wine bar. Drinking wine in a contemporaneous Western environment designed to enhance the pleasurableness of the wine drinking experience may trigger changes in consciousness commonly associated with mystical-type states."

ALDH7A1 encodes α-aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase in lysine catabolism. We investigated the gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) metabolism and energy production pathways in human PDE- ALDH7A1 and its knock-out aldh7a1 zebrafish model. Methods We measured GABA pathway, and tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites and electron transport chain activities in patients with PDE- ALDH7A1 and in knock-out aldh7a1 zebrafish. Results We report results of three patients with PDE -ALDH7A1 : low paired complex I+II and complex II+III and individual complex IV activities in muscle biopsy in patient 1 (likely more severe phenotype); significantly elevated CSF glutamate in the GABA pathway and elevated CSF citrate, succinate, isocitrate and α-ketoglutarate in the TCA cycle in patient 3 (likely more severe phenotype); and normal CSF GABA pathway and TCA cycle metabolites on long-term pyridoxine therapy in patient 2 (likely milder phenotype). All GABA pathway metabolites (γ-hydroxybutyrate, glutamine, glutamate, total GABA, succinic semialdehyde) and TCA cycle metabolites (citrate, malate, fumarate, isocitrate, lactate) were significantly low in the homozygous knock-out aldh7a1 zebrafish compared to the wildtype zebrafish. Homozygous knock-out aldh7a1 zebrafish had decreased electron transport chain enzyme activities compared to wildtype zebrafish. Discussion We report impaired electron transport chain function, accumulation of glutamate in the central nervous system and TCA cycle dysfunction in human PDE- ALDH7A1 and abnormal GABA pathway, TCA cycle and electron transport chain in knock-out aldh7a1 zebrafish.

Based on the assumption that the experience of craving is independent of substance type, the Polish version of the PACS was modified to measure drug craving, thus creating the Penn Drug Craving Scale (PDCS). The analyses presented in the paper aim to verify the hypothesis that the PDCS has a unidimensional structure, is highly reliable and features longitudinal measurement invariance.The research was conducted in 14 inpatient and 13 outpatient randomly selected facilities that provide psychosocial therapy to people with substance use disorder (SUD) in Poland, during June 2018 -July 2019. The data used for the analyses came from 282 patients diagnosed on the basis of ICD-10 criteria (F11.2-F19.2). The paper presents analyses with the application of: [1] confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) conducted on the basis of a polychoric correlation matrix and the WLSMV estimator; [2] a reliability estimate using Cronbach's alpha and coefficient omega; [3] verification of longitudinal measurement invariance between the beginning and end of therapy; [4] evaluation of criterion validity; [5] normalisation of the raw scores.The CFA results confirmed a unidimensional PDCS structure (RMSEA = 0.047, 95% CI: 0.000-0.103; CFI = 0.999; TLI = 0.999) and a high reliability of the scale (ω = 0.93). Moreover, a strict longitudinal measurement invariance of the instrument was confirmed.Accurate assessment of craving is possible only with valid and reliable instruments. Therefore, the psychometric properties of the PDCS were verified based on the latest statistical approaches. The scale is a valid and highly reliable tool featuring longitudinal measurement invariance and can be usefully used for research and clinical purposes. Thus, the Polish version of the PACS has been modified and successfully applied to the population of people with SUD."

All rats underwent a two-week adaptation period; T and TPAH group rats then proceeded to an eight-week training period on a treadmill. At the beginning of the 11th week, S and T groups received an intraperitoneal injection of saline, and SPAH and TPAH groups received an injection of monocrotaline (60 mg/kg). Rats in the T and TPAH groups then continued with the training protocol until the 13th week. We assessed exercise capacity, echocardiography analysis, Fulton's index, cross-sectional areas of cardiomyocytes, collagen content and types, and fractal dimension (FD). Transcript abundance of myosins and extracellular matrix genes were estimated through reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). When compared to the SPAH group, the TPAH group showed increases in functional capacity and pulmonary artery acceleration time/pulmonary ejection time ratio and decreases in Fulton's index and cross-sectional areas of myocyte cells. However, preventive exercise did not induce alterations in col1a1 and myh7 gene expression.

Thought to have originated in Africa is nowadays present wherever olive groves are grown. The olive fruit fly evolved to harbor a vertically transmitted and obligate bacterial symbiont -Candidatus Erwinia dacicola- leading thus to a tight evolutionary history between olive tree, fruit fly and obligate, vertical transmitted symbiotic bacterium. Considering this linkage, the genetic diversity (at a 16S fragment) of this obligate symbiont was added in the understanding of the distribution pattern of the holobiont at nine locations throughout four countries in the Mediterranean Basin. This was complemented with mitochondrial (four mtDNA fragments) and nuclear (ten microsatellites) data of the host. We focused on the previously established Iberian cluster for the B. oleae structure and hypothesised that the Tunisian samples would fall into a differentiated cluster. From the host point of view, we were unable to confirm this hypothesis. Looking at the symbiont, however, two new 16S haplotypes were found exclusively in the populations from Tunisia. This finding is discussed in the frame of host-symbiont specificity and transmission mode. To understand olive fruit fly population diversity and dispersion, the dynamics of the symbiont also needs to be taken into consideration, as it enables the fly to, so efficiently and uniquely, exploit the olive fruit resource."

This approach is effective only when cancer has already emerged, however, it might be in a stage too advanced for effective treatment. Cancer is caused by the continuous accumulation of mutations; is it possible to measure the time-dependent information of mutation accumulation and predict the emergence of cancer? We hypothesize that the mutation history derived from the tandem repeat regions in blood-derived DNA carries information about the accumulation of the cancer driver mutations in other tissues. To validate our hypothesis, we computed the mutation histories from the tandem repeat regions in blood-derived exomic DNA of 3874 TCGA patients with different cancer types and found a statistically significant signal with specificity ranging from 66% to 93% differentiating Glioblastoma patients from other cancer patients. Our approach and findings offer a new direction for future cancer prediction and early cancer detection based on information derived from blood-derived DNA."

The aim of this study is to develop a multistate predictive model to estimate the future burden of CKD in Chile, given the high and rising RRT rates, population ageing, and prevalence of comorbidities contributing to CKD.A dynamic stock and flow model was developed to simulate CKD progression in the Chilean population aged 40 years and older, up to the year 2041, adopting the perspective of the Chilean public healthcare system. The model included six states replicating progression of CKD, which was assumed in 1-year cycles and was categorised as slow, medium or fast progression, based on the underlying conditions. We simulated two different treatment scenarios. Only direct costs of treatment were included, and a 3% per year discount rate was applied after the first year. We calibrated the model based on international evidence; the exploration of uncertainty (95% credibility intervals) was undertaken with probabilistic sensitivity analysis.By the year 2041, there is an expected increase in cases of CKD stages 3a to ESKD, ceteris paribus, from 442,265 (95% UI 441,808-442,722) in 2021 to 735,513 (734,455-736,570) individuals. Direct costs of CKD stages 3a to ESKD would rise from 322.4M GBP (321.7-323.1) in 2021 to 1,038.6M GBP (1,035.5-1,041.8) in 2041. A reduction in the progression rates of the disease by the inclusion of SGLT2 inhibitors and pre-dialysis treatment would decrease the number of individuals worsening to stages 5 and ESKD, thus reducing the total costs of CKD by 214.6M GBP in 2041 to 824.0M GBP (822.7-825.3).This model can be a useful tool for healthcare planning, with development of preventive or treatment plans to reduce and delay the progression of the disease and thus the anticipated increase in the healthcare costs of CKD."

But the government’s finance to invest in these projects is limited. By using the public–private partnership (PPP) mode to attract social capital to invest in PPP projects, it can relieve the financial pressure and improve the operation efficiency. The cooperation between government and consumer can ensure the sustainable development of the project operation. A system dynamics model of tripartite evolutionary game is developed to analyze the interaction of participant’s strategies and simulate the corresponding evolution process. We employ the scenario analysis method to investigate the impact of the key parameters in relation with PPP projects based on realistic scenario assumptions. The results reveal the effect of some policies including reverse effect, blocking effect and over-reliance effect. Specifically, the results show that high penalty can prevent social capital from providing low-quality services, the low cost of government regulation can promote social capital to provide high-quality services, compensation to consumer can increase the enthusiasm of consumer participating in supervision, appropriate difference between price and cost of high-quality service as social capital’s profit can encourage social capital to provide high-quality service.

In the current study, we aim to further investigate this claim by examining bidialectals with a voluntary language switching paradigm. Research with bilinguals performing the voluntary language switching paradigm has consistently shown two effects. First, the cost of switching languages, relative to staying in the same language, is similar across the two languages. The second effect is more uniquely connected to voluntary language switching, namely a benefit when performing in mixed language blocks relative to single language blocks, which has been connected to proactive language control. If a similar pattern could be observed with bidialectals in a voluntary language switching paradigm, then this would provide additional evidence in favor of similar control processes underlying bidialectal and bilingual language production."

The dinosaur fauna of the type locality of Cerro Fortaleza Formation is known from -and biased to- large-sized sauropod remains and a single described taxon, the titanosaur Dreadnoughtus schrani . Here, we report the taxonomic composition of a site preserving thirteen isolated teeth and several osteoderms belonging to three dinosaur clades (Abelisauridae, Titanosauria, and Nodosauridae), and at least one clade of notosuchian crocodyliforms (Peirosauridae). They come from sediments positioned at the mid-section of the Cerro Fortaleza Formation, which is Campanian-Maastrichtian in age, adding valuable information to the abundance and biodiversity of this Cretaceous ecosystem. Since non-titanosaur dinosaur bones are almost absent in the locality, the teeth presented here provide a window onto the archosaur biodiversity of the Late Cretaceous in southern Patagonia. The nodosaurid tooth and small armor ossicles represent the first record of ankylosaurs for this stratigraphic unit.

Molecular analysis divides head lice into six clades and intra-clade genetic differences have been identified. Several hypotheses have been formulated to elucidate the discrepancies of the variety of head lice among different regions of the world. It is currently concluded that head lice distribution might be associated with human migration history. This study aims to investigate genetic data of human head lice in Thailand. We believe that the analysis could help establish the correlation between local and global head lice populations.We investigated mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb) gene of the collected 214 head lice to evaluate genetic diversity from 15 provinces among 6 regions of Thailand. The head lice genes were added to the global pool for the phylogenetic tree, Bayesian tree, Skyline plot, and median joining network construction. The biodiversity, neutrality tests, and population genetic differentiation among the 6 Thailand geographic regions were analyzed by DNAsp version 6.The phylogenetic tree analysis of 214 collected head lice are of clade A and clade C accounting for roughly 65% and 35% respectively. The Bayesian tree revealed a correlation of clade diversification and ancient human dispersal timeline. In Thailand, clade A is widespread in the country. Clade C is confined to only the Central, Southern, and Northeastern regions. We identified 50 novel haplotypes. Statistical analysis showed congruent results between genetic differentiation and population migration especially with South Asia.Pediculosis remains problematic among children in the rural areas in Thailand. Cytb gene analysis of human head lice illustrated clade distribution and intra-clade diversity of different areas. Our study reported novel haplotypes of head lice in Thailand. Moreover, the statistic calculation provided a better understanding of their relationship with human, as an obligate human parasite and might help provide a better insight into the history of human population migration. Determination of the correlation between phylogenetic data and pediculicide resistance gene as well as residing bacteria are of interest for future studies."

The heterotrimeric Sec61 and Ssh1 complexes, which bind translating ribosomes, mediate cotranslational translocation of proteins targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum by the signal recognition particle (SRP) and SRP receptor targeting pathway, whereas the heptameric Sec complex has been proposed to mediate ribosome-independent post-translational translocation of proteins with less hydrophobic signal sequences that escape recognition by the SRP. However, multiple reports have proposed that the Sec complex may function cotranslationally and be involved in translocation or integration of SRP-dependent protein translocation substrates. To provide insight into these conflicting views, we induced expression of the tobacco etch virus protease to achieve rapid inactivation of the Sec complex by protease-mediated cleavage within the cytoplasmic domain of the Sec63 protein. Protein translocation assays conducted after tobacco etch virus protease induction revealed a complete block in translocation of two well-characterized substrates of the Sec complex, carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) and Gas1p, when the protease cleavage sites were located at structural domain boundaries in Sec63. However, integration of SRP-dependent membrane protein substrates was not detectably impacted. Moreover, redirecting CPY to the cotranslational pathway by increasing the hydrophobicity of the signal sequence rendered translocation of CPY insensitive to inactivation of the Sec complex. We conclude that the Sec complex is primarily responsible for the translocation of yeast secretome proteins with marginally hydrophobic signal sequences."

Yet, the way in which this diagnosis should be delivered is not formally taught within our medical curriculum. To fill this gap we set up a training course of kidney failure diagnosis delivery for nephrology trainees since 2016. This study assessed the effectiveness of this educational intervention.The primary outcome was change in the empathy score immediately after the training session and several months afterward, based on the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE). Self-reported change in clinical practice was also evaluated. As control groups, we assessed empathy levels in untrained nephrology trainees (n = 26) and senior nephrologists (n = 71). Later on (>6 months) we evaluated participants' perception of changes in their clinical practice due to the training.Six training sessions permitted to train 46 trainees. Most respondents (76%) considered the training to have a durable effect on their clinical practice. Average empathy scores were not significantly different in pre-trained trainees (average JSPE: 103.7 ± 11.4), untrained trainees (102.8 ± 16.4; P = 0.81) and senior nephrologists (107.2 ± 13.6; P = 0.15). Participants' empathy score significantly improved after the training session (112.8 ± 13.9; P = 0.003). This improvement was sustained several months afterwards (average JSPE 110.5 ± 10.8; P = 0.04).A single 4-hour training session can have long lasting impact on empathy and clinical practice of participants. Willingness to listen, empathy and kindness are thought to be innate and instinctive skills, but they can be acquired and should be taught."

https://openalex.org/W3196616635,"Pollinator insects forage in complex and unpredictable resource landscapes, often using social information from congeneric individuals to acquire knowledge about their environment. It has long been recognized that this process allows them to exploit floral resources more efficiently and thus increase individual fitness. However, by creating correlations between the behaviors of pollinators within a population, this could also indirectly influence the entire plant-pollinator community. One type of social information used by pollinators is the scent mark left on the corolla of flowers by previous visitors, which can be used as a cue to avoid recently depleted resources. We developed a spatially explicit agent-based model to examine the effects, at both individual and community levels, of pollinators using these scent marks. The model simulates a population of pollinators foraging on flowers in a continuous 2D space in which we can vary the density of pollinators. We showed that the use of scent marks as a source of information significantly increased the foraging efficiency of pollinators except when competition between pollinators was very low. At the community level, this also resulted in a marked homogenization between floral resources within the landscape: in the absence of scent marks, the coefficient of variation of the remaining nectar quantity per flower strongly increased with greater pollinator competition, but it remained low at all levels of competition when scent marks were used by the pollinators. Finally, the use of scent marks markedly decreased the number of pollinator flower visits, especially at high levels of pollinator competition, which can potentially reduce the pollination service."

https://openalex.org/W3197886198,"Three studies provided initial laboratory tests of the effectiveness of a novel form of community-based environmental messaging intended to be deployed on public digital signs. In all studies, adult participants watched a slideshow of ""Community Voices,"" a display that combines community images and quotes to celebrate and empower pro-environmental and pro-community thought and action. In addition to assessing the general efficacy of the approach, a central goal was to assess the impact of alternative messengers by comparing identical text associated with either adult or child messengers (Studies 1, 2, and 3). We also assessed the impact of alternative framing of the message itself by comparing: injunctive vs non-injunctive wording (Study 1), political vs non-political content (Study 1), and future vs. present-oriented framing (Study 2). Studies 1 and 2 were conducted on a national sample. In addition, to assess the impact of local vs. non-local messengers, Study 3 compared the response of a non-local sample to a local population in which subjects had personal connections with the people and places featured in the message content. Exposure to Community Voices messages resulted in significant increases in social norm perception, concern about environmental issues, commitment to action, and optimism, suggesting that this approach to messaging is potentially valuable for stimulating cultural change. However, messages attributed to child messengers were generally not more effective, and in some cases were less effective than the same message attributed to adults. We also found no significant difference in the impact of the alternative message frames studied."
