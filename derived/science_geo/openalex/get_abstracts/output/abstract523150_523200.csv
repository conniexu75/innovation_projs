https://openalex.org/W1965518036,"The perception of flavor is perhaps the most multisensory of our everyday experiences. The latest research by psychologists and cognitive neuroscientists increasingly reveals the complex multisensory interactions that give rise to the flavor experiences we all know and love, demonstrating how they rely on the integration of cues from all of the human senses. This Perspective explores the contributions of distinct senses to our perception of food and the growing realization that the same rules of multisensory integration that have been thoroughly explored in interactions between audition, vision, and touch may also explain the combination of the (admittedly harder to study) flavor senses. Academic advances are now spilling out into the real world, with chefs and food industry increasingly taking the latest scientific findings on board in their food design."

Understanding the determinants of the nutritional value of different foods has never been more important, with population stabilization being unlikely this century (Gerland et al., 2014Gerland P. Raftery A.E. Sevčíková H. Li N. Gu D. Spoorenberg T. Alkema L. Fosdick B.K. Chunn J. Lalic N. et al.World population stabilization unlikely this century.Science. 2014; 346: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar) and growing challenges related to sustainable agriculture. An integral part of understanding how best to deliver nutritious food to a burgeoning population is understanding how the microbial community in our gut (the microbiota) is shaped by what we eat and how that community in turn shapes our development and health. Nowhere will this kind of insight be more crucial than in raising the world’s children. Current obstacles to achieving healthy and productive lives and societies are reflected in the United Nations’ millennium development goals that include reductions in child mortality and hunger and improvements in maternal health (http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/). The scope of the problem of childhood undernutrition is described by parameters such as the International Food Policy Research Institute’s Global Hunger Index (http://www.ifpri.org/publication/2014-global-hunger-index), which is an aggregate measure of calorie intake plus the rates of children being underweight and childhood mortality within a given region or country. Much has been said about how changing patterns of food preferences brought about by economic development, globalization, and changes in food technology and food distribution systems are producing dramatic changes in how, what, and when we eat. These changes, combined with rapid population expansion and issues related to sustainable agriculture, create the need and the opportunity to drive innovation in the area of identifying new, affordable, and nutritious foods. Here, we focus on the importance of understanding the postnatal developmental biology of our gut microbial community—a highly adaptable microbial “organ” that is critically involved in the biotransformation of foods to products that can shape many aspects of human biology. In our view, studies of human gut microbial communities will markedly revise current thinking about many aspects of human nutrition. The knowledge gained could and should catalyze efforts to integrate agricultural policies, food production, and nutritional recommendations for consumers representing different ages, cultural traditions, and geographies. Preclinical research platforms are now available to evaluate the effects of foods that we currently consume and those that we envision creating in the future on the gut microbial community and host biology in ways that can inform clinical studies. Furthermore, studies of children with undernutrition are highlighting the importance of postnatal development of the gut microbiota for achieving healthy growth and providing us with a new set of metrics to define the efficacy of nutritional recommendations and interventions directed at infants, the maternal-infant dyad, and children. Finally, we emphasize the importance of addressing ethical, social, and regulatory issues related to research in this area now rather than later. The human gut microbiota is composed of all three domains of life; Bacteria, which predominate, Archaea, and Eukarya, plus viruses. The gut microbiota is composed of relatively few bacterial phyla compared to communities in other body habitats and is notable for its strain-level diversity. Application of low-error sequencing methods to PCR amplicons generated from the bacterial phylogenetic marker gene encoding the principal RNA in the small subunit of ribosomes (16S rRNA) has indicated that, once acquired, the majority of bacterial strains in a healthy adult are retained for long periods of time (Faith et al., 2013Faith J.J. Guruge J.L. Charbonneau M. Subramanian S. Seedorf H. Goodman A.L. Clemente J.C. Knight R. Heath A.C. Leibel R.L. et al.The long-term stability of the human gut microbiota.Science. 2013; 341: 1237439https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1237439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). Thus, early colonizers, once established in the gut ecosystem, have the potential to exert their effects on our biological features and health status for most and perhaps all of our adult lives. This latter finding emphasizes the importance of understanding whether there is a definable program of community assembly in healthy infants/children and whether such a program is shared or varies considerably across populations with distinct dietary habits and culinary traditions residing in different geographic locations. If such a developmental program were definable and a significant contributor to healthy growth, fostering its proper and full execution could represent the basis of an arm of preventive medicine designed to ensure long-term health through informed microbial stewardship. Food is a major factor that shapes the proportional representation of microorganisms present in the gut microbiota and the relative abundance of its genes (the microbiome). Reciprocally, the configuration of the microbiota/microbiome influences the nutritional value of food. One illustration of this interrelationship comes from a culture-independent metagenomic analysis of the gut microbiomes of infants, children, and adults belonging to 150 families living in three countries located on three different continents (metropolitan areas of the USA plus rural villages in southern Malawi and the Amazonas state of Venezuela). The results revealed that the relative abundances of genes in the microbiome that are related to vitamin biosynthesis (e.g., folate, cobalamin, thiamine, and biotin), amino acid metabolism, and processing of complex polysaccharides change in an identifiable sequence during the postnatal period (Yatsunenko et al., 2012Yatsunenko T. Rey F.E. Manary M.J. Trehan I. Dominguez-Bello M.G. Contreras M. Magris M. Hidalgo G. Baldassano R.N. Anokhin A.P. et al.Human gut microbiome viewed across age and geography.Nature. 2012; 486: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (4787) Google Scholar). In addition, differences between Westernized (USA) and non-Westernized populations were evident, with breastfed Malawian and Amerindian babies having higher relative abundances of microbial genes encoding enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, vitamin biosynthesis (e.g., components of the biosynthetic pathway for riboflavin, a component of breast milk, dairy products, and meat), and urease (Yatsunenko et al., 2012Yatsunenko T. Rey F.E. Manary M.J. Trehan I. Dominguez-Bello M.G. Contreras M. Magris M. Hidalgo G. Baldassano R.N. Anokhin A.P. et al.Human gut microbiome viewed across age and geography.Nature. 2012; 486: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (4787) Google Scholar). Urea represents up to 15% of breast milk nitrogen; its degradation to ammonia can be used for microbial biosynthesis of essential amino acids, potentially benefiting both the microbiota and host when diets are deficient in protein. Significant differences in microbiome configuration were also observed between breast-fed and formula-fed infants, with the latter showing increased representation of genes involved in various aspects of carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism and cobalamin (vitamin B12) biosynthesis (Yatsunenko et al., 2012Yatsunenko T. Rey F.E. Manary M.J. Trehan I. Dominguez-Bello M.G. Contreras M. Magris M. Hidalgo G. Baldassano R.N. Anokhin A.P. et al.Human gut microbiome viewed across age and geography.Nature. 2012; 486: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (4787) Google Scholar). Cobalamin is not only important for the host; the ability to transport cobalamin and other substituted corrins is an important determinant of survival for members of the microbiota (Degnan et al., 2014Degnan P.H. Barry N.A. Mok K.C. Taga M.E. Goodman A.L. Human gut microbes use multiple transporters to distinguish vitamin B12 analogs and compete in the gut.Cell Host Microbe. 2014; 15: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggested that the gut community should be considered when assessing the nutritional requirements at different stages of the human life cycle and in different geographic/cultural settings. They also raised the question of whether perturbations in the functional development of the microbiota/microbiome were related to childhood undernutrition, the major cause of childhood deaths worldwide and a manifestation of a complex set of still poorly understood intra- and intergenerational factors, rather than food insecurity alone (Lazzerini et al., 2013Lazzerini M.

The World Health Organization’s (WHO) Multi-Center Growth Reference Study (http://www.who.int/childgrowth/mgrs/en/) defines three anthropometric (physical) parameters (weight-for-age, height-for-age, and weight-for-height Z scores) to describe normal early childhood growth and nutritional status from its evaluation of 8,440 infants and children living in six distinct sites around the world (USA, Oman, Norway, Brazil, Ghana, and India). A recent study provided another definition of healthy growth but from a microbial perspective (Subramanian et al., 2014Subramanian S. Huq S. Yatsunenko T. Haque R. Mahfuz M. Alam M.A. Benezra A. DeStefano J. Meier M.F. Muegge B.D. et al.Persistent gut microbiota immaturity in malnourished Bangladeshi children.Nature. 2014; 510: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). It did so by examining gut microbiota assembly in 50 children residing in Dhaka, Bangladesh whose anthropometry during their first 2 years of life indicated healthy growth. Fecal samples were collected monthly from birth through the end of the second postnatal year, and the relative abundances of bacterial strains were analyzed by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. The results revealed that interpersonal variation in the bacterial component of their gut communities was significantly smaller than the variation associated with age. Applying Random Forests, a machine-learning method, to regress relative abundances of bacterial taxa across these children revealed age-discriminatory bacterial strains. Separating these 50 children into training and validation cohorts, the regression was optimized to include the most informative taxa for accurate prediction of microbiota “age.” The results were formally validated to prevent over-fitting and over-estimation of generalizability and produced a sparse model composed of 24 strains that could be used in aggregate as a microbial signature for describing a shared program of microbiota development in healthy individuals and two derived metrics for defining deviations from that normal program: “relative microbiota maturity” and “microbiota-for-age” Z (MAZ) score (Figure 1). Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is defined by weight-for-height Z (WHZ) scores more than 3 SDs below the median of children in the WHO reference cohort. Application of this sparse model to 64 Bangladeshi children with SAM (WHZ −4.2 ± 0.72 [SD]) revealed they had gut microbiota that appeared significantly “younger” than their chronological age (relative microbiota maturity of −6 ± 0.7 months and MAZ scores of −1.7 ± 0.2). Moreover, this immaturity was incompletely and only transiently rescued following a customary period of administration of either one of two types of ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTFs; typically given for 2 weeks until a 15% increase in weight gain is achieved; http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01331044). Bangladeshi children with moderate acute malnutrition (WHZ between −3 and −2) also exhibited significant microbiota immaturity, although less severe than children with SAM (Subramanian et al., 2014Subramanian S. Huq S. Yatsunenko T. Haque R. Mahfuz M. Alam M.A. Benezra A. DeStefano J. Meier M.F. Muegge B.D. et al.Persistent gut microbiota immaturity in malnourished Bangladeshi children.Nature. 2014; 510: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). These results indicate that children with SAM have a persistent developmental abnormality affecting their gut microbial “organ” that is not durably repaired with existing therapy. These observations raise a critical question: is microbiota immaturity a cause or an effect of childhood undernutrition? Many studies have shown that, although current protocols for treating children with (acute) undernutrition reduce mortality, they do not rescue its long-term morbidities, including stunting, immune dysfunction, and neurodevelopmental abnormalities (Victora et al., 2008Victora C.G.

For example, given the remarkable metabolic requirements of the neonatal brain, alterations in the normal postnatal development of the gut microbiota may trigger marked impairments in brain development and lead to persistent disorders of cognition. Support for a causal role for the gut microbiota in SAM comes from studies of gnotobiotic mice. In recent years, methods have been developed for transplanting previously frozen fecal samples from human donors into groups of germ-free mice at a selected stage of their lives (e.g., young, rapidly growing animals that have been recently weaned or older animals) and with a designated genetic background. If the human microbiota sample is frozen shortly after it is produced and maintained at −80°C, the bacterial strains represented in the donor’s community can be transmitted efficiently and reproducibly to recipient mice (e.g., Turnbaugh et al., 2009aTurnbaugh P.J.

Med. 2015; 7: 276ra24Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The recipient mice can be fed diets that contain ingredients used in foods consumed by the microbiota donor. Moreover, the ingredients and methods for preparing (cooking) such diets can be varied systematically. This approach allows myriad types of models to be constructed for studying the interaction of foods and the human gut microbiota in vivo. For example, diets can be given that are representative of those consumed by populations other than those of the donor to anticipate the effects of changes in food consumption patterns associated with Westernization or composed of ingredients that represent new potential sources of affordable, nutritious foods such as landraces and waste streams from current food manufacturing processes. Critically, these preclinical gnotobiotic animal models allow proof-of-concept tests of whether a donor phenotype is transmissible via his/her gut microbiota, the extent to which phenotypic transmission generalizes across different donor microbiota, and the sensitivity or robustness of phenotypic transmission to diet type. These preclinical models also permit simulations of existing or anticipated therapeutic interventions, including the opportunity to “randomize” a given individual's microbiota to not just one but multiple treatment arms in order to directly compare the effect (and effect size) of the treatments on both the microbiota and host, to characterize underlying mechanisms, and to identify surrogate- or mechanism-based biomarkers that could be translatable to the microbiota donor or donor population (Figure 2). Transplanting fecal microbiota from same-gender Malawian twins discordant for kwashiorkor, a form of SAM, into separate groups of adult germ-free mice and feeding the recipient animals a representative micro- and macronutrient-deficient Malawian diet disclosed that the healthy and kwashiorkor co-twins’ microbiota transmitted discordant weight loss and metabolic phenotypes (as well as an enteropathy characterized by disruption of the small intestinal and colonic epithelial barrier in animals harboring kwashiorkor but not healthy microbiota) (Smith et al., 2013Smith M.I. Yatsunenko T. Manary M.J. Trehan I. Mkakosya R. Cheng J. Kau A.L. Rich S.S. Concannon P.

Med. 2015; 7: 276ra24Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Unlike the transplanted healthy co-twins’ microbiota, the kwashiorkor microbiota was structurally and metabolically labile, reconfiguring itself upon exposure to a peanut-based RUTF, but not in a sustained way when animals were returned to the Malawian diet. The combination of a nutrient-deficient Malawian diet and a kwashiorkor microbiota was required to produce pathology in the recipient “humanized” mice, including inhibition of steps within the tricarboxylic acid cycle in host cells (Smith et al., 2013Smith M.I. Yatsunenko T. Manary M.J. Trehan I. Mkakosya R. Cheng J. Kau A.L. Rich S.S. Concannon P. Mychaleckyj J.C. et al.Gut microbiomes of Malawian twin pairs discordant for kwashiorkor.Science. 2013; 339: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). These findings not only provided evidence for a causal relationship between the gut microbiota and SAM but also highlighted the importance of diet-by-microbiota interactions in disease pathogenesis. If we consider children with persistent microbiota immaturity from the perspective of developmental biology, we can pose a number of basic and applied scientific questions. One question is whether the developmental program defined in Bangladeshi infants and children is generalizable to other populations representing different geographic and cultural settings. If so, it would reveal a fundamental shared aspect of postnatal human development and raise mechanistic questions about the factors that specify a healthy microbial community “fate.” Initial support for generalizability comes from an analysis of concordant healthy Malawian twin pairs, which showed that a number of the age-discriminatory bacterial strains with the highest feature importance scores in the Bangladeshi Random Forests model are also represented in the Malawian population (Subramanian et al., 2014Subramanian S. Huq S. Yatsunenko T. Haque R. Mahfuz M. Alam M.A. Benezra A. DeStefano J. Meier M.F. Muegge B.D. et al.Persistent gut microbiota immaturity in malnourished Bangladeshi children.Nature. 2014; 510: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, Yatsunenko et al., 2012Yatsunenko T. Rey F.E. Manary M.J. Trehan I. Dominguez-Bello M.G. Contreras M. Magris M. Hidalgo G. Baldassano R.N. Anokhin A.P. et al.Human gut microbiome viewed across age and geography.Nature. 2012; 486: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (4787) Google Scholar). The designation “same strain” was based on the same 16S rRNA sequence; whole-genome sequencing of a given age-discriminatory strain identified by its 16S rRNA sequence will be needed to determine its degree of gene conservation across different Bangladeshi and Malawian hosts. Bacterial 16S rRNA analyses of fecal samples obtained at monthly intervals from infants and children with healthy growth phenotypes enrolled in birth cohorts living at multiple low-income countries allow country/community site-specific, Random-Forests-based models of microbiota maturation to be constructed, as well as an aggregate model representing data pooled from all sites. “Generalizability” can be established through reciprocal tests of the accuracy of the site-specific models (and aggregate model) for healthy individuals living at the different sites and whether these models reveal similar relationships between anthropometry and relative microbiota maturity/MAZ scores for undernourished children living at each of these sites. A second question has to do with the relationship between microbiota development, enteropathogen load, and environmental enteric dysfunction (EED, also known as environmental enteropathy), an enigmatic and as-yet-incompletely defined disorder of gut barrier function (Keusch et al., 2014Keusch G.T. Denno D.M. Black R.E. Duggan C. Guerrant R.L. Lavery J.V. Nataro J.P. Rosenberg I.H. Ryan E.T.

Dis. 2014; 59: S239-S247Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Does a primary failure to execute normal maturation of the microbiota directly influence risk for enteropathogen invasion, perturbations in development of mucosal immune system, and abnormalities in nutrient processing and absorption that ultimately results in growth faltering? Alternatively, is a holistic view required that considers each of these features of enteric biology as intimately and integrally related to one another? Large birth cohort studies such as MAL-ED and GEMS have provided an opportunity to measure the contributions of enteropathogen load/carriage and diarrheal incidence to growth faltering (MAL-ED Network Investigators, 2014MAL-ED Network InvestigatorsThe MAL-ED study: a multinational and multidisciplinary approach to understand the relationship between enteric pathogens, malnutrition, gut physiology, physical growth, cognitive development, and immune responses in infants and children up to 2 years of age in resource-poor environments.Clin.

Evidence is emerging that some of the age-discriminatory taxa that define normal microbiota maturation also protect the host from enteropathogen infection. Intriguingly, studies of Bangladeshi adults with acute cholera have shown that recovery from the diarrheal phase involves recapitulation of the sequence of appearance of the same age-discriminatory bacterial strains that define the normal pattern of assembly of the microbiota in healthy Bangladeshi infants/children, suggesting that an essential set of rules governs this assembly (successional) process (Hsiao et al., 2014Hsiao A.

Members of the human gut microbiota involved in recovery from Vibrio cholerae infection.Nature. 2014; 515: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). For example, Ruminococcus obeum, a bacterium that directly correlates with recovery from Vibrio cholerae infection in adult Bangladeshi subjects and defines later stages of normal gut microbiota maturation in healthy Bangladeshi children, restricts V. cholerae colonization of gnotobiotic mice harboring a representative human gut microbiota. Its mechanism involves production of an autoinducer-2 (AI-2) that causes quorum-sensing mediated repression of V. cholerae colonization and virulence factor expression (Hsiao et al., 2014Hsiao A.

Severe HI resulted in progressively increased brain infarction over time as assessed by serial MRI, increased number of cells positive for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase nick-end labeling, microgliosis and astrocytosis, increased CSF cytokine levels, and impaired function in behavioral tests such as rotarod and cylinder tests. All of the abnormalities observed in severe HIE showed greater improvement after combined treatment with hypothermia and MSC transplantation than with either therapy alone.

To explore this further, we used RNA-seq data from multiple patient cohorts to analyze the distribution of FOLR1 mRNA across breast cancer subtypes comprised of estrogen receptor positive (ER+), human epidermal growth factor receptor positive (HER2+), and triple negative (TNBC) tumors. FOLR1 expression varied within breast tumor subtypes; triple negative/basal tumors were significantly associated with increased expression of FOLR1 mRNA, compared to ER+ and HER2+ tumors. However, subsets of high level FOLR1 expressing tumors were observed in all clinical subtypes. These observations were supported by immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarrays, with the largest number of 3+ positive tumors and highest H-scores of any subtype represented by triple negatives, and lowest by ER+ tumors. FOLR1 expression did not correlate to common clinicopathological parameters such as tumor stage and nodal status. To delineate the importance of FOLR1 overexpression in triple negative cancers, RNA-interference was used to deplete FOLR1 in overexpressing triple negative cell breast lines. Loss of FOLR1 resulted in growth inhibition, whereas FOLR1 overexpression promoted folate uptake and growth advantage in low folate conditions. Taken together, our data suggests patients with triple negative cancers expressing high FOLR1 expression represent an important population of patients that may benefit from targeted anti-FOLR1 therapy. This may prove particularly helpful for a large number of patients who would typically be classified as triple negative and who to this point have been left without any targeted treatment options."
https://openalex.org/W2096706590,"Background Although influenza causes significant morbidity and mortality in the elderly, the factors underlying the reduced vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy in this age group are not completely understood. Age and immunosenescence factors, and their impact on humoral immunity after influenza vaccination, are of growing interest for the development of better vaccines for the elderly. Methods We assessed associations between age and immunosenescence markers (T cell receptor rearrangement excision circles – TREC content, peripheral white blood cell telomerase – TERT expression and CD28 expression on T cells) and influenza A/H1N1 vaccine-induced measures of humoral immunity in 106 older subjects at baseline and three timepoints post-vaccination. Results TERT activity (TERT mRNA expression) was significantly positively correlated with the observed increase in the influenza-specific memory B cell ELISPOT response at Day 28 compared to baseline (p-value=0.025). TREC levels were positively correlated with the baseline and early (Day 3) influenza A/H1N1-specific memory B cell ELISPOT response (p-value=0.042 and p-value=0.035, respectively). The expression and/or expression change of CD28 on CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cells at baseline and Day 3 was positively correlated with the influenza A/H1N1-specific memory B cell ELISPOT response at baseline, Day 28 and Day 75 post-vaccination. In a multivariable analysis, the peak antibody response (HAI and/or VNA at Day 28) was negatively associated with age, the percentage of CD8+CD28low T cells, IgD+CD27- naïve B cells, and percentage overall CD20- B cells and plasmablasts, measured at Day 3 post-vaccination. The early change in influenza-specific memory B cell ELISPOT response was positively correlated with the observed increase in influenza A/H1N1-specific HAI antibodies at Day 28 and Day 75 relative to baseline (p-value=0.007 and p-value=0.005, respectively). Conclusion Our data suggest that influenza-specific humoral immunity is significantly influenced by age, and that specific markers of immunosenescence (e.g., the baseline/early expression of CD28 on CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cells and T cell immune abnormalities) are correlated with different humoral immune response outcomes observed after vaccination in older individuals, and thus can be potentially used to predict vaccine immunogenicity."
https://openalex.org/W2063146108,"Ego-resiliency (ER) is a capacity that enables individuals to adapt to constantly changing environmental demands. The goal of our research was to identify components of Ego-resiliency, and to test the reliability and the structural and convergent validity of the refined version of the ER11 Ego-resiliency scale. In Study 1 we used a factor analytical approach to assess structural validity and to identify factors of Ego-resiliency. Comparing alternative factor-structures, a hierarchical model was chosen including three factors: Active Engagement with the World (AEW), Repertoire of Problem Solving Strategies (RPSS), and Integrated Performance under Stress (IPS). In Study 2, the convergent and divergent validity of the ER11 scale and its factors and their relationship with resilience were tested. The results suggested that resiliency is a double-faced construct, with one function to keep the personality system stable and intact, and the other function to adjust the personality system in an adaptive way to the dynamically changing environment. The stability function is represented by the RPSS and IPS components of ER. Their relationship pattern is similar to other constructs of resilience, e.g. the Revised Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (R-CD-RISC). The flexibility function is represented by the unit of RPSS and AEW components. In Study 3 we tested ER11 on a Hungarian online representative sample and integrated the results in a model of general resiliency. This framework allows us to grasp both the stability-focused and the plasticity-focused nature of resiliency."
https://openalex.org/W1972048529,"Capillary leak in severe sepsis involves disruption of endothelial cell tight junctions. We modeled this process by TNF treatment of cultured human dermal microvascular endothelial cell (HDMEC) monolayers, which unlike human umbilical vein endothelial cells form claudin-5-dependent tight junctions and a high-resistance permeability barrier. Continuous monitoring with electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing revealed that TNF disrupts tight junction-dependent HDMEC barriers in discrete steps: an ~5% increase in transendothelial electrical resistance over 40 minutes; a decrease to ~10% below basal levels over 2 hours (phase 1 leak); an interphase plateau of 1 hour; and a major fall in transendothelial electrical resistance to < 70% of basal levels by 8–10 hours (phase 2 leak), with EC50 values of TNF for phase 1 and 2 leak of ~30 and ~150 pg/ml, respectively. TNF leak is reversible and independent of cell death. Leak correlates with disruption of continuous claudin-5 immunofluorescence staining, myosin light chain phosphorylation and loss of claudin-5 co-localization with cortical actin. All these responses require NF-κB signaling, shown by inhibition with Bay 11 or overexpression of IκB super-repressor, and are blocked by H-1152 or Y-27632, selective inhibitors of Rho-associated kinase that do not block other NF-κB-dependent responses. siRNA combined knockdown of Rho-associated kinase-1 and -2 also prevents myosin light chain phosphorylation, loss of claudin-5/actin co-localization, claudin-5 reorganization and reduces phase 1 leak. However, unlike H-1152 and Y-27632, combined Rho-associated kinase-1/2 siRNA knockdown does not reduce the magnitude of phase 2 leak, suggesting that H-1152 and Y-27632 have targets beyond Rho-associated kinases that regulate endothelial barrier function. We conclude that TNF disrupts TJs in HDMECs in two distinct NF-κB-dependent steps, the first involving Rho-associated kinase and the second likely to involve an as yet unidentified but structurally related protein kinase(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1989159677,"Nanoparticles have attracted a great deal of attention as carriers for drug delivery to cancer cells. However, reports on their potential cytotoxicity raise questions of their safety and this matter needs attentive consideration. In this paper, for the first time, the cytotoxic effects of two carbon based nanoparticles, diamond and graphite, on glioblastoma and hepatoma cells were compared. First, we confirmed previous results that diamond nanoparticles are practically nontoxic. Second, graphite nanoparticles exhibited a negative impact on glioblastoma, but not on hepatoma cells. The studied carbon nanoparticles could be a potentially useful tool for therapeutics delivery to the brain tissue with minimal side effects on the hepatocytes. Furthermore, we showed the influence of the nanoparticles on the stable, fluorescently labeled tumor cell lines and concluded that the labeled cells are suitable for drug cytotoxicity tests."
https://openalex.org/W1981656390,"Middle ear infection (or inflammation) is the most common pathological condition that causes fluid to accumulate in the middle ear, disrupting cochlear homeostasis. Lipopolysaccharide, a product of bacteriolysis, activates macrophages and causes release of inflammatory cytokines. Many studies have shown that lipopolysaccharides cause functional and structural changes in the inner ear similar to that of inflammation. However, it is specifically not known how lipopolysaccharides affect the blood-labyrinth barrier in the stria vascularis (intra-strial fluid-blood barrier), nor what the underlying mechanisms are. In this study, we used a cell culture-based in vitro model and animal-based in vivo model, combined with immunohistochemistry and a vascular leakage assay, to investigate lipopolysaccharide effects on the integrity of the mouse intra-strial fluid-blood barrier. Our results show lipopolysaccharide-induced local infection significantly affects intra-strial fluid-blood barrier component cells. Pericytes and perivascular-resident macrophage-like melanocytes are particularly affected, and the morphological and functional changes in these cells are accompanied by substantial changes in barrier integrity. Significant vascular leakage is found in the lipopolysaccharide treated-animals. Consistent with the findings from the in vivo animal model, the permeability of the endothelial cell monolayer to FITC-albumin was significantly higher in the lipopolysaccharide-treated monolayer than in an untreated endothelial cell monolayer. Further study has shown the lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation to have a major effect on the expression of tight junctions in the blood barrier. Lipopolysaccharide was also shown to cause high frequency hearing loss, corroborated by previous reports from other laboratories. Our findings show lipopolysaccharide-evoked middle ear infection disrupts inner ear fluid balance, and its particular effects on the intra-strial fluid-blood barrier, essential for cochlear homeostasis. The barrier is degraded as the expression of tight junction-associated proteins such as zona occludens 1, occludin, and vascular endothelial cadherin are down-regulated."
https://openalex.org/W2024664316,"The use of antisense 'splice-switching' oligonucleotides to induce exon skipping represents a potential therapeutic approach to various human genetic diseases. It has achieved greatest maturity in exon skipping of the dystrophin transcript in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), for which several clinical trials are completed or ongoing, and a large body of data exists describing tested oligonucleotides and their efficacy. The rational design of an exon skipping oligonucleotide involves the choice of an antisense sequence, usually between 15 and 32 nucleotides, targeting the exon that is to be skipped. Although parameters describing the target site can be computationally estimated and several have been identified to correlate with efficacy, methods to predict efficacy are limited. Here, an in silico pre-screening approach is proposed, based on predictive statistical modelling. Previous DMD data were compiled together and, for each oligonucleotide, some 60 descriptors were considered. Statistical modelling approaches were applied to derive algorithms that predict exon skipping for a given target site. We confirmed (1) the binding energetics of the oligonucleotide to the RNA, and (2) the distance in bases of the target site from the splice acceptor site, as the two most predictive parameters, and we included these and several other parameters (while discounting many) into an in silico screening process, based on their capacity to predict high or low efficacy in either phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (89% correctly predicted) and/or 2'O Methyl RNA oligonucleotides (76% correctly predicted). Predictions correlated strongly with in vitro testing for sixteen de novo PMO sequences targeting various positions on DMD exons 44 (R² 0.89) and 53 (R² 0.89), one of which represents a potential novel candidate for clinical trials. We provide these algorithms together with a computational tool that facilitates screening to predict exon skipping efficacy at each position of a target exon."
https://openalex.org/W1994158610,"The general population is exposed to cadmium from food and smoking. Cadmium is a widely spread toxic pollutant that seems to be associated with cardiovascular diseases, although little is known if it contributes to the occurrence of atherosclerotic plaques and the process whereby plaques become vulnerable and are prone to rupture. We tested the hypotheses that cadmium exposure is associated not only with an increased subclinical burden of atherosclerotic plaques in different vascular territories and early signs of plaque vulnerability, but also with cadmium content and plaque-rupture in the clinical phase of the disease. Ultrasound technique was used to measure plaque prevalence and echogenicity in the carotid and femoral arteries in a population sample of women (n = 599) in whom blood cadmium was measured. In addition cadmium was measured in snap-frozen endarterectomies and whole blood obtained from patients who were referred to surgery because of symptomatic carotid plaques (n = 37). Sixteen endarterectomies were divided into three parts corresponding to different flow conditions and plaque vulnerability. In the population sample blood cadmium was associated with the number of vascular territories with plaques (p = 0.003 after adjustment for potential confounders). The cadmium concentrations in symptomatic plaques were 50-fold higher in plaque tissue than in blood. Cadmium levels in blood and plaque correlated, also after adjustment for smoking and other cardiovascular risk factors (p<0.001). Compared with the other parts of the plaque, the cadmium content was double as high in the part where plaque rupture usually occurs. In conclusion, the results show that cadmium exposure is associated with the burden of subclinical atherosclerosis in middle-aged women with different degrees of glucose tolerance, and that the content of cadmium in symptomatic plaques in patients is related to that in blood, but much higher, and preferentially located in the part of plaque where rupture often occurs."
https://openalex.org/W2018904543,"Acetylcholine (ACh) plays a crucial role in physiological responses of both the central and the peripheral nervous system. Moreover, ACh was described as an anti-inflammatory mediator involved in the suppression of exacerbated innate response and cytokine release in various organs. However, the specific contributions of endogenous release ACh for inflammatory responses in the lung are not well understood. To address this question we have used mice with reduced levels of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), a protein required for ACh storage in secretory vesicles. VAChT deficiency induced airway inflammation with enhanced TNF-α and IL-4 content, but not IL-6, IL-13 and IL-10 quantified by ELISA. Mice with decreased levels of VAChT presented increased collagen and elastic fibers deposition in airway walls which was consistent with an increase in inflammatory cells positive to MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in the lung. In vivo lung function evaluation showed airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine in mutant mice. The expression of nuclear factor-kappa B (p65-NF-kB) in lung of VAChT-deficient mice were higher than in wild-type mice, whereas a decreased expression of janus-kinase 2 (JAK2) was observed in the lung of mutant animals. Our findings show the first evidence that cholinergic deficiency impaired lung function and produce local inflammation. Our data supports the notion that cholinergic system modulates airway inflammation by modulation of JAK2 and NF-kB pathway. We proposed that intact cholinergic pathway is necessary to maintain the lung homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1979997467,"The aim of this study was to investigate possible changes of cortical thickness in the visual cortex in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) of varying severity. Twenty normal controls (NC), 20 mild (MP) and 17 severe (SP) POAG patients were recruited and scanned using magnetic resonance imaging. Cortical thickness analyses with regions of interest (V1, V2, ventral V3, V4 and V5/MT+) were used to assess the cortical changes among the three groups. Furthermore, the associations of cortical thickness with retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and mean deviation of visual field were analyzed. Compared with the NC group, decreased cortical thickness was detected in the bilateral V5/MT+ areas in the MP group and the left V1, bilateral V2 and V5/MT+ areas in the SP group. Cortical thinning of the bilateral V2 areas was detected in the SP group compared with the MP group. In addition, cortical thinning of these visual areas was related to the ophthalmologic measurements. In conclusion, POAG patients exhibit cortical thinning in the bilateral V5/MT+ in the early stage of disease. The cortical degeneration in visual areas is discrepant with disease progressing and the dorsal pathway might be selectively damaged in POAG. Therefore, the cortical thinning of these visual areas may play a key role in the progression of POAG and can serve as a novel biomarker for accurately evaluating the severity of POAG."
https://openalex.org/W2073119030,"In a previous study, we showed that the silencing of the heavy subunit (FHC) offerritin, the central iron storage molecule in the cell, is accompanied by a modification in global gene expression. In this work, we explored whether different FHC amounts might modulate miRNA expression levels in K562 cells and studied the impact of miRNAs in gene expression profile modifications. To this aim, we performed a miRNA-mRNA integrative analysis in K562 silenced for FHC (K562shFHC) comparing it with K562 transduced with scrambled RNA (K562shRNA). Four miRNAs, namely hsa-let-7g, hsa-let-7f, hsa-let-7i and hsa-miR-125b, were significantly up-regulated in silenced cells. The remarkable down-regulation of these miRNAs, following FHC expression rescue, supports a specific relation between FHC silencing and miRNA-modulation. The integration of target predictions with miRNA and gene expression profiles led to the identification of a regulatory network which includes the miRNAs up-regulated by FHC silencing, as well as91 down-regulated putative target genes. These genes were further classified in 9 networks; the highest scoring network, “Cell Death and Survival, Hematological System Development and Function, Hematopoiesis”, is composed by 18 focus molecules including RAF1 and ERK1/2. We confirmed that, following FHC silencing, ERK1/2 phosphorylation is severely impaired and that RAF1 mRNA is significantly down-regulated. Taken all together, our data indicate that, in our experimental model, FHC silencing may affect RAF1/pERK1/2 levels through the modulation of a specific set of miRNAs and add new insights in to the relationship among iron homeostasis and miRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1986297374,"Oxalic acid is an important virulence factor for disease caused by the fungal necrotrophic pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, yet calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals have not been widely reported. B. carinata stems were infected with S. sclerotiorum and observed using light microscopy. Six hours post inoculation (hpi), CaOx crystals were evident on 46% of stem sections and by 72 hpi on 100%, demonstrating that the secretion of oxalic acid by S. sclerotiorum commences before hyphal penetration. This is the first time CaOx crystals have been reported on B. carinata infected with S. sclerotiorum. The shape of crystals varied as infection progressed. Long tetragonal rods were dominant 12 hpi (68% of crystal-containing samples), but by 72 hpi, 50% of stems displayed bipyramidal crystals, and only 23% had long rods. Scanning electron microscopy from 24 hpi revealed CaOx crystals in all samples, ranging from tiny irregular crystals (< 0.5 μm) to large (up to 40 μm) highly organized arrangements. Crystal morphology encompassed various forms, including tetragonal prisms, oval plates, crystal sand, and druses. Large conglomerates of CaOx crystals were observed in the hyphal mass 72 hpi and these are proposed as a strategy of the fungus to hold and detoxify Ca2+ions. The range of crystal morphologies suggests that S. sclerotiorum growth and infection controls the form taken by CaOx crystals."
https://openalex.org/W2087621527,"The inflammatory response has been implicated in the pathogenesis of left ventricular (LV) remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI). An anthraquinone compound with anti-inflammatory properties, diacerein inhibits the synthesis and activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukins 1 and 6. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of diacerein on ventricular remodeling in vivo.Ligation of the left anterior descending artery was used to induce MI in an experimental rat model. Rats were divided into two groups: a control group that received saline solution (n = 16) and a group that received diacerein (80 mg/kg) daily (n = 10). After 4 weeks, the LV volume, cellular signaling, caspase 3 activity, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) transcription were compared between the two groups. After 4 weeks, end-diastolic and end-systolic LV volumes were reduced in the treatment group compared to the control group (p < .01 and p < .01, respectively). Compared to control rats, diacerein-treated rats exhibited less fibrosis in the LV (14.65%± 7.27% vs. 22.57%± 8.94%; p < .01), lower levels of caspase-3 activity, and lower levels of NF-κB p65 transcription.Treatment with diacerein once a day for 4 weeks after MI improved ventricular remodeling by promoting lower end-systolic and end-diastolic LV volumes. Diacerein also reduced fibrosis in the LV. These effects might be associated with partial blockage of the NF-κB pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2112215852,"Background Cryptosporidium infection is a worldwide cause of diarrheal disease. To gain insight into the epidemiology of the infection in a certain geographic area, molecular methods are needed to determine the species/genotypes and subtypes. Methodology/Principal Findings From 2004 to 2009, 161 cryptosporidiosis cases were detected in two hospitals in Barcelona. Diagnosis was performed by microscopic observation of oocysts in stool specimens following modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining. Most cases (82%) occurred in children. The number of cases increased in summer and autumn. Molecular characterization of Cryptosporidium was performed in 69 specimens, and C. hominis and C. parvum were identified in 88.4% and 10.1% of the cases, respectively. C. meleagridis was detected in one specimen. Subtyping based on the gp60 polymorphism showed six subtypes, four C. hominis and two C. parvum. Subtype IbA10G2 was the most prevalent subtype corresponding to 90% of all C. hominis isolates. This is the first report on the distribution of specific Cryptosporidium subtypes from humans in Spain. Conclusions/Significance In our geographic area, the anthroponotic behavior of C. hominis, the lower infective dose, and the higher virulence of certain subtypes may contribute to the high incidence of human cryptosporidiosis caused by the IbA10G2 subtype. Further studies should include populations with asymptomatic shedding of the parasite."
https://openalex.org/W2169660518,"Purpose Cerebral microvascular disease is associated with dementia. Differences in the topography of the retinal vascular network may be a marker for cerebrovascular disease. The association between cerebral microvascular state and non-pathological cognitive ageing is less clear, particularly because studies are rarely able to adjust for pre-morbid cognitive ability level. We measured retinal vascular fractal dimension (Df) as a potential marker of cerebral microvascular disease. We examined the extent to which it contributes to differences in non-pathological cognitive ability in old age, after adjusting for childhood mental ability. Methods Participants from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 Study (LBC1936) had cognitive ability assessments and retinal photographs taken of both eyes aged around 73 years (n = 648). IQ scores were available from childhood. Retinal vascular Df was calculated with monofractal and multifractal analysis, performed on custom-written software. Multiple regression models were applied to determine associations between retinal vascular Df and general cognitive ability (g), processing speed, and memory. Results Only three out of 24 comparisons (two eyes × four Df parameters × three cognitive measures) were found to be significant. This is little more than would be expected by chance. No single association was verified by an equivalent association in the contralateral eye. Conclusions The results show little evidence that fractal measures of retinal vascular differences are associated with non-pathological cognitive ageing."

The underlying neurobiological basis of CD remains unclear. Objective The present study investigated whether participants with CD have altered hemodynamic activity under resting-state conditions. Methods Eighteen medication-naïve boys with CD and 18 age- and sex- matched typically developing (TD) controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in the resting state. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) was measured and compared between the CD and TD groups. Results Compared with the TD participants, the CD participants showed lower ALFF in the bilateral amygdala/parahippocampus, right lingual gyrus, left cuneus and right insula. Higher ALFF was observed in the right fusiform gyrus and right thalamus in the CD participants compared to the TD group. Conclusions Youth with CD displayed widespread functional abnormalities in emotion-related and visual cortical regions in the resting state. These results suggest that deficits in the intrinsic activity of resting state networks may contribute to the etiology of CD."
https://openalex.org/W2038980935,"The immune system provides vital protection against pathogens, but extensive evidence suggests that mounting immune responses can entail survival and fecundity costs. The physiological mechanisms that underpin these costs remain poorly understood, despite their potentially important role in shaping life-histories. Recent studies involving laboratory models highlight the possibility that oxidative stress could mediate these costs, as immune-activation can increase the production of reactive oxygen species leading to oxidative stress. However, this hypothesis has rarely been tested in free-ranging wild populations, where natural oxidative statuses and compensatory strategies may moderate immune responses and their impacts on oxidative status. Furthermore, the possibility that individuals scale their immune responses according to their oxidative status, conceivably to mitigate such costs, remains virtually unexplored. Here, we experimentally investigate the effects of a phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) immune-challenge on oxidative status in wild male and female white-browed sparrow weavers, Plocepasser mahali. We also establish whether baseline oxidative status prior to challenge predicts the scale of the immune responses. Contrary to previous work on captive animals, our findings suggest that PHA-induced immune-activation does not elicit oxidative stress. Compared with controls (n = 25 birds), PHA-injected birds (n = 27 birds) showed no evidence of a differential change in markers of oxidative damage or enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant protection 24 hours after challenge. We did, however, find that the activity of a key antioxidant enzyme (superoxide dismutase, SOD) prior to immune-activation predicted the scale of the resulting swelling: birds with stronger initial SOD activity subsequently produced smaller swellings. Our findings (i) suggest that wild birds can mount immune responses without suffering from systemic oxidative stress, and (ii) lend support to biomedical evidence that baseline oxidative status can impact the scale of immune responses; a possibility not yet recognised in ecological studies of immunity."

Eighty-two healthy subjects, 10 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 10 with spinal muscular atrophy and 10 with spinal cord injuries were studied. DTbM was compared with active surface method (ASM), threshold-based method (TbM) and manual outlining (ground truth). Accuracy of segmentations was scored visually by a radiologist in cervical and thoracic cord regions. Accuracy was also quantified at the cervical and thoracic levels as well as at C2 vertebral level. To construct a cervical template from healthy subjects' images (n=59), a standardization pipeline was designed leading to well-centered straight spinal cord images and accurate probability tissue map.Visual scoring showed better performance for DTbM than for ASM. Mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was 95.71% for DTbM and 90.78% for ASM at the cervical level and 94.27% for DTbM and 89.93% for ASM at the thoracic level. Finally, at C2 vertebral level, mean DSC was 97.98% for DTbM compared with 98.02% for TbM and 96.76% for ASM. DTbM showed similar accuracy compared with TbM, but with the advantage of limited manual interaction.A semi-automated segmentation method with limited manual intervention was introduced and validated on 3T images, enabling the construction of a cervical spinal cord template."
https://openalex.org/W2047596027,"Hepatic steatosis is the accumulation of excess fat in the liver. Recently, hepatic steatosis has become more important because it occurs in the patients with obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia and is associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and insulin resistance. C-C chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) inhibitor has been reported to improve inflammation and glucose intolerance in diabetes, but its mechanisms remained unknown in hepatic steatosis. We examined whether CCR2 inhibitor improves ER stress-induced hepatic steatosis in type 2 diabetic mice. In this study, db/db and db/m (n = 9) mice were fed CCR2 inhibitor (2 mg/kg/day) for 9 weeks. In diabetic mice, CCR2 inhibitor decreased plasma and hepatic triglycerides levels and improved insulin sensitivity. Moreover, CCR2 inhibitor treatment decreased ER stress markers (e.g., BiP, ATF4, CHOP, and XBP-1) and inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNFα, IL-6, and MCP-1) while increasing markers of mitochondrial biogenesis (e.g., PGC-1α, Tfam, and COX1) in the liver. We suggest that CCR2 inhibitor may ameliorate hepatic steatosis by reducing ER stress and inflammation in type 2 diabetes mellitus."

Smoking increases the risk of metabolic syndrome (MS) and cardiovascular disease. Almost no previous studies have evaluated the combined effect of MS and smoking status on CAC. Therefore, in this study we examined the relationships between CAC, MS, and smoking. This study included 775 adult males without histories of cardiovascular disease who visited the Health Promotion Center at the University Hospital in Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea from January 2, 2010 to December 31, 2012. All subjects were screened for CAC by multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT). CAC increased significantly with age and body mass index (BMI). Among MS components, abdominal obesity and elevated fasting blood glucose were correlated with CAC. After adjusting for age and BMI, MS was associated with a 1.46-fold increase in CAC (95% CI:1.02-2.09), abdominal obesity was associated with a 1.45-fold increase (95% CI:1.04-2.04), elevated fasting blood glucose was associated with a 2-fold increase (95% CI:1.36-2.94), and MS and smoking combined were associated with 2.44-fold increase in CAC. Thus, the combination of smoking and MS had a greater impact on CAC than any single factor alone. MS is correlated with an increased risk of CAC, and a combination of MS and smoking is associated with even greater risk. These findings can be used to prevent cardiovascular disease in adults."
https://openalex.org/W2038045321,"The severity of influenza-related illness is mediated by many factors, including in vivo cell tropism, timing and magnitude of the immune response, and presence of pre-existing immunity. A direct way to study cell tropism and virus spread in vivo is with an influenza virus expressing a reporter gene. However, reporter gene-expressing influenza viruses are often attenuated in vivo and may be genetically unstable. Here, we describe the generation of an influenza A virus expressing GFP from a tri-cistronic NS segment. To reduce the size of this engineered gene segment, we used a truncated NS1 protein of 73 amino acids combined with a heterologous dimerization domain to increase protein stability. GFP and nuclear export protein coding information were fused in frame with the truncated NS1 open reading frame and separated from each other by 2A self-processing sites. The resulting PR8-NS1(1-73)GFP virus was successfully rescued and replicated as efficiently as the parental PR8 virus in vitro and was slightly attenuated in vivo. Flow cytometry-based monitoring of cells isolated from PR8-NS1(1-73)GFP virus infected BALB/c mice revealed that GFP expression peaked on day two in all cell types tested. In particular respiratory epithelial cells and myeloid cells known to be involved in antigen presentation, including dendritic cells (CD11c+) and inflammatory monocytes (CD11b+ GR1+), became GFP positive following infection. Prophylactic treatment with anti-M2e monoclonal antibody or oseltamivir reduced GFP expression in all cell types studied, demonstrating the usefulness of this reporter virus to analyze the efficacy of antiviral treatments in vivo. Finally, deep sequencing analysis, serial in vitro passages and ex vivo analysis of PR8-NS1(1-73)GFP virus, indicate that this virus is genetically and phenotypically stable."

These findings are strong indicators that the mummy suffered from aortic atherosclerosis during her lifetime. The present study is a good example of how CT images of vascular calcifications can be a useful diagnostic tool in forming at least preliminary diagnoses of ancient atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2019972493,"Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that some bacteria colonization or infections in early-life increased the risk for subsequent asthma development. However, little is known about the mechanisms by which early-life bacterial infection increases this risk. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of neonatal Streptococcus pneumoniae infection on the development of adulthood asthma, and to explore the possible mechanism. A non-lethal S. pneumoniae lung infection was established by intranasal inoculation of neonatal (1-week-old) female mice with D39. Mice were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin in adulthood to induce allergic airways disease (AAD). Twenty-four hours later, the lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected to assess AAD. Neonatal S. pneumoniae infection exacerbated adulthood hallmark features of AAD, with enhanced airway hyperresponsiveness and increased neutrophil recruitment into the airways, increased Th17 cells and interleukin (IL)-17A productions. Depletion of IL-17A by i.p. injection of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody reduced neutrophil recruitment into the airways, alleviated airway inflammation and decreased airway hyperresponsiveness. Furthermore, IL-17A depletion partially restored levels of inteferon-γ, but had no effect on the release of IL-5 or IL-13. Our data suggest that neonatal S. pneumoniae infection may promote the development of adulthood asthma in association with increased IL-17A production."
https://openalex.org/W2095217092,"During chemotherapy, drug resistance caused by autophagy remains a major challenge to successful treatment of cancer patients. The purpose of this study is to show that ulinastatin (UTI), a trypsin inhibitor, could reduce the resistance of liver cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agent epirubicin (EPI). We achieved this conclusion by analyzing the effect of EPI alone or UTI plus EPI on SMMC-7721 and MHCC-LM3 liver cancer cells. We also generated an EPI-resistant liver cancer cell line (MHCC-LM3er cells), and found that UTI could sensitize the LM3er cells to EPI. Autophagy usually functions to protect cancer cells during chemotherapy. Our study showed that UTI inhibited the autophagy induced by EPI in liver cancer cells, which promoted apoptosis, and therefore, reduced the resistance of the cancer cells to EPI. Further studies showed that the UTI-mediated inhibition on autophagy was achieved by inhibiting transcriptional factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway. To verify our results in vivo, we injected MHCC-LM3 liver cancer cells or EPI-resistant LM3er cells into mice, and found that EPI could only effectively inhibit the growth of tumor in MHCC-LM3 cell-injected mice, but not in LM3er cell-injected mice. However, when UTI was also administered, the growth of tumor was inhibited in the MHCC-LM3er cell-injected mice as well. Our results suggest that UTI may be used in combination with anti-cancer drugs, such as EPI, to improve the outcome of cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2045956248,"Background The Chinese goose is one of the most economically important poultry birds and is a natural reservoir for many avian viruses. However, the nature and regulation of the innate and adaptive immune systems of this waterfowl species are not completely understood due to limited information on the goose genome. Recently, transcriptome sequencing technology was applied in the genomic studies focused on novel gene discovery. Thus, this study described the transcriptome of the goose peripheral blood lymphocytes to identify immunity relevant genes. Principal Findings De novo transcriptome assembly of the goose peripheral blood lymphocytes was sequenced by Illumina-Solexa technology. In total, 211,198 unigenes were assembled from the 69.36 million cleaned reads. The average length, N50 size and the maximum length of the assembled unigenes were 687 bp, 1,298 bp and 18,992 bp, respectively. A total of 36,854 unigenes showed similarity by BLAST search against the NCBI non-redundant (Nr) protein database. For functional classification, 163,161 unigenes were comprised of three Gene Ontology (Go) categories and 67 subcategories. A total of 15,334 unigenes were annotated into 25 eukaryotic orthologous groups (KOGs) categories. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database annotated 39,585 unigenes into six biological functional groups and 308 pathways. Among the 2,757 unigenes that participated in the 15 immune system KEGG pathways, 125 of the most important immune relevant genes were summarized and analyzed by STRING analysis to identify gene interactions and relationships. Moreover, 10 genes were confirmed by PCR and analyzed. Of these 125 unigenes, 109 unigenes, approximately 87%, were not previously identified in the goose. Conclusion This de novo transcriptome analysis could provide important Chinese goose sequence information and highlights the value of new gene discovery, pathways investigation and immune system gene identification, and comparison with other avian species as useful tools to understand the goose immune system."
https://openalex.org/W2049013605,"Morphological alterations of cells can lead to modulation of gene expression. An essential link is the MKL1-dependent activation of serum response factor (SRF), which translates changes in the ratio of G- and F-actin into mRNA transcription. SRF activation is only partially characterized in non-transformed epithelial cells. Therefore, the impact of GTPases of the Rho family and changes in F-actin structures were analyzed in renal proximal tubular epithelial cells. Activation of SRF signaling was compared to the regulation of a known MKL1/SRF target gene, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). In the human proximal tubular cell line HKC-8 overexpression of two actin mutants either favoring or preventing the formation of F-actin fibers regulated SRF-mediated transcription as well as CTGF expression. Only overexpression of constitutively active RhoA activated SRF-dependent gene expression whereas no effect was detected upon overexpression of Rac1 mutants. To elucidate the functional role of Rho kinases as downstream mediators of RhoA, pharmacological inhibition and genetic inhibition by transient siRNA knock down were compared. Upon stimulation with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) Rho kinase inhibitors partially suppressed SRF-mediated transcription, whereas interference with Rho kinase expression by siRNA reduced activation of SRF, but barely affected CTGF expression. Together with the partial inhibition of CTGF expression by the pharmacological inhibitors Y27432 and H1154, Rho kinases seem to be less important in mediating RhoA signaling related to CTGF expression in HKC-8 epithelial cells. Short term pharmacological inhibition of Rac1 activity by EHT1864 reduced SRF-dependent CTGF expression in HKC-8 cells, but was overcome by a stimulatory effect after prolonged incubation after 4-6 h. Similarly, human primary cells of proximal but not of distal tubular origin showed inhibitory as well as stimulatory effects of Rac1 inhibition. Thus, RhoA signaling activates MKL1-SRF-mediated CTGF expression in proximal tubular cells, whereas Rac1 signaling is more complex with adaptive cellular responses."
https://openalex.org/W2093333022,"Automatic segmentation of nuclei in reflectance confocal microscopy images is critical for visualization and rapid quantification of nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, a useful indicator of epithelial precancer. Reflectance confocal microscopy can provide three-dimensional imaging of epithelial tissue in vivo with sub-cellular resolution. Changes in nuclear density or nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio as a function of depth obtained from confocal images can be used to determine the presence or stage of epithelial cancers. However, low nuclear to background contrast, low resolution at greater imaging depths, and significant variation in reflectance signal of nuclei complicate segmentation required for quantification of nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio. Here, we present an automated segmentation method to segment nuclei in reflectance confocal images using a pulse coupled neural network algorithm, specifically a spiking cortical model, and an artificial neural network classifier. The segmentation algorithm was applied to an image model of nuclei with varying nuclear to background contrast. Greater than 90% of simulated nuclei were detected for contrast of 2.0 or greater. Confocal images of porcine and human oral mucosa were used to evaluate application to epithelial tissue. Segmentation accuracy was assessed using manual segmentation of nuclei as the gold standard."
https://openalex.org/W2146886248,"In 2007, Q fever started to become a major public health problem in the Netherlands, with small ruminants as most probable source. In order to reduce environmental contamination, control measures for manure were implemented because of the assumption that manure was highly contaminated with Coxiella burnetii. The aims of this study were 1) to clarify the role of C. burnetii contaminated manure from dairy goat farms in the transmission of C. burnetii to humans, 2) to assess the impact of manure storage on temperature profiles in dunghills, and 3) to calculate the decimal reduction time of the Nine Mile RSA 493 reference strain of C. burnetii under experimental conditions in different matrices. For these purposes, records on distribution of manure from case and control herds were mapped and a potential relation to incidences of human Q fever was investigated. Additionally, temperatures in two dunghills were measured and related to heat resistance of C. burnetii. Results of negative binomial regression showed no significant association between the incidence of human Q fever cases and the source of manure. Temperature measurements in the core and shell of dunghills on two farms were above 40°C for at least ten consecutive days which would result in a strong reduction of C. burnetii over time. Our findings indicate that there is no relationship between incidence of human Q fever and land applied manure from dairy goat farms with an abortion wave caused by C. burnetii. Temperature measurements in dunghills on two farms with C. burnetii shedding dairy goat herds further support the very limited role of goat manure as a transmission route during the Dutch human Q fever outbreak. It is very likely that the composting process within a dunghill will result in a clear reduction in the number of viable C. burnetii."
https://openalex.org/W2157892517,"IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common form of primary glomerulonephritis worldwide. In recent years, consistent efforts have been made to develop new non-invasive biomarkers for IgAN progression. In our previous in vitro study we found mesangial derived CXCL1 as a contributor for kidney injury, and observed higher urinary CXCL1 levels in patients with IgAN. It implied that the urinary CXCL1 might be a potential biomarker.In the present study, we enrolled 425 IgAN patients with follow-up data and detected their urinary CXCL1 levels at the time of renal biopsy, to explore the predictive value of urinary CXCL1 in IgAN progression. Urinary CXCL1 levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Urinary CXCL1 levels were associated with presently well established predictors of IgAN progression, including SBP (r = 0.138, p = 0.004), DBP (r = 0.114, p = 0.019), proteinuria (r = 0.155, p = 0.001), eGFR (r = -0.259, p<0.001) and tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis (r = 0.181, p<0.001). After adjusted for them, higher levels of urinary CXCL1 were independently associated with a greater risk of deterioration in renal function (HR, per s.d. increment of natural log-transformed CXCL1: 1.748; 95% CI: 1.222-2.499, P = 0.002). Furthermore, time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that urinary CXCL1, when combined with proteinuria and eGFR, could enhance the prognostic value of these traditional predictors for IgAN progression.The results in our present study suggested urinary CXCL1 as a new non-invasive predictor of IgAN progression."

In this Commentary, we describe how a scientific understanding of recipes and techniques facilitates the development of new textures and expands the flavor palette. The new dishes that result engage our senses in unexpected ways. Molecular gastronomy’s beginnings can be traced to the 1970s and an emerging curiosity about the scientific aspects of the foods we eat. As Nicolas Kurti, Professor of Physics at Oxford, famously stated, “It is a sad reflection on our civilization that while we can and do measure the temperature in the atmosphere of Venus, we do not know what goes on inside our soufflés” (McGee, 1984McGee H. On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen. Scribner, 1984Google Scholar). Acting upon this sentiment and in collaboration with the physical chemist Hervé This, Kurti began to convene regular gatherings in Erice, Italy, bringing together professional chefs and scientists—among them, Pierre Gilles de Gennes, the Nobel prize winning physicist who popularized the study of physics of soft materials, as well as Harold McGee, who wrote the remarkable treatise “On Food and Cooking” (McGee, 1984McGee H. On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen. Scribner, 1984Google Scholar). This questioning of the biophysical basis of foods coincided with a burgeoning movement in the culinary world, spurred largely by the chef Ferran Adrià, who aimed to use emerging knowledge about the science behind recipes to rethink and reengineer foods and create new textures and tastes. Part of his program involved developing more precise methods for controlling cooking protocols, such as immersion heaters, rotovaps, and centrifuges. When these are applied to foods, a panoply of rich transitions are uncovered, leading to new textures and tastes. The simplest example of creating new textures is the common task of cooking an egg. Chefs routinely cook eggs in boiling water, but an immersion heater allows cooking them at any desired temperature and observing sensitive changes in the texture that have been otherwise impossible to note. Which chef was the first to carry out precise temperature-controlled cooking on an egg is unclear, but a remarkable process was discovered: between 60°C and 70°C, critical biophysical transitions occur in chicken eggs; this is the range in which the different proteins within the yolk and white unfold. Strikingly, differences of less than 1°C lead to significant textural and structural changes. Indeed, a well-trained chef can predict the temperature of the water bath within a half a degree based on the texture of the egg, and eggs cooked even just a couple degrees apart have very different culinary applications (Figure 1). At its core, the biophysical transitions that happen when cooking an egg are the same ones that biology regulates against: the unfolding and subsequent aggregation of proteins. Textures arise because denaturing proteins gradually expose previously buried fragments, enabling crosslinks to form between different proteins so that the protein mixture becomes a gel. As the temperature increases, more of the proteins are exposed, and the crosslinks become stronger and more numerous. This is due to both the continued unfolding of individual proteins and the ensuing unfolding of more stable ones. Microscopically, the unfolded proteins bond in complex patterns, and the resulting macroscopic texture arises from the nature of these arrangements. Thus, manipulating the crosslinked matrix by precisely adjusting the cooking temperature allows the control of macroscopic texture. Several scientific concepts describe the macroscopic aspects of texture and how they relate to the underlying microscopic arrangement. One is quantified by the elastic modulus, which measures the resistance of the material to deformation. Roughly speaking, the elastic modulus E=Uinteraction/l3, where Uinteraction is the binding energy between the crosslinks, and l is the typical distance between the crosslinks. The material thus becomes harder to deform when the binding energy or density of the crosslinks increases. Another aspect of texture is plasticity, which occurs when crosslinks easily remodel; a material with high plasticity will not recover its original shape when deformed. Yet another concept is the yield stress, which is the minimal stress that can be applied to the material for the crosslinks to break and the material to fracture. Soft condensed matter science has given a qualitative understanding of how these macroscopic properties are related to the microstructure of materials. But how they apply in detail to the intricate suite of textural transitions in an egg is not well understood; we do not know how the microscopic structure of the egg’s crosslinked interior changes as a function of temperature nor how the different parts of egg proteins contribute to the final texture. Importantly, we also don’t know which physical properties correspond to the mouthfeel of a food. These questions are not just academic: for example, if the biophysics of the transitions in an egg were better understood, it might be possible to redesign the egg to have different properties as it is heated. One could imagine mixing different concentrations of the protein constituting egg whites to manipulate the textural transitions, or mixing egg proteins taken from different organisms with distinct denaturation and aggregation properties. Moreover, tuning individual proteins to prescribed macroscopic properties could have utility well beyond cooking. Another aspect of Adrià’s culinary revolution involved introducing new ingredients. One such set of ingredients are molecules called hydrocolloids, which can be used to create new textures in the form of different types of emulsions, foams, and gels, all hallmark components of the modernist kitchen. A particular explosion occurred with gelling agents, a subgroup within this category, which mostly consists of carbohydrates. Whereas a century ago, the major gelling agent in Western-style kitchens was gelatin derived from animal collagen, today’s chefs routinely use gelling agents derived from a diverse range of organisms that allow control of texture and properties in new regimes. These ingredients include methylcellulose, xanthan gum, agar, and gellan, each having distinct biophysical properties that differ from the standard gelling agents. For example, whereas gelatin gels between 4°C and 35°C, methylcellulose gels between 50°C and 90°C. This property, allowing creation of a hot gel, led to Adrià’s invention of hot ice cream, which has the same texture and rheology as ordinary ice cream but only when served at high enough temperatures. Similarly, spherification, one of Adrià’s signature dishes and characteristic of molecular gastronomy, also makes use of a gelling agent: alginate, a polymer found in sea weed, which forms crosslinks with calcium ions, resulting in a thin gel that encapsulates a sphere of liquid flavor (Figure 2A). Another example is gellan, derived from the bacterium Pseudomonas elodea, which has both a high melting temperature and also a low yield stress. This material enabled Heston Blumenthal to create a famous dish, hot and cold tea (Blumenthal, 2009Blumenthal H. The Fat Duck Cookbook. Bloomsbury, 2009Google Scholar), in which a glass of tea is divided into two halves: the left half is served cold, whereas the right half is served hot. Gellan strengthens the gel sufficiently to separate the two halves of the tea cup but breaks up immediately upon pouring. The textures of the two teas are identical, allowing the consumer to simultaneously taste hot and cold tea on different sides of the tongue. To date, chefs have capitalized on the tremendous diversity of gelling agents produced by organisms in the natural world to create a wide range of foods in new parameter regimes. There is much room for further creativity, with increased understanding of why the different gelling agents work as they do. For example, one could imagine engineering organisms to produce gelling agents with distinct properties. Thus far we have discussed culinary manipulations of food texture; the second major aspect of cooking affected by the culinary revolution is flavor. Flavor arises from the combination of several sensory experiences—most notably, the thousands of taste receptors on our tongues and the olfactory receptors in the upper nasal passages. While the number of tastes that can be experienced by humans are limited to the well-known five—sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami—we can sense orders of magnitudes more smells. Flavor compounds tend to be small molecules, and in the case of olfaction they are also volatile, which allows them to be transported from the food to the nasal passage. While many flavor molecules exist as preformed compounds in the cooking ingredient and are released when the tissues of foods are damaged, as is the case with the pungent molecules in mustard seeds, others are formed during the cooking process through the application of heat, mechanical force, or other procedures. This is the case for many fruity aromas, which are created when tissue damage releases enzymes that react with molecules in fruit cells to produce esters. There are three noteworthy methods for producing small flavor molecules in modern haute cuisine. The first is to capture and concentrate them. Modernist chefs use a variety of techniques to extract, isolate, and concentrate flavor and aroma molecules, many of which draw on methods and equipment from biology and chemistry laboratories. These range from filtering to centrifugation to vacuum infusions. For example, Nathan Myhrvold uses centrifugation as a way to isolate flavorful carotene butter from carrot juice and laboratory sieves and agar filtering to concentrate purees and soups (Myhrvold et al., 2011Myhrvold N. Young C. Bilet M. Smith R.M. Modernist Cuisine: The Art and Science of Cooking.First Edition. Cooking Lab, 2011Google Scholar). One of the most popular pieces of equipment for isolating and concentrating flavor is the rotovap. Long a stalwart of chemistry laboratories but introduced in the last decade into high-end cooking, rotovaps allow gentle, low-heat separation of certain molecules based on their volatility. Thus, compounds that would easily boil off or decompose at standard boiling temperature can be captured and served as part of a dish. For example, Joan Roca, of the restaurant Can Roca in Spain, uses a rotovap to capture the flavor molecules of eucalyptus leaves and citrus peel, both consisting of molecules that easily vaporize and disappear; the distillates are then used as a base for sorbets and other cold desserts (Figure 2B). Roca also uses the same technique to make a gel from distilled forest soil, which he then serves with an oyster, creating a completely novel flavor combination that would be impossible to achieve without the rotovap. A second method for producing flavor is creating small flavor molecules through chemical reactions. Aspects of this practice have clearly been a part of cooking long before the advent of molecular gastronomy—simply heating or cutting into foods can initiate chemical reactions—but recent developments in techniques and equipment have not only brought advances in this field, but have also suggested further potential for discovery. One example is the diversity of flavors produced by caramellization and Maillard reactions. Caramellization denotes the decomposition of sugars at high heat, whereas Maillard reactions result from complex reactions initiated by amino acids reacting with sugars. Both reactions are highly temperature and pH sensitive and must be carefully controlled not to result in strong and bitter flavors. However, if correctly manipulated, these reactions contribute to the complex flavors of diverse foods ranging from steak to maple syrup to champagne. Modernist chefs found ways to enhance these effects using pressure cookers, which not only speed up flavor production, but also produce more intense flavors. Though Maillard and caramellization reactions create marvelous results even with a relatively modest knowledge of the underlying chemistry, both could potentially be deconstructed and controlled even more carefully, with the opportunity of isolating novel flavors from the plethora of flavor molecules resulting from these reactions. A third method of producing new flavors in foods is fermentation, which relies on microbes breaking down large molecules in vegetable and animal products, such as proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, into an array of much smaller molecules. Fermentation is an age-old method of producing intense, complex, and incredibly diverse flavors: coffee, soy sauce, cheese, chocolate, wine, and vinegar—the contemplation of almost any list of fermented foods is a telling illustration of the powerful relationship between fermentation and flavor. In many cases, flavor production is the primary purpose of the fermentation reaction, such as in soy sauce and traditional fermented fish sauces. But in other cases, the flavor molecules are delicious byproducts of what might be taken to be the primary goal of the process. For instance, in wine production, where the preserving and intoxicating properties of ethanol from glucose drive the fermentation, it is the myriad enzymatic byproducts that create the complex and nuanced flavors of wine. A relatively recent trend in haute cuisine is the experimentation with fermentation reactions to create new foods. David Chang, for example, works with unconventional combinations of foods and microbes to create new recipes, such as pomegranate seeds with lactic acid bacteria, commonly used in dairy fermentations, or locally grown farro with Aspergillus oryzae, a mold traditionally used in Asian cuisines for miso and sake production (Figure 2C). The design and characterization of such novel fermentation processes are still in their infancy but hold much potential as a field for further discovery. We hope that we’ve succeeded in bringing across the message that the biophysical properties of molecules underlying cooking provide much interesting fodder for scientific inquiry. The culinary revolution has, however, pushed this notion further, and the design of new dishes has itself become a highly experimental enterprise. In the process of optimizing the incorporation of new ingredients and equipment into the kitchen, chefs experiment in ways similar to scientists. Failure of a given idea gives rise to new ones, eventually leading to creations that might not even be related to the original idea. Heston Blumenthal described this process in the context of creating the recipe for hot and cold tea as involving “endless trials” and “infinitesimal precision” (Blumenthal, 2009Blumenthal H. The Fat Duck Cookbook. Bloomsbury, 2009Google Scholar). This is an attitude to cooking that sticks to this day and is apparent in many aspects of molecular gastronomy. For example, a common theme in modernist kitchens is the frequent and complete overturn of the menu preceded by intense periods of research and experimentation. Ferran Adrià initiated this trend at his famed restaurant elBulli, which closed for 6 months of the year while his team withdrew to a workshop in order to exclusively focus on the creation of next year’s menu. Interestingly, the emphasis on culinary experimentation not only expanded cooking into the realm of science, but it also allowed it to take on characteristics from the arts. With the realization that new ingredients and equipment do more than simply offer an opportunity to tweak traditional recipes, chefs began exploring the creation of uniquely novel dishes. These creations play on the faculties of all senses, including notions of emotions and memories evoked by tastes and aromas, our expectations of food, and the element of surprise as a dish turns out to be something different from what it appears to be. As an example, a common theme in the modernist kitchen is the deconstructed dish, which separates the components of a familiar recipe into individual pieces with novel and imaginative textures. Wylie Dufresne’s take on eggs benedict, which consists of deep-fried hollandaise sauce served with concentrated egg yolk shaped into columns, is an example of this approach (Figure 2D). Another common theme is playing with the diner’s expectations by presenting foods that look different from what they are. Accordingly, Joan Roca famously serves an ice cream dish that is indistinguishable in shape from that of a cigar, and José Andrés of the restaurants Jaleo and minibar uses spherification to make eggs in which the white has been replaced by a rich solution of parmesan cream. In summary, the past two decades have seen an emergence of striking complementarity between the methods, ideas, and culture of the culinary world and basic science. The chef’s goal of transforming the properties of cells and proteins into another form is complementary to scientist’s efforts to understand them. There is much left to be learned at this intersection."

Fifty-one liver biopsy specimens obtained from patients with hepatitis B virus (n = 6), hepatitis C virus (n = 28), and non-viral hepatitis – (n = 9) and standard histological liver (n = 8) as controls (CT) were subjected to qPCR and histopathological exams. Our data revealed a significant difference in the NGF expression levels between the three patient groups and the Control group. p75NTR expression levels in the HCV and NVH groups were higher than those observed in the HBV and Control groups. In cases of liver cirrhosis, higher p75NTR mRNA expression was observed, whereas NGF was expressed at higher levels in patients with hepatic fibrosis. NGF expression was lower in the F1 liver fibrosis stage, and p75NTR receptor expression continuously and proportionately increased compared to the increase in the degree of fibrosis and was significantly higher in livers in fibrosis stages 3 and 4. The hepatic levels of NGF and p75NTR were decreased and increased, respectively, relative to the stage of inflammatory activity. A positive correlation between p75NTR and NGF gene expression was observed in livers with mild to moderate fibrosis, though not in cases of severe fibrosis and cirrhosis. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that the course of chronic liver disease can be regulated by NGF and p75NTR, which function by decreasing or inhibiting hepatocyte regeneration and proliferation."

Herewith, in silico prediction and binding assays on TAP-deficient T2 cells were used to identify potential HLA-A*02:01 ligands in the T. cruzi TcCA-2 protein. The TcCA-2-specific CD8+ T cells were functionality evaluated by Granzyme B and cytokine production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from Chagas disease patients stimulated with the identified HLA-A*02:01 peptides. The specific cells were phenotypically characterized by flow cytometry using several surface markers and HLA-A*02:01 APC-labeled dextramer loaded with the peptides. In the T. cruzi TcCA-2 protein four T CD8+ epitopes were identified which are processed and presented during Chagas disease. Interestingly, a differential cellular phenotypic profile could be correlated with the severity of the disease. The TcCA-2-specific T CD8+ cells from patients with cardiac symptoms are mainly effector memory cells (TEM and TEMRA) while, those present in the asymptomatic phase are predominantly naive cells (TNAIVE). Moreover, in patients with cardiac symptoms the percentage of cells with senescence features is significantly higher than in patients at the asymptomatic phase of the disease. We consider that the identification of these new class I-restricted epitopes are helpful for designing biomarkers of sickness pathology as well as the development of immunotherapies against T. cruzi infection."

The lack of suitable chromosomal integration and expression loci is among the main hurdles of the E. coli engineering efforts. We identified and validated chromosomal integration and expression target sites within E. coli K12 MG1655 flagellar region 1. We analyzed five open reading frames of the flagellar region 1, flgA, flgF, flgG, flgI, and flgJ, that are well-conserved among commonly-used E. coli strains, such as MG1655, W3110, DH10B and BL21-DE3. The efficiency of the integration into the E. coli chromosome and the expression of the introduced genetic circuit at the investigated loci varied significantly. The integrations did not have a negative impact on growth; however, they completely abolished motility. From the investigated E. coli K12 MG1655 flagellar region 1, flgA and flgG are the most suitable chromosomal integration and expression loci."
https://openalex.org/W2093486543,"Alteration of functional regenerative properties of parenchymal lung fibroblasts is widely proposed as a pathogenic mechanism for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, what these functions are and how they are impaired in COPD remain poorly understood. Apart from the role of fibroblasts in producing extracellular matrix, recent studies in organs different from the lung suggest that such cells might contribute to repair processes by acting like mesenchymal stem cells. In addition, several reports sustain that the Hedgehog pathway is altered in COPD patients thus aggravating the disease. Nevertheless, whether this pathway is dysregulated in COPD fibroblasts remains unknown.We investigated the stem cell features and the expression of Hedgehog components in human lung fibroblasts isolated from histologically-normal parenchymal tissue from 25 patients--8 non-smokers/non-COPD, 8 smokers-non COPD and 9 smokers with COPD--who were undergoing surgery for lung tumor resection.We found that lung fibroblasts resemble mesenchymal stem cells in terms of cell surface marker expression, differentiation ability and immunosuppressive potential and that these properties were altered in lung fibroblasts from smokers and even more in COPD patients. Furthermore, we showed that some of these phenotypic changes can be explained by an over activation of the Hedgehog signaling in smoker and COPD fibroblasts.Our study reveals that lung fibroblasts possess mesenchymal stem cell-features which are impaired in COPD via the contribution of an abnormal Hedgehog signaling. These processes should constitute a novel pathomechanism accounting for disease occurrence and progression."
https://openalex.org/W2043978107,"Located in Qinghai Province of China, the Three Rivers Headwaters Region is the source region of the Yangtze, Yellow and Lantsang Rivers, and plays an important role in biodiversity conservation and regulating water supply. Despite many efforts on land use change in Qinghai, knowledge of the spatial variation of land use change is still lacking. This study examines the patterns of land use change across various watersheds, prefectures and the temple surroundings. Remote sensing images of 1987, 1997 and 2007 were analyzed to derive land use distributions; patterns and structures of the landscape were then quantified with landscape metrics. The results illustrated that the Yangtze River headwater region had more diverse and more evenly distributed landscape, while the Lantsang and the Yellow headwater regions showed a decline in landscape diversity. Comparison of the land use patterns of four prefectures revealed that Yushu Prefecture experienced an increase in landscape diversity from 1987 to 2007 while the land use patches in Guoluo Prefecture exhibited more aggregated patterns than other prefectures. Analysis of the spatial variations of land use change in the temple surroundings illustrated that 19.7% and 35.9% of the temples in Guoluo and Yushu Prefectures, respectively, encountered land use change for their immediate areas within 2 km. Comparison of the surroundings of temples and human settlements found that land use change was not evenly distributed, and that greater land use change had occurred for the surroundings of human settlements. Such findings provided insights into the spatial variation of land use change in the Three Rivers Headwaters Region."

https://openalex.org/W1977801274,"Outcome of systemic peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) is unsatisfactory and no controlled clinical study guides the therapy. Phase II studies suggest to consolidate response achieved after front-line treatment with stem cell transplant (SCT). We retrospectively evaluate the impact of front-line SCT consolidation in a single Center cohort of 209 patients treated during the last two decades. Median age was 49 years (range 15-85) with a prevalence of male sex (61%), advanced stage (68%) while IPI was >2 in 44%. Primary treatment was MACOP-B (39%) CHO(E)P (39%), intensive regimens (18%) or others (4%). Complete response to primary treatment (i.e. before SCT) was 60% (5% partial remission). Forty-four patients further proceeded to SCT while 92 did not receive consolidation. Outcome of primary responders was good, with a 3-year overall survival of 74% (82% in ALCL ALK+ and 69% for the other histologies). By multivariate analysis a better overall survival was significantly associated with IPI<2 (P=0.001), primary response (P=0.000), and ALCL ALK+ (P=0.012). The multivariate analysis performed on responders, showed that only IPI was predictive of a better survival while ALCL ALK+ and undergoing SCT were not. Response to primary treatment rather than post-remission programs is the crucial determinant of PTCL outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2044832461,"It is well-established that abnormal protein phosphorylation could play an essential role in tumorgenesis by disrupting a variety of physiological processes such as cell growth, signal transduction and cell motility. Moreover, increasing numbers of phosphorylation-related variants have been identified in association with cancers. ADD1 (α-adducin), a versatile protein expressed ubiquitously in eukaryotes, exerts an important influence on membrane cytoskeleton, cell proliferation and cell-cell communication. Recently, a missense variant at the codon of ADD1’s phosphorylation site, rs4963 (Ser586Cys), was reported to modify the risk of non-cardia gastric cancer. To explore the role of ADD1-rs4963 in colorectal cancer (CRC), we conducted a case-control study with a total of 1054 CRC cases and 1128 matched controls in a Chinese population. After adjustment for variables including age, gender, smoking and drinking, it was demonstrated that this variant significantly conferred susceptibility to CRC (G versus C: OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.03–1.31, P = 0.016; CG versus CC: OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.02–1.55, P = 0.036; GG versus CC: OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.06–1.72, P = 0.015). We further investigated the interaction of ADD1-rs4963 with smoking or drinking exposure, but found no significant result. This study is the first report of an association between ADD1 and CRC risk, promoting our knowledge of the genetics of CRC."
https://openalex.org/W2049306772,"Axon regeneration in the adult central nervous system (CNS) is limited by several factors including a lack of neurotrophic support. Recent studies have shown that glia from the adult rat CNS, specifically retinal astrocytes and Müller glia, can promote regeneration of retinal ganglion cell axons. In the present study we investigated whether retinal glia also exert a growth promoting effect outside the visual system. We found that retinal glial conditioned medium significantly enhanced neurite growth and branching of adult rat dorsal root ganglion neurons (DRG) in culture. Furthermore, transplantation of retinal glia significantly enhanced regeneration of DRG axons past the dorsal root entry zone after root crush in adult rats. To identify the factors that mediate the growth promoting effects of retinal glia, mass spectrometric analysis of retinal glial conditioned medium was performed. Apolipoprotein E and secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) were found to be present in high abundance, a finding further confirmed by western blotting. Inhibition of Apolipoprotein E and SPARC significantly reduced the neuritogenic effects of retinal glial conditioned medium on DRG in culture, suggesting that Apolipoprotein E and SPARC are the major mediators of this regenerative response."

https://openalex.org/W2092318964,"Gain modulation is a key feature of neural information processing, but underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In single neurons, gain can be measured as the slope of the current-frequency (input-output) relationship over any given range of inputs. While much work has focused on the control of basal firing rates and spike rate adaptation, gain control has been relatively unstudied. Of the limited studies on gain control, some have examined the roles of synaptic noise and passive somatic currents, but the roles of voltage-gated channels present ubiquitously in neurons have been less explored. Here, we systematically examined the relationship between gain and voltage-gated ion channels in a conductance-based, tonically-active, model neuron. Changes in expression (conductance density) of voltage-gated channels increased (Ca2+ channel), reduced (K+ channels), or produced little effect (h-type channel) on gain. We found that the gain-controlling ability of channels increased exponentially with the steepness of their activation within the dynamic voltage window (voltage range associated with firing). For depolarization-activated channels, this produced a greater channel current per action potential at higher firing rates. This allowed these channels to modulate gain by contributing to firing preferentially at states of higher excitation. A finer analysis of the current-voltage relationship during tonic firing identified narrow voltage windows at which the gain-modulating channels exerted their effects. As a proof of concept, we show that h-type channels can be tuned to modulate gain by changing the steepness of their activation within the dynamic voltage window. These results show how the impact of an ion channel on gain can be predicted from the relationship between channel kinetics and the membrane potential during firing. This is potentially relevant to understanding input-output scaling in a wide class of neurons found throughout the brain and other nervous systems."
https://openalex.org/W2079606752,"STRA6 is a plasma membrane protein that mediates the transport of vitamin A, or retinol, from plasma retinol binding protein (RBP) into the cell. Mutations in human STRA6 are associated with Matthew-Wood syndrome, which is characterized by severe developmental defects. Despite the obvious importance of this protein to human health, little is known about its structure and mechanism of action. To overcome the difficulties frequently encountered with the production of membrane proteins for structural determination, STRA6 has been expressed in Pichia pastoris as a fusion to green fluorescent protein (GFP), a strategy which has been a critical first step in solving the crystal structures of several membrane proteins. STRA6-GFP was correctly targeted to the cell surface where it bound RBP. Here we report the large-scale expression, purification and characterisation of STRA6-GFP. One litre of culture, corresponding to 175 g cells, yielded about 1.5 mg of pure protein. The interaction between purified STRA6 and its ligand RBP was studied by surface plasmon resonance-based binding analysis. The interaction between STRA6 and RBP was not retinol-dependent and the binding data were consistent with a transient interaction of 1 mole RBP/mole STRA6."
https://openalex.org/W1981867200,"Objectives Because the distribution volume and mechanism of extracellular and intravascular MR contrast media differ considerably, the enhancement pattern of chronic myocardial infarction with extracellular or intravascular media might also be different. This study aims to investigate the differences in MR enhancement patterns of chronic myocardial infarction between extracellular and intravascular contrast media. Materials and Methods Twenty pigs with myocardial infarction underwent cine MRI, first pass perfusion MRI and delayed enhancement MRI with extracellular or intravascular media at four weeks after coronary occlusion. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) was determined with microsphere measurement. The infarction histopathological changes were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining and Masson's trichrome method. Results Cine MRI revealed the reduced wall thickening in chronic infarction compared with normal myocardium. Moreover, significant wall thinning in chronic infarction was observed in cine MRI. Peak first-pass signal intensity didn’t significantly differ between chronic infarction and normal myocardium no matter what kinds of contrast media. At the following delayed enhancement phase, extracellular media-enhanced signal intensity was significantly higher in chronic infarction than in normal myocardium. Conversely, intravascular media-enhanced signal intensity was almost equivalent among chronic infarction and normal myocardium. At four weeks after infarction, MBF in chronic infarction approached to that in normal myocardium. Large thick-walled vessels were detected at peri-infarction zones. The cardiomyocytes were replaced by scar tissue consisting of dilated blood vessels and discrete fibers of collagen. Conclusions Chronic infarction was characterized by the significantly reduced wall thickening and the definite wall thinning. First-pass myocardial perfusion defect was not detected in chronic infarction with two media due to the significantly recovered MBF and well-developed collateral vessels. Infarction remodeling enlarged the extracellular compartment, which was available for extracellular media but not accessible to intravascular media. Extracellular media identified chronic infarction as the hyper-enhancement; nonetheless, intravascular media didn’t provide delayed enhancement."
https://openalex.org/W2082392049,"To infect their hosts, DNA viruses must successfully initiate the expression of viral genes that control subsequent viral gene expression and manipulate the host environment. Viral genes that are immediately expressed upon infection play critical roles in the early infection process. In this study, we investigated the expression and regulation of five canonical regulatory immediate-early (IE) genes of Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus: ie0, ie1, ie2, me53, and pe38. A systematic transient gene-expression analysis revealed that these IE genes are generally transactivators, suggesting the existence of a highly interactive regulatory network. A genetic analysis using gene knockout viruses demonstrated that the expression of these IE genes was tolerant to the single deletions of activator IE genes in the early stage of infection. A network graph analysis on the regulatory relationships observed in the transient expression analysis suggested that the robustness of IE gene expression is due to the organization of the IE gene regulatory network and how each IE gene is activated. However, some regulatory relationships detected by the genetic analysis were contradictory to those observed in the transient expression analysis, especially for IE0-mediated regulation. Statistical modeling, combined with genetic analysis using knockout alleles for ie0 and ie1, showed that the repressor function of ie0 was due to the interaction between ie0 and ie1, not ie0 itself. Taken together, these systematic approaches provided insight into the topology and nature of the IE gene regulatory network."
https://openalex.org/W2093888876,"The rapid growth of Internet applications has made communication anonymity an increasingly important or even indispensable security requirement. Onion routing has been employed as an infrastructure for anonymous communication over a public network, which provides anonymous connections that are strongly resistant to both eavesdropping and traffic analysis. However, existing onion routing protocols usually exhibit poor performance due to repeated encryption operations. In this paper, we first present an improved anonymous multi-receiver identity-based encryption (AMRIBE) scheme, and an improved identity-based one-way anonymous key agreement (IBOWAKE) protocol. We then propose an efficient onion routing protocol named AIB-OR that provides provable security and strong anonymity. Our main approach is to use our improved AMRIBE scheme and improved IBOWAKE protocol in onion routing circuit construction. Compared with other onion routing protocols, AIB-OR provides high efficiency, scalability, strong anonymity and fault tolerance. Performance measurements from a prototype implementation show that our proposed AIB-OR can achieve high bandwidths and low latencies when deployed over the Internet."
https://openalex.org/W2013237249,"We investigated, in a university student population, spontaneous (non-speeded) fast and slow number-to-line mapping responses using non-symbolic (dots) and symbolic (words) stimuli. Seeking for less conventionalized responses, we used anchors 0–130, rather than the standard 0–100. Slow responses to both types of stimuli only produced linear mappings with no evidence of non-linear compression. In contrast, fast responses revealed distinct patterns of non-linear compression for dots and words. A predicted logarithmic compression was observed in fast responses to dots in the 0–130 range, but not in the reduced 0–100 range, indicating compression in proximity of the upper anchor 130, not the standard 100. Moreover, fast responses to words revealed an unexpected significant negative compression in the reduced 0–100 range, but not in the 0–130 range, indicating compression in proximity to the lower anchor 0. Results show that fast responses help revealing the fundamentally distinct nature of symbolic and non-symbolic quantity representation. Whole number words, being intrinsically mediated by cultural phenomena such as language and education, emphasize the invariance of magnitude between them—essential for linear mappings, and therefore, unlike non-symbolic (psychophysical) stimuli, yield spatial mappings that don’t seem to be influenced by the Weber-Fechner law of psychophysics. However, high levels of education (when combined with an absence of standard upper anchors) may lead fast responses to overestimate magnitude invariance on the lower end of word numerals."
