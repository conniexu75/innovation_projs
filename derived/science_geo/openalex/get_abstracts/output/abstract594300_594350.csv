The Palaeocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum was a surface warming event associated with ecological disruption that occurred about 56 million years ago. A large amount of carbon is thought to have been released during this event, but the total amount and the sources of carbon remain uncertain. This paper combines boron and carbon isotope data in an Earth system model and finds that the source of carbon was much larger than previously thought and that most of the carbon was probably released by volcanism associated with the North Atlantic Igneous Province. The study also suggests that the amplifying organic carbon–climate feedbacks did not have a prominent role in driving the event, but that enhanced burial of organic matter was important for sequestering the released carbon and accelerating the recovery of the climate system. The Palaeocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum1,2 (PETM) was a global warming event that occurred about 56 million years ago, and is commonly thought to have been driven primarily by the destabilization of carbon from surface sedimentary reservoirs such as methane hydrates3. However, it remains controversial whether such reservoirs were indeed the source of the carbon that drove the warming1,3,4,5. Resolving this issue is key to understanding the proximal cause of the warming, and to quantifying the roles of triggers versus feedbacks. Here we present boron isotope data—a proxy for seawater pH—that show that the ocean surface pH was persistently low during the PETM. We combine our pH data with a paired carbon isotope record in an Earth system model in order to reconstruct the unfolding carbon-cycle dynamics during the event6,7. We find strong evidence for a much larger (more than 10,000 petagrams)—and, on average, isotopically heavier—carbon source than considered previously8,9. This leads us to identify volcanism associated with the North Atlantic Igneous Province10,11, rather than carbon from a surface reservoir, as the main driver of the PETM. This finding implies that climate-driven amplification of organic carbon feedbacks probably played only a minor part in driving the event. However, we find that enhanced burial of organic matter seems to have been important in eventually sequestering the released carbon and accelerating the recovery of the Earth system12."
https://openalex.org/W2750586355,"Quantifying image distortions caused by strong gravitational lensing and estimating the corresponding matter distribution in lensing galaxies has been primarily performed by maximum likelihood modeling of observations. This is typically a time and resource-consuming procedure, requiring sophisticated lensing codes, several data preparation steps, and finding the maximum likelihood model parameters in a computationally expensive process with downhill optimizers. Accurate analysis of a single lens can take up to a few weeks and requires the attention of dedicated experts. Tens of thousands of new lenses are expected to be discovered with the upcoming generation of ground and space surveys, the analysis of which can be a challenging task. Here we report the use of deep convolutional neural networks to accurately estimate lensing parameters in an extremely fast and automated way, circumventing the difficulties faced by maximum likelihood methods. We also show that lens removal can be made fast and automated using Independent Component Analysis of multi-filter imaging data. Our networks can recover the parameters of the Singular Isothermal Ellipsoid density profile, commonly used to model strong lensing systems, with an accuracy comparable to the uncertainties of sophisticated models, but about ten million times faster: 100 systems in approximately 1s on a single graphics processing unit. These networks can provide a way for non-experts to obtain lensing parameter estimates for large samples of data. Our results suggest that neural networks can be a powerful and fast alternative to maximum likelihood procedures commonly used in astrophysics, radically transforming the traditional methods of data reduction and analysis."

The initiation and execution of self-paced, natural behaviors depends on intact circuits of the basal ganglia. The striatum, the main input nucleus of the basal ganglia, forms two largely separate projection pathways that are positioned to differentially control downstream basal ganglia and thalamocortical areas (Alexander and Crutcher, 1990Alexander G.E.

About half of the striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) directly target basal ganglia output structures, whereas the other half indirectly influences basal ganglia output via the external segment of the globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus (Parent et al., 1984Parent A.

Although activation of direct- and indirect-pathway SPNs can facilitate and suppress movements, respectively (Durieux et al., 2012Durieux P.F. Schiffmann S.N. de Kerchove d’Exaerde A.

Thus, not only the rate of SPN activity, but also the precise functional organization of SPN ensembles, may be important for motor control (Klaus and Plenz, 2016Klaus A. Plenz D. A low-correlation resting state of the striatum during cortical avalanches and its role in movement suppression.PLoS Biol. 2016; 14: e1002582Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Here, we studied the spatiotemporal organization of direct- and indirect-pathway SPNs during self-paced, natural behaviors using one-photon microendoscopy in freely moving mice. We recorded intracellular calcium transients in populations of up to 350 direct- or indirect-pathway SPNs selectively expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f (Chen et al., 2013Chen T.-W.

Stuber G.D. In vivo calcium imaging to illuminate neurocircuit activity dynamics underlying naturalistic behavior.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2015; 40: 238-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Calcium dynamics were recorded simultaneously with motor behavior using video and body acceleration (BA) and were analyzed using two independent methods to remove background fluctuations from somatic SPN signals. The average population activity of both direct- and indirect-pathway SPNs increased during movement, and positively correlated with total body movement during self-paced, natural behaviors in line with previous observations during learned actions (Cui et al., 2013Cui G. Jun S.B. Jin X. Pham M.D. Vogel S.S. Lovinger D.M. Costa R.M.

Neurosci. 2013; 33: 10209-10220Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Further analysis of spatial correlations between background-corrected, somatic SPN signals as a function of inter-neuronal distance revealed networks with predominantly local but also some long-range correlations in both pathways. That is, in contrast to a recent report (Barbera et al., 2016Barbera G. Liang B. Zhang L. Gerfen C.R. Culurciello E. Chen R. Li Y. Lin D.-T. Spatially compact neural clusters in the dorsal striatum encode locomotion relevant information.Neuron. 2016; 92: 202-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), SPNs did not form spatially compact clusters but instead covered spatially overlapping areas within the imaging field of view. In order to investigate if activity in SPN ensembles encodes mainly the vigor or speed of movements, or can encode specific behaviors (Barbera et al., 2016Barbera G. Liang B. Zhang L. Gerfen C.R.

Krakauer J.W. The basal ganglia: from motor commands to the control of vigor.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2016; 37: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), we clustered the behavior data using a novel approach that allowed the quantification of behavioral similarity based on video and acceleration measurements. SPNs that were active during particular behaviors showed increased overall cross-correlations (CCs) between them, and showed an increased likelihood of being nearby. Importantly, the similarity between different behaviors corresponded to the similarity between SPN ensemble patterns, independent of the speed of the movements. Accordingly, using a binary classifier, we found that the accuracy of decoding behavior from SPN ensemble activity patterns was directly related to the dissimilarity between behavioral clusters. These results identify a locally biased spatiotemporal organization of striatal activity that represents the action space, independently of movement speed, with similar actions being encoded by similar striatal ensemble activity. This organization might support further aspects of striatal function during learning and skilled motor control. To study neuronal activities in identified striatal populations of SPNs, we used microendoscopic one-photon calcium imaging of GCaMP6f (AAV5-Flex) selectively expressed in direct-pathway SPNs (D1-Cre, FK150) or indirect-pathway SPNs (D2-Cre, ER43; A2a-Cre, KG139) in mice during self-paced, natural movements in an open field arena (Figure 1A, top). Neuronal activity was monitored through a gradient index (GRIN) lens chronically implanted into the dorsolateral striatum (Figures 1B, 1C, and S1A) from up to 350 SPNs with single-cell resolution (Figures 1C–1E). Calcium dynamics were recorded simultaneously with motor behavior using video and a head-mounted three-axis accelerometer (Figure 1A, bottom). Total BA correlated with video pixel change (Δpixel, Spearman correlation ρ = 0.57 ± 0.03, n = 10 mice, p < 0.001) and the movement speed in the open field (Δxy, ρ = 0.49 ± 0.03, n = 10 mice, p < 0.01). Intracellular calcium transients of single neurons were estimated from changes in GCaMP6f fluorescence (Chen et al., 2013Chen T.-W. Wardill T.J. Sun Y. Pulver S.R. Renninger S.L. Baohan A. Schreiter E.R. Kerr R.A. Orger M.B.

Konnerth A. Imaging calcium in neurons.Neuron. 2012; 73: 862-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Because one-photon imaging suffers from stronger background signals compared to two-photon imaging due to increased out-of-focus contamination (Zhou et al., 2017Zhou, P., Resendez, S.L., Rodriguez-Romaguera, J., Jimenez, J.C., Neufeld, S.Q., Stuber, G.D., Hen, R., Kheirbek, M.A., Sabatini, B.L., Kass, R.E., et al. (2017). Efficient and accurate extraction of in vivo calcium signals from microendoscopic video data. arXiv, arXiv:1605.07266v2, https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07266.Google Scholar), we used two independent methods to correct raw, somatic fluorescence. First, manually selected somatic regions of interest (ROIs, 35–263 neurons/session, median = 120 neurons/session) were automatically adjusted using local background and baseline correction (LBC; STAR Methods) (Klaus and Plenz, 2016Klaus A. Plenz D. A low-correlation resting state of the striatum during cortical avalanches and its role in movement suppression.PLoS Biol. 2016; 14: e1002582Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and relative changes in fluorescence, ΔF/F, were extracted (Figure 1D, bottom; Figure 1E, top). To better account for background signals directly superimposed onto the neuron’s soma fluorescence and for overlapping neuronal sources (Figure 1E), we applied constrained non-negative matrix factorization for endoscopic data (CNMF-E) (Pnevmatikakis et al., 2016Pnevmatikakis E.A.

(2017). Efficient and accurate extraction of in vivo calcium signals from microendoscopic video data. arXiv, arXiv:1605.07266v2, https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07266.Google Scholar) to the same dataset (Figure 1E, bottom; Figure S1C; Movie S1). CNMF-E, which models the spatial and temporal background statistics superimposed on the neuronal signals, showed a slightly superior performance for the estimation of calcium transients from simulated ground truth data (Figure S1C). The average rate of intracellular calcium transients was similar in direct- and indirect-pathway SPNs (D1, 0.13 ± 0.02 s−1, n = 5 mice; D2/A2a, 0.17 ± 0.02 s−1, n = 5 mice; two-sample t test, t(8) = −1.38, p = 0.21; threshold crossings of the time derivative of ΔF/F > 3 SDs of baseline; STAR Methods). The average amplitude of the corresponding ΔF/F transients was also similar in direct- and indirect-pathway SPNs (D1, 9.4% ± 0.52%, n = 5 mice; D2, 10.1% ± 1.13%, n = 5 mice; two-sample t test, t(8) = −0.53, p = 0.61; LBC). Average intracellular calcium transients increased during movement initiation (Figure S1D), and positively correlated with self-paced movements in the open field for both direct- and indirect-pathway SPNs (Figures 1F and 1G), in line with previous reports on SPN activity during learned actions (Cui et al., 2013Cui G. Jun S.B. Jin X. Pham M.D. Vogel S.S. Lovinger D.M. Costa R.M.

Balanced activity in basal ganglia projection pathways is critical for contraversive movements.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 4315Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In summary, intracellular calcium transients in SPNs can be extracted reliably with single-cell resolution from endoscopic data, and show co-activation of direct- and indirect-pathway SPNs during self-paced movements (Barbera et al., 2016Barbera G. Liang B. Zhang L. Gerfen C.R. Culurciello E. Chen R. Li Y. Lin D.-T.

Commun. 2014; 5: 4315Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To study the precise spatiotemporal organization of SPN ensemble activity underlying the observed transient increases in average ΔF/F (Figure 1F), we measured CCs between SPNs at the temporal resolution of the calcium imaging (Figure 2A; bin duration, 100–143 ms; Figure S2A). SPNs in direct- and indirect-pathway populations showed low average correlations (D1, 0.08 ± 0.02, n = 5 mice; D2/A2a, 0.07 ± 0.01, n = 5 mice; comparison D1 versus D2/A2a, two-sample t test, t(8) = 0.31, p = 0.77; continuous ΔF/F time series) that were significantly larger than zero (one-tailed t test; D1, t(4) = 2.87, p = 0.023; D2/A2a, t(4) = 5.26, p = 0.003; corrected for chance-level correlations by inter-event interval shuffling of events in the ΔF/F time derivative; STAR Methods). Despite this low average CC, SPN activity showed, on average, increased CCs for nearby neurons (Figure 2B, D1 example). This monotonic decrease in CC with increasing neuron distance was found when using continuous ΔF/F (Figure 2C, top) or time series including only significant ΔF/F peak events (STAR Methods), which remove the influence of baseline fluctuations and the GCaMP6f decay on the CC measure (Figure 2C, bottom). As expected, spatially shuffled control data resulted in a flat CC-distance relationship (Figure 2C, black lines). In addition, a significant decrease in CC for increasing distances was still observed when restricting the analysis to the 20% largest events and when only neurons with a distance larger than three times the average neuron diameter were considered, thus further reducing potential crosstalk between nearby neurons (Figure S2B). In contrast to the background-corrected somatic fluorescence intensities, raw somatic fluorescence intensities were highly correlated and showed little decrease within a 100 μm radius (Figure S2C). In line with the findings from the LBC method, intracellular calcium transients extracted with CNMF-E showed a monotonic decrease in CC with increasing neuronal distance, and CC values approached shuffled data at a distance of ∼80–100 μm (Figure 2D). To further investigate that spatially localized CCs can be extracted from endoscopic data using appropriate background corrections, we tested the LBC and CNMF-E methods using simulated ground truth data (Figure S1C) with locally clustered or non-clustered activities. Indeed, the spatial profile of CCs could be recovered for both conditions (Figures S2D and S2E). Despite the local organization in activity in the direct and indirect pathway during self-paced movements, nearby SPNs in both pathways showed a wide distribution of CCs (Figures 2E and 2F). Furthermore, even SPNs far from each other can exhibit relatively high CCs (Figures 2B, S2F, and S2G). The above data suggest an organization of SPN activities that is characterized by a local bias in correlated activities but seems to be at odds with a spatially compact organization as recently described by Barbera et al., 2016Barbera G.

Spatially compact neural clusters in the dorsal striatum encode locomotion relevant information.Neuron. 2016; 92: 202-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, who reported spatially compact and non-overlapping clusters of SPNs during self-paced movements. We applied the same clustering algorithm to our data and obtained locally biased but spatially extended, i.e., not spatially compact, clusters of SPNs (Figure S2H) in line with the finding from Figure 2. We found that such spatially compact clusters were observed in the raw signals without background correction (Figures S2H–S2J), which would be expected because background contains low spatial frequencies and dominates signals in endoscopic one-photon imaging data (Zhou et al., 2017Zhou, P., Resendez, S.L., Rodriguez-Romaguera, J., Jimenez, J.C., Neufeld, S.Q., Stuber, G.D., Hen, R., Kheirbek, M.A., Sabatini, B.L., Kass, R.E., et al. (2017). Efficient and accurate extraction of in vivo calcium signals from microendoscopic video data. arXiv, arXiv:1605.07266v2, https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07266.Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that the background signals alone, i.e., the signals that were removed with CNMF-E, organized in spatially compact clusters (Figures S2H and S2J), similar to the ones reported by Barbera et al., 2016Barbera G. Liang B. Zhang L. Gerfen C.R. Culurciello E. Chen R. Li Y. Lin D.-T. Spatially compact neural clusters in the dorsal striatum encode locomotion relevant information.Neuron. 2016; 92: 202-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar. This analysis demonstrates that adequate background and baseline corrections are required to separate somatic from background signals (for further discussion, see STAR Methods). Taken together, the above results suggest that during self-paced movements, direct- and indirect-pathway SPNs form functional groups with predominantly local but also some long-range correlations. We next investigated the spatial organization of SPN activity in more detail with respect to different behaviors. To this end, we analyzed behaviors using continuous video and acceleration measurements based on the following features: (1) total BA, which captures periods of movement versus rest; (2) gravitational acceleration along the anterio-posterior axis (GAAP), which captures changes in posture, e.g., during rearing; and (3) video rotation angle (φ) to measure changes in body and head orientation (Figure 3A). The BA, GAAP, and φ time series were binned (300 ms) and discretized to obtain a low-dimensional histogram representation of each behavioral time bin (STAR Methods). These “behavioral” histograms were then used to quantify the similarity between all behavioral time bins (Figures S3A and S3B). This approach allowed us to cluster the entire range of behaviors observed during a single recording session (Figures 3A–3C) rather than focusing on a pre-defined set of behaviors. In the following, we used a similarity measure based on the so-called earth mover’s (EM) distance (Rubner et al., 2000Rubner Y. Tomasi C. Guibas L.J. The earth mover’s distance as a metric for image retrieval.Int. J. Comput. Vis. 2000; 40: 99-121Crossref Scopus (3014) Google Scholar), which compares discretized histograms of the above features and takes into account the smoothness of the animal’s movements (STAR Methods). Thus, EM similarity is zero for identical behavioral histograms and more negative for more dissimilar behavioral histograms. For example, a “left turn” or “right turn” versus “straight” is assigned a higher similarity in behavioral (i.e., action) space compared to “left turn” versus “right turn.” Behavioral clusters were obtained by affinity propagation (Frey and Dueck, 2007Frey B.J. Dueck D. Clustering by passing messages between data points.Science. 2007; 315: 972-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (5126) Google Scholar) on the EM similarity of the behavioral histograms (Figure S3A, 300 ms; STAR Methods) and showed low between-cluster and high within-cluster similarity (Figures 3B and S3D), suggesting specificity of our behavioral clustering approach. Although some clusters obtained using the above features are difficult to fully describe in terms of words and two-dimensional video, other clusters corresponded to known behaviors like “left” or “right” turn, “forward” locomotion, “rearing,” or “rest” (Figures 3C and 3D, top; Movie S2). We found that different behavioral clusters were accompanied by distinct changes in SPN activity (Figures 3D, S3G, S4A, and S4B). To test whether the changes in activity during specific behavioral clusters reflected the spatiotemporal organization identified in Figure 2, we determined action-related SPNs for each behavioral cluster that showed significant increases in activity (>3 SDs from average activity; STAR Methods). We found that SPN activity at the single-neuron level was rather action specific (Figure 3E; for neurons with significant decrease in activity, see Figure S3H). Although action-related SPNs are, by our definition, co-active during specific behavioral clusters, they do not need to be co-active at fine timescales and hence could show low zero-lag CCs (behavioral segments can last multiple seconds; Figure S4C; though see also Brody, 1999Brody C.D. Correlations without synchrony.Neural Comput. 1999; 11: 1537-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar for further discussion of this issue) and low common activity across different behavioral clusters. We therefore calculated, as done in Figure 2, the CC for the entire imaging session and found that SPNs of both pathways that were active during a specific behavior showed significantly increased CCs compared to neurons that did not show action-specific activity (Figures 3F and S3H). In addition, SPNs that were active during particular behaviors formed ensembles with a local bias yet a notable number of distant SPN pairs (Figure 3G; neurons that decreased firing rate did not show a significant local bias; see Figure S3H), which contrasts with the idea of spatially compact and non-overlapping functional clusters. This result suggests that the locally biased organization of SPN correlations identified at the general population level (Figure 2) has functional significance in terms of action-related activity. We showed above at the single-neuron level that action-related SPNs in the two pathways show high action specificity, are more correlated overall, and exhibit a local bias. While our definition of “action related” is based on a threshold for each neuron, SPNs were differently modulated during different behaviors. We therefore tested at the neuronal ensemble level if different behaviors would be encoded by distinct, non-overlapping SPN groups, or rather if behavior would be mapped more continuously in SPN activity space. To investigate this, we quantified the similarity between SPN ensemble patterns (i.e., “neuronal similarity”) for different behavioral clusters as the cross-validated (Walther et al., 2016Walther A. Nili H. Ejaz N. Alink A. Kriegeskorte N. Diedrichsen J. Reliability of dissimilarity measures for multi-voxel pattern analysis.Neuroimage. 2016; 137: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) Euclidean similarity and compared it to the similarity between behavioral clusters (i.e., “behavioral similarity”). Figure 4A shows the pairwise similarity matrices for all behavioral clusters and the corresponding SPN ensemble patterns for a single D1 session (left and right panels, respectively). In both direct- and indirect-pathway SPNs, we found a strong positive correlation between behavioral and neuronal similarity (Figure 4B, gray). Importantly, the correlation between behavioral similarity and neuronal similarity persisted when only clusters with relatively rapid movements were analyzed (Figures 4B, 4C, and 4E, red), and was abolished when neurons were spatially shuffled for each behavioral segment (Figures 4C and 4E, blue; see Figure S4D for the summary, including both move and rest behavioral clusters). The correlation between behavioral and neuronal similarity was significantly different from zero on a single-session level for the majority of recordings for the original, but not spatially shuffled, data (Figures 4C and 4E, bottom). Furthermore, when analyzing the correlation between speed similarity (BA similarity) and neuronal similarity during the behavioral clusters, the correlations were small and largely non-significant (Figures 4D, 4F, and S4D), further suggesting that speed alone did not account for the observed relationship between behavioral and neuronal similarity. We additionally confirmed that the positive correlation between behavioral and neuronal similarity remained for more general movement features using the cumulative body/head rotation angle and median-filtered, raw acceleration time series (Figure S4E). These results identify a particular relationship between the SPN ensemble activity and behaviors that extends beyond changes in average SPN activity and movement speed (Figures 1F and 1G). It argues against the encoding of different actions by compact, non-overlapping SPN ensembles, and suggests a more continuous representation, in which the degree of overlap in neuronal ensemble representation reflects the similarity/dissimilarity between behaviors. To test whether differences in the SPN ensemble activity were predictive of the difference in behavior, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) for binary classification. Instead of using the time-averaged SPN ensemble activity during each behavioral cluster, which smooths out the variability of SPN firing at shorter timescales, we performed the behavior decoding at the timescale of individual behavioral segments (Figure S4C).

https://openalex.org/W2750722402,"Summary Advantageous foraging choices benefit from an estimation of two aspects of a resource's value: its current desirability and availability. Both orbitofrontal and ventrolateral prefrontal areas contribute to updating these valuations, but their precise roles remain unclear. To explore their specializations, we trained macaque monkeys on two tasks: one required updating representations of a predicted outcome's desirability, as adjusted by selective satiation, and the other required updating representations of an outcome's availability, as indexed by its probability. We evaluated performance on both tasks in three groups of monkeys: unoperated controls and those with selective, fiber-sparing lesions of either the OFC or VLPFC. Representations that depend on the VLPFC but not the OFC play a necessary role in choices based on outcome availability; in contrast, representations that depend on the OFC but not the VLPFC play a necessary role in choices based on outcome desirability."
https://openalex.org/W2752332826,"The synaptic mechanisms of feature coding in the visual cortex are poorly understood, particularly in awake animals. The ratio between excitation (E) and inhibition (I) might be constant across stimulus space, controlling only the gain and timing of neuronal responses, or it might change, directly contributing to feature coding. Whole-cell recordings in L2/3 of awake mice revealed that the E/I ratio systematically declines with increasing stimulus contrast or size. Suppressing somatostatin (SOM) neurons enhanced the E and I underlying size tuning, explaining SOM neurons’ role in surround suppression. These data imply that contrast and size tuning result from a combination of a changing E/I ratio and the tuning of total synaptic input. Furthermore, they provide experimental support in awake animals for the “Stabilized Supralinear Network,” a model that explains diverse cortical phenomena, and suggest that a decreasing E/I ratio with increasing cortical drive could contribute to many different cortical computations."
https://openalex.org/W2751629382,"Diffuse neuromodulatory systems such as norepinephrine (NE) control brain-wide states such as arousal, but whether they control complex social behaviors more specifically is not clear. Octopamine (OA), the insect homolog of NE, is known to promote both arousal and aggression. We have performed a systematic, unbiased screen to identify OA receptor-expressing neurons (OARNs) that control aggression in Drosophila. Our results uncover a tiny population of male-specific aSP2 neurons that mediate a specific influence of OA on aggression, independent of any effect on arousal. Unexpectedly, these neurons receive convergent input from OA neurons and P1 neurons, a population of FruM+ neurons that promotes male courtship behavior. Behavioral epistasis experiments suggest that aSP2 neurons may constitute an integration node at which OAergic neuromodulation can bias the output of P1 neurons to favor aggression over inter-male courtship. These results have potential implications for thinking about the role of related neuromodulatory systems in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2753143217,"Objectives Epidemiological and experimental studies have established obesity to be an important risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA), however, the mechanisms underlying this link remains largely unknown. Here, we studied local inflammatory responses in metabolic-OA. Methods Wistar rats were fed with control diet (CD) and high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet (HCHF) for period of 8 and 16 weeks. After euthanasia, the knees were examined to assess the articular cartilage changes and inflammation in synovial membrane. Further IHC was conducted to determine the macrophage-polarization status of the synovium. In addition, CD and HCHF synovial fluid was co-cultured with bone marrow-derived macrophages to assess the effect of synovial fluid inflammation on macrophage polarisation. Results Our study showed that, obesity induced by a high-carbohydrate, high-fat (HCHF) diet is associated with spontaneous and local inflammation of the synovial membranes in rats even before the cartilage degradation. This was followed by increased synovitis and increased macrophage infiltration into the synovium and a predominant elevation of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages. In addition, bone marrow derived macrophages, cultured with synovial fluid collected from the knees of obese rats exhibited a pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage phenotype. Conclusion Our study demonstrate a strong association between obesity and a dynamic immune response locally within synovial tissues. Furthermore, we have also identified synovial resident macrophages to play a vital role in the inflammation caused by the HCHF diet. Therefore, future therapeutic strategies targeted at the synovial macrophage phenotype may be the key to break the link between obesity and OA."

Use of plant-derived agents help to prevent or delay the process of cancer progression and their combination increases the anti-cancer potential of mainstream compound. However, multidrug resistance is major cause of treatment failure in cancer patients.In this study, combination treatments of fisetin or acacetin with doxorubicin were explored for their potential synergistic effect on non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells.During this study, NSCLC model cell lines A549 and H1299 were used to determine the combinatorial effect of phytochemicals namly acacetin and fisetin with doxorubicin.The effects of individual compounds and their combination on cell viability, clonogenic potential and cell cycle progression were studied. Efflux of doxorubicin was measured by spectrofluorophotometer, whereas accumulation inside the cells was analyzed by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Expression of MDR1 was checked by semi-quantitative PCR.The results showed that the cell viability of A549 and H1299 cells were significantly decreased in time- and dose-dependent manner, although A549 cells showed more sensitivity toward doxorubicin than H1299 cells. Mostly, combination of doxorubicin showed good synergy with acacetin in both the cell lines whereas, fisetin exerted synergistic effect only at 72 h of treatment in H1299 cells. Acacetin with doxorubicin caused G2/M arrest by downregulating CDK-cyclin complex in A549 cells. Acacetin-doxorubicin combination decreased the clonogenic potential of A549 and H1299 cells upto 82% and 59%, respectively, as compared to control. Acacetin also decreased efflux of doxorubicin by 59% after 30 mins of exposure to A549 cells and further increased accumulation of doxorubicin inside the cells upto 55% in 2 h. The modulatory effect of acacetin-doxorubicin combination on doxorubicin influx and efflux was mediated through downregulation of MDR1 treansporter in NSCLC cells.These findings suggested that acacetin augments the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin at lower concentrations in lung cancer cells. Their combination leads to more retention of doxorubicin in the cells by modulating drug trasporter and thus enhances its therapeutic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2750922636,"The chronic Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are acquired stem cell neoplasms which ultimately may transform to acute myelogenous leukemia. Most recently, chronic inflammation has been described as an important factor for the development and progression of MPNs in the biological continuum from early cancer stage to the advanced myelofibrosis stage, the MPNs being described as “A Human Inflammation Model for Cancer Development“. This novel concept has been built upon clinical, experimental, genomic, immunological and not least epidemiological studies. Only a few studies have described the development of MPNs by mathematical models, and none have addressed the role of inflammation for clonal evolution and disease progression. Herein, we aim at using mathematical modelling to substantiate the concept of chronic inflammation as an important trigger and driver of MPNs.The basics of the model describe the proliferation from stem cells to mature cells including mutations of healthy stem cells to become malignant stem cells. We include a simple inflammatory coupling coping with cell death and affecting the basic model beneath. First, we describe the system without feedbacks or regulatory interactions. Next, we introduce inflammatory feedback into the system. Finally, we include other feedbacks and regulatory interactions forming the inflammatory-MPN model. Using mathematical modeling, we add further proof to the concept that chronic inflammation may be both a trigger of clonal evolution and an important driving force for MPN disease progression. Our findings support intervention at the earliest stage of cancer development to target the malignant clone and dampen concomitant inflammation."

While in vivo patch-clamp recording has recently benefited from automation, it is normally performed “blind,” meaning that throughput for sampling some genetically or morphologically defined cell types is unacceptably low. One solution to this problem is to use two-photon microscopy to target fluorescently labeled neurons. Combining this with robotic automation is difficult, however, as micropipette penetration induces tissue deformation, moving target cells from their initial location. Here we describe a platform for automated two-photon targeted patch-clamp recording, which solves this problem by making use of a closed loop visual servo algorithm. Our system keeps the target cell in focus while iteratively adjusting the pipette approach trajectory to compensate for tissue motion. We demonstrate platform validation with patch-clamp recordings from a variety of cells in the mouse neocortex and cerebellum."

Compared to the Ca2+-activated K+ channels, known as BK and SK channels, the physiological importance of Ca2+-activated Cl- channels (CaCCs) in neurons has been largely overlooked. Here we report that CaCCs coexist with BK and SK channels in inferior olivary (IO) neurons that send climbing fibers to innervate cerebellar Purkinje cells for the control of motor learning and timing. Ca2+ influx through the dendritic high-threshold voltage-gated Ca2+ channels activates CaCCs, which contribute to membrane repolarization of IO neurons. Loss of TMEM16B expression resulted in the absence of CaCCs in IO neurons, leading to markedly diminished action potential firing of IO neurons in TMEM16B knockout mice. Moreover, these mutant mice exhibited severe cerebellar motor learning deficits. Our findings thus advance the understanding of the neurophysiology of CaCCs and the ionic basis of IO neuron excitability."

Despite advances in screening programs, CRC remains as the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Oxidative stress plays an important role in the molecular mechanisms of colorectal cancer (CRC) and has been shown to be associated with Blastocystis sp., a common intestinal microorganism. In the present study, we aimed to identify a role for Blastocystis sp. in exacerbating carcinogenesis using in vivo rat model. Methylene blue staining was used to identify colonic aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and adenomas formation in infected rats whilst elevation of oxidative stress biomarker levels in the urine and serum samples were evaluated using biochemical assays. Histological changes of the intestinal mucosa were observed and a significant number of ACF was found in Blastocystis sp. infected AOM-rats compared to the AOM-controls. High levels of urinary oxidative indices including advanced oxidative protein products (AOPP) and hydrogen peroxide were observed in Blastocystis sp. infected AOM-rats compared to the uninfected AOM-rats. Our study provides evidence that Blastocystis sp. has a significant role in enhancing AOM-induced carcinogenesis by resulting damage to the intestinal epithelium and promoting oxidative damage in Blastocystis sp. infected rats."
https://openalex.org/W2751157603,"The canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway is constitutively activated in more than 90% of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases in which β-catenin contributes to CRC cell growth and survival. In contrast to the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, the non-canonical Wnt pathway can antagonize functions of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Wnt5a is a key factor in the non-canonical Wnt pathway, and it plays diverse roles in different types of cancers. It was shown that reintroducing Wnt5a into CRC cells resulted in inhibited cell proliferation and impaired cell motility. However, contradictory results were reported describing increased Wnt5a expression being associated with a poor prognosis of CRC patients. Recently, it was shown that the diverse roles of Wnt5a are due to two distinct roles of Wnt5a isoforms. However, the exact roles and functions of the Wnt5a isoforms in CRC remain largely unclear. The present study for the first time showed the ambiguous role of Wnt5a in CRC was due to the encoding of distinct roles of the various Wnt5a mRNA isoforms. A relatively high expression level of the Wnt5a-short (S) isoform transcript and a low expression level of the Wnt5a-long (L) isoform transcript were detected in CRC cell lines and specimens. In addition, high expression levels of the Wnt5a-S mRNA isoform and low expression levels of the Wnt5a-L mRNA isoform were significantly positively correlated with tumor depth of CRC patients. Furthermore, knockdown of the endogenous expression of the Wnt5a-S mRNA isoform in HCT116 cells drastically inhibited their growth ability by inducing apoptosis through induction of FASLG expression and reduction of TNFRSF11B expression. Moreover, reactivation of methylation inactivation of the Wnt5a-L mRNA isoform by treatment with 5-azacytidine (5-Aza) enhanced the siWnt5a-S isoform's ability to induce apoptosis. Finally, we showed that the simultaneous reactivation of Wnt5a-L mRNA isoform and knockdown of Wnt5a-S mRNA isoform expression enhanced siWnt5a-S isoform-induced apoptosis and siWnt5a-L isoform-regulated suppression of β-catenin expression in vitro. High expression levels of the Wnt5a-S mRNA isoform and low expression levels of the Wnt5a-L mRNA isoform were significantly positively correlated with high mRNA levels of β-catenin detection in vivo. Altogether, our study showed that, for the first time, different Wnt5a mRNA isoforms play distinct roles in CRC and can be used as novel prognostic markers for CRC in the future."

All of them scored well above average in spatial perspective taking ability and performed the task with their dominant hand. Two groups of novices, four men and four women in each group, had to place a small object in a precise order on the centre of five targets on a Real-world Action Field (RAF), as swiftly as possible and as precisely as possible, using a tool or not (control). Each individual session consisted of four visual display conditions. The order of conditions was counterbalanced between individuals and sessions. Subjects looked at what their hands were doing 1) directly in front of them (“natural” top-down view) 2) in top-down 2D fisheye view 3) in top-down undistorted 2D view or 4) in 3D stereoscopic top-down view (head-mounted OCULUS DK 2). It was made sure that object movements in all image conditions matched the real-world movements in time and space. One group was looking at the 2D images with the monitor positioned sideways (sub-optimal); the other group was looking at the monitor placed straight ahead of them (near-optimal). All image viewing conditions had significantly detrimental effects on time (seconds) and precision (pixels) of task execution when compared with “natural” direct viewing. More importantly, we find significant trade-offs between time and precision between and within groups, and significant interactions between viewing conditions and manipulation conditions. The results shed new light on controversial findings relative to visual display effects on eye-hand coordination, and lead to conclude that differences in camera systems and adaptive strategies of novices are likely to explain these."

In this study, five dominant fungal strains were isolated from an aged lindane polluted site, they were all mixed (100 mg each) together with pent mushroom compost (SMC) and applied to lindane polluted soil (5 kg) at 10, 20, 30, 40% and control 0% (soil with no treatment), these were used to grow M. maximus Jacq for 3 months. To establish lindane degradation, deductions such as Degradation rate (K1), Half-life (t1/2) and Degradation efficiency (DE) were made based on the analyzed lindane concentrations before and after the experiment. We also tested the presence and expressions of phosphoesterases (mpd and opd-A) and catechol 1,2-dioxygenases (efk2 and efk4) genes in the strains. The stains were identified as Aspergillus niger (KY693970); Talaromyces atroroseus (KY488464), Talaromyces purpurogenus (KY488468), Yarrowia lipolytica (KY488469) and Aspergillus flavus (KY693973) through morphological and molecular methods. Combined rhizospheric action of M. maximus and fungi speed up lindane degradation rate, initially detected lindane concentration of 45 mg/kg was reduced to 11.26, 9.34 and 11.23 mg/kg in 20, 30 and 40% treatments respectively making 79.76, 85.93 and 88.67% degradation efficiencies. K1 of 1.29 was recorded in control while higher K1 of 1.60, 1.96 and 2.18 /day were recorded in 20, 30 and 40% treatments respectively. The best t1/2 of 0.32 and 0.35 /day were recorded in 40 and 30% compared to control (0.54 /day). All the strains were also affirmed to possess the tested genes; opd was overexpressed in all the strains except KY693973 while mpd was overexpressed in KY693970, KY488464 but moderately expressed in KY488468, KY488469 and KY693973. However, efk genes were under-expressed in most of the strains except KY488469 and KY693973 which showed moderate expression of efk4. This work suggests that the synergistic association of the identified rhizospheric fungi and M. maximus roots could be used to remove lindane in soil at a limited time period and this combination could be used at large scale."

The examiners were calibrated and dental visits were measured categorically as 1- Less than 1 year, 2- One to two years, 3 - Three years or more, 4- I have never visited the dentist. Based on the literature we dichotomized the outcome in two groups: response 1 plus 2 against response 3 plus 4. Then, Multilevel Poisson Regression (MPR) was used to estimate the prevalence ratios of last dental visit three years or had never been to a dentist by adolescents compared with those who had visited the dentist within the past two years, with contextual variables as the distal level; sociodemographic variables, mesial; and individual variables, proximal level.A high percentage of adolescents (84.9%) reported visiting the dentist in the last 2 years. Whereas, 626 (11.6%) had not visited the dentist for over 3 years and 188 (3.4%) had never been.

https://openalex.org/W2751709744,"Dexamethasone (DEX) can reduce fibrous tissue growth as well as loss of residual hearing which may occur after cochlear implantation. Little is known about the effect of local inner ear DEX treatment on the spiral ganglion neurons (SGN), which are the target of the electrical stimulation with a cochlear implant (CI). Three different clinically relevant strategies of DEX-delivery into the inner ear were used. DEX was either eluted from the electrode carriers’ silicone, released from a reservoir by passive diffusion, or actively applied using a pump based system. The effect of the locally applied DEX on SGN density, size and function was evaluated. DEX did not affect the SGN density compared to the relevant control groups. Simultaneously applied with chronic electrical stimulation (ES), DEX increased the neuroprotective effect of ES in the basal region and the hearing threshold tended to decrease. The EABR thresholds did not correlate with the relevant SGN density. When correlating the SGN number with fibrosis, no dependency was observed. DEX concentrations as applied in these animal models are safe for inner ear delivery in terms of their effect on SGN density. Additionally, DEX tends to improve the neuroprotective effect of chronic electrical stimulation by increasing the number of surviving neurons. This is an important finding in regard to clinical applications of DEX for local treatment of the inner ear in view of cochlear implantation and other applications."
https://openalex.org/W2753857511,"There are great opportunities in the manipulation of bacterial mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels for specific and targeted drug delivery purposes. Recent research has shown that these ion channels have the potential to be converted into nanovalves through clever use of magnetic nanoparticles and magnetic fields. Using a combination of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the finite element (FE) modelling, this study investigates the theoretical feasibility of opening the MscL channel (MS channel of large conductance of E. coli) by applying mechanical force directly to its N-terminus. This region has already been reported to function as a major mechanosensor in this channel. The stress-strain behaviour of each MscL helix was obtained using all atom MD simulations. Using the same method, we simulated two models, the wild-type (WT) MscL and the G22N mutant MscL, both embedded in a POPE lipid bilayer. In addition to indicating the main interacting residues at the hydrophobic pore, their pairwise interaction energies were monitored during the channel gating. We implemented these inputs into our FE model of MscL using curve-fitting codes and continuum mechanics equations. In the FE model, the channel could be fully opened via pulling directly on the N-terminus and bottom of TM1 by mutating dominant van der Waals interactions in the channel pore; otherwise the stress generated on the channel protein can irreversibly unravel the N-secondary structure. This is a significant finding suggesting that applying force in this manner is sufficient to open an MscL nanovalve delivering various drugs used, for example, in cancer chemotherapy. More importantly, the FE model indicates that to fully operate an MscL nanovalve by pulling directly on the N-terminus and bottom of TM1, gain-of-function (GOF) mutants (e.g., G22N MscL) would have to be employed rather than the WT MscL channel."

We conducted a cluster-randomized trial of an intervention to integrate CHWs with ‘Option B+’ PMTCT services in Shinyanga Region, Tanzania. Methods The intervention was implemented for 11 months and included four integrated components: 1) formal linkage of CHWs to health facilities; 2) CHW-led antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence counseling; 3) loss to follow-up tracing by CHWs; and 4) distribution of Action Birth Cards (ABCs), a birth planning tool. We cluster-randomized 32 facilities offering PMTCT services, within strata of size, to the intervention (n = 15) or comparison (standard of care, n = 17) groups. Intervention effectiveness was determined with a difference-in-differences strategy based on clinical and pharmacy data from HIV-infected postpartum women at baseline (births in 2014) and endline (births April-Oct 2015). The primary outcome was retention in care between 60 and 120 days postpartum. Secondary outcomes included ART initiation, timing of ART initiation (as measured by week of gestation), and ART adherence 90 days postpartum, measured using the medication possession ratio (MPR≥95%). Results Intervention and comparison facilities were similar at baseline. Data were collected from 1,152 and 678 mother-infant pairs at baseline and endline, respectively. There were no significant differences in retention in care, ART initiation, or timing of ART initiation between the intervention and control groups. Adherence (MPR≥95%) at 90 days postpartum was 11.3 percentage points higher in the intervention group in ITT analyses (95% CI: -0.7, 23.3, p = 0.06), though this effect was attenuated after adjusting for baseline imbalance (9.5 percentage points, 95% CI: -2.9, 22.0, p = 0.13). Among only sites that had the greatest fidelity to the intervention, however, we found a stronger effect on adherence (13.6 percentage points, 95% CI: 2.5, 24.6). Conclusions Despite being feasible and acceptable, the CHW-based intervention did not have strong effects on most PMTCT indicators. CHW involvement in PMTCT programs may improve ART adherence among HIV-infected postpartum women, however, and success appears heavily dependent on program implementation.

It is necessary to develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for HCC to improve its prognosis. Lactosome is a core-shell-type polymeric micelle, and enclosing labeling or anticancer agents into this micelle enables drug delivery. In this study, we investigated the diagnostic and therapeutic efficacies of indocyanine green (ICG)-loaded lactosome for near-infrared fluorescence (NIF) imaging and photodynamic therapy (PDT) for HCC. Methods The human HCC cell line HuH-7 was treated with ICG or ICG-lactosome, followed by PDT, and the cell viabilities were measured (in vitro PDT efficiency). For NIF imaging, HuH-7 cells were subcutaneously transplanted into BALB/c nude mice, followed by intravenous administration of ICG or ICG-lactosome. The transplanted animals were treated with PDT, and the antineoplastic effects were analyzed (in vivo PDT efficiency). Results PDT had toxic effects on HuH-7 cells treated with ICG-lactosome, but not ICG alone. NIF imaging revealed that the fluorescence of tumor areas in ICG-lactosome-treated animals was higher than that of contralateral regions at 24 h after injection and thereafter. PDT exerted immediate and continuous phototoxic effects in the transplanted mice treated with ICG-lactosome. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that ICG-lactosome accumulated in xenograft tumors, and that PDT had antineoplastic effects on these malignant implants. NIF imaging and PDT with ICG-lactosome could be useful diagnostic and/or therapeutic strategies for HCC."

Recently, the activity of Olive Leaf Extracts (OLE) was demonstrated against Acanthamoeba species. However, the molecules involved in this activity were not identified and/or evaluated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the activity of the main molecules which are present in OLE and secondly to study their mechanism of action in Acanthamoeba. Among the tested molecules, the observed activities ranged from an IC50 of 6.59 in the case of apigenine to an IC50 > 100 μg/ml for other molecules. After that, elucidation of the mechanism of action of these molecules was evaluated by the detection of changes in the phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure, the permeability of the plasma membrane, the mitochondrial membrane potential and the ATP levels in the treated cells. Vanillic, syringic and ursolic acids induced the higher permeabilization of the plasma membrane. Nevertheless, the mitochondrial membrane was altered by all tested molecules which were also able to decrease the ATP levels to less than 50% in IC90 treated cells after 24 h. Therefore, all the molecules tested in this study could be considered as a future therapeutic alternative against Acanthamoeba spp. Further studies are needed in order to establish the true potential of these molecules against these emerging opportunistic pathogenic protozoa."

The primary aim of this study was to compare plantar pressures at baseline and three and six months later in participants with chronic diabetes-related foot ulcers (cases) to participants without foot ulcers (controls). Methods Standardised protocols were used to measure mean peak plantar pressure and pressure-time integral at 10 plantar foot sites (the hallux, toes, metatarsals 1 to 5, mid-foot, medial heel and lateral heel) during barefoot walking. Measurements were performed at three study visits: baseline, three and six months. Linear mixed effects random-intercept models were utilised to assess whether plantar pressures differed between cases and controls after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, neuropathy status and follow-up time. Standardised mean differences (Cohen’s d) were used to measure effect size. Results Twenty-one cases and 69 controls started the study and 16 cases and 63 controls completed the study. Cases had a higher mean peak plantar pressure at several foot sites including the toes (p = 0.005, Cohen’s d = 0.36) and mid-foot (p = 0.01, d = 0.36) and a higher pressure-time integral at the hallux (p<0.001, d = 0.42), metatarsal 1 (p = 0.02, d = 0.33) and mid-foot (p = 0.04, d = 0.64) compared to controls throughout follow-up. A reduction in pressure-time integral at multiple plantar sites over time was detected in all participants (p<0.05, respectively). Conclusions Plantar pressures assessed during gait are higher in diabetes patients with chronic foot ulcers than controls at several plantar sites throughout prolonged follow-up. Long term offloading is needed in diabetes patients with diabetes-related foot ulcers to facilitate ulcer healing."
https://openalex.org/W2750702355,"Climate change and other anthropogenic stressors are converging on coastal ecosystems worldwide. Understanding how these stressors interact to affect ecosystem structure and function has immediate implications for coastal planning, however few studies quantify stressor interactions. We examined past and potential future interactions between two leading stressors on New England salt marshes: sea-level rise and marsh crab (Sesarma reticulatum) grazing driven low marsh die-off. Geospatial analyses reveal that crab-driven die-off has led to an order of magnitude more marsh loss than sea-level rise between 2005 and 2013. However, field transplant experimental results suggest that sea-level rise will facilitate crab expansion into higher elevation marsh platforms by inundating and gradually softening now-tough high marsh peat, exposing large areas to crab-driven die-off. Taking interactive effects of marsh softening and concomitant overgrazing into account, we estimate that even modest levels of sea-level rise will lead to levels of salt marsh habitat loss that are 3x greater than the additive effects of sea-level rise and crab-driven die-off would predict. These findings highlight the importance of multiple stressor studies in enhancing mechanistic understanding of ecosystem vulnerabilities to future stress scenarios and encourage managers to focus on ameliorating local stressors to break detrimental synergisms, reduce future ecosystem loss, and enhance ecosystem resilience to global change."
https://openalex.org/W2752990414,"The metabolic perturbation caused by calorie restriction enhances muscle repair by playing a critical role in regulating satellite cell availability and activity in the muscles of young and old mice. To clarify the underlying mechanisms we asked whether myoblast replication and differentiation are affected by metformin, a calorie restriction-mimicking drug. C2C12, a mouse myoblast cell line, readily differentiate in vitro and fuse to form myotubes. However, when incubated with metformin, C2C12 slow their replication and do not differentiate. Interestingly, lower doses of metformin promote myogenic differentiation. We observe that metformin treatment modulates the expression of cyclins and cyclin inhibitors thereby inducing a cell cycle perturbation that causes a delay in the G2/M transition. The effect of metformin treatment is reversible since after drug withdrawal, myoblasts can re-enter the cell cycle and/or differentiate, depending on culture conditions. Myoblasts cultured under metformin treatment fail to up-regulate MyoD and p21cip1, a key step in cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation. Although the details of the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of the drug on myoblasts still need to be clarified, we propose that metformin negatively affects myogenic differentiation by inhibiting irreversible exit from the cell cycle through reduction of MyoD and p21cip1 levels."

Furthermore, changes in the microbial community associated with increased seawater temperatures can cause opportunistic infections, coral disease and death. Interactions between soft corals and their associated microbes are not well understood. The species Scleronephthya gracillimum is distributed in tropical to temperate zones in coral assemblages along the Kuroshio Current region. In this study we collected S. gracillimum from various sites at different latitudes, and compared composition of their bacterial communities using Next Generation Sequencing. Coral samples from six geographically distinct areas (two sites each in Taiwan, Japan, and Korea) had considerable variation in their associated bacterial communities and diversity. Endozoicimonaceae was the dominant group in corals from Korea and Japan, whereas Mycoplasma was dominant in corals from Taiwan corals. Interestingly, the latter corals had lower relative abundance of Endozoicimonaceae, but greater diversity. These biogeographic differences in bacterial composition may have been due to varying environmental conditions among study locations, or because of host responses to prevailing environmental conditions. This study provided a baseline for future studies of soft coral microbiomes, and assessment of functions of host metabolites and soft coral holobionts."
https://openalex.org/W2753899256,"Angiogenesis is a highly coordinated, extremely complex process orchestrated by multiple signaling molecules and blood flow conditions. While sprouting mode of angiogenesis is very well investigated, the molecular mechanisms underlying intussusception, the second mode of angiogenesis, remain largely unclear. In the current study two molecules involved in vascular growth and differentiation, namely endoglin (ENG/CD105) and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II (COUP-TFII) were examined to unravel their specific roles in angiogenesis. Down- respectively up-regulation of both molecules tightly correlates with intussusceptive microvascular growth. Upon ENG inhibition in chicken embryo model, formation of irregular capillary meshwork accompanied by increased expression of COUP-TFII could be observed. This dynamic expression pattern of ENG and COUP-TFII during vascular development and remodeling correlated with formation of pillars and progression of intussusceptive angiogenesis. Similar findings could be observed in mammalian model of acute rat Thy1.1 glomerulonephritis, which was induced by intravenous injection of anti-Thy1 antibody and has shown upregulation of COUP-TFII in initial phase of intussusception, while ENG expression was not disturbed compared to the controls but decreased over the time of pillar formation. In this study, we have shown that ENG inhibition and at the same time up-regulation of COUP-TFII expression promotes intussusceptive angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2750845740,"Background Visceral adiposity is a risk factor for many chronic diseases. Existing methods to quantify visceral adipose tissue volume using computed tomographic (CT) images often use a single slice, are manual, and are time consuming, making them impractical for large population studies. We developed and validated a method to accurately, rapidly, and robustly measure visceral adipose tissue volume using CT images. Methods In-house software, Medical Executable for the Efficient and Robust Quantification of Adipose Tissue (MEERQAT), was developed to calculate visceral adipose tissue volume using a series of CT images within a manually identified region of interest. To distinguish visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue, ellipses are drawn through the rectus abdominis and transverse abdominis using manual and automatic processes. Visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue volumes are calculated by counting the numbers of voxels corresponding to adipose tissue in the region of interest. MEERQAT’s ellipse interpolation method was validated by comparing visceral adipose volume from 10 patients’ CT scans with corresponding results from manually delineated scans. Accuracy of visceral adipose quantification was tested using a phantom consisting of animal fat and tissues. Robustness of the method was tested by determining intra-observer and inter-observer coefficients of variation (CV). Results The mean difference in visceral adipose tissue volume between manual and elliptical delineation methods was -0.54 ± 4.81%. In the phantom, our measurement differed from the known adipose volume by ≤ 7.5% for all scanning parameters. Mean inter-observer CV for visceral adipose tissue volume was 0.085, and mean intra-observer CV for visceral adipose tissue volume was 0.059. Conclusions We have developed and validated a robust method of accurately and quickly determining visceral adipose tissue volume in any defined region of interest using CT imaging."
https://openalex.org/W2751330417,"Background Understanding stakeholders’ (parents’, communities’ and health workers’) perspectives of communication about childhood vaccination, including their preferences for its format, delivery and content, is an important step towards designing better communication strategies and ensuring more informed parents. Our objectives were to explore stakeholders’ views, experiences and preferences for childhood vaccination communication in Cameroon. Methods In 2014, in the Central and North West Regions of Cameron, we gathered qualitative data for our case study using the following methods: semi structured interviews; observations and informal conversations during routine immunization clinics and three rounds of the National Polio Immunization Campaign; document analysis of reports and mass media communications about vaccination; and a survey of parents. We conducted a thematic analysis of the qualitative data to identify themes relating to views, experiences and perceptions of vaccination information and its delivery. Survey data were analysed using simple descriptive statistics. Results All of the parents interviewed felt that vaccinating their child was important, and trusted the information provided by health workers. However, many parents wanted more information. Parents did not always feel that they could ask questions during vaccination appointments. All participants felt that health workers and vaccination clinics were important sources of information. Social mobilisation activities such as door-to-door visits and announcements during religious services were important and accepted ways of communicating information, especially during vaccination campaigns. Information communicated through mass media and text messages was also seen as important. In general, stakeholders believed that more consistent messaging about routine vaccination through community channels would be helpful to remind parents of the importance of routine vaccination during ongoing rounds of vaccination campaigns against polio. Conclusions This study confirms that parents regard information about childhood vaccination as important, but that health services need to be organized in ways that prioritize and facilitate communication, particularly about routine vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2750729479,"Regular physical activity (PA) and the avoidance of prolonged sitting are essential for children's healthy growth, and for the physical and mental wellbeing of both children and adults. In the context of exercise, music may promote behavioral change through increased exercise adherence and participation. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a movement-to-music video program could reduce sedentary behavior (SB) and increase PA in mother-child pairs in the home environment. A randomized controlled trial was conducted in the Pirkanmaa region, Finland, in 2014-2016. The participants consisted of 228 mother-child pairs (child age 5-7 years). The primary outcomes of interest were tri-axial accelerometer-derived SB and PA, which were measured in weeks one (baseline), two, and eight in both the intervention and control groups. Further, the mothers and children in the intervention group used a movement-to-music video program from the beginning of week two to the end of week eight. Secondary outcomes included self-reported screen time. The statistical methods employed comprised an intention-to-treat and linear mixed effects model design. No statistically significant differences between groups were found in primary or secondary outcomes. Among the children in the control group, light PA decreased significantly over time and screen time increased from 89 (standard deviation, SD 37) to 99 (SD 41) min/d. Among mothers and children in the intervention group, no statistical differences were found. In supplementary analysis, the children who stayed at home instead of attending daycare/preschool had on average 25 (95% confidence interval, CI 19-30) min/d more sedentary time and 11 (95% CI 8-14) min/d less moderate-to-vigorous PA than those who were at daycare/preschool. The higher body mass index of mothers was related with 5 (95% CI 2-7) min/d more sedentary time and 1 (95% CI 0-2) min/d less moderate-to-vigorous PA. The movement-to-music video program did not change the objectively measured SB or PA of the mother-child pairs. However, mothers and children seemed to be more sedentary at home, and therefore interventions for decreasing SB and increasing PA should be targeted in the home environment."
https://openalex.org/W2751861824,"Succession in bloom-forming cyanobacteria belonging to distant functional groups in freshwater ecosystems is currently an undescribed phenomenon. However in the Hammam Debagh reservoir (Algeria), P. rubescens and Microcystis sp. co-occur and sometimes proliferate. With the aim of identifying the main factors and processes involved in this unusual cohabitation, water samples were collected monthly from February 2013 to June 2015 at the subsurface at four sampling stations and along the entire water column at one sampling station. In addition, the composition of the cyanobacterial communities was estimated by Illumina sequencing of a 16S rRNA gene fragment from samples collected over one year (October 2013-November 2014). This molecular approach showed that the Hammam Debagh reservoir displays high species richness (89 species) but very low diversity due to the high dominance of Microcystis in this community. Furthermore, it appears that Planktothrix rubescens and Microcystis sp. coexisted (from September to January) but proliferated alternately (Spring 2015 for P. rubescens and Spring 2014 and Autumn 2014/2015 for Microcystis). The main factors and processes explaining these changes in bloom-forming species seem to be related to the variation in the depth of the lake during the mixing period and to the water temperatures during the winter prior to the bloom season in spring."
https://openalex.org/W2753478007,"Similar to drugs of abuse, the hedonic value of food is mediated, at least in part, by the mesostriatal dopamine (DA) system. Prolonged intake of either high calorie diets or drugs of abuse both lead to a blunting of the DA system. Most studies have focused on DAergic alterations in the striatum, but little is known about the effects of high calorie diets on ventral tegmental area (VTA) DA neurons. Since high calorie diets produce addictive-like DAergic adaptations, it is possible these diets may increase addiction susceptibility. However, high calorie diets consistently reduce psychostimulant intake and conditioned place preference in rodents. In contrast, high calorie diets can increase or decrease ethanol drinking, but it is not known how a junk food diet (cafeteria diet) affects ethanol drinking. In the current study, we administered a cafeteria diet consisting of bacon, potato chips, cheesecake, cookies, breakfast cereals, marshmallows, and chocolate candies to male Wistar rats for 3–4 weeks, producing an obese phenotype. Prior cafeteria diet feeding reduced homecage ethanol drinking over 2 weeks of testing, and transiently reduced sucrose and chow intake. Importantly, cafeteria diet had no effect on ethanol metabolism rate or blood ethanol concentrations following 2g/kg ethanol administration. In midbrain slices, we showed that cafeteria diet feeding enhances DA D2 receptor (D2R) autoinhibition in VTA DA neurons. These results show that junk food diet-induced obesity reduces ethanol drinking, and suggest that increased D2R autoinhibition in the VTA may contribute to deficits in DAergic signaling and reward hypofunction observed with obesity."

CNS angiogenesis and blood-brain barrier (BBB) formation are coupled, as each process requires Wnt/β-catenin signaling in endothelial cells. The BBB enables neural function by regulating the extracellular milieu and protects the CNS from toxins and pathogens. Impairment of the BBB may lead to seizures and is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases and retinopathies. Among the cell types in the neurovascular unit, endothelial cells have a key role in BBB function. Wnt/β-catenin signaling (also known as canonical Wnt signaling) is mediated by receptors of the frizzled (FZD) family and co-receptor LRP5 or LRP6, which transduce signals across the plasma membrane. Among the 19 Wnts, WNT7A and WNT7B have important functions as inducers of CNS angiogenesis and barriergenesis. In cell-based assays, various FZDs and LRP5/6 mediate only moderate pathway activation in response to WNT7A and WNT7B; however, a recent report shows that the duo of two membrane-associated proteins, GPR124 and RECK, enhances signaling dramatically (Vanhollebeke et al., 2015Vanhollebeke B.

Intriguingly, signaling induced by any of the other 17 WNTs is not co-activated by GRP124 (an orphan GPCR) and RECK (a GPI-anchored protein), highlighting poorly understood roles of the co-activators in determining ligand-specific responses. Both GPR124 and RECK are implicated in CNS vascular biology and canonical signaling in vertebrate model organisms (Posokhova et al., 2015Posokhova E. Shukla A. Seaman S. Volate S. Hilton M.B. Wu B.

Recent studies from several teams converge on a model in which both GPR124 and RECK are linked to CNS vascular development and WNT/β-catenin signaling (Noda et al., 2016Noda M. Vallon M. Kuo C.J. Cancer Sci. 2016; 107: 576-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Embryonic Gpr124 mutant phenotypes include forebrain hemorrhages and angiogenesis defects in the cortex, ganglionic eminence, and spinal cord. In adult mice, endothelial cell-specific Gpr124 gene inactivation causes BBB integrity defects in a stroke model and glioblastoma (Chang et al., 2017Chang J. Mancuso M.R. Maier C. Liang X. Yuki K. Yang L. Kwong J.W. Wang J. Rao V. Vallon M. et al.Nat. Med. 2017; 23: 450-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Inactivation of Gpr124 can be partially rescued by induction of stabilized β-catenin (Zhou and Nathans, 2014Zhou Y. Nathans J. Dev.

However, whether mammalian RECK functions in WNT7/β-catenin signaling is unclear. If RECK indeed functions together with GPR124 in the CNS vasculature, one would expect to observe (1) characteristic phenotypes in Reck mutant mice in the same CNS regions that show defects in Gpr124 mutant mice, (2) altered Wnt signaling levels in the CNS vasculature, (3) genetic interactions in compound mutant mice with reduced Reck and Wnt7 gene dosage or Reck and Gpr124 gene dosage, and (4) rescue of Reck mutant phenotypes upon expression of stabilized β-catenin in endothelial cells.

Yamamoto M. Morioka Y. Ogawa S. Matsuzaki T. Noda M. Sci. Rep. 2015; 5: 17860Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Reck deletion in endothelial cells causes CNS angiogenesis defects that are highly similar to the phenotypes previously reported in Gpr124 mutant mice, including moderate hemorrhages in the forebrain; glomeruloid vascular malformations in the cortex, medial ganglionic eminence, and spinal cord; and increased macrophage infiltration into these areas.

Two findings provide strong evidence that these phenotypes are due to impaired β-catenin-dependent signaling. First, a new conditional reporter for Wnt signaling is used to show that reporter activity in Reck mutant endothelial cells is indeed reduced. Second, impaired angiogenesis and hemorrhages are substantially rescued by expression of stabilized β-catenin in endothelial cells. The most potent co-activation of WNT7/β-catenin signaling in cell-based assays is observed when GPR124 and RECK are both present (Vanhollebeke et al., 2015Vanhollebeke B. Stone O.A. Bostaille N. Cho C. Zhou Y. Maquet E. Gauquier A. Cabochette P. Fukuhara S. Mochizuki N. et al.eLife. 2015; 4: 4Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In accordance with this finding, Cho et al., 2017Cho C. Smallwood P.M. Nathans J. Neuron. 2017; 95 (this issue): 1056-1073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar show that forebrain and spinal cord hemorrhages are more severe in compound mutant mice with combined endothelial cell-specific loss of Gpr124 and Reck. Reduction of Reck in mice lacking three out of four WNT7 alleles results in a marked decrease of vascular density in all examined CNS regions. Canonical signaling in endothelial cells can be initiated by the ligand Norrin (gene symbol Ndp), which has critical functions in retinal angiogenesis and blood-retina barrier formation. In some CNS structures, e.g., in the developing hindbrain, Wnts and Norrin act redundantly. Norrin is a potent canonical ligand specifically for FZD4, hence the term Norrin/Frizzled4 signaling. Unlike WNT7/β-catenin signaling, NDP/FZD4 signaling is not amplified by GPR124 or RECK in cell-based assays. Instead, NDP/FZD4 signaling is boosted by a distinct receptor complex component of the tetraspanin family, TSPAN12 (Lai et al., 2017Lai M.B. Zhang C. Shi J. Johnson V. Khandan L. McVey J. Klymkowsky M.W. Chen Z. Junge H.J. Cell Rep. 2017; 19: 2809-2822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (Figure 1). In contrast to single mutant mice, compound mutant mice in which Gpr124 and Ndp are both inactivated show severe embryonic hindbrain angiogenesis defects and widespread postnatal BBB defects (Zhou and Nathans, 2014Zhou Y. Nathans J. Dev. Cell. 2014; 31: 248-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Cho et al., 2017Cho C. Smallwood P.M. Nathans J. Neuron. 2017; 95 (this issue): 1056-1073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar show that Reck and Ndp engage in similar genetic interactions as Gpr124 and Ndp, resulting in impaired embryonic hindbrain angiogenesis and widespread BBB defects in the postnatal brain. Together, the compelling genetic experiments in this study and the cell-based experiments reported by Vanhollebeke et al., 2015Vanhollebeke B. Stone O.A. Bostaille N. Cho C. Zhou Y. Maquet E. Gauquier A. Cabochette P. Fukuhara S. Mochizuki N. et al.eLife. 2015; 4: 4Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar show that GPR124 and RECK are both required to fully co-activate WNT7/β-catenin signaling. Similar functions have been reported in zebrafish (Ulrich et al., 2016Ulrich F. Carretero-Ortega J. Menéndez J. Narvaez C. Sun B. Lancaster E. Pershad V. Trzaska S. Véliz E.

Cabochette P. Fukuhara S. Mochizuki N. et al.eLife. 2015; 4: 4Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). With the functional interactions of GPR124, RECK, and WNT7 established, Cho et al., 2017Cho C. Smallwood P.M. Nathans J. Neuron. 2017; 95 (this issue): 1056-1073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar turn to an analysis of domain functions (using a reporter cell line) and protein-protein interactions. In GPR124, the N-terminal LRR (leucine-rich repeat) and Ig (immunoglobulin) domains are required for signaling, whereas HormR (hormone receptor) and GAIN (putative GPCR autoproteolysis inducing) domains are largely dispensable (see also Posokhova et al., 2015Posokhova E. Shukla A. Seaman S. Volate S. Hilton M.B. Wu B. Morris H. Swing D.A. Zhou M. Zudaire E. et al.Cell Rep. 2015; 10: 123-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In the case of RECK, full co-activator activity depends on multiple domains; however, removing the N-terminal CC1-5 domains (five tandem copies of a domain with a di-cysteine motif) causes the most severe signaling defects. Cell surface binding assays using alkaline phosphatase GPR124 (LRR-Ig)-COMP-AP and RECK(CC1-5) COMP-AP probes reveal GPR124/RECK binding. The alkaline phosphatase (AP) tag allows probe detection on the cell surface; the COMP domain pentamerizes and therefore increases the avidity of the probe. In GRP124, the N-terminal LRR and Ig domains are essential for RECK-probe binding. Thus, GPR124 LRR and Ig domains are required for both RECK-probe binding and co-activation of WNT7 signaling. With the caveat that the LRR-Ig unit may engage in additional protein interactions, the results point to a role of the GPR124/RECK interaction in signaling. And, with the caveat that full-length RECK may use a second interface to bind to full-length GPR124, the results indicate that the LRR-Ig domains are necessary for the GPR124/RECK interaction. Although the HormR domain deletions have only moderate defects in GPR124-mediated co-activation of WNT7 signaling, the HormR domain deletion shows strong defects in RECK-probe binding. This observation may be explained by steric hindrance. Similar experiments using the GPR124(LRR-Ig) COMP-AP probe reveal that the RECK CC1-5 domains are not only important for co-activation in signaling assays, but also for GPR124-probe binding. Yet, the congruency with respect to which RECK domains are required for binding and signaling is not complete, suggesting that RECK engages in a network of additional protein interactions. Importantly, Cho et al., 2017Cho C. Smallwood P.M. Nathans J. Neuron. 2017; 95 (this issue): 1056-1073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar demonstrate the direct interaction of RECK CC1 and GPR124(LRR-Ig) in a cell-free assay and identify a conserved binding interface for GPR124/RECK binding. Mutations in this interface in the RECK CC1 domain impair signaling in a reporter cell line and are then introduced into the mouse genome to generate the ReckCr allele. On a genetic background sensitized by heterologous loss of Gpr124, ReckCr mutant mice display angiogenesis defects in the ganglionic eminence. These data are consistent with a requirement for RECK/GPR124 binding in WNT7 signaling and CNS angiogenesis, but they also show that RECK has additional functions in this context, as the complete inactivation of Reck (e.g., using exon1 deletion) causes considerably more severe defects. Cho et al., 2017Cho C. Smallwood P.M. Nathans J. Neuron. 2017; 95 (this issue): 1056-1073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar go on to demonstrate that GPR124 and RECK engage in interactions with additional components of WNT/FZD complexes. Using a second set of AP probes, which do not harbor a COMP domain for oligomerization and that therefore have decreased avidity (RECK(CC1-5)-AP and GPR124(LRR-Ig)-AP probes), they show that neither probe detects the respective binding partner or FZD4 in cell surface binding assays. However, binding of each low-avidity probe is strikingly increased when GPR124 and FZD4, or RECK (enhanced in the condition RECK + FZD4), are displayed in the presence of WNT7A or WNT7B (binding is further increased with LRP5 present). This result is important, because it is not clear whether GPR124 and RECK constitute an autonomous signaling complex or assemble into the Wnt receptor complex. The data support a model in which RECK and GPR124 associate with the Wnt receptor complex in a ligand-dependent manner. Is this effect a consequence of interactions of each probe with the ligand and other components? Or, alternatively, are conformational changes of FZD4, signalosome formation, or Wnt-induced expression of additional proteins responsible? What argues against the latter possibilities is that none of 17 other WNTs or Norrin enables binding of the respective probes to FZD4/GPR124- or FZD4/RECK-expressing cells. Nevertheless, the point could be further clarified by displaying signaling-incompetent receptor complexes at the cell surface (e.g., in cells lacking endogenous LRP5 and LRP6). What is the role of FZDs in the WNT7-dependent association of both probes in the cell-surface binding experiment? In one scenario, FZD would merely serve to concentrate WNT7 on the cell surface, and this would enhance binding of each probe to WNT7. However, it seems more likely that probe binding is enhanced in the presence of FZD4 due to additional interactions between components of a receptor complex. Based on cell surface binding assays and expression analysis in CNS vasculatures, FZD1, -4, and -8 emerge as candidate receptors for WNT7/β-catenin signaling in CNS vascular development. Several open questions remain, including: what other developmental processes require WNT7 signaling and the co-activators GPR124 and RECK? How does β-catenin-dependent signaling in endothelial cells affect tip cell and mural cell function? What other interactions in the ligand/receptor complex are important? Can GPR124 and RECK recruit Wnt receptor complex components into specialized membrane compartments? The striking function of the receptor co-factors in WNT7 signaling remains a fascinating subject.

However, correctly placing the endotracheal tube might be challenging. Channeled video laryngoscopic blades have an endotracheal tube already pre-loaded, allowing to advance the tube once the glottis is visualized. We hypothesized that use of a channel blade with pre-loaded endotracheal tube results in a faster intubation, compared to a curved Macintosh blade video laryngoscope.After ethical approval and informed consent, patients were randomized to receive endotracheal Intubation with either the King Vision® video laryngoscope with curved blade (control) or channeled blade (channeled). Success rate, evaluation of the glottis view (percentage of glottic opening (POGO), Cormack&Lehane (C&L)) and intubating time were evaluated.Over a two-month period, a total of 46 patients (control n = 23; channeled n = 23) were examined. The first attempt success rates were comparable between groups (control 100% (23/23) vs. channeled 96% (22/23); p = 0.31). Overall intubation time was significantly shorter with control (median 40 sec; IQR [24-58]), compared to channeled (59 sec [40-74]; p = 0.03). There were no differences in glottis visualization between groups.Compared with the King Vision channeled blade, time for tracheal intubation was shorter with the control group using a non-channeled blade. First attempt success and visualization of the glottis were comparable. These data do not support the hypothesis that a channeled blade is superior to a curved video laryngoscopic blade without tube guidance.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02344030."
https://openalex.org/W2752396511,"Sommersdorf Castle (Bavaria, Germany) is a medieval castle complex which has been inhabited by the aristocratic family von Crailsheim. The deceased were entombed in a crypt located in the parapets underneath the castle's church, resulting in mummification of the bodies. Based on the family chronicle and oral history, identities have been ascribed to the mummies. The aim of the study is therefore to test the accuracy of the historical records in comparison to archaeological, anthropological and genetic data. Today, the crypt houses eleven wooden coffins from the 17th to 19th century AD. In ten of these, mummified and scattered human remains were found. Archive records were studied in order to identify names, ancestry, titles, occupation, date of birth and death, and place of interment of the individuals. The coffins were visually inspected and dated by typo-chronology, and the mummified and scattered skeletal remains were subjected to a physical anthropological examination. In total, the crypt contains the remains of a minimum number of nine individuals, among them three adult males, five adult females and one infant. A detailed scientific examination, including prior conservation, ancient DNA analyses, and computed tomography (CT), was performed on five mummies. By means of the CT data age at death, sex, body height, pathologies, and anatomical variants were investigated. CT analysis further showed that the bodies were naturally mummified. Mitochondrial DNA analyses revealed that the tested individuals are not maternally related. In addition, health, living conditions and circumstances of death of the entombed individuals could be highlighted. Being confronted with the strengths, weaknesses and limitations of each methodological approach, probable identification was achieved in two cases."
https://openalex.org/W2751054682,"Surveillance systems of exotic infectious diseases aim to ensure transparency about the country-specific animal disease situation (i.e. demonstrate disease freedom) and to identify any introductions. In a context of decreasing resources, evaluation of surveillance efficiency is essential to help stakeholders make relevant decisions about prioritization of measures and funding allocation. This study evaluated the efficiency (sensitivity related to cost) of the French bovine brucellosis surveillance system using stochastic scenario tree models. Cattle herds were categorized into three risk groups based on the annual number of purchases, given that trading is considered as the main route of brucellosis introduction in cattle herds. The sensitivity in detecting the disease and the costs of the current surveillance system, which includes clinical (abortion) surveillance, programmed serological testing and introduction controls, were compared to those of 19 alternative surveillance scenarios. Surveillance costs included veterinary fees and laboratory analyses. The sensitivity over a year of the current surveillance system was predicted to be 91±7% at a design prevalence of 0.01% for a total cost of 14.9±1.8 million €. Several alternative surveillance scenarios, based on clinical surveillance and random or risk-based serological screening in a sample (20%) of the population, were predicted to be at least as sensitive but for a lower cost. Such changes would reduce whole surveillance costs by 20 to 61% annually, and the costs for farmers only would be decreased from about 12.0 million € presently to 5.3-9.0 million € (i.e. 25-56% decrease). Besides, fostering the evolution of the surveillance system in one of these directions would be in agreement with the European regulations and farmers perceptions on brucellosis risk and surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W2753851010,"Remotely sensed data can serve as an independent source of information about the location of residential structures in areas under demographic and health surveillance. We report on results obtained combining satellite imagery, imported from Bing, with location data routinely collected using the built-in GPS sensors of tablet computers, to assess completeness of population coverage in a Health and Demographic Surveillance System in Malawi. The Majete Malaria Project Health and Demographic Surveillance System, in Malawi, started in 2014 to support a project with the aim of studying the reduction of malaria using an integrated control approach by rolling out insecticide treated nets and improved case management supplemented with house improvement and larval source management. In order to support the monitoring of the trial a Health and Demographic Surveillance System was established in the area that surrounds the Majete Wildlife Reserve (1600 km2), using the OpenHDS data system. We compared house locations obtained using GPS recordings on mobile devices during the demographic surveillance census round with those acquired from satellite imagery. Volunteers were recruited through the crowdcrafting.org platform to identify building structures on the images, which enabled the compilation of a database with coordinates of potential residences. For every building identified on these satellite images by the volunteers (11,046 buildings identified of which 3424 (ca. 30%) were part of the censused area), we calculated the distance to the nearest house enumerated on the ground by fieldworkers during the census round of the HDSS. A random sample of buildings (85 structures) identified on satellite images without a nearby location enrolled in the census were visited by a fieldworker to determine how many were missed during the baseline census survey, if any were missed. The findings from this ground-truthing effort suggest that a high population coverage was achieved in the census survey, however the crowd-sourcing did not locate many of the inhabited structures (52.3% of the 6543 recorded during the census round). We conclude that using auxiliary data can play a useful role in quality assurance in population based health surveillance, but improved algorithms would be needed if crowd-sourced house locations are to be used as the basis of population databases."
https://openalex.org/W2508517637,"Nutrient deprivation during early development has been associated with the predisposition to metabolic disorders in adulthood. Considering its interaction with metabolism, appetite and behavior, the endocannabinoid (eCB) system represents a promising target of developmental programming.By cross-fostering and variation of litter size, early postnatal nutrition of CB6F1-hybrid mice was controlled during the lactation period (3, 6, or 10 pups/mother). After weaning and redistribution at P21, all pups received standard chow ad libitum. Gene expression analyses (liver, visceral fat, hypothalamus) were performed at P50, eCB concentrations were determined in liver and visceral fat. Locomotor activity and social behavior were analyzed by means of computer-assisted videotracking.Body growth was permanently altered, with differences for length, weight, body mass index and fat mass persisting beyond P100 (all 3>6>10,p<0.01). This was paralleled by differences in hepatic IGF-I expression (p<0.01). Distinct gene expression patterns for key enzymes of the eCB system were observed in fat (eCB-synthesis: 3>6>10 (DAGLα p<0.05; NAPE-PLD p = 0.05)) and liver (eCB-degradation: 3>6>10 (FAAH p<0.05; MGL p<0.01)). Concentrations of endocannabinoids AEA and 2-AG in liver and visceral fat were largely comparable, except for a borderline significance for higher AEA (liver, p = 0.049) in formerly overfed mice and, vice versa, tendencies (p<0.1) towards lower AEA (fat) and 2-AG (liver) in formerly underfed animals. In the arcuate nucleus, formerly underfed mice tended to express more eCB-receptor transcripts (CB1R p<0.05; CB2R p = 0.08) than their overfed fellows. Open-field social behavior testing revealed significant group differences, with formerly underfed mice turning out to be the most sociable animals (p<0.01). Locomotor activity did not differ.Our data indicate a developmental plasticity of somatic growth, behavior and parameters of the eCB system, with long-lasting impact of early postnatal nutrition. Developmental programming of the eCB system in metabolically active tissues, as shown here for liver and fat, may play a role in the formation of the adult cardiometabolic risk profile following perinatal malnutrition in humans."

In this issue of Neuron, Watanabe et al., 2017Watanabe K. Chiu H. Pfeiffer B.D. Wong A. Hoopfer E.D. Rubin G.M. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 2017; 95 (this issue): 1112-1128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar uncover how octopamine, an invertebrate norepinephrine analog, modulates the neural pathways that bias Drosophila males toward aggression. If you find yourself in a dark alley on a rainy night and a stranger approaches you, your heart might begin to race and you will be ready to fight or flee, depending on what the stranger does next. On the other hand, if you are walking through the park on a sunny day, you will likely smile and remain calm when a stranger approaches. Context is incredibly important, and our brains have evolved to allow us to flexibly alter our behavioral responses given the situation. In addition, internal drive can exert a powerful effect on behavioral choices (e.g., your reaction to the stranger on a sunny day might be quite different if you had only gotten an hour of sleep the night before). How do our nervous systems enable us to use both context and internal state to produce the right behavior at the right time? Numerous studies have pointed to an important role for neuromodulators (e.g., dopamine, serotonin, or norepinephrine). Studies in both worms and flies (with numerically simple nervous systems and powerful genetic tools that facilitate connecting neural function with behavior) reveal that such molecules, by increasing or decreasing the influence of particular synaptic connections, can flexibly alter how information is integrated or routed through neural circuits (Bargmann, 2012Bargmann C.I. BioEssays. 2012; 34: 458-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). But how neuromodulators exert their effects in a context-dependent manner remains less well understood. Norepinephrine, and its invertebrate analog octopamine (OA), is a potent modulator of brain-wide states such as arousal (e.g., Suver et al., 2012Suver M.P. Mamiya A. Dickinson M.H. Curr. Biol. 2012; 22: 2294-2302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), but can it also target specific circuits to bias behavioral choices? Addressing this question requires identifying the relevant receptor neurons (neurons that receive the neuromodulatory signal) and determining how they direct specific aspects of behavior given a certain context or internal state. This is precisely what Watanabe et al. achieve in this issue of Neuron, uncovering a previously uncharacterized node of integration between OA and a neural pathway involved in the choice between two mutually exclusive social behaviors: aggression and courtship (Figure 1). A male fruit fly that has lived alone his entire adult life (“single-housed”) will aggressively fight by lunging or producing wing threats when presented with another male and in the context of a resource worth fighting over (e.g., a fresh patch of fly food). In contrast, if presented with a female, he will instead chase her and sing a sonorous love song via wing vibration. Interestingly, if first housed with other males for a period of time (“group-housed”), he will act much less aggressively toward a new male—an effect shown to be modulated by OA (Zhou et al., 2008Zhou C. Rao Y. Rao Y. Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 1059-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). To elucidate how OA is integrated into the known aggression/courtship circuitry, Watanabe et al. ask how OA-responsive neurons flexibly bias male flies toward or against aggression in the presence of another male. To determine which subset of the roughly 100,000 neurons in the Drosophila brain are modulated by the OA signal to induce males to fight (Hoyer et al., 2008Hoyer S.C. Eckart A. Herrel A. Zars T. Fischer S.A. Hardie S.L. Heisenberg M. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 159-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), the authors developed a new class of neural circuit tool generated by bashing up the cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) for all of the known OA receptors in the Drosophila genome. This produced a tractable number of enhancer lines (34) to be screened via neural silencing, testing for single-housed males that showed a decrease in lunging toward other males. Watanabe et al. identified line R47A04, which drives expression in just a few neuron types. When activated with NaChBac (a bacterial ion channel that constitutively depolarizes the cell membrane), it specifically increases the amount of aggression in group-housed males. However, the authors do not get the same result when driving the R47A04 neurons with phasic optogenetic or thermogenetic activation. They interpret this to mean that the neurons labeled in R47A04 are permissive, but not instructive, in driving male-male aggression. In their hands, depolarizing all OA neurons does not produce aggression either (in contrast with Zhou et al., 2008Zhou C. Rao Y. Rao Y. Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 1059-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), also consistent with this hypothesis. Line R47A04 was constructed using the CRM for the Oamb (octopamine α1) receptor, indicating that R47A04 neurons express this receptor. They confirm this with an elegant series of gene knockdown, rescue, and overexpression experiments—Oamb is specifically required in R47A04 neurons for the increased aggression phenotypes. But which specific neurons in the R47A04 line are involved in aggression? Here, Watanabe et al. make exquisite use of the Drosophila toolkit: using a recombination strategy to selectively remove expression of neurons within this line, they identify a crucial subset of male-specific neurons located in the superior medial protocerebrum (SMP), also known as aSP2 (Figure 1A). These neurons produce strong calcium responses to bath application of OA, although with a delay. The SMP is also home to the projections of another male-specific set of neurons (termed P1), known to induce both courtship and aggression behaviors (Hoopfer et al., 2015Hoopfer E.D. Jung Y. Inagaki H.K. Rubin G.M. Anderson D.J. eLife. 2015; 4: e11346Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Watanabe et al. find with functional imaging that R47A04aSP2 neurons produce rapid calcium transients in response to P1 activation, and when R47A04aSP2 neurons are silenced, P1 neurons no longer induce aggression. These data indicate that R47A04aSP2 neurons are functionally downstream of P1 (although which specific subset of P1 neurons they respond to remains open); therefore, OA can bias males toward aggression by routing P1 activity through the R47A04aSP2 neurons (Figure 1B). How do R47A04aSP2 neurons shape the balance between courtship and aggression (for example, in natural environments, when males are likely to encounter both males and females)? Male-specific P1 neurons are known to be activated by a courtship-promoting cuticular hydrocarbon, 7,11-heptacosadiene, produced by females (Clowney et al., 2015Clowney E.J. Iguchi S. Bussell J.J. Scheer E. Ruta V. Neuron. 2015; 87: 1036-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), whereas the OA neurons are downstream of taste receptors that detect 7-tricosene, a male-specific molecule known to suppress courtship and promote aggression (Andrews et al., 2014Andrews J.C. Fernández M.P. Yu Q. Leary G.P. Leung A.K.W. Kavanaugh M.P. Kravitz E.A. Certel S.J. PLoS Genet. 2014; 10: e1004356Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). R47A04aSP2 neurons may thus constitute a neural correlate for “jealousy,” biasing males toward aggression, but only in the presence of a female. This provides a clear example of how contextual cues can shape behavioral decisions via neuromodulation (Anderson, 2016Anderson D.J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2016; 17: 692-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). OA neurons are known to encode internal states, such as wakefulness (Crocker et al., 2010Crocker A. Shahidullah M. Levitan I.B. Sehgal A. Neuron. 2010; 65: 670-681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and might also encode other contextual cues. For example, visual feedback plays a prominent role in shaping both aggressive lunging (Hoyer et al., 2008Hoyer S.C. Eckart A. Herrel A. Zars T. Fischer S.A. Hardie S.L. Heisenberg M. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 159-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and courtship song patterning (Coen et al., 2016Coen P. Xie M. Clemens J. Murthy M. Neuron. 2016; 89: 629-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)—OA neurons are known to modulate the gain of Drosophila visual pathways (Suver et al., 2012Suver M.P. Mamiya A. Dickinson M.H. Curr. Biol. 2012; 22: 2294-2302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and thereby may also affect the choice between aggression and courtship. Finally, neuromodulation can also occur at the level of the P1 neurons, where dopaminergic modulation scales with social history (Zhang et al., 2016Zhang S.X. Rogulja D. Crickmore M.A. Neuron. 2016; 91: 168-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This study raises a number of new questions. First, what circuits downstream of the R47A04aSP2 neurons control and pattern aggression behaviors? The R47A04aSP2 neurons do not appear to be downstream of the Tachykinin (Tk) aggression- promoting neurons (Asahina et al., 2014Asahina K. Watanabe K. Duistermars B.J. Hoopfer E. González C.R. Eyjólfsdóttir E.A. Perona P. Anderson D.J. Cell. 2014; 156: 221-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), so they may represent a separate pathway for modulating aggression. Second, what can be made of the timescale of responses in R47A04aSP2 neurons to OA application (delayed) versus P1 activation (immediate)? Activation of P1 neurons in the presence of males induces wing extensions (and likely also singing) while the activating stimulus is on and lunging only after the stimulus has been turned off (Hoopfer et al., 2015Hoopfer E.D. Jung Y. Inagaki H.K. Rubin G.M. Anderson D.J. eLife. 2015; 4: e11346Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar): P1 activation may therefore have a “priming” effect on aggression behaviors via R47A04aSP2 neurons. R47A04aSP2 neurons do not, in contrast with P1 neurons, induce wing extensions when activated; these neurons therefore may bring the system above threshold for aggression, but not for courtship. Interestingly, males with R47A04aSP2 neurons silenced show an increase in wing extensions, indicating that turning down aggression-related behaviors is coordinated with turning up courtship-related behaviors. It will be interesting to determine if there exists a similar neuromodulatory pathway that biases the circuit instead toward courtship behaviors, and how this modulatory pathway interacts with the R47A04aSP2 neurons. However, it is important to keep in mind that all of the existing data are still consistent with the existence of two separate populations of P1 neurons that control courtship versus aggression; new reagents that specifically label subpopulations of P1 should help to resolve this issue. Third, the neurons studied here are all male-specific; however, OA has been shown to be important for both male and female aggression (Zhou et al., 2008Zhou C. Rao Y. Rao Y. Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 1059-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Does OA have a conserved role in modulating the choice between mating and aggression behaviors, but via distinct circuits, in females? Finally, aggression and courtship are high-level terms used to describe groupings of actions flies produce. Beyond lunging, what other actions do the R47A04aSP2 neurons modulate? The use of largely “unsupervised” methods to segment Drosophila behavior (Berman et al., 2014Berman G.J. Choi D.M. Bialek W. Shaevitz J.W. J. R. Soc. Interface. 2014; 11: 20140672Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) may provide important insights into how precisely OA and R47A04aSP2 neurons influence the dynamic movements and sensorimotor transformations that comprise fly social interactions. Previous studies of OA and aggression in Drosophila were all consistent with OA (like its norepinephrine analog) broadly regulating arousal, and thereby having an indirect effect on aggression. By combining careful behavioral analysis with sophisticated genetic and neural circuit manipulations, the study from Watanabe et al. now reveals that OA can modulate specific networks that control social behaviors, biasing the output of the network in favor of driving aggression. It is tempting to speculate that similar mechanisms might underlie the effects of norepinephrine on social behaviors in larger brains, including those of humans.

https://openalex.org/W2753194159,"Braya humilis is a member of the Euclidieae tribe within the family Brassicaceae. This species exhibits a broad range of adaptations to different climatic zones and latitudes as it has a distribution that ranges from northern Asia to the arctic-alpine regions of northern North America. In China, B. humilis is mainly found on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and in adjacent arid regions. In this study, we sequenced a sample from an arid region adjacent to the QTP using the Illumina platform generating a total of 46,485 highly accurate unigenes, of which 78.41% were annotated by BLASTing versus public protein databases. The B. humilis transcriptome is characterized by a high level of sequence conservation compared with its close relative, Arabidopsis thaliana. We also used reciprocal blast to identify shared orthologous genes between B. humilis and four other sequenced Brassicaceae species (i.e. A. thaliana, A. lyrata, Capsella rubella, and Thellungiella parvula). To enable precise characterization of orthologous genes, the early-diverging basal angiosperm Amborella trichopoda was also included. A total of 6,689 orthologous genes were identified before stricter criteria for the determination of e-values, amino acid hit lengths, and identity values was applied to further reduce this list. This led to a final list of 381 core orthologous genes for B. humilis; 39 out of these genes are involved in salt and osmotic stress responses and estimations of nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution ratios for this species and A. thaliana orthologs show that these genes are under purifying selection in B. humilis. Expression of six genes was detected in B. humilis seedlings under salt and osmotic stress treatments. Comparable expression patterns to their counterparts in Arabidopsis suggest that these orthologous genes are both sequence and functional conservation. The results of this study demonstrate that the environmental adaptations of B. humilis are mainly the results of preexisting genetic components. Future work will be required to characterize the expression patterns of these orthologous genes in natural populations and will provide further insights into the adaptive mechanisms underlying the wide range of B. humilis adaptations."
https://openalex.org/W2753307738,"To identify putative cis-elements involved in gene expression regulation in Leishmania, we previously conducted an in silico investigation to find conserved intercoding sequences (CICS) in the genomes of L. major, L. infantum, and L. braziliensis. Here, the CICS databank was explored to search for sequences that were present in the untranslated regions (UTRs) of groups of genes showing similar expression profiles during in vitro differentiation. Using a selectable marker as a reporter gene, flanked by either an intact 3' UTR or a UTR lacking the conserved element, the regulatory role of a CICS was confirmed. We observed that the pattern of modulation of the mRNA levels was altered in the absence of the CICS. We also identified putative CICS RNA-binding proteins. This study suggests that the publicly available CICS database is a useful tool for identifying regulatory cis-elements for Leishmania genes and suggests the existence of post-transcriptional regulons in Leishmania."
