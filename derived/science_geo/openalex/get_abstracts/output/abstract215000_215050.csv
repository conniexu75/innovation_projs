https://openalex.org/W80667966,"Thyroglobulin, the major protein component of normal thyroid glands, contains more than 80% of the thyroidal iodine and has been considered the only source of thyroid hormones (1). Aqueous thyroid extracts contain, besides thyroglobulin, other proteins in variable amounts. Essentially, four methods have been used for the characterization of the various components in such extracts and for the purification of thyroglobulin: salting out, electrophoresis, column chromatography, and ultracentrifugation. Salting out with ammonium sulfate or potassium phosphate (2) is the classical method for preparing thyroglobulin. However, salting out preparations are always contaminated with compounds that sediment faster than thyroglobulin, the 19 S ultracentrifugal component of thyroid extracts (3-5). Electrophoretic methods likewise yield preparations of thyroglobulin known to be heterogeneous when analyzed in the analytical ultracentrifuge (4, 6-9). Column chromatography on DEAEcellulose gives highly purified thyroglobulin (4, 10) but the yield is rather poor. The main disadvant.age of this method is that thyroglobulin itself is fractionated on these columns according to its iodine content. The ultracentrifugally homogeneous fraction obtained by this method has a considerably lower iodine content than the whole thyroglobulin (4, 11-13). Ultracentrifugation is one of the most useful analytical procedures, but preparative moving boundary ultracentrifugation (3) requires multiple runs to obtain good yields of highly purified thyroglobulin. All the methods now available for the purification of thyroglobulin and for the analysis of crude or partially purified thyroid estracts therefore present major shortcomings. The need for suitable methods for the analysis of thyroid extracts, as well as for the preparation of highly purified thyroglobulin, led to the work to be reported here. Methods of fractionation based essentially on molecular size were found to be most useful. Filtration through granulated agar or dextran gel columns was used for the purification of thyroglobulin; ultracentrifugation in a linear density gradient was employed for both analytical and preparative purposes."

https://openalex.org/W20140133,"In the two preceding papers, evidence has been presented for the enzymatic synthesis of polyglycerophosphate (1) and polyribitol phosphate (2) from cytidine diphosphate glycerol and cytidine diphosphate ribitol, respectively. In this paper, we describe the glycosyl transfer from uridine diphosphate glucose to polyglycerophosphate by an enzyme from Bacillus subtilis. Teichoic acids differ in the nature and number of the glycosyl residues attached to the polyol phosphate backbone (3). The glucosyl transfer described in this paper gives rise to one of the simplest teichoic acid structures, in which every glycerol residue in the polyglycerophosphate backbone has attached to the hydroxyl at carbon 2 an ol-glucopyranosyl residue. A similar reaction, the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine residues to polyribitol phosphate from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine has been described by Nathenson and Strominger (4). A second glucosylating system for glycerol teichoic acid has been described in a preliminary communication (5). This system isolated from BaciUus Zicheniformis is more complex and will be reported in detail later."

When repetitive stimuli were applied, there was a lag period followed by the appearance of phosphorylase a, which increased in amount until a steady state was reached. Increasing the rate of stimulation shortened lag period and resulted in higher steady state levels of phosphorylase a. Pretreatment of muscles with epinephrine, amounts that increased the resting level of phosphorylase a only slightly, abolished the lag period completely. Changes in external work affected neither the lag period nor the steady state levels of phosphorylase a. Lowering the transmembrane potential by increasing the concentration of K+ in the external media was associated with increases in phosphorylase a even after relaxation of the initial contracture.

https://openalex.org/W90674671,"In pursuing quantitative histochemical investigations aimed at demonstrating the biochemical architecture of human frontal cortex (l-4), we found it necessary to determine ganglioside sialic acid in submicrogram amounts. Even when adapted to the microscale, spectrophotometric methods lack the sensitivity required for studying nervous tissue samples containing less than 0.3 pg of sialic acid. Since fluorometric methods usually possess a sensitivity 100to lOOO-fold that of spectrophotometric methods, the possibility of devising a fluorometric technique for sialic acid measurement was investigated. N-Acetylneuraminic acid of brain gangliosides is a 9 carbon or-keto acid. Such compounds readily undergo decarboxylation on treatment with hot mineral acids. Formation under such conditions of the deacylated, decarboxylated derivative of NAN,’ 2-deoxy-4-amino-octose, has been suggested by Gottschalk (5) as the basis for the reaction of NAN in (a) the diphenylamine test; (b) the resorcinol-HCl test; and (c) humin formation at concentrations of hot mineral acid as low as 0.1 N. The 2-deoxy sugars and in general aldehydes of the type R-CHZ-CHO will react wit,h 3,5-diaminobenzoic acid when heated in mineral acids to yield highly fluorescent quinaldines. The product of the Doebner and Von Miller quinoline synthesis involving acetaldehyde and 3,5-diaminobenzoic acid has been characterized by Velluz, Amiard, and Pesez (6), who also reported (7, 8) that deoxyribose and DNA undergo the reaction. The principle was applied subsequently to the ultramicro assay of DNA by Kissane and Robins (9), of succinic semialdehyde by Salvador and Albers (lo), and of 2-deoxy-n-glucose by Blecher (II). When NAN was heated at 100” under conditions similar to those used in the DNA method (9), a green fluorescent product was obtained, as described in a preliminary report (12). Hexoses, however, were serious interfering compounds in the method as it was originally carried out, presumably because an intermediate in the conversion of hexose to levulinic acid by hot mineral acids is w-OH-levulinic aldehyde, an a-methylene aldehyde (13). In a search for reaction conditions which would favor the synthesis of the sialic acid product over that of hexoses, systematic studies were made of the effects on the fluorescence yield of variations in 3,5-diaminobenzoic acid and HCl concentrations as well as in temperature and duration of the heating period. Conditions were found enabling reduction in the interference by hexoses t,o 1.6% on a molar basis. The sensitivity of t.he resulting method may be indicated by the fact that the"
