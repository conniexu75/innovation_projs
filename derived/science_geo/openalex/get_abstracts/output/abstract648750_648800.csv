https://openalex.org/W3010429318,"Tuning band gaps with three halides Tandem solar cells can boost solar cell efficiency by using two active layers to absorb the solar spectrum more completely, provided that the two cells are current-matched. Inorganic-organic perovskites tuned to the appropriate wide band gap (∼1.7 electron volts) as top cells that contained iodine and bromine or bromine and chlorine have short carrier diffusion lengths and undergo photo-induced phase segregation. Xu et al. now report a method for incorporating chloride that allows for fabrication of stable triple-halide perovskites with a band gap of 1.67 electron volts. Two-terminal tandem silicon solar cells made with this material had a power conversion efficiency of 27%. Science , this issue p. 1097"
https://openalex.org/W3009827509,"Stacking solar cells with decreasing band gaps to form tandems presents the possibility of overcoming the single-junction Shockley-Queisser limit in photovoltaics. The rapid development of solution-processed perovskites has brought perovskite single-junction efficiencies >20%. However, this process has yet to enable monolithic integration with industry-relevant textured crystalline silicon solar cells. We report tandems that combine solution-processed micrometer-thick perovskite top cells with fully textured silicon heterojunction bottom cells. To overcome the charge-collection challenges in micrometer-thick perovskites, we enhanced threefold the depletion width at the bases of silicon pyramids. Moreover, by anchoring a self-limiting passivant (1-butanethiol) on the perovskite surfaces, we enhanced the diffusion length and further suppressed phase segregation. These combined enhancements enabled an independently certified power conversion efficiency of 25.7% for perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells. These devices exhibited negligible performance loss after a 400-hour thermal stability test at 85°C and also after 400 hours under maximum power point tracking at 40°C."

Protein translation outside of annotated open reading frames (ORFs) in messenger RNAs and within ORFs in long noncoding RNAs is pervasive. A functional screen using CRISPR-Cas9 with single-cell transcriptomics suggested critical roles for hundreds of micropeptides. Micropeptides encoded by multiple short, upstream ORFs form stable protein complexes with the downstream canonical proteins encoded on the same messenger RNAs.

https://openalex.org/W3010320439,"Many disease pathologies can be understood through the elucidation of localized biomolecular networks, or microenvironments. To this end, enzymatic proximity labeling platforms are broadly applied for mapping the wider spatial relationships in subcellular architectures. However, technologies that can map microenvironments with higher precision have long been sought. Here, we describe a microenvironment-mapping platform that exploits photocatalytic carbene generation to selectively identify protein-protein interactions on cell membranes, an approach we term MicroMap (μMap). By using a photocatalyst-antibody conjugate to spatially localize carbene generation, we demonstrate selective labeling of antibody binding targets and their microenvironment protein neighbors. This technique identified the constituent proteins of the programmed-death ligand 1 (PD-L1) microenvironment in live lymphocytes and selectively labeled within an immunosynaptic junction."

Mil et al. propose a modular scheme for quantum simulation of a U(1) lattice gauge theory based on heteronuclear spin-changing collisions in a mixture of two bosonic quantum gases isolated in single wells of a one-dimensional optical lattice. They engineered the elementary building block for a single well and demonstrate its reliable operation that preserves the gauge invariance. The potential for scalability of the proposed scheme opens up opportunities to address challenges in quantum simulating the continuum limit of the gauge theories. Science , this issue p. 1128"
https://openalex.org/W3009300806,"Single-atom impurities and other atomic-scale defects can notably alter the local vibrational responses of solids and, ultimately, their macroscopic properties. Using high-resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy in the electron microscope, we show that a single substitutional silicon impurity in graphene induces a characteristic, localized modification of the vibrational response. Extensive ab initio calculations reveal that the measured spectroscopic signature arises from defect-induced pseudo-localized phonon modes-that is, resonant states resulting from the hybridization of the defect modes and the bulk continuum-with energies that can be directly matched to the experiments. This finding realizes the promise of vibrational spectroscopy in the electron microscope with single-atom sensitivity and has broad implications across the fields of physics, chemistry, and materials science."
https://openalex.org/W3009744230,"Human brain activity during memory Animal studies suggest that sequence replay of neuronal activity may underlie memory retrieval and consolidation. However, there is no direct evidence that the replay of spiking activity sequences is important for these processes in the human brain. Vaz et al. simultaneously recorded single-unit spikes, local field potential, and intracranial electroencephalography signals in the brain while participants performed a memory task. Sharp wave ripple oscillations in the temporal lobe cortex reflected bursts of neural spiking, and these bursts of spikes organized into sequences during memory formation. These sequences were replayed during successful memory retrieval. The extent of sequence replay during correct recall was related to the extent to which cortical spiking activity was coupled with ripples in the medial temporal lobe. Science , this issue p. 1131"
https://openalex.org/W3009520140,"De novo germline mutations in the RNA helicase DDX3X account for 1%-3% of unexplained intellectual disability (ID) cases in females and are associated with autism, brain malformations, and epilepsy. Yet, the developmental and molecular mechanisms by which DDX3X mutations impair brain function are unknown. Here, we use human and mouse genetics and cell biological and biochemical approaches to elucidate mechanisms by which pathogenic DDX3X variants disrupt brain development. We report the largest clinical cohort to date with DDX3X mutations (n = 107), demonstrating a striking correlation between recurrent dominant missense mutations, polymicrogyria, and the most severe clinical outcomes. We show that Ddx3x controls cortical development by regulating neuron generation. Severe DDX3X missense mutations profoundly disrupt RNA helicase activity, induce ectopic RNA-protein granules in neural progenitors and neurons, and impair translation. Together, these results uncover key mechanisms underlying DDX3X syndrome and highlight aberrant RNA metabolism in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disease."
https://openalex.org/W3010069454,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis has an unusual outer membrane that lacks canonical porin proteins for the transport of small solutes to the periplasm. We discovered that 3,3-bis-di(methylsulfonyl)propionamide (3bMP1) inhibits the growth of M. tuberculosis, and resistance to this compound is conferred by mutation within a member of the proline-proline-glutamate (PPE) family, PPE51. Deletion of PPE51 rendered M. tuberculosis cells unable to replicate on propionamide, glucose, or glycerol. Growth was restored upon loss of the mycobacterial cell wall component phthiocerol dimycocerosate. Mutants in other proline-glutamate (PE)/PPE clusters, responsive to magnesium and phosphate, also showed a phthiocerol dimycocerosate-dependent growth compromise upon limitation of the corresponding substrate. Phthiocerol dimycocerosate determined the low permeability of the mycobacterial outer membrane, and the PE/PPE proteins apparently act as solute-specific channels."

Linneweber et al. now show that these behaviors are stable for an individual but diverse in an isogenic population. Key to generating individual diversity in the population is the inherent chaos of normal development. A set of neurons in the visual system is wired up in a variable manner, resulting in brain circuit asymmetry unique to each fly that guides its line-walking behavior. With more asymmetry in its brain circuit, a fly is better able to orient to the line. Science , this issue p. 1112"

The brain circuits involved in these functions are still not completely understood. In a rat model, Kataoka et al. combined anatomical tracing, immediate early gene expression analysis, pharmacology, optogenetics, electrophysiology, and genetic cell ablation to provide evidence for the prominent role of a ventral part of the medial prefrontal cortex in sympathetic responses to social defeat stress. This brain region sends excitatory projections to the dorsomedial hypothalamus as a central coordinator of the psychosocial stress responses. This pathway is crucial for understanding how psychosocial stress influences a variety of body functions. Science , this issue p. 1105"

https://openalex.org/W3009202340,"Americans are increasingly relying on crowdfunding to pay for the costs of healthcare. In medical crowdfunding (MCF), online platforms allow individuals to appeal to social networks to request donations for health and medical needs. Users are often told that success depends on how they organize and share their campaigns to increase social network engagement. However, experts have cautioned that MCF could exacerbate health and social disparities by amplifying the choices (and biases) of the crowd and leveraging these to determine who has access to financial support for healthcare. To date, research on potential axes of disparity in MCF, and their impacts on fundraising outcomes, has been limited. To answer these questions, this paper presents an exploratory cross-sectional study of a randomized sample of 637 MCF campaigns on the popular platform GoFundMe, for which the race, gender, age, and relationships of campaigners and campaign recipients were categorized alongside campaign characteristics and outcomes. Using both descriptive and inferential statistics, the analysis examines race, gender, and age disparities in MCF use, and tests how these are associated with differential campaign outcomes. The results show systemic disparities in MCF use and outcomes: people of color (and black women in particular) are under-represented; there is significant evidence of an additional digital care labor burden on women organizers of campaigns; and marginalized race and gender groups are associated with poorer fundraising outcomes. Outcomes are only minimally associated with campaign characteristics under users’ control, such as photos, videos, and updates. These results corroborate widespread concerns with how technology fuels health inequities, and how crowdfunding may be creating an unequal and biased marketplace for those seeking financial support to access healthcare. Further research and better data access are needed to explore these dynamics more deeply and inform policy for this largely unregulated industry."
https://openalex.org/W3010624693,"Treatment of patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is limited by a lack of effective molecular therapies targeting this disease. Recent studies have identified metabolic alterations in cancer cells that can be targeted to improve responses to standard-of-care chemotherapy regimens. Using MDA-MB-468 and SUM-159PT TNBC cells, along with LC-MS/MS and HPLC metabolomics profiling, we found here that exposure of TNBC cells to the cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs cisplatin and doxorubicin alter arginine and polyamine metabolites. This alteration was because of a reduction in the levels and activity of a rate-limiting polyamine biosynthetic enzyme, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). Using gene silencing and inhibitor treatments, we determined that the reduction in ODC was mediated by its negative regulator antizyme, targeting ODC to the proteasome for degradation. Treatment with the ODC inhibitor difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) sensitized TNBC cells to chemotherapy, but this was not observed in receptor-positive breast cancer cells. Moreover, TNBC cell lines had greater sensitivity to single-agent DFMO, and ODC levels were elevated in TNBC patient samples. The alterations in polyamine metabolism in response to chemotherapy, as well as DFMO-induced preferential sensitization of TNBC cells to chemotherapy, reported here suggest that ODC may be a targetable metabolic vulnerability in TNBC."
https://openalex.org/W3009671199,"Across North America, the opioid overdose epidemic is leading to increasing hospitalizations of people who use drugs (PWUD). However, hospitals are ill-prepared to meet the needs of PWUD. We focus on illicit drug use while admitted to hospital and how PWUD and health care providers describe, respond, and attempt to manage its use.Using varied purposive methods in Toronto and Ottawa, we recruited n = 24 PWUD (who self-reported that they were living with HIV and/or HCV infection; currently or had previously used drugs or alcohol in ways that were harmful; had a hospital admission in the past five years) and n = 26 health care providers (who were: currently working in an academic hospital as a physician, nurse, social worker or other allied health professional; and 2) providing care to this patient group). All n = 50 participants completed a short, socio-demographic questionnaire and an audio-recorded semi-structured interview about receiving or providing acute care in a hospital between 04/2014 and 05/2015. Patient participants received $25 CAD and return transit fare; provider participants received a $50 CAD gift card for a bookseller. All participants provided informed consent. Audio-recordings were transcribed verbatim, corrected, and uploaded to NVivo 10. Using the seven-step framework method, transcripts were coded line-by-line and managed using NVvivo. An analytic framework was created by grouping and mapping the codes. Preliminary analyses were presented to advisory group members for comment and used to refine the interpretation. Questionnaire data were managed using SPSS version 22.0 and descriptive statistics were used to describe the participants. Many but not all patient participants spoke about using psycho-active substances not prescribed to them during a hospital admission. Attempts to avoid negative experiences (e.g., withdrawal, boredom, sadness, loneliness and/or untreated pain) were cited as reasons for illicit drug use. Most tried to conceal their illicit drug use from health care providers. Patients described how their self-reported level of pain was not always believed, tolerance to opioids was ignored, and requests for higher doses of pain medications denied. Some health care providers were unaware of on-site illicit drug use; others acknowledged it occurred. Few could identify a hospital policy specific to illicit drug use and most used their personal beliefs to guide their responses to it (e.g., ignore it, increase surveillance of patients, reprimands, loss of privileges/medications, threats of immediate discharge should it continue, and substitution dosing of medication).Providers highlighted gaps in institutional guidance for how they ought to appropriately respond to in-hospital substance use. Patients attempted to conceal illicit drug use in environments with no institutional policies about such use, leading to varied responses that were inconsistent with the principles of patient centred care and reflected personal beliefs about illicit drug use. There are increasing calls for implementation of harm reduction approaches and interventions in hospitals but uptake has been slow. Our study contributes to this emerging body of literature and highlights areas for future research, the development of interventions, and changes to policy and practice."
https://openalex.org/W3010561558,"Mutations in KRAS and/or BRAF that activate the ERK kinase are frequently found in colorectal cancer (CRC) and drive resistance to targeted therapies. Therefore, the identification of therapeutic targets that affect multiple signaling pathways simultaneously is crucial for improving the treatment of patients with KRAS or BRAF mutations. The proprotein convertase furin activates several oncogenic protein precursors involved in the ERK-MAPK pathway by endoproteolytic cleavage. Here we show that genetic inactivation of furin suppresses tumorigenic growth, proliferation, and migration in KRAS or BRAF mutant CRC cell lines but not in wild-type KRAS and BRAF cells. In a mouse xenograft model, these KRAS or BRAF mutant cells lacking furin displayed reduced growth and angiogenesis, and increased apoptosis. Mechanistically, furin inactivation prevents the processing of various protein pecursors including proIGF1R, proIR, proc-MET, proTGF-β1 and NOTCH1 leading to potent and durable ERK-MAPK pathway suppression in KRAS or BRAF mutant cells. Furthermore, we identified genes involved in activating the ERK-MAPK pathway, such as PTGS2, which are downregulated in the KRAS or BRAF mutant cells after furin inactivation but upregulated in wild-type KRAS and BRAF cells. Analysis of human colorectal tumor samples reveals a positive correlation between enhanced furin expression and KRAS or BRAF expression. These results indicate that furin plays an important role in KRAS or BRAF-associated ERK-MAPK pathway activation and tumorigenesis, providing a potential target for personalized treatment."

https://openalex.org/W3009841123,"Abstract Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is commonly overexpressed in prostate cancer and associated with tumour progression. FASN is responsible for de novo synthesis of the fatty acid palmitate; the building block for protein palmitoylation. Recent work has suggested that alongside its established role in promoting cell proliferation FASN may also promote invasion. We now find depletion of FASN expression increases prostate cancer cell adhesiveness, impairs HGF-mediated cell migration and reduces 3D invasion. These changes in motility suggest that FASN can mediate actin cytoskeletal remodelling; a process known to be downstream of Rho family GTPases. Here, we demonstrate that modulation of FASN expression specifically impacts on the palmitoylation of the atypical GTPase RhoU. Impaired RhoU activity in FASN depleted cells leads to reduced adhesion turnover downstream of paxillin serine phosphorylation, which is rescued by addition of exogenous palmitate. Moreover, canonical Cdc42 expression is dependent on the palmitoylation status of RhoU. Thus we uncover a novel relationship between FASN, RhoU and Cdc42 that directly influences cell migration potential. These results provide compelling evidence that FASN activity directly promotes cell migration and supports FASN as a potential therapeutic target in metastatic prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3009736969,"Hypertension is the leading risk factor of cardiovascular disease and has profound effects on both the structure and function of the microvasculature. Abnormalities of the retinal vasculature may reflect the degree of microvascular damage due to hypertension, and these changes can be detected with fundus photographs. This study aimed to use deep learning technique that can detect subclinical features appearing below the threshold of a human observer to explore the effect of hypertension on morphological features of retinal microvasculature. We collected 2012 retinal photographs which included 1007 from patients with a diagnosis of hypertension and 1005 from normotensive control. By method of vessel segmentation, we removed interference information other than retinal vasculature and contained only morphological information about blood vessels. Using these segmented images, we trained a small convolutional neural networks (CNN) classification model and used a deep learning technique called Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to generate heat maps for the class “hypertension”. Our model achieved an accuracy of 60.94%, a specificity of 51.54%, a precision of 59.27%, and a recall of 70.48%. The AUC was 0.6506. In the heat maps for the class “hypertension”, red patchy areas were mainly distributed on or around arterial/venous bifurcations. This indicated that the model has identified these regions as being the most important for predicting hypertension. Our study suggested that the effect of hypertension on retinal microvascular morphology mainly occurred at branching of vessels. The change of the branching pattern of retinal vessels was probably the most significant in response to elevated blood pressure."
https://openalex.org/W3009599565,"Dynein light chain 8 (LC8) interacts with intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and influences a wide range of biological processes. It is becoming apparent that among the numerous IDPs that interact with LC8, many contain multiple LC8-binding sites. Although it is established that LC8 forms parallel IDP duplexes with some partners, such as nucleoporin Nup159 and dynein intermediate chain, the molecular details of these interactions and LC8's interactions with other diverse partners remain largely uncharacterized. LC8 dimers could bind in either a paired or a heterogeneous off-register manner to any of the available sites on a multivalent partner. Here, using NMR chemical shift perturbation, analytical ultracentrifugation, and native electrospray ionization MS, we show that LC8 forms a predominantly in-register complex when bound to an IDP domain of the multivalent regulatory protein ASCIZ. Using saturation transfer difference NMR, we demonstrate that at substoichiometric LC8 concentrations, the IDP domain preferentially binds to one of the three LC8 recognition motifs. Further, the differential dynamic behavior for the three sites and the size of the fully bound complex confirmed an in-register complex. Dynamics measurements also revealed that coupling between sites depends on the linker length separating these sites. These results identify linker length and motif specificity as drivers of in-register binding in the multivalent LC8-IDP complex assembly and the degree of compositional and conformational heterogeneity as a promising emerging mechanism for tuning of binding and regulation."

Viral particles-associated nucleic acids were enriched, randomly amplified, and deep sequenced in 102 mini-pools generating over 2 billion reads. Sequence data was analyzed for the presence of known and novel eukaryotic viral reads. Anelloviruses were detected in 80%, human pegivirus 1 in 19%, and parvovirus B19 in 17% of plasma pools. HIV and enteroviruses were detected in two pools each. Previously uncharacterized viral genomes were also identified, and their presence in single plasma samples confirmed by PCR. Chapparvovirus and ambidensovirus genomes, both in the Parvoviridae family, were partially characterized showing 33% and 34% identity in their NS1 sequences to their closest relative.

However, the mechanism of such regulatory action of the RPTP D2 has mostly remained undefined. RPTPα has been shown to be regulated by dimerization, and the observation of an inaccessible active site in the dimeric crystal structure of its isolated D1 led to the proposed “wedge” model, in which an N-terminal helix-turn-helix “wedge” motif formed by the two N-terminal helices (α1′ and α2′) of one monomer inhibits catalytic activity of the other monomer by insertion into its active site (14Bilwes A.M. den Hertog J.

It has been suggested that oxidation of the RPTPα D2 regulates phosphatase activity by modifying the relative conformation of phosphatase dimers (7Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. den Hertog J.

However, the canonical D1-D2 arrangement seen in several subsequent RPTP structures encompassing both domains proved incompatible with the wedge model; thus, it remains unclear whether the model applies to all RPTPs (2Almo S.C.

At the core of the active site of classical PTP domains, there is a signature HCX5R(S/T) motif, included in the so-called “P loop,” containing a nucleophilic cysteine and an arginine side chain responsible for coordinating the phosphate moiety and stabilizing the negative charge on the protein-substrate complex and the transition state (18Zhang Z. Mechanistic studies on protein tyrosine phosphatases.Prog. Nucleic Acid. Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 73 (12882518): 171-22010.1016/S0079-6603(03)01006-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The same arginine is also responsible for triggering a switch from an inactive, open to an active, closed conformation of the other prominent structural element of the active site, the WPD loop, named after its conserved Trp-Pro-Asp motif, upon substrate binding (18Zhang Z.

Fig. 1A shows the location of the P and WPD loops in a previously published structure of the RPTPα D1 domain. Following substrate binding, the reaction proceeds via two irreversible catalytic steps: the formation of a phosphocysteine intermediate and its breakdown and dissociation of the phosphate group. The aspartic acid in the WPD loop acts as a general acid to facilitate the nucleophilic attack in the first step by protonating the leaving group oxygen of the substrate and as a general base in the second step by deprotonating a water molecule that attacks the phosphocysteine group to release a phosphate ion (summarized in Fig. 1B) (18Zhang Z.

Crucially, WPD loop closure has been shown to be rate-determining for the reaction catalyzed by both the model phosphatase PTP1B and the highly active Yersinia YopH, suggesting that PTP activity can be regulated by controlling WPD loop kinetics (20Whittier S.K.

The promise of noncompetitive inhibitors of PTPs has ignited interest in the discovery of novel allosteric mechanisms for the regulation of RPTP activity; however, currently, the allosteric regulation of RPTP-D1 domains remains mostly undefined. For PTP1B, evidence is mounting for the presence of an extended allosteric network centered on helix α7, whose position is determined by subtle conformational shifts in its surrounding structural elements (α3, α6, and L11), which in turn affects WPD loop closure (29Cui D.S.

Here, to explore the possible allosteric regulation of RPTPα-D1, we report the first crystal structure of the cytoplasmic domain of RPTPα (D1D2). Through kinetic analysis and site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrate that D2 is able to inhibit D1 catalytic activity. Our data suggest D2-mediated restriction of D1-WPD loop function, and we validate our resulting inhibition model in HEK293T cells. Our model helps unravel the physiological function of RPTP-D2 domains and could pave the way to future discovery of allosteric inhibitors for RPTPα and potentially other D1+D2 RPTPs.

https://openalex.org/W3009335905,"Huwentoxin-IV (HwTx-IV) is a gating modifier peptide toxin from spiders that has weak affinity for the lipid bilayer. As some gating modifier toxins have affinity for model lipid bilayers, a tripartite relationship among gating modifier toxins, voltage-gated ion channels, and the lipid membrane surrounding the channels has been proposed. We previously designed an HwTx-IV analogue (gHwTx-IV) with reduced negative charge and increased hydrophobic surface profile, which displays increased lipid bilayer affinity and in vitro activity at the voltage-gated sodium channel subtype 1.7 (NaV1.7), a channel targeted in pain management. Here, we show that replacements of the positively-charged residues that contribute to the activity of the peptide can improve gHwTx-IV's potency and selectivity for NaV1.7. Using HwTx-IV, gHwTx-IV, [R26A]gHwTx-IV, [K27A]gHwTx-IV, and [R29A]gHwTx-IV variants, we examined their potency and selectivity at human NaV1.7 and their affinity for the lipid bilayer. [R26A]gHwTx-IV consistently displayed the most improved potency and selectivity for NaV1.7, examined alongside off-target NaVs, compared with HwTx-IV and gHwTx-IV. The lipid affinity of each of the three novel analogues was weaker than that of gHwTx-IV, but stronger than that of HwTx-IV, suggesting a possible relationship between in vitro potency at NaV1.7 and affinity for lipid bilayers. In a murine NaV1.7 engagement model, [R26A]gHwTx-IV exhibited an efficacy comparable with that of native HwTx-IV. In summary, this study reports the development of an HwTx-IV analogue with improved in vitro selectivity for the pain target NaV1.7 and with an in vivo efficacy similar to that of native HwTx-IV. Huwentoxin-IV (HwTx-IV) is a gating modifier peptide toxin from spiders that has weak affinity for the lipid bilayer. As some gating modifier toxins have affinity for model lipid bilayers, a tripartite relationship among gating modifier toxins, voltage-gated ion channels, and the lipid membrane surrounding the channels has been proposed. We previously designed an HwTx-IV analogue (gHwTx-IV) with reduced negative charge and increased hydrophobic surface profile, which displays increased lipid bilayer affinity and in vitro activity at the voltage-gated sodium channel subtype 1.7 (NaV1.7), a channel targeted in pain management. Here, we show that replacements of the positively-charged residues that contribute to the activity of the peptide can improve gHwTx-IV's potency and selectivity for NaV1.7. Using HwTx-IV, gHwTx-IV, [R26A]gHwTx-IV, [K27A]gHwTx-IV, and [R29A]gHwTx-IV variants, we examined their potency and selectivity at human NaV1.7 and their affinity for the lipid bilayer. [R26A]gHwTx-IV consistently displayed the most improved potency and selectivity for NaV1.7, examined alongside off-target NaVs, compared with HwTx-IV and gHwTx-IV. The lipid affinity of each of the three novel analogues was weaker than that of gHwTx-IV, but stronger than that of HwTx-IV, suggesting a possible relationship between in vitro potency at NaV1.7 and affinity for lipid bilayers. In a murine NaV1.7 engagement model, [R26A]gHwTx-IV exhibited an efficacy comparable with that of native HwTx-IV. In summary, this study reports the development of an HwTx-IV analogue with improved in vitro selectivity for the pain target NaV1.7 and with an in vivo efficacy similar to that of native HwTx-IV.

https://openalex.org/W3009569146,"Globally, the incidence of prostate cancer is increasing, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. It is the most common cancer among men worldwide, with higher mortality in low and middle-income countries. In Ethiopia, it is the second most common cause of cancer morbidity and mortality among men. Despite a few studies done regarding the disease burden, the evidence is scarce about the survival and prognostic determinants of prostate cancer patients in Ethiopia. Thus, this study assessed the survival and prognostic determinants of patients with prostate cancer.We retrospectively followed patients who were newly diagnosed from 2012 to 2016 at the Oncology Department of Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital. We extracted the data from patient charts that were available in the cancer registry using a checklist with the help of oncology nurses. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses with the log-rank test were used to estimate and compare the probability of survival among covariate categories. After checking for assumptions, a multivariable Cox regression analysis was performed to identify prognostic determinants of survival.The median survival time was 28 months with an overall 2-, 3- and 5-year survival of 57%, 38.9% and 22%, respectively. The overall survival differs according to the clinical stage (P-value<0.01), presence or absence of distant metastasis (P<0.01) and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (P<0.05). Cancer stage at diagnosis (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) = 0.309, 95%CI = 0.151-0.633) and ADT (AHR = 3.884, 95%CI = 1.677-8.997) remained significant in the final Cox proportional hazards model.The overall 2-, 3- and 5-year survival of prostate cancer patients in Ethiopia is very low. The cancer stage at diagnosis and treatment modalities are significant prognostic determinants of survival. Therefore, early detection through screening and timely initiation of treatment are essential to improve the survival of prostate cancer patients."

Plastome variation (in size and gene order) is rare in photosynthetic species but size variation, rearrangements and gene/intron losses is attributed to groups of seed plants.

The IRLC comprises 52 genera and ca 4000 species divided into seven tribes. In present study, we have sampled several representatives from each tribe across the IRLC from various herbaria and field. The ycf4 gene, which plays a role in regulating and assembly of photosystem I, is more variable in the tribe Fabeae than in other tribes. In certain species of Lathyrus, Pisum and Vavilovia, all belonging to Fabeae, the gene is either absent or a pseudogene. Our study suggests that ycf4 gene has undergone positive selection. Furthermore, the rapid evolution of the gene is locus and lineage specific and is not a shared character of the IRLC in legumes."

In this study, we recovered a novel GH26 enzyme with a CBM35 module linked to its N terminus (CrMan26) from a cattle rumen metatranscriptome. CrMan26 exhibited a preference for galactomannan as substrate and the crystal structure of the full-length protein at 1.85 Å resolution revealed a unique orientation of the ancillary domain relative to the catalytic interface, strategically positioning a surface aromatic cluster of the ancillary domain as an extension of the substrate-binding cleft, contributing to galactomannan preference. Moreover, systematic investigation of nonconserved residues in the catalytic interface unveiled that residues Tyr195 (−3 subsite) and Trp234 (−5 subsite) from distal negative subsites have a key role in galactomannan preference. These results indicate a novel and complex mechanism for substrate recognition involving spatially remote motifs, distal negative subsites from the catalytic domain, and a surface-associated aromatic cluster from the ancillary domain. These findings expand our molecular understanding of the mechanisms of substrate binding and recognition in the GH26 family and shed light on how some CBMs and their respective orientation can contribute to substrate preference. β-Mannanases from the glycoside hydrolase 26 (GH26) family are retaining hydrolases that are active on complex heteromannans and whose genes are abundant in rumen metagenomes and metatranscriptomes.

https://openalex.org/W3009155749,"Introduction Despite tobacco being an important preventable factor with respect to ill health and death, it is a legal substance that harms and kills many of those who use it. Text messaging smoking cessation interventions have been evaluated in a variety of contexts, and are generally considered to have a positive effect on smoking cessation success. In order for text messaging interventions to continue to be useful as prevalence of smoking decreases, it may be necessary to tailor the interventions to specific individuals. However, little is known with regard to who benefits the most and least from existing interventions. Methods In order to identify heterogenous treatment effects, we analyzed data from a randomized controlled trial of a text messaging smoking cessation intervention targeting university students in Sweden. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model where the outcome was modelled using logistic regression, and so-called horseshoe priors were used for coefficients. Predictive performance of the model, and heterogeneous treatment effects, were calculated using cross-validation over the trial data. Results Findings from the study of heterogenous treatment effects identified less effect of the intervention among university students with stronger dependence of nicotine and students who smoke a greater quantity of cigarettes per week. No heterogeneity was found with respect to sex, number of years smoking, or the use of snuff. Discussion Results emphasize that individuals with a more developed dependence of nicotine may have a harder time quitting smoking even with support. This questions the dissemination and development of text messaging interventions to university students in the future, as they may not be the optimal choice of intervention for those with a more developed dependence. On the other hand, text messaging interventions may be useful to disseminate among university students that are at risk of developing a strong dependence.

https://openalex.org/W3010006804,"Pedestrian dynamics models the walking movement of individuals in a crowd. It has recently been used in the analysis of procedures to reduce the risk of disease spread in airplanes, relying on the SPED model. This is a social force model inspired by molecular dynamics; pedestrians are treated as point particles, and their trajectories are determined in a simulation. A parameter sweep is performed to address uncertainties in human behavior, which requires a large number of simulations. The SPED model's slow speed is a bottleneck to performing a large parameter sweep. This is a severe impediment to delivering real-time results, which are often required in the course of decision meetings, especially during emergencies. We propose a new model, called CALM, to remove this limitation. It is designed to simulate a crowd's movement in constrained linear passageways, such as inside an aircraft. We show that CALM yields realistic results while improving performance by two orders of magnitude over the SPED model."

The aim of this study was to calculate the time lag between electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG) responses, to clarify the changes in the relationship between the cerebral cortex (CC) and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) during emotional recall processing. Twenty-two healthy young adults were examined. Their EEG and ECG data were simultaneously recorded during emotional audiovisual recall tasks using pleasant and unpleasant stimuli for 180 s, with three repetitions (Epochs 1 & 2 and Epoch 3). The EEG data were analyzed using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to obtain a time series of relative power spectra, XE, in the theta 1, theta 2, alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, beta 1, beta 2, and beta 3 bands. Time series of RR (inter-beat) intervals (time intervals between successive R waves) derived from the ECG spectral analysis using FFT was applied to the resampled time series of RR intervals over about 60 s to obtain a time series of power spectra for the ratio low frequency/high frequency (LH/HF), XC, which reflects the activity of the sympathetic nervous function. The time lag between XE and XC was calculated using wavelet-crosscorrelation analysis. The results demonstrated that the brain responded to unfamiliar emotionally pleasant stimuli in Epochs 1 & 2 earlier than the SNS, whereas the brain and SNS responded to unfamiliar unpleasant stimuli nearly simultaneously. The brain was activated rapidly in response to familiar unpleasant stimuli, although SNS responded more rapidly to familiar pleasant stimuli than the brain in Epoch 3. Our results quantitatively describe the relationship between the CC and the ANS during emotional recall."

In this study, using precultured embryo axes, and optimal co-cultivation conditions resulted in a successful transformation of the common bean cultivar Olathe using Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA105. Plant regeneration through somatic embryogenesis was attained through the preculture of embryo axes for 12 weeks using induced competent cells for A. tumefaciens-mediated gene delivery. Using A. tumefaciens at a low optical density (OD) of 0.1 at a wavelength of 600 nm for infection and 4-day co-cultivation, compared to OD600 of 0.5, increased the survival rate of the inoculated explants from 23% to 45%. Selection using 0.5 mg L-1 glufosinate (GS) was effective to identify transformed cells when the bialaphos resistance (bar) gene under the constitutive 35S promoter was used as a selectable marker. After an 18-week selection period, 1.5% -2.5% inoculated explants, in three experiments with a total of 600 explants, produced GS-resistant plants through somatic embryogenesis. The expression of bar was confirmed in first- and second-generation seedlings of the two lines through reverse polymerase chain reaction. Presence of the bar gene was verified through genome sequencing of two selected transgenic lines. The induction of regenerable, competent cells is key for the successful transformation, and the protocols described may be useful for future transformation of additional Phaseolus germplasm."

Indicators for the quality of antenatal care received include the timing (with respect to gestational age) and number of antenatal appointments attended, the delivery of antenatal services and health information, and women's perceptions about their care. This study investigated these indicators amongst women receiving antenatal care in predominantly the San Juan Bautista district of Iquitos, Loreto. This was to identify areas for improvement through comparison with antenatal guidelines published by the Ministry of Health, Peru, and the World Health Organization.A total of 134 women were recruited at the Centro de Salud, San Juan-a primary care centre in Iquitos. Information about the delivery of antenatal services and the number of and gestational ages at appointments attended was collected from 121/134 women's hand-held antenatal cards. The delivery of health information and women's perceptions about their antenatal care were investigated through questionnaires (133/134 completed). Descriptive statistics, such as frequencies and valid percentages, were determined.Hand-held antenatal cards revealed that 52.9% of participants began their antenatal care in the first trimester. Compared to national guidelines, 42.1% attended appointments at recommended gestational ages and no women received all recommended antenatal services. Most women received information about identifying complications in pregnancy and health and lifestyle topics. Over 85% of women reported satisfaction with their antenatal care.Timely antenatal attendance and delivery of services should be encouraged to meet national and global standards. Although all services were not delivered in a combined manner according to national guidelines, individual services were mostly delivered to a high standard and therefore a high proportion of women were satisfied with their antenatal care."
https://openalex.org/W3009755201,"In soil metal ecotoxicology research, dosing is usually performed with metal salts, followed by leaching to remove excess salinity. This process also removes some metals, affecting metal mixture ratios as different metals are removed by leaching at different rates. Consequently, alternative dosing methods must be considered for fixed ratio metal mixture research. In this study three different metal mixture dosing methods (nitrate, oxide and annealed metal dosing) were examined for metal concentrations and toxicity. In the nitrate metal dosing method leaching reduced total metal retention and was affected by soil pH and cation exchange capacity (CEC). Acidic soils 3.22 (pH 3.4, CEC 8 meq/100g) and WTRS (pH 4.6, CEC 16 meq/100g) lost more than 75 and 64% of their total metals to leaching respectively while Elora (6.7 pH, CEC 21 meq/100g) and KUBC (pH 5.6, CEC 28 meq/100g) with higher pH and CEC only lost 13.6% and 12.2% total metals respectively. Metal losses were highest for Ni, Zn and Co (46.0%, 63.7% and 48.4% metal loss respectively) whereas Pb and Cu (5.6% and 20.0% metal loss respectively) were mostly retained, affecting mixture ratios. Comparatively, oxide and annealed metal dosing which do not require leaching had higher total metal concentrations, closer to nominal doses and maintained better mixture ratios (percent of nominal concentrations for the oxide metal dosing were Pb = 109.9%, Cu = 84.6%, Ni = 101.9%, Zn = 82.3% and Co = 97.8% and for the annealed metal dosing were Pb = 81.7%, Cu = 80.3%, Ni = 100.5%, Zn = 89.2% and Co = 101.3%). Relative to their total metal concentrations, nitrate metal dosing (lowest metal concentrations) was the most toxic followed by metal oxides dosing while the annealed dosing method was generally non-toxic. Due to the lack of toxicity of the annealed metals and their higher dosing effort, metal oxides, are the most appropriate of the tested dosing methods, for fixed-ratio metal mixtures studies with soil invertebrates."

Kampo originated from traditional Chinese medicine, and was gradually adopted into a Japanese style. Although its effects on a variety of diseases are appreciated, the underlying mechanisms remain mostly unclear. Using a quantitative tf-LC3 system, we conducted a high-throughput screen of 128 kinds of Kampo to evaluate the effects on autophagy. The results revealed a suppressive effect of Shigyakusan/TJ-35 on autophagic activity. TJ-35 specifically suppressed dephosphorylation of ULK1 and TFEB, among several TORC1 substrates, in response to nutrient deprivation. TFEB was dephosphorylated by calcineurin in a Ca2+ dependent manner. Cytosolic Ca2+ concentration was increased in response to nutrient starvation, and TJ-35 suppressed this increase. Thus, TJ-35 prevents the starvation-induced Ca2+ increase, thereby suppressing induction of autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W3009076554,"Purpose To determine whether SRD5A2 promoter methylation is associated with cancer progression during androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in CRPC. Patients and methods In a Local CRPC cohort, 42 prostatic specimens were collected from patients who were diagnosed as CRPC and underwent transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). In a metastatic CRPC (Met CRPC) cohort, 12 metastatic biopsies were collected from CRPC patients who would be treated with abiraterone plus dutasteride (Clinical Trial NCT01393730). As controls, 36 benign prostatic specimens were collected from patients undergoing prostate reduction surgery for symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The methylation status of cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) site(s) at SRD5A2 promoter regions was tested. Results Compared with benign prostatic tissue, CRPC samples demonstrated higher SRD5A2 methylation in the whole promoter region (Local CRPC cohort: P < 0.001; Met CRPC cohort: P <0.05). In Local CRPC cohort, a higher ratio of methylation was correlated with better OS (R2 = 0.33, P = 0.013). Hypermethylation of specific regions (nucleotides -434 to -4 [CpG# -39 to CpG# -2]) was associated with a better OS (11.3±5.8 vs 6.4±4.4 years, P = 0.001) and PFS (8.4±5.4 vs 4.5±3.9 years, P = 0.003) with cutoff value of 37.9%. Multivariate analysis showed that SRD5A2 methylation was associated with OS independently (whole promoter region: P = 0.035; specific region: P = 0.02). Conclusion Our study demonstrate that SRD5A2 methylation in promoter regions, specifically at CpG# -39 to -2, is significantly associated with better survival for CRPC patients treated with ADT. Recognition of epigenetic modifications of SRD5A2 may affect the choices and sequence of available therapies for management of CRPC."

A sample of 300 was used with an equal number of men and women. Data from 50 of the respondents was collected online, whereas the rest was collected in person from universities. The 30-item Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ30) was used as a measure of five Moral Foundations, which are the basic elements of moral psychology as posited by Moral Foundations Theory. Men and women answered the questionnaire for themselves and then a second time, according to their perception of how a typical member of the other gender would respond which gave a measure of their stereotype. Comparison of actual scores of men and women revealed a statistically significant difference where women scored higher than men on the Harm foundation (p = 0.001). All other foundations, except for the Authority foundation showed the same pattern of differences as the previous literature, although they did not reach statistical significance. Stereotypes about men held by women were inaccurate underestimations on the Harm and Fairness foundations. The stereotype about women, held by men, was accurate on the Fairness foundation and inaccurate on the Authority foundation in the direction of underestimation. This research serves to further the study of Moral Foundations Theory as well as exploring the reasons behind the inaccurate moral stereotypes that men and women hold about each other, and actual gender differences in morality."
https://openalex.org/W3010080111,"Chaperones and autophagy are components of the protein quality control system that contribute to the management of proteins that are misfolded and aggregated. Here, we use yeast prions, which are self-perpetuating aggregating proteins, as a means to understand how these protein quality control systems influence aggregate loss. Chaperones, such as Hsp104, fragment prion aggregates to generate more prion seeds for propagation. While much is known about the role of chaperones, little is known about how other quality control systems contribute to prion propagation. We show that the aprotic solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) cures a range of [PSI+] prion variants, which are related to several misfolded aggregated conformations of the Sup35 protein. Our studies show that DMSO-mediated curing is quicker and more efficient than guanidine hydrochloride, a prion curing agent that inactivates the Hsp104 chaperone. Instead, DMSO appears to induce Hsp104 expression. Using the yTRAP system, a recently developed transcriptional reporting system for tracking protein solubility, we found that DMSO also rapidly induces the accumulation of soluble Sup35 protein, suggesting a potential link between Hsp104 expression and disassembly of Sup35 from the prion aggregate. However, DMSO-mediated curing appears to also be associated with other quality control systems. While the induction of autophagy alone does not lead to curing, we found that DMSO-mediated curing is dramatically impaired in autophagy related (atg) gene mutants, suggesting that other factors influence this DMSO mechanism of curing. Our data suggest that DMSO-mediated curing is not simply dependent upon Hsp104 overexpression alone, but may further depend upon other aspects of proteostasis."
https://openalex.org/W3009071565,"α-Klotho is a type 1 transmembrane protein that exhibits aging suppression function. The large amino-terminal extracellular domain of α-klotho is shed as soluble klotho (sKlotho) and functions as a circulating cardioprotective hormone. Diacylglycerol (DAG)-activated calcium-permeable TRPC6 channel plays a critical role in stress-induced cardiac remodeling. DAG activates TRPC6 by acting directly on the channel to increase its activity and by stimulation of channel exocytosis. sKlotho protects the heart by inhibiting DAG stimulation of TRPC6 exocytosis. How DAG stimulates TRPC6 exocytosis and thereby inhibition by sKlotho are unknown. Using a compound that directly activates TRPC6 without affecting channel exocytosis, we validate that sKlotho selectively blocks DAG stimulation of channel exocytosis. We further show that DAG stimulates exocytosis of TRPC6-containing vesicles pre-docked to the plasma membrane. Mnuc13 family proteins play important roles in the proper assembly of SNARE proteins and priming the vesicle competent for fusion. We show that DAG stimulates TRPC6 exocytosis by targeting to the C1 domain of Munc13-2. The results provide fresh insights into the molecular mechanism by which DAG regulates vesicle fusion and how sKlotho protects the heart against injury."
https://openalex.org/W3010576894,"Capture zone equations for a multi-well system in strip-shaped confined and unconfined aquifers with and without regional flow are presented. The aquifer is limited by two parallel boundaries that are either no flow (barrier) or inflow (variable head) so that aquifers with four possible boundary configurations are formed. The wellfield includes any number of extraction or injection wells or a combination of both types. The flow field in the strip-shaped aquifer was converted to its equivalent extensive aquifer using conformal mapping and image well methods. To delineate the capture envelope, the potential, streamline and stagnation point equations were derived using velocity potential theory. The solution permits rapid determination of the effect of number, position and extraction/injection rate of wells, boundary type and direction, and rate of regional flow on the size, shape and pattern of well capture zones. The derived equations are readily extended to water quality and quantity management simulations, as shown by embedding the equations within two optimization schemes, viz., Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA), to automatically determine the most efficient wellfield designs for pump-and-treat remediation, contaminant plume containment and pumping policy projects."

However, the identification of strong tissue-specific promoters is a challenge. In addition, information on cis elements that is able to repress gene expression in vegetative tissues remains limited. Here, we report that fusing a 35S enhancer to the stamen- and carpel-specific NtAGIP1 promoter derived from the tobacco AGAMOUS second intron (AGI) can significantly increase the promoter activity. Interestingly, although the activity of the new promoter extends to sepals and pedicles, it does not cross the boundary of the reproductive organs. Serial deletion of the AGI and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay reveal a 100-bp fragment that contains a conserved GAGA factor binding motif contributes to the flower specificity by mediating histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) modification of the promoter. Furthermore, this fragment shows significant suppressive effect on the activity of the 35S enhancer in vegetative tissues, consequently, resulting in a significant increase of the activity of 35S enhancer:AGI chimeric promoter without sacrifice of its specificity in inflorescence."

The cells patrol the bloodstream and wage war on pathogens, and their defensive role is so vital that people who lose their neutrophils in the course of cancer treatment can die from infections. But their scorched-earth tactics are tough on the body—their destructive enzymes kill microbes, but the compounds can also damage tissues or promote inflammation. The cells have been linked to heart disease, asthma, and other illnesses, leading researchers to try to target the cells for therapies. And a burst of new findings about the cells9 diversity and behavior is likely to inspire new ways to manipulate them. There is real hope in this field, one scientist says."
https://openalex.org/W3010251404,"Financial scams have caused tremendous financial damage globally. In Japan, the police forewarn people by equipping them with scam-prevention techniques or providing awareness regarding examples of previous scams; however, this does not appear to effectively prevent the damage, as many scam victims do not remember these warnings when faced with actual scam encounters. Considering that scammers often use appeal to emotion techniques, peripheral processing during scam attempts might disturb people’s abilities to recall the warnings on scammers’ modus operandi, thus leading to failed counter-arguing efforts. We verified this hypothesis in an experimental setting by asking 162 participants to remember given forewarnings and resist deceptive advertisements. The results showed that participants gave the advertisers’ manipulative intent a higher rating only when they processed the advertisement through a central route, in addition to being forewarned. This means that forewarning had no effect when participants processed the advertisement through a peripheral route. Moreover, forewarning recollection levels mediated the effect of processing route on this rating, which suggests that remembering forewarnings is necessary to generate counterarguments. This result expands the theory on forewarning effects and explains why people are susceptible to scam victimization. Furthermore, it provides implications for scam prevention."

However, recovering plant rhabdoviruses from cDNA remains difficult due to technical difficulties such as the need for concurrent in planta expression of the viral genome together with the viral nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) and viral genome instability in E. coli. Here, we developed a negative-sense minigenome cassette for Lettuce necrotic yellows virus (LNYV). We introduced introns into the unstable viral ORF and employed Agrobacterium tumefaciens to co-infiltrate Nicotiana with the genes for the N, P, and L proteins together with the minigenome cassette. The minigenome cassette included the Discosoma sp. red fluorescent protein gene (DsRed) cloned in the negative-sense between the viral trailer and leader sequences which were placed between hammerhead and hepatitis delta ribozymes. In planta DsRed expression was demonstrated by western blotting while the appropriate splicing of introduced introns was confirmed by sequencing of RT-PCR product."
https://openalex.org/W3010079184,"I stood behind the curtain, my hands shaking. As I listened to the crowd laugh at the host's jokes, all I could think was, “Why did I believe I could do this?” Two months earlier, I had signed up for improv classes at a local theater, along with four other grad students. We hoped that improv training—which involves acting out unscripted scenes—would improve our science communication skills. That sounded great in principle, and our program would pay the fees. But when the host gave us the cue to come on stage, I seriously wondered what I'd gotten myself into.



> “I feared getting on stage and improvising in front of strangers.” 

When I first heard about the improv classes, I was torn. As an introvert, I feared getting on stage and improvising in front of strangers. However, I knew I wanted to work as a science communicator after finishing my Ph.D., so it seemed like the perfect opportunity to improve my speaking ability and gain confidence thinking on my feet. I signed up, knowing the experience would take me well outside my comfort zone.

During our first class, we learned a core concept of improv: “yes, and.” It means that, as improvisers, we accept what fellow performers say. If someone says that rhinos are librarians, for example, then rhinos are librarians. We do not question the logic; we say “yes” and continue with the scene as if nothing is awry.

To do this effectively, our teacher warned us that we'd have to avoid second-guessing ourselves. Sometimes scenes go in unexpected directions. The best improv happens when performers stay open to different possibilities and say whatever pops into their minds.

I got a taste of how difficult that is when acting out my first scene. My classmate turned to me and said, “Mom is going to be so mad.” Mad about what? My mind spun out ideas, and my inner critic shot them all down. We broke the car? No, that's too easy. We failed a test? No, you don't want your classmates thinking you're stupid on the first day. I finally landed on an answer: “Yes, we're going to be late for dinner.” The scene proceeded from there, and we eventually finished as two sisters who lost their way on a hiking trail.

The first few scenes were hard, but as weeks turned into months, I became more comfortable thinking on my feet and even started to enjoy our classes. I never silenced my inner critic entirely, but over time, I didn't police my words with quite so much vigor. I also became better at listening, relating to my conversation partners, and communicating clearly in the moment.

That training came in handy 6 months ago, when I was giving a seminar about my science. An audience member surprised me with a question that didn't grow out of the information I'd presented. Instead of getting flustered, I implemented the “yes, and” approach—accepting the question at face value and letting my mind focus on why it was asked. That helped me shift gears and find an appropriate answer.

The benefits of improv go beyond communication. Early on in grad school, I would get stuck when my experiments generated unexpected data; my inner critic would assume I had made a mistake. But now, after embracing the “yes, and” concept, I no longer go into an experiment thinking that I already know the story my data are going to tell.

Last year, I used that approach after encountering confusing data. Instead of getting discouraged, I kept exploring the data and ended up identifying a new type of cell—one that wasn't behaving as expected. If I hadn't stayed open to the possibility that the results were real, I would have missed out on the most exciting finding of my Ph.D. so far.

All scientists can benefit from this lesson. If the data say rhinos are librarians, then it's worth investigating whether rhinos are, in fact, librarians. Our job as scientists isn't to generate data that support a preconceived story. Our job is to say “yes, and.”

As for that debut performance, I must admit that I cannot remember much of it. In front of the deafeningly loud crowd, it went by in a blur. But I do recall that when we left the stage, my face ached from grinning. That very night, I registered for the next level of classes—excited to discover what else I'd learn from improv."
https://openalex.org/W3010501823,"Frank Press, geophysicist and two-term president of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), died on 29 January. He was 95. This soft-spoken son of Jewish immigrants advised four U.S. presidents, built institutions to prominence, and provided the scientific guarantee for the nuclear test ban treaty. No scientist had more impact on the American science-policy interface in the late 20th century.



Born in Brooklyn, New York, Press earned his bachelor's degree in physics from City College of New York before completing a Ph.D. in geophysics at Columbia University with the famed geophysicist and oceanographer Maurice “Doc” Ewing in 1949. Press was appointed to the faculty of Columbia, where he developed the Press-Ewing seismometer and cofounded the Lamont Geological Observatory (now the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory). In 1955, he was recruited to the Seismological Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), where just 2 years later he succeeded its founder, Beno Gutenberg, to become the director, leapfrogging more senior seismologists. As a member of the international “Conference of Experts” in Geneva in 1958, Press convinced world leaders that a worldwide seismic network could be designed to monitor compliance with a nuclear test ban treaty. This assurance that such a treaty could be verified was instrumental to its ultimate success. At Caltech, Press championed the use of computers to digitize the increasing volume of seismic data. Along with colleagues, he used this processing power to make the first observational detection of the excitation of Earth's normal modes from the 1960 Chilean earthquake.

In 1965, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) recruited Press to head the Department of Geology and Geophysics. Press transformed the classical department into a modern-day Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences (now known as the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences), addressing the cutting-edge issues of the day. For Neil Armstrong's first walk on the Moon, Press designed a seismic experiment to passively detect moonquakes and asteroid impacts. The experiment returned the first information on the internal structure of the Moon and proved this concept for probing planetary interiors. The Joint Program between MIT and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution that educates graduate students in ocean sciences and engineering is one of Press's more successful innovations during his MIT years.

President Jimmy Carter appointed Press as his science adviser and director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy in 1977. By that time, Press was no stranger to Washington, D.C., policy circles. He had already served 3 years on the President's Science Advisory Committee under John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson and 6 years on the National Science Board under Richard Nixon. While in the White House, he championed federal investment in research and international cooperation. He created the first opportunities for Chinese students to study at U.S. universities, a cohort that grew to 100,000 young scholars in just 5 years.

In 1981, Press was elected president of the NAS. Despite what the research community viewed as the Reagan administration's assaults on science budgets, science-based policy, and the environment, Press managed to avoid politicizing the NAS and deftly piloted its advisory mission to new prominence by supplying unassailable advice based on science. For example, the Supreme Court ruled in the late 1980s that requiring creationism to be taught in public schools along with evolution was unconstitutional under the First Amendment, influenced by a NAS publication ( Science and Creationism , 1984) that pointed out that creationism is not supported by scientific evidence. In an environmental win, a report on acid rain ( Acid Deposition: Atmospheric Processes in Eastern North America , 1983) led the Reagan administration to cap the emissions of nitrogen dioxide. A year later, Congress amended the Clean Air Act to address sulfur dioxide emissions. Press was also a defender of the social sciences, stating that their research is evidence based and that they belong in the NAS.

Two high-profile consensus reports changed the course of the nation during Press's NAS tenure. Confronting AIDS (1986) spurred a reluctant administration to action to prevent HIV infections from becoming a nationwide public health epidemic. Within a few years, several African nations that did not act saw life expectancy fall. In 1988, Mapping and Sequencing the Human Genome launched a project that spawned multibillion-dollar industries and has contributed immeasurably to human health. In 2000, recognizing that Press had positioned the NAS as the most trusted adviser in science for policy, the NAS honored him as its first-ever “president emeritus.”

After his retirement from NAS in 1993, Press founded the Washington Advisory Group (WAG). WAG worked with, among others, the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology. Press and colleagues helped Saudi Arabia develop a first-class research university.

When Frank Press talked, people listened. I was one of those people. I was the final hire into “the department that Frank built” at MIT before he left to head the NAS. Later, he helped recruit me to lead the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute for an idyllic dozen years, where he served on the board. His office was my first stop for advice after being asked to lead the U.S. Geological Survey in 2009. I was wavering on accepting the Washington, D.C., position because it would require a long separation from my family in California. When Press learned that I would also be science adviser to the secretary of the interior, he was adamant that I accept. Press saw an important opportunity to ensure that science would have a direct route into Cabinet-level decisions. He made me realize that choices were no longer about me but rather what was best for the nation.

I also followed Press's advice to benefit from the fresh perspectives of new colleagues and a new mission by changing positions frequently. I could not be more fortunate to have had such an amazing mentor choose me. His passing is a loss not just for the nation but for the many he inspired."
