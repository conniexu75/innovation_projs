https://openalex.org/W2609844460,"In vitro models of the developing brain such as three-dimensional brain organoids offer an unprecedented opportunity to study aspects of human brain development and disease. However, the cells generated within organoids and the extent to which they recapitulate the regional complexity, cellular diversity and circuit functionality of the brain remain undefined. Here we analyse gene expression in over 80,000 individual cells isolated from 31 human brain organoids. We find that organoids can generate a broad diversity of cells, which are related to endogenous classes, including cells from the cerebral cortex and the retina. Organoids could be developed over extended periods (more than 9 months), allowing for the establishment of relatively mature features, including the formation of dendritic spines and spontaneously active neuronal networks. Finally, neuronal activity within organoids could be controlled using light stimulation of photosensitive cells, which may offer a way to probe the functionality of human neuronal circuits using physiological sensory stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2609473806,"The development of the nervous system involves a coordinated succession of events including the migration of GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric-acid-releasing) neurons from ventral to dorsal forebrain and their integration into cortical circuits. However, these interregional interactions have not yet been modelled with human cells. Here we generate three-dimensional spheroids from human pluripotent stem cells that resemble either the dorsal or ventral forebrain and contain cortical glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons. These subdomain-specific forebrain spheroids can be assembled in vitro to recapitulate the saltatory migration of interneurons observed in the fetal forebrain. Using this system, we find that in Timothy syndrome-a neurodevelopmental disorder that is caused by mutations in the CaV1.2 calcium channel-interneurons display abnormal migratory saltations. We also show that after migration, interneurons functionally integrate with glutamatergic neurons to form a microphysiological system. We anticipate that this approach will be useful for studying neural development and disease, and for deriving spheroids that resemble other brain regions to assemble circuits in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2609751917,"Mitochondrial calcium (mCa2+) has a central role in both metabolic regulation and cell death signalling, however its role in homeostatic function and disease is controversial. Slc8b1 encodes the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCLX), which is proposed to be the primary mechanism for mCa2+ extrusion in excitable cells. Here we show that tamoxifen-induced deletion of Slc8b1 in adult mouse hearts causes sudden death, with less than 13% of affected mice surviving after 14 days. Lethality correlated with severe myocardial dysfunction and fulminant heart failure. Mechanistically, cardiac pathology was attributed to mCa2+ overload driving increased generation of superoxide and necrotic cell death, which was rescued by genetic inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition pore activation. Corroborating these findings, overexpression of NCLX in the mouse heart by conditional transgenesis had the beneficial effect of augmenting mCa2+ clearance, preventing permeability transition and protecting against ischaemia-induced cardiomyocyte necrosis and heart failure. These results demonstrate the essential nature of mCa2+ efflux in cellular function and suggest that augmenting mCa2+ efflux may be a viable therapeutic strategy in disease."
https://openalex.org/W2608470234,"Nine neurodegenerative diseases are caused by expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts in different proteins, such as huntingtin in Huntington's disease and ataxin 3 in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3). Age at onset of disease decreases with increasing polyglutamine length in these proteins and the normal length also varies. PolyQ expansions drive pathogenesis in these diseases, as isolated polyQ tracts are toxic, and an N-terminal huntingtin fragment comprising exon 1, which occurs in vivo as a result of alternative splicing, causes toxicity. Although such mutant proteins are prone to aggregation, toxicity is also associated with soluble forms of the proteins. The function of the polyQ tracts in many normal cytoplasmic proteins is unclear. One such protein is the deubiquitinating enzyme ataxin 3 (refs 7, 8), which is widely expressed in the brain. Here we show that the polyQ domain enables wild-type ataxin 3 to interact with beclin 1, a key initiator of autophagy. This interaction allows the deubiquitinase activity of ataxin 3 to protect beclin 1 from proteasome-mediated degradation and thereby enables autophagy. Starvation-induced autophagy, which is regulated by beclin 1, was particularly inhibited in ataxin-3-depleted human cell lines and mouse primary neurons, and in vivo in mice. This activity of ataxin 3 and its polyQ-mediated interaction with beclin 1 was competed for by other soluble proteins with polyQ tracts in a length-dependent fashion. This competition resulted in impairment of starvation-induced autophagy in cells expressing mutant huntingtin exon 1, and this impairment was recapitulated in the brains of a mouse model of Huntington's disease and in cells from patients. A similar phenomenon was also seen with other polyQ disease proteins, including mutant ataxin 3 itself. Our data thus describe a specific function for a wild-type polyQ tract that is abrogated by a competing longer polyQ mutation in a disease protein, and identify a deleterious function of such mutations distinct from their propensity to aggregate."

https://openalex.org/W2609998953,"Interferon-γ acts on tumour endothelial cells to drive vascular regression, inducing ischaemia that leads to tumour collapse. Anti-tumour immune cells can elicit effects in tumours and stroma, but also in the blood vessels. Many of these effects are driven by secreted IFNγ, a cytokine with important functions in immunity. Using a combination of genetically engineered mouse models, the authors demonstrate that the effects of IFNγ on the vasculature is an important mediator of tumour clearance by the immune system. IFNγ-mediated tumour vascular remodelling resembles physiological processes, for example non-apoptotic blood vessel regression during wound healing, and induces early ischaemia that impairs the growth of tumour cells. The relative contribution of the effector molecules produced by T cells to tumour rejection is unclear, but interferon-γ (IFNγ) is critical in most of the analysed models1. Although IFNγ can impede tumour growth by acting directly on cancer cells2,3, it must also act on the tumour stroma for effective rejection of large, established tumours4,5. However, which stroma cells respond to IFNγ and by which mechanism IFNγ contributes to tumour rejection through stromal targeting have remained unknown. Here we use a model of IFNγ induction and an IFNγ–GFP fusion protein in large, vascularized tumours growing in mice that express the IFNγ receptor exclusively in defined cell types. Responsiveness to IFNγ by myeloid cells and other haematopoietic cells, including T cells or fibroblasts, was not sufficient for IFNγ-induced tumour regression, whereas responsiveness of endothelial cells to IFNγ was necessary and sufficient. Intravital microscopy revealed IFNγ-induced regression of the tumour vasculature, resulting in arrest of blood flow and subsequent collapse of tumours, similar to non-haemorrhagic necrosis in ischaemia and unlike haemorrhagic necrosis induced by tumour necrosis factor. The early events of IFNγ-induced tumour ischaemia resemble non-apoptotic blood vessel regression during development, wound healing or IFNγ-mediated, pregnancy-induced remodelling of uterine arteries6,7,8. A better mechanistic understanding of how solid tumours are rejected may aid the design of more effective protocols for adoptive T-cell therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2608541709,"Molecular analysis of environmental DNA (eDNA) can be used to assess vertebrate biodiversity in aquatic systems, but limited work has applied eDNA technologies to marine waters. Further, there is limited understanding of the spatial distribution of vertebrate eDNA in marine waters. Here, we use an eDNA metabarcoding approach to target and amplify a hypervariable region of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene to characterize vertebrate communities at 10 oceanographic stations spanning 45 km within the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary (MBNMS). In this study, we collected three biological replicates of small volume water samples (1 L) at 2 depths at each of the 10 stations. We amplified fish mitochondrial DNA using a universal primer set. We obtained 5,644,299 high quality Illumina sequence reads from the environmental samples. The sequence reads were annotated to the lowest taxonomic assignment using a bioinformatics pipeline. The eDNA survey identified, to the lowest taxonomic rank, 7 families, 3 subfamilies, 10 genera, and 72 species of vertebrates at the study sites. These 92 distinct taxa come from 33 unique marine vertebrate families. We observed significantly different vertebrate community composition between sampling depths (0 m and 20/40 m deep) across all stations and significantly different communities at stations located on the continental shelf (<200 m bottom depth) versus in the deeper waters of the canyons of Monterey Bay (>200 m bottom depth). All but 1 family identified using eDNA metabarcoding is known to occur in MBNMS. The study informs the implementation of eDNA metabarcoding for vertebrate biomonitoring."
https://openalex.org/W2609602214,"Netrin-1 is an evolutionarily conserved, secreted extracellular matrix protein involved in axon guidance at the central nervous system midline. Netrin-1 is expressed by cells localized at the central nervous system midline, such as those of the floor plate in vertebrate embryos. Growth cone turning assays and three-dimensional gel diffusion assays have shown that netrin-1 can attract commissural axons. Loss-of-function experiments further demonstrated that commissural axon extension to the midline is severely impaired in the absence of netrin-1 (refs 3, 7, 8, 9). Together, these data have long supported a model in which commissural axons are attracted by a netrin-1 gradient diffusing from the midline. Here we selectively ablate netrin-1 expression in floor-plate cells using a Ntn1 conditional knockout mouse line. We find that hindbrain and spinal cord commissural axons develop normally in the absence of floor-plate-derived netrin-1. Furthermore, we show that netrin-1 is highly expressed by cells in the ventricular zone, which can release netrin-1 at the pial surface where it binds to commissural axons. Notably, Ntn1 deletion from the ventricular zone phenocopies commissural axon guidance defects previously described in Ntn1-knockout mice. These results show that the classical view that attraction of commissural axons is mediated by a gradient of floor-plate-derived netrin-1 is inaccurate and that netrin-1 primarily acts locally by promoting growth cone adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2609660872,"Cannabis use is associated with reduced prevalence of obesity and diabetes mellitus (DM) in humans and mouse disease models. Obesity and DM are a well-established independent risk factor for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most prevalent liver disease globally. The effects of cannabis use on NAFLD prevalence in humans remains ill-defined. Our objective is to determine the relationship between cannabis use and the prevalence of NAFLD in humans. We conducted a population-based case-control study of 5,950,391 patients using the 2014 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), Nationwide Inpatient Survey (NIS) discharge records of patients 18 years and older. After identifying patients with NAFLD (1% of all patients), we next identified three exposure groups: non-cannabis users (98.04%), non-dependent cannabis users (1.74%), and dependent cannabis users (0.22%). We adjusted for potential demographics and patient related confounders and used multivariate logistic regression (SAS 9.4) to determine the odds of developing NAFLD with respects to cannabis use. Our findings revealed that cannabis users (dependent and non-dependent) showed significantly lower NAFLD prevalence compared to non-users (AOR: 0.82[0.76–0.88]; p<0.0001). The prevalence of NAFLD was 15% lower in non-dependent users (AOR: 0.85[0.79–0.92]; p<0.0001) and 52% lower in dependent users (AOR: 0.49[0.36–0.65]; p<0.0001). Among cannabis users, dependent patients had 43% significantly lower prevalence of NAFLD compared to non-dependent patients (AOR: 0.57[0.42–0.77]; p<0.0001). Our observations suggest that cannabis use is associated with lower prevalence of NAFLD in patients. These novel findings suggest additional molecular mechanistic studies to explore the potential role of cannabis use in NAFLD development."
https://openalex.org/W2609007680,"Several studies have now shown evidence of association between common genetic variants and quantitative facial traits in humans. The reported associations generally involve simple univariate measures and likely represent only a small fraction of the genetic loci influencing facial morphology. In this study, we applied factor analysis to a set of 276 facial linear distances derived from 3D facial surface images of 2187 unrelated individuals of European ancestry. We retained 23 facial factors, which we then tested for genetic associations using a genome-wide panel of 10,677,593 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In total, we identified genome-wide significant (p < 5 × 10-8) associations in three regions, including two that are novel: one involving measures of midface height at 6q26 within an intron of PARK2 (lead SNP rs9456748; p = 4.99 × 10-8) and another involving measures of central upper lip height at 9p22 within FREM1 (lead SNP rs72713618; p = 2.02 × 10-8). In both cases, the genetic association was stronger with the composite facial factor phenotype than with any of the individual linear distances that comprise those factors. While the biological role of PARK2 in the craniofacial complex is currently unclear, there is evidence from both mouse models and Mendelian syndromes that FREM1 may influence facial variation. These results highlight the potential value of data-driven multivariate phenotyping for genetic studies of human facial morphology."
https://openalex.org/W2609008020,"Cardiolipin (CL) is a dimeric phospholipid with critical roles in mitochondrial bioenergetics and signaling. Recently, inhibition of the release of oxidized fatty acyl chains from CL by the calcium-independent phospholipase A2γ (iPLA2γ)-selective inhibitor (R)-BEL suggested that iPLA2γ is responsible for the hydrolysis of oxidized CL and subsequent signaling mediated by the released oxidized fatty acids. However, chemical inhibition by BEL is subject to off-target pharmacologic effects. Accordingly, to unambiguously determine the role of iPLA2γ in the hydrolysis of oxidized CL, we compared alterations in oxidized CLs and the release of oxidized aliphatic chains from CL in experiments with purified recombinant iPLA2γ, germ-line iPLA2γ−/− mice, cardiac myocyte-specific iPLA2γ transgenic mice, and wild-type mice. Using charge-switch high mass accuracy LC-MS/MS with selected reaction monitoring and product ion accurate masses, we demonstrated that iPLA2γ is the major enzyme responsible for the release of oxidized aliphatic chains from CL. Our results also indicated that iPLA2γ selectively hydrolyzes 9-hydroxy-octadecenoic acid in comparison to 13-hydroxy-octadecenoic acid from oxidized CLs. Moreover, oxidative stress (ADP, NADPH, and Fe3+) resulted in the robust production of oxidized CLs in intact mitochondria from iPLA2γ−/− mice. In sharp contrast, oxidized CLs were readily hydrolyzed in mitochondria from wild-type mice during oxidative stress. Finally, we demonstrated that CL activates the iPLA2γ-mediated hydrolysis of arachidonic acid from phosphatidylcholine, thereby integrating the production of lipid messengers from different lipid classes in mitochondria. Collectively, these results demonstrate the integrated roles of CL and iPLA2γ in lipid second-messenger production and mitochondrial bioenergetics during oxidative stress.

Two series of rRFs (rRF5 and rRF3) were precisely aligned to the 5' and 3' ends of the 5.8S and 28S rRNA gene. The rRF5 and rRF3 series were significantly more highly expressed than the rRFs located in the body of the rRNA genes. These series contained perfectly aligned reads, the lengths of which varied progressively with 1-bp differences. The rRF5 and rRF3 series in the same expression pattern exist ubiquitously from ticks to human. The cellular experiments showed the RNAi knockdown of one 20-nt rRF3 induced the cell apoptosis and inhibited the cell proliferation. In addition, the RNAi knockdown resulted in a significant decrease of H1299 cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. These results indicated the rRF5 and rRF3 series were not random intermediates or products during rRNA degradation, but could constitute a new class of small RNAs that deserves further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2608960445,"Gangliosides (sialylated glycolipids) play an essential role in the CNS by regulating recognition and signaling in neurons. Metabolic blocks in processing and catabolism of gangliosides result in the development of severe neurologic disorders, including gangliosidoses manifesting with neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. We demonstrate that 2 mammalian enzymes, neuraminidases 3 and 4, play important roles in catabolic processing of brain gangliosides by cleaving terminal sialic acid residues in their glycan chains. In neuraminidase 3 and 4 double-knockout mice, GM3 ganglioside is stored in microglia, vascular pericytes, and neurons, causing micro- and astrogliosis, neuroinflammation, accumulation of lipofuscin bodies, and memory loss, whereas their cortical and hippocampal neurons have lower rate of neuritogenesis in vitro. Double-knockout mice also have reduced levels of GM1 ganglioside and myelin in neuronal axons. Furthermore, neuraminidase 3 deficiency drastically increased storage of GM2 in the brain tissues of an asymptomatic mouse model of Tay-Sachs disease, a severe human gangliosidosis, indicating that this enzyme is responsible for the metabolic bypass of β-hexosaminidase A deficiency. Together, our results provide the first in vivo evidence that neuraminidases 3 and 4 have important roles in CNS function by catabolizing gangliosides and preventing their storage in lipofuscin bodies.—Pan, X., De Britto Pará De Aragão, C., Velasco-Martin, J.

https://openalex.org/W2608524463,"Histone modifications, including lysine methylation, are epigenetic marks that influence many biological pathways. Accordingly, many methyltransferases have critical roles in various biological processes, and their dysregulation is often associated with cancer. However, the biological functions and regulation of many methyltransferases are unclear. Here, we report that a human homolog of the methyltransferase SET (SU(var), enhancer of zeste, and trithorax) domain containing 3 (SETD3) is cell cycle-regulated; SETD3 protein levels peaked in S phase and were lowest in M phase. We found that the β-isoform of the tumor suppressor F-box and WD repeat domain containing 7 (FBXW7β) specifically mediates SETD3 degradation. Aligning the SETD3 sequence with those of well known FBXW7 substrates, we identified six potential non-canonical Cdc4 phosphodegrons (CPDs), and one of them, CPD1, is primarily phosphorylated by the kinase glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3β), which is required for FBXW7β-mediated recognition and degradation. Moreover, depletion or inhibition of GSK3β or FBXW7β resulted in elevated SETD3 levels. Mutations of the phosphorylated residues in CPD1 of SETD3 abolished the interaction between FBXW7β and SETD3 and prevented SETD3 degradation. Our data further indicated that SETD3 levels positively correlated with cell proliferation of liver cancer cells and liver tumorigenesis in a xenograft mouse model, and that overexpression of FBXW7β counteracts the SETD3's tumorigenic role. We also show that SETD3 levels correlate with cancer malignancy, indicated by SETD3 levels that the 54 liver tumors are 2-fold higher than those in the relevant adjacent tissues.

https://openalex.org/W2608740477,"Recent evidence suggests that specialized proresolving lipid mediators (SPMs) generated from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) can modulate the vascular injury response. However, cellular sources for these autacoids within the vessel wall remain unclear. Here, we investigated whether isolated vascular cells and tissues can produce SPMs and assessed expression and subcellular localization of the key SPM biosynthetic enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (LOX) in vascular cells. Intact human arteries incubated with DHA ex vivo produced 17-hydroxy DHA (17-HDHA) and D-series resolvins, as assessed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Addition of 17-HDHA to human arteries similarly increased resolvin production. Primary cultures of human saphenous vein endothelial cells (ECs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) converted 17-HDHA to SPMs, including resolvin D1 (RvD1) and other D-series resolvins and protectins. This was accompanied by a rapid translocation of 5-LOX from nucleus to cytoplasm in both ECs and VSMCs, potentially facilitating SPM biosynthesis. Conditioned medium from cells exposed to 17-HDHA inhibited monocyte adhesion to TNF-α-stimulated EC monolayers. These downstream effects were partially reversed by antibodies against the RvD1 receptors ALX/FPR2 and GPR32.

https://openalex.org/W2607957999,"The 26S proteasome is a large cellular assembly that mediates the selective degradation of proteins in the nucleus and cytosol and is an established target for anticancer therapeutics. Protein substrates are typically targeted to the proteasome through modification with a polyubiquitin chain, which can be recognized by several proteasome-associated ubiquitin receptors. One of these receptors, RPN13/ADRM1, is recruited to the proteasome through direct interaction with the large scaffolding protein RPN2 within the 19S regulatory particle. To better understand the interactions between RPN13, RPN2, and ubiquitin, we used human proteins to map the RPN13-binding epitope to the C-terminal 14 residues of RPN2, which, like ubiquitin, binds the N-terminal pleckstrin-like receptor of ubiquitin (PRU) domain of RPN13. We also report the crystal structures of the RPN13 PRU domain in complex with peptides corresponding to the RPN2 C terminus and ubiquitin. Through mutational analysis, we validated the RPN2-binding interface revealed by our structures and quantified binding interactions with surface plasmon resonance and fluorescence polarization. In contrast to a previous report, we find that RPN13 binds ubiquitin with an affinity similar to that of other proteasome-associated ubiquitin receptors and that RPN2, ubiquitin, and the deubiquitylase UCH37 bind to RPN13 with independent energetics. These findings provide a detailed characterization of interactions that are important for proteasome function, indicate ubiquitin affinities that are consistent with the role of RPN13 as a proteasomal ubiquitin receptor, and have major implications for the development of novel anticancer therapeutics."

Clinical data from 251 SLE patients with 263 pregnancies from 2001 to 2015 were analyzed retrospectively. APOs occurred in 70.0% of pregnancies, in which pregnancy loss occurred in 28.5%; preterm delivery occurred in 21.3%; intrauterine growth retardation occurred in 12.2%; and fetal distress occurred in 8.0%. Over time, the rate of APOs decreased from 82.8% during 2001~2005 to 59.6% during 2011~2015. In multivariate analysis, predictors of APOs included positive antiphospholipid antibodies (OR 8.4, 95% CI 1.7~40.8, P = 0.008), lower complement (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.3~9.9, P = 0.01), hypoalbuminemia (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.2~8.3, P = 0.02), and hypertension (OR 14.6, 95% CI 1.5~141.6, P = 0.02).

https://openalex.org/W2609136296,"Functional diversity represents a measure of diversity that incorporates the role of species in an ecosystem, and therefore its dynamics and resilience. Assessing its drivers and spatial variation represents an important step forward in our understanding of functional ecosystem dynamics and it is also necessary to achieve a comprehensive conservation planning. In this paper, we assessed mammal functional diversity for the 218 ecoregions within the Neotropical realm. We evaluated the overall influence and spatial variation of species richness, ecoregion extent, intervention and species at risk on functional diversity. Using ordinary least squares and geographically weighted regression modeling approaches, we found that intervened areas and threatened and non-threatened species are the most influential overall drivers of functional diversity. However, we also detected that these variables do not operate equally across scales. Our local analyses indicated both that the variation explained and local coefficients vary spatially depending on the ecoregion and major habitat type. As estimates of functional diversity are based on current distribution of all mammals, negative influence of intervened areas and positive influence of non-threatened species may reflect a potential degradation of functional processes for some ecosystems. Most generally, the negative influence of intervention together with the influence of threatened species indicates that some areas are currently more susceptible to functional diversity loss. Our results help to pinpoint key areas requiring urgent conservation action to reduce natural land-cover loss and areas where threatened species play influential roles on ecosystem functioning."
https://openalex.org/W2609731556,"Beta adrenergic receptors (βARs) are G-protein-coupled receptors essential for physiological responses to the hormones/neurotransmitters epinephrine and norepinephrine which are found in the nervous system and throughout the body. They are the targets of numerous widely used drugs, especially in the case of the most extensively studied βAR, β2AR, whose ligands are used for asthma and cardiovascular disease. βARs signal through Gαs G-proteins and via activation of adenylyl cyclase and cAMP-dependent protein kinase, but some alternative downstream pathways have also been proposed that could be important for understanding normal physiological functioning of βAR signaling and its disruption in disease. Using fluorescence-based Ca2+ flux assays combined with pharmacology and gene knock-out methods, we discovered a previously unrecognized endogenous pathway in HEK-293 cells whereby β2AR activation leads to robust Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores via activation of phospholipase C and opening of inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) receptors. This pathway did not involve cAMP, Gαs, or Gαi or the participation of the other members of the canonical β2AR signaling cascade and, therefore, constitutes a novel signaling mechanism for this receptor. This newly uncovered mechanism for Ca2+ mobilization by β2AR has broad implications for adrenergic signaling, cross-talk with other signaling pathways, and the effects of βAR-directed drugs."

Here, we describe the revised Social Norm Processing Task (SNPT-R), a paradigm enabling the study of behavioral and neural responses to intended and unintended social norm violations among both adults and adolescents. We investigated how participants (adolescents and adults, n = 87) rate intentional and unintentional social norm violations with respect to inappropriateness and embarrassment, and we examined the brain activation patterns underlying the processing of these transgressions in an independent sample of 21 adults using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). We hypothesized to find activation within the medial prefrontal cortex, temporo-parietal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex in response to both intentional and unintentional social norm violations, with more pronounced activation for the intentional social norm violations in these regions and in the amygdala. Participants’ ratings confirmed the hypothesis that the three types of stories are evaluated differently with respect to intentionality: intentional social norm violations were rated as the most inappropriate and most embarrassing. Furthermore, fMRI results showed that reading stories on intentional and unintentional social norm violations evoked activation within the frontal pole, the paracingulate gyrus and the superior frontal gyrus. In addition, processing unintentional social norm violations was associated with activation in, among others, the orbitofrontal cortex, middle frontal gyrus and superior parietal lobule, while reading intentional social norm violations was related to activation in the left amygdala. These regions have been previously implicated in thinking about one’s self, thinking about others and moral reasoning. Together, these findings indicate that the SNPT-R could serve as a useful paradigm for examining social norm processing, both at the behavioral and the neural level."

All patients provided written informed consent to be treated by SBRT, and prior to inclusion they authorized use of the treatment data for further studies. The assessment was made using MRI, with determination of local and hepatic responses according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and modified RECIST (mRECIST) criteria during a two-year follow-up.The local response rate according to mRECIST was higher than with RECIST. A tumor diameter less than 20 mm at baseline was an independent predictive factor for RECIST and mRECIST responses, as was diffusion-weighted signal for RECIST. During follow-up, a tumor diameter of <20 mm (p = 0.034) and absence of a high intensity on T2-weighted (p = 0.006) and diffusion-weighted images (p = 0.039) were associated with a better response according to RECIST. Post-treatment changes include peritumoral ring-like enhanced changes with high intensity on T2-weighted images.SBRT is a promising technique for the treatment of inoperable HCC. Post-treatment changes on MRI images can resemble tumor progression and as such must be adequately distinguished. The regression of tumorous enhancement is variable over time, although diffusion-weighted and T2-weighted intensities are predictive factors for tumor RECIST responses on subsequent MRIs. They hence provide a way to reliably predict treatment responses."
https://openalex.org/W2609433848,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a significant contributor to recalcitrant multidrug-resistant infections, especially in immunocompromised and hospitalized patients. The pathogenic profile of P. aeruginosa is related to its ability to secrete a variety of virulence factors and to promote biofilm formation. Quorum sensing (QS) is a mechanism wherein P. aeruginosa secretes small diffusible molecules, specifically acyl homo serine lactones, such as N-(3-oxo-dodecanoyl)l-homoserine lactone (3O-C12-HSL), that promote biofilm formation and virulence via interbacterial communication. Strategies that strengthen the host's ability to inhibit bacterial virulence would enhance host defenses and improve the treatment of resistant infections. We have recently shown that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g (PPARg) agonists are potent immunostimulators that play a pivotal role in host response to virulent P. aeruginosa. Here, we show that QS genes in P. aeruginosa (strain PAO1) and 3O-C12-HSL attenuate PPARg expression in bronchial epithelial cells. PAO1 and 3O-C12-HSL induce barrier derangements in bronchial epithelial cells by lowering the expression of junctional proteins, such as zonula occludens-1, occludin, and claudin-4. Expression of these proteins was restored in cells that were treated with pioglitazone, a PPARg agonist, before infection with PAO1 and 3O-C12-HSL. Barrier function and bacterial permeation studies that have been performed in primary human epithelial cells showed that PPARg agonists are able to restore barrier integrity and function that are disrupted by PAO1 and 3O-C12-HSL. Mechanistically, we show that these effects are dependent on the induction of paraoxonase-2, a QS hydrolyzing enzyme, that mitigates the effects of QS molecules. Importantly, our data show that pioglitazone, a PPARg agonist, significantly inhibits biofilm formation on epithelial cells by a mechanism that is mediated via paraoxonase-2. These findings elucidate a novel role for PPARg in host defense against P. aeruginosa. Strategies that activate PPARg can provide a therapeutic complement for treatment of resistant P. aeruginosa infections.—Bedi, B., Maurice, N. M., Ciavatta, V. T., Lynn, K. S., Yuan, Z., Molina, S.

Dendritic spines are protrusions on the dendritic arbors of the postsynaptic neuron where the majority of excitatory neurotransmission occurs. The morphology of dendritic spines is heterogeneous and can be classified into three main categories: the short stubby spines; the thin spines with elongated necks and small heads; and the mushroom-shaped spines with larger heads (1Bourne J.N.

In addition, there are long and thin filopodia, which are thought to represent either the precursors of dendritic spines during synaptogenesis (3Ziv N.E. Smith S.J.

The importance of synaptic activity in refining neuronal connectivity in vivo was also demonstrated by intravital imaging of neurons in live animals, where sensory experience affects the turnover of dendritic spines in the cerebral cortex (16Rochefort N.L. Konnerth A. Dendritic spines: from structure to in vivo function.EMBO Rep. 2012; 13: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the two types of ionotropic glutamate receptors, namely α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, have distinct roles in the regulation of spine morphogenesis. Whereas pharmacological blockade of AMPA receptor affects dendritic spine maintenance and results in spine loss (13McKinney R.A. Capogna M. Dürr R. Gähwiler B.H. Thompson S.M.

Neurosci. 1999; 2: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Because different subtypes of dendritic spines can be regulated independently (19Spiga S. Talani G. Mulas G. Licheri V. Fois G.R. Muggironi G. Masala N. Cannizzaro C. Biggio G. Sanna E. Diana M. Hampered long-term depression and thin spine loss in the nucleus accumbens of ethanol-dependent rats.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: E3745-E3754Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), it is plausible that spontaneous activation of NMDA receptor might selectively promote the maintenance of mushroom spines as well as suppress the formation of thin spines and filopodia. Nonetheless, despite numerous studies elucidating the mechanisms that underlie dendritic spine morphogenesis, little is known about the molecular basis of how dendritic spines with different morphologies are selectively maintained and eliminated. The presence of polyribosomes and a specific subset of mRNA transcripts near dendritic spines allows local protein synthesis to occur rapidly in response to synaptic activities. Multiple lines of evidence suggests that dendritic protein synthesis could play a crucial role in the regulation of spine morphology and maturation. For example, an increased number of filopodia is observed in neurons lacking the RNA-binding protein FMRP, which is associated with impaired dendritic RNA transport and aberrant local mRNA translation (20Dictenberg J.B. Swanger S.A. Antar L.N. Singer R.H. Bassell G.J. A direct role for FMRP in activity-dependent dendritic mRNA transport links filopodial-spine morphogenesis to fragile X syndrome.Dev.

Notably, neurons carrying the mutated 3′-untranslated region of the Bdnf gene and hence the deficit in dendritic targeting of the Bdnf mRNA exhibit abnormal spine density and morphology (24An J.J.

Early studies have identified ∼350 mRNA transcripts in neuronal processes (26Lein E.S. Hawrylycz M.J. Ao N. Ayres M. Bensinger A. Bernard A. Boe A.F. Boguski M.S. Brockway K.S. Byrnes E.J. Chen L.

Dendritic mRNAs encode diversified functionalities in hippocampal pyramidal neurons.BMC Neurosci. 2006; 7: 17Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), but a recent study using RNA sequencing has indicated the presence of a much more extensive transcriptome in the hippocampal neuropil, with 2,250 mRNA transcripts being identified (29Cajigas I.J. Tushev G. Will T.J. tom Dieck S. Fuerst N. Schuman E.M. The local transcriptome in the synaptic neuropil revealed by deep sequencing and high-resolution imaging.Neuron. 2012; 74: 453-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Importantly, many of these mRNAs encode proteins that have unknown function in neuron. Characterizing these dendritic mRNA transcripts, which may undergo translation in response to synaptic activity, should potentially identify novel mechanisms in the activity-dependent control of dendritic spine morphology. One of the transcripts in the hippocampal neuropil identified by Cajigas et al. (29Cajigas I.J. Tushev G. Will T.J. tom Dieck S. Fuerst N. Schuman E.M. The local transcriptome in the synaptic neuropil revealed by deep sequencing and high-resolution imaging.Neuron. 2012; 74: 453-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) was the mRNA encoding STRN4 (also called zinedin). STRN4 is a multidomain scaffold protein that belongs to the striatin family, which also includes STRN1 (also called striatin) and STRN3 (also called SG2NA). The striatin family is characterized by the presence of four protein-protein interaction domains, namely the caveolin-binding domain, coiled-coil domain, Ca2+-calmodulin (CaM)-binding domain, and tryptophan-aspartate (WD)-repeat domain (30Benoist M. Gaillard S. Castets F. The striatin family: a new signaling platform in dendritic spines.J. Physiol. Paris. 2006; 99: 146-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). All three striatin family members are predominantly expressed in the central nervous system and are present in dendritic spines (31Benoist M. Baude A. Tasmadjian A. Dargent B. Kessler J.P. Castets F. Distribution of zinedin in the rat brain.J. Neurochem. 2008; 106: 969-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 32Gaillard S. Bailly Y. Benoist M. Rakitina T. Kessler J.P.

Targeting of proteins of the striatin family to dendritic spines: role of the coiled-coil domain.Traffic. 2006; 7: 74-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Many interacting partners of the striatin scaffold proteins have been identified. Unlike many synaptic scaffold proteins that bind to ion channels and other scaffolding networks, the interacting proteins of the striatin family identified thus far are mostly signaling proteins, including multiple kinases such as members of the germinal center kinase family (MST3, MST4, and YSK1), NCK-interacting kinase (NIK), and TRAF2- and NCK-interacting kinase (TNIK) (33Hwang J. Pallas D.C. STRIPAK complexes: structure, biological function, and involvement in human diseases.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2014; 47: 118-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The protein complex, named striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK), might therefore act as a signaling hub at the plasma membrane to regulate multiple cellular functions, rather than providing a structural scaffold in organizing the postsynaptic density. The STRIPAK complex also contains the phosphatase PP2A, and it has been suggested that the presence of PP2A maintains the activity of the various kinases within the complex under control by direct dephosphorylation (33Hwang J. Pallas D.C. STRIPAK complexes: structure, biological function, and involvement in human diseases.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2014; 47: 118-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 34Gordon J.

Notably, despite information on their subcellular localization and interacting proteins, the function of striatin family proteins in neuron remains unknown. Dysfunction of some of the STRIPAK components, including MST3 and cortactin-binding protein 2 (CTTNBP2), are linked to ASD (35Chen Y.-K. Chen C.-Y. Hu H.-T. Hsueh Y.-P.

Given the association between altered spine morphology and ASD, we hypothesize that STRN4 might represent a novel key protein in the control of spine morphology, and impaired function of the STRIPAK complex might contribute to the altered neuronal connectivity in autism. Here, we provide evidence for a new regulatory mechanism for spine morphology that involves local dendritic expression of STRN4 driven by the NMDA receptor. As a first step to understand the function of STRN4 in synapse development, we examine the expression of Strn4 mRNA and protein in the neuron as well as their regulation by synaptic activity. A previous large-scale transcriptome study revealed that Strn4 mRNA is one of the transcripts detected in the hippocampal neuropil (29Cajigas I.J. Tushev G. Will T.J. tom Dieck S. Fuerst N. Schuman E.M. The local transcriptome in the synaptic neuropil revealed by deep sequencing and high-resolution imaging.Neuron. 2012; 74: 453-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). We verified the dendritic localization of Strn4 mRNA in dissociated hippocampal neurons by high-resolution and sensitive fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) as described by previous studies (29Cajigas I.J. Tushev G. Will T.J. tom Dieck S. Fuerst N. Schuman E.M.

Neurosci. 2009; 29: 4697-4707Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Using a set of antisense oligonucleotide probes targeting STRN4 in FISH followed by immunocytochemistry with antibody against the somatodendritic marker MAP2, we found that Strn4 mRNA existed as distinct puncta that were detected not only in the cell soma but also in distal dendrites (Fig. 1A). The puncta on dendrites were absent when neurons were hybridized with the sense STRN4 probe set, indicating specificity of the in situ hybridization signal. The Strn4 mRNA puncta were not co-localized with the excitatory postsynaptic proteins PSD-95 or SynGAP, but some of them were situated close to (∼1 μm) excitatory synapses (Fig. 1B). This is consistent with the notion that dendritic mRNA granules are not located in the heads of dendritic spines or synapses, but instead are present in the dendrites or at the base of the spines to dynamically survey individual synapses (38Doyle M. Kiebler M.A. Mechanisms of dendritic mRNA transport and its role in synaptic tagging.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 3540-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 39Yoon Y.J. Wu B. Buxbaum A.R. Das S.

U.S.A. 2016; 113: E6877-E6886Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Next, the subcellular localization of STRN4 protein in hippocampal neuron was examined. Specificity of the STRN4 antibody in immunocytochemistry was validated by RNAi-mediated knockdown of STRN4 (Fig. 4, B and C, and see below). Excitatory and inhibitory synapses are preferentially present in dendritic spines and dendritic shaft, respectively. STRN4 was previously reported to be localized at excitatory synapses (31Benoist M. Baude A. Tasmadjian A. Dargent B. Kessler J.P. Castets F. Distribution of zinedin in the rat brain.J. Neurochem. 2008; 106: 969-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 32Gaillard S. Bailly Y.

Hsueh Y.-P. CTTNBP2, but not CTTNBP2NL, regulates dendritic spinogenesis and synaptic distribution of the striatin-PP2A complex.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2012; 23: 4383-4392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but it is not clear whether it is preferentially expressed at excitatory synapses or present at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. We found that STRN4 existed as discrete puncta in both the dendritic shaft and dendritic spines. The majority (78.1 ± 4.1%; 50 STRN4 puncta from three dendrites) of the spine-associated STRN4 puncta were co-localized with the excitatory postsynaptic protein PSD-95 (Fig. 1C). In contrast, relatively few (24.4 ± 5.6%; 46 puncta from two dendrites) of the non-spine-associated STRN4 puncta in the dendritic shaft were co-localized with the inhibitory postsynaptic scaffold protein gephyrin (Fig. 1D). These findings therefore indicate that STRN4 is mostly expressed at excitatory synapses. Expression of proteins that are encoded by dendritic mRNAs often depends on synaptic activity (40Butko M.T. Savas J.N. Friedman B. Delahunty C. Ebner F. Yates 3rd, J.R. Tsien R.Y.

U.S.A. 2013; 110: E726-E735Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We therefore determined how STRN4 protein expression is regulated in the hippocampal neuron. Consistent with our hypothesis that STRN4 regulates dendritic spine maturation, the expression of STRN4 protein was up-regulated between 7 and 14 days in vitro (DIV) (Fig. 2A), a period when there is a drastic change from thin spines to mushroom spines (41Papa M. Bundman M.C. Greenberger V. Segal M. Morphological analysis of dendritic spine development in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons.J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the up-regulation of STRN4 expression from 7 to 14 DIV was abolished by blocking the spontaneous action potential with tetrodotoxin (TTX) (Fig. 2B), indicating that the developmental increase in STRN4 expression depends on neuronal activity. Firing of action potential triggers glutamate release from excitatory neurons. The findings that STRN4 expression depends on spontaneous neuronal activity prompted us to ask whether activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors are required for STRN4 expression. We found that selective blockade of NMDA receptor by APV significantly reduced STRN4 protein expression in hippocampal neurons, whereas the AMPA and kainate receptor antagonist 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX) did not affect STRN4 expression (Fig. 2C). The regulation of STRN4 expression by the NMDA receptor occurred at the protein rather than the mRNA level, because APV did not significantly affect the Strn4 mRNA expression revealed by either in situ hybridization or semi-quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 2D and data not shown). Next, we ask whether the NMDA receptor-dependent expression of STRN4 protein occurs in a cell-wide or compartment-specific manner by performing immunofluorescence staining of hippocampal neurons after blockade of NMDA receptors. Notably, compared with the vehicle control, APV treatment reduced STRN4 expression specifically in the dendritic protrusions but not the cell soma (Fig. 2E). Double immunofluorescence staining with PSD-95 antibody verified the reduction of synaptic STRN4 expression after APV treatment (Fig. 2F). Taken together, these findings indicate that the expression of STRN4 is regulated locally at excitatory synapses by spontaneous activation of the NMDA receptor. Activation of NMDA receptors, but not AMPA receptors, controls dendritic spine morphology (13McKinney R.A. Capogna M. Dürr R. Gähwiler B.H. Thompson S.M. Miniature synaptic events maintain dendritic spines via AMPA receptor activation.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 41Papa M. Bundman M.C. Greenberger V. Segal M. Morphological analysis of dendritic spine development in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons.J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We confirmed that in our culture condition, blocking NMDA receptor activity of hippocampal neurons for 48 h by APV resulted in similar change of spine morphology from mushroom spines toward thin spines and filopodia (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S1). APV treatment also reduced the number of mushroom spines that contained PSD-95 clusters at their spine heads (Fig. 3B). Given the dependence of its local expression on the NMDA receptor, we postulate that STRN4 might represent one of the key players in regulating spine morphology by being expressed preferentially and hence selectively maintaining the PSD-95-positive mushroom spines. Although the presence of the striatin family of scaffold proteins in dendritic spines has been previously demonstrated, its relative abundance in different types of dendritic spines has not been explored. To better define the various spine types, the images of dendritic spines were acquired using Super-resolution Structured Illumination Microscopy (SR-SIM), which has about 2-fold higher axial resolution than confocal microscopy (42Gustafsson M.G. Surpassing the lateral resolution limit by a factor of two using structured illumination microscopy.J. Microsc. 2000; 198: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (2613) Google Scholar) and is suitable for visualization of cellular structures around 200 nm, such as the neck of a dendritic spine (see supplemental Fig. S2) (43Schouten M. De Luca G.M. Alatriste González D.K. de Jong B.E. Timmermans W. Xiong H. Krugers H. Manders E.M. Fitzsimons C.P. Imaging dendritic spines of rat primary hippocampal neurons using structured illumination microscopy.J. Vis. Exp. 2014; 10.3791/51276Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We found that STRN4 expression differed in distinct subtypes of dendritic spines, with the highest STRN4 immunoreactivity present in stubby spines and the spine heads of mushroom-shaped spines that contained PSD-95 clusters, whereas STRN4 immunoreactivity was significantly reduced in thin spines and filopodia (Fig. 3C). The expression level of STRN4 therefore correlates with spine morphology, and the down-regulation of STRN4 upon NMDA receptor blockade is correlated with the selective loss of mushroom spines where STRN4 is abundant. To directly address whether STRN4 is indeed crucial for regulating spine morphology, we created the short hairpin RNA (shRNA) construct that specifically targeted STRN4. The knockdown efficiency of the STRN4 shRNA was confirmed by both Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry (Fig. 4). Next, we examined the density of various subtypes of spines after transfecting the STRN4 shRNA or control shRNA together with enhanced GFP construct into dissociated hippocampal neurons. Compared with the control shRNA, introduction of the STRN4 shRNA triggered significant reduction of the density of mushroom spines. Importantly, the density of stubby spines, thin spines, and filopodia was not affected (Fig. 5, A and B, a"

Design Retrospective cohort. Setting Academic medical center. Patients Fresh IVF cycles from 9/2004–12/2011. Intervention 10,427 fresh IVF-ICSI cycles met inclusion criteria. hCG was administered according to E2 level at trigger: 10,000IU vs. 5,000IU vs. 4,000IU vs. 3,300IU vs. dual trigger (2mg leuprolide acetate + 1,500IU hCG). Serum absorption of hCG was assessed according to dose and BMI. Main outcome measures Oocyte maturity was analyzed according to post-trigger serum b-hCG. Fertilization, clinical pregnancy, live birth and OHSS rates were examined by hCG trigger dose. Results Post-trigger serum b-hCG 20–30, 30–40, and 40–50 mIU/mL was associated with reduced oocyte maturity as compared b-hCG >50 (67.8% vs. 71.4% vs. 73.3% vs. 78.9%, respectively, P<0.05). b-hCG 20–50 mIU/mL was associated with a 40.1% reduction in live birth (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.41–0.87). No differences in IVF outcomes per retrieval were seen for varying doses of hCG or dual trigger when controlling for patient age. The incidence of moderate to severe OHSS was 0.13% (n = 14) and severe OHSS was 0.03% (n = 4) of cycles. Conclusions Moderate stimulation with sliding scale hCG at trigger and fresh transfer is associated with low rates of OHSS and favorable pregnancy rates. Doses as low as 3,300IU alone or dual trigger with 1,500IU are sufficient to facilitate oocyte maturity."
https://openalex.org/W2608993017,"Soluble Klotho (sKlotho) is the shed ectodomain of antiaging membrane Klotho that contains 2 extracellular domains KL1 and KL2, each of which shares sequence homology to glycosyl hydrolases. sKlotho elicits pleiotropic cellular responses with a poorly understood mechanism of action. Notably, in injury settings, sKlotho confers cardiac and renal protection by down-regulating calcium-permeable transient receptor potential canonical type isoform 6 (TRPC6) channels in cardiomyocytes and glomerular podocytes. Inhibition of PI3K-dependent exocytosis of TRPC6 is thought to be the underlying mechanism, and recent studies showed that sKlotho interacts with α2–3-sialyllactose-containing gangliosides enriched in lipid rafts to inhibit raft-dependent PI3K signaling. However, the structural basis for binding and recognition of α2–3-sialyllactose by sKlotho is unknown. Using homology modeling followed by docking, we identified key protein residues in the KL1 domain that are likely involved in binding sialyllactose. Functional experiments based on the ability of Klotho to down-regulate TRPC6 channel activity confirm the importance of these residues. Furthermore, KL1 domain binds α2–3-sialyllactose, down-regulates TRPC6 channels, and exerts protection against stress-induced cardiac hypertrophy in mice. Our results support the notion that sialogangliosides and lipid rafts are membrane receptors for sKlotho and that the KL1 domain is sufficient for the tested biologic activities. These findings can help guide the design of a simpler Klotho mimetic.—Wright, J. D., An, S.-W., Xie, J., Yoon, J., Nischan, N., Kohler, J. J., Oliver, N., Lim, C., Huang, C.-L.

Because circumcision provides only partial protection against HIV infection to men, the issue of possible risk compensation in response to VMMC campaigns is of particular concern. In this study, we looked at population-level survey data from the countries prioritized by WHO for a VMMC scale-up. We compared the difference in sexual risk behaviours (SRB) between circumcised and uncircumcised men before and after the WHO's official VMMC promotion.Ten countries (Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe) participating in the WHO's VMMC scale-up had available data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). We used cumulative-link mixed models to investigate interactions between survey period and circumcision status in predicting SRB, in order to evaluate whether the difference between the behavior of the two groups changed before and after the scale-up, while controlling for socio-demographic and knowledge-related covariates. The main responses were condom use at last sex and number of non-cohabiting sexual partners, both in the last 12 months.There was little change in condom use by circumcised men relative to uncircumcised men from before the VMMC scale up to after the scale up. The relative odds ratio is 1.06 (95% CI, 0.95-1.18; interaction P = 0.310). Similarly, there was little change in the number of non-cohabiting partners in circumcised men (relative to uncircumcised men): the relative odds ratio of increasing the number of partners is 0.95 (95% CI, 0.86-1.05; interaction P = 0.319). Age, religion, education, job, marital status, media use and HIV knowledge also showed statistically significant association with the studied risk behaviours. We also found significant differences among countries, while controlling for covariates.Overall, we find no evidence of sexual risk compensation in response to VMMC campaigns in countries prioritized by WHO. Changes in relative partner behaviour and the relative odds of condom use were small (and of uncertain sign). In fact, our estimates, though not significant, both suggest slightly less risky behavior. We conclude that sexual risk compensation in response to VMMC campaigns has not been a serious problem to date, but urge continued attention to local context, and to promulgating accurate messages about circumcision within and beyond the VMMC context."

In this study, we determined the impact of the R753Q TLR2 polymorphism on macrophage sensing of Mycobacterium smegmatis. Upon infection with M. smegmatis, macrophages from knock-in mice harboring R753Q TLR2 expressed lower levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 compared with cells from WT mice, but both R753Q TLR2- and WT-derived macrophages exhibited comparable bacterial burdens. The decreased cytokine responses in R753Q TLR2-expressing macrophages were accompanied by impaired phosphorylation of IL-1R-associated kinase 1 (IRAK-1), p38, ERK1/2 MAPKs, and p65 NF-κB, suggesting that the R753Q TLR2 polymorphism alters the functions of the myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88)-IRAK-dependent signaling axis.

Methods Participants were residents from a defined geographical area, Skaraborg County in the southwestern part of Sweden. A cohort of 3,368 persons exposed to whiplash trauma and attending a healthcare facility immediately after the trauma between 1999 and 2008 were identified in a database. Information about gender, age, time elapsed prior to seeking care, type of healthcare contact, initial treatment provided and eventual hospitalization time was retrieved. Results Women sought care later than men (p = 0.00074). Women consulted primary healthcare first more often than men, who more often first sought hospital care (p = 0.0060). There were no gender differences regarding the type of treatment after trauma. Women had longer hospital admission than men (p = 0.022), indicating their injuries were at least similar to or worse than men’s. Conclusion Women sought healthcare later than men after whiplash trauma. Although not directly investigated in this study, it raises the question if this may reduce their probability of getting financial compensation compared to men."
https://openalex.org/W2608618262,"Purpose Current knowledge about pulmonary/systemic hemodynamics and gas exchange during neonatal resuscitation in a model of transitioning fetal circulation with fetal shunts and fluid-filled alveoli is limited. Using a fetal lamb asphyxia model, we sought to determine whether hemodynamic or gas-exchange parameters predicted successful return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Methods The umbilical cord was occluded in 22 lambs to induce asphyxial cardiac arrest. Following five minutes of asystole, resuscitation as per AHA-Neonatal Resuscitation Program guidelines was initiated. Hemodynamic parameters and serial arterial blood gases were assessed during resuscitation. Results ROSC occurred in 18 lambs (82%) at a median (IQR) time of 120 (105–180) seconds. There were no differences in hemodynamic parameters at baseline and at any given time point during resuscitation between the lambs that achieved ROSC and those that did not. Blood gases at arrest prior to resuscitation were comparable between groups. However, lambs that achieved ROSC had lower PaO2, higher PaCO2, and lower lactate during resuscitation. Increase in diastolic blood pressures induced by epinephrine in lambs that achieved ROSC (11 ±4 mmHg) did not differ from those that were not resuscitated (10 ±6 mmHg). Low diastolic blood pressures were adequate to achieve ROSC. Conclusions Hemodynamic parameters in a neonatal lamb asphyxia model with transitioning circulation did not predict success of ROSC. Lactic acidosis, higher PaO2 and lower PaCO2 observed in the lambs that did not achieve ROSC may represent a state of inadequate tissue perfusion and/or mitochondrial dysfunction."

https://openalex.org/W2609030122,"Background Intestinal metaplasia (IM) is a precursor lesion that precedes gastric cancer (GC). There are two IM histological subtypes, complete (CIM) and incomplete (IIM), the latter having higher progression rates to GC. This study was aimed at analysing gene expression and molecular processes involved in the progression from normal mucosa to IM, and also from IM subtypes to GC. Methodology We used expression data to compare the transcriptome of healthy gastric mucosa to that of IM not progressing to GC, and the transcriptome of IM subtypes that had progressed to GC to those that did not progress. Some deregulated genes were validated and pathway analyses were performed. Results Comparison of IM subtypes that had progressed to GC with those that did not progress showed smaller differences in the expression profiles than the comparison of IM that did not progress with healthy mucosa. New transcripts identified in IM not progressing to GC included TRIM, TMEM, homeobox and transporter genes and SNORD116. Comparison to normal mucosa identified non tumoral Warburg effect and melatonin degradation as previously unreported processes involved in IM. Overexpressed antigen processing is common to both IM-subtypes progressing to GC, but IIM showed more over-expressed oncogenic genes and molecular processes than CIM. Conclusions There are greater differences in gene expression and molecular processes involved in the progression from normal healthy mucosa to IM than from IM to gastric cancer.

FAD-induced cell death is caspase-dependent. However, FAD induces autophagy to contribute to the cell death. Blocking autophagy by either chemical inhibitors or genetic knockout of autophagy signaling component inhibits FAD-induced cell death. We further found that FAD-induced cell death is mediated by the induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress. We also identified that FAD has synergistic effect with approved cancer drugs 5-FU and Bortezomib in killing breast cancer cells. Summarily, these data demonstrate that FAD has strong and specific anticancer effect in breast cancer cells, and provide some insights about the roles of autophagy in FAD-induced cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2609256953,"Avian Influenza virus (AIV) is a major concern for the global poultry industry. Since 2012, several countries have reported AIV outbreaks among domestic poultry. These outbreaks had tremendous impact on poultry production and socio-economic repercussion on farmers. In addition, the constant emergence of highly pathogenic AIV also poses a significant risk to human health. In this study, we used a chicken lung epithelial cell line (CLEC213) to gain a better understanding of the molecular consequences of low pathogenic AIV infection in their natural host. Using a transcriptome profiling approach based on microarrays, we identified a cluster of mitochondrial genes highly induced during the infection. Interestingly, most of the regulated genes are encoded by the mitochondrial genome and are involved in the oxidative phosphorylation metabolic pathway. The biological consequences of this transcriptomic induction result in a 2.5- to 4-fold increase of the ATP concentration within the infected cells. PB1-F2, a viral protein that targets the mitochondria was not found associated to the boost of activity of the respiratory chain. We next explored the possibility that ATP may act as a host-derived danger signal (through production of extracellular ATP) or as a boost to increase AIV replication. We observed that, despite the activation of the P2X7 purinergic receptor pathway, a 1mM ATP addition in the cell culture medium had no effect on the virus replication in our epithelial cell model. Finally, we found that oligomycin, a drug that inhibits the oxidative phosphorylation process, drastically reduced the AIV replication in CLEC213 cells, without apparent cellular toxicity. Collectively, our results suggest that AIV is able to boost the metabolic capacities of its avian host in order to provide the important energy needs required to produce progeny virus."

Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is well known for its potent immunosuppressive properties and possesses important antiproliferative and antifibrotic effects. The safety and effectiveness of MMF in IPF is unknown.We performed a retrospective multicohort analysis of IPF patients treated with MMF compared to those treated with either ineffective/harmful treatments or no treatment. Longitudinal change in forced vital capacity (FVC) between the groups was analyzed using a mixed model with random intercept and slope allowing for repeated measures within subjects. Categorical change in FVC, median overall survival, and adverse events were also assessed.Forty-one IPF patients were included: 11 treated with MMF, 20 treated with ineffective/harmful agents (such as prednisone, azathioprine, and/or NAC), and 10 did not receive any specific treatment for their IPF. After one year, there was a trend towards reduced FVC decline in the MMF-treated group (-76.3 mL, -2.4% of predicted) compared to the non-MMF-treated (-165 mL, -8.9% of predicted) and the no-treatment (-239 mL, -11.5% of predicted) groups, respectively. By categorical change, there was a trend towards greater FVC stability in the MMF-treated group (87.5%) compared to the non-MMF-treated (57%) and the no-treatment groups (50%), respectively. MMF-treated IPF patients had a trend towards improved median overall survival (40.3 months) compared to the non-MMF-treated (25.5 months) and the no-treatment (29.3 months) groups, respectively. Treatment-related adverse events were not different between groups; however, very few adverse events were reported overall.MMF treatment was associated with potentially clinically important trends toward reduced annual FVC decline (similar to approved antifibrotics), greater FVC stability and improved overall survival in IPF patients. MMF was generally safe, well tolerated, and relatively inexpensive. Future prospective studies of MMF in combination with antifibrotic therapy in IPF are needed."

https://openalex.org/W2608385642,"The paired box gene Pox neuro (Poxn) is expressed in two bilaterally symmetric neuronal clusters of the developing adult Drosophila brain, a protocerebral dorsal cluster (DC) and a deutocerebral ventral cluster (VC). We show that all cells that express Poxn in the developing brain are postmitotic neurons. During embryogenesis, the DC and VC consist of only 20 and 12 neurons that express Poxn, designated embryonic Poxn-neurons. The number of Poxn-neurons increases only during the third larval instar, when the DC and VC increase dramatically to about 242 and 109 Poxn-neurons, respectively, virtually all of which survive to the adult stage, while no new Poxn-neurons are added during metamorphosis. Although the vast majority of Poxn-neurons express Poxn only during third instar, about half of them are born by the end of embryogenesis, as demonstrated by the absence of BrdU incorporation during larval stages. At late third instar, embryonic Poxn-neurons, which begin to express Poxn during embryogenesis, can be easily distinguished from embryonic-born and larval-born Poxn-neurons, which begin to express Poxn only during third instar, (i) by the absence of Pros, (ii) their overt differentiation of axons and neurites, and (iii) the strikingly larger diameter of their cell bodies still apparent in the adult brain. The embryonic Poxn-neurons are primary neurons that lay out the pioneering tracts for the secondary Poxn-neurons, which differentiate projections and axons that follow those of the primary neurons during metamorphosis. The DC and the VC participate only in two neuropils of the adult brain. The DC forms most, if not all, of the neurons that connect the bulb (lateral triangle) with the ellipsoid body, a prominent neuropil of the central complex, while the VC forms most of the ventral projection neurons of the antennal lobe, which connect it ipsilaterally to the lateral horn, bypassing the mushroom bodies. In addition, Poxn-neurons of the VC are ventral local interneurons of the antennal lobe. In the absence of Poxn protein in the developing brain, embryonic Poxn-neurons stall their projections and cannot find their proper target neuropils, the bulb and ellipsoid body in the case of the DC, or the antennal lobe and lateral horn in the case of the VC, whereby the absence of the ellipsoid body neuropil is particularly striking. Poxn is thus crucial for pathfinding both in the DC and VC. Additional implications of our results are discussed."

P. sojae has a narrow host range, consisting primarily of soybean, and it is a serious pathogen worldwide. It exists in root and stem tissues as mycelium, wherein it can form oospores which subsequently germinate to release motile, infectious zoospores. Molecular assays detecting DNA of P. sojae are useful in disease diagnostics, and for determining the presence of the organism in host tissues, soils, and runoff or ponded water from potentially infested fields. Such assays as published have utilized ITS sequences from the nuclear ribosomal RNA genes in conventional PCR or dye-binding quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) but are not amenable to multiplexing, and some of these assays did not utilize control strategies for type I or type II errors. In this study, we describe primers and a bifunctional probe with specificity to a gypsy-like retroelement in the P. sojae genome to create a fluorogenic 5’-exonuclease linear hydrolysis assay, with a multiplexed internal control reaction detecting an exogenous target to validate negative calls, and with uracil-deglycosylase-mediated protection against carryover contamination. The assay specifically detected 13 different P. sojae isolates, and excluded 17 other Phytophthora species along with 20 non-Phytophthora fungal and oomycete species pathogenic on soybean.

We find that the IR substrate 1 (IRS1)/PI3K/Akt signaling cascade-downstream of IR-displays prolonged activation in K8-null compared with wild-type hepatocytes. Assessment of the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1-mediated feedback loop to IRS1/PI3K, in the absence or presence of drug inhibitors, further supports a preferential K8/K18 IF intervention at the surface membrane. In K8-null hepatocytes, IR trafficking vesicles that are labeled by Rab5/EEA1/phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate accumulate at a juxtanuclear region via a microtubule-dependent process. Moreover, interference with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate signaling aggravates IR/Rab5 accumulation. Overall, results uncover K8/K18 IF regulation of IR signaling via a concerted modulation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate-dependent IRS1/PI3K/Akt signaling and Rab5/phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate/microtubule trafficking in hepatocytes.-Roux, A., Loranger, A., Lavoie, J.

To deepen the knowledge about contexts of occurrence of child malnutrition, we analyzed nutritional status in relation to socio-environmental conditions of residence in children between three and six years from Villaguay, Entre Ríos, Argentina. We performed a cross-sectional study of 1,435 school children of both sexes. Body weight and height were measured and prevalence of low height/age (LH/A), low weight/age (LW/A), low BMI/age (LBMI/A), overweight (Ow) and obesity (Ob) was calculated using World Health Organization reference charts. Socio-environmental information was obtained through a semi-structured survey and processed by Categorical Principal Component Analysis (CatPCA). Anthropometric data showed 1.5% LW/A, 5.2% LH/A; 0.6% LBMI/A, 20.9% Ow and 10.9% Ob. CatPCA allowed us to define four groups (G1-G4) with better (G2), middle (G1) and worst (G4) urban socio-environmental conditions and one with rural characteristics (G3). G4 presented the highest LH/A prevalence and G2 the highest Ow and Ob prevalence (P<0.05). It is concluded that since the distribution of malnutrition was not even it may dependent on the context in which children grow up. Thus, the higher the socio-economic level, the higher the incidence of overweight and obesity. Conversely, at the other end of the social scale, undernutrition and increasing weight excess remained major health problems."

The Pharmacy Services Questionnaire (PSQ) measures patient satisfaction with pharmaceutical care. In this study, we developed a modified Korean version of the PSQ (PSQ-K) and evaluated its validity and reliability. The PSQ-K was developed using a strict translation and cultural-adaptation procedure. A validation study was performed in six community pharmacies in Korea. A total of 300 respondents completed three questionnaires (a brief questionnaire for social demographics and clinical characteristics, the PSQ-K, and the 5-level EuroQoL Group’s 5-dimension [EQ-5D-5L]). Standard validity and reliability analyses were performed. The internal consistency of the PSQ-K was high for all scales (Cronbach’s α > 0.9). The PSQ-K indicated good discriminant and divergent validity. Known-group comparisons revealed that the PSQ-K was able to distinguish between respondents differing in socio-demographic characteristics, such as gender, level of education, and household income. In conclusion, the PSQ-K is a highly reliable and valid PRO instrument for assessing the level of satisfaction with community pharmacy services."
https://openalex.org/W2608491752,"To investigate large cup-to-disc ratios (CDR) in children and to determine the relationship between parental CDR and clinical characteristics associated with glaucoma.Two hundred thirty six children aged 6 to 12 years with CDR ≥ 0.6 were enrolled in this study. Subjects were classified into two groups based on parental CDR: disc suspect children with disc suspect (CDR ≥0.6) parents and disc suspect children without disc suspect parents. Ocular variables were compared between the two groups.Of the 236 disc suspect children, 100 (42.4%) had at least one disc suspect parent. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was higher in disc suspect children with disc suspect parents (16.52±2.66 mmHg) than in disc suspect children without disc suspect parents (14.38±2.30 mmHg, p = 0.023). In the group with disc suspect parents, vertical CDR significantly correlated with IOP (R = -0.325, p = 0.001), average retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness (R = -0.319, p = 0.001), rim area (R = -0.740, p = 0.001), and cup volume (R = 0.499, p = 0.001). However, spherical equivalent (R = 0.333, p = 0.001), AL (R = -0.223, p = 0.009), and disc area (R = 0.325, p = 0.001) significantly correlated with vertical CDR in disc suspect children without disc suspect parents, in contrast to those with disc suspect parents. Larger vertical CDR was associated with the presence of disc suspect parents (p = 0.001), larger disc area (p = 0.001), thinner rim area (p = 0.001), larger average CDR (p = 0.001), and larger cup volume (p = 0.021).Family history of large CDR was a significant factor associated with large vertical CDR in children. In children with disc suspect parents, there were significant correlations between IOP and average RNFL thickness and vertical CDR."
https://openalex.org/W2609007498,"The impact of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion on resting-state blood oxygen level-dependent signal fluctuations remains unknown. We aimed to determine whether chronic ischemia induces changes in amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and to investigate the correlation between ALFF and perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (PWI) parameters in patients with moyamoya disease (MMD). Thirty patients with pre- and postoperative resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and PWI were included, and thirty normal controls underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. A decrease in preoperative frontal lobe ALFF was observed in patients with MMD. Postoperative frontal lobe ALFF showed moderate improvement but still remained lower than those in normal controls. The values of mean transit time and time-to-peak, but not cerebral blood volume and cerebral blood flow, correlated significantly with frontal lobe ALFF. Moreover, there were significant negative correlations between changes in frontal lobe PWI parameters and changes in frontal lobe ALFF on both operated side and contralateral side after the unilateral revascularization surgery. Our results demonstrate that reduced ALFF are closely related to the abnormal PWI parameters and vary with the alteration of cerebral perfusion in patients with MMD."
https://openalex.org/W2609123455,"Advances in omics technologies have led to the discovery of genetic markers, or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), that are associated with particular diseases or complex traits. Although there have been significant improvements in the approaches used to analyse associations of SNPs with disease, further optimised and rapid techniques are needed to keep up with the rate of SNP discovery, which has exacerbated the ‘missing heritability’ problem. Here, we have devised a novel, integrated, heuristic-based, hybrid analytical computational pipeline, for rapidly detecting novel or key genetic variants that are associated with diseases or complex traits. Our pipeline is particularly useful in genetic association studies where the genotyped SNP data are highly dimensional, and the complex trait phenotype involved is continuous. In particular, the pipeline is more efficient for investigating small sets of genotyped SNPs defined in high dimensional spaces that may be associated with continuous phenotypes, rather than for the investigation of whole genome variants. The pipeline, which employs a consensus approach based on the random forest, was able to rapidly identify previously unseen key SNPs, that are significantly associated with the platelet response phenotype, which was used as our complex trait case study. Several of these SNPs, such as rs6141803 of COMMD7 and rs41316468 in PKT2B, have independently confirmed associations with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) according to other unrelated studies, suggesting that our pipeline is robust in identifying key genetic variants. Our new pipeline provides an important step towards addressing the problem of ‘missing heritability’ through enhanced detection of key genetic variants (SNPs) that are associated with continuous complex traits/disease phenotypes."
