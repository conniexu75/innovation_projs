https://openalex.org/W2522716651,"Although the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has been studied intensely for decades, its precise functions have remained elusive. We recently hypothesized that the OFC contains a ""cognitive map"" of task space in which the current state of the task is represented, and this representation is especially critical for behavior when states are unobservable from sensory input. To test this idea, we apply pattern-classification techniques to neuroimaging data from humans performing a decision-making task with 16 states. We show that unobservable task states can be decoded from activity in OFC, and decoding accuracy is related to task performance and the occurrence of individual behavioral errors. Moreover, similarity between the neural representations of consecutive states correlates with behavioral accuracy in corresponding state transitions. These results support the idea that OFC represents a cognitive map of task space and establish the feasibility of decoding state representations in humans using non-invasive neuroimaging."

The scaffold includes continuous fibers spanning the thickness of the developing cortex during neurogenesis across mammals. However, we find that in humans, the scaffold transforms into a physically discontinuous structure during the transition from infragranular to supragranular neuron production. As a consequence of this transformation, supragranular layer neurons arrive at their terminal positions in the cortical plate along outer radial glia (oRG) cell fibers. In parallel, the radial glia that contact the ventricle develop distinct gene expression profile and “truncated” morphology.

Following sequential waves of induction and patterning of the neural tube, the cerebral cortical anlage emerges from the anterior neural tube. Around gestational week 7 (GW7) of human development, the founder population of neuroepithelial cells transforms into vRG cells that begin to divide asymmetrically to produce progeny that adopt neuronal fate directly, or re-enter the cell cycle as intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs) (Bystron et al., 2006Bystron I.

Cortical neurons arise in symmetric and asymmetric division zones and migrate through specific phases.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar). Upon differentiation, projection neurons migrate to their final destination in the cortical plate along the radial glia fiber scaffold (Rakic, 1972Rakic P. Mode of cell migration to the superficial layers of fetal monkey neocortex.J. Comp. Neurol. 1972; 145: 61-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1690) Google Scholar). The radial unit hypothesis postulates that neurons migrating along the same or adjacent radial glia fibers form a cortical column, and that symmetric self-renewing divisions of vRG cells expand the founder population, leading to additional cortical columns and tangential expansion of the cortical sheet (Rakic, 1978Rakic P. Neuronal migration and contact guidance in the primate telencephalon.Postgrad. Med. J. 1978; 54: 25-40PubMed Google Scholar). This influential model provides a crucial framework for studying the development and evolution of the cerebral cortex. However, the radial unit hypothesis does not account for the increased complexity of radial glia progenitor populations in many species, the appearance of stereotyped cortical folds during neurogenesis, and the disproportionate expansion of upper cortical layers in the primate lineage. Interestingly, previous studies observed that at late stages of human cortical development, around gestational week 18–19 (GW18–GW19) vRG cells no longer contact the pia, and their processes terminate in the OSVZ (deAzevedo et al., 2003deAzevedo L.C.

Neuronal migration, with special reference to developing human brain: a review.Brain Res. 1973; 62: 1-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). Similarly, radial glia cells that no longer contact the pial or ventricular surfaces have been reported in rhesus macaque starting from embryonic day (E) 65, although periventricular astrocytes do not develop until E125, after the end of neurogenesis (Schmechel and Rakic, 1979Schmechel D.E. Rakic P. Arrested proliferation of radial glial cells during midgestation in rhesus monkey.Nature. 1979; 277: 303-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To provide further insights into the timing of the transformation of the radial glia scaffold in relation to the neurogenic time window, we visualized radial glia morphology during human cortical development using the lipophilic fluorescent dye DiI. At early stages of neurogenesis, prior to GW16.5, placement of DiI on the ventricular surface revealed numerous cells with classical radial glia morphology, consisting of apical and basal processes spanning the entire thickness of the telencephalic wall (Figures 1A and S1). We term this the “continuous scaffold stage.” In contrast, at later stages of neurogenesis (GW17–GW24), DiI labeling of the ventricular surface did not reveal cells with processes spanning the telencephalic wall (Figures 1A, S1, and S2). Instead, radial glia displayed “truncated” morphologies (Rakic, 2003bRakic P. Elusive radial glial cells: historical and evolutionary perspective.Glia. 2003; 43: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), with fibers terminating abruptly in the OSVZ (Figures 1, S1, and S2). We term this the “discontinuous scaffold stage” and propose to refer to the radial glia population with non-classical morphologies as “truncated” radial glia (tRG, Figure 1B). Because human cortical neurogenesis extends to the third trimester (Malik et al., 2013Malik S. Vinukonda G. Vose L.R. Diamond D. Bhimavarapu B.B. Hu F. Zia M.T. Hevner R. Zecevic N. Ballabh P.

Modeling transformations of neurodevelopmental sequences across mammalian species.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 7368-7383Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), the transformation of the radial glia scaffold into a physically discontinuous structure occurs midway through the neurogenic period. To explore whether vRG cells acquire a distinct molecular identity during their morphological transition to tRG cells, we reanalyzed patterns of gene expression in radial glia collected from primary human cortical samples (Camp et al., 2015Camp J.G.

Compared to radial glia at early stages (GW14–GW15) and oRG cells at later stages of cortical development (GW16–GW18), tRG cells retain the expression of pan-radial glia markers, such as PAX6, HES1, SLC1A3, and SOX2, but develop a distinct molecular profile characterized by reduced expression of genes such as FAM107A, LIFR, and HOPX,and enriched expression of genes such as CRYAB and NR4A1 (Figures 2A–2C and S3A) (Pollen et al., 2015Pollen A.A.

Methods. 2016; 13: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Consistent with DiI labeling experiments, CRYAB-immunoreactive tRG fibers extend to the OSVZ, but not beyond (Figures 2D and S2), and we identified many examples of tRG fibers oriented tangentially (Figure 2E, arrows). The tRG fibers often terminate on capillaries, with their end-feet encircling endothelial cells, most prominently in the ISVZ and the inner portions of the OSVZ (Figure 2E, arrowheads). Finally, we observed numerous SATB2-positive nuclei adjacent to tRG fibers (Figures 2F and S3B), suggesting a role for tRG cells in continuing to guide neuronal migration despite the loss of direct contact with the pia. Together, these observations indicate that radial glia that contact the ventricle adopt a truncated morphology and a specific molecular program at mid-neurogenesis, supporting their distinction from classically defined vRG cells. Projection neurons that populate the distinct laminae of the cerebral cortex are produced sequentially, with deep-layer neurogenesis preceding upper-layer neurogenesis (Angevine and Sidman, 1961Angevine Jr., J.B.

Studies in rodents, ferrets, and monkeys have shown that neuronal subtype specification may be determined at the level of radial glia cells, whose competence to produce diverse types of projection neurons becomes progressively restricted during development (Frantz and McConnell, 1996Frantz G.D.

Cell cycle dependence of laminar determination in developing neocortex.Science. 1991; 254: 282-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). In line with this prediction, genetic manipulations that extend radial glia neurogenesis in mouse result in an overproduction of upper cortical layer neurons (Nowakowski et al., 2013Nowakowski T.J. Mysiak K.S. O’Leary T. Fotaki V. Pratt T. Price D.J. Loss of functional Dicer in mouse radial glia cell-autonomously prolongs cortical neurogenesis.Dev.

MicroRNA-mediated non-cell-autonomous regulation of cortical radial glial transformation revealed by a Dicer1 knockout mouse model.Glia. 2015; 63: 860-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To relate the changes in radial glia scaffold organization to the fate of neurons produced, we examined the identity of newborn neurons in the germinal zone using antibodies for the deep (infrangranular) cortical layer neuron markers, TBR1 and CTIP2, and for the marker SATB2, which is highly expressed in upper (supraganular) cortical layers. In the OSVZ of specimens younger than GW16.5, we observed prominent populations of neurons expressing TBR1, CTIP2, and SATB2 (Figure 3A). However, at stages corresponding to the discontinuous scaffold stage, we detected a prominent population of neurons expressing SATB2, but not TBR1 or CTIP2. Thus, the transformation of the radial glia scaffold from a continuous to a discontinuous structure closely parallels the well-established transition of radial glia from generating deep to generating upper-layer neurons. It has been proposed that an extended neurogenic time window underlies the radial expansion of supragranular layers in the primate lineage (Hutsler et al., 2005Hutsler J.J. Lee D.G. Porter K.K. Comparative analysis of cortical layering and supragranular layer enlargement in rodent carnivore and primate species.Brain Res. 2005; 1052: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and furthermore, that OSVZ progenitor cells contribute the majority of supragranular layer neurons in primates (Lukaszewicz et al., 2005Lukaszewicz A. Savatier P. Cortay V. Giroud P. Huissoud C. Berland M. Kennedy H. Dehay C.

Cortex. 2002; 12: 37-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Indeed, the relative size of the OSVZ proliferative fraction increases as neurogenesis progresses in primates, while the frequency of mitoses in the ventricular zone decreases (Lukaszewicz et al., 2005Lukaszewicz A. Savatier P. Cortay V. Giroud P. Huissoud C. Berland M. Kennedy H. Dehay C.

Sidman R.L. Autoradiographic study of supravital DNA synthesis in fetal human brain.J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1968; 27: 139-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether changes in the radial glia scaffold correspond to the shift of radial glia proliferation to the OSVZ. Consistent with previous reports, we observed that the overall number of ventricular zone radial glia and mitotic figures declined toward mid-gestation, while the number of radial glia in the OSVZ steadily increased over the same period (Figures 3B and 3C). To examine whether the population of supragranular layer neurons continues to expand during the discontinuous scaffold stage, when oRG cells are the major proliferative population, we compared the proportion of supragranular and infragranular neurons at GW17–GW18 with GW23–GW24. The relative proportion of SATB2 positive neurons in the cortical plate at GW23–GW24 was significantly greater compared with GW17–GW18, even when migrating neurons in the intermediate zones were included in the GW17–GW18 cell number estimate (Figure 3D). Together, these findings suggest a shift in proliferative activity from ventricular to subventricular regions around the time of transition between the continuous and the discontinuous scaffold stages. Along with previous studies (Hansen et al., 2010Hansen D.V. Lui J.H. Parker P.R. Kriegstein A.R. Neurogenic radial glia in the outer subventricular zone of human neocortex.Nature. 2010; 464: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar, Pollen et al., 2015Pollen A.A. Nowakowski T.J. Chen J. Retallack H. Sandoval-Espinosa C. Nicholas C.R. Shuga J. Liu S.J. Oldham M.C. Diaz A. et al.Molecular identity of human outer radial glia during cortical development.Cell. 2015; 163: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), this also suggests that while oRG cells contribute to the production of both deep and upper cortical layer neurons, oRG cells may be especially important for the extended production of supragranular layer neurons in primates. The expansion of the oRG population and the truncation of vRG fibers at mid-neurogenesis suggest that oRG cells are sole contributors of the radial glia fibers guiding neurons to the cortical plate during supragranular layer neurogenesis. Indeed, DiI placement at the pial surface after GW16.5 labeled fibers terminating in cell bodies in the OSVZ, in contrast to experiments at earlier stages that also labeled cell bodies in the VZ (Figure 4A). In addition, immunostaining experiments at GW18 demonstrated that the vast majority of VIM-expressing radial glia fibers in the intermediate zone (IZ) and the cortical plate (CP) co-expressed the recently described oRG marker, HOPX (Figure 4B). Recent studies suggest that oRG cells emerge as the daughter cells of horizontally dividing vRG cells and thereby inherit vRG basal fibers (LaMonica et al., 2013). This highlights a possible cellular mechanism by which the radial glia fibers that contact the pia in human cortex become progressively restricted to oRG cells. Future studies will be necessary to determine if all fibers of the founder vRG cells are inherited by oRG cells, and to establish if upon symmetric division of an oRG cell, both daughter oRG cells can establish basal fiber connections with the pial surface (Florio and Huttner, 2014Florio M. Huttner W.B. Neural progenitors, neurogenesis and the evolution of the neocortex.Development. 2014; 141: 2182-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous findings (Hansen et al., 2010Hansen D.V. Lui J.H. Parker P.R. Kriegstein A.R. Neurogenic radial glia in the outer subventricular zone of human neocortex.Nature. 2010; 464: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar), we found rare examples of oRG cells with apical processes in our study (Figures S3C and S3D). Together, our observations suggest a revision of the radial unit hypothesis as it applies to primates, to include a transformation of the radial glia scaffold at mid-neurogenesis from a continuous structure to a discontinuous structure formed by two morphologically and molecularly distinct radial glia subtypes (Figure 4C). The radial unit hypothesis advanced our understanding of the cytoarchitectonic organization of the developing neocortex. Symmetric divisions of the founder vRG cells increase the number of radial fibers reaching the pial surface, leading to a tangential expansion of the cortical plate (Chenn and Walsh, 2002Chenn A. Walsh C.A. Regulation of cerebral cortical size by control of cell cycle exit in neural precursors.Science. 2002; 297: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar, Haydar et al., 1999Haydar T.F.

Specification of cerebral cortical areas.Science. 1988; 241: 170-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2348) Google Scholar). Subsequent models suggested that increases in OSVZ proliferation and oRG cell numbers could contribute to tangential expansion of the cortical plate leading to folding (Kriegstein et al., 2006Kriegstein A.

Neurosci. 2006; 7: 883-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, Reillo et al., 2011Reillo I. de Juan Romero C. García-Cabezas M.A. Borrell V. A role for intermediate radial glia in the tangential expansion of the mammalian cerebral cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 2011; 21: 1674-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The revised model presented here builds on these ideas to suggest that during supragranular layer neurogenesis in humans, the total number of oRG cell fibers directly predicts the surface area of the supragranular layers. One implication of this model is that during the discontinuous scaffold stage, neurogenic divisions of oRG cells expand supragranular layers radially, while self-renewing divisions of oRG cells expand supragranular layers tangentially. Because oRG expansion during the discontinuous scaffold stage occurs throughout human neocortical areas, the revised model provides a developmental mechanism for disproportionate tangential expansion of supragranular cortex relative to infragranular cortex, which may broadly contribute to the folding of the cortical plate (Richman et al., 1975Richman D.P. Stewart R.M. Hutchinson J.W. Caviness Jr., V.S. Mechanical model of brain convolutional development.Science. 1975; 189: 18-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Recent studies also suggest that local expansion of OSVZ progenitors through increased generation or self-renewal may contribute to early stereotyped folding of the cortical plate (de Juan Romero et al., 2015de Juan Romero C.

Interestingly, the ratio of IPCs to oRGs remained constant across gyri and sulci (Figure 4D), suggesting that the size of the oRG pool itself may regulate IPC abundance, as would be predicted from clonal lineage relationships (Hansen et al., 2010Hansen D.V.

https://openalex.org/W2522365874,"Tools have been used for millions of years to augment the capabilities of the human body, allowing us to accomplish tasks that would otherwise be difficult or impossible. Powered exoskeletons and other assistive devices are sophisticated modern tools that have restored bipedal locomotion in individuals with paraplegia and have endowed unimpaired individuals with superhuman strength. Despite these successes, designing assistive devices that reduce energy consumption during running remains a substantial challenge, in part because these devices disrupt the dynamics of a complex, finely tuned biological system. Furthermore, designers have hitherto relied primarily on experiments, which cannot report muscle-level energy consumption and are fraught with practical challenges. In this study, we use OpenSim to generate muscle-driven simulations of 10 human subjects running at 2 and 5 m/s. We then add ideal, massless assistive devices to our simulations and examine the predicted changes in muscle recruitment patterns and metabolic power consumption. Our simulations suggest that an assistive device should not necessarily apply the net joint moment generated by muscles during unassisted running, and an assistive device can reduce the activity of muscles that do not cross the assisted joint. Our results corroborate and suggest biomechanical explanations for similar effects observed by experimentalists, and can be used to form hypotheses for future experimental studies. The models, simulations, and software used in this study are freely available at simtk.org and can provide insight into assistive device design that complements experimental approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2522995791,"The embryonic basal ganglia generates multiple projection neurons and interneuron subtypes from distinct progenitor domains. Combinatorial interactions of transcription factors and chromatin are thought to regulate gene expression. In the medial ganglionic eminence, the NKX2-1 transcription factor controls regional identity and, with LHX6, is necessary to specify pallidal projection neurons and forebrain interneurons. Here, we dissected the molecular functions of NKX2-1 by defining its chromosomal binding, regulation of gene expression, and epigenetic state. NKX2-1 binding at distal regulatory elements led to a repressed epigenetic state and transcriptional repression in the ventricular zone. Conversely, NKX2-1 is required to establish a permissive chromatin state and transcriptional activation in the sub-ventricular and mantle zones. Moreover, combinatorial binding of NKX2-1 and LHX6 promotes transcriptionally permissive chromatin and activates genes expressed in cortical migrating interneurons. Our integrated approach provides a foundation for elucidating transcriptional networks guiding the development of the MGE and its descendants."
https://openalex.org/W2522810007,"Purpose The purpose of this study was to determine, i) the reliability of blood lactate and ventilatory-based thresholds, ii) the lactate threshold that corresponds with each ventilatory threshold (VT1 and VT2) and with maximal lactate steady state test (MLSS) as a proxy of cycling performance. Methods Fourteen aerobically-trained male cyclists ( 62.1±4.6 ml·kg-1·min-1) performed two graded exercise tests (50 W warm-up followed by 25 W·min-1) to exhaustion. Blood lactate, and data were collected at every stage. Workloads at VT1 (rise in ;) and VT2 (rise in ) were compared with workloads at lactate thresholds. Several continuous tests were needed to detect the MLSS workload. Agreement and differences among tests were assessed with ANOVA, ICC and Bland-Altman. Reliability of each test was evaluated using ICC, CV and Bland-Altman plots. Results Workloads at lactate threshold (LT) and LT+2.0 mMol·L-1 matched the ones for VT1 and VT2, respectively (p = 0.147 and 0.539; r = 0.72 and 0.80; Bias = -13.6 and 2.8, respectively). Furthermore, workload at LT+0.5 mMol·L-1 coincided with MLSS workload (p = 0.449; r = 0.78; Bias = -4.5). Lactate threshold tests had high reliability (CV = 3.4–3.7%; r = 0.85–0.89; Bias = -2.1–3.0) except for DMAX method (CV = 10.3%; r = 0.57; Bias = 15.4). Ventilatory thresholds show high reliability (CV = 1.6%–3.5%; r = 0.90–0.96; Bias = -1.8–2.9) except for RER = 1 and V-Slope (CV = 5.0–6.4%; r = 0.79; Bias = -5.6–12.4). Conclusions Lactate threshold tests can be a valid and reliable alternative to ventilatory thresholds to identify the workloads at the transition from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2522147339,"Adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (aGPCRs) play critical roles in diverse neurobiological processes including brain development, synaptogenesis, and myelination. aGPCRs have large alternatively spliced extracellular regions (ECRs) that likely mediate intercellular signaling; however, the precise roles of ECRs remain unclear. The aGPCR GPR56/ADGRG1 regulates both oligodendrocyte and cortical development. Accordingly, human GPR56 mutations cause myelination defects and brain malformations. Here, we determined the crystal structure of the GPR56 ECR, the first structure of any complete aGPCR ECR, in complex with an inverse-agonist monobody, revealing a GPCR-Autoproteolysis-Inducing domain and a previously unidentified domain that we term Pentraxin/Laminin/neurexin/sex-hormone-binding-globulin-Like (PLL). Strikingly, PLL domain deletion caused increased signaling and characterizes a GPR56 splice variant. Finally, we show that an evolutionarily conserved residue in the PLL domain is critical for oligodendrocyte development in vivo. Thus, our results suggest that the GPR56 ECR has unique and multifaceted regulatory functions, providing novel insights into aGPCR roles in neurobiology."
https://openalex.org/W2521199369,"The sensitivity for one's own internal body signals (i.e., interoception) has been demonstrated to play an important role in the pathogenesis of eating and weight disorders. Most previous measures assessing interoceptive processing have not, or only partly, captured perception of hunger and satiety cues, which is a core aspect of interoceptive deficits in eating disorders. In addition, methods used to measure sensitivity to gastric signals are heterogeneous and findings inconsistent. The primary aim of the present study was to establish a standardised test to measure gastric interoception, and to provide normative data using a non-clinical adult sample. The two-step Water Load Test (WLT-II) involves ingestion of non-caloric water until perceived satiation (step 1) and until maximum fullness (step 2). The WLT-II consists of several variables: Besides volumes of water ingested until satiation and maximum fullness expressed in ml, percentage of satiation to maximum fullness is calculated as an individual index of gastric interoception that is not confounded with stomach capacity. Ninety-nine healthy women participated in the study. Measures included the WLT-II, the heartbeat tracking test, a self-report questionnaire assessing subjective sensations, and the Eating Disorder Inventory-2. Twenty-eight participants underwent test-retest of the WLT-II. Results suggest that the WLT-II is a valid and reliable measure of gastric interoception. Importantly, satiation volume and percentage of satiation to maximum fullness were strongly positively related to self-reported bulimic symptoms, indicating that the WLT-II could emerge as a useful clinical tool to measure interoceptive processing in the field of eating disorders."

This paper presents (a) the genome sequence of the organism allowing the assignment to its correct subspeciation longum; (b) a comparative genome assessment with other B. longum strains and (c) the molecular structure of the 35624 exopolysaccharide (EPS624). Comparative genome analysis of the 35624 strain with other B. longum strains determined that the sub-speciation of the strain is longum and revealed the presence of a 35624-specific gene cluster, predicted to encode the biosynthetic machinery for EPS624. Following isolation and acid treatment of the EPS, its chemical structure was determined using gas and liquid chromatography for sugar constituent and linkage analysis, electrospray and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry for sequencing and NMR. The EPS consists of a branched hexasaccharide repeating unit containing two galactose and two glucose moieties, galacturonic acid and the unusual sugar 6-deoxy-L-talose. These data demonstrate that the B. longum 35624 strain has specific genetic features, one of which leads to the generation of a characteristic exopolysaccharide."
https://openalex.org/W2522909406,"The Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire is an internationally widely used instrument assessing different eating styles that may contribute to weight gain and overweight: emotional eating, external eating, and restraint. This study aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the 30-item German version of the DEBQ including its measurement invariance across gender, age, and BMI-status in a representative German population sample. Furthermore, we examined the distribution of eating styles in the general population and provide population-based norms for DEBQ scales. A representative sample of the German general population (N = 2513, age ≥ 14 years) was assessed with the German version of the DEBQ along with information on sociodemographic characteristics and body weight and height. The German version of the DEQB demonstrates good item characteristics and reliability (restraint: α = .92, emotional eating: α = .94, external eating: α = .89). The 3-factor structure of the DEBQ could be replicated in exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses and results of multi-group confirmatory factor analyses supported its metric and scalar measurement invariance across gender, age, and BMI-status. External eating was the most prevalent eating style in the German general population. Women scored higher on emotional and restrained eating scales than men, and overweight individuals scored higher in all three eating styles compared to normal weight individuals. Small differences across age were found for external eating. Norms were provided according to gender, age, and BMI-status. Our findings suggest that the German version of the DEBQ has good reliability and construct validity, and is suitable to reliably measure eating styles across age, gender, and BMI-status. Furthermore, the results demonstrate a considerable variation of eating styles across gender and BMI-status."
https://openalex.org/W2521678057,"Background and Objectives Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) during endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS–FNA) of pancreatic masses has been reported to be associated with improved adequacy and diagnostic yield. However, recent observational data on the impact of ROSE have reported conflicting results. A meta-analysis and systematic review was therefore conducted to evaluate the contribution of ROSE during EUS-FNA of pancreatic masses. Method A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE/Pubmed and EMBASE databases for studies comparing the efficacy of ROSE between patients in two cohorts. Outcomes considered included diagnostic adequate rate, diagnostic yield, number of needle passes, pooled sensitivity and specificity. Findings from a random-effects model were expressed as pooled risk difference (RD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results A total of 7 studies (1299 patients) was finally included and further analyzed in the current meta-analysis. EUS-FNA with ROSE could not improve diagnostic adequacy (RD = 0.05, 95% CI: -0.01–0.11) and diagnostic yield (RD = 0.04 95%CI: -0.05, 0.13). The number of needle passes showed no statistically significant difference with and without ROSE (RD = -0.68 95%CI: -2.35, 0.98). The pooled sensitivity and specificity of ROSE group were 0.91 (95%CI: 0.87, 0.94) and 1 (95%CI: 0.94, 1.00). The pooled sensitivity and specificity of non-ROSE group were 0.85 (95%CI: 0.80, 0.89) and 1 (95%CI: 0.95, 1.00). ROSE group and non-ROSE group showed comparable sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion Compared to historical reports of its clinical efficacy in patients with pancreatic lesions, ROSE may be not associated with an improvement of diagnostic yield, adequate rate, pooled sensitivity and specificity."

The current meta-analysis aimed to investigate the associations between vimentin and prognosis and progression in NSCLC.Databases with literature published in English, including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Science Direct, Wiley Online Library, Ovid, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, LILACS and Google Scholar, and the CNKI, VIP, CBM and WanFang databases in Chinese were used for the literature search. The key terms included (1) 'vimentin' OR 'vim' OR 'vmt' OR 'vm' OR 'hel113' OR 'ctrct30' and (2) 'pulmon*' OR 'lung' OR 'alveolar' and (3) 'cancer' OR 'carcinoma' OR 'tumor' OR 'adenocarcinoma' OR 'squamous' OR 'neoplas*' OR 'malignan*'. The data were combined by random effect model and the H value and I2 were used to assess the heterogeneity. All the meta-analysis was conducted using Stata 12.0.Thirty-two qualified studies (4118 cases) were included in the current meta-analysis. Twelve studies with 1750 patients were included to assess the significance of vimentin in the overall survival (OS) of NSCLC; the pooled hazard ratio (HR) was 1.831 (confidence interval (CI): 1.315-2.550, P<0.001) in the univariate analysis and 1.266 (CI: 0.906-1.768, P = 0.167) in the multivariate analysis. Four studies with 988 cases were applicable to determine the significance of vimentin in the disease-free survival (DFS) of NSCLC; the pooled HR of the DFS was 1.224 (CI: 0.921-1.628, P = 0.164) in the univariate analysis and 1.254 (CI: 0.985-1.956, P = 0.067) in the multivariate analysis. Regarding the relationships between vimentin and clinicopathological factors, the pooled odds ratio (OR) with 3406 NSCLCs indicated that up-regulated vimentin was associated with smoking (OR = 1.359, CI: 1.098-1.683, P = 0.004), poor differentiation (OR = 2.133, CI: 1.664-2.735, P<0.001), an advanced TNM stage (OR = 3.275, CI: 1.987-5.397, P<0.001), vascular invasion (OR = 3.492, CI: 1.063-11.472, P = 0.039), lymph node metastasis (OR = 2.628, CI: 1.857-3.718, P<0.001), recurrence (OR = 1.631, CI: 1.052-2.528, P = 0.029) and pleural invasion (OR = 2.346, CI: 1.397-3.941, P = 0.001). There was no significant correlation between vimentin and age, gender, diameter, T stage, distant metastasis, or marginal invasion (P>0.05).An overexpression of vimentin may predict the progression and an unfavorable survival of NSCLC.

https://openalex.org/W2522077953,"To introduce new genetic diversity into the bread wheat gene pool from its progenitor, Aegilops tauschii (Coss.) Schmalh, 33 primary synthetic hexaploid wheat genotypes (SYN) were crossed to 20 spring bread wheat (BW) cultivars at the International Wheat and Maize Improvement Center. Modified single seed descent was used to develop 97 populations with 50 individuals per population using first back-cross, biparental, and three-way crosses. Individuals from each cross were selected for short stature, early heading, flowering and maturity, minimal lodging, and free threshing. Yield trials were conducted under irrigated, drought, and heat-stress conditions from 2011 to 2014 in Ciudad Obregon, Mexico. Genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs) of parents and synthetic derived lines (SDLs) were estimated using a genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) model with markers in each trial. In each environment, there were SDLs that had higher GEBVs than their recurrent BW parent for yield. The GEBVs of BW parents for yield ranged from -0.32 in heat to 1.40 in irrigated trials. The range of the SYN parent GEBVs for yield was from -2.69 in the irrigated to 0.26 in the heat trials and were mostly negative across environments. The contribution of the SYN parents to improved grain yield of the SDLs was highest under heat stress, with an average GEBV for the top 10% of the SDLs of 0.55 while the weighted average GEBV of their corresponding recurrent BW parents was 0.26. Using the pedigree-based model, the accuracy of genomic prediction for yield was 0.42, 0.43, and 0.49 in the drought, heat and irrigated trials, respectively, while for the marker-based model these values were 0.43, 0.44, and 0.55. The SYN parents introduced novel diversity into the wheat gene pool. Higher GEBVs of progenies were due to introgression and retention of some positive alleles from SYN parents."
https://openalex.org/W2521476867,"Endophytes proved to exert multiple effects on host plants, including growth promotion, stress resistance. However, whether endophytes have a role in metabolites shaping of grape has not been fully understood. Eight endophytic fungal strains which originally isolated from grapevines were re-inoculated to field-grown grapevines in this study, and their effects on both leaves and berries of grapevines at maturity stage were assessed, with special focused on secondary metabolites and antioxidant activities. High-density inoculation of all these endophytic fungal strains modified the physio-chemical status of grapevine to different degrees. Fungal inoculations promoted the content of reducing sugar (RS), total flavonoids (TF), total phenols (TPh), trans-resveratrol (Res) and activities of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), in both leaves and berries of grapevine. Inoculation of endophytic fungal strains, CXB-11 (Nigrospora sp.) and CXC-13 (Fusarium sp.) conferred greater promotion effects in grape metabolic re-shaping, compared to other used fungal strains. Additionally, inoculation of different strains of fungal endophytes led to establish different metabolites patterns of wine grape. The work implies the possibility of using endophytic fungi as fine-tuning regulator to shape the quality and character of wine grape."
https://openalex.org/W2521799152,"Background NF-κB activation, pathogen invasion, polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) transmigration (PMNT) across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) are the pathogenic triad hallmark features of bacterial meningitis, but the mechanisms underlying these events remain largely unknown. Vimentin, which is a novel NF-κB regulator, is the primary receptor for the major Escherichia coli K1 virulence factor IbeA that contributes to the pathogenesis of neonatal bacterial sepsis and meningitis (NSM). We have previously shown that IbeA-induced NF-κB signaling through its primary receptor vimentin as well as its co-receptor PTB-associated splicing factor (PSF) is required for pathogen penetration and leukocyte transmigration across the BBB. This is the first in vivo study to demonstrate how vimentin and related factors contributed to the pathogenic triad of bacterial meningitis. Methodology/Principal Findings The role of vimentin in IbeA+ E. coli K1-induced NF-κB activation, pathogen invasion, leukocyte transmigration across the BBB has now been demonstrated by using vimentin knockout (KO) mice. In the in vivo studies presented here, IbeA-induced NF-κB activation, E. coli K1 invasion and polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) transmigration across the BBB were significantly reduced in Vim-/- mice. Decreased neuronal injury in the hippocampal dentate gyrus was observed in Vim-/- mice with meningitis. The major inflammatory regulator α7 nAChR and several signaling molecules contributing to NF-κB activation (p65 and p-CamKII) were significantly reduced in the brain tissues of the Vim-/- mice with E. coli meningitis. Furthermore, Vim KO resulted in significant reduction in neuronal injury and in α7 nAChR-mediated calcium signaling. Conclusion/Significance Vimentin, a novel NF-κB regulator, plays a detrimental role in the host defense against meningitic infection by modulating the NF-κB signaling pathway to increase pathogen invasion, PMN recruitment, BBB permeability and neuronal inflammation. Our findings provide the first evidence for Vim-dependent mechanisms underlying the pathogenic triad of bacterial meningitis."
https://openalex.org/W2523613662,"Background Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a chronic and spontaneous oral pain with burning quality in the tongue or other oral mucosa without any identifiable oral lesion or laboratory finding. Pathogenesis and etiology of BMS are still unknown. However, BMS has been associated with other chronic pain syndromes including other idiopathic orofacial pain, the dynias group and the family of central sensitivity syndromes. This would imply that BMS shares common mechanisms with other cephalic and/or extracephalic chronic pains. The primary aim of this systematic review was to determine whether BMS is actually associated with other pain syndromes, and to analyze cephalic and extracephalic somatosensory sensitivity in these patients. Methods This report followed the PRISMA Statement. An electronic search was performed until January 2015 in PubMed, Cochrane library, Wiley and ScienceDirect. Searched terms included “burning mouth syndrome OR stomatodynia OR glossodynia OR burning tongue OR oral burning”. Studies were selected according to predefined inclusion criteria (report of an association between BMS and other pain(s) symptoms or of cutaneous cephalic and/or extracephalic quantitative sensory testing in BMS patients), and a descriptive analysis conducted. Results The search retrieved 1512 reports. Out of these, twelve articles met criteria for co-occurring pain symptoms and nine studies for quantitative sensory testing (QST) in BMS patients. The analysis reveals that in BMS patients co-occurring pain symptoms are rare, assessed by only 0.8% (12 of 1512) of the retrieved studies. BMS was associated with headaches, TMD, atypical facial pain, trigeminal neuralgia, post-herpetic facial pain, back pain, fibromyalgia, joint pain, abdominal pain, rectal pain or vulvodynia. However, the prevalence of pain symptoms in BMS patients is not different from that in the age-matched general population. QST studies reveal no or inconsistent evidence of abnormal cutaneous cephalic and extracephalic somatosensory sensitivity. Conclusions There is no evidence for a high rate of other pain symptoms or somatosensory impairments co-occurring with BMS. These results thus suggest that BMS rather depends on specific mechanisms, likely at the trigeminal level. Nevertheless, more thoroughly conducted research is required to draw definitive conclusion."
https://openalex.org/W2522386721,"Platelets contribute to inflammation however, the role of platelet activation during the pathophysiological response to invasive bacterial infection and sepsis is not clear. Herein, we have investigated platelet activation in a mouse model of invasive Streptococcus pyogenes infection at 5, 12, and 18 hours post infection and correlated this to parameters of infection. The platelet population in ex-vivo blood samples showed no increased integrin activation or surface presentation of CD62P, however platelet-neutrophil complex formation and plasma levels of CD62P were increased during bacterial dissemination and the progression of sepsis, indicating that platelet activation had occurred in vivo. Platelet-neutrophil complex formation was the most discriminatory marker of platelet activation. Platelet-neutrophil complexes were increased above baseline levels during early sepsis but decreased to significantly lower levels than baseline during late sepsis. The removal of these complexes from the circulation coincided with a significant increase in organ damage and the accumulation of platelets in the liver sinusoids, suggesting that platelet activation in the circulation precedes accumulation of platelets in damaged organs. The results demonstrate that monitoring platelet activation using complementary methods may provide prognostic information during the pathogenesis of invasive S. pyogenes infection."
https://openalex.org/W2522702698,"Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), as MAMP molecules, trigger the activation of signal transduction pathways involved in defence. Currently, plant metabolomics is providing new dimensions into understanding the intracellular adaptive responses to external stimuli. The effect of LPS on the metabolomes of Arabidopsis thaliana cells and leaf tissue was investigated over a 24 h period. Cellular metabolites and those secreted into the medium were extracted with methanol and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry was used for quantitative and qualitative analyses. Multivariate statistical data analyses were used to extract interpretable information from the generated multidimensional LC-MS data. The results show that LPS perception triggered differential changes in the metabolomes of cells and leaves, leading to variation in the biosynthesis of specialised secondary metabolites. Time-dependent changes in metabolite profiles were observed and biomarkers associated with the LPS-induced response were tentatively identified. These include the phytohormones salicylic acid and jasmonic acid, and also the associated methyl esters and sugar conjugates. The induced defensive state resulted in increases in indole—and other glucosinolates, indole derivatives, camalexin as well as cinnamic acid derivatives and other phenylpropanoids. These annotated metabolites indicate dynamic reprogramming of metabolic pathways that are functionally related towards creating an enhanced defensive capacity. The results reveal new insights into the mode of action of LPS as an activator of plant innate immunity, broadens knowledge about the defence metabolite pathways involved in Arabidopsis responses to LPS, and identifies specialised metabolites of functional importance that can be employed to enhance immunity against pathogen infection."
https://openalex.org/W2521169133,"Landscape connectivity describes how the movement of animals relates to landscape structure. The way in which movement among populations is affected by environmental conditions is important for predicting the effects of habitat fragmentation, and for defining conservation corridors. One approach has been to map resistance surfaces to characterize how environmental variables affect animal movement, and to use these surfaces to model connectivity. However, current connectivity modelling typically uses information on species location or habitat preference rather than movement, which unfortunately may not capture dispersal limitations. Here we emphasize the importance of implementing dispersal ecology into landscape connectivity, i.e., observing patterns of habitat selection by dispersers during different phases of new areas' colonization to infer habitat connectivity. Disperser animals undertake a complex sequence of movements concatenated over time and strictly dependent on species ecology. Using satellite telemetry, we investigated the movement ecology of 54 young male elk Cervus elaphus, which commonly disperse, to design a corridor network across the Northern Rocky Mountains. Winter residency period is often followed by a spring-summer movement phase, when young elk migrate with mothers' groups to summering areas, and by a further dispersal bout performed alone to a novel summer area. After another summer residency phase, dispersers usually undertake a final autumnal movement to reach novel wintering areas. We used resource selection functions to identify winter and summer habitats selected by elk during residency phases. We then extracted movements undertaken during spring to move from winter to summer areas, and during autumn to move from summer to winter areas, and modelled them using step selection functions. We built friction surfaces, merged the different movement phases, and eventually mapped least-cost corridors. We showed an application of this tool by creating a scenario with movement predicted as there were no roads, and mapping highways' segments impeding elk connectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2523316909,"Blunt impact produces a heterogeneous brain injury in people and in animal models of traumatic brain injury. We report that a single closed head impact to adult C57/BL6 mice produced two injury syndromes (CHI-1 and CHI-2). CHI-1 mice spontaneously reinitiated breathing after injury while CHI-2 mice had prolonged apnea and regained breathing only after cardiopulmonary resuscitation and supplementation of 100% O2. The CHI-1 group significantly regained righting reflex more rapidly than the CHI-2 group. At 7 days post-injury, CHI-1, but not CHI-2 mice, acquired but had no long-term retention of an active place avoidance task. The behavioral deficits of CHI-1 and CHI-2 mice were retained one-month after the injury. CHI-1 mice had loss of hippocampal neurons and localized white matter injury at one month after injury. CHI-2 had a larger loss of hippocampal neurons and more widespread loss of myelin and axons. High-speed videos made during the injury were followed by assessment of breathing and righting reflex. These videos show that CHI-2 mice experienced a larger vertical g-force than CHI-1 mice. Time to regain righting reflex in CHI-2 mice significantly correlated with vertical g-force. Thus, physiological responses occurring immediately after injury can be valuable surrogate markers of subsequent behavioral and histological deficits."
https://openalex.org/W2521378516,"Epidermal structures are different among body sites, and proliferative keratinocytes in the epidermis play an important role in the maintenance of the epidermal structures. In recent years, intravital skin imaging has been used in mammalian skin research for the investigation of cell behaviors, but most of these experiments were performed with rodent ears. Here, we established a non-invasive intravital imaging approach for dorsal, ear, hind paw, or tail skin using R26H2BEGFP hairless mice. Using four-dimensional (x, y, z, and time) imaging, we successfully visualized mitotic cell division in epidermal basal cells. A comparison of cell division orientation relative to the basement membrane in each body site revealed that most divisions in dorsal and ear epidermis occurred in parallel, whereas the cell divisions in hind paw and tail epidermis occurred both in parallel and oblique orientations. Based on the quantitative analysis of the four-dimensional images, we showed that the epidermal thickness correlated with the basal cell density and the rate of the oblique divisions."
https://openalex.org/W2522930893,"The pineapple (Ananas comosus) is cold sensitive. Most cultivars are injured during winter periods, especially in sub-tropical regions. There is a lack of molecular information on the pineapple’s response to cold stress. In this study, high-throughput transcriptome sequencing and gene expression analysis were performed on plantlets of a cold-tolerant genotype of the pineapple cultivar ‘Shenwan’ before and after cold treatment. A total of 1,186 candidate cold responsive genes were identified, and their credibility was confirmed by RT-qPCR. Gene set functional enrichment analysis indicated that genes related to cell wall properties, stomatal closure and ABA and ROS signal transduction play important roles in pineapple cold tolerance. In addition, a protein association network of CORs (cold responsive genes) was predicted, which could serve as an entry point to dissect the complex cold response network. Our study found a series of candidate genes and their association network, which will be helpful to cold stress response studies and pineapple breeding for cold tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2522630444,"Background Several studies in the domain of professional musicians describe the relation between playing time and the occurrence of musculoskeletal complaints in professional musicians. To date, no longitudinal cohort study into this relationship has been performed and no amateur musicians were studied. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the causal relationship between a sudden increase in playing time among amateur musicians on the occurrence of musculoskeletal complaints in a prospective cohort study. Methods All members of two national Dutch Students Orchestras were asked to participate in the study. These project-based orchestras, consisting of high-level amateurs, followed a nine-hour rehearsing schedule for ten consecutive days. On the first day (t0) and after one week (t1) the subjects were asked to complete a paper-based questionnaire including sociodemographic characteristics, music-related questions, questions regarding playing-related musculoskeletal complaints and the music module of the disabilities of arm, shoulder and hand questionnaire. Results The NSO consisted of 85 and the NESKO of 41 members during the study period. 59 subjects completed the questionnaire at both timepoints (response rate 47%). 9 subjects were excluded for being a music academy student, leaving 50 subjects (mean age 22.1, 72% female) suitable for analysis. During the rehearsal week, the prevalence of at least one playing-related musculoskeletal complaint increased from 28% to 80%. The most frequently affected areas were the neck, upper and lower back, hand/and or wrists and shoulders. The DASH music module score increased from 14 at t0 to 23 at t1. Conclusion A point prevalence of 28% at the start of the study that increased remarkably to 80% within a one-week period. Future research should evaluate other risk factors for musculoskeletal complaints in amateur musicians. These risk factors should be the base for the development of preventive measures."

Prior studies repeatedly showed that cultures of skin lesions diagnosed as are usually negative. However, lack of a gold standard for diagnosis (against which culture might be judged) and failure to assess the human immune response are important limitations of prior work. In this pilot study, we aimed to develop a criterion standard for research on bacterial cellulitis, to evaluate the sensitivity of procalcitonin for bacterial cellulitis, and to use gene expression analysis to find other candidate diagnostic markers.


Methods 
We classified lesions via biopsies, 16s rRNA gene detection, culture, and histopathology. We quantified procalcitonin expression in blood. We also used Nanostring technology to quantify transcription of immunomodulators that may distinguish cases from inflamed controls.


Results 
Of 28 participants, 15 had a clinical diagnosis of cellulitis, six had a diagnosis of non-infectious dermatitis, and seven were normal volunteers. Of the “cellulitis” patients, three (20%) had pathogens isolated, and were designated confirmed cases. Procalcitonin was undetectable in all three. HLA-DQA1 was expressed 34-fold more in confirmed cases vs. controls (fold change of geometric mean). Heat maps depicting multiplex gene expression analysis revealed a distinct profile of gene expression in confirmed cases relative to comparators.


Conclusions 
Most “cellulitis” patients had microbiologically-negative biopsies. Procalcitonin was undetectable, and HLA-DQA1 elevated, in confirmed bacterial cases. Multivariable transcriptomic profiling results supported our algorithm’s ability to identify patients with true bacterial cellulitis. A larger sample may allow discovery of an immunological signature capable of distinguishing bacterial cellulitis from its mimics in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2521687612,"Background An epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) from 2013–16 posed a serious risk of global spread during its early growth phase. A post-epidemic evaluation of the effectiveness of travel restrictions has yet to be conducted. The present study aimed to estimate the effectiveness of travel restrictions in reducing the risk of importation from mid-August to September, 2014, using a simple hazard-based statistical model. Methodology/Principal Findings The hazard rate was modeled as an inverse function of the effective distance, an excellent predictor of disease spread, which was calculated from the airline transportation network. By analyzing datasets of the date of EVD case importation from the 15th of July to the 15th of September 2014, and assuming that the network structure changed from the 8th of August 2014 because of travel restrictions, parameters that characterized the hazard rate were estimated. The absolute risk reduction and relative risk reductions due to travel restrictions were estimated to be less than 1% and about 20%, respectively, for all models tested. Effectiveness estimates among African countries were greater than those for other countries outside Africa. Conclusions The travel restrictions were not effective enough to expect the prevention of global spread of Ebola virus disease. It is more efficient to control the spread of disease locally during an early phase of an epidemic than to attempt to control the epidemic at international borders. Capacity building for local containment and coordinated and expedited international cooperation are essential to reduce the risk of global transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2522565216,"Polygalacturonase is one of the pectin hydrolytic enzymes involved in various developmental and physiological processes such as seed germination, organ abscission, pod and anther dehiscence, and xylem cell formation. To date, no systematic analysis of polygalacturonase incorporating genome organization, gene structure, and expression profiling has been conducted in soybean (Glycine max var. Williams 82). In this study, we identified 112 GmPG genes from the soybean Wm82.a2v1 genome. These genes were classified into three groups, group I (105 genes), group II (5 genes), and group III (2 genes). Fifty-four pairs of duplicate paralogous genes were preferentially identified from duplicated regions of the soybean genome, which implied that long segmental duplications significantly contributed to the expansion of the GmPG gene family. Moreover, GmPG transcripts were analyzed in various tissues using RNA-seq data. The results showed the differential expression of 64 GmPGs in the tissue and partially redundant expression of some duplicate genes, while others showed functional diversity. These findings suggested that the GmPGs were retained by substantial subfunctionalization during the soybean evolutionary processes. Finally, evolutionary analysis based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in wild and cultivated soybeans revealed that 107 GmPGs had selected site(s), which indicated that these genes may have undergone strong selection during soybean domestication. Among them, one non-synonymous SNP of GmPG031 affected floral development during selection, which was consistent with the results of RNA-seq and evolutionary analyses. Thus, our results contribute to the functional characterization of GmPG genes in soybean."

A standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed. The insulin sensitivity index (ISI), insulinogenic index (IGI) and oral disposition index (ODI) were calculated from dynamic values of glucose and insulin obtained during OGTT.In our study population, mean ISI was 3.5 ± 2.5, median IGI was 1.2 (0.7-1.8), mean ODI 4.5 ± 4.5. In univariate correlation analysis, ISI correlated inversely with systolic blood pressure (sBP) (R = -0.52, p = 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (dBP) (R = -0.45, p = 0.004) and complement C3 (R = -0.43, p = 0.006) and ODI correlated inversely with sBP (R = -0.38, p = 0.02), dBP (R = -0.35, p = 0.03) and complement C3 (R = -0.37, p = 0.02). No significant correlations were found between analyzed variables and IGI. In a stepwise multiple regression, only complement C3 entered in the regression equation and accounted for approximately 50% of the variance of ISI. Using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve we identified the best cut-off for complement C3 of 1.32 g/L that yielded a sensitivity of 56% and a specificity of 96% for classification of insulin resistant patients.In conclusion, our data suggest that serum complement C3 could represent a useful marker of whole-body insulin sensitivity in PsA patients."

Surfactant Proteins (SP) A, B, C and D were recently identified as inherent proteins of the CNS. Aim of the study was to investigate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) SP levels in hydrocephalus patients compared to normal subjects.CSF SP A-D levels were quantified using commercially available ELISA kits in 126 patients (0-84 years, mean 39 years). 60 patients without CNS pathologies served as a control group. Hydrocephalus patients were separated in aqueductal stenosis (AQS, n = 24), acute hydrocephalus without aqueductal stenosis (acute HC w/o AQS, n = 16) and idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH, n = 20). Furthermore, six patients with pseudotumor cerebri were investigated.SP A-D are present under physiological conditions in human CSF. SP-A is elevated in diseases accompanied by ventricular enlargement (AQS, acute HC w/o AQS) in a significant manner (0.67, 1.21 vs 0.38 ng/ml in control, p<0.001). SP-C is also elevated in hydrocephalic conditions (AQS, acute HC w/o AQS; 0.87, 1.71 vs. 0.48 ng/ml in controls, p<0.001) and in Pseudotumor cerebri (1.26 vs. 0.48 ng/ml in controls, p<0.01). SP-B and SP-D did not show significant alterations.The present study confirms the presence of SPs in human CSF. There are significant changes of SP-A and SP-C levels in diseases affecting brain water circulation and elevation of intracranial pressure. Cause of the alterations, underlying regulatory mechanisms, as well as diagnostic and therapeutic consequences of cerebral SP's requires further thorough investigations."
https://openalex.org/W2522869212,"Background Attention function filters and selects behaviorally relevant information. This capacity is impaired in some psychiatric disorders and has been proposed as an endophenotype for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder; however, its genetic basis remains largely unknown. This study aimed to identify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) associated with attention function. Materials and Methods The discovery sample included 1655 children (7–12 years) and the replication sample included 546 children (5–8 years). Five attention outcomes were assessed using the computerized Attentional Network Test (ANT): alerting, orienting, executive attention, Hit Reaction time (HRT) and the standard error of HRT (HRTSE). A Genome-wide Association Study was conducted for each outcome. Gene set enrichment analyses were performed to detect biological pathways associated with attention outcomes. Additional neuroimaging analyses were conducted to test neural effects of detected SNPs of interest. Results Thirteen loci showed suggestive evidence of association with attention function (P<10−5) in the discovery sample. One of them, the rs4321351 located in the PID1 gene, was nominally significant in the replication sample although it did not survive multiple testing correction. Neuroimaging analysis revealed a significant association between this SNP and brain structure and function involving the frontal-basal ganglia circuits. The mTOR signaling and Alzheimer disease-amyloid secretase pathways were significantly enriched for alerting, orienting and HRT respectively (FDR<5%). Conclusion These results suggest for the first time the involvement of the PID1 gene, mTOR signaling and Alzheimer disease-amyloid secretase pathways, in attention function during childhood. These genes and pathways have been proposed to play a role in neuronal plasticity, memory and neurodegenerative disease."

In a context of generalized HIV epidemiology, we assessed paediatric anti-HBV vaccine response according to HIV status, feeding option and age in a tropical context.Prospective, observational and cross-sectional study conducted among 82 children (27 [IQR: 9-47] months, min-max: 6-59), after complete anti-HBV vaccination (Zilbrix Hepta: 10μg AgHBs) at the Essos Health Centre in Yaounde, Cameroon, classified as group-A: HIV unexposed (28), group-B: HIV-exposed/uninfected (29), group-C: HIV-infected (25). Quantitative anti-HBs ELISA was interpreted as ""no"", ""low-"" or ""protective-response"" with <1, 1-10, or ≥10 IU/L respectively; with p-value<0.05 considered significant.Children were all HBV-unexposed (AcHBc-negative) and uninfected (HBsAg-negative). Response to anti-HBV vaccine was 80.49% (66/82), with only 45.12% (37/82) developed a protective-response (≥10IU/L). According to HIV status, 60.71% (17/28) developed a protective-response in group-A, vs. 51.72% (15/29) and 20% (5/25) in group-B and group-C respectively, Odds Ratio (OR): 2.627 [CI95% 0.933-7.500], p = 0.041. According to feeding option during first six months of life, 47.67% (21/45) developed a protective-response on exclusive breastfeeding vs. 43.24% (16/37) on mixed or formula feeding, OR: 1.148 [CI95% 0.437-3.026], p = 0.757. According to age, protective-response decreased significantly as children grow older: 58.33% (28/48) <24 months vs. 26.47% (9/34) ≥24 months, OR: 3.889 [CI95% 1.362-11.356], p = 0.004; and specifically 67.65% (23/34) ≤6 months vs. 0%, (0/5) 33-41 months, p = 0.008.Anti-HBV vaccine provides low rate of protection (<50%) among children in general, and particularly if HIV-exposed, infected and/or older children. Implementing policies for early vaccination, specific immunization algorithm for HIV-exposed/infected children, and monitoring vaccine response would ensure effective protection in tropical settings, pending extensive/confirmatory investigations."
https://openalex.org/W2522996094,"5-FU based chemotherapy is the most common first line regimen used for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Identification of predictive markers of response to chemotherapy is a challenging approach for drug selection. The present study analyzes the predictive role of 5-FU degradation rate (5-FUDR) and genetic polymorphisms (MTHFR, TSER, DPYD) on survival.Genetic polymorphisms of MTHFR, TSER and DPYD, and the 5-FUDR of homogenous patients with mCRC were retrospectively studied. Genetic markers and the 5-FUDR were correlated with clinical outcome.133 patients affected by mCRC, treated with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy from 2009 to 2014, were evaluated. Patients were classified into three metabolic classes, according to normal distribution of 5-FUDR in more than 1000 patients, as previously published: poor-metabolizer (PM) with 5-FU-DR ≤ 0,85 ng/ml/106 cells/min (8 pts); normal metabolizer with 0,85 < 5-FU-DR < 2,2 ng/ml/106 cells/min (119 pts); ultra-rapid metabolizer (UM) with 5-FU-DR ≥ 2,2 ng/ml/106 cells/min (6 pts). PM and UM groups showed a longer PFS respect to normal metabolizer group (14.5 and 11 months respectively vs 8 months; p = 0.029). A higher G3-4 toxicity rate was observed in PM and UM, respect to normal metabolizer (50% in both PM and UM vs 18%; p = 0.019). No significant associations between genes polymorphisms and outcomes or toxicities were observed.5-FUDR seems to be significantly involved in predicting survival of patients who underwent 5-FU based CHT for mCRC. Although our findings require confirmation in large prospective studies, they reinforce the concept that individual genetic variation may allow personalized selection of chemotherapy to optimize clinical outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2521473893,"Introduction Concerns about risk compensation—increased risk behaviours in response to a perception of reduced HIV transmission risk—after the initiation of ART have largely been dispelled in empirical studies, but other changes in sexual networking patterns may still modify the effects of ART on HIV incidence. Methods We developed an exploratory mathematical model of HIV transmission that incorporates the possibility of ART clusters, i.e. subsets of the sexual network in which the density of ART patients is much higher than in the rest of the network. Such clusters may emerge as a result of ART homophily—a tendency for ART patients to preferentially form and maintain relationships with other ART patients. We assessed whether ART clusters may affect the impact of ART on HIV incidence, and how the influence of this effect-modifying variable depends on contextual variables such as HIV prevalence, HIV serosorting, coverage of HIV testing and ART, and adherence to ART. Results ART homophily can modify the impact of ART on HIV incidence in both directions. In concentrated epidemics and generalized epidemics with moderate HIV prevalence (≈ 10%), ART clusters can enhance the impact of ART on HIV incidence, especially when adherence to ART is poor. In hyperendemic settings (≈ 35% HIV prevalence), ART clusters can reduce the impact of ART on HIV incidence when adherence to ART is high but few people living with HIV (PLWH) have been diagnosed. In all contexts, the effects of ART clusters on HIV epidemic dynamics are distinct from those of HIV serosorting. Conclusions Depending on the programmatic and epidemiological context, ART clusters may enhance or reduce the impact of ART on HIV incidence, in contrast to serosorting, which always leads to a lower impact of ART on HIV incidence. ART homophily and the emergence of ART clusters should be measured empirically and incorporated into more refined models used to plan and evaluate ART programmes."

HPV vaccination paired with adequate knowledge about HPV infection provides the best protection against cervical cancer. To identify the level of knowledge and the health beliefs towards HPV and the HPV vaccine among HPV-vaccinated female students in Malaysia. A nationwide cross-sectional survey among 14 years old female students who had received three doses of the HPV vaccine was conducted in 32 randomly selected schools from 13 states and 3 federal territories in Malaysia between February 2013 and April 2013. Among 2482 respondents, knowledge about HPV infection and the HPV vaccine was extremely poor. The mean total knowledge score was only 3.56 (SD ± 1.76), out of a possible score of 10. The majority of respondents were unaware that vaccinating boys with HPV can help protect girls against HPV infection (91.6%), HPV cannot be cured (81.6%) and that HPV is a sexually transmitted infection (70.3%). Most of the respondents had the misconception that only females get HPV (95.1%), and that the HPV vaccine eliminates the need for Pap smear tests (68.3%). Most respondents (91.6%) believed that they would not get an HPV infection. Almost half of the respondents (42.9%) held the misconception that HPV infection could not lead to serious illness. Findings revealed poor knowledge about both HPV and the HPV vaccine, low perceived susceptibility to HPV infection and misinformation about HPV infection among HPV-vaccinated girls. Therefore, it is essential to increase the knowledge and awareness of health risks regarding HPV infection among teenaged girls who have received the HPV vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W2521632196,"Catecholamines induce intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus enhancing diastolic Ca2+ leakage through the ryanodine receptor during heart failure (HF). However, little is known regarding the effect of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) on ROS generation and Ca2+ handling in failing cardiomyocytes. The aim of the present study was to clarify the mechanism by which an exogenous ANP exerts cardioprotective effects during HF. Cardiomyocytes were isolated from the left ventricles of a canine tachycardia-induced HF model and sham-operated vehicle controls. The degree of mitochondrial oxidized DNA was evaluated by double immunohistochemical (IHC) staining using an anti-VDAC antibody for the mitochondria and an anti-8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine antibody for oxidized DNA. The effect of ANP on ROS was investigated using 2,7-dichlorofluorescin diacetate, diastolic Ca2+ sparks assessed by confocal microscopy using Fluo 4-AM, and the survival rate of myocytes after 48 h. The double IHC study revealed that isoproterenol (ISO) markedly increased oxidized DNA in the mitochondria in HF and that the ISO-induced DNA damage was markedly inhibited by the co-presence of ANP. ROS production and Ca2+ spark frequency (CaSF) were increased in HF compared to normal controls, and were further increased in the presence of ISO. Notably, ANP significantly suppressed both ISO-induced ROS and CaSF without changing sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ content in HF (p<0.01, respectively). The survival rate after 48 h in HF was significantly decreased in the presence of ISO compared with baseline (p<0.01), whereas it was significantly improved by the co-presence of ANP (p<0.01). Together, our results suggest that ANP strongly suppresses ISO-induced mitochondrial ROS generation, which might correct aberrant diastolic Ca2+ sparks, eventually contributing to the improvement of cardiomyocyte survival in HF."
https://openalex.org/W2522004533,"Methoprene tolerant protein (Met) has recently been confirmed as the long-sought juvenile hormone (JH) receptor. This protein plays a significant role in the cross-talk of the 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) and JH signalling pathways, which are important for control of insect development and maturation. Met belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix/Per-Arnt-Sim (bHLH-PAS) family of transcription factors. In these proteins, bHLH domains are typically responsible for DNA binding and dimerization, whereas the PAS domains are crucial for the choice of dimerization partner and the specificity of target gene activation. The C-terminal region is usually responsible for the regulation of protein complex activity. The sequence of the Met C-terminal region (MetC) is not homologous to any sequence deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and has not been structurally characterized to date. In this study, we show that the MetC exhibits properties typical for an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP). The final averaged structure obtained with small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments indicates that intrinsically disordered MetC exists in an extended conformation. This extended shape and the long unfolded regions characterise proteins with high flexibility and dynamics. Therefore, we suggest that the multiplicity of conformations adopted by the disordered MetC is crucial for its activity as a biological switch modulating the cross-talk of different signalling pathways in insects."
https://openalex.org/W2523276378,"Genes of selenoproteome have been increasingly implicated in various aspects of neurobiology and neurological disorders, but remain largely elusive in Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study, we investigated the selenotranscriptome (24 selenoproteins in total) in five brain regions (cerebellum, substantia nigra, cortex, pons and hippocampus) by real time qPCR in a two-phase manner using a mouse model of chronic PD. A wide range of changes in selenotranscriptome was observed in a manner depending on selenoproteins and brain regions. While Selv mRNA was not detectable and Dio1& 3 mRNA levels were not affected, 1, 11 and 9 selenoproteins displayed patterns of increase only, decrease only, and mixed response, respectively, in these brain regions of PD mice. In particular, the mRNA expression of Gpx1-4 showed only a decreased trend in the PD mouse brains. In substantia nigra, levels of 17 selenoprotein mRNAs were significantly decreased whereas no selenoprotein was up-regulated in the PD mice. In contrast, the majority of selenotranscriptome did not change and a few selenoprotein mRNAs that respond displayed a mixed pattern of up- and down-regulation in cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus, and/or pons of the PD mice. Gpx4, Sep15, Selm, Sepw1, and Sepp1 mRNAs were most abundant across all these five brain regions. Our results showed differential responses of selenoproteins in various brain regions of the PD mouse model, providing critical selenotranscriptomic profiling for future functional investigation of individual selenoprotein in PD etiology."

https://openalex.org/W2522347104,"Dioxygenase (dOx) utilizes stereospecific oxidation on aromatic molecules; consequently, dOx has potential applications in bioremediation and stereospecific oxidation synthesis. The reactive components of dOx comprise a Rieske structure Cys2[2Fe-2S]His2 and a non-heme reactive oxygen center (ROC). Between the Rieske structure and the ROC, a universally conserved Asp residue appears to bridge the two structures forming a Rieske-Asp-ROC triad, where the Asp is known to be essential for electron transfer processes. The Rieske and ROC share hydrogen bonds with Asp through their His ligands; suggesting an ideal network for electron transfer via the carboxyl side chain of Asp. Associated with the dOx is an itinerant charge carrying protein Ferredoxin (Fdx). Depending on the specific cognate, Fdx may also possess either the Rieske structure or a related structure known as 4-Cys-[2Fe-2S] (4-Cys). In this study, we extensively explore, at different levels of theory, the behavior of the individual components (Rieske and ROC) and their interaction together via the Asp using a variety of density function methods, basis sets, and a method known as Generalized Ionic Fragment Approach (GIFA) that permits setting up spin configurations manually. We also report results on the 4-Cys structure for comparison. The individual optimized structures are compared with observed spectroscopic data from the Rieske, 4-Cys and ROC structures (where information is available). The separate pieces are then combined together into a large Rieske-Asp-ROC (donor/bridge/acceptor) complex to estimate the overall coupling between individual components, based on changes to the partial charges. The results suggest that the partial charges are significantly altered when Asp bridges the Rieske and the ROC; hence, long range coupling through hydrogen bonding effects via the intercalated Asp bridge can drastically affect the partial charge distributions compared to the individual isolated structures. The results are consistent with a proton coupled electron transfer mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2523461265,"In China, species of Atraphaxis (Polygonaceae) primarily inhabit arid zones across temperate steppe and desert regions. The complex geologic history (e.g., expansion of deserts) and extreme climate shifts of the region appear to have played an important role in shaping the phylogeography of Atraphaxis. The present study focuses on species-level phylogeographic patterns of Atraphaxis in China, with the goal of determining the impact of past environmental changes, in northern China, on the evolutionary history of the genus. Five hundred and sixty-four individuals distributed among 71 populations of 11 species of Atraphaxis from across the geographic range of the genus were studied using sequence data from two plastid spacers, psbK-psbI and psbB-psbH. The results demonstrate that most chloroplast haplotypes are species-specific, except for some present among widespread species. The phylogeny of Atraphaxis was well structured, and molecular dating analyses suggest that the main divergence events occurred during the late Pliocene and Pleistocene (5.73–0.03 million years ago). The statistical dispersal-vicariance analysis (S-DIVA) results provide evidence that phylogeographic patterns for the genus were characterized by both vicariance events and regional dispersal. The presented data suggest that the rapid expansion of deserts and climatic changes in northern China during the late Pliocene and Pleistocene have driven the diversification and spread of Atraphaxis in the region. The expansion of the Tengger Desert provided appropriate conditions for the origin of A. bracteata. Additionally, a contact zone in the north of the Hexi Corridor was identified as having played a significant role as a migratory route for species in adjacent areas."
https://openalex.org/W2521317258,"Background This study assessed the risk of developing acute coronary syndrome requiring hospitalization in association with the use of certain antipsychotic medications in schizophrenia patients. Methods A nationwide cohort of 31,177 inpatients with schizophrenia between the ages of 18 and 65 years whose records were enrolled in the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan from 2000 to 2008 and were studied after encrypting the identifications. Cases (n = 147) were patients with subsequent acute coronary syndrome requiring hospitalization after their first psychiatric admission. Based on a nested case-control design, each case was matched with 20 controls for age, sex and the year of first psychiatric admission using risk-set sampling. The effects of antipsychotic agents on the development of acute coronary syndrome were assessed using multiple conditional logistic regression and sensitivity analyses to confirm any association. Results We found that current use of aripiprazole (adjusted risk ratio [RR] = 3.68, 95% CI: 1.27–10.64, p<0.05) and chlorpromazine (adjusted RR = 2.96, 95% CI: 1.40–6.24, p<0.001) were associated with a dose-dependent increase in the risk of developing acute coronary syndrome. Although haloperidol was associated with an increased risk (adjusted RR = 2.03, 95% CI: 1.20–3.44, p<0.01), there was no clear dose-dependent relationship. These three antipsychotic agents were also associated with an increased risk in the first 30 days of use, and the risk decreased as the duration of therapy increased. Sensitivity analyses using propensity score-adjusted modeling showed that the results were similar to those of multiple regression analysis. Conclusions Patients with schizophrenia who received aripiprazole, chlorpromazine, or haloperidol could have a potentially elevated risk of developing acute coronary syndrome, particularly at the start of therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2522048082,"The stepwise degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) is accomplished by twelve lysosomal enzymes. Deficiency in any of these enzymes will result in the accumulation of the intermediate substrates on the pathway to the complete turnover of GAGs. The accumulation of these undegraded substrates in almost any tissue is a hallmark of all Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS). Present therapeutics based on enzyme replacement therapy and bone marrow transplantation have low effectiveness for the treatment of MPS with neurological complications since enzymes used in these therapies are unable to cross the blood brain barrier. Small molecule-based approaches are more promising in addressing neurological manifestations. In this report we identify a target for developing a substrate reduction therapy (SRT) for six MPS resulting from the abnormal degradation of heparan sulfate (HS). Using the minimal promoter of NDST1, one of the first modifying enzymes of HS precursors, we established a luciferase based reporter gene assay capable of identifying small molecules that could potentially reduce HS maturation and therefore lessen HS accumulation in certain MPS. From the screen of 1,200 compounds comprising the Prestwick Chemical library we identified SAHA, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, as the drug that produced the highest inhibitory effects in the reporter assay. More importantly SAHA treated fibroblasts expressed lower levels of endogenous NDST1 and accumulated less 35S GAGs in patient cells. Thus, by using our simple reporter gene assay we have demonstrated that by inhibiting the transcription of NDST1 with small molecules, identified by high throughput screening, we can also reduce the level of sulfated HS substrate in MPS patient cells, potentially leading to SRT."

Here, we report the crystal structures of two mutant EcFicT/EcFicA complexes (EcFicTG55RA and EcFicTAE28G) both showing close resemblance with the structure of the AMP-transferase VbhT from Bartonella schoenbuchensis in complex with its cognate antitoxin VbhA. However, crucial differences in the active site of EcFicT compared to VbhT and other AMP-transferases rationalize the lack of evidence for adenylylation activity. Comprehensive bioinformatic analysis suggests that EcFicT has evolved from canonical AMP-transferases and has acquired a conserved binding site for a yet to be discovered novel substrate. The G55R mutation has no effect on structure or thermal stability of EcFicT, such that the molecular basis for its associated Fic phenotype remains elusive. We anticipate that this structure will inspire further bioinformatic and experimental analyses in order to characterize the enzymatic activity of EcFicT and help revealing its physiological role."
https://openalex.org/W2522532556,"The CyanoQ protein has been demonstrated to be a component of cyanobacterial Photosystem II (PS II), but there exist a number of outstanding questions concerning its physical association with the complex. CyanoQ is a lipoprotein; upon cleavage of its transit peptide by Signal Peptidase II, which targets delivery of the mature protein to the thylakoid lumenal space, the N-terminal cysteinyl residue is lipid-modified. This modification appears to tether this otherwise soluble component to the thylakoid membrane. To probe the functional significance of the lipid anchor, mutants of the CyanoQ protein have been generated in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 to eliminate the N-terminal cysteinyl residue, preventing lipid modification. Substitution of the N-terminal cysteinyl residue with serine (Q-C22S) resulted in a decrease in the amount of detectable CyanoQ protein to 17% that of the wild-type protein. Moreover, the physical properties of the accumulated Q-C22S protein were consistent with altered processing of the CyanoQ precursor. The Q-C22S protein was shifted to a higher apparent molecular mass and partitioned in the hydrophobic phase in TX-114 phase-partitioning experiments. These results suggest that the hydrophobic N-terminal 22 amino acids were not properly cleaved by a signal peptidase. Substitution of the entire CyanoQ transit peptide with the transit peptide of the soluble lumenal protein PsbO yielded the Q-SS mutant and resulted in no detectable accumulation of the modified CyanoQ protein. Finally, the CyanoQ protein was present at normal amounts in the PS II mutant strains ΔpsbB and ΔpsbO, indicating that an association with PS II was not a prerequisite for stable CyanoQ accumulation. Together these results indicate that CyanoQ accumulation in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 depends on the presence of the N-terminal lipid anchor, but not on the association of CyanoQ with the PS II complex."
https://openalex.org/W2522567580,"Myotonic dystrophy type 1(DM1) is the prototype for diseases caused by RNA toxicity. RNAs from the mutant allele contain an expanded (CUG)n tract within the 3' untranslated region of the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) gene. The toxic RNAs affect the function of RNA binding proteins leading to sequestration of muscleblind-like (MBNL) proteins and increased levels of CELF1 (CUGBP, Elav-like family member 1). The mechanism for increased CELF1 is not very clear. One favored proposition is hyper-phosphorylation of CELF1 by Protein Kinase C alpha (PKCα) leading to increased CELF1 stability. However, most of the evidence supporting a role for PKC-α relies on pharmacological inhibition of PKC. To further investigate the role of PKCs in the pathogenesis of RNA toxicity, we generated transgenic mice with RNA toxicity that lacked both the PKCα and PKCβ isoforms. We find that these mice show similar disease progression as mice wildtype for the PKC isoforms. Additionally, the expression of CELF1 is also not affected by deficiency of PKCα and PKCβ in these RNA toxicity mice. These data suggest that disease phenotypes of these RNA toxicity mice are independent of PKCα and PKCβ."

Here we investigate the anti-tumor effects of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting LGMN embedded in a microRNA-155 (miR-155) architecture, which is driven by a radiation-inducible chimeric RNA polymerase II (Pol II) promoter. Lentiviral vectors were generated with the chimeric promoter which controlled the expression of downstream shRNA-miR-155 cassette. Fluorescence was observed by using confocal microscopy. Real-time quantitative PCR and Western blotting were used to determine the expression level of LGMN, MMP2, and MMP9. Furthermore, the proliferation and invasive ability of BC cells was analyzed via plate colony formation and invasion assays. Here we demonstrated that the chimeric promoter could be effectively induced by radiation treatment. Furthermore, the shRNA-miR-155 cassette targeting LGMN could be effectively activated by the chimeric promoter. Radiation plus knockdown of LGMN impairs colony formation and dampens cell migration and invasion in BC cells. Inhibition of LGMN downregulates MMP2 and MMP9 expression in BC cells. Pol II-driven shRNA-miR-155 could effectively suppress the growth and invasiveness of BC cells, and that the interference effects could be regulated by radiation doses. Moreover, knockdown of LGMN alleviates the aggressive phenotype of BC cells through modulating MMPs expression."
https://openalex.org/W2521972019,"Transmembrane adaptor proteins (TRAPs) are important organisers for the transduction of immunoreceptor-mediated signals. Prr7 is a TRAP that regulates T cell receptor (TCR) signalling and potently induces cell death when overexpressed in human Jurkat T cells. Whether endogenous Prr7 has a similar functional role is currently unknown. To address this issue, we analysed the development and function of the immune system in Prr7 knockout mice. We found that loss of Prr7 partially impairs development of single positive CD4+ T cells in the thymus but has no effect on the development of other T cell subpopulations, B cells, NK cells, or NKT cells. Moreover, Prr7 does not affect the TCR signalling pathway as T cells derived from Prr7 knockout and wild-type animals and stimulated in vitro express the same levels of the activation marker CD69, and retain their ability to proliferate and activate induced cell death programs. Importantly, Prr7 knockout mice retained the capacity to mount a protective immune response when challenged with Listeria monocytogenes infection in vivo. In addition, T cell effector functions (activation, migration, and reactivation) were normal following induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in Prr7 knockout mice. Collectively, our work shows that loss of Prr7 does not result in a major immune system phenotype and suggests that Prr7 has a dispensable function for TCR signalling."

We defined LE as HA weekly incidence rates of ≥20 suspected cases per 100,000 during ≥2 weeks and assigned the predominant serogroup based on polymerase chain reaction testing of cerebrospinal fluid. Among the 175 LE, median peak weekly incidence rate in LE due to NmA, W, X and C were 54, 39, 109 and 46 per 100,000, respectively. These differences impacted ability of the epidemic to be detected at the district level.

From ancient Greece to modern-day Hollywood, the ability to boost and optimize memory represents a recurring and alluring theme.

Nelson M. et al.Neuron. 2016; 91 (this issue): 1356-1373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar begin to turn fiction into fact with a new study (at least if you’re a mouse). To do this they ask a simple, yet lofty, question: is it possible to engineer a better hippocampus—one that encodes and stores information more efficiently? Their approach focused on adult neurogenesis—a unique and robust form of plasticity in the hippocampus. Throughout life, new neurons are generated in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. These newly generated neurons then need to integrate into the existing hippocampal circuitry, and this is not a trivial task. As new adult-generated neurons mature, they must extend dendrites and axons through a maze of existing processes, establishing contact with the appropriate pre- and post-synaptic partners. The hippocampus (much like the field that studies it) is a highly competitive environment. As new neurons integrate, they appear to compete with existing, mature granule cells for inputs from entorhinal cortex and outputs onto CA3 pyramidal cells. In a series of landmark papers, Nicolas Toni and colleagues used retroviral labeling techniques to visualize new neurons as they integrated into established adult hippocampal circuits. What they saw was striking. In the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, spiny protrusions from newborn neurons preferentially contacted existing boutons. This suggested that new neurons compete with established neurons for inputs from the entorhinal cortex (Toni et al., 2007Toni N. Teng E.M. Bushong E.A. Aimone J.B. Zhao C. Consiglio A. van Praag H. Martone M.E. Ellisman M.H. Gage F.H. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) and that receiving strong entorhinal input imparts a survival advantage for the new neurons. A similar pattern was observed on the output side. In CA3, large mossy fiber terminals from newborn granule cells formed synapses on thorny excrescences immediately adjacent to contacts from mature granule cells (Toni et al., 2008Toni N. Laplagne D.A. Zhao C. Lombardi G. Ribak C.E. Gage F.H. Schinder A.F. Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 901-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Again, this suggested a competitive process in which new neurons form new output connections and, in doing so, potentially overwrite existing connections. While these “snapshots” of the new neuron wiring strongly hinted that the integration of new neurons depended upon competitive interactions between new and mature populations of granule cells, the most direct support for this idea would be to perturb the system—advantage or disadvantage one or other population—and watch the competition play out. McAvoy et al., 2016McAvoy K.M. Scobie K.N. Berger S. Russo C. Guo N. Decharatanachart P. Ramirez H.-V. Miake-Lye S. Whalen M. Nelson M. et al.Neuron. 2016; 91 (this issue): 1356-1373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar adopted this strategy in the current study. They selectively reduced dendritic spines in the mature population of granule cells in the dentate gyrus. They reasoned that by blunting the competitive edge of the mature cells, new neurons would be able to integrate more efficiently. To do this, they took advantage of their previous work in which they had identified Krüppel-like factor 9 (Klf9) as a key negative transcriptional regulator of dendritic spines (Scobie et al., 2009Scobie K.N. Hall B.J. Wilke S.A. Klemenhagen K.C. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Ghosh A. Hen R. Sahay A. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 9875-9887Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). They generated mice in which Klf9 could be inducibly and reversibly overexpressed in mature granule cells in the dentate gyrus. As predicted, overexpressing Klf9 reduced dendritic spine density in mature dentate granule cells. Spines were reduced on the most distal dendrites in the outer molecular layer, the region in which entorhinal inputs contact the granule cells. Consistent with these cells receiving reduced excitatory input from the entorhinal cortex, the mature granule cells overexpressing Klf9 were less active. Mature granule cells had reduced expression of the activity-regulated gene, c-fos, supporting the idea that spine loss blunted their activity. This confirmed Klf9’s status as a negative regulator of spines, supporting earlier work (Scobie et al., 2009Scobie K.N. Hall B.J. Wilke S.A. Klemenhagen K.C. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Ghosh A. Hen R. Sahay A. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 9875-9887Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). But did disadvantaging mature granule cells in this fashion give an edge to their competition? Strikingly, reducing spines in mature granule cells led to a spike in neurogenesis. The number of new granule cells was increased immediately following 2 weeks of Klf9 overexpression, but neurogenesis returned to baseline levels within an additional 2 weeks. Furthermore, neurons born 1 week prior to Klf9 overexpression (i.e., those that were integrating at the time when Klf9 levels were elevated) had a higher rate of long-term survival. Some pathological conditions, including epilepsy, are also associated with increased neurogenesis (Jessberger et al., 2007Jessberger S. Zhao C. Toni N. Clemenson Jr., G.D. Li Y. Gage F.H. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 9400-9407Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). However, with these pathological conditions, new neurons are located ectopically and form aberrant connections. McAvoy et al., 2016McAvoy K.M. Scobie K.N. Berger S. Russo C. Guo N. Decharatanachart P. Ramirez H.-V. Miake-Lye S. Whalen M. Nelson M. et al.Neuron. 2016; 91 (this issue): 1356-1373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar used a combined retrovirus and rabies virus labeling approach to examine the connectivity of the new neurons following Klf9 overexpression. They found that the new neurons appear to connect up quite normally, suggesting that Klf9 overexpression not only boosted neurogenesis, but these new neurons also integrated seamlessly in the hippocampus. Many factors regulate the stability of spines. In principle, therefore, there should be alternate ways of perturbing the competition between mature and new granule cells, establishing that the current observations are not peculiar to the Klf9 intervention. To do this, McAvoy et al., 2016McAvoy K.M. Scobie K.N. Berger S. Russo C. Guo N. Decharatanachart P. Ramirez H.-V. Miake-Lye S. Whalen M. Nelson M. et al.Neuron. 2016; 91 (this issue): 1356-1373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar targeted the Rho family GTP-ase, Rac1. In contrast to Klf9, Rac1 is a positive regulator of dendritic spines. Accordingly, conditional deletion of Rac1 from the mature granule cell population led to a decrease in spine density (similar to Klf9 overexpression). Moreover, spine loss in the mature population led to an increase in the number of immature neurons in the dentate gyrus. These findings confirm the interaction between the morphology/activity of mature granule cells and the integration of immature neurons and, therefore, provide direct support for the ideas originally proposed by Toni et al., 2007Toni N. Teng E.M. Bushong E.A. Aimone J.B. Zhao C. Consiglio A. van Praag H. Martone M.E. Ellisman M.H. Gage F.H. Nat.

Neurosci. 2008; 11: 901-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar. Improved methods for imaging new neurons will now make it possible to watch this competition play out in real time (Gonçalves et al., 2016Gonçalves J.T. Bloyd C.W. Shtrahman M. Johnston S.T. Schafer S.T. Parylak S.L. Tran T. Chang T. Gage F.H. Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 788-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). How does this transient boost in neurogenesis affect hippocampal function? With the development of more effective methods for labeling newborn neurons in the 1990s, the study of hippocampal neurogenesis underwent something of a renaissance, and this question about function has been at the forefront. In the typical study, experimenters introduce some intervention to increase neurogenesis (e.g., from drugs to exercise to genetic interventions) and then wait several weeks before training animals in a task that engages the hippocampus. The typical finding is that boosting hippocampal neurogenesis improves hippocampal learning (e.g., Sahay et al., 2011aSahay A. Scobie K.N. Hill A.S. O’Carroll C.M. Kheirbek M.A. Burghardt N.S. Fenton A.A. Dranovsky A. Hen R. Nature. 2011; 472: 466-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). However, these interventions all produce global changes in hippocampal neurogenesis. At the time of testing, the hippocampus would contain new neurons in a broad range of maturational states (from days to several weeks old). The biophysical and functional features of newborn granule cells change dramatically as they mature, with neurons that are 4–8 weeks old being especially plastic and excitable (Toni and Schinder, 2016Toni N. Schinder A.F. Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2016; 8: a018903Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It is at this point that they appear to be most important for hippocampal memory function—they are recruited into hippocampal memories in great numbers and subsequent inhibition of these cells impairs memory (Gu et al., 2012Gu Y. Arruda-Carvalho M. Wang J. Janoschka S.R. Josselyn S.A. Frankland P.W. Ge S. Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1700-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). It would therefore be advantageous to furnish the hippocampus with a cohort of new neurons at just this right age. The clever, reversible strategy developed by McAvoy et al., 2016McAvoy K.M. Scobie K.N. Berger S. Russo C. Guo N. Decharatanachart P. Ramirez H.-V. Miake-Lye S. Whalen M. Nelson M. et al.Neuron. 2016; 91 (this issue): 1356-1373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar allows them to do exactly that and flood the hippocampus with a cohort of new neurons of exactly the right vintage. To examine whether memory improved, they took their re-engineered mice with boosted cohorts of 5- to 8-week-old new neurons and tested them in two tasks, the water maze and contextual fear discrimination. They found improvements in both tests. In the water maze, the mice with boosted neurogenesis could use spatial information more flexibly. In the context discrimination task, the mice with boosted neurogenesis discriminated more persistently between a dangerous context (in which they received a shock) and a safe context (in which nothing unpleasant happened). These effects were more pronounced in middle-aged and old-aged mice, suggesting that the beneficial effects of boosting neurogenesis may be most obvious against a backdrop of declining cognitive function. The ability to discriminate dangerous places from safe places is thought to depend on pattern separation. Pattern separation refers to the process in which similar input patterns of activity are transformed into dissimilar output patterns of activity (Sahay et al., 2011bSahay A. Wilson D.A. Hen R. Neuron. 2011; 70: 582-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In the dentate gyrus, neurogenesis is thought to facilitate this computation, in part, by helping to sparsify the neural code. With a sparser code, it should be easier to represent different places (or experiences) by non-overlapping populations of dentate granule cells. Therefore, the authors used a molecular imaging approach (catFISH) to test the idea that improved pattern separation might underlie improvements in contextual fear discrimination in the re-engineered mice. They visualized neural ensembles in the dentate gyrus activated by two distinct experiences (placement in the “dangerous” context in which they had been shocked versus placement in a similar “safe” context in which nothing untoward happened). Remarkably, the degree of overlap between the populations engaged by these two experiences was reduced in the re-engineered mice, consistent with their ability to more efficiently discriminate these contexts. Chemically preventing the increase in neurogenesis eliminated this difference, and also the improved context discrimination. These findings provide strong support for the notion that the integration of adult generated neurons plays an important role in context discrimination by minimizing the co-activation of neurons in dangerous versus safe contexts. So far, so good. But does improved memory come at a cost? The McAvoy et al., 2016McAvoy K.M. Scobie K.N. Berger S. Russo C. Guo N. Decharatanachart P. Ramirez H.-V. Miake-Lye S. Whalen M. Nelson M. et al.Neuron. 2016; 91 (this issue): 1356-1373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar study doesn’t address this potential downside. However, the cost of adding plasticity to any system (e.g., the brain or computer) is instability, referred to as the plasticity-stability dilemma (Grossberg, 1987Grossberg S. Cog. Sci. 1987; 11: 23-63Crossref Google Scholar). Given this, we predict that similarly boosting neurogenesis after training (rather than before) would highlight the cost of more efficient encoding: the loss of established memories (Frankland et al., 2013Frankland P.W. Köhler S. Josselyn S.A. Trends Neurosci. 2013; 36: 497-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar).
