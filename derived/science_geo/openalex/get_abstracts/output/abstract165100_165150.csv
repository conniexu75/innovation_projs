https://openalex.org/W1582870526,"DNA-binding domains with predetermined sequence specificity are engineered by selection of zinc finger modules using phage display, allowing the construction of customized transcription factors. Despite remarkable progress in this field, the available protein-engineering methods are deficient in many respects, thus hampering the applicability of the technique. Here we present a rapid and convenient method that can be used to design zinc finger proteins against a variety of DNA-binding sites. This is based on a pair of pre-made zinc finger phage-display libraries, which are used in parallel to select two DNA-binding domains each of which recognizes given 5 base pair sequences, and whose products are recombined to produce a single protein that recognizes a composite (9 base pair) site of predefined sequence. Engineering using this system can be completed in less than two weeks and yields proteins that bind sequence-specifically to DNA with Kd values in the nanomolar range. To illustrate the technique, we have selected seven different proteins to bind various regions of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) promoter."

Since FGF1 is a Cu2+-binding protein and Cu2+ is known to induce its dimerization, we evaluated the capacity of recombinant FGF1, p40 Syt1, and S100A13 to interact in a cell-free system and the role of Cu2+ in this interaction. We report that FGF1, p40 Syt1, and S100A13 are able to bind Cu2+ with similar affinity and to interact in the presence of Cu2+ to form a multiprotein aggregate which is resistant to low concentrations of SDS and sensitive to reducing conditions and ultracentrifugation. The formation of this aggregate in the presence of Cu2+ is dependent on the presence of S100A13 and is mediated by cysteine-independent interactions between S100A13 and either FGF1 or p40 Syt1. Interestingly, S100A13 is also able to interact in the presence of Cu2+ with Cys-free FGF1 and this observation may account for the ability of S100A13 to export Cys-free FGF1 in response to stress. Lastly, tetrathiomolybdate, a Cu2+ chelator, significantly represses in a dose-dependent manner the heat shock-induced release of FGF1 and S100A13. These data suggest that S100A13 may be involved in the assembly of the multiprotein aggregate required for the release of FGF1 and that Cu2+ oxidation may be an essential post-translational intracellular modifier of this process.

Recent studies have suggested that FGF1 may be released as a multiprotein aggregate containing FGF1 and the p40 extravesicular domain of p65 synaptotagmin (Syt)1 (7Tarantini F. LaVallee T. Jackson A.

These studies are consistent with the observation that FGF1 is present in neuronal tissue as a component of a non-covalent aggregate containing p40 Syt1 and S100A13 (9Carreira C.M. LaVallee T.M.

It is also known that (i) both p40 Syt1 and S100A13 are constitutively released at 37 °C from NIH 3T3 (8LaVallee T.M. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Carreira C.M. Jackson A. Maciag T. J. Biol.

Moreover, S100A13 appears to play a role in the regulation of FGF1 release since (i) a deletion mutant of S100A13, lacking the carboxyl-terminal basic residue-rich domain, acts as a dominant-negative repressor of FGF1 release, (ii) the expression of S100A13 is able to revert the requirement for transcription and translation in FGF1 release, and (iii) the expression of S100A13 is able to induce the release of Cys-free FGF1, a mutant that is unable to access the extracellular compartment in response to heat shock (10Landriscina M.

Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11307-11315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Cu2+ is able to stimulate the migration (12Hannan G.N. McAuslan B.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1982; 111: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and the proliferation (13Hu G.F. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 69: 326-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) of endothelial cells in vitro and d-penicillamine, a Cu2+chelator, inhibits human endothelial cell proliferation in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo (14Matsubara T. Saura R. Hirohata K. Ziff M. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Recently, it has also been shown that Cu2+ potentiates human angiogenin binding to its endothelial cell receptor (15Soncin F. Guitton J.D. Cartwright T. Badet J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and that SPARC, an extracellular matrix-binding protein known to be involved in the regulation of endothelial cell proliferation, is a source of Cu2+-binding polypeptides that stimulate angiogenesis (16Lane T.F. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Johnson R.S. Sage E.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 929-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Cu2+ also appears to play a role in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix since it is able to increase fibronectin synthesis in vitro (12Hannan G.N. McAuslan B.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1982; 111: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and act as a cofactor for proteins involved in extracellular matrix formation (17Rucker R.B. Wold F. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2252-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).Because FGF1 is released in response to heat shock as a FGF1 homodimer (4Jackson A. Friedman S. Zhan X. Engleka K.A. Forough R. Maciag T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10691-10695Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 18Jackson A. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 33-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and Cu2+ oxidation is able to facilitate FGF1 homodimer formation (11Engleka K.A. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11307-11315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the ability of the known members of the FGF1 release pathway to associate in a cell-free system and evaluated the Cu2+ dependence of this association. We report that, like FGF1, the recombinant forms of p40 Syt1 and S100A13 are able to bind to Cu2+ and interact in the presence of Cu2+ to form a S100A13-dependent multiprotein aggregate. The ability of S100A13 to interact with FGF1 and p40 Syt1 is independent of disulfide bond oxidation since S100A13 is devoid of cysteines and is able to associate with Cys-free FGF1 in the presence of Cu2+. Last, tetrathiomolybdate (TTM), a Cu2+chelator, is able to inhibit the release of FGF1 and S100A13 in response to temperature stress. These data suggest that S100A13 may participate in the FGF1 release pathway by its ability to promote, in a Cu2+-dependent manner, the assembly of a multiprotein aggregate containing FGF1, p40 Syt1, and S100A13.DISCUSSIONFGF1 has been purified from the ovine brain as part of a multiprotein noncovalent aggregate containing p40 Syt1 and S100A13 (5Carreira, C. M., Landriscina, M., Bellum, S., Prudovsky, I., and Maciag, T. (2001) Growth Factors, in press.Google Scholar). This observation correlates with our in vitro results showing that, in NIH 3T3 cells, FGF1 is released in response to temperature stress as an aggregate containing p40 Syt1 and the electrophoretic mobility of the FGF1 and p40 Syt1 aggregate was sensitive to reducing and to denaturating reagents (7Tarantini F. LaVallee T. Jackson A. Gamble S. Carreira C.M. Garfinkel S. Burgess W.H. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22209-22216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). FGF1 and S100A13 are also able to associate in conditioned media from temperature-stressed NIH 3T3 cells, since the expression of Myc-S100A13 is able to increase the solubility of extracellular FGF1 at 100% (w/v) ammonium sulfate saturation (10Landriscina M. Soldi R. Bagalá C. Micucci I. Bellum S. Tarantini F. Prudovsky I. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22544-22552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a deletion mutant of p40 Syt1, lacking the C2A domain (8LaVallee T.M. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Carreira C.M. Jackson A. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22217-22223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and a deletion mutant of S100A13, lacking the carboxyl-terminal basic residue-rich domain (10Landriscina M. Soldi R. Bagalá C. Micucci I. Bellum S. Tarantini F. Prudovsky I. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22544-22552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), are both able to repress the temperature-dependent release of FGF1, suggesting a functional role for p40 Syt1 and S100A13 in the FGF1 release pathway.The data presented here suggest that S100A13 is able to interact with both FGF1 and p40 Syt1 in a cell free-system in a Cu2+-dependent manner and the simultaneous incubation of FGF1, p40 Syt1, and S100A13 in the presence of Cu2+ results in the formation of a multiprotein aggregate containing FGF1, p40 Syt1, and S100A13. The electrophoretic mobility of this multiprotein aggregate is resistant to low concentrations of SDS, but is sensitive to reducing conditions. These interactions appear to be specific for each of the three proteins. The formation of this multiprotein aggregate (i) is dependent on the presence of S100A13, (ii) involves the formation of disulfide bonds between FGF1 and p40 Syt1 but not S100A13, and (iii) is dependent upon the presence of Cu2+. These results are consistent with the ability of Cu2+ to induce the homodimer formation of FGF1 (11Engleka K.A. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11307-11315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and with the observation that FGF1, p40 Syt1, and S100A13 are able to bind Cu2+ with similar affinity.The observation that FGF1, p40 Syt1, and S100A13 interact, in the presence of Cu2+, to form a multiprotein aggregate may provide some insights into the potential role of S100A13 in the release of FGF1 in response to stress. Indeed, previous results from our laboratory have suggested that FGF1 and S100A13 are able to interactin vitro since FGF1 expression is able to inhibit the constitutive release of the Myc-S100A13 chimera at 37 °C (10Landriscina M. Soldi R. Bagalá C. Micucci I. Bellum S. Tarantini F. Prudovsky I. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22544-22552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and Myc-S100A13 expression is able to induce the release of Cys-free FGF1 in response to heat shock (10Landriscina M. Soldi R. Bagalá C. Micucci I. Bellum S. Tarantini F. Prudovsky I. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22544-22552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In contrast, FGF1 expression is not able to repress the constitutive release of p40 Syt1 (8LaVallee T.M. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Carreira C.M. Jackson A. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22217-22223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and p40 Syt1 is not able to facilitate the release of Cys-free FGF1. 2T. M. La Vallee and T. Maciag, unpublished observation. Since S100A13 is a Cys-free protein, we suggest that the role of Cu2+oxidation in the interaction between S100A13 and FGF1, as well as between S100A13 and p40 Syt1, may not involve the oxidation of cysteine residues between S100A13 and either FGF1 or p40 Syt1. This suggestion is supported by the observation that S100A13 is able to interact with Cys-free FGF1 in a Cu2+-dependent manner. Moreover, the requirement for Cu2+ oxidation for the interaction between S100A13 and FGF1, as well as for the formation of p40 Syt1, FGF1, and S100A13 multiprotein aggregate is also supported by the observation that the incubation of S100A13 with dimeric forms of FGF1 in the absence of Cu2+ does not result in the formation of a multiprotein aggregate (data not shown). Furthermore, the presence of multiple Cys residues in FGF1 may also account for the stability of the multiprotein aggregate at low concentrations of SDS which would explain why ultracentrifugation was required to pellet the Cys-free and Cys30 forms of FGF1 in the presence of S100A13 and Cu2+ and the failure to observe the multiprotein aggregate under the conditions of limited SDS-PAGE (Figs. 2 and 3).Several studies have demonstrated that S100 proteins are able to form stable homodimers in the presence or absence of Ca2+, thus enabling the carboxyl-terminal domain of the polypeptide to interact with other proteins (21Heizmann C.W. Cox J.A. Biometals. 1998; 11: 383-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 31Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 191-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). It is also well established that, due to a conformational change induced by Ca2+-mediated S100 protein dimer formation, S100A11 and annexin (Anx) 1 (31Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 191-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 32Seemann J. Weber K. Gerke V. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and S100A10 and Anx2 (33Mailliard W.S. Haigler H.T. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 719-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 34Kang H.M. Kassam G. Jarvis S.E. Fitzpatrick S.L. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2041-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) are able to form stable heterotetramers (S100A112:Anx12 and S100A102:Anx22). We suggest that in the case of FGF1, p40 Syt1, and S100A13, the presence of Cu2+, not Ca2+, may facilitate the interaction between either S100A13 and FGF1 or between S100A13 and p40 Syt1 to form a putative S100A132:FGF12 or S100A132:p40 Syt12 heterotetramer. The Cu2+-dependent formation of disulfide bonds among cysteine residues from the monomer forms of FGF1 and p40 Syt1 may also induce the formation of the multiprotein aggregate by the disulfide linked cross-bridging of several of the putative S100A132:FGF12 and S100A132:p40 Syt12 heterotetramers. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that Cys-free FGF1 is not able to form the Cu2+-dependent multiprotein aggregate in the presence of S100A13 and p40 Syt1 but is able to interact with S100A13 in a Cu2+-dependent manner.This premise also correlates with our previous observation that a deletion mutant of S100A13, lacking the carboxyl-terminal basic residue-rich domain, acts as dominant negative repressor of the temperature-dependent release of FGF1 (10Landriscina M. Soldi R. Bagalá C. Micucci I. Bellum S. Tarantini F. Prudovsky I. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22544-22552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Since the basic residue-rich domain is a feature specific for S100A13 as a S100 gene family member, we suggest that this domain may be important for the interaction between either S100A13 and FGF1 or between S100A13 and p40 Syt1.Our data also suggest that FGF1 and p40 Syt1 may be able to interact in response to Cu2+ oxidation and that this interaction may be mediated by the formation of a FGF1:p40 Syt1 heterodimer triplet and this is consistent with the observation that the Cys-free FGF1 is not able to form a Cys-free FGF1:p40 Syt1 heterodimer. Indeed, p40 Syt1 contains a single Cys residue which is located within the carboxyl terminus of Syt1 (24Perin M.S. Fried V.A. Mignery G.A. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1990; 345: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) and this structural feature suggests that the C2A and the C2B domains of p40 Syt1 may be involved in binding Cu2+ in a manner which may facilitate the formation of the FGF1:p40 Syt1 heterodimer. The observation that Cu2+facilitates the oxidation of a p40 Syt1:FGF1 heterodimer, as well as FGF1 homodimer formation but does not facilitate the formation of a p40 Syt1 homodimer, is consistent with this premise since the oxidation of the single Cys residue in p40 Syt1 requires the presence of FGF1.We do not know whether the capacity of FGF1, p40 Syt1, and S100A13 to interact in the presence of Cu2+ in a cell-free system reproduces the physiological interactions that occur in vitro under stress conditions which may enable a similar multiprotein aggregate containing FGF1, p40 Syt1, and S100A13 to be released (7Tarantini F.

However, the capacity of S100A13 to interact with Cys-free FGF1 in a cell-free system may account for the ability of Myc-S100A13 to export, in response to stress, Cys-free FGF1 (10Landriscina M.

Indeed, our data suggest that S100A13 may be able to form a putative S100A132:Cys-free FGF12heterotetramer and to force Cys-free FGF1 to enter the release pathway in response to temperature stress in the absence of FGF1 disulfide bond formation. In contrast, p40 Syt1 may be able to interact with FGF1 only through formation of a disulfide bond and, may explain why the expression of either p65 Syt1 (8LaVallee T.M. Tarantini F. Gamble S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22217-22223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) or p40 Syt12 is unable to induce the release of the Cys-free FGF1 from NIH 3T3 cells in response to heat shock. Similarly, FGF1 is able to repress the constitutive release of Myc-S100A13 (10Landriscina M. Soldi R. Bagalá C. Micucci I. Bellum S. Tarantini F. Prudovsky I. Maciag T. J. Biol.

Indeed, the expression of S100A13 is not only able to induce the release of Cys-free FGF1 (10Landriscina M. Soldi R. Bagalá C. Micucci I. Bellum S. Tarantini F. Prudovsky I. Maciag T. J. Biol.

Thus, we suggest that requirement for cellular stress may not involve the transcriptional and translational activation of either a known or novel stress-induced gene; rather, the requirement for cellular stress may involve the activation of post-translational mechanisms of intracellular redox pathways that may be involved in the cytosolic regulation and maintenance of a stress-induced oxidative state (35Lum H. Roebuck K.A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C719-741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We have previously described that the Cys30 is necessary for the formation of FGF1 homodimer in vitro and for the release of FGF1 in response to stress conditions (26Tarantini F. Gamble S. Jackson A. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29039-29042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Moreover, crystallographic studies of FGF1 have shown that the Cys30is normally not exposed to the solvent (36Blaber M. DiSalvo J. Thomas K.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2086-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), suggesting that FGF1 may undergo conformational changes before being released. We suggest that under stress conditions the Cu2+-dependent interaction between FGF1 and S100A13 may be requisite for the unfolding of FGF1 and the reorientation of Cys30 in order to form the FGF1 homodimer which is required for its release in response to stress (18Jackson A.

The capacity of S100A13 to interact with p40 Syt1 may also account for the presence of p40 Syt1 in the multiprotein aggregate and further supports the premise that S100A13 and p40 Syt1 may play a functional role in the formation of this multiprotein aggregate based upon their ability to associate with phosphatidylserine (37Marqueze B.

K. (2000)J. Biol. Chem. 275, 15314–15320). In this study, we determined subcellular localization of COX-2 and caveolin-1 by confocal microscopy. COX-2 in human foreskin fibroblasts stimulated by PMA (100 nm) or interleukin-1β (1 ng/ml) for 6 h was localized to plasma membrane in addition to endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope. Caveolin-1 was localized to plasma membrane, and image overlay showed colocalization of COX-2 with caveolin-1. This was confirmed by the presence of COX-2 and caveolin-1 in the detergent-insoluble membrane fraction of cells stimulated by PMA. Immunoprecipitation showed complex formation of COX-2 with caveolin-1 in a time-dependent manner. A larger quantity of COX-2 was complexed with caveolin-1 in PMA-treated than in interleukin-1β-treated cells. Purified COX-2 complexed with glutathione S-transferase-fused caveolin-1, which was not inhibited by the scaffolding domain peptide. Caveolin-1-bound COX-2 was catalytically active, and its activity was not inhibited by the scaffolding domain peptide. These results suggest that COX-2 induced by PMA and interleukin-1β is colocalized with caveolin-1 in the segregated caveolae compartment. Because caveolae are rich in signaling molecules, this COX-2 compartment may play an important role in diverse pathophysiological processes. Results from our previous study suggest that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) may be localized to caveolae-like structures (Liou, J.-Y., Shyue, S.-K., Tsai, M.-J., Chung, C.-L., Chu, K.-Y., and Wu, K.

Marnett L.J. DeWitt D.L. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 49: 153-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). COX occupies a central position in prostanoid biosynthesis. Two isoforms of COX have been identified and characterized. COX-1 is constitutively expressed in many cell types and participates in physiological activities, whereas COX-2 expression is induced by diverse mitogenic and proinflammatory factors and plays an important role in inflammation and tumorigenesis (2Wu K.K. Adv. Pharmacol. 1995; 33: 179-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The metabolic activities of COX-1 and COX-2 are regulated by multiple factors. Recent studies suggest that their subcellular locations are an important determinant for their metabolic activities and cellular functions. It has been reported that COX-1 and COX-2 were similarly localized to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear envelope (NE) (3Spencer A.G. Woods J.W. Arakawa T. Singer I.I. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9886-9893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Results from our recent studies suggest that COX-2 may be localized to caveolae-like structures in bovine aortic endothelial cells (4Liou J.-Y. Shyue S.-K. Tsai M.-J. Chung C.-L. Chu K.-Y. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15314-15320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the present study, we determined by confocal microscopy whether COX-2 induced by PMA or interleukin-1β (IL-1β) was colocalized with caveolin-1 (Cav-1) to caveolae. We were also interested in determining whether COX-2 directly formed a complex with Cav-1. Results from this study show that a fraction of COX-2 in human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) were colocalized with Cav-1 to plasma membrane caveolae, and subcellular fractionation analysis confirmed the presence of COX-2 with Cav-1 in the detergent-insoluble membrane fraction. Immunoprecipitation experiments show a time-dependent complex formation between COX-2 and Cav-1 in PMA- and IL-1β-treated HFFs, and the extent of COX-2 localized to caveolae in PMA-treated cells was higher than that in IL-1β-treated cells. Purified COX-2 bound to Cav-1 and retained its catalytic activity. HFFs were obtained from ATCC and cultured on 10-cm plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. For all experiments, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in fetal bovine serum-free medium for 24 h. All tissue culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed for 15 min at room temperature with 100% methanol. The samples were pretreated with 10% fetal bovine serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. Monoclonal mouse COX-2 (1:100) and polyclonal rabbit Cav-1 IgG antibodies (1:30) (Santa Cruz Biochemicals) in the same blocking solution were added to the sample and incubated for 1 h. Nonimmune rabbit IgG and mouse IgG were included as controls. In addition, the COX-2 antibody preabsorbed with 20 μm COX-2 (Cayman Chemical) was also used as a control. Following five 5-min washes with blocking solutions, fluorescein isothiocyanate- and rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies were added in blocking solutions and incubated for 30 min. After five additional 5-min washes, samples were examined with a Bio-Rad MRC1000 confocal microscope, and images were processed with Adobe Photoshop software. More than 100 cells were inspected per experiment, and cells with typical morphology were presented. For purification of the GST-Cav-1 fusion protein, Cav-1 cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into BamHI and XhoI sites of the GST expression vector pGEX4T-1. The GST-Cav-1 fusion protein and GST protein were expressed in transformed Escherichia coli induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and purified by affinity chromatography using GST purification modules (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The SD peptide corresponding to Cav-1 residues 82–101 was synthesized by Research Genetics. HFFs were treated with PMA (100 nm) or vehicle for 6 h, cells were lysed, and DRM was isolated by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation as described previously (5Guzzi F. Zanchetta D. Chin B. Parenti M. Biochem. J. 2000; 355: 323-331Crossref Google Scholar, 6Schreiber S. Fleischer J. Breer H. Boekhoff I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24115-24123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In brief, HFFs were lysed with a lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Triton X-100) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) followed by sonication. Sucrose was added to the lysate (final concentration, 40%), and the lysate was placed at the bottom of the ultracentrifuge tube and overlaid with lysis buffer containing 30 and 5% sucrose, respectively. After centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 24 h, 12 1-ml fractions from the top to the bottom were collected. Each fraction was analyzed by Western blot for its COX-2 and Cav-1 contents using specific COX-2 and Cav-1 antibodies, respectively. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (7Xu X.-M. Tang J.-L. Hajibeigi A. Loose-Mitchell D.S. Wu K.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C259-C264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell pellets were lysed with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.01% EDTA, and protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.5 mm pepstatin A, and 0.2 mm leupeptin). Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, and after the supernatants were boiled for 5 min, COX-2 in the lysates was separated in 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide minigels (Hoefer Scientific Instruments). The blots were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and COX-2 was detected with a specific COX-2 antibody using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HFFs were lysed with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmNaVO4, and 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors as described above followed by sonication. Solubilized lysates were incubated with a specific Cav-1 antibody, COX-2 antibody, or a preimmune rabbit IgG at a final concentration of 4 μg/ml each for 4 h at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biochemicals) was then added for 2 h at 4 °C. Thereafter samples were centrifuged and washed four times with RIPA buffer and prepared for Western blotting by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer (8Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). For Cav-1/COX-2 interaction studies, purified COX-2 (Cayman Chemical) and purified GST-Cav-1 were incubated at 37 °C for 4 min in phosphate buffer containing 0.02% Tween 20. Samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-Cav-1 antibodies, and COX-2 in the complex was detected by Western blot analysis. COX-2 activity was measured as described previously (9Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14136-14144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, quantitation of oxygen uptake during cyclooxygenase catalysis was assessed using a Model 53 oxygen electrode and monitor from YSI, Inc. (Yellow Springs, OH). Reactions were run in 3 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, containing 1 mm phenol, 0.02% Tween 20, and 1 μm heme at 30 °C. Purified COX-2 (Cayman Chemicals) was incubated with either full-length Cav-1 or the SD peptide for either 1 or 6 min, and the reaction was started by injecting 10 μm arachidonic acid. Results from our previous study suggest that COX-2 induced by PMA may be located to caveolae (4Liou J.-Y. Shyue S.-K. Tsai M.-J. Chung C.-L. Chu K.-Y. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15314-15320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this study, we determined by confocal microscopy whether COX-2 was colocalized with Cav-1. HFFs were stimulated with PMA (100 nm) for 6 h and treated with anti-COX-2 and anti-Cav-1 antibodies followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to rhodamine and fluorescein isothiocyanate, respectively. PMA-treated HFFs exhibited shape changes (Fig.1). However, they remained viable, and the cell change was reversed to basal cell morphology after PMA had been washed off. The green fluorescent Cav-1 stain was localized to plasma membrane (Fig. 1 A), whereas the red fluorescent COX-2 stain was localized to plasma membrane as well as to ER and NE. Nuclear stain was detectable (Fig. 1 B). Image overlay showed colocalization of COX-2 and Cav-1 to the plasma membrane (Fig.1 C). The staining was specific for Cav-1 and COX-2 because substitution of preimmune IgG for COX-2 antibodies yielded only green plasma membrane stain without COX-2 red stain or colocalization of COX-2 with Cav-1 to plasma membrane (Fig. 1, D–F). Conversely, substitution of Cav-1 antibodies with preimmune IgG resulted in only COX-2 staining (Fig. 1, G–I). Preabsorption of COX-2 antibodies with purified COX-2 also abolished COX-2 staining without an effect on Cav-1 staining (Fig. 1,J–L). HFFs treated with IL-1β (1 ng/ml) did not undergo overt shape change. The Cav-1 and COX-2 staining pattern was similar to that of PMA treatment. Cav-1 was localized primarily at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2 A), whereas COX-2 was localized to ER, NE, and plasma membrane (Fig.2 B). Image overlay confirmed colocalization of COX-2 with Cav-1 (Fig. 2 C). Both Cav-1 and COX-2 staining was specific as shown in Fig. 2, D–L. We assessed the plasma staining of 100 cells for each stimulus and found that the extent of COX-2 localization to plasma membrane in IL-1β-treated HFFs was less prominent than that in PMA-treated cells. To confirm localization of COX-2 to caveolae, we prepared caveolae-rich DRM from HFFs treated with PMA for 6 h and analyzed COX-2 proteins in these fractions by Western blots. Consistent with the reported results (5Guzzi F. Zanchetta D. Chin B. Parenti M. Biochem. J. 2000; 355: 323-331Crossref Google Scholar, 6Schreiber S. Fleischer J. Breer H. Boekhoff I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24115-24123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), Cav-1 proteins were associated with the DRM (Fig.3, fractions 4 and5). In unstimulated cells, Cav-1 was detectable in fractions 4 and 5, whereas COX-2 was undetectable (Fig. 3 a). COX-2 and Cav-1 were detectable in fractions 4 and 5 in HFFs stimulated with PMA for 6 h (Fig. 3 b). As expected, COX-2 was also detected in detergent-soluble fractions (Fig. 3, fractions 10–12). These results confirm the localization of COX-2 to caveolae.Figure 2Colocalization of COX-2 with Cav-1 in HFFs treated with IL-1β (1 ng/ml) for 6 h.

An equivalent level of COX-2 protein was induced by these two agents (Fig.4 a), yet a significantly higher level of COX-2 was detected in the immunoprecipitate of PMA-treated cells than that in IL-1β-treated cells (Fig.4 b). Similar results were obtained when cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against COX-2, and Cav-1 levels in the immunoprecipitates were detected by Western blot analysis (Fig.4 c). These results are consistent with the colocalization findings, indicating that PMA- or IL-1β-induced COX-2 forms a complex with Cav-1 in caveolae. A time course study of this interaction showed a small complex formation between COX-2 and Cav-1 at 1 h after PMA or IL-1β stimulation. The COX-2·Cav-1 complex increased thereafter and reached a maximum at 6 h (Fig.5, a–d). The COX-2 in the complex in PMA-stimulated cells is about 2-fold over that in IL-1β-stimulated cells.Figure 5Kinetics of COX-1· Cav-1 complex formation. HFFs were treated with PMA (100 nm) or IL-1β (1 ng/ml) for 0, 1, 3, and 6 h, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a Cav-1 antibody (a andb) or a COX-2 antibody (c and d), and the precipitate was analyzed by Western blots using specific COX-2 antibodies (a and b) or Cav-1 antibodies (c and d). The density of each band was analyzed and shown under the Western blots. The results are representative of two experiments. WB, Western blotting;IP, immunoprecipitation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is unclear whether the interaction of COX-2 with Cav-1 is an intrinsic property of COX-2. To discern this, we mixed purified COX-2 with GST-Cav-1 at a 1:3 molar ratio, immunoprecipitated the mixture with an antibody to GST, and determined the COX-2 level in the complex by Western blot analysis. For comparison, we loaded one lane with an identical amount of purified COX-2 alone. The COX-2 protein level in the complex was equivalent to that of the COX-2 standard, suggesting that all the COX-2 proteins are coprecipitated with GST-Cav-1 (Fig.6 a). COX-2 was undetectable in preimmune IgG control and barely detectable in a COX-2/GST mixture precipitated with GST antibody. The scaffolding domain (residues 82–101) of Cav-1 is the binding site for several signaling molecules. We tested whether synthetic SD peptides competitively inhibit binding of COX-2 to Cav-1. Purified COX-2 was preincubated with the peptide and then incubated with GST-Cav-1. The complex was immunoprecipitated with anti-GST, and COX-2 in the complex was detected by Western blot analysis. The SD peptide at a 10-fold molar excess over GST-Cav-1 did not block the formation of the COX-2·Cav-1 complex (Fig.6 b). COX-2 catalytic activity in the COX-2/Cav-1 immunoprecipitates that had been extensively washed to remove free COX-2 was measured by O2 consumption. The specific COX-2 activity in two COX-2/Cav-1 mixtures with molar ratios of 1:1 and 1:10, respectively, was similar, which was not significantly different from that of an equivalent amount of purified COX-2 alone (Fig.7). Preincubation of COX-2 with a 10-fold molar excess of the SD peptide did not have a significant effect on COX-2 activity (Fig. 7). The COX-2/Cav-1 mixture precipitated with a preimmune IgG did not show COX activity. Additional controls such as omission of COX-2 from the complex or substitution of GST-Cav-1 with GST also did not have COX activity. O2 consumption was undetected when arachidonate was omitted. These results indicate that the COX-2 and Cav-1 complex retain specific COX-2 activity. Results from this study demonstrate for the first time that COX-2 is localized to caveolae and binds to Cav-1. Several lines of evidence provided by cell biological and biochemical experiments support this conclusion. 1) Confocal microscopy shows colocalization of COX-2 with Cav-1 to plasma membrane. 2) Subcellular fractionation analysis confirms the presence of COX-2 in the detergent-resistant membrane fraction. 3) Immunoprecipitation shows complex formation between COX-2 and Cav-1. 4) An in vitropurified protein mixture ascertains binding of COX-2 to Cav-1. Thus, COX-2 joins a large group of signaling molecules that reside in caveolae. The caveolae COX-2 represents a fraction of COX-2 in PMA- or IL-1β-stimulated HFFs. As previously reported (3Spencer A.G. Woods J.W. Arakawa T. Singer I.I. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9886-9893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 4Liou J.-Y.

COX-2, like COX-1, has a stretch of hydrophobic residues that serve as the binding site to the luminal ER membrane (10Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar, 11Kurumbail R.G. Stevens A.M. Gierse J.K. McDonald J.J. Stegeman R.A. Pak J.Y. Gildehaus D. Miyashiro J.M. Penning T.D. Seibert K. Isakson P.C. Stallings W.C. Nature. 1996; 384: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar). As will be discussed in more detail below, the ER and NE residence is considered the “general” factory for prostanoid biosynthesis because cytosolic phospholipase A2 and prostacyclin synthase as well as PGE synthase are also localized to ER and NE in stimulated cells. It is, thus, unexpected that COX-2 is localized to caveolae by binding to Cav-1. It is unclear how COX-2 exits its ER residence and migrates to caveolae. One possibility is that COX-2 retention in ER is regulated by a post-translational mechanism, and PMA- or IL-1β-induced signaling such as protein kinase C activation may alter the control mechanism and allow COX-2 exit. A recent report indicates that PMA enhances the exit of angiotensin-converting enzyme from ER (12Santhamma K.R. Sen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23253-23258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Once COX-2 exits into the cytosol, it may bind to Cav-1 in the cytosolic caveolae-like vesicles, which have been shown to transport proteins to the plasma membrane (13Oh P. McIntosh D.P. Schnitzer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar,14Lutterforst R. Stang E. Zorzi N. Carozzi A. Way M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1443-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Caveolae, originally described in endothelial cells as flask-shaped vesicular invaginations of plasma membrane, are rich in cholesterol, glycosphingolipids, and sphingomyelin (for a review, see Ref. 15Engelman J.A. Zhang X. Galbiati F. Volonté D. Sotgia F. Pestell R.G. Minetti C. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 1578-1587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Caveolin, a 21–24-kDa protein, is a major integral membrane component of caveolae (for a review, see Ref. 16Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 is ubiquitous and binds to signaling molecules such as Gi protein, Src family kinase, Ha-Ras, and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (16Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). These signaling molecules contain a common sequence motif that recognizes the Cav-1 scaffolding domain (17Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Binding of Cav-1 to these proteins inhibits their activities (16Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). However, exceptions to this rule have been reported. For example, protein kinase C ε activity was not inhibited by binding to the Cav-1 SD (18Oka N. Yamamoto M. Schwencke C. Kawabe J.-I. Ebina T. Ohno S. Couret J. Lisanti M.P. Ishikawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33416-33421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that COX-2 may behave like protein kinase C ε in that its activity and binding to Cav-1 are not blocked by the SD peptide. Furthermore, the COX-2 molecule does not contain the typical Cav-1 binding motif, ψXψXXXXψ or ψXXXXψXXψ (ψ is an aromatic residue andX is any amino acid residue). These results suggest that COX-2 interacts with Cav-1 at a site distinct from the scaffolding domain. COX-2 induction is considered to be a key step in synthesizing prostanoids in response to exogenous stimuli such as mitogenic factors and cytokines. It occupies a central position in prostanoid biosynthesis: it converts arachidonic acid derived from the upstream enzyme phospholipase A2 to PGH2, a common precursor for various prostanoids. The extent of final products depends on the downstream enzymes such as PGE synthase, prostacyclin synthase, PGD synthase, and thromboxane synthase. According to the conventional viewpoint, cytosolic phospholipase A2, COX-2, and downstream enzymes are colocalized to the same subcellular organelles, which facilitate transfer of intermediary metabolites. Recent studies provide evidence to support this notion. It has been shown that cytosolic phospholipase A2 is translocated to ER and NE after cell activation (19Schievella A.R. Regier M.K. Smith W.L. Lin L.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30749-30754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). COX-2 in HFFs and endothelial cells induced by IL-1β or PMA is localized in ER and NE, whereas in endothelial cells, prostacyclin synthase has been shown to be localized to ER and NE (4Liou J.-Y. Shyue S.-K. Tsai M.-J. Chung C.-L. Chu K.-Y. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15314-15320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus, all three prostanoid synthetic enzymes are localized to the same subcellular compartment, which facilitates the synthesis of biologically active prostanoids such as prostacyclin and PGE2. Whether a phospholipase A2 and a terminal-specific synthase are also colocalized to the caveolae/submembrane environment is not as well delineated. However, recent studies suggest that type IIA and type V secretory phospholipase A2, which are expressed on plasma membrane under proinflammatory stimulation, are functionally coupled to COX-2 (20Murakami M. Kambe T. Shimbara S. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3103-3115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar,21Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7951-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Functional coupling of secretory phospholipase A2 with COX-2 has been shown to play a major role in the delayed phase of PGE2 synthesis (22Kuwata H. Sawada H. Murakami M. Kudo I. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 469: 183-188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Type IIA secretory phospholipase A2 prefers negatively charged phospholipids as its substrate. The negatively charged phospholipids are localized at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane in resting cells and become exposed to the external leaflet following cell activation or apoptosis (22Kuwata H. Sawada H. Murakami M. Kudo I. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 469: 183-188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that arachidonate generated will have a ready access to the adjacent COX-2 in caveolae during cell activation or apoptosis. It may also be speculated that PGE synthase could also be localized to this segregated plasma membrane environment. It is conceivable that the caveolar COX-2 may be involved in the transcellular metabolism of arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid generated in a cell may diffuse into the caveolar region of another cell in close contact and be metabolized by COX-2. These possibilities can be tested by using endogenously expressed or exogenously added type IIA secretory phospholipase A2 and are being investigated in our laboratory. The COX-2 compartment in caveolae, which is segregated from the general prostaglandin synthesis factory in ER and NE, may participate in specific signaling pathways that are unique to caveolae (16Okamoto T.

COX-2 may contribute to these processes not only through a compartmental production of prostaglandins such as PGE2 but also through its cross-talk with other biologically active molecules such as endothelial and neuronal nitric-oxide synthases, which are also localized to caveolae (30Garcia-Cardena G.

Schwannomin bears a striking similarity to ERM proteins (ezrin, radixin, and moesin) that are members of the protein 4.1 superfamily. ERM proteins function as molecular adaptors linking integral membrane proteins to the cytoskeleton (7Tsukita S. Oishi K. Sato N. Sagara J. Kawai A. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Members from this family modulate cell shape and membrane specializations by regulating the distribution of adhesion molecules on the cell surface (8Vaheri A. Carpen O. Heiska L. Helander T.S.

The amino-terminal end of ERM proteins, termed as the FERM domain, has been shown to interact with the plasma membrane proteins such as CD43, CD44, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and intercellular adhesion molecule-2. ERM proteins also contain actin-binding sites mapped to the carboxyl-terminal domains (8Vaheri A. Carpen O. Heiska L. Helander T.S. Jaaskelainen J. Majander-Nordenswan P. Sainio M. Timonen T.

This actin-binding site is highly conserved, but the corresponding site in schwannomin is partially divergent, indicating a slightly different function. Schwannomin is localized to actin-rich plasma membrane processes (3Rouleau G.A. Merel P. Lutchman M. Sanson M. Zucman J. Marineau C. Hoang-Xuan K. Demczuk S. Desmaze C. Plougastel B. Pulst S.M.

Schwannomin has also been shown to interact with numerous membrane-associated proteins such as CD44 (15Sainio M. Zhao F. Heiska L. Turunen O. den Bakker M. Zwarthoff E. Lutchman M. Rouleau G.A.

Neurobiol. 1998; 37: 487-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that schwannomin exerts its tumor suppressor effects presumably by modulating some aspects of the receptor-cytoskeletal linkage critical for cell growth and adhesion pathways. Several alternatively spliced transcripts of schwannomin have been identified. The two most prevalent isoforms differ by the presence (isoform-1 or sch-1) or the absence (isoform-2 or sch-2) of exon 16 (19Gutmann D.H. Wright D.E. Geist R.T. Snider W.D. Hum. Mol.

Human sch-1 codes for 595 amino acids whereas shorter sch-2 consists of 590 amino acids. Both the primary structure and the tissue distribution of each isoform are conserved among many species. In addition, these two transcripts show distinct tissue specificity and temporal expression during rat development (19Gutmann D.H. Wright D.E. Geist R.T. Snider W.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These features underscore the importance of distinct schwannomin C termini in cellular function. Moreover in mouse NIH-3T3 or in rat schwannoma cell lines, the heterologous expression of sch-1 but not of sch-2 decreases the growth rate (21Lutchman M. Rouleau G.A.

Based of these observations, we set out to search for proteins that specifically interact with the carboxyl-terminal end of sch-1. Here we report the identification of syntenin, an adapter protein with two tandem PDZ domains, as a novel binding partner that specifically interacts with the C terminus of sch-1. Syntenin is known to bind to several proteins including the cytoplasmic domains of cell surface syndecans (24Grootjans J.J. Zimmermann P. Reekmans G. Smets A. Degeest G. Durr J. David G. Proc. Natl.

In addition, syntenin plays a role in the targeting and maturation processes of proTGF-α from early compartments of the secretory pathway to the cell surface (27Fernandez-Larrea J. Merlos-Suarez A. Urena J.M. Baselga J. Arribas J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 423-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). More recently, syntenin has been localized to the apical recycling compartment of MDCK epithelial cells suggesting a role in the intracellular trafficking and targeting pathways (28Fialka I. Steinlein P. Ahorn H. Bock G. Burbelo P.D. Haberfellner M. Lottspeich F. Paiha K. Pasquali C. Huber L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22239-26233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Direct and specific association between syntenin and schwannomin isoform-1 begins to suggest a functional role for the differentially spliced isoforms of schwannomin and may have implications in the assembly of cytoskeletal complexes, trafficking, and subcellular targeting events necessary for the regulation of cell growth and adhesion processes. Two constructs of human sch-1 were engineered; one consists of the carboxyl-terminal 30 amino acids (C30–1), and the other consists of the carboxyl-terminal 125 amino acids (C125–1). These respective cDNA clones were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned into the EcoRI-XhoI sites of the pEG202LexA (Origene Technologies, Inc.) fusion plasmid vector. pEG202LexA-C30–1 insert was generated with primers 5′-AAGTTCTCGAGCTCCCACGGAAACCCCCAGCCA-3′ and 5′-ACAATGAATTCTCCGACAGGGGTGGCAGCAGCAAGCAC-3′. pEG202LexA-C125–1 insert was generated with primers 5′-AAGTTCTCGAGCTCCCACGGAAACCCCCAGCCA-3′ and 5′-AGCGAGAATTCAAGCAA AGCTCCTGGAGATTGCCACC-3′. Using the same set of primers as used for pEG202LexA-C30–1 construct, the cDNA for human schwannomin isoform-2 (clone 767295; GenBankTM accession number AA418421) was amplified. This construct, designated as pEG202LexA-C25–2, encodes the carboxyl-terminal 25 amino acids of sch-2 (C25–2). The human fetal kidney cDNA library cloned into vector pJG4–5 was screened (2 × 107 primary transformants) in yeast strain EGY48. The insert from one of the selected clones, syntenin (120), was completely sequenced. A BLAST search identified I.M.A.G.E. clones 33203 and 566968 as coding for the full-length cDNA (2,193 base pairs) of syntenin, which were purchased from Research Genetics, Inc. Different LexA-syntenin fusion proteins containing defined regions of syntenin were made by PCR amplification and cloned into EcoRI-XhoI restriction sites of pJG4–5 vector. For confocal microscopy studies, peGFP-C1 or peGFP-C2 vectors (CLONTECH) were used to fuse different regions of schwannomin or syntenin coding sequences to the carboxyl-terminal end of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). The carboxyl-terminal end of sch-1 (peG202LexA-C30–1 or peG202LexA-C125–1) and the coding region of syntenin consisting of two PDZ domains (120) were subcloned in frame as anEcoRI-XhoI fragment into peGFP-C2 vector. Full-length syntenin fused to the eGFP was constructed by subcloning aBamHI-XhoI fragment from pGEX-5X-1-syntenin (see below) into BglII-SalI sites of pEGFP-C2. Full-length human sch-1 fused to eGFP was constructed by PCR amplification and introduction of restriction sitesBamHI-EcoRI and cloning intoBglII-EcoRI of pEGFP-C1 expression vector. The antisense syntenin cDNA was cloned into pTRE expression vector for use in the tetracycline-regulated expression system (CLONTECH). Full-length syntenin cDNA (I.M.A.G.E. clone 566968 constructed in pBS-SK−) and pTRE vector were digested with the restriction enzymes XhoI andSacII, respectively. After blunt ending with T4 DNA polymerase, both plasmids were digested with EcoRI. In the case of syntenin, because of an internal restriction site, partialEcoRI digestion was carried out to isolate full-length syntenin cDNA for cloning into pTRE (pTRE-syntenin (AS)). Multiple tissue northern blot was purchased from CLONTECH Inc. A single-stranded full-length human syntenin cDNA probe was prepared, and hybridization was performed according the manufacturer's recommendations. Full-length syntenin was amplified by PCR (5′-TCGGATCCCCATGTCTCTCTATCCATCTC TCGAAG-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTAAACCTCAGGAATGGTGTGG-3′) and cloned intoBamHI-XhoI restriction sites of plasmid pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The syntenin coding region containing both PDZ domains, syntenin (120), was subcloned as anEcoRI-XhoI fragment into pGEX-5X-1 expression vector. The Escherichia coli BL21 strain and bulk GST purification module (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used for expression and purification of GST fusion proteins. Purified fusion proteins GST-syntenin (FL) and GST-syntenin (120) were confirmed by Western blot using immunoaffinity-purified anti-syntenin-N and anti-syntenin-C antibodies. For pull-down experiments, the interaction between syntenin and schwannomin was examined by incubation of purified GST-syntenin fusion protein (1 µg) and biotinylated sch-1 peptide (0.1 µg) in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 75 mm NaCl on ice for 1 h. Immunopure immobilized streptavidin beads (50 µl of 50% agarose slurry from Pierce) was added, and incubation was continued for another hour on ice. Beads were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 75 mm NaCl, boiled for 5 min in 50 µl of SDS sample buffer, and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot analysis using an anti-syntenin-C antibody. For blot overlay assays, purified GST protein and GST-syntenin (FL) fusion proteins (1 µg each) were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10%) and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The transferred protein were visualized using Ponceau S, and the membranes were blocked in buffer containing 6% casein, 1% polyvinyl pyrrolidone-40, 10 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with biotinylated peptide corresponding to the 16 amino acids carboxyl-terminal of sch-1 (biotin-LTLQSAKSRVAFFEEL) at a concentration of 2 µg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline containing 75 mmNaCl. The blots were washed three times for 10 min with PBS containing 75 mm NaCl, before incubation for 1 h at room temperature with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Pierce; 1:1500). After rinsing with PBS containing 75 mmNaCl, the presence of the biotinylated peptide was tested using ECL Western blotting detection reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Glutathione-Sepharose beads coupled to GST alone, or GST-syntenin (FL) was blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mmKCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). This step was followed by incubation either at 4 °C overnight or at 23 °C for 90 min with native schwannomin protein (4.8 µg) purified from human erythrocyte membranes (29Jindal H.K. Lutchman M. Marfatia S.M. Peters L.L. Hanspal M. Liu S.C. Jannatipour M. Rouleau G.A. Chishti A.H. American Society of Hematology Meeting Abstracts, November 15, 1998. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1998: 6aGoogle Scholar). After incubation, the beads were washed three times with the binding buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 detergent and once with the binding buffer without Nonidet P-40 detergent. Proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were blocked with blocking buffer (6% casein, 1% polyvinyl pyrrolidone-40, 10 mm EDTA in PBS, pH 7.4) and incubated with anti-schwannomin-1 antibody (C-18; SC-332; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature. After incubation, the blots were washed with buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20. Finally blots were incubated for 1 h with goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase and visualized using ECL detection reagent. A peptide corresponding to 30 amino acids from the amino-terminal end of syntenin, NH2-MSLYPSLEDLK VDKVIQAQTAFSANPANPA-COOH, was used to produce anti-syntenin-N. A second peptide corresponding to 30 amino acids from the carboxyl-terminal end of syntenin, NH2-IMPAFIFEHIIKR MAPSIMKSLMDHTIPEV-COOH, was used to produce anti-syntenin-C. Both antibodies were produced in rabbits, and in both cases the serum was immunopurified using their respective immobilized immunogen before their uses in experiments. HeLa cells (1 × 106) were lysed in 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (IB) (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA), 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors and centrifuged for 1 h at 4 °C. Proteins from the supernatant (500 µg) were incubated with immunopurified anti-syntenin-N (2 µg) and protein A/G-Sepharose beads (50 µl of 50% slurry solution; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitated material was washed four times with IB buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 before the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer. Finally the samples were resolved on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter (Schleicher & Schuell), and immunoblotted at 4 °C overnight with polyclonal anti-sch-1 (C-18; SC-332; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, 1:5000). Detection for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxydase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:5000) followed and ECL detection reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used to detect bound antibodies on Western blots. HeLa cells were cultured in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Stable tet-off cell lines (3T3-L1) were established according to the manufacturer's recommendations (CLONTECH Inc.). Stable tet-off cells (3T3-L1) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum with 2 µg/ml of doxycycline and 200 µg/ml of hygromycin for 24 h. For the inductions the cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution and then transferred in medium without doxycycline for 5 days. During induction tet system-approved fetal bovine serum (CLONTECH Inc.) was used. For immunocytochemistry, the cells were fixed (3% formaldehyde, 1× PBS) and permeabilized (0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 15 min at room temperature. This was followed by a blocking step with 10% goat serum for 1 h at room temperature and then incubation overnight at 4 °C with polyclonal anti-sch-1 (C-18; 0.4 µg/ml). After this the cells were rinsed and incubated first with biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody (1:750 dilution) and then with streptavidin-DTAF (1:500 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories Inc.). Slides were finally mounted and viewed with a polyvar fluorescent microscope. For confocal microscopy studies, glass coverslips were seeded with 2 × 105 HeLa cells per well. After incubation at 37 °C for 18 h, cells were transfected and allowed to recover for 24 h. Transfected HeLa cells were fixed (3% formaldehyde in PBS) at room temperature for 15 min and assessed for localization of green fluorescent protein using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica). We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the carboxyl-terminal 30 amino acids of sch-1 as bait (NH2-SDRGGSSKHNTI KKLTLQSAKSRVAFFEEL-COOH, pEG202LexA-sch-C30–1) to screen an oligo(dT)-primed human kidney cDNA library (30Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that a second screen was also attempted using a longer segment of sch-1 as bait (125 amino acids; pEGF202LexA-sch-C125–1) but was abandoned because of the invariable self-activation of this longer bait. Nonetheless the screen using the carboxyl-terminal 30 amino acids resulted in the isolation of eight clones specifically interacting with sch-C30–1 but not with LexA or an unrelated protein. Subsequent sequencing of those clones showed that they all encompassed the coding sequence of a protein known as syntenin or mda-9 (24Grootjans J.J. Zimmermann P. Reekmans G. Smets A. Degeest G.

Cell. 1999; 3: 423-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Full-length cDNA for syntenin (2,193 base pairs) was then obtained from Integrated Molecular Analysis of the human genome and its expression (I.M.A.G.E.). Syntenin cDNA encodes a 298-amino acid protein containing two PDZ domains in tandem. These two domains span amino acids 113 to 193 (PDZ1) and 198 to 273 (PDZ2), respectively (Fig. 1A). All eight clones isolated from the screen lacked the first 119 amino terminus residues of syntenin, but they all contained the two complete PDZ domains. To make sure that the observed syntenin-schwannomin interaction was indeed specific to isoform-1, we fused LexA to the last 25 amino acids from sch-2 (SDRGGSSKHNTIKKPQAQGRRPICI-COOH; pEG202LexA-sch-C25–2) and observed no interaction with the PDZ domains present in a syntenin (120) (see below for details). A search in the BLAST data base for expressed sequence tags yielded syntenin-matching sequence tags in many fetal and adult human tissue cDNA libraries suggesting widespread expression of syntenin at the mRNA level. To determine the tissue distribution of syntenin, a multiple tissue RNA blot (CLONTECH) was probed with a complete syntenin cDNA probe. The results indicate that syntenin is present as a single species of 2.4 kilobases with strongest expression observed in pancreas, skeletal muscle, placenta, and heart with limited expression seen in brain, lung, liver, and kidney (data not shown). Sequences derived from all previously obtained clones showed that the region upstream to the first PDZ domains of syntenin is not involved in the association with sch-1. We used the vector pJG4–5 to subclone regions of syntenin downstream from the beginning of the first PDZ domain and narrow down the region necessary for maintaining the association between syntenin and the carboxyl-terminal end of sch-1 (Fig. 1 B). First we tested a construct, syntenin (120), where both the upstream and downstream sequences to the PDZ domains were missing. The loss of the downstream sequences flanking the PDZ domains of syntenin dramatically weakened its interaction with sch-1. To test whether the presence of both PDZ domains was essential for the interaction with sch-1 to occur, two separate constructs were prepared. One construct, syntenin 113–193, contained only the first PDZ domain whereas the syntenin 198–273 construct contained only the second PDZ domain. The results from the interactions using these single PDZ domain constructs indicated that they do not sustain the association with schwannomin. Additional constructs were engineered, syntenin (1) and syntenin (172), so that each one of the PDZ domains was complemented by partial flanking sequences from the second PDZ domain. These partially complemented PDZ domains constructs of syntenin were used to test whether they could rescued the interaction of with sch-1, and both showed that no interactions between their product and sch-1 occurred (Fig. 1 B). Finally, we examined the requirement of the last 25 amino acids of syntenin for binding to sch-1. A new construct of syntenin was made, syntenin (1), lacking only the last 42 amino acids, also failed to interact with sch-1. In fact, absolutely no interaction between the product from this construct and schwannomin was observed. By comparison, an interaction between the product from the syntenin (120) construct and schwannomin was observed, although it was weaker when compared with the interactions observed between schwannomin and either syntenin (FL) or syntenin (120) products (Fig. 1 B). Therefore, the 21 amino acids residues located between positions 257 and 273 are necessary for the interaction between syntenin and sch-1 to occur as their removal completely prevented the interaction between the two proteins. By generating a series of alanine substitutions within the last 30 amino acids sch-1, we further analyzed the interactions between syntenin and sch-1. These interactions were again measured using the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. 1 C). These modified amino acids within the VAFFEEL domain showed that substitutions of both phenylalanine residues at positions −3 and −4 for alanine can completely abrogate the interaction with syntenin. Not all substitution within the VAFFEEL completely abrogated the interaction. Alanine substitution of either valine or glutamic acid residues at respective positions −6 and −1 of sch-1 simply weakened it as seen by the completed absence of blue from the β-galactosidase reporter gene in combination with weaker growth over Leu−plates. The last alanine substitutions within the VAFFEEL of both the leucine and glutamic acid residues at positions 0 and −2, respectively, had no effect on the interaction between syntenin sch-1. The interactions between syntenin and any of the products from sch-1 constructs where either one of the remaining 23 amino acids (located outside of the VAFFEEL region) were substituted for alanine were all tested and found to be positives (data not shown). All together, these results indicate that there is a specific signature sequence at the C terminus of sch-1, which is crucial for its recognition by the PDZ domains of syntenin. Both to confirm the true nature of the interaction between syntenin and sch-1 and to further investigate the role of the VAFFEEL domain, we tested it in vitro. To do this we used a biotinylated sch-1 peptide containing the VAFFEEL domain (biotin-LTLQSAKS RVAFFEEL) and both full-length syntenin or syntenin (120) GST fusion proteins. These GST fusion proteins were independently incubated in the presence of the sch-1 biotinylated peptide (Fig. 2A,lanes 1–9) so that the peptide-protein complexes could be pulled down using streptavidin beads. Before loading the proteins were boiled for 5 min in 50 µl of SDS sample buffer so that the complexes would be disrupted. Before any pull-down, a single syntenin band corresponding to either GST-syntenin (FL) or GST-syntenin (120) was detected when using both the anti-GST antibody (Fig. 2 A,lanes 2 and 3) and the anti-syntenin-C antibody (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5 and 6). When the streptavidin bead pull-down was performed (Fig. 2 A,lanes 7–9), and the proteins were detected using the same anti-syntenin-C antibody (Fig. 2 A, lanes 8 and9), the detected bands matched exactly with"

Here, we show that STAT3 inversely regulates activation of Ral through induction of expression of RalGDS. To identify new leukemia inhibitory factor-induced genes, we have performed representational difference analysis using M1 mouse myeloid leukemia cells and cloned RalGDS. The expression of RalGDS and subsequent activation of RalA were clearly suppressed by a dominant negative form of STAT3 and a JAK inhibitor, JAB/SOCS1/SSI-1, indicating that RalGDS/RalA signaling requires the activation of the JAK/STAT3 pathway. An experiment using a Ras inhibitor demonstrated that full activation of RalA also requires activation of Ras.

These cytokines use gp130 as a common receptor subunit. The binding of ligands to gp130 activates the JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway, where STAT3 plays a central role in transmitting the signals from the membrane to the nucleus (1Hirano T. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2548-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). So far, a considerable number of candidate target genes of STAT3 have been characterized, most of which belong to genes regulating cell cycle progression and/or anti-apoptosis. For instance, cyclin D1/D2/D3/A,cdc25A, c-myc, pim-1,bcl-2, and bcl-x are up-regulated by STAT3 activation (2Fukada T. Hibi M. Yamanaka Y. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Fujitani Y. Yamaguchi T. Nakajima K.

In contrast, in some cases, STAT3 contributes to cell cycle arrest by inducing cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as p19INK4D and p21CIP1 (6Bellido T. O'Brien C.A. Roberson P.K. Manolagas S.C.

However, as it is difficult to explain the molecular mechanisms of the diverse signaling effects of STAT3 by any combination of these already identified genes, further identification of STAT3-regulated genes is required. RalGDS was initially identified as a gene homologous to the CDC25 family and found to stimulate the release of guanine nucleotide from Ral GTPase (8Albright C.F. Giddings B.W. Liu J. Vito M. Weinberg R.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). A distinct family of Ras-related GTPases, Ral, consists of two highly similar proteins, RalA and RalB (85% identical) (9Chardin P. Tavitian A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2203-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The function of Ral proteins has yet to be further investigated, but recent reports suggest their crucial role in cellular transformation, differentiation, vesicle transport, and receptor endocytosis (10Feig L.A.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Ral is essential for STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation induced by epidermal growth factor or IL-6 and that Src kinase activation by Ral plays a key role in this process. To identify the genes involved in signal transduction via gp130, we have performed representational difference analysis (RDA) using M1 cells, which differentiate into macrophages upon STAT3 activation by LIF/IL-6. Here we demonstrate that RalA is activated by the JAK/STAT3/RalGDS pathway, and its activity is also modulated by activation of Ras in M1 cells. M1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% horse serum. Single-cell suspensions of splenocytes were prepared from spleen of 6-week-old Std-ddY mice (Japan SLC Inc.). For cell stimulation, 5 ng/ml recombinant murine LIF (Strathmann Biotech), 50 ng/ml recombinant human IL-6 (KIRIN Brewer Co. Ltd.) or 50 ng/ml recombinant human soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) (R & D System) was used. M1/Y705F cell was established by infecting M1 cells with retrovirus containing pMXneo-Myc-Y705F, which was mutated by polymerase chain reaction (14Kitamura T. Morikawa Y. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 134: 143-152PubMed Google Scholar). 0.5 µg of mRNA or 5 µg of total RNA was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel and blotted to Hybond-N nylon filter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The filter was hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probes in rapid hybridization buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Whole cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells in Laemmli sample buffer. An equivalent amount of cell lysate (50 µg) was electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon, Millipore), stained with antibodies, and detected for signals with the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The activity of Ras and Ral was measured as previously described (15Wolthuis R.M. Franke B. van Triest M. Bauer B. Cool R.H. Camonis J.H. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2486-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 16de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). M1 cells (3 × 106) were lysed with the lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and were incubated with GST·RIP1 or GST·Raf protein bound to agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis followed by blotting with antibodies to either RalA, RalB, or Ras (Transduction Laboratory). To produce GST·RIP1 and GST·Raf, DNA fragments corresponding to amino acids 397–518 of RIP1 and 51–131 of Raf were subcloned to pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), respectively. cDNA libraries were prepared from M1 cells treated with LIF for 1 h and untreated M1 cells and were applied for RDA as a tester and a driver, respectively (17Lisitsyn N. Lisitsyn N. Wigler M. Science. 1993; 259: 946-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar, 18Hubank M. Schatz D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5640-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). After three rounds of subtraction, we sequenced 85 DNA fragments. Fourteen fragments were part of the RalGDS gene, corresponding to regions 3098–3327 (GenBankTM accession number L07924). To confirm that RalGDS is induced upon LIF stimulation, we examined its expression by Northern blot analysis. RalGDS mRNA was obviously induced 1 h after LIF stimulation and down-regulated to basal level at 9 h (Fig.1A). Stimulation with IL-6 also increased RalGDS mRNA at a similar level (Fig. 1 B). While there exist other Ral-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RalGEF) such as Rgl and Rlf (19Kikuchi A. Demo S.D. Ye Z.H. Chen Y.W. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7483-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 20Wolthuis R.M. Bauer B. van't, Veer L.J. de Vries-Smits A.M. Cool R.H. Spaargaren M. Wittinghofer A. Burgering B.M Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 353-362PubMed Google Scholar), the expression of none of the two genes was up-regulated upon LIF stimulation (Fig.1 C). Then we examined whether IL-6 would induce RalGDS expression not only in M1 cells but also in primary cells. As shown in Fig. 1 D, stimulation of IL-6 plus sIL-6R clearly induced mRNA from RalGDS in murine splenocytes. The induction was, however, weaker compared with that observed in M1 cells. To investigate whether the induction of RalGDS depends on STAT3 activation, we analyzed its induction in two cell lines: M1/Y705F that expresses a dominant-negative form of STAT3 (Y705F) and M1/JAB that expresses a JAK inhibitor, JAB/SOCS1/SSI-1 (21Masuhara M. Sakamoto H. Matsumoto A. Suzuki R. Yasukawa H. Mitsui K. Wakioka T. Tanimura S. Sasaki A. Misawa H. Yokouchi M. Ohtsubo M. Yoshimura A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). When stimulated with LIF, both cell lines showed much weaker phosphorylation of tyrosine on 705 of STAT3 (Tyr-705) than parental M1 cells (Fig.2A). Corresponding to the levels of phosphorylation of Tyr-705, the induction of RalGDS mRNA was clearly reduced in both M1/Y705F and M1/JAB (Fig. 2 C,lanes 4 and 6). These data strongly suggest that the induction of RalGDS is dependent on the activation of the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway. In addition to the JAK/STAT3 pathway, LIF/IL-6 also activates the SHP-2/Grb2/MAP kinase pathway through gp130 (2Fukada T. Hibi M. Yamanaka Y. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Fujitani Y. Yamaguchi T. Nakajima K.

Thus, we also investigated the possibility that the induction of RalGDS might require the activity of MAP kinase. As shown in Fig. 2 B, MAP kinase was activated in M1 cells upon LIF stimulation, and a MEK inhibitor, PD98059, inhibited activation. However, PD98059 had no effect on induction of RalGDS mRNA (Fig. 2 C, lane 8), indicating that the SHP-2/Grb2/MAP kinase pathway is dispensable for the up-regulation of RalGDS expression. To investigate whether this process requires de novo protein synthesis, M1 cells were stimulated in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX). As shown in Fig.2 D, addition of CHX did not affect RalGDS expression, suggesting that RalGDS might be directly regulated by STAT3. Next, we examined whether the enhanced expression of RalGDS would bring about the activation of Ral in response to LIF stimulation. Activation of Ral was evaluated by in vitro binding to GST·RIP1, one of the effector molecules of Ral (23Park S.H. Weinberg R.A. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2349-2355PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3A, while the activity of RalB was nearly unchanged, that of RalA increased 1 h after stimulation and returned to the basal level after 12 h. RalA was also activated by IL-6 (data not shown). The time course of RalA activation appears to correspond to that of RalGDS expression. Interestingly, activation of RalA was detected in neither M1/Y705F nor M1/JAB, (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2 and 4). On the other hand, PD98059 had no effect on RalA activation (Fig.3 B, lane 6). These data strongly indicated that activation of RalA could be downstream of the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway rather than via a MAP kinase pathway. In addition, a protein synthesis inhibitor, CHX, diminished the activation of RalA, which indicated that de novo protein synthesis is required for the activation of RalA (Fig. 3 B, lane 8). It has been reported that another GTPase molecule, Ras, is necessary for the activation of Ral, possibly by the recruitment of RalGDS to the cytoplasmic membrane (24Hofer F. Fields S. Schneider C. Martin G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4578-4584Google Scholar, 25Urano T. Emkey R. Feig L.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 26Matsubara K. Kishida S. Matsuura Y. Kitayama H. Noda M. Kikuchi A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1303-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the activity of Ras in M1 cells by in vitro binding to the GST·Raf fusion protein. Ras was already activated 0.5 h after stimulation with LIF, and the activation continued to 3 h (Fig.4A). To examine whether Ras activity is required for full activation of RalA, we utilized FTI-277, a specific farnesylation inhibitor. After 24 h of treatment with FTI-277, M1 cells were stimulated with LIF and then subjected to the Ras or RalA activation assay. As shown in the lower panel of Fig.4 Ba, FTI-277 converted about 50% of Ras into a non-farnesylated form (27Lerner E.C. Qian Y. Blaskovich M.A. Fossum R.D. Vogt A. Sun J. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26802-26806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), followed by decreased activation of both Ras and RalA (Fig. 4 B, a and b). On the other hand, FTI-277 did not suppress the induction of RalGDS (Fig.4 Bc). These results indicate that activation of RalA by LIF are also modulated by the activity of Ras. Some evidence suggests the existence of other signaling molecules such as Rap GTPases to activate the RalGDS/Ral pathway (11Wolthuis R.M. Bos J.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. 1999; 9: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), but the activation of Rap1 was not observed in M1 cells (data not shown). IL-6 family cytokines transduce signals into the cell by binding to their cognate receptors, followed by dimerization and activation of JAK kinases, which subsequently phosphorylate tyrosine residues of gp130 to recruit signal-transducing molecules, most notably STAT1/STAT3 and SHP-2. Tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 enters the nucleus, where it regulates the transcription of a variety of genes. On the other hand, SHP-2 interacts with Grb2 and Gab1 and mediates signals to ERK MAP kinase. Thus gp130 generates two distinct major signaling pathways (1Hirano T. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2548-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated that RalGDS mRNA, one of the effector molecules of Ras (24Hofer F. Fields S. Schneider C. Martin G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4578-4584Google Scholar), is clearly induced by LIF/IL-6 in M1 cells. This induction appears rather specific to RalGDS among the RalGEF because Rgl or Rlf was not induced. Moreover, we have shown that induction of RalGDS is definitely regulated by JAK/STAT3 signaling and that the activity of RalA is dependent on the transcription of RalGDS and on the gp130/Ras pathway, which is likely to involve an SHP-2/Grb2/Sos cascade (22Takahashi-Tezuka M. Yoshida Y. Fukada T. Ohtani T. Yamanaka Y. Nishida K. Nakajima K. Hibi M. Hirano T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4109-4117Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). As far as we know, this is the first report that a small G protein is activated by transcriptional induction of a guanine nucleotide exchange factor. The finding of an increase of RalGDS expression in IL-6-stimulated splenocytes may provide evidence for a physiological involvement of RalGDS induction in gp130 signaling. However, its induction by STAT3 activation seemed to be cell-type specific. Whereas a murine lymphoid subline, DA1.a, expressed RalGDS mRNA upon LIF stimulation, G-CSF, which activates STAT3, did not induce its expression in a murine myeloid cell line, 32D (data not shown). These results suggest that the induction of RalGDS might require some events other than STAT3 activation. Goi et al. (13Goi T. Shipitsin M. Lu Z. Foster D.A. Klinz S.G. Feig L.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) reported that activated Ral regulates the phosphorylation of STAT3 through activation of Src kinase. Together with their observation, our results provide the possibility that STAT3 and Ral regulate each other to exert biological functions. Indeed, some studies have shown that Ral and STAT3 exert similar biological functions. Introduction of the catalytic domain of RalGEF, Rgr, into PC12 cells inhibited NGF-induced neurite outgrowth whereas a dominant-negative form of Ral accelerated it. Thus the RalGEF/Ral pathway is likely to have a negative effect on the NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells (28Goi T. Rusanescu G. Urano T. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 19: 1731-1741Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Ihara et al. (29Ihara S. Nakajima K. Fukada T. Hibi M. Nagata S. Hirano T. Fukui Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5345-5352Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) found that STAT3 also negatively regulates the neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells. Recent studies provided the evidence that STAT3 is a critical signaling molecule involved in v-Src transformation (30Bromberg J.F. Horvath C.M. Besser D. Lathem W.W. Darnell J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1553-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 31Turkson J. Bowman T. Garcia R. Caldenhoven E. De, Groot R.P. Jove R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1545-1552Crossref Scopus (591) Google Scholar) and that a constitutively active form of STAT3 itself was sufficient for oncogenesis (4Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2486) Google Scholar). Urano et al. (25Urano T. Emkey R. Feig L.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) reported that Ral enhances the transforming activities of other oncogenes, while it does not induce oncogenic transformation on its own. Further studies should elucidate the biological function of possible cross-talk between STAT3 and Ral. Taken together, the data we present here indicate that LIF/IL-6 activates RalA by a novel combination of JAK/STAT3/RalGDS and Ras pathways in M1 cells and will shed new light on the elucidation of signal transduction of gp130.

White, Alexey S. Ladokhin, Sajith Jayasinghe, and Kalina Hristova focuses on the structure and folding of α-helical transmembrane domain-containing proteins. Two important concepts are developed. The first is that of the lipid bilayer being comprised of two chemically distinct regions of different hydrophobicities, a relatively polar membrane interface and a relatively nonpolar hydrocarbon core. Interestingly and importantly, these two membrane regions are of approximately equal thermal thickness per monolayer. The membrane interface is the region where much of membrane protein folding takes place. The second important concept is that of the overriding thermodynamic importance of the peptide bond and of the need to form hydrogen bonds between peptide bonds prior to insertion of α-helical proteins into the membrane. This latter concept is discussed in the context of a four-step model for α-helical membrane protein assembly that involves partitioning of the unfolded protein into the membrane interface, folding to an α-helical structure, insertion of the α-helix into the bilayer, and finally and as necessary, assembly of individual helices into bundles.The second minireview of the series entitled “Structure and Assembly of β-Barrel Membrane Proteins” by Lukas K. Tamm, Ashish Arora, and Jörg H. Kleinschmidt focuses on the other major class of integral membrane proteins. In this minireview Tamm et al. describe the various known types of β-barrel proteins that contain 8, 12, 16, and 18 anti-parallel β strands assembled in different quaternary structures. Again, this review highlights and reinforces the importance of forming hydrogen-bonded secondary structures in order for any protein to be inserted into a bilayer membrane. The authors also summarize evidence from elegant experiments with OmpA, an eight-stranded β-barrel protein, for a four-step model for the folding and insertion of β-barrel proteins into membranes. This model is similar to that for assembly of α-helical proteins except that a significant part of the folding, following H-bond formation, occurs within the membrane as the β-barrel protein moves from an H-bonded but partially folded “molten disc” form to a mature “native” protein.The third minireview entitled “Detergents as Tools in Membrane Biochemistry” by R. Michael Garavito and Shelagh Ferguson-Miller describes the physical and chemical properties of synthetic detergents used in solubilizing, purifying, and crystallizing membrane proteins. The authors emphasize the importance of understanding the phase behaviors of detergents when considering these reagents as preparative tools for obtaining purified membrane proteins for functional and structural studies. For example, they provide a current view of the dynamic structures of micelles and how these are influenced by salts, other polar solutes and proteins, as well as how detergents in various different physical states interact with and influence membrane protein structures. The authors also highlight examples of the specific binding of membrane lipids to proteins. This important concept in membrane protein structural biology has become apparent from recent high-resolution x-ray crystallographic studies of bacteriorhodopsin and cytochrome c oxidase. Specifically bound lipids may well be the rule rather than the exception, and in many instances it may be advantageous to retain these bound lipids in the presence of solubilizing detergents.The final minireview of this series by Wonhwa Cho is entitled “Membrane Targeting by C1 and C2 Domains.” C1 and C2 domains were first discovered in protein kinase C. The C1 domain is known to bind 1,2-diacylglycerol that is produced in the membrane as a product of the action of hormone-activated phospholipase C on phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. The C2 domain is a structural motif that has now been identified in a number of proteins including protein kinase C, cytosolic phospholipase A2, and synaptotagmins. Different C2 domains can bind either two or three divalent calcium ions reversibly. Ca2+ binds to C2 domains when there are hormone-induced increases in the concentration of intracellular Ca2+. Once Ca2+ becomes bound to a C2 domain, this domain binds to intracellular membranes. For example, protein kinase Cα binds to the plasma membrane and cytosolic phospholipase A2 binds to the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope. Cho describes the properties of C1 and C2 domains and their modes of association with membranes.The authors and editors hope that this minireview series on membrane protein structural biology will enable researchers in the biological and chemical sciences to appreciate and explore further this novel group of proteins.
