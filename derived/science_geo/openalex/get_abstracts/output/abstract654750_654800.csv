https://openalex.org/W3106028942,"Like many scientific disciplines, neuroscience has increasingly attempted to confront pervasive gender imbalances within the field. While much of the conversation has centered around publishing and conference participation, recent research in other fields has called attention to the prevalence of gender bias in citation practices. Because of the downstream effects that citations can have on visibility and career advancement, understanding and eliminating gender bias in citation practices is vital for addressing inequity in a scientific community. In this study, we sought to determine whether there is evidence of gender bias in the citation practices of neuroscientists. Using data from five top neuroscience journals, we find that reference lists tend to include more papers with men as first and last author than would be expected if gender were not a factor in referencing. Importantly, we show that this overcitation of men and undercitation of women is driven largely by the citation practices of men, and is increasing over time as the field becomes more diverse. We develop a co-authorship network to assess homophily in researchers' social networks, and we find that men tend to overcite men even when their social networks are representative. We discuss possible mechanisms and consider how individual researchers might address these findings in their own practices."

Development of effective vaccines or treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infection will be aided by a molecular-level understanding of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and their interactions with host cell proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein is highly homologous to the N protein of SARS-CoV, which is essential for viral RNA replication and packaging into new virions. Emerging models indicate that nucleocapsid proteins of other viruses can form biomolecular condensates to spatiotemporally regulate N protein localization and function. Our bioinformatic analyses, in combination with pre-existing experimental evidence, suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein is capable of forming or regulating biomolecular condensates in vivo by interaction with RNA and key host cell proteins. We discuss multiple models, whereby the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 may harness this activity to regulate viral life cycle and host cell response to viral infection."

In addition to the routine use of histological subtyping in cancer diagnosis and therapy decision-making, a renewed interest has emerged in the identification of novel predictive factors to improve patient stratification and therapeutic response. Malignant transformation and disease progression involve multiple changes in biosynthetic and energy production pathways, offering opportunities to exploit the clinical utility of metabolic tracking in diagnosis and disease monitoring (Vander Heiden and DeBerardinis, 2017Vander Heiden M.G. DeBerardinis R.J. Understanding the Intersections between Metabolism and Cancer Biology.Cell. 2017; 168: 657-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). Cells can also reprogram pathways of nutrient acquisition and processing as a result of oncogenic activation of commonly perturbed signaling pathways (Tarrado-Castellarnau et al., 2016Tarrado-Castellarnau M. de Atauri P. Cascante M. Oncogenic regulation of tumor metabolic reprogramming.Oncotarget. 2016; 7: 62726-62753Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A characteristic example is the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which regulates a wide range of transcriptional and post-translational programs to support the anabolic and catabolic requirements of proliferating cells (Carracedo and Pandolfi, 2008Carracedo A.

These observations raise some fundamental questions: whether we can use metabolic tracking for more effective screening of the molecular features underlying tumor pathogenesis and, ultimately, whether this information can be translated into better and more efficacious treatment strategies for each patient. Indeed, the concept of metabotyping has been widely applicable in characterizing functionally distinct traits that have the power to influence clinical decision-making (Gavaghan et al., 2000Gavaghan C.L.

Metabolic phenotyping in clinical and surgical environments.Nature. 2012; 491: 384-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Here, we used rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (REIMS), which coupled to the intelligent surgical device, also known as iKnife, allows for instantaneous chemical analysis of the aerosol generated during electrosurgical tissue ablation and cauterization, in the form of gas-phase ionic species. Unlike other technologies that are commonly used for metabolite profiling, such as liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), REIMS analysis requires no sample preparation and allows for near real-time (1–2 s) lipidomic analysis and tissue recognition, based on multivariate classification analysis of spectral libraries of reference mass spectra. The iKnife/REIMS can be used both in the intraoperative and biopsy collection settings to differentiate cancerous from non-cancerous tissues with very high precision, based on their lipidomic composition (Alexander et al., 2017Alexander J. Gildea L. Balog J. Speller A. McKenzie J. Muirhead L. Scott A. Kontovounisios C. Rasheed S.

However, the potential of using this technology beyond the pattern-level identification of tissues, to reveal the biological mechanisms underlying unique metabolic signatures, or identify which patients will likely benefit from a given treatment, has not yet been explored. We first examined whether REIMS-detected lipid signatures correlate with any established molecular markers of breast cancer of known prognostic and therapeutic value (Figure 1A). For this, we selected a panel of 43 breast cancer cell lines, 18 patient-derived xenograft (PDX), and 12 primary breast tumors that are well characterized for their estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), and HER2 receptor status. REIMS profiling of cell lines consistently classified ER, HER2, and triple negative status (TN) with area under the curve (AUC) accuracies between 0.8–0.9, and 0.6–0.7 for PR (Figure 1B). Consistent with previous studies (Hilvo et al., 2011Hilvo M. Denkert C. Lehtinen L. Müller B. Brockmöller S. Seppänen-Laakso T. Budczies J. Bucher E. Yetukuri L. Castillo S. et al.Novel theranostic opportunities offered by characterization of altered membrane lipid metabolism in breast cancer progression.Cancer Res. 2011; 71: 3236-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), the most striking differences in lipid profiles were observed between ER-positive (+ve) and -negative (−ve) breast cancer cell lines (Figures 1B and S1A; Table S1) and tumor specimens (Figure S1B). A surrogate marker for ER positivity, aside from its routine determination by immunohistochemistry (IHC), is expression of the estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) gene. We built a regression model to predict ESR1 expression based on the spectral profiles obtained by REIMS and tested this in representative ER+ve cell lines treated with or without 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4-OHT). Of note, the predicted ESR1 expression was significantly reduced following 4-OHT treatment as compared to untreated controls (Figures 1C and S1C), suggesting that the modulation of ER signaling induces distinct lipidomic alterations, which are detectable by REIMS and are reversible by ER inhibition. With a robust lipidomic profile obtained using REIMS, we next performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering to partition all breast cancer cell lines on the basis of their spectral similarities measured over 872 lipid species. This analysis revealed two subtypes with distinctive signatures, in which REIMS-detected lipid species were significantly enriched (black) or depleted (gray) (Figure 1D). The observed clusters were also confirmed using a consensus non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) (Figure S1D). To shed light on the mechanism that is driving this unique metabolic classification, we examined mutational enrichment of the cells between the two subtypes. Out of the top 150 genes that are frequently (>20%) mutated in these cell lines, oncogenic mutation in PIK3CA was the only one to be significantly (Fisher’s test, p value = 0.019) overrepresented in the lipid-enriched cluster (Figure 1E; Table S2). In accordance with this finding, analysis of isogenic MCF10A PIK3CA wild-type (WT) and mutant (MUT) (E545K and H1047R) cell lines also revealed clustering of the latter in the lipid-enriched group, both when cells were cultured in 2D, or 3D as spheroids (Figures 1E and S1E). Consistent with this stratification, performing gene and functional pathway enrichment analyses revealed KEGG-pathway ontologies relating to metabolic pathways that were significantly associated with the lipid-enriched subtype (Figures S2A and S2B). Specific overexpressed genes included FASN and ELOVL6, which are involved in de novo lipogenesis, and LDLRAP1, which facilitates exogenous lipid uptake (Figures S2C–S2E). Indeed, PIK3CA MUT cells displayed elevated induction of the de novo lipogenesis transcriptional regulator SREBP1 (Figure 1F) and higher exogenous FA uptake capacity (Figure 1G), suggesting that both could contribute to the lipid-enriched metabotype. Most importantly, the observed metabolic stratification was also evident among PIK3CA WT and MUT breast cancer PDXs (Figure 1H) and primary tumors (Figure 1I; Table S3). Among the PDX tumors assessed (n = 18), only one was misclassified (BR5017), and this harbored a rare I391M mutation that has activity reminiscent of WT PIK3CA (Dan et al., 2010Dan S. Okamura M. Seki M. Yamazaki K. Sugita H. Okui M. Mukai Y. Nishimura H. Asaka R. Nomura K. et al.Correlating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor efficacy with signaling pathway status: in silico and biological evaluations.Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 4982-4994Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) (Figure 1H). Overall, PIK3CA mutation status in both PDX and primary tumors could be classified with an accuracy of 90% using all measurable lipid species (Figure S1F), suggesting that the iKnife/REIMS could be used for near real-time diagnosis of PIK3CA MUT breast cancers by MS analysis of aerosolized tissue material. The effects of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling on lipid metabolism have been observed on numerous levels (Dibble and Manning, 2013Dibble C.C. Manning B.D.

To elucidate the specific mechanisms underlying the observed phenotype, we treated PIK3CA MUT cells with inhibitors targeting the activity of key nodes in the PI3K pathway (Figure 2A), albeit at concentrations that do not affect cell viability (Figure S3A). PI3K (BYL719, BKM120) and mTOR (rapamycin, torin 1) inhibition dramatically reduced relative phospholipid levels, but surprisingly, Akt inhibition with either MK2206 or GSK690693 did not (Figure 2B). Similar results were observed in a panel of 5 PIK3CA MUT breast cancer cell lines, with the exception of MCF7 cells that also responded to MK2206 (Figure S3B).Figure S3Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Cell viability of MCF10A PIK3CA MUT cells following treatment with increasing concentrations of rapamycin, torin 1, BYL-719, BKM120, MK2206 or GSK690693 for 72 hours.

Interestingly, we did not observe an effect on relative phospholipid abundances following acute exposure to rapamycin for 4 h, despite inhibition of mTORC1 (Figures 2A, bottom left panel, and 2B). Because extended rapamycin treatment inhibits mTORC1 and mTORC2 (Figure 2A, bottom right panel) (Sarbassov et al., 2006Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Sengupta S. Sheen J.H. Hsu P.P. Bagley A.F.

Knockdown of RICTOR or mTOR, but not RAPTOR, led to a significant reduction in relative phospholipid abundances (Figures 2C and 2D), pointing to a PIK3CA- and mTORC2-dependent metabolic phenotype that is largely independent of mTORC1 or Akt inhibition. Given that global lipidomic profiles could stratify breast cancer cell lines and tumors based on PIK3CA mutation status, we next aimed to characterize specific lipid alterations that are associated with oncogenic PIK3CA. Fatty acids (FAs), which are the main constituents of phospholipids and have additional effector functions in cancer pathogenesis, were profiled in the PIK3CA isogenic panel using REIMS. Among the most abundant FAs in PIK3CA MUT compared to WT cells were palmitoleate (FA16:1), palmitic acid (FA16:0), and oleic acid (FA18:1), all of which are established products of elevated lipogenesis and in line with the observed lipid enriched phenotype (Figure 1D; Table S4). Interestingly, the second most significantly elevated FA after palmitoleate was arachidonic acid (AA) (FA20:4), an omega-6 FA which is predominantly found in animal fats and is of particular relevance as a major regulator of pro-inflammatory responses in cancer, through the production of bio-active lipids known as eicosanoids (Wang and Dubois, 2010Wang D. Dubois R.N. Eicosanoids and cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10: 181-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar) (Figure 3A; Table S4). Importantly, in addition to the cell lines, significant elevations in AA were also observed in all the PIK3CA MUT breast PDX and primary tumors (Figures 3B and 3C) and across tumors of other tissue types including ovarian, pancreatic, and sarcomas (Figure 3D). In agreement with our REIMS findings, AA and downstream eicosanoids were also found to be significantly elevated in both PIK3CA MUT cells using LC-MS (Figures 3E, S4A, and S4B).Figure S4Related to Figures 3 and 4Show full captionIntracellular levels of (A) Arachidonic acid (AA) and (B) PGE2 levels as measured by LC-MS profiling.

P values in (A), (B), (C) and (F) were calculated using one-way ANOVA followed by unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t test with Bonferroni correction, and in (D) and (E) with two-way ANOVA. To measure FAs that are secreted from cells, as opposed to those that might already exist in serum-supplemented media, cells were grown under FA-deprived conditions. Pro-inflammatory derivatives of AA were significantly increased in the media of PIK3CA MUT cells (Figure 3F), signifying a potential role for these bio-active lipids in tumor microenvironment (TME) interactions. Next, to ascertain the functional consequences of elevated eicosanoid metabolism, the effects of PIK3CA MUT-derived conditioned media (CM) were assessed. PIK3CA WT cells displayed dramatically increased proliferative rate following incubation with CM obtained from MUT cells, and this was effectively rescued by depleting the lipids from the media (Figures 3G, S4C, and S4D). Moreover, the proliferation of both PIK3CA MUT cell lines was significantly reduced following incubation with their respective lipid-deprived CM (Figures 3H and S4E), whereas supplementation of lipid-deprived CM with AA, but not palmitate or palmitoleate, restored proliferation in both WT and MUT cells (Figures 3G, 3H, S4D, and S4E). Together, these data support not only a critical role for oncogenic PIK3CA in influencing autocrine- and paracrine-mediated cell proliferation, but also point to AA as an easily measured metabolic biomarker that could help with the diagnosis and treatment of PIK3CA MUT tumors. To better understand the mechanism by which PIK3CA MUT cells have elevated AA, we assessed various pathways which contribute to its cellular pool, including: direct exogenous uptake, synthesis from linoleic acid, hydrolysis from diacylglycerol (DAG), or endogenous release from membrane phospholipid through phospholipase (PLAs) activity. Curiously, we noted a persistent increase in AA in PIK3CA MUT isogenic panel even when cells were cultured with FA-free media (Figure 3A). Additionally, DAG levels—that can be in part generated from the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)—were significantly reduced in PIK3CA MUT cells (Figures S4F and S4G). These results pointed to a potential role for phospholipases (PLAs), of which three main classes predominate: cytosolic/calcium-dependent (cPLA2), calcium-independent (iPLA2), and secretory (sPLA2) phospholipase A2 (Burke and Dennis, 2009Burke J.E.

It is an important determinant of child survival and development, as well as long-term consequences like the onset of non-communicable disease in the life course. A large number of mortality and morbidity can be prevented by addressing the factors associated with low birth weight. The main objective of this study was to identify associated risk factors of low birth weight.A health facility-based unmatched case-control study was carried out from July 2018 to March 2019 among the mothers who delivered in health facilities of Dang district of Nepal from 17th August to 16th November 2018. The total sample size for the study was 369; 123 cases and 246 controls. Cases and controls were randomly selected independent of the exposure status in the ratio of 1:2. Information regarding exposure status was assessed through interviews and medical records. Mothers who delivered outside Dang districts were excluded from the study. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Institutional Review Committee (IRC) of the Institute of Medicine, Tribhuvan University and written consent was taken from each participant after explaining the objectives of the study.Multivariate logistic regression found that having the kitchen in the same living house (AOR 2.7, CI: 1.5-4.8), iron intake less than 180 tablets (AOR 3.2, CI: 1.7-5.7), maternal weight gain during second and third trimester less than 6.53 kg (AOR 2.6, CI: 1.5-4.7), co-morbidity during pregnancy (AOR 2.4, CI: 1.3-4.5), preterm birth (AOR 2.9, CI: 1.4-6.1) were the risk factors associated with low birth weight.Having the kitchen in the same living house, iron intake less than 180 tablets during pregnancy, maternal weight gain less than 6.53 kg during the second and third trimester, co-morbidity during pregnancy and preterm birth were the risk factors associated with low birth weight."
https://openalex.org/W3036696453,"Successful cloning by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) requires overcoming significant epigenetic barriers. Genomic imprinting is not generally regarded as such a barrier, although H3K27me3-dependent imprinting is differentially distributed in E6.5 epiblast and extraembryonic tissues. Here we report significant enhancement of SCNT efficiency by deriving somatic donor cells carrying simultaneous monoallelic deletion of four H3K27me3-imprinted genes from haploid mouse embryonic stem cells. Quadruple monoallelic deletion of Sfmbt2, Jade1, Gab1, and Smoc1 normalized H3K27me3-imprinted expression patterns and increased fibroblast cloning efficiency to 14% compared with a 0% birth rate from wild-type fibroblasts while preventing the placental and body overgrowth defects frequently observed in cloned animals. Sfmbt2 deletion was the most effective of the four individual gene deletions in improving SCNT. These results show that lack of H3K27me3 imprinting in somatic cells is an epigenetic barrier that impedes post-implantation development of SCNT embryos and can be overcome by monoallelic imprinting gene deletions in donor cells."
https://openalex.org/W3035948690,"Our research aims to identify the role of thrombospondin 4 (THBS4) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). First, bioinformatic analysis was applied for detection the expression of THBS4 in HCC samples, and qRT-PCR and western blot were performed to explore the expression of THBS4 in HCC tissues and adjacent samples. Next, colony formation assay and cell viability assay were used to assess the function of THBS4 on HCC cells growth while transwell assay and scratch test were for metastasis. Meanwhile Xenograft tumor models were further conducted to verify the function of THBS4 in HCC. As for mechanism in deep, we investigated the influence of THBS4 on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) development and the interaction between THBS4 and integrin (ITG) family using multiple experiments, including western blot, immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation (IP). As a result, our research discovered that the overexpression of THBS4 in both HCC patients' tissues and cell lines mediates HCC cells proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. In-depth, THBS4 regulated EMT progression and interacted with ITG family to modulate FAK/PI3K/AKT pathway. In conclusion, THBS4 as an oncogene interacts with integrinβ1 (ITGB1) to regulate HCC development via FAK/PI3K/AKT pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3035963767,"Social hierarchies are ubiquitous and determine a range of developmental outcomes, yet little is known about when children develop beliefs about status hierarchies in their communities. The present studies (3.5-6.9 years; N = 420) found that children begin to use gender and race as cues to status in early childhood, but that gender and race related to different status dimensions and had different consequences for inter-group attitudes. Children expected boys to hold higher status as defined by access to resources and decision-making power (e.g., having more toys and choosing what other people play with) but did not expect boys to have more wealth overall. Gender-related status beliefs did not relate to gender-related social preferences; instead, children preferred members of their own gender, regardless of their status beliefs. In contrast, children expected White people to be wealthier than Black people, and among some populations of children, the belief that White people were higher status (as defined by access to resources and decision-making power) weakly related to pro-White bias. Children's status-expectations about others were unrelated to beliefs about their own status, suggesting children more readily apply category-based status beliefs to others than to themselves."
https://openalex.org/W3035963050,"Melanoma is a deadly form of skin cancer that accounts for a disproportionally large proportion of cancer-related deaths in younger people. Compared with most other skin cancers, a feature of melanoma is its high metastatic capacity, although the mechanisms that confer this are not well understood. The Hippo pathway is a key regulator of organ growth and cell fate that is deregulated in many cancers. To analyse the Hippo pathway in cutaneous melanoma, we generated a transcriptional signature of melanoma cells that overexpressed YAP, the key downstream Hippo pathway oncoprotein. YAP-mediated transcriptional activity varied in melanoma cell lines but did not cluster with known genetic drivers of melanomagenesis such as BRAF and NRAS mutations. Instead, it correlated strongly with published gene expression profiles linked to melanoma cell invasiveness and varied throughout the metastatic cascade in melanoma patient tumours. Consistent with this, YAP was both necessary and sufficient for melanoma cell invasion in vitro. In vivo, YAP promoted spontaneous melanoma metastasis, whilst the growth of YAP-expressing primary tumours was impeded. Finally, we identified the YAP target genes AXL, THBS1 and CYR61 as key mediators of YAP-induced melanoma cell invasion. These data suggest that YAP is a critical regulator of melanoma metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W3036517800,"Tea polyphenolics have been suggested to possess blood glucose lowering properties by inhibiting sugar transporters in the small intestine and improving insulin sensitivity. In this report, we studied the effects of teas and tea catechins on the small intestinal sugar transporters, SGLT1 and GLUTs (GLUT1, 2 and 5). Green tea extract (GT), oolong tea extract (OT), and black tea extract (BT) inhibited glucose uptake into the intestinal Caco-2 cells with GT being the most potent inhibitor (IC50: 0.077 mg/mL), followed by OT (IC50: 0.136 mg/mL) and BT (IC50: 0.56 mg/mL). GT and OT inhibition of glucose uptake was partial non-competitive, with an inhibitor constant (Ki) = 0.0317 and 0.0571 mg/mL, respectively, whereas BT was pure non-competitive, Ki = 0.36 mg/mL. Oocytes injected to express small intestinal GLUTs were inhibited by teas, but SGLT1 was not. Furthermore, catechins present in teas were the predominant inhibitor of glucose uptake into Caco-2 cells, and gallated catechins the most potent: CG > ECG > EGCG ≥ GCG when compared to the non-gallated catechins (C, EC, GC, and EGC). In Caco-2 cells, individual tea catechins reduced the SGLT1 gene, but not protein expression levels. In contrast, GLUT2 gene and protein expression levels were reduced after 2 hours exposure to catechins but increased after 24 hours. These in vitro studies suggest teas containing catechins may be useful dietary supplements capable of blunting postprandial glycaemia in humans, including those with or at risk to Type 2 diabetes mellitus."
https://openalex.org/W3035917756,"Abstract Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare and aggressive malignancy with limited therapeutic options. The lack of mouse models that recapitulate the genetics of ACC has hampered progress in the field. We analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset for ACC and found that patients harboring alterations in both p53/Rb and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways show a worse prognosis compared with patients that harbored alterations in only one. To model this, we utilized the Cyp11b2(AS) Cre mouse line to generate mice with adrenocortical-specific Wnt/β-catenin activation, Trp53 deletion, or the combination of both. Mice with targeted Wnt/β-catenin activation or Trp53 deletion showed no changes associated with tumor formation. In contrast, alterations in both pathways led to ACC with pulmonary metastases. Similar to ACCs in humans, these tumors produced increased levels of corticosterone and aldosterone and showed a high proliferation index. Gene expression analysis revealed that mouse tumors exhibited downregulation of Star and Cyp11b1 and upregulation of Ezh2 , similar to ACC patients with a poor prognosis. Altogether, these data show that altering both Wnt/β-catenin and p53/Rb signaling is sufficient to drive ACC in mouse. This autochthonous model of ACC represents a new tool to investigate the biology of ACC and to identify new treatment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3036509289,"RNA viruses are a major human health threat. The life cycles of many highly pathogenic RNA viruses like influenza A virus (IAV) and Lassa virus depends on host mRNA, because viral polymerases cleave 5'-m7G-capped host transcripts to prime viral mRNA synthesis (""cap-snatching""). We hypothesized that start codons within cap-snatched host transcripts could generate chimeric human-viral mRNAs with coding potential. We report the existence of this mechanism of gene origination, which we named ""start-snatching."" Depending on the reading frame, start-snatching allows the translation of host and viral ""untranslated regions"" (UTRs) to create N-terminally extended viral proteins or entirely novel polypeptides by genetic overprinting. We show that both types of chimeric proteins are made in IAV-infected cells, generate T cell responses, and contribute to virulence. Our results indicate that during infection with IAV, and likely a multitude of other human, animal and plant viruses, a host-dependent mechanism allows the genesis of hybrid genes."
https://openalex.org/W3036426732,"We investigated the association of multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with athlete status and power/speed performance in elite male youth soccer players (ESP) and control participants (CON) at different stages of maturity. ESP (n = 535; aged 8-23 years) and CON (n = 151; aged 9-26 years) were genotyped for 10 SNPs and grouped according to years from predicted peak-height-velocity (PHV), i.e. pre- or post-PHV, to determine maturity status. Participants performed bilateral vertical countermovement jumps, bilateral horizontal-forward countermovement jumps, 20m sprints and modified 505-agility tests. Compared to CON, pre-PHV ESP demonstrated a higher ACTN3 (rs1815739) XX ('endurance') genotype frequency distribution, while post-PHV ESP revealed a higher frequency distribution of the PPARA (rs4253778) C-allele, AGT (rs699) GG genotype and NOS3 (rs2070744) T-allele ('power' genotypes/alleles). BDNF (rs6265) CC, COL5A1 (rs12722) CC and NOS3 TT homozygotes sprinted quicker than A-allele carriers, CT heterozygotes and CC homozygotes, respectively. COL2A1 (rs2070739) CC and AMPD1 (rs17602729) GG homozygotes sprinted faster than their respective minor allele carrier counterparts in CON and pre-PHV ESP, respectively. BDNF CC homozygotes jumped further than T-allele carriers, while ESP COL5A1 CC homozygotes jumped higher than TT homozygotes. To conclude, we have shown for the first time that pre- and post-PHV ESP have distinct genetic profiles, with pre-PHV ESP more suited for endurance, and post-PHV ESP for power and speed (the latter phenotypes being crucial attributes for post-PHV ESP). We have also demonstrated that power, acceleration and sprint performance were associated with five SNPs, both individually and in combination, possibly by influencing muscle size and neuromuscular activation."

Midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons mediate a large spectrum of complex behaviors and have been linked to various brain diseases, including schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease (PD) (Björklund and Dunnett, 2007Björklund A.

Historically, the mDA system is subdivided into three anatomically distinct main nuclei: the substantia nigra (SN) pars compacta (SNc; A9), the ventral tegmental area (VTA; A10), and the retrorubral field (RRF; A8) (Björklund and Dunnett, 2007Björklund A.

Commun. 2019; 10: 581Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, how distinct subtypes of mDA neurons develop to establish functional brain nuclei and circuits remains poorly understood. During development, mDA neurons differentiate from progenitor cells in the midbrain ventricular zone (VZ) (Arenas et al., 2015Arenas E. Denham M. Villaescusa J.C. How to make a midbrain dopaminergic neuron.Development. 2015; 142: 1918-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). From embryonic day (E) 10.5 onward, SNc and VTA mDA neurons undergo radial migration from the VZ into the mouse ventral midbrain. This is generally followed by lateral tangential migration of SNc mDA neurons between E13.5 and E15.5 (Bodea et al., 2014Bodea G.O. Spille J.-H. Abe P. Andersson A.S. Acker-Palmer A. Stumm R. Kubitscheck U. Blaess S. Reelin and CXCL12 regulate distinct migratory behaviors during the development of the dopaminergic system.Development. 2014; 141: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The extracellular environment through which mDA neurons migrate is exquisitely complex and composed of a myriad of cellular structures, such as axons and other neurons, all of which may provide molecular guidance. Though radial glial cells (RGCs) likely play a role in mDA neuron migration, the contribution of other cell types and the precise molecular signals involved are unknown (Marchand and Poirier, 1983Marchand R. Poirier L.J. Isthmic origin of neurons of the rat substantia nigra.Neuroscience. 1983; 9: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, Kawano et al., 1995Kawano H. Ohyama K. Kawamura K.

Correct setup of the substantia nigra requires Reelin-mediated fast, laterally-directed migration of dopaminergic neurons.eLife. 2019; 8: e41623Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This is partly caused by the heterogeneous nature of the mDA system. Different mDA neuron subtypes may require distinct molecular programs for their development. The ability to genetically label mDA subtypes is critical for further defining their developmental programs and functions. For example, recent work applies intersectional genetic approaches to map the axonal projections of different mDA neuron subtypes in adult mice (Poulin et al., 2018Poulin J.-F. Caronia G. Hofer C. Cui Q. Helm B. Ramakrishnan C. Chan C.S. Dombeck D.A. Deisseroth K. Awatramani R. Mapping projections of molecularly defined dopamine neuron subtypes using intersectional genetic approaches.Nat. Neurosci. 2018; 21: 1260-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, approaches for studying the development of mDA neuron subtypes are lacking. Here, we generate an intersectional genetic platform, Pitx3-ITC, to provide a unique quantitative view of the three-dimensional (3D) migratory path of SNc mDA neurons. Furthermore, we implicate the guidance molecule Netrin-1 in different aspects of SNc mDA neuron migration and positioning. We show that Netrin-1 derived from midbrain RGCs facilitates the dorso-ventral migration of a subset of dorsal SNc mDA neurons expressing the Netrin-1 receptor deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC). Netrin-1 also instructs the ventral migration of a population of Six3+ γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAergic) neurons into the SN pars reticulata (SNr) that indirectly acts to restrict ventral SN mDA neurons to the SNc. Intriguingly, GABAergic neuron migration into the SNr requires Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (DSCAM), but not DCC, and depends on Netrin-1 provided by axons that originate from neurons in the forebrain and traverse the ventral midbrain at the time of GABAergic neuron migration. Therefore, a remotely produced and axonally expressed secreted guidance molecule can instruct neuron migration, a principle that is likely to apply more generally. How molecularly and functionally distinct mDA neuron subtypes develop is a key unresolved question. Our findings begin to address this issue by unveiling cellular events and molecular cues that instruct the development and functional organization of mDA neuron subtypes in the SN and by providing a unique genetic platform for further interrogation of mDA neuron subtypes in physiological and disease states. To label subtypes of mDA neurons in a single mouse, we generated a construct that combines the Cre/loxP and Flp/frt systems with genes encoding fluorescent proteins (infrared fluorescent protein (IFP), tdTomato, and citrine) (ITC; Figure 1A). Each gene is followed by a stop signal that prevents expression of the next gene. Transfection of ITC into HEK293 cells resulted in IFP expression. Co-transfection with constructs encoding iCre or Flpo recombinases resulted in selective expression of tdTomato or citrine, respectively. Co-transfection with iCre and Flpo induced citrine expression (Figure 1B). Next, the ITC cassette was inserted into a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) downstream of the Pitx3 promoter to restrict ITC expression to mDA neurons. Pitx3 labels these neurons from E11.5 onward (Smidt et al., 1997Smidt M.P. van Schaick H.S. Lanctôt C. Tremblay J.J. Cox J.J. van der Kleij A.A. Wolterink G. Drouin J. Burbach J.P. A homeodomain gene Ptx3 has highly restricted brain expression in mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 13305-13310Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Pronuclear injection of the modified BAC resulted in three founder mouse lines. To assess the Cre and Flp-dependent labeling of mDA neurons in these mice, they were crossed with EIIa-Cre or ACTB-Flpe mice, which ubiquitously express Cre or Flp. Immunohistochemistry for tdTomato, citrine, and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a marker for mDA neurons, revealed labeling of lateral, but not medial, mDA neurons in adult EIIa-Cre:Pitx3-ITC and ACTB-Flpe:Pitx3-ITC mice (Figures 1C, S1A, and S1B). Different founders displayed comparable labeling patterns, but the number of citrine+ neurons varied among founders. For subsequent analyses, we focused on ACTB-Flpe:Pitx3-ITC (founder 2) mice. Quantification of citrine and TH co-localization confirmed that Pitx3-ITC specifically labels mDA neurons (98% and 100% of citrine+ neurons expressed TH at E18.5 and in adulthood, respectively). Furthermore, double immunolabeling with markers for SNc (Sox6) and VTA (Otx2) mDA neurons revealed that Pitx3-ITC marks SNc mDA neurons (Figure S1D) (Di Salvio et al., 2010Di Salvio M.

Interestingly, citrine labeling was largely restricted to the ventral SNc, which expresses LMO3 and Aldh1a1 (Figures S1E and S1F) (Poulin et al., 2014Poulin J.-F. Zou J. Drouin-Ouellet J. Kim K.-Y.A.

Labeling of citrine+ axons in the striatum was confined to its dorsal part, a known synaptic target of ventral SNc mDA neurons (Figure 1D). Two brain regions consistently displayed citrine+/TH− cells: dorso-caudal midbrain (>E12.5) and rostral cortex (>P10); this was in line with previous observations in Pitx3-Cre mice (Smidt et al., 2012Smidt M.P. von Oerthel L. Hoekstra E.J. Schellevis R.D. Hoekman M.F.M. Spatial and temporal lineage analysis of a Pitx3-driven Cre-recombinase knock-in mouse model.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e42641Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These regions do not innervate target regions of mDA neurons, such as the striatum (Figures S2A and S2B). Thus, Pitx3-ITC mice are a unique tool for visualization of SNc mDA neurons in vivo. The connectivity patterns of mDA neuron subtypes differ dramatically and include elaboration of distinct dendritic fields and target innervation patterns. The cellular and molecular bases of these differences are unknown because of the lack of tools that robustly label developing mDA neuron subtypes at single-cell resolution. Therefore, we explored whether Pitx3-ITC mice could be used as an intersectional genetic tool to sparsely label SNc mDA neurons. To identify molecular markers for mDA subtypes, we used the Anatomic Gene Expression Atlas (AGEA) and Gene Finder tools of the Allen Brain Atlas (Figure S2C). Expression of neuropilin-2 (Nrp2) was interesting, because it broadly labels the VTA and more sparsely labels the SNc (Figure S2D) (Kolk et al., 2009Kolk S.M. Gunput R.-A.F.

Therefore, a Nrp2-Flpo mouse line was generated using BAC transgenesis and crossed with a Flp-dependent EGFP reporter (R26ZG) (Figures S2E and S2F) or Pitx3-ITC mice. Analysis of adult Nrp2-Flpo:R26ZG brains revealed many GFP+/TH+ and GFP+/TH− neurons in the VTA and only a few in the SNc (Figure S2E). In addition, GFP+/TH− neurons were observed in other brain regions (Figure S2F). In contrast, in adult Nrp2-Flpo:Pitx3-ITC mice, citrine expression in the brain was restricted to only a few (1–5) SNc mDA neurons (Figures 1E and S2G). Different types of neurons could be identified with pyramidal or fusiform shapes that projected their dendrites in the SNc, SNr, or both (Figure 1E). mDA neurons innervating the dorsal striatum extensively arborize their axons within their target (Matsuda et al., 2009Matsuda W. Furuta T. Nakamura K.C. Hioki H. Fujiyama F. Arai R. Kaneko T. Single nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons form widely spread and highly dense axonal arborizations in the neostriatum.J.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7247-7260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In line with this observation, in Nrp2-Flpo:Pitx3-ITC mice, citrine+ axons formed localized, dense patches along the rostro-caudal axis of the dorsal striatum (Figure 1F). Thus, Pitx3-ITC mice are a useful intersectional genetic tool to study SNc mDA neuron morphology and development at single-cell resolution. SNc mDA neurons migrate from the VZ of the midbrain to their final ventro-lateral position using radial and tangential migration modes (Figure 2A). Pitx3-ITC mice not only facilitate analysis of SNc mDA neuron morphology but also allow for assessment of their migration. To visualize the migratory path of SNc mDA neurons in 3D along the medio-lateral, dorso-ventral, and caudo-rostral axes of the midbrain, we subjected E13.5 and post-natal day 0 (P0) ACTB-Flpe:Pitx3-ITC brains to whole-mount immunohistochemistry, 3D imaging of solvent-cleared organ (3DISCO) tissue clearing, and fluorescent light sheet microscopy (FLSM) (Belle et al., 2014Belle M. Godefroy D. Dominici C. Heitz-Marchaland C. Zelina P. Hellal F. Bradke F. Chédotal A. A simple method for 3D analysis of immunolabeled axonal tracts in a transparent nervous system.Cell Rep. 2014; 9: 1191-1201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). E13.5 represents an initial stage of mDA neuron migration, whereas at P0, mDA neurons have reached the SN. We used TH immunostaining to delineate the mDA system in 3D and assigned citrine+ SNc mDA neurons to different bins within the TH+ mask (Figures 2B, S3A, and S3B; Videos S1 and S2). Quantification of the number of citrine+ neurons revealed an increase in neuron number in more lateral and ventral bins at P0 compared with E13.5 (Figure 2C), confirming that SNc mDA neurons migrate in dorso-ventral and medio-lateral directions (Bodea et al., 2014Bodea G.O. Spille J.-H. Abe P. Andersson A.S. Acker-Palmer A. Stumm R. Kubitscheck U. Blaess S.

Correct setup of the substantia nigra requires Reelin-mediated fast, laterally-directed migration of dopaminergic neurons.eLife. 2019; 8: e41623Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In addition, whereas at E13.5 citrine+ neurons were detected along the entire caudo-rostral extent of the TH+ region, at P0 neurons were restricted to rostral bins (Figures 2C and S3C). Because these results indicated the occurrence of poorly defined SNc mDA neuron caudo-rostral migration, we analyzed the leading processes of these neurons in horizontal sections. This revealed that at E13.5, but not P0, the processes of citrine+ neurons were oriented in a medio-caudal to rostro-lateral direction, suggesting caudo-rostral migration (Figure 2D). Altogether, these data highlight a novel method to quantitatively assess mDA neuron migration in 3D and show that SNc mDA neurons can migrate along the caudo-rostral axis. eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJiMzUyZDM2ZjhmYTdlOTE5OWNkMTY0NGRkYWZhYmI0YSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjM4NDUyMjE2fQ.gYXo1VD8zjJNUFsZi86kTcNNYdEqCbM1NFMZyQE5VAXvYEfPyqrGxfw81TJmYZtTzF6zbJYlx6XSLPq3K-LutfsB_SL6TgQsxuX5aWCl2NXW0b-Jfj42MNWEM7kaUKfv83VCZiGXyIpHn_YxQIPaxtbD9ca3Sln7u-oayGOLFsyqqTNNTR1OwVTi8Hi2kEeCEbQ7lPYUtFPP-e11nkNyuGUVDPv91FobmzEquol6I8dYcyxCLrQm75c2jDv7V64tK6BQITzK4dsC2U_8tfl2DHB5aE1LqW8Wo4aOrjmgLVQhnH6jTa5oMg21LRUQ2IMb2xFXgvnJBmrRrYIQ5WrFEA Download .mp4 (8.4 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S1.

The TH+ mask was divided into 8 bins of equal size along the medio-lateral, dorso-ventral, and caudo-rostral axes (colored dots in different bins). The molecular mechanisms that direct SNc mDA neuron migration are incompletely understood (Brignani and Pasterkamp, 2017Brignani S. Pasterkamp R.J. Neuronal Subset-Specific Migration and Axonal Wiring Mechanisms in the Developing Midbrain Dopamine System.Front. Neuroanat. 2017; 11: 55Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To identify molecular cues for migrating mDA neurons, the embryonic ventral midbrain of E16.5 Pitx3-GFP mice was subjected to laser-capture microdissection coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) (Schmidt et al., 2014Schmidt E.R.E. Brignani S. Adolfs Y. Lemstra S. Demmers J. Vidaki M. Donahoo A.S. Lilleväli K. Vasar E.

The medial, ventro-lateral, and dorso-lateral parts of the GFP+ mDA system were microdissected (Figure 2E), and subsequent MS analysis revealed differential protein expression (Table S1). We focused on guidance cues and receptors, because these molecules play prominent roles in neuron migration (Figure 2F). Plexin (Plxn) A1, PlxnA2, PlxnA4, EphB1 and EphB2 were excluded from further analysis, because these receptors were found to be expressed ubiquitously, at low levels, or in other cell types (Figure S3D) (Torre et al., 2010Torre E.R. Gutekunst C.-A. Gross R.E. Expression by midbrain dopamine neurons of Sema3A and 3F receptors is associated with chemorepulsion in vitro but a mild in vivo phenotype.Mol. Cell.

EphB1 null mice exhibit neuronal loss in substantia nigra pars reticulata and spontaneous locomotor hyperactivity.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2007; 25: 2619-2628Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We confirmed enrichment of PlxnB2 at E16.5 (Figure S3E) and analyzed E16.5 and P5 Nestin-Cre:PlxnB2fl/fl mice. Neural-specific deletion of PlxnB2 did not result in ectopically located mDA neurons or in obvious changes in the organization of the SN and VTA (Figures S3F and S3G). Netrin-1 and DCC were interesting candidates, because both were enriched in ventro-lateral SN samples and are known to regulate cell migration (Lai Wing Sun et al., 2011Lai Wing Sun K. Correia J.P. Kennedy T.E. Netrins: versatile extracellular cues with diverse functions.Development. 2011; 138: 2153-2169Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Strong Netrin-1 expression was found in the E12.5 VZ, where RGC bodies and mDA progenitors reside. At E14.5 and E16.5, the VZ and differentiated mDA neurons in the midbrain expressed Netrin-1 (Figure 2G). Netrin-1 protein was expressed at the midline and ventral to the SNc, explaining its enrichment in ventro-lateral MS samples (Figure 2H). To examine a potential role for Netrin-1 in SNc mDA neuron migration, E18.5 Netrin-1−/− mice were analyzed using TH immunohistochemistry and FLSM. This revealed flattening of the VTA, aberrant mDA neurons in the red nucleus (RN), and ventro-laterally misplaced neurons in the rostral midbrain in Netrin-1−/− mice (Figures 3A and 3B ; Video S3). 3D analysis of E18.5 ACTB-Flpe:Pitx3-ITC:Netrin-1−/− mice confirmed that the ventro-laterally shifted neurons were citrine+ SNc mDA neurons. No change in the caudo-rostral position of citrine+ neurons was observed (Figures 3C, 3D, and S3H). To further characterize these migration defects, double immunohistochemistry was performed on tissue sections, revealing ectopic TH+ mDA neurons in the RN of E18.5 ACTB-Flpe:Pitx3-ITC:Netrin-1−/− mice. Most of these dorsally misplaced neurons expressed Sox6, but not Aldh1a1 or Otx2. Furthermore, most of these TH+ neurons did not express citrine, a marker of ventral SNc (Figures 3E–3G and S4A–S4H). Quantification revealed that 3.3% ± 0.18% of all TH+/Sox6+ neurons were ectopically located in the RN of Netrin-1−/− mice. Thus, a small subset of mDA neurons that normally populates the dorsal SNc fails to migrate ventrally through the RN in the absence of Netrin-1. eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJiODc2YjM1ZWE0ZjQ0ZmU4NTEwOTg2MTJmYzFiZDY0MiIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjM4NDUyMjE2fQ.FLjoWWNh7YdtDkH3RAJmDFzF_2kd8T-fD0Ltnn-PGxHHdBSGhJe5OX61KJmSnWte349FPkJGdJ9-lCh9Ev0MwPytsahhUJ2zdsB6wselbvuz-9yZvggetk18TKKhbdsbdiqWp_LL85qeOKTpQTjTdBgey3ytz1xGAxFxGfe38lrvaT5_wbX-mYsXyhlsjqXxb-ccXLAQjOUhXWzxVS1iJMQj7dpnOjMDaZT3HgdDotUgOFL17FCKN1EPNxZDuRZUVfZfoz0KVQWcx4JLbYFs4XCtE5LhnD2ng0X4pApj0_7jTjQLB6jlG9shF1yO4CVTPoXUz0SfUgzZkN280S24aQ Download .mp4 (30.36 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S3.

Reasoning that the computational advantage of such redundancy should be reflected in differences in how these structures represent information, we compared the coding properties of PL and amygdala neurons during a task that requires rats to produce different conditioned defensive or appetitive behaviors. Rather than unambiguous regional differences in the identities of the variables encoded, we found gradients in how the same variables are represented. Whereas PL and BL neurons represented many different parameters through minor variations in firing rates, LA cells coded fewer task features with stronger changes in activity. At the population level, whereas valence could be easily distinguished from amygdala activity, PL neurons could distinguish both valence and trial identity as well as or better than amygdala neurons. Thus, PL has greater representational capacity."

Moreover, the organization of photosynthetic proteins in the thylakoid membranes is dynamically modulated according to light conditions. In vascular plants, a unique architecture called a semi-crystalline photosystem II (PSII) array is formed by PSII and light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) supercomplexes under low-light (LL) conditions, whereas the monomeric forms of PSII–LHCII supercomplexes are predominant under high-light (HL) conditions (5Simpson D.J.

Amphipols are amphipathic polymers that can be used as substitutes for detergents at the transmembrane surface of membrane proteins and thereby keep them soluble in detergent-free aqueous solutions (17Tribet C. Audebert R. Popot J.-L. Amphipols: Polymers that keep membrane proteins soluble in aqueous solutions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The most extensively studied and widely used APol, A8-35, is comprised of a mixture of short amphipathic polymers with a polyacrylate backbone onto which two kinds of side chain have been randomly grafted: ∼25% of its units carry an octylamide side chain, ∼40% an isopropylamide one, and ∼35% an underivatized carboxylate (18Popot J.-L. Membrane Proteins in Aqueous Solutions: From Detergents to Amphipols. Springer, Cham, Switzerland2018Crossref Google Scholar). Previously, we developed a procedure for purifying the PSII–LHCII supercomplex of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii employing A8-35 (19Watanabe A. Kim E. Burton-Smith R.N. Tokutsu R. Minagawa J. Amphipol-assisted purification method for the highly active and stable photosystem II supercomplex of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.FEBS Lett. 2019; 593 (31017655): 1072-107910.1002/1873-3468.13394Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Because the obtained complex, in which the detergent dodecyl-α-d-maltoside (α-DDM) used for its solubilization were replaced by A8-35, became much more stable (19Watanabe A. Kim E. Burton-Smith R.N. Tokutsu R. Minagawa J. Amphipol-assisted purification method for the highly active and stable photosystem II supercomplex of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.FEBS Lett. 2019; 593 (31017655): 1072-107910.1002/1873-3468.13394Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), this A8-35-substituted preparation was successfully used to determine the structure by cryo-electron microscope (20Sheng X. Watanabe A. Li A. Kim E. Song C. Murata K. Song D. Minagawa J. Liu Z. Structural insight into light harvesting for photosystem II in green algae.Nat. Plants. 2019; 5 (31768031): 1320-133010.1038/s41477-019-0543-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) or the binding properties of the peripheral LHCII subunits (21Kim E. Watanabe A. Sato R. Okajima K. Minagawa J. pH-responsive binding properties of light-harvesting complexes in a photosystem II supercomplex investigated by thermodynamic dissociation kinetics analysis.J. Phys. Chem.

Herein, we prepared PSII–LHCII supercomplexes from spinach leaves in their monomeric and multimeric forms in the presence of A8-35. Single-particle EM determined that the multimeric PSII–LHCII supercomplex, which was only identified in the LL-acclimated leaves, was composed of two or three units of PSII–LHCII supercomplexes like a fraction of the semicrystalline array. It has a higher light-harvesting capability but a lower thermal dissipation capability than the monomeric form. We discuss possible implications of these results with respect to the functional role of the semi-crystalline array during environmental acclimation. We first isolated multimeric PSII–LHCII supercomplexes from LL-adapted spinach leaves. The thylakoid membranes were initially solubilized by α-DDM and applied to sucrose density gradient (SDG) ultracentrifugation in the presence of A8-35, which stabilized solubilized membrane protein complexes against thermodynamic dissociation (19Watanabe A. Kim E. Burton-Smith R.N. Tokutsu R. Minagawa J. Amphipol-assisted purification method for the highly active and stable photosystem II supercomplex of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.FEBS Lett. 2019; 593 (31017655): 1072-107910.1002/1873-3468.13394Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), resulting in five green bands (Fig. 1A). Based on analysis by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B), the top three bands including A1, A2, and A3 were identified as free LHC proteins, PSI–LHCI supercomplexes/ATPases and PSII–LHCII supercomplexes, respectively. Although these three bands correspond to the bands previously observed in the study using a green alga C. reinhardtii, there were two additional bands present in the lower part (A4 and A5) (Fig. 1A). Because the polypeptide compositions in A4 and A5 were essentially identical to that of A3 (Fig. 1B), we presumed that the A4 and A5 bands corresponded to multimers of PSII–LHCII supercomplexes. Interestingly, the lower two bands (A4 and A5 bands) were not detected in the sample prepared from the HL-treated leaves, whereas the upper three bands (A1, A2 and A3) stayed the same (Fig. 1A), suggesting that the putative multimeric PSII–LHCII supercomplexes (A4 and A5) were only present in the leaves acclimated to LL conditions. The LL-dependent formation of the possible multimeric forms of PSII–LHCII supercomplexes was reminiscent of the formation of semi-crystalline PSII arrays observed in LL-adapted leaves (6Kirchhoff H. Haase W. Wegner S. Danielsson R. Ackermann R. Albertsson P.A. Low-light-induced formation of semicrystalline photosystem II arrays in higher plant chloroplast.Biochemistry. 2007; 46 (17845010): 11169-1117610.1021/bi700748yCrossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). PSII configurations in A3, A4, and A5 bands were characterized by single-particle analysis of EM of negatively stained particles (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1). As expected from the polypeptide compositions, the A3 band was composed of monomers of PSII–LHCII supercomplexes, whereas the A4 and A5 bands were composed of multimers of PSII–LHCII supercomplexes. Four classes of monomeric PSII–LHCII supercomplexes were observed in the A3 band (Fig. S2). Ten classes of PSII–LHCII supercomplex pairs were observed in the A4 band (Fig. S3), which has been reported as “PSII–LHCII megacomplexes” in the literature (22Nosek L. Semchonok D. Boekema E.J. Ilík P. Kouřil R. Structural variability of plant photosystem II megacomplexes in thylakoid membranes.Plant J. 2017; 89 (27598242): 104-11110.1111/tpj.13325Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Twelve classes of an array of three PSII–LHCII supercomplex units were observed in the A5 band (Fig. S4), which has never been reported before (hereafter referred to as “PSII–LHCII arraycomplexes”). In other literature, similar bands to the A4 and A5 bands have been isolated by using α-DDM, and these bands were identified as (C2S2)4 and (C2S2M2)2 formed by “sandwiched” PSII–LHCII supercomplexes (23Albanese P.

Watanabe A. Li A. Kim E. Song C. Murata K. Song D. Minagawa J. Liu Z. Structural insight into light harvesting for photosystem II in green algae.Nat.

In the A3 band, a C2S2M1-type PSII–LHCII supercomplex composed of a core dimer complexes (C2) with two strongly bound LHCII trimers (S2) and one moderately bound LHCII trimer (M1) was dominant (50%), which was consistent with the previous report in spinach (26Boekema E.J. van Breemen J.F.L. van Roon H. Dekker J.P. Arrangement of photosystem II supercomplexes in crystalline macrodomains within the thylakoid membrane of green plant chloroplasts.J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301 (10966810): 1123-113310.1006/jmbi.2000.4037Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The configuration of the PSII–LHCII megacomplexes in the A4 band here is similar to the previously reported PSII–LHCII megacomplexes from Arabidopsis thaliana (23Albanese P. Nield J. Tabares J.A.M. Chiodoni A. Manfredi M. Gosetti F. Marengo E. Saracco G. Barber J. Pagliano C.

Res. 2016; 130 (26749480): 19-3110.1007/s11120-016-0216-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the A5 band, PSII–LHCII arraycomplexes form various types of alignments much as like the sections in a semi-crystalline array (26Boekema E.J. van Breemen J.F.L. van Roon H. Dekker J.P. Arrangement of photosystem II supercomplexes in crystalline macrodomains within the thylakoid membrane of green plant chloroplasts.J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301 (10966810): 1123-113310.1006/jmbi.2000.4037Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) (Fig. S5), suggesting the possibility that the A4 and A5 bands were fractions of a larger, semi-crystalline PSII array. To characterize optical properties and pigment composition, we obtained the absorption spectrum of each band (Fig. S6A). Two main peaks at ∼435 and ∼675 nm originated from Chl a, the shoulder ∼650 nm originated from Chl b and the shoulder at ∼475 nm originated from both Chl b and Car. Thus, higher absorption at 475 nm but similar absorption level at 650 nm in the A4 and A5 bands than that in the A3 band represents the larger contributions of Car. This result is consistent with the pigment analysis using ultra-performance liquid chromatography (Table S1), showing that A4 and A5 have higher Car content (Lut, Vio, and neoxanthin) per Chl a than the A3 band. Another feature of A4 and A5 is that it has a red-shifted peak at ∼676 nm compared with A3. This is most likely due to contamination by PSI because PSI shows a red-shifted absorption peak at 679.5 nm. This was supported by immunoblotting analysis of the amount of PsaA, in which the A4 and A5 bands contained 29 and 20% more PSI per PSII (D1) than the A3 band (Fig. S7). To further characterize the PSII–LHCII supercomplexes, we thus adopt Chl fluorescence measurements at room temperature because most of fluorescence comes from PSII at room temperature (Fig. S6B) (27Papageorgiou G.C. Govindjee Chlorophyll a Fluorescence: A Signature of Photosynthesis. Springer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2007Google Scholar). To assess the photoprotection capabilities, we analyzed quenching properties of A3, A4, and A5 by comparing Chl fluorescence decay at neutral (pH 7.5) and acidic pH (pH 5.5). NPQcalc (28Kosuge K. Tokutsu R. Kim E. Akimoto S. Yokono M. Ueno Y. Minagawa J. LHCSR1-dependent fluorescence quenching is mediated by excitation energy transfer from LHCII to photosystem I in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2018; 115 (29555769): 3722-372710.1073/pnas.1720574115Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) was derived from fluorescence lifetimes of the non-quenching form (at pH 7.5) and the quenching form (at pH 5.5) and was used as a Stern–Volmer type NPQ parameter. As shown in Fig. 2A, the fluorescence lifetime of A3 was shorter than A4 and A5 when they were at acidic pH. NPQcalc of A3 was 0.79, whereas those of A4 and A5 were 0.22 and 0.27, respectively (Table 1), suggesting that the monomeric PSII–LHCII supercomplexes had a much higher qE capability than the multimeric PSII–LHCII supercomplexes when in the low pH. To identify the origin of the higher qE capability in the monomeric PSII–LHCII supercomplexes, the amount of PsbS was compared because it has been reported that the PsbS could contribute to qE by associating with PSII–LHCII supercomplexes (29Correa-Galvis V. Poschmann G. Melzer M. Stuhler K. Jahns P. PsbS interactions involved in the activation of energy dissipation in Arabidopsis.Nat.

The amount of PsbS per PSII core complex (D1) was comparable in all three samples (Fig. S7), indicating that the elevated quenching capability in A3 was independent of the amount of PsbS. On the contrary, more Car was bound per Chl a to A4 and A5 than A3 (Table 1). A4 and A5 possessed 5 and 16% more Lut, and 13 and 24% more Vio per Chl a than A3, respectively. Because we analyzed the leaves adapted to LL conditions, Zea was not detected in all samples, suggesting that the elevated quenching capability of A3 here was independent of Zea. These results indicate that the higher qE capability in A3 was not due to the amount of PsbS nor Car but could be due to conformational changes caused by monomerization of PSII–LHCII supercomplexes such as changes in the orientations of Chl(s) or Car(s). It has actually been reported that conformational changes by protein–protein interactions can activate qE process (13Ruban A.V. Berera R. Ilioaia C. van Stokkum I.H. Kennis J.T.

Open table in a new tab The light-harvesting capabilities of monomeric and multimeric PSII–LHCII supercomplexes were investigated by fluorescence induction traces upon dark-to-light transition according to the previous method (33Belgio E. Kapitonova E. Chmeliov J. Duffy C.D.P. Ungerer P. Valkunas L. Ruban A.V. Economic photoprotection in photosystem II that retains a complete light-harvesting system with slow energy traps.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 (25014663): 443310.1038/ncomms5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A), which determined the cross-section for PSII excitation (PSII cross-section). Because a heterogenous puddle model yielded a better fit than a homogenous puddle model or a lake model (Fig. S8), the average PSII cross-sections of the three PSII samples were estimated by the heterogenous puddle model and compared in the absence and presence of the qE process (at pH 7.5 and 5.5, respectively). At pH 7.5, A4 and A5 showed 10.0 and 37.6% larger PSII cross-sections than A3, respectively (Fig. 3B). At pH 5.5, however, A4 and A5 showed 53.3 and 80.9% larger PSII cross-sections than A3, respectively (Fig. 3B). Multimerization therefore contributes to an increase the PSII cross-section of the PSII–LHCII supercomplexes. We then examined whether the larger PSII cross-sections in A4 and A5 were due to larger physical antenna size or higher light-harvesting efficiency (energy transfer efficiency from antenna to the core) or both. The physical antenna sizes of the PSII–LHCII supercomplexes in each sample were evaluated based on the result of single-particle analysis by EM (Figs. S5–S7 and Tables S2 and S3). The estimated physical antenna sizes of PSII–LHCII supercomplexes in A4 and A5 were 9 and 14% larger than that in A3 (Table 2). This result is consistent with the lower Chl a/b ratio in A4 and A5 (Table S1), which represents more antenna proteins, even though the PSI contamination in A4 and A5 bands could increase Chl a/b ratio. The light-harvesting efficiencies were deduced by ratios of PSII cross-sections to physical antenna sizes. The results indicate that A4 and A5 have 41 and 59% higher light-harvesting efficiencies than A3 at pH 5.5, respectively, whereas A4 and A5 have 1 and 21% higher light-harvesting efficiencies than A3 at pH 7.5 (Table 2). Therefore, the multimeric formation of PSII–LHCII supercomplexes increases light-harvesting efficiency, as well as physical antenna size. Interestingly, their light-harvesting efficiencies were greatly reduced by monomerization at the acidic pH, which was correlated with the increased level of NPQ capacities, suggesting that the energy transfer from the antenna to the core could be inhibited in the monomerized forms but not in the multimeric forms of the PSII–LHCII supercomplexes.Table 2Physical antenna size and light-harve"

Three studies shed light on why performance feedback fails and how it can be made more effective. In Study 1, managers described recent performance feedback experiences in their work settings. In Studies 2 and 3, pairs of managers role-played a performance review meeting. In all studies, recipients of mixed and negative feedback doubted the accuracy of the feedback and the providers’ qualifications to give it. Disagreement regarding past performance was greater following the feedback discussion than before, due to feedback recipients’ increased self-protective and self-enhancing attributions. Managers were motivated to improve to the extent they perceived the feedback conversation to be focused on future actions rather than on past performance. Our findings have implications for the theory and practice of performance management."

We recently reported primary FSGS patients with IgM and C3 deposition showed unfavorable therapeutic responses and worse renal outcomes. Here we examined the plasma and urinary complement profile of patients with primary FSGS, aiming to investigate the complement participation in FSGS pathogenesis. Methods Seventy patients with biopsy-proven primary FSGS were enrolled. The plasma and urinary levels of C3a, C5a, soluble C5b-9, C4d, C1q, MBL, and Bb were determined by commercial ELISA kits. Results The levels of C3a, C5a and C5b-9 in plasma and urine of FSGS patients were significantly higher than those in normal controls. The plasma and urinary levels of C5b-9 were positively correlated with urinary protein, renal dysfunction and interstitial fibrosis. The plasma C5a levels were positively correlated with the proportion of segmental sclerotic glomeruli. The urinary levels of Bb were elevated, positively correlated with C3a and C5b-9 levels, renal dysfunction, and interstitial fibrosis. The plasma C1q level was significantly decreased, and negatively correlated with urinary protein excretion. Urinary Bb level was a risk factor for no remission (HR = 3.348, 95% CI 1.264–8.870, P = 0.015) and ESRD (HR = 2.323, 95% CI 1.222–4.418, P = 0.010). Conclusion In conclusion, our results identified the systemic activation of complement in human primary FSGS, possibly via the classical and alternative pathway. The activation of complement system was partly associated with the clinical manifestations, kidney pathological damage, and renal outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3035974986,"The androgen receptor (AR) is the major driver of prostate cancer growth and survival. However, almost all patients relapse with castration-resistant disease (CRPC) when treated with anti-androgen therapy. In CRPC, AR is often aberrantly activated independent of androgen. Targeting survival pathways downstream of AR could be a viable strategy to overcome CRPC. Surprisingly, little is known about how AR drives prostate cancer survival. Furthermore, CRPC tumors in which Pten is lost are also resistant to eradication by PI3K inhibitors. We sought to identify the mechanism by which AR drives tumor survival in CRPC to identify ways to overcome resistance to PI3K inhibition. We found that integrins α6β1 and Bnip3 are selectively elevated in CRPC downstream of AR. While integrin α6 promotes survival and is a direct transcriptional target of AR, the ability of AR to induce Bnip3 is dependent on adhesion to laminin and integrin α6β1-dependent nuclear translocation of HIF1α. Integrins α6β1 and Bnip3 were found to promote survival of CRPC cells selectively on laminin through the induction of autophagy and mitophagy. Furthermore, blocking Bnip3 or integrin α6β1 restored sensitivity to PI3K inhibitors in Pten-negative CRPC. We identified an AR driven pathway that cooperates with laminin and hypoxia to drive resistance to PI3K inhibitors. These findings can help explain in part why PI3K inhibitors have failed in clinical trials to overcome AR-dependent CRPC."
https://openalex.org/W3036145748,"We developed and describe a differential scanning calorimetry method for calculating the initial crystallinity, change of crystallinity and crystallinity percentage of amorphous metal alloys as a function of temperature. Using thermodynamic enthalpies of amorphous, crystalline and partially devitrified specimens, our methodology is capable of determining crystallinity percentages as low as a few percent. Moreover, the linear relationship between the set (pre-determined) and calculated crystallinities of experimental samples indicates that there is no need to prepare calibration samples before measuring the crystallinity percentage of target samples. This technique also eliminates the need for expensive in situ accessories, such as those required in electron microscopy. Thus, the technique is highly relevant as a primary technique for characterization of devitrification behavior in amorphous materials."

Elucidating the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying prion propagation may help to develop disease interventions. Cell culture systems for prion propagation have greatly advanced molecular insights into prion biology, but translation of in vitro to in vivo findings is often disappointing. A wider range of cell culture systems might help overcome these shortcomings. Here, we describe an immortalized mouse neuronal astrocyte cell line (C8D1A) that can be infected with murine prions. Both PrPC protein and mRNA levels in astrocytes were comparable with those in neuronal and non-neuronal cell lines permitting persistent prion infection. We challenged astrocytes with three mouse-adapted prion strains (22L, RML, and ME7) and cultured them for six passages. Immunoblotting results revealed that the astrocytes propagated 22L prions well over all six passages, whereas ME7 prions did not replicate, and RML prions replicated only very weakly after five passages. Immunofluorescence analysis indicated similar results for PrPSc. Interestingly, when we used prion conversion activity as a readout in real-time quaking-induced conversion assays with RML-infected cell lysates, we observed a strong signal over all six passages, comparable with that for 22L-infected cells. These data indicate that the C8D1A cell line is permissive to prion infection. Moreover, the propagated prions differed in conversion and proteinase K–resistance levels in these astrocytes. We propose that the C8D1A cell line could be used to decipher prion strain biology.

The presence of PrPSc aggregates in non-neuronal cell populations in prion-infected mice depleted of neuron-specific PrP demonstrates their potential to propagate prions independent of neuronal PrP (18Mallucci G. Dickinson A. Linehan J. Klöhn P.C. Brandner S. Collinge J.

Similarly, the susceptibility of astrocyte-specific hamster PrP expressed in PrP knockout mice to hamster scrapie propagation implies a role for astrocytes in prion propagation and infection (19Raeber A.J.

Differential processing of PrPSc aggregates by different sets of cells in the CNS could be one of the reasons for the heterogeneity observed in prion pathology. Being a different cell lineage from neurons, astrocytes might process PrPSc aggregates differently as compared with neurons. However, the exact role of astrocytes in prion propagation and pathogenesis remains elusive. The establishment of various neuronal cell culture models that allowed stable prion infection strongly advanced prion research, provided an experimental platform for studying the cell biology of prion infection, and was used for devising potential anti-prion strategies (20Butler D.A.

Given the absence of a murine glia-based cell culture model for propagating mouse-adapted prions, we wanted here to characterize an immortalized mouse astrocyte cell line (C8D1A) for its ability to propagate various murine prions (uninfected cells termed C8D and infected cells ScC8D). One of the determining factors for cellular prion propagation is appropriate cell surface expression of PrPC (39Westergard L. Christensen H.M. Harris D.A. The cellular prion protein (PrPC): its physiological function and role in disease.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1772 (17451912): 629-64410.1016/j.bbadis.2007.02.011Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). We therefore compared PrP mRNA and surface PrPC expression with that of other cell lines known to stably propagate mouse-adapted prions (N2a cells, CAD5 cells, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts). We then inoculated C8D astrocytes with the prion strains 22L, RML, and ME7 and monitored them for markers of prion infection (immunoblot for PrPSc, PrPSc immunofluorescence, and prion conversion activity in RT-QuIC) over six passages. Not unexpectedly, astrocytes were not able to sustain persistent infection with all three prion strains but clearly propagated persistent infection with 22L prions as confirmed in all three assays here. Strikingly, astrocytes very differently handled RML prions, with almost no detectable signal in immunoblot and confocal microscopy for PrPSc but pronounced prion conversion activity over all passages as tested here. This demonstrates that this astrocyte cell line is permissive to prion infection (ScC8D cells) but processes prions very differently regarding prion conversion activity and proteinase K (PK) resistance of PrP. To our knowledge, this is the first report for stable prion infection in immortalized mouse astrocytes. This new cell model could help to advance our understanding of prion strain biology in a non-neuronal context. Expression of Prnp gene mRNA determines the amount of PrPC present in any cell type. Therefore, we examined the transcriptional expression of Prnp in an immortalized mouse neuronal astrocyte cell line (C8D1A) and compared it with PrP mRNA expression in neuronal (N2a and CAD5) and non-neuronal (MEF) cell lines commonly used as in vitro prion infection models (20Butler D.A.

PrP mRNA levels in astrocytes were ∼2-fold higher than that of N2a and MEF cells but lower than in CAD5 cells (Fig. 1A). Because cell surface expression of PrPC is required for establishing prion infection in cultured cells, we next determined the expression of cell surface PrPC in C8D astrocytes and compared it with that of N2a, CAD5, and MEF cells. Our flow cytometry data showed that cell surface expression of PrPC in C8D astrocytes was slightly higher than in N2a cells but lower than that of CAD5 cells, although the differences were not statistically significant. Moreover, cell surface expression of non-neuronal MEF cells was significantly lower than that of astrocytes (Fig. 1B). Glial fibrillary acidic protein immunostaining was used to demonstrate the astrocytic cell type (Fig. S1). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the cell surface expression of PrPC aligns well with mRNA expression in all tested cell lines. Cell surface expression of PrPC in C8D astrocytes is comparable with N2a and CAD5 cells, indicating a potential for prion infection. Having found that C8D astrocytes express comparable levels of cell surface PrP, we next challenged them with three different murine prion strains (22L, RML, and ME7). Uninfected brain homogenate (mock) was used as a negative control. All brain homogenates were tested by immunoblotting to ensure the presence and comparable levels of PrPSc (Fig. S2). Astrocytes were passaged six times, and cell lysate aliquots from each passage were analyzed for PK-resistant PrPSc by immunoblotting. As expected, at passage 0, all astrocyte lysates infected with the three prion strains showed prominent PrPSc signals, most likely representing residual inoculum (Fig. 2). In passages 1–6, 22L prion-infected astrocytes (ScC8D) maintained PrPSc in all tested passages, indicative of a persistent prion infection. In contrast, ME7 PrPSc signal was absent in all subsequent passages (Fig. 2 and Fig. S3). Interestingly, RML prion-infected astrocytes were negative in passages 1–5, and only in passage 6 was a faint PrPSc signal found (Fig. 2, high exposure panel). No PrPSc was observed in mock-inoculated C8D astrocytes. These results demonstrate that C8D astrocytes are capable of stably propagating 22L prions. RML prion-infected astrocytes showed PrPSc at a very late passage only, whereas ME7 prion-infected cells did not show any PrPSc propagation. These data indicate selective propagation of some murine prion strains over others within the same astrocyte cell line. To further validate our immunoblot results, we used immunofluorescence microscopy for the detection of PrPSc aggregates in astrocytes. Immunofluorescence analysis involving pretreatment with guanidine salts for epitope retrieval is extensively used for selective detection of PrPSc (42McKinley M.P. Taraboulos A. Kenaga L. Serban D.

Confocal laser scanning revealed the presence of typical puncta like granules of PrPSc aggregates consistently from passage 1–6 in astrocytes infected with the 22L prion strain (Fig. 3). 22L prion-infected astrocytes showed typical perinuclear PrPSc aggregates as described previously (44Veith N.M.

RML-infected astrocytes showed weak immunolabeling at passage 3–5 and almost no immunolabeling at passage 6 (Fig. 3). ME7-infected astrocytes provided weak immunolabeling at early passages (P1 and P2), which was fading with passaging. Taken together, immunolabeling of 22L and ME7 prion-infected C8D astrocytes was in alignment with immunoblotting data. Interestingly, RML-infected astrocytes that started to show PrPSc in passage 6 in immunoblotting lost their PrPSc immunolabeling signal over time with almost no signal at passage 6, which is at odds with immunoblotting data. Finally, we tested C8D astrocytes for prion conversion activity using real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assay. This technique assesses prion amplification by monitoring amyloid formation as measured by increase of thioflavin-T fluorescence activity in real time (46Orrù C.D. Wilham J.M. Vascellari S. Hughson A.G. Caughey B. New generation QuIC assays for prion seeding activity.Prion. 2012; 6 (22421206): 147-15210.4161/pri.19430Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We tested conversion activity of postnuclear lysates of infected astrocytes (22L, RML, or ME7) from P1 to P6. Mock-infected astrocytes from every passage were used as negative control and for calculating the threshold cutoff values. We found that 22L-infected ScC8D astrocytes showed a strong RT-QuIC signature with high RFUs consistently all over the six passages (Fig. 4 and Fig. S4). These results were in accordance with immunoblotting and immunofluorescence data (Figure 2, Figure 3, respectively). Surprisingly, RML prion-infected astrocytes that had shown weak and late PrPSc signals in immunoblotting as well as less PrPSc aggregates in immunofluorescence experiments revealed very high prion conversion activity in RT-QuIC in all six passages, with five of them becoming positive earlier than 22L prion-infected cells (Fig. 4 and Fig. S4). Of note, the data shown in Fig. S4 were obtained in an independent repeat experiment. As expected, ME7-infected astrocytes showed prion conversion in RT-QuIC assay at the early passages that completely disappeared at passage 4 (Fig. 4), in accordance with immunoblotting and immunofluorescence results (Figure 2, Figure 3, respectively). Taken together, these data indicate that C8D astrocytes propagate the three prion strains very differentially, regarding prion conversion activity and PK resistance and aggregation behavior of PrPSc. Although RML prion-infected cells provided only weak and very late PrPSc signals in immunoblot, which would grade them almost as noninfected, they showed the highest prion conversion activity over the passages tested here. Having obtained a stable PrPSc signal in 22L-infected astrocytes throughout the six passages, we next cloned them to obtain a persistently infected subclone. The cells were infected newly for this purpose, and single-cell clones were produced by limiting dilution at passage 3. We used RT-QuIC assay for initial screening of persistently infected subclones. Clones that exhibited positive prion conversion were further tested using immunoblotting. Clone N31 demonstrated strong PrPSc levels in Western blotting and prion conversion activity in RT-QuIC. We continued passaging and testing clone N31 for more than 6 months to verify the persistence of the prion infection (Fig. 5 and Fig. S5). In summary, this new astrocyte cell culture model for prion infection could help to unravel the molecular mechanisms of prion propagation and prion strain biology in glia cells. Prions are infectious particles composed of misfolded prion protein that can be propagated experimentally both in vivo and ex vivo with exceptions. The establishment of in vitro models of persistent prion infection have greatly enhanced our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of prion formation and propagation, yet many aspects of prion replication remain elusive, including the factors controlling the susceptibility of a given cell line. The permissiveness of a cell line to prion infection is determined by many factors. The endogenous level of expression of PrPC of the same species is important (47Büeler H. Aguzzi A. Sailer A. Greiner R.A. Autenried P. Aguet M. Weissmann C. Mice devoid of PrP are resistant to scrapie.Cell. 1993; 73 (8100741): 1339-134710.1016/0092-8674(93)90360-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar), although it is not a requirement for uptake of PrPSc (48Greil C.S.

Acute cellular uptake of abnormal prion protein is cell type and scrapie-strain independent.Virology. 2008; 379 (18692214): 284-29310.1016/j.virol.2008.07.006Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 49Paquet S.

Differential gene regulatory networks among subclones of a cell line may also facilitate or inhibit permissibility to persistent prion infection (50Imberdis T. Harris D.A.

On the other hand, prion strains can also exhibit host cell tropism in vivo (51Hecker R. Taraboulos A. Scott M. Pan K.M. Yang S.L. Torchia M. Jendroska K. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B.

The ketosynthase (KS) domains of polyketide synthase normally catalyze the decarboxylative Claisen condensation of acyl and malonyl blocks to extend the polyketide chain. However, the terminal KS domain in tenuazonic acid synthetase 1 (TAS1) from the fungus Pyricularia oryzae conducts substrate cyclization. Here, we report on the unique features of the KS domain in TAS1. We observed that this domain is monomeric, not dimeric as is typical for KSs. Analysis of a 1.68-Å resolution crystal structure suggests that the substrate cyclization is triggered via proton abstraction from the active methylene moiety in the substrate by a catalytic His-322 residue. Additionally, we show that TAS1 KS promiscuously accepts aminoacyl substrates and that this promiscuity can be increased by a single amino acid substitution in the substrate-binding pocket of the enzyme. These findings provide insight into a KS domain that accepts the amino acid–containing substrate in an NRPS–PKS hybrid enzyme and provide hints to the substrate cyclization mechanism performed by the KS domain in the biosynthesis of the mycotoxin tenuazonic acid.

These findings provide insight into a KS domain that accepts the amino acid–containing substrate in an NRPS–PKS hybrid enzyme and provide hints to the substrate cyclization mechanism performed by the KS domain in the biosynthesis of the mycotoxin tenuazonic acid. We previously reported that tetramic acid (2,4-pyrrolidinedione) derivative mycotoxin tenuazonic acid (TeA) is synthesized by tenuazonic acid synthetase 1 (TAS1) in Pyricularia oryzae. TAS1 is the first reported fungal nonribosomal peptide synthetase–polyketide synthase (NRPS–PKS) hybrid enzyme that consists of an NRPS module of domains C-A-PCP (C, condensation; A, adenylation; PCP, peptidyl carrier protein) and a terminal PKS ketosynthase (KS) domain. Tetramic acid ring formation by Dieckmann cyclization in the course of TeA biosynthesis is predicted to be catalyzed by the KS domain (1Yun C.-S. Motoyama T. Osada H. Biosynthesis of the mycotoxin tenuazonic acid by a fungal NRPS-PKS hybrid enzyme.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 (26503170): 875810.1038/ncomms9758Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The KS domain is an essential domain of modular type I PKS systems that normally carries out decarboxylative Claisen condensation of acyl and malonyl blocks to yield linear polyketide backbones (2Hertweck C. The biosynthetic logic of polyketide diversity.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2009; 48 (19514004): 4688-471610.1002/anie.200806121Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). However, exceptional KS domains have also been reported to have a noncanonical role in type I PKS systems. PKS RhiE-KS3 plays a key role in vinylogous chain branching in the course of rhizoxin biosynthesis without ketide chain elongation (3Bretschneider T. Heim J.B. Heine D. Winkler R. Busch B. Kusebauch B. Stehle T. Zocher G. Hertweck C.

A KS domain which has one His residue of the catalytic triad mutated has been reported to only carry out substrate transfer to the next domain in the course of FR901464 biosynthesis (4He H.-Y. Tang M.-C. Zhang F. Tang G.-L. Cis-double bond formation by thioesterase and transfer by ketosynthase in FR901464 biosynthesis.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2014; 136 (24617828): 4488-449110.1021/ja500942yCrossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Additionally, in type III PKSs homodimers of KS domains catalyze ketide extension and substrate cyclization in a single catalytic pocket (5Katsuyama Y. Ohnishi Y. Type III polyketide synthases in microorganisms.Methods Enzymol. 2012; 515 (22999182): 359-37710.1016/B978-0-12-394290-6.00017-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a KS domain with a cyclization and not ketide extension role has only been reported in TAS1. NRPSs have a monomeric structure (6Tanovic A. Samel S.A. Essen L.-O. Marahiel M.A. Crystal structure of the termination module of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase.Science. 2008; 321 (18583577): 659-66310.1126/science.1159850Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), but the EM reconstruction of full-length type I PKS module shows an overall homodimeric architecture within which the KS domains associate (7Dutta S. Whicher J.R. Hansen D.A. Hale W.A. Chemler J.A. Congdon G.R. Narayan A.R.H. Håkansson K. Sherman D.H. Smith J.L. Skiniotis G.

Additionally, there is a report showing PKSs to be dimers that rely on biochemistry, not structure (9Kao C. Pieper M.R. Cane D.E. Khosla C. Evidence for two catalytically independent clusters of active sites in a functional modular polyketide synthase.Biochemistry. 1996; 35 (8823171): 12363-1236810.1021/bi9616312Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, there is no report on the association state of the amino acid–containing substrate-accepting KS domain in the NRPS–PKS hybrid enzyme like TAS1. Bioactive natural products, biosynthesized by the multidomain enzymes NRPS and PKS, often possess a cyclic portion (10Fischbach M.A. Walsh C.T. Assembly-line enzymology for polyketide and nonribosomal peptide antibiotics: Logic, machinery, and mechanisms.Chem.

Because of the beneficial properties such as cell permeability and biological activity, cyclic natural products have attracted considerable attention in the field of therapeutic agent development (12Abdalla M.A. McGaw L.J.

Generally, bacterial NRPSs utilize the terminal thioesterase (TE) domain to conduct substrate cyclization, whereas fungal NRPSs use the terminal condensation-like domain for product cyclization. Additionally, the terminal reductase-like cyclization domain in fungal PKS–NRPS hybrid enzymes known that related to substrate cyclization (15Trauger J.W. Kohli R.M. Mootz H.D.

Peptide cyclization catalysed by the thioesterase domain of tyrocidine synthetase.Nature. 2000; 407 (11001063): 215-21810.1038/35025116Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 16Gao X.

However, the precise cyclization mechanism at the molecular level of all the reported cyclization domains remains unknown. Herein, we propose the mechanism of cyclization for tetramic acid ring formation by the KS domain of TAS1 in the course of TeA biosynthesis using crystallographic and mutational analyses and demonstrate broad substrate specificity and characteristic association state of TAS1 KS. We first wished to determine the oligomerization state of the TAS1 KS domain in solution. To obtain the excised KS domain, a gene construct encoding only the KS domain from TAS1 was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. This KS domain was purified, had its affinity tags removed, and was confirmed to be active (Fig. S1). Intriguingly, size-exclusion chromatography showed TAS1 KS domain to be in monomeric state in aqueous solution (Fig. 2). To determine whether this state is distinctive to TAS1 KS or common to amino acid–containing substrate-accepting KS, we also performed size-exclusion chromatography analysis of OzmQ-KS1 protein, which accepts aminoacyl substrate but preforms traditional elongation in the hybrid oxazolomycin biosynthetic gene cluster (18Zhao C. Coughlin J.M. Ju J. Zhu D. Wendt-Pienkowski E. Zhou X. Wang Z. Shen B. Deng Z. Oxazolomycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces albus JA3453 featuring an “acyltransferase-less” type I polyketide synthase that incorporates two distinct extender units.J. Biol.

Interestingly, OzmQ-KS1 showed a dimeric state in aqueous solution, unlike TAS1 KS (Fig. 2), suggesting that the monomeric state is characteristic of TAS1 KS. To investigate the unique TAS1 KS domain that has unprecedented cyclization function in the course of TeA biosynthesis, we determined its crystal structure and compared it to that of other previously reported canonical KS proteins. TAS1 KS domain protein was crystallized and its structure solved at 1.68 Å resolution (Fig. 3A). The TAS1 KS domain shows a thiolase fold typical of canonical KS domain structures (19Tsai S.-C. Ames B.D. Structural enzymology of polyketide synthases.Methods Enzymol. 2009; 459 (19362634): 17-4710.1016/S0076-6879(09)04602-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the overall structure of the TAS1 KS domain was more similar to that of the type I PKS KS domain (20Tang Y. Kim C.-Y. Mathews I.I. Cane D.E. Khosla C. The 2.7-Å crystal structure of a 194-kDa homodimeric fragment of the 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Yang D. Matsui T. Hashimoto M. Morita H. Fujii I. Abe I. Structural basis for the formation of acylalkylpyrones from two β–ketoacyl units by the fungal type III polyketide CsyB.J. Biol.

Our previous study indicated that the TAS1 KS domain is closely classified to type I PKS KS domain as a new independent clade in phylogenetic analysis (1Yun C.-S. Motoyama T. Osada H. Biosynthesis of the mycotoxin tenuazonic acid by a fungal NRPS-PKS hybrid enzyme.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 (26503170): 875810.1038/ncomms9758Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and the obtained crystal structure model supports this classification. Superposed structures of TAS1 KS and canonical type I PKS KS from 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase (PDB ID: 2HG4) (20Tang Y. Kim C.-Y. Mathews I.I. Cane D.E. Khosla C. The 2.7-Å crystal structure of a 194-kDa homodimeric fragment of the 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Type I PKS KS crystal structures without this α-helix have been described; and these KS domains are all located after the NRPS module, suggesting that these KS domains accept amino acid–containing substrates (22Gay D.C. Wagner D.T. Meinke J.L. Zogzas C.E. Gay G.R. Keatinge-Clay A.T. The LINKS motif zippers trans-acyltransferase polyketide synthase assembly lines into a biosynthetic megacomplex.J. Struct.

Absence of this helical structure may be a hallmark of KS domains that accept more bulky substrates which contain amino acid. Substrate-binding pocket structure of the TAS1 KS is similar to that of type I PKS KS. The catalytic triad of type I PKS KS domain is Cys-His-His (24Keatinge-Clay A.T. The structure of type I polyketide synthases.Nat. Prod. Rep. 2012; 29 (22858605): 1050-107310.1039/c2np20019hCrossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and TAS1 KS has a similar Cys-His-Asn (Fig. S4). To evaluate the catalytic role of the catalytic triad in cyclization, we analyzed the TeA-producing activity of KS mutants. The C179A mutant did not show TeA-producing activity (Fig. 4A). This is not unexpected because intermediate translocation from the upstream acyl carrier protein to the catalytic Cys residue of KS is the initial step of KS function in PKS system (25Robbins T. Kapilivsky J. Cane D.E. Khosla C. Roles of conserved active site residues in the ketosynthase domain of an assembly line polyketide synthase.Biochemistry. 2016; 55 (27441852): 4476-448410.1021/acs.biochem.6b00639Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore the result indicates that in WT TAS1, the PCP-bound intermediate is analogously transferred to Cys-179, and that the C179A mutant could not load the intermediate for further reaction. Mutations H322A and N376A decreased TeA-producing activity to 6 and 9% of WT KS, respectively. Next, we tested mutation of Ser-324 because it is situated in the highly conserved region adjacent to the catalytic triad and not fully conserved between TAS1 KS and type I PKS KS, where it is a Thr (Fig. S4). We, therefore, tested the S324A mutant, which also decreased TeA-producing activity to 4% of WT KS (Fig. 4A). These results indicate that the tested residues are important for the enzymatic reaction of TAS1 KS. As mentioned, TAS1 KS shows two substitutions of conserved residues compared with type I PKS KS, His to Asn-376 and Thr to Ser-324. To determine whether these replacements affect cyclization, we tested N376H and S324T single mutants and N376H/S324T double mutant. The N376H and S324T mutants and the N376H/S324T double mutant showed 31%, 67%, and 31% activities compared with WT, respectively (Fig. 4A). The results indicate that substitutions H376N and T324S are not essential for the cyclization function of TAS1 KS. The secondary structure of all the mutants used in this study was confirmed using CD analysis (Fig. S5). To gain a deeper insight into the substrate and the key amino acid–residue interaction, we attempted co-crystallization of TAS1 KS and an artificial substrate, N-acetoacetyl-l-Ile-SNAC (1Yun C.-S. Motoyama T. Osada H. Biosynthesis of the mycotoxin tenuazonic acid by a fungal NRPS-PKS hybrid enzyme.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 (26503170): 875810.1038/ncomms9758Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar); however, despite various efforts, we could not obtain a co-crystal. Therefore, we conducted in silico docking simulation using the crystallographic structure of TAS1 KS as a receptor and N-acetoacetyl-l-Ile covalently bound to Cys-179 as substrate ligand. Through the docking simulation, we obtained the most stable docking conformation of the ligand with the lowest binding energy. In this conformation, the covalently bound substrate was positioned near the two catalytically important residues (His-322 and Ser-324), and a hydrogen bond occurred between the carbonyl oxygen of the acetoacetyl moiety of the bound ligand and the hydroxyl group of residue Ser-324 (Fig. 4, B and C). Because the Nε atom of His-322 is close to the methylene moiety of the bound ligand, His-322 likely abstracts the methylene proton to produce a carbanion intermediate that is stabilized by two adjacent carbonyl groups. (Fig. 4, B and C). Therefore, based on the crystal structure and docking simulation of TAS1 KS, we hypothesize that covalently bound N-acetoacetyl-l-Ile onto Cys-179 is properly positioned by hydrogen bonding to Ser-324, and then the methylene proton abstraction by His-322 triggers a nucleophilic attack on the thioester carbonyl to produce the tetramic acid ring and TeA release (Fig. 4C). To test our hypothesis from the docking simulation, we constructed the H322F mutant because Phe does not have proton donor or acceptor atoms, and thus, if our hypothesis is valid, H322F should not produce TeA. The results show that H322F was indeed unable to produce TeA (Fig. 4A). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the bulky side chain of Phe-322 hampered substrate loading onto Cys-179, thus preventing TeA production. To verify these possibilities, we conducted a MALDI-TOF MS analysis to detect covalently bound protein-substrate complexes. The artificial substrate N-acetoacetyl-l-Ile-SNAC was used for activity analysis of TAS1 KS domain in our previous report (1Yun C.-S. Motoyama T. Osada H. Biosynthesis of the mycotoxin tenuazonic acid by a fungal NRPS-PKS hybrid enzyme.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 (26503170): 875810.1038/ncomms9758Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, we cannot discriminate between substrate-loaded and -unloaded protein using this substrate because the loaded substrate onto WT KS domain cyclized then released as a TeA. Thus, we synthesized N-2,2-dimethylacetoacetyl-l-Ile-SNAC, an analog of the original substrate containing dimethyl moiety instead of active methylene moiety that prevents hydrogen abstraction for cyclization and product release (Figs. S6 and S13–S19). Covalently bound protein–substrate complexes were detected in WT and H322F, whereas no complex was observed in C179A. These results show the possibilities that the H322F mutant can load but not cyclize the substrate (Fig. 5), and that proton abstraction from the active methylene moiety is a crucial step for cyclization. We also tested another residue, Glu-378, which is located near the center of the catalytic pocket in TAS1 KS (Fig. S4). Interestingly, the E378A mutant showed more than 2-fold higher TeA production than WT. We assumed that the increase in activity might be because of a resolution of an electrostatic imbalance caused between a nonpolar Ile of the substrate and a polar Glu residue or elimination of steric hindrance coming from the Glu residue. To further investigate, we constructed mutants with nonpolar and polar amino acid substitutions at position 378 (E378L and E378Q). These mutants showed similar TeA producing capability to WT, indicating that resolution of the electrostatic imbalance is not the reason for increased activity of E378A (Fig. 4A). We also constructed mutants with larger and smaller amino acid substitutions, E378F and E378G. E378F was approximately as active as WT, but E378G produced 3-fold more TeA (Fig. 4A), suggesting that elimination of the steric hindrance resulting from Glu-378 increased KS activity. To check substrate loading on the E378A mutant, MALDI-TOF MS analysis was conducted. The detected peak corresponding to the protein–substrate complex of E378A was higher than that of WT (Fig. S7). It is possible that the increased activity of E378A is related to substrate-loading efficiency. Using N-acetoacetyl-l-Ile-SNAC, the Km value was 0.41 ± 0.04 mm and 0.34 ± 0.05 mm for E378A and WT, respectively, and the kcat value for E378A was (141 ± 7.2) × 10−3 min−1, an ∼44-fold increase compared with WT, which was (3.67 ± 0.3) × 10−3 min−1 (Fig. S8). However, the exact mechanism underlying the increased activity of E378A remains unclear. Further studies using di-domain crystal structure analysis of PCP-KS of TAS1 with the tethered substrate will be helpful to clarify the substrate-loading mechanism from PCP to the KS domain. The other amino acid–accepting ketosynthase domain of bacillaene synthase, BaeJ KS1, shows high substrate specificity through significant selectivity against bulkier substituents at the α position of the amino acid–containing substrate (26Kohlhaas C. Jenner M. Kampa A. Briggs G.S. Afonso J.P. Piel J. Oldham N.J. Amino acid-accepting ketosynthase domain from a trans-AT polyketide synthase exhibits high selectivity for predicted intermediate.Chem. Sci. 2013; 4: 3212-321710.1039/c3sc50540eCrossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, we predicted that elimination of the steric hindrance in the E378A mutant might result in the acceptance of substrates with amino acids larger than Ile. To confirm the prediction, N-acetoacetyl-l-Phe-SNAC and N-acetoacetyl-l-Trp-SNAC were synthesized (Figs. S6, S13, and S20–S27). The results show that these substrates were successfully cyclized by E378A (Fig. 6 and Figs. S9 and S10). Interestingly, although weaker than E378A, WT KS also cyclized the N-acetoacetyl-l-Phe-SNAC (Fig. 6). TeA analogs containing Leu and Val instead of Ile were already reported in the culture broth of TeA producer Alternaria tenuis (27Gatenbeck S. Sierankiewicz J. Microbial production of tenuazonic acid analogues.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1973; 3 (4790594): 308-30910.1128/aac.3.2.308Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We also tested 20 amino acids as substrates with the purified full-length TAS1 enzyme (1Yun C.-S. Motoyama T. Osada H. Biosynthesis of the mycotoxin tenuazonic acid by a fungal NRPS-PKS hybrid enzyme.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 (26503170): 875810.1038/ncomms9758Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and the product was only detected in three amino acids (Ile, Leu, Val) (Fig. S11). This observation suggests that TAS1 KS domain can accept at least the three above amino acids, as well as the Phe and may indicate that TAS1 KS has intrinsic tolerance for a broad range of substrates. A huge number of structurally diverse tetramic acid ring-containing natural products have been discovered to date in bacteria, fungi, and marine organisms and have shown a wide range of bioactivities such as antimicrobial, antiviral, and antitumor activities (28Mo X. Li Q. Ju J. Naturally occurring tetramic acid products: Isolation, structure elucidation and biological activity.RSC Adv. 2014; 4: 50566-5059310.1039/C4RA09047KCrossref Google Scholar). To date, four different enzymes or domains responsible for tetramic acid ring formation have been reported, in addition to TAS1 KS. In fungi, tetramic acid–containing natural products are generally biosynthesized by a PKS–NRPS hybrid enzyme, and tetramic acid ring structure formation is reportedly related to the terminal cyclization domain that has a sequence similarity to short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases (29Liu X.

Cyclopiazonic acid biosynthesis in Aspergillus sp.: Characterization of a reductase-like R* domain in cyclopiazonate synthetase that forms and releases cyclo-acetoacetyl-l-tryptophan.Biochemistry. 2009; 48 (19663400): 8746-875710.1021/bi901123rCrossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 30Sims J.W.

In bacteria, tetramic acid moieties containing secondary metabolites are biosynthesized by PKS–NRPS hybrid enzymes or cooperation of continuous type I PKS and NRPS modular enzymes, and three different tetramic acid ring formation patterns were reported. First, the TE domain located at the end of the PKS–NRPS assembly lines mediates Dieckmann cyclization in HSAF, frontalamides, and ikarugamycins biosynthesis (31Lou L. Qian G. Xie Y. Hang J. Chen H.

Ed. 2014; 53 (24706593): 4840-484410.1002/anie.201402078Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Second, tetramic acid ring formation through the action of stand-alone TE-like Dieckmann cyclase was reported in triandamycin biosynthesis (34Gui C. Li Q. Mo X. Qin X. Ma J. Ju J. Discovery of a new family of Dieckmann cyclases essential to tetramic acid and pyridine-based natural products biosynthesis.Org. Lett. 2015; 17 (25621700): 628-63110.1021/ol5036497Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Third, in the course of pyrroindomycin biosynthesis, two genes that PyrD3 homologous to various acyltransferase E2 subunits of 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes and PyrD4 belonging to the α/β-hydrolase superfamily are demonstrated to be involved in tetramic acid ring formation (35Wu Q. Wu Z. Qu X. Liu W. Insights into pyrroindomycin biosynthesis reveal a uniform paradigm for tetramate/tetronate formation.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2012; 134 (23062149): 17342-1734510.1021/ja304829gCrossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, the detailed molecular mechanism of all the reported enzymes and domains, including TAS1 KS, that catalyze tetramic acid ring formation is unclear. In this study, we elucidated one part of the mechanism of tetramic acid ring formation in natural product biosynthesis. The TAS1 KS domain showed a monomeric state in contrast to other canonical type KSs, which are present in a dimeric state. KS domain deletion experiments from the multidomain PKS show that the dimeric feature of the KS domain is crucial for dimerization of the full-length PKS (36Witkowski A. Joshi A. Smith K.S. Characterization of the β-carbon processing reactions of the mammalian cytosolic fatty acid synthase: Role of the central core.Biochemistry. 2004; 43 (15301544): 10458-1046610.1021/bi048988nCrossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although we still do not know the association state of the full length of TAS1, the KS domain in this enzyme is seems quite different from other classical KSs. From docking simulations, the role of His-322 and Ser-324 residues in the cyclization process was predicted. However, the role of Asn-376 in the course of substrate cyclization remains unclear in this docking model. TeA has cis-type peptide bonds, and thus we assume that deprotonated trans-N-acetoacetyl-l-Ile by His-322 isomerize to cis-N-acetoacetyl-l-Ile, and then a nucleophilic attack of the carbanion on the thioester carbonyl carbon occurs to produce TeA (Fig. S12). Most stable docking conformations using the cis-N-acetoacetyl-l-Ile as a ligand show the di-ketide part of the substrate shifting the direction to the Asn-376 residue, and distance between Asn-376 and di-ketide is 2.9 Å, adequate for hydrogen bonding (Fig. S12). The Asn-376 residue might contribute to the stabilization of the cis-N-acetoacetyl-l-Ile form for the nucleophilic attack to produce TeA. Nine amino acids (Ala, Cys, Gly, Ile, Leu, Met, Phe, Pro, Val) do not contain the hydrogen acceptor or donor atoms. To test the role of His-322, we made two nondeprotonatable His-322 mutants, H322A and H322F. We thought that Ala could be representative of amino acids smaller than His and that Phe could be representative of amino acids bigger than His. Thus, we predicted that if Phe does not hinder substrate loading, then other amino acids will not either. In fact, we also tried to make the H322L mutant but we could not get access to the soluble protein. The hydrophobic leucine substitute may change the hydrophobicity of protein, b"

The success of therapy gaming interventions depends on the quality of the technology used and the presence of effective support structures. Aim This study assesses the feasibility of a novel intervention that combines a co-created gaming technology integrating evidence-based biofeedback and solution-focused coaching (SFC) strategies to support therapy engagement and efficacy at home. Methods Following feasibility and single-case reporting standards (CONSORT and SCRIBE), this was a non-blind, randomized, multiple-baseline, AB, design. Nineteen (19) young people with cerebral palsy (8–18 years old) completed the 4-week home-based intervention in France and Canada. Participant motivations, personalized practice goals, and relevance of the intervention to daily activities were discussed in a Solution Focused Coaching-style conversation pre-, post-intervention and during weekly check-ins. Participants controlled a video game by completing therapeutic gestures (wrist extension, pinching) detected via electromyography and inertial sensors on the forearm (Myo Armband and custom software). Process feasibility success criteria for recruitment response, completion and adherence rates, and frequency of technical issues were established a priori. Scientific feasibility, effect size estimates and variance were determined for Body Function outcome measures: active wrist extension, grip strength and Box and Blocks Test; and for Activities and Participation measures: Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA), Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) and Self-Reported Experiences of Activity Settings (SEAS). Results Recruitment response (31%) and assessment completion (84%) rates were good and 74% of participants reached self-identified practice goals. As 17% of technical issues required external support to resolve, the intervention was graded as feasible with modifications. No adverse events were reported. Moderate effects were observed in Body Function measures (active wrist extension: SMD = 1.82, 95%CI = 0.85–2.78; Grip Strength: SMD = 0.63, 95%CI = 0.65–1.91; Box and Blocks: Hedge’s g = 0.58, 95%CI = -0.11–1.27) and small-moderate effects in Activities and Participation measures (AHA: Hedge’s g = 0.29, 95%CI = -0.39–0.97, COPM: r = 0.60, 95%CI = 0.13–0.82, SEAS: r = 0.24, 95%CI = -0.25–0.61). Conclusion A definitive RCT to investigate the effectiveness of this novel intervention is warranted. Combining SFC-style coaching with high-quality biofeedback may positively engage youth in home rehabilitation to complement traditional therapy.

https://openalex.org/W3035871318,"There have been recent advances in predicting odor characteristics using molecular structure parameters of chemicals. Although the molecular structure parameters are available for each chemical, they cannot be used for chemical mixtures. This study will elucidate a computational method of predicting human odor perception from the mass spectra of chemical mixtures such as essential oils. Furthermore, a method for obtaining similarity among odor descriptors has been proposed although the dataset contains binary values only. When the database indicates a set of odor descriptors for one sample, only binary data are available and the correlation between the similar descriptors disappears. Thus, the prediction performance degrades for not considering the similarity among the odor descriptors. Since mass spectra dataset is highly dimensional, we use auto-encoder to learn the compressed representation from the mass spectra of essential oils in its bottleneck hidden layer and then accomplishes the hierarchical clustering to create odor descriptor groups with similar odor impressions using a matrix of continuous value-based correlation coefficient as well as natural language processing. This work will help to expatiate the process of overcoming binary value problem and find out the similarity among odor descriptors using machine learning with natural language semantic representation of words. To overcome the problem of disproportionate ratio of positive and negative class for both the continuous value-based correlation coefficient and word similarity based models, we use Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). This model allows us to predict human odor perception through computer simulations by forming odor descriptors group. Accordingly, this study demonstrates the feasibility of ensembling machine learning with natural language processing and SMOTE approach for predicting odor descriptor group from mass spectra of essential oils."

In this way, the (+)- and (–)-pinoresinol-forming DPs (DIR-a subfamily members, Fig. 1) engender distinct stereoselective intermolecular couplings, in the presence of a 1e– oxidase or oxidant, of the prochiral coniferyl alcohol quinone methide (QM) free radicals so formed (i.e. to give the two distinct enantiomeric forms of pinoresinol, depending upon the Dir-a subfamily DP type). Conversely, in the absence of the DPs, only nonregiospecific and nonstereoselective phenoxy radical coupling occurs to afford a mixture of racemic products. (+)-Pinoresinol– or (–)-pinoresinol–forming DPs initially afford formation of enantiomeric bis-QM intermediates, via either si-si or re-re coupling, depending upon the DP in a particular plant species (see Fig. 2A). Following this C–C bond formation, these bis-QM intermediates can then undergo intramolecular cyclization (C–O bond formation) to give the lignans (+)- or (–)-pinoresinols, respectively (Fig. 2A).

Again, in the absence of the DP, only racemic gossypol is formed. Stereoselective coupling, however, affords formation of the presumed chiral bis-QM, re-aromatization of which gives entry into the aromatic diterpenoid class, in this case (+)-gossypol (Fig. 2B). Gossypol occurs in leaves, roots, and seeds of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) and imparts resistance against herbivorous insects and pathogens, but (–)-gossypol is toxic to animals. The ratio of (+)- to (–)-gossypol in cottons grown in the United Statesis ∼3:2, although it can be as high as 98:2 in moco cotton, such as in the variety marie-galante (16Liu J. Stipanovic R.D.

In pterocarpan (phytoalexin) biosynthesis studies, such as to (+)-pisatin in pea (Fig. 2C), it was deduced that DPs in the DIR-b/d subfamily were involved (18Celoy R.M.

Based on this deduction, Dr. Tomoyoshi Akashi, following completion of his term as a visiting scientist in the research group of the late Hans Van Etten, examined formation of the structurally related (–)-medicarpin in licorice (Glycyrrhiza echinata) on returning to Japan. This led to the report of a medicarpin-forming DP (GePTS1) in the DIR-b/d family able to convert (3R,4R)-7,2′-dihydroxy-4′-methoxyisoflavanol (DMI) and (3S,4R)-DMI into (–)- and (+)-medicarpins, respectively, via lost of water and intramolecular C–O bond formation (19Uchida K.

From its amino acid sequence, GePTS1 is a protein harboring dirigent-like domains. In addition to the DPs in the above diverse metabolic pathways, cell wall structural reinforcement via lignin deposition has been implicated to involve DIR-e subfamily members (e.g. Arabidopsis AtDIR10; Fig. 1) (20Hosmani P.S.

The latter DPs are reportedly part of supramolecular complexes in enabling another metabolic product, lignin, to be formed in Casparian band tissues. However, the actual physiological substrates that these DPs utilize have neither been identified nor demonstrated in vitro. The genes encoding DPs for entry points in pterocarpan, lignan, lignin biopolymer, and aromatic terpenoid biosynthesis are all of similar size. Of these DPs, the DIR-e lignin-forming DPs have much longer β1-β2 loops in their 3D structures, when compared with other DP's (e.g. DRR206 (12Kim K.-W. Smith C.A. Daily M.D. Cort J.R. Davin L.B.

On the other hand, the medicarpin-forming DP appears to have no requirement for post-translational glycosylation. With the availability of structures of stereoselective medicarpin-forming DPs (nonglycosylated), stereoselective lignan-forming DPs (both apparently requiring post-translational glycosylation for stability), and a homology-modeled aromatic diterpenoid DP (GhDIR4), it was instructive to probe and compare the mechanistic biochemical features of these distinct DP types. Described herein are the 3D structures of two stereoselective pterocarpan-forming DPs from pea and licorice, which preferentially produce either (+)- or (–)-medicarpin, depending on the substrate (Fig. 2C). These findings are discussed in the context of this DP type, which has dirigent-like (amino acid sequence similarity) domains as compared with the stereoselective lignan and aromatic terpenoid-forming DPs. Of particular interest was whether there was a common DP biochemical mechanism and, if so, what were the underlying mechanistic principles involved. We describe that pterocarpan synthases, containing dirigent-like domains, initially engender mono-QM formation from their chiral substrates, this being followed by intramolecular cyclization (C–O bond formation) to afford entry into the pterocarpan natural product (phytoalexin) class. These differ from the other dirigent protein types, which instead initially enable stereoselective, one-electron, intermolecular coupling (C–C bond formation) of two identical achiral aromatic precursors to give chiral bis-QMs. The latter then either undergo intramolecular cyclization (C–O bond formation) or re-aromatization, respectively, to generate lignan and aromatic diterpenoid natural product classes.

Trivially named PsPTS1, it has ∼92%/85% sequence similarity/identity to GePTS1 at the amino acid level. Fig. 3 shows amino acid sequence alignments of the medicarpin-forming DPs (GePTS1 and PsPTS1), the (+)- and (–)-pinoresinol–forming DPs (DRR206 and AtDIR6) from P. sativum and A. thaliana, respectively, and the aromatic diterpenoid (+)-gossypol–forming DP (GhDIR4) in G. hirsutum. GePTS1 and PsPTS1 coding sequences were individually codon-optimized for Escherichia coli, with each synthetic gene cloned into the pET101/D-TOPO® E. coli expression vector harboring a C-terminal 6× polyhistidine region. The vector constructs were then each used to transform E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. After induction with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, the resulting recombinant His-tagged proteins were individually purified to apparent homogeneity (Fig. S1A) by use of metal-chelating affinity chromatography. Gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) was next carried out on a TSKgel G3000SWXL column, precalibrated with molecular weight standards, to determine the oligomeric state of both PTSs. GePTS1 and PsPTS1, in solution, exist mainly as trimers (∼68.0 kDa), with (because of association/aggregation) a small amount of higher-molecular weight entities also being evident (roughly corresponding to 410–500 kDa). Next, both GePTS1 and PsPTS1 DPs were used in assays with racemic mixtures of the diastereomers obtained through chemical synthesis from racemic vestitone (see “Experimental procedures”) (i.e. either cis-DMI ((3R,4R) and (3S,4S)) or trans-DMI ((3S,4R) and (3R,4S)), respectively), with substrates and products easily resolved by chiral column chromatography (Chiral OJ column, Chiral Technologies). As reported previously (19Uchida K. Akashi T. Aoki T. The missing link in leguminous pterocarpan biosynthesis is a dirigent domain-containing protein with isoflavanol dehydratase activity.Plant Cell Physiol. 2017; 58 (28394400): 398-40810.1093/pcp/pcw213Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), GePTS1 converted either (3R,4R)-DMI or (3S,4R)-DMI into (–)- or (+)-medicarpin, respectively (Fig. S2, B and I). The pea medicarpin-forming DP (PsPTS1) catalyzed the same conversions (Fig. S2, C and J). Control assays (no DP present) gave smaller amounts of racemic medicarpin products (Fig. S2, A and H) because of nonenzymatic conversion of cis- and trans-DMI. Kinetic data for both DPs were next obtained as follows: assays were carried out in triplicate at 10 concentrations of cis-DMI ((3R,4R) and (3S,4S)) and trans-DMI ((3S,4R) and (3R,4S)) for 5 min. Triplicate assays were also carried out in the absence of DPs to account for the nonenzymatic conversion of cis- and trans-DMI. From these determinations, GePTS1 preferentially utilized the cis-DMI (3R,4R) isomer, whereas the (3S,4S) cis-DMI was not con"

Methods Six study arms using uniform tumor radiation, half-tumor radiation, 2mm beam array radiation, 0.3mm minibeam radiation, and an untreated arm were used. All treatments were delivered on a 320kV x-ray irradiator. Forty-two female Fischer 344 rats with fibrosarcoma tumor allografts were used. Dosimetric parameters studied are peak dose and width, valley dose and width, peak-to-valley-dose-ratio (PVDR), volumetric average dose, percentage volume directly irradiated, and tumor- and normal-tissue EUD. Animal survival, tumor volume change, and body weight change (indicative of treatment toxicity) are tested for association with the dosimetric parameters using linear regression and Cox Proportional Hazards models. Results The dosimetric parameters most closely associated with tumor response are tumor EUD (R2 = 0.7923, F-stat = 15.26*; z-test = -4.07***), valley (minimum) dose (R2 = 0.7636, F-stat = 12.92*; z-test = -4.338***), and percentage tumor directly irradiated (R2 = 0.7153, F-stat = 10.05*; z-test = -3.837***) per the linear regression and Cox Proportional Hazards models, respectively. Tumor response is linearly proportional to valley (minimum) doses and tumor EUD. Average dose (R2 = 0.2745, F-stat = 1.514 (no sig.); z-test = -2.811**) and peak dose (R2 = 0.04472, F-stat = 0.6874 (not sig.); z-test = -0.786 (not sig.)) show the weakest associations to tumor response. Only the uniform radiation arm did not gain body weight post-radiation, indicative of treatment toxicity; however, body weight change in general shows weak association with all dosimetric parameters except for valley (minimum) dose (R2 = 0.3814, F-stat = 13.56**), valley width (R2 = 0.2853, F-stat = 8.783**), and peak width (R2 = 0.2759, F-stat = 8.382**). Conclusions For a single-fraction SFRT at conventional dose rates, valley, not peak, dose is closely associated with tumor treatment response and thus should be used for treatment prescription. Tumor EUD, valley (minimum) dose, and percentage tumor directly irradiated are the top three dosimetric parameters that exhibited close associations with tumor response."
https://openalex.org/W3036860066,"Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a well-known methyltransferase, mediates histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and plays a vital role in ophthalmological disease. However, its role in corneal neovascularization (CoNV) remains unclear. In vitro and in vivo models were assessed in hypoxia-stimulated angiogenesis and in a mouse model of alkali burn-induced CoNV. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured under hypoxic conditions and different reoxygenation times to identify the molecular mechanisms involved in this process. In this study, we found that EZH2 was positively related to corneal alkali burn-induced injury. Inhibition of EZH2 with 3-Deazaneplanocin A (DZNeP) alleviated corneal injury, including oxidative stress and neovascularization in vivo. Similarly, inhibition of EZH2 with either DZNeP or small interfering RNA (siRNA) exerted an inhibitory effect on hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced oxidative stress and angiogenesis in HUVECs. Moreover, our study revealed that ablation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with N-acetyl-cysteine suppressed angiogenesis in HUVECs exposed to H/R stimulation. Furthermore, Forkhead-box protein O3a (FoxO3a), which was positively associated with ROS production and angiogenesis, was elevated during H/R. This effect could be reversed through the suppression of the transcription activity of EZH2 with DZNeP or siRNA. In addition, the PI3K/Akt pathway, which is the upstream of FoxO3a, was activated in both DZNeP-treated mice and EZH2-inhibited HUVECs. Collectively, our results demonstrated that the inhibition of EZH2 alleviated corneal angiogenesis by inhibiting FoxO3a-dependent ROS production through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. These findings indicate that EZH2 may be a valuable therapeutic target for CoNV."

Neurobiology is one of the fields most profoundly impacted by these approaches. In cultured systems, additive transgenesis is widely used to derive cells homogenously expressing one or more genes of interest, a process instrumental to direct pluripotent stem cells toward specific neuronal lineages, decipher the mechanisms of their differentiation, and harness these cells to model neural pathologies (e.g., Kondo et al., 2017Kondo T.

In vivo, somatic transgenesis approaches targeting neural progenitors have acquired major importance in neurodevelopmental studies by enabling the expression of lineage markers or experimental manipulation of gene function over the long-term (Cepko, 1988Cepko C.

Since spontaneous integration occurs only at an extremely low rate, tools driving efficient genomic transgene insertion are essential to reach acceptable throughput in the above applications and implement more complex schemes involving multiple transgenes. Vectors adapted from genome-integrating RNA-based viruses have long been employed for this purpose. In particular, retroviruses capable of transducing dividing cells have been at the basis of seminal studies identifying the neuronal and glial output of embryonic neural progenitors with marker genes or sequence-based barcodes (e.g., Noctor et al., 2001Noctor S.C. Flint A.C. Weissman T.A. Dammerman R.S. Kriegstein A.R.

However, viral vector production is burdensome, and their cargo capacity is inherently limited. Fast and convenient to assemble, store, and handle, DNA vectors have become the tool of choice in many gene transfer applications, thanks to the emergence of transposases and programmable endonucleases that drive random or site-specific integration, respectively (Ivics et al., 2009Ivics Z.

Transposases provide the highest efficiency of integration, a process that they directly mediate, whereas endonucleases only indirectly stimulate transgene insertion through the host repair machinery upon target locus cleavage, with potential detrimental side effects (Haapaniemi et al., 2018Haapaniemi E.

Transposon-based systems achieve high rates of integration with >1-kb-long sequences, can handle cargos up to 100 kb (Jung et al., 2016Jung C.J. Ménoret S. Brusselle L. Tesson L. Usal C. Chenouard V.

Beyond stable cell transfection in cultured systems, they advantageously replace transgenic animal lines in a growing number of in vivo applications, including fate mapping (Chen and LoTurco, 2012Chen F.

Integrative DNA vectors can be delivered in cultured cells by a number of transfection agents, and in vertebrate animal models, the location of neural progenitors along the lumen of the neural tube makes them accessible to electroporation-based approaches that yield strong expression in their neuronal and glial descendants. Alternatively, adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) offer a convenient way to directly introduce donor DNA in mature neurons for Cas9- or transposase-mediated genomic integration (Cammack et al., 2019Cammack A.J.

While molecular tools facilitating genomic integration have been the focus of considerable efforts, the design of transgenes carried by integrative DNA vectors has essentially remained the same since the beginning of the genetic engineering era; it simply follows the arrangement of endogenous transcriptional units where the GOI is positioned downstream of its promoter and is thus constitutively expressed by episomal vectors prior to integration. Consequently, genome-integration events cannot be distinguished from residual episomal transgenes. This is a major problem that universally affects stable transgenesis procedures with DNA vectors, making them considerably more complex than transient approaches. In cultured cells, week-long delays are required to eliminate episomes, usually in the presence of drugs and with inherent risks of genetic or epigenetic drift (Liang and Zhang, 2013Liang G. Zhang Y. Genetic and epigenetic variations in iPSCs: potential causes and implications for application.Cell Stem Cell. 2013; 13: 149-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, Merkle et al., 2017Merkle F.T.

Charlton M. et al.Human pluripotent stem cells recurrently acquire and expand dominant negative P53 mutations.Nature. 2017; 545: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In vivo, transient episomes confound the interpretation of somatic transgenesis experiments, as they can act on a progenitor while being absent in its descendants due to dilution by cell division. Thus, expression from integrated markers may not accurately reflect the past history of transgene expression in a cell. This essentially precludes the development of reliable functional mosaic analysis schemes based on exogenous DNA vectors applicable to probe cell-autonomous versus non-autonomous aspects of gene function over the long-term, until now involving complex genetic schemes and the establishment of transgenic animal lines (Pontes-Quero et al., 2017Pontes-Quero S.

Episomes may also cause leakage from cell-type-specific promoters and regulatory sequences (Inoue et al., 2017Inoue F. Kircher M. Martin B. Cooper G.M. Witten D.M. McManus M.T. Ahituv N. Shendure J. A systematic comparison reveals substantial differences in chromosomal versus episomal encoding of enhancer activity.Genome Res. 2017; 27: 38-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), preventing the development of somatic intersectional schemes based on Cre/lox recombination that offer the same reliability as transgenic animal lines. Moreover, in vitro as well as in vivo, integrative schemes aimed at assessing gene function are critically impeded by the burst of episomal expression that follows transfection, which may have harmful effects on cell behavior, identity, and viability (Batard et al., 2001Batard P. Jordan M. Wurm F. Transfer of high copy number plasmid into mammalian cells by calcium phosphate transfection.Gene. 2001; 270: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To bypass the limitations of stable transfection mentioned above, there is a need for an approach through which large transgenes can be efficiently incorporated in the host genome and distinguished from episomal donor vectors. This could be achieved if transgene expression was suppressed in episomes and only switched on upon genomic integration. However, existing systems to control gene expression, such as those based on site-specific recombination (Dymecki and Kim, 2007Dymecki S.M. Kim J.C. Molecular neuroanatomy’s “three Gs”: a primer.Neuron. 2007; 54: 17-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), do not enable this. Here, we introduce an integration-coupled On (iOn) gene expression switch through which genomic insertion of an initially silent transgene is accompanied by a rearrangement that triggers its expression. We present several implementations of this concept that efficiently couple transcriptional or translational gene activation to genomic integration. We demonstrate its advantages for highly efficient establishment of stable mouse and human pluripotent stem cell lines expressing multiple transgenes in vitro. In vivo, somatic transfection with iOn-based vectors constitutes a powerful alternative to additive transgenesis to drive constitutive or conditional expression of reporters and effectors. We applied this approach for lineage and functional mosaic analyses in chick embryos that enabled us to determine the clonal output of genetically defined progenitor subtypes in the developing retina and to uncover a homeostatic control of neurogenesis in the embryonic neural tube. These results establish iOn as an efficient strategy for direct readout of transgenesis that accelerates and facilitates genetic manipulations in neurodevelopmental and neural stem cell studies and is also applicable to virtually any cell type or species. To create the iOn switch (Figure 1), we took advantage of the piggyBac transposition system (Fraser et al., 1996Fraser M.J. Ciszczon T. Elick T. Bauser C. Precise excision of TTAA-specific lepidopteran transposons piggyBac (IFP2) and tagalong (TFP3) from the baculovirus genome in cell lines from two species of Lepidoptera.Insect Mol. Biol. 1996; 5: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), currently one of the most efficient tool for genomic integration of exogenous DNA (Ding et al., 2005Ding S. Wu X. Li G. Han M. Zhuang Y. Xu T. Efficient transposition of the piggyBac (PB) transposon in mammalian cells and mice.Cell. 2005; 122: 473-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar), characterized by its very large cargo capacity (Jung et al., 2016Jung C.J. Ménoret S. Brusselle L. Tesson L. Usal C. Chenouard V. Remy S. Ouisse L.H. Poirier N. Vanhove B. et al.Comparative analysis of piggyBac, CRISPR/Cas9 and TALEN mediated BAC transgenesis in the zygote for the generation of humanized SIRPA rats.Sci.

Mobilization of giant piggyBac transposons in the mouse genome.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: e148Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and precise cut-and-paste mechanism mediating traceless transposon excision. In classic transposon vectors (Figure 1A, left), the transgene, framed by two antiparallel-oriented terminal repeats (TRs) recognized by the piggyBac transposase, is readily active prior to excision from the donor plasmid. We reasoned that placing the TRs in parallel rather than antiparallel orientation would create a situation in which transposase-mediated insertion in the host genome is accompanied by a rearrangement exploitable to trigger gene expression (Figure 1A, right). We first designed transcriptional versions of iOn switch in which a promoter (Prom) and GOI, initially placed in opposite orientation, are reunited in a functional configuration by transposition (Figure 1A, right, and Figures S1A–S1D). We hereafter denote this transgene arrangement iOnProm∞GOI by opposition to a classic transposon driving constitutive expression noted PBProm::GOI. We tested different iOn vector designs using the broadly active CAG promoter and a red fluorescent protein (RFP) as GOI, which we assayed by transfection in HEK293 cells in presence or absence of piggyBac transposase (PBase) (Figures S1A–S1D). 3 days after transfection, PBase-dependent RFP expression was observed with all tested constructs, validating the iOn switch concept. We selected the transgene design with highest signal to noise ratio (Figure S1C). This construct, hereafter termed iOnCAG∞RFP, yielded efficient RFP expression with very low background transcription in absence of PBase (0.4%; Figure 1B, right). Time-course experiments comparing the iOn vector with classic piggyBac-based and nonintegrative plasmids showed that the iOn switch achieves long-term GOI expression without the transient expression burst associated with vectors active in episomal form (Figure 1C). Instead, GOI expression gradually builds up, plateaus within a few days and remains in a narrower range compared to a classic transposon (Figures 1C, S1E, and S1F), a feature of high interest to reduce variability and improve protein localization in transfection assays. Indeed, in HEK293 cells transfected with an iOn vector expressing a farnesylated GFP (GFP-Kras), near-uniform membrane expression staining was observed 3 days after transfection, while signal from a classic transposon showed frequent clustering and overflowing of GFP from the membrane compartment (Figure 1D). Importantly, short- and long-term viability with iOn vectors were comparable to that of classic transposons (Figures S1G and S1H), and the switch was active in all cells tested, including HeLa and 3T3 (Figure S1I) as well as human and mouse pluripotent stem cells (see below). To confirm that the iOn switch functions as expected, we performed the following tests. First, we verified that both TRs were necessary to power the switch using truncated iOnCAG∞RFP vectors lacking either the 5′ or 3′ piggyBac TR. As expected (Wang et al., 2014Wang Y. Wang J. Devaraj A. Singh M. Jimenez Orgaz A. Chen J.X. Selbach M. Ivics Z. Izsvák Z. Suicidal autointegration of sleeping beauty and piggyBac transposons in eukaryotic cells.PLoS Genet. 2014; 10: e1004103Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), transfection of these single-TR plasmids in HEK293 cells yielded only barely detectable fluorescence in very rare cells (Figure S2A). Second, to separately monitor each of the two vector “arms,” we designed an iOn plasmid bearing two distinct fluorescent protein (FP) markers upstream of each PB TR. 7 days after transfection, co-expression of these markers was observed in a vast majority of labeled cells (94% ± 3% SEM), indicating near-systematic co-integration of the two arms upon transposase action (Figure S2B). Finally, to verify whether the switch drives the predicted transgene rearrangement, we derived clones from individual fluorescent cells transfected with iOnCAG∞RFP in which we sequenced the junction between the promoter and GOI; all sequences demonstrated reunion of the two transgene elements with base-pair precision (Figure 1E; n = 6). The latter approach also enabled us to compare the performance of iOn versus classic transposons for stable cell line establishment. Analysis of >500 clones showed that 95.78% (±0.73% SEM) remained RFP positive 10 days after sorting, indicating highly efficient integration of the transgene in the genome of founder cells and long-term maintenance of its expression (Figure 1F). Indeed, analysis of the few RFP-negative clones among 440 clones demonstrated that they had lost and not silenced the transgene (Figure S2C). By contrast, a classic PBCAG::RFP vector yielded only 55.18% (±5.07% SEM) of RFP-positive clones (Figure 1F). Similar to HEK cells, fluorescence-based clonal selection of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with the above GFP-Kras-expressing iOn vector demonstrated a high enrichment in integrative events compared to a classic transposon (Figure S2D). Thus, the dependence of the iOn switch on transposition enables efficient coupling of transgene activation and genomic integration. Together, these results establish iOn as a tool for highly effective drug-free transgenesis through which genomic expression of GOIs can be assessed directly after transfection, without interfering episomal expression. Vectors based on the transcriptional version of the iOn switch, presented above, suppress most activity from episomes and shall suffice in a majority of uses, such as stable cell line establishment or assessment of gene function. In anticipation of highly sensitive applications, we nevertheless explored ways to achieve even tighter control of gene expression. First, we sought to abolish the faint episomal leakiness observed with transcriptionally activated iOn vectors. Transcriptional background is a general problem with non-chromosomal DNA (Inoue et al., 2017Inoue F. Kircher M. Martin B. Cooper G.M. Witten D.M. McManus M.T. Ahituv N. Shendure J. A systematic comparison reveals substantial differences in chromosomal versus episomal encoding of enhancer activity.Genome Res. 2017; 27: 38-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), whether due to cryptic promoter activity or unavoidable “pervasive” transcription (Clark et al., 2011Clark M.B. Amaral P.P. Schlesinger F.J. Dinger M.E. Taft R.J. Rinn J.L. Ponting C.P. Stadler P.F. Morris K.V. Morillon A. et al.The reality of pervasive transcription.PLoS Biol. 2011; 9 (e1000625–discussion e1001102)Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). To bypass this issue, we designed a leak-proof iOn (LiOn) switch in which both transcription and translation are blocked in absence of transposase (Figures 2A and 2B ). In LiOn, the GOI open reading frame (ORF) is initially interrupted after the translational start and reconstituted upon PBase action, the piggyBac excision footprint (TTAA) being incorporated at a silent or neutral position (Figure 2A). A plasmid based on this design (hereafter denoted LiOnProm∞GOI) showed undetectable leakiness in absence of transposase (Figure 2B) and provided similar PBase-dependent expression compared to the transcriptional iOn, with the same reduced variability and low toxicity (Figures S1F and S1G). Second, we sought to suppress any unwanted episomal activation of iOn vectors that may happen through self- (a.k.a. “suicidal”) integration, shown in previous work to occur at low frequency with classic transposon vectors (Wang et al., 2014Wang Y. Wang J. Devaraj A. Singh M. Jimenez Orgaz A. Chen J.X. Selbach M. Ivics Z. Izsvák Z. Suicidal autointegration of sleeping beauty and piggyBac transposons in eukaryotic cells.PLoS Genet. 2014; 10: e1004103Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To avoid this effect, we synthesized a modified LiOn vector with punctual substitutions in all 34 PBase target sequences (TTAA) present in the backbone, promoter, and polyadenylation signals (Figure 2C), which we used to express RFP. In HEK293 cells, expression from this TTAA-less LiOn vector (denoted LiOn∗CAG∞RFP) in presence of PBase was comparable to that obtained with the non-edited LiOn version (Figure 2C, bottom). To evaluate the activation of the switch in nonintegrated plasmids, we then purified episomes from the transfected HEK cells, which we transformed in competent bacteria. While PCR tests performed on the resulting bacterial colonies revealed a low fraction (<5%) of activated episomes in cells transfected with the unmodified LiOn vector, activated plasmids were not observed with the TTAA-less LiOn plasmid (n = 130 colonies; Figure 2D). Further qPCR tests performed on the episomal fraction recovered from HEK cells also demonstrated a significant reduction of activated episomes with the TTAA-less strategy (Figure S3). Thus, in cases requiring very tight transgene control, both the low PBase-independent transcriptional leakiness of iOn vectors and their rare PBase-dependent episomal activation can be efficiently controlled through the LiOn and TTAA-less iOn strategies, respectively. Having validated the iOn switch and its improved implementations, we next sought to extend its range of applications in cultured cells (Figure 3). Stable transfection with multiple independent transgenes is challenging with standard DNA vectors due to false positives resulting from episomal expression and the difficulty of combining orthogonal drug selection systems.

Socioeconomic and racial inequities in childhood lead exposure have been well documented, however childhood lead exposure in Milwaukee is understudied. As a segregated rustbelt metropolitan area with childhood lead exposure concerns, Milwaukee is uniquely positioned to evaluate the synergistic effects of racial and economic drivers of childhood lead exposure. Using surveillance data from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, Division of Public Health and the US Census Bureau, this cross-sectional study determined the intersectional effect of poverty, home ownership, and racial/ethnic composition on childhood lead exposure in Milwaukee County neighborhoods using linear regression adjusting for average census tract housing age and number of children. The final analytical sample consisted of 48,393 individual childhood blood lead levels aggregated to 215 Milwaukee County census tracts. Census tracts with mean childhood blood lead levels greater than or equal to 5 μg/dL were predominantly low home ownership, high poverty, and majority non-White census tracts. The effects of low home ownership, high poverty, and majority non-White census tracts were synergistic, producing 1.78 (95% CI: 1.44, 2.11) μg/dL higher mean childhood blood lead level than high home ownership, low poverty, and majority White census tracts (referent). This research reveals that social determinants at the neighborhood level co-occur and interact to produce inequities in childhood lead exposure. Lead prevention efforts should align with equity-focused housing and economic policies that target primary prevention in neighborhoods disproportionately burdened by childhood lead exposure."
https://openalex.org/W3036550173,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) pre-S mutants in liver tissues or blood have been regarded as a high-risk population for HCC development and recurrence. Detection of pre-S mutants in clinical specimens is thus important for early diagnosis and prognosis of HCC to improve patient survival. Recently, we have developed a next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based platform that can quantitatively detect pre-S mutants in patient plasma with superior sensitivity and accuracy. In this study, we compared the pre-S genotyping results from plasma by the NGS-based analysis with those from liver tissues by the immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based analysis in 30 HBV-related HCC patients. We demonstrated that the detection rate of pre-S mutants was significantly higher by NGS- than by IHC-based analysis. There was a moderate to good agreement between both analyses in detection of pre-S mutants. Compared with the IHC, the NGS-based detection of pre-S mutants in patient plasma could determine the patterns of pre-S mutants in liver tissues more efficiently in a noninvasive manner. Our data suggest that the NGS-based platform may represent a promising approach for detection of pre-S mutants as biomarkers of HBV-related HCC in clinical practice."

Emerging evidence implicates multiple members of the NimA-related kinase (NEK) family (NEK1, NEK10, and NEK11) in the DDR. Here, we describe a function for NEK10 in the regulation of p53 transcriptional activity through tyrosine phosphorylation. NEK10 loss increases cellular proliferation by modulating the p53-dependent transcriptional output. NEK10 directly phosphorylates p53 on Y327, revealing NEK10’s unexpected substrate specificity. A p53 mutant at this site (Y327F) acts as a hypomorph, causing an attenuated p53-mediated transcriptional response. Consistently, NEK10-deficient cells display heightened sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. Further, a combinatorial score of NEK10 and TP53-target gene expression is an independent predictor of a favorable outcome in breast cancers."
https://openalex.org/W3036882129,"Saturation, a core concept in qualitative research, suggests when data collection might end. It is reached when no new relevant information emerges with additional interviews. The aim of this research was to explore whether a mixed methods design could contribute to the demonstration of saturation. Firstly, saturation was conceptualized mathematically using set theory. Secondly, a conversion mixed design was conducted: a set of codes derived from qualitative interviews were quantitized and analyzed using partial least squares (PLS) regression to document whether saturation was reached. A qualitative study conducted by other researchers prior to this work (i.e. none of the present authors was involved in this study) was used to test saturation using PLS regression. This illustrative qualitative study aimed to investigate the impact of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) on nurses' work in the hospital and the results were published elsewhere (Guillemin et al. 2015). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 nurses. Saturation was characterized by the cumulative percentage of variability accounted for by PLS factors. After 12 interviews, this percentage was 51% which suggests that saturation was achieved at least on main themes. Two main themes identifying similarities in the experience of nurses caring for patients with CDI were identified: Organization/Coordination of the working day and Time-consuming work. Although dependent on the coding of qualitative data, PLS regression of quantitized data from qualitative interviews generated useful information for the determination of saturation."
https://openalex.org/W3035785903,"Cancer cells require extensive metabolic reprograming in order to provide the bioenergetics and macromolecular precursors needed to sustain a malignant phenotype. Mutant KRAS is a driver oncogene that is well-known for its ability to regulate the ERK and PI3K signaling pathways. However, it is now appreciated that KRAS can promote the tumor growth via upregulation of anabolic metabolism. We recently reported that oncogenic KRAS promotes a gene expression program of de novo lipogenesis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To define the mechanism(s) responsible, we focused on the lipogenic transcription factor SREBP1. We observed that KRAS increases SREBP1 expression and genetic knockdown of SREBP1 significantly inhibited the cell proliferation of mutant KRAS-expressing cells. Unexpectedly, lipogenesis was not significantly altered in cells subject to SREBP1 knockdown. Carbon tracing metabolic studies showed a significant decrease in oxidative phosphorylation and RNA-seq data revealed a significant decrease in mitochondrial encoded subunits of the electron transport chain (ETC). Taken together, these data support a novel role, distinct from lipogenesis, of SREBP1 on mitochondrial function in mutant KRAS NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W3035830820,"Tumor is a prevalent great threat to public health worldwide and multidrug resistance (MDR) of tumor is a leading cause of chemotherapy failure. Nanomedicine has shown prospects in overcoming the problem. Doxorubicin (DOX), a broad-spectrum anticancer drug, showed limited efficacy due to MDR. Herein, a doxorubicin containing pectin nanocell (DOX-PEC-NC) of core-shell structure, a pectin nanoparticle encapsulated with liposome-like membrane was developed. The DOX-PEC-NC, spheroid in shape and sized around 150 nm, exerted better sustained release behavior than doxorubicin loading pectin nanoparticle (DOX-PEC-NP) or liposome (DOX-LIP). In vitro anticancer study showed marked accumulation of doxorubicin in different tumor cells as well as reversal of MDR in HepG2/ADR cells and MCF-7/ADR cells caused by treatment of DOX-PEC-NC. In H22 tumor-bearing mice, DOX-PEC-NC showed higher anticancer efficacy and lower toxicity than doxorubicin. DOX-PEC-NC can improve anticancer activity and reduce side effect of doxorubicin due to increased intracellular accumulation and reversal of MDR in tumor cells, which may be a promising nanoscale drug delivery vehicle for chemotherapeutic agents."
https://openalex.org/W3036305165,"Abstract Cancer stem cells possess the capacity for self-renewal and resistance to chemotherapy. It is therefore crucial to understand the molecular regulators of stemness in the quest to develop effective cancer therapies. TAZ is a transcription activator that promotes stem cell functions in post-development mammalian cells; suppression of TAZ activity reduces or eliminates cancer stemness in select cancers. Isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase (ICMT) is the unique enzyme of the last step of posttranslational prenylation processing pathway that modifies several oncogenic proteins, including RAS. We found that suppression of ICMT results in reduced self-renewal/stemness in KRAS-driven pancreatic and breast cancer cells. Silencing of ICMT led to significant reduction of TAZ protein levels and loss of self-renewal ability, which could be reversed by overexpressing mutant KRAS, demonstrating the functional impact of ICMT modification on the ability of KRAS to control TAZ stability and function. Contrary to expectation, YAP protein levels appear to be much less susceptible than TAZ to the regulation by ICMT and KRAS, and YAP is less consequential in regulating stemness characteristics in these cells. Further, we found that the ICMT-dependent KRAS regulation of TAZ was mediated through RAF, but not PI3K, signaling. Functionally, we demonstrate that a signaling cascade from ICMT modification of KRAS to TAZ protein stability supports cancer cell self-renewal abilities in both in vitro and in vivo settings. In addition, studies using the proof-of-concept small molecule inhibitors of ICMT confirmed its role in regulating TAZ and self-renewal, demonstrating the potential utility of targeting ICMT to control aggressive KRAS-driven cancers."
https://openalex.org/W3036364287,"ERBB4 is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/ERBB subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases that regulates cellular processes including proliferation, migration, and survival. ERBB4 signaling is involved in embryogenesis and homeostasis of healthy adult tissues, but also in human pathologies such as cancer, neurological disorders, and cardiovascular diseases. Here, an MS-based analysis revealed the Vav guanine nucleotide exchange factor 3 (VAV3), an activator of Rho family GTPases, as a critical ERBB4-interacting protein in breast cancer cells. We confirmed the ERBB4–VAV3 interaction by targeted MS and coimmunoprecipitation experiments and further defined it by demonstrating that kinase activity and Tyr-1022 and Tyr-1162 of ERBB4, as well as the intact phosphotyrosine-interacting SH2 domain of VAV3, are necessary for this interaction. We found that ERBB4 stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of the VAV3 activation domain, known to be required for guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity of VAV proteins. In addition to VAV3, the other members of the VAV family, VAV1 and VAV2, also coprecipitated with ERBB4. Analyses of the effects of overexpression of dominant-negative VAV3 constructs or shRNA-mediated down-regulation of VAV3 expression in breast cancer cells indicated that active VAV3 is involved in ERBB4-stimulated cell migration.

These results define the VAV GEFs as effectors of ERBB4 activity in a signaling pathway relevant for cancer cell migration. ERBB receptors form the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/ERBB subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) that includes EGFR/ERBB1, ERBB2, ERBB3, and ERBB4. ERBB receptors are activated by the binding of EGF-like growth factors and transmit the growth factor signal into the activation of intracellular signaling cascades, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Through these phosphorylation-dependent signaling cascades ERBB receptors regulate proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival and play essential roles in embryogenesis and homeostasis of adult tissues. Abnormal ERBB signaling is a common feature of human pathologies such as cancer, neurological disorders, and cardiovascular diseases (1Yarden Y. Pines G.

ERBB4 is expressed as four isoforms that are generated by alternative mRNA splicing. Two of the isoforms differ structurally in the extracellular juxtamembrane region (JM-a and JM-b), and two differ in the intracellular cytoplasmic domain (CYT-1 and CYT-2). The JM-a isoform, but not the JM-b, includes a sequence with a cleavage site for tumor necrosis factor-α–converting enzyme (TACE). TACE cleavage triggers a second cleavage by γ-secretase complex, releasing ERBB4 intracellular domain (ICD) into the cytosol (2Elenius K. Corfas G. Paul S. Choi C.J. Rio C. Plowman G.D. Klagsbrun M.

Whereas the JM-a isoform is mostly expressed in epithelial tissues (such as those in the mammary gland and kidney) and the expression of JM-b is limited to mesenchymal tissues (such as heart and skeletal muscle), both CYT isoforms are usually expressed in the same cell types (8Veikkolainen V. Vaparanta K. Halkilahti K. Iljin K. Sundvall M. Elenius K. Function of ERBB4 is determined by alternative splicing.Cell Cycle. 2011; 10 (21811097): 2647-265710.4161/cc.10.16.17194Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). ERBB4 is also expressed in several cancer types, and both increased and decreased expression compared with nonneoplastic control tissue have been reported (9Hollmén M. Elenius K.

The presence of isoforms diversifies the signaling mechanisms of ERBB4. Indeed, some ERBB4 functions are known to be isoform-specific. Unlike CYT-2, the CYT-1 isoform, which couples with PI3K, promotes chemotaxis and lamellipodia formation in fibroblasts in a PI3K-dependent manner (10Kainulainen V. Sundvall M. Määttä J.A.

In addition to being more stable, the CYT-2 isoform is phosphorylated to a greater extent and has higher autokinase activity compared with CYT-1 (11Määttä J.A. Sundvall M. Junttila T.T. Peri L.

To characterize novel molecular components of ERBB4 signaling, we copurified ERBB4 JM-a CYT-1 and JM-a CYT-2–associating proteins from breast cancer cells and analyzed them by MS.

Intriguingly, VAV proteins contain phosphotyrosine-binding Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, and the VAV GEF activity requires tyrosine phosphorylation of their activation domain by kinases, including RTKs (17Bustelo X.R.

We confirmed the ERBB4-VAV3 interaction by targeted MS and coimmunoprecipitation experiments, showed that ERBB4 stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of the VAV3 activation domain, and demonstrated that VAV3 is involved in ERBB4-stimulated migration. These findings indicate that VAV GTPases are novel effectors of ERBB4 activity in a signaling pathway relevant for cancer cell migration. To identify novel ERBB4-interacting proteins, Strep-tagged ERBB4 constructs encoding the cleavable JM-a isoform of the CYT-1 or CYT-2 type were generated and stably transfected to MCF-7 breast cancer cells (Fig. 1A). Cells were lysed, and the lysates were subjected to Strep purification to pull down Strep-tagged ERBB4 and coprecipitating proteins. Strep-tactin precipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (Fig. 1B) followed by MS to identify proteins present in the precipitates. MS identified several proteins that copurified with Strep-tactin in ERBB4-expressing lysates, but not in lysates of vector control cells (Table S1). Whereas 10 of the ERBB4-copurifying proteins were detected in both CYT-1 and CYT-2 samples, 7 proteins were specifically identified in CYT-1 samples and 11 in CYT-2 samples (Fig. 1C). One of the proteins copurifying only with ERBB4 CYT-1 was phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase regulatory subunit α (P85A), which is known to interact with CYT-1 but not with the CYT-2 isoform (Fig. 1C) (5Elenius K. Choi C.J. Paul S. Santiestevan E. Nishi E. Klagsbrun M. Characterization of a naturally occurring ErbB4 isoform that does not bind or activate phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase.Oncogene. 1999; 18 (10353604): 2607-261510.1038/sj.onc.1202612Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). On the contrary, two signaling proteins known to associate with ERBB signaling complexes, ERBB2 and SOS1 (20Schulze W.X. Deng L. Mann M.

These data suggest that cytoplasmic ERBB4 isoforms have specific and shared interaction partners. Novel ERBB4 CYT-2–associating proteins included VAV3 (Fig. 1C), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rho GTPases (17Bustelo X.R. Vav family exchange factors: an integrated regulatory and functional view.Small GTPases. 2014; 5 (25483299): 9-1210.4161/21541248.2014.973757Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). As previous studies have identified certain RTKs as activators of VAV-mediated signaling (19Pandey A. Podtelejnikov A.V. Blagoev B. Bustelo X.R. Mann M. Lodish H.F. Analysis of receptor signaling pathways by mass spectrometry: identification of Vav-2 as a substrate of the epidermal and platelet-derived growth factor receptors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The MS data indicating a physical association of ERBB4 with VAV3 was controlled in a setting of endogenously expressed proteins. To this end, parental MCF-7 cells endogenously expressing moderate levels of both the JM-a CYT-1 and JM-a CYT-2 isoforms of ERBB4 (11Määttä J.A. Sundvall M. Junttila T.T. Peri L. Laine V.J.O.

ERBB4 expression and ligand-induced ERBB4 phosphorylation were demonstrated by Western analyses (Fig. S1A). Targeted MS confirmed the interaction between endogenously expressed proteins and indicated that VAV3 peptides were more abundant in NRG-1–treated samples (Fig. S1B), suggesting that ERBB4 activation promoted the ERBB4-VAV3 interaction. To further validate the ERBB4-VAV3 interaction, a series of coimmunoprecipitation assays was carried out. First, MYC-HIS–tagged VAV3 was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells together with constructs encoding JM-a CYT-1 or JM-a CYT-2 isoforms of ERBB4 (Fig. 2). Cell lysates were incubated with anti-ERBB4 antibody to immunoprecipitate ERBB4-interacting proteins, and the precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting. The interaction of ERBB4 CYT-2 and VAV3 was readily detected (Fig. 2, lane 4), confirming the results of MS. VAV3 also interacted with transiently expressed ERBB4 CYT-1 (Fig. 2, lane 2). In addition to full-length, ∼180-kDa ERBB4 receptor, the ∼75-kDa ERBB4 fragment (representing the ICD produced by proteolysis from the full-length receptor (3Rio C. Buxbaum J.D. Peschon J.J.

As the detected 75-kDa ERBB4 could represent either the TACE-processed receptor fragment still attached to the cell membrane or the soluble ICD released from the membrane by γ-secretase, a coimmunoprecipitation experiment employing a construct encoding only the ICD fragment of ERBB4 was carried out. Interaction of the ERBB4 ICD and VAV3 was again readily detected, indicating that the soluble ICD is sufficient to mediate the ERBB4-VAV3 interaction (Fig. 3A, lane 2).

Similar results were obtained when the soluble ERBB4 ICD was expressed instead of full-length ERBB4 receptor (Fig. 3A). In agreement with the phosphotyrosine-binding function of SH2 domains, a kinase-dead ERBB4 construct that is not tyrosine-phosphorylated (K751R (12Sundvall M. Peri L. Määttä J.A. Tvorogov D.

Next, we set to determine the ERBB4 tyrosine residue(s) required for the interaction. The association of ERBB4 phosphopeptides with different SH2 domains has been analyzed in two studies.

To determine the role of these tyrosines in mediating the ERBB4-VAV3 interaction, tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutant ERBB4 constructs were generated and analyzed for their ability to interact with VAV3 in a series of coimmunoprecipitation assays. Both Y1022F and Y1162F mutations disrupted the efficient interaction detected between WT ERBB4 and VAV3, indicating that these ERBB4 tyrosines were required for VAV3 docking (Fig. 3D). However, the interaction of ERBB4 Y1208F (Fig. S2A), Y1258F (Fig. S2A), and Y1202F (Fig. S2B) with VAV3 was comparable with that of WT ERBB4, demonstrating that these ERBB4 tyrosines were not necessary for the interaction. Together, these data validate the ERBB4-VAV3 interaction detected in the MS analyses of ERBB4-copurifying proteins and demonstrate that the interaction requires the SH2 domain of VAV3 as well as ERBB4 phosphotyrosines 1022 and 1162. Three VAV genes (VAV1, VAV2, and VAV3) form the human VAV family (17Bustelo X.R. Vav family exchange factors: an integrated regulatory and functional view.Small GTPases. 2014; 5 (25483299): 9-1210.4161/21541248.2014.973757Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). All VAV proteins have a highly similar structure, including a conserved SH2 domain (17Bustelo X.R. Vav family exchange factors: an integrated regulatory and functional view.Small GTPases. 2014; 5 (25483299): 9-1210.4161/21541248.2014.973757Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To study the putative interactions of ERBB4 with VAV1 and VAV2 in addition to VAV3, COS-7 cells were transfected with HA-tagged VAV proteins together with MYC-tagged ERBB4 JM-a CYT-2, and lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-ERBB4 antibody (Fig. 4). Western blotting analyses of the coprecipitates indicated that besides VAV3, ERBB4 also interacted with ectopically expressed VAV1 and VAV2 (Fig. 4). VAV GEF activity requires tyrosine phosphorylation of specific residues within the VAV activation domain (17Bustelo X.R. Vav family exchange factors: an integrated regulatory and functional view.Small GTPases. 2014; 5 (25483299): 9-1210.4161/21541248.2014.973757Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To assess the ability of ERBB4 to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of VAV3, in vitro kinase assays were carried out. COS-7 cells were transfected with empty vector or a vector encoding VAV3, and VAV3 was immunoprecipitated from the lysates. The precipitates were incubated without or with Strep-purified ERBB4 ICD and ATP and analyzed by Western blotting using a phosphotyrosine antibody. Tyrosine-phosphorylated VAV3 was clearly detected as an ∼100 kDa band in the sample containing ERBB4 ICD and ATP (Fig. 5A, lane 3). Autophosphorylated ERBB4 ICD was also detected as a band migrating at ∼80 kDa (Fig. 5A, lanes 1 and 3). To confirm the ability of ERBB4 to stimulate VAV3 phosphorylation, ERBB4 and VAV3 were coexpressed in COS-7 cells. VAV3 was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates, and tyrosine phosphorylation was analyzed by Western blotting using a phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 5B). As in the in vitro kinase assay, a phosphotyrosine-reactive band of ∼100 kDa was detected when both ERBB4 and VAV3 were expressed (Fig. 5B, lane 4). To study whether ERBB4 could stimulate the phosphorylation of specific VAV3 tyrosines required for the GEF activity, a VAV3 construct containing two tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutations in conserved activation domain tyrosine residues (Tyr-160 and -173) was generated (17Bustelo X.R. Vav family exchange factors: an integrated regulatory and functional view.Small GTPases. 2014; 5 (25483299): 9-1210.4161/21541248.2014.973757Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 26Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Biological and regulatory properties of Vav-3, a new member of the Vav family of oncoproteins.Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19 (10523675): 7870-788510.1128/mcb.19.11.7870Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). A third activation domain tyrosine residue (Tyr-164) was also mutated based on a prediction of likely phosphorylation sites by the Scansite tool (RRID:SCR_007026). A phosphotyrosine-reactive band representing tyrosine-phosphorylated WT VAV3 was again detected upon ERBB4 coexpression (Fig. 5C, lane 6). However, no VAV3 phosphorylation was detected when the triple tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutant VAV3 was expressed instead of the WT, suggesting that ERBB4 could indeed stimulate the phosphorylation of the activation domain tyrosines (Fig. 5C, lane 8). Likewise, no phosphotyrosine-reactive band of VAV3 R697L was detected, confirming that physical interaction of ERBB4 and VAV3 was required for the ability of ERBB4 to stimulate the phosphorylation (Fig. 5C, lane 7). To study the role of each of the three tyrosines in the VAV3 activation domain (Tyr-160, -164, and -173), single tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutants were generated. Coexpression of the single and triple tyrosine-to-phenylalanine VAV3 mutants together with ERBB4 in COS-7 cells demonstrated that, whereas all of the 3 tyrosines contributed to VAV3 phosphorylation, Tyr-160 was the predominant site of ERBB4-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 5D). To further characterize the role of the three VAV3 activation domain tyrosines for VAV3 signaling activity, the single and triple tyrosine-to-phenylalanine VAV3 mutants were coexpressed with ERBB4 in MCF-7 cells. To this end, we hypothesized that—if VAV3 activation by tyrosine phosphorylation was critical for its downstream signaling—the tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutant VAV3 constructs should exhibit a dominant-negative effect on this signaling when overexpressed. As myosin light chain (MLC) is phosphorylated upon activation of the Rho family of GTPases (27Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Chihara K. Nakano T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K.

Consistent with the observations of VAV3 phosphorylation (Fig. 5D), Y160F was the most efficient of the single mutants in reducing NRG-1–stimulated increase in MLC phosphorylation, whereas overexpression of the triple mutant Y160F/Y164F/Y173F abolished the effect (Fig. 5E). These results indicate that ERBB4 stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of VAV3 and that Tyr-160 is the major tyrosine residue phosphorylated by ERBB4.

Waterpipe tobacco smoking has become a global trend of tobacco consumption and is as common as cigarette smoking. In this study, the effect of waterpipe tobacco smoke (WTS) on the development of metabolic syndrome in rats was evaluated. Adult Wistar rats were exposed for 19 weeks to either fresh air (control) or WTS for 1 hour daily/ 5 days per week (WTS). Central obesity, systolic blood pressure, lipid profile, glucose hemostasis and levels of leptin and adiponectin were evaluated. The WTS exposure increased body weight, abdominal circumference, systolic blood pressure and fasting glucose compared to control animals (P<0.05), consistent with inducing metabolic syndrome. The retroperitoneal fat, lipid profile and levels of insulin, leptin and adiponectin were not affected by WTS exposure (P>0.05). In conclusion, exposure to WTS has detrimental health effects leading to the development of metabolic syndrome in experimental animals."
https://openalex.org/W3036046448,"Background Several studies have previously demonstrated that higher systolic blood pressure level means lower risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. However, there is a lack of further investigation into the nonlinear relationship between admission systolic blood pressure (SBP) and adverse outcomes of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients. Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate the specific relationship between admission SBP and incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in 30 days for AMI patients. Methods and results Using data from the ACS-QUIK trial, we analyzed 21,364 patients from Kerala, India. In univariate linear-regression model, the OR was 0.90 per 10mmHg, the confidence interval (CI) was 95% (0.87–0.92) and P < 0.0001. The generalized additive model (GAM) showed a nearly U-shaped curve between admission SBP and MACE. Using a two-piecewise linear regression model, we calculated an inflection point of 159 mmHg. We found that the higher admission SBP is associated with lower incidence of MACE of AMI patients. In addition, subgroups with different LVEF have distinct effects on blood pressure-related outcomes. Lower SBP has a greater risk when LVEF < 40%. Conclusion The present study revealed the U-shaped relationship between admission SBP and the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcome. The admission SBP could be a marker to provide clinical assessment and treatment. Trial registration URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT02256657"
https://openalex.org/W3036370269,"Distal limb wounds are common injuries sustained by horses and their healing is fraught with complications due to equine anatomy, prevalence of infection, and challenges associated with wound management. Gallium is a semi-metallic element that has been shown to possess antimicrobial properties and aid in wound healing in various preclinical models. The effects of Gallium have not been studied in equine wound healing. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare healing rates between gallium-treated and untreated wounds of equine distal limbs and to demonstrate the antimicrobial effects of gallium on wounds inoculated with S. aureus. Using an established model of equine wound healing we demonstrated beneficial effects of 0.5% topical gallium maltolate on equine wound healing. Specifically we documented reduced healing times, reduced bioburden, and reduced formation of exuberant granulation tissue in wounds treated with gallium maltolate as compared with untreated wounds. Gallium appeared to exert its beneficial effects via its well-described antimicrobial actions as well as by altering the expression of specific genes known to be involved in wound healing of horses and other animals. Specifically, gallium maltolate appeared to increase expression of transforming growth factor-β in both infected and un-infected wounds. Further work is needed to document the effects of gallium on naturally occurring equine wounds and to compare the effects of gallium with other wound treatment options. These data, however, suggest that gallium may be an attractive and novel means of improving equine distal limb wound healing."

We hypothesized that S. aureus isolates from implant-associated infections (IAIs) would differ in MSCRAMM profile and biofilm formation in vitro compared to skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) isolates. Methods Pediatric patients and their isolates were identified retrospectively. IAI and SSTI isolates were matched (1:4). Pulsed field gel electrophoresis was performed to group isolates as USA300 vs. non-USA300. Whole genome sequencing was performed and raw sequence data were interrogated for presence of MSCRAMMs (clfA, clfB, cna, ebh, efb, fnbpA, fnbpB, isdA, isdB, sdrC, sdrD, sdrE), biofilm-associated (icaA,D,B,C), and Panton-Valentine leukocidin (lukSF-PV) genes, accessory gene regulator group, and multilocus sequence types. In vitro biofilm formation was assessed for 47 IAI and 47 SSTI isolates using a microtiter plate assay. Conditional logistic regression was performed for analysis of matched data (STATA11, College Station, TX). Results Forty-seven IAI and 188 SSTI isolates were studied. IAI isolates were more often methicillin susceptible S. aureus and non-USA300 vs. SSTI isolates [34 (72%) vs. 79 (42%), p = 0.001 and 38 (81%) vs. 57 (30%) p <0.001, respectively]. Greater than 98% of isolates carried clfA, clfB, efb, isdA, isdB, and icaA,D,B,C while cna was more frequently found among IAI vs. SSTI isolates (p = 0.003). Most isolates were strong biofilm producers. Conclusions S. aureus IAI isolates were significantly more likely to be MSSA and non-USA300 than SSTI isolates. Carriage of MSCRAMMs and biofilm formation did not differ significantly between isolates. Evaluation of genetic polymorphisms and gene expression profiles are needed to further delineate the role of adhesins in the pathogenesis of IAIs."
https://openalex.org/W3035893338,"Even though there are different tuberculosis (TB) prevention and control measures implemented globally including Ethiopia, TB is still major public health problem. This is partly due to compromised quality of care delivered for tuberculosis patients in health facilities (HFs) during diagnosis, treatment and follows-up. Thus this study is intended to determine the quality of care delivered for TB patients in all public HFs of Debre Tabor town, Northwest Ethiopia.Cross sectional study was conducted from January to May 2018. Data were collected with face-to-face interview and TB registration book review using structured questionnaire and checklist respectively. Collected data was entered and processed using SPSS and P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The quality of care for each HF was graded as very good, good, moderate, poor and very poor if HFs achieve [90-100%], [80-90%), [70-80%), [60-70%) and <60% of performance indicators respectively using Donabedian structure, process and outcome model of health care quality.All HFs have sputum collection area, enough microscopic slide, at least one functional microscope and sufficient anti TB drug supply. But HFs lack backup laboratory stains. Overall structural aspects of quality of care in all HFs were very poor achieving 42.5-52.9% structural performance indicators out of 100%. Similarly the overall process aspects of quality of care was poor in all public HFs which achieved 60-68.9% of the scores out of 100%. In the study; 68.9%, 54.5% and 80.6% of Medical Laboratory, pharmacy and other healthcare workers (HWs) provided correct response respectively on TB causative agent, risk factor, transmission, treatment, prevention, case management and case finding strategies. HWs who knew at least two TB case finding strategies in DTH was significantly higher than those HWs working in Health Centers (P = 0.004). On the other hand, except Ginbot 20 HC, HFs was graded as good by scoring 86.6-89.3% of performance indicators on the outcome aspects of quality of care. In all HFs studied, all TB patients' unit TB registration number, sex, age, TB category, treatment initiation date and intensive phase treatment start year were properly registered. Moreover 110 (78%) and 147 (69%) contact person address in DTH and HCs was properly registered on TB unit register book respectively with no statistical difference in hospital and HCs (P = 0.063). There was proper TB patients' address registration in hospital than HCs studied (P< 0.001).The outcome aspects of quality of care for TB patients in all HFs were promising. But structural & process aspects of quality of care was compromised which necessitate different corrective actions to be taken by different stakeholders to enhance quality of care for TB patients in public HFs studied. Moreover based on the study findings, continuous supply of drugs, laboratory equipment and reagents, availing current guideline/s in HFs, providing up-to-date training for HWs on TB and proper documentation are important to improve quality of care provided for TB patients."
https://openalex.org/W3036205064,"Evidence indicate that the brain-specific protein, brevican, is proteolytically cleaved during neurodegeneration, hence positioning fragments of brevican as potential blood biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases, such as dementia. We aimed to develop two assays capable of detecting the brevican N-terminal (N-Brev) and the ADAMTS4-generated fragment (Brev-A), cleaved at Ser401, in serum and to perform a preliminary assessment of their diagnostic potential in dementias. Monoclonal antibodies against N-Brev and Brev-A were used to develop two ELISAs detecting each epitope. A comparison of brevican fragments in serum from individuals with AD (n = 28), other dementia (OD) (n = 41), and non-dementia-related memory complaints (NDCs) (n = 48) was conducted. Anti-N-Brev and anti-Brev-A antibodies selectively recognized their targets and dilution and spike recoveries were within limits of ±20%. Intra- and inter-assay CVs were below limits of 10% and 15%, respectively. For the N-Brev biomarker, serum from patients with OD showed significantly lower levels than those with AD (p = 0.05) and NDCs (p < 0.01). The opposite pattern was evident for Brev-A: serum levels in patients with OD were significantly higher than for AD (p = 0.04) and NDCs (p = 0.01). For both N-Brev and Brev-A, levels did not differ between AD and NDCs. The ratio of N-Brev/Brev-A resulted in increased significant differences between OD and AD (p < 0.01) and between OD and NDCs (p < 0.0001). The ratio discriminated between NDCs and OD (AUC: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.65-0.85, p < 0.0001) and between OD and AD (AUC: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.59-0.85, p < 0.01). In conclusion, we developed the first assays detecting the N-terminal of brevican as well as an ADAMTS4-cleaved fragment of brevican in blood. Differential levels of N-Brev and Brev-A between AD and OD allow for these biomarkers to possibly distinguish between different forms of dementias."
https://openalex.org/W3036580272,"Temperate savannas and grasslands are globally threatened. In the Midwest United States of America (USA), for example, oak savannas persist today at a small percentage of recent historic coverage. Therefore, restoration of habitats of low and intermediate canopy cover is a landscape conservation priority that often emphasizes returning tree density to a savanna-like target value. Understanding how animal species react to such changes in vegetation structure is important for assessing the value of these restoration plans. We examined how butterfly community attributes in northwest Indiana USA, including community composition, richness, and abundance responded to a grassland-to-forest gradient of canopy cover. Butterfly community composition under intermediate canopy cover differed significantly from community composition in the most open or closed-canopy habitats. Composition of the plant community in flower was a significant predictor of three assessed attributes of the butterfly community—composition, richness, and abundance. Phenology, expressed as day-of-the-year, was also a strong predictor of these butterfly community attributes. Few butterfly species were habitat specialists as adults although canopy cover was a more important predictor of adult community composition than of richness or abundance of butterflies. Therefore, adult butterfly community differences along the canopy cover gradient were less about butterfly communities filled with habitat specialists for different canopy-defined habitats and more about gradual changes in community composition along this gradient. Overall, butterfly community richness was predicted to peak at about 34% canopy cover, butterfly abundance at about 53% canopy cover, community conservation value at about 59% canopy cover, and a combination of desirable conservation attributes–high diversity, high abundance, and high conservation value–was predicted to reach a peak of co-occurrence at about 67% canopy cover suggesting that habitats of intermediate canopy cover might be particularly effective for butterfly conservation in this region."
https://openalex.org/W3036657571,"Proteinuria and hyperphosphatemia are risk factors for cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although the interaction between proteinuria and the serum phosphate level is well established, the mechanistic link between the two, particularly the extent to which this interaction is mediated by phosphate-regulating factors, remains poorly understood. In this study, we examined the association between proteinuria and the serum phosphate level, as well as potential mediators, including circulating fibroblast growth factor (FGF23)/klotho, the 24-h urinary phosphate excretion rate to glomerular filtration rate ratio (EP/GFR), and the 24-h tubular phosphate reabsorption rate to GFR ratio (TRP/GFR). The analyses were performed with data from 1793 patients in whom 24-h urine protein and phosphate, serum phosphate, FGF23, and klotho levels were measured simultaneously, obtained from the KoreaN cohort study for Outcome in patients With Chronic Kidney Disease (KNOW-CKD). Multivariable linear regression and mediation analyses were performed. Total, direct, and indirect effects were also estimated. Patients with high serum phosphate levels were found to be more likely to exhibit greater proteinuria, higher FGF23 levels, and lower klotho levels. The 24-h EP/GFR increased and the 24-h TRP/GFR decreased with increasing proteinuria and CKD progression. Simple mediation analyses showed that 15.4% and 67.9% of the relationship between proteinuria and the serum phosphate level were mediated by the FGF23/klotho ratio and 24-h EP/GFR, respectively. Together, these two factors accounted for 73.1% of the relationship between serum markers. These findings suggest that proteinuria increases the 24-h EP/GFR via the FGF23/klotho axis as a compensatory mechanism for the increased phosphate burden well before the reduction in renal function is first seen."
https://openalex.org/W3036033390,"Male dogs are often castrated based on the thought that it facilitates well-behavedness. However, the causal evidence for this from prospective studies lacks and the existing associative studies present mixed results depending on the studied behaviours. We aimed to gain insight into possible factors driving an owner's decision to castrate their male dog, through a quantitative survey based on a convenience sample. We determined the advice owners received from three types of dog professionals (veterinarian practitioners, behavioural trainers, behavioural therapists) and the owners' assessments of castration's behavioural effects. Data on 491 Dutch owners of castrated and intact male dogs were analysed with Chi-square tests. Results indicate that owners of both castrated and intact dogs received castration advice most often from veterinarian practitioners, with pro-castration at higher frequencies for owners of castrated dogs (Chi-square, P<0.001). Overall, most owners disagreed with or were neutral about statements on castration positively affecting male dog behaviour at a population level. Nevertheless, 58% (N = 145) of the owners of castrated dogs (N = 249) reported that correcting unwanted behaviour was a reason to castrate their own male dog. Unwanted behaviour involved aggression in 50% (N = 70) of the owner-dog dyads. Castrated dog's aggression changes were reported on most as 'no change'. The second most common answer indicated an aggression decrease in dogs castrated to correct unwanted behaviour and an increase in dogs castrated for other reasons (Chi-square, P<0.001). The increase in aggression in a subset of castrated dogs is concerning, as aggression can pose risks to the dog's welfare. We acknowledge the limitations of our study which identifies associations rather than provides causal evidence. Still, we recommend professionals' awareness of possible negative behavioural changes following castration, like increased aggression. Future research on behavioural consequences of castrating dogs needs to build a more solid knowledge base for balanced advice regarding castration."
https://openalex.org/W3036954082,"In May 2016, the remote-controlled Automated Filtration System for Marine Microbes (AUTOFIM) was implemented in parallel to the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) observatory Helgoland Roads in the German Bight. We collected samples for characterization of dynamics within the eukaryotic microbial communities at the end of a phytoplankton bloom via 18S meta-barcoding. Understanding consequences of environmental change for key marine ecosystem processes, such as phytoplankton bloom dynamics requires information on biodiversity and species occurrences with adequate temporal and taxonomic resolution via time series observations. Sampling automation and molecular high throughput methods can serve these needs by improving the resolution of current conventional marine time series observations. A technical evaluation based on an investigation of eukaryotic microbes using the partial 18S rRNA gene suggests that automated filtration with the AUTOFIM device and preservation of the plankton samples leads to highly similar 18S community profiles, compared to manual filtration and snap freezing. The molecular data were correlated with conventional microscopic counts. Overall, we observed substantial change in the eukaryotic microbial community structure during the observation period. A simultaneous decline of diatom and ciliate sequences succeeded a peak of Miracula helgolandica, suggesting a potential impact of these oomycete parasites on diatom bloom dynamics and phenology in the North Sea. As oomycetes are not routinely counted at Helgoland Roads LTER, our findings illustrate the benefits of combining automated filtration with metabarcodingto augment classical time series observations, particularly for taxa currently neglected due to methodological constraints."
https://openalex.org/W3036720532,"Understanding how neonicotinoid insecticides affect non-target arthropods, especially pollinators, is an area of high priority and popular debate. Few studies have considered how pollinators interact and detect neonicotinoids, and almost none have examined for these effects in anthophilous Diptera such as hover flies (Syrphidae). We investigated behavioral responses of two species of hover flies, Eristalis arbustorum L. (Eristalinae) and Toxomerus marginatus Say (Syrphinae), when given a choice between artificial flowers with uncontaminated sucrose solution and neonicotinoid-contaminated (clothianidin) sucrose solution at field-realistic levels 2.5 ppb (average) and 150 ppb (high). We examined for 1) evidence that wild-caught flies could detect the insecticide gustatorily by analyzing amount of time spent feeding on floral treatments, and 2) whether flies could discriminate floral treatments visually by comparing visitation rates, spectral reflectance differences, and hover fly photoreceptor sensitivities. We did not find evidence that either species fed more or less on either of the treatment solutions. Furthermore, T. marginatus did not appear to visit one of the flower choices over the other. Eristalis arbustorum, however, visited uncontaminated flowers more often than contaminated flowers. Spectral differences between the flower treatments overlap with Eristalis photoreceptor sensitivities, opening the possibility that E. arbustorum could discriminate sucrose-clothianidin solution visually. The relevance of our findings in field settings are uncertain but they do highlight the importance of visual cues in lab-based choice experiments involving insecticides. We strongly encourage further research in this area and the consideration of both behavioral responses and sensory mechanisms when determining insecticidal impacts on beneficial arthropods."
https://openalex.org/W3036200996,"Findings on the association between health literacy and anti-retroviral (ARV) adherence are inconsistent. Health literacy is usually operationalized with simple tests of basic literacy, but more complex conceptions of health literacy include content knowledge. People living with chronic illness also conceptualize and experience illness in ways other than biomedical or mechanistic models of disease.There are no instruments that comprehensively assess knowledge of people living with HIV concerning HIV disease and treatment; or psychological adjustment to being HIV+. Little is known about the relationship between factual knowledge, or positive identification as HIV+, and anti-retroviral (ARV) adherence.Formative work with in-depth semi-structured interviews, and cognitive testing, to develop a structured instrument assessing HIV-related knowledge, and personal meanings of living with HIV. Pilot administration of the instrument to a convenience sample of 101 respondents.Respondents varied considerably in their expressed need for in-depth knowledge, the accuracy of their understanding of relevant scientific concepts and facts about ARV treatment, and psychological adjustment and acceptance of HIV+ status. Most knowledge domains were not significantly related to self-reported ARV adherence, but accurate knowledge specifically about ARV treatment was (r = 0.25, p = .02), as was an adapted version of the Need for Cognition scale (r = .256, p = .012). Negative feelings about living with HIV (r = .33, p = .0012), and medication taking (r = .276, p = .008) were significantly associated with non-adherence.The instrument may be useful in diagnosing addressable reasons for non-adherence, as a component of psychoeducational interventions, and for evaluation of such interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3036846162,"Effective adoption of genetics in clinical practice requires the support of and interaction between the different partners of healthcare system; healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients. The study aimed to assess and compare the knowledge, factors affecting the knowledge, and concerns of HCPs and patients regarding genetic-related issues such as lack of knowledge about genetics and genetic conditions, awareness of the importance of genetics in clinical practice and genetic services and resources deficits. A cross sectional study was conducted in different areas of Jordan using a convenient sampling approach. An English questionnaire was self-administered to HCPs. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with patients in Arabic by trained researcher. A total of 1000 HCPs and 1448 patients were recruited. There was a significant difference (p<0.001) in the knowledge between HCPs and patients. Among HCPs, physicians (OR = 2.278, 95%CI = 1.410–3.680, p = 0.001) and pharmacists (OR = 2.163, 95%CI = 1.362–3.436, p = 0.001) were more knowledgeable than nurses. In addition, females were more knowledgeable than males (OR = 1.717, 95%CI = 1.203–2.451, p = 0.003). Among patients, participants who had a bachelor degree (OR = 1.579, 95%CI = 1.231–2.025, p<0.001) were more knowledgeable compared to those who only had school education. HCPs appeared to have more concerns than patients (p<0.001) regarding all genetic-related issues. These findings suggested a positive association between education and genetic knowledge as well as concerns; as HCPs were more knowledgeable and concerned than patients. Appropriate integration and expansion of basic genetic knowledge courses and clinical genetic training in the curriculum should be adopted to prepare HCPs to enhance the integration of genetic information in clinical settings."
https://openalex.org/W3036537517,"On-line tutorials are being increasingly used in medical education, including in teaching housestaff skills regarding end of life care. Recently an on-line tutorial incorporating interactive clinical vignettes and communication skills was used to prepare housestaff at Johns Hopkins Hospital to use the Maryland Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (MOLST) form, which documents patient preferences regarding end of life care. 40% of housestaff who viewed the module felt less than comfortable discussing choices on the MOLST with patients. We sought to understand factors beyond knowledge that contributed to housestaff discomfort in MOLST discussions despite successfully completing an on-line tutorial.We conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with 18 housestaff who completed the on-line MOLST training module. Housestaff participants demonstrated good knowledge of legal and regulatory issues related to the MOLST compared to their peers, but reported feeling less than comfortable discussing the MOLST with patients. Transcripts of interviews were coded using thematic analysis to describe barriers to using the MOLST and suggestions for improving housestaff education about end of life care discussions.Qualitative analysis showed three major factors contributing to lack of housestaff comfort completing the MOLST form: [1] physician barriers to completion of the MOLST, [2] perceived patient barriers to completion of the MOLST, and [3] design characteristics of the MOLST form. Housestaff recommended a number of adaptations for improvement, including in-person training to improve their skills conducting conversations regarding end of life preferences with patients.Some housestaff who scored highly on knowledge tests after completing a formal on-line curriculum on the MOLST form reported barriers to using a mandated form despite receiving training. On-line modules may be insufficient for teaching communication skills to housestaff. Additional training opportunities including in-person training mechanisms should be incorporated into housestaff communication skills training related to end of life care."
https://openalex.org/W3036759787,"A functional Non-Tandem Duplicated Cluster (FNTDC) is a group of non-tandem-duplicated genes that are located closer than expected by mere chance and have a role in the same biological function. The identification of secondary-compounds–related FNTDC has gained increased interest in recent years, but little ab-initio attempts aiming to the identification of FNTDCs covering all biological functions, including primary metabolism compounds, have been carried out. We report an extensive FNTDC dataset accompanied by a detailed assessment on parameters used for genome scanning and their impact on FNTDC detection. We propose 70% identity and 70% alignment coverage as intermediate settings to exclude tandem duplicated genes and a dynamic scanning window of 24 genes. These settings were applied to rice, arabidopsis and grapevine genomes to call for FNTDCs. Besides the best-known secondary metabolism clusters, we identified many FNTDCs associated to primary metabolism ranging from macromolecules synthesis/editing, TOR signalling, ubiquitination, proton and electron transfer complexes. Using the intermediate FNTDC setting parameters (at P-value 1e-6), 130, 70 and 140 candidate FNTDCs were called in rice, arabidopsis and grapevine, respectively, and 20 to 30% of GO tags associated to called FNTDC were common among the 3 genomes. The datasets developed along with this work provide a rich framework for pinpointing candidate FNTDCs reflecting all GO-BP tags covering both primary and secondary metabolism with large macromolecular complexes/metabolons as the most represented FNTDCs. Noteworthy, several FNTDCs are tagged with GOs referring to organelle-targeted multi-enzyme complex, a finding that suggest the migration of endosymbiont gene chunks towards nuclei could be at the basis of these class of candidate FNTDCs. Most FNTDC appear to have evolved prior of genome duplication events. More than one-third of genes interspersed/adjacent to called FNTDCs lacked any functional annotation; however, their co-localization may provide hints towards a candidate biological role."
