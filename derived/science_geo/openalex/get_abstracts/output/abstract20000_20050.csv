https://openalex.org/W1967087917,"How does the brain represent objects in the world? A proportion of cells in the temporal cortex of monkeys responds specifically to objects, such as faces, but the type of coding used by these cells is not known. Population analysis of two sets of such cells showed that information is carried at the level of the population and that this information relates, in the anterior inferotemporal cortex, to the physical properties of face stimuli and, in the superior temporal polysensory area, to other aspects of the faces, such as their familiarity. There was often sufficient information in small populations of neurons to identify particular faces. These results suggest that representations of complex stimuli in the higher visual areas may take the form of a sparse population code."
https://openalex.org/W1924175076,"We have found that the form of glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa (integrin alpha IIb beta 3) expressed on nonstimulated platelets is a functional receptor that mediates selective and irreversible adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen. This occurs even in the presence of the elevated intracellular cAMP levels induced by prostaglandin E1 or after inhibition of protein kinase C activity by sphingosine. In the absence of inhibitors, platelets adhering to fibrinogen through GP IIb-IIIa become fully and aggregate with one another. Immobilized von Willebrand factor (vWF), in contrast, is recognized by nonstimulated platelets through another receptor, GP Ib. This interaction leads to a change in the ligand recognition specificity of GP IIb-IIIa that can then bind to immobilized vWF and mediate irreversible platelet adhesion and aggregation; this process, however, is inhibited by elevated intracellular cAMP levels or blockade of protein kinase C activity. Therefore, GP Ib and GP IIb-IIIa induce platelet activation through the selective recognition of immobilized vWF and fibrinogen, respectively, in the absence of exogenous agonists. Moreover, nonactivated and activated GP IIb-IIIa exhibits distinctly different reactivity toward surface-bound vWF, and the functional switch can be induced by the binding of vWF to GP Ib. These findings demonstrate the modulation of platelet function by two different adhesion receptors, GP Ib and GP IIb-IIIa, as well as the distinct dual role of the latter as the necessary common mediator of irreversible adhesion and aggregation on both fibrinogen and vWF."
https://openalex.org/W1577032310,"All clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus contain an extra penicillin binding protein (PBP) 2A in addition to four PBPs present in all staphylococcal strains. This extra PBP is thought to be a transpeptidase essential for the continued cell wall synthesis and growth in the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics. As an approach of testing this hypothesis we compared the muropeptide composition of cell walls of a highly methicillin-resistant S. aureus strain containing PBP2A and its isogenic Tn551 derivative with reduced methicillin resistance, which contained no PBP2A because of the insertional inactivation of the PBP2A gene. Purified cell walls were hydrolyzed into muropeptides which were subsequently resolved by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and identified by chemical and mass spectrometric analysis. The peptidoglycan composition of the two strains were identical. Both peptidoglycans were highly cross-linked mainly through pentaglycine cross-bridges, although other, chemically distinct peptide cross-bridges were also present including mono-, tri-, and tetraglycine; alanine; and alanyl-tetraglycine. Our experiments provided no experimental data for a unique transpeptidase activity associated with PBP2A."
https://openalex.org/W1985307483,"During replication, hepatitis delta virus (HDV) switches from production of small to large delta antigen. Both antigen isoforms have an HDV genome binding domain and are packaged into hepatitis B virus (HBV)-derived envelopes but differ at their carboxyl termini. The large antigen was shown to contain a terminal CXXX box and undergo prenylation. The large, but not the small, antigen formed secreted particles when expressed singly with HBV surface antigen. Mutation of Cys211 in the CXXX box of the large antigen abolished both prenylation and particle formation, suggesting that this site is important for virion morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1529141138,"Existing data support the hypothesis that insulin triggers the exocytosis of small vesicles containing the GluT4 isoform of the glucose transporter. The data also suggest that these vesicles reform through endocytosis of GluT4. These processes resemble those described for synaptic vesicles after depolarization of nerve cells. To determine whether GluT4 vesicles are related to synaptic vesicles, rat adipocyte low density microsomes (LDM), which are rich in GluT4 vesicles, were screened for the synaptic vesicle proteins synaptotagmin, synaptophysin, SV2, p29, rab3, and VAMP (synaptobrevin) by immunoblotting. Two polypeptides that reacted with antibodies against the VAMPs were identified, one with the same apparent size as the two isoforms of VAMP in the brain (18 kDa) and one that was slightly smaller (17 kDa). These members of the VAMP family were highly enriched in GluT4 vesicles isolated by immunoadsorption and translocated from the LDM to the plasma membrane in response to insulin. With the exception of rab3, which was observed in the LDM but was not localized in the GluT4 vesicles, the other synaptic vesicle proteins were not detected. The presence of the VAMPs in both GluT4 and synaptic vesicles suggests that the genesis and/or exocytosis of these two types of vesicles involve shared processes."
https://openalex.org/W1575557511,"Recent purification and amino-terminal analysis of the isoform of prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase (PGS) induced in rat preovulatory follicles by gonadotropins identified it as a novel distinct isoform of PGS (rPGSi) which exhibited a high degree of homology to the deduced sequence of PGS-related cDNAs recently cloned in chicken and mice. To further verify the similarities of these novel gene products and to examine the hormonal regulation of rPGSi mRNA in ovarian cells, three different in vivo and in vitro models were used. Northern blots using a cDNA encoding the mouse homologue of rPGSi detected a 4.4-kilobase transcript which was rapidly but transiently induced in granulosa cells of preovulatory follicles exposed in vivo to an ovulatory dose of human chorionic gonadotropin. The rPGSi mRNA was undetectable at 0 h, peaked 4 h after human chorionic gonadotropin, and had almost disappeared by 6 h. Increases in rPGSi protein (immunoblots) lagged by about 1 h, peaked at 5 h, and remained present at 11 h. PGSi mRNA and protein were also induced in a time- and dose-dependent manner when preovulatory follicles were isolated and incubated with elevated levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (500 ng/ml) or luteinizing hormone (500 ng/ml), or when differentiated granulosa cell cultures were stimulated with follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, or with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (10(-6) M). In both in vitro systems, rPGSi mRNA peaked at 4-5 h. When the same RNA samples were probed with the mouse cDNA encoding the other PGS isoform, no mRNA transcripts (2.8 kilobases) were observed. These results show for the first time that a rapid and transient induction of mRNA encoding a novel PGS enzyme occurs in granulosa cells of preovulatory follicles prior to ovulation and that results in vitro closely mimicked those in vivo and thereby provide models for studying the molecular mechanisms of rPGSi gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2060559354,"The specific function of the glomerular structures present in the antennal lobes or olfactory bulbs of organisms ranging from insects to humans has been obscure because of limitations in neuronal marking methods. By tracing individual neurons in the moth Agrotis segetum, it was determined that physiologically distinct types of pheromone receptor neurons project axons to different regions of the macroglomerular complex (MGC). Each glomerulus making up the MGC has a specific functional identity, initially processing information about one specific pheromone component. This indicates that, at least through the first stage of synapses, olfactory information moves through labeled lines."
https://openalex.org/W1527043413,"The eukaryotic transcription factor TFIID recognizes and binds a promoter sequence element called the TATA box. We have analyzed the interaction of yeast TFIID with the consensus TATA box sequence of the adenovirus major late promoter. To facilitate this detailed characterization, we developed a method for obtaining quantitative information from a gel retardation (bandshift) assay, allowing measurement of the rate and extent of TFIID-TATA box complex formation. Using this assay and DNase I protection assays, we determined that the association rate constant for TFIID binding to the major late promoter was too low to be consistent with a simple diffusion-limited association, suggesting that the binding proceeds by a multi-step pathway. Furthermore, we found that the slow rate of TFIID binding reported by other research groups was not the consequence of a rate-limiting conformational change, as has been previously suggested. Instead, we observed that the formation of a stable TFIID-TATA box complex was relatively rapid (complete in less than 1 min) at saturating concentrations of TFIID. We have proposed a two-step pathway consistent with the observed kinetics and have considered the possible contributions of each step to the overall rate of TFIID binding. This study lays the groundwork for a systematic characterization of the interaction of TFIID with additional TATA box sequences, including an experimental test of the possibility that different steps in the binding reaction are rate-limiting for different promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2017890520,"The neurohypophyseal hormone oxytocin (OT) is the most potent uterotonic agent known and is used to induce labor. Yet, endogenous circulating OT appears not to participate in the induction of labor. As shown here, the finding of OT messenger RNA and peptide in the uterus suggests a solution for this paradox. During gestation, rat uterus OT messenger RNA increased more than 150-fold and, at term, exceeded hypothalamic OT messenger RNA by 70-fold. Thus, during parturition, OT may act primarily as a local mediator and not as a circulating hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1501322875,"Immature mouse oocytes undergo spontaneous meiotic maturation when released from antral follicles into culture media. The first sign of meiotic resumption is germinal vesicle breakdown (GVB). Cytosolic free Ca2+ was measured in mouse oocytes during spontaneous maturation by monitoring fluorescence of indo-1 or fluo-3. The majority of oocytes showed a series of Ca2+ oscillations that continued for 1-3 h. Repetitive Ca2+ increases occurred every 1-3 min and lasted for 10-60 s. The Ca2+ oscillations appeared to be caused by an increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) because once they ceased, similar oscillations were triggered by injection of exogenous InsP3. Also, injection of the InsP3 receptor antagonist heparin (final concentration, 100 micrograms/ml) blocked the spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations. In contrast, Ca2+ oscillations induced by thimerosal were not inhibited by heparin. Treating oocytes with media containing 20 microM BAPTA/AM abolished Ca2+ oscillations in oocytes but did not affect the rate of GVB. The data show that cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations apparently caused by polyphosphoinositide turnover occur during mammalian oocyte maturation. However, the spontaneous oscillations do not appear to trigger GVB. Also, the data indicate that there are two separate Ca2+ release mechanisms in mouse oocytes, one sensitive to InsP3, the other to thimerosal."
https://openalex.org/W1991633942,"From histological investigations into the microstructure of conodont elements, a number of tissue types characteristic of the phosphatic skeleton of vertebrates have been identified. These include cellular bone, two forms of hypermineralized enamel homologs, and globular calcified cartilage. The presence of cellular bone in conodont elements provides unequivocal evidence for their vertebrate affinities. Furthermore, the identification of vertebrate hard tissues in the oral elements of conodonts extends the earliest occurrence of vertebrate hard tissues back by around 40 million years, from the Middle Ordovician (475 million years ago) to the Late Cambrian (515 million years ago)."
https://openalex.org/W1553448789,"Proprotein and prohormone processing at pairs of basic residues is generally thought to be both tissue- and precursor-specific and to be developmentally regulated. Furin, PC1 (also called PC3), and PC2 represent three recently discovered subtilisin-like proteinases which cleave a number of precursors at the same pairs of basic residues normally processed in vivo. Using human prorenin as a model, we show that PC1 can process it to active renin in cells containing secretory granules, such as the somatomammotroph cell line GH4, but not in cells which lack granules, such as the Chinese hamster ovary or African green monkey kidney epithelial (BSC-40) cell lines. In contrast, in both cell types, human prorenin is not activated by either PC2 or furin. Using the vaccinia virus expression system, biosynthetic labeling experiments demonstrated that PC1 and PC2 are themselves cleaved intracellularly at pairs of basic residues and that these two proenzymes are processed to different extents independent of whether the cell line contains dense core secretory granules. Furthermore, we also show that the cells mostly secrete the cleaved forms of PC1 and PC2, and that intracellularly the pro- form of PC2 predominates. Our data demonstrate that propeptide removal from these enzymes, possibly leading to their activation, is not the only criterion which governs precursor processing."
https://openalex.org/W2013839395,"Spontaneous diabetes in the BioBreeding (BB) rat, like human type I diabetes, results from the destruction of pancreatic islets by autoreactive T lymphocytes recognizing β cell-specific antigens. T cell tolerance is in part mediated by interactions of maturing thymocytes with antigens expressed in the thymic microenvironment; islets were therefore implanted into the thymus of neonatal diabetes-prone BB rats to determine whether exposure of T cell precursors to β cell antigens could influence the development of diabetes. This treatment completely prevented diabetes and insulitis in the native pancreas. The effect may be the result of specific modulation of diabetogenic T cells maturing in an islet-bearing thymus."
https://openalex.org/W2036678197,"Transcription of galactose-inducible genes in yeast is regulated by interaction between the activator protein GAL4 and the negative regulatory protein GAL80. It has been suggested that GAL80 binds to and represses GAL4 under uninduced conditions and dissociates from GAL4 on induction. However, the possibility that GAL80 remains associated with GAL4 after induction has not been ruled out. Experiments to discriminate between these two models were performed and revealed that GAL80 stays bound after induction."
https://openalex.org/W1529330610,"We elucidated the structure and alternative splicing patterns of the rat cystathionine beta-synthase gene. The gene is 20-25 kilobase pairs long, and its coding region is divided into 17 exons. These are alternatively spliced, forming four distinct mRNAs (types I through IV). The predicted open reading frames encode proteins of 61.5, 39, 60, and 52.5 kDa, respectively. Exons 13 and 16 are used alternatively and mutually exclusively. Exon 13 includes a stop codon and encodes the unique carboxyl-terminal sequence found in types II and IV. Exon 16 is present only in type I. Types I and III, which differ by 42 nucleotides (exon 16), are the predominant synthase mRNA forms in rat liver. Seventeen arginine peptides from pure liver synthase matched the deduced amino acid sequences of types I and III. These two polypeptides are detectable in liver extracts; each exhibits enzymatic activity when expressed in transfected Chinese hamster cells. Synthase shows substantial sequence similarity with pyridoxal 5‘-phosphate dependent enzymes from lower organisms. Similarity of synthase to Escherichia coli O-acetylserine (thiol)-lyase (cysK) is 52%; E. coli tryptophan synthase beta chain (trpB), 36%; yeast serine deaminase, 33%. Lysine 116 in synthase aligns with the established pyridoxyllysine residue of these enzymes suggesting that it is the pyridoxal 5‘-phosphate binding residue."
https://openalex.org/W2060769308,"Transcriptional regulation of the bacteriophage T4 late genes requires the participation of three DNA polymerase accessory proteins that are encoded by T4 genes 44, 62, and 45, and that act at an enhancer-like site. Transcriptional activation by these DNA replication proteins also requires the function of an RNA polymerase-bound coactivator protein that is encoded by T4 gene 33 and a promoter recognition protein that is encoded by T4 gene 55. Transcriptional activation in DNA constructs, in which the enhancer and a T4 late promoter can be segregated on two rings of a DNA catenane, has now been analyzed. The ability of an interposed DNA-binding protein to affect communication between the enhancer and the promoter was also examined. Together, these experiments demonstrate that this transcription-activating signal is conveyed between its enhancer and a T4 late promoter by a DNA-tracking mechanism. Alternative activation mechanisms relying entirely on through-space interactions of enhancer-bound and promoter-bound proteins are excluded."
https://openalex.org/W1501840877,"The cDNA for the developmentally regulated, neurite outgrowth-promoting protein HB-GAM (heparin-binding growth-associated molecule) was recently cloned and shown to encode a novel lysine-rich sequence that is homologous with retinoic acid-induced sequences suggested to function in cell differentiation (Merenmies, J., and Rauvala, H. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 16721-16724). The same sequence was found for the mitogenic and neurite outgrowth-promoting protein pleiotrophin (Li, Y.-S., Milner, P. G., Chauhan, A. K., Watson, M. A., Hoffman, R. M., Kodner, C. M., Milbrandt, J., and Deuel, T. F. (1990) Science 250, 1690-1694). In this study, we have constructed a recombinant baculovirus using the cDNA that encodes the putative preprotein of HB-GAM. The putative secretion signal of HB-GAM is cleaved off in the baculovirus expression system, and the recombinant protein is rapidly secreted to the culture medium. Recombinant HB-GAM purified from the culture medium retains the biochemical characteristics and the neurite outgrowth-promoting activity found for the tissue-derived protein. Studies on the neurite outgrowth-promoting activity suggest that HB-GAM functions as an extracellular matrix-associated protein that enhances axonal growth in perinatal cerebral neurons of the rat. Since the same predicted amino acid sequence has been ascribed to a mitogenic protein, mitogenic activities of the recombinant HB-GAM and of tissue-derived HB-GAM fractions were also studied. Recombinant HB-GAM did not display any significant mitogenic activity, suggesting that tissue-derived HB-GAM preparations may contain other heparin-binding mitogenic factors. We identified in brain-derived HB-GAM fractions a 17-kDa protein (p17) that is detached from heparin by a slightly higher salt concentration as compared to HB-GAM. We suggest that p17 is structurally distinct from HB-GAM and responsible for the mitogenic actions of tissue-derived HB-GAM fractions."
https://openalex.org/W1586184394,"Recently it was found that lactoferrin, an iron-binding glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 76,500, inhibits the remnant receptor-mediated uptake of apolipoprotein E (apoE)-bearing lipoproteins by the liver. In the present study we characterized the hepatic recognition of lactoferrin. Intravenously injected 125I-lactoferrin was cleared rapidly from the circulation by the liver (92.8 +/- 9.5% of the dose at 5 min after injection). Parenchymal cells contained 97.1 +/- 1.5% of the hepatic radioactivity. Internalization, monitored by measuring the release of liver-associated radioactivity by the polysaccharide fucoidin, occurred slowly. Only about 40% of the liver-associated lactoferrin was internalized at 10 min after injection, and it took 180 min to internalize 90%. Subcellular fractionation indicated that internalized lactoferrin is transported to the lysosomes. Binding of lactoferrin to isolated parenchymal liver cells was saturable with a dissociation constant of 10 microM (20 x 10(6) binding sites/cell). The role of arginine residues on lactoferrin was studied by modifying these residues with 1,2-cyclohexanedione. The modification resulted in a strongly reduced liver association (15.9 +/- 1.6% of the dose at 5 min after injection). Furthermore, unlabeled 1,2-cyclohexanedione-modified lactoferrin did not inhibit the binding of 125I-lactoferrin to isolated parenchymal cells. Arginine residues on lactoferrin thus appear to be essential for its specific recognition by parenchymal liver cells. In particular the clustered N-terminal arginine residues, which resemble the arginine-rich receptor binding sequence in apoE, may be responsible for both the interaction of lactoferrin with its recognition site and the inhibition of the hepatic uptake of apoE-bearing lipoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1524567035,"We have cloned, mapped and sequenced the complete CDC14 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and characterized its transcription during the cell cycle. CDC14 was found within a 3.5-kilobase pair XhoI-XbaI fragment of chromosome VI. The DNA sequence reveals an open reading frame capable of encoding a 423-amino acid polypeptide. Protein sequence comparisons through the Prosite, GenBank and EMBL databases allowed us to identify a conserved protein tyrosine phosphatase active site in the encoded CDC14 protein beginning at amino acid 153. Disruption demonstrates that CDC14 is an essential gene. The level of the CDC14 transcript appears to be weakly cell cycle-regulated and has a periodicity which lags approximately 15 min behind histone HTB1 mRNA accumulation levels. DNA sequence analysis has identified a region within the CDC14 promoter which bears a striking resemblance (15 out of 21 base pairs identity) to the cell cycle regulation region of the promoter of the histone H2A1-H2B1 (HTA1-HTB1) gene pair. The cell cycle regulation sequence is responsible for the periodic accumulation and hydroxyurea sensitivity of the histone HTA1-HTB1 message. However, unlike histone mRNA, which is repressed upon hydroxyurea arrest, CDC14 mRNA appears to be unaffected. This suggests that CDC14 and histone genes are regulated by different mechanisms during the cell cycle. Furthermore, superhelical density measurements suggest that CDC14 is not involved in nucleosome assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1549884641,"Infusion of hepatocyte-specific DNA-protein complexes into rats leads to transient recombinant gene expression in liver. The eventual deterioration of gene expression is due in part to instability of the targeted DNA. In a previous report, we noted retention of transgene sequences in liver and persistent recombinant gene expression when the animals were subjected to partial hepatectomy following in vivo gene transfer. In an attempt to define the mechanism(s) responsible for persistent gene expression following partial hepatectomy, we characterized the molecular state of the retained, liver-associated transgenes. Southern blot analysis of DNA from liver tissues harvested various times after in vivo gene transfer and partial hepatectomy (10 min to 11 weeks) demonstrated high levels of transgene DNA (100-10,000 copies/cell). The predominant form of this DNA appeared to be episomal based on analyses of uncut DNA or DNA restricted by an endonuclease with one site in the plasmid. Livers from several animals contained a small proportion of transgene sequences of unknown structure. The existence of episomal DNA in liver was confirmed in experiments in which intact plasmid was rescued from total hepatocyte DNA by transformation of bacteria. Both strands of DNA in the liver-associated plasmid retained a bacterial pattern of methylation suggesting that the plasmid had not replicated in the eukaryotic cell. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the majority of transgene sequences are retained as stabilized plasmids. The specific form of DNA which is transcriptionally active was not identified in these studies. This represents a new mechanism for retaining foreign DNA in eukaryotic cells in vivo and has implications both for the development of somatic gene therapies and the pathogenesis of viral diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1503137231,"The Rho proteins are identified as a subgroup of the Ras superfamily of low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins. We have studied the expression of these proteins in human cytotoxic natural killer cells and found that RhoA is the most abundantly expressed member of the Rho family. The Rho proteins are specific substrates for ADP-ribosylation catalyzed by the C3 exoenzyme from Clostridium botulinum. We report here that introduction of recombinant C3 in electropermeabilized natural killer cells or in cytotoxic T lymphocytes resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of their cytolytic function. Furthermore, a single substrate is efficiently ADP-ribosylated by C3 in extracts from cytotoxic cells. Biochemical analyses indicate that this substrate is RhoA, and subcellular fractionation experiments demonstrate that it is essentially present in the cytosol of the cells. Western blot analysis, however, revealed that a small proportion of the Rho protein can be found associated with the cell membrane as well as with the cytotoxic granules. These results indicate that the low molecular weight GTP-binding protein RhoA is present in cytotoxic lymphocytes and plays a critical role in cell-mediated cytotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1578330187,"The involvement of a vicinally spaced dithiol group in steroid binding to the glucocorticoid receptor has been deduced from experiments with the thiol-specific reagent methyl methanethiolsulfonate and the vicinal dithiol-specific reagent sodium arsenite. The vicinally spaced dithiol appears to reside in the 16-kDa trypsin fragment of the receptor, which is thought to contain 3 cysteines (Cys-640, -656, and -661 of the rat receptor) and binds hormone with an approximately 23-fold lower affinity than does the intact 98-kDa receptor. We now report that the steroid binding specificity of preparations of this 16-kDa fragment and the intact receptor are virtually identical. This finding supports our designation of the 16-kDa fragment as a steroid-binding core domain and validates our continued use of this tryptic fragment in studies of steroid binding. To identify the cysteines which comprise the vicinally spaced dithiol group, and to examine further the role of cysteines in steroid binding, a total of five point mutant receptors were prepared: cysteine-to-serine for each suspected cysteine, cysteine-to-glycine for Cys-656, and the C656,661S double mutant. Unexpectedly, each receptor with a single point mutation still bound steroid. Even the double mutant (C656,661S) bound steroid with wild type affinity. These results suggest that none of these cysteines are directly required either for steroid binding to the glucocorticoid receptor or for heat shock protein 90 association with the receptor. However, the presence of Cys-656 was obligatory for covalent labeling of the receptor by [3H]dexamethasone 21-mesylate. Studies with preparations of the 98 and 16 kDa forms of these mutant receptors revealed both that Cys-656 and -661 comprise the vicinally spaced dithiols reacting with arsenite and that any two of the three thiols could form an intramolecular disulfide after treatment with low concentrations of methyl methanethiolsulfonate. These data, in conjunction with those from experiments on the effects of steric bulk on various receptor functions, support a model for the ligand binding cavity of the receptor that involves all three thiols in a flexible cleft but where thiol-steroid interactions are not essential for binding."
https://openalex.org/W2086075081,"The T cell receptor (TCR) zeta chain was attached to the TCR alpha and beta extracellular domains to induce efficient expression of alpha beta heterodimers that can recognize complexes of antigen with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Chimeric constructs expressed in RBL-2H3 cells were efficiently transported to the cell surface uniquely as disulfide-linked heterodimers. Transfectants were activated by specific antigen-MHC complexes, which demonstrated that the expressed alpha beta was functional and that CD3 was not required for antigen-MHC binding. Constructs with thrombin cleavage sites were efficiently cleaved to soluble disulfide-linked heterodimers. Thus, attachment of TCR zeta domains and protease cleavage sites to TCR alpha and beta induces expression of demonstrably functional heterodimers that can be solubilized."
https://openalex.org/W1571930658,"Chromogranin A is a high capacity, low affinity Ca2+ binding protein which undergoes Ca2+- and pH-dependent conformational changes, and has recently been suggested to play a Ca2+-buffering role in the secretory vesicle of adrenal medullary chromaffin cell, the major inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ store of chromaffin cell (Yoo, S.H., and Albanesi, J.P. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 13446-13448). In the present study, it is shown that chromogranin A exists in a monomer-dimer equilibrium at pH 7.5 and in a monomer-tetramer equilibrium at pH 5.5. The pH appears monomer-tetramer equilibrium at pH 5.5. The pH appears to be a necessary and sufficient factor determining the types of oligomers formed. Although Ca2+ did not change the type of oligomerization, it had a very significant effect on the values of the thermodynamic parameters characterizing the associations. The delta G0 values for a monomer-dimer equilibrium were -7 to -8 kcal/mol, while those for a monomer-tetramer equilibrium were -20 to -23 kcal/mol. At pH 5.5, the values of delta H0, delta S0, and delta C0p were large and negative in the absence of Ca2+ and large and positive in the presence of 35 mM Ca2+, implying markedly different reaction mechanisms. Extrapolation of the results to 37 degrees C and 1 mM chromogranin A suggests that chromogranin A is virtually 100% tetramer at pH 5.5 in the presence of 35 mM Ca2+ but is 96% dimer at pH 7.5 in the absence of Ca2+, the two conditions resembling those seen in vivo. These results suggest that chromogranin A is mostly dimer in the endoplasmic reticulum and cis-Golgi area and is essentially all tetramer in the vesicle."
https://openalex.org/W1486124196,"ras proteins are post-translationally processed at their carboxyl-terminal CAAX motif by a triplet of modifications: prenylation of C with farnesyl, proteolytic trimming of AAX, and carboxyl-methylation. These modifications co-operate with palmitoylation of nearby sites or a polybasic region to target plasma membrane localization. The related YPT/rab proteins in contrast are localized to compartments of the endo-membrane system and may be involved in directing membrane traffic. These proteins end in XCC or CXC motifs. We have analyzed the processing of members of this subfamily form the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We find using in vitro translation in reticulocyte lysates that YPT1, -3, and -5 are prenylated with geranylgeranyl and that they incorporate label from [3H]mevalonic acid when expressed in transfected COS cells in vivo. Furthermore, prenylation was necessary for membrane binding in vivo. The CXC protein YPT5, but neither of the two XCC proteins YPT1 and YPT3, was carboxyl-methylated in S. pombe and in COS cells in vivo. However, YPT5 was not carboxyl-methylated in vitro in lysates which were able to methylate ras protein. YPT3 was detectably palmitoylated when expressed in COS cells, though at a much lower level than ras."
https://openalex.org/W1522945668,"To study the molecular basis of tissue-specific expression of the GLUT4/muscle-fat facilitative glucose transporter gene, we generated lines of transgenic mice carrying 2.4 kilobases of the 5‘-flanking region of the human GLUT4 gene fused to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene (hGLUT4[2.4]-CAT). This reporter gene construct was specifically expressed in tissues that normally express GLUT4 mRNA, which include both brown and white adipose tissues as well as cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle. In contrast, CAT reporter activity was not detected in brain or liver, two tissues that do not express the GLUT4 gene. In addition, the relative levels of CAT mRNA driven by the human GLUT4 promoter in various tissues of these transgenic animals mirrored those of the endogenous mouse GLUT4 mRNA. Since previous studies have observed alterations in GLUT4 mRNA levels induced by fasting and refeeding (Sivitz, W. I., DeSautel, S. L., Kayano, T., Bell, G. I., and Pessin, J. E. (1989) Nature 340, 72-74), the regulated expression the hGLUT4[2.4]-CAT transgene was also assessed in these animals. Fasting was observed to decrease CAT activity in white adipose tissue which was super-induced upon refeeding. These alterations in CAT expression occurred in parallel to the changes in endogenous mouse GLUT4 mRNA levels. Although CAT expression in skeletal muscle and brown adipose tissue was unaffected, the endogenous mouse GLUT4 mRNA was also refractory to the effects of fasting/refeeding in these tissues. These data demonstrate that 2.4 kilobases of the 5‘-flanking region of the human GLUT4 gene contain all the necessary sequence elements to confer tissue-specific expression and at least some of the sequence elements controlling the hormonal/metabolic regulation of this gene."
https://openalex.org/W1493147212,"The family of small interstitial chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycans consists of at least three different molecular species: biglycan (proteoglycan I), decorin (proteoglycan II), and proteoglycan-100, which has a glycosylated core protein of about 100 kDa. The core protein of decorin has been shown to be responsible for receptor-mediated endocytosis of this proteoglycan species by a variety of mesenchymal cells. It is now demonstrated that skin fibroblasts and articular chondrocytes endocytose biglycan with an efficiency similar to that of decorin. Uptake of biglycan is also mediated by its core protein and can be inhibited by decorin in a partially competitive manner. In human fibroblasts, endosomal proteins of 51 and 26 kDa, which are known to bind decorin core protein, also interact with biglycan. This interaction can be inhibited by decorin. Bovine articular chondrocytes contained binding proteins of 48 and 25 kDa. Proteoglycan-100 can be distinguished from biglycan and decorin by its low clearance rate, which however, exceeds the rate of fluid phase endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1915352327,"Tropoelastin expression is down-regulated by exposure to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), and we present data indicating that this repression is primarily controlled by a posttranscriptional mechanism. Steady-state and functional levels of tropoelastin mRNA were coordinately repressed by 10(-7) M 1,25 (OH)2D3 in fetal bovine chondrocytes, but transcription, as determined by nuclear runoff assay, was not appreciably influenced in fetal bovine chondrocytes or in rat lung fibroblasts. Similarly, exposure to 1,25(OH)2D3 did not influence chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase activity expressed by a human tropoelastin promoter-expression construct in either cell type. Exposure to cycloheximide had little effect on tropoelastin mRNA levels in control cells but partially restored tropoelastin mRNA levels in cells pretreated with 1,25(OH)2D3 and prevented repression when added together with 1,25(OH)2D3. Similarly, simultaneous exposure to actinomycin D and 1,25(OH)2D3 attenuated the down-regulation of tropoelastin. These data indicate that repression of tropoelastin steady-state mRNA levels by 1,25(OH)2D3 is primarily mediated by a posttranscriptional mechanism that requires both transcription and protein synthesis for full effect."
https://openalex.org/W2079507900,Cholera returned to the Americas after a 100 year hiatus in Peru in January 1991. Fecal contamination of water caused this epidemic. Even though health authorities informed the public about cholera early in the epidemic holdups to providing safe water permitted its spread. By the end of 1991 there were 391000 cases and 4000 deaths in 15 countries. The use of oral rehydration therapy kept the case fatality rate much lower (1%) than it had been in the past (>20%). This epidemic is a continuation of the 7th cholera pandemic begun in Asia in 1961 with the new Vibrio cholerae 01 El Tor biotype. In Chile the vehicle for transmission of cholera was uncooked vegetables irrigated with raw sewage. Public health authorities forbade the sale of such vegetables and informed the public to cook all vegetables. A decline in the incidence of cholera and typhoid followed these measures. In Ecuador contaminated shellfish spread cholera. US cholera cases were infected in either affected Latin American countries on the airplane returning to the US or from contaminated seafood they brought to the US. Cholera control measures are often difficult to implement. For example the Americas need to invest >US $200 billion over 12 years to provide safe drinking water and adequate sewage disposal. Until funding arrives however governments can repair existing water distribution systems and chlorinate water supplies. In areas not provided with such services authorities can promote use of small mouthed water containers and/or boiling or chlorinated household water. Further health educators can encourage people to wash their hands to cook contaminated foods and to avoid food/beverages prepared by street vendors. Research is accelerating in developing an effective cholera vaccine such as the promising killed whole cell vaccine (subunit B). The epidemic in the Americas is expected to spread to the Caribbean the Amazon Basin and the Atlantic Coast.
https://openalex.org/W1489013334,"The mineralized scale of the freshwater sunfish Lepomis macrochirus (bluegill) contains a Gla protein. The protein was identified in extracts of scale by a new colorimetric assay for Gla-containing proteins. The protein was purified by gel filtration chromatography followed by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Several tests establish the identity of scale Gla protein and bone Gla protein (BGP). First, the proteins exhibit identical mobilities on electrophoresis and by reversed phase HPLC. Second, they have identical amino-terminal amino acid sequences. Finally, identical peptides are generated by proteolytic digestion. The 45-residue amino acid sequence of the bone Gla protein from L. macrochirus has a high sequence homology with swordfish, as well as homology to mammalian bone Gla protein. The BGP of bluegill shares with swordfish BGP a truncated NH2 terminus and an extended COOH terminus. These features may be unique to fish, as they have not been observed in terrestrial vertebrates. The bluegill BGP is the first vitamin K-dependent protein to contain a non-gamma-carboxylated residue to the NH2-terminal side of all of its Gla residues. In all other vitamin K-dependent proteins, Gla always appears to the NH2-terminal side of the first Glu. The implications of this result are discussed. The bluegill rib bone is curiously enriched in BGP, as are other mineralized tissues of this species. One hypothesis is that this may be due to the acellular nature of the bone in this species. The abundance of BGP in the bones of this fish may provide clues to the unknown function of this bone protein."
https://openalex.org/W1534891164,"Diffuse alveolar damage, presenting clinically as adult respiratory distress syndrome, is characterized initially by widespread intra-alveolar fibrin deposition. Alveolar epithelial cells play a central role in the subsequent repair process. We have recently shown that alveolar epithelial cells have the capacity to promote fibrinolysis (Marshall, B. C., Sageser, D. S., Rao, N. V., Emi, M., and Hoidal, J. R. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 8198-8204) and may therefore directly participate in the extensive remodeling that follows acute lung injury. Because the tissue repair process occurs in an acute inflammatory setting, we investigated the effects of inflammatory mediators on urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) expression by pulmonary epithelial cells. We found that interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) upregulated PA activity in A549 human pulmonary epithelial cells. Biosynthetic labeling and immunoprecipitation showed that both cytokines caused marked accumulation of newly synthesized u-PA. Northern blot analyses demonstrated that both IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha induced relatively rapid accumulation of u-PA mRNA which did not require de novo protein synthesis and was substantially inhibited by glucocorticoids. Nuclear run-off transcription studies showed that both cytokines caused rapid transcriptional activation of the u-PA gene. While the effects of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha were qualitatively similar, some differences emerged. Most notably, TNF-alpha led to a more sustained accumulation of u-PA mRNA than did IL-1 beta. In contrast to their effects on u-PA expression, IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha had minimal effect on PA inhibitor-1 expression. These effects of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha, mediators known to play a key role in acute lung injury and inflammation, may promote lysis of alveolar fibrin by alveolar epithelium, thereby aiding in restoration of normal lung architecture."
https://openalex.org/W1560843753,"A novel cDNA clone termed E16 which codes for an integral membrane protein of 241 amino acids with six transmembrane domains was isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes. The cDNA clone is 4000 base pairs in length and exhibits an unusually long 3'-untranslated region of about 3000 nucleotides. Its expression at the mRNA level is closely linked to cellular activation and division. In all myeloid and lymphoid cells, as well as in primary lymphocytes from peripheral blood, E16 transcripts are rapidly induced and rapidly degraded after stimulation. This pattern of expression is unusual for an integral membrane protein and resembles more closely the kinetic seen for protooncogenes and lymphokines in the T cell system. Its isolation was made possible by a novel approach especially designed to selectively clone cDNAs which exhibit such an expression kinetic. It is based on a combination of the differential screening of a subtracted cDNA library and the subsequent hybridization of the resulting phages to a short oligonucleotide (5'-TAAATAAA-TAAATA-3'). This oligonucleotide is complementary to a trimer of the rapid degradation signal (AUUUA) which is present as a single or reiterated motif in the 3'-untranslated region of many short-lived transcripts."

However, it has not been possible to derive new principles for the design of vaccine adjuvants from knowledge of the mechanism of immunogenicity. Carbonyl-amino condensations, which are essential to the inductive interaction between antigen-presenting cells and T helper cells, were tested as a target for the enhancement of immune responses. Enzymic oxidation of cell-surface galactose to increase aminereactive carbonyl groups on murine lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells provided a potent, noninflammatory method of enhancing the immunogenicity of viral, bacterial, and protozoal subunit vaccines in mice."
https://openalex.org/W1495002147,"Translocation is a necessary and rate-limiting step for diphtheria toxin (DT) cytotoxicity. We have reconstituted DT translocation in a cell-free system using endosomes purified from lymphocytes and have demonstrated this using two different probe/cell systems, which provided identical results: 125I-DT/human CEM cells and 125I-transferrin-DT/mouse BW cells. The cell-free DT translocation process was found to be dependent on the presence of the pH gradient endosome (pH 5.3)/cytosol (pH 7). Among the pH equilibrating agents, nigericin (5 microM) was found to be the most effective, inhibiting DT translocation by 88%. An optimum pH value of 7 on the cytosolic side of the membrane (pH gradient approximately 1.7) was determined. ATP per se is not required for DT translocation. 125I-DT translocation was 3-fold more active from late than from early endosomes, probably because of their slightly more acidic pH. Only the A chain of the toxin was found to escape from either 125I-DT/CEM or 125I-transferrin-DT/BW endosomes. Translocation of control endosome labels (125I-transferrin and 125I-horseradish peroxidase) was never observed. We also show that DT receptors present on resistant (mouse) cells block the translocation of the toxin and are responsible for the resistance of these cells to DT."
https://openalex.org/W1558944534,"The general features of the kinetics of actin polymerization are investigated by mathematical models, with the aim of identifying the kinetically relevant parameters in the process and detecting and interpreting the alterations occurring in actin polymerization under various experimental conditions. Polymerization curves, obtained by following the increase in fluorescence of actin derivatized with N-(1-pyrenyl) iodoacetamide, are fitted using analytical equations derived from biochemical models of the actin polymerization process. Particular attention is given to the evaluation of the effects of the neuronal phosphoprotein synapsin I. The models obtained under various ionic conditions reveal that synapsin I interacts with actin in a very complex fashion, sharing some of the properties of classical nucleating proteins but displaying also actions not described previously for other actin-binding proteins. Synapsin I appears to bind G-actin with a very high stoichiometry (1:2-4), and the complex behaves as an F-actin nucleus, producing actin filaments under conditions where spontaneous polymerization is negligible. These actions of synapsin I are markedly affected by site-specific phosphorylation of the protein. An original transformation of the fluorescence data, which estimates the disappearance rate of actin monomer toward the critical concentration, is presented and shown to be of general usefulness for the study of actin-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1570612486,"Plasmenylethanolamines represent the major endogenous phospholipid storage depot of arachidonic acid in many mammalian cells. To elucidate the biochemical mechanisms contributing to the high plasmalogen content and arachidonic acid enrichment present in myocardial ethanolamine glycerophospholipids, the substrate specificity of rabbit myocardial ethanolamine phosphotransferase (EPT) was quantified utilizing multiple molecular species of each subclass of diradyl glycerol substrate. Myocardial EPT demonstrated over a 16-fold selectivity for 1-O-alk-1'-enyl-2-acyl-sn-glycerol (AAG) compared to 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol (DAG) substrate utilizing individual molecular species of each subclass dispersed in Tween 20. The selective utilization of AAG by EPT was substantiated utilizing two independent assay systems which employed either the presentation of substrate to enzyme as a substitutional impurity in Triton X-100 mixed micelles or the obligatory utilization of endogenously generated diradyl glycerol substrates. Although rabbit myocardial microsomes contained over a 20-fold molar excess of endogenous DAG to AAG mass, incubation of rabbit myocardial microsomes with CDP-ethanolamine resulted in the highly selective synthesis of plasmenylethanolamines which were predominantly comprised of molecular species containing arachidonic acid at the sn-2 position (greater than 75%). Endogenous AAG molecular species in rabbit myocardial microsomes were similarly enriched in arachidonic acid, and the distribution of AAG molecular species closely paralleled the distribution of plasmenylethanolamine (but not plasmenylcholine) molecular species. Thus, the subclass and molecular species distribution of the ethanolamine glycerophospholipids synthesized by rabbit myocardial EPT reflects independent contributions from the subclass selectivity of EPT for AAG substrate in conjunction with the enrichment of arachidonic acid in microsomal AAG molecular species."
https://openalex.org/W1508617114,"The bacteriophage T4-encoded MotA protein is critical for transcription from T4 middle-mode promoters. However, a direct interaction of this protein with a middle-mode promoter has not previously been demonstrated. We have cloned the motA gene and overexpressed the gene product using the T7 expression system. A simple procedure was then developed to purify the MotA protein to homogeneity. Using the purified protein we have demonstrated that MotA protein binds to the -30 region of the middle-mode promoter PuvsY. This promoter has previously been shown to be a necessary component of a T4 replication origin, and thus MotA is also a T4 origin-binding protein. Modified RNA polymerase purified from T4-infected cells was used to establish middle-mode transcription in vitro. Transcription from PuvsY was markedly enhanced by the addition of MotA protein, whether or not the template contained the cytosine modifications characteristic of T4 DNA. However, transcription from PuvsY was apparently independent of the MotA protein when unmodified RNA polymerase from uninfected cells was used."
https://openalex.org/W1495493955,"Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is a highly unusual multifunctional polypeptide that is identical to the beta-subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase, a cellular thyroid hormone-binding protein and a subunit of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein complex, and very similar to a polypeptide functioning in vitro as a glycosylation site binding protein of oligosaccharyl transferase. The human PDI gene possesses several putative transcriptional control elements, including the highly unusual presence of six CCAAT boxes between -108 and -378 of the 5'-flanking region. We report here on a promoter analysis of this gene. Eleven PDI promoter elements recognized by DNA-binding proteins present in HeLa cell and HT-1080 cell nuclear extracts were identified by DNase I footprinting analysis within the first 630 nucleotides of the 5'-flanking region. Interestingly, these included all six CCAAT elements. Functional 5' deletion analysis suggested that only two or three of the CCAAT elements may contribute significantly to the promoter activity in HeLa cells. Mutations introduced into each of the CCAAT boxes separately indicated, however, that all six appear to contribute to the promoter strength, the largest decreases (approximately 50%) being seen with mutations in the second or fifth CCAAT box. These data thus suggested that efficient expression of the multifunctional PDI polypeptide is secured by multiple CCAAT elements, some of which appear to be functionally redundant. The 5' deletion analysis further suggested that a region between -623 and -518 may contain additional positively and negatively acting elements."
https://openalex.org/W1591140747,"The 5' cap structure of eucaryotic mRNA plays a pivotal role in mRNA metabolism. This report demonstrates that anti-sense oligonucleotides equipped with 3'-overhanging nucleotides modulate the amount of recombinant human eucaryotic initiation factor-4E that binds to a 5'-capped oligoribonucleotide. The degree of inhibition or enhancement of protein binding is dependent upon the number and sequence of overhanging nucleotides. A 45% inhibition of complexation was observed by the addition of one 3'-overhanging guanosine residue. Addition of a second residue (+2/GN) resulted in a higher degree of inhibition, 77-88%. In contrast, addition of one adenosine residue enhanced the formation of the eucaryotic initiation factor-4E-m7GpppRNA complex by 213%. Modulation of protein interactions with the 5'-cap structure is likely to effect several biological events, including pre-mRNA processing, transport of the mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and translation of the target mRNA. This targeting strategy in anti-sense chemistry may have practical applications in experimental biology and medicine."
https://openalex.org/W1552019636,"Replication of mini-F plasmid in Escherichia coli requires the plasmid-encoded RepE initiator protein and a number of host factors and is regulated by interaction of RepE with specific sequences near the replication origin, ori2. We have examined DNA binding properties of several hyperactive mutant RepE proteins with single amino acid substitutions. Plasmids carrying these (repE) mutations, unlike the parental plasmid, can replicate in bacterial hosts lacking the heat shock sigma factor (sigma 32) or deficient in the DnaK, DnaJ, or GrpE heat shock protein. Using gel-retardation assays, the mutant RepE proteins were shown to bind the ori2 repeated sequences with much increased affinities compared to the wild type RepE, whereas they bound to the repE operator with slightly reduced affinities. These results agreed well with the properties of mutant RepE proteins studied in vivo and accounted for the high RepE initiator activities and the high copy numbers of mutant plasmids. In addition, the DnaJ heat shock protein was found to markedly enhance the binding of wild type RepE to ori2 or the operator. DnaK protein with or without ATP failed to show such enhancements. Thus, among the heat shock proteins required for mini-F replication, DnaJ appears to play a major role in RepE binding to ori2 and the operator, perhaps accompanied by RepE activation."
https://openalex.org/W1558708299,"The authors in a previous report (Klausner, R. D., Kempf, C., Weinstein, J. N., Blumenthal, R., and van Renswoude, J. (1983) Biochem. J. 212, 801-810) have argued that native folding of ovalbumin occurs during translation, but not in a renaturation system of the denatured form. To re-examine the possibility, we searched for the conditions of correct oxidative refolding of denatured disulfide-reduced ovalbumin. Data of trypsin resistance, CD-spectrum, and selective reactivity of cysteine sulfhydryls revealed that the fully denatured protein can refold into the native conformation under disulfide-reduced conditions. The interconversion between the native and denatured forms was fully reversible with a free energy change for unfolding of 6.6 kcal/mol at 25 degrees C. Subsequent reoxidation under a variety of redox conditions generated only one disulfide bond in the reduced refolded protein with six cysteine sulfhydryls. Furthermore, the regenerated disulfide was found by peptide analyses to correspond to the native disulfide pairing, Cys73-Cys120. We, therefore, concluded that co-translational folding, if any, is not requisite for the correct oxidative folding of ovalbumin."

Site-saturation mutagenesis was used to address the role of the lysine residue at this position (Lys213) in Escherichia coli PBP 5, a D-alanine carboxypeptidase enzyme. A soluble form of PBP 5 was used to replace Lys213 with 18 other amino acids, and the ability of these mutant proteins to bind [3H]penicillin G was assessed. Only the substitution of lysine with arginine resulted in a protein that was capable of forming a stable covalent complex with antibiotic. The affinity of [14C]penicillin G for the arginine mutant was 1.2-fold higher than for wild-type PBP 5 (4.4 versus 5.1 micrograms/ml for 20 min at 30 degrees C), and both proteins showed identical rates of hydrolysis of the [14C]penicilloyl-bound complex (t1/2 = 9.1 min). Surprisingly, the arginine-substituted protein was unable to catalyze D-alanine carboxypeptidase activity in vitro, which suggests that there is a substantial difference in the geometries of the peptide substrate and penicillin G within the active site of PBP 5."
https://openalex.org/W1565316587,"K562 human erythroleukemia cells constitutively express epsilon- and gamma- but not beta-globin genes. We have previously shown that the differential expression of globin genes observed in intact K562 cells could be simulated in vitro as K562 nuclear extract (NE) actively transcribes the epsilon-globin (with 2 kilobases of 5'-flanking sequence) and gamma-globin gene DNA templates but not beta-globin gene templates. We have now used the K562 in vitro transcription system to examine a silencer transcriptional control element which has been reported to be localized between -177 and -392 base pairs (bp) 5' of the canonical cap site for the epsilon-globin gene. We find that K562 NE has markedly reduced synthesis of RNA in vitro from epsilon-globin gene DNA deletion templates which contain the silencer sequence, or part thereof, but not the adjacent 5'-positive regulatory region (-453 to -535 bp). Furthermore, those transcripts generated in vitro from DNA templates extending to -453 bp or less of the epsilon-globin gene were not correctly initiated at the canonical cap site. Separating the K562 NE by ion exchange chromatography, we isolated a fraction (F175) transcriptionally active for all tested globin genes including the epsilon-globin gene containing the silencer sequence and a fraction (F50) which contains the trans-acting factors associated with the silencer activity. F50 showed a strong dose-dependent inhibitory effect on correctly initiated epsilon-globin gene transcription directed by either unfractionated K562 NE or F175. This suppression by F50 was not observed on transcriptional activity of the permissive adenovirus 2 major late promoter. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays using the epsilon-globin gene silencer region as probe, F50 and F175 exhibited different DNA binding protein patterns; a specific protein band in F50 appears to be associated with the silencer activity. These studies suggest that this protein may be specifically responsible for the activity of the silencer element of the epsilon-globin gene. The expression and silencing of the epsilon-globin gene during development may be modulated by the interactions of this protein with the cis-acting DNA silencer."
https://openalex.org/W1522607693,"We and others have previously shown that octanoate increases the oxidation of branched chain amino acids (BCAA) in skeletal muscle. The present study was designed to investigate the mechanism of this increased oxidation. Studies were performed with rat hind limbs perfused with 0.50 mM L-[1-14C]leucine with or without octanoate. The flux through branched chain keto acid (BCKA) dehydrogenase was measured, and the basal and total activity of BCKA dehydrogenase in skeletal muscle was determined. The rate of flux through BCKA dehydrogenase increased by 37, 119, and 297% with 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mM octanoate, respectively. This increase in flux was not due to a change in BCAA aminotransferase activity but was due to an increase in the basal activity of BCKA dehydrogenase. There was a strong correlation (r = 0.96) between increases in flux through BCKA dehydrogenase and increases in the basal activities of BCKA dehydrogenase. Preincubation of BCKA dehydrogenase with Mg2+ caused full activation of this enzyme, but preincubation with octanoate did not activate this enzyme. On the other hand, octanoate completely prevented the ATP-dependent inactivation of fully activated BCKA dehydrogenase. We conclude that octanoate increases the oxidation of leucine in skeletal muscle by increasing the activation of BCKA dehydrogenase. The mechanism of this activation is the inhibition of BCKA dehydrogenase kinase rather than the stimulation of a specific or nonspecific protein phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1537763360,"Promoter strength has been defined as the relative production of transcripts from a promoter. For T7 transcription it has frequently been observed that T7 class III promoters are qualitatively stronger than T7 class II promoters. In previous work it was observed that the maximum rates of initiation of three class III and three class II promoters show no class distinctions (Ikeda, R. A., Lin, A. C., and Clarke, J. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 2640-2649). This suggests that the efficiency of the conversion of the polymerase initiation complex to a stable transcription complex contributes to the overall strength of T7 promoters. The class differences in the strengths of T7 class II and class III promoters are confirmed by measuring the relative synthesis of run-off transcripts. These results show that the relative strengths of the class III promoters, phi 6.5, phi 10, and phi 13, are all comparable ranging from 0.61 for phi 6.5 to 1.00 for phi 10, while the relative strengths of the T7 class II promoters, phi 1.1B, phi 1.3, and phi 3.8, vary widely. One T7 class II promoter, phi 1.1B (relative strength = 0.34), approaches the strength of the class III promoters, while the other T7 class II promoters, phi 1.3 (relative strength = 0.045) and phi 3.8 (relative strength = 0.070) are nearly inactive. The efficiency of promoter clearance is then determined by measuring the relative production of small transcription products in comparison with the production of run-off transcripts. These measurements clearly distinguish the T7 class III promoters from the T7 class II promoters. It is found that 68-75% of all initiations at the T7 class III promoters phi 6.5, phi 10, and phi 13 produce a run-off transcript, while only 16-36% of the initiations at the T7 class II promoters phi 1.1B, phi 1.3, and phi 3.8 produce a run-off transcript. Clearly, promoter clearance contributes to the difference in promoter strengths of the T7 class II and III promoters."
https://openalex.org/W1590922806,"In the presence of appropriate reporter genes mammalian nuclear receptors are competent to transactivate gene expression when expressed in yeast cells. Thus yeast genetics could be used to identify determinants of steroid specificity for these mammalian proteins. However, unlike the estrogen, progesterone, vitamin D3, and thyroid hormone receptors, the glucocorticoid receptor shows an apparently abnormal steroid specificity in yeast (Schena, M., and Yamamoto, K. (1988) Science 241, 965-967), suggesting that the expressed protein might be incorrectly folded. We show here that the glucocorticoid receptor does exhibit a normal steroid specificity in yeast cells, but only at low levels of expressed receptor protein. Thus, at least under these conditions, genetic studies on steroid specificity are possible. At least part of the abnormal specificity that is sometimes observed for the glucocorticoid receptor in yeast appears to result from an artifact of the assay system and is not due to an abnormal receptor structure. This mechanism could account for all our data and so could provide the sole explanation of the abnormal specificity observed. However, it is also possible that part of the abnormal specificity could result from structural or other changes in receptor function, which occur when the receptor expression level is increased."

The BFA-resistant phenotypes have been stably maintained for more than 3 months in the absence of BFA. KB/BF-1 and KB/BF-2 showed 10-30-fold higher resistance to cytotoxicity of BFA but were 2-3-fold more sensitive to monensin and nigericin, than KB cells. KB/BF-1 showed aberrant structures of the Golgi complex with poorly developed cisternae surrounded by many small vesicles. Immunocytochemical studies were done with antibodies against a Golgi-specific antigen (chronic rheumatoid arthritis antigen) and a coatomer subunit (beta-subunit for coat proteins of non-clathrin-coated vesicles). Golgi-specific markers were distributed into the small vesicles which were localized diffusedly in cytoplasm of KB/BF-1 cells. Such Golgi markers were observed in a strictly confined perinuclear region of the parental KB cells, whereas in the mutant cells the markers were distributed more diffusedly in dot-like structures at perinuclear regions. In addition, when exposed to BFA, the mutant and parental cells showed a different distribution of these markers. Synthesis and maturation of low density lipoprotein receptor showed apparently slower rates in processing of low density lipoprotein receptor in KB/BF-1 and KB/BF-2 cells than those observed in their parental KB cells. Protein secretion in KB/BF-1 and KB/BF-2 cells was about 30% less than that in KB cells. Much less inhibition by BFA on the secretion was observed in KB/BF-1 and KB/BF-2 cells. A BFA-resistant mutation in BFA-resistant KB cell lines appears to affect assembly of the Golgi apparatus as well as some Golgi-specific functions."

The uptake of iron by ghosts presented the characteristics of a transporter-mediated process: it responded to osmotic challenge, the rate of transport increased when iron was present in the opposing side, and the transport rate showed the temperature dependence typical of membrane-mediated processes. The transport of iron was dependent on an associated influx of Cl- in order to keep electroneutrality. Other transition metals, such as Cu2+, Zn2+, and Co2+, inhibited the transport of Fe2+. The overall characteristics of the system make reticulocyte sealed ghosts a very useful model in determining the basic mechanisms of membrane iron transport."
https://openalex.org/W1670281168,"An artificial recombination site hixC composed of two identical half- sites that bind the Hin recombinase served as a better operator in vivo than the wild type site hixL (Hughes, K. T., Youderian, P., and Simon, M. I (1988) Genes & Dev. 2, 937-948). In vitro binding assays such as gel retardation assay and methylation protection assay demonstrated that Hin binds to hixC as tightly as it binds to hixL, even when the sites are located in negatively supercoiled plasmids. However, hixC served as a poor recombination site when it was subjected to the standard inversion assay in vitro. hixC showed a 16-fold slower inversion rate than the wild type. A series of biochemical assays designed to probe different stages of the Hin-mediated inversion reaction, demonstrated that Hin dimers bound to hixC have difficulty in forming paired hix site intermediates. KMnO4 and S1 nuclease assays detected an anomalous structure of the center of hixC only when the site was in negatively supercoiled plasmids. Mutational analysis in the central region of hixC and assays of paired hix site formation with topoisomers of the hixC substrate plasmid suggested that Hin is not able to pair hixC sites because of the presence of the anomalous structure in the center of the site. The structure does not behave like a DNA cruciform since Hin dimers still bind efficiently to the site. It is thought to consist of a short denatured bubble encompassing 2 base pairs. During the study of mutations in the center of hixC, it was found that Hin is not able to cleave DNA if a guanine residue is one of the two central nucleotides close to the cleavage site. Furthermore, Hin acts in a concerted fashion and cannot cleave any DNA strand if one of the four strands in the inversion intermediate is not cleavable."

We demonstrate here that Gl-260 is a complex of 170- and 85-kDa TGF-beta binding proteins. Under denaturing conditions the integrity of Gl-260 is maintained through the cross-linking of one monomer of the disulfide-linked TGF-beta 1 homodimer to Gl-85 and of the other monomer to the 100-kDa subunit of Gl-170. In addition, some Gl-260 complexes are maintained by direct cross-linking of Gl-85 to the 100-kDa subunit of Gl-170. One-dimensional peptide maps of Gl-85 and the 100-kDa subunit of Gl-170 indicate that they have distinctly different ligand binding domains. In contrast, peptide maps of Gl-85 and the type II receptor of normal rat kidney fibroblasts are similar. The biological responses of isolated glomeruli to TGF-beta appear to parallel those of cultured glomerular cells which are without detectable Gl-170 and Gl-260 binding proteins."
