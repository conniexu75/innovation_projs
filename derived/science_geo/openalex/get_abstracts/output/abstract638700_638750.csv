https://openalex.org/W2970871002,"The apolipoprotein e4 allele (APOE4) is the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). APOE4 carriers develop systemic metabolic dysfunction decades before showing AD symptoms. Accumulating evidence shows that the metabolic dysfunction accelerates AD development, including exacerbated amyloid-beta (Aβ) retention, neuroinflammation and cognitive decline. Therefore, preserving metabolic function early on may be critical to reducing the risk for AD. Here, we show that inulin increases beneficial microbiota and decreases harmful microbiota in the feces of young, asymptomatic APOE4 transgenic (E4FAD) mice and enhances metabolism in the cecum, periphery and brain, as demonstrated by increases in the levels of SCFAs, tryptophan-derived metabolites, bile acids, glycolytic metabolites and scyllo-inositol. We show that inulin also reduces inflammatory gene expression in the hippocampus. This knowledge can be utilized to design early precision nutrition intervention strategies that use a prebiotic diet to enhance systemic metabolism and may be useful for reducing AD risk in asymptomatic APOE4 carriers."

STAT3 has been demonstrated to participate in the maintenance of bone homeostasis in osteoblasts, but its role in osteoclasts in vivo remains poorly defined. Here, we generated a conditional knockout mouse model in which Stat3 was deleted in osteoclasts using a cathepsin K-Cre (Ctsk-Cre) driver. We observed that osteoclast-specific Stat3 deficiency caused increased bone mass in mice, which we attributed to impaired bone catabolism by osteoclasts. Stat3-deficient bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) showed decreased expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasm 1 (NFATc1), and reduced osteoclast differentiation determined by decreases in osteoclast number, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity, and expression of osteoclast marker genes. Enforced expression of NFATc1 in Stat3-deficient BMMs rescued the impaired osteoclast differentiation. Mechanistically, we revealed that STAT3 could drive the transcription of NFATc1 by binding to its promoter. Furthermore, preventing STAT3 activation by using an inhibitor of upstream phosphorylases, AG490, also impaired osteoclast differentiation and formation in a similar way as gene deletion of Stat3. In summary, our data provide the first evidence that STAT3 is significant in osteoclast differentiation and bone homeostasis in vivo, and it may be identified as a potential pharmacological target for the treatment of bone metabolic diseases through regulation of osteoclast activity.

Excess osteoclastic activity abolishes the balance in bone remodeling and causes skeletal metabolic diseases (1Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L.

Osteoporosis is a bone metabolic disease with the highest prevalence, which seriously affects the quality of life of patients and causes tremendous economic costs in both developing and developed countries (2Cummings S.R. Melton L.J. Epidemiology and outcomes of osteoporotic fractures.Lancet. 2002; 359 (12049882): 1761-176710.1016/S0140-6736(02)08657-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2805) Google Scholar). Even in the United States, more than 1.5 million fractures are caused by osteoporosis each year (3Black D.M. Rosen C.J. Clinical practice. Postmenopausal osteoporosis.N. Engl. J.

In addition, patients using bisphosphonates, the first-line antiresorptive therapy, are at risk of adverse effects, including osteonecrosis of the jaw (4Wotton C.J. Green J. Brown A. Armstrong M.E.G.

Osteoclasts are specialized cells derived from the monocyte/macrophage hematopoietic lineage. There are two critical extracellular factors that are essential for the differentiation of osteoclast precursors, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) (1Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Osteoclast differentiation and activation.Nature. 2003; 423 (12748652): 337-34210.1038/nature01658Crossref PubMed Scopus (4916) Google Scholar). M-CSF and RANKL promote the expression of transcriptional factors such as nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasm 1 (NFATc1), and c-Fos, to induce osteoclast differentiation. NFATc1 belongs to the NFAT family, which plays a critical role in osteoclast formation and function (5Takayanagi H. Kim S. Koga T. Nishina H. Isshiki M. Yoshida H. Saiura A. Isobe M. Yokochi T.

NFATc1 is functionally linked with another transcription factor c-Fos, which may bind to the promoter region of NFATc1 to induce NFATc1 expression (6Ikeda F. Nishimura R. Matsubara T. Tanaka S.

In recent years, increasing numbers of researchers have reported the involvement of other signaling molecules in regulating osteoclast precursor differentiation and function, particularly in the RANKL-induced expression and activity of c-Fos–NFATc1 (1Boyle W.J.

The signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family, which transmits signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus, plays a central role in cell survival and functional activities (11Hirano T. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Roles of STAT3 in mediating the cell growth, differentiation and survival signals relayed through the IL-6 family of cytokine receptors.Oncogene. 2000; 19 (10851053): 2548-255610.1038/sj.onc.1203551Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). It is well-known that STATs regulate cell immunity and cancer progression (12Yu H. Lee H. Herrmann A. Buettner R. Jove R.

Inflammatory signaling such as IL-6–JAK–STAT has recently been defined as a trigger involved in bone resorption due to its critical role in inducing expression of RANKL (13Mori T. Miyamoto T.

Falank C. Reagan M.R. Interleukin-6 interweaves the bone marrow microenvironment, bone loss, and multiple myeloma.Front. Endocrinol. 2018; 9 (30671025): 78810.3389/fendo.2018.00788Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), although this remains controversial (16Johnson R.W. McGregor N.E. Brennan H.J. Crimeen-Irwin B.

There are also reports of the involvement of the classic inflammatory cytokines such as STATs in maintaining the balance of bone metabolism. Among the seven STATs, STAT3 is reported to be the most relevant to bone homeostasis (17Li J. JAK-STAT and bone metabolism.JAKSTAT. 2013; 2 (24069548): e2393010.4161/jkst.23930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specific inactivation of STAT3 in osteoblasts in vivo decreases bone formation (18Itoh S. Udagawa N. Takahashi N. Yoshitake F. Narita H. Ebisu S. Ishihara K.

As for osteoclasts, several studies have reported that protein inhibitor of activated STAT3 (PIAS3) diminishes osteoclastogenesis (20Kim K. Lee J. Kim J.H. Jin H.M. Zhou B. Lee S.Y. Kim N.

Darvin P. Kang D.Y. Sp N. Byun H.J. Lee C.H. Lee H.K. Yang Y.M. Methylsulfonylmethane inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in BMMs by suppressing NF-κB and STAT3 activities.PLoS ONE. 2016; 11 (27447722): e015989110.1371/journal.pone.0159891Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, direct evidence demonstrating the participation of STAT3 in osteoclast formation and bone metabolism in vivo is still required, and the underlying mechanism still needs to be further explored. In this study, we provided the first evidence that STAT3 participated in osteoclast differentiation and bone metabolism in vivo with a conditional knockout mouse model. Additionally, we showed that STAT3 regulated the transcription of NFATc1 signaling in osteoclasts. This study not only highlighted the significance of STAT3 in osteoclast differentiation and bone catabolism, but also provided a potential molecular target for treatment of osteoclast-induced bone metabolic diseases. To determine the specific role of STAT3 in osteoclasts, Stat3fl/fl mice (hereafter called WT) were crossed with Ctsk-Cre mice, in which the osteoclast-specific expression of Cre was driven by the promoter of cathepsin K (Ctsk). Stat3 was conditionally knocked out in osteoclasts by generating Stat3fl/fl;Ctsk-Cre mice (hereafter called Stat3Ctsk, Fig. 1A). Western blotting confirmed the effective depletion of STAT3 protein in bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) in Stat3Ctsk mice compared with the WT mice (Fig. 1B). Micro-CT was used to analyze the changes of bone mass and microarchitecture in Stat3-deificient mice (Fig. 1C). Analysis of the quantitative microarchitectural parameters of femora from 20-week-old male and female Stat3Ctsk mice revealed marked increases of trabecular bone mass compared with their Stat3fl/fl littermates, such as bone mineral density (BMD, Fig. 1D), bone volume fraction (BV/TV, Fig. 1E), and trabecular thickness (Tb.Th., Fig. 1F), trabecular number (Tb.N., Fig. 1G), and trabecular separation (Tb.Sp., Fig. 1H). Although there was no difference in cortical bone thickness (Ct.Th., Fig. 1I), bone mineral density of cortical bone was increased in the Stat3Ctsk mice compared with the control group (Ct.BMD, Fig. 1J). We next analyzed the structural integrity of femora from 20-week-old Stat3Ctsk and Stat3fl/fl littermate mice via three-point bending tests, which showed increased bone stiffness of Stat3Ctsk femora compared with controls (Fig. 2, A–C). H&E staining confirmed increased trabecular bone mass and Tb.Th. of the femur from male and female 20-week-old Stat3Ctsk mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, 8-week-old male and female mice were also included in this study to determine the effect of STAT3 on the early stage of bone formation during development. H&E staining showed the same trend of increasing bone mass in 8-week-old Stat3Ctsk mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 2E). These results indicated that deletion of Stat3 in osteoclasts resulted in an increase of bone mass.Figure 2Deletion of Stat3 in osteoclasts led to an increase of bone stiffness.

To determine whether the increased bone mass in Stat3Ctsk mice was the result of the effects on bone resorption or bone formation, or both, histological analyses of femora were performed. First, bone formation activity was compared between femora from 8-week-old male and female WT and Stat3Ctsk mice by calcein and alizarin red double-labeling. The results indicated that neither trabecular nor cortical bone formation activities were influenced in Stat3Ctsk mice (Fig. 3A), as represented by mineral apposition rate (MAR, Fig. 3, B and C). These results excluded the possibility that deletion of Stat3 in osteoclasts induced an increase of bone mass through indirect promotion of osteogenesis. We then focused on the changes in bone resorption in Stat3Ctsk mice. As shown by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining, there were far fewer TRAP-positive multinuclear osteoclasts detected surrounding the trabecular bone of male and female Stat3Ctsk mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 3, D–F). We confirmed the decrease in the number of osteoclasts in samples from 8- and 20-week-old Stat3Ctsk mice, which indicated that the decrease in bone resorption might be the main contributor to the increased bone mass in Stat3Ctsk mice. These data implied that the increased bone mass caused by ablation of Stat3 in osteoclasts resulted from decreased bone resorption rather than increased bone formation. Having determined that the bone mass increase in Stat3Ctsk mice was mainly the result of a direct decrease in bone resorption, we wondered whether Stat3 was the driver of osteoclast differentiation in a cell-autonomous manner. To test this, we isolated BMMs from 4-week-old WT and Stat3Ctsk mice and cultured them with 20 ng/ml M-CSF and 20 ng/ml RANKL for 7 days. The cells seeded into 96-well plates were examined by TRAP staining. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, there were fewer TRAP+ giant multinuclear osteoclasts formed, accompanied by relatively lower TRAP activity of culture supernatant in BMMs from Stat3Ctsk mice compared with WT mice 7 days after seeding. Western blotting confirmed the decreased level of STAT3 protein in Stat3Ctsk BMMs (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, the expression of osteoclast-specific marker genes during osteoclast differentiation, such as osteoclast-associated receptor (Oscar), dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein (Dc Stamp), and Ctsk were determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR), and the protein level of CTSK was determined by Western blotting. The down-regulation of these marker genes in BMMs from Stat3Ctsk mice indicated that osteoclast differentiation was impaired due to deletion of Stat3 in a cell-autonomous manner (Fig. 4, D–G). To exclude the possibility that impaired osteoclast differentiation was due to differences in the cell populations, we next infected BMMs from 4-week-old Stat3fl/fl mice with adenovirus expressing GFP (Ad-GFP) and CRE recombinase (Ad-CRE) to knock out Stat3 in vitro. The number of TRAP+ osteoclasts and the level of TRAP activity in the culture supernatant of infected BMMs were decreased in Ad-CRE–expressed cells compared with the Ad-GFP–infected group (Fig. 4, H and I). Western blotting indicated a decrease in STAT3 at the protein level in BMMs infected by Ad-CRE (Fig. 4J). Expression of osteoclast-specific genes was also impeded in the Ad-CRE group when evaluated by qPCR and Western blotting (Fig. 4, K–N). All these data supported the notion that the increase of bone mass in Stat3Ctsk mice resulted from the reduced catabolism secondary to impeded osteoclast differentiation and formation as well as a cell-autonomous action through which STAT3 drove osteoclast differentiation. NFATc1 plays a critical role in osteoclast formation and function (5Takayanagi H. Kim S. Koga T. Nishina H. Isshiki M. Yoshida H. Saiura A. Isobe M. Yokochi T. Inoue J. Wagner E.F. Mak T.W. Kodama T.

To determine whether NFATc1 was the direct downstream target of Stat3 in osteoclasts, we examined the expression of NFATc1 in BMMs isolated from WT and Stat3Ctsk mice by qPCR and Western blotting. The expression of NFATc1 was down-regulated at both the mRNA and protein level in STAT3-deficient BMMs (Fig. 5, A and B). The same results were obtained by deleting Stat3 in vitro by using adenovirus (Fig. 5, C and D). In addition, immunofluorescence staining displayed a decreased expression of NFATc1 in Stat3Ctsk BMMs compared with WT BMMs (Fig. 5, E and F). As we observed that the mRNA level of NFATc1 was affected in Stat3Ctsk BMMs, we hypothesized that STAT3 might regulate the transcription of NFATc1. By using sequence analysis, we identified two canonical STAT3-binding motifs (TTXXXGGAA) in the promoter of NFATc1. We then constructed a luciferase reporter driven by the NFATc1 promoter in the pGL3 vector to analyze the effect of STAT3 on the transcriptional activity of NFATc1. Indeed, we found that the activity of the luciferase reporter driven by the NFATc1 promoter was enhanced by STAT3 expression, which suggested that STAT3 promoted the transcriptional activity of NFATc1 (Fig. 5G). Furthermore, we directly determined whether STAT3 could bind to the NFATc1 promoter by using ChIP assay. As shown in Fig. 5H, STAT3 was enriched in the promoter of NFATc1 when the antibody against STAT3 was used for immunoprecipitation compared with immunoprecipitation with control IgG, indicating that STAT3 is the transcription factor for NFATc1 gene expression. It has been reported that c-Fos is the essential transcription factor for NFATc1 expression (6Ikeda F. Nishimura R. Matsubara T. Tanaka S. Inoue J. Reddy S.V. Hata K. Yamashita K. Hiraga T. Watanabe T. Kukita T. Yoshioka K. Rao A. Yoneda T. Critical roles of c-Jun signaling in regulation of NFAT family and RANKL-regulated osteoclast differentiation.J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114 (15314684): 475-48410.1172/JCI200419657Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 7Takayanagi H. The role of NFAT in osteoclast formation.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2007; 1116 (18083930): 227-23710.1196/annals.1402.071Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Thus, we were wondering about the relationship between STAT3 and c-Fos in regulating NFATc1 expression. Sequence analysis revealed that the canonical STAT3-binding motifs were close to c-Fos–binding motifs in the promotor of NFATc1. Therefore, we speculated that STAT3 might functionally cooperate with c-Fos to regulate NFATc1 transcription. To test this hypothesis, we co-transfected STAT3 and c-Fos in 293T cells and examined their effect on NFATc1 reporter activity. We found that c-Fos increased NFATc1 promoter activity, and STAT3 could further promote this effect (Fig. 5I). Moreover, we found that STAT3 and c-Fos formed a physical complex. The co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay identified a protein interaction between STAT3 and c-Fos (Fig. 5J). These data suggested a potential cooperative action between STAT3 and c-Fos in regulating the transcription of NFATc1. To further verify whether decreased NFATc1 transcription contributed to the impaired osteoclast differentiation caused by STAT3 deficiency, we ectopically expressed NFATc1 in Stat3-deficient BMMs using lentivirus (Lenti-NFATc1 and Lenti-GFP). As shown in Fig. 6, A and B, the impaired osteoclast differentiation and formation were restored in the Lenti-NFATc1 group, as determined by an increase of TRAP+ osteoclasts and TRAP activity in the culture supernatant (Fig. 6, A and B). These results were consistent with increased expression of osteoclast marker genes in Lenti-NFATc1–infected Stat3Ctsk BMMs compared with the Stat3Ctsk BMMs infected with Lenti-GFP (Fig. 6, C–F). Western blotting confirmed the ectopic expression of NFATc1 in Stat3Ctsk BMMs (Fig. 6F). These data demonstrated that STAT3–NFATc1 signaling was critical for osteoclast differentiation and formation. STAT3 has been considered as a molecular target in a series of diseases, including cancer and immune disorders (12Yu H. Lee H. Herrmann A. Buettner R. Jove R. Revisiting STAT3 signalling in cancer: new and unexpected biological functions.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2014; 14 (25342631): 736-74610.1038/nrc3818Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar); therefore, we wondered whether STAT3 could be a suitable pharmacological target to regulate the activity of osteoclasts. Interestingly, we found that different mutant forms of STAT3 may affect its activity on the NFATc1 promoter. As shown in Fig. 7A, constitutively-active STAT3 (STAT3-3C, a gift from Dr. Feng (23Wang G. Yu Y. Sun C. Liu T. Liang T. Zhan L. Lin X. Feng X.H. STAT3 selectively interacts with Smad3 to antagonize TGF-β signalling.Oncogene. 2016; 35 (26616859): 4388-439810.1038/onc.2015.446Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar)) promoted NFATc1 promoter activity more dramatically than STAT3, but a dominant-negative mutation of STAT3 (STAT3-DN, a gift from Dr. Feng (23Wang G. Yu Y. Sun C. Liu T. Liang T. Zhan L. Lin X. Feng X.H.

Furthermore, we found that AG490, the classical JAK2–STAT3 inhibitor that impairs the phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of STAT3, could impair the activity of STAT3 on NFATc1 transcription (Fig. 7B). Subsequently, we determined the effects of AG490 on RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation of BMMs in vitro. BMMs obtained from 4-week-old WT mice were treated with M-CSF and RANKL in the absence or presence of different concentrations of AG490 according to a previously-described method (24Dai Q. Xie F. Han Y. Ma X. Zhou S. Jiang L. Zou W. Wang J.

The phosphorylation level of STAT3 decreased in the groups treated with 5, 10, and 20 μm AG490 compared with the control group (Fig. 7C). The osteoclast number (Fig. 6D) and the expression of osteoclast markers decreased in all three AG490-treated groups compared with the control group (Fig. 7, E–H). These results indicated that STAT3 may be a potential pharmacological target for the treatment of bone metabolic diseases through the regulation of osteoclast activity and bone resorption. Bone remodeling is a balance between anabolism and catabolism. Osteoclasts, one of the most important cell types in these processes, interact with osteoblasts through complex cross-talk (25Chen X.

It relies on the interplay between intrinsic forces generated by molecular motors1–3, extrinsic forces exerted by adjacent cells4–7 and mechanical resistance forces due to tissue elasticity or friction8–10. Understanding how mechanical forces influence morphogenesis at the cellular and molecular level remains a challenge1. Recent work has outlined how small incremental steps power cell-autonomous epithelial shape changes1–3, which suggests the existence of specific mechanisms that stabilize cell shapes and counteract cell elasticity. Beyond the twofold stage, embryonic elongation in Caenorhabditis elegans is dependent on both muscle activity7 and the epidermis; the tension generated by muscle activity triggers a mechanotransduction pathway in the epidermis that promotes axis elongation7. Here we identify a network that stabilizes cell shapes in C. elegans embryos at a stage that involves non-autonomous mechanical interactions between epithelia and contractile cells. We searched for factors genetically or molecularly interacting with the p21-activating kinase homologue PAK-1 and acting in this pathway, thereby identifying the α-spectrin SPC-1. Combined absence of PAK-1 and SPC-1 induced complete axis retraction, owing to defective epidermal actin stress fibre. Modelling predicts that a mechanical viscoplastic deformation process can account for embryo shape stabilization. Molecular analysis suggests that the cellular basis for viscoplasticity originates from progressive shortening of epidermal microfilaments that are induced by muscle contractions relayed by actin-severing proteins and from formin homology 2 domain-containing protein 1 (FHOD-1) formin bundling. Our work thus identifies an essential molecular lock acting in a developmental ratchet-like process. Molecular analysis and mathematical modelling are combined to identify a network of factors that account for viscoplastic deformation in elongation of Caenorhabditis elegans during embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W2970284052,"Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) plays important roles in plant developmental growth, especially in root architecture. The similarity in both chemical structure and biosynthetic pathway suggests a potential linkage between melatonin and auxin signaling. However the molecular mechanism regulating this melatonin-mediated root architecture changes is not yet elucidated. In the present study, we re-analyzed previously conducted transcriptome data and identified 16 auxin-related genes whose expression patterns were altered by treatment with melatonin. Several of these genes encoding important auxin transporters or strongly affecting auxin transport were significantly down regulated. In wild type Arabidopsis, Melatonin inhibited both primary root growth and hypocotyl elongation, but enhanced lateral root development in a dose dependent manner. However, the lateral-root-promoting role of melatonin was abolished when each individual null mutant affecting auxin transport including pin5, wag1, tt4 and tt5, was examined. Furthermore, melatonin acts synergistically with auxin to promote lateral root development in wild type Arabidopsis, but such synergistic effects were absent in knockout mutants of individual auxin transport related genes examined. These results strongly suggest that melatonin enhances lateral root development through regulation of auxin distribution via modulation of auxin transport. A working model is proposed to explain how melatonin and auxin act together to promote lateral root development. The present study deepens our understanding of the relationship between melatonin and auxin signaling in plant species."

The heterogeneity of induced kinases prevents kinase targeting by a single kinase inhibitor and presents a major challenge to the treatment of therapeutically recalcitrant HER2-positive breast cancers (HER2+ BCs). As a result, there is a critical need for effective treatment that attacks the aberrant kinome activation associated with resistance to HER2-targeted therapy. Here, we describe a novel treatment strategy that targets cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) in HER2 inhibitor-resistant (HER2iR) breast cancer. We show that both HER2 inhibitor-sensitive (HER2iS) and HER2iR breast cancer cell lines exhibit high sensitivity to THZ1, a newly identified covalent inhibitor of the transcription regulatory kinase CDK7. CDK7 promotes cell cycle progression through inhibition of transcription, rather than via direct phosphorylation of classical CDK targets. The transcriptional kinase activity of CDK7 is regulated by HER2, and by the receptor tyrosine kinases activated in response to HER2 inhibition, as well as by the downstream SHP2 and PI3K/AKT pathways. A low dose of THZ1 displayed potent synergy with the HER2 inhibitor lapatinib in HER2iR BC cells in vitro. Dual HER2 and CDK7 inhibition induced tumor regression in two HER2iR BC xenograft models in vivo. Our data support the utilization of CDK7 inhibition as an additional therapeutic avenue that blocks the activation of genes engaged by multiple HER2iR kinases."

The phagocytosis of muscle cell debris induces a switch of pro-inflammatory macrophages into an anti-inflammatory phenotype, but the cellular receptors mediating this phagocytosis are still unclear. In this paper, we report novel roles for SRB1 (scavenger receptor class BI) in regulating macrophage phagocytosis and macrophage phenotypic transitions for skeletal muscle regeneration. In a mouse model of cardiotoxin-induced muscle injury/regeneration, infiltrated macrophages expressed a high level of SRB1. Using SRB1 knockout mice, we observed the impairment of muscle regeneration along with decreased myogenin expression and increased matrix deposit.

Scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SRB1) was originally identified as a high-density lipoprotein receptor that binds HDL with high affinity and mediates both the selective lipid uptake of cholesterol esters from lipid-rich HDL to cells and the efflux of unesterified cholesterol from cells to HDL and is required for microvillar channel formation and the localization of HDL particles to the surface of adrenocortical cells (18Acton S.

However, type I and II class A macrophage scavenger receptors (SR-AI/II) are reported as homotrimeric membrane proteins of mononuclear phagocytes mediating phagocytosis of apoptotic thymocytes and endocytosis of modified lipoproteins (24Thomas C.A.

SRB1, as a phosphatidylserine receptor, enables Sertoli cells to recognize and phagocytose apoptotic spermatogenic cells at all stages of differentiation (26Nakagawa A. Shiratsuchi A. Tsuda K. Nakanishi Y. In vivo analysis of phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by testicular Sertoli cells.Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2005; 71 (15791597): 166-17710.1002/mrd.20278Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, SRB1 may regulate macrophages’ phagocytosis. In this study, we aimed to examine the role of SRB1 in macrophage phagocytosis in injured skeletal muscle. We found that, through regulation of phagocytosis, SRB1 regulated macrophage differentiation, contributing to muscle regeneration. We used a muscle injury/recovery models to study the impact of SRB1 on muscle regeneration in vivo. Cardiotoxin was injected into the tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of WT mice (C57BL/6J background) for inducing muscle injury, and the mice whose TA muscles were injected with PBS served as the sham group. The amount of SRB1 protein was sharply increased 1 day after injury compared with uninjured muscles (Fig. 1A). Immunofluorescence staining showed the presence of SRB1 expression in the injured skeletal muscle tissue at day 3. To identify whether the increased SRB1 was due to infiltration of macrophages, we double-stained Mac2, a marker of phagocytic macrophage, and SRB1 in the muscle 3 days after injury. As shown in Fig. 1B, the staining of Mac2 was co-localized with SRB1, which indicated that SRB1 is primarily expressed in phagocytic macrophages. To confirm that macrophage expresses SRB1, we isolated bone marrow–derived macrophages. By immunostaining with F4/80 (another macrophage marker), we found that F4/80 co-localized with SRB1 (Fig. 1C). These findings indicate that macrophages express SRB1 in injured skeletal muscle. To determine whether SRB1 affects the capacity for muscle regeneration, cardiotoxin (CTX) was injected into TA muscles of both SRB1 KO and WT mice. There was no significant difference between SRB1 KO and WT muscle before injury. Five days after injury, new myofibers (identified by central nuclei) formed in TA muscles of WT mice, but less in TA muscles of SRB1 KO mice (Fig. 2A). At day 15, muscles from SRB1 KO mice had smaller new myofibers compared with those of WT mice (Fig. 2, B and C). The size distribution of myofibers showed that fiber sizes have a significant left shift in SRB1 KO mice from those in WT mice, which indicated that muscle regeneration capacity was decreased in SRB1 KO mice (Fig. 2D). Muscle regeneration was also quantified by TA muscle weight and the ratio of TA muscle weight to body weight at 15 days after injury; the TA muscle weight and ratio of TA muscle weight to body weight was lower in SRB1 KO mice than in WT mice (Fig. 2E). Myogenic regulatory factor myogenin-positive cells were counted to determine muscle regeneration capacity. The number of myogenin-positive cells was significantly lower in the injured muscle of SRB1 KO mice versus WT mice (Fig. 2F). These results indicate that SRB1 is required for muscle progenitor cell differentiation and skeletal muscle regeneration. To detect the interstitial fibrosis in injured muscle, the collagen deposition was measured by Masson’s trichrome staining at 15 days after muscle damage. There was significantly increased interstitial fibrosis in injured muscle of SRB1 KO mice compared with that of WT mice, whereas there was no significant difference between fibrosis in sham muscle of WT mice and sham muscle of SRB1 KO mice (Fig. 3, A and B). The amount of TGFβ (a pro-fibrotic cytokine) was markedly higher in the muscle of SRB1 KO mice than in WT mice after the injection of CTX for 15 days (Fig. 3, C and D). These data suggest that knockout of SRB1 promotes interstitial fibrosis during skeletal muscle regeneration. We performed bone marrow transplantation experiments to address whether SRB1 deficiency in skeletal muscle cells or bone marrow–derived cells inhibited muscle regeneration. Bone marrow chimeric mice were reconstituted after transplantation of WT or SRB1-deficient bone marrow cells. 8 weeks after bone marrow transplantation, mice underwent CTX injury. At day 15, mice that received SRB1 knockout bone marrow had smaller new myofibers compared with that received WT bone marrow, regardless of the genotype of the recipient mice (Fig. 4, A and B). The fiber sizes have a left shift in mice that received SRB1 knockout bone marrow compared with those that received WT bone marrow (Fig. 4C). The TA muscle weight and ratio of TA muscle weight to body weight was lower in mice that received SRB1 knockout bone marrow compared with those that received WT bone marrow (Fig. 4D). Thus, SRB1 deficiency in bone marrow cells rather than skeletal muscle cells is responsible for the muscle regeneration defect. Pro-inflammatory (M1) macrophage to anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophage transition plays a key role during skeletal muscle regeneration. Considering SRB1 expressed on macrophage, we addressed whether macrophage transition was regulated by SRB1 deficiency. We measured muscle macrophage phenotype by flow cytometry. The F4/80 and CD11b antibodies were used to identify macrophages, and the Ly6C antibody was used to identify different macrophage subsets. Ly6C+ macrophages were considered as the pro-inflammatory (M1) macrophages, whereas Ly6C− macrophages were considered as the anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophages (Fig. 5A). 3 days after injury, the total and Ly6C− macrophages were decreased in SRB1 KO mice compared with those in WT mice, and Ly6C+ macrophages were increased in SRB1 KO mice (Fig. 5B). The ratio of Ly6C+ macrophage to Ly6C− macrophage was increased in SRB1 KO mice compared with that in WT mice (Fig. 5C). To further investigate the phenotype of the macrophages infiltrating damaged muscle, we isolated WT and SRB1 KO macrophage by cell sorting and detected pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) marker expression by real-time PCR (Fig. 6). Results showed that macrophages from SRB1 KO mice expressed M1-specific genes (IL12p35, IL12p40, and IL6) more strongly than macrophages from WT mice. Conversely, macrophages from WT mice expressed M2-specific genes (IL13ra1, CD206, and CD163) more strongly than macrophages from SRB1 KO mice. There was no significant difference in TGFβ expression between WT and SRB1 KO macrophages. We also measured the levels of M1-specific (IL1β) and M2-specific (arginase 1, Arg1) gene expression in TA muscle by immunohistochemistry analysis. The level of IL1β was increased in the muscle of SRB1 KO mice at 5 days after injury, and the level of Arg1 was significantly decreased in the muscle of SRB1 KO mice compared with that of WT mice (Fig. 7). These results demonstrated that SRB1 deficiency limits pro-inflammatory macrophages switch into anti-inflammatory macrophages in response to acute muscle injury. Study has shown that infiltrated macrophage phagocytosis will support myogenesis (6Arnold L. Henry A. Poron F. Baba-Amer Y. van Rooijen N. Plonquet A. Gherardi R.K. Chazaud B. Inflammatory monocytes recruited after skeletal muscle injury switch into antiinflammatory macrophages to support myogenesis.J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204 (17485518): 1057-106910.1084/jem.20070075Crossref PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar). Because SRB1 was mainly expressed in macrophages, we isolated macrophages from bone marrow of WT and SRB1 KO mice and treated them with C2C12 myoblast debris to measure the phagocytosis of macrophages. Myoblast debris was incubated with macrophages for 1, 3, and 12 h. The myoblast debris could be engulfed by WT macrophages (Fig. 8A). Phagocytosis was quantified by counting fluorescent microspheres inside of macrophage using flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 8B). The rate of phagocytosis was much lower in SRB1 KO mice compared with that in WT mice (Fig. 8C). Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that total macrophages were decreased in SRB1 KO mice compared with that in WT mice 3 days after injury (Fig. 5B). The migration assay was performed to evaluate the chemotaxis of WT and SRB1 KO macrophages to myoblast debris. SRB1 deficiency inhibited migration of macrophages with or without myoblast debris treatment (Fig. 8, D and E). Thus, SRB1 knockout limits macrophage phagocytosis of myoblast debris and limits macrophage migration. To assess the role of SRB1 in macrophage phenotype transition, we detected the effects of M1-specific or M2-specific gene expression in bone marrow derived macrophages from WT and SRB1 KO mice by adding LPS, myoblast debris, or LPS plus myoblast debris. After activation with these stimuli, we detected the M1-specific and M2-specific gene expression on RNA levels by real-time PCR. Deletion of SRB1 led to increased M1-specific gene expression (IL12p40, TNFα) and decreased M2-specific gene expression (CD206) after LPS plus myoblast debris activation (Fig. 9, A–C). We also collected WT and SRB1 KO macrophage conditioned medium and detected cytokine expression with the BD Biosciences Cytometric Bead Array (CBA) mouse inflammation kit. Deletion of SRB1 led to increased M1-specific gene expression (IL6, TNF, IL12p70, and MCP1) after LPS activation, and deletion of SRB1 led to increased M1-specific gene expression (IL6) and decreased M2-specific gene expression (IL10) after LPS plus myoblast debris activation (Fig. 9, E–J). These results confirmed that SRB1-deficient macrophages easily acquired M1 phenotypes but not M2 phenotypes. We investigated which downstream signaling pathway was activated by SRB1 in macrophages stimulated with LPS/myoblast debris. SRB1 deficiency increased phosphorylated ERK1/2 in macrophages with myoblast debris/LPS treatment (Fig. 10, A and B). To determine whether activation of the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway was necessary for IL10 expression of macrophages, U0126 was used to block activity of the ERK1/2 MAPK signal pathway. Pretreatment with U0126 significantly suppressed IL10 expression induced by LPS/myoblast debris (Fig. 10C). These results indicated that SRB1 deficiency promotes activation of the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway in macrophages, and the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway induced IL10 expression with treatment of LPS/myoblast debris. In this study, we identified the role of SRB1 on macrophage in skeletal muscle regeneration process. Our results indicated that SRB1, a scavenger receptor of macrophage, plays an important role in determining the microenvironment for muscle regeneration. SRB1-positive macrophages were significantly infiltrated into the CTX-injured skeletal muscle. Knockout of SRB1 impaired muscle regeneration capacity by regulating a switch from M1 into M2 macrophages. SRB1 deficiency in bone marrow cells was responsible for impaired muscle regeneration. The SRB1 is involved in phagocytosis and migration of macrophages, and SRB1 promoted the differentiation into M2 phenotype and inhibited differentiation into M1 phenotype in vitro. SRB1 deficiency promoted activation of ERK1/2 MAPK signaling in macrophages stimulated with LPS/myoblast debris. Thus, SRB1 promotes muscle regeneration by mediating the phagocytosis ability of macrophage and promoting M1 switch into M2 macrophage. It is well-known that inflammation is involved in skeletal muscle regeneration. In response to injury, inflammatory cells are infiltrated into the injury site. After acute muscle injury, the first-response inflammatory cells are neutrophils, which appear within 2 h in injured muscle (9Tidball J.G. Villalta S.A. Regulatory interactions between muscle and the immune system during muscle regeneration.Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp.

Following the infiltration of neutrophils, macrophages infiltrate into the injured muscle, with peak numbers at about 3 days. After that, macrophages begin to decline, and only a small number of macrophages maintain in muscle after 7 days (27Kohno S. Yamashita Y. Abe T. Hirasaka K. Oarada M. Ohno A. Teshima-Kondo S.

The number of total macrophages in injured muscle was suppressed in SRB1 KO mice (Fig. 5, A and B), suggesting that the decrease in total macrophage number in SRB1 KO mice might contribute to impaired muscle reg"
https://openalex.org/W2970733878,"An animal's stress response requires different adaptive strategies depending on the nature and duration of the stressor. Whereas acute stressors, such as predation, induce a rapid and energy-demanding fight-or-flight response, long-term environmental stressors induce the gradual and long-lasting activation of highly conserved cytoprotective processes1-3. In animals across the evolutionary spectrum, continued activation of the fight-or-flight response weakens the animal's resistance to environmental challenges4,5. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate the trade-off between the flight response and long-term stressors are poorly understood. Here we show that repeated induction of the flight response in Caenorhabditis elegans shortens lifespan and inhibits conserved cytoprotective mechanisms. The flight response activates neurons that release tyramine, an invertebrate analogue of adrenaline and noradrenaline. Tyramine stimulates the insulin-IGF-1 signalling (IIS) pathway and precludes the induction of stress response genes by activating an adrenergic-like receptor in the intestine. By contrast, long-term environmental stressors, such as heat or oxidative stress, reduce tyramine release and thereby allow the induction of cytoprotective genes. These findings demonstrate that a neural stress hormone supplies a state-dependent neural switch between acute flight and long-term environmental stress responses and provides mechanistic insights into how the flight response impairs cellular defence systems and accelerates ageing."
https://openalex.org/W2970972597,"The diagnosis of chronic wasting disease (CWD) relies on demonstration of the disease-associated misfolded CWD prion protein (PrPCWD) in brain or retropharyngeal lymph node tissue by immunodetection methods, e.g. ELISA and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The success of these methods relies on a quality sample of tissues, which requires both anatomical knowledge and considerable dissection to collect. As the prevalence of CWD continues to increase globally, the development of fast and cost-effective methods to detect the disease is vital to facilitate CWD detection and surveillance. To address these issues, we have evaluated third eyelids from CWD-infected deer and elk using real-time quaking induced conversion (RT-QuIC). We identified prion seeding activity in third eyelids in 24 of 25 (96%) CWD-infected white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). We detected RT-QuIC positivity in the third eyelid as early as 1 month after experimental CWD exposure. In addition, we identified prion seeding activity in third eyelids of 18 of 25 (72%) naturally exposed asymptomatic CWD-positive rocky mountain elk (Cervus canadensis nelson). We compared CWD detection by RT-QuIC and IHC in third eyelid, retropharyngeal lymph node, and brain in 10 deer in early symptomatic stage of disease. IHC detected PrPCWD deposition in third eyelid lymphoid follicles in 5 of 10 deer (50%) whereas third eyelids of all 10 animals were positive by RT-QuIC. This difference reflected in part a lower requirement for lymphoid follicle presence for seeding activity detection by RT-QuIC. In conclusion, RT-QuIC analysis of the third eyelid, an easily accessed tissue, has potential to advance CWD detection and testing compliance."

We find that LOXL2 and H3K4ox are higher in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) than those from other breast cancer subtypes. ChIP-seq revealed that H3K4ox is located primarily in heterochromatin, where it is involved in chromatin compaction. Knocking down LOXL2 reduces H3K4ox levels and causes chromatin decompaction, resulting in a sustained activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) and increased susceptibility to anticancer agents. This critical role that LOXL2 and oxidized H3 play in chromatin compaction and DDR suggests that functionally targeting LOXL2 could be a way to sensitize TNBC cells to conventional therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2970457052,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a devastating condition with high morbidity and mortality. AKI is characterized by tubular injury, inflammation, and vascular impairment. However, the role of interstitial fibroblasts in the pathogenesis of AKI is largely unknown. Here, we show that fibroblasts were activated, as defined by vimentin expression, at 1 h after AKI triggered by ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). They rapidly entered the cell cycle with Ki-67-positive staining, which started at 1 h and peaked at 12 h after IRI, whereas tubular cell proliferation peaked at 3 d. The trigger for such an early activation of fibroblasts was identified as sonic hedgehog (Shh), which was rapidly induced in renal tubules and could target interstitial fibroblasts. Tubule-specific knockout of Shh in mice inhibited fibroblast activation and aggravated kidney injury and functional decline after IRI. Likewise, pharmacologic inhibition of Shh signaling with cyclopamine also hindered fibroblast activation and exacerbated kidney damage. These studies uncover that tubule-derived Shh triggers the early activation of fibroblasts, which is required for kidney repair and regeneration. Our findings for the first time illustrate a previously unrecognized importance of interstitial fibroblasts in conferring renal protection in AKI.-Zhou, D., Fu, H., Liu, S., Zhang, L., Xiao, L., Bastacky, S.

We performed integrative analysis for 3 sets of prostate cancer (PCa) genomic data, and found that BMI1 and androgen receptor (AR) were positively correlated, suggesting that AR might regulate BMI1. Next, we showed that dihydrotestosterone (DHT) upregulated both mRNA and protein levels of BMI1 and that BMI1 was increased in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) from both human patients and a mouse xenograph model. We further identified an AR binding site in the promoter/enhancer region of BMI1, and confirmed BMI1 as the direct target of AR using gene-editing technology.

A secondary form of amyloidosis was identified in AKU and related to high circulating serum amyloid A (SAA) levels, which are linked with inflammation and oxidative stress and might contribute to disease progression and patients' poor quality of life.

Methods For this cross-sectional study, we analyzed the data of 911 bicyclists from two Latin American countries that have been experiencing a substantial growth of urban cycling during the last few years: Colombia and Argentina. Participants responded to an e-questionnaire on bicycling behaviors, mental health and cycling safety. Results Aging adults reported lower rates of risky behaviors and traffic crashes (around .38 in five years), and, on the other hand, more cycling protective behaviors, a higher risk perception and a better knowledge of traffic norms than both other adults (26–50 years old) and young cyclists (<26). Cycling behaviors and crashes were found to be significantly related to mental health indicators, the latter being higher in aging cyclists. However, this population remains more prone to distractions experienced while cycling than other age groups. Conclusions Although the behavioral features of aging adults were comparatively “safer” than the ones displayed by other age groups, factors such as cycling distractions and this population’s over-representation in traffic crashes suggest the need of enforcing policymaking for a better integration of this age segment in alternative transportation dynamics."

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), especially MMP-2, have been reported to underlie the pathogenesis of DM CMP by increasing extracellular collagen content. Purpose We hypothesized that two discrete MMP-2 isoforms (full length MMP-2, FL-MMP-2; N-terminal truncated MMP-2, NTT-MMP-2) are induced by high glucose stimulation in vitro and in an experimental diabetic heart model. Methods Rat cardiomyoblasts (H9C2 cells) were examined to determine whether high glucose can induce the expression of the two isoforms of MMP-2. For the in vivo study, we used the streptozotocin-induced DM mouse heart model and age-matched controls. The changes of each MMP-2 isoform expression in the diabetic mice hearts were determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Immunohistochemical stains were conducted to identify the location and patterns of MMP-2 isoform expression. Echocardiography was performed to compare and analyze the changes in cardiac function induced by diabetes. Results Quantitative RT-PCR and immunofluorescence staining showed that the two MMP-2 isoforms were strongly induced by high glucose stimulation in H9C2 cells. Although no definite histologic features of diabetic cardiomyopathy were observed in diabetic mice hearts, left ventricular systolic dysfunction was determined by echocardiography. Quantitative RT-PCR and IHC staining showed this abnormal cardiac function was accompanied with the increases in the mRNA levels of the two isoforms of MMP-2 and related to intracellular localization.

https://openalex.org/W2970078078,"Background Patient-centered care (PCC) offers opportunities for African health systems to improve quality of care. Nonetheless, PCC continually faces implementation challenges. In 2015, Uganda introduced PCC as a concept in their national quality improvement guidelines. In order to investigate whether and how this is implemented in practice, this study aims to identify relevant stakeholders’ views on the current quality of primary health care services and their understanding of PCC. This is an important step in understanding how the concept of PCC can be implemented in a resource constrained, sub-Saharan context like Uganda. Methods This qualitative study was conducted in Uganda at national, district and facility level, with a focus on three public and three private health centres. Data collection consisted of in-depth interviews (n = 49); focus group discussions (n = 7); and feedback meetings (n = 14) across the four main categories of stakeholders identified: patients/communities, health workers, policy makers and academia. Interviews and discussions explored stakeholder perceptions on the interpersonal aspects of quality primary health care and meanings attached to the concept of PCC. A content analysis of Ugandan policy documents mentioning PCC was also conducted. Thematic content analysis was conducted using NVivo 11 to organize and analyze the data. Findings and conclusion While Ugandan stakeholder groups have varying perceptions of PCC, they agree on the following: the need to involve patients in making decisions about their health, the key role of healthcare workers in that endeavor, and the importance of context in designing and implementing solutions. For that purpose, three avenues are recommended: Firstly, fora that include a wide range of stakeholders may offer a powerful opportunity to gain an inclusive vision on PCC in Uganda. Secondly, efforts need to be made to ensure that improved communication and information sharing–important components of PCC–translate to actual shared decision making. Lastly, the Ugandan health system needs to strengthen its engagement of the transformation from a community health worker system to a more comprehensive community health system. Cross-cutting the entire analysis, is the need to address, in a culturally-sensitive way, the many structural barriers in designing and implementing PCC policies. This is essential in ensuring the sustainable and effective implementation of PCC approaches in low- and middle-income contexts."

However, no suitable production host for miRNA containing exosomes of non-tumorigenic origin has yet been identified.

Furthermore, we demonstrated that pro-apoptotic miRNA containing CAP exosomes are taken up by ovarian cancer cells. Strikingly, delivery of functional exosomal miRNA led to downregulation of several reported target genes in the treated tumor cells. In summary, we revealed CAP cells of non-tumorigenic origin as a novel and efficient exosome production host with the potential to produce functional miRNA-loaded exosomes."

It is known that higher self-efficacy could contribute to better sexual and reproductive health outcomes including the use of condoms. However, there is limited research on the role of socio-demographic, behavioural and parental factors as predictors of condom-use self-efficacy. As a result, this exploratory study was designed to assess the predictors of self-efficacy for condom use among university students in Nigeria.A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 755 university students in Nigeria from February to April 2018. Self-efficacy for condom use was assessed by combining responses to 11-items measures of condom self-efficacy drawn from the work of Barkley and colleagues. We fitted a structural equation model to identify the pathways through which socio-demographic, behavioural and parental factors predict two constructs of condom-use self-efficacy (self-efficacy for condom purchase and use and partner communication self-efficacy) in the sample.Demographic factors such as age (β = -0.29, p<0.05) and sex (β = 0.42, p<0.05), as well as ratings on religious importance (β = -0.08, p<0.05) were directly associated with self-efficacy for condom purchase and use. These factors showed significantly mediated effects through sexual experience which also had a direct positive relationship (β = 0.73, p<0.05) with self-efficacy for condom purchase and use. The receipt of parental support, on the other hand, was directly associated with higher partner communication efficacy for condom use (β = 0.07, p<0.05). We found no evidence that the level of partner communication efficacy was directly associated with any of the behavioural, demographic or parental factors.The findings of this study affirm that sex, or age or having higher ratings on religious importance alone does not increases self-efficacy but also exposure to sexual activity through which these factors affect self-efficacy for condom purchase and use. These findings also highlight the need to address and strengthen condom use self-efficacy among young adults, particularly the sexually inexperienced, highly religious and young adults with limited support from their parent."

The purpose of this article is to explore the perception of smoking, and motivation and barriers to quit among smokers with type 2 diabetes. This exploratory study will help designing a smoking cessation intervention tailored to the needs of people with type 2 diabetes. We hypothesize both that living with diabetes and gender may raise additional difficulties to quit smoking. Setting The qualitative exploratory research included ten in-depth semi-structured individual interviews and five focus groups conducted in an Ambulatory Care University Hospital in Switzerland. The thematic analysis was conducted with a gender-sensitive focus. Participants Both current and former smokers recruited from the ambulatory clinic and the community took part in the qualitative interviews. We restricted the analysis to 21 current smokers only. Results The sample included 12 men and 9 women with type 2 diabetes, having a mean age of 59.4 years, who had diabetes for an average of 9 years with a mean HbA1c of 7.4%. We found that harmful effects of tobacco were superficially understood, and participants used several patterns of thinking to minimize the risks. The relation between tobacco and diabetes was poorly known. Readiness to change was related to personal self-image and meaningful engagement in life and social relationships. Barriers could be organized into three groups: dependence, psychological habits and social barriers. Barriers were markedly shaped by gender and living with diabetes. Conclusions Results suggest that “one -fits-all” smoking cessation interventions do not satisfy the needs of type 2 diabetic smokers. Personalized smoking cessation interventions should be preferred and should pursue positive psychological outcomes addressing contextual factors."

The seeds of the obtained mutant lines were high-protein, low in oil and stabilized in contents of main fatty acids which make them useful for feed production. Despite the increased level of various meiotic abnormalities revealed in EMS populations, comparative karyotype analysis and FISH-based visualization of 45S and 5S rDNA indicated a high level of karyotypic stability in M2-M5 plants, and therefore, the obtained mutant lines could be useful in further rapeseed improvement. The revealed structural chromosomal reorganizations in karyotypes of several plants of B. rapa-type indicate that rapeseed breeding by chemical mutagenesis can result in cytogenetic instability in the mutant progeny, and therefore, it should include the karyotype examination. Our findings demonstrate that EMS at low concentrations has great potential in rapeseed improvement."

Similar inhibition by oligomycin and exogenous IF1 demonstrated tight coupling between F1 and F0 domains. The Michaelis constant for MgATP had close values for all organs, in the 150–220 μM range. Complex V catalytic turnover rate, as measured in preparations solubilized in detergent using immunotitration and activity measurements, was more than three times higher in extracts from brain or muscle than in extracts from heart or liver. This tissue specificity suggested post-translational modifications. Concomitant measurement of respiratory activities showed only slightly different complex II/complex V ratio in the four organs. In contrast, complex I/complex V ratio differed in brain as compared to the three other organs because of a high complex I activity in brain. Mitochondria purification preserved these ratios, except for brain where selective degradation of complex I occurred. Therefore, mitochondrial purification could introduce a biased enzymatic evaluation. Conclusion Altogether, this work demonstrates that a reliable assay of complex V activity is perfectly possible with very small samples from frozen biopsies, which was confirmed using control and deficient human muscles."
https://openalex.org/W2970996031,"Following unpredictable large-magnitude stance perturbations diverse patterns of arm and leg movements are performed to recover balance stability. Stability of these compensatory movements could be properly estimated through qualitative evaluation. In the present study, we present a scale for evaluation of compensatory arm and leg movements (CALM) in response to unpredictable displacements of the support base in the mediolateral direction. We tested the CALM scale for intra- and inter-rater reliability, correlation with kinematics of arm and leg movement amplitudes, and sensitivity to mode (rotation, translation and combined) and magnitude (velocity) of support base displacements, and also to perturbation-based balance training. Results showed significant intra- and inter-rater coefficients of agreement, ranging from moderate (0.46–0.53) for inter-rater reliability in the arm and global scores, to very high (0.87–0.99) for inter-rater leg scores and all intra-rater scores. Analysis showed significant correlation values between scale scores and the respective movement amplitudes both for arm and leg movements. Assessment of sensitivity revealed that the scale discriminated the responses between perturbation modes, platform velocities, in addition to higher balance recovery stability as a result of perturbation-based balance training. As a conclusion, the CALM scale was shown to provide adequate integrative evaluation of compensatory arm and leg movements for balance recovery stability after challenging stance perturbations, with potential application in fall risk prediction."

The aim of this study was to analyze the economic burden of two frequently used endoscopic treatments for anastomotic leak management after esophageal surgery: Treatment with a Self-expanding Metal Stent (SEMS) and Endoscopic Vacuum Therapy (EVT).Between January 2012 and December 2016, we identified 60 German-Diagnosis Related Group (G-DRG) cases of patients who received a SEMS and / or EVT for esophageal anastomotic leaks. Direct costs per case were analyzed according to the Institute for Remuneration System in Hospitals (InEK) cost-accounting approach by comparing DRG payments on the case level, including all extra fees per DRG catalogue.In total, 60 DRG cases were identified. Of these, 15 patients were excluded because they received a combination of SEMS and EVT. Another 6 cases could not be included due to incomplete DRG data. Finally, N = 39 DRG cases were analyzed from a profit-center perspective. A further analysis of the most frequent DRG code -G03- including InEK cost accounting, revealed almost twice the deficit for the EVT group (N = 13 cases, € - 9.282 per average case) compared to that for the SEMS group (N = 9 cases, € - 5.156 per average case).Endoscopic treatments with SEMS and EVT for anastomotic leaks following oncological Ivor Lewis esophagectomies are not cost-efficient for German hospitals. Due to longer hospitalization and insufficient reimbursements, EVT is twice as costly as SEMS treatment. An adequate DRG cost compensation is needed for SEMS and EVT."
https://openalex.org/W2971209352,"Once a fixture of research in the social and behavioral sciences, volunteer subjects are now only rarely used in human subjects research. Yet volunteers are a potentially valuable resource, especially for research conducted online. We argue that online volunteer laboratories are able to produce high-quality data comparable to that from other online pools. The scalability of volunteer labs means that they can produce large volumes of high-quality data for multiple researchers, while imposing little or no financial burden. Using a range of original tests, we show that volunteer and paid respondents have different motivations for participating in research, but have similar descriptive compositions. Furthermore, volunteer samples are able to replicate classic and contemporary social science findings, and produce high levels of overall response quality comparable to paid subjects. Our results suggest that online volunteer labs represent a potentially significant untapped source of human subjects data."
https://openalex.org/W2970050978,"Works on cancer-related genes expression using feline mammary carcinomas (FMCs) are scarce but crucial, not only to validate these tumours as models for human breast cancer studies but also to improve small animal practice. Here, the expression of the cancer-related genes TP53, CCND1, FUS, YBX1, PTBP1, c-MYC and PKM2 was evaluated by real-time RT-qPCR, in a population of FMCs clinically characterized and compared with the disease-free tissue of the same individual. In most of the FMCs analysed, RNA quantification revealed normal expression levels for TP53, c-MYC, YBX1 and FUS, but overexpression in the genes CCND1, PTBP1 and PKM2. The expression levels of these cancer-related genes are strongly correlated with each other, with exception of c-MYC and PKM2 genes. The integration of clinicopathological data with the transcriptional levels revealed several associations. The oral contraceptive administration showed to be positively related with the TP53, YBX1, CCND1, FUS and PTBP1 RNA levels. Positive associations were found between tumour size and YBX1 RNA, and lymph node metastasis with c-MYC RNA levels. This work allowed to verify that many of these cancer-related genes are associated but may also, indirectly, influence other genes, creating a complex molecular cancer network that in the future can provide new cancer biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W2970882485,"The Arctic is undergoing rapid changes, with anthropogenic shifts in climate having important and well-documented impacts on habitat. Populations of predators and their prey are affected by changing climate and other anthropogenic factors, and these changing trophic interactions could have profound effects on breeding populations of Arctic birds. Variable abundance of lemmings (a primary prey of generalist Arctic predators) and increasing abundance of light geese (Lesser Snow and Ross’ Geese; a secondary prey) could have negative consequences for numerous sympatric shorebirds (an incidental prey). Using 16 years of predator-prey observations and 13-years of shorebird nest survival data at a site near a goose colony we identify relationships among geese, lemmings, and their shared predators and then relate predator indices to shorebird risk of nest predation. During two years, we also placed time-lapse cameras and artificial shorebird nests at increasing distances from a goose colony to document spatial trends in predators and their effect on risk of predation. In the long-term data, yearly indices of light geese positively influenced indices of gulls and jaegers, and shorebird nest predation rate was negatively correlated with jaeger and fox indices. All three predator indices were highest near the goose colony and artificial nest predation probability was negatively correlated with distance from goose colony, but these effects were less apparent during the second year. Combined, these results highlight the variation in predator-mediated interactions between geese and shorebirds and outline one mechanism by which hyperabundant geese may be contributing to local or regional declines in Arctic-nesting shorebird populations."

https://openalex.org/W2970449246,"Objective Previous studies indicate a role for Oncostatin M (OSM) in atherosclerosis and other chronic inflammatory diseases for which inhibitory antibodies are in development. However, to date no intervention studies with OSM have been performed, and its relation to coronary heart disease (CHD) has not been studied. Approach and results Gene expression analysis on human normal arteries (n = 10) and late stage/advanced carotid atherosclerotic arteries (n = 127) and in situ hybridization on early human plaques (n = 9) showed that OSM, and its receptors, OSM receptor (OSMR) and Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor (LIFR) are expressed in normal arteries and atherosclerotic plaques. Chronic OSM administration in APOE*3Leiden.CETP mice (n = 15/group) increased plasma E-selectin levels and monocyte adhesion to the activated endothelium independently of cholesterol but reduced the amount of inflammatory Ly-6CHigh monocytes and atherosclerotic lesion size and severity. Using aptamer-based proteomics profiling assays high circulating OSM levels were shown to correlate with post incident CHD survival probability in the AGES‐Reykjavik study (n = 5457). Conclusions Chronic OSM administration in APOE*3Leiden.CETP mice reduced atherosclerosis development. In line, higher serum OSM levels were correlated with improved post incident CHD survival probability in patients, suggesting a protective cardiovascular effect."
https://openalex.org/W2970517425,"Somatic missense mutations of the CSNK1A1 gene encoding casein kinase 1 alpha (CK1α) occur in a subset of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with del(5q) karyotype. The chromosomal deletion causes CSNK1A1 haplo-insufficiency. CK1α mutations have also been observed in a variety of solid and hematopoietic tumors at low frequency. The functional consequence of CK1α mutation remains unknown. Here we show that tumor-associated CK1α mutations exclusively localize to the substrate-binding cleft. Functional analysis of recurrent mutants E98K and D140A revealed enhanced binding to the p53 inhibitor MDMX, increased ability to stimulate MDMX-p53 binding, and increased suppression of p21 expression. Furthermore, E98K and D140A mutants have reduced ability to promote phosphorylation of β-catenin, resulting in enhanced Wnt signaling. The results suggest that the CK1α mutations observed in tumors cause gain-of-function in cooperating with MDMX and inhibiting p53, and partial loss-of-function in suppressing Wnt signaling. These functional changes may promote expansion of abnormal myeloid progenitors in del(5q) MDS, and in rare cases drive the progression of other tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2970037074,"This study investigated the influence of age and visual occlusion on fast reach-to-grasp movements. The effect of visual occlusion on reach-to-grasp movement was examined using a task that heavily relies on feed-forward control. Three groups of healthy adults aged 22, 49 and 65 on average performed fast reach-to-grasp movements with full visual and partial visual occlusion conditions of the hand during the initial part of movement. Regarding the effect of age, the all parameters of reach-to-grasp movement were deteriorated with age, except relative time to maximum velocity and spatial coordination. Regarding the effect of visual condition, participants reached with prolonged movement time, lower peak velocity, and later occurrences of peak velocity and peak aperture, as well as decrease in spatial coordination. Regarding the effect of age on visual condition, visual occlusion resulted in a longer movement time and delayed time to maximum velocity in middle-aged and older groups compared to full vision, but the difference was not observed in the younger groups. Conclusion: Reach-to-grasp performance deteriorated with age and the performance was affected when vision of the hand at initial movement was occluded. Overall, movement performance in middle-aged and older adults was affected by visual occlusion, whereas it was unaffected in younger adults. The results indicate that visual feedback of the hand at initial movement is important to control reach-to-grasp movement of middle-aged and older adults during real tasks."
https://openalex.org/W2970284522,"Pilocarpine is an M3 muscarinic agonist that is widely used for the treatment of xerostomia caused by various diseases and medical conditions. Pilocarpine induced the secretion of salivary fluid in perfused submandibular glands of rats. The secretion of salivary fluid observed after removal of pilocarpine was referred to as residual fluid secretion. The volume of fluid and time of the residual secretion depended on the dose of pilocarpine. Such a residual effect of pilocarpine was observed on fluid secretion via the paracellular pathway and oxygen consumption. When a muscarinic antagonist was added to the perfusate immediately after cessation of pilocarpine, residual secretion of salivary fluid did not occur. These observations indicate that the residual secretion of salivary fluid is a characteristics of the interaction of pilocarpine with muscarinic receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2970653959,"Diabetes is associated with poor outcomes in critically ill populations. The goal of this study was to determine if diabetic patients suffer poorer outcomes following trauma. Collaborative trauma patient data from 2012-2018 was analyzed. Patients with no signs-of-life, Injury Severity Score (ISS) <5, age <16 years, and hospitalization <1 day were excluded. Multivariable logistic and linear regression were used to compare patients with and without diabetes for selected outcomes. Risk-adjustment variables included demographics, physiology, comorbidities, and injury scoring. Of 106,141 trauma patients, 14,150 (13%) had diabetes. On admission, diabetes was associated with significantly increased risk of any, serious, infectious, urinary tract, sepsis, pneumonia, and cardiac complications. Diabetes was also associated with increased ventilator days (7.5 vs. 6.6 days, p = 0.003), intensive care unit days (5.8 vs. 5.3 days, p<0.001), and hospital length of stay (5.7 vs. 5.3 days, p<0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed the least injured diabetic category (ISS 5-15) suffered higher odds of hospital mortality and any, serious, infectious and cardiac complications. The association between diabetes, hospital mortality and complication rates in mild traumatic injury is independent of age. Trauma patients with diabetes experience higher rates of complications and resource utilization. The largest cohort of diabetics experience the least severe injuries and suffer the greatest in hospital mortality and complication rates. A better understanding of the physiologic derangements associated with diabetes is necessary to develop novel approaches to reduce excess trauma morbidity, mortality and resource consumption."
https://openalex.org/W2970998014,"Many new medicines have been derived from natural sources such as plants, which have a long history of being used for disease treatment. Thus, their benefits and side effects have been studied, and plant-related information including plant and disease relations have been accumulated in Medline articles. Because numerous articles are available in Medline and are written in natural language, text-mining is important. However, a corpus of plant and disease relations is not available yet. Thus, we aimed to construct such a corpus.In this study, we designed and annotated a plant-disease relations corpus, and proposed a computational model to predict plant-disease relations using the corpus. We categorized plant and disease relations into four types: treatments of diseases, causes of diseases, associations, and negative relations. To construct a corpus of plant-disease relations, we first created its annotation guidelines and randomly selected 200 Medline abstracts. From these abstracts, we identified 1,405 and 1,755 plant and disease mentions, annotated to 105 and 237 unique plant and disease identifiers, respectively. When we selected sentences containing at least one plant and one disease mention, we extracted 878 plant and 1,077 disease entities, which finally generated a corpus of plant-disease relations including 1,309 relations from 199 abstracts. To verify the effectiveness of the corpus, we proposed a convolutional neural network model with the shortest dependency path (SDP-CNN) and applied it to the constructed corpus. The micro F-score with ten-fold cross-validation was found to be 0.764. We also applied the proposed SDP-CNN model to all Medline abstracts. When we measured its performance for 483 randomly selected plant-disease co-occurring sentences, the model showed a precision of 0.707.The plant-disease relations corpus is unique and represents an important resource for biomedical text-mining. The corpus of plant and disease relations is available at http://gcancer.org/pdr/."

Reactivation of latent CMV can cause life-threatening complications in immunocompromised hosts.We used the CMV Brite assay to test CMV antigenemia (pp65) in whole blood samples from 22,192 patients with or without autoimmune diseases in Beijing during 2008-2018.The overall prevalence of CMV antigenemia was 19.5% (9.7%, males; 26.0%, females). The prevalence of CMV antigenemia was 35.1%, 58.6% and 11.4% in whole patients with autoimmune diseases, in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and in patients with non-SLE autoimmune diseases, respectively. All patients with non-autoimmune diseases, patients with HIV/AIDS or transplantation were found to have 5.0%, 27% or 14.8%, respectively. Patients≤20 years with SLE had a significantly higher prevalence of CMV antigenemia than did all SLE patients, on average. Patients>51 years with non-SLE autoimmune diseases had a significantly higher prevalence than did all patients with non-SLE autoimmune diseases, on average. The prevalence of CMV antigenemia in patients admitted to intensive-care units (ICUs) were 9.2%, which was significantly higher than that among all patients with non-autoimmune diseases. Patients with SLE had 23.8% of negative conversion of CMV antigenemia, significantly lower than the percentage of patients with non-SLE autoimmune (64.3%) and non-autoimmune (61.0%) diseases. The mean number of days to negative conversion of CMV antigenemia in patients with SLE was 35.3±35.8 days, which was significantly longer than that in patients with non-SLE autoimmune diseases (15.4±11.9 days) and non-autoimmune diseases (13.6±7.7 days).CMV antigenemia is found more likely in women than in men, more prevalently in patients with SLE than those with HIV/AIDS or transplant recipients, more frequently in patients admitted to ICUs. Patients with SLE had prolonged CMV antigenemia. The role of CMV appears important in SLE."
https://openalex.org/W2971207150,"Sigma factors are key proteins that mediate the recruitment of RNA polymerase to the promoter regions of genes, for the initiation of bacterial transcription. Multiple sigma factors in a bacterium selectively recognize their cognate promoter sequences, thereby inducing the expression of their own regulons. In this paper, we report the crystal structure of the σ4 domain of Bacillus subtilis SigW bound to the -35 promoter element. Purine-specific hydrogen bonds of the -35 promoter element with the recognition helix α9 of the σ4 domain occurs at three nucleotides of the consensus sequence (G-35, A-34, and G’-31 in G-35A-34A-33A-32C-31C-30T-29). The hydrogen bonds of the backbone with the α7 and α8 of the σ4 domain occurs at G’-30. These results elucidate the structural basis of the selective recognition of the promoter by SigW. In addition, comparison of SigW structures complexed with the -35 promoter element or with anti-sigma RsiW reveals that DNA recognition and anti-sigma factor binding of SigW are mutually exclusive."
https://openalex.org/W2970367317,"South Africa (SA) is reforming its health system in preparation for an anticipated national health insurance (NHI) scheme that aims to improve the delivery of affordable, equitable, accessible health care. Public health (PH) language is explicit in the policy and skilled PH professionals would be expected to play a key role in its implementation. In South Africa, training of doctors as Public Health Medicine (PHM) specialists is funded by the state, yet there are few positions for PHM specialists in the health services. We explored stakeholders' perspectives about this absence, and their views on PHM specialist' roles and contribution in an era of health reform. A qualitative study was conducted in 2012-13, using in-depth interviews with thematic analysis, which elicited perspectives of 31 key stakeholders nationally reflecting diverse employer and institutional backgrounds. While some were surprised by the absence of PH professionals in SA's health system, most agreed the reason was due to factors internal to the profession, such as its low profile and uncertain identity. External factors such as legislation and political preferences for health managers impacted on the employment of PH professionals. However, given the competencies required to implement an ambitious restructuring of the health sector, all believed that PH and PHM personnel were vital. In view of the health system's dominant curative orientation, embedding PH personnel in the services should ensure that health protection, promotion and prevention strategies will inform health priorities. This study, the first known from a low and middle-income country, contributes to the international literature about the identity and roles of PHM physicians, who are versatile professionals with broad skills-sets. In SA, through consultation with health sector employers about potential roles, curricular redesign and trainee recruitment, PHM can graduate fit-for-purpose specialists to work in a range of institutions to address health system reform."
https://openalex.org/W2970437797,"Empirical studies show that discrimination by identity found in offline markets also prevails online. This paper reveal that in a competitive market, buyers that intend to discriminate exist but they are prevented from influencing the market outcome. To this end, we construct a field experiment on eBay, where half of the sellers disclose their names in their usernames while the other half do not. eBay, however, automatically discloses the seller’s names to the buyer after the auction. In the anonymous auctions, winning bidders thus learn the identity of the seller after the auction ends, and here we find buyers to discriminate against sellers with foreign-sounding names by leaving them feedback less often. However, there is no such discrimination in feedback provision when the seller name was known to the buyer before the auction. When bidders know the names of the sellers, the bidders with animus towards individuals with specific names can select out of auctions from these sellers, leaving winners that do not discriminate. One would expect that the auctions of for example sellers with foreign-sounding names would receive fewer bidders and thus lower auction prices. However, we observe no such differences: there are no statistically significant differences in the number of bids or auction prices received by sellers with foreign or domestic sounding names."
https://openalex.org/W2970626445,"The impact of meditation training on self-report psychological variables is well-established. Although meditation training is purported to have interpersonal impacts, whether naïve observers perceive differences associated with long- and short-term meditation training is largely unknown. The current study provided a stringent test of this possibility through observer ratings of a very thin slice of expressive behavior: still photographs. Photographs were drawn from a larger study investigating differences between long-term meditators (LTM) and meditation naïve participants (MNP) who were exposed to one of three experimental conditions. Photographs of ninety-nine targets (16 LTMs, 83 MNPs) were taken at baseline, prior to the randomization of MNPs to an eight-week mindfulness meditation course (mindfulness-based stress reduction; n = 27), an active control comparison condition (health enhancement program; n = 29), or a waitlist control group (n = 27) and again after the training period. Pre- and post-intervention photographs were then rated by 25 meditation teachers and 86 undergraduate raters on five domains theoretically linked to meditation training. Results indicated that relative to MNPs, LTMs were rated as less neurotic and more conscientious, mindful, and ""comfortable in their own skin"" at baseline (ds = 0.61 to 0.70, ps < .050), although not more agreeable or attractive. Results were largely unchanged when controlling for five observable confounds (age, gender, race/ethnicity, body mass index, attractiveness). No evidence was found supporting experimental effects of short-term meditation training on observer ratings. Thus, it seems that if meditation is associated with observable differences in facial behavior, effects may be limited to long-term training."
