https://openalex.org/W3087057425,"CD19-directed immunotherapies are clinically effective for treating B cell malignancies but also cause a high incidence of neurotoxicity. A subset of patients treated with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells or bispecific T cell engager (BiTE) antibodies display severe neurotoxicity, including fatal cerebral edema associated with T cell infiltration into the brain. Here, we report that mural cells, which surround the endothelium and are critical for blood-brain-barrier integrity, express CD19. We identify CD19 expression in brain mural cells using single-cell RNA sequencing data and confirm perivascular staining at the protein level. CD19 expression in the brain begins early in development alongside the emergence of mural cell lineages and persists throughout adulthood across brain regions. Mouse mural cells demonstrate lower levels of Cd19 expression, suggesting limitations in preclinical animal models of neurotoxicity. These data suggest an on-target mechanism for neurotoxicity in CD19-directed therapies and highlight the utility of human single-cell atlases for designing immunotherapies."

Our aim was to develop and evaluate a machine learning algorithm to diagnose COVID-19 in the inpatient setting. The algorithm was based on basic demographic and laboratory features to serve as a screening tool at hospitals where testing is scarce or unavailable. We used retrospectively collected data from the UCLA Health System in Los Angeles, California. We included all emergency room or inpatient cases receiving SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing who also had a set of ancillary laboratory features (n = 1,455) between 1 March 2020 and 24 May 2020. We tested seven machine learning models and used a combination of those models for the final diagnostic classification. In the test set (n = 392), our combined model had an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.87–0.96). The model achieved a sensitivity of 0.93 (95% CI 0.85–0.98), specificity of 0.64 (95% CI 0.58–0.69). We found that our machine learning algorithm had excellent diagnostic metrics compared to SARS-CoV-2 PCR. This ensemble machine learning algorithm to diagnose COVID-19 has the potential to be used as a screening tool in hospital settings where PCR testing is scarce or unavailable."

Here, we develop imaging tools to interrogate these functions in adult lateral ventricle ChP in whole-mount explants and in awake mice. By imaging epithelial cells in intact ChP explants, we observed calcium activity and secretory events that increased in frequency following delivery of serotonergic agonists. Using chronic two-photon imaging in awake mice, we observed spontaneous subcellular calcium events as well as strong agonist-evoked calcium activation and cytoplasmic secretion into CSF. Three-dimensional imaging of motility and mobility of multiple types of ChP immune cells at baseline and following immune challenge or focal injury revealed a range of surveillance and defensive behaviors. Together, these tools should help illuminate the diverse functions of this understudied body-brain interface.

Together, these tools should help illuminate the diverse functions of this understudied body-brain interface. The choroid plexus (ChP) is a distinct, vital organ that extends into each ventricle in the brain. It is composed predominantly of epithelial cells that envelop a network of stromal cell types, including immune, mesenchymal, and vascular cells (Dani et al., 2019Dani N. Herbst R.H. Habib N. Head J.

The epithelial cells provide a source of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (Damkier et al., 2013Damkier H.H. Brown P.D. Praetorius J. Cerebrospinal fluid secretion by the choroid plexus.Physiol.

Thus, the sensing, secretory, and transcytotic functions of the ChP suggest diverse roles in regulating brain function. These roles may be disrupted in neurologic conditions ranging from hydrocephalus (Karimy et al., 2017Karimy J.K. Zhang J. Kurland D.B. Theriault B.C. Duran D. Stokum J.A. Furey C.G. Zhou X.

Despite the importance of the ChP-CSF system, little is known about the behavior of mammalian ChP cell types in vivo. In vitro approaches exist for culturing ChP cell lines (Zheng and Zhao, 2002Zheng W. Zhao Q.

Neurosci. 2015; 35: 4903-4916Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Anatomical studies using light microscopy and electron microscopy (EM) have provided clues as to the cellular architecture of the ChP (e.g., Netsky and Shuangshoti, 1975Netsky M. Shuangshoti S. The Choroid Plexus in Health and Disease. Elsevier, New York1975Google Scholar). However, a major obstacle to progress in understanding the roles of ChP cells has been the lack of available tools for stable visualization and manipulation of specific ChP cell types in intact tissue in vitro and in vivo in a fluid environment deep within the brain. Here, we adapted a suite of modern neuroscience tools to target the lateral ventricle (LV) ChP, providing optical access to this unexplored tissue in mice. We developed methods for volumetric two-photon imaging and non-rigid alignment of the ChP in acute explant preparations, as well as in awake mice across hours, days, and weeks. Dynamic cellular functions of other epithelia (e.g., in retina, lung, and salivary gland) are typically associated with changes in intracellular calcium (Ambudkar, 2016Ambudkar I.S.

For example, calcium signaling in salivary gland is important for on-demand secretion (Ambudkar, 2018Ambudkar I. Calcium signaling defects underlying salivary gland dysfunction.Biochim. Biophys. Acta Mol. Cell Res. 2018; 1865: 1771-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, Ambudkar, 2016Ambudkar I.S. Calcium signalling in salivary gland physiology and dysfunction.J. Physiol. 2016; 594: 2813-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We found that ChP epithelial cells exhibited spontaneous subcellular calcium activity in vitro and in vivo. Serotonergic agonists evoked distributed increases in calcium activity, as well as secretory events measured using a sensor of exocytosis. We then visualized the motility and mobility of ChP immune cells in relation to ChP vasculature in awake mice at baseline and in response to peripheral immune stimulation and to laser-induced, focal ChP injury. Together, these methods provide a novel imaging platform for a wide range of studies imaging multiple genetically accessible ChP cell types in intact tissue at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. We first optimized adult LV ChP explant preparations (Dani et al., 2019Dani N. Herbst R.H. Habib N. Head J. Dionne D. Nguyen L. McCabe C. Cui J. Shipley F.B.

Epithelial cells constitute the majority of adult ChP cells (Dani et al., 2019Dani N. Herbst R.H. Habib N. Head J. Dionne D. Nguyen L. McCabe C. Cui J. Shipley F.B. Jang A. et al.A cellular and spatial map of the choroid plexus across brain ventricles and ages.bioRxiv. 2019; https://doi.org/10.1101/627539Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In addition, the ChP contains immune cells (labeled by Cx3cr1+/GFP; Jung et al., 2000Jung S. Aliberti J. Graemmel P. Sunshine M.J. Kreutzberg G.W. Sher A. Littman D.R. Analysis of fractalkine receptor CX(3)CR1 function by targeted deletion and green fluorescent protein reporter gene insertion.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4106-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar) consisting mostly of monocytes/macrophages but also including a smaller number of mast cells and dendritic cells (Dani et al., 2019Dani N. Herbst R.H. Habib N. Head J. Dionne D. Nguyen L. McCabe C. Cui J. Shipley F.B.

Neurosci. 2019; 22: 1021-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). These immune cells evenly tiled the entire tissue under baseline conditions (Figures 1A–1C). The ChP could be divided into stereotyped zones defined by arterial and venous landmarks (Figures 1D, S1B, and S1C) (Dani et al., 2019Dani N. Herbst R.H. Habib N. Head J. Dionne D. Nguyen L. McCabe C. Cui J. Shipley F.B. Jang A. et al.A cellular and spatial map of the choroid plexus across brain ventricles and ages.bioRxiv. 2019; https://doi.org/10.1101/627539Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). This vascular pattern strongly resembles that observed for human ChP (Hudson, 1960Hudson A.J. The development of the vascular pattern of the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricles.J. Comp. Neurol. 1960; 115: 171-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). As such, it provides an anatomical roadmap that allows specific subregions of the LV ChP to be identified and analyzed across mice within the same study, across studies from different labs, and across species. ChP explants were stabilized for acute in vitro imaging (Figure 1E). To visualize calcium activity in epithelial cells, we gently dissected and stabilized the entire LV ChP from one hemisphere. We expressed the calcium reporter GCaMP6f (using Ai95D mice; Madisen et al., 2015Madisen L. Garner A.R. Shimaoka D. Chuong A.S. Klapoetke N.C. Li L. van der Bourg A. Niino Y. Egolf L.

Using epifluorescence imaging, we could visualize spontaneous calcium activity across thousands of epithelial cells simultaneously (Figure 1F; Video S1). We focused on a subregion and performed activity-based cell segregation (STAR Methods), resulting in time courses of spontaneous activity in individual epithelial cells (Figures 1F–1K; Video S1). Most epithelial cells showed large, transient elevations in calcium activity lasting several seconds (Figures 1K and 1L). Such events were not synchronized across cells (Figure 1M). These findings suggest baseline regulation of calcium levels and calcium-dependent signal transduction in ChP epithelial cells. eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI3YTQzYTBlNDdjZGRhMGM1Njc4MDZjMTdiNzA5MGYyNiIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjQ3NTAzMDkxfQ.bo-TbiPlxUsTGHZ3JHDrwRSdydcDnhj1SqjoKquVCBGvAEm1jz4edKa3j6sZS6owifaODBQksylNYXBbiLgl8-MJ9N11QT8MIeiZMHDDYrLcFgDMqU-lB3QOFhuHxEKFjpC9U_zIBLjeAtsZgo1-O0XZz5QPQiTsFhDrdDghT0alatw16YT-FrQdbVaIOoMHNZbTNyGE6Ap2GhAA9ZN44clXxsodMITdFiTx1EuvHxrwGjueKtdefnwpd0LX8aWfVeEQX5tVwm2LD_3-QJvVLY_h2HQZkm2mHRdN9ZOnS-e-PWVwpliNW68PTNjMvmmmNb-0nOjOXOuSUb6nA2fr_Q Download .mp4 (7.69 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S1. Imaging Calcium Activity in Adult Lateral Ventricle ChP Explant, Related to Figure 1Widefield epifluorescence imaging of spontaneous calcium activity of epithelial cells in ChP explants (large leaf of LV ChP) in FoxJ1-Cre::Ai95D mice. This method allowed for simultaneous visualization of activity in many thousands of active epithelial cells (see also Figure 1F). Inset: zoom-in of cellular activity in the region outlined by a solid white square (same subregion as in Figures 1G–1M, spanning 161 × 161 μm2). Note uncorrelated activity throughout the explant. Timestamps are in units of minutes:seconds. Elevated calcium regulates many cellular processes, including gene transcription and secretion in other body epithelia, such as the salivary gland (Ambudkar, 2016Ambudkar I.S. Calcium signalling in salivary gland physiology and dysfunction.J. Physiol. 2016; 594: 2813-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). One factor previously shown to elevate calcium levels in ChP cell lines in culture is serotonin (5-HT [5-hydroxytryptamine]) (Esterle and Sanders-Bush, 1992Esterle T.M. Sanders-Bush E.

We found that subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of WAY-161503, a selective agonist of 5-HT2C (Rosenzweig-Lipson et al., 2006Rosenzweig-Lipson S. Zhang J. Mazandarani H. Harrison B.L. Sabb A. Sabalski J.

Antibodies available for this receptor have typically shown low signal quality. Thus, we used genome editing to generate a Htr2cmRuby3 mouse line in which the fluorescent protein mRuby3 was inserted at the C-terminus of 5-HT2C (Figures S2C and S2D). 5-HT2C-mRuby3 was functional in these mice, as subcutaneous injection of WAY-161503 in Htr2cmRuby3 mice induced c-fos expression similar to that observed in wild-type mice (Figure 2D; mean ± SEM fold increase in c-fos mRNA expression in Htr2cmRuby3 mice receiving WAY-161503 [3 mg/kg] versus vehicle 80.6 ± 17.3, n = 4 heterozygous male mice; Htr2c expressed from X chromosome). Fluorescence of the mRuby3 tag revealed receptor localization throughout ChP epithelial cells, including at the apical and basal membranes (Figure 2E). This localization is consistent with the prediction that ChP epithelial cells can sense both central and peripheral sources of 5-HT (Figure S1C). Accordingly, using higher magnification two-photon calcium imaging, we obtained similar patterns of activation of an increasing number of cells with increasing concentrations of the 5-HT2C agonist WAY-161503 (Figures 2F and S2E; Video S3). eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiIxOWI0ODE0OTViMDhhNzYxYjZhMWE1NzBlZDkzNzk4YyIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjQ3NTAzMDkxfQ.mfy2zC1a01sHjn6cPwc2x8NR3INf5VRnIOVpIp1ZCAx-kZUzICEuikLSmYAQKfjwFW9G5tvWOPe8W8EdzRGlQ1ruGRxuDFVOTGEHbwsi3TpiRWnPkG8NmCQ5292hl19zoJ8n843ADVZsYvXENoHF5X6ulIlOEQDWp7Xa4ToBgHceGSw7N_trD8JDyrVg9-x399ZAVdibwV-N-Fn-718uJpCoyPD8c3JOR1I-ShfXZM5wcgMVj0rglaJP_xJX-jO4zMPP3ub-WNZszppuokBK1_KbnQx14eo5RqYbSVKVsMM5OwkT2eil7f2UM8vf0ED0lcVmiL58Vlt4k78nK7P2sQ Download .mp4 (5.18 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S3.

https://openalex.org/W3088564464,"The swift rise of omics-approaches allows for investigating microbial diversity and plant-microbe interactions across diverse ecological communities and spatio-temporal scales. The environment, however, is rapidly changing. The introduction of invasive species and the effects of climate change have particular impact on emerging plant diseases and managing current epidemics. It is critical, therefore, to take a holistic approach to understand how and why pathogenesis occurs in order to effectively manage for diseases given the synergies of changing environmental conditions. A multi-omics approach allows for a detailed picture of plant-microbial interactions and can ultimately allow us to build predictive models for how microbes and plants will respond to stress under environmental change. This article is designed as a primer for those interested in integrating -omic approaches into their plant disease research. We review -omics technologies salient to pathology including metabolomics, genomics, metagenomics, volatilomics, and spectranomics, and present cases where multi-omics have been successfully used for plant disease ecology. We then discuss additional limitations and pitfalls to be wary of prior to conducting an integrated research project as well as provide information about promising future directions."
https://openalex.org/W3040771723,"Cell-fate conversion generally requires reprogramming effectors to both introduce fate programs of the target cell type and erase the identity of starting cell population. Here, we reveal insights into the activity of microRNAs miR-9/9∗ and miR-124 (miR-9/9∗-124) as reprogramming agents that orchestrate direct conversion of human fibroblasts into motor neurons by first eradicating fibroblast identity and promoting uniform transition to a neuronal state in sequence. We identify KLF-family transcription factors as direct target genes for miR-9/9∗-124 and show their repression is critical for erasing fibroblast fate. Subsequent gain of neuronal identity requires upregulation of a small nuclear RNA, RN7SK, which induces accessibilities of chromatin regions and neuronal gene activation to push cells to a neuronal state. Our study defines deterministic components in the microRNA-mediated reprogramming cascade."
https://openalex.org/W3088100485,"The hypothalamus regulates innate social interactions, but how hypothalamic neurons transduce sex-related sensory signals emitted by conspecifics to trigger appropriate behaviors remains unclear. Here, we addressed this issue by identifying specific hypothalamic neurons required for sensing conspecific male cues relevant to inter-male aggression. By in vivo recording of neuronal activities in behaving mice, we showed that neurons expressing dopamine transporter (DAT+) in the ventral premammillary nucleus (PMv) of the hypothalamus responded to male urine cues in a vomeronasal organ (VNO)-dependent manner in naive males. Retrograde trans-synaptic tracing further revealed a specific group of neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) that convey male-relevant signals from VNO to PMv. Inhibition of PMvDAT+ neurons abolished the preference for male urine cues and reduced inter-male attacks, while activation of these neurons promoted urine marking and aggression. Thus, PMvDAT+ neurons exemplify a hypothalamic node that transforms sex-related chemo-signals into recognition and behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W3087697342,"Since the end of February 2020 a severe diffusion of COVID-19 has affected Italy and in particular its northern regions, resulting in a high demand of hospitalizations in particular in the intensive care units (ICUs). Hospitals are suffering the high degree of patients to be treated for respiratory diseases and the majority of the health structures, especially in the north of Italy, are or are at risk of saturation. Therefore, the question whether and to what extent the reduction of hospital beds occurred in the past years has biased the management of the emergency has come to the front in the public debate. In our opinion, to start a robust analysis it is necessary to consider the Italian health system capacity prior to the emergency. Therefore, the aim of this study is to analyse the availability of hospital beds across the country as well as to determine their management in terms of complexity and performance of cases treated at regional level. The results of this study underlines that, despite the reduction of beds for the majority of the hospital wards, ICUs availabilities did not change between 2010 and 2017. Moreover, this study confirms that the majority of the Italian regions have a routinely efficient management of their facilities allowing hospitals to treat patients without the risk of having an overabundance of patients and a scarcity of beds. In fact, this analysis shows that, in normal situations, the management of hospital and ICU beds has no critical levels."
https://openalex.org/W3088881864,"Anthracyclines are the critical component in a majority of pediatric chemotherapy regimens due to their broad anticancer efficacy. Unfortunately, the vast majority of long-term childhood cancer survivors will develop a chronic health condition caused by their successful treatments and severe cardiac disease is a common life-threatening outcome that is unequivocally linked to previous anthracycline exposure. The intricacies of how anthracyclines such as doxorubicin, damage the heart and initiate a disease process that progresses over multiple decades is not fully understood. One area left largely unstudied is the role of the cardiac fibroblast, a key cell type in cardiac maturation and injury response. In this study, we demonstrate the effect of doxorubicin on cardiac fibroblast function in the presence and absence of the critical DNA damage response protein p53. In wildtype cardiac fibroblasts, doxorubicin-induced damage correlated with decreased proliferation and migration, cell cycle arrest, and a dilated cardiomyopathy gene expression profile. Interestingly, these doxorubicin-induced changes were completely or partially restored in p53-/- cardiac fibroblasts. Moreover, in wildtype cardiac fibroblasts, doxorubicin produced DNA damage and mitochondrial dysfunction, both of which are well-characterized cell stress responses induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and varied forms of heart injury. A 3-fold increase in p53 (p = 0.004) prevented the completion of mitophagy (p = 0.032) through sequestration of Parkin. Interactions between p53 and Parkin increased in doxorubicin-treated cardiac fibroblasts (p = 0.0003). Finally, Parkin was unable to localize to the mitochondria in wildtype cardiac fibroblasts, but mitochondrial localization was restored in p53-/- cardiac fibroblasts. These findings strongly suggest that cardiac fibroblasts are an important myocardial cell type that merits further study in the context of doxorubicin treatment. A more robust knowledge of the role cardiac fibroblasts play in the development of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity will lead to novel clinical strategies that will improve the quality of life of cancer survivors."
https://openalex.org/W3089215481,"Background Improving health outcomes for Indigenous people by strengthening the cultural safety of care is a vital challenge for the health sector, both in Australia and internationally. Although Indigenous people have long requested to have Indigenous practitioners involved in their health care, many health services report difficulties with recruiting and retaining Indigenous staff. This article describes Indigenous workforce policies and strategies from two Australian health services, as well as cancer-service specific strategies. Methods Services were identified as part of a national study designed to identify and assess innovative services for Indigenous cancer patients and their families. In-depth interviews were conducted in a small number of identified services. The interviews from two services, which stood out as particularly high performing, were analysed through the lens of Indigenous health workforce. Results Twenty-four hospital staff (Indigenous and non-Indigenous), five Indigenous people with cancer and three family members shared their views and experiences. Eight themes were identified from the way that the two services supported their Indigenous workforce: strong executive leadership, a proactive employment strategy, the Indigenous Health Unit, the Indigenous Liaison Officer, multidisciplinary team inclusion, professional development, work environment and a culture of respect. Participants reported two positive outcomes resulting from the active implementation of the eight workforce themes: ‘Improved Indigenous patient outcomes’ and ‘Improved staff outcomes’. Conclusions These two cancer services and their affiliated hospitals show how positive patient outcomes and a strong Indigenous health workforce can be achieved when a health service has strong leadership, commits to an inclusive and enabling culture, facilitates two-way learning and develops specific support structures appropriate for Indigenous staff. It is hoped that the strategies captured in this study will be used by health services and cancer services to inform their own policies and programs to support building their Indigenous workforce."
https://openalex.org/W3087662840,"Social distancing, a non-pharmaceutical tactic aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19, can arise because individuals voluntarily distance from others to avoid contracting the disease. Alternatively, it can arise because of jurisdictional restrictions imposed by local authorities. We run reduced form models of social distancing as a function of county-level exogenous demographic variables and jurisdictional fixed effects for 49 states to assess the relative contributions of demographic and jurisdictional effects in explaining social distancing behavior. To allow for possible spatial aspects of a contagious disease, we also model the spillovers associated with demographic variables in surrounding counties as well as allow for disturbances that depend upon those in surrounding counties. We run our models weekly and examine the evolution of the estimated coefficients over time since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. These estimated coefficients express the revealed preferences of individuals who were able to and chose to stay at home to avoid the disease. Stay-at-home behavior measured using cell phone tracking data exhibits considerable cross-sectional variation, increasing over nine-fold from the end of January 2020 to the end of March 2020, and then decreasing by about 50% through mid-June 2020. Our estimation results show that demographic exogenous variables explain substantially more of this variation than predictions from jurisdictional fixed effects. Moreover, the explanations from demographic exogenous variables and jurisdictional fixed effects show an evolving correlation over the sample period, initially partially offsetting, and eventually reinforcing each other. Furthermore, the predicted social distance from demographic exogenous variables shows substantial spatial autoregressive dependence, indicating clustering in social distancing behavior. The increased variance of stay-at-home behavior coupled with the high level of spatial dependence can result in relatively intense hotspots and coldspots of social distance, which has implications for disease spread and mitigation."

The role of access to WASH facilities on child growth outcomes in Ethiopia is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to determine individual and combined effects of access to WASH facilities on child growth outcomes.Data for this analysis was sourced from the recent Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) 2016. A multivariable logistic regression model was applied to identify the separate and combined association of access to WASH facilities with child growth outcomes. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated. Statistical significance was declared at p < 0.05.Included in the analyses were data for children 0-59 months of age, which amounted to valid data for 9588 children with a height-for-age z-score (HAZ), 9752 children with a weight-for-age z-score (WAZ) and 9607 children with a weight-for-height z-score (WHZ). Children with access to improved combined sanitation with handwashing facilities had 29% lower odds of linear growth failure (stunting) (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.51-0.99) compared with those with unimproved. Children with access to combined improved WASH facilities were 33% less likely to have linear growth failure (AOR = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.45-0.98). Access to improved handwashing alone reduced the odds of being underweight by 17% (AOR = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.71-0.98) compared with unimproved. Improved water and sanitation separately as well as combined WASH were not associated with decreased odds of underweight and wasting.Combined access to improved water, sanitation and handwashing was associated with reduced child linear growth failure. Further research with robust methods is needed to examine whether combined WASH practices have synergistic effect on child growth outcomes."

Host plant resistance is an environmentally-friendly and cost-effective mean to mitigate RRKN damage to rice. Considering the limited availability of genetic resources in the Asian rice (Oryza sativa) cultivars, exploration of novel sources and genetic basis of RRKN resistance is necessary. We screened 272 diverse wild rice accessions (O. nivara, O. rufipogon, O. sativa f. spontanea) to identify genotypes resistant to RRKN. We dissected the genetic basis of RRKN resistance using a genome-wide association study with SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphism) genotyped by 50K ""OsSNPnks"" genic Affymetrix chip. Population structure analysis revealed that these accessions were stratified into three major sub-populations. Overall, 40 resistant accessions (nematode gall number and multiplication factor/MF < 2) were identified, with 17 novel SNPs being significantly associated with phenotypic traits such as number of galls, egg masses, eggs/egg mass and MF per plant. SNPs were localized to the quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosome 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10 and 11 harboring the candidate genes including NBS-LRR, Cf2/Cf5 resistance protein, MYB, bZIP, ARF, SCARECROW and WRKY transcription factors. Expression of these identified genes was significantly (P < 0.01) upregulated in RRKN-infected plants compared to mock-inoculated plants at 7 days after inoculation. The identified SNPs enrich the repository of candidate genes for future marker-assisted breeding program to alleviate the damage of RRKN in rice."
https://openalex.org/W3088064641,"Ever decreasing efficiency of antibiotic treatment due to growing antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacteria is a critical issue in clinical practice. The two generally accepted major approaches to this problem are the search for new antibiotics and the development of antibiotic adjuvants to enhance the antimicrobial activity of known compounds. It was therefore the aim of the present study to test whether alkylresorcinols, a class of phenolic lipids, can be used as adjuvants to potentiate the effect of various classes of antibiotics. Alkylresorcinols were combined with 12 clinically used antibiotics. Growth-inhibiting activity against a broad range of pro- and eukaryotic microorganisms was determined. Test organisms did comprise 10 bacterial and 2 fungal collection strains, including E. coli and S. aureus, and clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae. The highest adjuvant activity was observed in the case of 4-hexylresorcinol (4-HR), a natural compound found in plants with antimicrobial activity. 50% of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4-HR caused an up to 50-fold decrease in the MIC of antibiotics of various classes. Application of 4-HR as an adjuvant revealed its efficiency against germination of bacterial dormant forms (spores) and prevented formation of antibiotic-tolerant persister cells. Using an in vivo mouse model of K. pneumoniae-induced sepsis, we could demonstrate that the combination of 4-HR and polymyxin was highly effective. 75% of animals were free of infection after treatment as compared to none of the animals receiving the antibiotic alone. We conclude that alkylresorcinols such as 4-HR can be used as an adjuvant to increase the efficiency of several known antibiotics. We suggest that by this approach the risk for development of genetically determined antibiotic resistance can be minimized due to the multimodal mode of action of 4-HR."
https://openalex.org/W3089297445,"Dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells play important roles in immune regulation, and modulating their function is an approach for developing preventive or therapeutic strategies against immune disorders. Herein, the effect of pterostilbene (PSB) (3′,5′-dimethoxy-resveratrol)—a resveratrol-related polyphenol found in blueberries—on immune regulation was evaluated. Using an in vitro co-culture system, PSB was found to exert the strongest inhibitory effect among all tested resveratrol derivatives on DC-mediated T cell proliferation; moreover, PSB treatment decreased the Th1 and Th17 populations and increased the regulatory T cell (Treg) population. Upon co-stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies, PSB inhibited CD4+ T cell proliferation and differentiation into Th1 cells. Additionally, PSB acted on DCs to suppress the lipopolysaccharide-induced transactivation of genes encoding antigen presentation-related molecules and inflammatory cytokines by attenuating the DNA-binding ability of the transcription factor PU.1. Furthermore, PSB promoted DC-mediated Foxp3+ Treg differentiation, and PU.1 knockdown increased DC-induced Treg activity. Oral administration of PSB alleviated the symptoms of dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis and decreased tumor necrosis factor-α expression in mice. Thus, PSB treatment ameliorates colonic inflammation."

After 12 weeks of pro-atherogenic high-fat diet feeding and TL1A treatment, mouse aorta, serum, and liver samples were collected and used to assess atherosclerotic lesions, fatty liver, and expression of related molecules. We found that TL1A treatment significantly reduced lesions and enhanced plaque stability.

TL1A reduced the transformation of VSMCs from contractile phenotype into synthetic phenotypes by activating expression of contractile marker α smooth muscle actin and inhibiting expression of synthetic marker osteopontin, or osteoblast-like phenotype by reducing calcification. In addition, TL1A ameliorated high-fat diet–induced lipid metabolic disorders in the liver.

Atherosclerosis is one of the common causes of cardiovascular diseases, which can seriously impair human health. It is also a complex pathophysiological process, characterized by disorders of cholesterol/lipid metabolism, inflammation, and ultimately the development of fibrous plaques in the aorta (1Wolf D. Ley K. Immunity and inflammation in atherosclerosis.Circ. Res. 2019; 124 (30653442): 315-32710.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.313591Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 2Weber C. Noels H.

Previous studies have demonstrated that monocyte/macrophage accumulation and infiltration, endothelial cell dysfunctions, and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotypic differentiation play important roles in the development of atherosclerosis (3Gimbrone Jr., M.A. García-Cardeña G. Endothelial cell dysfunction and the pathobiology of atherosclerosis.Circ. Res. 2016; 118 (26892962): 620-63610.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar, 4Bennett M.R.

Physiologically, VSMCs are contractile differentiated cells with a low ability of proliferation and apoptosis within the middle layer of vessel wall (5Li P. Zhu N. Yi B. Wang N. Chen M. You X. Zhao X. Solomides C.C. Qin Y. Sun J. MicroRNA-663 regulates human vascular smooth muscle cell phenotypic switch and vascular neointimal formation.Circ.

The primary functions of VSMCs are to regulate the vessel tone as well as blood pressure and flow distribution (6Yurdagul Jr., A. Finney A.C. Woolard M.D. Orr A.W. The arterial microenvironment: the where and why of atherosclerosis.Biochem. J. 2016; 473 (27208212): 1281-129510.1042/BJ20150844Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, during the development of atherogenesis, VSMCs can switch from a contractile phenotype to a synthetic phenotype, associated with increased expression of synthetic markers, such as osteopontin (OPN), and reduced expression of contractile markers, such as α smooth muscle actin (αSMA) and smooth muscle protein 22α (SM22α) (7Gomez D.

VSMCs can also differentiate into osteoblast-like cells that drives the process of calcification. Vascular calcification increases plaque vulnerability and exacerbates atherosclerosis progression (8Durham A.L. Speer M.Y. Scatena M. Giachelli C.M. Shanahan C.M. Role of smooth muscle cells in vascular calcification: implications in atherosclerosis and arterial stiffness.Cardiovasc. Res. 2018; 114 (29514202): 590-60010.1093/cvr/cvy010Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In addition, excess lipids accumulating in VSMCs can promote foam cell formation and contribute to the total intimal foam cell population in lesions (9Chaabane C. Coen M. Bochaton-Piallat M.L.

The role of vascular smooth muscle cells on the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.Acta Med. Indones. 2007; 39 (17933075): 86-93PubMed Google Scholar). TNF ligand–related molecule 1A (TL1A), also known as vascular endothelial growth inhibitor or tumor necrosis factor superfamily 15, is a type II transmembrane protein. It can be produced predominantly by endothelial cells in response to inflammatory cytokines (13Bayry J. Immunology: TL1A in the inflammatory network in autoimmune diseases.Nat. Rev.

In addition to regulation of neovascularization, high levels of TL1A were detected in human carotid atherosclerotic plaques, especially in macrophage/foam cells (15Kang Y.J. Kim W.J. Bae H.U. Kim D.I. Park Y.B. Park J.E. Kwon B.S. Lee W.H. Involvement of TL1A and DR3 in induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinase-9 in atherogenesis.Cytokine. 2005; 29 (15760679): 229-23510.1016/j.cyto.2004.12.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TL1A and its receptor, the death domain–containing receptor 3, participate in formation of human macrophage/foam cells by increasing uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and reducing cholesterol efflux in vitro (16McLaren J.E. Calder C.J. McSharry B.P. Sexton K. Salter R.C. Singh N.N. Wilkinson G.W. Wang E.C. Ramji D.P. The TNF-like protein 1A-death receptor 3 pathway promotes macrophage foam cell formation in vitro.J. Immunol. 2010; 184 (20410491): 5827-583410.4049/jimmunol.0903782Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore, TL1A may be a mediator of atherosclerosis. However, whether TL1A can affect atherosclerosis in vivo remains unknown. Although apoE-deficient (apoE−/−) mice can spontaneously develop atherosclerotic lesions when they are fed chow diet, the pro-atherogenic high-fat diet (HFD)-fed apoE−/− mice have been used more frequently as the model for atherosclerosis investigation. Compared with chow diet, HFD feeding can substantially reduce the time for development of lesions. In addition, the HFD feeding can generate severe human-like hypercholesterolemia in the animals (17Ma C. Zhang W. Yang X. Liu Y. Liu L. Feng K. Zhang X. Yang S. Sun L. Yu M. Yang J. Li X. Hu W. Miao R.Q. Zhu Y. et al.Functional interplay between liver X receptor and AMP-activated protein kinase α inhibits atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice-A new anti-atherogenic strategy.Br.

ApoE-deficient mice develop lesions of all phases of atherosclerosis throughout the arterial tree.Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14 (8274468): 133-14010.1161/01.atv.14.1.133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in this study, we used HFD-fed apoE−/− mice to determine the effect of TL1A on the development of atherosclerosis and the involved mechanisms. To determine whether TL1A can influence the development of atherosclerosis, we fed apoE−/− mice the pro-atherogenic HFD for 12 weeks, a duration that can induce lesions substantially. Meanwhile, mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with PBS (control group) or recombinant human TL1A protein (TL1A group), twice a week. At the end of treatment, we collected aortic samples and determined both en face arterial and aortic root sinus lesions by Oil Red O staining. Compared with lesions in control mice (∼8.9 × 106 µm2), TL1A treatment reduced en face aortic lesions to ∼4.7 × 106 µm2 (Fig. 1A, left and middle panels). Meanwhile, in different segments of aortas (Fig. 1B), TL1A treatment inhibited the progression of lesions in descending aorta, thoracic aorta, and abdominal aorta, but not aortic arch (Fig. 1A, right panel). Furthermore, TL1A treatment substantially reduced sinus lesion size in aortic root, from 6.04 × 105 in the control group to 4.43 × 105 µm2 in the TL1A-treated group (Fig. 1C). To investigate the effect of TL1A on vascular structure, we determined collagen content and necrotic areas in aortic root cross-sections. Fig. 1D shows that TL1A substantially reduced the area of necrotic cores (∼50%) while increasing thickness of the fibrous caps (∼1.5-fold) and collagen content (∼1.5-fold) in lesion areas, indicating that TL1A enhances plaque stability. Vascular calcification can increase risk of vulnerable lesion rupture (19Finn A.V. Nakano M. Narula J. Kolodgie F.D. Virmani R. Concept of vulnerable/unstable plaque.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2010; 30 (20554950): 1282-129210.1161/ATVBAHA.108.179739Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). By completing the Alizarin Red S staining of aortic root cross-sections, we found a marked decrease of calcification-positive areas in lesion areas of TL1A-treated mice (Fig. 1E). Taken together, these results suggest that TL1A inhibits the development of atherosclerosis, enhances lesion stability, and reduces vascular calcification. To assess whether the inhibition of lesions by TL1A is related to changes of serum lipid profiles, levels of total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and triglyceride were determined. As shown in Table 1, TL1A had little effect on lipid profiles, suggesting that the reduction of atherosclerosis is unrelated to serum cholesterol levels.Table 1TL1A treatment has little effect on serum lipid profiles and body weight gain. Male apoE−/− mice (∼8 weeks old) were randomly divided into two groups (10 mice/group) and received the treatment indicated in Fig. 1. At the end of the experiment, levels of serum total, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride were determinedParameterControlTL1ATotal cholesterol (mm)35.724 ± 3.66936.03 ± 4.629LDL-cholesterol (mm)12.645 ± 1.43612.925 ± 1.359HDL-cholesterol (mm)5.175 ± 0.5785.771 ± 0.959Triglyceride (mm)0.942 ± 0.0691.092 ± 0.187Body weight (g)32.73 ± 2.05132.34 ± 2.327Liver weight/body weight (%)6.103 ± 0.3886.111 ± 0.914 Open table in a new tab Although macrophage/foam cells play an important role in atherosclerosis, our results show that TL1A had little effect on monocyte/macrophage marker 2 (MOMA2) levels in aortic root (Fig. 2A). In addition, more foam cells were determined with peritoneal macrophages collected from TL1A-treated mice than controls (Fig. 2B), which is consistent with the previous report that TL1A stimulates differentiation of foam cells from either THP-1/PMA macrophages or primary human monocyte-derived macrophages in vitro (16McLaren J.E. Calder C.J. McSharry B.P. Sexton K. Salter R.C. Singh N.N. Wilkinson G.W. Wang E.C. Ramji D.P. The TNF-like protein 1A-death receptor 3 pathway promotes macrophage foam cell formation in vitro.J. Immunol. 2010; 184 (20410491): 5827-583410.4049/jimmunol.0903782Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To further confirm the effects of TL1A on formation of macrophage/foam cells, we isolated peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6J mice and treated the oxLDL-loaded cells with TL1A or TL1A plus T0901317 (T317, a synthetic ligand for liver X receptor (LXR), can inhibit formation of macrophage/foam cells). As shown in Fig. 2C, TL1A moderately increased the number of foam cells both in the presence or absence of oxLDL, whereas the number was reduced by T317 in the presence of oxLDL. Meanwhile, TL1A antagonized T317-reduced foam cells. Both ABC transporter A1 (ABCA1) and ABCG1, two target genes of LXR, are the main molecules mediating macrophage cholesterol efflux to reduce foam cell formation and activated by T317 (17Ma C. Zhang W. Yang X. Liu Y. Liu L. Feng K. Zhang X. Yang S. Sun L. Yu M. Yang J. Li X. Hu W. Miao R.Q. Zhu Y. et al.Functional interplay between liver X receptor and AMP-activated protein kinase α inhibits atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice-A new anti-atherogenic strategy.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2018; 175 (29394501): 1486-150310.1111/bph.14156Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, TL1A alone had moderate effects on ABCA1 expression but inhibited ABCG1 expression. In addition, TL1A substantially attenuated T317-induced ABCA1/G1 expression (Fig. 2, D and E). CD36 is a classic receptor for uptake of oxLDL by monocyte/macrophages, thereby facilitating formation of macrophage/foam cells and atherosclerosis development. CD36 can be activated by the transcription factor of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) (20Yang X. Zhang W. Chen Y. Li Y. Sun L. Liu Y. Liu M. Yu M. Li X. Han J. Duan Y. Activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and CD36 protein expression: the dual pathophysiological roles of progesterone.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291 (27226602): 15108-1511810.1074/jbc.M116.726737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), whereas sterol-responsive nuclear receptors, LXRα and LXRβ, are key determinants of cellular cholesterol homeostasis and promote cellular cholesterol efflux by up-regulating ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression (21Zhao C. Dahlman-Wright K. Liver X receptor in cholesterol metabolism.J. Endocrinol. 2010; 204 (19837721): 233-24010.1677/JOE-09-0271Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). We found that although TL1A alone moderately induced expression of PPARγ and its target, CD36, in macrophages, it did not further enhance the oxLDL-induced PPARγ and CD36 levels (Fig. 2, F and G). In contrast, LXRα and LXRβ expression was decreased by TL1A treatment in the presence or absence of oxLDL (Fig. 2, F and G). Functionally, we found that TL1A reduced cholesterol efflux to HDL from macrophages (Fig. 2H). Taken together, these results suggest that TL1A promotes formation of foam cells derived from macrophages by inducing CD36 expression and inhibiting ABCA1/G1 expression. It also implies that TL1A-inhibited atherosclerosis is unrelated to the formation of macrophage/foam cells. VSMC is another main cell type making contributions to atherosclerosis by various mechanisms. For instance, the cell phenotypic switch of VSMCs plays a vital role in plaque stability (9Chaabane C. Coen M. Bochaton-Piallat M.L. Smooth muscle cell phenotypic switch: implications for foam cell formation.Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2014; 25 (25110900): 374-37910.1097/MOL.0000000000000113Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of TL1A on VSMC phenotypic changes, we completed immunofluorescent staining of aortic root cross-sections with anti-αSMA and -OPN antibody. We found that expression of αSMA, the contractile marker linking to collagen content, was obviously elevated, whereas expression of OPN, the synthetic phenotype marker, was significantly reduced in TL1A-treated mice (Fig. 3A). These data indicate that TL1A can regulate the number of VSMCs in different phenotypes. We further defined the role of TL1A in VSMC phenotypic changes in vitro by treating human primary aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) with TL1A. At the mRNA levels, we found that TL1A increased levels of the contractile phenotype markers, such as αSMA and SM22α, while reducing levels of OPN and epiregulin (EREG), two proliferative markers (Fig. 3B, left half). Serum response factor (SRF) and myocardin (Myocd) can form SRF-Myocd complex, and the complex functions as major transcription factors to maintain high αSMA expression and VSMCs as a contractile phenotype. The SRF-Myocd complex can be negatively regulated by Msh homeobox 1 or 2 (Msx1/2) (22Han H. Yang S. Liang Y. Zeng P. Liu L. Yang X. Duan Y. Han J. Chen Y. Teniposide regulates the phenotype switching of vascular smooth muscle cells in a miR-21-dependent manner.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2018; 506 (30409428): 1040-104610.1016/j.bbrc.2018.10.198Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We determined that TL1A induced expression of SRF and Myocd and correspondingly reduced Msx2 expression (Fig. 3B, right half). Several studies indicate that microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in regulating VSMC phenotype transformation. For example, up-regulation of miR-214 by hypoxia mediates VSMC phenotypic modulation and proliferation (23Sahoo S. Meijles D.N. Al Ghouleh I. Tandon M. Cifuentes-Pagano E. Sembrat J. Rojas M. Goncharova E. Pagano P.J. MEF2C-MYOCD and leiomodin1 suppression by miRNA-214 promotes smooth muscle cell phenotype switching in pulmonary arterial hypertension.PLoS ONE. 2016; 11 (27144530): e015378010.1371/journal.pone.0153780Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). miR-145, one of the most abundant VSMC miRNAs, mitigates a phenotypic switch from the contractile state into the proliferative one by inducing Myocd expression (24Cordes K.R. Sheehy N.T. White M.P. Berry E.C. Morton S.U. Muth A.N. Lee T.H. Miano J.M. Ivey K.N. Srivastava D. miR-145 and miR-143 regulate smooth muscle cell fate and plasticity.Nature. 2009; 460 (19578358): 705-71010.1038/nature08195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar). miR-29b mimics reduces cell viability and promotes SMC apoptosis by inhibiting expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), one of the MMPs that enhances the VSMC switch from the contractile phenotype into the synthetic phenotype (25Shen L. Song Y. Fu Y. Li P. MiR-29b mimics promotes cell apoptosis of smooth muscle cells via targeting on MMP-2.Cytotechnology. 2018; 70: 351-35910.1007/s10616-017-0150-zCrossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 26Zhang J.R. Lu Q.B. Feng W.B. Wang H.P. Tang Z.H. Cheng H. Du Q. Wang Y.B. Li K.X. Sun H.J. Nesfatin-1 promotes VSMC migration and neointimal hyperplasia by upregulating matrix metalloproteinases and downregulating PPARγ.Biomed. Pharmacother. 2018; 102 (29604590): 711-71710.1016/j.biopha.2018.03.120Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that TL1A decreased miR-214-5p expression but increased expression of miR-145 and miR-29b (Fig. 3C, left three panels). Therefore, changes of the VSMC cell population in different phenotypes by TL1A are also related to the effect of TL1A on expression of the aforementioned miRNAs. Accumulating studies indicate that tumor suppressor p53 overexpression promotes SMC from the synthetic phenotype of migration characteristics to the quiescent and contractile phenotype by activating Myocd (27Tan Z. Li J. Zhang X. Yang X. Zhang Z. Yin K.J. Huang H. p53 promotes retinoid acid-induced smooth muscle cell differentiation by targeting myocardin.Stem Cells Dev. 2018; 27 (29482449): 534-54410.1089/scd.2017.0244Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We determined that TL1A significantly induced p53 expression in a dose-dependent manner, which was associated with decreased OPN and increased αSMA and SM22α expression proportionally (Fig. 3D). Reciprocally, when p53 expression in HASMCs was reduced by transfecting with p53 siRNA, expression of αSMA and SM22α was also markedly decreased, whereas the effect of TL1A on expression of these molecules was substantially attenuated (Fig. 3E). Taken together, the data above suggest that TL1A is able to regulate the VSMC cell population in different phenotypes and appears to enhance the switch of VSMCs from the synthetic/proliferative phenotype into the contractile phenotype by regulating expression of p53 and related miRNAs. However, the switch of VSMC phenotypes can be completed by different mechanisms. Enhancement of the apoptosis of VSMCs in the synthetic phenotype can also generate the apparent VSMC phenotype switch, particularly in the context of TL1A enhancing expression of p53 and miR-29b, two molecules that may enhance cell apoptosis. To determine the role of TL1A on cell apoptosis in vivo, we conducted TUNEL staining of the cross-sections of aortic root and thoracic aorta and quantified the number of TUNEL-positive cells. As shown in Fig. S1, TL1A had little effect on the number of apoptotic cells. Meanwhile, TL1A had little effect on expression of apoptosis-related genes, such as caspase-3, B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), and BCL2-associated X protein (BAX) in lesion areas either (Fig. S2). Consistent with in vivo results, we found that TL1A did not affect the viability of peritoneal macrophages (Fig. S3A) and HASMCs cultured either in normal medium or calcification medium (Fig. S3, B and C) (calcification medium can restrain cell growth; therefore, reduced cell viability was observed compared with cells cultured in normal medium). Furthermore, expression of apoptotis-related proteins was not altered by TL1A either (Fig. S3, D–G). Therefore, the results above suggest that the switch of VSMC phenotypes is not tightly linked to cell apoptosis. Similar to macrophages, VSMCs in synthetic phenotype are prone to differentiate into foam cells during atherosclerosis, and foam cells derived from VSMCs also potently contribute to the development of atherosclerosis (11Wang Y. Dubland J.A. Allahverdian S. Asonye E. Sahin B. Jaw J.E. Sin D.D. Seidman M.A. Leeper N.J. Francis G.A. Smooth muscle cells contribute the majority of foam cells in apoE (apolipoprotein E)-deficient mouse atherosclerosis.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2019; 39 (30786740): 876-88710.1161/ATVBAHA.119.312434Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated the effects of TL1A on VSMC/foam cell formation. HASMCs were treated with TL1A or TL1A plus oxLDL, followed by Oil Red O staining. Loading oxLDL to HASMCs potently increased Oil Red O–positive cells. However, TL1A clearly reduced HASMC/foam cells (Fig. 4A). Mechanistically, we determined that expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 was increased, particularly in the presence of oxLDL. Similar to macrophages, TL1A increased CD36 and PPARγ expression in HASMCs. However, TL1A inhibited oxLDL-activated CD36 and PPARγ expression (Fig. 4, B–E). In contrast to macrophages, TL1A alone activated LXRα and LXRβ expression and further enhanced oxLDL-induced LXR expression (Fig. 4, D and E). Correspondingly, TL1A activated ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression in HASMCs and enhanced cholesterol efflux from HASMCs (Fig. 4, B, C, and F). In vivo, TL1A treatment substantially enhanced ABCG1 with little effect on ABCA1 expression (Fig. 4G). Taken together, the results above demonstrate that TL1A treatment reduces formation of foam cells derived from VSMCs mainly by enhancing ABCA1/G1 expression with LXRα/β activation and promoting cholesterol efflux. The results of Verhoeff–Van Gieson (VVG) and Alizarin Red S staining (Fig. 1, D and E) demonstrate that TL1A can enhance plaque stability, which is related to reduction of vascular calcification. To further define the functions of TL1A on vascular calcification, we conducted immunofluorescence staining to determine the expression of runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), a key transcriptional factor in osteogenic differentiation, and its downstream genes, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and MMP9. As shown in Fig. 5 (A and B), expression of RUNX2, ALP, and MMP9 was reduced by TL1A, which was associated with reduced RUNX2 nuclear translocation. Vascular calcification is widely acknowledged as a potent risk factor for plaque rupture and the consequent sudden cardiovascular events (28Shioi A. Ikari Y. Plaque calcification during atherosclerosis progression and regression.J. Atheroscler. Thromb. 2018; 25 (29238011): 294-30310.5551/jat.RV17020Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The osteoblast-like cells deriving from VSMCs in calcified plaques plays an important role in the process of vascular calcification (29Leopold J.A. Vascular calcification: mechanisms of vascular smooth muscle cell calcification.Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2015; 25 (25435520): 267-27410.1016/j.tcm.2014.10.021Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Therefore, we further determined the effects of TL1A on HASMC calcification in vitro. The results of Alizarin Red S staining in Fig. 5C show that calcification medium caused severe calcium accumulation within cells. However, the accumulation was clearly attenuated by TL1A. The quantification of cellular calcium content further confirms the inhibitory effect of TL1A on calcification (Fig. 5D). In addition, the results of immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting demonstrate that calcification medium induced RUNX2 expression and nuclear translocation in HASMCs, which was reduced by TL1A (Fig. 5, E–G). Consequently, calcification medium–activated expression of other critical molecules for osteoblast differentiation, such as bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), ALP, and OPN proteins in HASMCs, was reduced by TL1A (Fig. 5, H and I). Associated with changes in protein levels, mRNA levels of these osteogenic phenotype markers increased by calcification medium were attenuated by TL1A (Fig. 5J). To further confirm the direct effect of TL1A on RUNX2 activity, we constructed a RUNX2 promoter (pRUNX2). As shown in Fig. 5 (K and L), TL1A decreased calcification medium–activated RUNX2 promoter activity. It has been reported that miR-203-3p can suppress osteoblast differentiation by targeting RUNX2 (30Tu B. Liu S. Yu B. Zhu J. Ruan H. Tang T. Fan C. miR-203 inhibits the traumatic heterotopic ossification by targeting Runx2.Cell Death Dis. 2016; 7 (27787524): e243610.1038/cddis.2016.325Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that treatment of HASMCs with TL1A increased miR-203-3p expression (Fig. 3C, right), another underlying mechanism for inhibition of VSMC osteogenic differentiation by TL1A. Taken together, the results above demonstrate that TL1A inhibits vascular calcification by inactivating RUNX2 pathway both in vivo and in vitro. Chronic inflammation is a key factor in atherogenesis. It destroys the arterial wall microenvironment and contributes to plaque formation (1Wolf D. Ley K. Immunity and inflammation in atherosclerosis.Circ.

However, the effectiveness of these policies has rarely been evaluated. In this study, the potential and spatial distribution of agricultural non-point source pollution in the Baiyangdian Basin are reported. This investigation considers multiple parameters under various policies with county as a basic unit. The results for the potential pollution from chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) are 60.89×104, 3.93×104, 87.05×104 and 15.10×104 Mg, with corresponding intensities of 190, 12, 272 and 47 kg ha-1 for the Baiyangdian Basin in 2016. The highest pollution from COD is attributed to livestock and poultry breeding, whereas TN and TP are dominantly produced by rural domestic sources, and NH3-N is mostly derived from planting. Spatially, distribution of the counties producing larger non-point source pollution presented a northeast to southwest direction, consistent with the Taihang mountain alignment in the basin. The counties with high pollution intensities are mostly in the south and east of the basin. Agricultural non-point source pollution control and prevention policies contributed in pollution reduction. Compared with 2016, the total potential pollution of COD, NH3-N, TN and TP in 2020 decrease by 45.1%, 14.7%, 37.9% and 37.4%, respectively, whereas for an assumed future time (F2), the decreases are 59%, 51.4%, 56.2% and 55.7%, respectively. Prevention measures should focus on reducing pollution from livestock and poultry breeding as well as planting."
https://openalex.org/W3087321517,"Timely diagnosis of COVID-19 infected individuals and their prompt isolation are essential for controlling the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Though quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) is the method of choice for COVID-19 diagnostics, the resource-intensive and time-consuming nature of the technique impairs its wide applicability in resource-constrained settings and calls for novel strategies to meet the ever-growing demand for more testing. In this context, a pooled sample testing strategy was evaluated in the setting of emerging disease outbreak in 3 central Indian districts to assess if the cost of the test and turn-around time could be reduced without compromising its diagnostic characteristics and thus lead to early containment of the outbreak. From 545 nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples received from the three emerging districts, a total of 109 pools were created with 5 consecutive samples in each pool. The diagnostic performance of qRT-PCR on pooled sample was compared with that of individual samples in a blinded manner. While pooling reduced the cost of diagnosis by 68% and the laboratory processing time by 66%, 5 of the 109 pools showed discordant results when compared with induvial samples. Four pools which tested negative contained 1 positive sample and 1 pool which was positive did not show any positive sample on deconvolution. Presence of a single infected sample with Ct value of 34 or higher, in a pool of 5, was likely to be missed in pooled sample analysis. At the reported point prevalence of 4.8% in this study, the negative predictive value of qRT-PCR on pooled samples was around 96% suggesting that the adoption of this strategy as an effective screening tool for COVID-19 needs to be carefully evaluated."

Post hoc longitudinal analysis showed that boundary-based navigation predicts worsening episodic memory concerns in high-risk (F = 5.01, P = 0.03), but in not low-risk, AD candidates. The VST and the Sea Hero Quest produced parameters with acceptable test-retest reliability. Further research in larger sample sizes is desirable."
https://openalex.org/W3089187172,"Exploiting plant extracts to form metallic nanoparticles has been becoming the promising alternative routes of chemical and physical methods owing to environmentally friendly and abundantly renewable resources. In this study, Momordica charantia and Psidium guajava leaf extract (MC.broth and PG.broth) are exploited to fabricate two kinds of biogenic silver nanoparticles (MC.AgNPs and PG.AgNPs). Phytoconstituent screening is performed to identify the categories of natural compounds in MC.broth and PG.broth. Both extracts contain wealthy polyphenols which play a role of reducing agent to turn silver (I) ions into silver nuclei. Trace alkaloids, rich saponins and other oxygen-containing compounds creating the organic corona surrounding nanoparticles act as stabilizing agents. MC.AgNPs and PG.AgNPs are characterized by UV-vis and FTIR spectrophotometry, EDS and TEM techniques. FTIR spectra indicate the presence of O-H, C = O, C-O-C and C = C groups on the surface of silver nanoparticles which is corresponded with three elements of C, O and Ag found in EDS analysis. TEM micrographs show the spherical morphology of MC.AgNPs and PG.AgNPs. MC.AgNPs were 17.0 nm distributed in narrow range of 5–29 nm, while the average size of PG.AgNPs were 25.7 nm in the range of 5–53 nm. Further, MC.AgNPs and PG.AgNPs exhibit their effectively inhibitory ability against A. niger, A. flavus and F. oxysporum as dose-dependence. Altogether, MC.AgNPs and PG.AgNPs will have much potential in scaled up production and become the promising fungicides for agricultural applications."
https://openalex.org/W3087901194,"Background Uganda has been making progress towards universal HIV test and treat since 2013 and the 2016 test and treat policy was expanded from the 2013 guidelines. The expanded policy was rolled out in 2017 across the country. The treatment outcomes of this new policy have not yet been assessed at program level. The objective of this study was to determine the treatment outcome of the HIV test and treat policy in TASO Tororo Clinic, Eastern Uganda. Methodology This was a retrospective cohort study using secondary data. The study involved 580 clients who were newly diagnosed HIV positive in TASO Tororo clinic between June 2017 and May 2018, who were then followed up for ART initiation, retention in care, viral load monitoring and viral load suppression. The data was analyzed using Stat 14.0 version statistical software application. Results Of the 580 clients, 93.1%(540) were adults aged ≥20 years. The uptake of test and treat was at 92.4%(536) and 12 months retention was at 78.7% (422). The factors associated with retention in care were a) being counselled before ART initiation, AOR 2.41 (95%CI, 1.56–3.71), b) having a treatment supporter, AOR 1.57 (95%CI, 1.02–2.43) and having an opportunistic infection, AOR 2.99 (95%CI:1.21–7.41). The viral load coverage was 52.4% (221) and viral load suppression rate was 89.1% (197) of clients monitored. Age <20 years was the only identified factor associated with vial load non suppression, AOR 7.35 (95% CI = 2.23–24.24). Conclusion This study found high uptake of ART under test and treat policy, with very low viral load coverage, and a high viral load suppression rate among those monitored. The study therefore highlights a need to differentiate viral load testing based on the population needs and ensure each client testing positive receives pre-ART initiation counselling so as to improve retention in care."
https://openalex.org/W3088515489,"Both hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are major sources of morbidity and mortality worldwide; however, their prevalence in key groups in Colombia is not yet known. We aimed to analyse the prevalence of HBV and HCV and its associated factors in key groups who were treated at an institution providing health services in Colombia during 2019. This was a multiple-group ecological study that included 2,624 subjects from the general population, 1,100 men who have had sex with men (MSM), 1,061 homeless individuals, 380 sex workers, 260 vulnerable young people, 202 drug users, 41 inmates and 103 people from the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. Prevalence of infection with a 95% confidence interval and its associated factors was calculated for each group. Confounding variables were assessed using logistical regression and SPSS 25.0 software. Prevalence of HBV and HCV in the general population was 0.15% and 0.27%, respectively; 0.27% and 2.09% in MSM; 0.37% and 2.17% amongst homeless individuals; 0.26% and 0.0% amongst sex workers; 0.39% and 0.0% amongst vulnerable youth; and 5.94% and 45.54 amongst injecting drug users. In the multivariate HBV model, the explanatory variables included the study group, city of origin and the type of health affiliation; for HCV they were group, origin, sex, age group, health affiliation, use of drugs and hallucinogen use during sexual intercourse. A high prevalence of HBV and HCV were evidenced for both viral infections, which was, consequently, much higher within the key groups. The main associated factors that were identified related to origin and type of health affiliation and demonstrated a double vulnerability, that is, belonging to groups that are discriminated and excluded from many health policies and living under unfavourable socioeconomic conditions that prevent proper affiliation and health care."
https://openalex.org/W3088262461,"This work aimed at studying the photochemical treatment of a landfill leachate using ultraviolet light, hydrogen peroxide, and ferrous or ferric ions, in a batch recycle photoreactor. The effect of inorganic carbon presence, pH, initial H2O2 amount (0-9990 mg L-1) as well as Fe(II) (200-600 ppm) and Fe(III) (300-700 ppm) concentrations on the total carbon removal and color change was studied. Prior to the photochemical treatment, a pretreatment process was applied; inorganic nitrogen and inorganic carbon were removed by means of air stripping and initial pH regulation, respectively. The leachate sent subsequently for photochemical treatment was free of inorganic carbon and contained only organic carbon with concentration 1200±100 mg L-1 at pH 5.1-5.3. The most favorable concentrations of H2O2 and ferric ions for carbon removal were 6660 mg L-1 and 400 ppm, respectively. Adjusting the initial pH value in the range of 2.2-5.3 had a significant effect on the organic carbon removal. The photo-Fenton-like process was more advantageous than the photo-Fenton one for leachate treatment. By applying the most favorable operating conditions, 88.7% removal of total organic carbon, 100% removal of total inorganic carbon, 96.5% removal of total nitrogen, and 98.2% color removal were achieved."
https://openalex.org/W3089135590,"While tumor resection and liver transplantation (LT) represent potentially curative therapeutic options for patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the identification of the ideal surgical candidates has remained challenging. Just recently, miRNA-193a-5p was described as a tumor suppressor in murine and human HCC but only little is known about circulating miRNA-193a-5p in HCC patients. Here, we evaluated serum levels of miR-193a-5p by qPCR in 41 HCC patients undergoing tumor resection (n = 33) or LT (n = 8) and 20 controls. Circulating relative miR-193a-5p levels were significantly elevated in HCC patients compared to healthy controls. While relative miR-193a-5p levels were comparable between patients of different underlying disease etiology and tumor size, high relative miR-193a-5p levels were predictive for the patients’ postoperative outcome, which was confirmed in uni- and multivariate Cox-regression analysis. As such, HCC patients with a preoperative relative miR-193a-5p level above the ideal cut-off value (3.57) had a median overall survival (OS) of only 451 days compared to 1158 days in patients with a relative miR-193a-5p level below this cut-off value. Our data support a novel function of miR-193a-5p as a biomarker in early-stage HCC patients that might help to identify the best surgical candidates in terms of postoperative outcome."
https://openalex.org/W3085769041,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a highly prevalent clinical syndrome with high mortality and morbidity. Previous studies indicated that inflammation promotes tubular damage and plays a key role in AKI progress. Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) has been linked to macrophage-related inflammation in AKI. Up to date, however, no Syk-targeted therapy for AKI has been reported. In this study, we employed both cell model of LPS-induced bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) and mouse model of ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI)-induced AKI to evaluate the effects of a Syk inhibitor, BAY61-3606 (BAY), on macrophage inflammation in vitro and protection of kidney from AKI in vivo. The expression and secretion of inflammatory cytokines, both in vitro and in vivo, were significantly inhibited even back to normal levels by BAY. The upregulated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels in the AKI mice were significantly reduced after administration of BAY, implicating a protective effect of BAY on kidneys against IRI. Further analyses from Western blot, immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry revealed that BAY inhibited the Mincle/Syk/NF-κB signaling circuit and reduced the inflammatory response. BAY also inhibited the reactive oxygen species (ROS), which further decreased the formation of inflammasome and suppressed the mature of IL-1β and IL-18. Notably, these inhibitory effects of BAY on inflammation and inflammasome in BMDM were significantly reversed by Mincle ligand, trehalose-6,6-dibehenate. In summary, these findings provided compelling evidence that BAY may be an efficient inhibitor of the Mincle/Syk/NF-κB signaling circuit and ROS-induced inflammasome, which may help to develop Syk-inhibitors as novel therapeutic agents for AKI."

The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (pVHL) acts as a master regulator of HIF activity, and its targeting of prolyl hydroxylated HIF-α for proteasomal degradation under normoxia is thought to be a major mechanism for pVHL tumor suppression and cellular response to oxygen. Whether pVHL regulates other targets through a similar mechanism is largely unknown. Here, we identify TET2/3 as novel targets of pVHL. pVHL induces proteasomal degradation of TET2/3, resulting in reduced global 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels. Conserved proline residues within the LAP/LAP-like motifs of these two proteins are hydroxylated by the prolyl hydroxylase enzymes (PHD2/EGLN1 and PHD3/EGLN3), which is prerequisite for pVHL-mediated degradation. Using zebrafish as a model, we determined that global 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels are enhanced in vhl-null, egln1a/b-double-null, and egln3-null embryos.

The identification of factors that modulate TET stability and the demonstration of the mechanisms underlying this modulation would greatly increase the understanding of the TET function. However, as a classic protein degradation pathway, ubiquitin-proteasome system–mediated proteolysis of TET proteins remains poorly understood (38Bhattacharyya S. Yu H. Mim C. Matouschek A. Regulated protein turnover: snapshots of the proteasome in action.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 15 (24452470): 122-13310.1038/nrm3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 39Geng F. Wenzel S.

Given the reciprocal effect of hypoxia signaling and TET proteins, we sought to determine whether pVHL, as a key component of the E3 ligase complex of hypoxia signaling complex, has an effect on TET protein stability and function in mediating DNA demethylation. In this study, we demonstrate that pVHL targets TET protein for proteasomal degradation. Moreover, the prolyl hydroxylation of TET proteins catalyzed by PHD2 and PHD3 is prerequisite for pVHL-mediated proteasomal degradation, revealing a mechanism of PHD-pVHL in regulating TET proteins that is similar to its mechanism in regulating HIF-α proteins. To test whether pVHL interacts with TET proteins, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays. We cotransfected Myc-tagged pVHL (Myc-VHL) together with FLAG-tagged TET1/2/3 into HEK293T cells. FLAG-TET1/2/3 pulled down Myc-pVHL efficiently (Fig. S1A and Fig. 1, A and B). To confirm whether pVHL interacts with TET endogenously, we further performed co-immunoprecipitation assays using polyclonal anti-pVHL antibodies in H1299 cells, a nonsmall-cell lung carcinoma cell line that expresses endogenous pVHL, TET2/3. Compared with rabbit IgG, anti-pVHL antibody pulled down endogenous TET2/3 (Fig. 1C). Because of a lack of suitable anti-TET1 antibody, we could not confirm whether pVHL interacts with TET1 endogenously. Therefore, in subsequent assays, we focused our studies on pVHL modulating TET2/3. Given the well-characterized function of pVHL as a component of the VHL-elongin B/C E3 ligase complex (40Ivan M. Kaelin Jr, W.G. The EGLN-HIF O2-sensing system: multiple inputs and feedbacks.Mol. Cell. 2017; 66 (28622522): 772-77910.1016/j.molcel.2017.06.002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether pVHL could mediate TET proteasomal degradation. Coexpression of FLAG-tagged pVHL together with HA-tagged TET2/3 in HEK293T cells caused a dramatic reduction of TET2 and TET3 protein levels in a dose-response manner, but the proteasomal inhibitor, MG132 (20 μm), blocked reduction of TET2/3 effectively (Fig. 1, D and E). Similarly, coexpression of pVHL together with HA-tagged TET1, FLAG-tagged TET2, or FLAG-tagged TET3 in HEK293T cells decreased the protein levels of TET1, TET2, and TET3 (Fig. S1, B and C). Consistently, overexpression of pVHL caused reduction of endogenous TET2/3 levels in H1299 cells, which were blocked by MG132 (20 μm) (Fig. 1F). In addition, overexpression of pVHL also caused reduction of endogenous TET2 levels in HEK293T cells (Fig. S1D). Conversely, knockdown of pVHL by VHL-shRNA in H1299 cells enhanced TET2/3 protein levels (Fig. 1G). When the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (50 μg/ml) was added to the culture medium, the degradation rate of TET2/3 was faster when pVHL was coexpressed compared with the empty vector control, suggesting that the new protein synthesis was not required in this process (Fig. 1, H and I). Taken together, these data suggest that pVHL induces proteasomal degradation of TET proteins. Of note, it has been reported that hypoxia enhances TET expression (resulted in increased 5-hmC) via HIF-dependent transactivation of TET1/2/3 (20Hattori M. Yokoyama Y. Hattori T. Motegi S. Amano H.

To determine whether degradation of endogenous TET2/3 by pVHL is caused by the effect of pVHL in suppression of HIF-dependent TET2/3 transactivation, we performed quantitative real time PCR assays (qPCR). As shown in Fig. S2A, overexpression of pVHL in H1299 cells could not diminish TET2/3 mRNA levels under normoxia, which agreed with the low protein levels of HIF-α in VHL-intact cell lines under normoxia (42Tanimoto K. Makino Y. Pereira T. Poellinger L. Mechanism of regulation of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 α by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein.EMBO J. 2000; 19 (10944113): 4298-430910.1093/emboj/19.16.4298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, knockdown of pVHL by VHL-shRNA in H1299 cells increased TET2/3 mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner under normoxia (Fig. S2B). Moreover, when the HIF-α–specific inhibitor 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME2) (50 μm) was added to the culture medium (43Mabjeesh N.J. Escuin D. LaVallee T.M. Pribluda V.S. Swartz G.M. Johnson M.S.

These data indicate that pVHL could indeed modulate TET expression via HIF-dependent transactivation. However, when the HIF-α function was blocked by 2ME2 (50 μm), knockdown of pVHL still clearly caused increases of endogenous TET2/3 protein levels (Fig. S2D), suggesting that pVHL could regulate TET stability at the protein level independent of HIF and regulate TET expression via HIF-dependent transactivation in H1299 cells as reported previously (20Hattori M.

https://openalex.org/W3087863871,"Least Cost Path (LCP) analysis allows a user to define a cost parameter through which cost of movement can be assessed using Geographical Information Systems (GIS). These analyses are commonly used to construct theoretical movement through a landscape, which has been useful for creating hypotheses concerning prehistoric archaeology and landscape genomics. However, LCP analysis is commonly employed without testing the generated LCP(s), complicating its usefulness as a methodological tool. This paper proposes a model for analyzing movement in ArcGIS by using topography data to calculate slope. This slope data is then then used to calculate LCPs based on travel time and kilocalorie expenditure. LCPs were constructed in the Nature Preserve at Binghamton University, a 182-acre area that consists of wetland and mountainous terrain, and a Fitbit® Surge activity monitor was used to test the accuracy of the model's predictions. Paired sample t-tests show a lack of significant difference between calculated and walked time in our analysis (p = .953), suggesting that our model can estimate travel time between two points based solely on slope of the region. Paired sample t-tests also show a lack of significant difference between calculated and observed kilocalorie expenditure (p = .930), suggesting that our model is also capable of estimating kilocalorie expenditure associated with movement between two points. Finally, paired sample t-tests confirm that straight line distances do not reflect real movement through a terrain (p = .009), highlighting the need for alternate measures of movement when analyzing the effects of local landscape on movement. Our current model shows strength in its estimations of travel time and kilocalorie expenditure based on topography of a region-future iterations of the model need to establish the statistical similarity between our model's estimations and recorded values for walking time and kilocalorie expenditure."

Identification of genetic drivers promoting dissemination of tumor cells may provide opportunities for novel therapeutic strategies. We previously reported an in vivo gain-of-function screen that identified ~30 genes with a functional role in metastasis promotion and characterized detailed mechanistic functions of two hits. In this study, we characterized the contribution of one of the identified genes, MBIP (MAP3K12 binding inhibitory protein), towards driving tumor invasion and metastasis. We demonstrate that expression of MBIP significantly enhances the cellular proliferation, migration and invasion of NSCLC cells in vitro and metastasis in vivo. We functionally characterized that MBIP mediates activation of the JNK pathway and induces expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are necessary for the invasive and metastatic phenotype. Our findings establish a novel mechanistic role of MBIP as a driver of NSCLC progression and metastasis."

Lifestyle factors such as past and present physical activity, past and present sun exposure, current dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D, nutritional status as measured by BMI, family history of osteoporosis and current hormonal status were analysed. Methods The study involved 500 women over 40 years old. All examined women was the same ethnicity- European origin. Methods used: densitometry method (DXA), bioelectrical impedance analysis, International Physical Activity Questionnaire, nutrition questionnaire, past and present sun exposure questionnaire. Past and present physical activity, past and present sun exposure and sufficient level of calcium in the diet proved to be the most important factors determining mineralization of bone tissue of women. In order to indicate an independent association of the correct bone tissue mineralization with individual factors, multivariate analysis was used—logistic regression. Results The norm BMD in the distal part of the forearm was strongly influenced: recommended dietary calcium intake (OR = 5.95; p = 0.003), moderately (OR = 1.88; p = 0.053) and high (OR = 14.0; p<0.001) past physical activity, sufficient (OR = 4.97; p<0.001) and high (OR = 18.9; p = 0.004) level of present physical activity, sufficient past (OR = 5.15; p<0.001) and sufficient present sun exposure (OR = 10.0; p<0.001). The chance for the BMD prox norm was also increased several times: high past physical activity (OR = 68.4; p<0.0001) and sufficient past sun exposure (OR = 10.6; p<0.001), moderate past activity (OR = 4.20; p<0.001), sufficient (OR = 6.13; p<0.001) and high (OR = 10.0; p<0.001) present physical activity, sufficient present sun exposure (OR = 9.09; p<0.0001), recommended intake of calcium (OR = 9.57; p<0.001) and vitamin D (OR = 2.68; p = 0.052). Whereas e significantly lower likelihood for the BMD prox norm was found in women with the oldest hormonal status (postmenopausal period) (OR = 0.18; p<0.001), with osteoporosis in the family (OR = 0.37; p<0.001) and living in an agglomeration (OR = 0.68; p = 0.03).

https://openalex.org/W3087783583,"DNA topoisomerase II (topo II) is an essential enzyme that regulates DNA topology by DNA cleavage and re-ligation. In vertebrates, there are two isozymes, α and β. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the isozymes, which shows a low degree of sequence homology between α and β, is involved in each isozyme-specific intracellular behavior. The CTD of topo IIβ is supposedly involved in topo II regulation. Topo IIβ is maintained in an inactive state in the nucleoli by the binding of RNA to the 50-residue region termed C-terminal regulatory domain (CRD) present in the CTD. Although in vitro biochemical analysis indicates that the CTD of topo IIβ has DNA binding activity, it is unclear whether CTD influences catalytic reaction in the nucleoplasm. Here, we show that the proximal CTD (hereafter referred to as pCTD) of rat topo IIβ, including the CRD, is involved in the catalytic reaction in the nucleoplasm. We identified the pCTD as a domain with DNA binding activity by in vitro catenation assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching (FRAP) analysis of pCTD-lacking mutant (ΔpCTD) showed higher mobility in nucleoplasm than that of the wild-type enzyme, indicating that the pCTD also affected the nuclear dynamics of topo IIβ. ICRF-193, one of the topo II catalytic inhibitors, induces the formation of closed-clamp intermediates of topo II. Treatment of ΔpCTD with ICRF-193 significantly decreased the efficiency of closed-clamp formation. Altogether, our data indicate that the binding of topo IIβ to DNA through the pCTD is required for the catalytic reaction in the nucleoplasm."

Also, the underlying effects on the technical-tactical actions and activity profiles were examined. Twelve well-trained female players (age: 25±5 years; maximum oxygen uptake: 40.9±4.3 ml/kg/min) played points against an opponent of similar ability outdoors on red-clay courts. The players played points over five playing conditions. Before each condition, the players were instructed to apply either a passive, an active, or their own playing strategy (free play) to succeed. The five conditions were played in a randomized order, whereas the condition with the own strategy was always played first and served as control. During play, the external and internal loads were investigated by 10 Hz global positioning system, 100 Hz inertial measurement unit, short-range telemetry, capillary blood, and visual analog scale procedures. A 25 Hz video camera was used to examine the technical-tactical actions and activity profiles. Compared to the control condition, the passive, active, and mixed playing strategy conditions induce up to large effects on the external loads (running distances with high acceleration and deceleration), up to moderate effects on the internal loads (energy expenditures spent with high metabolic power, lactate concentration, and rating of effort), and up to very large effects on the technical-tactical actions (number of ground strokes and errors) and activity profiles (strokes per rally, rally duration, work to rest ratio, and effective playing time). Our study shows that passive, active, and mixed playing strategies have an impact on the external and internal loads, technical-tactical actions, and activity profiles of female tennis players during match play. This finding should be considered for practical purposes like match analyses and training procedures in the tennis environment."
https://openalex.org/W3089062014,"Ceramics are quintessential indicators of human culture and its evolution across generations of social learners. Cultural transmission and evolution theory frequently emphasizes apprentices' need for accurate imitation (high-fidelity copying) of their mentors' actions. However, the ensuing prediction of standardized fashioning patterns within communities of practice has not been directly addressed in handicraft traditions such as pottery throwing. To fill this gap, we analysed variation in vessel morphogenesis amongst and within traditional potters from culturally different workshops producing for the same market. We demonstrate that, for each vessel type studied, individual potters reliably followed distinctive routes through morphological space towards a much-less-variable common final shape. Our results indicate that mastering the pottery handicraft does not result from accurately reproducing a particular model behaviour specific to the community's cultural tradition. We provide evidence that, at the level of the elementary clay-deforming gestures, individual learning rather than simple imitation is required for the acquisition of a complex motor skill such as throwing pottery."

Fighter pilots and non-fighter pilot officers were compared after matching on sex, age at first observation (15 age groups), and age at last observation (15 age groups). Sex-stratified overall and site-specific cancer rates were compared with matched Poisson regression to determine incidence rate ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Results During 1,412,590 person-years of follow-up, among the study population of 88,432 service members (4,949 fighter pilots and 83,483 matched officers), 977 incident cancer cases were diagnosed (86 in fighter pilots and 891 in matched officers). Male fighter pilots and matched officers had similar rates of all malignant cancers (RR = 1.04; 95% CI: 0.83–1.31) and of each cancer site. Female fighter pilots and matched officers also had similar rates of all malignant cancers (RR = 0.99; 95% CI: 0.25–4.04). Discussion In the active component U.S. Air Force, fighter pilots and their officer peers had similar overall and site-specific cancer rates."
https://openalex.org/W3088375633,"The objectives are exploring the impacts of geologic hazards on the construction of homestays, improving the safety of homestay buildings, guaranteeing the safety of tourists, and enhancing the disaster-resistance of homestays in scenery spots. The computer simulation system and Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology are employed to construct a geologic hazard prediction model for homestays. The model utilizes a time history method to establish a complete early-warning and monitoring system by learning the geologic disaster data. The detection of various geologic hazards has verified the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results show that the model can reduce the losses in the case of water accumulation and landslides during storms, and the BIM technology-based homestay buildings will suffer fewer losses. In the case of earthquakes, BIM technology-based homestay buildings have no noticeable shaking and displacement. Compared to traditional construction methods, the displacement is reduced by 49.15%. In the case of a spontaneous fire, the burning area of the BIM technology-based homestay building is only 270m2. The most severe factors affecting the construction of homestay buildings are earthquakes and landslide risks. The BIM technology generates 3D building planning; therefore, planners can fully understand the problems in the building. In the meantime, the multi-source monitoring data of multiple geologic hazards can be monitored and fed back, thereby improving the timeliness of early-warning of geologic hazards. The results are of considerable significance to the prevention of losses caused by geologic hazards, which can significantly improve the understanding of geologic hazards."
https://openalex.org/W3088557317,"Dendrochronology, the study of annual rings formed by trees and woody plants, has important applications in research of climate and environmental phenomena of the past. Since its inception in the late 19th century, dendrochronology has not had a way to quantify uncertainty about the years assigned to each ring (dating). There are, however, many woody species and sites where it is difficult or impossible to delimit annual ring boundaries and verify them with crossdating, especially in the lowland tropics. Rather than ignoring dating uncertainty or discarding such samples as useless, we present for the first time a probabilistic approach to assign expected ages with a confidence interval. It is proven that the cumulative age in a tree-ring time series advances by an amount equal to the probability that a putative growth boundary is truly annual. Confidence curves for the tree stem radius as a function of uncertain ages are determined. A sensitivity analysis shows the effect of uncertainty of the probability that a recognizable boundary is annual, as well as of the number of expected missing boundaries. Furthermore, we derive a probabilistic version of the mean sensitivity of a dendrochronological time series, which quantifies a tree's sensitivity to environmental variation over time, as well as probabilistic versions of the autocorrelation and process standard deviation. A computer code in Mathematica is provided, with sample input files, as supporting information. Further research is necessary to analyze frequency patterns of false and missing boundaries for different species and sites."
https://openalex.org/W3089106696,"Improved genome engineering methods that enable automation of large and precise edits are essential for systematic investigations of genome function. We adapted peel-1 negative selection to an optimized Dual-Marker Selection (DMS) cassette protocol for CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering in Caenorhabditis elegans and observed robust increases in multiple measures of efficiency that were consistent across injectors and four genomic loci. The use of Peel-1-DMS selection killed animals harboring transgenes as extrachromosomal arrays and spared genome-edited integrants, often circumventing the need for visual screening to identify genome-edited animals. To demonstrate the applicability of the approach, we created deletion alleles in the putative proteasomal subunit pbs-1 and the uncharacterized gene K04F10.3 and used machine vision to automatically characterize their phenotypic profiles, revealing homozygous essential and heterozygous behavioral phenotypes. These results provide a robust and scalable approach to rapidly generate and phenotype genome-edited animals without the need for screening or scoring by eye."
https://openalex.org/W3089264721,"Streams and rivers are biodiverse and provide valuable ecosystem services. Maintaining these ecosystems is an important task, so organisations often monitor the status and trends in stream condition and biodiversity using field sampling and, more recently, autonomous in-situ sensors. However, data collection is often costly, so effective and efficient survey designs are crucial to maximise information while minimising costs. Geostatistics and optimal and adaptive design theory can be used to optimise the placement of sampling sites in freshwater studies and aquatic monitoring programs. Geostatistical modelling and experimental design on stream networks pose statistical challenges due to the branching structure of the network, flow connectivity and directionality, and differences in flow volume. Geostatistical models for stream network data and their unique features already exist. Some basic theory for experimental design in stream environments has also previously been described. However, open source software that makes these design methods available for aquatic scientists does not yet exist. To address this need, we present SSNdesign, an R package for solving optimal and adaptive design problems on stream networks that integrates with existing open-source software. We demonstrate the mathematical foundations of our approach, and illustrate the functionality of SSNdesign using two case studies involving real data from Queensland, Australia. In both case studies we demonstrate that the optimal or adaptive designs outperform random and spatially balanced survey designs implemented in existing open-source software packages. The SSNdesign package has the potential to boost the efficiency of freshwater monitoring efforts and provide much-needed information for freshwater conservation and management."
https://openalex.org/W3089300809,"The genus Vitivirus in the family Betaflexiviridae includes eleven viruses known to infect grapevine: grapevine vitiviruses A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, L and M (GVA-GVM). Three of these viruses, GVA, GVB and GVD, have been associated with the etiology of rugose wood disease in grapevine and cause agronomically significant losses. The other vitiviruses were more recently discovered and their effects on grapevine are undetermined. To certify grape material for propagation as virus tested, an updated reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assay to detect all known vitiviruses is desirable. To accomplish this, multiple grapevine vitivirus sequences were aligned at the amino acid level to search for conserved motifs. Two highly conserved motifs were found at an ideal distance for RT-PCR detection in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase region of the replicase protein. The amino acid motifs were back translated to create degenerate primers and used to successfully amplify all eleven grapevine vitiviruses. The RT-PCR primers were used to test a panel of vitivirus-infected vines for inclusivity as well as vines infected with closely related viruses in the Betaflexiviridae family (i.e. grapevine pinot gris virus and grapevine rupestris stem pitting-associated virus) for exclusivity. Broader use of these primers to detect vitiviruses in other plant hosts was investigated. In summary, an end-point RT-PCR assay that detects all the known grapevine vitiviruses and potentially other members of the genus Vitivirus has been developed. The universal assay represents an alternative to individual assays to reduce the work associated with the diagnosis of vitiviruses, including for regulatory purposes."
https://openalex.org/W3088027638,"The Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type I (HIV-1) subtype B comprises approximately 10% of all HIV infections in the world. The HIV-1 subtype B epidemic comprehends a pandemic variant (named BPANDEMIC) disseminated worldwide and non-pandemic variants (named BCAR) that are mostly restricted to the Caribbean. The goal of this work was the identification of amino acid signatures (AAs) characteristic to the BCAR and BPANDEMIC variants. To this end, we analyzed HIV-1 subtype B full-length (n = 486) and partial (n = 814) genomic sequences from the Americas classified within the BCAR and BPANDEMIC clades and reconstructed the sequences of their most recent common ancestors (MRCA). Analysis of contemporary HIV-1 sequences revealed 13 AAs between BCAR and BPANDEMIC variants (four on Gag, three on Pol, three on Rev, and one in Vif, Vpu, and Tat) of which only two (one on Gag and one on Pol) were traced to the MRCA. All AAs correspond to polymorphic sites located outside essential functional proteins domains, except the AAs in Tat. The absence of stringent AAs inherited from their ancestors between modern BCAR and BPANDEMIC variants support that ecological factors, rather than viral determinants, were the main driving force behind the successful spread of the BPANDEMIC strain."
https://openalex.org/W3088147247,"Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) and assessment of collateral flow with multiphase computed tomography angiography (CTA) have been investigated as predictors of clinical outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke. This study assessed the value of multiphase CTA ASPECTS in predicting final infarction core and clinical outcome in patients undergoing endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke.We retrospectively studied consecutive patients who underwent multiphase CTA prior to endovascular treatment of acute stroke due to anterior circulation large artery occlusion. Multiphase CTA and final diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) scans were evaluated by two independent observers for NCCT ASPECTS, acute phase CTA (CTA-AP) ASPECTS, delayed phase CTA (CTA-DP) ASPECTS, and final DWI ASPECTS. Modified Rankin Scale score ≤2 at 3 months was considered a favorable outcome.A total of 74 patients were analyzed. We found that CTA-DP ASPECTS (r = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.73-0.91; p < 0.001) correlated with final DWI ASPECTS better than NCCT ASPECTS (r = 0.49; 95% CI, 0.39-0.59) and CTA-AP ASPECTS (r = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.64-0.78). Interobserver agreement was higher for CTA-DP ASPECTS (k = 0.84). Good CTA-DP ASPECTS was an independent predictor of favorable outcome (odds ratio, 8.71; 95% CI, 3.71-17.3; p < 0.001).CTA-DP ASPECTS is a reliable predictor of final infarction core and neurological outcome."
https://openalex.org/W3088445384,"The majority of existing studies find that Chinese residents would like to send children to study abroad for higher education quality and multiple opportunities. Previous studies have paid little attention to the association of this issue with environmental degradation in recent years. Merging data on adults from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) in 2016 with data on children, this paper investigates the effect of environmental concern on the educational level at which Chinese residents are willing to send children to study abroad based on the ordered logit model and Heckman Probit Model (HPM). The results show that environmental concern predicted a positive attitude toward a willingness to send children to study abroad at a decreased schooling level after concerns about the Chinese education system and educational expectations for children and other sociodemographic factors were controlled for. The marginal effects of environmental concern on expectations of sending children to study abroad at different educational levels showed that increasing environmental concern leads to the probability of residents considering sending children to study abroad during junior college or below increasing, while it leads to the probability of residents considering sending their children to study abroad during undergraduate or higher education decreasing. The HPM further verified that environmental concern had a positive effect on residents’ willingness of sending their children to study during junior college or below. The study offers an important early step in the empirical testing of the relationship between Chinese residents’ environmental concern and the educational level at which they would consider sending children to study abroad."
https://openalex.org/W3088688848,"Background Viral infections in children and adolescents with malignancy are commonly encountered and have a significant impact on morbidity and mortality. Studies and epidemiological data regarding viral infections in children with cancer in developing countries are lacking. This retrospective cohort study aims to assess the burden of viral infections in children and adolescents with cancer, by assessing prevalence, risk factors, as well as morbidity and mortality of common viruses over a period of 8 years. Methods and findings Medical records of cancer patients treated at the Children Cancer Center of Lebanon were reviewed and 155 participants under the age of 21 were identified with at least one documented viral infection during the period from July 2009 to November 2017. This subset included 136 participants with active malignancy and 19 participants with a history of cancer who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT] and were in remission; the latter group was analyzed separately. Information regarding participant characteristics, hospital course, and complications were obtained. Associations between viral infections and certain factors were assessed. In the cohort, 64% were male, 81% were Lebanese. In participants with active malignancy, 90% received chemotherapy in the 6 months preceding the viral infection episode, 11% received radiotherapy. 51% of participants were neutropenic at the time of viral detection, and 77% were lymphopenic. 17% experienced a bacterial co-infection, and 3 experienced a viral co-infection. Among 162 viral infection episodes, clinically diagnosed skin infections, mainly herpes simplex virus type 1 and varicella-zoster virus, were the most common [44% of cases]. These were followed by laboratory-proven systemic herpes infections: cytomegalovirus [14%] and Epstein-Barr virus [6%]. Respiratory viruses: influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, accounted for 9% and 4%, respectively, whereas rotavirus represented 11% and BK virus represented 3% of cases. Acute lymphocytic leukemia was the most prevalent neoplasia [57%]. Fever was the most common presenting symptom [55%] and febrile neutropenia was the reason for admission in 24% of cases. The mean length of stay was significantly longer in participants with cytomegalovirus infections and significantly lower in rotavirus infection. Admission to the ICU occurred in 9%, complications in 8%, and mortality in 5%. Participants with viral infections post-HSCT were noted to have a significantly longer length of hospital stay compared to non-HSCT participants, with no other significant differences in clinical course and outcome. The study was limited by its retrospective nature and by the late introduction and underuse of multiplex PCR panels, which may have led to underdiagnosis of viral infections. Conclusions Viral infections were prevalent in our sample of cancer patients and may have contributed to morbidity and mortality. Newly available viral diagnostics are likely to vastly increase the number and scope of detectable viral infections in this population. Prospective studies using multiplex PCR technology with systematic testing of patients will be more helpful in defining the burden of viral infections. Furthermore, efforts at antimicrobial stewardship would benefit from the identification of viral causes of infection and limit the unnecessary use of antibiotics in the pediatric cancer population."
https://openalex.org/W3040024359,"We compare the Malliavin-Mancino and Cuchiero-Teichmann Fourier instantaneous estimators to investigate the impact of the Epps effect arising from asynchrony in the instantaneous estimates. We demonstrate the instantaneous Epps effect under a simulation setting and provide a simple method to ameliorate the effect. We find that using the previous tick interpolation in the Cuchiero-Teichmann estimator results in unstable estimates when dealing with asynchrony, while the ability to bypass the time domain with the Malliavin-Mancino estimator allows it to produce stable estimates and is therefore better suited for ultra-high frequency finance. An empirical analysis using Trade and Quote data from the Johannesburg Stock Exchange illustrates the instantaneous Epps effect and how the intraday correlation dynamics can vary between days for the same equity pair."
https://openalex.org/W3088689705,"Electronic circuits and systems employed in mission- and safety-critical applications such as space, aerospace, nuclear plants etc. tend to suffer from multiple faults due to radiation and other harsh external phenomena. To overcome single or multiple faults from affecting electronic circuits and systems, progressive module redundancy (PMR) has been suggested as a potential solution that recommends the use of different levels of redundancy for the vulnerable portions of a circuit or system depending upon their criticality. According to PMR, triple modular redundancy (TMR) can be used where a single fault is likely to occur and should be masked, and quintuple modular redundancy (QMR) can be used where double faults are likely to occur and should be masked. In this article, we present asynchronous QDI majority voter designs for QMR and state which are preferable from cycle time (i.e., speed), area, power, and energy perspectives. Towards this, we implemented example QMR circuits in a robust QDI asynchronous design style by employing a delay insensitive dual rail code for data encoding and adopting four-phase handshake protocols for data communication. Based on physical implementations using a 32/28nm CMOS process, we find that our proposed QMR majority voter achieves improved optimization in speed and energy."

https://openalex.org/W3088375575,"To develop and validate a 4-item child oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) instrument that might be more amenable for uptake in large scale, multifaceted surveys of children's health and wellbeing than current, longer-form child OHRQoL instruments.Data were obtained from a study of the South Australian School Dental Service population designed to investigate OHRQoL among school children aged 8-13 years in 2002-2003. The Child Perception Questionnaire (CPQ8-10 and CPQ11-14) was utilised, which comprises 25 & 37 items representing four conceptual domains: oral symptoms, functional limitations, emotional wellbeing and social wellbeing. Initially, the psychometric properties of the short form 8-item CPQ were tested in both age groups using Confirmatory Factor Analysis. The rationale was that, if the 8-item CPQ8-10 and CPQ11-14 did not display good psychometric properties, there was no reason to proceed with further shortening into 4-item versions. Following a good fit of the 8-item CPQ, items with higher factor loadings in each domain were maintained and tested in the development of a 4-item CPQ. Exploratory Factor Analysis was conducted to determine dimensionality, followed by tests for reliability and validity. Model fits were assessed using Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR).There were 308 children aged 8-10 years who completed CPQ8-10 and 461 children aged 11-13 years who completed CPQ11-14. For the short-form 8-item instrument, satisfactory goodness of fit was demonstrated for the two age groups, with acceptable thresholds for RMSEA, CFI, and SRMR. The four items with the highest factor loading in each domain were the same for the 8-item CPQ8-10 and CPQ11-14. and these items were selected to comprise the 4-item CPQ8-10 and CPQ11-14. The 4-item short form displayed good criterion validity, with expected score patterns found in the majority of the known groups evaluated.We developed short-form 4-item CPQ8-10 and CPQ11-14 instruments that were tested in a large convenience sample of South Australian school children. The instruments demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity. Implications for practice are discussed."
