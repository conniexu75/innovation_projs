https://openalex.org/W2891521436,"Stem cell regulation and hierarchical organization of human skeletal progenitors remain largely unexplored. Here, we report the isolation of a self-renewing and multipotent human skeletal stem cell (hSSC) that generates progenitors of bone, cartilage, and stroma, but not fat. Self-renewing and multipotent hSSCs are present in fetal and adult bones and can also be derived from BMP2-treated human adipose stroma (B-HAS) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Gene expression analysis of individual hSSCs reveals overall similarity between hSSCs obtained from different sources and partially explains skewed differentiation toward cartilage in fetal and iPSC-derived hSSCs. hSSCs undergo local expansion in response to acute skeletal injury. In addition, hSSC-derived stroma can maintain human hematopoietic stem cells (hHSCs) in serum-free culture conditions. Finally, we combine gene expression and epigenetic data of mouse skeletal stem cells (mSSCs) and hSSCs to identify evolutionarily conserved and divergent pathways driving SSC-mediated skeletogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2798809372,"CRISPR-Cas endonucleases directed against foreign nucleic acids mediate prokaryotic adaptive immunity and have been tailored for broad genetic engineering applications. Type VI-D CRISPR systems contain the smallest known family of single effector Cas enzymes, and their signature Cas13d ribonuclease employs guide RNAs to cleave matching target RNAs. To understand the molecular basis for Cas13d function and explain its compact molecular architecture, we resolved cryoelectron microscopy structures of Cas13d-guide RNA binary complex and Cas13d-guide-target RNA ternary complex to 3.4 and 3.3 Å resolution, respectively. Furthermore, a 6.5 Å reconstruction of apo Cas13d combined with hydrogen-deuterium exchange revealed conformational dynamics that have implications for RNA scanning. These structures, together with biochemical and cellular characterization, provide insights into its RNA-guided, RNA-targeting mechanism and delineate a blueprint for the rational design of improved transcriptome engineering technologies."
https://openalex.org/W2889917760,"The aim of this study was to isolate, characterize and use phosphate solubilizing bacteria to enhance the bioavailability of insoluble Ca-phosphate for wheat plants. For this purpose, 15 phosphorus solubilizing bacteria (PSB) were isolated from wheat rhizospheric soils of Peshawar and southern Punjab region, Pakistan. These isolates were identified using light microscopy and 16S rRNA gene. Among the isolated bacteria, two strains (Pseudomonas sp. MS16 and Enterobacter sp. MS32) were the efficient P solubilizers based on their P solubilization activity determined qualitatively (solubilization index 3.2-5.8) as well as quantitatively (136-280 μg mL-1). These two strains produced indole-3-acetic acid (25.6-28.1 μg mL-1), gibberellic acid (2.5-11.8), solubilized zinc compounds (SI 2.8-3.3) and showed nitrogenase and 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase activity in vitro. Phosphate solubilization activity of Pseudomonas sp. MS16 was further validated by amplification, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of glucose dehydrogenase (gcd) gene (LT908484) responsible for P solubilization. Response Surface Methodology for large-scale production was used to find optimal conditions (Temperature 22.5°C, pH 7) for P solubilization. Glucose was found to support higher P solubilization in vitro. In an in vitro experiment, PSB treated wheat seedlings improved germination and seedling vigor (11% increases) as compared to un-inoculated control. Rhizoscanning of these seedlings showed an increase in various root growth parameters. Wheat inoculation with selected strain MS16 showed pronounced effect on grain yield in pot (38.5% increase) and field (17-18% increase) experiments compared to non-inoculated control. Root colonization by PSB through Florescent in situ Hybridization and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy confirmed their rhizosphere competence in soil. BOX-PCR confirmed the re-isolated colonies of Pseudomonas sp. MS16. The results indicated that gluconic acid producing Pseudomonas sp. MS16 from un-explored soils may be cost effective and environment friendly candidate to improve plant growth and phosphorous uptake by wheat plants."

We developed a sensitive method to monitor personal airborne biological and chemical exposures and followed the personal exposomes of 15 individuals for up to 890 days and over 66 distinct geographical locations. We found that individuals are potentially exposed to thousands of pan-domain species and chemical compounds, including insecticides and carcinogens. Personal biological and chemical exposomes are highly dynamic and vary spatiotemporally, even for individuals located in the same general geographical region. Integrated analysis of biological and chemical exposomes revealed strong location-dependent relationships. Finally, construction of an exposome interaction network demonstrated the presence of distinct yet interconnected human- and environment-centric clouds, comprised of interacting ecosystems such as human, flora, pets, and arthropods. Overall, we demonstrate that human exposomes are diverse, dynamic, spatiotemporally-driven interaction networks with the potential to impact human health."
https://openalex.org/W2892030326,"Most high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) patients develop resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy and recur, but 15% remain disease free over a decade. To discover drivers of long-term survival, we quantitatively analyzed the proteomes of platinum-resistant and -sensitive HGSOC patients from minute amounts of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors. This revealed cancer/testis antigen 45 (CT45) as an independent prognostic factor associated with a doubling of disease-free survival in advanced-stage HGSOC. Phospho- and interaction proteomics tied CT45 to DNA damage pathways through direct interaction with the PP4 phosphatase complex. In vitro, CT45 regulated PP4 activity, and its high expression led to increased DNA damage and platinum sensitivity. CT45-derived HLA class I peptides, identified by immunopeptidomics, activate patient-derived cytotoxic T cells and promote tumor cell killing. This study highlights the power of clinical cancer proteomics to identify targets for chemo- and immunotherapy and illuminate their biological roles."

The esophagus actively facilitates the passing of food from the oral cavity and pharynx to the stomach. It consists of a stratified squamous epithelium, muscle layers, and an enteric nervous system to sense stretch and control peristalsis. Congenital diseases such as esophageal atresia are caused by gene mutations that result in luminal narrowing or discontinuity. Other diseases affect the esophagus later in life, such as esophageal carcinoma, eosinophilic esophagitis, achalasia, and other motility disorders. There are substantial differences in tissue architecture between mouse and human esophagus, emphasizing the importance of having human esophageal tissue models for research. Human tissue organoids, differentiated from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) or obtained directly from organs, have proven to be excellent models of tissue physiology and pathology (McCauley and Wells, 2017McCauley H.A. Wells J.M. Pluripotent stem cell-derived organoids: using principles of developmental biology to grow human tissues in a dish.Development. 2017; 144: 958-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In general, the process of converting PSCs into organ cell types relies on stepwise differentiation that recapitulates organogenesis, including formation of the definitive endoderm (DE); anterior-posterior patterning into foregut, midgut, and hindgut; organ specification, and differentiation into organ specific lineages. This approach has been used to generate human anterior and posterior endoderm organoids, including respiratory, gastric, small intestine, and colon (Chen et al., 2017Chen Y.-W.

However, human-PSC-derived esophageal tissues have not been reported. Dual bone morphogenic protein (BMP) and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) inhibition after DE induction generates anterior foregut (AFG); however, this yielded a mix of tissues including pharyngeal, esophageal, and respiratory endoderm (Green et al., 2011Green M.D. Chen A.

This suggests that a more refined patterning approach based on pathways that control esophageal development is required to direct differentiation of PSCs specifically into esophagus. Several signaling pathways guide differentiation and morphogenesis of the developing esophagus. The esophageal epithelium derives from the DE, a 2-dimensional sheet of cells that forms during gastrulation (Zorn and Wells, 2007Zorn A.M. Wells J.M. Molecular basis of vertebrate endoderm development.Int. Rev. Cytol. 2007; 259: 49-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The DE then is patterned along the anterior-posterior axis by Wnt, BMP, and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling and forms a primitive gut tube, divided broadly into the foregut, midgut, and hindgut (Dessimoz et al., 2006Dessimoz J. Opoka R. Kordich J.J. Grapin-Botton A. Wells J.M. FGF signaling is necessary for establishing gut tube domains along the anterior-posterior axis in vivo.Mech.

The foregut is further patterned into posterior foregut by retinoic acid (RA) (Bayha et al., 2009Bayha E. Jørgensen M.C. Serup P. Grapin-Botton A. Retinoic acid signaling organizes endodermal organ specification along the entire antero-posterior axis.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e5845Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, Niederreither et al., 1999Niederreither K.

The AFG gives rise to the esophagus and respiratory tract. Respiratory specification in response to Wnt and BMP activation results in expression of the transcription factor Nkx2-1, whereas inhibition of BMP in the dorsal foregut promotes development of Sox2-expressing esophageal epithelium (Domyan et al., 2011Domyan E.T.

The esophagus starts as a simple cuboidal epithelium but develops into a stratified squamous epithelium that expresses multiple keratin proteins and a basal layer that expresses Sox2 and p63 (Rosekrans et al., 2015Rosekrans S.L. Baan B. Muncan V. van den Brink G.R. Esophageal development and epithelial homeostasis.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest.

Development and stem cells of the esophagus.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2017; 66: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Here, we temporally manipulated the above signaling pathways to differentiate human PSCs into esophageal organoids. Following DE formation, we identified that precise temporal manipulation of BMP, Wnt, and RA pathways direct formation of AFG spheroids. Consistent with in vivo data, AFG spheroids acquired a respiratory fate through activation of Wnt and BMP pathways, whereas BMP inhibition promoted formation of dorsal foregut spheroids that upon continued growth for 1–2 months formed human esophageal organoids (HEOs). HEOs contained stratified squamous epithelium, with distinct basal and luminal cell layers, and harbored proliferative esophageal progenitors that could be expanded and differentiated into esophageal epithelium in organotypic raft cultures. We used HEOs, in parallel with mouse embryos, to identify molecular pathways that are affected by SOX2 loss of function, one cause of esophageal atresia in humans and mice (Domyan et al., 2011Domyan E.T. Ferretti E. Throckmorton K. Mishina Y. Nicolis S.K. Sun X.

Multiple dose-dependent roles for Sox2 in the patterning and differentiation of anterior foregut endoderm.Development. 2007; 134: 2521-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). While reduced Sox2 function leads to esophageal atresia in mice, complete loss of Sox2 in mouse foregut endoderm results in esophageal agenesis. Loss of SOX2 function and transcriptional profiling of human and mouse foregut identified that SOX2 regulates the dorsal expression of Wnt antagonists such as SFRP2, suggesting that SOX2 represses the ability of Wnt to induce a respiratory fate in the dorsal foregut. In conclusion, HEOs provide a complementary platform to study human esophageal organogenesis, birth defects, and disease. To generate foregut derivatives, human PSCs were first induced into DE and then three-dimensional (3D) SOX2-expressing foregut spheroids as previously described (Figure 1) (D’Amour et al., 2005D’Amour K.A.

In attempting to generate esophageal organoids, the primary challenge was to generate foregut tissue of the correct regional identity. Endoderm patterning is regulated by differential BMP, Wnt, and RA signaling, where the highest levels of activation of these pathways promote a mid- and hindgut fate and lower levels promote a foregut fate (Bayha et al., 2009Bayha E. Jørgensen M.C. Serup P. Grapin-Botton A.

Retinoic acid regulates morphogenesis and patterning of posterior foregut derivatives.Dev. Biol. 2006; 297: 433-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Based on our previous studies indicating that the duration of signaling is critical for differentiation, we tested the effects of duration of Wnt activation during foregut spheroid formation on anterior-posterior identity (Spence et al., 2011Spence J.R. Mayhew C.N. Rankin S.A. Kuhar M.F. Vallance J.E. Tolle K. Hoskins E.E. Kalinichenko V.V. Wells S.I. Zorn A.M. et al.Directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into intestinal tissue in vitro.Nature. 2011; 470: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). We found that shorter duration of chiron, a canonical Wnt pathway activator (through GSK3β inhibition), or Wnt3a treatment following DE formation resulted in formation of AFG spheroids expressing HNF1β and SOX2, with low levels of posterior foregut markers PROX1 and HNF6 (Figures 1A–1E and S1A–S1G). HNF1β is not expressed in pharyngeal endoderm, indicating that AFG spheroids were not pharyngeal (Figures 1C–1E and S1B). CDX2, a mid/hindgut marker, is not expressed (Figures 1B, 1D, and 1E). From this, we concluded that the regional identity of these foregut spheroids (HNF1B+/SOX2+, PROX1−/HNF6−) are distal to the pharynx and proximal to the posterior foregut. Four days of RA treatment is also known to posteriorize foregut spheroids (McCracken et al., 2014McCracken K.W. Catá E.M. Crawford C.M. Sinagoga K.L. Schumacher M. Rockich B.E. Tsai Y.-H. Mayhew C.N. Spence J.R. Zavros Y. Wells J.M. Modelling human development and disease in pluripotent stem-cell-derived gastric organoids.Nature. 2014; 516: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), and loss of RA signaling results in abnormal development of posterior foregut organs (Bayha et al., 2009Bayha E. Jørgensen M.C. Serup P. Grapin-Botton A. Retinoic acid signaling organizes endodermal organ specification along the entire antero-posterior axis.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e5845Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2006Wang Z. Dollé P. Cardoso W.V. Niederreither K. Retinoic acid regulates morphogenesis and patterning of posterior foregut derivatives.Dev. Biol. 2006; 297: 433-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether shortening the duration of RA signaling in our foregut cultures would promote a more anterior fate. Foregut cultures treated with RA for 4 days express posterior foregut markers, GATA4 and PDX1, whereas 1 day of RA treatment resulted in spheroids that express TP63, a marker expressed in the developing esophagus (Figures 1F–1K and S1O–S1R). Cultures lacking RA, or containing 4-(diethylamino)benzaldehyde (DEAB), an aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor (blocking RA synthesis), yielded spheroids with minimal TP63 expression and increased levels of the pharyngeal markers PAX9 and OTX2 (Figures 1G–1K, S1F, S1G, and S1S–S1V). Together, our data suggest that brief activation of RA promotes foregut regional identity consistent with the presumptive esophageal domain. The presumptive esophageal and respiratory region of the foregut is patterned along the dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis, resulting in specification of the esophageal and respiratory fates, respectively. We predicted that AFG spheroids would respond to D-V patterning cues to acquire either an esophageal or respiratory fate. Studies in vertebrate embryos demonstrate that BMP and Wnt signaling promote a respiratory fate (NKX2-1+ SOX2−), while Noggin-mediated inhibition of BMP signaling in the dorsal foregut tube is required for esophageal development (Domyan et al., 2011Domyan E.T.

Thus, we treated day 6 AFG spheroids with either 3 days of chiron and BMP4 or alternatively with Noggin to inhibit BMP signaling (Figures 2A and 2B ). Treatment with chiron and BMP4 resulted in induction of NKX2-1 and repression of SOX2, whereas treatment with Noggin dorsalized spheroids, as marked by elevated levels of SOX2, MNX1, KRT4, and TP63 (Figures 2C–2I) (Daniely et al., 2004Daniely Y.

Dyn. 2009; 238: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Taken together, inhibition of BMP signaling in cultures of AFG spheroids promoted a dorsal AFG identity. To determine if dorsally patterned AFG spheroids were competent to grow into esophageal organoids, we cultured them suspended in Matrigel with epidermal growth factor (EGF) alone or in the context of manipulation of other pathways predicted to promote esophageal development including Wnt activation (chiron), extended BMP inhibition (Noggin), activation of hedgehog (SAG, a smoothened agonist), and FGF10. While most of these manipulations had no effect on growth (data not shown), we found that addition of FGF10 to cultures from day 6 to day 13 resulted in improved efficiency of spheroid to organoid outgrowth (Figures S4A–S4E) and did not affect the patterning and differentiation into esophageal organoids (data not shown). Next, we compared the morphologic and molecular development of putative HEOs to normal development of the embryonic mouse esophagus. During embryonic growth and development, the esophagus transitions from simple cuboidal epithelium at embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) to a multilayered or stratified epithelium between E14.5 and E17.5 (Figures 3G, 3J, 3M, 3P, S4F–S4O, and S4R) (Chen et al., 2012Chen H. Li J. Li H. Hu Y. Tevebaugh W. Yamamoto M. Que J. Chen X. Transcript profiling identifies dynamic gene expression patterns and an important role for Nrf2/Keap1 pathway in the developing mouse esophagus.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e36504Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Similarly, over the course of 1 month, HEOs expanded in size from ∼50 μm to 200–400 μm in diameter (Figures 3B–3F). Moreover, the organoid epithelium transitioned from a simple epithelium that was largely SOX2, p63 double positive to a multilayered epithelium expressing markers of esophageal stratified squamous epithelium (Figures S4H–S4Q and S4S). At 1 month, HEOs expressed basal markers p63 and KRT14 as well as the suprabasal marker KRT13 (Figures 3H, 3K, 3N, and 3Q). This expression pattern is similar to an E17.5 esophagus composed of multilayered epithelium (Figures 3G, 3J, 3M, and 3P). One-month HEOs were still relatively immature, as evidenced by broad SOX2 epithelial expression and expression of KRT8, a marker of immature esophagus (Figures 3J and S4L–S4M). We therefore extended the culture period out to 2 months, which resulted in additional growth and formation of a stratified epithelium that lacked KRT8. We observed robust expression of KRT14 throughout the basal layer and KRT13 and IVL throughout the differentiated suprabasal layers, demonstrating the presence of a stratified squamous epithelium (Figure 3I, 3L, 3O, and 3R). Histologically, 2 month HEOs had a more defined basal layer as well as squamous cells suprabasally, with no evidence of cornification (Figure 4A). The epithelial morphology of HEOs was easily distinguished from other organoids, including human gastric organoids (HGOs), human intestinal organoids (HIOs), or colonic organoids, with each organoid having an epithelial morphology that is unique to that organ type (McCracken et al., 2014McCracken K.W.

To show that HEOs were human esophageal epithelium, we compared 1- and 2-month HEOs to human esophageal biopsy specimens as well as 1-month HGOs and HIOs by qPCR. The key stratified squamous epithelial markers p63, KRT5, KRT13, IVL, and CRNN were expressed highest in human esophageal biopsy specimens and 2-month HEOs, whereas HGOs and HIOs negligibly expressed these transcripts (Figures 3S–3V). Additionally, we compared the entire transcriptome of HEOs with that of other human epithelial tissues isolated from esophagus, lung, skin, stomach, small intestine, colon, HGOs, and HIOs. Clustering analyses of RNA-sequencing data revealed that HEOs are most closely related to human esophagus and EPC2, an esophageal keratinocyte cell line, as opposed to the stomach, small intestine, and colon (Figure 3W). We used principal-component analyses to compare HEOs with HIOs and HGOs and found that even 1-month HEOs were entirely distinct from the other gastrointestinal organoids (Figure 3X). A comparison of markers of esophagus, skin, stomach, and colon revealed that HEOs were highly similar to human esophagus, reaffirming our qPCR analysis. While there was significant overlap between skin and esophagus, there were also distinct differences, including KRT1 in the skin and KRT4 and KRT13 in the esophagus. Of note, HEOs did not express the gastric or intestinal markers TFF2, CLDN18, GATA4, PDX1, CDX2, and CDH17 (Figure 3Y). Given that growth of PSC-derived organoids in vivo has been shown to promote further maturation and function, we utilized three different transplantation-based approaches to study HEOs in vivo. We first engrafted 1-month-old HEOs into the kidney capsule of immunodeficient (NOD Scid Gamma [NSG]) mice and allowed them to grow for 8 weeks, which resulted in maturation in a subset of the organoids transplanted (2 out of 5) (Figures S5A–S5F). We used two other transplantation approaches that were unsuccessful: (1) seeding HEOs onto biodegradable PEG scaffolds and transplanting them into the fat pad of mice or (2) engrafting HEOs into the forestomach of NSG mice (data not shown) (Dye et al., 2016Dye B.R.

https://openalex.org/W2889781076,"The decline of tissue regenerative potential with age correlates with impaired stem cell function. However, limited strategies are available for therapeutic modulation of stem cell function during aging. Using skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs) as a model system, we identify cell death by mitotic catastrophe as a cause of impaired stem cell proliferative expansion in aged animals. The mitotic cell death is caused by a deficiency in Notch activators in the microenvironment. We discover that ligand-dependent stimulation of Notch activates p53 in MuSCs via inhibition of Mdm2 expression through Hey transcription factors during normal muscle regeneration and that this pathway is impaired in aged animals. Pharmacologic activation of p53 promotes the expansion of aged MuSCs in vivo. Altogether, these findings illuminate a Notch-p53 signaling axis that plays an important role in MuSC survival during activation and is dysregulated during aging, contributing to the age-related decline in muscle regenerative potential."
https://openalex.org/W2891120171,"Polarized epithelia assemble into sheets that compartmentalize organs and generate tissue barriers by integrating apical surfaces into a single, unified structure. This tissue organization is shared across organs, species, and developmental stages. The processes that regulate development and maintenance of apical epithelial surfaces are, however, undefined. Here, using an intestinal epithelial-specific knockout (KO) mouse and cultured epithelial cells, we show that the tight junction scaffolding protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) is essential for development of unified apical surfaces in vivo and in vitro. We found that U5 and GuK domains of ZO-1 are necessary for proper apical surface assembly, including organization of microvilli and cortical F-actin; however, direct interactions with F-actin through the ZO-1 actin-binding region (ABR) are not required. ZO-1 lacking the PDZ1 domain, which binds claudins, rescued apical structure in ZO-1–deficient epithelia, but not in cells lacking both ZO-1 and ZO-2, suggesting that heterodimerization with ZO-2 restores PDZ1-dependent ZO-1 interactions that are vital to apical surface organization. Pharmacologic F-actin disruption, myosin II motor inhibition, or dynamin inactivation restored apical epithelial structure in vitro and in vivo, indicating that ZO-1 directs epithelial organization by regulating actomyosin contraction and membrane traffic. We conclude that multiple ZO-1–mediated interactions contribute to coordination of epithelial actomyosin function and genesis of unified apical surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2891468774,"Increased light scattering in the eye lens due to aggregation of the long-lived lens proteins, crystallins, is the cause of cataract disease. Several mutations in the gene encoding human γD-crystallin (HγD) cause misfolding and aggregation. Cataract-associated substitutions at Trp42 cause the protein to aggregate in vitro from a partially unfolded intermediate locked by an internal disulfide bridge, and proteomic evidence suggests a similar aggregation precursor is involved in age-onset cataract. Surprisingly, WT HγD can promote aggregation of the W42Q variant while itself remaining soluble. Here, a search for a biochemical mechanism for this interaction has revealed a previously unknown oxidoreductase activity in HγD. Using in vitro oxidation, mutational analysis, cysteine labeling, and MS, we have assigned this activity to a redox-active internal disulfide bond that is dynamically exchanged among HγD molecules. The W42Q variant acts as a disulfide sink, reducing oxidized WT and forming a distinct internal disulfide that kinetically traps the aggregation-prone intermediate. Our findings suggest a redox ""hot potato"" competition among WT and mutant or modified polypeptides wherein variants with the lowest kinetic stability are trapped in aggregation-prone intermediate states upon accepting disulfides from more stable variants. Such reactions may occur in other long-lived proteins that function in oxidizing environments. In these cases, aggregation may be forestalled by inhibiting disulfide flow toward mutant or damaged polypeptides."

The objective of this cross-sectional study was to compare in the French Dat'AIDS cohort, the HIV geriatric population, aged 75 years and over, to the elderly one, aged from 50 to 74 years. As of Dec 2015, 16,436 subjects (43.8% of the French Dat'AIDS cohort) were aged from 50 to 74 (elderly group) and 572 subjects (1.5%) were aged 75 and over (geriatric group). Durations of HIV infection and of ART were slightly but significantly different, median at 19 and 18 years, and 15 and 16 years in the elderly and geriatric group, respectively. The geriatric group was more frequently at CDC stage C and had a lower nadir CD4. This group had been more exposed to first generation protease inhibitors and thymidine analogues. Despite similar virologic suppression, type of ART at the last visit significantly differed between the 2 groups: triple ART in 74% versus 68.2%, ART ≥ 4 drugs in 4.7% versus 2.7%; dual therapy in 11.6% versus 16.4% in the elderly group and the geriatric group, respectively. In the geriatric group all co-morbidities were significantly more frequent, except dyslipidemia, 4.3% of the elderly group had ≥4 co-morbidities versus18.4% in the geriatric group. Despite more co-morbidities and more advanced HIV infection the geriatric population achieve similar high rate of virologic suppression than the elderly population. A multidisciplinary approach should be developed to face the incoming challenge of aging HIV population."
https://openalex.org/W2891417668,"The spiny lobster, Panulirus argus, has two classes of chemosensilla representing “olfaction” and “distributed chemoreception,” as is typical for decapod crustaceans. Olfactory sensilla are found exclusively on antennular lateral flagella and are innervated only by olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) that project into olfactory lobes organized into glomeruli in the brain. Distributed chemoreceptor sensilla are found on all body surfaces including the antennular lateral flagella (LF) and walking leg dactyls (dactyls), and are innervated by both chemoreceptor neurons (CRNs) and mechanoreceptor neurons that project into somatotopically organized neuropils. Here, we examined expression of three classes of chemosensory genes in transcriptomes of the LF (with ORNs and CRNs), dactyls (with only CRNs), and brain of P. argus: Ionotropic Receptors (IRs), which are related to ionotropic glutamate receptors and found in all protostomes including crustaceans; Gustatory Receptors (GRs), which are ionotropic receptors that are abundantly expressed in insects but more restricted in crustaceans; and Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels, a diverse set of sensor-channels that include several chemosensors in diverse animals. We identified 108 IRs, one GR, and 18 homologues representing all seven subfamilies of TRP channels. The number of IRs expressed in the LF is far greater than in dactyls, possibly reflecting the contribution of receptor proteins associated with the ORNs beyond those associated with CRNs. We found co-receptor IRs (IR8a, IR25a, IR76b, IR93a) and conserved IRs (IR21a, IR40a) in addition to the numerous divergent IRs in the LF, dactyl, and brain. Immunocytochemistry showed that IR25a is expressed in ORNs, CRNs, and a specific type of cell located in the brain near the olfactory lobes. While the function of IRs, TRP channels, and the GR was not explored, our results suggest that P. argus has an abundance of diverse putative chemoreceptor proteins that it may use in chemoreception."

The sequence variants were rated according to American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines.In total, 48 pathogenic, 7 likely pathogenic and 57 variants of uncertain significance were identified in 92/243 patients (37.9%), while 4 variants of uncertain significance were found in 4/56 control subjects (7.1%). 13.1% (12/92) of the cases showed variants in 'thyroid dysgenesis' (TD) genes: TSHR, n = 6; NKX2-1, n = 2; NKX2-5, n = 1; PAX8, n = 3. The variants in 'dyshormonogenesis' (DH) genes were found in 84.8% (78/92) of cases: TPO, n = 30; DUOX2, n = 24; TG, n = 8; SLC5A5, n = 3; SLC26A4, n = 6; IYD, n = 1. 8 patients showed oligonenic variants. The majority of variants identified in DH genes were monoallelic.In contrast to earlier studies demonstrating the predominance of TD in severe CH, the majority of variants identified in our study were in DH genes. A large proportion of monoallelic variants detected among DH genes suggests that non-mendelian mechanisms may play a role in the development of CH."

There is a paucity of studies investigating survival including persons with cognitive decline and dementia of various aetiologies. Objectives We aimed to compare survival for patients with subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, mixed Alzheimer’s/vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies/Parkinson’s disease, and other dementias compared to the general Norwegian population, taking into account the role of gender, cognitive function, function in everyday activities, comorbidity and education. Methods Patients (N = 4682), ≥65 years, in the The Norwegian register of persons assessed for cognitive symptoms (NorCog) during 2009–2017 were followed for mortality in the National Registry until January 2018. Flexible parametric survival models were applied to estimate relative survival, life expectancy and years of life lost for diagnostic groups compared with the general population. Results Patients with vascular dementia or dementia with Lewy bodies/Parkinson’s had the shortest survival, followed by mixed dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, unspecified dementia, mild cognitive impairment and subjective cognitive decline. At age 70 years, men with vascular dementia or dementia with Lewy bodies/Parkinson’s had life expectancy of 4.7 years, which corresponded to 10.3 years of life lost compared to the general population. Years of life lost for other diagnoses were 10.0 years for mixed dementia, 9.2 years for Alzheimer’s disease, 9.3 years for other dementias, 5.2 years for mild cognitive impairment and 2.2 years for subjective cognitive decline. Corresponding years of life lost in women were: 12.7 years, 10.5 years, 9.8 years, 10.6 years, 7.8 years, and 2.6 years. Poor relative survival among dementia patients was associated with male gender, comorbidity, low cognitive function, and low function in activities of daily living. Conclusions Compared with the general population, patients with subjective cognitive decline had no significant loss in life expectancy, while patients with mild cognitive impairment and all dementia subtypes had large losses, especially those with a diagnosis of vascular dementia or dementia with Lewy bodies/Parkinson’s."
https://openalex.org/W2892916393,"The intracellular deposition of fibrils composed of the microtubule-associated protein Tau is a characteristic feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other fatal neurodegenerative disorders collectively known as tauopathies. Short Tau fibrils spread intracerebrally through transfer between interconnected neurons. Once taken up by a recipient cell, Tau fibrils recruit Tau monomers onto their ends. Based on the number of microtubule-binding repeats, there are two distinct groups of Tau isoforms: three-repeat (3R) Tau and four-repeat (4R) Tau. In AD, all Tau isoforms are deposited, whereas in other tauopathies, only 3R or 4R Tau isoforms are deposited. The molecular basis for these isoform-specific depositions is poorly understood, although conformation-based cross-seeding barriers are key. Here, we used sedimentation assays, EPR spectroscopy, and other structural readouts to better understand the cross-seeding barriers of 4R Tau fibrils. We observed that fibrils formed from truncated Tau (K18), but not full-length Tau (htau40), exhibit a barrier that inhibits 3R Tau recruitment. Investigating an array of differently sized fragments, we found that the Tau C terminus modulates the cross-seeding barrier and that the N terminus plays a synergistic role. Two disease-associated Tau variants, P301S and P301L, also established strong cross-seeding barriers. EPR analysis indicated that fibrils seeded with truncated and mutated Tau, but not htau40, are structurally disordered in the second half of repeat four and onward.

In the adult human brain, six different Tau isoforms are expressed, ranging in size from 352 to 441 amino acids (18Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A.

These isoforms vary by the inclusion or exclusion of one or two inserts in the N terminus and the presence or absence of the second of four semiconserved microtubule-binding repeats in the C terminus. Latter distinction results in three isoforms with three repeats (3R) and another three isoforms with four repeats (4R). The isoforms from each group are expressed at similar levels (19Goedert M.

Tau fibrils are characterized by a cross–β-fold, in which β-strands run perpendicular to the long fibril axis (24Berriman J. Serpell L.C. Oberg K.A. Fink A.L. Goedert M. Crowther R.A. Tau filaments from human brain and from in vitro assembly of recombinant protein show cross-β structure.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The cryo-EM structure of paired helical and straight filaments from AD (26Fitzpatrick A.W.P. Falcon B. He S. Murzin A.G. Murshudov G. Garringer H.J. Crowther R.A. Ghetti B. Goedert M. Scheres S.H.W.

The fully matching core residues between 3R and 4R Tau in these filaments offer an explanation for the co-recruitment of all isoforms (26Fitzpatrick A.W.P. Falcon B. He S. Murzin A.G. Murshudov G. Garringer H.J. Crowther R.A. Ghetti B. Goedert M. Scheres S.H.W.

The recently solved structure of Tau filaments from PID demonstrates a fold distinct from that observed in AD. The filaments are composed of only 3R Tau isoforms with a core (residues 254–378) of four cross–β-packed stacks, but no β-helical arrangement. The ordered core is larger than that of AD filaments because it also includes residues from the first microtubule-binding repeat. Structural incompatibilities with residues in the second repeat of 4R Tau offer an explanation for the selective recruitment of 3R Tau into these filaments (27Falcon B. Zhang W. Murzin A.G. Murshudov G. Garringer H.J. Vidal R. Crowther R.A. Ghetti B. Scheres S.H.W. Goedert M.

Currently, there are no 4R Tau filaments solved to atomic resolution. Although preferential deposition of 4R Tau is observed in a number of different diseases, it is unknown whether these fibrils vary in conformation. Utilizing the 4R Tau construct K18 (28Gustke N. Trinczek B. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Domains of Tau protein and interactions with microtubules.Biochemistry. 1994; 33 (8068626): 9511-952210.1021/bi00198a017Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), which comprises residues 244–372, we identified a seeding barrier that prevents the growth of 3R Tau (29Dinkel P.D. Siddiqua A. Huynh H. Shah M. Margittai M. Variations in filament conformation dictate seeding barrier between three- and four-repeat Tau.Biochemistry. 2011; 50 (21510682): 4330-433610.1021/bi2004685Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This barrier was ascribed to conformational heterogeneity in the fibril populations (30Yu X. Luo Y. Dinkel P. Zheng J. Wei G. Margittai M. Nussinov R. Ma B. Cross-seeding and conformational selection between three- and four-repeat human Tau proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287 (22393063): 14950-1495910.1074/jbc.M112.340794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Because the core region of filaments from AD extends six residues beyond the length of K18, the question arises whether residues outside the sequence of K18 influence the seeding properties of Tau fibrils. In this study we evaluated the effects of 4R Tau’s N-terminal and C-terminal regions on seeding, assessed the conformational consequences of mutations, and determined structural features in the core of different 4R Tau filaments that prevent 3R Tau growth. The findings have important implications for the spreading of Tau pathology in 4R tauopathies. In a first set of experiments, we sought to determine the seeding properties of htau40 (largest isoform, 4R Tau) (18Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A. Multiple isoforms of human microtubule-associated protein Tau: sequences and localization in neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer's disease.Neuron. 1989; 3 (2484340): 519-52610.1016/0896-6273(89)90210-9Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar). For this purpose, monomeric htau40 was incubated for 8 days at 37 °C with heparin as an inducer. The fibrils were then sheared for 30 s with a tip sonicator to produce seeds. The breakage of long, unbranched fibrils into short fibrillar species was visualized by negative stain transmission EM (TEM) (Fig. 1, A and B). Tau seeds had an average length of 39 nm (Fig. 1C). The seeds remained in the supernatant when centrifuged at 130,000 × g, different from unsonicated fibrils, which were found in the pellet (Fig. 1D). To test the ability of htau40 seeds to recruit Tau monomers, 10% seeds were mixed with either htau40 or htau23 (shortest isoform, 3R Tau) (18Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A. Multiple isoforms of human microtubule-associated protein Tau: sequences and localization in neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer's disease.Neuron. 1989; 3 (2484340): 519-52610.1016/0896-6273(89)90210-9Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar) monomers and allowed to grow for 20–24 h. Fig. 2 provides a schematic depiction of these isoforms. Remarkably not only htau40 but also htau23 was incorporated into the fibrils. Both proteins were exclusively found in the pellets (Fig. 1E). Notice that htau40 seeds appeared in the pellet when incubated with htau23 monomers. We ascribe this characteristic to the extension of the originally short seeds to elongated sedimentable fibrils. The seeding properties of htau40 fibrils were highly reproducible as judged by the combined data of >40 biological replicates for each reaction (Fig. 1F). To examine the kinetics of Tau fibril elongation, we next employed a widely used thioflavin T (ThT) assay that is based on the characteristic fluorescence changes of this dye (31Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Fluorometric determination of amyloid fibrils in vitro using the fluorescent dye, thioflavin T1.Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177 (2729542): 244-24910.1016/0003-2697(89)90046-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). Conversion of Tau monomers into fibrils results in an increase in ThT fluorescence because of binding of the dye to the fibril core. Both htau23 and htau40 exhibited similar elongation kinetics when added to htau40 seeds (Fig. 1G). The differences in fluorescence intensity are likely due to differences in dye incorporation. When the two Tau monomers were incubated under identical conditions, but in the absence of seeds, no changes in fluorescence intensity were observed (Fig. 1G), suggesting that these proteins remained largely monomeric, in agreement with previous observations (32Meyer V. Dinkel P.D. Rickman Hager E. Margittai M. Amplification of Tau fibrils from minute quantities of seeds.Biochemistry. 2014; 53 (25153692): 5804-580910.1021/bi501050gCrossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The fibrillar nature of aggregates that formed upon seeding was confirmed by TEM (Fig. 1H).Figure 2Schematic diagram of htau23, htau40, and truncated variants of htau40. Repeats 1–4 (R1–R4) are shaded. N-terminal inserts are striped. The horizontal bars in htau23 represent regions that are missing in this isoform.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because previous experiments with K18 fibrils were performed at 25 °C and utilized protein constructs in which the native cysteines were replaced by serines (29Dinkel P.D. Siddiqua A. Huynh H. Shah M. Margittai M. Variations in filament conformation dictate seeding barrier between three- and four-repeat Tau.Biochemistry. 2011; 50 (21510682): 4330-433610.1021/bi2004685Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we next asked whether these variations could be responsible for the difference in seeding properties between full-length versus truncated Tau. The aggregation experiments were repeated under new conditions. Sedimentation revealed that neither a change in temperature (Fig. S1A) nor a substitution of cysteines (Fig. S1B) or a simultaneous change in both parameters (Fig. S1C) altered the seeding characteristics of full-length Tau. In all cases htau23 was robustly recruited onto the seeds. Collectively, the results suggest that truncations in 4R Tau alter the fibril structure and thereby affect its cross-seeding properties with 3R Tau. To identify which regions are responsible for altering the seeding properties of 4R Tau, we next generated 11 different Tau variants with truncations at either the N or C terminus or both (Fig. 2). Proteins with truncations at a single end were assessed first. N-terminal truncations included variants 151–441 and 244–441. C-terminal truncations encompassed variants 1–421, 1–391, and 1–372. Fibril formation, seed generation, and growth were carried out as before using short fibrils composed of Tau variants as seeds and full-length Tau monomers for growth. Sedimentation revealed that neither of the two truncations at the N terminus resulted in a barrier that prevented htau23 from growing onto the seeds. In both cases htau23 was found in the fibril containing pellet (Fig. 3, A and B). When the seeding properties of fibrils composed of C-terminally truncated Tau were assessed (Fig. 3, C–E), only fibrils composed of the 1–372 variant showed a significant barrier toward htau23 recruitment (Fig. 3E). Importantly, in all cases recruitment of htau40 was unperturbed. Together, the results suggest that the C-terminal region in Tau affects seeding competency. To better understand the structural implications of C-terminal truncations and to test for potential synergism between the N- and C-terminal regions, we next investigated the seeding properties of Tau variants in which the N terminus was removed and the C terminus was systematically shortened. Specifically, fibrils of the following 4R Tau variants were examined: 244–421, 244–391, 244–384, 244–378, 244–372, and 244–368 (Fig. 2). As before, seeding efficiency was assessed by comparing the protein contents in pellets versus supernatants. All seeds effectively recruited htau40. After sedimentation only marginal quantities of protein were detected in the supernatants (Fig. 4). Recruitment of htau23 depended on the type of 4R Tau variant in the seeds, with shorter variants resulting in successively diminished growth. The largest barrier was observed for seeds composed of variant 244–368, which only comprises the repeat region. It is noticeable that any truncation at the C terminus resulted in reduced growth. Even seeds composed of 244–421 and 244–391 showed diminished recruitment of htau23, whereas similar seeds with intact N terminus did not exhibit any barrier (Fig. 3). Combined, the results suggest that the C-terminal region of htau40 affects its cross-seeding properties with htau23 and that the N-terminal region plays a synergistic role. The investigations thus far focused on the effects of truncations on seeding competency. Next, we asked whether familial mutations in htau40 could produce similar seeding barriers as the C-terminal truncations. Of particular interest were the P301S and P301L mutations, because they are known to cause little or no changes in the 3R/4R Tau isoform ratios yet are observed to mimic tauopathies with preferential deposition of 4R Tau (1Lee V.M. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Neurodegenerative tauopathies.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24 (11520930): 1121-115910.1146/annurev.neuro.24.1.1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar). P301S and P301L mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using htau40 as a template. The purified protein variants were allowed to form fibrils as described for WT htau40 above and fractured by sonication. Growth of WT htau40 and htau23 monomers onto mutant seeds was assessed using sedimentation. Both P301S and P301L seeds competently recruited htau40 monomers into the fibril. After centrifugation, the majority of htau40 was found in the insoluble pellets (Fig. 5, left panels). The same mutant seeds were unable to recruit htau23. In this case, the majority of protein remained in the supernatant (Fig. 5, left panels). The results were highly reproducible with htau40 exhibiting >80% growth onto both mutant seeds and htau23 monomers exhibiting <15% growth (Fig. 5, right panels). To assess the kinetics of fibril elongation, we next monitored the changes in ThT fluorescence that occurred when htau23 and htau40 monomers were mixed with either P301S or P301L seeds (Fig. 6, A and B). Consistent with the sedimentation data, only htau40 was recruited onto the seeds, htau23 was not. The t½ values for htau40 growth onto P301S and P301L seeds were 60 and 68 min, respectively. Notably, homotypic recruitment of P301S and P301L monomers onto their respective seeds was even more efficient (>90%) and faster (t½ = 5–9 min) than heterotypic recruitment of htau40 (Fig. S2), in agreement with previous studies that suggested preferential growth of mutant over WT Tau (12Sanders D.W.

To obtain visual confirmation for the recruitment of WT Tau onto mutant seeds, we next collected TEM images of negatively stained samples (Fig. 6, C and D). Whereas htau40 formed long, unbranched fibrils, no fibrils were observed in the case of htau23. Collectively, the data indicate that single substitutions at position 301 are sufficient to produce fibrils with cross-seeding barriers similar to those observed for truncated Tau. Pro-301 is located in a region of Tau that is important for aggregation. Notably, the PHF6 motif comprising residues 306–311 has been implicated in fibril nucleation (36von Bergen M. Friedhoff P. Biernat J. Heberle J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Assembly of Tau protein into Alzheimer paired helical filaments depends on a local sequence motif (306VQIVYK311) forming β structure.Proc. Natl.

To determine whether sequence alterations in the region flanking Pro-301 could alter the seeding specificity of htau40 fibrils, we generated six new htau40 variants. Three of the variants contained familial mutations in the immediate vicinity of Pro-301 (ΔN296, G303V, and S305N). These mutations have been observed to cause 4R tauopathies (37Pastor P. Pastor E.

HPLC-based resolution of intracellular phosphoinositides (PIs) revealed that apilimod triggered a marked reduction of both lipids in the context of intact cells. Notably, there was also a profound rise in PtdIns3P resulting from arrested PtdIns3P consumption for PtdIns(3,5)P2 synthesis. As typical for PIKfyve inhibition and the concomitant PtdIns(3,5)P2 reduction, apilimod induced the appearance of dilated endomembrane structures in the form of large translucent cytoplasmic vacuoles. Remarkably, bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) fully reversed the aberrant cell phenotype back to normal and completely precluded the appearance of cytoplasmic vacuoles when added prior to apilimod. Inspection of the PI profiles ruled out restoration of the reduced PtdIns(3,5)P2 pool as a molecular mechanism underlying BafA1 rescue. Rather, we found that BafA1 markedly attenuated the PtdIns3P elevation under PIKfyve inhibition. This was accompanied by profoundly decreased endosomal recruitment of fusogenic EEA1. Together, our data demonstrate that apilimod inhibits not only PtdIns(3,5)P2 but also PtdIns5P synthesis and that the cytoplasmic vacuolization triggered by the inhibitor is precluded or reversed by BafA1 through a mechanism associated, in part, with reduction in both PtdIns3P levels and EEA1 membrane recruitment."
https://openalex.org/W2890509655,"The Prenatal Assessment of Genome and Exomes (PAGE) project is a UK-wide study aiming to gain a better understanding of genetic variants causing developmental problems during pregnancy. A further aim of the study is to provide an evidence-base for the introduction of prenatal whole genome and exome sequencing (PWGES) into prenatal diagnostics provided by the NHS, which is expected in 2018. This paper presents the findings of a qualitative interview study undertaken with 20 health professionals and researchers involved in the PAGE project, and explores their implications for understandings of ‘good practice’ in the uses of prenatal genomics clinically. A number of critical issues are identified that will need to be addressed in the development of a model of good ethical practice for prenatal genomics: consent, management of expectations, return of results, and professional duties in the context of PWGES. The analysis presented identifies and illustrates a great deal of complexity and qualitative richness in these issues as they arise in the day-to-day work of genomics professionals. Inclusive, critical discussion of these findings, together with the findings from other empirical studies, normative analysis and scientific discoveries resulting from PAGE, will be required to inform the development of appropriate guidelines of good ethical practice that address the needs and concerns to be encountered in daily clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2892338167,"Sphingolipids, including sphingomyelin (SM) and glucosylceramide (GlcCer), are generated by the addition of a polar head group to ceramide (Cer). Sphingomyelin synthase 1 (SMS1) and glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) are key enzymes that catalyze the conversion of Cer to SM and GlcCer, respectively. GlcCer synthesis has been postulated to occur mainly in cis-Golgi, and SM synthesis is thought to occur in medial/trans-Golgi; however, SMS1 and GCS are known to partially co-localize in cisternae, especially in medial/trans-Golgi. Here, we report that SMS1 and GCS can form a heteromeric complex, in which the N terminus of SMS1 and the C terminus of GCS are in close proximity. Deletion of the N-terminal sterile α-motif of SMS1 reduced the stability of the SMS1–GCS complex, resulting in a significant reduction in SM synthesis in vivo. In contrast, chemical-induced heterodimerization augmented SMS1 activity, depending on an increase in the amount and stability of the complex. Fusion of the SMS1 N terminus to the GCS C terminus via linkers of different lengths increased SM synthesis and decreased GlcCer synthesis in vivo. These results suggest that formation of the SMS1–GCS heteromeric complex increases SM synthesis and decreases GlcCer synthesis. Importantly, this regulation of relative Cer levels by the SMS1–GCS complex was confirmed by CRISPR/Cas9–mediated knockout of SMS1 or GCS combined with pharmacological inhibition of Cer transport protein in HEK293T cells. Our findings suggest that complex formation between SMS1 and GCS is part of a critical mechanism controlling the metabolic fate of Cer in the Golgi."
https://openalex.org/W2889620627,"Recent evidence indicates the presence of macrophage subpopulations that express the TCRαβ in chronic inflammatory diseases such as tuberculosis and atherosclerosis and in the tumor microenvironment. Here, we demonstrate that a second subpopulation of macrophages expresses rearranged heavy and light chain immunoglobulins. We identify immunoglobulin expression in human and murine monocytes, in ex vivo differentiated macrophages and macrophages from the tumor microenvironment of five randomly selected distinct human tumor entities. The immunoglobulin heavy and light chains are expressed in a small macrophage subfraction (~3-5%) as combinatorial and individual-specific immune receptors. Using Sanger sequencing and deep sequencing, we routinely find markedly restricted Ig repertoires in monocytes/macrophages compared to normal B cells. Furthermore, we report the complete Ig heavy and light chain sequences of a fully functional immunoglobulin from a single tumor-associated macrophage. These results demonstrate that Ig expression is a defining feature of monocytes and also macrophages in the tumor microenvironment and thus reveal an as yet unrecognized modus operandi of host defense in professional phagocytes."

This is particularly true for public health programs focused on delivering services at the household level, such as indoor residual spraying with insecticide to help prevent malaria. While open source data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) depicting the locations and shapes of buildings is rapidly improving in terms of quality and completeness globally, even in settings where all buildings have been mapped, information on whether these buildings are residential, commercial or another type is often only available for a small subset. Using OSM building data from Botswana and Swaziland, we identified buildings for which 'type' was indicated, generated via on the ground observations, and classified these into two classes, ""sprayable"" and ""not-sprayable"". Ensemble machine learning, using building characteristics such as size, shape and proximity to neighbouring features, was then used to form a model to predict which of these 2 classes every building in these two countries fell into. Results show that an ensemble machine learning approach performed marginally, but statistically, better than the best individual model and that using this ensemble model we were able to correctly classify >86% (using independent test data) of structures correctly as sprayable and not-sprayable across both countries."
https://openalex.org/W2891861398,"High-cost orphan drugs are becoming increasingly available to treat rare diseases that affect a relatively small population. Little attention has been given to the prevalence of rare diseases and their health-related economic burden in Taiwan.This study examined the national trends in the prevalence of rare diseases and their health-related economic burden (including medication costs) in Taiwan.Rare disease-related claims data from 2003-2014 (12 years) from the National Health Insurance Research Database were used in this study. We used a time series analysis to assess trends in the yearly rates of treated patients with rare diseases, overall healthcare use, and expenditures, including drugs.During the 12-year study period, the estimated prevalence of rare diseases increased from 10.57 to 33.21 per 100,000 population, an average rate of a 19.46% increase per year. Total health expenditures for treatment of rare diseases increased from US$18.65 million to US$137.44 million between 2003 and 2014, accounting for 0.68% of the total national health expenditures in 2014. Drug expenditures for treatment of rare diseases increased from US$13.24 million to US$121.98 million between 2003 and 2014, which accounted for 71.00% and 88.75% of the health expenditures for patients with rare diseases in 2003 and 2014, respectively. In 2014, we found a 20.43-fold difference in average health expenditures and a 69.46-fold difference in average drug expenditures between patients with rare diseases and the overall population.The prevalence of rare diseases and the related economic burden have grown substantially in Taiwan over the past 12 years, and these trends are likely to continue. Drug expenditures accounted for almost 90% of health expenditures for rare diseases. Further analyses are underway to examine the economic burden of individual rare diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2892121229,"Background Some patients calling ambulance services (known as Emergency Medical Services internationally) are not transported to hospital. In England, national ambulance quality indicators show considerable variation in non-transport rates between the ten large regional ambulance services. The aim of this study was to explain variation between ambulance services in two types of non-transport: discharge at scene and telephone advice. Methods Mixed model logistic regressions using one month of data (November 2014) from the Computer Aided Despatch systems of the ten large regional ambulance services in England. Results 41% (251 677/615 815) of patients calling ambulance services were not transported to hospital. Most were discharged at scene after attendance by an ambulance (29% n = 182 479) and a small percentage were given telephone advice (7% n = 40 679). Discharge at scene rates varied by patient-level factors e.g. they were higher for elderly patients, where the reason for calling was falls, and for patients attended by paramedics with extended skills. These patient-level factors did not explain variation between ambulance services. After adjustment for patient-level factors, the following ambulance service level factors explained variation in discharge at scene rates: proportion of patients attended by paramedics with extended skills (odds ratio 1.05 (95% CI 1.04, 1.07)), the perception of ambulance service staff that paramedics with extended skills were established and valued within the workforce (odds ratio 1.84 (1.45, 2.33), and the perception of ambulance service staff that senior management viewed non-transport as risky (odds ratio 0.78 (0.63, 0.98)). Variation in telephone advice rates could not be explained. Conclusions Variation in discharge at scene rates was explained by differences in workforce configuration and managerial motivation, factors that are largely modifiable by ambulance services."
https://openalex.org/W2890806245,"Climate change and human globalization have spurred the rapid spread of mosquito-borne diseases to naïve populations. One such emerging virus of public health concern is chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a member of the Togaviridae family, genus Alphavirus CHIKV pathogenesis is predominately characterized by acute febrile symptoms and severe arthralgia, which can persist in the host long after viral clearance. CHIKV has also been implicated in cases of acute encephalomyelitis, and its vertical transmission has been reported. Currently, no FDA-approved treatments exist for this virus. Recoding elements help expand the coding capacity in many viruses and therefore represent potential therapeutic targets in antiviral treatments. Here, we report the molecular and structural characterization of two CHIKV translational recoding signals: a termination codon read-through (TCR) element located between the nonstructural protein 3 and 4 genes and a programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift (-1 PRF) signal located toward the 3' end of the CHIKV 6K gene. Using Dual-Luciferase and immunoblot assays in HEK293T and U87MG mammalian cell lines, we validated and genetically characterized efficient TCR and -1 PRF. Analyses of RNA chemical modification data with selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation and primer extension (SHAPE) assays revealed that CHIKV -1 PRF is stimulated by a tightly structured, triple-stem hairpin element, consistent with previous observations in alphaviruses, and that the TCR signal is composed of a single large multibulged hairpin element. These findings illuminate the roles of RNA structure in translational recoding and provide critical information relevant for design of live-attenuated vaccines against CHIKV and related viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2890397246,"Nitrogen (N) supply, including NO3--N and organic N in the form of amino acids can influence the morphological attributes of plants. For example, amino acids contribute to plant nutrition; however, the effects of exogenous amino acids on NO3--N uptake and root morphology have received little attention. In this study, we evaluated the effects of exogenous glycine (Gly) on root growth and NO3--N uptake in pak choi (Brassica campestris ssp. Chinensis L.). Addition of Gly to NO3--N agar medium or hydroponic solution significantly decreased pak choi seedling root length; these effects of Gly on root morphology were not attributed to the proportion of N supply derived from Gly. When pak choi seedlings were exposed to mixtures of Gly and NO3--N in hydroponic culture, Gly significantly reduced 15NO3--N uptake but significantly increased the number of root tips per unit root length, root activity and 15NO3--N uptake rate per unit root length. In addition, 15N-Gly was taken up into the plants. In contrast to absorbed NO3--N, which was mostly transported to the shoots, a larger proportion of absorbed Gly was retained in the roots. Exogenous Gly enhanced root 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase (ACS) and oxidase (ACO) activities and ethylene production. The ethylene antagonists aminoethoxyvinylglycine (0.5 μM AVG) and silver nitrate (10 μM AgNO3) partly reversed Gly-induced inhibition of primary root elongation on agar plates and increased the NO3--N uptake rate under hydroponic conditions, indicating exogenous Gly exerts these effects at least partly by enhancing ethylene production in roots. These findings suggest Gly substantially affects root morphology and N uptake and provide new information on the specific responses elicited by organic N sources."
https://openalex.org/W2889919716,"Root skin color is one of the economically important traits in radish (Raphanus sativus), and the pigmentation in red skin varieties is largely attributable to anthocyanin accumulation. Pelargonidin was found as a major anthocyanin pigment accumulated in the sub-epidermal layer of red radish roots. In the 20 F2 population generated from the F1 with red root skins, root skins with red and white colors segregated in a 3:1 ratio. Additionally, a test cross between a red F3 individual and a white skin individual gave rise to 1:1 segregation of red and white, indicating that the root skin color of radish is determined by a single locus and red color is dominant over white. We performed association mapping for root skin color using SNPs obtained from RNA-seq analysis. Segregation analysis on the 152 F3 test-cross population revealed an RsMyb1 transcription factor as a candidate gene to determine root skin color. A PCR marker based on the polymorphism within 2 kb of RsMyb1 was developed and tested on 12 and 152 individuals from F2 and F3 test cross populations, respectively, and red and white root skin colors were completely distinguished corresponding to the genotypes. Expression levels of RsMyb1 in red or purple root cultivars were significantly higher than in white root cultivars. These findings suggest that RsMyb1 is a crucial determinant for anthocyanin biosynthesis in radish roots, and the molecular marker developed in this study will be useful for marker-assisted selection for red skin individuals at early seedling stages."

Here, we present the comprehensive metabolic network model of E. coli BL21(DE3), named iHK1487, based on the latest genome reannotation and phenome analysis. The metabolic model consists of 1,164 unique metabolites, 2,701 metabolic reactions, and 1,487 genes. The model was validated and improved by comparing the simulation results with phenome data from phenotype microarray tests. Previous transcriptome profile data was incorporated during model reconstruction, and flux prediction was simulated using the model. iHK1487 was simulated to explore the metabolic features of BL21(DE3) such as broad spectrum amino acid utilization and enhanced flux through the upper glycolytic pathway and TCA cycle. iHK1487 will contribute to systematic understanding of cellular physiology and metabolism of E. coli BL21(DE3) and highlight its biotechnological applications."

In innate immune cells, LPS is recognized by co-receptors Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and CD-14 to initiate an inflammatory response for subsequent cytokine production. One such cytokine, interleukin (IL)-27, is produced by myeloid cells in response to bacterial infection. In monocytes, IL-27 has proinflammatory functions such as up-regulating TLR4 expression for enhanced LPS-mediated cytokine production; alternatively, IL-27 induces inhibitory functions in activated macrophages. This study investigated the effects of IL-27 on the induction of endotoxin tolerance in models of human monocytes compared with macrophages. Our data demonstrate that IL-27 inhibits endotoxin tolerance by up-regulating cell surface TLR4 expression and soluble CD14 production to mediate stability of the surface LPS-TLR4-CD14 complex in THP-1 cells. In contrast, elevated basal expression of membrane-bound CD14 in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)–THP-1 cells, primary monocytes, and primary macrophages may promote CD14-mediated endocytosis and be responsible for the preservation of an endotoxin-tolerized state in the presence of IL-27.

https://openalex.org/W2889847556,"Certain cancers, including gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and subsets of melanoma, are caused by somatic KIT mutations that result in KIT receptor tyrosine kinase constitutive activity, which drives proliferation. The treatment of KIT-mutant GIST has been revolutionized with the advent of KIT-directed cancer therapies. KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are superior to conventional chemotherapy in their ability to control advanced KIT-mutant disease. However, these therapies have a limited duration of activity due to drug-resistant secondary KIT mutations that arise (or that are selected for) during KIT TKI treatment. To overcome the problem of KIT TKI resistance, we sought to identify novel therapeutic targets in KIT-mutant GIST and melanoma cells using a human tyrosine kinome siRNA screen. From this screen, we identified lemur tyrosine kinase 3 (LMTK3) and herein describe its role as a novel KIT regulator in KIT-mutant GIST and melanoma cells. We find that LMTK3 regulated the translation rate of KIT, such that loss of LMTK3 reduced total KIT, and thus KIT downstream signaling in cancer cells. Silencing of LMTK3 decreased cell viability and increased cell death in KIT-dependent, but not KIT-independent GIST and melanoma cell lines. Notably, LMTK3 silencing reduced viability of all KIT-mutant cell lines tested, even those with drug-resistant KIT secondary mutations. Furthermore, targeting of LMTK3 with siRNA delayed KIT-dependent GIST growth in a xenograft model. Our data suggest the potential of LMTK3 as a target for treatment of patients with KIT-mutant cancer, particularly after failure of KIT TKIs."
https://openalex.org/W2890472397,"Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is a naturally occurring Lentivirus causing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in felines. It is considered a useful non-primate model to study HIV infection, and to test anti-HIV vaccine. Similarly to HIV, FIV enters cells via a mechanism involving a surface glycoprotein named gp36. C8 is a short synthetic peptide corresponding to the residues 770WEDWVGWI777 of gp36 membrane proximal external region (MPER). It elicits antiviral activity by inhibiting the fusion of the FIV and host cell membrane. C8 is endowed with evident membrane binding property, inducing alteration of the phospholipid bilayer and membrane fusion. The presence and the position of tryptophan residues in C8 are important for antiviral activity: the C8 derivative C6a, obtained by truncating the N-terminal 770WE771 residues, exhibits conserved antiviral activity, while the C8 derivative C6b, derived from the truncation of the C-terminal 776WI777, is nearly inactive. To elucidate the structural factors that induce the different activity profiles of C6a and C6b, in spite of their similarity, we investigated the structural behaviour of the two peptides in membrane mimicking environments. Conformational data on the short peptides C6a and C6b, matched to those of their parent peptide C8, allow describing a pharmacophore model of antiviral fusion inhibitors. This includes the essential structural motifs to design new simplified molecules overcoming the pharmacokinetic and high cost limitations affecting the antiviral entry inhibitors that currently are in therapy."

It is also not known how the accessory domains contribute to regulation, in part because soluble, catalytically active variants have not been available for study. The only structural information for this enzyme comes from NMR structures of its two RA domains and a crystal structure of the RA2 domain in complex with Ras GTPase (35Bunney T.D. Harris R.

Thus, PLCɛ appears more similar to PLCδ than PLCβ with respect to the requirement for its PH domain in lipase activity. In this work, we used biochemical assays, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and negative stain EM to obtain structural insights into the solution architecture of PLCɛ and probe the roles of its PH and RA domains in regulating basal activity. We show that the PH domain, likely together with the first two EF-hands (EF1/2), is conformationally heterogeneous with respect to the rest of the PLC core, which retains a compact structure. In addition, the PH and RA domains have opposing effects on the thermal stability of the enzyme that indicate that one or both RA domains are intimately associated with the core, but the PH domain is not. To compare these results with that of a structurally well-characterized PLC, we also examined the solution structure of the PLCβ3 core domains. In contrast to the structures observed across multiple different crystal forms, we show that the PLCβ PH domain also adopts multiple conformations in solution. Using site-directed mutagenesis and disulfide bond engineering, we found that both the extended and closed conformational states of the PLCβ PH domain retain basal activity and adsorb to liposomes, suggesting that these conformational states are functionally relevant. Thus, it seems likely that all PLC enzymes containing PH domains may be inherently dynamic in solution and that these conformational states may underlie subfamily-specific differences in their autoregulation, their association with cell membranes, and their allosteric regulation by other signaling proteins. Given the lack of prior knowledge about the tertiary organization of PLCɛ, we investigated the respective contributions of the PH domain and the two RA domains to basal activity, the structural integrity of the enzyme, and binding to model membranes. Because the full-length enzyme presents significant challenges in expression and purification, we expressed and purified three PLCɛ domain deletion variants: PH-COOH, which retains the core domains and both RA domains (residues 837–2282); PH-C2, which lacks both RA domains (residues 837–1972); and EF-COOH, which lacks the PH domain (residues 1035–2282) (Fig. 1A) (1Kadamur G.

Loss of the RA domains in PH-C2 decreased basal activity 6-fold (65 ± 23 nmol of IP3/min/nmol of PLCɛ variant, p ≤ 0.0001), whereas loss of the PH domain in EF-COOH decreases activity 15-fold (25 ± 12 nmol of IP3/min/nmol of PLCɛ variant, p ≤ 0.0001) (Fig. 1B). To test whether the loss in specific activity is due to protein destabilization, the melting temperature (Tm) of each variant was determined using differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) (40Mezzasalma T.M. Kranz J.K. Chan W. Struble G.T. Schalk-Hihi C. Deckman I.C. Springer B.A. Todd M.J. Enhancing recombinant protein quality and yield by protein stability profiling.J. Biomol. Screen. 2007; 12 (17438070): 418-42810.1177/1087057106297984Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The PH-COOH and EF-COOH variants have similar Tm values of 51.3 ± 0.7 and 50.6 ± 1.6 °C, respectively (Fig. 1C), but PH-C2 has a lower Tm (48.3 ± 1.0 °C, p ≤ 0.005). This suggests that one or both RA domains directly contribute to the thermal stability of the enzyme. The resulting destabilization of the PLC core may be sufficient to account for the decreased basal activity of this variant. We next tested whether differences in basal activity were due to changes in the ability of the variants to bind PIP2-containing liposomes using a pelleting assay (41Glukhova A. Hinkovska-Galcheva V. Kelly R. Abe A. Shayman J.A. Tesmer J.J. Structure and function of lysosomal phospholipase A2 and lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 (25727495)625010.1038/ncomms7250Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that PH-COOH and PH-C2 would show the greatest binding to liposomes, as they retain the PH domain. However, in the presence of liposomes, all three variants were present to similar extents in the pellet, suggesting that differences in activity are not due to differences in binding (Fig. 1, D and E). The PLCɛ PH domain increases basal activity, but has no effect on thermal stability. We therefore hypothesized that the PH domain may be flexibly attached to the rest of the core. If so, then its molecular envelope should be characteristically different from that predicted by the crystal structures of PLCβ (46% sequence identity for the region spanning EF3 through the C2 domain). We used small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to determine low-resolution ab initio bead models for the PLCɛ PH-COOH, EF-COOH, and PH-C2 variants (Fig. 2, Table 1, Table 2, and Figs. S1–S4) (42Skou S. Gillilan R.E. Ando N. Synchrotron-based small-angle X-ray scattering of proteins in solution.Nat.

S1 and S2). The minimal variability of radius of gyration (Rg) as determined by Guinier approximation using the SAXS data (Fig. S3) or molecular weights as determined by multi-angle light scattering (MALS) (Fig. S4) across the elution peaks indicates that the samples were monodisperse. Guinier plots for each variant were also consistent with the absence of aggregates. PH-COOH and PH-C2 have Rg values of 43 ± 0.54 and 40 ± 0.48 Å, respectively, whereas EF-COOH had an Rg of 46 ± 2.5 Å (Fig. 2 (D–F) and Table 2). All three PLCɛ variants also had pair distance distribution functions consistent with a predominantly compact shape, but with some extended conformational aspects. The maximal intramolecular dimension (Dmax) for each variant was determined, with values of ∼162, ∼148, and ∼161 Å, for PH-COOH, PH-C2, and EF-COOH, respectively (Fig. 2, G–I). The SAXS data were also used to estimate the molecular masses of the variants using the volume of correlation (Vc) and the Porod volume (Vp) (43Korasick D.A. Tanner J.J.

PH-COOH had molecular masses of 118 kDa (Vc) and 126 kDa (Vp), lower than the calculated molecular mass of 165.5 kDa.

In this commentary, we explain that such an estimate for 2000 is implausible, as it suggests that the 2000 Census undercounted the unauthorized immigrant population by at least 42% in the 2000 Census, and it is misaligned with other demographic data. Fazel-Zarandi, Feinstein and Kaplan's model produces estimates that have a 10 million-person range in 2016, far too wide to be useful for public policy purposes; their estimates are not benchmarked against any external data sources; and their model appears to be driven by assumptions about return migration of unauthorized immigrants during the 1990s. Using emigration rates from the binational Mexican Migration Project survey for the illegal border-crosser portion of the unauthorized population, we generate a 2000 unauthorized population estimate of 8.2 million-slightly below Pew and DHS's estimates-without changing other assumptions in the model. We conclude that this new model's estimates are highly sensitive to assumptions about emigration, and moreover, that the knowledge base about emigration in the unauthorized population during the 1990s is not well enough developed to support the model underlying their estimates."
https://openalex.org/W2890652993,"G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channel regulates cellular excitability upon activation of Gi/o-coupled receptors. In Gi/o-coupled muscarinic M2R, the intracellular third loop (i3) is known as a key domain for Gi/o coupling, because replacement of i3 of Gq-coupled muscarinic M1R with that of M2R enables the chimeric receptor (MC9) to activate the GIRK channel. In the present study, we showed that MC9, but not M1R, co-localizes with the GIRK channel and Gαi1 by Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis. When M1R was forced to stay adjacent to the channel through ligation with short linkers, M1R activated the GIRK channel. FRET analysis further suggested that the efficacy of channel activation is correlated with the linker length between M1R and the GIRK channel. The results show that co-localization is an important factor for activating the GIRK channel. In contrast, for MC9 and M2R, the GIRK channel was activated even when they were connected by long linkers, suggesting the formation of a molecular complex even in the absence of a linker. We also observed that replacement of 13 amino acid residues at the N-terminal end of i3 of MC9 with those of M1R impaired the co-localization with the GIRK channel as well as channel activation. These results show that localization of the receptor near the GIRK channel is a key factor in efficiently activating the channel and that the N-terminal end of i3 of M2R plays an important role in co-localization."
https://openalex.org/W2892175685,"Objective To evaluate bronchovascular injuries as the causative occurrence for clinically significant hemoptysis after percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy (PTNB). Materials and methods We included 111 consecutive patients who experienced hemoptysis after cone beam CT (CBCT)-guided PTNB from January 2014 through January 2017. Clinically significant hemoptysis was defined as hemoptysis causing hemodynamic instability or oxygen desaturation greater than 10% of baseline. The lesion characteristics were evaluated on CT images. The penetration of bronchovascular structures along the trajectory of the introducer needle and potential penetration at the firing of the biopsy gun were assessed on CBCT images. The cutting injury of bronchovascular structures was histopathologically assessed in biopsy specimens. The associated factors for clinically significant hemoptysis were assessed using logistic regression analyses. Results Seventeen patients (15.3%; 95%CI, 9.7%-23.2%) had clinically significant hemoptysis. On univariate analysis, the open bronchus sign (P = .004), nodule consistency (P = .012), potential penetration of a pulmonary vessel or bronchus 1 mm or larger at firing (P = .008 and P = .038, respectively), and a cutting injury of a pulmonary vessel 1 mm or larger (P = .007) or a bronchial structure (P = .041) were associated with clinically significant hemoptysis. Multivariate analysis found the following significant associated factors: potential penetration of a pulmonary vessel 1 mm or larger at firing (OR, 3.874; 95%CI, 1.072–13.997; P = .039) and cutting injury of a pulmonary vessel 1 mm or larger (OR, 6.920; 95%CI, 1.728–27.711; P = .006) or a bronchial structure (OR 4.604; 95%CI, 1.194–17.755; P = .027). Conclusion Potential penetration and cutting injury of bronchovascular structures 1mm or larger at firing were independently associated with clinically significant hemoptysis after PTNB."
https://openalex.org/W2892001382,"We present a biologically motivated model for visual self-localization which extracts a spatial representation of the environment directly from high dimensional image data by employing a single unsupervised learning rule. The resulting representation encodes the position of the camera as slowly varying features while being invariant to its orientation resembling place cells in a rodent’s hippocampus. Using an omnidirectional mirror allows to manipulate the image statistics by adding simulated rotational movement for improved orientation invariance. We apply the model in indoor and outdoor experiments and, for the first time, compare its performance against two state of the art visual SLAM methods. Results of the experiments show that the proposed straightforward model enables a precise self-localization with accuracies in the range of 13-33cm demonstrating its competitiveness to the established SLAM methods in the tested scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W2892369413,"Backfat thickness is one of the most important traits of commercially raised pigs. Meishan pigs are renowned for having thicker backfat than Landrace pigs. To examine the genetic factors responsible for the differences, we first produced female crossbred pig lines by mating Landrace (L) × Large White (W) × Duroc (D) females (LWD) with Landrace (L) or Meishan (M) boars (i.e., LWD × L = LWDL for Landrace offspring and LWD × M = LWDM for the Meishan offspring). We confirmed that LWDM pigs indeed had a thicker backfat than LWDL pigs. Next, we performed gene expression microarray analysis in both genetic lines to examine differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in energy metabolism-related tissues, subcutaneous adipose (fat), liver, and longissimus dorsi muscle tissues. We analyzed the annotation of DEGs (2-fold cutoff) to functionally categorize them by Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. The number of DEGs in muscle tissues of both lines was much less than that in fat and liver tissues, indicating that DEGs in muscle tissues may not contribute much to differences in backfat thickness. In contrast, several genes related to muscle (in fat tissue) and lipid metabolism (in liver tissue) were more upregulated in LWDM pigs than LWDL pigs, indicating that those DEGs might be responsible for differences in backfat thickness. The different genome-wide gene expression profiles in the fat, liver, and muscle tissues between genetic lines can provide useful information for pig breeders."
https://openalex.org/W2889892221,"The calcium binding protein ALG-2 is upregulated in several types of cancerous tissues and cancer cell death may be a consequence of ALG-2 downregulation. Novel research suggests that ALG-2 is involved in membrane repair mechanisms, in line with several published studies linking ALG-2 to processes of membrane remodeling and transport, which may contribute to the fitness of cells or protect them from damage. To investigate the involvement of ALG-2 in cell recovery after membrane damage we disrupted the PDCD6 gene encoding the ALG-2 protein in DT-40 cells and exposed them to electroporation. ALG-2 knock-out cells were more sensitive to electroporation as compared to wild type cells. This phenotype could be reversed by reestablishing ALG-2 expression confirming that ALG-2 plays an important role in cell recovery after plasma membrane damage. We found that overexpression of wild type ALG-2 but not a mutated form unable to bind Ca2+ partially protected HeLa cells from digitonin-induced cell death. Further, we were able to inhibit the cell protective function of ALG-2 after digitonin treatment by adding a peptide with the ALG-2 binding sequence of ALIX, which has been proposed to serve as the ALG-2 downstream target in a number of processes including cell membrane repair. Our results suggest that ALG-2 may serve as a novel therapeutic target in combination with membrane damaging interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2889806339,"Purpose To investigate whether the elastic energy stored in an eyeball at highest concavity (highest concavity energy; HCE), calculated with Corivs ST (CST, OCULUS), correlates with glaucomatous visual field (VF) progression. Methods 108 eyes from 70 primary open angle-glaucoma patients were studied. The HCE was calculated using CST parameters. For each eye, the mean total deviation (mTD) of the 52 test points in the 24–2 Humphrey Field Analyzer test pattern was calculated and the mTD progression rate was determined from eight reliable VFs. Eyes were subdivided into: subgroups with low- or high-whole eye motion maximal length (WEM-d) and subgroups with short- or long-time taken to reach WEM-d (WEM-t), as measured with CST. The associations between mTD progression rate and HCE and other ocular/systemic parameters including age, Goldmann applanation tonometry based-intraocular pressure [GAT-IOP], and corneal hysteresis [CH] from the Ocular Response Analyzer (ORA®, Reichert) were investigated using the linear mixed model. The optimal model to describe mTD progression rate was selected from all possible combinations according to the second order bias corrected Akaike Information Criterion index. Results Optimal models to describe mTD progression rate included: CH in the model for all eyes, age and HCE in the model for the WEM-d low group, HCE in the model for the WEM-t short group, mean GAT-IOP in the model for the WEM-d high group, and age in the model for the WEM-t long-group. Conclusions HCE was associated with glaucomatous VF progression in eyes with minimal whole eye motion (low WEM-d and WEM-t subgroups)."
https://openalex.org/W2891220018,"Aims of the study Despite the widespread existence of guidelines regarding undernutrition monitoring and reporting, there is scarce information whether they are followed. We aimed to evaluate the adherence to guidelines regarding undernutrition monitoring and reporting as well as their determinants in a university hospital. Methods Retrospective analysis of discharged patients with data on Nutritional Risk Screening score (NRS-2002) from the department of internal medicine of the Lausanne University Hospital for years 2013–14. Adherence to the hospital monitoring guidelines, i.e.: 1) discharged patients with NRS-2002 score≥3 should have prealbumin levels measured, and 2) discharged patients with prealbumin levels<0.20 g/l should be rechecked 7 days afterwards, was assessed. Reporting of nutritionally ‘at-risk’ status in the discharge letter was also assessed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine potential determinants of adherence to guidelines. Results Of the 2,539 discharged patients with NRS-2002 data, 1,605 (63.0%) were nutritionally ‘at-risk’. Complete adherence to the monitoring guideline was observed in 238 (14.8%) of ‘at-risk’ patients. After multivariable analysis, adherence to the first step of monitoring guideline was associated with older age (≥ 80 years) [OR (95% CI): 2.03 (1.29–3.18)], high comorbidity index [1.36 (1.05–1.77)], and nutritional management [5.57 (4.38–7.07)]. Nutritional management was also associated with adherence to the second step of monitoring [3.98 (2.33–6.78)]. Adherence to the reporting guideline was observed in 343 (21.4%) of ‘at-risk’ patients. Multivariable analysis showed that adherence to the reporting guideline was associated with NRS-2002 score>4 [1.97 (1.47–2.64)], nutritional management [3.80 (2.85–5.07)], and adherence to the monitoring guideline [3.33 (2.35–4.71)]. Conclusions Our results show a poor adherence to guidelines regarding undernutrition monitoring and reporting, possibly due to lack of training, staff, and time."
https://openalex.org/W2891446387,"Here, we investigated the early development of two closely related myxozoan parasites, the highly pathogenic Myxobolus cerebralis, the causative agent of the whirling disease in salmonids, and Myxobolus pseudodispar, a common, non-pathogenic parasite of cyprinids. The aim of our study was to examine under in vivo laboratory conditions whether fish blood is involved in the intrapiscine development of the two parasite species and investigate if there is dissimilarity between the parasite infection intensity in blood and if it varies in terms of host susceptibility and parasite pathogenicity. Highly susceptible, less susceptible and non-susceptible hosts were involved. Blood samples were taken 1 day, 1 week and 1 month post exposure to M. cerebralis and M. pseudodispar, respectively. The prevalence and infection intensity was estimated by parasite-specific quantitative real-time PCR. Although previous findings assumed that M. cerebralis might escape from host immune system by migrating via peripheral nerves, our experimental results demonstrated that M. cerebralis is present in blood during the early stage of intrapiscine development. For the non-pathogenic M. pseudodispar, the highest infection prevalence was found in the original host, common roach Rutilus rutilus, whereas the highest infection intensity was detected in rudd Scardinius erythrophthalmus, a ""dead-end"" host of the parasite. The presence of M. pseudodispar developmental stages in the blood of both susceptible and non-susceptible cyprinids suggests that the susceptibility differences remain hidden during the early stage of infection. Our findings supply further evidence that host specificity is not determined during the early, intrapiscine development involving the vascular system. Furthermore, we found remarkable differences in the infection dynamics of the two parasite species examined, possibly due to their distinct pathogenicity or variations in adaptive capabilities to immune components in host blood."
https://openalex.org/W2891799704,"Monocytes are a heterogeneous population of effector cells with key roles in tissue integrity restoration and maintenance. Here, we explore the association of monocyte subsets and prognosis in patients with ambulatory heart failure (HF). Monocyte subsets were classified as classical (CD14++/CD16-), intermediate (CD14++/CD16+), or non-classical (CD14+/CD16++). Percentage distribution and absolute cell count were assessed in each subset, and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed with all-cause death, HF-related hospitalization, and the composite end-point of both as dependent variables. 400 patients were consecutively included (72.8% male, age 69.4±12.2 years, 45.5% from ischemic aetiology, left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) 41.6% ±14.5, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II 62.8% and III 30.8%). During a mean follow-up of 2.6±0.9 years, 107 patients died, 99 had a HF-related hospitalization and 160 suffered the composite end-point of all-cause death or HF-related hospitalization. Monocyte subsets assessed in percentages were not independently associated to any of the end-points. When considering number of cells/μL, intermediate subset was independently associated with an increase of all-cause death (HR 1.25 [95% CI 1,02-1.52], p = 0.03), and the composite end-point HR 1.20 [95% CI 1,03-1.40], p = 0.02). The presented findings show that absolute cell count of monocyte subsets was preferred over monocyte percentage for prognosis stratification for outpatients with HF. The intermediate monocyte subset provides information on increased risk of all-cause death and the composite end-point."
https://openalex.org/W2892081514,"Psychological stress has been suggested to be relevant to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, possibly via the generation of oxygen free radicals. We therefore sought to determine whether people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) had been subjected to more potentially stressful life events or occupations than controls, and whether they had differences in resilience or trait anxiety that would moderate their responses to these stressors. An online anonymous multilingual questionnaire was used to collect data on significant life events from people with and without ALS, using items from a modified Social Readjustment Rating Scale and from self-described significant events, which were combined to create a Life Events Inventory. Inventory scores were subdivided into 0-20 years and 21-40 years age ranges, and for the preceding 2, 5 and 10 years. Respondents also rated levels of stress experienced during different occupations. Resilience was measured using the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and trait anxiety with a modified Geriatric Anxiety Inventory. Scores were compared using nonparametric statistics. Data from 400 ALS (251 male, 149 female) and 450 control (130 male, 320 female) respondents aged 40 years and over showed that Life Events Inventory scores were similar in male ALS respondents and controls, but lower in female ALS respondents than female controls for the preceding 5-year and 10-year periods. Occupational stress did not differ between ALS respondents and controls. Both male and female ALS respondents had higher resilience scores than controls. Anxiety scores did not differ between ALS and control groups. In conclusion, people with ALS reported no raised levels of potentially stressful premorbid life events or occupational stress, and did not have reduced levels of resilience, or increased levels of anxiety, that would augment the deleterious effects of stressors. On the contrary, ALS respondents had higher resilience than controls, though this conclusion relies on ALS respondents recalling their premorbid status. These results do not support the hypothesis that psychological stress from significant life events or occupational stress plays a role in the pathogenesis of ALS."

Previous studies showed that hyponatremia is associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures, which are also known to be associated with kidney stones. However, the relation between hyponatremia and kidney stones is not known. To assess the relation between hyponatremia and kidney stones, we designed a matched case-control study by using the electronic health records of the MedStar Health system with more than 3.4 million unique patient records as of March 2016. Data were extracted for clinical factors of patients with kidney stones (cases) and those without kidney stones (controls). Cases (n = 20,199) and controls (n = 20,199) were matched at a 1:1 ratio for age, sex, race, and the duration of encounter window. Case and control exposures for each of the hyponatremia variables were defined by serum sodium laboratory measurements reported within the encounter windows, and divided into 3 categories: prior hyponatremia, recent hyponatremia, and persistent hyponatremia. In the final conditional logistic models adjusted for potential confounders, the risk of kidney stones significantly increased in both recent and persistent hyponatremia categories: prior hyponatremia odds ratio (OR) 0.93 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86–1.00); recent hyponatremia OR 2.02 (95% CI, 1.76–2.32); persistent hyponatremia OR 6.25 (95% CI, 3.27–11.96). In conclusion, chronic persistent hyponatremia is a significant and clinically important risk factor for kidney stones in patients in the U.S."
https://openalex.org/W2891229789,"Uniformly pigmented Eisenia andrei (Ea) and striped E. fetida (Ef) lumbricid earthworms are hermaphrodites capable of self-fertilization, cross-fertilization, and asymmetrical hybridization. The latter was detected by genotyping of F1 and F2 progeny of the controlled Ea+Ef pairs by species-specific sequences of maternal mitochondrial COI genes and maternal/paternal nuclear S28 rRNA genes. Among F1offspring there were self-fertilized Ea (aAA), Ef (fFF), and cross-fertilized fertile Ea-derived hybrids (aAF); the latter mated with Ea and gave new generation of Ea and hybrids, while mated with Ef gave Ea, Ef, Ea-derived hybrids and sterile Ef-derived hybrids (fFA). Coelomic fluid of Ea exhibits unique fluorescence spectra called here the M-fluorescence considered as a molecular biomarker of this species. Since similar fluorescence was detected also in some Ef (hypothetical hybrids?), the aim of present investigations was to identify the M-positive earthworms among families genotyped previously. It was assumed that factor/s responsible for metabolic pathways leading to production of undefined yet M-fluorophore might be encoded/controlled by alleles of hypothetical nuclear gene of Eisenia sp. segregating independently from species-specific S28 rRNA nuclear genes, where ‘MM’ or ‘Mm’ alleles determine M-positivity while ‘mm’ alleles determine M-negative phenotypes. Spectra of M-fluorescence were detected in all 10 Ea (aAAMM) and 19 Ea-derived hybrids (aAFMm), three of four Ef-derived hybrids (fFAMm) and one ‘atypical’ Ef (fFFMm) among 13 Ef earthworms. Among progeny of ‘atypical’ M-positive Ef (fFFMm) reappeared ‘typical’ M-negative Ef (fFFmm), confirming such hypothesis. Alternatively, the M-fluorescence might be dependent on unknown gene products of vertically-transmitted Ea-specific symbiotic bacteria sexually transferred to the Ef partner. Hypotheses of intrinsic and external origin of M-fluorescence might complement each other. The presence/absence of M-fluorophore does not correspond with body pigmentation patterns; Ef-characteristic banding appeared in posterior parts of hybrids body. In conclusion, Ea/Ef hybridization may serve for further studies on bi-directional gene flow."
https://openalex.org/W2889694429,"The small GTPase RhoA plays a crucial role in the regulation of neuronal signalling to generate behaviour. In the developing nervous system RhoA is known to regulate the actin cytoskeleton, however the effectors of RhoA-signalling in adult neurons remain largely unidentified. We have previously shown that activation of the RhoA ortholog (RHO-1) in C. elegans cholinergic motor neurons triggers hyperactivity of these neurons and loopy locomotion with exaggerated body bends. This is achieved in part through increased diacylglycerol (DAG) levels and the recruitment of the synaptic vesicle protein UNC-13 to synaptic release sites, however other pathways remain to be identified. Dopamine, which is negatively regulated by the dopamine re-uptake transporter (DAT), has a central role in modulating locomotion in both humans and C. elegans. In this study we identify a new pathway in which RHO-1 regulates locomotory behaviour by repressing dopamine signalling, via DAT-1, linking these two pathways together. We observed an upregulation of dat-1 expression when RHO-1 is activated and show that loss of DAT-1 inhibits the loopy locomotion phenotype caused by RHO-1 activation. Reducing dopamine signalling in dat-1 mutants through mutations in genes involved in dopamine synthesis or in the dopamine receptor DOP-1 restores the ability of RHO-1 to trigger loopy locomotion in dat-1 mutants. Taken together, we show that negative regulation of dopamine signalling via DAT-1 is necessary for the neuronal RHO-1 pathway to regulate locomotion."
https://openalex.org/W2889768374,"Many of the challenges we currently face as an advanced society have been solved in unique ways by biological systems. One such challenge is developing strategies to avoid microbial infection. Social aculeates (wasps, bees and ants) mitigate the risk of infection to their colonies using a wide range of adaptations and mechanisms. These adaptations and mechanisms are reliant on intricate social structures and are energetically costly for the colony. It seems likely that these species must have had alternative and simpler mechanisms in place to ensure the maintenance of hygienic domicile conditions prior to the evolution of these complex behaviours. Features of the aculeate coiled-coil silk proteins are reminiscent of those of naturally occurring α-helical antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). In this study, we demonstrate that peptides derived from the aculeate silk proteins have antimicrobial activity. We reconstruct the predicted ancestral silk sequences of an aculeate ancestor that pre-dates the evolution of sociality and demonstrate that these ancestral sequences also contained peptides with antimicrobial properties. It is possible that the silks evolved as an antifouling material and facilitated the evolution of sociality. These materials serve as model materials for consideration in future biomaterial development."
https://openalex.org/W2890900590,"Exercise has long-lasting benefits to bone mass and structural strength even after cessation. Combining exercise with a calcium- and phosphorus-supplemented diet increases cortical bone mineral content (BMC), area, and yield force more than exercise alone in adult mice. These increases could also be maintained after stopping exercise if the modified diet is maintained. It was hypothesized that combining exercise with a mineral-supplemented diet would lead to greater cortical BMC, area, and yield force immediately after a lengthy exercise program and after an equally long period of non-exercise (detraining) in adult mice. Male, 16-week old C57Bl/6 mice were assigned to 9 weight-matched groups–a baseline group, exercise and non-exercise groups fed a control or mineral-supplemented diet for 8 weeks, exercise + detraining and non-exercise groups fed a control or mineral-supplemented diet for 16 weeks. Exercise + detraining consisted of 8 weeks of exercise followed by 8 weeks without exercise. The daily exercise program consisted of running on a treadmill at 12 m/min, 30 min/day. After 8 weeks, mice fed the supplemented diet had greater tibial cortical BMC and area, trabecular bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV), bone mineral density (vBMD), yield force, and ultimate force than mice fed the control diet. Exercise increased cortical BMC and area only when coupled with the supplemented diet. After 16 weeks, both exercised and non-exercised mice fed the supplemented diet maintained greater tibial cortical BMC and area, trabecular BV/TV, vBMD, yield force, and ultimate force than mice fed the control diet. Combining exercise with a mineral-supplemented diet leads to greater bone mass and structural strength than exercise alone. These benefits remain after an equally long period of detraining. Long-term use of dietary mineral supplements may help increase and maintain bone mass with aging in adult mice."
https://openalex.org/W4233613633,"One of the biggest challenges in analyzing high throughput omics data in biological studies is extracting information that is relevant to specific biological mechanisms of interest while simultaneously restricting the number of false positive findings. Due to random chances with numerous candidate targets and mechanisms, computational approaches often yield a large number of false positives that cannot easily be discerned from relevant biological findings without costly, and often infeasible, biological experiments. We here introduce and apply an integrative bioinformatics approach, Biologically Anchored Knowledge Expansion (BAKE), which uses sequential statistical analysis and literature mining to identify highly relevant network genes and effectively removes false positive findings. Applying BAKE to genomic expression data collected from mouse (Mus musculus) adipocytes during insulin resistance progression, we uncovered the transcription factor Krueppel-like Factor 4 (KLF4) as a regulator of early insulin signaling. We experimentally confirmed that KLF4 controls the expression of two key insulin signaling molecules, the Insulin Receptor Substrate 2 (IRS2) and Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 (TSC2)."
https://openalex.org/W2893411617,"Cyanobacteriochromes (CBCRs) are photochromic proteins in cyanobacteria that act as photosensors. CBCRs bind bilins as chromophores and sense nearly the entire visible spectrum of light, but the regulation of the chromophorylation of CBCRs is unknown. Slr1393 from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is a CBCR containing three consecutive GAF (cGMP phosphodiesterase, adenylyl cyclase, and FhlA protein) domains, of which only the third one (Slr1393g3) can be phycocyanobilin-chromophorylated. The protein Slr2111 from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 includes a cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) domain pair of an as yet unknown function at its N terminus. CBS domains are often characterized as sensors of cellular energy status by binding nucleotides. In this work, we demonstrate that Slr2111 strongly interacts with Slr1393 in vivo and in vitro, which generates a complex in a 1:1 molar ratio. This tight interaction inhibits the chromophorylation of Slr1393g3, even if the chromophore is present. Instead, the complex stability and thereby the chromophorylation of Slr1393 are regulated by the binding of nucleotides (ATP, ADP, AMP) to the CBS domains of Slr2111 with varying affinities. It is demonstrated that residues Asp-53 and Arg-97 of Slr2111 are involved in nucleotide binding. While ATP binds to Slr2111, the association between the two proteins gets weaker and chromophorylation of Slr1393 are enabled. In contrast, AMP binding to Slr2111 leads to a stronger association, thereby inhibiting the chromophorylation. It is concluded that Slr2111 acts as a sensor of the cellular energy status that regulates the chromophorylation of Slr1393 and thereby its function as a light-driven histidine kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2891014429,"Naturally occurring sounds are routinely periodic. The ability to phase-lock to such periodicity facilitates pitch perception and interaural time differences (ITDs) determination in binaural localization. We examined whether deficient pitch processing in individuals with congenital amusia (tone deafness) is accompanied by impaired ability to lateralize musical pitch at auditory periphery and memorize the location of pitch at the working memory level. If common mechanisms subserve processing of temporal-fine-structure based pitch and ITDs, then deficient processing of one feature should impair performance on the other. Thus, we measured ITD discrimination thresholds using an adaptive-tracking procedure for lateralizing musical tone pairs separated by different semitone intervals. Amusic individuals exhibited normal ITD thresholds comparable to those of matched controls, which were not affected by concurrent pitch changes. For working memory tasks, the amusic group performed significantly worse than matched controls in probed pitch recall, irrespective of the complexity level of concurrent variations along the ITD dimension of the melodic sequence. Interestingly, despite normal peripheral ITD thresholds, amusic individuals performed worse than controls in recalling probed locations of tones within a sequence of musical notes originating from different ITD-simulated locations. Findings suggest that individuals with congenital amusia are unimpaired in temporal fine-structure encoding to determine the location of musical pitch based on binaural ITD information at the auditory periphery. However, working memory for a sequence of sounds' ITD-dependent spatial location is here shown to be impaired and dissociated from the pitch feature of sounds at the working memory level."
