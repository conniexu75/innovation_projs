https://openalex.org/W2615586845,"Microglia, the resident macrophages of the CNS, engage in various CNS-specific functions that are critical for development and health. To better study microglia and the properties that distinguish them from other tissue macrophage populations, we have optimized serum-free culture conditions to permit robust survival of highly ramified adult microglia under defined-medium conditions. We find that astrocyte-derived factors prevent microglial death ex vivo and that this activity results from three primary components, CSF-1/IL-34, TGF-β2, and cholesterol. Using microglial cultures that have never been exposed to serum, we demonstrate a dramatic and lasting change in phagocytic capacity after serum exposure. Finally, we find that mature microglia rapidly lose signature gene expression after isolation, and that this loss can be reversed by engrafting cells back into an intact CNS environment. These data indicate that the specialized gene expression profile of mature microglia requires continuous instructive signaling from the intact CNS."
https://openalex.org/W2616012590,"The successful planning and execution of adaptive behaviors in mammals may require long-range coordination of neural networks throughout cerebral cortex. The neuronal implementation of signals that could orchestrate cortex-wide activity remains unclear. Here, we develop and apply methods for cortex-wide Ca2+ imaging in mice performing decision-making behavior and identify a global cortical representation of task engagement encoded in the activity dynamics of both single cells and superficial neuropil distributed across the majority of dorsal cortex. The activity of multiple molecularly defined cell types was found to reflect this representation with type-specific dynamics. Focal optogenetic inhibition tiled across cortex revealed a crucial role for frontal cortex in triggering this cortex-wide phenomenon; local inhibition of this region blocked both the cortex-wide response to task-initiating cues and the voluntary behavior. These findings reveal cell-type-specific processes in cortex for globally representing goal-directed behavior and identify a major cortical node that gates the global broadcast of task-related information."
https://openalex.org/W2616354017,"Glial calcium dynamics in space and time Astrocytes use calcium signals to process information received from neighboring brain cells and thus generate modulatory responses at the local or network level. Previous studies have relied on calcium imaging in line scans or in a single focal plane mostly focusing on the cell bodies of astrocytes. Bindocci et al. used more powerful scanners that can rapidly scan many focal planes. They combined this technique with advanced genetic tools for monitoring calcium gradients with high sensitivity, which allowed three-dimensional calcium imaging of a whole astrocyte. Most of the basal calcium activity occurred in the astrocyte processes, some in the endfeet, and only a small fraction actually in the cell bodies of astrocytes. Science , this issue p. eaai8185"
https://openalex.org/W2616734028,"Learning involves a transformation of brain-wide operation dynamics. However, our understanding of learning-related changes in macroscopic dynamics is limited. Here, we monitored cortex-wide activity of the mouse brain using wide-field calcium imaging while the mouse learned a motor task over weeks. Over learning, the sequential activity across cortical modules became temporally more compressed, and its trial-by-trial variability decreased. Moreover, a new flow of activity emerged during learning, originating from premotor cortex (M2), and M2 became predictive of the activity of many other modules. Inactivation experiments showed that M2 is critical for the post-learning dynamics in the cortex-wide activity. Furthermore, two-photon calcium imaging revealed that M2 ensemble activity also showed earlier activity onset and reduced variability with learning, which was accompanied by changes in the activity-movement relationship. These results reveal newly emergent properties of macroscopic cortical dynamics during motor learning and highlight the importance of M2 in controlling learned movements."
https://openalex.org/W2614623901,"We introduce a flexible method for high-resolution interrogation of circuit function, which combines simultaneous 3D two-photon stimulation of multiple targeted neurons, volumetric functional imaging, and quantitative behavioral tracking. This integrated approach was applied to dissect how an ensemble of premotor neurons in the larval zebrafish brain drives a basic motor program, the bending of the tail. We developed an iterative photostimulation strategy to identify minimal subsets of channelrhodopsin (ChR2)-expressing neurons that are sufficient to initiate tail movements. At the same time, the induced network activity was recorded by multiplane GCaMP6 imaging across the brain. From this dataset, we computationally identified activity patterns associated with distinct components of the elicited behavior and characterized the contributions of individual neurons. Using photoactivatable GFP (paGFP), we extended our protocol to visualize single functionally identified neurons and reconstruct their morphologies. Together, this toolkit enables linking behavior to circuit activity with unprecedented resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2616355480,"CaMKII plays a critical role in decoding calcium (Ca2+) signals to initiate long-lasting synaptic plasticity. However, the properties of CaMKII that mediate Ca2+ signals in spines remain elusive. Here, we measured CaMKII activity in spines using fast-framing two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging. Following each pulse during repetitive Ca2+ elevations, CaMKII activity increased in a stepwise manner. Thr286 phosphorylation slows the decay of CaMKII and thus lowers the frequency required to induce spine plasticity by several fold. In the absence of Thr286 phosphorylation, increasing the stimulation frequency results in high peak mutant CaMKIIT286A activity that is sufficient for inducing plasticity. Our findings demonstrate that Thr286 phosphorylation plays an important role in induction of LTP by integrating Ca2+ signals, and it greatly promotes, but is dispensable for, the activation of CaMKII and LTP."
https://openalex.org/W2616256335,"To assess the neurobiological substrate of initial cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease (PD) to inform patient management, clinical trial design, and development of treatments.We longitudinally assessed, up to 3 years, 423 newly diagnosed patients with idiopathic PD, untreated at baseline, from 33 international movement disorder centers. Study outcomes were four determinations of cognitive impairment or decline, and biomarker predictors were baseline dopamine transporter (DAT) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; volume and thickness), diffusion tensor imaging (mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; amyloid beta [Aβ], tau and alpha synuclein), and 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with PD cognition. Additionally, longitudinal structural MRI and DAT scan data were included. Univariate analyses were run initially, with false discovery rate = 0.2, to select biomarker variables for inclusion in multivariable longitudinal mixed-effect models.By year 3, cognitive impairment was diagnosed in 15-38% participants depending on the criteria applied. Biomarkers, some longitudinal, predicting cognitive impairment in multivariable models were: (1) dopamine deficiency (decreased caudate and putamen DAT availability); (2) diffuse, cortical decreased brain volume or thickness (frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobe regions); (3) co-morbid Alzheimer's disease Aβ amyloid pathology (lower CSF Aβ 1-42); and (4) genes (COMT val/val and BDNF val/val genotypes).Cognitive impairment in PD increases in frequency 50-200% in the first several years of disease, and is independently predicted by biomarker changes related to nigrostriatal or cortical dopaminergic deficits, global atrophy due to possible widespread effects of neurodegenerative disease, co-morbid Alzheimer's disease plaque pathology, and genetic factors."
https://openalex.org/W2615702226,"We recently applied multiplexed seqFISH to profile expressions of hundreds of genes at the single-cell level in situ (Shah et al., 2016) and provided a map of spatial heterogeneity within each subregion, reconciling previously contradictory descriptions of CA1 at lower spatial resolutions. The accompanying Matters Arising paper from Cembrowski and Spruston questions the spatial organization described for CA1 and raise concerns that the results were determined only by high expression, non-barcoded genes. In response, we show that the same robust spatial structure is observed when only lower average abundance genes measured by barcoded seqFISH are used. In fact, many genes with low average abundance are informative of cell states because they can be expressed strongly in specific subpopulation of cells. Our discussion highlights the importance of single-cell in situ analysis in resolving cellular and spatial heterogeneities otherwise lost in population-averaged measurements. This Matters Arising Response paper addresses the Cembrowski and Spruston (2017) Matters Arising paper, published concurrently in this issue of Neuron."
https://openalex.org/W2615997750,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease in which upper and lower motoneurons degenerate leading to muscle wasting, paralysis and eventually death from respiratory failure. Several studies indicate that skeletal muscle contributes to disease progression; however the molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Fibrosis is a common feature in skeletal muscle under chronic damage conditions such as those caused by muscular dystrophies or denervation. However, the exact mechanisms of fibrosis induction and the cellular bases of this pathological response are unknown. We show that extracellular matrix (ECM) components are augmented in skeletal muscles of symptomatic hSOD1G93A mice, a widely used murine model of ALS. These mice also show increased TGF-β1 mRNA levels, total Smad3 protein levels and p-Smad3 positive nuclei. Furthermore, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRα), Tcf4 and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) levels are augmented in the skeletal muscle of symptomatic hSOD1G93A mice. Additionally, the fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs), which are the main producers of ECM constituents, are also increased in these pathogenic conditions. Therefore, FAPs and ECM components are more abundant in symptomatic stages of the disease than in pre-symptomatic stages. We present evidence that fibrosis observed in skeletal muscle of symptomatic hSOD1G93A mice is accompanied with an induction of TGF-β signaling, and also that FAPs might be involved in triggering a fibrotic response. Co-localization of p-Smad3 positive cells together with PDGFRα was observed in the interstitial cells of skeletal muscles from symptomatic hSOD1G93A mice. Finally, the targeting of pro-fibrotic factors such as TGF-β, CTGF/CCN2 and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling pathway might be a suitable therapeutic approach to improve muscle function in several degenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2614150835,"The selection and timing of actions are subject to determinate influences such as sensory cues and internal state as well as to effectively stochastic variability. Although stochastic choice mechanisms are assumed by many theoretical models, their origin and mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we investigated this issue by studying how neural circuits in the frontal cortex determine action timing in rats performing a waiting task. Electrophysiological recordings from two regions necessary for this behavior, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and secondary motor cortex (M2), revealed an unexpected functional dissociation. Both areas encoded deterministic biases in action timing, but only M2 neurons reflected stochastic trial-by-trial fluctuations. This differential coding was reflected in distinct timescales of neural dynamics in the two frontal cortical areas. These results suggest a two-stage model in which stochastic components of action timing decisions are injected by circuits downstream of those carrying deterministic bias signals."
https://openalex.org/W2615489098,"Microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) are main candidates to stabilize neuronal microtubules, playing an important role in establishing axon-dendrite polarity. However, how MAPs are selectively targeted to specific neuronal compartments remains poorly understood. Here, we show specific localization of microtubule-associated protein 6 (MAP6)/stable tubule-only polypeptide (STOP) throughout neuronal maturation and its role in axonal development. In unpolarized neurons, MAP6 is present at the Golgi complex and in secretory vesicles. As neurons mature, MAP6 is translocated to the proximal axon, where it binds and stabilizes microtubules. Further, we demonstrate that dynamic palmitoylation, mediated by the family of α/β Hydrolase domain-containing protein 17 (ABHD17A-C) depalmitoylating enzymes, controls shuttling of MAP6 between membranes and microtubules and is required for MAP6 retention in axons. We propose a model in which MAP6's palmitoylation mediates microtubule stabilization, allows efficient organelle trafficking, and controls axon maturation in vitro and in situ."
https://openalex.org/W2616638744,"Synchronous release triggered by Ca2+ binding to synaptotagmin-1, -2, or -9 is thought to drive fast synaptic transmission, whereas asynchronous release induced by Ca2+ binding to synaptotagmin-7 is thought to produce delayed synaptic signaling, enabling prolonged synaptic computations. However, it is unknown whether synaptotagmin-7-dependent asynchronous release performs a physiological function at fast synapses lacking a prolonged signaling mode, such as the calyx of Held synapse. Here, we show at the calyx synapse that synaptotagmin-7-dependent asynchronous release indeed does not produce a prolonged synaptic signal after a stimulus train and does not contribute to short-term plasticity, but induces a steady-state, asynchronous postsynaptic current during stimulus trains. This steady-state postsynaptic current does not increase overall synaptic transmission but instead sustains reliable generation of postsynaptic spikes that are precisely time locked to presynaptic spikes. Thus, asynchronous release surprisingly functions, at least at some synapses, to sustain high-fidelity neurotransmission driven by synchronous release during high-frequency stimulus trains."
https://openalex.org/W2614115422,"The striatum controls behavior in two ways: facilitation and suppression through the direct and indirect pathways, respectively. However, it is still unclear what information is processed in these pathways. To address this question, we studied two pathways originating from the primate caudate tail (CDt). We found that the CDt innervated the caudal-dorsal-lateral part of the substantia nigra pars reticulata (cdlSNr), directly or indirectly through the caudal-ventral part of the globus pallidus externus (cvGPe). Notably, cvGPe neurons receiving inputs from the CDt were mostly visual neurons that encoded stable reward values of visual objects based on long-past experiences. Their dominant response was inhibition by valueless objects, which generated disinhibition of cdlSNr neurons and inhibition of superior colliculus neurons. Our data suggest that low-value signals are sent by the CDt-indirect pathway to suppress saccades to valueless objects, whereas high-value signals are sent by the CDt-direct pathway to facilitate saccades to valuable objects."
https://openalex.org/W2616275380,"Background/Objective Despite the relevance of pancreatic fat content in the development of metabolic diseases, its association with impaired glucose metabolism, diabetes, and other adipose tissue compartments remains unclear. Thus, we determined differences in pancreatic fat content by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) between subjects with prediabetes, diabetes, and normal controls in a cohort from the general population. Methods Subjects without history of cardiovascular disease with established diabetes or prediabetes as well as normal controls were included and underwent whole-body MRI on a 3T scanner. Pancreatic fat content was quantified by measuring the proton-density fat fraction (PDFFpanc) using a 3D multi-echo GRE sequence (increment: 1.23 ms, 6 echoes) by placing ROIs in the pancreatic head, body, and tail by independent readers. In addition, hepatic fat content as well as abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue (SAT and VAT) were measured by multi-echo GRE and 3D 2-point volume-interpolated DIXON MRI, respectively. Univariate and multivariate analyses were employed to determine associations. Results A total of 385 subjects were included in the analysis (median age: 57 years, 58.2% males), of them 53 were classified as subjects with diabetes, 95 as prediabetes, and 237 as controls (13.8%, 24.7%, and 61.6%; respectively). The median PDFFpanc was 5.2% [IQR 3.3–9.4], and significantly higher in subjects with prediabetes and diabetes as compared to controls (PDFFpanc: 6.2% [IQR: 3.5–12] vs. 8.6% [IQR: 4.3–17.5] vs. 4.9% [3.1–7.4], p<0.001, respectively). After adjusting for age, gender and BMI the association was attenuated (all p>0.12). While in univariate analysis BMI, PDFFhepatic, SAT and VAT were associated with PDFFpanc (all p<0.05), only VAT predicted PDFFpanc independently (β: 0.02, 95%-confidence interval: 0.01–0.04, p<0.001). Conclusion While pancreatic fat content differs significantly between subjects with prediabetes, diabetes and controls, this association may be confounded by age, gender, and the amount of VAT in this cross-sectional study."
https://openalex.org/W2614761965,"A novel, selective and sensitive single-ion monitoring (SIM) gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) method was developed and validated for the determination of energy metabolites related to glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, glutaminolysis, and fatty acid β-oxidation. This assay used N-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-N-methyltrifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA) containing 1% tert-butyldimethylchlorosilane (TBDMCS) as derivatizing reagent and was highly reproducible, sensitive, specific and robust. The assay was used to analyze liver tissue and serum from C57BL/6N obese mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and C57BL/6N mice fed normal chow for 8 weeks. HFD-fed mice serum displayed statistically significantly reduced concentrations of pyruvate, citrate, succinate, fumarate, and 2-oxoglutarate, with an elevated concentration of pantothenic acid. In liver tissue, HFD-fed mice exhibited depressed levels of glycolysis end-products pyruvate and lactate, glutamate, and the TCA cycle intermediates citrate, succinate, fumarate, malate, and oxaloacetate. Pantothenate levels were 3-fold elevated accompanied by a modest increased gene expression of Scl5a6 that encodes the pantothenate transporter SLC5A6. Since both glucose and fatty acids inhibit coenzyme A synthesis from pantothenate, it was concluded that these data were consistent with downregulated fatty acid β-oxidation, glutaminolysis, glycolysis, and TCA cycle activity, due to impaired anaplerosis. The novel SIM GCMS assay provided new insights into metabolic effects of HFD in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2615457365,"Basic knowledge about the thoracic spinal flexibility is limited and to the authors’ knowledge, no in vitro studies have examined the flexibility of every thoracic spinal segment under standardized experimental conditions using pure moments. In our in vitro study, 68 human thoracic functional spinal units including the costovertebral joints (at least n = 6 functional spinal units per segment from T1-T2 to T11-T12) were loaded with pure moments of ±7.5 Nm in flexion/extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation in a custom-built spine tester to analyze range of motion (ROM) and neutral zone (NZ). ROM and NZ showed symmetric motion behavior in all loading planes. In each loading direction, the segment T1-T2 exhibited the highest ROM. In flexion/extension, the whole thoracic region, with exception of T1-T2 (14°), had an average ROM between 6° and 8°. In lateral bending, the upper thoracic region (T1-T7) was, with an average ROM between 10° and 12°, more flexible than the lower thoracic region (T7-T12) with an average ROM between 8° and 9°. In axial rotation, the thoracic region offered the highest overall flexibility with an average ROM between 10° and 12° in the upper and middle thoracic spine (T1-T10) and between 7° and 8° in the lower thoracic spine (T10-T12), while a trend of continuous decrease of ROM could be observed in the lower thoracic region (T7-T12). Comparing these ROM values with those in literature, they agree that ROM is lowest in flexion/extension and highest in axial rotation, as well as decreasing in the lower segments in axial rotation. Differences were found in flexion/extension and lateral bending in the lower segments, where, in contrast to the literature, no increase of the ROM from superior to inferior segments was found. The data of this in vitro study could be used for the validation of numerical models and the design of further in vitro studies of the thoracic spine without the rib cage, the verification of animal models, as well as the interpretation of already published human in vitro data."
https://openalex.org/W2614211142,"High summer temperatures in extratropical areas have an impact on the public's health, mainly through heat stress, high air pollution concentrations, and the transmission of tropical diseases. The purpose of this study is to examine the current characteristics of heat events and future projections of summer apparent temperature (AT)-and associated health concerns-throughout the southeastern United States. Synoptic climatology was used to assess the atmospheric characteristics of extreme heat days (EHDs) from 1979-2015. Ozone concentrations also were examined during EHDs. Trends in summer-season AT over the 37-year period and correlations between AT and atmospheric circulation were determined. Mid-century estimates of summer AT were calculated using downscaled data from an ensemble of global climate models. EHDs throughout the Southeast were characterized by ridging and anticyclones over the Southeast and the presence of moist tropical air masses. Exceedingly high ozone concentrations occurred on EHDs in the Atlanta area and throughout central North Carolina. While summer ATs did not increase significantly from 1979-2015, summer ATs are projected to increase substantially by mid-century, with most the Southeast having ATs similar to that of present-day southern Florida (i.e., a tropical climate). High ozone concentrations should continue to occur during future heat events. Large urban areas are expected to be the most affected by the future warming, resulting from intensifying and expanding urban heat islands, a large increase in heat-vulnerable populations, and climate conditions that will be highly suitable for tropical-disease transmission by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. This nexus of vulnerability creates the potential for heat-related morbidity and mortality, as well as the appearance of disease not previously seen in the region. These effects can be attenuated by policies that reduce urban heat (e.g., cool roofs and green roofs) and that improve infrastructure (e.g. emergency services, conditioned space)."
https://openalex.org/W2616671993,"Background While body mass index (BMI) is the most widely used anthropometric measure, its association with all-cause mortality is generally J-shaped or U-shaped. A body shape index (ABSI) is a recently formulated anthropometric measure that shows linear relationship to all-cause mortality, especially in Caucasian cohorts. We aimed to address the relationship between ABSI and all-cause mortality in Asians and to assess the influence of sex difference and of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on this relationship. Methods This was a longitudinal cohort study assessing the association of ABSI, BMI, waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) with all-cause mortality in a Japanese nationwide Specific Health Checkup database. The study enrolled 160,625 participants followed-up between 2008 and 2012. We calculated the all-cause mortality risk associated with a 1-standard deviation increase (+1SD) in ABSI, BMI, WC, or WHtR in cohorts stratified by sex and the presence of CKD. Results During the 4-year follow up, 1.3% of participants died. In men, ABSI (+1SD) significantly increased the risk for all-cause mortality after adjusting for other known risk factors including CKD; hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of non-CKD cohort, 1.30 (1.18 to 1.43), p<0.01; HR and 95%CI of CKD cohort, 1.16 (1.01 to 1.34), p = 0.04. In women, ABSI (+1SD) did not show significant association with all-cause mortality, especially in the CKD cohort; HR and 95% CI of non-CKD cohort, 1.07 (0.99 to 1.17), p = 0.09; HR and 95%CI of CKD cohort, 0.98 (0.84 to 1.14), p = 0.78. Conversely, BMI (+1SD) was associated with significantly lower risk in men, although minimal association was found in women. WC and WHtR showed little association with all-cause mortality. On stratification per ABSI quartiles, mortality risk increased linearly and significantly with ABSI in men, but not in women with CKD. Both BMI and WC showed significant but U-shaped association with mortality in the non-CKD cohort and in men with CKD. WHtR also showed significant U-shaped association with mortality in men. Conclusions In the Japanese population, ABSI showed significant and linear correlation with mortality risk in men but not in women, especially in the presence of CKD."

Thus, a slow Ca2+ sensor contributes to the fast signaling properties of the calyx synapse. Synaptotagmins are the main Ca2+ sensors of exocytosis in neuronal and non-neuronal cells. The mammalian genome encodes 17 synaptotagmins, eight of which bind Ca2+ (Syt1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10) (Table 1). This raises the important question: “Why so many?” (Südhof, 2002Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7629-7632Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Three of the synaptotagmins, Syt1, Syt2, and Syt5/9, have been shown to operate as fast release sensors (Xu et al., 2007Xu J. Mashimo T. Südhof T.C.

Among these “other” synaptotagmins, Syt7 stands out in multiple ways. First, together with Syt1 and Syt4, Syt7 is the only isoform expressed in all metazoans. Second, the amino acid sequence of Syt7 is different from that of the other synaptotagmins. For example, Syt7 shows only ∼40% sequence identity with Syt1, Syt2, and Syt5/9. Third, Syt7 has the slowest disassembly kinetics of Ca2+-Syt-membrane complexes upon rapid mixing with Ca2+ chelator (Hui et al., 2005Hui E. Bai J. Wang P. Sugimori M. Llinas R.R. Chapman E.R. Proc.

Results from initial genetic elimination experiments were rather disappointing, at least for neuroscientists. When the first Syt7 knockout mouse was generated in 2003 by Norma Andrews' group, the phenotype was completely non-neuronal: the mice showed inflammation and fibrosis in skin and skeletal muscle, which was traced to a defect in lysosomal exocytosis. Furthermore, subsequent analysis of synaptic function in Syt7 knockout mice by Tom Südhof's group did not reveal any phenotype at GABAergic synapses in culture. Thus, the function of Syt7 in transmitter release at central synapses remained unclear. Why did genetic elimination of Syt7 fail to reveal a synaptic phenotype, despite its abundant expression in the CNS? If Syt7 would coexist with other synaptotagmin isoforms, the synaptotagmins with fast Ca2+-binding kinetics may outcompete Syt7, which shows the slowest binding kinetics (Hui et al., 2005Hui E. Bai J. Wang P. Sugimori M. Llinas R.R. Chapman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 5210-5214Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, Bacaj et al., 2013Bacaj T. Wu D. Yang X. Morishita W. Zhou P. Xu W. Malenka R.C. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 2013; 80: 947-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar examined the effects of knockdown of Syt7 following genetic deletion of the fast synaptotagmin isoforms. After elimination of the fast Ca2+ sensor, Syt1, a slow, asynchronous release component remained. Indeed, this slow component was eliminated by knockdown of Syt7. Thus, Syt7 was able to mediate a slow form of transmitter release but only became effective after the fast Ca2+ sensor was eliminated (Bacaj et al., 2013Bacaj T. Wu D. Yang X. Morishita W. Zhou P. Xu W. Malenka R.C. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 2013; 80: 947-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). These results showed that Syt7 can mediate slow transmitter release in specific conditions (i.e., after elimination of fast sensors). But what is Syt7’s physiological function? Two possible functions recently have been demonstrated (Figure 1). First, Syt7 acts as a sensor of Ca2+-dependent replenishment of the releasable pool of synaptic vesicles at glutamatergic synapses in primary hippocampal culture (Liu et al., 2014Liu H. Bai H. Hui E. Yang L. Evans C.S. Wang Z. Kwon S.E. Chapman E.R. eLife. 2014; 3: e01524Google Scholar). Second, Syt7 contributes to facilitation of transmitter release during repetitive stimulation at hippocampal and corticothalamic synapses in slices (Jackman et al., 2016Jackman S.L. Turecek J. Belinsky J.E. Regehr W.G. Nature. 2016; 529: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). However, Syt7 is widely expressed in the brain and is present at several synapses that lack facilitation. For example, Syt7 is expressed in fast-spiking, parvalbumin+ GABAergic interneurons (Kerr et al., 2008Kerr A.M. Reisinger E. Jonas P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 15581-15586Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and the output synapses of these cells show depression rather than facilitation of transmitter release during repetitive stimulation. What is the role of Syt7 at synapses that do not show facilitation? The paper by Luo and Südhof, 2017Luo F. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 2017; 94 (this issue): 826-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar in this issue of Neuron provides an answer to this question. The authors examined the effects of genetic deletion of Syt7 at the calyx of Held, a key synapse in the auditory brainstem. This synapse offers several technical advantages for a quantitative biophysical analysis of transmitter release. In particular, simultaneous pre-postsynaptic recordings and presynaptic capacitance measurements can be obtained in slices because of the large size of the presynaptic terminals. This synapse also shows unique functional properties, including efficacy and temporal precision of transmitter release. Under a wide range of stimulation frequencies, it operates as a relay or detonator synapse, converting presynaptic into postsynaptic action potentials. Luo and Südhof, 2017Luo F. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 2017; 94 (this issue): 826-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar examined the effects of genetic elimination of Syt7 at the calyx of Held. They report four major findings. First, deletion of Syt7 markedly reduced a tonic (“basal”) postsynaptic current during a high-frequency stimulus train. This current seemed to be generated by asynchronous release, because it was blocked by the Ca2+ chelator EGTA (Figure 1). Second, deletion of Syt7 abolished a slow component in presynaptic capacitance signals, further suggesting that Syt7 mediates slow transmitter release from calyx terminals. Third, Syt7 deletion increased the frequency of miniature EPSCs in Syt2 knockout mice, indicating that Syt7, like other synaptotagmins, clamps spontaneous release. Finally, the authors demonstrate that asynchronous release during a stimulus train did not increase the overall synaptic output but assisted small synchronous release events in the temporally precise initiation of postsynaptic spikes. Hence, at the mechanistic level, Syt7 triggers asynchronous release during a train of stimuli, reminiscent of the function of a Syt7 ortholog in the zebrafish neuromuscular junction (Wen et al., 2010Wen H. Linhoff M.W. McGinley M.J. Li G.L. Corson G.M. Mandel G. Brehm P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 13906-13911Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). At the functional level, Syt7 enhances both efficacy and temporal precision of spike-to-spike transmission during repetitive activity. Thus, somewhat unexpectedly, a slow Ca2+ sensor contributes to the fast signaling properties of the calyx synapse. Although the paper by Luo and Südhof, 2017Luo F. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 2017; 94 (this issue): 826-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar sheds new light on the function of Syt7, important questions remain. The relations between the various suggested functions of Syt7 (asynchronous release, facilitation, and replenishment) need to be determined. It is possible that Syt7 has different functions at different synapses. However, the proposed functions may not be mutually exclusive. For example, fast Ca2+-dependent replenishment during high-frequency stimulation could generate both facilitation and asynchronous release by filling the vesicular pools. If Syt7 is important for spike-to-spike transmission at the calyx of Held, an auditory behavioral phenotype would be expected. Careful behavioral analysis of the Syt7 knockout mice will be needed to reveal this phenotype. Finally, we need to find out whether the present findings generalize to other fast synapses. For example, it would be interesting to examine the functional contribution of Syt7 at the output synapses of parvalbumin+ GABAergic interneurons, another rapidly signaling synapse in which Syt 7 may play a role (Kerr et al., 2008Kerr A.M. Reisinger E. Jonas P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 15581-15586Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In any case, we are making progress in our understanding of how the different synaptotagmin isoforms shape the efficacy and timing of transmitter release at central mammalian synapses. Synaptotagmin-7-Mediated Asynchronous Release Boosts High-Fidelity Synchronous Transmission at a Central SynapseLuo et al.NeuronMay 17, 2017In BriefLuo and Südhof demonstrate that synaptotagmin-7-mediated asynchronous release boosts fast synchronous transmission during high-frequency spike trains at the calyx synapse, thus expanding the computational role of asynchronous release to enable rapid information transfer at a fast central synapse.

https://openalex.org/W2616441454,"The purpose of this study was to investigate whether platelet-rich plasma (PRP) enhances osseous healing in conjunction with a high tibial osteotomy in dogs.Randomized controlled trial.Sixty-four client-owned pet dogs with naturally occurring rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament and that were to be treated with a high tibial osteotomy (tibial plateau leveling osteotomy) were randomized into the treatment or control group. Dogs in the treatment group received autologous platelet-rich plasma activated with calcium chloride and bovine thrombin to produce a well-formed PRP gel that was placed into the osteotomy at the time of surgery. Dogs in the control group received saline lavage of the osteotomy. All dogs had the osteotomy stabilized with identical titanium alloy implants and all aspects of the surgical procedure and post-operative care were identical among dogs of the two groups. Bone healing was assessed at exactly 28, 49, and 70 days after surgery with radiography and ultrasonography and with MRI at day 28. The effect of PRP on bone healing was assessed using a repeated measures analysis of covariance with radiographic and ultrasonographic data and using a t-test with the MRI data.Sixty dogs completed the study. There were no significant differences in age, weight, or gender distribution between the treatment and control groups. Twenty-seven dogs were treated with PRP and 33 were in the control group. The average platelet concentration of the PRP was 1.37x106 platelets/μL (±489x103) with a leukocyte concentration of 5.45x103/μL (±3.5x103). All dogs demonstrated progressive healing over time and achieved clinically successful outcomes. Time since surgery and patient age were significant predictors of radiographic healing and time since surgery was a significant predictor of ultrasonographic assessment of healing. There was no significant effect of PRP treatment as assessed radiographically, ultrasonographically, or with MRI.The PRP used in this study did not hasten osseous union in dogs treated with a high tibial osteotomy."
https://openalex.org/W2616716618,"Background and objective Coffee and tea are commonly consumed during pregnancy. While several of their components, like caffeine, have strong pharmacological effects, the effect on the unborn fetus remains unclear. Caffeine intake has been associated with abortion, preterm birth and fetal growth restriction, but a general consensus on caffeine restriction is still lacking. We aimed to investigate antenatal coffee, tea and caffeine consumption and the effect on birth weight and length, gestational age at birth and hypertensive disorders in pregnancy. Methods A total of 936 healthy pregnancies from the WHISTLER birth cohort with data on coffee and tea consumption were included. Maternal and child characteristics as well as antenatal coffee and tea consumption were obtained through postpartum questionnaires. Reported consumption was validated using available preconceptional data. Caffeine intake was calculated from coffee and tea consumption. Linear and logistic regression was used to assess the association with birth outcome and hypertensive disorders. Results After adjustment for smoking and maternal age, a daily consumption of more than 300mg of caffeine compared to less than 100mg of caffeine was significantly associated with an increased gestational age (linear regression coefficient = 2.00 days, 95%CI = 0.12–4.21, P = 0.03). Tea consumption was significantly related to a higher risk of pregnancy induced hypertension (OR = 1.13, 95%CI = 1.04–1.23, P = 0.004). No associations concerning coffee consumption or birth weight and birth length were observed. Conclusions Daily caffeine consumption of more than 300mg is possibly associated with an increase in gestational age at birth. A possible relation between high tea consumption and increased risk for pregnancy induced hypertension warrants further research. For most outcomes, we found no significant associations with coffee or tea intake."
https://openalex.org/W2616297865,"Fatty acids acutely stimulate GLP-1 secretion from L-cells in vivo. However, a high fat diet has been shown to reduce the density of L-cells in the mouse intestine and a positive correlation has been indicated between L-cell number and GLP-1 secretion. Thus, the mechanism of fatty acid-stimulated GLP-1 secretion, potential effects of long-term exposure to elevated levels of different fatty acid species, and underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In the present study, we sought to determine how long-term exposure to saturated (16:0) and unsaturated (18:1) fatty acids, by direct effects on GLP-1-producing cells, alter function and viability, and the underlying mechanisms.GLP-1-secreting GLUTag cells were cultured in the presence/absence of saturated (16:0) and unsaturated (18:1) fatty acids (0.125 mM for 48 h, followed by analyses of viability and apoptosis, as well as involvement of fatty acid oxidation, free fatty acid receptors (FFAR1) and ceramide synthesis. In addition, effects on the expression of proglucagon, prohormone convertase 1/3 (PC1/3), free fatty acid receptors (FFAR1, FFAR3), sodium glucose co-transporter (SGLT) and subsequent secretory response were determined.Saturated (16:0) and unsaturated (18:1) fatty acids exerted opposing effects on the induction of apoptosis (1.4-fold increase in DNA fragmentation by palmitate and a 0.5-fold reduction by oleate; p<0.01). Palmitate-induced apoptosis was associated with increased ceramide content and co-incubation with Fumonisin B1 abolished this lipo apoptosis. Oleate, on the other hand, reduced ceramide content, and-unlike palmitate-upregulated FFAR1 and FFAR3, evoking a 2-fold increase in FFAR1-mediated GLP-1 secretion following acute exposure to 0.125 mmol/L palmitate; (p<0.05).Saturated (16:0), but not unsaturated (18:1), fatty acids induce ceramide-mediated apoptosis of GLP-1-producing cells. Further, unsaturated fatty acids confer lipoprotection, enhancing viability and function of GLP-1-secreting cells. These data provide potential mechanistic insight contributing to reduced L-cell mass following a high fat diet and differential effects of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids on GLP-1 secretion in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2614222486,"The HIV care cascade is increasingly used to evaluate HIV treatment programs at the population level. However, the cascade indicators lack the ability to show changes over time, which reduces their utility to guide health policy. Alternatives have been proposed but are complex or result in a delay in results. We propose a new indicator of ART uptake, the time from HIV diagnosis to commencement of ART, and compare it to the existing cascade indicator of proportion of patients on treatment and the WHO proposed cohort cascade indicator of proportion of patients on treatment within one year of diagnosis.Records from patients from the two largest HIV treatment centres in the state of Victoria, Australia (Melbourne Sexual Health Centre and The Alfred Hospital Department of Infectious Diseases) from 2011 to 2015 were extracted. The intervals between date of diagnosis, entry into care and initiation of ART were compared.From 2011 to 2015 the proportion of in-care patients who were on ART rose from 87% to 93% (p<0.0001). From 2011 to 2014, the proportion of patients in care and on ART within one year of diagnosis increased from 43.4% to 78.9% (p = 0.001). The median time from diagnosis to ART fell from 418 days (IQR: 91-1176) to 77 days (IQR: 39-290)(p<0.001) by calendar year in which ART was commenced.From 2011 to 2015 there were substantial and clinically important falls in the median time from diagnosis to commencing ART in those that commenced ART. The size of this dramatic change was not apparent when only reporting the proportion of patients on ART. Time to ART is a useful indicator and can be used to supplement existing cascade indicators in measuring progress toward universal ART coverage."

The brain operates on a variety of spatial scales, from individual molecules to broad cellular networks. Clarifying the organizational rules of this multiscale system can provide critical insight into how the structure of the nervous system ultimately produces function. Among the many techniques available to elucidate these rules, gene expression analyses (e.g., in situ hybridization, “ISH”; next-generation RNA sequencing, “RNA-seq”) have emerged as powerful tools for identifying cell types and corresponding spatial organizational rules. A detailed understanding of how cell types are organized in space is particularly relevant for the hippocampus, wherein functional contributions from a given canonical cell type can vary according to geographical location (Knierim et al., 2013Knierim J.J. Neunuebel J.P. Deshmukh S.S. Functional correlates of the lateral and medial entorhinal cortex: objects, path integration and local-global reference frames.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

Consequently, a collection of work has emerged delineating how gene expression within cell types spatially varies across the hippocampus (Cembrowski et al., 2016aCembrowski M.S. Bachman J.L. Wang L.

At the core of this research is the question of whether cell-type heterogeneity adheres to discrete subdomains or exhibits continuous variation (Strange et al., 2014Strange B.A. Witter M.P. Lein E.S. Moser E.I. Functional organization of the hippocampal longitudinal axis.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 15: 655-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). Recently, Shah et al., 2016Shah S. Lubeck E.

One, the majority of genes targeted by seqFISH are expressed at such low levels that they are undetectable using other sensitive methods. Two, Shah et al., 2016Shah S. Lubeck E. Zhou W. Cai L.

Of these 125 genes, a clever strategy enables 100 genes to be multiplexed in four sequential rounds of hybridization by seqFISH barcoding (“barcoded genes”) (Lubeck et al., 2014Lubeck E. Coskun A.F.

We began by examining gene expression in subcluster 6_5, which contained the highest number of CA1 pyramidal cells (Table S2 in Shah et al., 2016Shah S. Lubeck E. Zhou W. Cai L. In situ transcription profiling of single cells reveals spatial organization of cells in the mouse hippocampus.Neuron. 2016; 92: 342-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). We note that cluster 6 is predominantly found in the pyramidal cell layer of dorsal CA1, and subcluster 6_5 in particular is described by enrichment of genes Csf2rb2, Cyp2c70, Fam69c, and Olr1 (Table S2 in Shah et al., 2016Shah S. Lubeck E. Zhou W. Cai L. In situ transcription profiling of single cells reveals spatial organization of cells in the mouse hippocampus.Neuron. 2016; 92: 342-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). However, cross-validation of these four putatively enriched genes found negligible expression in all three external datasets (Figure 1A). Specifically, population RNA-seq showed ∼0 fragments per kilobase of exon per million reads (FPKM) for all four genes, single-cell RNA-seq did not detect a single molecule of Csf2rb2, Fam69c, or Olr1 in 98.5% of cells (n = 815/827; Cyp2c70 was not quantified in this dataset), and ISH did not detect expression of any of these genes. Given the poor cross-validation of the enriched genes in this particular subcluster, we examined the extent to which all 100 barcoded genes were expressed in CA1 pyramidal cells. Again, all three external datasets indicated that most barcoded genes used in Shah et al., 2016Shah S. Lubeck E. Zhou W. Cai L. In situ transcription profiling of single cells reveals spatial organization of cells in the mouse hippocampus.Neuron. 2016; 92: 342-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar were expressed at low or undetectable levels (Figure 1B). In bulk RNA-seq, 84% of genes showed FPKM < 10, an operational threshold for functional expression (Cembrowski et al., 2016aCembrowski M.S. Bachman J.L. Wang L. Sugino K. Shields B.C. Spruston N. Spatial gene-expression gradients underlie prominent heterogeneity of CA1 pyramidal neurons.Neuron. 2016; 89: 351-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In single-cell RNA-seq, 90% of genes showed less than one detected molecule/cell on average. In ISH, 95% of genes showed no expression in CA1 pyramidal cells. Upon expanding our analysis to examine whether these genes were expressed in other cell types of the hippocampus, we again found that almost all barcoded genes were effectively off in the hippocampus (Figure 1C). Finally, similarly low expression of barcoded genes was observed for the second set of genes targeted by Shah et al., 2016Shah S. Lubeck E. Zhou W. Cai L. In situ transcription profiling of single cells reveals spatial organization of cells in the mouse hippocampus.Neuron. 2016; 92: 342-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar (249 gene set: population RNA-seq: 69% of genes < 10 FPKM across all neuronal populations; single-cell RNA-seq: 86% of genes < 1 molecule/cell for all cell types; ISH: 70% not detected). Thus, each of the three complementary transcriptomics datasets illustrated that the barcoded probes used by Shah et al., 2016Shah S. Lubeck E. Zhou W. Cai L. In situ transcription profiling of single cells reveals spatial organization of cells in the mouse hippocampus.Neuron. 2016; 92: 342-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar primarily targeted genes that exhibited minimal expression in the hippocampus. As with any scientific methodology, each one of these datasets has respective technical limitations and advantages. Despite these methodological differences, each external dataset arrived at the same conclusion: expression of most seqFISH barcoded genes was not externally verifiable. It remains to be determined whether seqFISH is prone to false positives or is truly resolving gene expression at very low abundances. In either case, however, this poses a significant caveat when using seqFISH as a classifier: both false and very low abundance transcripts contain minimal information relevant to cell-type classification and function. Consistent with this limitation, much of the organization found by Shah et al., 2016Shah S. Lubeck E. Zhou W. Cai L. In situ transcription profiling of single cells reveals spatial organization of cells in the mouse hippocampus.Neuron. 2016; 92: 342-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar is in stark contrast with conventional cell-type taxonomy of brain tissue. When the expression of all genes is considered in the hierarchical clustering of brain cell types, the primary bifurcation separates neurons from non-neuronal cells, and subsequent bifurcations refine subtypes of these broad classes (Figure 2) (Macosko et al., 2015Macosko E.Z.

Conversely, clustering using the seqFISH methodology, which employed a relatively small number of minimally expressed genes, exhibited a complicated hierarchy mixing regionally, structurally, and functionally distinct neuronal and non-neuronal populations (Figure 3B in Shah et al., 2016Shah S. Lubeck E. Zhou W. Cai L. In situ transcription profiling of single cells reveals spatial organization of cells in the mouse hippocampus.Neuron. 2016; 92: 342-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The dimensionality reduction associated with these clusters showed no separation between putatively distinct classes (Figure S3H in Shah et al., 2016Shah S. Lubeck E. Zhou W. Cai L. In situ transcription profiling of single cells reveals spatial organization of cells in the mouse hippocampus.Neuron. 2016; 92: 342-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), and even the finest classes failed to separate cells from different brain regions (Figure S3E in Shah et al., 2016Shah S.

In situ transcription profiling of single cells reveals spatial organization of cells in the mouse hippocampus.Neuron. 2016; 92: 342-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). It is unclear to what extent this poor separation reflects targeting a limited set of genes, the minimal expression of those genes, or false-positive effects. Regardless, a technique that does not recapitulate general and well-established principles of cellular organization is of limited value for elucidating the spatial organization of brain tissue. Shah et al., 2016Shah S. Lubeck E. Zhou W. Cai L. In situ transcription profiling of single cells reveals spatial organization of cells in the mouse hippocampus.Neuron. 2016; 92: 342-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, in fact, acknowledge this problem in their paper, but they ignore their own cautionary remarks by drawing these types of conclusions in the title, abstract, and discussion of the paper. Ultimately, a primary conclusion of Shah et al., 2016Shah S. Lubeck E. Zhou W. Cai L. In situ transcription profiling of single cells reveals spatial organization of cells in the mouse hippocampus.Neuron. 2016; 92: 342-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar was that their data mostly supported a regionalized view of cell identity across the long axis. Elucidating this organizational scheme has been a focal point of previous work, with various studies having arrived at different conclusions depending on the specific cell type examined. In CA3 pyramidal cells, discrete subpopulations are demarcated by sharp gene expression boundaries, with individual boundaries recapitulated by multiple genes (Thompson et al., 2008Thompson C.L. Pathak S.D. Jeromin A. Ng L.L. MacPherson C.R. Mortrud M.T. Cusick A. Riley Z.L. Sunkin S.M. Bernard A. et al.Genomic anatomy of the hippocampus.Neuron. 2008; 60: 1010-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In CA1 pyramidal cells, some genes can exhibit sharp expression boundaries (Dong et al., 2009Dong H.W. Swanson L.W. Chen L. Fanselow M.S. Toga A.W. Genomic-anatomic evidence for distinct functional domains in hippocampal field CA1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 11794-11799Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), although whole-genome RNA-seq has shown that the principal organizational strategy is continuous variation of a single population (Cembrowski et al., 2016aCembrowski M.S. Bachman J.L. Wang L. Sugino K. Shields B.C. Spruston N. Spatial gene-expression gradients underlie prominent heterogeneity of CA1 pyramidal neurons.Neuron. 2016; 89: 351-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, Habib et al., 2016Habib N. Li Y. Heidenreich M. Swiech L. Avraham-Davidi I. Trombetta J.J. Hession C. Zhang F. Regev A. Div-Seq: single-nucleus RNA-seq reveals dynamics of rare adult newborn neurons.Science. 2016; 353: 925-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). This CA1 spatial organization was recapitulated by ISH, immunohistochemistry, and circuit mapping (Cembrowski et al., 2016aCembrowski M.S. Bachman J.L. Wang L. Sugino K. Shields B.C. Spruston N. Spatial gene-expression gradients underlie prominent heterogeneity of CA1 pyramidal neurons.Neuron. 2016; 89: 351-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Despite seqFISH purportedly revealing a primarily discrete hippocampal architecture, it is difficult to discern abrupt transcriptional boundaries across the long axis (Figures 5, 6, and 7 in Shah et al., 2016Shah S. Lubeck E. Zhou W. Cai L. In situ transcription profiling of single cells reveals spatial organization of cells in the mouse hippocampus.Neuron. 2016; 92: 342-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Indeed, the only sharp boundary explicitly shown across this axis was in a single brain section (dashed line, Figure 5D; no clear boundary is evident in Brain 2 or Brain 3, Figures 6 and 7 in Shah et al., 2016Shah S. Lubeck E. Zhou W. Cai L. In situ transcription profiling of single cells reveals spatial organization of cells in the mouse hippocampus.Neuron. 2016; 92: 342-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), putatively between dorsal and intermediate CA1. This boundary, however, appears anatomically consistent with the border between CA1 and CA2 (Figure 3A). Pyramidal cells of CA2 are a structurally and functionally distinct class of neurons in the hippocampus (Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014Hitti F.L. Siegelbaum S.A. The hippocampal CA2 region is essential for social memory.Nature. 2014; 508: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, Kohara et al., 2014Kohara K. Pignatelli M. Rivest A.J. Jung H.Y. Kitamura T. Suh J. Frank D. Kajikawa K. Mise N. Obata Y. et al.Cell type-specific genetic and optogenetic tools reveal hippocampal CA2 circuits.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), yet were not considered in Shah et al., 2016Shah S. Lubeck E. Zhou W. Cai L. In situ transcription profiling of single cells reveals spatial organization of cells in the mouse hippocampus.Neuron. 2016; 92: 342-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar. We examined whether the enriched genes in subclusters 1 and 2, expressed in putative intermediate CA1 cells, were actually associated with CA2 pyramidal cells. This was indeed the case (Figure 3B; CA2 data from cell-type-specific population RNA-seq data; Cembrowski et al., 2016bCembrowski M.S. Wang L. Sugino K. Shields B.C. Spruston N. Hipposeq: a comprehensive RNA-seq database of gene expression in hippocampal principal neurons.eLife. 2016; 5: e14997Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), with one of these genes (Amigo2) even having been exploited for CA2-specific access in previous work (Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014Hitti F.L. Siegelbaum S.A. The hippocampal CA2 region is essential for social memory.Nature. 2014; 508: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) (Figure 3C). Therefore, upon cross-validation, the discrete dorsal-to-intermediate CA1 transition identified by Shah et al., 2016Shah S. Lubeck E. Zhou W. Cai L. In situ transcription profiling of single cells reveals spatial organization of cells in the mouse hippocampus.Neuron. 2016; 92: 342-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar appeared to actually be the well-established CA1-CA2 border. With this finding, combined with the aforementioned limitations of seqFISH (Figures 1 and 2), it is important to understand how Shah et al., 2016Shah S. Lubeck E. Zhou W. Cai L. In situ transcription profiling of single cells reveals spatial organization of cells in the mouse hippocampus.Neuron. 2016; 92: 342-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar can resolve even canonical neuronal boundaries (e.g., CA1 versus CA2). The classification reported by Shah et al., 2016Shah S. Lubeck E. Zhou W. Cai L. In situ transcription profiling of single cells reveals spatial organization of cells in the mouse hippocampus.Neuron. 2016; 92: 342-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar emerges from the combined results of two different hybridization approaches: combinatorial seqFISH barcoded genes and individual non-barcoded genes. The non-barcoded genes, detected in a single round of hybridization, are used to target higher abundance genes not necessarily amenable to seqFISH. Identification of the CA2-CA1 border above, for example, was aided by a non-barcoded higher abundance gene (Amigo2) previously known to be restricted to CA2 pyramidal cells. The only other conventional neuronal boundary recapitulated by Shah et al., 2016Shah S. Lubeck E. Zhou W. Cai L. In situ transcription profiling of single cells reveals spatial organization of cells in the mouse hippocampus.Neuron. 2016; 92: 342-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, between the granule cell layer and the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus (Figure 4 in Shah et al., 2016Shah S. Lubeck E. Zhou W. Cai L. In situ transcription profiling of single cells reveals spatial organization of cells in the mouse hippocampus.Neuron. 2016; 92: 342-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), also employed non-barcoded marker genes known to distinguish between these two regions. Here, this spatial partition reflects the division between mature and immature granule cells, and several known markers for immature neurons (e.g., Sox2 and Dcx) and mature granule cells (e.g., Calb1) were included in the non-seqFISH genes. Thus, the broad cell-type divisions identified by Shah et al., 2016Shah S. Lubeck E. Zhou W. Cai L. In situ transcription profiling of single cells reveals spatial organization of cells in the mouse hippocampus.Neuron. 2016; 92: 342-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar may be primarily driven by non-barcoded genes rather than being determined by the seqFISH technique itself. Reinforcing this, non-barcoded genes are associated with >70% of the transcript counts underlying cellular classification (Figure 3 in Shah et al., 2016Shah S. Lubeck E. Zhou W. Cai L. In situ transcription profiling of single cells reveals spatial organization of cells in the mouse hippocampus.Neuron. 2016; 92: 342-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) despite comprising only 20% of the total number of targeted genes (n = 25/125). Given that even the combination of non-seqFISH and seqFISH approaches still did not recapitulate foundational cellular taxonomies (Figure 2), it remains unclear whether seqFISH can provide insight into the spatial organization of brain regions. New methodologies like seqFISH have the potential to provide fundamental insight to neuroscience. However, conclusions from emerging techniques should always be considered in the context of other available data. This is especially critical due to the multiscale nature of the brain, which can be analyzed at many levels of abstraction. These levels span molecules, cells, and circuits, and each spatial scale contributes to an understanding of the nervous system. As a consequence, no single methodology in neuroscience will suffice as a definitive classifier; rather, a well-defined neuronal taxonomy should incorporate these various levels of abstraction into a coherent description of cell types. As new technologies emerge, cross-validation with existing methods and datasets will be a critical step toward generating a unified multimodal depiction of brain structure and function.

https://openalex.org/W2616373944,"Evaluating the genetic contribution of individuals to population structure is essential to select informative individuals for genome sequencing, genotype imputation and to ascertain complex population structures. Existing methods for the selection of informative individuals for genomic imputation solely focus on the identification of key ancestors, which can lead to a loss of phasing accuracy of the reference population. Currently many methods are independently applied to investigate complex population structures. Based on the Eigenvalue Decomposition (EVD) of a genomic relationship matrix we describe a novel approach to evaluate the genetic contribution of individuals to population structure. We combined the identification of key contributors with model-based clustering and population network visualization into an integrated three-step approach, which allows identification of high-resolution population structures and substructures around such key contributors. The approach was applied and validated in four disparate datasets including a simulated population (5,100 individuals and 10,000 SNPs), a highly structured experimental sheep population (1,421 individuals and 44,693 SNPs) and two large complex pedigree populations namely horse (1,077 individuals and 38,124 SNPs) and cattle (2,457 individuals and 45,765 SNPs). In the simulated and experimental sheep dataset, our method, which is unsupervised, successfully identified all known key contributors. Applying our three-step approach to the horse and cattle populations, we observed high-resolution population substructures including the absence of obvious important key contributors. Furthermore, we show that compared to commonly applied strategies to select informative individuals for genotype imputation including the computation of marginal gene contributions (Pedig) and the optimization of genetic relatedness (Rel), the selection of key contributors provided the highest phasing accuracies within the selected reference populations. The presented approach opens new perspectives in the characterization and informed management of populations in general, and in areas such as conservation genetics and selective animal breeding in particular, where assessing the genetic contribution of influential and admixed individuals is crucial for research and management applications. As such, this method provides a valuable complement to common applied tools to visualize complex population structures and to select individuals for re-sequencing."
https://openalex.org/W2615967180,"Background Recent studies indicated that eating behaviors are under genetic influence, and the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) gene polymorphisms can affect the total energy intake and the consumption of fat, protein and carbohydrates. Our study aims at investigating the association of the MC4R polymorphism with appetite and food intake among Chinese children. Methods A family-based association study was conducted among 151 Chinese trios whose offsprings were overweight/obese children aged 9–15 years. The rs12970134 near MC4R was genotyped, and the Children Eating Behavior Questionnaire (CEBQ) and a self-designed questionnaire measuring food intake were performed. The FBAT and PBAT software packages were used. Results The family-based association analysis showed that there was a significant association between rs12970134 and obesity (Z = 2.449, P = 0.014). After adjusting for age, gender and standardized BMI, rs12970134 was significantly associated with food responsiveness (FR) among children (β'b = 0.077, Pb = 0.028), and with satiety responsiveness (SR) in trios (P = -0.026). The polymorphism was associated with beverage intake (β'b = 0.331, Pb = 0.00016 in children; P = 0.043 in trios), but not significantly associated with vegetable, fruit or meat intake (P>0.050). We further found a significant mediation effect among the rs12970134, FR and beverage intake (b = 0.177, P = 0.047). Conclusions Our study is the first to report that rs12970134 near MC4R was associated with appetite and beverage intake, and food responsiveness could mediate the effect of rs12970134 on beverage intake in overweight and obese Chinese children population. Further studies are needed to uncover the genetic basis for eating behaviors, which could lead to develop and implement effective interventional strategies early in life."

In contrast to the idea that tau phosphorylation is toxic, Ittner et al., 2016Ittner A. Chua S.W. Bertz J. Volkerling A. van der Hoven J. Gladbach A. Przybyla M. Bi M. van Hummel A. Stevens C.H. et al.Science. 2016; 354: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar recently showed that specific tau phosphorylation is neuroprotective, phenocopying tau ablation (DeVos et al., 2017DeVos S.L.

Med. 2017; 9: eaag0481Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), thus highlighting the complex tau biology that underlies neurotoxicity and neuroprotection. Tau phosphorylation is typically associated with a toxic phenotype, as neurofibrillary tangles are extensively hyperphosphorylated in post-mortem human Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain tissue and tangles are associated with neuronal death (Gómez-Isla et al., 1997Gómez-Isla T. Hollister R. West H. Mui S. Growdon J.H. Petersen R.C. Parisi J.E. Hyman B.T. Ann. Neurol. 1997; 41: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). It has long been debated whether hyperphosphorylation of tau leads to a toxic gain of function or a loss of function. In their 2016 Science paper, Ittner et al., 2016Ittner A. Chua S.W. Bertz J. Volkerling A. van der Hoven J. Gladbach A. Przybyla M. Bi M. van Hummel A. Stevens C.H. et al.Science. 2016; 354: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar show a unique mechanism through which the phosphorylation of a specific residue of tau—Threonine 205—is important for protection against amyloid-β-induced excitotoxicity. In this regard, phosphorylation of tau is neuroprotective. These data are reminiscent of data from multiple labs that tau knockout or knockdown is also neuroprotective against excitotoxicty and amyloid-β-induced spine loss. An elegant series of experiments revealed the molecular events that ultimately led to the observation of pT205 tau-associated neuroprotection. Since the kinase p38 had previously been implicated in hyperexcitability in APP-overexpressing mice, seizures were induced chemically using the GABA antagonist pentylenetetrazol in p38α, p38β, p38γ, or p38δ knockout mice, with only a deletion in p38γ, resulting in an increase in seizure severity. Interestingly, p38γ was found to localize to the post-synapse, sparing the pre-synaptic terminals. To understand this unique role of p38γ in the context of amyloid-β deposition and previously reported hyperexcitability (Ittner et al., 2010Ittner L.M. Ke Y.D. Delerue F. Bi M. Gladbach A. van Eersel J. Wölfing H. Chieng B.C. Christie M.J. Napier I.A. et al.Cell. 2010; 142: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar), the AD mouse model APP23 was placed onto a p38γ knockout background, and as predicted, excitotoxicity was exacerbated when p38γ was deleted. Additionally, APP23 × p38γ−/− mice displayed shortened survival and decreased cognitive abilities. Ittner and colleagues then asked how this may relate to the previously shown protection that results when tau is deleted in the APP23 model (Ittner et al., 2010Ittner L.M. Ke Y.D. Delerue F. Bi M. Gladbach A. van Eersel J. Wölfing H. Chieng B.C. Christie M.J. Napier I.A. et al.Cell. 2010; 142: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). Even when p38γ is deleted, if there is no tau, survival and cognitive deficits are completely restored in APP23 mice. When endogenous tau is deleted in non-amyloid-containing p38γ knockouts, seizure severity is significantly reduced. Conversely, when tau is overexpressed, seizures are intensified in the setting of no p38γ expression. Together, these experiments suggest that p38γ—unlike its other p38 counterparts—is crucial in regulating amyloid-β-induced excitotoxicity and general seizure susceptibility downstream of tau expression. Ittner et al., 2016Ittner A. Chua S.W. Bertz J. Volkerling A. van der Hoven J. Gladbach A. Przybyla M. Bi M. van Hummel A. Stevens C.H. et al.Science. 2016; 354: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar then delve into the mechanism through which p38γ may be leading to this protective effect. In p38γ knockout mice, both naive and crossed to the APP23 model, there is a significant increase in interaction between tau and the protein post-synaptic density 95 (PSD-95), the kinase fyn (previously linked with tau and hyperexcitability; Ittner et al., 2010Ittner L.M. Ke Y.D. Delerue F. Bi M. Gladbach A. van Eersel J. Wölfing H. Chieng B.C. Christie M.J. Napier I.A. et al.Cell. 2010; 142: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar), and NMDA receptor subunits. This increased PSD-95/tau/fyn/NMDA receptor interaction in the absence of p38γ is alternatively ablated when p38γ is engineered to be constitutively active, providing strong evidence that the presence of p38γ allows for the dissolution of an established post-synaptic complex that may be involved in neuronal hyperexcitability. As a kinase, p38γ is capable of phosphorylating tau at a number of residues, so as a logical next step, Ittner et al., 2016Ittner A. Chua S.W. Bertz J. Volkerling A. van der Hoven J. Gladbach A. Przybyla M. Bi M. van Hummel A. Stevens C.H. et al.Science. 2016; 354: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar turned toward studying the role of these different phospho-tau epitopes and how they may impact some of the main functional readouts—seizure severity and cognition. Using a combination of mass spectroscopy and western blot analyses, Ittner et al., 2016Ittner A. Chua S.W. Bertz J. Volkerling A. van der Hoven J. Gladbach A. Przybyla M. Bi M. van Hummel A. Stevens C.H. et al.Science. 2016; 354: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar found one major site—pT205—that was specifically phosphorylated in the presence of p38γ. Further studies revealed tau T205 as the individual site through which fyn either directly interacts with tau (dephosphorylated at T205) or dissociates from tau (phosphorylated at T205), resulting in an increase in seizure severity when T205 is unable to be phosphorylated and a decrease in seizures when T205 is pseudophosphorylated. Cognition and neuronal network synchrony were restored in the AD APP23 mouse model by injecting an AAV expressing the constitutively active form of p38γ, presumably via the site-specific phosphorylation of tau at T205. While the Ittner et al., 2016Ittner A. Chua S.W. Bertz J. Volkerling A. van der Hoven J. Gladbach A. Przybyla M. Bi M. van Hummel A. Stevens C.H. et al.Science. 2016; 354: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar paper focuses primarily on one phosphorylation residue, the protein tau has dozens of phosphorylation sites, so it is not surprising that phosphorylation of tau is used to physiologically regulate certain functions of tau. Tau is dynamically phosphorylated and dephosphorylated at certain residues—such as Ser214, Thr231, and Ser262—to trigger tau binding with microtubules along axons in healthy neurons (Wang and Mandelkow, 2016Wang Y. Mandelkow E. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2016; 17: 5-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and, similar to the Ittner et al., 2016Ittner A. Chua S.W. Bertz J. Volkerling A. van der Hoven J. Gladbach A. Przybyla M. Bi M. van Hummel A. Stevens C.H. et al.Science. 2016; 354: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar paper, phosphorylation of tau at sites Ser212/Thr214, Ser202/Thr205, and Thr231 reduced the direct interaction of tau with the PSD-95/Fyn-kinase complex (Mondragón-Rodríguez et al., 2012Mondragón-Rodríguez S.

In both of these examples, it is clear that phosphorylation of tau at specific sites occur under normal conditions. These results also bring to mind substantial evidence that genetic ablation of tau, or knockdown of the endogenous tau gene therapeutically, also leads to protection from Aβ-induced spine loss and from excitotoxicity (DeVos et al., 2013DeVos S.L.

Moreover, both human and mouse tau reduction protects against neurodegeneration in the setting of mutant human tau overexpression (DeVos et al., 2017DeVos S.L. Miller R.L. Schoch K.M. Holmes B.B.

In the context of human tau aggregation, lowering total expression of tau was not only capable of preventing and reversing tau pathology, but survival was significantly extended and neuronal loss abrogated (DeVos et al., 2017DeVos S.L. Miller R.L. Schoch K.M. Holmes B.B. Kebodeaux C.S. Wegener A.J. Chen G. Shen T. Tran H. Nichols B. et al.Sci. Transl. Med. 2017; 9: eaag0481Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). These results open the door toward multiple complementary therapeutic approaches: targeting tau with antibodies (Nobuhara et al., 2017Nobuhara C.K. DeVos S.L. Commins C. Wegmann S. Moore B.D.

Med. 2017; 9: eaag0481Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) or gene therapy with zinc finger or CRISPR-cas9, or, theoretically, by applying knowledge of specific post-translational modifications that mimic the protective tau null phenotype. It is still unknown whether lowering total levels of the tau protein will be safe in humans. Some groups have reported detrimental phenotypes in the genetic tau knockout mice (Lei et al., 2012Lei P. Ayton S. Finkelstein D.I. Spoerri L. Ciccotosto G.D. Wright D.K. Wong B.X.W. Adlard P.A. Cherny R.A. Lam L.Q. et al.Nat. Med. 2012; 18: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), providing some level of caution for the total lowering of the protein. As an alternative to targeting total expression, one could begin to imagine a circumstance in which certain post-translational modifications of tau, such as phosphorylation of T205, creates a reversible loss-of-function phenotype without altering other protein functions. Such a model suggests a complex differential interactome of tau based on its phosphorylation state and cellular context, as well as the presence of toxic environments, such as Abeta, tangles, or seizures. The Ittner results and the recent studies of tau ablation provide an intriguing window into the complex biology of soluble tau and its relationship with neurotoxicity and neuroprotection."

Here, we discuss our experiences in the communication of the science of early childhood and brain development and our recommendations to help neuroscientists better communicate the benefits of their research to those who make practice and policy decisions. There is no need to convince the readers of Neuron that science matters and that research can shape reality. However, a perception is taking hold among non-scientists that research findings are capricious, uncertain, and of little value to those who make decisions about policy and practice—decisions that will affect all of us for generations (Aschwanden, 2016Aschwanden, C. (2016). Failure is moving science forward. FiveThirtyEight, https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/failure-is-moving-science-forward/.Google Scholar, The Economist, 2013The Economist (2013). Unreliable research: Trouble at the lab. http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21588057-scientists-think-science-self-correcting-alarming-degree-it-not-trouble.Google Scholar). There are long-standing debates in the neuroscientific community about reproducibility and the inherent problems posed by biological systems. These are discussions that we hold among ourselves and that are meant to spur critical thinking about improving the scientific process (Ioannidis, 2014Ioannidis J.P.A. PLoS Med. 2014; 11: e1001747Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, Landis et al., 2012Landis S.C. Amara S.G. Asadullah K. Austin C.P. Blumenstein R. Bradley E.W. Crystal R.G. Darnell R.B.

Here, however, we focus on efforts by neuroscientists to reach beyond their peers—to policymakers, service providers, and members of the public. Most science communications activities typically focus on education (such as promoting cognitive and neuroscientific research during Brain Awareness Week); fixing nervous system-based diseases (through, for example, patient and scientist advocacy); institutional and self-promotion of discoveries (via outreach to the lay press); and advocating for more financial support of research (via outreach to governments and foundations). Our professional societies promote these activities, and they are worthy of continued effort. Yet, there is an enormous gap between what we know about the power of neuroscience to spark substantive societal change and what we do with neuroscience research to inform policymakers, practitioners, and members of the public. The responsibility for addressing this gap falls to two groups of experts: those who conduct the science and those who work on communicating it. The experts who comprise these groups typically do not overlap; indeed, they have few opportunities to meet, interact, and work with each other. Yet, both groups rely on the same research findings to advance and apply knowledge. When these two groups work together, they are better able to improve policy and social outcomes. We share our collective experience and expertise in the science of child and brain development and in the science of communications to stimulate more action in science-informed policy-making. The rationale for ramping up these activities has been well articulated in recent commentaries (Holt, 2017Holt R. Science. 2017; 355: 551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, Stokstad, 2017Stokstad E. Science. 2017; 355: 572PubMed Google Scholar) and declarations (Kazatchkine et al., 2017Kazatchkine M. Kinderlerer J. Gilligan A. Brito L. Hartung T. O’Hara K. Peterson D.B. Robertson R. Euroscientist Journal. 2017; : 2-32Google Scholar) and by our colleagues (Shonkoff and Bales, 2011Shonkoff J.P. Bales S.N. Child Dev. 2011; 82: 17-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Who is in the best position to influence policy outcomes? One key group comprises the elected officials who are responsible for enacting and implementing programs that impact health, education, and quality of life. Policymakers at the local, state, and federal levels make influential decisions on an almost daily basis. But influencing policy requires reaching beyond this group. We must include others who can influence decisions, such as business leaders, service providers in health, education, and human welfare, advocates, and, importantly, members of the public. Effective science communications can create new partnerships among members of these disparate groups and advance science’s ability to enrich and improve the quality of life for all people. Science identifies core causal processes in an effort to improve outcomes. But scientists also need to engage in research that sheds light on the solutions that are effective in addressing these causal processes and point stakeholders to specific solutions approaches. The effectiveness of specific solutions depends on the unique characteristics of a given community. Equally salient in affecting positive change are the cultural values that impact belief systems, the available resources in a given community to drive change, the presence of scientists who can communicate the essential features of an issue that needs to be addressed, and the factors that create effective solutions. Thus, in addition to asking for more money to support our work, scientists need to cultivate a greater recognition of the value of science and encourage its use in advancing societal benefits. The good news is that we don’t have to guess how to do this. We can use science. We have a successful track record in approaching this problem in an interdisciplinary fashion. Neuroscience is, by definition, a discipline that reflects the very best of interdisciplinary collaboration. In 2003, the National Scientific Council on the Developing Child (NSCDC) and the FrameWorks Institute, a multidisciplinary team of social scientists, took a unique approach to science translation and mobilization that drew on both the science of child and brain development and the science of communication (Shonkoff, 2014Shonkoff J.P. A Decade of Science Informing Policy: The Story of the National Scientific Council on the Developing Child. Center for the Developing Child at Harvard University, 2014Google Scholar, Shonkoff, 2016Shonkoff J.P. From Best Practices to Breakthrough Impacts: A Science-Based Approach for Building a More Promising Future for Young Children and Families. Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University, 2016Google Scholar). For nearly two decades, we have been working to translate the science of early childhood development to inform policy and practice. This work has shown that by using careful and evidence-based communications, science can influence policy by orienting stakeholders to the powerful effect of early experience on lifelong health, education, and productivity. In the process of communicating this science, we have found that it is essential to avoid overreach. That is, we learned to accept the reality that the way we use science to develop programs and solutions will vary depending on the context in which it is being used and the problems that are being addressed. Learning how to successfully communicate complex neuroscience is not simple. It turns out that simply using shorter sentences and smaller words does not work. Scientists tend to modify statements of fact, using phrases like “may show,” “perhaps meaning,” or “could be.” These terms diminish the confidence that non-scientists have in the certainty or even the validity of what they are hearing. The NSCDC was founded to bring together the best, most robust evidence (that is, to determine what is and what is not “ready for prime time”) from developmental neuroscience, psychology, health, and economics and to make this knowledge available to those who make decisions about programs targeting early brain and child development. The council was put together by Jack Shonkoff (director of the Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University). It emerged from his experiences as a member of the MacArthur Research Network on Early Experience and Brain Development and as co-chair of a National Academy of Science advisory board that assembled a National Research Council and Institute of Medicine book on the topic of the science of early childhood development (Phillips and Shonkoff, 2000Phillips D. Shonkoff J.P. From Neurons to Neighborhoods: The Science of Early Childhood Development. National Academies Press, 2000Google Scholar). Since its inception, council members have actively researched developmental neuroscience and plasticity, developmental psychology, neuroendocrinology, pediatrics, immunology, and economics. Early on, the council established a set of working principles, which have been key to its success. First, members collaborate, without individual credit, to develop open-access products (such as working papers, briefs, and videos; http://developingchild.harvard.edu/) to translate the science of child and brain development for non-experts. All information is designed for non-scientists, but the council’s communications strategy targets policymakers, and particularly those at the state level. The rationale is that state-level policymakers have more freedom to shape policy than their federal counterparts. Another important principle is to not rely solely on literature reviews. Instead, the council invites outside experts to educate members and participate in discussions about communications challenges and strategies. A third important principle: the council does not venture into topics that are far beyond its members’ collective expertise or on which scientific consensus is thin or tenuous. For example, the council was on solid ground in conceptualizing the policy implications of early childhood and brain science, but it stopped short of recommending specific programs to policymakers. Harvard’s Center on the Developing Child assembled other groups, such as the National Forum on Early Childhood Policy and Programs, to evaluate the effectiveness of intervention programs. Council members have expertise in neuroscience and child development and stick to their mission: to communicate the science behind why early experience, good or bad, has such a profound effect on brain development, lifelong mental and physical health, and quality of life outcomes (Shonkoff and Levitt, 2010Shonkoff J.P. Levitt P. Neuron. 2010; 67: 689-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Finally, council members decided early on to prioritize communications. As a result, council members engaged social scientists at FrameWorks at and between meetings. FrameWorks researchers provided qualitative and quantitative research findings about the effectiveness (and ineffectiveness) of specific framing strategies in communicating the core principles of developmental neuroscience and child development to policymakers and the public. In other words, most scientists, even though they may have the best of intentions, will, when left to their own devices, unintentionally feed into myths and cultural beliefs about early childhood that halt the conversation, often before it even gets going, about how to use science findings in the policy arena. Humans think in stories. The well-known studies of psychologists Fritz Heider and Marianne Simmel (Heider and Simmel, 1944Heider F. Simmel M. Am. J. Psychol. 1944; 57: 243-259Crossref Google Scholar) reflect this fundamental feature of cognition. We also know that science can help us better understand how the world works and how to improve individual and societal outcomes. At a time when ideology divides the country and politics polarizes the population, there is an even greater need to tell science stories. Science transcends ideology and identity politics and focuses people’s attention on issues, their causes and consequences, and solutions. Whether in agreement with a particular policy or not, it is clear that public policies structure society. Policies determine who gets resources and who doesn’t; which issues get addressed and which don’t; and which approaches to improving social wellbeing are employed and which are eschewed. In a working democracy, public will shapes policy; it creates room for and puts pressure on decision makers to make certain choices. Public understanding of social problems, and support for solutions to them, is shaped by the way that these problems are framed—how information about them is presented and contextualized over time in the public discourse. This is a critical concept regarding communicating science. Policy decisions are driven by ways that science frames intersect with cultural beliefs and values. The study of social movements, whether for civil rights, marriage equality, tobacco control, or healthy child development, shows that frames play a powerful role in building public will, increasing support for solutions, and fomenting engagement—all the ingredients for deep and lasting social change (Benford and Snow, 2000Benford R.D. Snow D.A. Annu. Rev. Sociol. 2000; 26: 611-639Crossref Scopus (5426) Google Scholar, McAdam et al., 1996McAdam D. McCarthy J.D. Zald M.N. Comparative perspectives on social movements: Political opportunities, mobilizing structures, and cultural framings. Cambridge University Press, 1996Crossref Google Scholar) A growing body of research shows that frames affect people’s understanding of social issues and their support for solutions (Benford and Snow, 2000Benford R.D. Snow D.A. Annu. Rev. Sociol. 2000; 26: 611-639Crossref Scopus (5426) Google Scholar). In addition to this growing body of evidence, an increasing number of examples illustrate the role and importance of framing in creating social change. The movement for marriage equality (Nix, 2015Nix, K. (2015). It’s all in the frame: winning marriage equality in America. openDemocracy, https://www.opendemocracy.net/openglobalrights/kevin-nix/it%E2%80%99s-all-in-frame-winning-marriage-equality-in-america.Google Scholar) offers one recent example. Advocates initially positioned this issue as a way to grant the LGBT community the legal right to marry. When this frame failed to move the issue, advocates reframed it in terms of love and commitment—and gained ground. The movement for marriage equality was, of course, a complex and long-term advocacy effort. But the powerful effect of this reframe is now well accepted. We have witnessed the power of framing in our own field. Initially, the public discussion about programs to support early childhood development centered on the vulnerability of children. The council, with guidance from FrameWorks, reframed the debate around the value of future prosperity—the idea that society will prosper in the future if children’s development is supported today. We believe this reframe is one reason behind the growing investments in early childhood development programs in many states. Reframing this important issue—by abandoning a moral appeal to protect vulnerable children and adopting a new one about boosting future prosperity—has proven effective. Employing science to explain how development happens and what factors threaten it was another key part of effectively reframing to boost support for solutions. The communications roadblocks were numerous. They include the “Family Bubble” (the widespread belief that children’s outcomes are determined almost exclusively by parents), which halts conversations about broader community and policymaker responsibilities for child outcomes; the uniquely American concept of “Rugged Individualism,” which impacts how to communicate the science of resilience (that is, if individuals are either strong or weak, how can they become more resilient?); and a view of children as either “good” or “bad” seeds, which feeds a deterministic concept of development and a malignant sense of fatalism around solutions. Explanation is a key part of framing. Scientists need skills to effectively explain their work and how it can be used to better understand social issues and innovate new solutions to society’s most challenging problems. In this way, science translation is an essential part of a healthy democracy; it helps the public understand social problems and analyze proposed solutions. The explanatory power of science, communicated via effective frames, can rise above political arguments and seed a healthier debate about how to best use policy and programs to address social problems. An important caveat: not any type of explanation will do. Explaining research findings in the way that scientists do to other scientists doesn’t work—and often backfires. For example, FrameWorks research on translating climate and ocean change science finds that framing messages through the value of “Science Authority”—the idea that change is necessary because scientific research proves the urgency of the problem—did not boost public support for policies needed to address climate change. Other frames around the importance of protecting the future of our society, however, successfully increased public support for these types of policies. Scientists need to understand that, when it comes to informing policy and practice, their audience is not other scientists. Who is it, then? It is policymakers, practitioners, service providers, and members of the public—groups that do not have detailed understanding of scientific concepts. Collaborating with those who investigate cultural and social domains can help neuroscientists reimagine their roles as communicators and rethink the ways in which they communicate. Becoming excellent communicators of science to other scientists is, of course, a core focus in most neuroscience training programs. But neuroscientists need to go beyond that. We can and should train scientists to effectively communicate with non-scientists. Fortunately, this is becoming an important area for training expansion (Walsh, 2015Walsh K.M. New York Academy of Science Magazine. 2015; (Published online October 6, 2015, http://www.nyas.org/Publications/Detail.aspx?cid=d77626ca-e830-47da-a546-7fbeab1846f1)Google Scholar). The Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science at Stony Brook University, for example, is advancing this mission. We believe that by having success stories that we can tell about using science to make research-informed policy will not only positively impact society, but also enhance the reputation and value of the scientific endeavor. The following recommendations (Figure 1) have emerged over nearly two decades of research into productive ways to communicate the science of early child and brain development for policymakers and the public. These concepts can be applied broadly and can assist scientists in communicating their work and spark a deeper conversation about the role of science in society. We often assume that our audiences think like we do and that what works to convince us as scientists will work in the same way and to the same degree with those outside of our discipline. The fallacy and danger of this assumption is clear: the vast majority of people do not understand brain and early childhood science the way that we do. But changing communications practice is more difficult than it seems. Scientists tend to over rely on data when communicating about the applications and social significance of their work. This approach may convince fellow scientists of the validity of a causal argument or the effectiveness of an intervention, but it won’t have the same effect with policymakers and the public. This is not to say that facts don’t belong in science communications; they do. We advise scientists to think of their messages as stories. Describing an experiment and providing data can play a role in these stories—they can even be a key plot element—but they are not the story. Facts need to be framed; effective communications use frame elements, such as values, metaphors, and discussions of solutions, to enable our audiences to think about and interpret our data and understand what they mean in the real world. Today’s popular post-truth, alternative-fact memes overlook the important role that facts play in communications. They are an essential part of effective explanation—so long as they are well framed. Values are cultural beliefs and ideals like fairness, justice, and equality of opportunity. Our research shows that framing messages around values helps people understand why a social problem matters. Framing a message around the value of justice (addressing a given social issue is important because it will help ensure that all people are treated fairly) or human potential (taking on a given issue matters because it will ensure that all people can reach their full potential) helps people access and apply science-based explanations of social problems and solutions. In our work on translating the science of early childhood development, we have found that the values of innovation (we can apply our society’s ingenuity to come up with better solutions to children’s issues) and future prosperity (doing a better job of supporting children is integral to our progress and future success as a society) provide a way for policymakers, business leaders, service providers, and members of the public to engage in science messages and move thinking in positive directions. These values, in other words, help people see why the issue matters. In contrast, using the value of vulnerability (that children deserve more support because they are society’s most vulnerable members) fails to move public thinking (as discussed above) and, in some cases, depresses support for key policies and programs. Using vulnerability as a value invites people to “other” populations—drawing distinctions between “us” and “them” and making public policies that address social issues seem like more for “them” and less for “us.” Using vulnerability as a leading frame also encourages people to employ a fatalistic understanding in which once damage is done, there is little that can be done to meaningfully address it. Research tells us that metaphors have unique power to clarify and explain core scientific concepts. They are highly effective in helping people understand how complex scientific issues work. We have seen this time and time again in our work to develop an evidence-based strategy to communicate the science of early childhood development. Comparing the developing brain to the construction of a house (“brain architecture”) helps people understand the powerful influence of early experiences in building a strong neurological foundation and that development happens in a sequential process. Comparing the interactions between a child and his or her caregiver to the back and forth in a game of tennis or volleyball (“serve-and-return”) helps people understand how positive interactions with supportive caregivers are major drivers of healthy brain and child development. The metaphor emphasizes the critical importance of social relationships in the process of brain development and makes it easier to discuss the intertwined nature of social, emotional, and cognitive development (“weaving skill ropes”). Using the metaphorical language of toxicity to describe the biological effects of stress on the developing body and brain (“toxic stress”) helps people understand how chronic, severe stress undermines healthy development. Metaphors like these bring science out of the lab and into the public discourse. But, as with explanation, not any metaphor will do. Metaphors that work with scientists may not be effective with policymakers or other non-scientists. Metaphors are a key explanatory device, but we must use an empirical process to select the most effective ones. Collaborating with social and cultural scientists is vital. It matters more than ever to use neuroscience to improve policy and public understanding of how social issues work and what needs to be done to effectively address them. In our view, scientists need to stay committed to their public roles as explainers. The science of communications can help ensure that neuroscientists are successful in this role and able to effectively drive public discourse and policy in positive directions. When it works, it really works. Our work, and that of our colleagues in early childhood and brain development, is committed to the project of science translation and the power of a two-science approach that draws on both neuroscience and communications science. Neuroscientists will drive public support and political will for investment in science if we demonstrate to the public and to those in decision-making positions the power that scientific research has in solving society’s most pressing challenges.

Nervous system assembly during development depends in large part on conserved, pre-programmed genetic plans, and when these go awry, defects in neural circuit organization can lead to profound pathological consequences. Since the time of Santiago Ramón y Cajal, neuroscientists have speculated about the cellular, and more recently molecular, mechanisms by which complex neural circuits are sequentially constructed throughout development. A wide range of experimental strategies have yielded the identity of secreted and membrane-associated molecules essential for the elaboration of complex axonal and dendritic trajectories that establish the myriad circuits in all nervous systems. These include proteins belonging to four major protein families of classical guidance cues: netrins, ephrins, slits, and semaphorins, several members of which exhibit specific expression patterns in the developing nervous system that serve to organize neural connections (Kolodkin and Tessier-Lavigne, 2011Kolodkin A.L. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2011; 3: 3Crossref Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Here, we describe new findings regarding the axon guidance cue netrin-1 that alter our understanding of how axon trajectories at the central nervous system (CNS) midline are established. The role of netrin family members in axon guidance was first appreciated in C. elegans over 25 years ago (Lai Wing Sun et al., 2011Lai Wing Sun K. Correia J.P. Kennedy T.E. Development. 2011; 138: 2153-2169Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In Unc-6 mutants (netrin-1 was subsequently identified as a mammalian Unc-6 ortholog), axons from several neuronal classes fail to properly extend along the worm’s dorsal-ventral axis, and subsets of neurons also display migration defects. Unc-6 was found to be a secreted protein that contains structural similarity to the extracellular matrix protein laminin. A functional screen for factors capable of influencing vertebrate dorsal spinal cord axon guidance led to the discovery of the vertebrate Unc-6 ortholog, netrin-1. In both the spinal cord and hindbrain, cells located in the floor plate at the CNS midline, the location where crossing axons extend to the contralateral side of the CNS, express very high levels of netrin-1 (Figure 1A). Remarkably, it was observed in mice harboring a strong hypomorphic netrin-1 allele that netrin-1 is essential for axons from dorsally located spinal cord commissural neurons, which grow ventrally toward the CNS midline, to reach the floor plate and also for the formation of several brain commissures, including the corpus callosum, fornix, and the anterior commissure (Lai Wing Sun et al., 2011Lai Wing Sun K. Correia J.P. Kennedy T.E. Development. 2011; 138: 2153-2169Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Netrin-1 can both attract and repel axons in vitro from specific neuronal classes, in line with their in vivo trajectories. Though restricted netrin-1 expression was also observed in a few regions other than the CNS midline, based on netrin-1’s very strong expression at the CNS midline, its effects on axons from different neural subtypes in in vitro assays, and the robust commissural axon guidance phenotypes observed in netrin-1 mouse mutants, it was hypothesized that netrin is secreted by floor plate cells and that the resulting gradient of netrin attracts commissural axons to the CNS midline in the spinal cord and brain. Following these seminal studies, intense examination of netrins in both vertebrates and invertebrates revealed the importance of these cues in the establishment of many neural circuits (Lai Wing Sun et al., 2011Lai Wing Sun K. Correia J.P. Kennedy T.E. Development. 2011; 138: 2153-2169Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Extensive work defining netrin-1 receptors revealed how the expression of netrin holoreceptor components influences attractive and repulsive netrin-mediated guidance (Kolodkin and Tessier-Lavigne, 2011Kolodkin A.L. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2011; 3: 3Crossref Scopus (436) Google Scholar). However, it is still unclear how a netrin-1 gradient might be established in vivo to guide growing axons. Indeed, in the initial analysis of embryonic spinal cord commissural axon guidance by netrin-1, it was proposed that a guidance cue gradient resulting from secreted netrin-1 produced at the floor plate could be formed by either the immediate sequestration of secreted netrin-1 on the cell surface (i.e., haptotaxis) or the free diffusion of netrin-1 through developing tissue near the floor plate (Kennedy et al., 1994Kennedy T.E. Serafini T. de la Torre J.R. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1994; 78: 425-435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). Since these early findings, many studies have demonstrated that netrin-1 can freely diffuse in vitro to establish a directional gradient for growing axons (Lai Wing Sun et al., 2011Lai Wing Sun K. Correia J.P. Kennedy T.E. Development. 2011; 138: 2153-2169Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Together, these findings led to the view that in vivo a gradient of netrin-1 from the CNS midline promotes attraction of midline crossing axons. However, there are a few hints that suggest that long-range diffusion of netrin-1 might not be necessary for all of its guidance functions in vivo. During embryonic neural development in Drosophila netrin mutants, the severe CNS guidance defects observed in axons that normally cross the CNS midline can be rescued by providing a membrane-tethered form of netrin, suggesting that diffusion of netrin from the midline is not required for axon attraction to the midline (Brankatschk and Dickson, 2006Brankatschk M. Dickson B.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Similarly, in the developing fly visual system, membrane-tethered netrin is also sufficient to rescue photoreceptor axon guidance defects in netrin mutants (Timofeev et al., 2012Timofeev K. Joly W. Hadjieconomou D. Salecker I. Neuron. 2012; 75: 80-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar); however, here netrin is not required to attract axons but rather to stabilize them through contact-mediated adhesive interactions at the source of netrin expression (Akin and Zipursky, 2016Akin O. Zipursky S.L. eLife. 2016; 5: 5Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, Timofeev et al., 2012Timofeev K. Joly W. Hadjieconomou D. Salecker I. Neuron. 2012; 75: 80-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These and other observations beg the question as to whether or not diffusion from a focal netrin source is required for long-range axon guidance. Two research groups (Dominici et al., 2017Dominici C. Moreno-Bravo J.A. Puiggros S.R. Rappeneau Q. Rama N. Vieugue P. Bernet A. Mehlen P. Chédotal A. Nature. 2017; (Published online April 26, 2017)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature22331Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, Varadarajan et al., 2017Varadarajan S.G. Kong J.H. Phan K.D. Kao T.-J.

Neuron. 2017; 94 (this issue): 790-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), using new mouse genetic tools, independently sought to assess commissural neuron axon extension toward and across the midline in the spinal cord and hindbrain in the mouse. In both the spinal cord and hindbrain, netrin-1 is highly expressed by cells in the floor plate and also by neural progenitors in the middle region of the developing CNS (Figure 1A). The cell bodies of these neural progenitors line the ventricles and spinal canal, and they have long processes that attach to the pial surface in a radial fashion. Netrin-1 produced by these progenitors in both the spinal cord and the hindbrain is most likely transported along these radial processes to the pial surface, where robust netrin-1 protein was also observed (Figure 1A). Both groups make strikingly similar findings by utilizing conditional netrin-1 alleles and various Cre recombinase-expressing mouse lines to selectively ablate netrin-1 from specific locations in the developing mouse embryo, building on previous work showing that genetic ablation of the floor plate does not prevent commissural axon extension toward and across the CNS midline (Charron et al., 2003Charron F. Stein E. Jeong J. McMahon A.P. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 2003; 113: 11-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, Matise et al., 1999Matise M.P. Lustig M. Sakurai T. Grumet M. Joyner A.L. Development. 1999; 126: 3649-3659PubMed Google Scholar). As described in this current issue of Neuron, Varadarajan et al., 2017Varadarajan S.G. Kong J.H. Phan K.D. Kao T.-J. Panaitof S.C. Cardin J. Eltzschig H. Kania A. Novitch B.G. Butler S.J. Neuron. 2017; 94 (this issue): 790-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar investigated the response of spinal commissural neurons to the selective loss of netrin-1 either in the floor plate or in netrin-1-expressing VZ neural progenitors. Surprisingly, selective removal of netrin-1 from the floor plate results in no obvious commissural axon guidance phenotypes (Figure 1B). However, upon removal of netrin-1 from the more dorsally located neural progenitors, there is a dramatic reduction in commissural neuron axon extension ventrally toward the CNS midline (Figure 1C). Further, some axons are observed to aberrantly innervate regions of the VZ, where netrin-1-expressing neural progenitors are located. These results are very similar to the original axon guidance defects observed in mice homozygous for the strong hypomorphic netrin-1 allele (Lai Wing Sun et al., 2011Lai Wing Sun K. Correia J.P. Kennedy T.E. Development. 2011; 138: 2153-2169Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) and also more recently generated netrin-1 null mutants (Figure 1D). Published online at Nature, Dominici et al., 2017Dominici C. Moreno-Bravo J.A. Puiggros S.R. Rappeneau Q. Rama N. Vieugue P. Bernet A. Mehlen P. Chédotal A. Nature. 2017; (Published online April 26, 2017)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature22331Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar present similar findings regarding the role of netrin-1 at the midline in the mouse spinal cord and, in addition, in the hindbrain; conditional removal of netrin-1 from the floor plate had no effect on commissural neuron axon extension to, or crossing of, the CNS midline. However, similar to Varadarajan et al., 2017Varadarajan S.G. Kong J.H. Phan K.D. Kao T.-J. Panaitof S.C. Cardin J. Eltzschig H. Kania A. Novitch B.G. Butler S.J. Neuron. 2017; 94 (this issue): 790-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, selective removal of netrin-1 from VZ neural progenitors in the spinal cord and hindbrain phenocopies axon guidance defects observed in netrin-1 mutant mice. Importantly, in both studies, removal of VZ-derived netrin-1 left floor plate netrin-1 expression intact, demonstrating that floor plate-derived netrin-1 alone is not sufficient to guide commissural axons along their trajectory to the CNS midline. Dominici et al., 2017Dominici C. Moreno-Bravo J.A. Puiggros S.R. Rappeneau Q. Rama N. Vieugue P. Bernet A. Mehlen P. Chédotal A. Nature. 2017; (Published online April 26, 2017)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature22331Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar further explored the function of floor plate-derived netrin-1 in the migration of inferior olivary nucleus (ION) neurons toward the hindbrain midline, a netrin-1-dependent migratory event (Bloch-Gallego et al., 1999Bloch-Gallego E. Ezan F. Tessier-Lavigne M. Sotelo C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4407-4420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and they find it is also dispensable for the directed migration of ION neurons toward the CNS midline. Taken together, these two studies demonstrate that a diffusible focal source of netrin-1 at the midline is not required for long-range attraction of commissural axons or migrating hindbrain neurons from lateral regions of the CNS to the CNS midline. Importantly, they establish that expression of netrin-1 in VZ neural progenitors dorsal to the floor plate is critical for commissural axon guidance to the CNS midline. Therefore, these experiments require consideration of more complex modes of netrin-1-mediated commissural axon guidance. How does netrin-1 guide axons ventrally to the CNS midline? Both groups provide compelling evidence suggesting that netrin-1 serves as a short-range haptotactic guidance cue in the region of the netrin-1-expressing VZ neural progenitors. Netrin-1 immunostaining reveals graded netrin-1 expression along the pial surface and an absence of netrin-1 immunostaining within the ventricular zone. These studies show that a critical source of netrin-1 for axon guidance and neuronal migration is the VZ neural progenitor cells, and it is likely that these VZ cells secrete netrin-1 from their endfeet, which are attached to the pial surface and where netrin-1 protein is observed. Consistent with this hypothesis, both groups found that upon netrin-1 removal specifically from the VZ neural progenitors, netrin-1 expression along the pial surface was lost. These observations favor netrin-1 guiding commissural axons at short range toward ventral CNS regions. Interestingly, both studies observe netrin-1 expression along commissural neuron axons. However, since there is no evidence suggesting that commissural neurons themselves express netrin-1, it is apparently sequestered along commissural neuron axons following release by VZ neural progenitors. Both groups provide evidence showing that the netrin-1 receptor DCC is responsible for this axonal netrin-1 sequestration, but its role is at present unclear. Does axonal netrin-1 influence ventral extension of commissural neuron axons, or possibly their fasciculation? These are intriguing possibilities, and additional work using various cell-type-specific gain- and loss-of-function strategies will address the role of commissural neuron netrin-DCC interactions in directing these axons toward the CNS midline. It also remains to be determined whether netrin-1 localization on the pial surface is required for its axon guidance functions. A mouse harboring a conditional membrane-tethered netrin-1 allele could be used to address the requirement for netrin-1 axonal sequestration in commissural neuron axon guidance, limiting netrin-1 to the surface of neural progenitors or to commissural axons. Both studies suggest that the distal processes of neural progenitors release the relevant source of netrin-1 required for ventral axon guidance to the CNS midline, and it will be interesting to determine how netrin-1 is trafficked and released from neural progenitors so as to end up on the pia and on commissural axons. Finally, it is important to determine whether other guidance cue(s) expressed at or near the CNS midline that have been shown to guide commissural axons, including sonic hedgehog (Charron et al., 2003Charron F. Stein E. Jeong J. McMahon A.P. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 2003; 113: 11-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), act either together with netrin-1 or alone to mediate commissural axon guidance to the CNS midline. Over 20 years ago, pioneering work identified netrin-1 as the first phylogenetically conserved axon guidance cue with the capacity to address long-standing models of neuronal process guidance. These studies provided a conceptual framework for understanding axon guidance at the CNS midline. Using new genetic tools, Varadarajan et al., 2017Varadarajan S.G. Kong J.H. Phan K.D. Kao T.-J.

Nature. 2017; (Published online April 26, 2017)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature22331Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar show that a diffusible source of netrin-1 at the CNS midline is neither sufficient nor required to direct commissural axon trajectories toward the midline. These findings support a revised model in which VZ progenitor-derived netrin-1 directs commissural axon trajectories through short-range haptotactic guidance as axons extend toward the floor plate. Just as examination of Mandelbrot set images at higher and higher resolution reveals progressively more complex and beautiful shapes, we can expect that future investigations into axon guidance mechanisms stimulated by these current studies will reveal new principles underlying neural circuit elaboration during development. Netrin1 Produced by Neural Progenitors, Not Floor Plate Cells, Is Required for Axon Guidance in the Spinal CordVaradarajan et al.NeuronApril 20, 2017In BriefVaradarajan et al. show that netrin1 supplied by neural progenitors, not floor plate (FP) cells, guides commissural axons in the developing spinal cord. These findings contrast with the long-held model that the FP supplies a long-range axonal chemoattractant. Rather, netrin1 is produced by neural progenitors and deposited on the pial surface, providing a growth substrate that directs ventrally directed axonal growth. Full-Text PDF Open Archive"

https://openalex.org/W2615656285,"Introduction Although the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends against routine prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, specialty organizations support screening via shared decision making between providers and selected patients. While discussions about advantages and disadvantages of testing are a feature of patient-centered care, it is unclear how provider recommendations and the presence of a personal doctor influence testing in the presence of such discussions. Materials and methods We used the 2013 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to identify 1,737 male respondents surveyed about their PSA testing decisions. We describe the prevalence of provider recommendations and utilize weighted multivariable logistic regression models to examine the impact of provider recommendations and presence of a personal doctor on routine testing while accounting for patient-provider discussions about advantages and disadvantages. Results The majority (70.4%) of respondents reported some form of discussion with providers about testing and most underwent screening in accordance with provider recommendations. In multivariable analyses, men whose providers had never recommended PSA test were less likely to receive screening [OR 0.03, 95% CI (0.02–0.05)], and patients who did not identify a personal doctor in their care were less likely to undergo testing [OR 0.12, 95% CI (0.04–0.32)]. Discussion Provider recommendations and having a personal doctor are associated with routine PSA testing. These findings suggest that providers and policymakers should be aware of how the content and context of communication with patients, beyond discussions of risks and benefits, can influence routine PSA testing behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2615745497,"Researchers who are internationally mobile during early stages of their academic career display, on average, higher scientific productivity (e.g., increased number and quality of subsequent publications) [e.g., ([ 1 ][1])]. Using large-scale survey data on European researchers who have been mobile after their Ph.D., we found similar self-reported effects on productivity but also positive effects on their research career, such as access to a network of experts. Mobile European researchers who went to the United States were significantly more likely to report strong positive career effects than their mobile peers who moved within the European Union (EU) (up to twice as high) ([ 2 ][2]). Taking into account personal, field, and home-country characteristics, researchers who moved to the United States are particularly more likely to be strongly career-motivated compared with their intra-EU-mobile peers. Once this selection is accounted for, there are no longer significant differences in productivity effects between U.S.-mobile and intra-EU-mobile researchers. These results suggest that the United States manages to attract career-motivated EU researchers who are more likely to experience positive effects from mobility.

In search of a possible “elite” brain drain from Europe, we examined return rates for a sample of Europeans pursuing Ph.D. degrees in economics in the United States ([ 3 ][3]). Those better students who received Ph.D. degrees from top U.S. institutes are more likely to stay in the United States, conditional on finding a first job at a top institute. The probability of these individuals returning to Europe later on becomes very small. The results suggest a catch-22 regarding U.S. openness: To continue to attract elite researchers, the United States needs to continue to be at the scientific frontier with leading experts, often foreign-born. Making the United States a less-welcoming and convenient destination for the frontier-pushers may set in motion a downward spiral, by reducing the attractiveness of the United States as a destination for career-motivated top researchers. For Europe to promote effective intra-EU mobility, it needs to address the selection issue and to support research environments, like European Research Council hubs, that will induce the best researchers to choose the EU for their mobility destination. Mobility support policies should target early-stage Ph.D. students, as researchers with mobility experience within Europe as Ph.D. students are more likely to remain internationally mobile within Europe post-Ph.D.

https://openalex.org/W2615470856,"Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) molecular analysis is performed to assess the responsiveness to Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) in patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). The existence of molecular intra-tumoral heterogeneity has been observed in lung cancers. The aim of the present study is to investigate if the percentage of mutated neoplastic cells within the tumor sample might influence the responsiveness to TKIs treatment.A total of 931 cases of NSCLC were analyzed for EGFR mutational status (exon 18, 19, 20, 21) using Next Generation Sequencer. The percentage of mutated neoplastic cells was calculated after normalizing the percentage of mutated alleles obtained after next generation sequencer analysis with the percentage of neoplastic cells in each tumor.Next generation sequencing revealed an EGFR mutation in 167 samples (17.9%), mainly deletions in exon 19. In 18 patients treated with TKIs and with available follow-up, there was a significant correlation between the percentage of mutated neoplastic cells and the clinical response (P = 0.017). Patients with a percentage of mutated neoplastic cells greater than 56%, have a statistical trend (P = 0.081) for higher Overall Survival (26.3 months) when compared to those with a rate of mutated neoplastic cells lower than 56% (8.2 months).The percentage of EGFR-mutated neoplastic cells in the tumor is associated with response to TKIs. A ""quantitative result"" of EGFR mutational status might provide useful information in order to recognize those patients which might have the greatest benefit from TKIs."

Imagine Usain Bolt on the track crouched into a four-point stance and waiting for the race to begin. The starting pistol fires, and he springs forth with astonishing speed. In less than 200 ms, the sound of the gunshot is processed by his auditory system and transformed into a series of motor commands that coordinate his skeletal muscles to carry out a behavior that has been shaped by years of practice. We perform basic versions of this kind of behavior several times every day; for example, turning left in response to a GPS command and nodding in agreement during a conversation with a friend. The capacity to learn, prepare, and command movements in response to sensory information is a fundamental feature of the brain. Motor engagement likely requires the coordinated activity of many brain regions. What are these large-scale network dynamics that enable sensorimotor transformations? A primary challenge in addressing this question stems from the difficulty in observing large-scale network changes that accompany a tractable behavior. To address this need, three related studies in this issue of Neuron have successfully tracked large-scale neuronal activity patterns during movement acquisition, planning, and execution using cortex-wide calcium imaging methods at both mesoscopic and cellular scales. In all three studies, mice were taught to respond to a sensory cue (e.g., tone presentation) with a simple motor action (e.g., a controlled tongue movement). Each paper focused on different aspects of the neural response and together begin to form a more complete picture of how the brain generates learned, sensory-driven movements. At the heart of each investigation is an identified region within the frontal cortex, often referred to as the anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM), which may have functional similarities to the primate premotor cortex. ALM had previously been shown to be a critical node for enabling the transfer of information from sensory to motor regions within the brain (Guo et al., 2014Guo Z.V. Li N. Huber D. Ophir E. Gutnisky D. Ting J.T. Feng G. Svoboda K. Neuron. 2014; 81: 179-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Further, single neurons within ALM exhibit robust activity that can predict the direction of upcoming movement long before its initiation (Li et al., 2015Li N. Chen T.W. Guo Z.V. Gerfen C.R. Svoboda K. Nature. 2015; 519: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, Li et al., 2016Li N. Daie K. Svoboda K. Druckmann S. Nature. 2016; 532: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Does motor preparation originate within ALM? To address this question, the Svoboda lab (Chen et al., 2017Chen T.W. Li N. Daie K. Svoboda K. Neuron. 2017; 94 (this issue): 866-879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) examined the activity of not only ALM, but also a nearby structure—the medial motor cortex (MM)—because it had been shown to exhibit preparatory activity (Erlich et al., 2011Erlich J.C. Bialek M. Brody C.D. Neuron. 2011; 72: 330-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Mice were trained to use their whiskers to discriminate two positions of a pole and to report their perception by licking one of two ports after a substantial delay period. Wide-field imaging during task performance revealed a wave of neural activity that started in contralateral MM during the sensory phase and later emerged in ALM bilaterally during the delay period, peaking just prior to the movement onset. Chen et al., 2017Chen T.W. Li N. Daie K. Svoboda K. Neuron. 2017; 94 (this issue): 866-879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar used two-photon imaging at cellular resolution, combining imaging planes from multiple locations that span MM and ALM. Neurons within these areas often displayed responses only to specific aspects of the task, namely the sensory percept (anterior or posterior location of the pole), the motor response (direction of licking), or the outcome of the trial (reward or no reward). In order to identify the beginning stages of motor preparation, they examined the relative timing of activity in the neurons that correlated with lick direction, representing the behavioral choice of the animal. They found that preparatory activity emerges seconds before movement onset in the deep layers of ALM, significantly preceding such neuronal responses in superficial regions or in MM. Because only two identified motor regions were observed, Chen et al., 2017Chen T.W. Li N. Daie K. Svoboda K. Neuron. 2017; 94 (this issue): 866-879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar cannot rule out the involvement of other areas on motor preparation. Regardless, the experimental design with explicit sensory, delay, and response epochs represents a compelling means of delineating the roles of individual neurons in a sensorimotor task. This design is likely to be useful for dissecting the behavioral relevance of other candidate movement planning regions in future studies. To begin to understand movement representation on a larger spatial scale, a second study in this issue (Allen et al., 2017Allen W.E. Kauvar I.V. Chen M.Z. Richman E.B. Yang S.J. Chan K. Gradinaru V. Deverman B.E. Luo L. Deisseroth K. Neuron. 2017; 94 (this issue): 891-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) examined global responses in most of dorsal cortex while mice performed an olfactory discrimination task. To achieve this, Allen et al., 2017Allen W.E. Kauvar I.V. Chen M.Z. Richman E.B. Yang S.J. Chan K. Gradinaru V. Deverman B.E. Luo L. Deisseroth K. Neuron. 2017; 94 (this issue): 891-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar outfitted mice with a 7-mm window and imaged activity while they licked to indicate the odor identity. During task performance, active neurons were observed across a broad collection of cortical regions, including sensory, motor, and association areas. Neurons that consistently responded during specific points during the trial were found sprinkled throughout the forebrain, with little evidence for spatial clustering. Motivated to more comprehensively survey this distributed response, the aforementioned group (Allen et al., 2017Allen W.E. Kauvar I.V. Chen M.Z. Richman E.B. Yang S.J. Chan K. Gradinaru V. Deverman B.E. Luo L. Deisseroth K. Neuron. 2017; 94 (this issue): 891-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) directly compared neural responses collected with wide-field and two-photon imaging during optogentic silencing and activation of ALM. They demonstrate that this approach is strongly biased toward capturing activity occurring in layer 1 rather than layer 2/3, although the precise contribution of different cell types (e.g., layer 5 dendrites) to this response remains unknown. Allen et al., 2017Allen W.E. Kauvar I.V. Chen M.Z. Richman E.B. Yang S.J. Chan K. Gradinaru V. Deverman B.E. Luo L. Deisseroth K. Neuron. 2017; 94 (this issue): 891-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar demonstrate widespread, distributed brain activity during this task, and they find that silencing ALM abolishes this global activity. Surprisingly, they were also able to trigger large-scale patterns of activity, as well as licking movements by optogenetically stimulating ALM, even in the absence of behavior, although it remains unclear whether the evoked patterns directly match the motor-related firing. These results, nonetheless, suggest that ALM is acting as a ringleader capable of broadly influencing cortical function. How does this large-scale activity change with motor learning? To address this question, another study (Makino et al., 2017Makino H. Ren H. Liu H. Kim A.N. Kondapaneni N. Liu X. Kuzum D. Komiyama T. Neuron. 2017; 94 (this issue): 880-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) imaged a large portion of the dorsal cortex in the mouse across successive days while it learned to pull a lever in response to an auditory cue. Over the span of 2 weeks, learning was associated with both a decrease in reaction time and a reconfiguration of network dynamics. To explicitly track cortex-wide changes, Makino et al., 2017Makino H. Ren H. Liu H. Kim A.N. Kondapaneni N. Liu X. Kuzum D. Komiyama T. Neuron. 2017; 94 (this issue): 880-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar functionally segregated individual brain areas into identified regions (e.g., primary motor cortex) and measured their relative time of activation. Surprising shifts were observed in the sequential order in which individual areas became active. Of particular interest was the secondary motor cortex (M2), which overlaps spatially with ALM. During learning, M2 activity migrated to the beginning of the sequence. This observation was supported by a Granger causality analysis that suggests that activity flowed from M2 to other forebrain areas during late stages of learning. Inactivation experiments support this idea; injection of muscimol into M2 reverses learning-related changes in observed large-scale cortical activity, even in cases where the behavioral output was identical. These results demonstrate that behavioral changes during learning can be associated with large-scale alterations in the flow of activity. Taken together, these studies deepen our understanding of the forebrain dynamics that underlie movement. Sensory information is routed to ALM from other cortical regions, originating at different points depending on modality (e.g., auditory versus olfaction). Shortly thereafter, within ALM, the upcoming decision is represented by an increase in firing of layer 5 neurons. While we know that premotor neurons projecting out of ALM can drive upcoming movements, ALM also appears to spark a widespread sequence of activation across diverse cortical regions in a manner that is shaped by experience. Several questions follow from these studies. (1) What are the mechanisms that enable ALM to represent preparatory activity that anticipates future actions? Of specific interest are the means by which sensory information is integrated by layer 5 ALM neurons and converted into a motor plan, especially with respect to the roles of specific projection classes. Recordings of these neurons and their inputs throughout learning may help to shed light on how this is established. (2) What is the function, if any, of the ALM-dependent global activation of the cortex? It is especially pertinent because inactivation of brain regions other than ALM did not lead to measurable behavioral deficits (Allen et al., 2017Allen W.E. Kauvar I.V. Chen M.Z. Richman E.B. Yang S.J. Chan K. Gradinaru V. Deverman B.E. Luo L. Deisseroth K. Neuron. 2017; 94 (this issue): 891-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, Makino et al., 2017Makino H. Ren H. Liu H. Kim A.N. Kondapaneni N. Liu X. Kuzum D. Komiyama T. Neuron. 2017; 94 (this issue): 880-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), adding to the growing evidence that neural responses reflecting an animal’s decision may not be causally involved in carrying out that decision (Katz et al., 2016Katz L.N. Yates J.L. Pillow J.W. Huk A.C. Nature. 2016; 535: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). (3) Is ALM a universal hub for learned movement? This is especially pertinent given the fact that ALM activity is both necessary and sufficient for tongue protrusions (Guo et al., 2014Guo Z.V. Li N. Huber D. Ophir E. Gutnisky D. Ting J.T. Feng G. Svoboda K. Neuron. 2014; 81: 179-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, Komiyama et al., 2010Komiyama T. Sato T.R. O’Connor D.H. Zhang Y.X. Huber D. Hooks B.M. Gabitto M. Svoboda K. Nature. 2010; 464: 1182-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), and all the mice in these studies were required to lick as part of the task. It is possible that other distinct premotor regions may exist for behaviors that do not involve orofacial movements. If this is the case, do all such premotor hubs share a common organizing principle based on their inputs and outputs? Overall, these studies represent a major step forward toward a detailed understanding of the large-scale dynamics involved in motor preparation. By taking a more global view of activity, as is routine for simpler systems (Ahrens et al., 2012Ahrens M.B. Li J.M. Orger M.B. Robson D.N. Schier A.F. Engert F. Portugues R. Nature. 2012; 485: 471-477PubMed Google Scholar), we can begin to track—and one day to understand—processes that require complex interactions across brain regions.

Standing orders were seen in 42% (745/1783) of admissions. Non-conformity with the coroner's recommendations was common. Overall, 672/1783 (38%) admissions involved a patient receiving more than the recommended daily maximum dose (643/999 older patients, 64%). Of 607 admissions which were longer than 10 days, 257 (39%) involved a prescription which exceeded 10 days.A coroner's recommendation that doctors receive instructions about safe Z-drug prescribing is unprecedented, and was likely required given that use of Z-drugs occurs at doses and durations that often exceed best practice recommendations.

https://openalex.org/W2615122510,"Le Grand K could be facing retirement at last. For more than a decade, metrologists have sought to replace the legendary standard for the kilogram—a 128-year-old slug of platinum iridium alloy in a Paris vault—with one based on an immutable constant of nature. This week in Paris, teams from several countries presented (almost) final measurements of the Planck constant, the key to the new standard. If those numbers agree, the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) could redefine the kilogram next year. Metrologists have already redefined in a similar way another key unit in the International System of Units, the meter. In 1983, CGPM defined the speed of light as exactly 299,792,458 meters per second, allowing the meter to be redefined as the distance light travels in 1/299,792,458 of a second. Scientists aim to redefine the kilogram with an electrical device called a Kibble balance, in which a weight is balanced by a magnetic force on a coil carrying electric current. Do everything just right and you can define the kilogram in terms of a current and a voltage, with the Planck constant, the fundamental constant of quantum mechanics, entering through the techniques used to make the electrical measurements. Knowing the Planck constant, researchers can then use a Kibble balance to manufacture a standard kilogram. Before the new standard can be adopted, however, scientists must measure the constant as precisely as possible so its value can be fixed. Most researchers now expect at least three measurements to meet the criteria for fixing the constant and moving forward with redefining the kilogram."

https://openalex.org/W2616716294,"Firms, by design, are the central actors in the U.S. high-skilled immigration system. Whereas “points-based systems,” in which governments select migrants on the basis of their curricula vitae, can struggle with underemployment of migrants ([ 1 ][1]), the U.S. system delegates selection to firms, roughly saying: “Tell us whom you want to employ, and we will admit them up to a limit and subject to basic conditions.” Motivations of firms thus become motivations of the immigration system. But despite potential advantages, policy implementation is crude: The H-1B visa is basically first-come, first-served and uses a lottery in years with very high demand, like 2017. Thus, each visa is a random selection of potential firm motivations, only partly aligned with national intentions and that creates unanticipated winners and losers in how the impact of migration is felt among U.S. citizens. Firms can hire migrants to be more innovative, unlock growth of jobs and profits, and benefit citizens ([ 2 ][2], [ 3 ][3]), but many employers use visas to keep their workforces younger, lowering wage costs and perhaps garnering employees more willing to work longer hours. Our study of 319 of America's largest employers and technology firms found that expansion of young, skilled immigrant employment led to more jobs for natives, but these mainly went to younger workers ([ 4 ][4]). Similarly, the H-1B system is very flexible and helps ensure that migrants are chosen to fit the current needs of employers. For example, the share of visas going to computer-related occupations has fluctuated 25 to 75% over 5-year time spans, depending on economic conditions ([ 3 ][3]). However, this flexibility also allows visas to be used in ways that the program did not intend, such as roughly a quarter of visas being claimed by Indian outsourcing companies to aid moving work away from the United States. Ultimately, high-skilled migration is not a zero-sum game, as the productivity of skilled workers in many industries is enhanced by proximity and collaboration with other skilled workers. One promising refinement is to award H-1B visas in order of the salaries to be paid, which could help ensure that higher-value-added applicants are selected and weaken any potential undercutting of American workers. This would need to ensure equal footing for small firms and an appropriate balance over occupations and industries. Innovative approaches need to be considered for determining the number of visas, such as an index to economic conditions, such that we are not locked into fixed quota levels that can span a decade without connection to current needs.
