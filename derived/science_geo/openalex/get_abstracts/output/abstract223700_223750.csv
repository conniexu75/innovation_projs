The evidence from this and other similar confirmatory work is entirely indirect, and attempts were therefore made to isolate the organism or organisms concerned."

https://openalex.org/W2064206899,DL-N-(gamma-glutamyl)-ethylamine has been found to act as an antimetabolite of glutamic acid in the growth of Staphylococcus aureus1. The object of the present investigation was to study the influence of this substance on the multiplication of the parasitic flagellate Trichomonas vaginalis.

https://openalex.org/W1997866680,"IN the course of an investigation to determine whether there was a body in the Sutton Hoo ship burial1, chemical analysis has revealed some unusual phosphatic material derived from calcined bone. That this phosphatic material should have persisted after some 1,300 years is of the utmost importance when one considers that the acidic nature of the soil at Sutton Hoo2 (subsoil sand, pH 4.5) does not favour the preservation of skeletal remains. In the whole of the burial deposit, the excavators thought they recognized only one small fragment of bone which they described as unburnt3. This piece, cancellous and brown in colour, was found on top of the largest of the silver dishes in close association with many fragments of wood, bark and iron. From visual examination only, a distinguished anatomist agreed with the excavators; but the opinion of others, based on more detailed examination, was that the fragment was not bone."

https://openalex.org/W2045780720,"SULPHAMIC acid (aminosulphonic acid) decomposes nitrites quantitatively1 with evolution of nitrogen gas according to the equation The reaction, which is very specific and strongly catalysed by hydrogen ions, may be used for the removal of interfering nitrites, for example, when testing for nitrates2, or in water analysis as part of the Winkler method for dissolved oxygen determinations, where nitrites will cause serious error unless removed. For this latter purpose, according to Cohen and Ruchhoft3, sulphamic acid possesses distinct advantages over sodium azide."
