https://openalex.org/W1981443800,"Recent developments in the controlled movement of domain walls in magnetic nanowires by short pulses of spin-polarized current give promise of a nonvolatile memory device with the high performance and reliability of conventional solid-state memory but at the low cost of conventional magnetic disk drive storage. The racetrack memory described in this review comprises an array of magnetic nanowires arranged horizontally or vertically on a silicon chip. Individual spintronic reading and writing nanodevices are used to modify or read a train of ∼10 to 100 domain walls, which store a series of data bits in each nanowire. This racetrack memory is an example of the move toward innately three-dimensional microelectronic devices."
https://openalex.org/W2009004909,"The inhalation of airborne pollutants, such as asbestos or silica, is linked to inflammation of the lung, fibrosis, and lung cancer. How the presence of pathogenic dust is recognized and how chronic inflammatory diseases are triggered are poorly understood. Here, we show that asbestos and silica are sensed by the Nalp3 inflammasome, whose subsequent activation leads to interleukin-1beta secretion. Inflammasome activation is triggered by reactive oxygen species, which are generated by a NADPH oxidase upon particle phagocytosis. (NADPH is the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate.) In a model of asbestos inhalation, Nalp3-/- mice showed diminished recruitment of inflammatory cells to the lungs, paralleled by lower cytokine production. Our findings implicate the Nalp3 inflammasome in particulate matter-related pulmonary diseases and support its role as a major proinflammatory ""danger"" receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1969865366,"Over evolutionary time, many genes undergo duplication and one copy accumulates mutations that render it non-functional. These 'pseudogenes' are generally thought to be rather uninteresting, dead-end pieces of the genome. Yet there now appears to be more to it than that. Two groups report in this issue on pseudogenes that can in fact influence gene expression. The mechanism involves pairing of RNA antisense transcripts from pseudogenes with the mRNAs of protein-coding genes, forming a duplex RNA that is processed into endogenous siRNAs. Over evolutionary time genes can undergo duplication, and may accumulate mutations that render them non-functional pseudogenes, which are thought to be uninteresting. This study (and that of the group of Sasaki) shows that pseudogenes can in fact influence gene expression. Pseudogenes populate the mammalian genome as remnants of artefactual incorporation of coding messenger RNAs into transposon pathways1. Here we show that a subset of pseudogenes generates endogenous small interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs) in mouse oocytes. These endo-siRNAs are often processed from double-stranded RNAs formed by hybridization of spliced transcripts from protein-coding genes to antisense transcripts from homologous pseudogenes. An inverted repeat pseudogene can also generate abundant small RNAs directly. A second class of endo-siRNAs may enforce repression of mobile genetic elements, acting together with Piwi-interacting RNAs. Loss of Dicer, a protein integral to small RNA production, increases expression of endo-siRNA targets, demonstrating their regulatory activity. Our findings indicate a function for pseudogenes in regulating gene expression by means of the RNA interference pathway and may, in part, explain the evolutionary pressure to conserve argonaute-mediated catalysis in mammals."

https://openalex.org/W2065494245,"The controlled motion of a series of domain walls along magnetic nanowires using spin-polarized current pulses is the essential ingredient of the proposed magnetic racetrack memory, a new class of potential non-volatile storage-class memories. Using permalloy nanowires, we achieved the successive creation, motion, and detection of domain walls by using sequences of properly timed, nanosecond-long, spin-polarized current pulses. The cycle time for the writing and shifting of the domain walls was a few tens of nanoseconds. Our results illustrate the basic concept of a magnetic shift register that relies on the phenomenon of spin-momentum transfer to move series of closely spaced domain walls."
https://openalex.org/W1991007428,"Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) direct RNA interference (RNAi) in eukaryotes. In flies, somatic cells produce siRNAs from exogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) as a defense against viral infection. We identified endogenous siRNAs (endo-siRNAs), 21 nucleotides in length, that correspond to transposons and heterochromatic sequences in the somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster. We also detected endo-siRNAs complementary to messenger RNAs (mRNAs); these siRNAs disproportionately mapped to the complementary regions of overlapping mRNAs predicted to form double-stranded RNA in vivo. Normal accumulation of somatic endo-siRNAs requires the siRNA-generating ribonuclease Dicer-2 and the RNAi effector protein Argonaute2 (Ago2). We propose that endo-siRNAs generated by the fly RNAi pathway silence selfish genetic elements in the soma, much as Piwi-interacting RNAs do in the germ line."
https://openalex.org/W2079779136,"One option open to public health authorities facing the prospect of an influenza pandemic is the closure of all the schools. A dramatic gesture, but would it help? There is a shortage of reliable data on the matter, but the Sentinel network, linking over a thousand general practitioners across France, provides a resource that can tackle the question by comparing a 21-year record of daily reported cases of flu-like disease with the dates of school vacations — the timing of which is staggered across France minimizing the impact of seasonal factors. The answer is yes, there is a reduction, of about 20%, in rates of flu transmission to children. This translates into a predicted reduction of about 15% in the overall number of cases if schools were closed during a pandemic, sufficient to reduce stress on the healthcare system, but not to stop the disease in its tracks. This paper presents an epidemiological analysis of the role of schools in seasonal influenza transmission, and estimates the effect of school closure during a pandemic, which appears to be modest. The threat posed by the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus requires public health authorities to prepare for a human pandemic. Although pre-pandemic vaccines and antiviral drugs might significantly reduce illness rates1,2, their stockpiling is too expensive to be practical for many countries. Consequently, alternative control strategies, based on non-pharmaceutical interventions, are a potentially attractive policy option. School closure is the measure most often considered. The high social and economic costs of closing schools for months make it an expensive and therefore controversial policy, and the current absence of quantitative data on the role of schools during influenza epidemics means there is little consensus on the probable effectiveness of school closure in reducing the impact of a pandemic. Here, from the joint analysis of surveillance data and holiday timing in France, we quantify the role of schools in influenza epidemics and predict the effect of school closure during a pandemic. We show that holidays lead to a 20–29% reduction in the rate at which influenza is transmitted to children, but that they have no detectable effect on the contact patterns of adults. Holidays prevent 16–18% of seasonal influenza cases (18–21% in children). By extrapolation, we find that prolonged school closure during a pandemic might reduce the cumulative number of cases by 13–17% (18–23% in children) and peak attack rates by up to 39–45% (47–52% in children). The impact of school closure would be reduced if it proved difficult to maintain low contact rates among children for a prolonged period."
https://openalex.org/W2057858743,"The toxicity of ionizing radiation is associated with massive apoptosis in radiosensitive organs. Here, we investigate whether a drug that activates a signaling mechanism used by tumor cells to suppress apoptosis can protect healthy cells from the harmful effects of radiation. We studied CBLB502, a polypeptide drug derived from Salmonella flagellin that binds to Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) and activates nuclear factor–κB signaling. A single injection of CBLB502 before lethal total-body irradiation protected mice from both gastrointestinal and hematopoietic acute radiation syndromes and resulted in improved survival. CBLB502 injected after irradiation also enhanced survival, but at lower radiation doses. It is noteworthy that the drug did not decrease tumor radiosensitivity in mouse models. CBLB502 also showed radioprotective activity in lethally irradiated rhesus monkeys. Thus, TLR5 agonists could potentially improve the therapeutic index of cancer radiotherapy and serve as biological protectants in radiation emergencies."
https://openalex.org/W2046027506,"Globally, priority areas for biodiversity are relatively well known, yet few detailed plans exist to direct conservation action within them, despite urgent need. Madagascar, like other globally recognized biodiversity hot spots, has complex spatial patterns of endemism that differ among taxonomic groups, creating challenges for the selection of within-country priorities. We show, in an analysis of wide taxonomic and geographic breadth and high spatial resolution, that multitaxonomic rather than single-taxon approaches are critical for identifying areas likely to promote the persistence of most species. Our conservation prioritization, facilitated by newly available techniques, identifies optimal expansion sites for the Madagascar government's current goal of tripling the land area under protection. Our findings further suggest that high-resolution multitaxonomic approaches to prioritization may be necessary to ensure protection for biodiversity in other global hot spots."
https://openalex.org/W1995949213,"AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPARs) mediate fast excitatory synaptic transmission. Upon fast consecutive synaptic stimulation, transmission can be depressed. Recuperation from fast synaptic depression has been attributed solely to recovery of transmitter release and/or AMPAR desensitization. We show that AMPAR lateral diffusion, observed in both intact hippocampi and cultured neurons, allows fast exchange of desensitized receptors with naïve functional ones within or near the postsynaptic density. Recovery from depression in the tens of millisecond time range can be explained in part by this fast receptor exchange. Preventing AMPAR surface movements through cross-linking, endogenous clustering, or calcium rise all slow recovery from depression. Physiological regulation of postsynaptic receptor mobility affects the fidelity of synaptic transmission by shaping the frequency dependence of synaptic responses."

We report on an artificial nanofabricated motor in which one short carbon nanotube moves relative to another coaxial nanotube. A cargo is attached to an ablated outer wall of a multiwalled carbon nanotube that can rotate and/or translate along the inner nanotube. The motion is actuated by imposing a thermal gradient along the nanotube, which allows for subnanometer displacements, as opposed to an electromigration or random walk effect."
https://openalex.org/W2008684414,"Cytidine deaminases of the APOBEC3 family all have specificity for single-stranded DNA, which may become exposed during replication or transcription of double-stranded DNA. Three human APOBEC3A ( hA3A ), hA3B , and hA3H genes are expressed in keratinocytes and skin, leading us to determine whether genetic editing of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA occurred. In a study of HPV1a plantar warts and HPV16 precancerous cervical biopsies, hyperedited HPV1a and HPV16 genomes were found. Strictly analogous results were obtained from transfection experiments with HPV plasmid DNA and the three nuclear localized enzymes: hA3A, hA3C, and hA3H. Thus, stochastic or transient overexpression of APOBEC3 genes may expose the genome to a broad spectrum of mutations that could influence the development of tumors."

https://openalex.org/W1977060309,"The nature of species boundaries in bacteria remains controversial. In particular, the mechanisms of bacterial speciation and maintenance in the face of frequent genetic exchange are poorly understood. Here, we report patterns of genetic exchange that show two closely related zoonotic pathogenic species, Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli, are converging as a consequence of recent changes in gene flow. Population expansion into a novel ecological niche generated by human activity is the most probable explanation for the increase in genetic exchange between these species. Bacterial speciation can therefore occur by mechanisms analogous to those seen in metazoans, where genetic diversification and incipient speciation caused by ecological factors have been reported in several genera."
https://openalex.org/W2046319786,"Initiation of actin polymerization in cells requires nucleation factors. Here we describe an actin-binding protein, leiomodin, that acted as a strong filament nucleator in muscle cells. Leiomodin shared two actin-binding sites with the filament pointed end–capping protein tropomodulin: a flexible N-terminal region and a leucine-rich repeat domain. Leiomodin also contained a C-terminal extension of 150 residues. The smallest fragment with strong nucleation activity included the leucine-rich repeat and C-terminal extension. The N-terminal region enhanced the nucleation activity threefold and recruited tropomyosin, which weakly stimulated nucleation and mediated localization of leiomodin to the middle of muscle sarcomeres. Knocking down leiomodin severely compromised sarcomere assembly in cultured muscle cells, which suggests a role for leiomodin in the nucleation of tropomyosin-decorated filaments in muscles."
https://openalex.org/W2097288504,"PksA, which initiates biosynthesis of the environmental carcinogen aflatoxin B1, is one of the multidomain iterative polyketide synthases (IPKSs), a large, poorly understood family of biosynthetic enzymes. We found that dissection of PksA and its reconstitution from selected sets of domains allows the accumulation and characterization of advanced octaketide intermediates bound to the enzyme, permitting the reactions controlled by individual catalytic domains to be identified. A product template (PT) domain unites with the ketosynthase and thioesterase in this IPKS system to assemble precisely seven malonyl-derived building blocks to a hexanoyl starter unit and mediate a specific cyclization cascade. Because the PT domain is common among nonreducing IPKSs, these mechanistic features should prove to be general for IPKS-catalyzed production of aromatic polyketides."
https://openalex.org/W2166591937,"Identifying the mechanism of superconductivity in the high-temperature cuprate superconductors is one of the major outstanding problems in physics. We report local measurements of the onset of superconducting pairing in the high–transition temperature ( T c ) superconductor Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+δ using a lattice-tracking spectroscopy technique with a scanning tunneling microscope. We can determine the temperature dependence of the pairing energy gaps, the electronic excitations in the absence of pairing, and the effect of the local coupling of electrons to bosonic excitations. Our measurements reveal that the strength of pairing is determined by the unusual electronic excitations of the normal state, suggesting that strong electron-electron interactions rather than low-energy (&lt;0.1 volts) electron-boson interactions are responsible for superconductivity in the cuprates."
https://openalex.org/W2085852911,"Clathrin-coated vesicles are vehicles for intracellular trafficking in all nucleated cells, from yeasts to humans. Many studies have demonstrated their essential roles in endocytosis and cellular signalling processes at the plasma membrane. By contrast, very few of their non-endocytic trafficking roles are known, the best characterized being the transport of hydrolases from the Golgi complex to the lysosome. Here we show that clathrin is required for polarity of the basolateral plasma membrane proteins in the epithelial cell line MDCK. Clathrin knockdown depolarized most basolateral proteins, by interfering with their biosynthetic delivery and recycling, but did not affect the polarity of apical proteins. Quantitative live imaging showed that chronic and acute clathrin knockdown selectively slowed down the exit of basolateral proteins from the Golgi complex, and promoted their mis-sorting into apical carrier vesicles. Our results demonstrate a broad requirement for clathrin in basolateral protein trafficking in epithelial cells. Clathrin plays an essential part in various trafficking and signalling processes at the plasma membrane, and its many intracellular trafficking roles are beginning to emerge. Deborde et al. now report a surprisingly broad requirement for clathrin in the biosynthetic sorting of basolateral plasma membrane proteins. Many functions of epithelial cells depend on polarity, so sorting proteins into apical and basolateral domains is of fundamental importance. Clathrin knock-down by RNA inhibition in epithelial cells induced loss of polarity in most basolateral proteins, but did not disrupt apical protein polarity. Epithelial cells sort proteins into apical and basolateral domains. Clathrin plays a key and selective role in the generation of basolateral protein polarity. These results demonstrate an important role of clathrin in sorting of proteins at the trans-Golgi network."
https://openalex.org/W2067957115,"Heat flow between a large thermal 'bath' and a smaller system brings them progressively closer to thermal equilibrium while increasing their entropy. Fluctuations involving a small fraction of a statistical ensemble of systems interacting with the bath result in deviations from this trend. In this respect, quantum and classical thermodynamics are in agreement. Here we predict a different trend in a purely quantum mechanical setting: disturbances of thermal equilibrium between two-level systems (TLSs) and a bath, caused by frequent, brief quantum non-demolition measurements of the TLS energy states. By making the measurements increasingly frequent, we encounter first the anti-Zeno regime and then the Zeno regime (namely where the TLSs' relaxation respectively speeds up and slows down). The corresponding entropy and temperature of both the system and the bath are then found to either decrease or increase depending only on the rate of observation, contrary to the standard thermodynamical rules that hold for memory-less (Markov) baths. From a practical viewpoint, these anomalies may offer the possibility of very fast control of heat and entropy in quantum systems, allowing cooling and state purification over an interval much shorter than the time needed for thermal equilibration or for a feedback control loop."
https://openalex.org/W1979477072,"Temperature is an unavoidable environmental cue that affects the metabolism and behavior of any creature on Earth, yet how animals perceive temperature is poorly understood. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans “memorizes” temperatures, and this stored information modifies its subsequent migration along a temperature gradient. We show that the olfactory neuron designated AWC senses temperature. Calcium imaging revealed that AWC responds to temperature changes and that response thresholds differ depending on the temperature to which the animal was previously exposed. In the mutant with impaired heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein (G protein)–mediated signaling, AWC was hyperresponsive to temperature, whereas the AIY interneuron (which is postsynaptic to AWC) was hyporesponsive to temperature. Thus, temperature sensation exhibits a robust influence on a neural circuit controlling a memory-regulated behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2035799281,"This paper implicates vascular-derived endothelins in axonal growth and guidance. It is shown that the origin of smooth muscle cells surrounding the internal and external carotids is different and finds that they preferentially express components of the endothelin ligand-receptor system. The endothelin family member ET3 directs axon extension of a subset of sympathetic neurons to the external carotid artery. During development, sympathetic neurons extend axons along a myriad of distinct trajectories, often consisting of arteries, to innervate one of a large variety of distinct final target tissues. Whether or not subsets of neurons within complex sympathetic ganglia are predetermined to innervate select end-organs is unknown. Here we demonstrate in mouse embryos that the endothelin family member Edn3 (ref. 1), acting through the endothelin receptor EdnrA (refs 2, 3), directs extension of axons of a subset of sympathetic neurons from the superior cervical ganglion to a preferred intermediate target, the external carotid artery, which serves as the gateway to select targets, including the salivary glands. These findings establish a previously unknown mechanism of axonal pathfinding involving vascular-derived endothelins, and have broad implications for endothelins as general mediators of axonal growth and guidance in the developing nervous system. Moreover, they suggest a model in which newborn sympathetic neurons distinguish and choose between distinct vascular trajectories to innervate their appropriate end organs."
https://openalex.org/W2078236511,"p120 catenin is a cadherin-associated protein that regulates Rho GTPases and promotes the invasiveness of E-cadherin-deficient cancer cells. Multiple p120 isoforms are expressed in cells via alternative splicing, and all of them are essential for HGF signaling to Rac1. However, only full-length p120 (isoform 1) promotes invasiveness. This selective ability of p120 isoform 1 is mediated by reduced RhoA activity, both under basal conditions and following HGF treatment. All p120 isoforms can bind RhoA in vitro, via a central RhoA binding site. However, only the cooperative binding of RhoA to the central p120 domain and to the alternatively spliced p120 N terminus stabilizes RhoA binding and inhibits RhoA activity. Consistent with this, increased expression of p120 isoform 1, when compared with other p120 isoforms, is predictive of renal tumor micrometastasis and systemic progression, following nephrectomy. Furthermore, ectopic expression of the RhoA-binding, N-terminal domain of p120 is sufficient to block the ability of p120 isoform 1 to inhibit RhoA and to promote invasiveness. The data indicate that the increased expression of p120 isoform 1 during tumor progression contributes to the invasive phenotype of cadherin-deficient carcinomas and that the N-terminal domain of p120 is a valid therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2010328956,"The extreme warmth of particular intervals of geologic history cannot be simulated with climate models, which are constrained by the geologic proxy record to relatively modest increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Recent recognition that biological productivity controls the abundance of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) in the unpolluted atmosphere provides a solution to this problem. Our climate simulations show that reduced biological productivity (low CCN abundance) provides a substantial amplification of CO2-induced warming by reducing cloud lifetimes and reflectivity. If the stress of elevated temperatures did indeed suppress marine and terrestrial ecosystems during these times, this long-standing climate enigma may be solved."
https://openalex.org/W2050005958,"The question of whether distinct self-propagating structures could be formed within the same amino acid sequence in the absence of external cofactors or templates has important implications for a number of issues, including the origin of prion strains and the engineering of smart, self-assembling peptide-based biomaterials. In the current study, we showed that chemically identical prion protein can give rise to conformationally distinct, self-propagating amyloid structures in the absence of cellular cofactors, post-translational modification, or PrP(Sc)-specified templates. Even more surprising, two self-replicating states were produced under identical solvent conditions, but under different shaking modes. Individual prion conformations were inherited by daughter fibrils in seeding experiments conducted under alternative shaking modes, illustrating the high fidelity of fibrillation reactions. Our study showed that the ability to acquire conformationally different self-propagating structures is an intrinsic ability of protein fibrillation and strongly supports the hypothesis that conformational variation in self-propagating protein states underlies prion strain diversity."

The seven serotypes (A–G) potently block neurotransmission by binding to presynaptic receptors, undergoing endocytosis, transferring to the cytosol, and inactivating proteins essential for vesicle fusion. Although BoNT/A and BoNT/E cleave SNAP-25, albeit at distinct sites, BoNT/E blocks neurotransmission faster and more potently. To identify the domains responsible for these characteristics, the C-terminal heavy chain portions of BoNT/A and BoNT/E were exchanged to create chimeras AE and EA. After high yield expression in Escherichia coli, these single chain chimeras were purified by two-step chromatography and activated by conversion to disulfide-linked dichains. In vitro, each entered neurons, cleaved SNAP-25, and blocked neuromuscular transmission while causing flaccid paralysis in vivo. Acidification-dependent translocation of the light chain to the cytosol occurred more rapidly for BoNT/E and EA than for BoNT/A and AE because the latter pair remained susceptible for longer to inhibitors of the vesicular proton pump, and BoNT/A proved less sensitive. The receptor-binding and protease domains do not seem to be responsible for the speeds of intoxication; rather the N-terminal halves of their heavy chains are implicated, with dissimilar rates of cytosolic transfer of the light chains being due to differences in pH sensitivity.

Exp. Ther. 1980; 212: 16-21PubMed Google Scholar, 17Simpson L.L. DasGupta B.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1983; 224: 135-140PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lawrence G. Wang J. Chion C.K. Aoki K.R. Dolly J.O. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007; 320: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Furthermore, BoNT/E totally inhibits vesicle fusion more akin to the effects of vesicle-associated membrane protein- or syntaxin-cleaving BoNTs than the reduction in fusion rate induced by BoNT/A (19Xu T. Binz T. Niemann H. Neher E. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 20Sakaba T. Stein A. Jahn R. Neher E. Science. 2005; 309: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Moreover, the blockade of transmitter release by BoNT/E is relatively unaffected by treatments that elevate cytosolic [Ca2+] and antagonize inhibition by BoNT/A (20Sakaba T. Stein A. Jahn R. Neher E. Science. 2005; 309: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 21Gerona R.R. Larsen E.C. Kowalchyk J.A. Martin T.F. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3061-3067Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). All these properties would be highly desirable for incorporation into new and improved therapeutic versions of BoNT, although BoNT/E produces transient muscle weakness compared with the long duration of action of BoNT/A (25Eleopra R. Tugnoli V. Rossetto O. De Grandis D. Montecucco C. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 256: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Thus, the feasibility of such an approach was assessed. Herein, chimeric BoNTs were constructed by recombinant substitution of the HC domains in BoNT/E and BoNT/A with their counterpart region from the other serotype and expressed as His6-tagged single chain (SC) proteins in Escherichia coli. The resultant chimeras could be converted to their disulfide-linked DC form by controlled proteolysis, which also removed the tag. The EA chimera, containing the LC and the N-terminal half (HN) of the HC of BoNT/E fused to the HC domain of BoNT/A, was shown to enter cultured neurons almost as rapidly as BoNT/E and blocked neuromuscular transmission with equipotency, although paralysis was transient (as for BoNT/E). Its speedy internalization into neurons could be attributed to an elevated sensitivity to pH of the BoNT/E LC-HN portion that facilitates expedient cytosolic transfer of the proteolytic LC rather than to the receptor utilized. On the other hand, chimera AE (the LC and HN domain of BoNT/A fused to the HC domain of BoNT/E) was less potent than EA or BoNT/E and much slower to enter neurons, but produced prolonged muscle weakness in mouse, matching that induced by clinical preparations of type A toxin-hemagglutinin complex. As AE should utilize a different receptor than BoNT/A for neuronal entry, it could be a useful alternative for clinical application in the minority of patients who are primary non-responders to the BoNT/A complex. Materials—The following materials were obtained as indicated; the pET29a expression vector, Novagen; E. coli BL21(DE3), Stratagene; restriction enzymes, New England Biolabs; TALON Superflow resin, Clontech; and UNO S1 and Q1 columns, Bradford protein assay kit, and Prescision Plus™ all blue protein standards, Bio-Rad. AccuPrime™ Pfx DNA polymerase, precast gels, and reagents for SDS-PAGE were supplied by Invitrogen. PD-10 desalting columns were provided by GE Healthcare. Substrates for ECL detection of horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Millipore. Antibodies were from Sigma (rabbit anti-SNAP-25, anti-HPC-1, and anti-IgG conjugated to either horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase), Sternberger Monoclonals (SMI-81), and Novagen (anti-His6). Custom antibodies specific for LC/A, LC/E, HC/E, or BoNT/A were prepared by Zymed Laboratories Inc. Purified natural BoNTs were purchased from List Laboratories (BoNT/A, DC form) and Metabiologics (BoNT/E, SC form). The latter was proteolytically nicked to the DC (>95%) with TrypZean (8 μg/mg of BoNT; Sigma) for 40 min at 27 °C. Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) was supplied by LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). Concanamycin A (ConA) and all other reagents were from Sigma. Mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (C57) and Harlan UK (female Tyler's Ordinary); Sprague-Dawley rats were bred in an approved animal unit at Dublin City University. All experimental procedures involving animals were approved by an Institutional Ethics Committee and licensed by the Irish Government, Department of Health and Children. Generation of Constructs for BoNT AE and EA Chimeras: Their Expression, Purification, and Characterization—The cloning and expression of BoNTs were performed in accordance with European Union regulations, registered in Ireland with the Environmental Protection Agency, and notified to the Health and Safety Authority. Genes encoding either BoNT/A or BoNT/E SCs were codon optimized for expression in E. coli and synthesized, and the sequences were verified. 3K. R. Aoki, unpublished data. For constructing chimera AE (see Fig. 1), a fragment encoding the LC plus the translocation domain (HN) of BoNT/A (LC-HN/A) and that encoding the binding domain of BoNT/E (HC/E) were amplified by standard PCR using a high fidelity polymerase. The products were cloned into the pET29a vector using suitable restrictions sites to generate the AE chimera (Fig. 1). Nucleotides encoding a nine-residue linker were inserted between the translocation and binding domains; also, modification of the original vector sequence introduced trypsin cleavage sites between HC/E and the C-terminal six histidines (His6) (see Fig. 1). For constructing chimera EA, a fragment encoding the binding domain of BoNT/A (HC/A) was likewise generated, and nucleotides were added to encode a trypsin cleavage site at its C terminus. This fragment, as well as a separate DNA sequence encoding the LC plus the translocation domain of BoNT/E (LC-HN/E), was amplified by PCR and cloned into pET29a to create an expression vector containing the EA insert (see Fig. 1). After DNA sequence verification, each new SC gene was transformed into E. coli BL21, and expression was elicited by autoinduction (26Studier F.W. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4107) Google Scholar); optimal incubation periods and temperatures were determined empirically. Cells were then pelleted, washed, and lysed using lysozyme and several freeze/thaw cycles; insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The AE SC was trapped by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) on TALON resin, eluted with 500 mm imidazole, and transferred into 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.1) using Sephadex G-25. For further purification, the sample was loaded onto a UNO Q1 column, and after washing with 30 mm NaCl, a stepwise gradient up to 1 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer was applied. Fractions containing the eluted SC toxin were pooled and either stored at –80 °C or proteolytically nicked by TrypZean (1 μg/mg of BoNT) for 1 h at 25 °C before the addition of trypsin inhibitor (10 μg/mg of toxin) and storage of the DC (as for the SC). The expression and affinity purification of the chimera EA SC were performed similarly. The pooled eluate from IMAC was gel-filtered into 0.02 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) and further purified by loading onto a UNO S1 column, followed by washing with 150 mm NaCl and elution with a stepwise gradient up to 1 m NaCl in 0.02 m sodium phosphate buffer. After transfer of the eluted toxin into 50 mm HEPES and 145 mm NaCl (pH 7.4) on Sephadex G-25, purified SC toxin was either stored at –80 °C or nicked by TrypZean (8 μg/mg of toxin) for 1 h at 25 °C before storage. The expression, purification, and nicking of the chimeras were monitored by SDS-PAGE on precast BisTris gels after heating in lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer to 80 °C for 5 min. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue or electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, probed by Western blotting with primary antibodies (as specified in the figure legends) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-species secondary antibodies, and visualized using an ECL protocol. The protein concentrations of SC and DC samples were determined using the Bradford assay. Note that, except where stated otherwise, all functional assays were performed on the DC. Measurements of the Toxins' Protease Activities—A model substrate was created for assay of SNAP-25 cleavage by BoNTs and chimeras (27Williams D. Steward L.E. Gilmore M.A. Okawa Y. Webber J.A. Aoki K.R. Neurotox. Res. 2006; 9: 239Google Scholar). DNA encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) was fused to nucleotides encoding the 73 C-terminal residues of mouse SNAP-25 and a His6 tag. The GFP-SNAP-25-(134–206)-His6 fusion protein was expressed in E. coli and purified by IMAC. Toxins were diluted to 100 or 200 nm in HBS-20 (20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.4), 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 10 μm ZnCl2) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C (to activate the protease) before serial dilution (typically ranging from 0.003 to 100 nm) in HBS-20 and mixing with GFP-SNAP-25-(134–206)-His6 (13.5 μm final concentration). After an additional 30 min at 37 °C, cleavage reactions were stopped by the addition of 8 m guanidine HCl, loaded onto 50 μl of TALON resin, and incubated for 15 min in the dark at room temperature. After washing, the amount of GFP-peptide fragment in fractions not bound to the resin was determined using a Synergy HT fluorometer (λex = 485/20 nm, λem = 528/20 nm) and quantified with Gen5 (both from BioTek Instruments). Data were plotted as fluorescence intensity against the log of toxin concentration and fitted with sigmoidal curves, and the amount of toxin required to cleave 10% of the substrate was interpolated. Assessment of the Neuromuscular Paralytic Activity and Lethality of BoNTs—Mouse hemidiaphragms were bathed at 35 °C in Krebs-Ringer buffer (containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and continuously aerated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2). Muscle contractions were elicited by electrical stimulation (50-ms square pulses of 5–10 V at 0.2 Hz) of the nerve and measured using FORT25 isometric force transducers (World Precision Instruments) as described previously (18Lawrence G. Wang J. Chion C.K. Aoki K.R. Dolly J.O. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007; 320: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). BoNTs were added directly to the Krebs-Ringer buffer, and the time taken for a 90% reduction in muscle tension was recorded. BoNT-induced neuromuscular paralysis in vivo was monitored by the digit abduction score (DAS) assay (28Aoki K.R. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1815-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The maximal tolerated dose was determined for each neurotoxin; this is the largest dose that could be injected into the gastrocnemius muscle without producing systemic symptoms (e.g. complete immobilization of the injected leg, lower abdomen contraction, and subsequent general paralysis). Mice received single 5-μl injections into the right gastrocnemius muscle of a maximal tolerated dose of toxin diluted in sterile normal saline (0.9% (w/v) NaCl containing 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin). Mice were monitored on a daily basis, and the DAS was determined using a five-point scale (0 = normal to 4 = maximal reduction in digit abduction) as described (28Aoki K.R. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1815-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Toxin lethalities were determined by intraperitoneal injection into mice as described previously (29Maisey E.A. Wadsworth J.D. Poulain B. Shone C.C. Melling J. Gibbs P. Tauc L. Dolly J.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 683-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The lowest amount of toxin that killed 50% of mice within 4 days was taken as one minimal lethal dose (mLD50) and expressed as the number of mLD50 units/mg of toxin. Isolation and Culturing of Mouse Spinal Cord, Rat Cerebellar Granule, and Superior Cervical Ganglionic Neurons: Exposure to BoNTs and Assay of SNARE Cleavage—All neuronal cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Neurons were prepared from mouse spinal cords removed at gestation day 13, dissociated with trypsin, and seeded at a density of 106 cells/well on rat tail collagen-coated 24-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated horse serum and other factors (15Keller J.E. Cai F. Neale E.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). At 21 days in vitro, cultures were exposed for 20 min to each toxin in stimulation buffer (15Keller J.E. Cai F. Neale E.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), washed twice with toxin-free medium, and incubated for the periods specified in the figure legends before harvesting for analysis. In some experiments, an endosomal acidification inhibitor, ConA, was added (250 nm final concentration) at various times after toxin removal as described (15Keller J.E. Cai F. Neale E.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar); the cells were harvested after an additional 20 h of culturing. Rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) were prepared and maintained following established methodology (30Foran P.G. Mohammed N. Lisk G.O. Nagwaney S. Lawrence G.W. Johnson E. Smith L. Aoki K.R. Dolly J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1363-1371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). At 7 days in vitro, the cells were exposed for 24 h at 37 °C to a series of toxin concentrations. In some cases, cells were incubated for 5 min with 500 pm BoNTs in HEPES-buffered solution containing 70 mm K+ (stimulation) with adjustment of the NaCl concentration (30Foran P.G. Mohammed N. Lisk G.O. Nagwaney S. Lawrence G.W. Johnson E. Smith L. Aoki K.R. Dolly J.O. J. Biol.

The isolation and culture of neurons from the superior cervical ganglia of 1–3-day-old rat pups were performed as described (31Mahanthappa N.K. Patterson P.H. Press MIT Cambridge MA Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. 2nd Ed. 1998: 289-316Google Scholar). The neurons were dispersed in L15 medium supplemented with vitamins, plated on rat tail collagen-coated 48-well plates, and maintained for 8–10 days before experimentation. The neurons were exposed to 10 nm toxin for the periods indicated in the figure legends before harvesting. At the end of each experiment, all cell types were solubilized in lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer and heated to 80 °C for 5 min before SDS-PAGE and Western blotting; SNAP-25 was visualized with a monoclonal antibody (SMI-81, which recognizes intact and BoNT/A- or BoNT/E-cleaved products) and quantified as described (30Foran P.G. Mohammed N. Lisk G.O. Nagwaney S. Lawrence G.W. Johnson E. Smith L. Aoki K.R. Dolly J.O. J. Biol.

Statistical Analysis—Data were calculated and graphs generated using GraphPad Prism 4.0. p values were calculated by Student's t test. Generation of BoNT Chimeras by Genetic Recombination of Functional Domains from BoNT/A and BoNT/E—Based on sequence alignments and published crystal structures of BoNT/A and BoNT/B (33Lacy D.B. Tepp W. Cohen A.C. DasGupta B.R. Stevens R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 34Swaminathan S. Eswaramoorthy S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1024-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), a portion of the gene deduced to encode the protease and translocation domains of BoNT/A was linked to that for the C-terminal receptor-binding moiety of BoNT/E plus 19 additional amino acids, including a His6 tag, to generate chimera AE (LC-HN/A-HC/E-His6) (Fig. 1). Moreover, AE possesses a linker of nine exogenous residues between the HN/A and HC/E domains to increase flexibility between these functional moieties (Fig. 1). This chimeric toxin was expressed in E. coli using Studier's autoinduction medium (26Studier F.W. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4107) Google Scholar) and isolated to ∼80% purity from lysed bacteria by IMAC on a Co2+-charged resin. A protein of ∼146 kDa was eluted by imidazole together with smaller amounts of lower molecular mass impurities as demonstrated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 2A); the major component co-migrated with natural BoNT/A and BoNT/E when lower quantities of proteins were run under nonreducing conditions (data not shown). All contaminants were removed by anion-exchange chromatography (Fig. 2B); the bound toxin was eluted by 70 mm NaCl (typically 10 mg of pure toxin (Fig. 3A) from a 1-liter culture). The resultant AE chimera gave a single band of ∼146 kDa upon SDS-PAGE in either the absence or presence of DTT, confirming that its expression is in the SC form (Fig. 3A). Western blotting demonstrated the presence in the 146-kDa SC of the BoNT/A LC and epitopes from the receptor-binding domain of BoNT/E and confirmed the absence of truncated forms (Fig. 3A). Controlled nicking with TrypZean gave near-complete conversion of the SC to a disulfide-linked DC as revealed by the appearance of the HC and LC upon SDS-PAGE in the presence of DTT (Fig. 3A); continued migration at ∼146 kDa in the absence of reducing agent indicates that the interchain disulfide was formed in virtually all of the DC (Fig. 3A). As expected, antibodies to HC/E recognized the HC but not LC, whereas anti-LC/A antibody labeled the latter (Fig. 3A); the observed lack of reactivity with an antibody against His6 highlighted that all of the C-terminal tag was removed during nicking (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3Conversion of SC chimeras to DC forms by controlled nicking: simultaneous tag removal. The purified AE (A) and EA (B) chimeras were incubated with TrypZean (as described under “Experimental Procedures”). Aliquots were analyzed by SDS-PAGE in the absence or presence of 25 mm DTT (as indicated), followed by either Coomassie Blue staining or Western blotting with the antibodies specified. Arrows indicate the positions of the SC/DC, HC, and LC.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In a similar manner, DNA encoding the LC and HN of BoNT/E was fused to the sequence for the HC of BoNT/A to create a gene for chimera EA (Fig. 1), which was expressed in E. coli and affinity-purified as described for AE (Fig. 2C). Further purification was achieved by cation-exchange chromatography (Fig. 2D) on an UNO S1 column, with elution of the toxin by ≥220 mm NaCl (∼15 mg of pure EA from a 1-liter culture). Although the major protein band migrated upon SDS-PAGE at ∼145 kDa, a minor amount of larger, aggregated material (which disappeared upon reduction) was detected by Coomassie Blue staining and Western blotting (Fig. 3B). Complete conversion of the EA SC to DC with TrypZean was observed as described above for AE; likewise, the interchain disulfide was found to have been formed in the vast majority of the toxin. The presence of the requisite moieties (LC/E and HC/A) in EA and the successful removal of the His6 tag were confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 3B). Staining of the nonreduced nicked toxin with IgGs specific for LC/E revealed a weak signal at ∼97 kDa, which is assumed to correspond to LC-HN resulting from a small degree of cleavage midway along the HC; accordingly, this disappeared upon reduction. Again, immunovisualization of LC and HC bands in the nicked sample, run without reductant, confirmed that the interchain disulfide failed to form only in a minor proportion of the toxin (Fig. 3B).

https://openalex.org/W1982991372,"The 70-kDa heat shock proteins (Hsp70s) are highly conserved ATP-dependent molecular chaperones composed of an N-terminal nucleotide binding domain (NBD) and a C-terminal protein substrate binding domain (SBD) in a bilobate structure. Interdomain communication and nucleotide-dependent structural motions are critical for Hsp70 chaperone functions. Our understanding of these functions remains elusive due to insufficient structural information on intact Hsp70s that represent the different states of the chaperone cycle. We report here the crystal structures of DnaK from Geobacillus kaustophilus HTA426 bound with ADP-Mg(2+)-P(i) at 2.37A and the 70-kDa heat shock cognate protein from Rattus norvegicus bound with ADP-P(i) at 3.5A(.) The NBD and SBD in these structures are significantly separated from each other, and they might depict the ADP-bound conformation. Moreover, a Trp reporter was introduced at the potential interface region between NBD and the interdomain linker of GkDnaK to probe environmental changes. Results from fluorescence measurements support the notion that substrate binding enhances the domain-disjoining behavior of Hsp70 chaperones."
https://openalex.org/W1978375634,"Execution of motor behaviors relies on circuitries effectively integrating immediate sensory feedback to efferent pathways controlling muscle activity. It remains unclear how, during neuromuscular circuit assembly, sensory and motor projections become incorporated into tightly coordinated, yet functionally separate pathways. We report that, within axial nerves, establishment of discrete afferent and efferent pathways depends on coordinate signaling between coextending sensory and motor projections. These heterotypic axon-axon interactions require motor axonal EphA3/EphA4 receptor tyrosine kinases activated by cognate sensory axonal ephrin-A ligands. Genetic elimination of trans-axonal ephrin-A → EphA signaling in mice triggers drastic motor-sensory miswiring, culminating in functional efferents within proximal afferent pathways. Effective assembly of a key circuit underlying motor behaviors thus critically depends on trans-axonal signaling interactions resolving motor and sensory projections into discrete pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2075684020,"We identify calcium-permeable alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors on human neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and present a physiological role in neurogenesis. RNA editing of the GluR2 subunit at the Q/R site is responsible for making most AMPA receptors impermeable to calcium. Because a single-point mutation could eliminate the need for editing at the Q/R site and Q/R-unedited GluR2 exists during embryogenesis, the Q/R-unedited GluR2 subunit presumably has some important actions early in development. Using calcium imaging, we found that NPCs contain calcium-permeable AMPA receptors, whereas NPCs differentiated to neurons and astrocytes express calcium-impermeable AMPA receptors. We utilized reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and BbvI digestion to demonstrate that NPCs contain Q/R-unedited GluR2, and differentiated cells contain Q/R-edited GluR2 subunits. This is consistent with the observation that the nuclear enzyme responsible for Q/R-editing, adenosine deaminase (ADAR2), is increased during differentiation. Activation of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors induces NPCs to differentiate to the neuronal lineage and increases dendritic arbor formation in NPCs differentiated to neurons. AMPA-induced differentiation of NPCs to neurons is abrogated by overexpression of ADAR2 in NPCs. This elucidates the role of AMPA receptors as inductors of neurogenesis and provides a possible explanation for why the Q/R editing process exists."
https://openalex.org/W2010698455,"Adult's mastocytosis is usually associated with persistent systemic involvement and c-kit 816 mutation, while pediatrics disease is mostly limited to the skin and often resolves spontaneously. We prospectively included 142 adult patients with histologically proven mastocytosis. We compared phenotypic and genotypic features of adults patients whose disease started during childhood (Group 1, n = 28) with those of patients whose disease started at adult's age (Group 2, n = 114). Genotypic analysis was performed on skin biopsy by sequencing of c-kit exons 17 and 8 to 13. According to WHO classification, the percentage of systemic disease was similar (75 vs. 73%) in 2 groups. C-kit 816 mutation was found in 42% and 77% of patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p<0.001). 816 c-kit mutation was associated with systemic mastocytosis in group 2 (87% of patients with systemic mastocytosis vs. 45% with cutaneous mastocytosis, p = 0.0001). Other c-kit activating mutations were found in 23% of patients with mastocytosis' onset before the age of 5, 0% between 6 and 15 years and 2% at adults' age (p<0.001). In conclusion, pathogenesis of mastocytosis significantly differs according to the age of disease's onset. Our data may have major therapeutic relevance when considering c-kit-targeted therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2016250665,"We have previously reported the association of a mutation (c.292G > A/p.V98I) in the human HSPD1 gene that encodes the mitochondrial Hsp60 chaperonin with a dominantly inherited form of hereditary spastic paraplegia. Here, we show that the purified Hsp60-(p.V98I) chaperonin displays decreased ATPase activity and exhibits a strongly reduced capacity to promote folding of denatured malate dehydrogenase in vitro. To test its in vivo functions, we engineered a bacterial model system that lacks the endogenous chaperonin genes and harbors two plasmids carrying differentially inducible operons with human Hsp10 and wild-type Hsp60 or Hsp10 and Hsp60-(p.V98I), respectively. Ten hours after shutdown of the wild-type chaperonin operon and induction of the Hsp60-(p.V98I)/Hsp10 mutant operon, bacterial cell growth was strongly inhibited. No globally increased protein aggregation was observed, and microarray analyses showed that a number of genes involved in metabolic pathways, some of which are essential for robust aerobic growth, were strongly up-regulated in Hsp60-(p.V98I)-expressing bacteria, suggesting that the growth arrest was caused by defective folding of some essential proteins. Co-expression of Hsp60-(p.V98I) and wild-type Hsp60 exerted a dominant negative effect only when the chaperonin genes were expressed at relatively low levels. Based on our in vivo and in vitro data, we propose that the major effect of heterozygosity for the Hsp60-(p.V98I) mutation is a moderately decreased activity of chaperonin complexes composed of mixed wild-type and Hsp60-(p.V98I) mutant subunits.

The disease is traditionally classified into “pure” and “complicated” forms depending on the presence of additional neurological or systemic abnormalities. The major pathological feature is a progressive degeneration of the longest axons of the descending (corticospinal) and the ascending (sensory) tracts in the spinal cord (2Deluca G.C. Ebers G.C. Esiri M.M. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 2004; 30: 576-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Presently >30 gene loci have been mapped, and disease-associated mutations have been identified in 15 genes (3Depienne C. Stevanin G. Brice A. Durr A. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2007; 20: 674-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Judging from known functions of proteins encoded by mutated genes, two major pathogenetic mechanisms have been envisaged: one affecting axonal trafficking (4Crosby A.H. Proukakis C. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 1009-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and one affecting mitochondrial function and endurance (5Bross, P., Rugarli, E. I., Casari, G., and Langer, T. (2004) in Mitochondrial Function and Genetics (Koehler, C., and Bauer, M., eds) pp. 97–121, Springer, HeidelbergGoogle Scholar). However, because mitochondria use the axonal transportation systems and transportation requires energy, both mechanisms are clearly not mutually exclusive. Previously, while analyzing a French family with autosomal dominant pure hereditary spastic paraplegia SPG13, we detected heterozygosity for a mutation (c.292G > C; p.V98I) in the HSPD1 gene, which encodes the mitochondrial Hsp60 chaperonin (6Hansen J.J. Dürr A. Cournu-Rebeix I. Georgopoulos C. Ang D. Nielsen M.N. Davoine C.S. Brice A. Fontaine B. Gregersen N. Bross P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 70: 1328-1332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The mutation co-segregated with the disease in the large pedigree. Functional testing using a genetic complementation assay in Escherichia coli showed that the Hsp60-(p.V98I) mutant protein was functionally compromised. Hsp60 represents the large subunit of the mitochondrial Hsp60/Hsp10 chaperonin complex, homologue of the comprehensively investigated GroEL/GroES system from E. coli (7Horwich A.L. Farr G.W. Fenton W.A. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 1917-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The functional units of these chaperonins consist of heptameric rings of the large subunit (Hsp60 or GroEL), which function as either single rings or back-to-back double rings, depending on the organism. In a cyclic reaction, Hsp60 ring complexes bind one unfolded substrate protein per ring, followed by the binding of ATP and association with the heptameric ring of the co-chaperonin Hsp10 (GroES). This leads to sequestration of the substrate protein in the inner cavity of Hsp60 where, for a certain period of time, it can fold undisturbed by other cell components. Synchronous hydrolysis of ATP in all Hsp60 subunits results in the release of the substrate protein. Null mutations in the Hsp60 gene are lethal in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, and E. coli (8Cheng M.Y. Hartl F.U. Martin J. Pollock R.A. Kalousek F. Neupert W. Hallberg E.M.

A detailed analysis of chaperonin substrates has been performed for E. coli GroEL, where it is estimated that 10–15% of the cytosolic proteins use GroEL for folding, and ∼300 of these proteins have been identified experimentally (12Ewalt K.L.

To shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying spastic paraplegia due to the Hsp60-(p.V98I) mutation, we expressed and purified the corresponding mutant protein and analyzed its properties and ability to assist folding of a model protein in vitro. In addition, we have engineered a flexible E. coli experimental system that has allowed us to monitor various phenotypes in E. coli and to study potential dominant negative effects of co-expression of mutant Hsp60-(p.V98I) and wild-type Hsp60. Purification of Hsp60 and Hsp10—Derivatives of the pET3a-derived expression plasmid encoding the Hsp60-(p.G67S) variant (14Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6003) Google Scholar) with wild-type (glycine at position 67) and Hsp60-(p.V98I) were generated by standard methods. A fragment comprising the groES and groEL genes was amplified from E. coli and inserted into pET24d. Recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) (15Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G. Bergmeier W. Weiss C. Kessel M. Goloubinoff P. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) in 1 liter of shaking flasks by inducing (2 mm IPTG) 3The abbreviations used are: IPTG, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; qRT, quantitative reverse transcription. protein expression at A532 = 0.8. After expression at 37 °C for 4 h cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication. Following pelletting of cell debris by ultracentrifugation for 30 min at 45,000 × g, the protein solution was dialyzed and fractionated by cation exchange chromatography. Hsp60- or GroEL-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed into 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 20 mm magnesium acetate, 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5. The dialyzed samples were concentrated to 10 mg/ml, reconstituted (16Kamireddi M. Eisenstein E. Reddy P. Protein Expr. Purif. 1997; 11: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), centrifuged, and heptameric or tetradecameric chaperonin-purified by using an Superose 6 gel filtration (GE-Healthcare, Hillerød). Final purity, as judged by SDS-PAGE, was >95%. The co-chaperonins GroES and Hsp10 were expressed and purified according to (17Dickson R. Larsen B. Viitanen P.V. Tormey M.B. Geske J. Strange R.

J. 1993; 291: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), respectively. In Vitro folding and ATPase Activity Assays—Folding reactions were done in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 7 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol (Buffer A). Porcine malate dehydrogenase (Roche Applied Science, 62.5 nm) was denatured in 10 mm HCl for 1 h and diluted 50-fold into Buffer A containing 1.3 μm chaperonin and 2.6 μm co-chaperonin. Concentrations are with respect to monomers. Following incubation at 37 °C for 5 min, folding was initiated by the addition of 0.5 mm ATP. Incubation was continued for 90–105 min. Aliquots were drawn at different time points, and the enzymatic activity was determined according to a previous study (19Carlier M.F. Pantaloni D. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1918-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). ATPase activity was measured at room temperature in Buffer A containing 1.3 μm chaperonin, 2.6 μm co-chaperonin, and [γ-32P]ATP according to a previous study (20Miller, J. H. (1972) Experiments in Molecular Genetics, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar). Bacterial in Vivo System—As starting material we used the B178 (groELS)-deleted strain that is maintained alive by the pOFX HSP60(wt)–HSP10(wt) plasmid (Hansen et al. 6Hansen J.J. Dürr A. Cournu-Rebeix I. Georgopoulos C. Ang D. Nielsen M.N. Davoine C.S. Brice A. Fontaine B. Gregersen N. Bross P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 70: 1328-1332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). This strain was subsequently transformed with a second plasmid, a derivative of pBAD/hisA (Invitrogen), that contains an operon expressing Hsp10 and either wild-type or different mutant variants of Hsp60 under control of the arabinose-inducible BAD promoter (Fig. 2A). Bacterial Growth Experiments—Double-transformed cells were grown in dYT medium (21Corydon T.J. Bross P. Holst H.U. Neve S. Kristiansen K. Gregersen N. Bolund L. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) supplemented with kanamycin (10 mg/liter), ampicillin (100 mg/liter), and IPTG (0.1 mm) at 30 °C in a shaking water bath. At A536 ≈ 0.1 bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at ambient temperature, resuspended in fresh medium, and split into aliquots, and the appropriate inducers were added. RNA and Protein Analyses—Samples for RNA analyses were treated with RNAPROTECT (Qiagen), harvested by centrifugation, and frozen. Total RNA was purified using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Microarray analysis was performed using the E. coli antisense array from Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA). cDNA synthesis, labeling, and hybridization were performed as recommended by the microarray manufacturer and normalized using GENECHIP (Affymetrix) software. Primary data sets are accessible through the Gene Expression Omnibus (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo; accession no. GSE10974). For qRT-PCR cDNA was synthesized from 0.5 μg of total RNA using the Advantage® RT-for-PCR kit (Clontech). Subsequent qRT-PCR analysis was performed using custom designed TaqMan® gene expression assays run on an ABI Prism® 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Relative transcript levels were calculated using the comparative CT method (22Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (123336) Google Scholar). Samples for protein analysis (from 2–6 ml of culture) were harvested by centrifugation, frozen, and lysed as described previously (6Hansen J.J. Dürr A. Cournu-Rebeix I. Georgopoulos C. Ang D. Nielsen M.N. Davoine C.S. Brice A. Fontaine B. Gregersen N. Bross P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 70: 1328-1332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Gels were blotted to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) and stained immunologically using the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies and ECLplus (GE-Healthcare) as recommended by the manufacturers. Antibodies directed against E. coli alkaline phosphatase were from ABCAM, Cambridge (ab354), and polyclonal antiserum against MetE was a generous gift of Dr. Elise Hondorp (University of Michigan). Measurement of Hsp60 by Immunoassay Based on xMAP Technology—See supplemental data. Mass Spectrometric Quantitation of Peptide Variants—For relative quantification of the Hsp60 peptide variants the region of the lane containing Hsp60 protein was excised from a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel, digested with trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI), and subsequently analyzed by reverse phase (3.5 μm Kromasil C18, Eka Chemicals, Bohus) liquid chromatography coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The peptide, LXQDVANNTNEEAGDGTTTATVLAR, corresponding to the wild-type (X = V) and mutant (X = I) variant eluted at ∼20 and 21% acetonitrile, respectively. The peptides were identified by tandem MS spectra (Sequest algorithm, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and quantified by integrated peak area, from full scan peptide signal, by Genesis algorithm in the Qual browser (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Purified Hsp60-p.V98I Is Compromised in Its Ability to Promote Refolding in Vitro—Following recombinant expression in E. coli, wild-type Hsp60, the disease-causing Hsp60-(p.V98I) mutant protein, and the variant Hsp60-(p.G67S) were purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The Hsp60-(p.G67S) variant was included in the analysis as an additional wild-type control, because this variation was present in a Hsp60 cDNA clone (23Venner T.J. Singh B. Gupta R.S. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and the corresponding variant protein has been analyzed by many laboratories as wild-type Hsp60. All Hsp60 proteins were first purified as monomers and, prior to in vitro refolding assays, assembled as native heptamer complexes that were re-purified by gel filtration chromatography (15Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G. Bergmeier W. Weiss C. Kessel M. Goloubinoff P. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 24Nielsen K.L. Cowan N.J. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 93-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Native complexes were obtained in similar amounts for all three variant proteins (data not shown), demonstrating that Hsp60-(p.V98I) subunits are efficiently assembled into chaperonin ring complexes. Wild-type Hsp10 was purified separately. Fig. 1A shows the ability of the various chaperonin complexes to refold denatured malate dehydrogenase. The refolding kinetics for wild-type Hsp60/Hsp10, Hsp60-(p.G67S)/Hsp10, and GroEL/GroES were very similar and resulted in 60–70% refolding. In contrast, Hsp60-(p.V98I)/Hsp10 displayed severely decreased refolding activity. Specifically, while the initial rate of folding was identical for GroEL/GroES, and the two wild-type Hsp60/Hsp10 controls, it was ∼100-fold lower for Hsp60-(p.V98I)/Hsp10. Furthermore, the ability to inhibit spontaneous refolding of malate dehydrogenase usually observed in the presence of surplus active chaperonins due to the binding and stabilization of the denatured protein (compare bovine serum albumin with wild-type chaperonins) was not apparent in the case of Hsp60-(p.V98I). This suggests that the conformational state of this mutant in the absence of ATP is limited in its ability to bind denatured protein. That this was not caused by differences in quaternary structure was documented by gel filtration (supplemental Fig. S1). However, the folding activity of Hsp60-(p.V98I) was not completely abolished, because the initial rate of refolding of denatured malate dehydrogenase in its presence was ∼4-fold higher than in the presence of the negative control albumin. In parallel experiments we measured the ATPase activity of all of our Hsp60 variants. We found that, although all exhibited ATPase activity, the initial rate for Hsp60-(p.V98I) was substantially reduced (31%) compared with that of the wild-type variants (Fig. 1B). Taken together, the kinetic data demonstrate that the Hsp60-(p.V98I) mutant displays a reduced ATPase hydrolysis rate and a severely decreased, but not fully abolished folding activity. Valine 74 in GroEL, which corresponds to the mutated valine 98 in human Hsp60, is positioned in the equatorial domain, but distant from the ATP binding site. Therefore, the effect of the V98I mutation on ATPase activity is not due to direct interference with the ATPase active site. Rather, it may affect conformational changes in the ring that accompany ATP binding and precede ATP hydrolysis. It has been shown that GroEL subunits exhibit positive intra-ring cooperativity with respect to ATP binding and that mutations that decrease this cooperativity result in decreased folding rates (25Danziger O. Rivenzon-Segal D. Wolf S.G. Horovitz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13797-13802Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A Bacterial System for Investigating the in Vivo Effects of the Hsp60-(p. V98I) Variant—To address the question of how the decreased chaperonin activity of the Hsp60-(p.V98I) variant protein affects a cellular system where folding of a subset of proteins depends on chaperonin activity, we engineered a well defined and easily manipulatable E. coli system in which expression of two plasmid-encoded chaperonin operons can be separately turned on and off. These cells carry a deletion of the essential endogenous groES/groEL genes and are maintained alive by a plasmid expressing an IPTG-inducible operon encoding human Hsp10 and the mature form of wild-type Hsp60 (Fig. 2A, upper panel). Into this strain we introduced a second plasmid, which is independently replicated and selectable, expressing Hsp10 and either wild-type or the respective mutant Hsp60 cDNA under control of an arabinose-inducible promoter (Fig. 2A, lower panel). These two cell types, carrying either wild-type Hsp60 or Hsp60-(p.V98I) on the second plasmid, were grown in the presence of IPTG to specifically induce the expression of the wild-type chaperonin operon present on the first plasmid. At an optical density of ∼0.1, cultures were split into four aliquots, and the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing the appropriate inducers to specifically express the different chaperonin operons alone or in combination, or with no inducers to shut off chaperonin expression. Three independent transformants with Hsp60-(p.V98I) and two with wild-type Hsp60 on the second plasmid were investigated. When shifted to expression of the Hsp60-(p.V98I) chaperonin operon on the second plasmid, cells stopped growing after 8–10 h, whereas cells shifted to expression of the wild-type chaperonin operon on the second plasmid continued growth for at least 25 h (Fig. 2B, upper left panel). These results are in agreement with our previous finding that Hsp60-(p.V98I) is unable to support growth of E. coli cells lacking the endogenous chaperonin genes. Cultures depleted for chaperonin expression also stopped growing, yet at a somewhat earlier time point (Fig. 2B, lower left panel). The growth curves of all investigated clones of the two cell types were very similar when only the wild-type chaperonin operon on the first plasmid was induced (Fig. 2B, upper right panel), showing that all wild-type constructs are fully functional and that the observed growth differences were indeed related to expression of the respective Hsp60 variant. Bacteria that were induced for both wild-type Hsp60 and Hsp60-(p.V98I) continued to grow for at least 25 h (Fig. 2B, lower right panel). Yet the growth properties of the three independent clones varied significantly, with two out of the three clones showing a clearly slower growth rate than the cells co-expressing two wild-type chaperonin operons. Analysis of the protein profiles in the soluble and insoluble fractions (supplemental Fig. S2) showed distinct differences depending on the inducers added. However, there were no noticeable differences between the cells shifted to expression of the arabinose-induced Hsp60-(p.V98I) versus wild-type Hsp60 chaperonin operon. In particular, we noted no qualitative or quantitative increases in protein bands in the insoluble fraction of lysates from Hsp60-(p.V98I)-expressing cells. This indicates that no wholesale aggregation of proteins occurred in the cells expressing the Hsp60-(p.V98I) mutant protein, in contrast to the vast protein aggregation seen with a temperature-sensitive GroEL variant (26Chapman E. Farr G.W. Usaite R. Furtak K. Fenton W.A. Chaudhuri T.K. Hondorp E.R. Matthews R.G. Wolf S.G. Yates J.R. Pypaert M. Horwich A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15800-15805Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Transcript Changes Related to Expression of Hsp60-(p.V98I)—To identify regulatory responses that could give clues as to the cause(s) of the growth arrest observed in the Hsp60-(p.V98I)-expressing cells, we performed microarray analyses. We reasoned that the decreased chaperonin activity of the Hsp60-(p.V98I) protein would greatly impair or abolish folding of E. coli proteins that depend on chaperonin assistance. The resulting decreased levels of various activities may cause compensatory up-regulation or deregulation of genes. The transcriptomes of cells shifted to expression of the arabinose-inducible chaperonin operon with either the Hsp60-(p.V98I) mutant or the wild-type Hsp60 from the second plasmid were compared. RNA samples from three independent cultures expressing the mutant or two independent cultures expressing wild-type Hsp60 were pooled, respectively. We identified 61 genes (40 transcript units) that were up-regulated by a factor of ≥3 and 65 (61 transcript units) that were down-regulated by a factor of ≥3 (supplemental Tables S1 and S2). Nine of the 61 strongly up-regulated genes have previously been characterized as essential for robust aerobic growth in rich media (27Gerdes S.Y. Scholle M.D. Campbell J.W. Balazsi G. Ravasz E. Daugherty M.D. Somera A.L. Kyrpides N.C. Anderson I. Gelfand M.S. Bhattacharya A. Kapatral V. D'Souza M. Baev M.V. Grechkin Y. Mseeh F. Fonstein M.Y. Overbeek R. Barabasi A.L. Oltvai Z.N. Osterman A.L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5673-5684Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, only two of the up-regulated genes (metF and sdhA) encode proteins that are obligatory GroEL substrates (class III), and one (gatD) represents a substrate that partially depends on GroEL (class II (13Kerner M.J. Naylor D.J. Ishihama Y. Maier T. Chang H.C. Stines A.P. Georgopoulos C. Frishman D. Hayer-Hartl M. Mann M. Hartl F.U. Cell. 2005; 122: 209-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar)). The metF gene and an additional 10 strongly up-regulated genes (comprising five transcription units) are controlled by the MetJ transcriptional regulator and eleven (comprising three transcriptional units) by the PhoB transcriptional activator. Strong up-regulation of the MetJ-repressor-controlled metE gene upon depletion or temperature-inactivation of GroEL has been reported in two studies from the Horwich laboratory (26Chapman E. Farr G.W. Usaite R. Furtak K. Fenton W.A. Chaudhuri T.K. Hondorp E.R. Matthews R.G. Wolf S.G. Yates J.R. Pypaert M. Horwich A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15800-15805Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 28Horwich A.L. Low K.B. Fenton W.A. Hirshfield I.N. Furtak K. Cell. 1993; 74: 909-917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The MetJ protein acts both as a repressor in the presence of the downstream metabolite S-adenosylmethionine and as an activator in its absence. Decreased levels of MetF activity would result in reduced amounts of S-adenosylmethionine and cause increased transcription of MetJ/S-adenosylmethionine-repressed genes. Surprisingly, genes that are strongly induced by heat shock (29Richmond C.S. Glasner J.D. Mau R. Jin H. Blattner F.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3821-3835Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), high level expression of a misfolded protein (30Lesley S.A. Graziano J. Cho C.Y. Knuth M.W. Klock H.E. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), or oxidative stress (31Zheng M. Wang X. Templeton L.J. Smulski D.R. LaRossa R.A. Storz G. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4562-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) were not among the ≥3-fold up-regulated genes in the cells shifted to Hsp60-(p.V98I) expression. An ∼2-fold up-regulation of the chaperone gene clpB and the protease gene lon and a moderate (<2-fold) up-regulation of the dnaK/dnaJ chaperone system and the hslU protease subunit genes were observed (data not shown). Nevertheless, this represents a much lower induction level than that observed by other authors upon heat shock or expression of a misfolding protein (29Richmond C.S. Glasner J.D. Mau R. Jin H. Blattner F.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3821-3835Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 30Lesley S.A. Graziano J. Cho C.Y. Knuth M.W. Klock H.E. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The ≥3-fold down-regulated genes encode a number of enzymes, transport proteins and regulators (supplemental Table S2). Interestingly, the regulators for the strongly up-regulated genes are mostly distinct from those of the strongly down-regulated ones. A number of both up- and down-regulated genes are controlled by the global regulator CRP (32Martinez-Antonio A. Collado-Vides J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 482-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), with CRP functioning as a repressor for the down-regulated genes and as an inducer for the respective up-regulated genes. Furthermore, transcript levels of several genes involved in response to acid stress (33Bearson S. Bearson B. Foster J.W. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 147: 173-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Zwir I. Shin D. Kato A. Nishino K. Latifi T. Solomon F. Hare J.M. Huang H. Groisman E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2862-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) were strongly decreased in cells expressing Hsp60-(p.V98I). PhoP, which is a transcriptional regulator of this response, has been classified as a partially GroEL-dependent protein. Taken together, our transcript analyses suggest that the observed growth arrest is most likely due to impaired folding of a small number of proteins that are essential for robust growth, and it appears to occur before misfolded proteins accumulate. Effects of Hsp60-(p.V98I) Co-expression—We determined the relative concentrations of total soluble Hsp60 protein in samples taken 10 h after inducer shift (Table 1). Hsp60 levels in the depleted cells dropped to 2–3 μg of Hsp60 per milligram of total protein, demarcating the lower threshold level for growth of E. coli. Cells only induced for the IPTG-inducible wild-type chaperonin operon displayed 3- to 4-fold higher Hsp60 levels, whereas cells only induced for the arabinose-inducible chaperonin operon displayed 10- to 30-fold higher levels. The values for the relative Hsp60 concentrations must be taken with caution as total protein concentration was determined with bovine serum albumin as standard likely leading to an overestimation of the values given by up to a factor of 2. Comparing the obtained values we noticed that in cells induced for both chaperonin operons the relative Hsp60 concentration was substantially higher than the sum of the levels in cells induced for each operon alone. The reason for this unexpected result is unknown.TABLE 1Measurement of relative Hsp60 expression levelsInductionwt/wt, average (range)wt/V981, average (range)μg/mg-/+32.7 (21.7-43.6)96.0 (40.6-124)+/-8.97 (5.35-12.6)9.40 (6.25-13.2)-/-2.60 (2.45-2.75)2.16 (1.0-3.15)+/+213 (141-286)296 (165-385) Open table in a new tab To determine the fractions of wild-type Hsp60 and Hsp60-(p.V98I) protein in cells co-expressing both variants we performed mass spectrometry and quantitation of tryptic peptides in which the V98I mutation is situated (Table 2). Assuming that the two Hsp60 species associate as well with each other as with themselves, then the calculated relative amounts of heptameric chaperonin complexes consisting of wild-type subunits only were 12.27 μg/mg total soluble protein (Table 2). This is in the same range as in cells induced for wild-type Hsp60, and there may thus be a sufficient amount of chaperonin complexes consisting of wild-type subunits only to support growth.TABLE 2Fraction of wild-type Hsp60 in cells carrying Hsp60-(p.V98I) on the second plasmidInductionFraction of wild-type Hsp60, average (range)Calculated levels of pure wt complexes, average (range)μg/mg soluble protein-/+0.138 (0.0936-0.160)6.35 × 10-4 (1.03 × 10-5-9.89 × 10-4)+/+0.620 (0.568-0.657)12.27 (3.22-18.43) Open table in a new tab We chose the MetJ-controlled metE gene and the PhoB-regulated phoA gene as representatives of genes strongly up-regulated in response to expression of malfunctioning Hsp60-(p.V98I) and determined their transcript levels in the individual cell cultures by qRT-PCR. Both metE and phoA transcripts were strongly up-regulated in all three cultures shifted to expression of the Hsp60-(p.V98I) operon (Fig. 3). Cultures depleted for chaperonins or cultures expressing only the wild-type chaperonin operon on the first plasmid displayed low levels of metE and phoA transcripts, and in these cases there was no significant difference between the cells harboring either wild-type or mutant Hsp60 on the second plasmid. Interestingly, cells in which wild-type Hsp60 and Hsp60-(p.V98I) were co-expressed had moderately increased levels of both metE and phoA transcripts compared with cells expressing two wild-type chaperonin operons. This suggests that co-expression of Hsp60-(p.V98I) mutant subunits has some impact on the cells, in accordance with the moderate growth phenotype differences described above. Analysis of MetE and PhoA protein levels by Western blotting showed that both proteins were indeed present at higher levels in the soluble extracts from cells shifted to expression of Hsp60-(p.V98I) (Fig. 4). However, scanning of the Western blots (data not shown) showed that the protein levels were increased to a lesser extent than the corresponding transcript levels. Assessment of a Potential Dominant Negative Effect—To further explore the impact of the Hsp60-(p.V98I) mutant, we monitored bacterial growth of cells co-expressing wild-type Hsp60 and Hsp60-(p.V98I) and cells co-expressing wild-type and an ATPase-deficient Hsp60 mutant (Hsp60-(p.D423A). The ATPase-deficient mutant was constructed in analogy to the D398A mutant of E. coli GroEL that alters a residue in the ATPase active site and has been shown to form chaperonin complexes that possess only ∼2% ATPase activity (35Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xu Z.H. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Co-expression of the Hsp60-(p.D423A) active site mutant with wild-type Hsp60 resulted in a severe growth defect with characteristics comparable to those of chaperonin depletion (Fig. 5). In contrast to the active site mutant, co-expression of Hsp60-(p.V98I) with wild-type Hsp60 only moderately affected bacterial growth (see also growth curves from the experiment shown in Fig. 2A). Growth curves of cells co-expressing wild-type Hsp60 and a doubly mutated Hsp60-(p.V98I-D423A) variant protein showed defective growth in the same fashion as in cells co-expressing the wild-type Hsp60 and the single ATPase mutant (supplemental Fig. S3). This is consistent with the notion that Hsp60 subunits with the V98I mutation are freely incorporated into heterocomplexes with wild-type Hsp60 subunits. In Vivo Demonstration of a Dosage Effect—If high level co-expression of both wild-type Hsp60 and Hsp60-(p.V98I) operons from the two plasmids results in relatively moderate effects, it should be possible to identify in vivo conditions where the combined expression levels of two wild-type chaperonin operons can still support growth, whereas the corresponding combined levels of a wild-type and Hsp60-(p.V98I) mutant operon cannot. To find such in vivo conditions, we systematically varied both the growth temperature and the levels of wild-type Hsp60 and Hsp60-(p.V98I) by carefully titrating the two inducers. We found that, at a concentration of 0.04% arabinose and 20 μm IPTG, both cell types formed colonies at 40 °C (Fig. 6). However, upon a further reduction of the IPTG concentration to 10 μm, i.e. a further down-regulation of the IPTG-induced wild-type Hsp60 operon in both cell types, only the cells possessing an arabinose-induced wild-type chaperonin operon on the second plasmid formed colonies. This “dosage effect” is consistent with the notion that Hsp60 heterocomplexes possess decreased chaperonin activity such that at relatively low levels of wild-type chaperonin, a “poisonous” effect of the V98I mutant can be readily detected. Conclusions—Based on our findings the V98I mutation affects the ATPase activity and results in a dramatically decreased folding activity of complexes consisting of the mutant subunits only. However, in contrast to an artificially constructed ATPase mutant, the V98I mutation exerts no salient dominant negative effect when co-expressed with wild-type Hsp60. Because no effect of the mutations on complex assembly was observed, we assume that heptameric complexes with all possible combinations and arrangements of subunits are formed. Incorporation of only one or two ATPase mutant subunits has a dramatic effect, whereas complexes composed of Hsp60-(p.V98I) and wild-type Hsp60 subunits appear to possess reduced but residual activity. Regarding the situation in mitochondria of SPG13 patients that contain both wild-type and Hsp60-(p.V98I) mutant protein, our results suggest that subtly reduced chaperonin activity is the major effect. Such subtly reduced chaperonin activity will cause reduced folding and premature degradation of a subset of proteins, resulting among other things in decreased activities of certain enzymes. This subtle defect may be partially compensated in most tissues by up-regulation of the chaperonin genes, tuning of the transcription of other genes involved in mitochondrial protein quality control, or by increased expression of genes encoding the affected proteins. However, in mitochondria that are situated in the distal part of the body's longest axons, these compensatory mechanisms may be greatly limited due to the long distance (up to 1 meter) between axonal mitochondria and the cell body with the nucleus. The validity of our hypothesis will have to be eventually tested by studying animal models in which the appropriate tissues are accessible.

The reduction of the carbon-carbon double bond in an α,β-unsaturated ketone by 5β-reductase is a unique reaction in steroid enzymology because hydride transfer from NADPH to the β-face of a Δ4-3-ketosteroid yields a cis-A/B-ring configuration with an ∼90° bend in steroid structure. Here, we report the first x-ray crystal structure of a mammalian steroid hormone carbon-carbon double bond reductase, human Δ4-3-ketosteroid 5β-reductase (AKR1D1), and its complexes with intact substrates. We have determined the structures of AKR1D1 complexes with NADP+ at 1.79- and 1.35-Å resolution (HEPES bound in the active site), NADP+ and cortisone at 1.90-Å resolution, NADP+ and progesterone at 2.03-Å resolution, and NADP+ and testosterone at 1.62-Å resolution. Complexes with cortisone and progesterone reveal productive substrate binding orientations based on the proximity of each steroid carbon-carbon double bond to the re-face of the nicotinamide ring of NADP+. This orientation would permit 4-pro-(R)-hydride transfer from NADPH. Each steroid carbonyl accepts hydrogen bonds from catalytic residues Tyr58 and Glu120. The Y58F and E120A mutants are devoid of activity, supporting a role for this dyad in the catalytic mechanism. Intriguingly, testosterone binds nonproductively, thereby rationalizing the substrate inhibition observed with this particular steroid.

The locations of disease-linked mutations thought to be responsible for bile acid deficiency are also revealed. The Δ4-3-ketosteroid functionality is present in all steroid hormones except estrogens. The first step in their metabolism involves the reduction of the Δ4-ene to produce either 5α- or 5β-dihydrosteroids in reactions catalyzed by steroid 5α- or 5β-reductase, respectively (1Tomkins G. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1956; 12: 125-133PubMed Google Scholar). These two enzymes belong to distinct gene superfamilies (2Russell D.W. Wilson J.D. Annu. Rev.

In utilizing NADPH as hydride donor, the enzymatic reaction introduces a 90° bend at the steroid A/B-ring junction, which adopts a cis-A/B- or β-configuration (Fig. 1) (5Berséus O. Danielsson H.

In the absence of enzyme catalysis, this reaction is extremely difficult to perform with chemical reductants. Treatment with borohydride favors formation of the 3β-allylic alcohol, and under harsher conditions, the 3β,5α-tetrahydrosteroid is formed (8Norymberski J.K. Woods G.F. J. Chem. Soc. (Lond.). 1955; : 3426-3430Crossref Google Scholar, 9March J. Smith M.B. March J Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms and Structure. John Wiley & Sons, Inc, New York1984: 694-695Google Scholar). It is possible to generate a 5β-cholestane from the corresponding Δ4-3-ketosteroid only if a large directing group is placed at C-4 or C-7 to direct the face of hydride addition or catalytic hydrogenation (10Michalak K. Stepanenko W. Wicha J. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 2000; : 1587-1594Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 11Takeda K. Osaka H. Akio H. Shionogi et al.Yakugaku Zasshi. 1961; 81: 325-330Crossref Google Scholar). Notably, AKR1D1 exclusively generates the reduced steroid bearing a thermodynamically less favorable 5β-configuration. Moreover, the enzyme reduces only the Δ4-ene, leaving the 3-oxo group intact. Thus, AKR1D1 catalyzes a reaction that is unique in steroid enzymology, and it accomplishes this with ease in comparison with chemical methods.FIGURE 1Reduction of the carbon-carbon double bond at C-5 of a Δ4-3-ketosteroid to form a 5β-dihydrosteroid as catalyzed by AKR1D1.

The cDNA for the corresponding human enzyme was cloned but characterized only in mammalian cell expression assays (3Kondo K.-H. Kai M.H. Setoguchi Y. Eggersten G. Sjöblom P. Setoguchi Y. Okuda K.I.

Weiner H. Maser E. Lindhal R. Plapp B Enzymology and Molecular Biology of Carbonyl Metabolism. Purdue University Press, West Lafayette, IN2007: 332-340Google Scholar). These studies showed that a single enzyme could catalyze the reduction of C18-27Δ4-3-ketosteroids, yielding the corresponding 5β-dihydrosteroids. This enzyme thus plays an important role in the biosynthesis of bile acids (14Russell D.W. Setchell K.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4737-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 15Russell D.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 137-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). For example, AKR1D1 reduces Δ4-cholesten-7α-ol-3-one and Δ4-cholesten-7α,12α-diol-3-one to 5β-cholestan-7α-ol-3-one and 5β-cholestan-7α,12α-diol-3-one, respectively; in turn, these two 5β-dihydrosteroids yield the bile acid precursors 5β-cholestan-3α,7α-diol and 5β-cholestan-3α,7α,12α-triol in reactions catalyzed by 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases that belong to the same gene family, AKR1C1-AKR1C4 (4Jez J.M.

Subsequent oxidation of the side chain of 5β-cholestan-3α,7α-diol and 5β-cholestan-3α,7α,12α-triol yields the primary bile acids chenodeoxycholate and cholic acid, respectively. AKR1D1 deficiency results in accumulation of C27 bile acid precursors bearing intact Δ4-3-oxo groups, which, upon reduction by steroid 5α-reductase, can be converted to allo-bile acids (15Russell D.W.

To date, the crystal structures of many of the human AKRs have been reported, including aldehyde reductase (AKR1A1) (23El-Kabbani O. Green N.C. Lin G. Carson M. Narayana S.V. Moore K.M. Flynn T.G.

Even though these hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases share significant amino acid sequence identity, these crystal structures illuminate the roles of specific residues that contribute to the differing substrate specificities among these enzymes. All AKR structures to date contain a conserved catalytic tetrad of Tyr55, Lys84, His117, and Asp50 (numbering scheme based on AKR1C9, rat 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase). In contrast, AKR1D1 is the only AKR to have a modified catalytic tetrad: His117 is replaced by Glu120 and is proposed to play an important role in AKR1D1 catalysis (34Jez J.M. Penning T.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9695-9703Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition to the above-mentioned hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase structures, the crystal structure of a novel short chain dehydrogenase/reductase, 5β-reductase from Digitalis lanata, has been reported recently (35Thorn A. Egerer-Sieber C. Jäeger C.M. Herl V. Müeller-Uri F. Kreis W. Muller Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; (November 21)10.1074/jbc.M706185200PubMed Google Scholar). However, this reductase is unrelated in that it adopts a Rossmann fold. Here, we report the first x-ray crystal structure of a mammalian steroid hormone carbon-carbon double bond reductase, human Δ4-3-ketosteroid 5β-reductase (AKR1D1). We have determined the structures of AKR1D1 complexed with NADP+ at 1.79-Å resolution, NADP+ and cortisone at 1.90-Å resolution, NADP+ and progesterone at 2.03-Å resolution, and NADP+ and testosterone at 1.62-Å resolution. Additionally, we report the crystal structures of the binary complex with NADP+ at 1.35-Å resolution (containing a HEPES buffer molecule bound in the active site). These structures provide valuable inferences regarding the catalytic mechanism and also illuminate the possible effects of single point mutations responsible for bile acid deficiency. Materials—The vectors pET16b and pET28a were purchased from Novagen. E. coli strain C41(DE3) was provided by Dr. J. E. Walker (Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK). The QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit was purchased from Stratagene. Restriction endonucleases were purchased from New England Biolabs. Synthetic oligonucleotides were obtained from Invitrogen. NADPH was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Steroids were purchased from Steraloids, Inc. [4-14C]Testosterone (50 mCi/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Nickel-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. All other reagents were of ACS quality or higher. Construction of Expression Vectors—Previously, we reported the purification and characterization of recombinant AKR1D1 expressed from a pET16b vector (13Drury J.E. Penning T.M. Weiner H. Maser E. Lindhal R. Plapp B Enzymology and Molecular Biology of Carbonyl Metabolism. Purdue University Press, West Lafayette, IN2007: 332-340Google Scholar). This enzyme was refractory to crystallization, and therefore, a different expression vector was generated. The pET16b-AKR1D1 expression vector was digested with NdeI and BamHI to remove the cDNA for AKR1D1. The resultant fragment was subcloned into the expression vector pET28a. The AKR1D1 insert was verified by dideoxy sequencing. The expression vectors for AKR1D1(Y58F) and AKR1D1 (E120A) were made using the pET16b-AKR1D1 construct as a template by conducting site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange method following the manufacturer's protocol. The following forward and reverse primers were used (where the boldface nucleotides indicate the mutation introduced): for the Y58F mutant, 5′-dGGG GCC TAC ATC TTC CAA AAT GAA CAC GAA GTT GG-3′ and 5′-dCC AAC TTC GTG TTC ATT TTG GAA GAT GTA GGC CCC-3′; and for the E120A mutant, 5′-dG GAT CTT TAC ATC ATT GCA GTA CCA ATG GCC TTT AAG C-3′ and 5′-dG CTT AAA GGC CAT TGG TAC TGC AAT GAT GTA AAG ATC C-3′. The introduction of these mutations into the pET16b-AKR1D1 construct was verified by dideoxy sequencing. Expression and Purification of AKR1D1—The pET28a-AKR1D1 expression vector was used to transform competent E. coli C41(DE3) cells. The cells were grown in 4-liter cultures of Luria-Bertani medium at 37 °C (containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin). Upon reaching A600 = 0.6, 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to induce enzyme expression overnight. The following day, the culture was centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 × g, and the pellets were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) and 5 mm imidazole. Resuspensions were lysed by sonication and centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant was dialyzed overnight in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 20 mm imidazole, and 0.5 m NaCl. The dialyzed fraction was loaded onto a nickel-Sepharose column equilibrated with the dialysis buffer, and the column was washed with the same buffer. Bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 20-400 mm imidazole. Active fractions containing AKR1D1 were identified by monitoring the conversion of [4-14C]testosterone to 5β-dihydrotestosterone by discontinuous assay using standard assay conditions and by visualization of the protein content of each fraction by SDS-PAGE. Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm EDTA. The final specific activity of the recombinant enzyme was 80 nmol of testosterone reduced per min/mg. The mutant proteins AKR1D1(Y58F) and AKR1D1(E120A) were purified in a similar manner. Standard Radiometric Assay—The reduction of [4-14C]testosterone was used to monitor 5β-reductase activity collected during purification and for activity measurements. Reactions contained 2 μm [4-14C]testosterone (40,000 dpm), 8 μm unlabeled testosterone, 5% acetonitrile, and 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0). Reactions were initiated by the addition of 200 μm NADPH and performed at 37 °C. The substrate and product of the quenched reaction were separated by TLC and quantitated by scintillation counting. Crystallography—The ternary complexes of AKR1D1·NADP+·testosterone, AKR1D1·NADP+·cortisone, AKR1D1·NADP+·progesterone, and AKR1D1·NADP+·HEPES were crystallized by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 4 °C. In a typical experiment, drops containing 4.0 μl of enzyme solution (5.0 mg/ml AKR1D1, 2.0 mm NADP+, 2.0 mm steroid, and 10.0 mm Tris (pH 7.4)) and 4.0 μl of precipitant buffer (0.1 m HEPES/Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 10-20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, and 10% isopropyl alcohol) were equilibrated against a 1-ml reservoir of precipitant buffer. Diamond-like crystals appeared in ∼2-3 days with typical dimensions of 0.2 × 0.3 × 0.5 mm. Crystals of each AKR1D1·NADP+·steroid complex were further soaked for 1 week in the same mother liquor solution augmented with 5.0 mm NADP+ and 5.0 mm steroid to ensure complete ligand occupancy. Following transfer to a 28% glycerol cryoprotectant solution and flash-cooling, crystals of the AKR1D1·NADP+·testosterone complex yielded diffraction data to 1.62-Å resolution at the Advanced Light Source (beamline 8.2.2, λ = 1.000 Å, 100 K). Diffraction intensities measured from these crystals indicated a space group P212121 with unit cell parameters a = 49.8, b = 110.1, and c = 129.4 Å. There were two molecules in the asymmetric unit and the Matthews coefficient VM = 2.4 Å3/Da, corresponding to a solvent content of 48.5%. Crystals of the AKR1D1·NADP+·cortisone, AKR1D1·NADP+·progesterone, and AKR1D1·NADP+·HEPES complexes yielded diffraction data to 1.90-, 2.03-, and 1.35-Å resolution, respectively, at Brookhaven National Laboratory (beamlines X6A and X29A, λ = 1.000 Å, 100 K) and were found to be isomorphous with crystals of the AKR1D1·NADP+·testosterone complex (Table 1).

Open table in a new tab For crystallization of the AKR1D1·NADP+ complex, hanging drops containing 4.0 μl of enzyme solution (5.0 mg/ml AKR1D1, 2 mm NADPH, 2.0 mm 5β-cholestan-3-one, and 10.0 mm Tris (pH 7.4)) and 4.0 μl of precipitant buffer (0.1 m Tris/HEPES (pH 7.5), 10-20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, and 10% isopropyl alcohol) were equilibrated against a 1-ml reservoir of precipitant buffer. Crystals of the AKR1D1·NADP+ complex were soaked for 1 week in the same mother liquor solution augmented with 5.0 mm 5β-cholestan-3-one, a steroid product containing a cis-A/B-ring fusion. Following transfer to a cryoprotectant solution containing 28% glycerol, crystals of the AKR1D1·NADP+ complex yielded diffraction data to 1.80-Å resolution at the Advanced Photon Source (beamline 22 BM, λ = 1.000 Å, 100 K) and were isomorphous with crystals of the ternary complexes discussed above (Table 1). The structure of the AKR1D1·NADP+·testosterone complex was solved by molecular replacement using one monomer of the AKR1C2·NADP+·testosterone complex (Protein Data Bank code 1J96) (27Nahoum V.

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar). Additional solvent molecules were introduced during refinement with SHELX, and the electron density map of testosterone became very clearly defined. In the final stage of refinement, the atomic coordinates of testosterone were retrieved from entry TESTOM in the Cambridge Structural Database (41Allen F.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Resulting diameter estimates of the Late Eocene and Cretaceous/Paleogene projectiles are within 50% of independent estimates derived from iridium data, assuming total vaporization and dissolution of osmium in seawater. The variations of 187 Os/ 188 Os and Os/Ir across the Late Eocene impact-event horizon support the main assumptions required to estimate the projectile diameter. Chondritic impacts as small as 2 kilometers in diameter should produce observable excursions in the marine osmium isotope record, suggesting that previously unrecognized impact events can be identified by this method."
https://openalex.org/W2101797210,"The destiny and activity of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) in the nucleus are regulated by modification with ubiquitin, small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO), or phosphorus. ERK-dependent phosphorylation causes an increase in their transcriptional activity, whereas SUMO modification halts it. We hypothesized a causal linkage between phosphorylation and sumoylation because their sites are very closely located in SREBP-1 and -2 molecules. When Ser(455), a phosphorylation site in SREBP-2, was substituted with Ala, this SREBP-2 mutant was more efficiently modified by SUMO-1. On the other hand, substitution of Asp inhibited SUMO conjugation, mimicking phosphoserine. When cells were cultured with insulin-like growth factor-1, sumoylation of SREBP-2 was decreased with an increase in its phosphorylation, but SREBP-2(S455A) was continuously sumoylated. An ERK cascade inhibitor, U0126, inversely augmented SUMO modification of SREBP-2. Insulin-like growth factor-1 treatment stimulated the expression of SREBP target genes such as the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, squalene synthase, and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase genes. These results indicate that growth factor-induced phosphorylation of SREBP-2 inhibits sumoylation, thereby facilitating SREBP transcriptional activity. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays revealed that wild-type SREBP-2, but not a mutant lacking Lys(464), interacts with HDAC3 preferentially among the histone deacetylase family members. HDAC3 small interfering RNA induced gene expression of the LDL receptor and thereby augmented fluorescently labeled LDL uptake in HepG2 cells. In summary, growth factors inhibit sumoylation of SREBPs through their phosphorylation, thus avoiding the recruitment of an HDAC3 corepressor complex and stimulating the lipid uptake and synthesis required for cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2067807852,"ASAP3, an Arf GTPase-activating protein previously called DDEFL1 and ACAP4, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma. We have examined in vitro and in vivo functions of ASAP3 and compared it to the related Arf GAP ASAP1 that has also been implicated in oncogenesis. ASAP3 was biochemically similar to ASAP1: the pleckstrin homology domain affected function of the catalytic domain by more than 100-fold; catalysis was stimulated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; and Arf1, Arf5, and Arf6 were used as substrates in vitro. Like ASAP1, ASAP3 associated with focal adhesions and circular dorsal ruffles. Different than ASAP1, ASAP3 did not localize to invadopodia or podosomes. Cells, derived from a mammary carcinoma and from a glioblastoma, with reduced ASAP3 expression had fewer actin stress fiber, reduced levels of phosphomyosin, and migrated more slowly than control cells. Reducing ASAP3 expression also slowed invasion of mammary carcinoma cells. In contrast, reduction of ASAP1 expression had no effect on migration or invasion. We propose that ASAP3 functions nonredundantly with ASAP1 to control cell movement and may have a role in cancer cell invasion. In comparing ASAP1 and ASAP3, we also found that invadopodia are dispensable for the invasive behavior of cells derived from a mammary carcinoma.

At least part of the molecular mechanism by which the different Arf GAPs affect actin involves the catalytic GTPase-activating protein activity. For instance, the Arf6-GAP activity of ARAP2 is required for formation of FAs (19Yoon H.-Y. Miura K. Cuthbert E.J. Davis K.K. Ahvazi B. Casanova J.E. Randazzo P.A. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4650-4666Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, the multidomain Arf GAPs have additional functions. ASAP1 is an example of an Arf GAP that functions as a GTPase-activating protein and as a scaffold to regulate FAs and invadopodia (9Sabe H. Onodera Y. Mazaki Y. Hashimoto S. Curr. Opin.

Three ASAP-type proteins have been identified so far. ASAP1 and ASAP2, but not ASAP3, contain an SH3 domain at the extreme C terminus (35Brown M.T. Andrade J. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G.

ASAP3, previously called up-regulated in liver cancer 1 (UPLC1), DDEFL1 and ACAP4 (42Fang Z.Y. Miao Y. Ding X. Deng H. Liu S.Q. Wang F.S. Zhou R.H. Watson C. Fu C.H. Hu Q.C. Lillard J.W. Powell M.

Nakamura Y. Int. J. Oncol. 2004; 24: 43-48PubMed Google Scholar), was identified in analyses of expression profiles of clinical hepatocellular carcinomas using cDNA microarray. The relative expression of ASAP3 was high in hepatocellular carcinoma (43Okabe H. Furukawa Y. Kato T. Hasegawa S. Yamaoka Y. Nakamura Y. Int. J. Oncol. 2004; 24: 43-48PubMed Google Scholar). The expression level of ASAP3 correlated with cell proliferation and migration (42Fang Z.Y. Miao Y. Ding X. Deng H. Liu S.Q. Wang F.S. Zhou R.H. Watson C. Fu C.H. Hu Q.C. Lillard J.W. Powell M.

However, the localization of endogenous protein and the precise site of action have not been examined. Here we characterize ASAP3 and test the hypothesis that ASAP3 and ASAP1, with highly similar structures, have redundant cellular functions in controlling cell migration and invasion. Biochemically, ASAP3 is similar to ASAP1; however, examination of the cellular function of ASAP3 revealed differences from ASAP1. First, ASAP3 localized in FAs and CDRs but, different from ASAP1, ASAP3 was not found in invadopodia or podosomes, structures reported to mediate invasion of cancer cells. Second, reduction of ASAP3 expression did not prevent the formation of invadopodia or podosomes; in contrast, reduction of ASAP1 blocked the formation of invadopodia and podosomes (34Onodera Y. Hashimoto S. Hashimoto A. Morishige M. Yamada A. Ogawa E. Adachi M. Sakurai T. Manabe T. Wada H. Matsuura N. Sabe H. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 38Bharti S.

Decreasing the expression level of ASAP3 reduced actin stress fibers. Third, reduction of ASAP3 expression levels slowed cell migration and invasion, whereas reduction of ASAP1 expression did not affect these activities. Based on our results, we conclude that ASAP3 and ASAP1 do not function redundantly but have distinct functions. At least for the mammary carcinoma cell line we examined, ASAP3 contributes to invasion but ASAP1 does not. Given the critical role of ASAP1 for invadopodia formation (38Bharti S. Inoue H. Bharti K. Hirsch D.S. Nie Z. Yoon H.Y. Artym V. Yamada K.M. Mueller S.C. Barr V.A. Randazzo P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 8271-8283Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), these results also support the conclusion that invadopodia are dispensable for invasion. Plasmids—Epitope-tagged (FLAG tag, hemagglutinin tag) of full-length ASAP3 (accession number NM_017707) and the GAP-deficient mutant ([R469K]ASAP3 and [R469A]ASAP3) were constructed in the mammalian expression vector pCI (Promega) with standard molecular biology procedures. Antibodies—Rabbit antiserum against human ASAP3 was raised using a synthetic peptide WVISTEPGSDSEEDEEEKRC, residues 692–711 of ASAP3, conjugated to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce) as an immunogen. Immunization was performed at BioWorld (Dublin, OH). The antiserum (Bio228) was affinity purified using an EZ-link kit from Pierce and used for this article (see supplemental materials and Fig. S1 for characterization). The other antibodies used in this study were as follows: mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody M5 (Sigma; 1:1,000), rabbit anti-phosphomyosin light chain 2 (Ser19), phospho-MLC2, (Cell Signaling, 1:1000), rabbit anti-myosin light chain 2 (MLC2) (Cell Signaling, 1:1000), rabbit polyclonal anti-hemagglutinin (Covance, 1:1,000), goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad, 1:3,000), goat anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad, 1:3,000), Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:200), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:200). siRNA Preparation and Transfection—For RNA interference assays, 19-nucleotide small interfering RNA duplexes (siRNAs) with 3′-UU overhangs specific for the 3′-untranslated region (5′-3′) and the open reading frame (“Smart pool,” combination of 4 siRNA duplexes) for human ASAP3/DDEFL1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_017707) were synthesized by Dharmacon (Chicago, IL). The sequences were as follows: siRNA-1 sense, UCAGAUACCACACGAGUAAUU; siRNA-1 anti, UUACUCGUGUGGUAUCUGAUU; siRNA-2 sense, UAUAUGACCAUUACAGUUGUU; siRNA-2 anti, CAACUGUAAUGGUCAUAUAUU; siRNA-3 sense, GAAAGAAGGGAGAGUAAUAUU; siRNA-3 anti, UAUUACUCUCCCUUCUUUCUU; siRNA-4 sense, UCACUAAAUUCCAACUCUAUU; and siRNA-4 anti, UAGAGUUGGAAUUUAGUGAUU. The siRNA duplexes used to target human ASAP1 (GenBank accession number NM_081482) specific for the open reading frame were synthesized by Invitrogen. The sequences were as follows: HSS147202, 5′-CCCAAAUUGGAGAUUUGCCGCCUAA-3′; HSS147203, 5′-GACCAGAUCUCUGUCUCGGAGUUCA-3′; and HSS147204, 5′-GGGCAAUAAGGAAUAUGGCAGUGAA-3′. The pool and individual siRNAs suppressed the expression of endogenous ASAP1 or ASAP3 efficiently (<80% knockdown assessed by Western blot analysis). Silencer negative control number 2 siRNA (catalog D-001810-02-20) was purchased from Dharmacon. Cells were transfected with 100 nm siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) transfection reagent according to the manufacturerŉs recommendations. The cells were harvested 48–96 h later and analyzed by Western blots and immunofluorescence. Cell Culture and Cell Transfection—Human cell lines HepG2, U118, and MDA-MB-231 and mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at constant humidity. Protein Expression and Purification from Bacteria—To express different constructs of ASAP3, reading frames for proteins of residues 287–693 (PZA), 1–693 (BAR-PZA), 417–903 (ZA-proline rich), 293–903 (ΔBAR ASAP3), and 1–903 (full-length ASAP3) of ASAP3 were ligated into the NdeI/XhoI sites of pET19b (Novagen), which contains a His10 fusion at the N terminus to express histidine-tagged proteins. Recombinant proteins were expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli over a HiTrap Q anion-exchange column (GE Healthcare) followed by a nickel affinity column (GE Healthcare) using gradients of NaCl and imidazole. Experiments were performed with the histidine-tagged proteins. Non-myristoylated Arfs were prepared as described (44Randazzo P.A. Weiss O. Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence—Cultured cells were seeded on fibronectin-coated coverslips for at least 4 h and fixed in 2% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min at room temperature, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and once in 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.04% sodium azide in PBS. Cells were then permeabilized in buffer A (10% fetal bovine serum, 0.04% sodium azide, and 0.2% saponin in PBS) for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies at 1:100 dilution in buffer A for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h at room temperature. For visualization of actin filaments, rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) was added during the incubation with secondary antibodies. Coverslips were then washed and mounted on glass slides with Gel Mount (Biomeda). Cells were visualized and images captured by confocal microscopy using a Zeiss LSM 510 attached to a Zeiss Axiovert 100M with a 63 × 1.4 NA plan Neofluar oil immersion lens. Adobe Illustrator was used to prepare the images for publication. Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysates containing equivalents of total protein were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were incubated in 4% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature, washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, followed by incubation with the primary antibody (as specified) for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were then washed and incubated in the appropriate secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature, and the immunocomplexes were visualized using ECL Plus Western blotting Detection System (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Proliferation Assay—Cells treated with siRNA targeting ASAP3 or cells stably expressing ASAP3 or [R469K]ASAP3 were plated at a density of 20,000 cells per well in 12-well plates in 1 ml of culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Proliferation was monitored by counting cells each day using a hemocytometer. The experiments were repeated twice in triplicates each. MTT Assay—Cells previously treated with the indicated siRNA were plated at a density of 3,000 cells per well in 96-well plates (200 μl/well) and incubated at 37 °C. MTT assay was performed every 24 h by adding 20 μl of MTT (5 mg/ml) 4 h before cell harvesting. The resulting MTT purple formazan crystals in each well were solubilized by addition of 100 μl of DMSO and absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 650 nm. Wound Healing Assay—Monolayers of confluent cells were scratched with a sterile pipette tip and phase-contrast images of cells were taken either immediately after wounding or after 24 or 48 h. Repair of the artificial “wound” (% healing) was quantified as follows: healing (%) = ((1 – (width of wound at 0 h/width of wound at 24 or 48 h)) × 100. Transwell Migration and Invasion Assay—Migration and invasion assays were carried out with cell culture inserts (8-μm pore size; BD Biosciences). For invasion assays, cell culture inserts were coated with 10 μg of Matrigel (BD Biosciences). The Matrigel was diluted in cold serum-free medium and added to the chambers and dried in a sterile hood for 4–5 h. The Matrigel was then reconstituted with serum-free medium for 1 h at 37°C before the addition of cells. Cells were harvested by trypsinization, resuspended in Opti-MEM and 1 × 104 cells were added to the upper chambers, and the chambers were placed in 24-well dishes. The lower compartment of the wells were filled with Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum used as chemoattractant. Migration assays were carried out for 12 h and invasion assays for 24 h. Cells were scraped off the top side of the polyethylene membrane with a cotton swab. Cells that invaded into the Matrigel and migrated out onto the lower surface of the membrane were stained in 0.2% crystal violet. Images of the cells that invaded the lower surface of the filter were taken with the ×2.5 objective of an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse E800) coupled to a digital camera (Hamamatsu C4742-95). Data were collected from at least three independent experiments each carried out in triplicate. Data are presented as percentages calculated by normalizing the values obtained for the cells treated with a negative control siRNA as 100%. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutations were performed using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturerŉs instructions and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mutant proteins were purified as described above. Arf GAP Assay—Arf GAP activity was determined using an in vitro assay that measures a single round of GTP hydrolysis on recombinant Arf (45Randazzo P.A. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10758-10763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Luo R. Ahvazi B. Amariei D. Shroder D. Burrola B. Losert W. Randazzo P.A. Biochem. J. 2007; 402: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, recombinant Arf proteins were preloaded with [α-32P]GTP for 30 min at 37 °C. Purified ASAP3 proteins were added to GTP-loaded Arfs in the presence of large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs). Reactions were terminated after 3 min by adding ice-cold buffer. Protein-bound nucleotide was trapped on nitrocellulose filters, released into formic acid, fractionated by chromatography on polyethyleneimide cellulose plates, and quantified using a Phosphor-Imager (GE Healthcare). All experiments were performed at least three times with similar results. Preparation of Large Unilamellar Vesicles—Synthetic LUVs consisting of 40% phosphatidylcholine, 25% phosphatidylethanolamine, 15% phosphatidylserine, 9.5% phosphatidylinositol (PI), 0.5% phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), and 10% cholesterol from liver or brain total lipid extracts (Avanti Polar Lipids) were obtained as follows. Lipids were dried under N2 for >1 h and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline for Arf GAP assa"
https://openalex.org/W2081201184,"The recent release of draft genome sequences of two of the major human schistosomes has underscored the pressing need to develop functional genomics approaches for these significant pathogens. The sequence information also makes feasible genome-scale investigation of transgene integration into schistosome chromosomes. Retrovirus-mediated transduction offers a means to establish transgenic lines of schistosomes, to elucidate schistosome gene function and expression, and to advance functional genomics approaches for these parasites. We investigated the utility of the Moloney murine leukemia retrovirus (MLV) pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) for the transduction of Schistosoma mansoni and delivery of reporter transgenes into schistosome chromosomes. Schistosomula were exposed to virions of VSVG-pseudotyped MLV, after which genomic DNA was extracted from the transduced schistosomes. Southern hybridization analysis indicated the presence of proviral MLV retrovirus in the transduced schistosomes. Fragments of the MLV transgene and flanking schistosome sequences recovered using an anchored PCR-based approach demonstrated definitively that somatic transgenesis of schistosome chromosomes had taken place and, moreover, revealed widespread retrovirus integration into schistosome chromosomes. More specifically, MLV transgenes had inserted in the vicinity of genes encoding immunophilin, zinc finger protein Sma-Zic, and others, as well as near the endogenous schistosome retrotransposons, the fugitive and SR1. Proviral integration of the MLV transgene appeared to exhibit primary sequence site specificity, targeting a gGATcc-like motif. Reporter luciferase transgene activity driven by the schistosome actin gene promoter was expressed in the tissues of transduced schistosomula and adult schistosomes. Luciferase activity appeared to be developmentally expressed in schistosomula with increased activity observed after 1 to 2 wk in culture. These findings indicate the utility of VSVG-pseudotyped MLV for transgenesis of S. mansoni, herald a tractable pathway forward toward germline transgenesis and functional genomics of parasitic helminths, and provide the basis for comparative molecular pathogenesis studies of chromosomal lesions arising from retroviral integration into human compared with schistosome chromosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2082485257,"The yeast SM22 homologue Scp1 has previously been shown to act as an actin-bundling protein in vitro. In cells, Scp1 localizes to the cortical actin patches that form as part of the invagination process during endocytosis, and its function overlaps with that of the well characterized yeast fimbrin homologue Sac6p. In this work we have used live cell imaging to demonstrate the importance of key residues in the Scp1 actin interface. We have defined two actin binding domains within Scp1 that allow the protein to both bind and bundle actin without the need for dimerization. Green fluorescent protein-tagged mutants of Scp1 also indicate that actin localization does not require the putative phosphorylation site Ser-185 to be functional. Deletion of SCP1 has few discernable effects on cell growth and morphology. However, we reveal that scp1 deletion is compensated for by up-regulation of Sac6. Furthermore, Scp1 levels are increased in the absence of sac6. The presence of compensatory pathways to up-regulate Sac6 or Scp1 levels in the absence of the other suggest that maintenance of sufficient bundling activity is critical within the cell. Analysis of cortical patch assembly and movement during endocytosis reveals a previously undetected role for Scp1 in movement of patches away from the plasma membrane. Additionally, we observe a dramatic increase in patch lifetime in a strain lacking both sac6 and scp1, demonstrating the central role played by actin-bundling proteins in the endocytic process."

https://openalex.org/W1976684340,"The pathogenesis of Huntington disease (HD) is attributed to the misfolding of huntingtin (htt) caused by an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) domain. Considerable effort has been devoted to identifying molecules that can prevent or reduce htt misfolding and the associated neuropathology. Although overexpression of chaperones is known to reduce htt cytotoxicity in cellular models, only modest protection is seen with Hsp70 overexpression in HD mouse models. Because the activity of Hsp70 is modulated by co-chaperones, an interesting issue is whether the in vivo effects of chaperones on polyQ protein toxicity are dependent on other modulators. In the present study, we focused on BAG1, a co-chaperone that interacts with Hsp70 and regulates its activity. Of htt mice expressing the N171-82Q mutant, we found that male N171-82Q mice show a greater deficit in rotarod performance than female N171-82Q mice. This sex-dependent motor deficit was improved by crossing N171-82Q mice with transgenic mice overexpressing BAG1 in neurons. Transgenic BAG1 also reduces the levels of mutant htt in synaptosomal fraction of male HD mice. Overexpression of BAG1 augmented the effects of Hsp70 by reducing aggregation of mutant htt in cultured cells and improving neurite outgrowth in htt-transfected PC12 cells. These findings suggest that the effects of chaperones on HD pathology are influenced by both their modulators and sex-dependent factors.

Huntington disease (HD) 2The abbreviations used are: HD, Huntington disease; polyQ, polyglutamine; htt, huntingtin; siRNA, small interference RNA; DbTg, double transgenic. is an inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by a polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansion near the N terminus of the protein huntingtin (htt) (HD collaborative research group (49HD Collaborative Research GroupCell. 1993; 26: 971-983Google Scholar). Patients with HD suffer an array of cognitive, psychiatric, and motor disorders before death, which typically occurs 10-20 years after onset of symptoms. Pathological hallmarks of this disease include selective neuronal loss and htt inclusions or aggregates that are formed in neuronal nuclei and processes (1DiFiglia M. Sapp E. Chase K.O. Davies S.W. Bates G.P. Vonsattel J.P. Aronin N. Science. 1997; 277: 1990-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (2331) Google Scholar, 2Gutekunst C.A. Li S.H. Yi H. Mulroy J.S. Kuemmerle S. Jones R. Rye D. Ferrante R.J. Hersch S.M. Li X.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2522-2534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several genetic mouse models of HD have been developed, and they recapitulate various aspects of the disease observed in patients, including age-dependent inclusion formation and behavioral abnormalities (3Rubinsztein D.C. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 202-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Of these mouse models, the transgenic N171-82Q model, which was generated by using the mouse prion promoter to drive neuronal expression of N-terminal mutant htt, exhibits progressive inclusion formation, motor deficits, weight loss, and shortened life-span (4Schilling G. Becher M.W. Sharp A.H. Jinnah H.A. Duan K. Kotzuk J.A. Slunt H.H. Ratovitski T. Cooper J.K. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Price D.L. Ross C.A. Borchelt D.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 397-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The well characterized phenotypes of HD transgenic mice have proven valuable for evaluating potential therapeutics. Misfolding of mutant htt is thought to contribute to abnormal protein-protein interactions, inclusion formation, and neuronal death. Currently, no treatment exists for those afflicted with HD, although considerable attention has been given to molecules that might alleviate the burden of misfolded htt. The major cytosolic chaperones of the Hsp40 and Hsp70 families act in concert to recognize misfolded proteins and refold them. Hsp70 family members interact with mutant N-terminal htt fragments and localize to inclusions in cellular and mouse models of HD (5Jana N.R. Tanaka M. Wang G. Nukina N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2009-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Although Hsp70 can effectively reduce polyQ-mediated cytotoxicity in cultured cells, its effect in HD mouse models is modest or not significant (6Hansson O. Nylandsted J. Castilho R.F. Leist M. Jaattela M. Brundin P. Brain Res. 2003; 970: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 7Hay D.G. Sathasivam K. Tobaben S. Stahl B. Marber M. Mestril R. Mahal A. Smith D.L. Woodman B. Bates G.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1389-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The modest benefits of overexpression of Hsp70 in HD mouse models indicate that Hsp70 alone is insufficient to revert HD pathology and that other modulators are likely required for its action. The activity of Hsp70 is regulated by its co-chaperones. BAG1 is an Hsp70 co-chaperone that interacts directly with both Hsp70 and the proteasome. Therefore, BAG1 acts as a unique link between the two primary systems for handling misfolded proteins (8Alberti S. Esser C. Hohfeld J. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2003; 8: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The direct interaction between BAG1 and Hsp70 leads to an increase in Hsp70 chaperone activity in neuronal cell lines (9Liman J. Ganesan S. Dohm C.P. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Bahr M. Wouters F.S. Kermer P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3715-3725Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Consequently, mice overexpressing BAG1 in neurons display significant neuroprotection in an in vivo stroke model and in an in vitro excitotoxicity model (10Kermer P. Digicaylioglu M.H. Kaul M. Zapata J.M. Krajewska M. Stenner-Liewen F. Takayama S. Krajewski S. Lipton S.A. Reed J.C. Brain Pathol. 2003; 13: 495-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In cellular and mouse models of HD, BAG1 interacts with N-terminal htt fragments and localizes to htt inclusions (11Jana N.R. Nukina N. Neurosci. Lett. 2005; 378: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These findings suggest BAG1 is a strong candidate to assist the effect of Hsp70 on the toxicity caused by mutant htt. However, the in vivo role of BAG1 on HD pathology remains unknown. To test the effect BAG1 on HD mice, we crossed BAG1 transgenic mice with N171-82Q mice and evaluated levels of soluble and aggregated htt and various chaperones. Although several phenotypic parameters in N171-82Q mice remained unchanged in the presence of transgenic BAG1, we identified a gender-specific improvement in motor deficits in N171-82Q mice. The protective benefit of BAG1 on motor dysfunction of HD mice fits with the previously reported phenomenon of an increased Hsp70 response in male animals (12Paroo Z. Haist J.V. Karmazyn M. Noble E.G. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 13Thorp D.B. Haist J.V. Leppard J. Milne K.J. Karmazyn M. Noble E.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 293: R363-R371Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and with observations that male HD mice show more severe behavioral phenotypes than female HD mice (14Van Raamsdonk J.M. Pearson J. Rogers D.A. Bissada N. Vogl A.W. Hayden M.R. Leavitt B.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 1379-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 15Dorner J.L. Miller B.R. Barton S.J. Brock T.J. Rebec G.V. Behav. Brain Res. 2007; 178: 90-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that HD pathology is influenced by sex-dependent factors and chaperone function. Thus, evaluation of effects of chaperones or experimental therapeutics on HD pathology should consider these factors. Animals—Mice expressing a 171-amino acid N-terminal fragment htt containing an 82 polyQ stretch under the mouse prion promoter (4Schilling G. Becher M.W. Sharp A.H. Jinnah H.A. Duan K. Kotzuk J.A. Slunt H.H. Ratovitski T. Cooper J.K. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Price D.L. Ross C.A. Borchelt D.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 397-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained on a hybrid (B6CBA) background. To generate N171-82Q mice overexpressing BAG1 in neurons, male N171-82Q mice were mated to female FVB mice expressing the p29 isoform of mouse BAG1 with a FLAG tag under the control of the neuron-specific enolase promoter (10Kermer P. Digicaylioglu M.H. Kaul M. Zapata J.M. Krajewska M. Stenner-Liewen F. Takayama S. Krajewski S. Lipton S.A. Reed J.C. Brain Pathol. 2003; 13: 495-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Three separate groups of F1 littermates resulting from these crosses were used for all experiments described below. Genotyping was carried out according to published protocols (4Schilling G. Becher M.W. Sharp A.H. Jinnah H.A. Duan K. Kotzuk J.A. Slunt H.H. Ratovitski T. Cooper J.K. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Price D.L. Ross C.A. Borchelt D.R. Hum. Mol.

Brain Pathol. 2003; 13: 495-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). All mice were bred and maintained in an animal facility at Emory University in accordance with institutional guidelines. Antibodies—Mouse (mEM48), rabbit (rEM48), and guinea pig (EM73) antibodies to htt were generated in our previous studies (16Zhou H. Cao F. Wang Z. Yu Z.X. Nguyen H.P. Evans J. Li S.H. Li X.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 17Rong J. McGuire J.R. Fang Z.H. Sheng G. Shin J.Y. Li S.H. Li X.J. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6019-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Commercially available antibodies included Hsp90 and Hsp60 (Stressgen); BAG1, Hsp70, and Hsp40 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); α-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich); and synaptophysin (Roche Applied Science). Immunoblotting—To quantify protein expression levels of mutant htt and chaperones in mouse forebrain tissue (aged three or five months) or transfected cells, soluble lysates were normalized for total protein content and analyzed by immunoblotting, according to standard procedures. Blots were initially probed for htt and then reprobed for chaperones or the loading control synaptophysin. Relative protein expression levels were determined using ImageQuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics) with synaptophysin levels used as the reference for each sample. Immunohistochemistry—Histochemical labeling of mutant htt in perfusion-fixed mouse brain sections (aged 4 months) with EM48 was performed as previously described (18Li S.H. Yu Z.X. Li C.L. Nguyen H.P. Zhou Y.X. Deng C. Li X.J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6956-6964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rotarod Test—Motor performance was evaluated using an AccuRotor rotarod apparatus (Accuscan Instruments). During the week prior to testing, mice were trained on two consecutive days for two 5-min trials at 5 rpm. Testing began at 15 weeks of age and continued twice weekly for up to 10 weeks. Because of the shortened lifespan of mice expressing mutant htt, we analyzed data collected between 15 and 22 weeks for statistical differences. During testing, the rotating rod was set to accelerate from 0 to 40 rpm at a rate of 0.1 rpm/s. Each mouse performed three trials on each testing day with 5-min resting periods between each trial. The time to fall from the rotating rod was measured and averaged for the three trials. A maximum score of 400 s was recorded for mice that remained on the rod for the duration of the trial. Limb Clasping—N171-82Q mice exhibit a limb clasping phenotype when suspended from their tails (4Schilling G. Becher M.W. Sharp A.H. Jinnah H.A. Duan K. Kotzuk J.A. Slunt H.H. Ratovitski T. Cooper J.K. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Price D.L. Ross C.A. Borchelt D.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 397-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test the effect of BAG1 overexpression on this phenotype, two parameters were quantified: age of initial onset of the clasping phenotype and the duration to clasping at 145 days of age. Mice were monitored for onset at least twice weekly by suspending from the tail for up to 3 min. Positive onset was noted as the first day during which a mouse sustained clasping of the forelimbs or hind limbs for longer than 3 s. At 145 days of age, all mice expressing mutant htt were positive for the clasping phenotype. At this age, all mice were suspended from their tails for up to 3 min, and the time elapsed before the start of sustained limb clasping was recorded. Body Weight—Mice were weighed twice weekly starting at 7 weeks of age. Percent change in weight was calculated from the starting baseline. Survival—Significant decreases in weight and/or rotarod performance were indicators of end stage disease in both N171-82Q and DbTg mice. End stage mice were monitored daily and euthanized when necessary. Survival curves and average age of death were used to evaluate the effect of BAG1 overexpression on N171-82Q mouse survival. Expression of htt and Chaperones in PC12 Cells—Transfection of PC12 cells was performed as described previously (17Rong J. McGuire J.R. Fang Z.H. Sheng G. Shin J.Y. Li S.H. Li X.J. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6019-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To assess the protective effects of chaperones on neurite out-growth of PC12 cells, BAG1 (pcDNA3 vector) and Hsp70 (pRK vector) (16Zhou H. Cao F. Wang Z. Yu Z.X. Nguyen H.P. Evans J. Li S.H. Li X.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) were co-expressed with N208-htt containing 120Q. After transfection for 5 h, the cells were treated with nerve growth factor (100 ng/ml) for 40 h. For single transfection of htt, anti-tubulin was used to visualize neurites. For co-transfected cells, mouse (mEM48) or guinea pig (EM73) antibodies to htt and antibodies to BAG1 and Hsp70 were used for immunofluorescent staining. The percentage of transfected cells (71-232 cells each group in three transfection experiments) containing neurites longer than two cell bodies was counted. Knockdown of BAG1—Plasmids encoding BAG1 siRNA (siBAG1A and siBAG1C) (25Zhou R. Gray N.A. Yuan P. Li X. Chen J. Chen G. Damschroder-Williams P. Du J. Zhang L. Manji H.K. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4493-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) were co-transfected with N208-htt containing 120Q into HEK 293 cells. After 72 h, cells were fixed and immunostained with mEM48 to examine the aggregation of mutant htt. Whole cell lysates were also immunoblotted according to standard procedures to examine the expression of BAG1 and the accumulation and aggregation of mutant htt. Synaptosomal Fractionation—Synaptosomal fractions were prepared from brains of 3- to 4-month-old mice following a previously described method (19Phillips G.R. Huang J.K. Wang Y. Tanaka H. Shapiro L. Zhang W. Shan W.S. Arndt K. Frank M. Gordon R.E. Gawinowicz M.A. Zhao Y. Colman D.R. Neuron. 2001; 32: 63-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) with minor changes. The protocol was scaled down to allow isolation of synaptosomes from individual mouse brains. After ultracentrifugation, isolated synaptosomes were rinsed twice with homogenization buffer prior to immunoblotting. Statistics—Student's t test, and repeated measure and factorial analysis of variance with Tukey post-test were used to determine statistical significance between groups. p < 0.05 was considered significant in all cases. Expression of Chaperones in N171-82Q Mice—As transgenic expression of the Hsp70 co-chaperone BAG1 can protect against stroke (10Kermer P. Digicaylioglu M.H. Kaul M. Zapata J.M. Krajewska M. Stenner-Liewen F. Takayama S. Krajewski S. Lipton S.A. Reed J.C. Brain Pathol. 2003; 13: 495-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of BAG1 on HD pathogenesis by crossing the BAG1 transgenic mice with N171-82Q mice, which express N-terminal mutant htt (171 amino acids) containing an 82-glutamine repeat (4Schilling G. Becher M.W. Sharp A.H. Jinnah H.A. Duan K. Kotzuk J.A. Slunt H.H. Ratovitski T. Cooper J.K. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Price D.L. Ross C.A. Borchelt D.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 397-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using immunoblot analysis of brain cortical lysates from mice at 5 months of age, we first verified the expression of transgenic BAG1 in double transgenic mice (DbTg) that also expressed transgenic htt (Fig. 1A). Mutant htt was present as both soluble and aggregated forms, with the latter remaining in the stacking gel (inner bracket). Overexpression of BAG1 did not appear to alter the levels of these two forms of mutant htt. Hsp70 levels were decreased in N171-82Q mice, confirming previous reports of reduced Hsp70 expression in HD mouse models (6Hansson O. Nylandsted J. Castilho R.F. Leist M. Jaattela M. Brundin P. Brain Res. 2003; 970: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 7Hay D.G. Sathasivam K. Tobaben S. Stahl B. Marber M. Mestril R. Mahal A. Smith D.L. Woodman B. Bates G.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1389-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 20Vacher C. Garcia-Oroz L. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 3425-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, transgenic BAG1 was unable to reverse this deficit. Next, we examined the expression of other chaperones (Hsp90 and Hsp60) (Fig. 1A) and quantified the relative amounts of aggregated or soluble htt and chaperones by measuring their ratios relative to the synaptic protein synaptophysin (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, Hsp90 levels were increased in the N171-82Q brain compared with WT mouse brain, and BAG1 overexpression seemed to prevent this increase in Hsp90 in DbTg animals. No difference in Hsp60 levels was seen between any of the groups tested. These results suggest that HD transgenic mice have selective alterations in their chaperone protein levels or activities. htt Aggregates—Chaperones are important for preventing protein misfolding and aggregation. In HD mouse brains, mutant htt forms aggregates in neuronal nuclei and neuropil (4Schilling G. Becher M.W. Sharp A.H. Jinnah H.A. Duan K. Kotzuk J.A. Slunt H.H. Ratovitski T. Cooper J.K. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Price D.L. Ross C.A. Borchelt D.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 397-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Li S.H. Li X.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 777-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 22Li S.H. Li H. Torre E.R. Li X.J. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2000; 16: 168-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To evaluate the effect of transgenic BAG1 on aggregate formation in vivo, we performed EM48 immunostaining on 4-month-old N171-82Q and DbTg mouse brains (Fig. 2). High magnification images revealed that the size and density of nuclear htt inclusions were similar in N171-82Q and DbTg mouse striatum and cortex. Neuropil aggregates, which are much smaller than nuclear inclusions and located outside of cell bodies, did not appear to be significantly changed in DbTg mouse brains as compared with N171-82Q mouse brains. Thus, using immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2) and Western blotting of whole cell lysates (Fig. 1), we were unable to find significant changes of aggregated htt in the presence of transgenic BAG1. Neurological Symptoms—N171-82Q mice display significant neurological symptoms, including limb clasping, motor deficits, body weight loss, and early death at the age of 5-6 months. These mice failed to gain weight after 12 weeks of age and weighed significantly less than wild-type littermates by 20 weeks of age (Fig. 3A). BAG1 transgenic mice increased in weight at the same rate as wild-type mice. However, no significant difference was observed in weight between N171-82Q and DbTg mice at any age (Fig. 3A). N171-82Q mice showed an increased mortality compared with both wild-type and BAG1 mice (Fig. 3B), but transgenic BAG1 was unable to prolong the survival of DbTg mice or to delay the age at death (Fig. 3, B and C). Thus, like transgenic Hsp70 (6Hansson O. Nylandsted J. Castilho R.F. Leist M. Jaattela M. Brundin P. Brain Res. 2003; 970: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 7Hay D.G. Sathasivam K. Tobaben S. Stahl B. Marber M. Mestril R. Mahal A. Smith D.L. Woodman B. Bates G.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1389-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), transgenic BAG1 is unable to influence the age of onset of symptoms, body weight loss, and early death of HD transgenic mice. In addition, neither age of onset nor duration to onset of the hind limb clasping phenotype was significantly different between N171-82Q and DbTg mice (Fig. 3, D and E). We then focused on the motor function of N171-82Q mice, which is more likely to reflect neuronal dysfunction in HD. We observed a significant gender-dependent deficit in rotarod performance in N171-82Q mice. Although male wild-type or BAG transgenic mice showed slightly better performance than female littermates of the same genotype (Fig. 4, A and B), male N171-82Q mice performed significantly worse than female N171-82Q mice at all ages examined (Fig. 4C). In DbTg mice expressing both BAG1 and mutant htt, both males and females performed equally well on the rotarod test (Fig. 4D). To verify that the sex-dependent difference on rotarod performance is dependent on the expression of transgenic BAG1, we compared the rotarod performance among N171-82Q and DbTg mice. Interestingly, male DbTg mice performed significantly better than male N171-82Q mice (Fig. 4E), whereas no significant difference was observed in rotarod performance between female N171-82Q and DbTg mice (Fig. 4F). Gender-related Expression of Hsp70—The above findings suggest that the motor deficit of N171-82Q mice is influenced by gender and that this gender-related deficit can be reversed or delayed by transgenic BAG1. These findings led us to examine more closely whether gender-dependent differences in expression of htt and Hsp70 occur in brain. Consistent with the results in Fig. 1, transgenic HD mouse brains displayed a decrease in Hsp70 expression (Fig. 5A). We did not find any significant difference in the expression of endogenous and transgenic BAG1 between male and female mice (supplemental Fig. S2). Analysis of whole cell lysates did not reveal a significant effect of BAG1 on the levels of mutant htt (Fig. 5A). As mutant htt accumulates in nerve terminals to form aggregates and to affect synaptic function in HD mice, we isolated synaptosomal fractions to examine the expression of mutant htt and Hsp70, an assay that would be more quantitative than immunohistochemistry to reveal soluble htt. Unlike the whole cell extracts (Fig. 5A), synaptosomal fractions show a clearer doublet of transgenic htt (Fig. 5B). The lower band of this doublet in N171-82Q mouse brain tissue is likely a degraded htt product as reported previously (4Schilling G. Becher M.W. Sharp A.H. Jinnah H.A. Duan K. Kotzuk J.A. Slunt H.H. Ratovitski T. Cooper J.K. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Price D.L. Ross C.A. Borchelt D.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 397-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The increased level of the degraded htt product in synaptosomal fractions could be due to increased synaptic proteolysis or decreased activity of ubiquitin-proteasomal system seen in the synapses of HD mouse brains (23Wang J. Wang C.E. Orr A. Tydlacka S. Li S.H. Li X.J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 1177-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Thus, we chose the intact transgenic htt (the upper band) to assess the expression of transgenic htt in synaptosomal fractions. By quantifying the ratio of this band to the synaptic protein syntaxin, we verified that the relative level of mutant htt in synaptosomes from male transgenic mice is significantly decreased in the presence of transgenic BAG1 (Fig. 5C). Synaptosomal mutant htt from female HD mice was also reduced, although not statistical significantly, when transgenic BAG1 is present. Analysis of Hsp70 expression revealed that Hsp70 is indeed decreased in N171-82Q mouse brain as compared with wild-type mice, and transgenic BAG1 does not seem to significantly revert this decrease. This result suggests that overexpression of BAG1 may increase chaperone activity, rather than its expression, to reduce the accumulation of mutant htt. Interestingly, the levels of Hsp70 in whole cell lysates and synaptosomes appeared to be lower in male HD mice than in female HD mice (Fig. 5C). The gender-related difference in the level of Hsp70 in HD mouse brains could contribute to the sex-dependent effect of mutant htt on motor function of transgenic N171-82Q mice. Accordingly, BAG1 overexpression-induced chaperone activity may be more pronounced in male mice when Hsp70 level or activity is reduced by sex-dependent factors. Synergistic Effect of BAG1 and Hsp70—If cofactors of Hsp70 are important for restoring the activity of Hsp70 when its levels are reduced in vivo, we may see their synergistic effects in vitro. Because BAG1 is both a co-chaperone and regulator of Hsp70 (9Liman J. Ganesan S. Dohm C.P. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Bahr M. Wouters F.S. Kermer P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3715-3725Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we next asked whether BAG1 can promote the protective effects of Hsp70 on mutant htt toxicity in cellular models of HD. We transfected Hsp40 alone or BAG1 with Hsp70 into HEK293 cells expressing an N-terminal fragment of mutant htt similar to the fragment expressed in N171-82Q mice. Confirming previous findings (24Zhou H. Li S.H. Li X.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48417-48424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), overexpression of Hsp40, but not Hsp70, alone inhibited the formation of mutant htt aggregates (Fig. 6A). Immunofluorescence studies suggested that expression of BAG1 alone led to a slight reduction in the size of mutant htt aggregates and that co-expression of BAG1 with Hsp70 appeared to reduce aggregate size and aggregate number further (Fig. 6A). We also used immunoblotting to reveal aggregated proteins that remained in the stacking gel. As expected, Hsp40 overexpression markedly reduced the aggregation of mutant htt, which is reflected by the reduced levels of htt immunoreactive products in the stacking gel and the increased amount of soluble htt in the resolving gel compared with 120Q-htt alone (Fig. 6B). BAG1 transfection reduced htt aggregation. Although Hsp70 transfection alone did not significantly affect htt aggregates as compared with vector transfection, its co-expression with BAG1 also reduced htt aggregates (Fig. 6B). Further, suppressing BAG1 expression via siRNA (25Zhou R. Gray N.A. Yuan P. Li X. Chen J. Chen G. Damschroder-Williams P. Du J. Zhang L. Manji H.K. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4493-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) in HEK293 cells increased the accumulation and aggregation of transfected mutant htt (Fig. 7).FIGURE 7Increased htt aggregation in HEK293 cells treated with BAG1 siRNA.

We dissected the DNA cleavage reaction by measuring rate and equilibrium constants for the individual reaction steps utilizing defined DNA duplexes in the presence and absence of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog 5'-adenylyl-beta,gamma-imidodiphosphate (AMPPNP). Our results revealed the existence of two enzyme conformations whose relative abundance is sensitive to the presence of nucleotides. The predominant species in the absence of nucleotides binds DNA at a diffusion limited rate but cannot efficiently cleave DNA. In the presence of AMPPNP, most of the enzyme is converted to a state in which DNA binding and release is extremely slow but which allows DNA cleavage. A minimal kinetic and thermodynamic framework is established that accounts for the cooperativity of cleavage of the two DNA strands in the presence and absence of bound AMPPNP and includes conformational steps revealed in the kinetic studies. The model unifies available kinetic, thermodynamic, and structural data to provide a description for the reaction in terms of the order and rate of individual reaction steps and the physical nature of the species on the reaction path. Furthermore, this reaction framework provides a foundation for a future in-depth analysis of energy transduction by topoisomerase II, for guiding and interpreting future structural studies, and for analyzing the mechanism of drugs that convert topoisomerase into a cellular poison."
https://openalex.org/W2006106306,"Gastric H+,K+-ATPase is shown to transport 2 mol of H+/mol of ATP hydrolysis in isolated hog gastric vesicles. We studied whether the H+ transport mechanism is due to charge transfer and/or transfer of hydronium ion (H3O+). From transport of [18O]H2O, 1.8 mol of water molecule/mol of ATP hydrolysis was found to be transported. We performed a molecular dynamics simulation of the three-dimensional structure model of the H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit at E1 conformation. It predicts the presence of a charge transfer pathway from hydronium ion in cytosolic medium to Glu-345 in cation binding site 2 (H3O+-Lys-164 -Gln-161-Glu-345). No charge transport pathway was formed in mutant Q161L, E345L, and E345D. Alternative pathways (H3O+-Gln-161-Glu-345) in mutant K164L and (H3O+-Arg-105-Gln-161-Gln-345) in mutant E345Q were formed. The H+,K+-ATPase activity in these mutants reflected the presence and absence of charge transfer pathways. We also found charge transfer from sites 2 to 1 via a water wire and a charge transfer pathway (H3O+-Asn-794 -Glu-797). These results suggest that protons are charge-transferred from the cytosolic side to H2O in sites 2 and 1, the H2O comes from cytosolic medium, and H3O+ in the sites are transported into lumen during the conformational transition from E1PtoE2P.

In P-type ATPases such as Na+,K+-ATPase, Ca2+-ATPase, and H+,K+-ATPase, at least two conformation states exist, E1 and E2, with conformational changes being accompanied by ion transportation (1Jørgensen P.L. Andersen J.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 103: 95-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation forces the enzyme into the E2 conformation and, after dephosphorylation, returns the enzyme to the E1 conformation. The cation binding sites of these pumps have high affinity for cytosolic transporting cation (H+ in the case of H+,K+-ATPase) in the E1 and low affinity in the E2 conformation, and they face the cytoplasm in the E1 and lumen in the E2 conformation. Furthermore, cation binding to the sites transiently induces the cation-occluded conformation (1Jørgensen P.L. Andersen J.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 103: 95-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar).

Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 5398-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) show that reaction steps of gastric H+,K+-ATPase are similar to those of Ca2+-ATPase and Na+,K+-ATPase and that the α-subunit contains two cation binding sites. The molecular K+ pathway from the lumen to the cytoplasm via the cation binding site has been studied based on the homology modeling with site-directed mutagenesis (17Munson K. Law R.J. Sachs G. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 5398-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of proton transport, especially transport from the cytosolic medium to the cation binding sites, has not been clarified yet. Here, we studied whether the H+ transport mechanism is due to charge transfer and/or movement of hydronium ion (H3O+). For this, we measured water transport activity of gastric H+,K+-ATPase using [18O]H2O and found H2O and/or H3O+ transport is coupled with the ATP hydrolysis. We also constructed three-dimensional structure models of the gastric H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit based on the homology modeling of the E1 conformation of the Ca2+-ATPase and performed molecular dynamics simulations. These simulations predicted the presence of charge transfer pathways from the cytosolic medium to cation binding site 2 and the presence of another charge transfer pathway from site 2 to cation binding site 1. We also simulated these pathways in several mutated H+,K+-ATPase α-subunits and compared the results of simulation with those of mutant K+-ATPase activity.

All other reagents were of molecular biology grade or the highest grade of purity available. Preparation of Hog Gastric Vesicles—Tightly sealed membrane vesicles (GI gastric vesicles) which contain H+,K+-ATPase were prepared from hog stomachs as described previously (18Takeguchi N. Joshima R. Inoue Y. Kashiwagura T. Morii M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3094-3098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The content of tightly sealed inside-out vesicles evaluated from valinomycin-induced K+-ATPase activity was 97% at 25 °C (19Suzuki H. Kamakura M. Morii M. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10429-10434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Gastric vesicles in 250 mm sucrose solution were stored at -85 °C until use and thawed on ice before use. Assay of Water Transport in Gastric Vesicles—ATP hydrolysis-dependent water transport activity in hog GI gastric vesicles was assayed using stable [18O]H2O. One ml of gastric vesicle solution (GI fraction, 1 mg/ml) containing 130 mm KCl, 4 mm MgSO4, 10 μg/ml valinomycin, 8 atom% [18O]H2O, and 40 mm PIPES/Tris (pH 6.8) was incubated in the presence or absence of 4 mm ATP for 20 min at 25 °C. Then, sample solutions were filtrated through a 0.45-μm membrane filter (Millipore, HAWP 02500). Gastric vesicles on the filter were washed with 10 ml of washing solution containing 130 mm KCl and 40 mm PIPES/Tris (pH 6.8). The wet filter was sandwiched between two polyethylene sheets, heat-sealed, and preserved in a cooler with dry ice until measurement. Trapped [18O]H2O on the filter was equilibrated with pure [16O]CO2 in a closed chamber. Then, the content of [18O]CO2 was quantified by a mass spectrum analysis. These analyses were performed at the stable isotope analytical service center of Iso-Analytical Ltd. (Sandbach, UK). ATP hydrolysis-dependent proton accumulation into gastric vesicles was measured from the quench of acridine orange fluorescence under the same conditions as those employed for the [18O]H2O transport experiments as described previously (20Morii M. Hayata Y. Mizoguchi K. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4068-4072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—cDNAs of α- and β-subunits were prepared from rabbit gastric mucosa as described elsewhere (9Asano S. Matsuda S. Tega Y. Shimizu K. Sakamoto S. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17668-17674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These were cloned in pcDNA3.1/ZEO(+) and pcDNA3, respectively. For numbering the amino acid sequence of the gastric H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit, the cDNA sequence of the rabbit gastric H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit (GenBank™ accession number P27112) was adopted. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit as described previously (21Asano S. Yoshida A. Yashiro H. Kobayashi Y. Morisato A. Ogawa H. Takeguchi N. Morii M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13968-13975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The mutated cDNA sequences were verified using a Long-Read Tower DNA sequencer (GE Healthcare). HEK293 cell line stably expressing the wild type β-subunit was subjected to transfection with the α-subunit (either wild type or mutant) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent, which resulted in stable co-expression of the α and β subunits (22Kimura T. Yoshida A. Tabuchi Y. Ikari A. Takeguchi N. Asano S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Characterizations of Transfected H+,K+-ATPase in HEK293 Cells—Membrane fractions of HEK293 cells were prepared as described previously (7Asano S. Tega Y. Konishi K. Fujioka M. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2740-2745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, the samples (30 μg of protein) were incubated in a modified Laemmli sample buffer containing 2% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 65 mm Tris/HCl (pH 6.8) for 10 min at room temperature and applied to 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked with a 4% Block Ace solution (Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan). The proteins were detected with an anti-gastric H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit antibody, Ab1024, which recognizes the carboxyl-terminal peptide (residues 1024-1034) (23Asano S. Arakawa S. Hirasawa M. Sakai H. Ohta M. Ohta K. Takeguchi N. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). After incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody, the bands were visualized with the ECLplus kit (GE Healthcare) and scanned using a luminescent image analyzer LAS-1000plus (FUJIFILM Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The contents of α-subunit in membrane fractions prepared from HEK293 cells were estimated from the linear range of a standard curve. To obtain the standard calibration curve, the signal intensities of the α-subunit band of a series of diluted gastric vesicle preparations were plotted against the content of the α-subunit. About 60% of gastric vesicle proteins was H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit (22Kimura T. Yoshida A. Tabuchi Y. Ikari A. Takeguchi N. Asano S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To confirm the expression of transfected protein to the plasma membrane, cell surface biotinylation was performed in a cold room (4 °C) as following. Transfected HEK293 cells (1 × 106 cells/well) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm MgSO4 and 2.5 mm CaCl2 (PBS++) and incubated with 1 ml of EZ Link Sulfo-HNS-SS-Biotin labeling reagent (0.5 mg/ml) for 15 min. The cells were washed with PBS++ and solubilized with 500 μl of a lysis buffer solution (150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 0.09 units/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) and vortexed for 30 min. Lysed solution was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min, and the protein concentration of supernatant was adjusted to 1.5 mg/ml. Twenty μl of avidin-agarose solution (≥1.0 mg/ml) was added to 400 μl of the supernatant and rotated for 2 h, then centrifuged at 5000 × g for 7 min. This procedure was repeated one more time. The combined precipitates were washed with PBS solution containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and suspended in 100 μl of PBS solution. Isolated surface proteins were separated from biotin-avidin complex by incubation with a modified Laemmli sample buffer solution for 15 min at 37 °C and separated with 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The α- and β-subunits were detected with Ab1024 (for α-subunit) and 2B6 (for β-subunit) antibodies. Cell surface expression levels of the α-subunit were calculated as content percentage of the isolated surface α-subunit. Fluorescence Immunocytochemistry—HEK293 cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol for 7 min and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 15 min at room temperature. Nonspecific binding was blocked using 3% bovine serum albumin. The permeabilized cells were incubated with the Ab1024 (for α-subunit) and 2B6 (for β-subunit) antibodies (1:100 dilution) overnight at 4 °C and then with the Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (for α-subunit) and Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (for β-subunit) (1:100 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunofluorescence images were visualized with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, Jena, Germany). Assay of SCH28080-sensitive K+-ATPase Activity—K+-stimulated ATPase activity (K+-ATPase activity) of the membrane fraction prepared from HEK293 cells was measured in the presence and absence of 50 μm SCH28080 in 1 ml of sample solution which contained 50 μg of membrane protein, 3 mm MgSO4, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm NaN3, 2 mm ouabain, 15 mm KCl, and 40 mm Tris/HCl (pH 6.8). After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the released inorganic phosphate was measured as described previously (24Yoda A. Hokin L.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 40: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The SCH28080-sensitive K+-ATPase activity was calculated as the difference between activities in the presence and absence of SCH28080. Usually, K+-ATPase activities of mutants and the wild type were measured in pairs where the wild type cells and mutant cells were cultured also at the same time. pH profile of the K+-ATPase activity was measured in a 1 ml of sample solution containing 50 μg of membrane protein, 3 mm MgSO4, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm NaN3, 2 mm ouabain, 15 mm KCl, and 40 mm Mes/Tris (pH 5.5-6.5), or 40 mm Tris/HCl (pH 6.8-8.0) in the presence and absence of 50 μm SCH28080. Assay of Rb+ Transport Activity—Rb+ was used as a surrogate ion of K+.Rb+ transport assay was performed as described previously (22Kimura T. Yoshida A. Tabuchi Y. Ikari A. Takeguchi N. Asano S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). One day before the transport assay, cells were seeded in two sets of 6-well collagen type I-coated plates; one set for the 86Rb+ transport assay and the other set for counting cell number. They were grown until confluence. Cells in each well were incubated in a 1 ml sample solution containing 144 mm NaCl, 5 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 6.8), 0.5 mm MgSO4, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm RbCl (containing 3 × 106 cpm 86Rb+), 500 μm ouabain, and 10 μm furosemide, an inhibitor of Na-K-2Cl symporter, for 10 min at 37 °C. Rb+ transport was measured in the presence and absence of 50 μm SCH28080. After a 10-min incubation, the medium was removed, and each well was washed 3 times with 2 ml of ice-cold wash solution containing 144 mm NaCl and 5 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.4). Cells were solubilized with 2 ml of lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P40, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4). One ml of solution was mixed with 5 ml of aqueous counting scintillant ACS-II (GE Healthcare), and radioactivity was counted. The Rb+ transport activity was calculated as the difference between activities in the presence and absence of SCH28080 and expressed in μmol of Rb+/106 cells/min. After subtraction of mock activity, the Rb+ transport activities were normalized, dividing by the number of the cells on the each well and also dividing by the cell surface expression level of the α-subunit. Homology Modeling of the Gastric H+,K+-ATPase α-Subunit and Molecular Dynamics Simulation—Amino acid sequences of the transmembrane helices and lumenal loops of gastric H+,K+-ATPase (from six different animal species) and Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit were aligned with that of rabbit SR Ca2+ pump using the gapped BLAST program (25Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59933) Google Scholar) with default parameters. Then, multiple alignments were obtained by ClustalW program (26Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55767) Google Scholar) to reduce the possibility of different alignments under the assumption that lipid-facing residues tend to be variable, whereas those involved in helix-helix contacts tend to be conserved (26Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55767) Google Scholar, 27Ogawa H. Toyoshima C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15977-15982Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Aligned sequences were inspected and adjusted manually to avoid gaps within the transmembrane helices. Three-dimensional structure models of the gastric H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit were constructed using the MODELLER program (28Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10565) Google Scholar) based on the atomic model of the Ca2+-bound form (E1 conformation, Protein Data Bank code 1SU4) of rabbit SR Ca2+-ATPase with restriction of partial structures. Structures of long insertion of the H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit (Gly-2-Met-50 and Arg-658-Asn-677) were restricted to the predicted structures obtained by PredictProtein (29Rost B. Yachdav G. Liu J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). Next, we performed energy minimization and molecular dynamics simulation to obtain the dynamic structure of the E1 conformation in the presence of 14 neutralizing Na+ ions and about 5000 water molecules in both the cytosolic and luminal medium. Energy minimization and molecular dynamics calculation at constant temperature 300 K were carried out using the AMBER 8 program (30Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.S. Cheatham III, T.E. DeBolt S. Ferguson D. Seibel G. Kollman P. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 1-41Crossref Scopus (2671) Google Scholar). Calculations were performed using a Linux high performance cluster computer system (32 CPUs). Models were visualized by the VMD program (31Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (39018) Google Scholar). Side chain hydrogen bonds and hydrogen bonds between water molecules (-NH—O=C-, -NH—O<, -OH—O=C-, -OH—O<) were surveyed with criteria of a 3.0-Å bond length and a 160-180° bond angle in VMD program. Statistics—Results are shown as mean ± S.E. Comparison between the two groups was made using Student's t test. Statistically significant differences were assumed at p < 0.05 versus control. Water Transport Activity of Hog Gastric Vesicles—If the pump transports hydronium ions (H3O+) from the cytosolic medium into gastric vesicles or if charge transfer couples with water transport (H2O), [18O]H2O in the cytosolic medium will be transported into the vesicles. And if only the charge transfer is involved in H+ pumping, [18O]H2O in the cytosolic medium will not be transported. We measured water transport using stable [18O]H2O from the cytosolic medium into the vesicles. The naturally occurring (environmental) content of 18O is about 2000 ppm (32Craig H. Science. 1961; 133: 1702-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (5723) Google Scholar). In fact, our experimental value was 1998.69 ± 0.23ppm (n = 3). Taking this background 18O content into consideration, we added 8 atom % of [18O]H2O to a sample solution which contained 1 mg of protein/ml of GI vesicles. After incubating the vesicle solution in the presence and absence of ATP for 20 min, the solution was filtered. The incubation time (20 min) was chosen because protons that had accumulated in the intravesicular space began to leak due to exhaustion of added ATP as determined from the measurement of change in acridine orange fluorescence (supplemental Fig. 1). Trapped [18O]H2O on the filter was equilibrated with pure [16O]CO2 in a closed chamber. Then the content of [18O]CO2 was quantified with a mass spectrum analysis. The averaged weight of trapped water on the filter was measured using a drying method and was 55.4 ± 0.78 mg (n = 18). Therefore, 123 μg ((55.4 × 10-3/(18 + 20 × 1998.69 × 10-6)) × 1998.69 × 10-6 × 20) of environmental [18O]H2O was found on the filter without the addition of [18O]H2O (Fig. 1). In a sample solution containing 8 atom % of [18O]H2O in the absence of ATP, the content of trapped [18O]H2O was higher than that of the above background. This may be due to absorption of [18O]H2O to the surface of gastric vesicles and filter. In a sample solution incubated in the presence of 4 mm ATP for 20 min, the trapped [18O]H2O was significantly increased by 7.25 μg per filter, and this increment was completely diminished by the addition of 50 μm SCH28080 (Fig. 1). Taking a separate experimental result into consideration that ∼80% of GI vesicle proteins was trapped on the membrane filter, 9 μg of [18O]H2O was calculated to be trapped per 1 mg of protein of GI vesicles. This trapped [18O]H2O was equivalent to 0.45 μmol (9 × 10-6/20.0) of [18O]H2O. That is, 5.8 μmol ((0.45 × 10-6 × 100/8)/0.97) of water molecules were transported per tightly sealed 1 mg of protein of GI vesicles during the ATP hydrolysis reaction. The K+-ATPase activity of GI vesicles was 44.2 ± 1.7 μmol of Pi/mg of protein/h (n = 3) and accounted for about 80% of the total ATPase activity in the present vesicle preparation (20% of the total enzyme activity was due to Mg2+-ATPase activity). Assuming that 4 mm ATP (4 μmol ATP/ml sample solution) was almost completely hydrolyzed during the 20-min incubation (for transport, 3.2 μmol of ATP/ml sample solution), the present experimental results showed that 5.8 μmol of the cytosolic water was transported during the hydrolysis of 3.2 μmol of ATP. The coupling ratio between the water transport and ATP hydrolysis was 1.8 (5.8/3.2). This value is close to the theoretical (2.0) and experimental coupling ratios (1.74-2.79) obtained from the change in the extravesicular pH induced by proton uptake into the vesicles in a weak buffer (33Rabon E.C. McFall T.L. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6296-6299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present results indicate that H+ transport by gastric H+,K+-ATPase is due to H3 O+ movement or to charge transfer, which is coupled with H2O movement. Effects of site-directed mutagenesis in H+,K+-ATPase on the water transport activity could not be evaluated because the membrane preparations from HEK293 cells were not tightly sealed as described previously (7Asano S. Tega Y. Konishi K. Fujioka M. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2740-2745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Proton Transport Pathway of the Gastric H+,K+-ATPase α-Subunit from the Cytosolic Side to Cation Binding Site 2—Here we explored the possibility that charge transfer pathway is involved in the H+ transport. The molecular dynamics simulation in the presence of 14 neutralizing Na+ ions and about 5000 water molecules showed the presence of side-chain hydrogen bonds that are necessary for charge transfer. We found that a charge transfer pathway (H3 O+-Lys-164 -Gln-161-Glu-345) toward site 2 is possible, where Lys-164 on the M2 stalk is located in the cytosolic surface, Glu-345, which is involved in formation of cation binding site 2, is located at the helix-disrupted position between the two connecting M4 stalks, and Gln-161 on the M2 as electron acceptor and donor is located between these basic (electron donor) and acidic (electron acceptor) amino acid residues (Fig. 2). The motion of hydrogen bonds and amino acid residues that are involved in formation of this pathway for 39.4 ps is shown in a movie (supplemental movie 1). Because binding site 2 accepts one H2O molecule (or H3 O+) as found in Ca2+-ATPase (2Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar), the positive charge at Glu-345 is relayed to the water molecule in site 2, which results in formation of H3 O+. Next, we simulated charge transfer pathway in mutant K164L and K164A and found that hydrogen bonds between Leu-164 and Gln-161 and between Ala-164 and Gln-161 are not formed, but an alternative shorter charge transfer pathway (H3 O+-Gln-161-Glu-345) is possible (Fig. 3). Also, we simulated charge transfer pathways in mutant Q161L (Fig. 4A) and E345L (Fig. 4B), but no charge transfer pathway was found.FIGURE 4Molecular dynamics simulation of mutant Q161L (A) and E345L (B) in the E1 conformation. No charge transfer to Glu-345 (A) or to Leu-345 (B) in binding site 2 occurred in both mutants.

Fig. 5 (A and B) shows the expression level of the α-subunit of mutants and the wild type in the membrane preparations from these cells. Fig. 5C shows the SCH28080-sensitive K+-ATPase activity in these preparations. The mutant expression levels were 75-122% that of the wild type level. Cell surface biotinylation experiments showed that there is no significant difference between cell surface expression levels of the wild type and these mutants (Fig. 6, A and C). Sugar chains of the β-subunit in the cell surface were of only a complex type, whereas the cell lysate contained both high mannose and complex types (Fig. 6B) (22Kimura T. Yoshida A. Tabuchi Y. Ikari A. Takeguchi N. Asano S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Cell surface expressions of the α- and β-subunits were also confirmed by fluorescence immunocytochemistry. The α-subunit in the wild type and mutant K164L, K164A, Q161L, and E345L was co-localized with β-subunit in the plasma membrane"
https://openalex.org/W2059499977,"The Haemophilus influenzae HMW1 adhesin is secreted via the two-partner secretion pathway and requires HMW1B for translocation across the outer membrane. HMW1B belongs to the Omp85-TpsB superfamily of transporters and consists of two structural domains, a C-terminal transmembrane beta-barrel and an N-terminal periplasmic domain. We investigated the electrophysiological properties of the purified full-length HMW1B and the C-terminal domain using planar lipid bilayers. Both the full-length and the truncated proteins formed conductive pores with a low open probability, two well defined conductance states, and other substates. The kinetic patterns of the two conductance states were distinct, with rapid and frequent transitions to the small conductance state and occasional and more prolonged openings to the large conductance state. The channel formed by the full-length HMW1B showed selectivity for cations, which decreased when measured at pH 5.2, suggesting the presence of acidic residues in the pore. The C-terminal domain of HMW1B was less stable and required reconstitution into liposomes prior to insertion in the bilayer. It formed a channel of smaller conductance but a similar gating pattern as the full-length protein, demonstrating the ability of the last 312 C-terminal amino acids to form a pore and suggesting that the periplasmic domain is not involved in occluding the pore, nor in controlling the inherent basal kinetics of the channel. The HMW1 pro-piece containing the secretion domain, although binding to the channel with high affinity, did not induce channel opening."
