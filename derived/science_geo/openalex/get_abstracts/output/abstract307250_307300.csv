https://openalex.org/W1971590985,"Small amounts of stishovite were separated from specimens of explosively shocked sandstones, novaculite, and single-crystal quartz. Estimated peak pressures for the syntheses ranged from 150 to 280 kilobars, and shock temperatures were from 150° to 900°C. No coesite was detected in any sample. It is suggested that quartz can invert during shock to a short-range-order phase, with sixfold coordination. A small portion of this phase may develop the long-range order of stishovite, and, during the more protracted decrease of the pressure pulse through the stability field of coesite accompanying meteorite crater formation, a portion may invert to coesite."

https://openalex.org/W1978644904,"Increasing the carbon dioxide content of air reduces the transpiration rate of corn and sorghum plants and, to a lesser extent, of cotton, soybean, and tomato plants by causing the stomata to close. Closure of corn and sorghum stomata occurred when the concentrations of carbon dioxide were 2000 and 3000 parts per million, respectively. Cotton, soybean, and tomato stomata did not close completely at concentrations of carbon dioxide up to 4000 parts per million."
https://openalex.org/W1999662654,"The flash of Noctiluca miliaris occurs only in response to a characteristic all-or-none action potential, the polarity of which is opposite to that of metazoan action potentials, whether recorded internally or externally. Mechanical stimulation evokes a slow, generator-like graded potential which can give rise to the flash-triggering action potential. The flash is all-or-none; it facilitates, summates, and exhibits fatigue, each independently of changes in the amplitude of the action potential."
https://openalex.org/W2056948361,"The action potential of Noctiluca miliaris is conducted over the cell, triggering luminescent cytoplasmic organelles as it propagates away from the stimulus site. Local light emission follows local active current with a latency of 1 to 3 milliseconds. Whereas bioluminescence normally occurs over this cell with an advancing front of emission, it can be initiated synchronously by electrical stimulation of the entire cell."

The susceptibility of the host plants, the virulence of the fungus or other pathogen, and the weather and other environmental conditions all affect the relative rate of increase. They do so by affecting the time it takes newly infected tissue to become infectious, the time tissue remains infectious, the infectiousness of infectious tissue, and the susceptibility of healthy tissue to infection. These factors operate throughout the epidemic. Two other factors become increasingly important as the epidemic proceeds: the proportion of healthy susceptible tissue remaining available for infection, and the degree of uniformity of the population of host plants and of their environment."

https://openalex.org/W2071618139,"Tritium was used to investigate the withdrawal by small trees of water from soil at three depths. Within 4 hours of placement at each depth, tritium was detected in the transpired water from nearby trees. On the 3rd day after application, 38 times more tritium (per unit volume) was present in transpired water drawn from soil at a depth of 0 to 30.5 centimeters than in water drawn from the 61- to 91.5-centimeter level."
https://openalex.org/W2033091545,"On the basis of the stone record it appears that the Callanish people were as precise as the Stonehengers in setting up their megalithic structure, but not as scientifically advanced. Callanish is, however, a structure that could have been used much as Stonehenge was. It would be interesting to obtain a date, by the radiocarbon method, for the peat in the area of Callanish, to determine how much older, or more recent, than Stonehenge this structure is. Perhaps the knowledge gained at Callanish was later used in the design of Stonehenge."
https://openalex.org/W2040160384,"The continental slope bordering the Bahamian Platform to the east descends precipitously from a shallow edge to oceanic depths. Sustained slopes of at least 40 degrees have been found east of San Salvador. Considerations based on isostatic equilibrium suggest that in this area the oceanic crust may approach the edge of the shelf within a distance as short as 8.5 km. If so, it may be possible to drill and sample a substantial portion of the transitional crust by means of directional drilling techniques from a rig located at the edge of the shelf. It may even be possible, at some future time, to cross the entire crust, pierce the Mohorovicić discontinuity, and penetrate the mantle."

https://openalex.org/W1975757704,There are four possible cases for single solute peaks in ultracentrifuge sedimentation velocity experiments. The peak can be either above or below the baseline and can move toward or away from the cell bottom. With appropriate solvents these cases are demonstrated for a single polymeric solute.

The Joint Committee9s R&D subcommittee was established in 1954 and has been extremely active ever since."
