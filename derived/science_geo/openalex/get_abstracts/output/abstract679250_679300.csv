https://openalex.org/W3194689906,"The COVID-19 pandemic is far more than a health crisis: it has unpredictably changed our whole way of life. As suggested by the analysis of economic data on sales, this dramatic scenario has also heavily impacted individuals’ spending levels. To better understand these changes, the present study focused on consumer behavior and its psychological antecedents. Previous studies found that crises differently affect people’s willingness to buy necessities products (i.e., utilitarian shopping) and non-necessities products (i.e., hedonic shopping). Therefore, in examining whether changes in spending levels were associated with changes in consumer behavior, we adopted a fine-grained approach disentangling between necessities and non-necessities. We administered an online survey to 3833 participants (age range 18–64) during the first peak period of the contagion in Italy. Consumer behavior toward necessities was predicted by anxiety and COVID-related fear, whereas consumer behavior toward non-necessities was predicted by depression. Furthermore, consumer behavior toward necessities and non-necessities was predicted by personality traits, perceived economic stability, and self-justifications for purchasing. The present study extended our understanding of consumer behavior changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results could be helpful to develop marketing strategies that consider psychological factors to meet actual consumers’ needs and feelings."
https://openalex.org/W3194397255,"Compromised placental function or premature loss has been linked to diverse neurodevelopmental disorders. Here we show that placenta allopregnanolone (ALLO), a progesterone-derived GABA-A receptor (GABAAR) modulator, reduction alters neurodevelopment in a sex-linked manner. A new conditional mouse model, in which the gene encoding ALLO's synthetic enzyme (akr1c14) is specifically deleted in trophoblasts, directly demonstrated that placental ALLO insufficiency led to cerebellar white matter abnormalities that correlated with autistic-like behavior only in male offspring. A single injection of ALLO or muscimol, a GABAAR agonist, during late gestation abolished these alterations. Comparison of male and female human preterm infant cerebellum also showed sex-linked myelination marker alteration, suggesting similarities between mouse placental ALLO insufficiency and human preterm brain development. This study reveals a new role for a placental hormone in shaping brain regions and behaviors in a sex-linked manner. Placental hormone replacement might offer novel therapeutic opportunities to prevent later neurobehavioral disorders."

https://openalex.org/W3195999646,"Strategies to combat microbiota-associated health problems are of high interest in pig production. Successful intervention strategies with beneficial long-term effects are still missing. Most studies on pig microbiota have been conducted under standardized experimental conditions, but the situation in commercial farms differs dramatically. This study describes the fecal microbiota in German commercial pig farms under practical conditions. The study is part of the larger project “Optibiom” that aims to use bacterial composition and farm metadata to formulate tailor-made solutions for farm-specific health maintenance strategies. Special consideration is given to the sow-piglet relationship. Fecal samples from sows and their piglets were collected at two time points each in 20 different farms (sows ante- and postpartum and piglets before and after weaning). The extracted DNA was sequenced with Illumina 16S rDNA sequencing. For data analysis and visualization, differential abundance analyses, as well as hierarchical clustering and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) were performed. A new “family unit” was implemented to compare farms based on the association between the microbiota in sows and their offspring. There are distinct changes in the microbial communities in sows before and after birth as well as in suckling and post-weaning piglets. The suckling pig microbiota is particularly different from all other groups and shows a lower bacterial diversity. While dominant genera in antepartum sows further displace the abundance of non-dominant genera postpartum, the opposite was true for piglets, where non-dominant bacteria in the suckling phase became dominant after weaning. The family unit for sows and their piglets led to separate cluster formation for some farms. The results indicate that the sow-piglet relationship is one driving force for the observed differences of the pig farms. The next step in the analysis will be the combination of metadata (feeding, housing and management practices) to find farm-specific differences that can be exploited to formulate a farm-specific health maintenance strategy."
https://openalex.org/W3193530576,"Soil salinization is the widespread problem seriously affecting the agricultural sustainability and causing income losses in arid regions. The major objective of the study was to quantify and map the spatial variability of soil salinity and sodicity. Determining salinity and sodicity variability in different soil layers was the second objective. Finally, proposing an approach for delineating different salinity and sodicity zones was the third objective. The study was carried out in 871.1 ha farmland in Southeast of Dushak town of Ahal Province, Turkmenistan. Soil properties, including electrical conductivity (EC), soil reaction (pH), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), calcium carbonate and particle size distribution (clay, silt and sand fractions) in 0-30, 30-60, 60-90 and 90-120 cm soil layers were recorded. The EC values in different soil layers indicated serious soil salinization problem in the study area. The mean EC values in 0-90 cm depth were high (8 dS m-1), classifying the soils as moderate to strongly saline. Spatial dependence calculated by the nugget to sill ratio indicated a strong spatial autocorrelation. The elevation was the primary factor affecting spatial variation of soil salinity in the study area. The reclamation of the field can be planned based on three distinct areas, i.e., high (≥12 dS m-1), moderate (12-8 dS m-1) and low (<8 dS m-1) EC values. The spatial trend analyses of SAR values revealed similar patterns for EC and pH; both of which gradually decreased from north to the south-west. The amount of water needed to leach down the salts from 60 cm of soil profile is between 56.4-150.0 ton ha-1 and the average leaching water was 89.8 tons ha-1. The application of leaching water based on the amount of average leaching water will result in higher or lower leaching water application to most locations and the efficiency of the reclamation efforts will be low. Similar results were recorded for sulfur, sulfuric acid and gypsum requirements to remediate sodicity. The results concluded that the best management strategy in planning land development and reclamation schemes for saline and sodic soils require accurate information about the spatial distribution of salinity and sodicity across the target area."
https://openalex.org/W3194144093,"Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a global health problem associated with an increased risk of diabetes mellitus (DM), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer. Body composition parameters, including obesity, visceral adiposity, and sarcopenia contribute to the development of MS and CVD. Previous studies have investigated the association of individual body composition parameters with MS. Studies analyzing the association between multiple body composition parameters and MS have been rare. We aimed to investigate the association between MS and multiple body composition parameters, including obesity, visceral adiposity, and sarcopenia.A total of 13,620 subjects who underwent voluntary routine checkups at the Health Care Center of our institution between October 2014 and December 2019 were enrolled. Only data from the first examination of subjects who underwent repeated checkups were included. Clinical and laboratory data were collected. Skeletal muscle mass and visceral fat area (VFA) were measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) was divided by body weight (in kg) and expressed as a percentage (calculated as, ASM% = ASM × 100/Weight). Data were compared between the groups based on obesity, VFA, and ASM%. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the risk of MS in each group.Body mass index and VFA were significantly higher in subjects with MS than in those without MS. ASM% was significantly lower in subjects with MS than in those without MS. Subjects with obesity, visceral adiposity, or sarcopenia had a higher prevalence of MS than those without. As the number of metabolic components increased from 0 to 5, we identified a decreasing trend of ASM% and an increasing trend of VFA and BMI (P for trend < 0.001 for all). In the paired analyses, all the three body composition parameters showed additive effects in predicting MS. In the logistic regression analysis, the three parameters were associated with an increased risk of MS after adjustment for age, sex, hypertension, DM, dyslipidemia, smoking, alcohol intake, and C-reactive protein.Obesity, visceral adiposity, and sarcopenia showed additive effects on MS prediction. Subjects with obesity, visceral adiposity, or sarcopenia were significantly associated with the increased risk of MS after adjustment for multiple confounders. Increasing skeletal muscle and reducing visceral fat may be strategies for the prevention or treatment of MS."
https://openalex.org/W3195313542,"Bacteria require a precise balance of copper ions to ensure that essential cuproproteins are fully metalated while also avoiding copper-induced toxicity. The Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis maintains appropriate copper homeostasis in part through the ycn operon. The ycn operon comprises genes encoding three proteins: the putative copper importer YcnJ, the copper-dependent transcriptional repressor YcnK, and the uncharacterized Domain of Unknown Function 1775 (DUF1775) containing YcnI. DUF1775 domains are found across bacterial phylogeny, and bioinformatics analyses indicate that they frequently neighbor domains implicated in copper homeostasis and transport. Here, we investigated whether YcnI can interact with copper and, using electron paramagnetic resonance and inductively coupled plasma-MS, found that this protein can bind a single Cu(II) ion. We determine the structure of both the apo and copper-bound forms of the protein by X-ray crystallography, uncovering a copper-binding site featuring a unique monohistidine brace ligand set that is highly conserved among DUF1775 domains. These data suggest a possible role for YcnI as a copper chaperone and that DUF1775 domains in other bacterial species may also function in copper homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W3195699652,"During the Neogene, many North American ungulates evolved longer limbs. Presumably, this allowed them to move more efficiently or quickly in open habitats, which became more common during this interval. Evidence suggests that open habitats appeared even earlier in South America, but no study to date has investigated whether the ungulate-like mammals of South America (South American native ungulates or SANUs) evolved similar limb adaptations. We analyzed limb elongation in the two predominant SANU groups, notoungulates and litopterns, by compiling genus-level occurrences from the late Oligocene to the Pleistocene and calculating metatarsal/femur ratio (Mt:F). None of the groups or subgroups we analyzed show a pronounced increase in Mt:F across this interval, with the possible exception of proterotheriid litopterns. Proterotheriids are thought to have inhabited forested environments rather than open ones, which raises questions about the selective forces responsible for limb elongation in ungulates. Conversely, notoungulates, which are traditionally thought to have lived in open habitats, show no strong trend of increasing Mt:F across this interval. Our study suggests that the macroevolutionary trend of limb elongation in ungulate-like mammals is not universal and is highly influenced by the evolutionary affinities of the groups being analyzed."
https://openalex.org/W3196229169,"Unusually warm conditions recently observed in the Pacific Arctic region included a dramatic loss of sea ice cover and an enhanced inflow of warmer Pacific-derived waters. Moored sediment traps deployed at three biological hotspots of the Distributed Biological Observatory (DBO) during this anomalously warm period collected sinking particles nearly continuously from June 2017 to July 2019 in the northern Bering Sea (DBO2) and in the southern Chukchi Sea (DBO3), and from August 2018 to July 2019 in the northern Chukchi Sea (DBO4). Fluxes of living algal cells, chlorophyll a (chl a ), total particulate matter (TPM), particulate organic carbon (POC), and zooplankton fecal pellets, along with zooplankton and meroplankton collected in the traps, were used to evaluate spatial and temporal variations in the development and composition of the phytoplankton and zooplankton communities in relation to sea ice cover and water temperature. The unprecedented sea ice loss of 2018 in the northern Bering Sea led to the export of a large bloom dominated by the exclusively pelagic diatoms Chaetoceros spp. at DBO2. Despite this intense bloom, early sea ice breakup resulted in shorter periods of enhanced chl a and diatom fluxes at all DBO sites, suggesting a weaker biological pump under reduced ice cover in the Pacific Arctic region, while the coincident increase or decrease in TPM and POC fluxes likely reflected variations in resuspension events. Meanwhile, the highest transport of warm Pacific waters during 2017–2018 led to a dominance of the small copepods Pseudocalanus at all sites. Whereas the export of ice-associated diatoms during 2019 suggested a return to more typical conditions in the northern Bering Sea, the impact on copepods persisted under the continuously enhanced transport of warm Pacific waters. Regardless, the biological pump remained strong on the shallow Pacific Arctic shelves."
https://openalex.org/W3193331477,"On the mountains, along an elevation gradient, we generally observe an ample variation in temperature, with the associated difference in vegetation structure and composition and soil properties. With the aim of quantifying the relative importance of temperature, vegetation and edaphic properties on soil respiration (SR), we investigated changes in SR along an elevation gradient (404 to 2101 m a.s.l) in the southern slopes of the Alps in Northern Italy. We also analysed soil physicochemical properties, including soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (N) stocks, fine root C and N, litter C and N, soil bulk densities and soil pH at five forest sites, and also stand structural properties, including vegetation height, age and basal area. Our results indicated that SR rates increased with temperature in all sites, and 55–76% of SR variability was explained by temperature. Annual cumulative SR, ranging between 0.65–1.40 kg C m -2 yr -1 , decreased along the elevation gradient, while temperature sensitivity (Q10) of SR increased with elevation. However, a high SR rate (1.27 kg C m -2 yr -1 ) and low Q10 were recorded in the mature conifer forest stand at 1731 m a.s.l., characterized by an uneven-aged structure and high dominant tree height, resulting in a nonlinear relationship between elevation and temperature. Reference SR at 10°C (SR ref ) was unrelated to elevation, but was related to tree height. A significant negative linear relationship was found between bulk density and elevation. Conversely, SOC, root C and N stock, pH, and litter mass were best fitted by nonlinear relationships with elevation. However, these parameters were not significantly correlated with SR when the effect of temperature was removed (SR ref ). These results demonstrate that the main factor affecting SR in forest ecosystems along this Alpine elevation gradient is temperature, but its regulating role can be strongly influenced by site biological characteristics, particularly vegetation type and structure, affecting litter quality and microclimate. This study also confirms that high elevation sites are rich in SOC and more sensitive to climate change, being prone to high C losses as CO 2 . Furthermore, our data indicate a positive relationship between Q10 and dominant tree height, suggesting that mature forest ecosystems characterized by an uneven-age structure, high SR ref and moderate Q10, may be more resilient."
https://openalex.org/W3194641760,"We report a new specimen of the plesiosaur Cardiocorax mukulu that includes the most complete plesiosaur skull from sub-Saharan Africa. The well-preserved three-dimensional nature of the skull offers rare insight into the cranial anatomy of elasmosaurid plesiosaurians. The new specimen of Cardiocorax mukulu was recovered from Bentiaba, Namibe Province in Angola, approximately three meters above the holotype. The new specimen also includes an atlas-axis complex, seventeen postaxial cervical vertebrae, partial ribs, a femur, and limb elements. It is identified as Cardiocorax mukulu based on an apomorphy shared with the holotype where the cervical neural spine is approximately as long anteroposteriorly as the centrum and exhibits a sinusoidal anterior margin. The new specimen is nearly identical to the holotype and previously referred material in all other aspects. Cardiocorax mukulu is returned in an early-branching or intermediate position in Elasmosauridae in four out of the six of our phylogenetic analyses. Cardiocorax mukulu lacks the elongated cervical vertebrae that is characteristic of the extremely long-necked elasmosaurines, and the broad skull with and a high number of maxillary teeth (28–40) which is characteristic of Aristonectinae. Currently, the most parsimonious explanation concerning elasmosaurid evolutionary relationships, is that Cardiocorax mukulu represents an older lineage of elasmosaurids in the Maastrichtian."
https://openalex.org/W3195650392,"Taking advantage of published data on life-history traits and short-term information on fishery parameters from 3132 records for 644 fish stocks along the coast of India, we calculated resilience (R) and vulnerability (V). Further, we developed an Index of Resilience and Vulnerability (IRV) for 133 species of tropical finfishes, crustaceans, and molluscs. Using 7 resilience and 6 vulnerability attributes, two-dimensional scatter plots of the resilience and vulnerability scores were generated and the Euclidean distance and angle from the origin to each point were calculated to determine IRV and the effect of fishing on fish species. By ranking the species, the top 10 highly resilient, highly vulnerable, and high-risk species (low IRV) were identified. While small-sized species with fast growth rate and low trophic level were among the highly resilient species, large predatory species such as sharks and barracudas were among the highly vulnerable and high-risk species. More than 100 of the 133 species were resilient-yet-vulnerable, and most crustaceans showed high resilience. Differences in IRV scores among species within the same family were discernible, indicating the differences in the biological characteristics and response to fishing. Sensitivity analysis indicated that an abridged IRV with 6 attributes works similar to 13 attributes and can be used in data-deficient situations. Comparison of R and V of IRV with other assessments showed different results because of divergences in the objectives, number and types of attributes, and thresholds used. These assessments do not convey the same information and therefore great care must be taken for reproducing these frameworks to other fisheries. The results of IRV analysis can be useful for stock assessments and in developing effective management measures in combination with other complementary information."
https://openalex.org/W3195770009,"Tamoxifen is an estrogen receptor (ER) ligand with widespread use in clinical and basic research settings. Beyond its application in treating ER-positive cancer, tamoxifen has been co-opted into a powerful approach for temporal-specific genetic alteration. The use of tamoxifen-inducible Cre-recombinase mouse models to examine genetic, molecular, and cellular mechanisms of development and disease is now prevalent in biomedical research. Understanding off-target effects of tamoxifen will inform its use in both clinical and basic research applications. Here, we show that prenatal tamoxifen exposure can cause structural birth defects in the mouse. Administration of a single 200 mg/kg tamoxifen dose to pregnant wildtype C57BL/6J mice at gestational day 9.75 caused cleft palate and limb malformations in the fetuses, including posterior digit duplication, reduction, or fusion. These malformations were highly penetrant and consistent across independent chemical manufacturers. As opposed to 200 mg/kg, a single dose of 50 mg/kg tamoxifen at the same developmental stage did not result in overt structural malformations. Demonstrating that prenatal tamoxifen exposure at a specific time point causes dose-dependent developmental abnormalities, these findings argue for more considerate application of tamoxifen in Cre-inducible systems and further investigation of tamoxifen's mechanisms of action."
https://openalex.org/W3196011592,"Access to water is a critical aspect of livestock production, although the relationship between livestock weight gain and water quality remains poorly understood. Previous work has shown that water quality of poorly managed farm dams can be improved by fencing and constructing hardened watering points to limit stock access to the dam, and revegetation to filter contaminant inflow. Here we use cattle weight gain data from three North American studies to develop a cost-benefit analysis for the renovation of farm dams to improve water quality and, in turn, promote cattle weight gain on farms in south-eastern Australia. Our analysis indicated a strong likelihood of positive results and suggested there may be substantial net economic benefit from renovating dams in poor condition to improve water quality. The average per-farm Benefit-Cost Ratios based on deterministic assumptions was 1.5 for New South Wales (NSW) and 3.0 for Victoria in areas where rainfall exceeds 600mm annually. Our analyses suggested that cattle on farms in NSW and Victoria would need to experience additional weight gain from switching to clean water of at least 6.5% and 1.8% per annum respectively, to break even in present value terms. Monte Carlo simulation based on conservative assumptions indicated that the probability of per-farm benefits exceeding costs was greater than 70%. We recommend localised experiments to assess the impact of improved water quality on livestock weight gain in Australian conditions to confirm these expectations empirically."
https://openalex.org/W3194219643,"Background Clinical trials showed strong evidence that voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) reduces the acquisition of HIV among heterosexual men by up to 60%. However, VMMC uptake in East and Southern Africa remains suboptimal, with safety concerns identified as a barrier to uptake. We investigated the occurrence and severity of adverse events (AEs) in a routine VMMC programme implemented in Gauteng and North West provinces of South Africa. Methods We describe the frequency and characteristics of AEs using routinely collected data from a VMMC programme implemented between 01 May 2013 and 31 December 2014. The surgical procedure was provided at fixed clinics and mobile units in three districts. Adult men undertaking the procedure were referred for follow-up appointments where AEs were monitored. Results A total of 7,963 adult men were offered the VMMC service with 7,864 (98.8%) met the age and consent requirements for inclusion in a research follow-up after the surgical procedure and were followed-up for potential AEs. In total, 37 (0.5%) patients reported AEs post-surgery with infection [11 (29.7%)] and excessive bleeding [11 (29.7%)] commonly reported AEs. In terms of severity, 14 (37.8%) were classified as mild, 13 (35.1%) as moderate, and 10 (27.0%) as severe. Further, 32 (86.5%) of the AEs were classified as definitely related to the surgical procedure, with 36 (97.5%) of all AEs resolving without sequelae. Conclusion The VMMC programme was able to reach adult men at high risk of HIV acquisition. Reported AEs in the programme were minimal, with the observed safety profile comparable to clinical trial settings, suggesting that VMMC can be safely administered in a programmatic setting."
https://openalex.org/W3194590802,"The days and weeks after childbirth are crucial for both the mother and her newborn child leading for the majority of maternal and perinatal mortalities. The World Health Organization recommends at least three postnatal visits within 42 days after birth. However, postnatal care utilization remains low worldwide. Quantitative findings revealed low utilization of postnatal care in Ethiopia, however, no study explored the barriers for postnatal care. This study aimed to assess the barriers to postnatal care service utilization in East Gojjam Zone, Northwest Ethiopia.A community-based, mixed type cross-sectional study was conducted from December 15, 2018, to February 15, 2019. The quantitative data was gathered using the interviewer-administered interviewing technique from 751 women who gave birth within one year prior to the study selected by multistage sampling. The qualitative data were collected from purposively sampled women, facility leaders, and health extension workers using in-depth interviews and focused group discussions. The quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed using logistic regression and by the thematic content analysis method, respectively.The study revealed that postnatal care service utilization was 34.6%. The odds of using PNC services were greater in women aged 25-34 years and used maternity waiting home. In contrast, women who were muslim religion followers, had normal or instrumental birth, not aware of the PNC services and whose partners were not supportive of the use of MCH services were less likely to use PNC services. According to the qualitative findings, lack of awareness, traditional beliefs and religious practices, distance and transportation, environmental exposure, and waiting time were identified as barriers to PNC service utilization.The study showed low utilization of PNC services in East Gojjam zone, northwest Ethiopia. Improvements in personal health education, in construction of relevant infrastructure, and to transport, are needed to remove or reduce barriers to PNC service use in East Gojjam Zone, Northwest Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W3195866136,"Purpose Evaluation of symptoms and signs for the management of neuropathic cancer pain (NCP) is challenging. This study aimed to identify clinical predictors of NCP and symptoms and signs most relevant of those in Korean patients. Methods This nationwide, descriptive, cross-sectional, multicenter, observational study included 2,003 cancer patients aged ≥20 years who reported a visual analog scale (VAS) score ≥1 for pain and provided informed consent for participation. The Douleur Neuropathic (DN4) questionnaire (score ≥4) was used to determine symptoms and signs as well as the presence of NCP. Results The prevalence of NCP was associated with age &lt;65 years [OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.270–1.934], disease duration &gt;6 months (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.232–2.012), stage IV cancer (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.593–0.955), history of chemotherapy (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.225–2.472), and moderate-to-severe cancer pain (OR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.671–2.524) after multivariate analysis. The most common descriptive symptoms of NCP were tingling, electric shock, and pins and needles. For NCP patients in the presence or absence of the clinical predictors, pins and needles (p = 0.001) and painful cold (p&lt;0.001) symptoms were significantly frequent in patients with moderate-to-severe pain. Tingling, numbness, and touch hypoesthesia (p = 0.022, 0.033, 0.024, respectively) were more frequent in those with longer cancer duration and hyperesthesia (p = 0.024) was more frequent in young patients. Conclusion Age &lt;65 years, disease duration &gt;6 months, stage IV cancer, history of chemotherapy, and moderate-to-severe cancer pain, were identified as predictors of NCP. Some symptoms and signs of NCP were associated with these predictors. Further studies are warranted on the pathogenesis and management of NCP with respect to the symptoms and signs, and factors associated with pain severity in Korean patients."
https://openalex.org/W3195870713,"Thyroid hormones are messengers that bind to specific nuclear receptors and regulate a wide range of physiological processes in the early stages of vertebrate embryonic development, including neurodevelopment and myelogenesis. We here tested the effects of reduced T3 availability upon the myelination process by treating zebrafish embryos with low concentrations of iopanoic acid (IOP) to block T4 to T3 conversion. Black Gold II staining showed that T3 deficiency reduced the myelin density in the forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain and the spinal cord at 3 and 7 dpf. These observations were confirmed in 3 dpf mbp:egfp transgenic zebrafish, showing that the administration of IOP reduced the fluorescent signal in the brain. T3 rescue treatment restored brain myelination and reversed the changes in myelin-related gene expression induced by IOP exposure. NG2 immunostaining revealed that T3 deficiency reduced the amount of oligodendrocyte precursor cells in 3 dpf IOP-treated larvae. Altogether, the present results show that inhibition of T4 to T3 conversion results in hypomyelination, suggesting that THs are part of the key signaling molecules that control the timing of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin synthesis from very early stages of brain development."
https://openalex.org/W3195895828,"Healthcare systems monitor and improve mental health treatment quality, access, continuity and satisfaction through use of population-based and efficiency-based staffing models, the former focused on staffing ratios and the latter, staff productivity. Preliminary evidence suggests that both high staffing ratios and moderate-to-high staff productivity are important for ensuring a full continuum of mental health services to indicated populations.With an information-theoretic approach, we conducted a longitudinal investigation of mental health staffing, productivity and treatment at the largest integrated healthcare system in American, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). VHA facilities (N = 140) served as the unit of measure, with mental health treatment quality, access, continuity and satisfaction predicted by facility staffing and productivity in longitudinal mixed models. An information-theoretic approach: (a) entails the development of a comprehensive set of plausible models that are fit, ranked and weighted to quantitatively assess the relative support for each, and (b) accounts for model uncertainty while identifying best-fit model(s) that include important and exclude unimportant explanatory variables. In best-fit models, higher staffing was the strongest and most consistent predictor of better treatment quality, access, continuity and satisfaction. Higher staff productivity was often, but not always associated with better treatment quality, access, continuity and satisfaction. Results were further nuanced by differential prediction of treatment by between- and within-facility predictor effects and variable interactions.A population-based mental health staffing ratio and an efficiency-based productivity value are important longitudinal predictors of mental health treatment quality, access, continuity and satisfaction. Our longitudinal design and use of mixed regression models and an information-theoretic approach addresses multiple limitations of prior studies and strengthen our results. Results are discussed in terms of the provision of mental health treatment by healthcare systems, and analytical modeling of treatment quality, access, continuity and satisfaction."
https://openalex.org/W3190058886,"One of the prevailing approaches to the study of the global economy is the analysis of global city networks based on the activities of multinational firms. Research in this vein generally conceptualises cities as nodes, and the intra-firm relations between them as ties, forming the building blocks for globally scaled interurban networks. While such an approach has provided a valuable heuristic for understanding how cities are globally connected, and how the global economy can be conceived of as a network of cities, there is a lack of understanding as to how and why cities are connected, and which factors contribute to the existence of ties between cities. Here, we explain how five distinct socio-spatial dimensions contribute to global city network structure through their diverse effects on interurban dyads. Based on data from 13,583 multinational firms with 163,821 international subsidiary locations drawn from 208 global securities exchanges, we hypothesise how regional, linguistic, industrial, developmental, and command &amp; control relations may contribute to network structure. We then test these by applying an exponential random graph model (ERGM) to explain how each dimension may contribute to cities’ embeddedness within the overall network. Though all are shown to shape interurban relations to some extent, we find that two cities sharing a common industrial base are more likely to be connected. The ERGM also reveals a strong core-periphery structure in that cities in middle- and low-income countries are more reliant on connectivity than those in high-income countries. Our findings indicate that, despite claims seeking to de-emphasise the top-heavy organisational structure of the global urban economic network, interurban relations are characterised by uneven global development in which socio-spatial embeddedness manifests through a combination of similarity (homophily) and difference (heterophily) as determined by heterogeneous power relationships underlying global systems of production, exchange and consumption."
https://openalex.org/W3193398217,"Serum biomarkers are associated with hemorrhagic transformation and brain edema after cerebral infarction. However, whether serum biomarkers predict hemorrhagic transformation in large vessel occlusion stroke even after mechanical thrombectomy, which has become widely used, remains uncertain. In this prospective study, we enrolled patients with large vessel occlusion stroke in the anterior circulation. We analyzed 91 patients with serum samples obtained on admission. The levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), amyloid precursor protein (APP) 770, endothelin-1, S100B, and claudin-5 were measured. We examined the association between serum biomarkers and hemorrhagic transformation within one week. Fifty-four patients underwent mechanical thrombectomy, and 17 patients developed relevant hemorrhagic transformation (rHT, defined as hemorrhagic changes ≥ hemorrhagic infarction type 2). Neither MMP-9 (no rHT: 46 ± 48 vs. rHT: 15 ± 4 ng/mL, P = 0.30), APP770 (80 ± 31 vs. 85 ± 8 ng/mL, P = 0.53), endothelin-1 (7.0 ± 25.7 vs. 2.0 ± 2.1 pg/mL, P = 0.42), S100B (13 ± 42 vs. 12 ± 15 pg/mL, P = 0.97), nor claudin-5 (1.7 ± 2.3 vs. 1.9 ± 1.5 ng/mL, P = 0.68) levels on admission were associated with subsequent rHT. When limited to patients who underwent mechanical thrombectomy, the level of claudin-5 was higher in patients with rHT than in those without (1.2 ± 1.0 vs. 2.1 ± 1.7 ng/mL, P = 0.0181). APP770 levels were marginally higher in patients with a midline shift ≥ 5 mm than in those without (79 ± 29 vs. 97 ± 41 ng/mL, P = 0.084). The predictive role of serum biomarkers has to be reexamined in the mechanical thrombectomy era because some previously reported serum biomarkers may not predict hemorrhagic transformation, whereas the level of APP770 may be useful for predicting brain edema."

The World Health Organization has recommended HIV self-testing (HIVST) as an additional strategic HIV service. However, HIVST has not been fully endorsed and implemented in many countries in Southeast Asia. The aim of this study was to assess the uptake of oral fluid-based HIVST in MSM and TGW populations in Thailand.During 2017 and 2018, we conducted a cross-sectional study using convenience sampling to enroll 2,524 participants from three major urban areas. Participants were recruited during outreach and online activities and were offered unassisted or assisted HIVST, or referral to HIV testing services. A descriptive analysis was performed for summarizing data.A total of 2,502 participants (1,422 MSM and 1,082 TGW) were included in the analysis with about one-third (36.1%) of them being first-time testers. Among all participants enrolled in the study, a total of 2,486 participants (99.3%) selected HIVST versus referral to HIV testing services. Of those who selected HIVST, 2,095 (84.3%) opted for assisted HIVST while the rest opted for unassisted HIVST: 1,148 of 1,411 MSM (81.4%) and 947 of 1,075 TGW (88.1%) selected assisted HIVST. While no serious adverse events were reported during the study, we found that among 179 participants who needed a confirmatory test and were referred to HIV testing services, 108 (60.3.4%) accessed these later services.This study demonstrated a high uptake of oral fluid-based HIVST among MSM and TGW populations in Thailand and that HIVST could be scaled up through the national epidemic control program. However, a better understanding of HIV testing-seeking behavior and innovative follow-up solutions are needed to improve and monitor linkages to services for people who undertake HIVST."
https://openalex.org/W3194079888,"Pathogen populations in estuarine areas are dynamic, as they are subject to multiple natural and anthropogenic challenges. Heavy rainfall events bring instability to the aquatic environment in estuaries, causing changes in pathogen populations and increased environmental sanitation and public health concerns. In this study, we investigated the effects of heavy precipitation on the occurrence of pathogens in the Puzi River estuary, which is adjacent to the largest inshore oyster farming area in Taiwan. Our results indicated that Vibrio parahaemolyticus and adenovirus were the most frequently detected pathogens in the area. There was a significant difference (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.01) in water quality parameters, including total coliform, Escherichia coli, water temperature, turbidity, salinity, and dissolved oxygen, between groups with and without V. parahaemolyticus. In addition, the detection rate was negatively correlated with the average daily rainfall (r2 > 0.8). There was no significant difference between water quality parameters and the presence/absence of adenovirus, but a positive correlation was observed between the average daily rainfall and the detection rate of adenovirus (r2 ≥ 0.75). We conclude that heavy precipitation changes estuarine water quality, causing variations in microbial composition, including pathogens. As extreme weather events become more frequent due to climate change, the potential impacts of severe weather events on estuarine environments require further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3194160171,"Electromyography (EMG) is a simple, non-invasive, and cost-effective technology for measuring muscle activity. However, multi-muscle EMG is also a noisy, complex, and high-dimensional signal. It has nevertheless been widely used in a host of human-machine-interface applications (electrical wheelchairs, virtual computer mice, prosthesis, robotic fingers, etc.) and, in particular, to measure the reach-and-grasp motions of the human hand. Here, we developed an automated pipeline to predict object weight in a reach-grasp-lift task from an open dataset, relying only on EMG data. In doing so, we shifted the focus from manual feature-engineering to automated feature-extraction by using pre-processed EMG signals and thus letting the algorithms select the features. We further compared intrinsic EMG features, derived from several dimensionality-reduction methods, and then ran several classification algorithms on these low-dimensional representations. We found that the Laplacian Eigenmap algorithm generally outperformed other dimensionality-reduction methods. What is more, optimal classification accuracy was achieved using a combination of Laplacian Eigenmaps (simple-minded) and k-Nearest Neighbors (88% F1 score for 3-way classification). Our results, using EMG alone, are comparable to other researchers’, who used EMG and EEG together, in the literature. A running-window analysis further suggests that our method captures information in the EMG signal quickly and remains stable throughout the time that subjects grasp and move the object."
https://openalex.org/W3194340979,"The timely detection of fall risk or balance impairment in older adults is transcendental because, based on a reliable diagnosis, clinical actions can be taken to prevent accidents. This study presents a statistical model to estimate the fall risk from the center of pressure (CoP) data.This study is a cross-sectional analysis from a cohort of community-dwelling older adults aged 60 and over living in Mexico City. CoP balance assessments were conducted in 414 older adults (72.2% females) with a mean age of 70.23 ± 6.68, using a modified and previously validated Wii Balance Board (MWBB) platform. From this information, 78 CoP indexes were calculated and analyzed. Multiple logistic regression models were fitted in order to estimate the relationship between balance alteration and the CoP indexes and other covariables.The CoP velocity index in the Antero-Posterior direction with open eyes (MVELAPOE) had the best value of area under the curve (AUC) to identify a balance alteration (0.714), and in the adjusted model, AUC was increased to 0.827. Older adults with their mean velocity higher than 14.24 mm/s had more risk of presenting a balance alteration than those below this value (OR (Odd Ratio) = 2.94, p<0.001, 95% C.I.(Confidence Interval) 1.68-5.15). Individuals with increased age and BMI were more likely to present a balance alteration (OR 1.17, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.12-1.23; OR 1.17, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.10-1.25). Contrary to what is reported in the literature, sex was not associated with presenting a balance alteration (p = 0.441, 95% C.I. 0.70-2.27).The proposed model had a discriminatory capacity higher than those estimated by similar means and resources to this research and was implemented in an embedded standalone system which is low-cost, portable, and easy-to-use, ideal for non-laboratory environments. The authors recommend using this technology to support and complement the clinical tools to attend to the serious public health problem represented by falls in older adults."
https://openalex.org/W3194444789,"Pathological mutations in Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT) protein cause retention of toxic polymers in the hepatocyte endoplasmic reticulum. The risk for cirrhosis in AAT deficiency is likely directly related to retention of these polymers within the liver. Polymers are classically identified on liver biopsy as inclusion bodies by periodic acid schiff staining after diastase treatment and immunohistochemistry. However, characterization of the polymer burden within a biopsy sample is limited to a semi-quantitative scale as described by a pathologist. Better methods to quantify polymer are needed to advance our understanding of pathogenesis of disease. Therefore, we developed a method to quantify polymer aggregation from standard histologic specimens. In addition, we sought to understand the relationship of polymer burden and other histologic findings to the presence of liver fibrosis.Liver samples from a well-categorized AATD cohort were used to develop histo-morphometric tools to measure protein aggregation.Whole-slide morphometry reliably quantifies aggregates in AATD individuals. Despite very low levels of inclusions present (0-0.41%), accumulation of globules is not linear and is associated with higher fibrosis stages. Immunohistochemistry demonstrates that fibrosis is associated with polymer accumulation and not total AAT. A proportion of patients were found to be ""heavy accumulators"" with a polymer burden above the upper 25% of normal distribution. Males had significantly more liver inclusions and polymer than females. These measurements also highlight interrelated phenotypes of hepatocellular degeneration and autophagy in AATD liver disease.Quantitative inclusion analysis measures AAT accumulation in liver biopsy specimens. Quantification of polymer may identify individuals at risk for progressive disease and candidates for therapeutic interventions. Furthermore, these methods may be useful for evaluating efficacy of drugs targeting accumulation of AAT."
https://openalex.org/W3195325013,"Quantitative analysis of computed tomography (CT) radiomic features is an indirect measure of tumor heterogeneity, which has been associated with prognosis in human lung carcinoma. Canine lung tumors share similar features to human lung tumors and serve as a model in which to investigate the utility of radiomic features in differentiating tumor type and prognostication. The purpose of this study was to correlate first-order radiomic features from canine pulmonary tumors to histopathologic characteristics and outcome. Disease-free survival, overall survival time and tumor-specific survival were calculated as days from the date of CT scan. Sixty-seven tumors from 65 dogs were evaluated. Fifty-six tumors were classified as primary pulmonary adenocarcinomas and 11 were non-adenocarcinomas. All dogs were treated with surgical resection; 14 dogs received adjuvant chemotherapy. Second opinion histopathology in 63 tumors confirmed the histologic diagnosis in all dogs and further characterized 53 adenocarcinomas. The median overall survival time was longer (p = 0.004) for adenocarcinomas (339d) compared to non-adenocarcinomas (55d). There was wide variation in first-order radiomic statistics across tumors. Mean Hounsfield units (HU) ratio (p = 0.042) and median mean HU ratio (p = 0.042) were higher in adenocarcinomas than in non-adenocarcinomas. For dogs with adenocarcinoma, completeness of excision was associated with overall survival (p<0.001) while higher mitotic index (p = 0.007) and histologic score (p = 0.037) were associated with shorter disease-free survival. CT-derived tumor variables prognostic for outcome included volume, maximum axial diameter, and four radiomic features: integral total, integral total mean ratio, total HU, and max mean HU ratio. Tumor volume was also significantly associated with tumor invasion (p = 0.044). Further study of radiomic features in canine lung tumors is warranted as a method to non-invasively interrogate CT images for potential predictive and prognostic utility."
https://openalex.org/W3163328215,"Educational success is associated with greater quality of life and depends, in part, on heritable cognitive and non-cognitive traits. We used polygenic scores (PGS) for smoking and educational attainment to examine different genetic influences on facets of academic adjustment in adolescence and educational attainment in adulthood. PGSs were calculated for participants of the Minnesota Twin Family Study ( N = 3225) and included as predictors of grades, academic motivation, and discipline problems at ages 11, 14, and 17 years-old, cigarettes per day from ages 14 to 24 years old, and educational attainment in adulthood (mean age 29.4 years). Smoking and educational attainment PGSs had significant incremental associations with each academic variable and cigarettes per day. About half of the adjusted effects of the smoking and education PGSs on educational attainment in adulthood were mediated by the academic variables in adolescence. Cigarettes per day from ages 14 to 24 years old did not account for the effect of the smoking PGS on educational attainment, suggesting the smoking PGS indexes genetic influences related to general behavioral disinhibition. In sum, distinct genetic influences measured by the smoking and educational attainment PGSs contribute to academic adjustment in adolescence and educational attainment in adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W3193581952,"Objectives Kidney transplant (KTx) recipients with IgAN as primary disease, were compared with recipients with other causes of renal failure, in terms of long-term outcomes. Methods Ninety-nine KTx recipients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) due to IgAN, were retrospectively compared to; i/ a matched case-control group of patients with non-glomerular causes of ESKD, and ii/ four control groups with ESKD due to glomerular diseases; 44 patients with primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), 19 with idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN), 22 with lupus nephritis (LN) and 21 with pauci-immune glomerulonephritis (PIGN). Results At end of the observation period, graft function and survival, were similar between KTx recipients with IgAN and all other groups, but the rate of disease recurrence in the graft differed significantly across groups. The rate of IgAN recurrence in the graft was 23.2%, compared to 59.1% (p&lt;0.0001) in the FSGS group, 42.1% (p = 0.17) in the IMN group, and 0% in the LN and PIGN groups (p = 0.01). IgAN recipients, who were maintained with a regimen containing tacrolimus, experienced recurrence less frequently, compared to those maintained with cyclosporine (p = 0.01). Graft loss attributed to recurrence was significantly higher in patients with FSGS versus all others. Conclusion Recipients with IgAN as primary disease, experienced outcomes comparable to those of recipients with other causes of ESKD. The rate of IgAN recurrence in the graft was significantly lower than the rate of FSGS recurrence, but higher than the one recorded in recipients with LN or PIGN. Tacrolimus, as part of the KTx maintenance therapy, was associated with lower rates of IgAN recurrence in the graft, compared to the rate cyclosporine."
https://openalex.org/W3194053934,"Skills Management is an essential concept of human resource management in which a skill inventory may be created for each employee and managers can assign tasks to workers based on worker's abilities. This concept is not fully practiced for two reasons: i) employee's skills are not effectively evaluated and documented, ii) tool support is deficient to manage this complex task. Ineffective skill management of an organization fizzle tasks assigned to the incompetent employees and this may lead to project failure. To fill up this gap, a survey is conducted across various software organizations to find out the best practices for the skill management and to gather requirements for skills management framework. Based on survey findings, a mathematical framework is proposed that calculates the soft and hard skills of employees automatically based on time and achievements as skill increases or decreases over time. In this framework, the Skills Calculation Engine (SCE) is developed for the managers to enhance the capacity of appropriate decisions making in assigning tasks to the rightly skilled workers. This framework is also useful for organizations as it can increase profitability as tasks are assigned to the most appropriate employees. The SCE is implemented as a Windows-based application to calculate skills, store skills in skills inventory, and assign tasks based on an employee's skills. The skills management tool is evaluated in a facilitated workshop; furthermore, a feature-wise comparison of the tool is also made with existing tools."
https://openalex.org/W3195825211,"Most National Parks (NP) and nature reserves in Rwanda have been established opportunistically in the early 1900s, without clear consideration of ensuring the protection to all threatened different taxonomical or functional groups, such as vegetation, invertebrates, fish, and birds. With the increasing conservation objectives, raised expectations into Protected Areas (PA), and within a more challenging environmental context, it is important to identify biodiversity hubs and key areas for Ecosystem Services (ES) to maximize the efficiency of conservation efforts by assisting priority areas under threats. To date, no comprehensive analysis, to the best of our knowledge has been done to assess both biodiversity and ES in Rwanda. This is a notable gap, considering that global-scale research suggests that the spatial overlap between biodiversity targets and ES is low. This study reports a nationwide assessment, mapping the richness of threatened species and three key ES Carbon Storage, Water Quantity, and Water Quality. Our analysis has shown that PAs are neither perfectly delineated to protect biodiversity nor key ES. The state of PAs offers a taxonomic protection bias in favor of mammals and birds but leaves many endangered species in other taxonomic groups in collapsing and unprotected small ecosystems scattered around the country. Rwanda’s PAs cover important carbon stock but can do better at securing higher water balance regions and clean water sources. We propose an improvement of the NP system in Rwanda to help guide the economic development along a path of green growth and ensures the well-being of both people and nature. Locating biodiversity hubs and key ES can help to connect conservationists, local people, and governments in order to better guide conservation actions."
https://openalex.org/W3195948202,"Cassava ( Manihot esculenta Crantz.) has been a vital staple and food security crop in Tanzania for several centuries, and it is likely that its resilience will play a key role in mitigating livelihood insecurities arising from climate change. The sector is dominated by smallholder farmers growing traditional landrace varieties. A recent surge in virus diseases and awareness in the commercial potential of cassava has prompted a drive to disseminate improved varieties in the country. These factors however also threaten the existence of landraces and associated farmer knowledge. It is important that the landraces are conserved and utilized as the adaptive gene complexes they harbor can drive breeding for improved varieties that meet agro-ecological adaptation as well as farmer and consumer needs, thereby improving adoption rates. Here we report on cassava germplasm collection missions and documentation of farmer knowledge in seven zones of Tanzania. A total of 277 unique landraces are identified through high-density genotyping. The large number of landraces is attributable to a mixed clonal/sexual reproductive system in which the soil seed bank and incorporation of seedlings plays an important role. A striking divergence in genetic relationships between the coastal regions and western regions is evident and explained by (i) independent introductions of cassava into the country, (ii) adaptation to prevailing agro-ecological conditions and (iii) farmer selections according to the intended use or market demands. The main uses of cassava with different product profiles are evident, including fresh consumption, flour production, dual purpose incorporating both these uses and longer-term food security. Each of these products have different trait requirements. Individual landraces were not widely distributed across the country with limited farmer-to-farmer diffusion with implications for seed systems."
https://openalex.org/W3193357939,"Change-point detection in health care data has recently obtained considerable attention due to the increased availability of complex data in real-time. In many applications, the observed data is an ordinal time series. Two kinds of test statistics are proposed to detect the structural change of cumulative logistic regression model, which is often used in applications for the analysis of ordinal time series. One is the standardized efficient score vector, the other one is the quadratic form of the efficient score vector with a weight function. Under the null hypothesis, we derive the asymptotic distribution of the two test statistics, and prove the consistency under the alternative hypothesis. We also study the consistency of the change-point estimator, and a binary segmentation procedure is suggested for estimating the locations of possible multiple change-points. Simulation results show that the former statistic performs better when the change-point occurs at the centre of the data, but the latter is preferable when the change-point occurs at the beginning or end of the data. Furthermore, the former statistic could find the reason for rejecting the null hypothesis. Finally, we apply the two test statistics to a group of sleep data, the results show that there exists a structural change in the data."
https://openalex.org/W3193464667,"Pharmacological blood pressure (BP) intervention for high blood pressure is controversial for a wide spectrum of hypertensive crisis in the emergency department (ED). We evaluated whether medical control of BP altered the short- and long-term outcomes among patients with hypertensive crisis who were discharged from the ED under universal health care. This retrospective cohort comprised 22 906 adults discharged from the ED of a tertiary hospital with initial systolic BP ≥ 180 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥ 120 mmHg between 2010 and 2016. The main exposure was the use of antihypertensive medication during the ED stay. Clinical endpoints were revisits to the ED or inpatient admission (at 7, 30, and 60 days), cardiovascular mortality (at 1, 3, and 5 years), and incident stroke (at 1, 3, and 5 years). The associations between pharmacological intervention for BP and outcomes were evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional-hazards models. Of the patient data analyzed, 72.2% were not treated pharmacologically and 68.4% underwent evaluation of end-organ damage. Pharmacological intervention for BP was significantly associated with a 11% and 11% reduced risk of hospital revisits within 30 or 60 days of discharge from ED, respectively, particularly among patients with polypharmacy. No association between pharmacological intervention for BP and incident stroke and cardiovascular mortality was observed. A revision of diagnostic criteria for hypertensive crisis is essential. Although pharmacological intervention for BP may not alter the long-term risk of cardiovascular mortality, it significantly reduces short-term health care utilization."
https://openalex.org/W3194135274,"The geosynthetic-reinforced pile-supported embankment (GRPSE) system has been widely used in road construction on soft soil. However, the application of the GRPSE system is often restricted by its high-cost. The reason is that they are designed for bearing control as defined in the past. During the construction process, the pile spacing is reduced to meet the requirements for the embankment bearing capacity and settlement. These factors cause the membrane effect to not be exploited. As a result, the utilization efficiency of the bearing capacity of the soil between the piles is low and the project cost is high. Therefore, in order to solve the problem of insufficient bearing capacity of soil between piles, we established a settlement calculation model of soil between piles based on membrane effect. The model considers the relationship between the geosynthetic reinforcement (GR) and the pile spacing. Based on the obtained model, a method for optimizing the soil bearing capacity of GRPSEs is proposed. By controlling the settlement of soil between piles, the bearing capacity of soil between piles and the membrane effect of embankment can be fully utilized. Therefore, the project cost can be reduced. Finally, the method is applied to field tests for comparison. The results show that the method is reasonable and applicable. This method can effectively exploit the membrane effect and improve the utilization efficiency of the bearing capacity of the soil between piles. An economical and reasonable arrangement scheme for the piles and GR was obtained. This scheme can not only ensure the safety of the project, but also fully utilize the bearing capacity of the soil between the piles and provide a new method for engineering design."
https://openalex.org/W3194707033,"Human activities and regional-scale climate variability drive changes in the ecology of coastal and marine ecosystems. Ecological restoration has emerged as a best-management practice to combat habitat degradation and restore lost ecological functions. However, relatively short project monitoring timeframes have limited our understanding of the effects of interannual climate cycles on water quality and restoration dynamics. We collected measurements on a 23-ha oyster reef constructed in the Gulf of Mexico to determine the relationship between El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-driven climate variability and local salinity patterns, and to evaluate the effects of this climate variability and salinity on oyster population dynamics and faunal community composition over a medium-term (five-year) timeframe. The role of ENSO-driven climate variability on local salinity patterns (primarily from changes in precipitation and evaporation) and faunal dynamics was investigated using the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI). Salinity was negatively correlated with ONI with an approximately 4-month lag. Higher ONI values (El Niño periods) were followed by reductions in salinity, increases in oyster recruitment and density, and reductions in resident motile fauna density and species richness. Lower ONI values (La Niña periods) had higher and less variable salinities, and higher areal coverage of restoration substrates by large oysters. ENSO-driven salinity reductions in the second year after reef construction coincided with a shift in resident motile faunal community composition that was maintained despite a second strong salinity reduction in year 5. Our results indicate that it is important to expand the typical monitoring timeframes to at least five years so that resource managers and restoration practitioners can better understand how both short-term environmental variability and longer-term climate cycles can affect the outcomes of restoration actions."
https://openalex.org/W3194905838,"Background Women who start using contraception (“adopters”) are a key population for family planning goals, but little is known about characteristics that predict the adoption of contraception as opposed to current use. We used prospective data from women and facilities for five countries, (Democratic Republic of Congo, India, Kenya, Nigeria, and Burkina Faso) and identified baseline characteristics that predicted adoption of modern contraception in the short term. Methods We used data from the Performance Monitoring for Action (PMA) Agile Project. PMA Agile administered service delivery point (SDP) client exit interview (CEI) surveys in urban sites of these five countries. Female clients responding to the CEI were asked for phone numbers that were used for a phone follow-up survey approximately four months later. For our analysis, we used data from the SDP and CEI baseline surveys, and the phone follow up to compare women who start using contraception during this period with those who remain non-users. We used characteristics of the facility and the woman at baseline to predict her contraception adoption in the future. Results Discussing FP with a partner at baseline was associated with greater odds of adoption in DRC (OR 2.34; 95% CI 0.97–5.66), India (OR 2.27; 95% CI 1.05–4.93), and Kenya (OR 1.65; 95% CI 1.16–2.35). Women who discussed family planning with any staff member at the health facility had 1.72 greater odds (95% CI 1.13–2.67) of becoming an adopter in Nigeria. The odds of adoption were lower in Nigerian facilities that had a stockout (OR 0.66 95% CI 0.44–1.00) at baseline. Other characteristics associated with contraception adoption across settings were education, age, wealth, parity, and marital status. Conclusions Characteristics of both the woman and the health facility were associated with adoption of modern contraception in the future. Some characteristics, like discussing family planning with a spouse, education, and parity, were associated with contraceptive adoption across settings. Other characteristics that predict contraceptive use, such as health facility measures, varied across countries."

Two hundred and four fecal samples were collected from different forest areas in the municipalities of Ilhéus, Una, Belmonte, and Mascote. Identifications were performed using PCR and nested PCR followed by sequencing of the gdh and tpi genes for G. duodenalis, and the gp60 and Hsp-70 genes for Cryptosporidium. The total frequency of positive PCR samples for both G. duodenalis and Cryptosporidium spp. was 5.4% (11/204). Giardia duodenalis occurred in 2.94% (4/136) of rodents and 2.94% (2/68) of marsupials. The prevalence of Cryptosporidium in rodents and marsupials was 1.47% (2/136) and 4.41% (3/68), respectively. In the areas sampled, the frequency of parasitism was 50% (7/14), while the Mascote region alone had no parasitized animals. The G. duodenalis subgenotype AI was identified in the rodent species Hylaeamys laticeps, Oecomys catherinae, Oligoryzomys nigripes and Akodon cursor, and in the marsupials Gracilinanus agilis and Monodelphis americana. In the rodents Rhipidomys mastacalis, H. laticeps and in the marsupial Marmosa murina the protozoa Cryptosporidium fayeri, Cryptosporidium parvum and Cryptosporidium ubiquitum with subtypes IIa and IVg by the gp60 gene were found. In conclusion, this study provides the genetic characterization of Giardia and Cryptosporidium species and genotypes in rodents and marsupials. And, these findings reinforce that the rodent and marsupial species mentioned above play a role as new hosts for Giardia and Cryptosporidium."

Neonatal deaths (0-27 days) with perinatal asphyxia were defined as intrauterine hypoxia, birth asphyxia or meconium aspiration syndrome written in any line of the Death Certificate. Geoprocessing analytical approach included detection of first order effects through quintiles and spatial moving average maps, followed by second order effects by global and local spatial autocorrelation (Moran and LISA, respectively) before and after smoothing with local Bayesian estimates. Finally, Spearman correlation was applied between asphyxia-associated neonatal mortality and mean per capita GDP rates for the municipalities with significant LISA.There were 6,713 asphyxia-associated neonatal deaths among 5,949,267 live births (rate: 1.13/1000) in SP. Spatial moving average maps showed a non-random distribution among municipalities, with presence of clusters (I = 0.048; p = 0.023). LISA map identified clusters of asphyxia-associated neonatal mortality in the south, southeast and northwest. After applying local Bayes estimates, clusters were more pronounced (I = 0.589; p = 0.001). There was a partial overlap of the areas of higher asphyxia-associated neonatal mortality and lower mean per capita GDP.Spatial analysis identified cluster areas of high asphyxia-associated neonatal mortality and low per capita GDP rates, with a significant negative correlation. This optimized, structured, and hierarchical approach to identify high-risk areas of cause-specific neonatal mortality may be helpful for guiding public health efforts to decrease neonatal mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3193662951,"To assess trends in life expectancy and the contribution of specific causes of death to Native American-White longevity gaps in the Four Corners states, we used death records from the National Center for Health Statistics and population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau from 1999-2017 to generate period life tables and decompose racial gaps in life expectancy. Native American-White life expectancy gaps narrowed between 2001 and 2012 but widened thereafter, reaching 4.92 years among males and 2.06 years among females in 2015. The life expectancy disadvantage among Native American males was primarily attributable to motor vehicle accidents (0.96 years), liver disease (1.22 years), and diabetes (0.78 years). These causes of deaths were also primary contributors to the gap among females, forming three successive waves of mortality that occurred in young adulthood, midlife, and late adulthood, respectively, among Native American males and females. Interventions to reduce motor vehicle accidents in early adulthood, alcohol-related mortality in midlife, and diabetes complications at older ages could reduce Native American-White longevity disparities in the Four Corners states."

Celecoxib attenuated hypercholesterolaemia associated with CCl 4 -induced hepatic injury in rats without improving liver function in our previous study. This present study investigated the lipid lowering potential of celecoxib in normal rats fed with coconut oil subjected to five deep-frying episodes. Male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned to groups (n = 6 rats/group) which received physiological saline (10 mL/kg), unheated coconut oil (UO, 10 mL/kg) or heated coconut oil (HO, 10 ml/kg) for 60 days. Groups that received HO were subsequently treated with either physiological saline, atorvastatin (25 mg/kg), celecoxib (5 mg/kg) or celecoxib (10 mg/kg) in the last fifteen days of the experiment. Rats were sacrificed 24 hours after last treatment and blood and tissue samples collected for analysis. HO consumption produced significant hyperlipidaemia and elevation in marker enzymes of hepatic function. Celecoxib ameliorated the hyperlipidaemia as shown by the significantly (P&lt;0.05) lower total cholesterol, triglycerides, low and very low density lipoprotein in the celecoxib-treated rats when compared with HO-fed rats that received saline. Celecoxib also reduced (P&lt;0.05) alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and liver weight of hyperlipidaemic rats. Similarly, hepatocellular damage with the hyperlipidaemia was significantly reversed by celecoxib. However, serum TNF-α and IL-6 did not change significantly between the various groups. Taken together, data from this study suggest that celecoxib may exert therapeutic benefit in hyperlipidaemia and its attendant consequences."
https://openalex.org/W3193755743,"Large-scale excavations conducted by Smithsonian Institution archaeologists and avocational archaeologists during the 1960s and 1970s at three sites in Seaside, Oregon, resulted in the recovery of a diverse range of material culture curated by multiple institutions. One site, known as Palmrose (35CLT47), provides compelling evidence for the presence of one of the earliest examples of a rectangular plank house along the Oregon Coast. Previous research suggests habitation of the Palmrose site occurred between 2340 cal BC to cal AD 640. However, recent research highlights significant chronometric hygiene concerns of previously reported radiocarbon dates for the Seaside area, calling into question broader regional chronologies. This paper presents a revised chronology for the Palmrose site based on 12 new accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dates of ancient cervid bones. I evaluate these new dates and previously reported radiocarbon dates from the site, applying chronometric hygiene assessments and Bayesian statistics to build a refined chronology for the Palmrose site. Calibration of the 12 AMS radiocarbon dates suggests an initial occupation range from 345−55 cal BC and a terminal occupation range from cal AD 225−340−. Bayesian modeling of the Palmrose sequence suggests initial occupation may have spanned from 195−50 cal BC and the terminal occupation from cal AD 210−255 . Modeling suggests the maximum range of occupation may span from 580−55 cal BC to cal AD 210−300 based on the start and end boundary calculations. Bayesian modeling of radiocarbon dates directly associated with the plank house deposits suggests the plank house’s occupation may have spanned from 160−1 cal BC to cal AD 170−320 . The new radiocarbon dates significantly constrain the Palmrose habitation and alter regional chronologies."
https://openalex.org/W3194585656,"We examined the relationship between resource abundance and the feeding activity of phytophagous insects on three common island plants. The aim was to investigate the correlation between phytophagous insects' abundance and availability of food and island geography. We collected 30,835 leaves from three tree species groups (Mallotus japonicus, Prunus species, and Quercus species) on 18 islands in southwest Korea. The number of plant resources for herbivores varied: the number of leaves per shoot was the highest in Mallotus, leaf weight and the water content per leaf was significantly lower in Quercus species. External feeding was higher for Prunus and Quercus species, whereas the internal feeding type was significantly higher for Quercus species. Geography (area and distance), elevation and food resource (elevation, number of plant species, and the forest cover rate) had a variable effect on phytophagous insects feeding activities: distance and the number of plant species were more explainable to the external feeding guild. In contrast, area and forest cover were more to the internal feeding guild."
https://openalex.org/W3195322146,"Bariatric surgery (BS) might be a nephroprotective treatment in obese patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the non-linear relation between body surface area (BSA) and extracellular fluid volume (ECFV) in obese people raises the question of the most relevant way to scale glomerular filtration rate (GFR) for assessing renal function changes after BS.We screened 1774 BS candidates and analysed 10 consecutive participants with CKD stage 3. True GFR (mGFR), measured by the renal clearance of 51Cr-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), was scaled either to BSA (mGFRBSA) or to ECFV measured by 51Cr-EDTA distribution volume (mGFRECFV) before and one year after BS.The 10 candidates for BS had a mean body mass index of 43.3 ± 3.6 kg/m2 and a mean GFR of 48 ± 8 mL/min/1.73 m2. Six participants had a sleeve gastrectomy and four had a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. One year after BS, ECFV decreased (23.2 ± 6.2 to 17.9 ± 4.3 L, p = 0.001), absolute mGFR was not significantly modified (74 ± 23 versus 68 ±19 mL/min), mGFRBSA did not change significantly (53 ± 18 versus 56 ± 17 mL/min/1.73 m2) whereas mGFRECFV significantly increased (42 ± 13 versus 50 ± 14 mL/min/12.9 L, p = 0.037). The relation between mGFRECFV and mGFRBSA was different from the identity line before (p = 0.014) but not after BS (p = 0.09).There is a difference between mGFRBSA and mGFRECFV following BS and the latter might better reflect the adequacy between renal function and corpulence."
https://openalex.org/W3195597647,"Objective In stroke survivors, a treatment-resistant problem is inability to volitionally differentiate upper limb wrist extension versus flexion. When one intends to extend the wrist, the opposite occurs, wrist flexion, rendering the limb non-functional. Conventional therapeutic approaches have had limited success in achieving functional recovery of patients with chronic and severe upper extremity impairments. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neurofeedback is an emerging strategy that has shown potential for stroke rehabilitation. There is a lack of information regarding unique blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) cortical activations uniquely controlling execution of wrist extension versus uniquely controlling wrist flexion. Therefore, a first step in providing accurate neural feedback and training to the stroke survivor is to determine the feasibility of classifying (or differentiating) brain activity uniquely associated with wrist extension from that of wrist flexion, first in healthy adults. Approach We studied brain signal of 10 healthy adults, who performed wrist extension and wrist flexion during fMRI data acquisition. We selected four types of analyses to study the feasibility of differentiating brain signal driving wrist extension versus wrist flexion, as follows: 1) general linear model (GLM) analysis; 2) support vector machine (SVM) classification; 3) ‘Winner Take All’; and 4) Relative Dominance. Results With these four methods and our data, we found that few voxels were uniquely active during either wrist extension or wrist flexion. SVM resulted in only minimal classification accuracies. There was no significant difference in activation magnitude between wrist extension versus flexion; however, clusters of voxels showed extension signal &gt; flexion signal and other clusters vice versa. Spatial patterns of activation differed among subjects. Significance We encountered a number of obstacles to obtaining clear group results in healthy adults. These obstacles included the following: high variability across healthy adults in all measures studied; close proximity of uniquely active voxels to voxels that were common to both the extension and flexion movements; in general, higher magnitude of signal for the voxels common to both movements versus the magnitude of any given uniquely active voxel for one type of movement. Our results indicate that greater precision in imaging will be required to develop a truly effective method for differentiating wrist extension versus wrist flexion from fMRI data."

https://openalex.org/W3196262700,"Several studies have evaluated the effects of high-intensity aerobic training (HIAT) on pain severity and quality of life (QoL) among women with primary dysmenorrhea. However, to date, no studies have evaluated the effectiveness of HIAT on academic performance or absenteeism or examined the cost-effectiveness of HIAT relative to other treatments in women with primary dysmenorrhea. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying aerobic exercise-induced analgesia in primary dysmenorrhea remain unclear. The objectives of this study are to: (1) evaluate the effects of HIAT on absenteeism and academic performance among university students, (2) identify the underlying mechanisms associated with aerobic exercise-induced analgesia in primary dysmenorrhea, and (3) determine the cost-effectiveness of HIAT compared with a wait-list control (WLC) group receiving usual care.A sequential, embedded, mixed-methods study design, including a crossover, randomised controlled trial (RCT) and semi-structured focus groups, will be conducted alongside an economic evaluation. A total of 130 women aged 18-24 years will be randomised into either HIAT (n = 65) or wait-list control (n = 65) groups. Primary outcomes will include average pain intensity, absenteeism from university, and academic performance. Primary mediators will include salivary progesterone and prostaglandin F2α levels. Outcome and meditator variables will be assessed at baseline and post-treatment, at 12 and 28 weeks. An economic analysis will be conducted from the societal and healthcare perspective of Hong Kong. Semi-structured focus groups will be conducted at 32 weeks. Of the 130 participants included in the RCT, 70 will be included in the focus groups.All statistical analyses will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis, using SPSS (version 24). Preliminary analysis using an independent samples t-test and a two-sided, unpaired Student's t-test will be performed to exclude carryover effects and identify within-participant differences in outcome variables between the study periods, respectively. Treatment effects will be evaluated using analysis of variance via a mixed-effects model with fixed effects for intervention, period, and sequence. In all models, random effects will include the participants nested within the sequence as a sampling cluster. The mediation effects will be assessed using the Sobel test. The EQ-5D responses will be converted into utility scores to estimate the gain or loss of quality-adjusted life-years. Seemingly unrelated regression analyses will be used to estimate the total cost differences and effect differences. Qualitative data will be analysed using the process of thematic analysis."

https://openalex.org/W3196165183,"VhCBP is a periplasmic chitooligosaccharide-binding protein mainly responsible for translocation of the chitooligosaccharide (GlcNAc)2 across the double membranes of marine bacteria. However, structural and thermodynamic understanding of the sugar-binding/-release processes of VhCBP is relatively less. VhCBP displayed the greatest affinity toward (GlcNAc)2, with lower affinity for longer-chain chitooligosaccharides [(GlcNAc)3-4]. (GlcNAc)4 partially occupied the closed sugar-binding groove, with two reducing-end GlcNAc units extending beyond the sugar-binding groove and barely characterized by weak electron density. Mutation of three conserved residues (Trp363, Asp365, and Trp513) to Ala resulted in drastic decreases in the binding affinity toward the preferred substrate (GlcNAc)2, indicating their significant contributions to sugar binding. The structure of the W513A-(GlcNAc)2 complex in a 'half-open' conformation unveiled the intermediary step of the (GlcNAc)2 translocation from the soluble CBP in the periplasm to the inner membrane-transporting components. Isothermal calorimetry data suggested that VhCBP adopts the high-affinity conformation to bind (GlcNAc)2, while its low-affinity conformation facilitated sugar release. Thus, chitooligosaccharide translocation, conferred by periplasmic VhCBP, is a crucial step in the chitin catabolic pathway, allowing Vibrio bacteria to thrive in oceans where chitin is their major source of nutrients."
