https://openalex.org/W1976302032,"B cells can secrete IL-35 upon activation, and subsequently contribute negatively to the regulation of immunity, such as T-cell-mediated autoimmunity or anti-microbial immunity, and a characterization of these cells raises new questions about possible independent roles for IL-10- and IL-35-expressing plasma cells as regulatory cells. This study identifies interleukin-35 (IL-35)-producing B cells as novel negative regulators of immunity. Mice with B cells unable to produce IL-35 proved susceptible to induced autoimmune disease and at the same time showed increased resistance to Salmonella infection. This finding points to IL-35 production by B cells as a potential therapeutic target for autoimmune and infectious diseases. B lymphocytes have critical roles as positive and negative regulators of immunity. Their inhibitory function has been associated primarily with interleukin 10 (IL-10) because B-cell-derived IL-10 can protect against autoimmune disease and increase susceptibility to pathogens1,2. Here we identify IL-35-producing B cells as key players in the negative regulation of immunity. Mice in which only B cells did not express IL-35 lost their ability to recover from the T-cell-mediated demyelinating autoimmune disease experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In contrast, these mice displayed a markedly improved resistance to infection with the intracellular bacterial pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium as shown by their superior containment of the bacterial growth and their prolonged survival after primary infection, and upon secondary challenge, compared to control mice. The increased immunity found in mice lacking IL-35 production by B cells was associated with a higher activation of macrophages and inflammatory T cells, as well as an increased function of B cells as antigen-presenting cells (APCs). During Salmonella infection, IL-35- and IL-10-producing B cells corresponded to two largely distinct sets of surface-IgM+CD138hiTACI+CXCR4+CD1dintTim1int plasma cells expressing the transcription factor Blimp1 (also known as Prdm1). During EAE, CD138+ plasma cells were also the main source of B-cell-derived IL-35 and IL-10. Collectively, our data show the importance of IL-35-producing B cells in regulation of immunity and highlight IL-35 production by B cells as a potential therapeutic target for autoimmune and infectious diseases. This study reveals the central role of activated B cells, particularly plasma cells, and their production of cytokines in the regulation of immune responses in health and disease."

(p. 1360 , published online 27 February) developed a method of fluorescent in situ RNA sequencing (FISSEQ) that works in vivo to show messenger RNA localization within cells. The method amplifies complementary DNA targets by rolling circle amplification, and then in situ cross-linking locks amplicons to produce ample, highly localized templates for three-dimensional sequencing. The technique was tested in fibroblasts to reveal the differences between individual cells during wound repair."
https://openalex.org/W2011504521,"The hippocampus is critical for encoding declarative memory, our repository of knowledge of who, what, where and when. Mnemonic information is processed in the hippocampus through several parallel routes involving distinct subregions. In the classic trisynaptic pathway, information proceeds from entorhinal cortex (EC) to dentate gyrus to CA3 and then to CA1, the main hippocampal output. Genetic lesions of EC (ref. 3) and hippocampal dentate gyrus (ref. 4), CA3 (ref. 5) and CA1 (ref. 6) regions have revealed their distinct functions in learning and memory. In contrast, little is known about the role of CA2, a relatively small area interposed between CA3 and CA1 that forms the nexus of a powerful disynaptic circuit linking EC input with CA1 output. Here we report a novel transgenic mouse line that enabled us to selectively examine the synaptic connections and behavioural role of the CA2 region in adult mice. Genetically targeted inactivation of CA2 pyramidal neurons caused a pronounced loss of social memory--the ability of an animal to remember a conspecific--with no change in sociability or several other hippocampus-dependent behaviours, including spatial and contextual memory. These behavioural and anatomical results thus reveal CA2 as a critical hub of sociocognitive memory processing."

https://openalex.org/W2021868082,"The DNA-binding protein PfAP2-G is found to be a master regulator of sexual development in the malaria parasite; this protein appears to regulate early gametocytogenesis and is epigenetically silenced in the majority of blood-stage parasites. For malaria parasites to be transmitted to the mosquito vector they must undergo sexual development and produce gametocytes. The molecular mechanisms underlying the commitment to gametocyte development have been unclear. Two complementary manuscripts now show that AP2-G, a member of the apicomplexan AP2 family of transcription factors, is a master regulator of sexual development in the malaria parasite, acting as a developmental switch by triggering the transcription of early gametocyte genes. Abhinav Sinha et al. worked with the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei, and Björn Kafsack et al. with the human pathogen P. falciparum. AP2-G activity in human infectious malaria parasites could be a potential target for antimalarials designed to interfere with gametocyte formation. The life cycles of many parasites involve transitions between disparate host species, requiring these parasites to go through multiple developmental stages adapted to each of these specialized niches. Transmission of malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) from humans to the mosquito vector requires differentiation from asexual stages replicating within red blood cells into non-dividing male and female gametocytes. Although gametocytes were first described in 1880, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in commitment to gametocyte formation is extremely limited, and disrupting this critical developmental transition remains a long-standing goal1. Here we show that expression levels of the DNA-binding protein PfAP2-G correlate strongly with levels of gametocyte formation. Using independent forward and reverse genetics approaches, we demonstrate that PfAP2-G function is essential for parasite sexual differentiation. By combining genome-wide PfAP2-G cognate motif occurrence with global transcriptional changes resulting from PfAP2-G ablation, we identify early gametocyte genes as probable targets of PfAP2-G and show that their regulation by PfAP2-G is critical for their wild-type level expression. In the asexual blood-stage parasites pfap2-g appears to be among a set of epigenetically silenced loci2,3 prone to spontaneous activation4. Stochastic activation presents a simple mechanism for a low baseline of gametocyte production. Overall, these findings identify PfAP2-G as a master regulator of sexual-stage development in malaria parasites and mark the first discovery of a transcriptional switch controlling a differentiation decision in protozoan parasites."

https://openalex.org/W2094381221,"Malaria parasites must produce gametocytes for transmission to the mosquito vector, although the molecular mechanisms underlying commitment to gametocyte production remain unclear; here this process is found to be controlled by PbAP2-G, a member of the ApiAP2 family of DNA-binding proteins, in the rodent-infecting Plasmodium berghei parasite. For malaria parasites to be transmitted to the mosquito vector they must undergo sexual development and produce gametocytes. The molecular mechanisms underlying the commitment to gametocyte development have been unclear. Two complementary manuscripts now show that AP2-G, a member of the apicomplexan AP2 family of transcription factors, is a master regulator of sexual development in the malaria parasite, acting as a developmental switch by triggering the transcription of early gametocyte genes.

AP2-G activity in human infectious malaria parasites could be a potential target for antimalarials designed to interfere with gametocyte formation. Commitment to and completion of sexual development are essential for malaria parasites (protists of the genus Plasmodium) to be transmitted through mosquitoes1. The molecular mechanism(s) responsible for commitment have been hitherto unknown. Here we show that PbAP2-G, a conserved member of the apicomplexan AP2 (ApiAP2) family of DNA-binding proteins, is essential for the commitment of asexually replicating forms to sexual development in Plasmodium berghei, a malaria parasite of rodents. PbAP2-G was identified from mutations in its encoding gene, PBANKA_143750, which account for the loss of sexual development frequently observed in parasites transmitted artificially by blood passage. Systematic gene deletion of conserved ApiAP2 genes in Plasmodium confirmed the role of PbAP2-G and revealed a second ApiAP2 member (PBANKA_103430, here termed PbAP2-G2) that significantly modulates but does not abolish gametocytogenesis, indicating that a cascade of ApiAP2 proteins are involved in commitment to the production and maturation of gametocytes. The data suggest a mechanism of commitment to gametocytogenesis in Plasmodium consistent with a positive feedback loop involving PbAP2-G that could be exploited to prevent the transmission of this pernicious parasite."
https://openalex.org/W2002155693,"The NRT1/PTR family of proton-coupled transporters are responsible for nitrogen assimilation in eukaryotes and bacteria through the uptake of peptides. However, in most plant species members of this family have evolved to transport nitrate as well as additional secondary metabolites and hormones. In response to falling nitrate levels, NRT1.1 is phosphorylated on an intracellular threonine that switches the transporter from a low-affinity to high-affinity state. Here we present both the apo and nitrate-bound crystal structures of Arabidopsis thaliana NRT1.1, which together with in vitro binding and transport data identify a key role for His 356 in nitrate binding. Our data support a model whereby phosphorylation increases structural flexibility and in turn the rate of transport. Comparison with peptide transporters further reveals how the NRT1/PTR family has evolved to recognize diverse nitrogenous ligands, while maintaining elements of a conserved coupling mechanism within this superfamily of nutrient transporters. In Arabidopsis thaliana the phosphorylation state of the ‘dual affinity’ transporter, NRT1.1, allows the uptake of nitrate over a wide concentration range; the crystal structure and molecular basis for this is described in this study. Soil levels of nitrate, a primary nutrient for plant growth, can vary dramatically. Plants therefore need a versatile mechanism for obtaining nitrate from the environment. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the dual-affinity transporter NRT1.1 can take up nitrate across a broad range of concentrations, switching from low- to high-affinity mode according to the phosphorylation status of a key threonine residue. Two studies published in this issue of Nature describe the crystal structures of full-length NRT1.1, providing insights into how this post-translational modification switches the transporter between the low-affinity and high-affinity states."
https://openalex.org/W2056509081,"Using a combination of viral-tracing and in vivo imaging techniques, the authors show that there are several parallel pathways in the mouse visual system and that directional and orientation selectivity in the cortex may arise from the specialized tuning of retinal circuits. The motion-detecting cells of the retina, called direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs), have been known about and studied for more than half a century but their precise role in visual processing has remained unclear. Using a combination of genetic, anatomical and imaging techniques, Andrew Huberman and colleagues investigate the connections made by DSGCs in the mouse brain and find that they link specifically to neurons in the superficial layers of primary visual cortex. Inputs from several different DSGC types are combined to convey both directional and orientation information to the cortex. In addition, non-direction-tuned information from the retina is sent to deeper layers of cortex. This reveals that the mouse visual system contains several functionally distinct parallel pathways and that directional and orientation selectivity in the cortex may arise from the earliest stages of visual processing involving motion-detecting cells in the retina. How specific features in the environment are represented within the brain is an important unanswered question in neuroscience. A subset of retinal neurons, called direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs), are specialized for detecting motion along specific axes of the visual field1. Despite extensive study of the retinal circuitry that endows DSGCs with their unique tuning properties2,3, their downstream circuitry in the brain and thus their contribution to visual processing has remained unclear. In mice, several different types of DSGCs connect to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN)4,5,6, the visual thalamic structure that harbours cortical relay neurons. Whether direction-selective information computed at the level of the retina is routed to cortical circuits and integrated with other visual channels, however, is unknown. Here we show that there is a di-synaptic circuit linking DSGCs with the superficial layers of the primary visual cortex (V1) by using viral trans-synaptic circuit mapping7,8 and functional imaging of visually driven calcium signals in thalamocortical axons. This circuit pools information from several types of DSGCs, converges in a specialized subdivision of the dLGN, and delivers direction-tuned and orientation-tuned signals to superficial V1. Notably, this circuit is anatomically segregated from the retino-geniculo-cortical pathway carrying non-direction-tuned visual information to deeper layers of V1, such as layer 4. Thus, the mouse harbours several functionally specialized, parallel retino-geniculo-cortical pathways, one of which originates with retinal DSGCs and delivers direction- and orientation-tuned information specifically to the superficial layers of the primary visual cortex. These data provide evidence that direction and orientation selectivity of some V1 neurons may be influenced by the activation of DSGCs."
https://openalex.org/W2024135146,"Nitrate is a primary nutrient for plant growth, but its levels in soil can fluctuate by several orders of magnitude. Previous studies have identified Arabidopsis NRT1.1 as a dual-affinity nitrate transporter that can take up nitrate over a wide range of concentrations. The mode of action of NRT1.1 is controlled by phosphorylation of a key residue, Thr 101; however, how this post-translational modification switches the transporter between two affinity states remains unclear. Here we report the crystal structure of unphosphorylated NRT1.1, which reveals an unexpected homodimer in the inward-facing conformation. In this low-affinity state, the Thr 101 phosphorylation site is embedded in a pocket immediately adjacent to the dimer interface, linking the phosphorylation status of the transporter to its oligomeric state. Using a cell-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay, we show that functional NRT1.1 dimerizes in the cell membrane and that the phosphomimetic mutation of Thr 101 converts the protein into a monophasic high-affinity transporter by structurally decoupling the dimer. Together with analyses of the substrate transport tunnel, our results establish a phosphorylation-controlled dimerization switch that allows NRT1.1 to uptake nitrate with two distinct affinity modes."
https://openalex.org/W1971553024,"Human fibroblasts can be converted into hepatocytes capable of repopulating mouse livers by shortcutting reprogramming to pluripotency with factors promoting endoderm and hepatocyte differentiation. Previous studies have reported the production of liver cells from human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, but attempts to use them to repopulate liver tissue have been hampered by the failure of transplanted cells to proliferate. Holger Willenbring and colleagues adopted an alternative strategy for liver repopulation, converting human fibroblasts into mature hepatocytes capable of repopulating mouse livers. Their method bypasses an induced pluripotent state, instead reprogramming human fibroblasts to an induced multipotent progenitor cell (iMPC) state. From these cells the authors obtained endoderm progenitor cells (iMPC-EPCs) that generate surrogate hepatocytes capable of post-transplant maturation and proliferation. This work demonstrates the feasibility of significant liver repopulation of mice with human hepatocytes generated in vitro, establishing the system as a possible model for research on autologous therapy of human liver diseases. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have the capability of revolutionizing research and therapy of liver diseases by providing a source of hepatocytes for autologous cell therapy and disease modelling. However, despite progress in advancing the differentiation of iPSCs into hepatocytes (iPSC-Heps) in vitro1,2,3, cells that replicate the ability of human primary adult hepatocytes (aHeps) to proliferate extensively in vivo have not been reported. This deficiency has hampered efforts to recreate human liver diseases in mice, and has cast doubt on the potential of iPSC-Heps for liver cell therapy. The reason is that extensive post-transplant expansion is needed to establish and sustain a therapeutically effective liver cell mass in patients, a lesson learned from clinical trials of aHep transplantation4. Here, as a solution to this problem, we report the generation of human fibroblast-derived hepatocytes that can repopulate mouse livers. Unlike current protocols for deriving hepatocytes from human fibroblasts, ours did not generate iPSCs but cut short reprogramming to pluripotency to generate an induced multipotent progenitor cell (iMPC) state from which endoderm progenitor cells and subsequently hepatocytes (iMPC-Heps) could be efficiently differentiated. For this purpose we identified small molecules that aided endoderm and hepatocyte differentiation without compromising proliferation. After transplantation into an immune-deficient mouse model of human liver failure, iMPC-Heps proliferated extensively and acquired levels of hepatocyte function similar to those of aHeps. Unfractionated iMPC-Heps did not form tumours, most probably because they never entered a pluripotent state. Our results establish the feasibility of significant liver repopulation of mice with human hepatocytes generated in vitro, which removes a long-standing roadblock on the path to autologous liver cell therapy."

The mechanism for the regulation of these receptors remains unknown. Here, we demonstrated that a novel hypoxia-responsive microRNA, microRNA-137 (miR-137), markedly inhibits mitochondrial degradation by autophagy without affecting global autophagy. miR-137 targets the expression of two mitophagy receptors NIX and FUNDC1. Impaired mitophagy in response to hypoxia caused by miR-137 is reversed by re-expression of FUNDC1 and NIX expression vectors lacking the miR-137 recognition sites at their 3′ UTR. Conversely, miR-137 also suppresses the mitophagy induced by fundc1 (CDS+3′UTR) but not fundc1 (CDS) overexpression.

Galaxy formation theory predicts mergers between lower mass galaxies. But although the accretion of small systems onto large ones such as the Milky Way has been observed indirectly, no mergers between low-mass galaxies — those of total mass less than that of a billion Sun-like stars — have been identified. Nicola Amorisco et al. now report the kinematic detection of a stellar stream in one of the satellite galaxies of Andromeda, the dwarf spheroidal Andromeda II. They conclude that they are observing the remnant of a merger between two dwarf galaxies. This illustrates the scale-free character of galaxy formation, down to the lowest galactic mass scales. Driven by gravity, massive structures like galaxies and clusters of galaxies are believed to grow continuously through hierarchical merging and accretion of smaller systems. Observational evidence of accretion events is provided by the coherent stellar streams crossing the outer haloes of massive galaxies, such as the Milky Way1 or Andromeda2. At similar mass scales, around 1011 solar masses in stars, further evidence of merging activity is also ample3,4,5. Mergers of lower-mass galaxies are expected within the hierarchical process of galaxy formation6, but have hitherto not been seen for galaxies with less than about 109 solar masses in stars7,8. Here we report the kinematic detection of a stellar stream in one of the satellite galaxies of Andromeda, the dwarf spheroidal Andromeda II, which has a mass of only 107 solar masses in stars9. The properties of the stream show that we are observing the remnant of a merger between two dwarf galaxies. This had a drastic influence on the dynamics of the remnant, which is now rotating around its projected major axis10. The stellar stream in Andromeda II illustrates the scale-free character of the formation of galaxies, down to the lowest galactic mass scales."

https://openalex.org/W2012702539,"To identify genes that maintain the homeostasis of adult articular cartilage and regenerate its lesions, we initially compared four types of chondrocytes: articular (AA) versus growth plate (AG) cartilage chondrocytes in adult rats, and superficial layer (IS) versus deep layer (ID) chondrocytes of epiphyseal cartilage in infant rats. Microarray analyses revealed that 40 and 186 genes had ≥10-fold higher expression ratios of AA/AG and IS/ID, respectively, and 16 genes showed ≥10-fold of both AA/AG and IS/ID ratios. The results were validated by real-time RT-PCR analysis. Among them, Hoxd1, Fgf18, and Esm1 were expressed more strongly in AA than in IS. Fgf18 was the extracellular and secreted factor that decreased glycosaminoglycan release and depletion from the cartilage, and enhanced proliferation of articular chondrocytes. Fgf18 was strongly expressed in the articular cartilage chondrocytes of adult rats. In a surgical rat osteoarthritis model, a once-weekly injection of recombinant human FGF18 (rhFGF18) given 3 weeks after surgery prevented cartilage degeneration in a dose-dependent manner at 6 and 9 weeks after surgery, with significant effect at 10 μg/week of rhFGF18. As the underlying mechanism, rhFGF18 strongly up-regulated Timp1 expression in the cell and organ cultures, and inhibition of aggrecan release by rhFGF18 was restored by addition of an antibody to Timp1. In conclusion, we have identified Fgf18 as a molecule that protects articular cartilage by gene expression profiling, and the anticatabolic effects may at least partially be mediated by the Timp1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2058134299,"The transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to Ser or Thr in cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins is a well known post-translational modification that is catalyzed by the O-GlcNAc transferase OGT. A more recently identified O-GlcNAc transferase, EOGT, functions in the secretory pathway and transfers O-GlcNAc to proteins with epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats. A number of antibodies that detect O-GlcNAc in cytosolic and nuclear extracts have been described previously. Here we compare seven of these antibodies (CTD110.6, 10D8, RL2, HGAC85, 18B10.C7(#3), 9D1.E4(#10), and 1F5.D6 (#14) for detection of the O-GlcNAc modification on extracellular domains of membrane or secreted glycoproteins that may also carry various N- and O-glycans. We found that CTD110.6 binds not only to O-GlcNAc on proteins but also to terminal β-GlcNAc on the complex N-glycans of Lec8 Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that lack UDP-Gal transporter activity and express GlcNAc-terminating, complex N-glycans. We show that CTD110.6, #3, and #10 antibodies can be used to detect cell surface glycoproteins bearing O-GlcNAc. Cell surface glycoproteins recognized by CTD110.6 antibody included NOTCH1 that possesses many EGF repeats with a consensus site for EOGT. Knockdown of CHO Eogt reduced binding of CTD110.6 to Lec1 CHO cells, and expression of a human EOGT cDNA increased the O-GlcNAc signal on Lec1 cells and the extracellular domain of NOTCH1. Thus, with careful controls, antibodies CTD110.6 (IgM), #3 (IgG), and #10 (IgG) can be used to detect membrane and secreted proteins modified by O-GlcNAc on EGF repeats."
https://openalex.org/W1966760878,"The pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in metabolic syndrome (MetS) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) is not well studied, partly because an appropriate model has not been developed. Recently, we introduced a novel model of spontaneous T2D and MetS that replicates the relevant features of the human disease. In the current study, we investigated the retinal vascular changes in these animals. Experimental DR in streptozotocin (STZ)-injected rodents is described as an inflammatory disease, in which intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) plays a key role. In comparison, advanced diabetes (HbA1c>10%) in the Nile grass rat (NGR) was associated with lower ICAM-1 protein expression when compared with that in normal or moderately diabetic animals. Vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) expression, however, was unaffected by the disease state. As opposed to the STZ-induced model of DR, in diabetic NGRs, most leukocytes accumulated in the retinal arteries. Consistent with the ICAM-1 reduction, leukocyte accumulation was significantly reduced in advanced disease. Similarly, leukocyte adhesions were significantly lower, with elevated plasma triglycerides (>200 mg/dl), and cholesterol (>240 mg/dl). However, these adhesions were significantly higher in animals with higher plasma insulin (>5 μIU/ml) and leptin (>20 ng/ml), suggesting a role for these hormones in diabetic retinal leukostasis. Diabetic NGRs showed substantial retinal endothelial injury, primarily in the microvessels, including vascular tortuosity, obliterated acellular capillaries, and pericyte ghosts.

We used comprehensive transcriptome profiling and systems biology analysis to interrogate the unique and overlapping molecular responses in rats provided these dietary regimens for 20 mo after weaning. Microarray analysis was conducted on inguinal white adipose (IWAT), brown adipose tissue (BAT), liver, and skeletal muscle. Compared to controls, CR-induced transcriptomic responses (absolute fold change ≥1.5 and P≤0.05) were comparable in IWAT, BAT, and liver (~800 genes). MR-induced effects were largely restricted to IWAT and liver (~2400 genes). Pathway enrichment and gene-coexpression analyses showed that induction of fatty acid synthesis in IWAT was common to CR and MR, whereas immunity and proinflammatory signaling pathways were specifically down-regulated in MR-treated IWAT and liver (FDR≤0.07–0.3). BAT demonstrated consistent down-regulation of PPAR-signaling under CR and MR, whereas muscle was largely unaffected. Interactome analysis identified CR-specific down-regulation of cytoskeletal matrix components in IWAT and MR-specific up-regulation of ribosomal genes in liver (FDR≤0.001). Transcriptomic down-regulation of inflammation genes by MR in IWAT was consistent with upstream inhibition of STAT3.

In this study, we investigated the mechanisms that may underlie the pain-relieving effects of the compound. We found that imperatorin significantly inhibited formalin- and capsaicin-induced nocifensive responses but did not alter baseline thermal withdrawal thresholds in the rat. We established that imperatorin is a weak agonist of TRPV1, a channel implicated in detecting several noxious stimuli, exhibiting a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 12.6 ± 3.2 μM. A specific TRPV1 antagonist, JNJ-17203212 (0.5 μM), potently inhibited imperatorin-induced TRPV1 activation. Site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed that imperatorin most likely acted via a site adjacent to or overlapping with the TRPV1 capsaicin-binding site. TRPV1 recovery from desensitization was delayed in the presence of imperatorin. Conversely, imperatorin sensitized TRPV1 to acid activation but did not affect the current amplitude and/or the activation-inactivation properties of Na(v)1.7, a channel important for transmission of nociceptive information. Thus, our data indicate that furanocoumarins represent a novel group of TRPV1 modulators that may become important lead compounds in the drug discovery process aimed at developing new treatments for pain management."

The human TRPV4V620I channelopathy mutation was transfected into primary porcine chondrocytes and caused significant (2.6-fold) up-regulation of follistatin (FST) expression levels. Pore altering mutations that prevent calcium influx through the channel prevented significant FST up-regulation (1.1-fold). We generated a mouse model of theTRPV4V620I mutation, and found significant skeletal deformities (e.g., shortening of tibiae and digits, similar to the human disease brachyolmia) and increases in Fst/TRPV4 mRNA levels (2.8-fold). FST was significantly up-regulated in primary chondrocytes transfected with 3 different dysplasia-causing TRPV4 mutations (2- to 2.3-fold), but was not affected by an arthropathy mutation (1.1-fold). Furthermore, FST-loaded microbeads decreased bone ossification in developing chick femora (6%) and tibiae (11%). FST gene and protein levels were also increased 4-fold in human chondrocytes from an individual natively expressing the TRPV4T89I mutation.

Muscle RING finger protein 1 (MuRF1), a muscle-specific ubiquitin ligase, is implicated in many cardiac and skeletal muscle diseases. However, the role of MuRF1 in the regulation of vascular BK channel and coronary function has not been examined. In this study, we hypothesized that MuRF1 participated in BK-β1 proteolysis, leading to the down-regulation of BK channel activation and impaired coronary function in diabetes. Combining patch clamp and molecular biological approaches, we found that MuRF1 expression was enhanced, accompanied by reduced BK-β1 expression, in high glucose-cultured human coronary SMCs and in diabetic vessels. Knockdown of MuRF1 by siRNA in cultured human SMCs attenuated BK-β1 ubiquitination and increased BK-β1 expression, whereas adenoviral expression of MuRF1 in mouse coronary arteries reduced BK-β1 expression and diminished BK channel-mediated vasodilation. Physical interaction between the N terminus of BK-β1 and the coiled-coil domain of MuRF1 was demonstrated by pulldown assay. Moreover, MuRF1 expression was regulated by NF-κB. Most importantly, pharmacological inhibition of proteasome and NF-κB activities preserved BK-β1 expression and BK-channel-mediated coronary vasodilation in diabetic mice. Hence, our results provide the first evidence that the up-regulation of NF-κB-dependent MuRF1 expression is a novel mechanism that leads to BK channelopathy and vasculopathy in diabetes."

Although the Metnase transposase domain has been largely conserved, its catalytic motif (DDN) differs from the DDD motif of related transposases, which may be important for its role as a DNA repair factor and its enzymatic activities. Here, we show that substitution of DDN610 with either DDD610 or DDE610 significantly reduced in vivo functions of Metnase in NHEJ repair and accelerated restart of replication forks. We next tested whether the DDD or DDE mutants cleave single-strand extensions and flaps in partial duplex DNA and pseudo-Tyr structures that mimic stalled replication forks. Neither substrate is cleaved by the DDD or DDE mutant, under the conditions where wild-type Metnase effectively cleaves ssDNA overhangs. We then characterized the ssDNA-binding activity of the Metnase transposase domain and found that the catalytic domain binds ssDNA but not dsDNA, whereas dsDNA binding activity resides in the helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain. Substitution of Asn-610 with either Asp or Glu within the transposase domain significantly reduces ssDNA binding activity. Collectively, our results suggest that a single mutation DDN610 → DDD610, which restores the ancestral catalytic site, results in loss of function in Metnase.

U.S.A. 2006; 103: 8101-8106Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This finding was rationalized based on the fact that the highly conserved DDD motif is DDN in Metnase and thus lacks the third acidic residue predicted to be involved in metal binding. The mariner family of transposases, from which Metnase evolved, all contain a DDD motif and substitution with DDE results in loss of transposition activity (15.Lohe A.R. De Aguiar D. Hartl D.L.

However, later studies reported by two groups independently suggest that Metnase retains DNA cleavage activity (3.Liu D. Bischerour J. Siddique A. Buisine N. Bigot Y. Chalmers R.

Although the Metnase transposase lacks robust 5′ end processing activity catalyzed by Mg2+, it was reported to have some activity with Mn2+ (3.Liu D. Bischerour J. Siddique A. Buisine N. Bigot Y. Chalmers R. The human SETMAR protein preserves most of the activities of the ancestral Hsmar1 transposase.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 1125-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The DDD Metnase mutant had detectable 5′ end processing activity with Mg2+ but much higher activity catalyzed in the presence of Mn2+ (3.Liu D. Bischerour J. Siddique A. Buisine N. Bigot Y. Chalmers R. The human SETMAR protein preserves most of the activities of the ancestral Hsmar1 transposase.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 1125-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The major defect in transposase activities found for Metnase was 3′ end processing activity (3.Liu D. Bischerour J. Siddique A. Buisine N. Bigot Y. Chalmers R. The human SETMAR protein preserves most of the activities of the ancestral Hsmar1 transposase.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 1125-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although the Metnase transposase is 94% identical to the predicted ancestral sequence (2.Robertson H.M. Zumpano K.L. Molecular evolution of an ancient mariner transposon, Hsmar1, in the human genome.Gene. 1997; 205: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), substitution of the DDN to DDD motif is not sufficient to restore transposase activity (14.Miskey C.

Furthermore, full-length Metnase purified from mammalian cells does not appear to retain the same DNA cleavage activity (9.Beck B.D. Lee S.S. Williamson E. Hromas R.A. Lee S.H.

Biol. 2007; 27: 1125-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The mariner family of transposases was classified as using a two metal ion mechanism involving coordination through the DDD motif (17.Yang W. Nucleases: diversity of structure, function and mechanism.Q Rev. Biophys. 2011; 44: 1-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) based largely on comparison with the Tn5 synaptic complex transposition intermediate structure (18.Davies D.R. Goryshin I.Y. Reznikoff W.S. Rayment I. Three-dimensional structure of the Tn5 synaptic complex transposition intermediate.Science. 2000; 289: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), which contains two Mn2+ atoms bound in the active site coordinated by three acidic residues. These enzymes are known to be Mg2+-dependent. However, many of the crystal structures reported to date for mariner-derived transposases contain one rather than two metal ions bound to the active site (19.Goodwin K.D. He H. Imasaki T. Lee S.H.

Walkinshaw M.D. Mechanism of Mos1 transposition: insights from structural analysis.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1324-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), suggesting that binding of the second metal ion may require the presence of bound substrate. A recent structure reported for the catalytic domain of Mos1 bound to two metal ions and the drug raltegravir is consistent with binding of the second metal in the presence of a bound ligand in the active site (22.Wolkowicz U.M. Morris E.R. Robson M. Trubitsyna M. Richardson J.M. Structural basis of Mos1 transposase inhibition by the anti-retroviral drug Raltegravir.ACS Chem. Biol. 2014; 10.1021/cb400791uCrossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). By analogy, the proposed model for metal binding suggests that in Metnase Asp-483 would coordinate two metal ions, whereas Asp-575 and Asn-610 (or substituted Asp or Glu) would be involved in coordinating only one of the two metal ions (see Fig. 1 for comparison of Metnase and Mos1 active sites). In the present study, we determined that Asn-610 within the catalytic domain plays an essential role in ssDNA binding activity, which is not only crucial for ss-overhang cleavage but also necessary for function of Metnase in DSB repair and restart of blocked replication forks. Cell lines were cultured in DMEM with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Metnase was overexpressed in HEK293 cells as described (10.Beck B.D. Park S.J. Lee Y.J. Roman Y. Hromas R.A. Lee S.H.

FLAG-Metnase overexpression was confirmed by Western blot with a monoclonal antibody (Sigma M1). Metnase was down-regulated by transfecting cells with two siRNAs (5′-GUCGAACAUCAGUUGUGGAAAdTdT-3′, 5′-GCGAUUGACCCUUGAGACUAUdTdT-3′, Dharmacon Research) for 48 h, whereas control cells were transfected with a scrambled siRNA (AllStars negative control siRNA, Qiagen). Metnase expression was measured by RT-PCR and by Western blots using antibodies to native Metnase as described (5.Lee S.H. Oshige M. Durant S.T. Rasila K.K. Williamson E.A. Ramsey H. Kwan L.

DNA cleavage was monitored as described previously (9.Beck B.D. Lee S.S. Williamson E. Hromas R.A. Lee S.H. Biochemical characterization of Metnase's endonuclease activity and its role in NHEJ repair.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 4360-4370Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, BSA (10 μg), and 2 mm MgCl2 were incubated with indicated amounts of WT or mutant Metnase in the presence of 200 fmol of 5′-32P-labeled DNA. After incubation at 37 °C for indicated amount of time, reaction mixtures were resolved by electrophoresis using 12% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 m urea, and cleavage products were detected by autoradiography. Duplex DNA was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The indicated amount of purified Metnase was incubated with 200 fmol of 5′-32P-labeled DNA at room temperature for 15 min in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.8), poly(dI:dC) (0.2 μg), bovine serum albumin (0.2 μg/μl), and 50 mm NaCl. The Metnase-DNA complex was analyzed on either a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE or 1% vertical agarose gel in 1× TBE. The gels were dried, and protein binding was detected by autoradiography. The Metnase transposase (aa 329–671) and catalytic domain (aa 329–440) were inserted into the pET28b-derived pSUMO vector (23.Mossessova E. Lima C.D.

These vectors express recombinant protein with an N-terminal His6-tagged SUMO fusion partner, which was cleaved using the SUMO-specific protease Ulp1 during the purification to yield the Metnase domain of interest. Metnase, including aa 329–671, was amplified by PCR using the forward primer 5′- ATATCGGATCCATGAAAATGATGTTAGACAAAAAGCAAATTCG and reverse primer 5′-TATAGCTCGAGTTAATCAAAATAGGAACCATTACAATC (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, Iowa). For Metnase aa 329–440, the forward primer was the same as above, and the reverse primer was 5′-TATAGCTCGAGTTACACCTTTCCAATTTGCTTCAAATGTC. Using WT Metnase aa 329–671 as the template, Metnase aa 329–671 N610D and N610E were generated using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). Proteins were expressed in Rosetta cells (Novagen) following induction with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 15 °C overnight. Cells were harvested, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm phosphate, pH 7.8, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole), and lysed by using a French press (Aminco) with three passes at 1,000 psi. The crude cell lysates were centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, and clear lysates were applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column, followed by Ulp1 protease cleavage to liberate Metnase from the fusion protein. The elution fractions were then loaded to an Sp-Sepharose ion exchange column and finally a gel filtration column (Superdex 200 16/60 prep). The C-terminal catalytic domain Metnase (aa 433–671) was expressed and purified as described previously (16.Roman Y. Oshige M. Lee Y.J. Goodwin K. Georgiadis M.M. Hromas R.A. Lee S.H. Biochemical characterization of a SET and transposase fusion protein, Metnase: its DNA binding and DNA cleavage activity.Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 11369-11376Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In brief, the protein was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography followed by Sp-Sepharose ion exchange chromatography. After thrombin digestion to remove the N-terminal His tag, a second Sp-Sepharose chromatography purification step was performed to obtain the pure protein. The original plasmid containing the Mos1 transposase coding sequence was purchased from the Addgene website (plasmid ID 34874) (24.Frøkjær-Jensen C. Davis M.W. Ailion M. Jorgensen E.M. Improved Mos1-mediated transgenesis in C. elegans.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 117-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). However, this plasmid contains a 51-bp insertion within the Mos1 ORF. To delete this insertion, the fragment was first subcloned into the pET28b-SUMO-tagged vector (23.Mossessova E. Lima C.D. Ulp1-SUMO crystal structure and genetic analysis reveal conserved interactions and a regulatory element essential for cell growth in yeast.Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). The insert was then deleted using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). The primers used for PCR amplifying the fragment from the original plasmid were 5′-ATATCGGATCCATGTCGAGTTTCGTGCCGAATAAAGAGC-3′ (BamH I site, underlined), 5′-TATAGCTCGAGTTATTCAAAGTATTTGCCGTCGCTCGCG-3′ (XhoI site, underlined) (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, Iowa). The new plasmid was subjected to deletion, using primers 5′-CTCTGCGAGTTGTTTTTGCGTTTGAGCATCGTCTTC-3′ and 5′-GAAGACGATGCTCAAACGCAAAAACAACTCGCAGAG-3′. The final plasmid pET28b-SUMO-tag-Mos1 (WT) was validated by sequencing. To construct the Mos1 (D284N) mutant plasmid, PCR mutagenesis with the primers 5′-CGAATAGGTGGTAATTGGATGGGGCCAGGTC-3′ and 5′-GACCTGGCCCCATCCAATTACCACCTATTCG-3′ was conducted on the basis of Mos1 (WT) plasmid, using the above site-directed mutagenesis kit as well. Mos1 protein overexpression and purification were done using the same procedures described above for Metnase transposase proteins. Reaction mixtures (50 μl) containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 nm rhodamine-labeled DNA probe were incubated with varying concentrations of Metnase. TIR DNA sequences were as follows: 5′-(rhodamine) (C6 amino)-AACCGCAATTACTTTTGCACCAACC (Metnase binding site underlined) and 5′-TCAGTAGGTTGGTGCAAAAGTAATTGCGGTT were annealed to form a partial duplex DNA with a 5′-6 nt overhang; A 5′-(rhodamine) (C6 amino)-AACCGCAATTACTTTTGCACCAACCTAA-3′ oligonucleotide was annealed to its complementary sequence to make 28-bp blunt-ended dsDNA. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Midland Certified Reagent Company, Inc. (Midland, TX). Measurements were conducted on the EnvisionTM 2102 Multilabel Plate Reader (PerkinElmer Life Science, Chemical Genomics Core Facility at Indiana University School of Medicine). The data were curve-fitted, and Kd values for the binding activity were calculated using the one site saturation ligand binding equation (SigmaPlot, version 11.2). ssDNA binding activity was assayed using a 25-nt rhodamine-labeled TIR DNA oligonucleotide: 5′-(Rhodamine) (C6-amino)-AACCGCAATTACTTTTGCACCAACC. For end-joining assays coupled to Escherichia coli colony formation, reactions (100 ml) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm magnesium acetate, 60 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, and 100 mg/ml BSA. Where indicated, 2.5 mm dNTPs were included in the reaction mixtures. Cell-free extracts were preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C before addition of 1.0 mg of DNA substrate. Following incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, DNA products were deproteinized, purified by QIAprep Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), transformed into E. coli, and colonies were scored as described (5.Lee S.H.

Cells (2.0 × 105 cells/well) were grown on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips (neuVitro, 18-mm diameter) and 48 h later were treated with 2 mm hydroxyurea (HU) for 18 h, washed three times with growth media, and incubated in fresh media for 0, 2, 6, and 24 h. After briefly washing cells with PBS, cells were fixed for 5 min in ice-cold methanol at −20 °C. The slips were then blocked for 30 min with 5% BSA in PBS and incubated with a mouse anti γ-H2AX monoclonal antibody (Millipore, 05-636) for 1.5 h at room temperature. The slides were washed four times with 0.2% Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody (Invitrogen) in a wet chamber covered by aluminum foil. After washing four times with 0.2% Tween 20-PBS, samples were mounted (VECTASHIELD® mounting medium with DAPI, VECTOR Laboratories), and nuclei were visualized using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510 NLO, 63× oil immersion objective). Cells were grown in six-well dishes (6 × 105 per well), and 20 mm IdU was added to growth medium and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. After washing with fresh medium, cells were treated with 5 mm HU for 60 min or mock-treated. Medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 100 mm CldU, cells were further incubated for indicated times at 37 °C. Cells were harvested, resuspended in PBS, and ∼1000 cells were transferred to a positively charged microscope slide (Superfrost/Plus, Daigger), and processed for DNA fiber analysis as described previously (25.De Haro L.P.

https://openalex.org/W2011958820,"Chicken oocytes develop in follicles and reach an enormous size because of a massive uptake of yolk precursors such as very low density lipoprotein and vitellogenin. Oocyte growth is supported by theca cells and granulosa cells, which establish dynamic and highly organized cell layers surrounding the oocyte. The signaling processes orchestrating the development of these layered structures are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that the Reelin pathway, which determines the development of layered neuronal structures in the brain, is also active in chicken follicles. Reelin, which is expressed in theca cells, triggers a signal in granulosa cells via apolipoprotein E receptor 2 and the very low density lipoprotein receptor, resulting in the phosphorylation of disabled-1 and consecutive activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway. This signaling pathway supports the proliferation of differentiated granulosa cells to keep up with the demand of cells to cover the rapidly increasing surface of the giant germ cell."
https://openalex.org/W2128749845,"In humans, a primate-specific variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) polymorphism (4 or 5 repeats 54 nt in length) in the circadian gene PER3 is associated with differences in sleep timing and homeostatic responses to sleep loss. We investigated the effects of this polymorphism on circadian rhythmicity and sleep homeostasis by introducing the polymorphism into mice and assessing circadian and sleep parameters at baseline and during and after 12 h of sleep deprivation (SD). Microarray analysis was used to measure hypothalamic and cortical gene expression. Circadian behavior and sleep were normal at baseline. The response to SD of 2 electrophysiological markers of sleep homeostasis, electroencephalography (EEG) θ power during wakefulness and δ power during sleep, were greater in the Per35/5 mice. During recovery, the Per35/5 mice fully compensated for the SD-induced deficit in δ power, but the Per34/4 and wild-type mice did not. Sleep homeostasis-related transcripts (e.g., Homer1, Ptgs2, and Kcna2) were differentially expressed between the humanized mice, but circadian clock genes were not. These data are in accordance with the hypothesis derived from human data that the PER3 VNTR polymorphism modifies the sleep homeostatic response without significantly influencing circadian parameters.—Hasan, S., van der Veen, D.

Thus, it is important to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms that modulate this system. Here, we show that FGFR-1 can interact with the TNF receptor superfamily member fibroblast growth factor-inducible molecule 14 (Fn14) resulting in cardiomyocyte cell cycle reentry. FGF1-induced cell cycle reentry in neonatal cardiomyocytes could be blocked by Fn14 inhibition, while TWEAK-induced cell cycle activation was inhibited by blocking FGFR-1 signaling. In addition, costimulation experiments revealed a synergistic effect of FGF1 and TWEAK in regard to cardiomyocyte cell cycle induction via PI3K/Akt signaling. Overexpression of Fn14 with either FGFR-1 long [FGFR-1(L)] or FGFR-1 short [FGFR-1(S)] isoforms resulted after FGF1/TWEAK stimulation in cell cycle reentry of >40% adult cardiomyocytes. Finally, coimmunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays indicated that endogenous FGFR-1 and Fn14 interact with each other in cardiomyocytes. This interaction was strongly enhanced in the presence of their corresponding ligands, FGF1 and TWEAK. Taken together, our data suggest that FGFR-1/Fn14 interaction may represent a novel endogenous mechanism to modulate the action of these receptors and their ligands and to control cardiomyocyte cell cycle reentry.—Novoyatleva, T., Sajjad, A., Pogoryelov, D., Patra, C., Schermuly, R.

https://openalex.org/W2044992022,"Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters are versatile cofactors involved in regulating multiple physiological activities, including energy generation through cellular respiration.

Loss of ISCU function leads to myopathy, characterized by muscle wasting and cardiac hypertrophy.

In this report, we uncover mechanistic insights concerning how the G50E ISCU mutation in humans leads to the development of severe ISCU myopathy, using a human cell line and yeast as the model systems. The biochemical results highlight that the G50E mutation results in compromised interaction with the sulfur donor NFS1 and the J-protein HSCB, thus impairing the rate of Fe-S cluster synthesis. As a result, electron transport chain complexes show significant reduction in their redox properties, leading to loss of cellular respiration. Furthermore, the G50E mutant mitochondria display enhancement in iron level and reactive oxygen species, thereby causing oxidative stress leading to impairment in the mitochondrial functions.

Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters are indispensable and ubiquitous cofactors that are involved in a variety of regulatory processes, including catalysis and electron carrier activity (1.Craig E.A. Marszalek J. A specialized mitochondrial molecular chaperone system: a role in formation of Fe/S centers.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1658-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although the Fe-S clusters are relatively simple inorganic cofactors, their synthesis, assembly, and successive incorporation into apoproteins are highly intricate processes in living cells (2.Craig E.A. Voisine C. Schilke B. Mitochondrial iron metabolism in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1167-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 3.Lill R. Function and biogenesis of iron-sulphur proteins.Nature. 2009; 460: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Fe-S clusters are usually integrated into proteins through coordination of the iron atoms by cysteine or histidine residues, although in more complex Fe-S clusters alternative ligands like Asp, Arg, and Ser and functional groups like CO and CN have been reported (4.Meyer J. Iron-sulfur protein folds, iron-sulfur chemistry, and evolution.J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2008; 13: 157-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Coordination of Fe-S clusters to electron transport chain complexes is indispensable for respiratory function within the cell. For example, complex I of bacteria contains nine Fe-S clusters, whereas eukaryotic complex I harbors eight Fe-S clusters, which are anchored to domains exposed to the cytosol or mitochondrial matrix, respectively (5.Hinchliffe P. Sazanov L.A. Organization of iron-sulfur clusters in respiratory complex I.Science. 2005; 309: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 6.Sazanov L.A. Respiratory complex I: mechanistic and structural insights provided by the crystal structure of the hydrophilic domain.Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2275-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). On the other hand, mammalian complex II possesses three distinct Fe-S clusters of the [2Fe-2S], [3Fe-4S], and [4Fe-4S] type (7.Sun F. Huo X. Zhai Y. Wang A. Xu J. Su D. Bartlam M. Rao Z.

Mitochondria are the major cellular compartment for Fe-S cluster biogenesis in eukaryotes, including the mammalian system. The central part of Fe-S protein biogenesis in human mitochondria is the de novo synthesis of the Fe-S cluster on a highly conserved scaffold protein, ISCU, before its transfer to apoproteins (10.Lill R. Dutkiewicz R. Elsässer H.P. Hausmann A. Netz D.J. Pierik A.J. Stehling O. Urzica E. Mühlenhoff U. Mechanisms of iron-sulfur protein maturation in mitochondria, cytosol and nucleus of eukaryotes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 652-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Mammalian ISCU is a nuclear encoded protein, predominantly localized in the mitochondrial matrix compartment, and comprises 167 amino acids with an N-terminal targeting signal. However, the presence of cytosolic ISCU has also been reported in humans (11.Tong W.H. Rouault T. Distinct iron-sulfur cluster assembly complexes exist in the cytosol and mitochondria of human cells.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5692-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, there are two orthologs of human ISCU, namely Isu1 and Isu2, which are localized in the matrix compartment (12.Garland S.A. Hoff K. Vickery L.E. Culotta V.C. Saccharomyces cerevisiae ISU1 and ISU2: members of a well-conserved gene family for iron-sulfur cluster assembly.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In yeast, the ISU1 and ISU2 double deletion mutant is inviable, thus signifying its central importance in the Fe-S cluster biogenesis (12.Garland S.A. Hoff K. Vickery L.E. Culotta V.C.

The overall biogenesis process can be broadly categorized into two critical events: (a) the de novo assembly of an Fe-S cluster on a scaffold protein and (b) the transfer of the Fe-S cluster from the scaffold to target apoproteins (13.Fontecave M. Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis in bacteria: mechanisms of cluster assembly and transfer.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2008; 474: 226-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). A cysteine desulfurase, Nfs1, assists in the sulfur transfer process to the scaffold protein (14.Biederbick A. Stehling O.

The iron-binding protein frataxin (Yfh1 in yeast and CyaY in bacteria) is believed to function as an iron donor (17.Bencze K.Z. Kondapalli K.C. Cook J.D. McMahon S. Millán-Pacheco C. Pastor N.

The terminal transfer process is assisted by a dedicated chaperone system comprising the mtHsp70 (Ssq1 in yeast) and the DnaJ-like cochaperone, HSCB (Jac1 in yeast) (18.Craig E.A. Huang P. Aron R.

Because Fe-S proteins play a critical role in a wide range of cellular activities, a mutation in different components of the synthesis machinery disrupts the process of Fe-S cluster biogenesis and is thus associated with multiple pathological conditions in humans. For instance, one mutation identified in the human mitochondrial iron-sulfur assembly enzyme, ISCU, is known to cause severe myopathy (ISCU myopathy; OMIM *611911). ISCU myopathy is a recessively inherited disorder characterized by lifelong exercise intolerance, where minor exertion causes pain of active muscles, shortness of breath, fatigue, and tachycardia (22.Mochel F.

The disease is non-progressive, but in certain cases, metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, and myoglobinuria have also been reported (24.Kollberg G. Melberg A. Holme E. Oldfors A.

Interestingly, these patients were compound heterozygous for the common intronic splice mutation (g.7044G→C) on one allele, leading to truncated protein and a novel (c.149G→A) missense mutation in exon 3 on the other allele. The missense mutation in exon 3 changes a completely conserved glycine residue to a glutamate at the 50th position (G50E) in the amino acid sequence (28.Kollberg G. Tulinius M. Melberg A. Darin N. Andersen O. Holmgren D. Oldfors A. Holme E. Clinical manifestation and a new ISCU mutation in iron-sulphur cluster deficiency myopathy.Brain. 2009; 132: 2170-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The transmission of the G50E mutation alone was found to be recessive because the carrier population did not show significant symptoms of the disease. However, the exact molecular mechanisms of disease development as a result of G50E mutation in ISCU in conjunction with the g.7044G→C allele in compound heterozygous patients have not been elucidated. Due to the critical function played by ISCU scaffold protein in the Fe-S cluster biogenesis process in humans, the G50E mutant is expected to contribute significantly toward ISCU myopathy. In this report, we delineate the impact of the G50E mutation on mitochondrial function by utilizing the HeLa cell line and yeast as a model system. Our findings highlight that the G50E mutation leads to severe growth defects, compromised Fe-S cluster-containing enzyme activity, sensitivity to oxidative stress, increased cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), elevated iron level, and reduced interaction of scaffold protein with its interacting partners, thus contributing significantly toward mitochondrial myopathy. Moreover, at the protein level, the G50E mutation was found to form a higher order oligomeric structure that probably reduces the functionality of the protein. HeLa cells were transfected with pCI-neo-ISCU and pCI-neo-G50E ISCU using Lipofectamine 2000 for expression of wild type ISCU and G50E ISCU. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma). The cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 48 h prior to experiments. The adherent cultures of HeLa cells were grown to ∼90% confluence. The cells were trypsinized, washed with ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and utilized for different experiments and mitochondria isolation. For genetic analysis in yeast, full-length human WT ISCU and yeast WT ISU1 were amplified from a HeLa cell cDNA library (Stratagene) and W303 yeast genomic DNA, respectively. ISCU and ISU1 with a C-terminal FLAG tag were cloned in pRS414 yeast expression vector under the TEF or GPD promoter containing a Trp marker for selection. The Δisu1/isu2 double deleted yeast haploid strain, W303 (trp1-1 ura3-1 leu2-3, 112 his3-11, 15 ade2-1 can1–100 GAL2+ met2-Δ1 lys2-Δ2 isu2::HIS3 isu1::LEU2), contained the plasmid pRS316-ISU1 for the maintenance of viability. For in vivo phenotype analysis, the haploid Δisu1/isu2 strain was transformed with pRS414-ISCU, pRS414-G50E ISCU, pRS414-ISU1, and pRS414-isu1G50E. The transformants were selected on tryptophan omission plates at 30 °C. The transformants (Trp+) were then subjected to spot test analysis using serial dilutions of the cells on different media like Trp−, Trp− containing H2O2, and medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (U.S. Biological) to eliminate the WT ISU1 containing the plasmid pRS316. For purification of ISCU and Isu1 using a bacterial expression system, the ORFs without N-terminal signal sequences of ISCU (aa 35–167) and ISU1 (aa 37–165) were inserted in between the BamHI-SalI restriction sites of the pRSFDuet-1 vector, carrying an N-terminal vector backbone His6 tag. The glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion constructs of hNFS1 (aa 56–457 into BamHI-SalI), yNFS1 (aa 37–497 into BamHI-XhoI), HSCB (aa 22–235 into BamHI-SalI), and JAC1 (aa 1–184 into BamHI-XhoI) were generated by introducing the respective coding sequences downstream of the GST tag in the pGEX-KG vector, respectively. For mammalian transfection experiments, the full-length human ISCU and G50E ISCU were cloned downstream to a CMV-based promoter of pCI-neo vector (Promega) with a FLAG tag at the 3′-end of the open reading frame. The G50E point mutation was created through QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis, using high fidelity Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). All of the clones were verified by DNA sequencing reactions carried out at Eurofins Inc. and Macrogen Inc. For purification of N-terminal His6-tagged human WT ISCU and G50E ISCU or yeast WT Isu1 and Isu1G50E, the proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain by allowing growth at 30 °C to an A600 of 0.6, followed by induction using 0.5 mm IPTG for 6 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and then lysed in buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm imidazole, 1 mm PMSF, and 10% glycerol) along with 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme, followed by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h. The samples were gently treated with 0.2% deoxycholate, followed by DNase I (10 μg/ml) treatment for 15 min at 4 °C. The cells were further lysed by sonicating three times (for 15 s each) at 25% amplitude using an Ultrasonic processor with 2-min intervals in ice. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifuging at 22,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 2 h at 4 °C. Unbound proteins and nonspecific contaminants were removed by multiple washes of buffer A alone followed by sequential single washes of buffer B (buffer A along with 0.05% Triton X-100), buffer C (buffer A along with 1 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2), buffer D (buffer A along with 1 m NaCl), and buffer E (buffer C along with 40 mm imidazole). Finally, the bound proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 250 mm imidazole. Purification of other proteins was also achieved by the same strategy as mentioned above with minor modifications. For GST-tagged proteins, the purification was performed in a conventional manner using the GST-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). The bound proteins were stored in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 100 mm NaCl at 4 °C. In order to analyze the extent of superoxide generation by the mitochondria, we utilized MitoSOX Red dye (Molecular Probes). This dye is specifically targeted to the mitochondria, where it undergoes oxidation by the mitochondrial superoxide radicals and fluoresces upon binding to mitochondrial DNA, with an emission maximum of 580 nm. Transfected HeLa cells cultured for 48 h and 0.1 OD (A600) of yeast cells from the early log phase were harvested and incubated with the dye (0.5 μm for HeLa and 2.5 μm for yeast) for 10 min, following which they were washed with 1× PBS and subjected to FACS analysis using a 488-nm argon laser for excitation (BD FACS Canto II). The respiratory inhibitor rotenone (1 mm) was used as a positive control for generating higher superoxide levels. The mean fluorescence intensity values of 10,000 events were recorded per sample and plotted to compare the relative ROS levels using the WinMDI version 2.9 software (29.Goswami A.V. Samaddar M. Sinha D. Purushotham J. D'Silva P. Enhanced J-protein interaction and compromised protein stability of mtHsp70 variants lead to mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2012; 21: 3317-3332Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). HeLa cells harboring WT ISCU and G50E ISCU were seeded on a coverslip (5000 cells/well in 12-well plates) and cultured for 48 h. Medium was removed, cells were washed with 1× PBS, and cells were stained with 0.1 μm MitoSOX Red and 250 ng/ml Hoechst 33342 for 15 min in 300 μl of 1× PBS at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Prior to analysis, cells were twice washed with 1× PBS. Images were acquired using a ×63 objective lens on a Zeiss apotome fluorescence microscope. For MitoSOX Red fluorescence imaging of yeast, 0.1 OD (A600) of cells from mid-log phase grown at 37 °C were incubated with 5 μm dye for 15 min. The cells were washed twice with 1× PBS before analysis. Images were acquired using a ×100 objective lens on a Leica fluorescence microscope. A similar strategy was used for H2DCF-DA and calcein blue staining. HeLa cells were treated with 1 μm H2DCF-DA for 15 min, and yeast cells were treated with 5 μm H2DCF-DA for 20 min, and for calcein blue staining, HeLa cells were treated with 3 μm calcein blue for 20 min. To test the specificity of calcein blue staining, the mutant cells were treated with a 1 mm concentration of the iron-specific chelator deferoxamine (DFO) (30.Uchiyama A. Kim J.S. Kon K. Jaeschke H. Ikejima K. Watanabe S. Lemasters J.J. Translocation of iron from lysosomes into mitochondria is a key event during oxidative stress-induced hepatocellular injury.Hepatology. 2008; 48: 1644-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Images of HeLa cells were taken using a ×63 objective lens of the Zeiss apotome fluorescence microscope, and images of the yeast cell were taken with a ×100 objective lens on a Leica fluorescence microscope. Purified GST-hNFS1 (1.5 μm)/GST-yNfs1 (1.5 μm) and GST-HSCB (1 μm)/GST-Jac1 (2.5 μm) were incubated with a 10-μl bed volume of glutathione-agarose beads in 200 μl of GST buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 40 mm imidazole, 50 μm pyridoxal phosphate, 10% glycerol) and GST buffer B (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 40 mm imidazole, 0.2% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol) for an interaction study with either WT or mutant ISCU/Isu1, respectively. Unbound proteins were removed by washing the beads three times with the respective GST buffers. After removing unbound proteins, the samples were blocked with 0.1% BSA for 20 min at 20 °C, followed by washing two times with GST buffer to remove excess unbound BSA. The beads were resuspended in 200 μl of GST binding buffer and incubated with increasing concentrations of either WT or mutant ISCU/Isu1 for 30 min at 20 °C. The GST beads were washed three times with GST buffer and resolved on SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie dye staining. Enzymatic assays of complex I, complex II, and complex IV were performed according to a protocol described previously (31.Spinazzi M. Casarin A. Pertegato V. Salviati L. Angelini C. Assessment of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymatic activities on tissues and cultured cells.Nat. Protoc. 2012; 7: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Briefly, 15 μg of protein corresponding to mitochondria isolated from HeLa cells were subjected to three cycles of freeze-thawing before complex I activity was assayed. Mitochondria were resuspended in 50 mm of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 100 μm NADH, 3 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA, 300 μm sodium azide (NaN3). The reaction was started by adding 60 μm ubiquinone, and the decrease of absorbance at 340 nm was monitored for 2 min. To check for specificity of the reaction, the experiment was performed both in the presence and absence of the specific inhibitor rotenone (10 μm). For complex II activity analysis, 2 μg of protein corresponding to HeLa cell mitochondria and 10 μg of protein corresponding to yeast cell mitochondria were resuspended in 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 20 mm succinate, 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA, 300 μm NaN3, 10 μm rotenone, 10 μg/ml antimycin A, and 80 μm 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was started by adding 60 μm ubiquinone, and the decrease in the absorbance at 600 nm was recorded for 3 min. For complex IV activity, 2 μg of protein corresponding to HeLa cell mitochondria and 10 μg of protein corresponding to yeast cell mitochondria were resuspended in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7). The reaction was started by adding 60 μm reduced cytochrome c, and the decrease in absorbance at 550 nm for 3 min was observed. To check the specificity of complex IV activity, this experiment was performed in the presence and in the absence of complex IV inhibitor NaN3 (300 μm). Aconitase activity was also measured following a similar protocol as described earlier (32.Pierik A.J. Netz D.J. Lill R. Analysis of iron-sulfur protein maturation in eukaryotes.Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, 25 μg of protein corresponding to HeLa cell mitochondria and 50 μg of protein corresponding to yeast cell mitochondria were dissolved in buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl) containing 1% deoxycholic acid and incubated for 10 min. The reaction was started by the addition of sodium citrate dihydrate, and the absorbance increase at 235 nm for 2 min was followed in a quartz cuvette. Mitochondrial ATP was quantified using the mitochondrial ToxGloTM assay kit (Promega). Briefly, 1–2 μg of mitochondria were resuspended in 80 μl of SE buffer (250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2) and mixed with 20 μl of 5× cytotoxicity reagent (bis-AAF-R110) for 1 min by orbital shaking (700 rpm). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min followed by equilibration of the assay plate at room temperature (25 °C) for 5 min. Subsequently, 100 μl of ATP detection reagent was added to each well"

We explored the role of AGS3 in immune cell function by characterizing chemokine receptor signaling in leukocytes from mice lacking AGS3. No obvious differences in lymphocyte subsets were observed. Interestingly, however, AGS3-null B and T lymphocytes and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells exhibited significant chemotactic defects as well as reductions in chemokine-stimulated calcium mobilization and altered ERK and Akt activation.

Integration of signals emanating from chemokine receptors represents one of the most commonly used mechanisms for leukocyte distribution and recruitment to lymphoid organs and the periphery. Such signal integration involves not only the regulated expression of individual chemokine receptors and the stoichiometries of the core signaling triad of receptor, heterotrimeric G-protein, and effectors but also cell type-specific accessory proteins that modulate signals across this core signaling system. Such accessory proteins bestow upon leukocytes and other cells the ability to tightly control signaling pathways to maximize signal efficiency, strength, and duration while at the same time providing flexibility to quickly adapt to changes in environmental stimuli (1.Cho H.

GPR motif-containing proteins thus provide a novel mode of signal input to heterotrimeric G-proteins that may operate distinct from the superfamily of GPCRs and may also function as binding partners for Gαi subunits independent of heterotrimer formation. These theories have broad implications for signal processing and provide a mechanism for unexpected functions of G-proteins as signal transducers within the cell. A member of the Group II AGS proteins, AGS3 (gene name, G-protein signaling modulator-1 (Gpsm1)) 3In 2004, the Human Genome Organization (HUGO) committee classified the gene names for multiple GPR motif-containing proteins with the designation “G-protein signaling modulator (Gpsm) 1–4.” Therefore, by convention, the gene name for AGS3 is Gpsm1, and thus it is more appropriate to refer to the genotype of AGS3-null mice as Gpsm1−/−. We refer to the protein encoded by the Gpsm1 gene as AGS3. contains seven tetratricopeptide repeats, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and four G-protein regulatory (GPR)/GoLoco motifs, allowing AGS3 to simultaneously bind up to four Gαi-GDP subunits free of Gβγ.

Our goal in this study was to define the functional role of AGS3 in leukocytes, beginning with its role in chemokine receptor signal integration. Our data suggest that AGS3 assists in the integration of signals from the receptor to the chemotactic machinery, including calcium mobilization, ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation, and leukocyte motility. These data indicate key roles for AGS3 in the integration of chemokine receptor signaling and expand the functional repertoire of accessory proteins in the immune system. Recombinant mouse GM-CSF, CXCL12, and CCL19 were purchased from BioAbChem Inc. (Ladson, SC).

Wild-type and Gpsm1−/− female littermates at 6–12 weeks of age from Gpsm1+/− intercrosses were used. Gpsm1+/− breeding pairs were generated from backcrosses onto C57BL/6J mice for more than 12 generations. Tissues and lysates were prepared and processed for immunoblotting as described (31.Blumer J.B. Chandler L.J. Lanier S.M.

Single-cell suspensions from spleen and thymus were prepared from female mice (Gpsm1+/+ and Gpsm1−/− littermates) at 6 weeks of age by crushing freshly dissected tissues between frosted glass slides in PBS. After lysing red blood cells with ammonium-chloride-potassium (ACK) lysis buffer (170 mm NH4Cl, 170 mm Tris), cells were counted and washed with PBS with 1% BSA and 0.05% NaN3 (PBS-BSA). A total of 106 cells were first incubated with anti-FcγIII (CD16/CD32) for 30 min at 4 °C to block Fc receptors, and then cells were incubated with primary FITC or phycoerythrin-conjugated antibodies in PBS-BSA for 30 min at 4 °C (BD Pharmingen). Cells were washed twice in PBS-BSA, resuspended in 500 μl of PBS-BSA, and analyzed on a flow cytometer (BD Pharmingen). CD4 and CD8 mAbs were used to characterize thymus cell subsets. The following mAbs were used to characterize spleen cell subsets: total B cells (B220+, CD3−); follicular B cells (B220+, CD21intermediate+, CD23+); marginal zone B cells (B220+, CD21high+, CD23−); double positive T cells (CD4+, CD8+); and double negative T cells (CD4−, CD8−). Bone marrow cells from WT or Gpsm1−/− mouse femurs and tibiae were filtered through a 40-μm nylon cell strainer, red blood cells were lysed with ammonium-chloride-potassium lysis buffer, and cells were resuspended in DC media (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 20 ng/ml recombinant mouse GM-CSF) and plated 4–5 × 105 cells/ml in a 100-mm tissue culture dish. On day 4, 10 ml of fresh DC media was added to each dish. On day 8, nonadherent and loosely adherent cells were harvested, washed, and replated in fresh DC medium containing 10 ng/ml recombinant mouse GM-CSF to generate immature dendritic cells (iDC). On day 9, cells were treated with or without 200 ng/ml LPS for the indicated times or for 24 h to generate mature dendritic cells (mDC). Spleens of WT or Gpsm1−/− mice were gently crushed between frosted glass slides in serum-free RPMI. Red blood cells were lysed with ammonium-chloride-potassium lysis buffer, and splenocytes were washed in PBS (Ca2+-, Mg2+-free) supplemented with 0.1% BSA and 2 mm EDTA and then resuspended at 5 × 107 cells/ml or 1 × 108 cells/ml for subsequent B cell or T cell isolation, respectively. Cell isolation was performed according to Invitrogen Dynabeads protocol for untouched B cell isolation or negative T cell isolation. Corning Transwell 24-well inserts (6.5-mm diameter, 5.0-μm pore size) or 96-well inserts (5.0-μm pore size) were used for all chemotaxis assays. For dendritic cell chemotaxis, serum-free RPMI with or without 250 ng/ml CXCL12 or CCL19 was added to the lower chamber, and ∼3 × 106 cells/ml were loaded into the upper chamber. Where indicated, dendritic cells were preincubated with 10 μm gallein (final concentration) or vehicle (0.02% DMSO final concentration) in serum-free RPMI for 30 min at 37 °C prior to measuring chemotaxis. In these cases, 10 μm gallein (final concentration) and vehicle (0.02% DMSO final concentration) were included in both upper and lower chambers as described previously (32.Lehmann D.M. Seneviratne A.M. Smrcka A.V. Small molecule disruption of G protein βγ subunit signaling inhibits neutrophil chemotaxis and inflammation.Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 73: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). For lymphocytes, serum-free RPMI supplemented with 0.05 μm β-mercaptoethanol with or without 300 ng/ml CXCL12 or CCL19 was added to the lower chambers, and ∼1 × 107 lymphocytes/ml were added to the upper chamber. Chemotaxis chambers were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 20 h for dendritic cells and 5 h for lymphocytes. The upper chamber was then removed, and cells migrating to the lower chamber were counted. The percentage of cells migrating to chemokine was determined by subtracting the average cells migrating to vehicle alone and then comparing with the actual number of input cells. Freshly harvested splenocytes of WT and Gpsm1−/− mice were seeded into clear bottom, black-walled 96-well plates at 1 × 106 cells/well in 100 μl of serum-free, phenol red-free RPMI, and cells were serum-starved for at least 1 h. Cells were incubated in the Calcium 5 assay kit dye for 1 h at 37 °C, and then the plate was allowed to come to room temperature for 15 min prior to analysis. CXCL12 or CCL19 was added at a final concentration of 200 ng/ml by the FLIPRtetra instrument, and measurements were taken every second for at least 300 s. Bone marrow cells were harvested from WT and Gpsm1−/− female mice between 6 and 10 weeks of age and cultured to dendritic cells as described above. DCs were seeded at 2.5 × 105 cells/well and serum-starved for ∼1 h followed by incubation in the calcium dye for 1 h. CXCL12 was added at a final concentration of 200 ng/ml by the FLIPRtetra, and measurements, reported as relative light units, were taken every second for at least 300 s. Negative control and response over baseline corrections were applied using the ScreenWorks 3.1 software. Single-cell suspensions from spleen and thymus were prepared by crushing freshly dissected tissues between frosted glass slides in PBS. After lysing red blood cells with ice-cold 0.17 m NH4Cl, 0.17 m Tris for 5 min at room temperature followed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at room temperature, cells were pelleted and resuspended in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) on ice for 20 min followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by a Pierce BCA protein assay. Protein samples were loaded on denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gels and then were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for immunoblotting as described (31.Blumer J.B. Chandler L.J.

Cell pellets processed for phosphorylated proteins were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 200 μm Na3VO4) on ice for 20 min followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes and immunoblotted for anti-phospho-Akt (Ser483) (Life Technologies), anti-phospho-ERK (Tyr402) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), or total ERK (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and total Akt (Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA) antibodies. Densitometric quantification of the immunoblotted bands was performed using ImageJ densitometry software (Version 1.46r, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Selected bands were quantified based on their relative intensities and normalized to total ERK or total Akt. Increasing evidence indicates a growing number of cellular and physiological roles for accessory proteins such as AGS3 and other proteins containing the GPR motif in dynamic signaling systems such as the central nervous system (CNS) where signal modulation and adaptation of G-protein signaling systems are key to the responsiveness of the system (19.Bowers M.S.

However, the mechanisms of susceptibility to oxidant stress in neonatal lungs are not completely understood. We evaluated the role of genetic background in response to oxidant stress in the neonatal lung by exposing mice from 36 inbred strains to hyperoxia (95% O2) for 72 h after birth. Hyperoxia-induced lung injury was evaluated by using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) analysis and pathology. Statistically significant interstrain variation was found for BALF inflammatory cells and protein (heritability estimates range: 33.6-55.7%). Genome-wide association mapping using injury phenotypes identified quantitative trait loci (QTLs) on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7. Comparative mapping of the chromosome 6 QTLs identified Chrm2 (cholinergic receptor, muscarinic 2, cardiac) as a candidate susceptibility gene, and mouse strains with a nonsynonymous coding single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in Chrm2 that causes an amino acid substitution (P265L) had significantly reduced hyperoxia-induced inflammation compared to strains without the SNP. Further, hyperoxia-induced lung injury was significantly reduced in neonatal mice with targeted deletion of Chrm2, relative to wild-type controls. This study has important implications for understanding the mechanisms of oxidative lung injury in neonates."

We demonstrated that in addition to the 38-kDa monomer of the MGAT2 enzyme predicted by its peptide sequence, a 76-kDa moiety was detected in SDS-PAGE without reducing agent and heat inactivation. The 76-kDa MGAT2 moiety was greatly enhanced by treatment with a cross-linking reagent in intact cells. Additionally, the cross-linking reagent dose-dependently yielded a band corresponding to the tetramer (152 kDa) in SDS-PAGE, suggesting that the MGAT2 enzyme primarily functions as a homotetrameric protein and as a tetrameric protein. Likewise, DGAT1 also forms a homodimer under nondenaturing conditions. When co-expressed in COS-7 cells, MGAT2 heterodimerized with DGAT1 without treatment with a cross-linking reagent. MGAT2 also co-eluted with DGAT1 on a gel filtration column, suggesting that the two enzymes form a complex in intact cells. In contrast, MGAT2 did not heterodimerize with DGAT2 when co-expressed in COS-7 cells, despite high sequence homology between the two enzymes. Furthermore, systematic deletion analysis demonstrates that N-terminal amino acids 35–80 of DGAT1, but not a signal peptide at the N terminus of MGAT2, is required for the heterodimerization.

https://openalex.org/W2089529090,"Termites and their symbiotic protists have established a prominent dual lignocellulolytic system, which can be applied to the biorefinery process. One of the major components of lignocellulose from conifers is glucomannan, which comprises a heterogeneous combination of β-1,4-linked mannose and glucose. Mannanases are known to hydrolyze the internal linkage of the glucomannan backbone, but the specific mechanism by which they recognize and accommodate heteropolysaccharides is currently unclear. Here, we report biochemical and structural analyses of glycoside hydrolase family 26 mannanase C (RsMan26C) from a symbiotic protist of the termite Reticulitermes speratus. RsMan26C was characterized based on its catalytic efficiency toward glucomannan, compared with pure mannan. The crystal structure of RsMan26C complexed with gluco-manno-oligosaccharide(s) explained its specificities for glucose and mannose at subsites -5 and -2, respectively, in addition to accommodation of both glucose and mannose at subsites -3 and -4. RsMan26C has a long open cleft with a hydrophobic platform of Trp(94) at subsite -5, facilitating enzyme binding to polysaccharides. Notably, a unique oxidized Met(85) specifically interacts with the equatorial O-2 of glucose at subsite -3. Our results collectively indicate that specific recognition and accommodation of glucose at the distal negative subsites confers efficient degradation of the heteropolysaccharide by mannanase."
https://openalex.org/W2000668548,"The cysteine protease inhibitor cystatin C is thought to be secreted by most cells and eliminated in the kidneys, so its concentration in plasma is diagnostic of kidney function. Low extracellular cystatin C is linked to pathologic protease activity in cancer, arthritis, atherosclerosis, aortic aneurism, and emphysema. Cystatin C forms non-inhibitory dimers and aggregates by a mechanism known as domain swapping, a property that reportedly protects against Alzheimer disease but can also cause amyloid angiopathy. Despite these clinical associations, little is known about the regulation of cystatin C production, dimerization, and secretion. We show that hematopoietic cells are major contributors to extracellular cystatin C levels in healthy mice. Among these cells, macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) are the predominant producers of cystatin C. Both cell types synthesize monomeric and dimeric cystatin C in vivo, but only secrete monomer. Dimerization occurs co-translationally in the endoplasmic reticulum and is regulated by the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from mitochondria. Drugs or stimuli that reduce the intracellular concentration of ROS inhibit cystatin C dimerization. The extracellular concentration of inhibitory cystatin C is thus partly dependent on the abundance of macrophages and DC, and the ROS levels. These results have implications for the diagnostic use of serum cystatin C as a marker of kidney function during inflammatory processes that induce changes in DC or macrophage abundance. They also suggest an important role for macrophages, DC, and ROS in diseases associated with the protease inhibitory activity or amyloidogenic properties of cystatin C."
https://openalex.org/W2041251801,"The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is effective in hematologic malignancies such as multiple myeloma but has little activity against solid tumors, acts covalently, and is associated with undesired side effects. Therefore, noncovalent inhibitors that are less toxic and more effective against solid tumors are desirable. Structure activity relationship studies led to the discovery of PI-1840, a potent and selective inhibitor for chymotrypsin-like (CT-L) (IC50 value = 27 ± 0.14 nm) over trypsin-like and peptidylglutamyl peptide hydrolyzing (IC50 values >100 μm) activities of the proteasome. Furthermore, PI-1840 is over 100-fold more selective for the constitutive proteasome over the immunoproteasome. Mass spectrometry and dialysis studies demonstrate that PI-1840 is a noncovalent and rapidly reversible CT-L inhibitor. In intact cancer cells, PI-1840 inhibits CT-L activity, induces the accumulation of proteasome substrates p27, Bax, and IκB-α, inhibits survival pathways and viability, and induces apoptosis. Furthermore, PI-1840 sensitizes human cancer cells to the mdm2/p53 disruptor, nutlin, and to the pan-Bcl-2 antagonist BH3-M6. Finally, in vivo, PI-1840 but not bortezomib suppresses the growth in nude mice of human breast tumor xenografts.

The clearance of apoptotic cells (i.e. efferocytosis) is a key modulator of the immune response that is inhibited by the RhoA/ROCK pathway. Because efferocytosis is defective in many of the same illnesses where 5-HT has been implicated in disease pathogenesis, we hypothesized that 5-HT would suppress efferocytosis via activation of RhoA/ROCK. The effect of 5-HT on efferocytosis was examined in murine peritoneal and human alveolar macrophages, and its mechanisms were investigated using pharmacologic blockade and genetic deletion. 5-HT impaired efferocytosis by murine peritoneal macrophages and human alveolar macrophages. 5-HT increased phosphorylation of myosin phosphatase subunit 1 (Mypt-1), a known ROCK target, and inhibitors of RhoA and ROCK reversed the suppressive effect of 5-HT on efferocytosis. Peritoneal macrophages expressed the 5-HT transporter and 5-HT receptors (R) 2a, 2b, but not 2c.

LolA transports lipoproteins through the periplasm to LolB on outer membranes. LolB is itself a lipoprotein anchored to outer membranes, although the membrane anchor is functionally dispensable. LolB then localizes lipoproteins to outer membranes through largely unknown mechanisms. The crystal structure of LolB is similar to that of LolA, and it possesses a hydrophobic cavity that accommodates acyl chains of lipoproteins. To elucidate the molecular function of LolB, a periplasmic version of LolB, mLolB, was mutagenized at various conserved residues. Despite the lack of acyl chains, most defective mutants were insoluble. However, a derivative with glutamate in place of leucine 68 was soluble and unable to localize lipoproteins to outer membranes. This leucine is present in a loop protruding from mLolB into an aqueous environment, and no analogous loop is present in LolA. Thus, leucine 68 was replaced with other residues. Replacement by acidic, but not hydrophobic, residues generated for the first time mLolB derivatives that can accept but cannot localize lipoproteins to outer membranes. Moreover, deletion of the leucine with neighboring residues impaired the lipoprotein receptor activity. Based on these observations, the roles of the protruding loop of LolB in the last step of lipoprotein sorting are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2094496775,"Bacillus cereus is often associated with mild to moderate gastroenteritis; however, some recent isolates cause inhalational anthrax-like diseases and death. These potential emerging human pathogens express multiple virulence factors. B. cereus strain G9241 expresses anthrax toxin, several polysaccharide capsules, and the novel ADP-ribosyltransferase, Certhrax. In this study, we show that Certhrax ADP-ribosylates Arg-433 of vinculin, a protein that coordinates actin cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix interactions. ADP-ribosylation of vinculin disrupted focal adhesion complexes and redistributed vinculin to the cytoplasm. Exogenous vinculin rescued these phenotypes. This provides a mechanism for strain G9241 to breach host barrier defenses and promote bacterial growth and spread. Certhrax is the first bacterial toxin to add a post-translational modification to vinculin to disrupt the actin cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W1966677882,"Dps (DNA-binding protein from starved cells) are dodecameric assemblies belonging to the ferritin family that can bind DNA, carry out ferroxidation, and store iron in their shells. The ferritin-like trimeric pore harbors the channel for the entry and exit of iron. By representing the structure of Dps as a network we have identified a charge-driven interface formed by a histidine aspartate cluster at the pore interface unique to Mycobacterium smegmatis Dps protein, MsDps2. Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to generate mutants to disrupt the charged interactions. Kinetics of iron uptake/release of the wild type and mutants were compared. Crystal structures were solved at a resolution of 1.8-2.2 Å for the various mutants to compare structural alterations vis à vis the wild type protein. The substitutions at the pore interface resulted in alterations in the side chain conformations leading to an overall weakening of the interface network, especially in cases of substitutions that alter the charge at the pore interface. Contrary to earlier findings where conserved aspartate residues were found crucial for iron release, we propose here that in the case of MsDps2, it is the interplay of negative-positive potentials at the pore that enables proper functioning of the protein. In similar studies in ferritins, negative and positive patches near the iron exit pore were found to be important in iron uptake/release kinetics. The unique ionic cluster in MsDps2 makes it a suitable candidate to act as nano-delivery vehicle, as these gated pores can be manipulated to exhibit conformations allowing for slow or fast rates of iron release."

FANCJ is a DNA helicase that is genetically linked to Fanconi anemia, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer. Here, we characterized two Fanconi anemia patient mutations, R251C and Q255H, that are localized in helicase motif Ia. Our genetic complementation analysis revealed that both the R251C and Q255H alleles failed to rescue cisplatin sensitivity of a FANCJ null cell line as detected by cell survival or γ-H2AX foci formation. Furthermore, our biochemical assays demonstrated that both purified recombinant proteins abolished DNA helicase activity and failed to disrupt the DNA-protein complex. Intriguingly, R251C impaired DNA binding ability to single-strand DNA and double-strand DNA, whereas Q255H retained higher binding activity to these DNA substrates compared with wild-type FANCJ protein. Consequently, R251C abolished its DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity, whereas Q255H retained normal ATPase activity. Physically, R251C had reduced ATP binding ability, whereas Q255H had normal ATP binding ability and could translocate on single-strand DNA. Although both proteins were recruited to damage sites in our laser-activated confocal assays, they lost their DNA repair function, which explains why they exerted a domain negative effect when expressed in a wild-type background. Taken together, our work not only reveals the structural function of helicase motif Ia but also provides the molecular pathology of FANCJ in related diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2039218081,"Hedgehog (Hh) signaling requires regulation of the receptor Patched-1 (Ptch1), which, in turn, regulates Smoothened activity (canonical Hh signaling) as well as other non-canonical signaling pathways. The mutant Ptch1 allele mesenchymal dysplasia (mes), which truncates the Ptch1 C terminus, produces a limited spectrum of developmental defects in mice as well as deregulation of canonical Hh signaling in some, but not all, affected tissues. Paradoxically, mes suppresses canonical Hh signaling and binds to Hh ligands with an affinity similar to wild-type mouse Ptch1 (mPtch1). We characterized the distinct activities of the mes variant of mPtch1 mediating Hh signaling through both canonical and non-canonical pathways. We demonstrated that mPtch1 bound c-src in an Hh-regulated manner. Stimulation with Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) of primary mammary mesenchymal cells from wild-type and mes animals activated Erk1/2. Although Shh activated c-src in wild-type cells, c-src was constitutively activated in mes mesenchymal cells. Transient assays showed that wild-type mPtch1, mes, or mPtch1 lacking the C terminus repressed Hh signaling in Ptch1-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts and that repression was reversed by Shh, revealing that the C terminus was dispensable for mPtch1-dependent regulation of canonical Hh signaling. In contrast to these transient assays, constitutively high levels of mGli1 but not mPtch1 were present in primary mammary mesenchymal cells from mes mice, whereas the expression of mPtch1 was similarly induced in both mes and wild-type cells. These data define a novel signal transduction pathway involving c-src that is activated by the Hh ligands and reveals the requirement for the C terminus of Ptch in regulation of canonical and non-canonical Hh signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2071295077,"The replication fork temporarily stalls when encountering an obstacle on the DNA, and replication resumes after the barrier is removed. Simultaneously, activation of the replication checkpoint delays the progression of S phase and inhibits late origin firing. Camptothecin (CPT), a topoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitor, acts as a DNA replication barrier by inducing the covalent retention of Top1 on DNA. The Timeless-Tipin complex, a component of the replication fork machinery, plays a role in replication checkpoint activation and stabilization of the replication fork. However, the role of the Timeless-Tipin complex in overcoming the CPT-induced replication block remains elusive. Here, we generated viable TIPIN gene knock-out (KO) DT40 cells showing delayed S phase progression and increased cell death. TIPIN KO cells were hypersensitive to CPT. However, homologous recombination and replication checkpoint were activated normally, whereas DNA synthesis activity was markedly decreased in CPT-treated TIPIN KO cells. Proteasome-dependent degradation of chromatin-bound Top1 was induced in TIPIN KO cells upon CPT treatment, and pretreatment with aphidicolin, a DNA polymerase inhibitor, suppressed both CPT sensitivity and Top1 degradation. Taken together, our data indicate that replication forks formed without Tipin may collide at a high rate with Top1 retained on DNA by CPT treatment, leading to CPT hypersensitivity and Top1 degradation in TIPIN KO cells."

Deretic V. Microbial pathogenesis in cystic fibrosis: Mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia.Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 539-574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3711-3720Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). One of these is AlgB, which was shown to serve as a negative regulator of alginate production (5.Damron F.H. Qiu D.

Communication modules in bacterial signaling proteins.Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 71-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). The cognate sensor kinase of AlgB is KinB (GI:15600677), which is a histidine kinase (HK) 3The abbreviations used are: HKhistidine kinaseSDsensor domainTCStwo-component systemMan-6-Pβ-d-mannose 6-phosphateFru-6-Pβ-d-fructose 6-phosphateSeMetseleno-methioniner.m.s.d.root mean square deviationBLIbiolayer interferometryDSFdifferential scanning fluorimetryDLSdynamic light scatteringPDBProtein Data BankPASPer-Arnt-SimSADsingle-wavelength anomalous diffractionLSleast squares.

Similar to many HKs, KinB, at its N terminus, has a periplasmic sensor domain (KinB-SD) (∼120 amino acids) flanked by two transmembrane helices that anchor it to the membrane (7.Ma S. Wozniak D.J. Ohman D.E. Identification of the histidine protein kinase KinB in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and its phosphorylation of the alginate regulator algB.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17952-17960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The sensor domain (SD) is unique to the Pseudomonas genus and has no significant sequence similarity with any other known proteins. Within the different strains of P. aeruginosa, the sequence identities are larger than 85%. The sequence identity with other members of the Pseudomonas genus is between 28 and 35%. After the second transmembrane helix, the cytoplasmic portion of KinB is a regular HK that is composed of several domains as follows: (i) a histidine kinases, adenyl cyclases, methyl-accepting proteins, and phosphatases (HAMP) domain; (ii) Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain, and (iii) a His-kinase-A (phosphoacceptor) core containing a specific histidine-containing dimerization subdomain and a kinase subdomain. In alginate regulation, it is believed that the KinB-AlgB (HK-RR) pair works similarly to other two-component systems (TCSs) in signal relay from the periplasm to cytoplasm, such as the PhoQ-PhoP and PmrB-PmrA pairs among others found in P. aeruginosa (8.Gooderham W.J. Hancock R.E. Regulation of virulence and antibiotic resistance by two-component regulatory systems in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2009; 33: 279-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). A typical TCS signaling mechanism involves the periplasmic KinB-SD receiving an environmental signal. Binding a signal molecule causes a structural change in the SD that is transmitted across the membrane resulting in the autophosphorylation of the specific histidine in the dimerization subdomain of the HK core. The phosphate is then transferred to a specific aspartate of the response regulator, AlgB. Subsequently, AlgB mediates AlgW-dependent MucA proteolysis leading to the reduction of alginate biosynthesis (5.Damron F.H. Qiu D. Yu H.D. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa sensor kinase KinB negatively controls alginate production through AlgW-dependent MucA proteolysis.J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 2285-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recent studies have significantly expanded the function of KinB. It was shown that in addition to alginate synthesis down-regulation, KinB seems to control a large number of genes coding for virulence factors that are important to the development of acute pneumonia and causes a switch between chronic and acute infection (9.Damron F.H. Owings J.P. Okkotsu Y. Varga J.J. Schurr J.R. Goldberg J.B. Schurr M.J. Yu H.D. Analysis of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa regulon controlled by the sensor kinase KinB and σ factor RpoN.J. Bacteriol. 2012; 194: 1317-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 10.Chand N.S. Hung D.T. The two-component sensor kinase KinB acts as a non-canonical switch between acute and chronic infection.Virulence. 2011; 2: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). KinB also appears to be essential in acute infections in zebrafish embryos and other virulence-associated phenotypes, such as quorum sensing, biofilm formation, and motility (11.Chand N.S. Lee J.S. Clatworthy A.E. Golas A.J. Smith R.S. Hung D.T. The sensor kinase KinB regulates virulence in acute Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection.J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 2989-2999Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These phenotypes, however, are independent of KinB's kinase activity and its response regulator AlgB, indicating an atypical, noncanonical TCS signaling mechanism (10.Chand N.S. Hung D.T. The two-component sensor kinase KinB acts as a non-canonical switch between acute and chronic infection.Virulence. 2011; 2: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Moreover, one report suggested that in the regulation of virulence, KinB functions as a phosphatase to dephosphorylate AlgB instead of an AlgB kinase (12.Chand N.S. Clatworthy A.E. Hung D.T. The two-component sensor KinB acts as a phosphatase to regulate Pseudomonas aeruginosa Virulence.J. Bacteriol. 2012; 194: 6537-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether these KinB functions involve signaling molecule(s). All of these data added complexity to the regulatory activities of KinB and the signal transduction pathways. It is believed that a part of the intricacy may involve possible diverse responses of SDs to different signaling molecules. Despite these recent discoveries, the KinB-SD and its signaling molecule(s) have remained uncharacterized. Understanding the KinB signal transduction mechanism and identifying the signaling molecules may be important for developing cystic fibrosis treatments. The HK SDs of TCSs have been investigated previously (13.Gao R. Stock A.M. Biological insights from structures of two-component proteins.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 63: 133-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 14.Cheung J. Hendrickson W.A. Sensor domains of two-component regulatory systems.Curr. Opin.

Biosyst. 2011; 7: 1388-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These domains show significant sequence diversity, and it is believed that they can recognize a wide variety of chemical signals. Upon binding a ligand, the information is transmitted into the cell, initiating a kinase response. The majority of previously characterized SDs adopt two main types of structural scaffolds, the PAS-like and four-helix bundle domains. A PAS-like (16.Reinelt S. Hofmann E. Gerharz T. Bott M.

Hendrickson W.A. Structural analysis of sensor domains from the TMAO-responsive histidine kinase receptor TorS.Structure. 2009; 17: 1195-1204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This domain is believed to be a ubiquitous sensor module for HKs, and it contributes conserved residues to the dimerization interface (27.Ulrich L.E. Zhulin I.B. Four-helix bundle: A ubiquitous sensory module in prokaryotic signal transduction.Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: iii45-iii48Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In both PAS-like and four-helix bundle SDs, a conformational change in the dimer upon signaling molecule binding is recognized as a necessary and key step in the signal transduction from the periplasmic to the cytoplasmic portion of TCSs. Other structural scaffolds for HK have also been observed. Hendrickson and co-workers (28.Cheung J. Le-Khac M. Hendrickson W.A.

A double periplasmic solute-binding protein sensor domain has also been identified and described in the sensor kinase BvgS of the TCS BvgAS (29.Herrou J. Bompard C. Wintjens R. Dupr E. Willery E. Villeret V. Locht C. Antoine R. Jacob-Dubuisson F. Periplasmic domain of the sensor-kinase BvgS reveals a new paradigm for the Venus flytrap mechanism.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Horizon Bioscience, Norfolk, United Kingdom2007: 47-68Google Scholar). Recently, crystal structures of a SD consisting of two seven-blade β-propellers and an Ig-like fold have also been reported from a Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron hybrid TCS, which contains all the domains of a typical HK in a single polypeptide (31.Lowe E.C. Basl A. Czjzek M. Firbank S.J. Bolam D.N. A scissor blade-like closing mechanism implicated in transmembrane signaling in a Bacteroides hybrid two-component system.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 7298-7303Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The discovery of a periplasmic solute-binding protein, a seven-blade β-propeller, and an Ig-like SD expands the structural modules used for signaling in TCSs and shows a more diverse set of signaling molecule receptors associated with HKs. Some SDs are found across many species and super-kingdoms, but some are unique to a specific genus. Pseudomonas KinB-SDs belong to the latter group and show a unique sequence. A secondary structure prediction suggests an all-helical structure placing it in a four-helix bundle subgroup. However, the conserved residues found in four-helix bundle SDs are not present (27.Ulrich L.E. Zhulin I.B. Four-helix bundle: A ubiquitous sensory module in prokaryotic signal transduction.Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: iii45-iii48Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Initially, KinB was aligned and compared with a SD of HK PhoR from Bacillus subtilis, with which it shares 31% amino acid sequence identity and 59% similarity (7.Ma S. Wozniak D.J. Ohman D.E. Identification of the histidine protein kinase KinB in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and its phosphorylation of the alginate regulator algB.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17952-17960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A recently reported PhoR SD structure revealed an α/β PAS-like fold (24.Chang C. Tesar C. Gu M. Babnigg G. Joachimiak A. Pokkuluri P.R. Szurmant H. Schiffer M. Extracytoplasmic PAS-like domains are common in signal transduction proteins.J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 1156-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Here, we present high resolution crystal structures of the KinB-SD in a ligand-free form and a complex with a bound phosphate. These structures reveal an all-helical four-helix bundle structure, consistent with secondary structure predictions, forming an atypical helix-swapped dimer. Interestingly, KinB sequence similarity to PhoR suggests that PAS-like SDs may be evolutionally related. Several site-directed mutations were introduced to confirm helix swapping, and structures of R60L and R60E mutants were determined. Inspired by the unique cavity formed on the interface between two monomers where the phosphate group was found, in silico ligand screening was performed. Among the top scoring ligands were several monophosphorylated sugars, including β-d-fructose 6-phosphate (Fru-6-P) and β-d-mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P), a precursor and an intermediate of alginate synthesis, respectively (32.Rocchetta H.L.

Several assays were performed to evaluate ligand binding and the potential impact on KinB and its structure and function. The combination of the structural, mutagenesis, computational, and biophysical data provides clues to potential signaling molecule(s) of the KinB and a possible signal transduction mechanism. A portion of the P. aeruginosa PAO1 kinB gene (Gln-42 to Ala-168) corresponding to the periplasmic SD was cloned into the pMCSG19 vector. The gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21. The cells were grown at 37 °C in enriched M9 medium containing seleno-methionine (SeMet) under conditions known to inhibit methionine biosynthesis (33.Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. Atomic structures of the human immunophilin FKBP-12 complexes with FK506 and rapamycin.J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). The SeMet-labeled KinB-SD was purified from the E. coli cells using nickel-affinity chromatography (34.Kim Y. Dementieva I. Zhou M. Wu R. Lezondra L. Quartey P. Joachimiak G. Korolev O. Li H. Joachimiak A. Automation of protein purification for structural genomics.J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2004; 5: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The protein was concentrated using an Amicon Ultra 3K centrifugal filter device (Millipore Inc.) in 20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 250 mm NaCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). The protein showed a final yield of about 40 mg/liter culture. Site-directed mutations of R60A, R60L, and R60E were created by the PIPE cloning method (35.Klock H.E. Lesley S.A. The polymerase incomplete primer extension (PIPE) method applied to high-throughput cloning and site-directed mutagenesis.Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 498: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The plasmid mentioned above was used as the template; primers were added to a final concentration of 0.4 μm, and mutagenesis was performed in a final volume of 50 μl using PfuUltra Hotstart PCR Master Mix (Stratagene). The procedure from the subsequent transformation of PCR products to mutant expression and purification was the same as described above for wild-type KinB-SD. Plasmids of mutated proteins were sequenced to confirm the presence of mutations. The native avi-tagged KinB-SD utilized in a biolayer interferometry (BLI) study using an Octet RED system (FortéBIO) was created by cloning the same wild-type kinB-SD gene into the pMCSG62 vector, which contains an avi tag (36.Eschenfeldt W.H. Makowska-Grzyska M. Stols L. Donnelly M.I. Jedrzejczak R. Joachimiak A. New LIC vectors for production of proteins from genes containing rare codons.J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2013; 14: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The sequence confirmation, plasmid transformation, protein expression, and purification of the avi-tagged KinB-SD were the same as described for the native KinB-SD with the following exceptions: the cells were grown in LB containing 40 mm K2HPO4, and the protein was purified and concentrated in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, and 2 mm DTT. Size exclusion chromatography of the wild-type KinB-SD was performed on a Superdex 200 10/300GL column using an ÄKTA FPLC (GE Healthcare). The column was pre-equilibrated with the crystallization buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT) and calibrated with premixed protein standards, which included ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), conalbumin (75 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), and blue dextran (2,000 kDa). The chromatography was carried out at room temperature with a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min using a 100-μl protein sample at a concentration of 47.5 mg/ml. The subsequent size exclusion chromatography of wild-type KinB and point mutants (R60A, R60L, and R60E) was performed on an SRT SEC-150 column (Sepax Technologies) connected to a Dionex HPLC equipped with a temperature-controlled autosampler housing two 96-well plate sample racks, a GP50 gradient pump, and a PDA-100 photodiode array detector (Thermo Scientific). The chromatography runs were carried out at room temperature with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Calibration of the SRT SEC-150 column was performed with protein standards as described above. The proteins were screened for crystallization conditions with the help of a Mosquito nanoliter liquid handler (TTP LabTech) using the sitting drop vapor diffusion technique in 96-well CrystalQuick plates (Greiner). For each condition, 0.4 μl of protein (at 47.5 mg/ml) and 0.4 μl of crystallization formulation were mixed; the mixture was equilibrated against 140 μl of the crystallization solution in each reservoir well. The crystallization screens used were Index (Hampton Research), ANL-1 (Qiagen), and ANL-2 (Qiagen) at two temperatures, 4 and 24 °C. Diffraction quality crystals appeared under multiple conditions including the following: 1) 1.6 m sodium dihydrogen phosphate, 0.1 m phosphate-citrate, pH 4.2, and 0.4 m di-potassium hydrogen phosphate at 24 °C; 2) 0.1 m ammonium acetate, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.6, 30% PEG 4000, and 15% glycerol at 24 °C. Prior to data collection, the crystals were treated with cryoprotectants and cryocooled directly in liquid nitrogen. Co-crystallization trials with monophosphorylated sugars, including Fru-6-P and Man-6-P, were performed under crystallization condition 1 described above and supplemented with 10% of the sugars. A single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) data set was collected near the selenium absorption peak (12.66 keV) at 100 K from each type of KinB-SD crystal. All data were obtained at the 19-ID beamline of the Structural Biology Center at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory using the program SBCcollect (37.Rosenbaum G. Alkire R.W. Evans G. Rotella F.J. Lazarski K. Zhang R.G. Ginell S.L. Duke N. Naday I. Lazarz J. Molitsky M.J. Keefe L. Gonczy J. Rock L. Sanishvili R. Walsh M.A. Westbrook E. Joachimiak A. The structural biology center 19ID undulator beamline: facility specifications and protein crystallographic results.J. Synchrotron Radiat. 2006; 13: 30-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The intensities of each data set were integrated and scaled with the HKL3000 program suite (Table 1) (38.Minor W. Cymborowski M. Otwinowski Z. Chruszcz M. HKL-3000: the integration of data reduction and structure solution–From diffraction images to an initial model in minutes.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar). For the phosphate-bound KinB-SD crystal containing SeMet-labeled protein, two molecules with four SeMet residues were expected in one asymmetric unit. Heavy atom sites were located using the program SHELXD (39.Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Substructure solution with SHELXD.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar), and four selenium sites were found and used for phasing with the program MLPHARE (40.The CCP4 suite: programs for protein crystallography.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19747) Google Scholar). After density modification (40.The CCP4 suite: programs for protein crystallography.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19747) Google Scholar), a partial model comprised of 180 residues in two chains (71% of a dimer) with 121 side chains was built in three cycles of Arp/wArp (41.Cohen S.X. Morris R.J. Fernandez F.J. Ben Jelloul M. Kakaris M. Parthasarathy V. Lamzin V.S. Kleywegt G.J. Perrakis A. Towards complete validated models in the next generation of ARP/wARP.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2222-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) model building. All of the above programs are integrated within the program suite HKL3000 (38.Minor W. Cymborowski M. Otwinowski Z. Chruszcz M. HKL-3000: the integration of data reduction and structure solution–From diffraction images to an initial model in minutes.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar). The model was completed manually using the program COOT (42.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23213) Google Scholar). The final model, a helix-swapped all-helical dimer of the KinB-SD, was refined using the program Phenix.refine (Table 1) (43.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Refinement of macromolecular structures by the maximum-likelihood method.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13850) Google Scholar). The structure of the ligand-free crystal was determined using the molecular replacement method (44.Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Molecular replacement with MOLREP.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 22-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (2699) Google Scholar). The search template used was the KinB-SD swapped dimer with the connecting loops truncated. Four copies of the swapped dimers were located in the asymmetric units of the crystal. After several cycles of refinement, the connecting loops between the helices were rebuilt using Fo − Fc difference electron density maps. Final refinement was carried out with the program Phenix.refine (Table 1) (43.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Refinement of macromolecular structures by the maximum-likelihood method.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13850) Google Scholar). The structure of mutant R60L was determined using the same molecular replacement approach as described for the ligand-free KinB-SD (Table 1). The structure of mutant R60E was determined using the same SeMet SAD phasing approach as described for the structure of SeMe"
https://openalex.org/W2018360853,"Experiments were carried out to probe the details of the hydration-initiated hydrolysis catalyzed by the Clostridium perfringens unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase of glycoside hydrolase family 88 in the CAZy classification system. Direct 1H NMR monitoring of the enzymatic reaction detected no accumulated reaction intermediates in solution, suggesting that rearrangement of the initial hydration product occurs on-enzyme. An attempt at mechanism-based trapping of on-enzyme intermediates using a 1,1-difluoro-substrate was unsuccessful because the probe was too deactivated to be turned over by the enzyme. Kinetic isotope effects arising from deuterium-for-hydrogen substitution at carbons 1 and 4 provide evidence for separate first-irreversible and overall rate-determining steps in the hydration reaction, with two potential mechanisms proposed to explain these results. Based on the positioning of catalytic residues in the enzyme active site, the lack of efficient turnover of a 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-substrate, and several unsuccessful attempts at confirmation of a simpler mechanism involving a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate, the most plausible mechanism is one involving an intermediate bearing an epoxide on carbons 1 and 2.Background: Unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolases (UGL) from GH88 are bacterial enzymes involved in the degradation of glycosaminoglycans and are virulence factors.Results: Mechanistic data inconsistent with the currently accepted mechanism of UGL are presented.Conclusion: A revised mechanism is proposed to explain all mechanistic data published to date.Significance: Understanding of the mechanism of UGL may allow design of bacteriostatic agents.

https://openalex.org/W2028182444,"The maintenance of genome integrity is regulated in part by chromatin structure and factors involved in the DNA damage response pathway. Nucleosome assembly is a highly regulated process that restores chromatin structure after DNA replication, DNA repair, and gene transcription. During S phase the histone chaperones Asf1, CAF-1, and Rtt106 coordinate to deposit newly synthesized histones H3-H4 onto replicated DNA in budding yeast. Here we describe synthetic genetic interactions between RTT106 and the DDC1-MEC3-RAD17 (9-1-1) complex, a sliding clamp functioning in the S phase DNA damage and replication checkpoint response, upon treatment with DNA damaging agents. The DNA damage sensitivity of rad17Δ rtt106Δ cells depends on the function of Rtt106 in nucleosome assembly. Epistasis analysis reveals that 9-1-1 complex components interact with multiple DNA replication-coupled nucleosome assembly factors, including Rtt106, CAF-1, and lysine residues of H3-H4. Furthermore, rad17Δ cells exhibit defects in the deposition of newly synthesized H3-H4 onto replicated DNA. Finally, deletion of RAD17 results in increased association of Asf1 with checkpoint kinase Rad53, which may lead to the observed reduction in Asf1-H3 interaction in rad17Δ mutant cells. In addition, we observed that the interaction between histone H3-H4 with histone chaperone CAF-1 or Rtt106 increases in cells lacking Rad17. These results support the idea that the 9-1-1 checkpoint protein regulates DNA replication-coupled nucleosome assembly in part through regulating histone-histone chaperone interactions."
