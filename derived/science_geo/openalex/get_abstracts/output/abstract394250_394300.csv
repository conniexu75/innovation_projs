https://openalex.org/W1974140746,"Inflammatory mechanisms influence tumorigenesis and metastatic progression even in cancers whose aetiology does not involve pre-existing inflammation or infection, such as breast and prostate cancers. For instance, prostate cancer metastasis is associated with the infiltration of lymphocytes into advanced tumours and the upregulation of two tumour-necrosis-factor family members: receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (RANK) ligand (RANKL) and lymphotoxin. But the source of RANKL and its role in metastasis have not been established. RANKL and its receptor RANK control the proliferation of mammary lobuloalveolar cells during pregnancy through inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB (IκB) kinase-α (IKK-α), a protein kinase that is needed for the self-renewal of mammary cancer progenitors and for prostate cancer metastasis. We therefore examined whether RANKL, RANK and IKK-α are also involved in mammary/breast cancer metastasis. Indeed, RANK signalling in mammary carcinoma cells that overexpress the proto-oncogene Erbb2 (also known as Neu), which is frequently amplified in metastatic human breast cancers, was important for pulmonary metastasis. Metastatic spread of Erbb2-transformed carcinoma cells also required CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells, whose major pro-metastatic function was RANKL production. Most RANKL-producing T cells expressed forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), a transcription factor produced by regulatory T cells, and were located next to smooth muscle actin (SMA)(+) stromal cells in mouse and human breast cancers. The dependence of pulmonary metastasis on T cells was replaceable by exogenous RANKL, which also stimulated pulmonary metastasis of RANK(+) human breast cancer cells. These results are consistent with the adverse impact of tumour-infiltrating CD4(+) or FOXP3(+) T cells on human breast cancer prognosis and suggest that the targeting of RANKL-RANK can be used in conjunction with the therapeutic elimination of primary breast tumours to prevent recurrent metastatic disease."

https://openalex.org/W2042130020,"Alzheimer disease is characterized by accumulation of the β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) generated by β- and γ-secretase processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). The intake of the polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has been associated with decreased amyloid deposition and a reduced risk in Alzheimer disease in several epidemiological trials; however, the exact underlying molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here, we systematically investigate the effect of DHA on amyloidogenic and nonamyloidogenic APP processing and the potential cross-links to cholesterol metabolism in vivo and in vitro. DHA reduces amyloidogenic processing by decreasing β- and γ-secretase activity, whereas the expression and protein levels of BACE1 and presenilin1 remain unchanged. In addition, DHA increases protein stability of α-secretase resulting in increased nonamyloidogenic processing. Besides the known effect of DHA to decrease cholesterol de novo synthesis, we found cholesterol distribution in plasma membrane to be altered. In the presence of DHA, cholesterol shifts from raft to non-raft domains, and this is accompanied by a shift in γ-secretase activity and presenilin1 protein levels. Taken together, DHA directs amyloidogenic processing of APP toward nonamyloidogenic processing, effectively reducing Aβ release. DHA has a typical pleiotropic effect; DHA-mediated Aβ reduction is not the consequence of a single major mechanism but is the result of combined multiple effects."

https://openalex.org/W2049335277,"Background The 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza dynamics in Italy was characterized by a notable pattern: as it emerged from the analysis of influenza-like illness data, after an initial period (September–mid-October 2009) characterized by a slow exponential increase in the weekly incidence, a sudden and sharp increase of the growth rate was observed by mid-October. The aim here is to understand whether spontaneous behavioral changes in the population could be responsible for such a pattern of epidemic spread. Methodology/Principal Findings In order to face this issue, a mathematical model of influenza transmission, accounting for spontaneous behavioral changes driven by cost/benefit considerations on the perceived risk of infection, is proposed and validated against empirical epidemiological data. The performed investigation revealed that an initial overestimation of the risk of infection in the general population, possibly induced by the high concern for the emergence of a new influenza pandemic, results in a pattern of spread compliant with the observed one. This finding is also supported by the analysis of antiviral drugs purchase over the epidemic period. Moreover, by assuming a generation time of 2.5 days, the initially diffuse misperception of the risk of infection led to a relatively low value of the reproductive number , which increased to in the subsequent phase of the pandemic. Conclusions/Significance This study highlights that spontaneous behavioral changes in the population, not accounted by the large majority of influenza transmission models, can not be neglected to correctly inform public health decisions. In fact, individual choices can drastically affect the epidemic spread, by altering timing, dynamics and overall number of cases."
https://openalex.org/W2119056642,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative bacterium causing chronic infections in cystic fibrosis patients. Such infections are associated with an active type VI secretion system (T6SS), which consists of about 15 conserved components, including the AAA+ ATPase, ClpV. The T6SS secretes two categories of proteins, VgrG and Hcp. Hcp is structurally similar to a phage tail tube component, whereas VgrG proteins show similarity to the puncturing device at the tip of the phage tube. In P. aeruginosa, three T6SSs are known. The expression of H1-T6SS genes is controlled by the RetS sensor. Here, 10 vgrG genes were identified in the PAO1 genome, among which three are co-regulated with H1-T6SS, namely vgrG1a/b/c. Whereas VgrG1a and VgrG1c were secreted in a ClpV1-dependent manner, secretion of VgrG1b was ClpV1-independent. We show that VgrG1a and VgrG1c form multimers, which confirmed the VgrG model predicting trimers similar to the tail spike. We demonstrate that Hcp1 secretion requires either VgrG1a or VgrG1c, which may act independently to puncture the bacterial envelope and give Hcp1 access to the surface. VgrG1b is not required for Hcp1 secretion. Thus, VgrG1b does not require H1-T6SS for secretion nor does H1-T6SS require VgrG1b for its function. Finally, we show that VgrG proteins are required for secretion of a genuine H1-T6SS substrate, Tse3. Our results demonstrate that VgrG proteins are not only secreted components but are essential for secretion of other T6SS substrates. Overall, we emphasize variability in behavior of three P. aeruginosa VgrGs, suggesting that, although very similar, distinct VgrGs achieve specific functions.

IntroductionProtein secretion systems in bacterial pathogens are virulence weapons allowing bacteria to successfully infect the host (1Cossart P. Sansonetti P.J. Science. 2004; 304: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 2Merrell D.S. Falkow S. Nature. 2004; 430: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Secreted proteins are essential for nutrients or iron acquisition, to evade the immune system, to subvert host cell signaling, and to replicate within macrophages: in other words to survive and exploit the hostile environment of the host.Secretion in Gram-negative bacteria has been catalogued in a series of systems, called type I to type V (3Durand E. Verger D. Rêgo A.T. Chandran V. Meng G. Fronzes R. Waksman G. Infect. Disord. Drug Targets. 2009; 9: 518-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 4Bleves S. Viarre V. Salacha R. Michel G.P. Filloux A. Voulhoux R. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2010; 300: 534-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Each type shows a difference in the components involved and in the molecular mechanisms. Type I, type II, and type V usually deliver proteins onto the bacterial cell surface or into the surrounding environment. In some cases, such as the type II-dependent exotoxin A from P. aeruginosa (5Voulhoux R. Taupiac M.P. Czjzek M. Beaumelle B. Filloux A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4051-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the protein has the capacity to subsequently self-translocate into eukaryotic cells. The type III secretion system (T3SS) of many bacterial pathogens is responsible for the delivery of effectors into eukaryotic cells. This yields a spectacular host cell response, resulting, for example, in complete reorganization of the cytoskeleton, thus promoting or avoiding bacterial uptake (6Parsot C. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2009; 12: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 7McGhie E.J. Brawn L.C. Hume P.J. Humphreys D. Koronakis V. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2009; 12: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 8Hauser A.R. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 654-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Another system with similar properties found in many pathogens devoid of T3SS is the type IV secretion system (T4SS) (9Llosa M. Roy C. Dehio C. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 73: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). T3SS and T4SS deliver effectors that share similarities with eukaryotic proteins (such as Ser/Thr kinases) and mimic activities of endogenous cellular proteins. These secretion systems provide the pathogen with a unique functional interface with eukaryotic cells to subvert the host response (10Galán J.E. Cell Host Microbe. 2009; 5: 571-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar).A few years ago, a novel secretion system (type VI or T6SS) was identified in Vibrio cholerae (11Pukatzki S. Ma A.T. Sturtevant D. Krastins B. Sarracino D. Nelson W.C. Heidelberg J.F. Mekalanos J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 1528-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar) and in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12Mougous J.D. Cuff M.E. Raunser S. Shen A. Zhou M. Gifford C.A. Goodman A.L. Joachimiak G. Ordoñez C.L. Lory S. Walz T. Joachimiak A. Mekalanos J.J. Science. 2006; 312: 1526-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). It was revealed that about 15 genes encoding this system are present in the genome of hundreds of bacteria (13Bingle L.E. Bailey C.M. Pallen M.J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2008; 11: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) and that their function is extremely relevant for bacterial pathogenesis and host cell survival. In many cases, these genes are induced in vivo.P. aeruginosa is the third most commonly isolated nosocomial pathogen, and is lethal for chronically infected cystic fibrosis patients. The genome of this bacterium contains at least three gene clusters encoding T6SS components (12Mougous J.D. Cuff M.E. Raunser S. Shen A. Zhou M. Gifford C.A. Goodman A.L. Joachimiak G. Ordoñez C.L. Lory S. Walz T. Joachimiak A. Mekalanos J.J. Science. 2006; 312: 1526-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 14Filloux A. Hachani A. Bleves S. Microbiology. 2008; 154: 1570-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), which are now named H1-T6SS to H3-T6SS (15Hood R.D. Singh P. Hsu F. Güvener T. Carl M.A. Trinidad R.R. Silverman J.M. Ohlson B.B. Hicks K.G. Plemel R.L. Li M. Schwarz S. Wang W.Y. Merz A.J. Goodlett D.R. Mougous J.D. Cell Host Microbe. 2010; 7: 25-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Importantly, it was reported that mutants affected in T6SS genes are attenuated in a rat lung model of chronic infection (16Potvin E. Lehoux D.E. Kukavica-Ibrulj I. Richard K.L. Sanschagrin F. Lau G.W. Levesque R.C. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 1294-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Since then, studies have shown that proteins secreted by the T6SS essentially belong to two families, namely Hcp and VgrG. Hcp is a small protein, which forms hexamers. It was proposed that the function of Hcp is to form nanotubes on the bacterial surface (17Ballister E.R. Lai A.H. Zuckermann R.N. Cheng Y. Mougous J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 3733-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and that these tubes may allow transport of other T6SS-dependent effector proteins. VgrGs contain two domains, which are related to proteins constituting the bacteriophage tail (namely gp5 and gp27) (18Leiman P.G. Basler M. Ramagopal U.A. Bonanno J.B. Sauder J.M. Pukatzki S. Burley S.K. Almo S.C. Mekalanos J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 4154-4159Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the VgrG proteins form trimeric complexes that could be used as puncturing devices to perforate membranes and allow the passage of proteins or macromolecular complexes. In some cases, VgrGs have a C-terminal extension. Bioinformatic analysis showed that some C-terminal domains display homologies with adhesins, protease or actin cross-linking protein (11Pukatzki S. Ma A.T. Sturtevant D. Krastins B. Sarracino D. Nelson W.C. Heidelberg J.F. Mekalanos J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 1528-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Few data are available about the role/function of VgrG proteins, and the only detailed reports concern VgrG1 from V. cholerae (19Ma A.T. McAuley S. Pukatzki S. Mekalanos J.J. Cell Host Microbe. 2009; 5: 234-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and Aeromonas hydrophila (20Suarez G. Sierra J.C. Erova T.E. Sha J. Horneman A.J. Chopra A.K. J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In V. cholerae, VgrG1 has a C-terminal actin cross-linking domain and is translocated into host cells, in particular upon internalization of the bacteria by macrophages. The success of this process is important for survival within macrophages and thus for successful infection. In V. cholerae, two other VgrG proteins, VgrG2 and VgrG3, have been identified. VgrG2 does not carry a C-terminal extension, whereas VgrG3 contains a peptidoglycan-binding domain.Little has been experimentally demonstrated about the function of these VgrG proteins. We showed that in the PAO1 P. aeruginosa genome, 10 distinct vgrG-like genes could be identified. It is unclear why so many vgrG genes are found in the genome of one single bacterium. In this study, we characterized three P. aeruginosa VgrGs, namely VgrG1a (PA0091), VgrG1b (PA0095), and VgrG1c (PA2685). The corresponding vgrG genes are co-regulated with the H1-T6SS cluster, whose expression is controlled by RetS (12Mougous J.D. Cuff M.E. Raunser S. Shen A. Zhou M. Gifford C.A. Goodman A.L. Joachimiak G. Ordoñez C.L. Lory S. Walz T. Joachimiak A. Mekalanos J.J. Science. 2006; 312: 1526-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Here, we clearly establish that all three VgrGs are secreted. However, we show that they have different behavior in terms of secretion and multimerization and suggest that they may fulfill specific functions within the T6SS process.DISCUSSIONThe discovery of the T6SS shed new light on the strategy used by bacterial pathogens to successfully infect their host (11Pukatzki S. Ma A.T. Sturtevant D. Krastins B. Sarracino D. Nelson W.C. Heidelberg J.F. Mekalanos J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 1528-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 14Filloux A. Hachani A. Bleves S. Microbiology. 2008; 154: 1570-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The T3SS and T4SS have been described as injecting bacterial effectors into host cells and consequently manipulating the host response for their own benefit (9Llosa M. Roy C. Dehio C. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 73: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because the T6SS was initially discovered as being specifically induced in vivo and because T6SS appeared to be activated upon host cell contact (11Pukatzki S. Ma A.T. Sturtevant D. Krastins B. Sarracino D. Nelson W.C. Heidelberg J.F. Mekalanos J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 1528-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 20Suarez G. Sierra J.C. Erova T.E. Sha J. Horneman A.J. Chopra A.K. J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), it was proposed that it could fulfill a similar function and that putative effector proteins should be associated with the T6SS.Very little knowledge is available about the characterization of these effectors and about proteins secreted in a T6SS-dependent manner. It was determined that Hcp is a bacteriophage gp19 homologue and could form a tube as part of the T6SS machinery (18Leiman P.G. Basler M. Ramagopal U.A. Bonanno J.B. Sauder J.M. Pukatzki S. Burley S.K. Almo S.C. Mekalanos J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 4154-4159Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 35Pell L.G. Kanelis V. Donaldson L.W. Howell P.L. Davidson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 4160-4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This tube could span the bacterial cell envelope and become cell surface-exposed, which would explain why Hcp is recovered from bacterial culture supernatants. VgrG proteins were also described as bacteriophage protein homologues. VgrGs are composite proteins, all containing a domain similar to gp5 and a domain similar to gp27. The association of gp5 and gp27 in the bacteriophage infection process results in the formation of a puncturing device, which sits on the tip of the gp19 tube and perforates the membrane, thus allowing phage DNA injection into the bacterial cell. Based on this model, VgrG proteins may sit at the tip of the Hcp tube and could be released into the extracellular medium. Only few proteins have been described to be secreted in a T6SS-dependent manner, such as RbsB from Rhizobium leguminosarum (36Bladergroen M.R. Badelt K. Spaink H.P. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2003; 16: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) or IglI from Francisella tularensis (37Barker J.R. Chong A. Wehrly T.D. Yu J.J. Rodriguez S.A. Liu J. Celli J. Arulanandam B.P. Klose K.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 74: 1459-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). It was shown recently that three proteins, Tse1 to -3, are substrates for the P. aeruginosa H1-T6SS (15Hood R.D. Singh P. Hsu F. Güvener T. Carl M.A. Trinidad R.R. Silverman J.M. Ohlson B.B. Hicks K.G. Plemel R.L. Li M. Schwarz S. Wang W.Y. Merz A.J. Goodlett D.R. Mougous J.D. Cell Host Microbe. 2010; 7: 25-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Among them, Tse2 is a toxin that is targeted to prokaryotic cells. Alternatively, effector domains have been identified at the C terminus of VgrG proteins, which are referred to as evolved VgrGs. The C-terminal domain may be an adhesin or an enzyme for example. Only two of these evolved VgrGs have been experimentally studied, VgrG1 from V. cholerae (19Ma A.T. McAuley S. Pukatzki S. Mekalanos J.J. Cell Host Microbe. 2009; 5: 234-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 31Pukatzki S. Ma A.T. Revel A.T. Sturtevant D. Mekalanos J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 15508-15513Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) and from A. hydrophila (20Suarez G. Sierra J.C. Erova T.E. Sha J. Horneman A.J. Chopra A.K. J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In both cases, it was shown that the activity associated with the VgrG C-terminal domain, ACD, or VIP-2, respectively, was involved in remodeling the actin cytoskeleton of the host cell.Genome mining in P. aeruginosa identified three T6SS clusters (H1- to H3-T6SS). Furthermore, we showed here that 10 vgrG genes could be identified on the PAO1 chromosome. Previous work using mass spectrometry analysis showed that at least two P. aeruginosa VgrGs, VgrG1 (PA0091) and VgrG4 (PA2685), were not recovered in the supernatant of an H1-T6SS mutant (clpV1 mutant) and therefore could be substrate for the H1-T6SS machinery (15Hood R.D. Singh P. Hsu F. Güvener T. Carl M.A. Trinidad R.R. Silverman J.M. Ohlson B.B. Hicks K.G. Plemel R.L. Li M. Schwarz S. Wang W.Y. Merz A.J. Goodlett D.R. Mougous J.D. Cell Host Microbe. 2010; 7: 25-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). The authors confirmed this observation by overproducing VSV-tagged versions of the VgrG proteins and by following secretion using standard Western blot analysis. We focused our work on VgrG1, which we renamed here VgrG1a, and generated antibodies directed against this protein to follow its fate when expressed from the chromosomal gene. This protein is a standard VgrG protein without any C-terminal extension. Here, we confirmed that VgrG1a is efficiently secreted, and we demonstrated that at least two other VgrGs are also secreted, VgrG1b and VgrG1c. It is important to recall that VgrG1a is only detected in the retS mutant in which the vgrG1a/PA0091 gene is up-regulated (30-fold) (27Goodman A.L. Kulasekara B. Rietsch A. Boyd D. Smith R.S. Lory S. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 745-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The transcriptomic analysis revealed that vgrG1b/PA0095 (3.7-fold) and vgrG1c/PA2685 (4.3-fold) are also up-regulated in a retS mutant, which explains why they are detected in the same conditions. In contrast to vgrG1b, which is located within the vicinity of vgrG1a and the H1-T6SS gene cluster, vgrG1c is located at a different locus and not clustered with any T6SS genes (Fig. 2A). Not only is the production of these three VgrG proteins coordinated, but they are closely related when compared with the seven other VgrG proteins (Fig. 2B). VgrG1c/PA2685 corresponds to the previously described VgrG4 (15Hood R.D. Singh P. Hsu F. Güvener T. Carl M.A. Trinidad R.R. Silverman J.M. Ohlson B.B. Hicks K.G. Plemel R.L. Li M. Schwarz S. Wang W.Y. Merz A.J. Goodlett D.R. Mougous J.D. Cell Host Microbe. 2010; 7: 25-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), but we propose to rename the VgrG proteins according to their proximity in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2B). We also observed that neither VgrG1b nor VgrG1c contain a C-terminal extension (Fig. 3). In summary, we showed that three P. aeruginosa VgrGs are secreted, but none of them could be considered as an effector protein.Next we analyzed the T6SS-dependent secretion of these VgrG proteins. Although we confirmed that VgrG1a and VgrG1c secretion is drastically reduced in a clpV1 mutant, VgrG1b secretion seems to remain unaffected. Furthermore, VgrG1b is still secreted in strains containing a mutation in any of the three T6SS clusters, suggesting that VgrG1b secretion can occur in a T6SS-independent manner. The reason for such behavior is unclear, but T6SS-independent secretion of VgrG proteins has also been reported in F. tularensis (37Barker J.R. Chong A. Wehrly T.D. Yu J.J. Rodriguez S.A. Liu J. Celli J. Arulanandam B.P. Klose K.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 74: 1459-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).It has been proposed that VgrG proteins form trimeric complexes similar to the (gp27)3(gp5)3 tail spike structure of the T4 phage. We confirmed here using a three-dimensional structure model that this applies to VgrG1a (supplemental Fig. S2). When we analyzed the multimeric state of the VgrG proteins isolated from the supernatant of P. aeruginosa cultures, we observed that both VgrG1a and VgrG1c are capable of assembling into a multimeric form. This complex disappears only when both vgrG1a and vgrG1c genes are deleted. However, it is noticeable that when analyzing samples from a vgrG1a mutant, only the multimeric form of VgrG1c is detected. In contrast, analyzing samples from the vgrG1c mutant indicates that whereas VgrG1a complex is detectable, a large amount of monomeric VgrG1a is also detectable, suggesting that the complex is less stable. The presence of VgrG1b complex could not be shown using anti-VgrG1b antibodies, which might suggest that, if formed, the VgrG1b complex is very unstable.Although three P. aeruginosa VgrGs appeared co-regulated and highly similar at the amino acid sequence level, none of them showed similar behavior in terms of secretion or multimerization. This discrepancy might suggest that each of the three VgrGs fulfills an independent function or allows a significant level of specificity. For example, if we consider VgrGs as a puncturing device, non-evolved VgrGs might serve the secretion of yet unknown proteins with which they may interact specifically. For example, we hypothesized that VgrG1a is involved in the secretion of one of the Tse proteins, whereas VgrG1c may be required for the secretion of a different Tse. In this way, each complex, VgrG1a or VgrG1c, together with their cognate exoproteins, might sit independently or alternatively on the tip of the Hcp1 tube. As for the evolved VgrG, it will have a dual function, which is on the one hand to perforate the membrane and on the other hand to carry an effector or secreted protein. If this is true, we might expect that accessibility of Hcp1 to the external milieu would depend either on VgrG1a or VgrG1c. This is exactly what we observed because Hcp1 secretion was reduced in a vgrG1a or a vgrG1c mutant but was abolished in a double vgrG1a/vgrG1c mutant.In conclusion, we point out the remarkable feature that although release in the extracellular medium might be a general feature of VgrG proteins, there is a lot more subtlety in the function of these components. The large number of vgrG genes in P. aeruginosa is probably not the result of a duplication but rather a gain in specificity for the system, which might modulate its secretion profile according to the situation encountered within the host. Future work will aim at better understanding the exact role played by the non-evolved VgrGs, which we suspect is not exclusively to provide a channel through the cell envelope but also to specifically interact with yet unknown secreted proteins, such as the recently characterized Tse1 to -3 proteins (15Hood R.D. Singh P. Hsu F. Güvener T. Carl M.A. Trinidad R.R. Silverman J.M. Ohlson B.B. Hicks K.G. Plemel R.L. Li M. Schwarz S. Wang W.Y. Merz A.J. Goodlett D.R. Mougous J.D. Cell Host Microbe. 2010; 7: 25-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Our data regarding Tse secretion showed that although Tse3 secretion is VgrG-dependent, all three VgrGs need to be absent to prevent Tse3 release, thus showing no sign of specificity in this case. We still need to develop a refined quantitative assay to rule out any VgrG specificity, and we will further address VgrG-dependent secretion of Tse1 and Tse2. For the time being, two categories of VgrGs can be described. The evolved VgrGs form one block, including the puncturing device and the secreted domain covalently bound at the C terminus. This will conceptually resemble an autotransporter system (38Henderson I.R. Navarro-Garcia F. Desvaux M. Fernandez R.C. Ala'Aldeen D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 692-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). The standard VgrGs, such as VgrG1a, VgrG1b, and VgrG1c, described in this study, contain the sole puncturing device but could possibly recognize a secreted substrate. If this turns out to be the case, it will conceptually resemble a two-partner system. IntroductionProtein secretion systems in bacterial pathogens are virulence weapons allowing bacteria to successfully infect the host (1Cossart P. Sansonetti P.J. Science. 2004; 304: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 2Merrell D.S. Falkow S. Nature. 2004; 430: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Secreted proteins are essential for nutrients or iron acquisition, to evade the immune system, to subvert host cell signaling, and to replicate within macrophages: in other words to survive and exploit the hostile environment of the host.Secretion in Gram-negative bacteria has been catalogued in a series of systems, called type I to type V (3Durand E. Verger D. Rêgo A.T. Chandran V. Meng G. Fronzes R. Waksman G. Infect. Disord. Drug Targets. 2009; 9: 518-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 4Bleves S. Viarre V. Salacha R. Michel G.P. Filloux A. Voulhoux R. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2010; 300: 534-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Each type shows a difference in the components involved and in the molecular mechanisms. Type I, type II, and type V usually deliver proteins onto the bacterial cell surface or into the surrounding environment. In some cases, such as the type II-dependent exotoxin A from P. aeruginosa (5Voulhoux R. Taupiac M.P. Czjzek M. Beaumelle B. Filloux A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4051-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the protein has the capacity to subsequently self-translocate into eukaryotic cells. The type III secretion system (T3SS) of many bacterial pathogens is responsible for the delivery of effectors into eukaryotic cells. This yields a spectacular host cell response, resulting, for example, in complete reorganization of the cytoskeleton, thus promoting or avoiding bacterial uptake (6Parsot C. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2009; 12: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 7McGhie E.J. Brawn L.C. Hume P.J. Humphreys D. Koronakis V. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2009; 12: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 8Hauser A.R. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 654-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Another system with similar properties found in many pathogens devoid of T3SS is the type IV secretion system (T4SS) (9Llosa M. Roy C. Dehio C. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 73: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). T3SS and T4SS deliver effectors that share similarities with eukaryotic proteins (such as Ser/Thr kinases) and mimic activities of endogenous cellular proteins. These secretion systems provide the pathogen with a unique functional interface with eukaryotic cells to subvert the host response (10Galán J.E. Cell Host Microbe. 2009; 5: 571-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar).A few years ago, a novel secretion system (type VI or T6SS) was identified in Vibrio cholerae (11Pukatzki S. Ma A.T. Sturtevant D. Krastins B. Sarracino D. Nelson W.C. Heidelberg J.F. Mekalanos J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 1528-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar) and in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12Mougous J.D. Cuff M.E. Raunser S. Shen A. Zhou M. Gifford C.A. Goodman A.L. Joachimiak G. Ordoñez C.L. Lory S. Walz T. Joachimiak A. Mekalanos J.J. Science. 2006; 312: 1526-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). It was revealed that about 15 genes encoding this system are present in the genome of hundreds of bacteria (13Bingle L.E. Bailey C.M. Pallen M.J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2008; 11: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) and that their function is extremely relevant for bacterial pathogenesis and host cell survival. In many cases, these genes are induced in vivo.P. aeruginosa is the third most commonly isolated nosocomial pathogen, and is lethal for chronically infected cystic fibrosis patients. The genome of this bacterium contains at least three gene clusters encoding T6SS components (12Mougous J.D. Cuff M.E. Raunser S. Shen A. Zhou M. Gifford C.A. Goodman A.L. Joachimiak G. Ordoñez C.L. Lory S. Walz T. Joachimiak A. Mekalanos J.J. Science. 2006; 312: 1526-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 14Filloux A. Hachani A. Bleves S. Microbiology. 2008; 154: 1570-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), which are now named H1-T6SS to H3-T6SS (15Hood R.D. Singh P. Hsu F. Güvener T. Carl M.A. Trinidad R.R. Silverman J.M. Ohlson B.B. Hicks K.G. Plemel R.L. Li M. Schwarz S. Wang W.Y. Merz A.J. Goodlett D.R. Mougous J.D. Cell Host Microbe. 2010; 7: 25-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Importantly, it was reported that mutants affected in T6SS genes are attenuated in a rat lung model of chronic infection (16Potvin E. Lehoux D.E. Kukavica-Ibrulj I. Richard K.L. Sanschagrin F. Lau G.W. Levesque R.C. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 1294-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Since then, studies have shown that proteins secreted by the T6SS essentially belong to two families, namely Hcp and VgrG. Hcp is a small protein, which forms hexamers. It was proposed that the function of Hcp is to form nanotubes on the bacterial surface (17Ballister E.R. Lai A.H. Zuckermann R.N. Cheng Y. Mougous J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 3733-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and that these tubes may allow transport of other T6SS-dependent effector proteins. VgrGs contain two domains, which are related to proteins constituting the bacteriophage tail (namely gp5 and gp27) (18Leiman P.G. Basler M. Ramagopal U.A. Bonanno J.B. Sauder J.M. Pukatzki S. Burley S.K. Almo S.C. Mekalanos J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 4154-4159Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the VgrG proteins form trimeric complexes that could be used as puncturing devices to perforate membranes and allow the passage of proteins or macromolecular complexes. In some cases, VgrGs have a C-terminal extension. Bioinformatic analysis showed that some C-terminal domains display homologies with adhesins, protease or actin cross-linking protein (11Pukatzki S.

However, little is known about their rise and diversification prior to the Late Cretaceous. Furthermore, the evolution of their highly-modified skull anatomy has been largely hindered by the scarcity of well-preserved cranial remains. A new sauropod dinosaur from the Early Cretaceous of Brazil represents the earliest advanced titanosaurian known to date, demonstrating that the initial diversification of advanced titanosaurians was well under way at least 30 million years before their known radiation in the latest Cretaceous. The new taxon also preserves the most complete skull among titanosaurians, further revealing that their low and elongated diplodocid-like skull morphology appeared much earlier than previously thought."

Chronic chorioamnionitis and villitis of unknown etiology represent maternal anti-fetal cellular rejection. Antibody-mediated rejection is another type of transplantation rejection. We investigated whether there was evidence for antibody-mediated rejection against the fetus in spontaneous preterm birth. Methods and Findings This cross-sectional study included women with (1) normal pregnancy and term delivery (n = 140) and (2) spontaneous preterm delivery (n = 140). We analyzed maternal and fetal sera for panel-reactive anti-HLA class I and class II antibodies, and determined C4d deposition on umbilical vein endothelium by immunohistochemistry. Maternal anti-HLA class I seropositivity in spontaneous preterm births was higher than in normal term births (48.6% vs. 32.1%, p = 0.005). Chronic chorioamnionitis was associated with a higher maternal anti-HLA class I seropositivity (p<0.01), significant in preterm and term birth. Villitis of unknown etiology was associated with increased maternal and fetal anti-HLA class I and II seropositivity (p<0.05, for each). Fetal anti-HLA seropositivity was closely related to maternal anti-HLA seropositivity in both groups (p<0.01, for each). C4d deposition on umbilical vein endothelium was more frequent in preterm labor than term labor (77.1% vs. 11.4%, p<0.001). Logistic regression analysis revealed that chronic chorioamnionitis (OR = 6.10, 95% CI 1.29–28.83), maternal anti-HLA class I seropositivity (OR = 5.90, 95% CI 1.60–21.83), and C4d deposition on umbilical vein endothelium (OR = 36.19, 95% CI 11.42–114.66) were associated with preterm labor and delivery. Conclusions A major subset of spontaneous preterm births has a signature of maternal anti-fetal cellular and antibody-mediated rejections with links to fetal graft-versus-host disease and alloimmune reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1970961326,"NFATs are a family of Ca(2+)-dependent transcription factors that play a central role in the morphogenesis, development, and physiological activities of numerous distinct cell types and organ systems. Here, we visualize NFAT1 movement in and out of the nucleus in response to transient activation of store-operated Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channels in nonexcitable cells. We show that NFAT migration is exquisitely sensitive to Ca(2+) microdomains near open CRAC channels. Another Ca(2+)-permeable ion channel (TRPC3) was ineffective in driving NFAT1 to the nucleus. NFAT1 movement is temporally dissociated from the time course of the Ca(2+) signal and remains within the nucleus for 10 times longer than the duration of the trigger Ca(2+) signal. Kinetic analyses of each step linking CRAC channel activation to NFAT1 nuclear residency reveals that the rate-limiting step is transcription factor exit from the nucleus. The slow deactivation of NFAT provides a mechanism whereby Ca(2+)-dependent responses can be sustained despite the termination of the initial Ca(2+) signal and helps explain how gene expression in nonexcitable cells can continue after the primary stimulus has been removed."
https://openalex.org/W1969013165,"Gliomas frequently contain mutations in the cytoplasmic NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1) or the mitochondrial NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH2). Several different amino acid substitutions recur at either IDH1 R132 or IDH2 R172 in glioma patients. Genetic evidence indicates that these mutations share a common gain of function, but it is unclear whether the shared function is dominant negative activity, neomorphic production of (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), or both.We show by coprecipitation that five cancer-derived IDH1 R132 mutants bind IDH1-WT but that three cancer-derived IDH2 R172 mutants exert minimal binding to IDH2-WT. None of the mutants dominant-negatively lower isocitrate dehydrogenase activity at physiological (40 µM) isocitrate concentrations in mammalian cell lysates. In contrast to this, all of these mutants confer 10- to 100-fold higher 2HG production to cells, and glioma tissues containing IDH1 R132 or IDH2 R172 mutations contain high levels of 2HG compared to glioma tissues without IDH mutations (54.4 vs. 0.1 mg 2HG/g protein).Binding to, or dominant inhibition of, WT IDH1 or IDH2 is not a shared feature of the IDH1 and IDH2 mutations, and thus is not likely to be important in cancer. The fact that the gain of the enzymatic activity to produce 2HG is a shared feature of the IDH1 and IDH2 mutations suggests that this is an important function for these mutants in driving cancer pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2110225899,"The extragalactic background light at far-infrared wavelengths originates from optically-faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies in the universe with star-formation rates at the level of a few hundred solar masses per year. Due to the relatively poor spatial resolution of far-infrared telescopes, the faint sub-millimetre galaxies are challenging to study individually. Instead, their average properties can be studied using statistics such as the angular power spectrum of the background intensity variations. A previous attempt at measuring this power spectrum resulted in the suggestion that the clustering amplitude is below the level computed with a simple ansatz based on a halo model. Here we report a clear detection of the excess clustering over the linear prediction at arcminute angular scales in the power spectrum of brightness fluctuations at 250, 350, and 500 microns. From this excess, we find that sub-millimetre galaxies are located in dark matter halos with a minimum mass of log[M_min/M_sun ]= 11.5^+0.7_-0.2 at 350 microns. This minimum dark matter halo mass corresponds to the most efficient mass scale for star formation in the universe, and is lower than that predicted by semi-analytical models for galaxy formation."

To map the PrP conversion process we introduced disulfide bridges into different positions within the globular domain of PrP, tethering selected secondary structure elements. The majority of tethered PrP mutants exhibited increased thermodynamic stability, nevertheless, they converted efficiently. Only the disulfides that tether subdomain B1-H1-B2 to subdomain H2-H3 prevented PrP conversion in vitro and in prion-infected cell cultures. Reduction of disulfides recovered the ability of these mutants to convert, demonstrating that the separation of subdomains is an essential step in conversion. Formation of disulfide-linked proteinase K-resistant dimers in fibrils composed of a pair of single cysteine mutants supports the model based on domain-swapped dimers as the building blocks of prion fibrils. In contrast to previously proposed structural models of PrPSc suggesting conversion of large secondary structural segments, we provide evidence for the conservation of secondary structural elements of the globular domain upon PrP conversion. Previous studies already showed that dimerization is the rate-limiting step in PrP conversion. We show that separation and swapping of subdomains of the globular domain is necessary for conversion.

Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) plays an important role in atherosclerotic vascular calcification. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) on BMP-2 protein expression in human coronary artery endothelial cells (CAECs), the roles of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4 in oxLDL-induced BMP-2 expression, and the signaling pathways involved. Human CAECs were stimulated with oxLDL. The roles of TLR2 and TLR4 in oxLDL-induced BMP-2 expression were determined by pretreatment with neutralizing antibody, siRNA, and overexpression. Stimulation with oxLDL increased cellular BMP-2 protein levels in a dose-dependent manner (40–160 μg/ml). Pretreatment with neutralizing antibodies against TLR2 and TLR4 or silencing of these two receptors reduced oxLDL-induced BMP-2 expression. Overexpression of TLR2 and TLR4 enhanced the cellular BMP-2 response to oxLDL. Furthermore, oxLDL was co-localized with TLR2 and TLR4. BMP-2 expression was associated with activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2. Inhibition of NF-κB and ERK1/2 reduced BMP-2 expression whereas inhibition of p38 MAPK had no effect. In conclusion, oxLDL induces BMP-2 expression through TLR2 and TLR4 in human CAECs. The NF-κB and ERK1/2 pathways are involved in the signaling mechanism. These findings underscore an important role for TLR2 and TLR4 in mediating the BMP-2 response to oxLDL in human CAECs and indicate that these two immunoreceptors contribute to the mechanisms underlying atherosclerotic vascular calcification.

https://openalex.org/W2149293626,"EfeB/YcdB is a member of the dye-decolorizing peroxidase (DyP) protein family. A recent study has shown that this protein can extract iron from heme without breaking the tetrapyrrole ring. We report the crystal structure of EfeB from Escherichia coli O157 bound to heme at 1.95 Å resolution. The EfeB monomer contains two domains. The heme molecule is located in a large hydrophobic pocket in the C-terminal domain. A long loop connecting the two domains extensively interacts with the heme, which is a distinctive structural feature of EfeB homologues. A large tunnel formed by this loop and the β-sheet of C-terminal domain provides a potential cofactor/substrate binding site. Biochemical data show that the production of protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) is closely related to the peroxidation activity. The mutant D235N keeps nearly the same activity of guaiacol peroxidase as the wild-type protein, whereas the corresponding mutation in the classic DyP protein family completely abolished the peroxidation activity. These results suggest that EfeB is a unique member of the DyP protein family. In addition, dramatically enhanced fluorescence excitation and emission of EfeB-PPIX was observed, implying this protein may be used as a red color fluorescence marker."
https://openalex.org/W2012753167,"The mammalian circadian clock component PERIOD2 (PER2) plays a critical role in circadian rhythm entrainment. Recently, a missense mutation at a putative phosphorylation site in hPER2, Ser-662, was identified in patients that suffer from familial advanced sleep phase syndrome (FASPS). Patients with FASPS display abnormal sleep-wake patterns characterized by a lifelong pattern of sleep onset in the early evening and offset in the early morning. Although the phosphorylation of PER2 is strongly implied from functional studies, it has not been possible to study the site-specific phosphorylation of PER2 on Ser-662, and the biochemical functions of this residue are unclear. Here, we used phospho-specific antibodies to show that PER2 is phosphorylated on Ser-662 and flanking casein kinase (CK) sites in vivo. The phosphorylation of PER2 was carried out by the combined activities of casein kinase 1δ (CK1 δ) and casein kinase 1ε (CK1ε) and was antagonized by protein phosphatase 1. PER2 phosphorylation was rapidly induced in response to circadian entrainment of mammalian cell lines and occurred in both cytosolic and nuclear compartments. Importantly, we found that the pool of Ser-662-phosphorylated PER2 proteins was more stable than the pool of total PER2 molecules, implying that the FASPS phosphorylation cluster antagonizes PER2 degradation. Consistent with this idea, a Ser-662→Ala mutation that abrogated PER2 phosphorylation significantly reduced its half-life, whereas a phosphomimetic Ser-662→Asp substitution led to an elevation in half-life. Our combined findings provide new insights into PER2 regulation and the biochemical basis of FASPS."

It is unknown how AtGPA1 is regulated by Gβγ and the RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) protein AtRGS1, which is comprised of an RGS domain fused to a receptor-like domain. To better understand the cycle of G protein activation and inactivation in plants, we purified and reconstituted AtGPA1, full-length AtRGS1, and two putative Gβγ dimers. We show that the Arabidopsis Gα protein binds to its cognate Gβγ dimer directly and in a nucleotide-dependent manner. Although animal Gβγ dimers inhibit GTP binding to the Gα subunit, AtGPA1 retains fast activation in the presence of its cognate Gβγ dimer. We show further that the full-length AtRGS1 protein accelerates GTP hydrolysis and thereby counteracts the fast nucleotide exchange rate of AtGPA1. Finally, we show that AtGPA1 is less stable in complex with GDP than in complex with GTP or the Gβγ dimer. Molecular dynamics simulations and biophysical studies reveal that altered stability is likely due to increased dynamic motion in the N-terminal α-helix and Switch II of AtGPA1.

However, the impact of these genetic changes on the biological and neutralization sensitivity of the virus is unknown. The current study aims to characterize the genetic, biological, and neutralization sensitivity of HIV-1 identified in China between 2004 and 2007. Based on a total of 107 full-length envelope genes obtained directly from the infected patients, we found that those viruses fell into three major genetic groups: CRF01_AE, subtype B′, and subtype C/CRF07_BC/CRF08_BC/B′C. Pseudotyped viruses built upon the viable env genes have demonstrated their substantial variability in mediating viral entry and in sensitivity to neutralization by subtype-specific plasma pools and broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bnmAb). Many viruses are resistant to one or more bnmAb, including those known to have high potency against diverse viruses from outside China. Sequence and structural analysis has revealed several mechanisms by which these resistant viruses escape recognition from bnmAb. We believe that these results will help us to better understand the impact of genetic diversity on the neutralizing sensitivity of the viruses and to facilitate the design of immunogens capable of eliciting antibodies with potency and breadth similar to those of bnmAb. As HIV-1 continues to spread in China from traditional high risk populations to the general public, its genetic makeup has become increasingly complex. However, the impact of these genetic changes on the biological and neutralization sensitivity of the virus is unknown. The current study aims to characterize the genetic, biological, and neutralization sensitivity of HIV-1 identified in China between 2004 and 2007. Based on a total of 107 full-length envelope genes obtained directly from the infected patients, we found that those viruses fell into three major genetic groups: CRF01_AE, subtype B′, and subtype C/CRF07_BC/CRF08_BC/B′C.

These earlier reports revealed that 1) RelE alone does not exhibit mRNA cleavage activity, 2) RelE mediates mRNA cleavage through its association with the ribosome, 3) RelE-mediated mRNA cleavage occurs at the ribosomal A site and, 4) Cleavage of mRNA by RelE exhibits high codon specificity. More specifically, RelE exhibits a preference for the stop codons UAG and UGA and sense codons CAG and UCG in vitro. In this study, we used a comprehensive primer extension approach to map the frequency and codon specificity of RelE cleavage activity in vivo. We found extensive cleavage at the beginning of the coding region of five transcripts, ompA, lpp, ompF, rpsA, and tufA. We then mapped RelE cleavage sites across one short transcript (lpp) and two long transcripts (ompF and ompA). RelE cut all of these transcripts frequently and efficiently within the first ∼100 codons, only occasionally cut beyond this point, and rarely cut at sites in proximity to the 3′ end. Among 196 RelE sites in these five transcripts, there was no preference for CAG or UCG sense codons. In fact, bioinformatic analysis of the RelE cleavage sites failed to identify any sequence preferences. These results suggest a model of RelE function distinct from those proposed previously, because RelE directed frequent codon-independent mRNA cleavage coincident with the commencement of translation elongation.

Nectins are immunoglobulin (Ig)-like cell adhesion molecules that mediate homotypic and heterotypic cell-cell adhesion, playing key roles in tissue organization. To mediate cell-cell adhesion, nectin molecules dimerize in cis on the surface of the same cell, followed by trans-dimerization of the cis-dimers between the neighboring cells. Previous cell biological studies deduced that the first Ig-like domain of nectin and the second Ig-like domain are involved in trans-dimerization and cis-dimerization, respectively. However, to understand better the steps involved in nectin adhesion, the structural basis for the dimerization of nectin must be determined. In this study, we determined the first crystal structure of the entire extracellular region of nectin-1. In the crystal, nectin-1 formed a V-shaped homophilic dimer through the first Ig-like domain. Structure-based site-directed mutagenesis of the first Ig-like domain identified four essential residues that are involved in the homophilic dimerization. Upon mutating the four residues, nectin-1 significantly decreased cis-dimerization on the surface of cultured cells and abolished the homophilic and heterophilic adhesion activities. These results indicate that, in contrast with the previous notion, our structure represents a cis-dimer.

In multicellular organisms, cells are interconnected by cell-cell junctions, which are involved in embryogenesis, tissue organization, and tissue homeostasis. Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) 3The abbreviations used are: CAM, cell adhesion molecule; Bis-Tris propane, 1,3-bis(tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino)propane; BS3, bis-(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate; gD, glycoprotein D; pAb, polyclonal antibody; PAJ, puncta adherentia junction. are the main adhesive components of the cell-cell junctions (1Yap A.S.

CAMs trans-interact with the CAMs on the neighboring cells via their extracellular regions. CAMs assemble into a ladder-like configuration, thereby converting their trans-interactions into physiological cell-cell adhesion (1Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Disruption of cell-cell adhesion causes various serious diseases, including carcinogenesis and cancer metastasis. Therefore, it is important to understand how CAMs organize cell-cell adhesion. Of the CAMs identified to date, numerous studies have focused on cadherins because they are the main CAMs in adherens junctions (1Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 3Harris T.J. Tepass U. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 4Takeichi M. Curr.

Crystal structures of the extracellular regions of cadherins have provided structural insights into the trans-interaction of cadherins. However, different studies have proposed different models for the minimum essential adhesive units underlying the conversion of the trans-interactions into cadherin adhesion (5Shapiro L. Weis W.I. Cold Spring Harbor Perspect. Biol. 2009; 1: a003053Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 6Koch A.W. Pokutta S. Lustig A. Engel J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7697-7705Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Currently, the molecular mechanisms that enable CAMs to assemble and densely pack into the cell-cell junctions remain poorly understood. Nectins are immunoglobulin (Ig)-like CAMs that mediate both homotypic and heterotypic cell-cell adhesion. Nectins comprise a family with four members (2Takai Y. Ikeda W. Ogita H. Rikitake Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2008; 24: 309-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 7Sakisaka T. Takai Y. Curr. Opin.

Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), and the primary sequence analysis has predicted that each member of the nectin family contains an extracellular region with three Ig-like domains, a single transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail region (2Takai Y. Ikeda W. Ogita H. Rikitake Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2008; 24: 309-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 9Takai Y. Miyoshi J. Ikeda W. Ogita H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic tail region is responsible for binding to the PDZ domain of afadin, an actin-filament-binding protein (10Mandai K. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Obaishi H. Wada M. Nishioka H. Itoh M. Mizoguchi A. Aoki T. Fujimoto T. Matsuda Y. Tsukita S. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Nectins homophilically interact in cis on the same cell surface and homophilically and heterophilically interact in trans between neighboring cells, thereby mediating homotypic cell-cell adhesion as well as heterotypic one (2Takai Y. Ikeda W. Ogita H. Rikitake Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2008; 24: 309-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 7Sakisaka T. Takai Y. Curr. Opin.

Of the combinations of trans-interactions, the trans-interaction between nectins-1 and -3 is the strongest (11Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Itoh S. Shingai T. Takekuni K. Satoh K. Inoue Y. Hamaguchi A.

Indeed, the trans-interaction between nectins-1 and -3 plays important roles in various aspects of the central nervous system, including axon guidance and synaptogenesis (2Takai Y. Ikeda W. Ogita H.

It has been deduced from previous cell biological and biochemical studies that the first Ig-like domain of nectin is necessary for the formation of trans-dimers, but not for cis-dimers, whereas the second Ig-like domain contributes to the formation of cis-dimers (12Miyahara M. Nakanishi H. Takahashi K. Satoh-Horikawa K. Tachibana K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 613-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 13Momose Y. Honda T. Inagaki M.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The function of the third Ig-like domain is currently unknown. It has been also deduced from intermolecular force microscopy measurement that nectins can adhere through another state, in addition to the adhesion mediated by interactions between the first Ig-like domains (15Tsukasaki Y. Kitamura K. Shimizu K. Iwane A.H. Takai Y. Yanagida T. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 996-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this novel adhesion state, the first, second, and third Ig-like domains interact in trans with the third, second, and first Ig-like domains of another nectin molecule, respectively, in a zipper-like fashion. However, the adhesive strength induced by this state is weaker than that mediated by the interaction between the first Ig-like domains. To understand nectin adhesion better, the structural basis for the interactions between all of the extracellular domains of nectins must be determined. Evidence is accumulating that the formation of adherens junctions is guided by nectins (2Takai Y. Ikeda W. Ogita H. Rikitake Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2008; 24: 309-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 7Sakisaka T. Takai Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 8Sakisaka T. Ikeda W.

Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Nectins first form the initial cell-cell contact between two neighboring cells and encircle the cells in a belt-like fashion, along with assembly of peripheral actin filament bundles. Following the formation of the nectin-based cell-cell adhesions, cadherin is recruited to the nectin-based adhesion sites, eventually forming strong cell-cell adhesions. In addition to the cooperative role of nectins with cadherins, nectins can organize cell-cell adhesion, particularly heterotypic adhesion, in a cadherin-independent manner (2Takai Y. Ikeda W. Ogita H. Rikitake Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2008; 24: 309-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 7Sakisaka T. Takai Y. Curr. Opin.

Murakami F. Takai Y. Dev. Biol. 2004; 273: 244-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). During early development of the vertebrate central nervous system, nectins-1 and -3 but not cadherins are expressed in commissural axons and floor plate cells, respectively (17Okabe N. Shimizu K. Ozaki-Kuroda K. Nakanishi H. Morimoto K. Takeuchi M. Katsumaru H. Murakami F. Takai Y. Dev. Biol. 2004; 273: 244-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The trans-interaction between nectins-1 and -3 dominantly organizes the heterotypic cell-cell adhesion between commissural axons and floor plate cells and regulates changes in the trajectory of commissural axons (17Okabe N. Shimizu K. Ozaki-Kuroda K. Nakanishi H. Morimoto K. Takeuchi M. Katsumaru H. Murakami F. Takai Y. Dev. Biol. 2004; 273: 244-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Nectins also play a dominant role in germ cell differentiation in the testis. In the latter half of spermatogenesis, spermatids form prominent heterotypic cell-cell junctions with Sertoli cells called Sertoli cell-spermatid junctions, where the existence of the cadherin system has been questionable (16Ozaki-Kuroda K. Nakanishi H. Ohta H. Tanaka H. Kurihara H. Mueller S. Irie K. Ikeda W. Sakai T. Wimmer E. Nishimune Y. Takai Y. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1145-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Nectins-2 and -3 reside in Sertoli cells and spermatids, respectively, and the trans-interaction between nectins-2 and -3 regulates the organization of the Sertoli cell-spermatid junctions (16Ozaki-Kuroda K. Nakanishi H. Ohta H. Tanaka H. Kurihara H. Mueller S. Irie K. Ikeda W. Sakai T. Wimmer E. Nishimune Y. Takai Y. Curr.

Therefore, structural insight into nectin-mediated cell adhesion is required to understand the molecular anatomy of cell-cell adhesion better. Mutations in the nectin gene are also associated with some disorders whose pathologies are characterized by cleft lip/palate, syndactyly, mental retardation, and ectodermal dysplasia (18Suzuki K.

In addition, nectins regulate many other cellular activities such as movement, proliferation, survival, differentiation, polarization, and viral entry, in cooperation with other CAMs and cell surface membrane receptors (2Takai Y. Ikeda W. Ogita H. Rikitake Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2008; 24: 309-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 7Sakisaka T. Takai Y. Curr. Opin.

Virol. 2001; 75: 4734-4743Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Thus, understanding the architecture of nectin adhesion is particularly important. Here, we show the crystal structure of the entire extracellular region of nectin-1. In the crystal, nectin-1 forms a pseudo 2-fold symmetric and a V-shaped homophilic dimer through polar interactions between the first Ig-like domains. Structure-based site-directed mutagenesis studies of the first Ig-like domain identified four residues that are essential for the homophilic dimerization. Upon mutating the four residues, nectin-1 significantly decreased cis-dimerization on the surface of the cultured cells and lost homoptypic adhesion as well as heterotypic adhesion with nectin-3. Therefore, these results reveal that nectin cis-dimerizes through the first Ig-like domain. Based on our findings, we discuss the role of the cis-dimer of nectin as an adhesive unit in the formation of nectin-based cell-cell junctions. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the crystal structure of this member of the nectin family. cDNAs corresponding to the extracellular region of human nectin-1α (residues 30–335) (nectin-1-EC) and mouse nectin-1α mutant (residues 30–335, T63A, Q64A, E125A, and N133A) (nectin-1-EC-4mut) were subcloned into the BamHI and NotI sites of the prokaryotic expression vector pET21b(+) (Novagen), which encodes a C-terminal His6 tag. The proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Novagen) as inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies were dissolved in a buffer containing 50 mm MES-NaOH, pH 6.0, 8 m urea, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT. The samples were then refolded by 300-fold dilution into refolding buffer containing 500 mm l-arginine, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 2 mm oxidized glutathione, and 1 mm reduced glutathione, followed by incubation at 4 °C for 48 h. The samples were subjected to size-exclusion chromatography on a Hiload 16/60 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare). The fractions indicative of the oligomeric form of nectin-1-EC proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm MES-NaOH, pH 6.0, to precipitate almost misfolded proteins, and subjected to a HiTrap SP HP column (GE Healthcare) followed by a Mono Q column (GE Healthcare). Overall, ∼0.5 mg of the refolded nectin-1-EC and ∼0.1 mg of the refolded nectin-1-EC-4mut were purified from 0.1 g of inclusion bodies. To express the native nectin-1-EC protein, cDNA corresponding to the signal peptide and the extracellular region of mouse nectin-1α (residues 1–335) was subcloned into mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 with a C-terminal extension consisting of a TEV cleavage site and a His8 tag followed by a myc tag and a His6 tag, and transfected into HEK293 cells with Effectene (Qiagen). Cells stably expressing and secreting nectin-1-EC with the C-terminal His8-myc-His6 tag (nectin-1-EC-myc) were selected by culturing the cells in the presence of 500 μg/ml G418. The native nectin-1-EC-myc was purified with nickel-agarose (Qiagen) from the conditioned medium in accordance with the manufacturer's instruction. The extracellular region of mouse nectin-3α fused to an Fc fragment of the human IgG (Nef-3) was prepared as described previously (23Honda T. Shimizu K. Kawakatsu T. Yasumi M. Shingai T. Fukuhara A.

Commun. 2003; 306: 104-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For the binding of nectin-1-EC to Nef-3, 1.1 μm nectin-1-EC, 1.1 μm Nef-3, and a mixture containing 1.1 μm each nectin-1-EC and Nef-3 were incubated in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl at 4 °C for 60 min. The samples (50 μl) were subjected to a Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 (GE Healthcare) column and fractionated (100 μl/fraction). For analysis of the homophilic dimerization, nectin-1-EC and nectin-1-EC-4mut were concentrated to 1.5 mg/ml, and filtered using an Ultrafree-MC filter (Millipore). Then, 200 μl of the protein solutions was subjected to a Superdex 200 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) with 200 μl. Crystals were observed in drops containing equal volumes of nectin-1-EC solution (5 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 6% 1,6-hexanediol) and precipitant solution (50 mm citric acid, 50 mm Bis-Tris propane and 1–3% PEG3350) at 23 °C. To improve the quality of crystal diffraction, the crystals were dehydrated using 25% PEG300 solution. A heavy atom derivative was obtained by soaking the crystals overnight in this buffer also containing 1 mm K2PtBr4. The diffraction datasets for native and derivative proteins were collected on a BL44XU at the SPring-8 synchrotron facility at 100 K using wavelengths of 0.9000 Å and 1.07195 Å, respectively. All datasets were processed and scaled with the HKL-2000 suite (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Macromol. Crystallogr. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38668) Google Scholar). The structure of nectin-1-EC was solved by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion with HKL2MAP interface (26Pape T. Schneider T.R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2004; 37: 843-844Crossref Google Scholar).

Sedimentation velocity measurements were performed using a Beckman-Coulter Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter). 360 μl of protein solution at concentrations of 1.00, 0.67, and 0.33 mg/ml for nectin-1-EC and nectin-1-EC-4mut were first centrifuged at 3,000 rpm (700 × g) for 5 min to stabilize its temperature, followed by centrifugation at 50,000 rpm (201,600 × g). Absorbance data at 280 nm was measured for 5 h at 5-min intervals. All measurements were carried out at a constant temperature of 4 °C with a radial increment of 0.003 cm in the continuous scanning mode. Sedimentation velocity data were analyzed using the program SedAnal (33Stafford W.F. Sherwood P.J. Biophys. Chem. 2004; 108: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). For sedimentation equilibrium experiments on nectin-1-EC and nectin-1-EC-4mut, the protein solutions were centrifuged at concentrations of 1.20, 0.56, and 0.24 mg/ml. The rotor speeds were 12,000 rpm (11,612 × g) and 15,000 rpm (18,144 × g) for nectin-1-EC, and 15,000 rpm (18,144 × g) and 18,000 rpm (26,127 × g) for nectin-1-EC-4mut. The equilibrium concentration profiles were recorded by monitoring absorbance at 280 nm across the centrifugation cell with a radial increment of 0.001 cm in the continuous scanning mode. All measurements were carried out at a constant temperature of 4 °C. Sedimentation equilibrium data were analyzed using Beckman analytical software (34McRorie D.K. Voelker P.J.

For a trans-interaction-deficient mutant, cDNA for the full-length mouse nectin-1α mutant (F129L) was used instead of nectin-1-4mut. The cells cultured on coverslips for 2–3 days were fixed in 1% formaldehyde, and blocked in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 60 min without permeabilization.

The inner membrane transporter MacB requires the outer membrane factor TolC and the periplasmic adaptor protein MacA to form a functional tripartite complex. In this study, we used a chimeric protein containing the tip region of the TolC α-barrel to investigate the role of the TolC α-barrel tip region with regard to its interaction with MacA. The chimeric protein formed a stable complex with MacA, and the complex formation was abolished by substitution at the functionally essential residues located at the MacA α-helical tip region. Electron microscopic study delineated that this complex was made by tip-to-tip interaction between the tip regions of the α-barrels of TolC and MacA, which correlated well with the TolC and MacA complex calculated by molecular dynamics. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the MacA hexamer interacts with TolC in a tip-to-tip manner, and implies the manner by which MacA induces opening of the TolC channel.

Drug resistance of microbial pathogens presents an increasing threat to public health (1Levy S.B. Marshall B. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: S122-S129Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar). In Gram-negative pathogens, high levels of intrinsic or acquired drug resistance are conferred by three-component multidrug efflux pumps, which are composed of the inner membrane transporter, the outer membrane factor (OMF), and the periplasmic membrane fusion protein (MFP) 4The abbreviations used are: MFP, periplasmic membrane fusion protein; MIC, minimum inhibitory concentration; MD, molecular dynamics.

These tripartite complexes span the entire two-membrane envelope of Gram-negative bacteria and expel various molecules into the medium, utilizing a proton gradient or ATP hydrolysis. The inner membrane transporters belong to one of three structurally dissimilar superfamilies of proteins: resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND), ATP-binding cassette (ABC), or major facilitator. The inner membrane transporters expel the substrates through the central channel of the OMF, as exemplified by Escherichia coli TolC, which spans the outer membrane (6Fralick J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5803-5805Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The MFP, which connects the other two components in the periplasm, is also essential for the function of the efflux pump. In E. coli, AcrAB-TolC acts as a major multidrug efflux pump (7Hirakata Y. Srikumar R. Poole K. Gotoh N. Suematsu T. Kohno S. Kamihira S. Hancock R.E. Speert D.P. J. Exp.

The homotrimeric TolC is embedded in the outer membrane and continues ∼100 Å into the periplasmic space as an α-barrel composed of six α-hairpins that form the wall of a 35-Å inner-diameter cylindrical channel (10Koronakis V. Sharff A. Koronakis E. Luisi B. Hughes C. Nature. 2000; 405: 914-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). The TolC channel is closed at the aperture end and the channel opening is induced only in the presence of the other components, the mechanism of which remains to be determined at the molecular level. The MacAB-TolC pump has been identified in E. coli; the inner membrane transporter MacB belongs to non-canonic ABC-type transporters (8Tikhonova E.B. Devroy V.K. Lau S.Y. Zgurskaya H.I. Mol.

The structures of E. coli MacA and AcrA and its Pseudomonas aeruginosa homologue, MexA, have been determined and revealed that MFPs are elongated, sickle-shaped molecules comprised of four linearly arranged domains (membrane proximal (MP), β-barrel, lipoyl, and α-hairpin domains) (14Mikolosko J.

It is worth noting that MacA was crystallized as a funnel-like hexameric assembly with an α-barrel composed of six α-hairpins from each protomer. Genetic and biochemical studies further revealed that this hexameric assembly of MacA and the tip region of the α-barrel are functionally important. Based on the structural complementarity between the six-α-hairpin-membered α-barrels of MacA and TolC, we speculated a tip-to-tip interaction between MacA and TolC (17Xu Y. Sim S.H. Song S. Piao S.

However, it remains to be elucidated which region of TolC makes contact with α-barrels of MacA. To investigate the assembly mechanism of MacA-TolC interaction, we made a complex of MacA and TolC using a chimeric protein containing the tip regions of the α-barrel of TolC. Subsequent study of the complex revealed the assembly of MacA-TolC and provided insight into how the TolC channel is opened in association with MacA binding. To construct the expression vector for Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (hereafter referred to as Aa) MacA-TolCαR1-hybrid, DNA fragments encoding Aa MacA residues 29–123, E. coli TolC residues 136–159, and Aa MacA residues 148–394 (with/without the stop codon) were joined using the overlapping PCR technique, and then ligated into the NcoI and XhoI sites of pPROEX-HTA (Invitrogen), generating the vector pPRO-AaMacA-TolCαR1 and pPRO-AaMacA-TolCαR1-nostop, respectively. To construct the expression vector for Aa MacA-TolCαR2-hybrid, DNA fragments encoding Aa MacA residues 29–123, E. coli TolC residues 354–377, and Aa MacA residues 148–394 (including stop codon), were joined by the method described above, resulting in the vector pPRO-AaMacA-TolCαR2. To construct the expression vector for MacA-TolCα-hybrid-dimer, the DNA fragments encoding Aa MacA-TolCαR2-hybrid were inserted into the pPRO-AaMacA-TolCαR1-nostop vector at the XhoI and HindIII sites, resulting in the vector pPRO-MacA-TolCα-hybrid-dimer. To construct the expression vector for Aa MacA-TdeAαR1-hybrid, the DNA fragments encoding Aa MacA residues 29–123, Aa TdeA residues 192–215, Aa MacA residues 148–394 were joined using the overlapping PCR technique, and then ligated into the NcoI and XhoI sites of pPROEX-HTA (Invitrogen). The sequences of the primers used for the plasmids are described in supplemental Table S1. Overnight grown cultures in LB medium containing appropriate antibiotics (100 μg of kanamycin, 100 μg of ampicillin, and/or 5 μg of tetracycline per ml) were 1 to 100 diluted in the same medium. At A600 = 0.1, the expression of proteins were induced by adding 0.1% arabinose and (/or) 1 mm IPTG to the cultures and incubated two more hours. Approximately 104 of the induced cells were then added to the same medium containing 0.1% arabinose and (/or) 1 mm IPTG and erythromycin at increasing concentrations. Cultures were grown for additional 16–20 h, and the lowest concentration of erythromycin that completely inhibited growth was designated as the MIC. To determine the molecular size of proteins or to learn whether the two proteins form a complex in solution, size-exclusion chromatography was performed at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min on Superdex S-200 HR 10/30 (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0) containing 150 mm NaCl. ITC measurements were performed at 20 °C using a VP-ITC calorimeter (Microcal, Inc.). For E. coli MacA and Aa MacA-TolCα-hybrid-dimer, E. coli MacA and Aa MacA-TolCα-hybrid-dimer were concentrated to 318 and 12.5 μm, respectively, in a buffer containing that 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.0) and 150 mm NaCl. For Aa MacA and MacA-TdeAαR1-hybrid, the proteins were concentrated to 133 and 7 μm, respectively, in the same buffer. To titrate 1.4 ml of the MacA-TolCα-hybrid-dimer (or MacA-TdeAαR1-hybrid) solution, the E. coli MacA (or Aa MacA) solution was used as a titrant. The titration experiment was carried out by 20 10-μl injections. Blank titrations, which were carried out by injecting ligand into the buffer depending on the particular experiment, were subtracted from each data set. Data were acquired using a Tecnai F20 Twin transmission electron microscope operating at 120 kV, using a dose of ∼15 e−/Å2 and a nominal underfocus ranging from 1.0 to 2.0 μm. 1,292 images were automatically collected at a nominal magnification of 80,000× at a pixel size of 0.105 nm at the specimen level. All images were recorded with a Tietz F415 4k × 4k pixel CCD camera (15 μm pixel) utilizing the Leginon data collection software (19Suloway C. Pulokas J. Fellmann D. Cheng A. Guerra F. Quispe J. Stagg S. Potter C.S. Carragher B. J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 151: 41-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Experimental data were processed by the Appion software package (20Lander G.C. Stagg S.M. Voss N.R. Cheng A. Fellmann D. Pulokas J. Yoshioka C. Irving C. Mulder A. Lau P.W. Lyumkis D. Potter C.S. Carragher B. J. Struct.

Ultramicroscopy. 2003; 94: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) from the micrographs and extracted at a box size of 448 pixels. Stacked particles were binned by a factor of 2 for the final reconstruction. The final stack contained 4,858 particles. The initial model was created by applying D6-symmetry (6-fold symmetry along the z axis, 2-fold rotational axis 90° from z) on manually selected two-dimensional averages, which were formed using the XMIPP reference-free maximum likelihood alignment procedure (22Scheres S.H.

The three-dimensional reconstruction was carried out using the IMAGIC-5 reconstruction package (23van Heel M. Harauz G. Orlova E.V. Schmidt R. Schatz M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Resolution was assessed by calculating the Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) at a cutoff of 0.5, which provided a value of 25 Å resolution. Automatic Docking was performed using the Chimera software package (24Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 157: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). We adopted a model for an open structure of TolC in which the structure of TolC α-barrel region was replaced by that of MacA hexamer. Having selected a putative cogwheel-to-cogwheel binding conformation for TolC-MacA complex consisting of 2,844 residues in total, we subjected it to the in silico molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to come up with an equilibrium complex-structure. The MD simulation of TolC-MacA complex in the explicit TIP3 water was performed with the atomistic force-field AMBER/v11.ff99SB under the SHAKE option. The TolC-MacA complex was immersed in a periodic rectangular three-dimensional box of TIP3 water molecules. The minimal distance of the TolC-MacA complex protein from the box boundary was 0.8 nm, containing about 108,067 water molecules. The cut-off distance for the electrostatic and van der Waals interaction was 0.8 nm, and the particle mesh Ewald method was used to include the long-range interactions. We first minimized the energy of the TolC-MacA complex by the steepest descent method for 1,000 steps followed by the conjugate gradient method for 1,000 steps. The water molecules were heated for 20 ps from 0 to 330 K. Then the MD simulation was performed with the NPT ensemble with a 2-fs integration time step. The temperature was regulated by Langevin dynamics, and the pressure was kept at 1 atm. Starting from an initial putative TolC-MacA complex, the MD simulation ran for 1.2 ns, from which the coordinates of all atoms were saved every 2 ps for the detailed analysis of not only the thermodynamic stability but also the structural characteristics of the TolC-MacA complex. The binding energy of the complex was calculated using the MM/GBSA algorithm in AMBER/v11. The solvent-accessible surface was calculated using AREAIMOL in the CCP4 Suite (25CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). The figures were generated with the program PYMOL (26DeLano W. The PyMOL User's Manual. DeLano Scientific, Palo Alto2002Google Scholar). A previous study on the crystal packing of Aa MacA provided clues into how the MacA hexamer contacts the TolC trimer (18Yum S. Xu Y. Piao S. Sim S.H. Kim H.M. Jo W.S. Kim K.J. Kweon H.S. Jeong M.H. Jeon H. Lee K. Ha N.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 387: 1286-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The α-barrels from the neighboring Aa MacA hexameric units made a cogwheel-to-cogwheel interaction in a tip-to-tip manner in the crystal, suggesting that the α-barrel tip region of the upper Aa MacA hexamer might mimic the structure of the TolC aperture tip region in the MacA-TolC complex because of the resemblance between the α-barrels of the TolC trimer and the MacA hexamer. Even the inclinations of the α-hairpins in the α-barrels of the MacA and TolC are similar, although the central channel of the α-barrels of TolC becomes narrower at the end, while the diameter of the channel is virtually unchanged in MacA (18Yum S. Xu Y. Piao S. Sim S.H. Kim H.M. Jo W.S. Kim K.J. Kweon H.S. Jeong M.H. Jeon H. Lee K. Ha N.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 387: 1286-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Given the interaction between the two MacA hexameric units in the crystal, albeit forced by the crystallization, and the similarities of MacA and TolC at the α-barrel tip, we hypothesized that the conformation of the tip region of the α-barrel of TolC might resemble that of MacA, and that only the α-barrel tip region of TolC is involved in the MacA binding. To test our hypothesis, we designed a chimeric form of Aa MacA in which the α-helical tip region (24 amino acids, residues 124–147) was substituted with the corresponding region of the TolC aperture tip region (24 amino acids, residues 136–159 or 354–377) (Fig. 1A). Because the TolC protomer comprises two structural repeats, two α-hairpins are found at the aperture tip region in a TolC protomer. To mimic the TolC protomer that contains two α-hairpins, we constructed the chimeric protein in two steps. Two chimeric Aa MacA proteins, whose α-helical tip regions were replaced with the first or second aperture tip region of TolC, were designated as Aa MacA-TolCαR1-hybrid and Aa MacA-TolCαR2-hybrid, respectively. Then the two chimeric proteins were linked in tandem to generate the Aa MacA-TolCα-hybrid-dimer construct, whose α-helical tip region was replaced with the first or second aperture tip region of TolC (Fig. 1). Because Aa MacA is present as a stable hexamer in solution unlike other MacA proteins, we chose Aa MacA as the scaffold for the construction of the chimeric protein to generate the hexameric assembly. The chimeric protein Aa MacA-TolCα-hybrid-dimer had the same molecular size in solution and the same circular dichroism spectrum as the hexameric Aa MacA protein (supplemental Figs. S1, S2, and S3), indicating that the chimeric protein exhibited a funnel-like hexameric structure with a similar fold, as expected. We used this chimeric protein as the putative structural imitators of the TolC α-barrel tip region in this study (Fig. 1D). To probe the interaction between E. coli MacA and the TolC α-barrel tip region, size exclusion chromatography was applied using the purified proteins of E. coli MacA and the chimeric protein Aa MacA-TolCα-hybrid-dimer. The Aa MacA-TolCα-hybrid-dimer protein showed a strong interaction with the wild-type E. coli MacA protein (Fig. 2). The E. coli MacA was co-eluted with Aa MacA-TolCα-hybrid-dimer as a higher oligomer than the Aa MacA-TolCα-hybrid-dimer protein itself, while the E. coli MacA alone was eluted as a monomer (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the nonfunctional E. coli MacA variants containing a single amino acid substitution at the α-hairpin domains (R131A, L135D, or S143D) (17Xu Y. Sim S.H. Song S. Piao S. Kim H.M. Jin X.L. Lee K. Ha N.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 394: 962-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) did not interact with the Aa MacA-TolCα-hybrid-dimer, while E. coli MacA-S143A variant protein showed partial affinity for MacA-TolCα-hybrid-dimer, which is in good agreement with the functionality of MacA-S143A in vivo (Fig. 2E and Table 1). These results indicate that the α-helical tip region of MacA is important in the binding to the TolC α-barrel and that interactions between MacA and MacA-TolCα-hybrid-dimer reflect the functional binding between MacA and TolC (Fig. 2, C, D, and F). These results demonstrate that a pair of the TolC aperture consisting of 24 amino acids is sufficient to interact with the MacA α-helical tip region.TABLE 1The in vivo effect of a mutation at residue Ser-143 on E. coli MacA functionBackgroundBW25113ΔacrABPlasmidpKAN6pMacAB1pMacAB1-S143DpMacAB1-S143AmacA-WtS143DS143AmacB-WtWtWtMIC (μg/ml) ErythromycinaErythromycin concentrations used to measure MICs were 0, 1.3, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, and 20.0 μg/ml.1.320.01.3aErythromycin concentrations used to measure MICs were 0, 1.3, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, and 20.0 μg/ml.20.0a Erythromycin concentrations used to measure MICs were 0, 1.3, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, and 20.0 μg/ml. Open table in a new tab Given that the periplasmic domain of the TolC protomer largely consists of two α-hairpin units, we tested whether one α-hairpin unit is sufficient for the binding to MacA. Interestingly, the molecular size of Aa MacA-TolCαR1-hybrid and Aa MacA-TolCαR2-hybrid were measured to be two times bigger in solution than that of Aa MacA, indicating that the chimeric proteins having only one repeat of TolC may form a dimer of the funnel-like hexamer (supplemental Fig. S1). The interactions between E. coli MacA and the hybrid proteins were also evaluated by size exclusion chromatography. The Aa MacA-TolCαR1-hybrid formed a complex with E. coli MacA protein as strong as the Aa MacA-TolCα-hybrid-dimer (Fig. 3A). This result further indicates that the dimer of the hexameric unit of Aa MacA-TolCαR1 is disrupted by the interaction with E. coli MacA. To examine the role of the E. coli MacA tip region, we evaluated the binding of E. coli MacA variants containing a mutation at the conserved Arg-131, Leu-135, or Ser-143, which are located at the tip region, with Aa MacA-TolCαR1. All the mutations partially or fully abolished to form a complex with Aa MacA-TolCαR1-hybrid on the size-exclusion chromatographic column, as was observed for Aa MacA-TolCα-hybrid-dimer (supplemental Fig. S4), indicating the importance of the α-barrel tip region of MacA in binding to the TolC α-barrel tip region. These results suggest that TolC repeat 1 may be responsible for the binding to MacA. In addition, Aa MacA-TolCαR2-hybrid, which has the α-hairpin end of TolC repeat 2, did not interact with E. coli MacA in vitro (Fig. 3A). Thus, these observations suggest that the six-bladed cogwheel structure composed of six α-hairpins of TolC or its homologues is important in interaction with MacA. To measure the binding constant between MacA-TolCα-hybrid-dimer and E. coli MacA, ITC experiments were performed. We carried out experiments in which E. coli MacA in the injector syringe was titrated into MacA-TolCα-hybrid-dimer. The heat by the injection confirmed the interaction between the two proteins (supplemental Fig. S5). However, we failed to calculate the thermodynamic parameters from the titration curve. The titration curve becomes complicated due to the heat generated from the hexamerization of the monomeric E. coli MacA at higher concentrations. To exclude this hexamerization effect of E. coli MacA, we chose Aa MacA that is present as a hexamer even at extremely low concentration (18Yum S. Xu Y. Piao S. Sim S.H. Kim H.M. Jo W.S. Kim K.J. Kweon H.S. Jeong M.H. Jeon H. Lee K. Ha N.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 387: 1286-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To make the cognate partner of Aa MacA, we generated a hybrid protein (MacA-TdeAαR1-hybrid) utilizing TdeA, an A. actinomycetemcomitans ortholog of TolC. The MacA-TdeAαR1-hybrid protein contains 24 amino acids of Aa TdeA corresponding to the α-helical tip of TolC repeat 1. We next confirmed that MacA-TdeAαR1-hybrid is able to form a complex with Aa MacA in the size exclusion chromatography, (Fig. 3B), as observed in MacA-TolCαR1-hybrid and E. coli MacA. Once again, the ITC experiments were carried out in which Aa MacA was titrated to MacA-TdeAαR1-hybrid. The results revealed that Aa MacA and Aa MacA-TdeAαR1-hybrid strongly interacted with an average KD of 0.69 nm, suggesting that strong interactions between tip regions of MacA and TolC homologs stem from their structural similarities (supplemental Fig. S6). Given the strong interaction between MacA and MacA-TolCα-hybrid-dimer, we analyzed the complex fractions on the size exclusion chromatographic column. As shown in supplemental Fig. S7, the intensities of the MacA-TolCα-hybrid-dimer protein band and the E. coli MacA protomer protein band on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel were measured. Similar intensities of the protein bands that were stained with Coomassie Blue indicate an equimolar binding of these proteins. Because the chimeric protein contains two units of MacA corresponding to one TolC protomer, our result thus suggests the 2:1 binding stoichiometry between a MacA protomer and an Aa MacA-TolCα-hybrid-dimer. To visualize how MacA interacts with the TolC α-barrel tip region, a complex composed of E. coli MacA and Aa MacA-TolCα-hybrid-dimer was applied to electron microscopy. A projection matching approach using negatively stained single particles of the complex resulted in a three-dimensional density map at 26 Å resolution (FSC = 0.5) (Fig. 4, A and B). We constructed three starting models with different symmetries (C3, C6, and D6) by directly reconstructing a single selected side view class average using the applied symmetry factor. Additionally, a lowpass filtered density map of the generated pdb model (also used for docking, see below) was used for comparison. We refined the C3 and C6 initial models with their respective symmetries, the D6 starting model using C6-symmetry and the simulated density map using C1-symmetry. After several iterations all three-dimensional models converged to C6 symmetry. Despite the high similarity of the two protomers, an additional symmetry axis orthogonal to the 6-fold (D6-symmetry) could not be identified at this resolution. The map comprises a volume of 985,200 Å and exhibits a characteristic dumb-bell-like (bridge symbol) side view with flared ends at both sides, a motif which can also easily be identified in the raw images (Fig. 4, A and B). A channel of varying diameter is observed through the center of the structure. The channel appears to be closed at the very end of one side but this is likely a low resolution artifact, as it disappears at a lower threshold, and is not evident in the crystal structure. We refrained from applying any masking during refinement to prevent bias in the reconstruction. To dock into the density map, we generated a model for the complex in the intermeshing cogwheel fashion, where E. coli MacA (PDB code: 3FPP) is at the lower part and the chimeric Aa MacA containing the E. coli TolC α-barrel tip regions is at the upper part (Fig. 4C). The relative position between the lower part and the upper part was determined based on the two hexameric units of the Aa MacA structure that formed the intermeshing cogwheel interaction in the crystal structure (Fig. 4D), because we hypothesized that the overall structure of the two molecules was similar to Aa MacA and the packing interaction in the Aa MacA crystal may represent the binding mode between MacA and the TolC tip region (18Yum S. Xu Y. Piao S. Sim S.H. Kim H.M. Jo W.S. Kim K.J. Kweon H.S. Jeong M.H. Jeon H. Lee K. Ha N.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 387: 1286-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Docking of the PDB structure into the experimental map using the automatic docking program Chimera (24Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 157: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) showed an excellent correlation between the map and the PDB structure. However, at this resolution we could not distinguish the two ends; only one of two possibilities is shown here (Fig. 4, C and E). The overall dimensions of the intermeshing α-barrels were exactly matched to the central long cylinder. In the funnel-mouth parts located on both sides, the lipoyl and the β-barrel domains were fitted into the density map adjacent to the long cylinder. However, the density at both ends was not docked by the model, which can be justified by the missing MP domain in the model. The overall size of the MP domain of P. aeruginosa MexA (27Symmons M.F. Bokma E. Koronakis E. Hughes C. Koronakis V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 7173-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) correlates very well with the undocked electron density map from the electron microscopy (data not shown). Collectively, the electron density map is well matched to the generated model based on the intermeshing cogwheel interaction. Thus, our results demonstrate that TolC α-barrel tip regions make direct contact with the MacA α-barrel in an intermeshing cogwheel fashion. Our results further suggest that the α-barrel of the MacA hexamer may reflect the TolC channel open state when docked to MacA. To examine the feasibility of the cogwheel binding conformation between TolC and MacA and the stability of the tip-to-tip interaction between them, in silico molecular dynamics simulation was performed based on the crystal structures of TolC and MacA. We used a model of an open structure of TolC, in which the TolC α-barrel exhibits the conformation of the α-barrel structure of the MacA hexamer, as the starting model (Fig. 5A), because the TolC α-helical tip exhibiting the MacA α-barrel conformation showed a strong binding affinity to MacA in our experiment. We first generated putative cogwheel-to-cogwheel binding conformations by bringing the MacA hexamer close to TolC based on the electron microscopic tomography. The energy of a whole TolC-MacA complex, consisting of 2,844 residues, was minimized to remove the steric constraints (Fig. 5A). Subjecting this initial conformation to molecular dynamic simulation in the explicit TIP3 water using the atomistic force-field AMBER/v11.ff99SB produced an equilibrium structure of the TolC-MacA complex (Fig. 5B). Fig. 5D demonstrates how well the tip regions of the open form of the TolC α-barrel fit and complement those of the MacA α-barrel. The binding energy of this equilibrium cogwheel-to-cogwheel structure was stronger than that of the initial putative structure by 50%, demonstrating that the cogwheel binding conformation between TolC and MacA is possible and that the tip-to-tip interaction between them is more stable than that of initial putative structures. Formation of the docked complex buries 2,321 Å3 of solvent-exposed surface, which is comparable to the models based on in vivo chemical cross-linking experiments by Lobedanz et al. (28Lobedanz S.

The crystal structures of MacA, suggested that MacA may function as a funnel-like hexamer (18Yum S. Xu Y. Piao S. Sim S.H. Kim H.M. Jo W.S. Kim K.J. Kweon H.S. Jeong M.H. Jeon H. Lee K. Ha N.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 387: 1286-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies revealed that its hexamerization is important for the function of the MacAB-TolC pump (18Yum S. Xu Y. Piao S. Sim S.H. Kim H.M. Jo W.S. Kim K.J. Kweon H.S. Jeong M.H. Jeon H. Lee K. Ha N.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 387: 1286-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and that the α-barrel tip region of the MacA hexamer plays a crucial role in binding to TolC (17Xu Y. Sim S.H. Song S. Piao S. Kim H.M. Jin X.L. Lee K. Ha N.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 394: 962-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, these studies did not show the nature of the interactions between the α-barrel tip region of the MacA hexamer and TolC, and which part of TolC is important in binding to MacA. We only speculated that the α-barrel tip region of MacA may make a tip-to-tip interaction with the TolC α-barrel although it is also possible that the α-barrel tip region of MacA wraps outside of the TolC α-barrel, as has been hypothesized for interaction between AcrA and TolC in the formation of AcrAB-TolC efflux pump (27Symmons M.F.

For this reason, in this study we explored the role of the α-barrel tip region of TolC in the binding to MacA using a chimeric protein containing the TolC α-barrel tip region, which indicated a tip-to-tip interaction between them. Electron microscopy studies further clearly showed that MacA is present as a homohexamer when binding to the TolC α-barrel tip region and that the TolC α-barrel tip and the MacA α-barrel tip interact in a tip-to-tip intermeshing fashion. Based on our results, we built an assembly model of TolC and MacA, where the two proteins interact in an intermeshing cogwheel-like manner. Molecular dynamics analysis showed that the cogwheel binding conformation is both possible and stable. Moreover, we present evidence that repeat 1 in TolC plays a more important role in the binding to MacA. Taken together, we conclude that MacA functions as a homohexamer in its functional state and forms an intermeshing cogwheel-type complex with TolC. Because the TolC α-barrel tip in the chimeric protein may represent the conformation of TolC in complex with MacA, our results also suggest that the conformation of TolC in the open state is the same as that of the chimer protein or the MacA hexamer, providing a clue how the opening of the TolC channel is induced. However, it is still unclear which residues are directly involved in this process. To reveal the assembly of this type of tripartite pump at the atomic level, crystal structures of the complex are needed. We thank Erica Jacovetty for assistance with EM data collection.

https://openalex.org/W2037094440,"HER-2 is a member of the EGF receptor family and is overexpressed in 20-30% of breast cancers. HER-2 overexpression causes increased expression of VEGF at both the RNA and protein levels. HER-2 and VEGF are therefore considered good targets for cancer treatment, which has led to the development of two humanized monoclonal antibodies (mAb) pertuzumab and bevacizumab. Although passive immunotherapy with these Abs are approved for treatment of advanced breast cancer, a number of concerns exist. Treatment is expensive, has a limited duration of action, and is usually accompanied by serious side effects. We hypothesized that therapy with conformational peptide mimics aimed at blocking receptor-ligand interaction is potentially safer with little toxicity, cheaper with a longer half-life, and has greater penetrating abilities than mAbs. We designed and synthesized peptides based on the binding of HER-2 with pertuzumab and VEGF with VEGFR2. We show that treatment with the peptide mimics induces potent anti-tumor responses in vitro as determined by cell viability, proliferation, and HER2 phosphorylation assays. We also demonstrate in a transplantable BALB/c mouse tumor model that treatment with the peptide mimics resulted in a greater delay in tumor growth and development. Similarly, treatment with the peptide mimics inhibited angiogenesis in vivo as assessed by a Matrigel plug assay. To address the problem of degradability of L-amino acid peptides in vivo, we synthesized the retro-inverso D-peptide mimics that resulted in higher efficacy in treatment. Our study shows that combination treatment with HER-2 and VEGF peptide mimics provides greater efficacy than individual treatments."

To investigate how these changes are transmitted to the hormone-binding site, we developed a sensitive assay using a synthesized thyroxine fluorophore and solved the crystal structures of reactive loop cleaved TBG together with its complexes with thyroxine, the thyroxine fluorophores, furosemide, and mefenamic acid. Cleavage of the reactive loop results in its complete insertion into the β-sheet A and a substantial but incomplete decrease in binding affinity in both TBG and CBG. We show here that the direct interaction between residue Thr342 of the reactive loop and Tyr241 of the hormone binding site contributes to thyroxine binding and release following reactive loop insertion. However, a much larger effect occurs allosterically due to stretching of the connecting loop to the top of the D helix (hD), as confirmed in TBG with shortening of the loop by three residues, making it insensitive to the S-to-R transition. The transmission of the changes in the hD loop to the binding pocket is seen to involve coherent movements in the s2/3B loop linked to the hD loop by Lys243, which is, in turn, linked to the s4/5B loop, flanking the thyroxine-binding site, by Arg378. Overall, the coordinated movements of the reactive loop, hD, and the hormone binding site allow the allosteric regulation of hormone release, as with the modulation demonstrated here in response to changes in temperature.

https://openalex.org/W2052508951,"Patients infected with HIV exhibit orders of magnitude differences in their set-point levels of the plasma viral load. As to what extent this variation is due to differences in the efficacy of the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response in these patients is unclear. Several studies have shown that HIV-infected CD4+ T cells also present viral epitopes that are recognized by CTLs before the productive stage of infection, i.e., during the intracellular eclipse phase before the infected cell starts to produce new viral particles. Here, we use mathematical modeling to investigate the potential impact of early killing of HIV-infected cells on viral replication. We suggest that the majority of CTL-mediated killing could occur during the viral eclipse phase, and that the killing of virus-producing cells could be substantially lower at later stages due to MHC-I-down-regulation. Such a mechanism is in agreement with several experimental observations that include CD8+ T cell depletion and antiretroviral drug treatment. This indicates a potentially important role of CTL-mediated killing during the non-productive stage of HIV-infected cells."
https://openalex.org/W2070892794,"The etiology of a variety of chronic inflammatory disorders has been attributed to the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. Herein, we identified a link between epigenetic regulation and IL-13-driven eotaxin-3 in the pathogenesis of chronic allergic inflammation. We first demonstrated that the cAMP-responsive element (CRE) site in the eotaxin-3 promoter affects IL-13-induced eotaxin-3 promoter activity. Furthermore, the CRE-binding protein-binding protein (CBP), a histone acetyltransferase, induced base-line and IL-13-induced eotaxin-3 promoter activity. Additionally, IL-13 treatment promoted global histone 3 acetylation as well as the formation of a complex containing CBP and STAT6 and the subsequent acetylation of histone 3 at the eotaxin-3 promoter. CBP gene silencing decreased IL-13-induced transcription of eotaxin-3. Conversely, inhibition of histone deacetylation increased IL-13-induced eotaxin-3 production. Clinical studies demonstrated markedly increased global acetylation of histone 3 in the inflamed tissue of patients with allergic inflammation. Collectively, these results identify an epigenetic mechanism involving CBP and chromatin remodeling in regulating IL-13-induced chemokine transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2055763564,"Group B streptococcus (GBS) strains with the highest ability to bind to human fibrinogen belong to the highly invasive clonal complex (CC) 17. To investigate the fibrinogen-binding mechanisms of CC17 strains, we determined the prevalence of fibrinogen-binding genes (fbsA and fbsB), and fbs regulator genes (rogB encoding an fbsA activator, rovS encoding an fbsA repressor and rgf encoding a two-component system [TCS] whose role on fbs genes was not determined yet) in a collection of 134 strains representing the major CCs of the species. We showed that specific gene combinations were related to particular CCs; only CC17 strains contained the fbsA, fbsB, and rgf genes combination. Non polar rgfAC deletion mutants of three CC17 serotype III strains were constructed. They showed a 3.2- to 5.1-fold increase of fbsA transcripts, a 4.8- to 6.7-fold decrease of fbsB transcripts, and a 52% to 68% decreased fibrinogen-binding ability, demonstrating that the RgfA/RgfC TCS inhibits the fbsA gene and activates the fbsB gene. The relative contribution of the two fbs genes in fibrinogen-binding ability was determined by constructing isogenic fbsA, fbsB, deletion mutants of the three CC17 strains. The ability to bind to fibrinogen was reduced by 49% to 57% in ΔfbsA mutants, and by 78% to 80% in ΔfbsB mutants, suggesting that FbsB protein plays a greater role in the fibrinogen-binding ability of CC17 strains. Moreover, the relative transcription level of fbsB gene was 9.2- to 12.7-fold higher than that of fbsA gene for the three wild type strains. Fibrinogen-binding ability could be restored by plasmid-mediated expression of rgfAC, fbsA, and fbsB genes in the corresponding deletion mutants. Thus, our results demonstrate that a specific combination of fbs genes and fbs regulator genes account for the high fibrinogen-binding ability of CC17 strains that may participate to their enhanced invasiveness for neonates as compared to strains of other CCs."
https://openalex.org/W2045390691,"Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) species PAV occurs frequently in irrigated wheat fields worldwide and can be efficiently transmitted by aphids. Isolates of BYDV-PAV from different countries show great divergence both in genomic sequences and pathogenicity. Despite its economical importance, the genetic structure of natural BYDV-PAV populations, as well as of the mechanisms maintaining its high diversity, remain poorly explored. In this study, we investigate the dynamics of BYDV-PAV genome evolution utilizing time-structured data sets of complete genomic sequences from 58 isolates from different hosts obtained worldwide. First, we observed that BYDV-PAV exhibits a high frequency of homologous recombination. Second, our analysis revealed that BYDV-PAV genome evolves under purifying selection and at a substitution rate similar to other RNA viruses (3.158×10(-4) nucleotide substitutions/site/year). Phylogeography analyses show that the diversification of BYDV-PAV can be explained by local geographic adaptation as well as by host-driven adaptation. These results increase our understanding of the diversity, molecular evolutionary characteristics and epidemiological properties of an economically important plant RNA virus."
https://openalex.org/W2023589003,"Background Heat shock protein (hsp) 60 that provides “danger signal” binds to the surface of resting endothelial cells (EC) but its receptor has not yet been characterized. In mitochondria, hsp60 specifically associates with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase. We therefore examined the possible interaction between hsp60 and ATP synthase on EC surface. Methodology/Principal Findings Using Far Western blot approach, co-immunoprecipitation studies and surface plasmon resonance analyses, we demonstrated that hsp60 binds to the β-subunit of ATP synthase. As a cell surface-expressed molecule, ATP synthase is potentially targeted by anti-EC-antibodies (AECAs) found in the sera of patients suffering vasculitides. Based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting techniques with F1-ATP synthase as substrate, we established the presence of anti-ATP synthase antibodies at higher frequency in patients with primary vasculitides (group I) compared with secondary vasculitides (group II). Anti-ATP synthase reactivity from group I patients was restricted to the β-subunit of ATP synthase, whereas those from group II was directed to the α-, β- and γ-subunits. Cell surface ATP synthase regulates intracellular pH (pHi). In low extracellular pH medium, we detected abnormal decreased of EC pHi in the presence of anti-ATP synthase antibodies, irrespective of their fine reactivities. Interestingly, soluble hsp60 abrogated the anti-ATP synthase-induced pHi down-regulation. Conclusions/Significance Our results indicate that ATP synthase is targeted by AECAs on the surface of EC that induce intracellular acidification. Such pathogenic effect in vasculitides can be modulated by hsp60 binding on ATP synthase which preserves ATP synthase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2013789360,"Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNA molecules that act as post-transcriptional regulators and affect the regulation of protein-coding genes. Mostly transcribed by PolII, miRNA genes are regulated at the transcriptional level similarly to protein-coding genes. In this study we focus on human miRNAs. These miRNAs are involved in a variety of pathways and can affect many diseases. Our interest is on possible deregulation of the transcription initiation of the miRNA encoding genes, which is facilitated by variations in the genomic sequence of transcriptional control regions (promoters). Methodology Our aim is to provide an online resource to facilitate the investigation of the potential effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on miRNA gene regulation. We analyzed SNPs overlapped with predicted transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) in promoters of miRNA genes. We also accounted for the creation of novel TFBSs due to polymorphisms not present in the reference genome. The resulting changes in the original TFBSs and potential creation of new TFBSs were incorporated into the Dragon Database of Polymorphic Regulation of miRNA genes (dPORE-miRNA). Conclusions The dPORE-miRNA database enables researchers to explore potential effects of SNPs on the regulation of miRNAs. dPORE-miRNA can be interrogated with regards to: a/miRNAs (their targets, or involvement in diseases, or biological pathways), b/SNPs, or c/transcription factors. dPORE-miRNA can be accessed at http://cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/dpore and http://apps.sanbi.ac.za/dpore/.

https://openalex.org/W1969791985,"The SUMO ligase activity of Mms21/Nse2, a conserved member of the Smc5/6 complex, is required for resisting extrinsically induced genotoxic stress. We report that the Mms21 SUMO ligase activity is also required during the unchallenged mitotic cell cycle in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. SUMO ligase-defective cells were slow growing and spontaneously incurred DNA damage. These cells required caffeine-sensitive Mec1 kinase-dependent checkpoint signaling for survival even in the absence of extrinsically induced genotoxic stress. SUMO ligase-defective cells were sensitive to replication stress and displayed synthetic growth defects with DNA damage checkpoint-defective mutants such as mec1, rad9, and rad24. MMS21 SUMO ligase and mediator of replication checkpoint 1 gene (MRC1) were epistatic with respect to hydroxyurea-induced replication stress or methyl methanesulfonate-induced DNA damage sensitivity. Subjecting Mms21 SUMO ligase-deficient cells to transient replication stress resulted in enhancement of cell cycle progression defects such as mitotic delay and accumulation of hyperploid cells. Consistent with the spontaneous activation of the DNA damage checkpoint pathway observed in the Mms21-mediated sumoylation-deficient cells, enhanced frequency of chromosome breakage and loss was detected in these mutant cells. A mutation in the conserved cysteine 221 that is engaged in coordination of the zinc ion in Loop 2 of the Mms21 SPL-RING E3 ligase catalytic domain resulted in strong replication stress sensitivity and also conferred slow growth and Mec1 dependence to unchallenged mitotically dividing cells. Our findings establish Mms21-mediated sumoylation as a determinant of cell cycle progression and maintenance of chromosome integrity during the unperturbed mitotic cell division cycle in budding yeast."

Our separation is based on the use of strong anion exchange monolithic columns. Using a simple stepwise elution program we were able to purify ribosomes whose composition is comparable to those isolated by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, as confirmed by quantitative proteomic analysis (iTRAQ). The speed and simplicity of this approach could accelerate the study of many different aspects of ribosomal biology."
https://openalex.org/W2024384041,"Background Proteolytic degradation of extracellular matrix is a crucial step in the healing of incisional skin wounds. Thus, healing of skin wounds is delayed by either plasminogen-deficiency or by treatment with the broad-spectrum metalloproteinase (MP) inhibitor Galardin alone, while the two perturbations combined completely prevent wound healing. Both urokinase-type plasminogen activator and several matrix metallo proteinases (MMPs), such as MMP-3, -9 and -13, are expressed in the leading-edge keratinocytes of skin wounds, which may account for this phenotypic overlap between these classes of proteases. Methodology To further test that hypothesis we generated Mmp13;Plau and Mmp13;Plg double-deficient mice in a cross between Mmp13- and Plau-deficient mice as well as Mmp13- and Plg-deficient mice. These mice were examined for normal physiology in a large cohort study and in a well-characterized skin wound healing model, in which we made incisional 20 mm-long full-thickness skin wounds. Principal Findings While mice that are deficient in Mmp13 have a mean healing time indistinguishable to wild-type mice, wound healing in both Plau- and Plg-deficient mice is significantly delayed. Histological analysis of healed wounds revealed a significant increase in keratin 10/14 immunoreactive layers of kerationcytes in the skin surface in Mmp13;Plau double-deficient mice. Furthermore, we observe, by immunohistological analysis, an aberrant angiogenic pattern during wound healing induced by Plau-deficiency, which has not previously been described. Conclusions We demonstrate a phenotypic overlap, defined as an additional delay in wound healing in the double-deficient mice compared to the individual single-deficient mice, between MMP-13 and the plasminogen activation system in the process of wound healing, but not during gestation and in postnatal development. Thus, a dual targeting of uPA and MMP-13 might be a possible future strategy in designing therapies aimed at tissue repair or other pathological processes, such as cancer invasion, where proteolytic degradation is a hallmark."
https://openalex.org/W2043789714,"LITAF is a small cellular protein with an unknown function. The C-terminus of LITAF contains a highly conserved domain termed the SIMPLE-like domain (SLD), while the N-terminus contains two PPXY motifs that mediate protein-protein interactions with WW-domain containing proteins. LITAF also harbors two endosome/lysosome targeting sequences at its C-terminus, but there has been conflicting reports regarding its intracellular localization. Here, we demonstrate that LITAF is localized to the late endosome/lysosomal compartment in a variety of cell lines. We also show that Itch, a WW-domain containing protein, and LITAF strongly interact and that this interaction depends on the two PPXY motifs in the N-terminus of LITAF. Interestingly, co-expression of LITAF with Itch induces major changes in Itch intracellular localization, bringing Itch from the trans-Golgi network to lysosomes. We show that this re-localization is dependent upon the interaction with the PPXY sequences of LITAF, since disruption of these binding motifs completely abrogates Itch re-localization."
https://openalex.org/W2001123509,"Neuroblastoma is a type of pediatric cancer. The sensitivity of neuroblastoma (NB) cancer cells to chemotherapy and radiation is inhibited by the presence of antioxidants, such as glutathione (GSH), which is crucial in counteracting the endogenous production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We have previously demonstrated that cells depleted of GSH undergo apoptosis via oxidative stress and Protein kinase C (PKC) δ activation. In the present study, we transfected PKCδ in NB cells resistant to oxidative death induced by L-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine (BSO), a GSH-depleting agent. Cell responses, in terms of ROS production, apoptosis and DNA damage were evaluated. Moreover, PKCδ activation was monitored by analyzing the phosphorylation status of threonine 505 residue, carrying out PKC activity assay and investigating the subcellular localization of the kinase. The cell responses obtained in BSO-resistant cells were also compared with those obtained in BSO-sensitive cells subjected to the same experimental protocol. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that PKCδ induces DNA oxidation and ROS overproduction leading to apoptosis of BSO-resistant NB cells and potentiates the cytotoxic effects induced by BSO in sensitive cells. Moreover, PKCδ overexpression enhances the sensitivity of NB cells to etoposide, a well-characterised drug, commonly used in neuroblastoma therapy. Altogether our data provide evidence of a pro-oxidant role of PKCδ that might be exploited to design new therapeutic strategies aimed at selective killing of cancer cells and overcoming drug resistance. However, it becomes evident that a more detailed understanding of ROS-mediated signaling in cancer cells is necessary for the development of redox-modulated therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2076668669,"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) hypervariable region (HVR) sequences of prehistoric Polynesian chicken samples reflect dispersal of two haplogroups--D and E--by the settlers of the Pacific. The distribution of these chicken haplogroups has been used as an indicator of human movement. Recent analyses suggested similarities between prehistoric Pacific and South American chicken samples, perhaps reflecting prehistoric Polynesian introduction of the chicken into South America. These analyses have been heavily debated. The current distribution of the D and E lineages among contemporary chicken populations in the Western Pacific is unclear, but might ultimately help to inform debates about the movements of humans that carried them.We sought to characterize contemporary mtDNA diversity among chickens in two of the earliest settled archipelagos of Remote Oceania, the Marianas and Vanuatu.We generated HVR sequences for 43 chickens from four islands in Vanuatu, and for 5 chickens from Guam in the Marianas.Forty samples from Vanuatu and three from Guam were assigned to haplogroup D, supporting this as a Pacific chicken haplogroup that persists in the Western Pacific. Two haplogroup E lineages were observed in Guam and two in Vanuatu. Of the E lineages in Vanuatu, one was identical to prehistoric Vanuatu and Polynesian samples and the other differed by one polymorphism. Contrary to our expectations, we observed few globally distributed domesticate lineages not associated with Pacific chicken dispersal. This might suggest less European introgression of chickens into Vanuatu than expected. If so, the E lineages might represent lineages maintained from ancient Pacific chicken introductions. The Vanuatu sample might thus provide an opportunity to distinguish between maintained ancestral Pacific chicken lineages and replacement by global domesticates through genomic analyses, which could resolve questions of contemporary haplogroup E chicken relationships and inform interpretations of debated sequences from archaeological samples."

We previously showed that NO inhibits exocytosis by targeting NSF (17Matsushita K. Morrell C.N. Cambien B. Yang S.X. Yamakuchi M. Bao C. Hara M.R. Quick R.A. Cao W. O'Rourke B. Lowenstein J.M.

This S-nitrosylation of NSF diminishes its ability to disassemble the soluble NSF receptor attachment protein complex, a critical step in exocytosis and the cycle of vesicle trafficking. As a consequence, NO inhibits exocytosis both in vitro and in vivo. However, this study raised several questions. Does NO permanently inhibit NSF and vesicle trafficking? If not, how is NO removed from NSF to restore vesicle trafficking? Which intracellular proteins are capable of reducing NSF? One denitrosylase candidate is thioredoxin (19Benhar M. Forrester M.T. Stamler J.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Thioredoxin is a reductase that regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, and signaling (20Hoshino Y. Shioji K. Nakamura H. Masutani H. Yodoi J. Antioxid.

Thioredoxin has three isoforms, of which thioredoxin 1 (TRX1, also referred to as TXN or TRX) is expressed ubiquitously in the cytosol. TRX1 reduces oxidized cysteine residues on target proteins through an interaction with the TRX1 active site CXXC. Several intriguing studies have shown that TRX1 can also remove NO from nitrosothiol groups, both from purified proteins and from intracellular proteins (22Nikitovic D. Holmgren A. J. Biol.

We now show that TRX1 interacts with NSF, TRX1 removes NO from NSF, and TRX restores the capacity of endothelial cells to undergo exocytosis.

Pooled human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and endothelial growth medium-2 medium were obtained from Lonza-Clonetics (Walkersville, MD). HUVEC were grown in EGM-2 medium supplemented with 2% serum and growth factors in a kit. The endothelial exocytosis assay was performed with an ELISA as described previously (17Matsushita K. Morrell C.N. Cambien B. Yang S.X. Yamakuchi M. Bao C. Hara M.R. Quick R.A. Cao W. O'Rourke B. Lowenstein J.M. Pevsner J. Wagner D.D. Lowenstein C.J.

Briefly, HUVEC were placed in Opti-MEM I medium, pretreated with SNAP (0–20 μm for 6 h) or l-NAME (0–500 μm for 4 h), washed, and stimulated with 20 μm histamine. In some experiments, HUVEC pretreated with SNAP were placed in fresh Opti-MEM I medium without NO donors, incubated for up to 3 h, washed, and stimulated with 20 μm histamine. Then the amount of VWF released into the medium was measured by an ELISA. HL-60 cells were loaded with 5 μm Calcein-AM, washed with Opti-MEM I medium, and then added to HUVEC. The cells were co-cultured at 4 °C for 15 min and washed with Opti-MEM I medium. The number of adherent leukocytes was evaluated with a fluorescence microscope and a fluorescence microplate reader. S-nitrosylated proteins were analyzed by the biotin switch method as described previously (25Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Sci. STKE. 2001; 2001: pl1Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, protein-free thiols were blocked, and then S-nitrosothiols were reduced to yield free thiols, which were then covalently labeled with maleimide-biotin (Cayman Chemical). The biotinylated proteins were resuspended with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (137 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, 3 mm KCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate), pulled down by streptavidin-agarose, and detected by immunoblotting. Densitometric analysis was performed using the public-domain Java image processing program ImageJ. HUVEC and HeLa cells were transfected with either 5 nm Stealth RNAi TXN-HSS144377 or 5 nm Stealth RNAi negative control according to the guidelines for transfection with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX. The transfected cells were incubated for 48 h and then treated with SNAP (20–500 μm) or l-NAME (500 μm). HeLa cells were transfected with either Myc-tagged TRX1 (wild-type) or Myc-tagged TRX1 (C35S mutant) according to the guidelines for transfection with Lipofectin. The transfected cells were incubated for 24 h and then treated with SNAP (5–500 μm). The cells were washed with ice-cold Tris buffered saline and lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (137 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, 3 mm KCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, protease inhibitor mixture). An immunoprecipitation (IP) assay was performed according to the guidelines for IP with a mammalian c-Myc tag IP/Co-IP kit. HUVEC were treated with SNAP (500 μm) or l-NAME (500 μm) for 4 h. The cells were washed with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline and lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The IP assay was performed with anti-NSF mouse IgG and protein A/G PLUS-agarose. Data were analyzed by Student's t test for comparison of two groups. Statistical significance is defined as p < 0.05. We first explored the effect of NO upon exocytosis. We pretreated HUVEC with the NO donor SNAP or its control acetyl-penicillamine (AP), washed the cells, and then added histamine to trigger exocytosis. Histamine activates exocytosis, and SNAP inhibits exocytosis, as measured by endothelial release of VWF (Fig. 1A). Endogenous NO also inhibits exocytosis because the NOS inhibitor l-NAME increases histamine-induced VWF release (Fig. 1B). SNAP also inhibits endothelial exocytosis as measured by the leukocyte adhesion assay, which depends upon endothelial display of P-selectin (Fig. 1, C and D). Next, we determined how long NO inhibition persists. We pretreated HUVEC with SNAP, washed the cells, and allowed the cells to recover from NO for various times before stimulating exocytosis. SNAP inhibits exocytosis, and this inhibition disappears over 1 h (Fig. 1E). Taken together, these data show that NO inhibits exocytosis and that NO inhibition of exocytosis is reversible. We had previously shown that NO inhibits exocytosis in part by chemically modifying a component of the exocytic machinery, NSF. Because NO inhibition of exocytosis is reversible, we examined whether or not NO modification of NSF is reversible. We treated HeLa cells with SNAP, washed the cells, and permitted them to recover for 0–3 h. We then harvested cell lysates and measured S-nitrosylated NSF (NSF-SNO) by the biotin-switch assay. SNAP increases NSF-SNO (Fig. 2A). After the NO donor is removed, levels of NSF-SNO decrease (Fig. 2B). SNAP also increases S-nitrosylation of other proteins in HeLa cells such as GAPDH, and after the NO donor is removed, GAPDH-SNO levels decrease (data not shown). We also explored the effect of endogenous NO upon NSF. We treated HUVEC with the NOS inhibitor l-NAME for increasing amounts of time and measured NSF-SNO levels. At baseline, endothelial cells contain NSF-SNO, and after endogenous NO production is limited, NSF-SNO levels gradually decline (Fig. 2, C and D). Taken together, these data show that NO modification of NSF is reversible. We have previously shown that superoxide or NO can modify specific cysteine residues of NSF. Because others have shown that antioxidant enzymes such as TRX1 can reduce oxidized cysteine residues, we explored the effect of TRX1 upon NSF. We began by searching for an interaction between NSF and TRX1. To see if endogenous NSF and TRX1 interact, we immunoprecipitated HUVEC lysates with antibody to NSF and immunoblotted the precipitants with antibody to TRX1. Endogenous NSF and endogenous TRX1 interact (Figs. 3, A and B). We tested the effect of endogenous NO upon this interaction by pretreating endothelial cells with l-NAME and then repeating the immunoprecipitation. NSF and TRX1 fail to interact in the absence of NO (Fig. 3, A and B). We next transfected HeLa cells with a vector expressing myc-tagged wild-type TRX1, designated myc-TRX1 (WT), or with a vector expressing myc-tagged C35S mutant TRX1, designated myc-TRX1 (C35S). We chose to construct this particular mutant, TRX1 (C35S), so that TRX1 would form a more stable mixed disulfide intermediates with potential partners (26Verdoucq L. Vignols F. Jacquot J.P. Chartier Y. Meyer Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19714-19722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 27Schwertassek U. Balmer Y. Gutscher M. Weingarten L. Preuss M. Engelhard J. Winkler M. Dick T.P. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3086-3097Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). After the cells were transfected with TRX1 expression vectors, we added SNAP, immunoprecipitated with antibody to myc, and immunoblotted for endogenous NSF. TRX1 does not interact with NSF in untreated cells (Fig. 3C, left lanes). However, the NO donor SNAP increases the interaction of TRX1 with NSF (Fig. 3C, right lanes, and D). Furthermore, the mutant TRX1 interacts more with NSF than the wild-type TRX1 (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these data show that TRX1 interacts with NSF, possibly through the CXXC disulfide reductase domain of TRX1 (Cys-32 and Cys-35) and that NO influences this interaction. We hypothesized that TRX1 can remove NO from NSF-SNO. This hypothesis is supported by prior work showing that TRX1 can remove NO from purified proteins (22Nikitovic D. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19180-19185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 28Mitchell D.A. Marletta M.A. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and from proteins in cancer cell lines (24Benhar M. Forrester M.T. Hess D.T. Stamler J.S. Science. 2008; 320: 1050-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we knocked down HeLa expression of endogenous TRX1 by siRNA techniques, then treated the cells with the NO donor SNAP, and then washed the cells and permitted them to recover. The biotin-switch assay reveals that decreasing TRX1 slows the decline in NSF-SNO levels (Fig. 4A). TRX1 also controls levels of GAPDH-SNO (Fig. 4A). We also determined the effect of TRX1 upon endogenous NSF-SNO levels in endothelial cells. Knocking down TRX1 expression prolongs the expression of NSF-NO (Fig. 4, B and C). Taken together, our results suggest that TRX1 directly or indirectly plays a role in the removal of NO from NSF-NO. Finally, we determined the biological effect of TRX1 upon cell interactions. NSF is a critical component of the exocytic machinery in endothelial and other secretory cells, and we had previously shown that NO inhibits NSF and its role in exocytosis. We postulated that TRX1 would accelerate the recovery of exocytosis in cells exposed to NO. Accordingly, we knocked down TRX1 in endothelial cells, then treated the cells with the NO donor SNAP, washed the cells, and permitted them to recover. At various times during recovery, we stimulated exocytosis with histamine. Cells recover the ability to undergo exocytosis within 1 h after exposure to NO, but when TRX1 levels are decreased, recovery of exocytosis is prolonged (Fig. 5A). To explore the consequence of TRX1 upon cell interactions, we knocked down TRX1 in endothelial cells, treated them with an NO donor, allowed the cells to recover from NO treatment, and measured leukocyte adhesion. Control cells recover from NO and support leukocyte adhesion (Fig. 5B, left panel and C, left panel). However, after TRX1 silencing, cells recover from NO more slowly and have less leukocyte adhesion (Fig. 5B, right panel and C, right panel). Taken together, these data show that TRX1 speeds the recovery of exocytosis after NO treatment, enhancing leukocyte adhesion. The major finding of our study is that TRX1 removes NO from NSF, restoring the ability of cells to undergo exocytosis. These data provide an explanation for why NO inhibition of exocytosis is temporary. TRX1 may thus serve as an endogenous modulator of exocytosis. Our data extend the findings of other laboratories that show that TRX1 regulates S-nitrosylation of other proteins (29Lima, B., Forrester, M. T., Hess, D. T., Stamler, J. S., Circ. Res. 106, 633–646.Google Scholar). Nikitovic and Holmgren (22Nikitovic D. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19180-19185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) showed that TRX or the TRX reductase TR cleave S-nitroso-glutathione (GSNO) in solution in vitro, generating GSH and NO. Mitchell and Marletta (28Mitchell D.A. Marletta M.A. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) then demonstrated that TRX can transfer NO from GSNO to caspase 3 in solution in vitro. Next, Stoyanovsky and colleagues (23Sengupta R. Ryter S.W. Zuckerbraun B.S. Tzeng E. Billiar T.R. Stoyanovsky D.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 8472-8483Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) found that TRX removes NO from GSNO in solution and also in cells. Stamler and colleagues (24Benhar M. Forrester M.T. Hess D.T. Stamler J.S. Science. 2008; 320: 1050-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) then showed that TRX1 and TRX2 serve as endogenous denitrosylases. In particular, Stamler found that TRX isoforms can interact with S-nitrosylated caspase 3, denitrosylate caspase 3, and increase apoptosis. Our studies build on these prior works in several ways. First, we show that endogenous TRX1 regulates the NO content of an endogenous protein. Second, we study the role of TRX1 in modulating a signal from endogenous NO, as well as exogenous NO. Third, we show that NO modulates the interaction of TRX1 with a target protein. Finally, we also find that TRX1 regulation of an S-nitrosylated target protein has functional consequences, in this case the modulation of exocytosis. This study suggests an explanation as to why an inhibitor of vesicle trafficking does not damage target cells: NO inhibition of exocytosis is reversible. We previously found that NO inhibits exocytosis, in part by chemically modifying and inhibiting NSF (17Matsushita K. Morrell C.N. Cambien B. Yang S.X. Yamakuchi M. Bao C. Hara M.R. Quick R.A. Cao W. O'Rourke B. Lowenstein J.M. Pevsner J. Wagner D.D. Lowenstein C.J. Cell. 2003; 115: 139-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Although vesicle trafficking is critical to the functioning of all cells, NO treatment in low doses is not cytotoxic. Our current study shows that cells recover from NO inhibition of exocytosis within 1–3 h. This corresponds to a decrease of NSF-SNO within 1–3 h. However, if cellular levels of TRX1 are decreased, NSF-SNO is detected after 3 h of NO treatment (Fig. 4), and exocytosis is still inhibited 3 h after NO exposure (Fig. 4D). Thus TRX1 plays a role in protecting the exocytic machinery from permanent inactivation by NO. Are other proteins capable of removing NO from protein thiol groups (19Benhar M. Forrester M.T. Stamler J.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar)? Glutathione peroxidase can liberate NO from GSNO in vitro (30Hou Y. Guo Z. Li J. Wang P.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In the presence of transition metals, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase catalyzes the decomposition of GSNO. Xanthine oxidase has been reported to reduce GSNOP and Cys-NO (31Trujillo M. Alvarez M.N. Peluffo G. Freeman B.A. Radi R. J. Biol.

Nature. 2001; 410: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Superoxide dismutase has been reported to function as a GSNO denitrosylase, although its activity is weak (35Jourd'heuil D. Laroux F.S. Miles A.M. Wink D.A. Grisham M.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 361: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In addition, enzymes have been reported to remove NO from heme. For example, bacterial flavohemoglobin catalyzes the reaction of NO bound to heme with oxygen to produce nitrate (36Hausladen A. Gow A. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 10108-10112Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, a distinct set of enzymes are capable of metabolizing nitrosothiols in vitro and in vivo, and some of these enzymes might also be capable of regulating NSF and exocytosis. Our study implies that TRX1 is capable of promoting vascular inflammation. The conventional view is that TRX1 protects the vasculature from oxidant stress and decreases inflammation (37Yamawaki H. Haendeler J. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 38Yoshida T. Nakamura H. Masutani H. Yodoi J. Ann. N.Y. Acad.

For example, mice overexpressing TRX1 are resistant to inflammatory conditions such as cerebral ischemia, renal ischemia, adriamycin-induced cardiotoxicity, and pneumonia induced by pathogens or cytokines or toxins (40Takagi Y.

Circulation. 2002; 106: 1403-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In addition, TRX1 by binding to ASK1 inhibits vascular inflammation (46Yamawaki H. Pan S. Lee R.T. Berk B.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of TRX1 in the heart limits oxidative stress, decreases myocardial infarct size, and improves cardiac performance (47Turoczi T. Chang V.W. Engelman R.M. Maulik N. Ho Y.S. Das D.K. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In fact, exogenous TRX1 also diminished injury after cardiac ischemia and reperfusion (48Tao L. Gao E. Bryan N.S. Qu Y. Liu H.R. Hu A. Christopher T.A. Lopez B.L. Yodoi J. Koch W.J. Feelisch M. Ma X.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 11471-11476Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, some data suggest that TRX1 may play a proinflammatory role under some circumstances. For example, TRX1 increases the ability of NF-κB to bind to DNA by reducing Cys-62, thus increasing proinflammatory gene transcription (49Matthews J.R. Wakasugi N. Virelizier J.L. Yodoi J. Hay R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3821-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 50Sakurai A. Yuasa K. Shoji Y. Himeno S. Tsujimoto M. Kunimoto M. Imura N. Hara S. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 198: 22-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). TRX1 also interacts with Ref-1, promoting AP-1 DNA binding activity (51Wei S.J. Botero A. Hirota K. Bradbury C.M. Markovina S. Laszlo A. Spitz D.R. Goswami P.C. Yodoi J. Gius D. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6688-6695PubMed Google Scholar). Extracellular TRX1 can serve as a chemoattractant (52Bertini R. Howard O.M. Dong H.F. Oppenheim J.J. Bizzarri C. Sergi R. Caselli G. Pagliei S. Romines B. Wilshire J.A. Mengozzi M. Nakamura H. Yodoi J. Pekkari K. Gurunath R. Holmgren A. Herzenberg L.A. Herzenberg L.A. Ghezzi P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1783-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Our data predict that TRX1 can play a proinflammatory role in the vasculature by counteracting NO. Although NO inhibits vascular inflammation in part by S-nitrosylation of NSF and inhibition of exocytosis, TRX1 denitrosylates NSF and restores exocytosis, which would be predicted to increase vascular inflammation. Thus the role of TRX1 in inflammation may be more complex than previously thought (53Burke-Gaffney A. Callister M.E. Nakamura H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 398-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W2054344714,"Myeloid differentiation protein 88 (MyD88) is a key signaling adapter in Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. MyD88 is also one of the most polymorphic adapter proteins. We screened the reported nonsynonymous coding mutations in MyD88 to identify variants with altered function. In reporter assays, a death domain variant, S34Y, was found to be inactive. Importantly, in reconstituted macrophage-like cell lines derived from knock-out mice, MyD88 S34Y was severely compromised in its ability to respond to all MyD88-dependent TLR ligands. Unlike wild-type MyD88, S34Y is unable to form distinct foci in the cells but is present diffused in the cytoplasm. We observed that IRAK4 co-localizes with MyD88 in these aggregates, and thus these foci appear to be ""Myddosomes."" The MyD88 S34Y loss-of-function mutant demonstrates how proper cellular localization of MyD88 to the Myddosome is a feature required for MyD88 function."

https://openalex.org/W2051971539,"During reinforcement learning, dopamine release shifts from the moment of reward consumption to the time point when the reward can be predicted. Previous studies provide consistent evidence that reward-predicting cues enhance long-term memory (LTM) formation of these items via dopaminergic projections to the ventral striatum. However, it is less clear whether memory for items that do not precede a reward but are directly associated with reward consumption is also facilitated. Here, we investigated this question in an fMRI paradigm in which LTM for reward-predicting and neutral cues was compared to LTM for items presented during consumption of reliably predictable as compared to less predictable rewards. We observed activation of the ventral striatum and enhanced memory formation during reward anticipation. During processing of less predictable as compared to reliably predictable rewards, the ventral striatum was activated as well, but items associated with less predictable outcomes were remembered worse than items associated with reliably predictable outcomes. Processing of reliably predictable rewards activated the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and vmPFC BOLD responses were associated with successful memory formation of these items. Taken together, these findings show that consumption of reliably predictable rewards facilitates LTM formation and is associated with activation of the vmPFC."
https://openalex.org/W2149896016,"The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion is characterized by excessive water uptake and hyponatremia. The extent of hyponatremia, however, is less than anticipated, which is ascribed to a defense mechanism, the vasopressin-escape, and is suggested to involve a tonicity-determined down-regulation of the water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2). The underlying mechanism, however, is poorly understood. To study this, we used the mouse cortical collecting duct (mpkCCD) cell line. MpkCCD cells, transfected with an AQP2-promoter luciferase construct showed a reduced and increased AQP2 abundance and transcription following culture in hypotonic and hypertonic medium, respectively. This depended on tonicity rather than osmolality and occurred independently of the vasopressin analog dDAVP, cAMP levels, or protein kinase A activity. Although prostaglandins and nitric oxide reduced AQP2 abundance, inhibition of their synthesis did not influence tonicity-induced AQP2 transcription. Also, cells in which the cAMP or tonicity-responsive element (CRE/TonE) in the AQP2-promoter were mutated showed a similar response to hypotonicity. Instead, the tonicity-responsive elements were pin-pointed to nucleotides -283 to -252 and -157 to -126 bp. In conclusion, our data indicate that hypotonicity reduces AQP2 abundance and transcription, which occurs independently of vasopressin, cAMP, and the known TonE and CRE in the AQP2-promoter. Increased prostaglandin and nitric oxide, as found in vivo, may contribute to reduced AQP2 in vasopressin-escape, but do not mediate the effect of hypotonicity on AQP2 transcription. Our data suggest that two novel segments (-283 to -252 and -157 to -126 bp) in the AQP2-promoter mediate the hypotonicity-induced AQP2 down-regulation during vasopressin-escape."
https://openalex.org/W1981064655,"Mice irradiated and reconstituted with hematopoietic cells lacking manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) show a persistent hemolytic anemia similar to human sideroblastic anemia (SA), including characteristic intra-mitochondrial iron deposition. SA is primarily an acquired, clonal marrow disorder occurring in individuals over 60 years of age with uncertain etiology.To define early events in the pathogenesis of this murine model of SA, we compared erythroid differentiation of Sod2⁻/⁻ and normal bone marrow cells using flow cytometry and gene expression profiling of erythroblasts. The predominant transcriptional differences observed include widespread down-regulation of mitochondrial metabolic pathways and mitochondrial biogenesis. Multiple nuclear encoded subunits of complexes I-IV of the electron transport chain, ATP synthase (complex V), TCA cycle and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins were coordinately down-regulated in Sod2⁻/⁻ erythroblasts. Despite iron accumulation within mitochondria, we found increased expression of transferrin receptor, Tfrc, at both the transcript and protein level in SOD2 deficient cells, suggesting deregulation of iron delivery. Interestingly, there was decreased expression of ABCb7, the gene responsible for X-linked hereditary SA with ataxia, a component required for iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis.These results indicate that in erythroblasts, mitochondrial oxidative stress reduces expression of multiple nuclear genes encoding components of the respiratory chain, TCA cycle and mitochondrial protein synthesis. An additional target of particular relevance for SA is iron:sulfur cluster biosynthesis. By decreasing transcription of components of cluster synthesis machinery, both iron utilization and regulation of iron uptake are impacted, contributing to the sideroblastic phenotype."

The aim of this study is to examine the presence and the detailed localization of endogenous retinoic acid activity in neonatal, young and adult mouse kidneys, to establish a fundamental ground for further research into potential target genes, as well as physiological and pathophysiological roles of endogenous retinoic acid in the post-natal kidneys.RARE-hsp68-lacZ transgenic mice were employed as a reporter for endogenous retinoic acid activity that was determined by X-gal assay and immunostaining of the reporter gene product, β-galactosidase. Double immunostaining was performed for β-galactosidase and markers of kidney tubules to localize retinoic acid activity. Distinct pattern of retinoic acid activity was observed in kidneys, which is higher in neonatal and 1- to 3-week-old mice than that in 5- and 8-week-old mice. The activity was present specifically in the principal cells and the intercalated cells of the collecting duct system in all age groups, but was absent from the glomeruli, proximal tubules, thin limbs of Henle's loop and distal tubules.Endogenous retinoic acid activity exists in principal cells and intercalated cells of the mouse collecting duct system after birth and persists into adulthood. This observation provides novel insights into potential roles for endogenous retinoic acid beyond nephrogenesis and warrants further studies to investigate target genes and functions of endogenous retinoic acid in the kidney after birth, particularly in the collecting duct system."

It is still a matter of controversy whether SAPK/JNK are stimulated by receptor-related mechanisms only or whether DNA damage-related mechanisms are involved as well. It is well established that genotoxins, such as UV light or alkylating agents, rapidly activate mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways by stimulation of receptors for growth factors and cytokines (13Coffer P.J.

Membrane-bound small GTPases of the Ras and Rho family transduce this signal to SAPK/JNK (17Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M.

Apart from causing damage to membranes, genotoxins severely attack the genomic DNA, thereby triggering carcinogenesis and cell death. Hence, it is tempting to speculate that DNA damage also contributes to the activation of SAPK/JNK. Evidence that DNA damage-dependent functions might impact genotoxin-induced signaling to SAPK/JNK rests on the analysis of cell lines compromised in particular DNA repair functions, such as nucleotide excision repair (NER) or mismatch repair (19Nehmé A.

Cancer. 2004; 112: 974-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, data supporting the view that SAPK/JNK are regulated in a DNA damage-dependent manner are still limited. Hence, in contrast to p38 kinases, SAPK/JNK are not yet fully established as part of the eukaryotic DNA damage response (25Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 739-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). UV-C light, the monofunctional alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), and the anticancer drug cisplatin are powerful and therefore prototypical activators of SAPK/JNK (26Wilhelm D. Bender K. Knebel A. Angel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4792-4800Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 27van Dam H. Wilhelm D. Herr I. Steffen A. Herrlich P. Angel P.

These agents induce different types of DNA adducts. Although the SN2 alkylating agent MMS exclusively forms monoadducts, in particular N7-methylguanine, N3-methylguanine, and N3-methyladenine, UV-C light specifically forms DNA intrastrand cross-links, in particular cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and (6-4) photoproducts (29Friedberg E.C. Wallner G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C1995: 25-29Google Scholar). The anticancer drug cisplatin initially generates monoadducts that pass into DNA intra- or interstrand cross-links with a half-time of 6 and 14 h, respectively (30Zamble D.B. Lippard S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 435-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The majority (>95%) of cisplatin-induced DNA adducts are intrastrand cross-links (31Jamieson E.R. Lippard S.J. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 2467-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (2620) Google Scholar, 32Malinge J.M. Giraud-Panis M.J. Leng M. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1999; 77: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A major drawback of most of the currently available studies claiming that DNA damage contributes to the activation of SAPK/JNK following genotoxin exposure is the lack of qualitative and quantitative detection of DNA damage. Although the genomic DNA is a most important cellular target for the mutagenic, recombinogenic, and carcinogenic effects of genotoxic compounds, genotoxins can also provoke stress signaling and death by targeting multiple cellular structures other than DNA, such as membrane receptors (15Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 33Benhar M. Engelberg D. Levitzki A.

Therefore, not each cellular response to genotoxins can be classified as a DNA damage-induced response. Bearing this in mind, the aim of the present study was to ascertain whether DNA damage is involved in the late activation of SAPK/JNK following cisplatin treatment and to characterize the molecular mechanisms involved. Cisplatin was provided by the pharmaceutical department of the Medical Center of the University of Mainz (Mainz, Germany). Transplatin and transcription inhibitors α-amanitin and 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole as well as wortmannin, MEK1 inhibitor PD98059, and c-Src inhibitor PP2 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Fotemustine originated from Servier Laboratories (Neuilly sur Seine, France). Phosphospecific antibodies detecting activated forms of protein kinases, i.e. SAPK/JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185), SEK1/MKK4 (Thr-261), checkpoint kinase-1 (Chk-1) (Ser-345), and checkpoint kinase-2 (Chk-2) (Thr-68), were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), and phosphospecific H2AX antibody (Ser-139) was from Upstate (Lake Placid, NY). ERK2, Cockayne syndrome B protein (CSB), replication protein A (RPA), β-actin, C/EBP homologous protein, and mitogen-activated kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP-1) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Heidelberg, Germany). Antibody detecting the major DNA adduct formed by cisplatin (1,2-GG intrastrand cross-link) was generated and provided by J. Thomale (Essen, Germany) (39Liedert B. Pluim D. Schellens J. Thomale J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: e47Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Rac1 and Rho antibody, Bcr-Abl inhibitor type II, JNK inhibitor II (SP600125), ATM inhibitor Ku55933, and Akt inhibitor (catalog number 124005) were from Calbiochem. EGFR inhibitor Iressa was purchased from AstraZeneca (London, UK), dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate was from Invitrogen, and validated siRNA for down-regulation of CSB protein was from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). Cell lines used in this study were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking ATM (ATM−/−) were provided by P. Leder (Boston, MA), CSB−/− MEFs were provided by G. van der Horst (Rotterdam, The Netherlands), and p53−/− MEFs are described elsewhere (40Lackinger D. Kaina B. Mutat. Res. 2000; 457: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Human cells lacking functional CSB protein originated from T. Stevnsner (Aarhus, Denmark) (41Stevnsner T. Nyaga S. de Souza-Pinto N.C. van der Horst G.T. Gorgels T.G. Hogue B.A. Thorslund T. Bohr V.A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8675-8682Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Mouse DNA-PKcs-deficient fibroblasts derived from severe combined immunodeficiency mice were kindly provided by K. Bidermann (42Biedermann K.A. Sun J.R. Giaccia A.J. Tosto L.M. Brown J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 1394-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Primary human fibroblasts (HIFB-D) were purchased from Provitro (Berlin, Germany). Primary human fibroblasts defective in xeroderma pigmentosum protein C (XPC) were provided by L. H. Mullenders (Leiden, The Netherlands). The origin of the human XP12RO cell line deficient in xeroderma pigmentosum protein A (XPA) and complemented cell line (XP129) is described elsewhere (43Köberle B. Roginskaya V. Wood R.D. DNA Repair. 2006; 5: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). ATR-defective (ATR-Seckel) fibroblasts were generously provided by M. O'Driscoll (East Sussex, UK). FANCD2-defective human cells and corresponding primary fibroblasts were obtained from D. Schindler (Würzburg, Germany). Hamster ERCC1-defective 43-3B cells and corresponding CHO wild type cells were reported before (44Dunkern T.R. Wedemeyer I. Baumgärtner M. Fritz G. Kaina B. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). If not stated otherwise, cisplatin exposure was performed as a chronic treatment, meaning that the medium was not replaced after drug addition. For preparation of platinated plasmid DNA, we used a modified method from Hansson and Wood (45Hansson J. Wood R.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8073-8091Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). pEGFP-C1 plasmid (Clontech) (100 μg/ml in Tris-EDTA buffer) was incubated overnight at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 100 μm cisplatin. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.5 m NaCl. Plasmid DNA was precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol at −70 °C in the presence of 2.5 m CH3COONH4, washed in 70% ethanol, dried, and redissolved in Tris-EDTA buffer. The transfection of platinated and non-platinated control plasmid was performed using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 24 h after the beginning of transfection, the transfected cells were harvested for analysis of their SAPK/JNK phosphorylation status. DNA adduct formation by cisplatin was analyzed by two different methods, namely Southwestern analysis (slot blot) and measurement of DNA platination. For Southwestern analysis, genomic DNA was isolated from subconfluent cells by the use of the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen). DNA (2 μg) was directly transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Hybond Plus) (Amersham Biosciences) by vacuum slot blotting, denatured with 0.3 m NaOH, neutralized with 5× SSC, and fixed by heat treatment (incubation for 2 h at 80 °C). Monoclonal antibody specifically detecting platinum adducts (1,2-GG intrastrand cross-links) (39Liedert B. Pluim D. Schellens J. Thomale J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: e47Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) was used at a dilution of 1:200. Blocking, hybridization, and detection procedures were as described below. To quantify the level of DNA platination, DNA was isolated as described before and DNA concentration was measured photometrically (E260/E280 ratio). The amount of platinum atoms bound to DNA was quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectometry using an Element 2 high resolution ICP-MS instrument (Thermo Finnigan, Bremen, Germany). The platinum content per nucleotide was calculated using the relative molar masses of platinum and nucleotides as described (24Brozovic A. Fritz G. Christmann M. Zisowsky J. Jaehde U. Osmak M. Kaina B. Int. J. Cancer. 2004; 112: 974-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Dual phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK by upstream regulatory kinase SEK1/MKK4, which results in SAPK/JNK activation, was measured by Western blot analysis using phosphospecific SAPK/JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185) antibody. Activation status of checkpoint kinases was analyzed in the same way using phospho-Chk-1 (Ser-345)- and phospho-Chk-2 (Thr-68)-specific antibodies. Cell extracts were prepared by lysing an identical number of cells in SDS sample buffer as recommended by the manufacturer (Cell Signaling Technology). Proteins were separated by SDS gel electrophoresis (10% gels) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking the membrane (5% dry milk in TBS, 0.2% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature (RT)), the phosphorylation status of kinases was analyzed using the corresponding phosphospecific antibody (1:1000 in 5% BSA in TBS, 0.2% Tween; overnight incubation at 4 °C). After washing (TBS, 0.2% Tween 20), blots were incubated with secondary horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibody (1:5000; 2 h at RT). Phosphorylated proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence using ECLTM detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences/GE Healthcare). As an internal protein loading control, ERK2 or β-actin protein expression was determined by reprobing the membranes with the corresponding antibody. For comparative analysis of SAPK/JNK activation in repair-defective versus wild type cells, protein extracts were usually separated on the same gel or on different gels run in parallel. Also, incubation with primary and secondary antibodies as well as autoradiography was performed in parallel, enabling a direct comparison of the signal intensities of phosphorylated SAPK/JNK between repair-proficient and -deficient cells. siRNA was used to specifically knock down the expression of the CSB protein in primary human fibroblasts. Validated CSB-specific siRNA (Qiagen) (5 nm) was transfected into primary human fibroblasts cells using Hyperfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Successful down-regulation of CSB protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis. For detection of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), the neutral comet assay was used as described (46Ochs K. Kaina B. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5815-5824PubMed Google Scholar). 50 nuclei were evaluated per treatment, and means ± S.D. were determined. Alternatively, phosphorylation of histone H2AX (γH2AX) by protein kinases ATM, ATR, or DNA-PKcs, which play a key role in the eukaryotic DNA damage response (47Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar, 48Matsuoka S. Ballif B.A. Smogorzewska A. McDonald 3rd, E.R. Hurov K.E. Luo J. Bakalarski C.E. Zhao Z.

H2AX phosphorylation was analyzed by Western blot analysis and additionally by the detection of γH2AX foci by immunohistochemistry (see below). Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, washed with PBS, and incubated in methanol at −20 °C for ≥2 h. Permeabilization and blocking of the cells were achieved by incubation with 5% BSA in PBS, 0.3% Triton X-100 for 2 h at RT. Afterward, cells were incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-γH2AX antibody or anti-RPA antibody (1:1000) overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with Alexa Fluor anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:500) (Invitrogen). Counterstaining of nuclei was performed with DAPI for another 15 min. Formation of γH2AX and RPA foci was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. ROS formation and an increase in the expression of C/EBP homologous protein are prototypical markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress (35Rao R.V. Ellerby H.M. Bredesen D.E. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). The level of ROS was analyzed by FACS using the fluorescent dye dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (Invitrogen). Expression of C/EBP homologous protein was analyzed by Western blot. As the active, i.e. GTP-bound, form of the Ras-homologous GTPase Rac1 is located on the plasma membrane, we investigated its expression level on membrane fractions by Western blot. To this end, cells were disrupted by sonication on ice in buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm PMSF, protease inhibitor mixture). Cell debris were removed by centrifugation (10 min at 400 × g at 4 °C). After protein determination by Bradford assay, an identical amount of total cell protein was subjected to a further centrifugation step (15 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C). The membrane fraction (i.e. the pellet) obtained was solubilized in SDS buffer, and proteins were processed for Western blot analysis as described above. Additionally, the amount of GTP-bound Rac1 protein was determined by GST-PAK pulldown assay as described (51Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Cisplatin (cDDP) is well known to cause a sustained activation of SAPK/JNK (23Mansouri A. Ridgway L.D.

Cancer. 1999; 79: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). As a first step to substantiate the role of DNA damage in triggering this response, we investigated whether the level of SAPK/JNK phosphorylation coincides with cisplatin-induced DNA adduct formation. To this end, human fibroblasts (GM637 cells) were exposed to increasing doses of cisplatin (continuous treatment), and the amount of 1,2-GG intrastrand cross-links and the dual phosphorylation status of SAPK/JNK were determined at early and late times after drug addition. As shown in Fig. 1A, steady-state cDDP adduct levels were clearly detectable both 4 and 24 h after treatment with 20 μm cDDP and increased with dose. The level of cDDP adducts observed 24 h after drug addition was slightly higher than after 4 h (Fig. 1A). At early times after treatment with 20 μm cDDP, the observed increase in cDDP adduct levels (Fig. 1A, left panel) was not paralleled by an increased SAPK/JNK phosphorylation, and the γH2AX level also was not enhanced (Fig. 1B, left panel). Apparently, cDDP-induced DNA adducts do not cause rapid activation of SAPK/JNK. At later times after exposure, the cDDP-induced increase in SAPK/JNK phosphorylation (Fig. 1B, right panel) was accompanied by higher cDDP adduct and γH2AX levels (Fig. 1, A and B, right panel). This finding supports the view that cDDP-induced DNA damage triggers SAPK/JNK activation at late times. The level of ROS, as measured by FACS analysis, was not enhanced in GM637 cells at late times following cisplatin exposure (Fig. 1C). To substantiate the data in a second experimental model system, MEFs derived from BALB/c mice were treated with increasing doses of cisplatin, and dual phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK and DNA platination were measured 24 h later. Here overall DNA platination was assayed by mass spectometry (i.e. ICP-MS). In line with the data obtained with GM637 cells, we found that the DNA platination level quantitatively correlated with SAPK/JNK phosphorylation (Fig. 1D). In MEFs, cDDP treatment caused ROS production (Fig. 1E). However, unlike the cDDP-stimulated SAPK/JNK phosphorylation, the ROS formation observed after cDDP exposure was not dose-dependent (Fig. 1E). Overall, the data indicate that cDDP-induced DNA adducts, rather than cDDP-induced ROS, can trigger late signaling to SAPK/JNK. This view gains support by the finding that transfection of platinated plasmid DNA also gives rise to SAPK/JNK phosphorylation (Fig. 1F). As expected, H2AX phosphorylation (γH2AX) was not simulated under these experimental conditions (Fig. 1F). Mutants defective in NER are unable to repair cisplatin-induced adducts in DNA (29Friedberg E.C. Wallner G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C1995: 25-29Google Scholar, 53de Boer J. Hoeijmakers J.H. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Assuming that cisplatin-induced DNA damage is responsible for late SAPK/JNK activation, NER mutants are expected to differ from wild type cells with respect to the phosphorylation status of SAPK/JNK. As transcription blockage is of importance for cellular stress responses (54Lainé J.P. Egly J.M.

Comparing to the wild-type (WT) mice, the Pin1−/− mice showed more serious damages in lung and the lower survival rate after the LPS injection. We compared the levels of typical inflammatory cytokines. Pin1−/− mice overreacted to the LPS injection to produce inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-6 more than WT mice. We showed that Pin1 binds phosphorylated PU.1 and they localize together in a nucleus. These results suggest that Pin1 controls the transcriptional activity of PU.1 and suppresses overreaction of macrophage that causes serious damages in lung. Conclusions/Significance Pin1 may protect the mice from serious inflammation by LPS injection by attenuating the increase of IL-6 transcription of the mouse macrophages."

Recent studies showed that Wnt inhibition is a trigger of cellular senescence. Using methods of reverse genetics, we recently identified VentX, a human homolog of the vertebrate Xenopus Vent family of homeobox genes, as a novel Wnt repressor and a putative tumor suppressor in lymphocytic leukemia. Here, we show that VentX is a direct transcriptional activator of p53-p21 and p16ink4a-Rb tumor suppression pathways. Ectopic expression of VentX in cancer cells caused an irreversible cell cycle arrest with a typical senescence-like phenotype. Conversely, inhibition of VentX expression by RNA interference ameliorated chemotherapeutic agent-induced senescence in lymphocytic leukemia cells. The results of our study further reveal the mechanisms underlying tumor suppression function of VentX and suggest a role of VentX as a potential target in cancer prevention and treatment.

Cell Res. 2007; 17: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Consistent with its role as a negative regulator of Wnt signaling, a recent cancer genome study showed that the VentX gene locus is frequently deleted in cancers, such as colorectal cancer and melanoma, in which aberrant Wnt signaling is implicated (11Bignell G.R.

Moreover, gene expression profiles from published databases suggest that VentX expression is down-regulated in lymphocytic leukemia (12Basso K. Margolin A.A. Stolovitzky G. Klein U. Dalla-Favera R.

In parallel with its prominent role in development, recent studies suggest a critical role for Wnt signaling in cellular senescence, an irreversible process of cell proliferation arrest (14Ye X.

Initially described as a cellular mechanism underlying physiological aging of fibroblasts, cellular senescence is being recognized as playing critical roles in tumor suppression (15Hayflick L.

Cell. 2003; 113: 703-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar). It has been shown that down-regulation of Wnt signaling triggers the formation of the SA heterochromatic foci and onset of cellular senescence (14Ye X. Zerlanko B. Kennedy A. Banumathy G. Zhang R. Adams P.D. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 183-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The p53-p21 and Rb-p16ink4a are two critical tumor suppression pathways implicated in cellular senescence (16Campisi J. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (3012) Google Scholar, 17Collado M. Blasco M.A. Serrano M. Cell. 2007; 130: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). p53 is a well established tumor suppressor gene and exerts its function in part by transcriptional activation of p21, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) (24Abbas T. Dutta A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 400-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1931) Google Scholar). Rb exerts its function by binding to the E2F family of transcriptional factors and inhibiting the downstream transcriptional cascades required for cell cycle entry (25Polager S. Ginsberg D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 738-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effects of Rb on E2F are abolished through phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin/CDK complexes which, in turn, are inhibited by p16ink4a and p15ink4b (26Sherr C.J. McCormick F. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 103-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). Clinical genetics studies have showed that silencing of the p53-p21 pathway occurs in ∼50% of cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia. Likewise, deletion or epigenetic silencing of p16ink4a and p15ink4b occurs frequently in acute lymphocytic leukemia (27Pui C.H. Relling M.V. Downing J.R. N. Engl. J.

Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To explore the mechanisms underlying VentX tumor suppression function, we screened for VentX effects on the expression of a panel of key regulators of cell proliferation. Here, we report that VentX is a direct transcriptional activator of the p53-p21 and Rb-p16ink4a tumor suppressor pathways. We found that VentX expression induces a senescence phenotype in several tumor cell lines and that down-regulation of VentX expression by RNA interference is associated with reduced senescence and increased resistance of leukemia cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Our data suggest a potential role for VentX as a novel therapeutic target in cancer treatment. Human embryonic kidney cell line 293 (HEK293), human cervical cancer cell line HeLa, human osteosarcoma U2OS cell line, and human primary fibroblasts IMR90 were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics. Human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line Nalm16 was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium. Primary CD19+ B lymphocytes were purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by positive selection using a magnetic cell separator (MACS; Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). The lymphocytes were seeded at a density of 106/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were lysed in solution A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 420 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.34 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitor mixture). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE were transferred onto PVDF membrane, which were detected with optimal dilutions of primary antibodies, followed by horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies. The blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Primary antibodies used were from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA) except anti-VentX sera, which were generated in our laboratory. The luciferase reporters of p53 (−2.4 kb) and p16ink4a (−869 bp) promoters have been described previously (30Hara E. Smith R. Parry D. Tahara H. Stone S. Peters G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 859-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 31Raman V. Martensen S.A. Reisman D. Evron E. Odenwald W.F. Jaffee E. Marks J. Sukumar S. Nature. 2000; 405: 974-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The p21 luciferase reporter was a gift from Dr. W Gu as described (32Luo J. Su F. Chen D. Shiloh A. Gu W. Nature. 2000; 408: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Cells seeded in 24-well plates were transfected with 500 ng of reporter plasmid and increasing amounts of pcDNA-VentX plasmid. Total plasmid transfected was brought to the same amount by the addition of empty pcDNA vector. 10 ng of Renilla luciferase plasmid was included for each transfection to normalize reporter activity. Cells were harvested at 48 h after transfection and analyzed with Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI). Cells were cultured in 6-cm dishes overnight and then transfected with pCS2 plasmids encoding myc-VentX or myc-tag. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the ChIP assay was performed with a kit from Upstate Biotechnology following manufacturer's instructions. The p53 promoter sequence was amplified with specific primers: 5′-CCTGACTCTGCACCCTCCTC-3′ and 5′-CGAGGCTCCTGGCACAAAGC-3′; and the p16ink4a promoter sequence was amplified with specific primers 5′-TAGCTTAGGATGTGTGGCAC-3′ and 5′-TCCTTCACACTTCTCACATT-3′. The following primers were used to amplify the constant region of immunoglobulin M heavy chain gene (Cμ): 5′-AACCCTTTTCCCCCTCGTCT-3′ and 5′-AGCACCTGTGAGGTGGCTGC-3′. The promoter region of GAPDH was amplified with the following primers: 5′-TACTAGCGGTTTTACGGGCG-3′ and 5′-TCGAACAGGAGGAGCAGAGAGCGA-3′. The primers 5′-GAGACCGGCGGATCAAATGTC-3′ and 5′-CACCATGCCCAGCTAATTTTTG-3′ were used to amplify a 100-bp sequence at 3.7 kb upstream of the potential binding site of VentX on p53 promoter, which serves as another negative control. PCR products were separated on 8% polyacrylamide gel. The U2OS cell line expressing Tet-inducible VentX was generated through transfection of a TetR-expressing U2OS cell line (a gift from Dr. Yao, Department of Surgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston) with pcDNATM4/TO-VentX plasmid. Positively transfected cells were selected with 2 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). Single colonies were selected out by limiting dilution. IMR90 cell lines expressing GFP-VentX (or GFP as control) were generated through co-transduction of pRetroX-GFP-VentX (or pRetroX-GFP) and pRetroX-Tet-On advanced retroviruses (Retro-XTM Tet-On Advanced Expression System, Clontech). GFP-positive cells were sorted by FACS after a brief incubation with Tet (24 h) and maintained in the absence of Tet. Small hairpin RNA (shRNA) retroviral vectors targeting VentX (pRS vectors) with a puromycin selection marker were purchased from Origene (Rockville, MD) and described in our previous publication (9Gao H. Le Y. Wu X. Silberstein L.E. Giese R.W. Zhu Z. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Stable knockdown of VentX expression in Nalm16 cells was described as previously (9Gao H. Le Y. Wu X. Silberstein L.E. Giese R.W. Zhu Z. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Transient knockdown of VentX in primary CD19+ B lymphocytes was achieved through electroporation of duplex RNA oligonucleotides (siRNA) with a kit from Lonza (Allendale, NJ) following the manufacturer's instructions. Retroviral shRNA against human p16ink4a was a gift from Dr. Lowe (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). pMKO.1-shp53 and pBabe-SV40 large T (SV40LT) antigen retroviral vectors were obtained from Addgene. Total RNA was isolated by the TRIzol method, and the same amount of RNA was used for first-strand cDNA synthesis with the SuperScript First-strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The primers 5′-AAGGCAATTAGGCGCTGCTT-3′ and 5′-ACAGAACAACTGAGTCCTCCA-3′ were used for conventional PCR of VentX. For quantitative PCR, the following primers were used: VentX, 5′-CCGTCAGCATCAAGGAGG-3′ and 5′-CTGGACCTCTGAGAGCTGC-3′; p53, 5′-TCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAA-3′ and 5′-CTCCTCCCCACAACAAAAC-3′; p21, 5′-AAACTTTGGAGTCCCCTCAC-3′ and 5′-AAAGGCTCAACACTGAGACG-3′; p16ink4a, 5′-CTTCCCCCACTACCGTAAAT-3′ and 5′-TGCTCACTCCAGAAAACTCC-3′. We performed quantitative PCR with SYBR Green on a LightCycler® 480 system (480 Real-Time PCR System; Roche Applied Science). Senescence of U2OS, Nalm16, and IMR90 cells was evaluated by a SA β-galactosidase staining kit from Cell Signaling. Cell counts were made on five random fields of at least 200 cells. Nalm16 cells were subjected for the following treatments: 800 nm all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) for 10 days, 100 ng/ml doxorubicin (Doxo) for 4 days, 5 μm 5-fluorouracil for 3 days, or 1 μm camptothecin for 2 days. Stable knockdown of VentX in Nalm16 cells and the tetrazolium compound (MTS) assay of cells viability were performed as described previously (9Gao H. Le Y. Wu X. Silberstein L.E. Giese R.W. Zhu Z. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Nalm16 cells were treated with 800 nm ATRA for 5 days, 100 ng/ml Doxo for 2 days, or mock treated. Cells were then harvested for intracellular staining of phycoerythrin-conjugated Ki67 antibody with protocol provided by the manufacturer (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) and analyzed with a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Bioscience) using FlowJo software. Our recent study showed that VentX is a negative regulator of cell proliferation. Mechanistically, we found that VentX exerts its function on cell proliferation at least in part through inhibition of Wnt signaling and its downstream targets, such as cyclin D1 (9Gao H. Le Y. Wu X. Silberstein L.E. Giese R.W. Zhu Z. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Given the broad implications of Wnt signaling in cell proliferation, we sought to determine further the molecular pathways underlying VentX-induced cell growth arrest through a targeted screen of cell cycle regulators, using a transient transfection assay. HEK293 cells were transfected with expression constructs encoding VentX or vector control. At 48 h after transfection, total cell lysates were harvested, and the expression levels of a panel of cell cycle regulatory proteins were determined by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1, we found that VentX expression led to a significant increase in the protein levels of p53 and two CDK inhibitors: p21 and p16ink4a (Fig. 1). Consistent with our previous finding, the cyclin D1 protein level was down-regulated upon the expression of VentX (9Gao H. Le Y. Wu X. Silberstein L.E. Giese R.W. Zhu Z. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). No obvious expression change was detected for other tested proteins (Fig. 1). p53 and p21 are key regulators of cell proliferation and are broadly implicated in tumorigenesis. To corroborate our screening findings, we used U2OS cells to explore further the effects of VentX on the expression of p53 and p21. Plasmid encoding VentX or vector control was transiently transfected into U2OS cells. At 48 h after transfection, total proteins were extracted, and the expression levels of p53 and p21 were determined by Western blot analysis. Again, we observed an increase in the protein levels of p53 and p21 in U2OS cells upon VentX expression (Fig. 2A, left panel). The effect of VentX on the protein level of p53 was also observed in HeLa cells (data not shown). Collectively, these data suggest that the p53-p21 pathway is a downstream target of VentX. Either increased transcription or reduced proteolysis may account for the effects of VentX on p53 protein level. To elaborate the mechanism of VentX action, we tested whether VentX affects the stability of p53. U2OS cells were treated with cycloheximide after transfection of VentX or control plasmid. As shown in Fig. 2A (right panel), we did not observe significant alteration on the kinetics of p53 protein degradation upon transfection of VentX, suggesting that VentX does not exert significant effects on p53 stability. Next, we explored the effects of VentX on transcriptional activation of p53-p21 pathway. As shown in Fig. 2B (left panel), in comparison with the vector control, VentX expression led to increased mRNA levels of p53 and p21 in U2OS cells. In addition to its effects on p53 in U2OS cells, VentX also up-regulated p53 mRNA level in Sw480 cells, which harbor a mutant p53 protein (Fig. 2B, right panel) (33Rochette P.J. Bastien N. Lavoie J. Guérin S.L. Drouin R. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These data further suggest that p53 is a transcriptional target of VentX. Consistently, we showed that ectopic expression of VentX trans-activated the human p53 and p21 promoter-luciferase reporters in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3). Human p53 promoter region contains several putative homeodomain core binding sequences (ATTA) (Fig. 2G and Ref. 31Raman V. Martensen S.A. Reisman D. Evron E. Odenwald W.F. Jaffee E. Marks J. Sukumar S. Nature. 2000; 405: 974-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). A ChIP assay therefore was performed to examine a potential direct interaction between VentX and the p53 promoter (Fig. 2G). As shown in Fig. 2F, the ChIP assay revealed a specific binding of VentX to the p53 promoter. As negative controls, VentX was found not to bind to the region 3.7 kb upstream of the VentX binding site on p53 promoter. Further, VentX did not bind to the constant region of immunoglobulin M heavy chain gene (Cμ) (9Gao H. Le Y. Wu X. Silberstein L.E. Giese R.W. Zhu Z. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) or the GAPDH promoter.FIGURE 3Knockdown of VentX in primary B cells is associated with decreased p53-p21 and p16ink4a expression. Human primary B cells isolated from three different donors were electroporated with VentX siRNA or control siRNA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were then cultured in the presence of CD40 ligand and IL4 for 3 days. A, mRNA level of VentX was determined by reverse transcription and quantitative PCR. B, mRNA level of p53, p21, and p16ink4a was determined by quantitative PCR. C, whole cell lysates were prepared from B cells and used to probe protein levels of p53, p21, and p16ink4a with corresponding antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The p16ink4a-Rb pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of cancers, including lymphocytic leukemia (29Omura-Minamisawa M. Diccianni M.B. Batova A. Chang R.C. Bridgeman L.J. Yu J. Pullen J. Bowman W.P. Yu A.L. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 1219-1228PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that p16ink4a inhibits phosphorylation of Rb by CDKs (26Sherr C.J. McCormick F. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 103-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). Our recent study indicated that VentX is a putative tumor suppressor in lymphocytic leukemia (9Gao H. Le Y. Wu X. Silberstein L.E. Giese R.W. Zhu Z. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The finding that VentX up-regulates the expression of p16ink4a (Fig. 1) prompted us to test the hypothesis that VentX also exerts its function by transactivation of the p16ink4a-Rb tumor suppressor pathway. HeLa cells, in which the p16ink4a-Rb pathway is functional (34Goodwin E.C. DiMaio D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 12513-12518Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), were employed to test this hypothesis. As shown in Fig. 2 D (left panel), with increased expression of VentX, there was a corresponding increase of p16ink4a protein expression. In comparison to the elevated expression of p16ink4a, no substantial change of Rb protein level was observed. However, when the level of phosphorylated Rb was examined with specific antibody, we found that VentX expression is associated with significant reduction of the hyperphosphorylated form of Rb (Fig. 2D, left panel). Our findings support the hypothesis that VentX promotes the expression of p16ink4a, which, in turn, inhibits the phosphorylation of Rb by CDKs (35Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5771-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The potential transcriptional activation of p16ink4a by VentX was suggested by the increased p16ink4a mRNA levels upon ectopic expression of VentX (Fig. 2 D, right panel). Using p16ink4a promoter-luciferase reporter assay, we further demonstrated that VentX promoted p16ink4a transactivation in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 2 E). Human p16 promoter also contains putative homeodomain binding sites (Fig. 2 G). Consistently, the ChIP assay demonstrated a specific binding of VentX to the p16ink4a promoter (Fig. 2 F). VentX is expressed predominately in hematopoietic cells. Expression analysis of VentX in peripheral blood leukocytes shows that VentX is expressed in both myeloid and lymphoid lineages (9Gao H. Le Y. Wu X. Silberstein L.E. Giese R.W. Zhu Z. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To determine whether VentX regulates p53, p21 and p16ink4a expression under physiological condition in primary hematopoietic cells, we examined the effects of VentX knockdown in primary B cells. As shown in Fig. 3 A, VentX expression in isolated primary B cells was efficiently down-regulated by electroporation of VentX siRNA. Correspondingly, with the down-regulation of VentX, there was significant decreases of p53, p21 and p16ink4a expression at both mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 3 B and C). These data suggest that VentX plays a critical physiological role in regulating the expression of p53, p21 and p16ink4a in primary lymphocytes. Originally described during normal aging of fibroblasts, senescence pathways have been shown to play critical roles in preventing tumorigenesis (17Collado M. Blasco M.A. Serrano M.

Previous investigations showed that the p53-p21 and p16ink4a-Rb tumor suppressor pathways are critical mediators of cellular senescence following various stimuli (16Campisi J. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (3012) Google Scholar, 17Collado M. Blasco M.A. Serrano M. Cell. 2007; 130: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). Therefore, the findings that VentX activates both pathways in transient transfection studies prompted us to investigate whether VentX is able to exert a tumor suppression function by inducing cellular senescence in tumor cells. To address this question, we generated a stable U2OS cell line, U2OS/VentXTet, in which the expression of VentX is under control of a tetracycline (Tet)-inducible promoter. As shown in Fig. 4A, U2OS/VentXTet cells express VentX in a Tet-dependent manner. Upon addition of Tet, there was a strong induction of p53 and p21 expression in U2OS/VentXTet cells (Fig. 4A). Consistent with its role as an inhibitor of cell proliferation, induction of VentX expression is associated with significant inhibition of U2OS/VentXTet cell growth (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, VentX expression caused a striking morphological change with U2OS/VentXTet cells appeared to be enlarged and flattened. These cells displayed positive staining for SA β-galactosidase, a characteristic marker of cellular senescence (Fig. 4C). Because irreversible growth arrest is a key feature of cellular senescence, we examined whether the growth inhibitory effect of VentX was irreversible. As shown in Fig. 4D, when Tet was removed from the culture medium after 3 days of exposure, the expression of VentX and p53 gradually decreased (Fig. 4D, left panel). However, the U2OS/VentXTet cells remained positive for SA β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 4D, middle panel). Moreover, the growth arrest of the U2OS/VentXTet cells continued (Fig. 4D, right panel). In addition to U2OS cells, stable VentX expression also provoked a senescent phenotype in HeLa cells. 2X. Wu, H. Gao, W. Ke, M. Hager, S. Xiao, M. R. Freeman, and Z. Zhu, unpublished data. We next explored the potential dependence of VentX-induced cellular senescence on the p53 and p16ink4a pathways. For this purpose, we employed the IMR90 primary human fibroblasts, which possess intact p53-p21 and p16ink4a-Rb pathways and have been widely used as a model to study cellular senescence (37Lin A.W. Barradas M. Stone J.C. van Aelst L. Serrano M. Lowe S.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3008-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar, 38Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4E, inducible expression of VentX caused a typical senescence phenotype in early passage IMR90 cells as indicated by enlarged and flattened cell morphology, positive staining for SA β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 4E, left panel, Control). First, p53 and p16ink4a shRNAs were used to down-regulate the expression p53 and p16ink4a, and the efficacy of the p53 and p16ink4a shRNA was confirmed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). We found that, although suppression of p53 or p16ink4a individually exerted few effects on VentX-induced senescence, the combined suppression of both p53 and p16 significantly ameliorated the senescence phenotype induced by VentX (Fig. 4E). Previous studies have showed that SV40 large T antigen (SV40LT) inhibits the function of both p53 and p16ink4a pathways through direct binding to p53 and Rb (39Ahuja D. Sáenz-Robles M.T. Pipas J.M. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7729-7745Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Consistently, we found that ectopic expression of SV40LT substantially ameliorated the cellular senescence induced by VentX (Fig. 4E). Collectively, our data suggest that VentX induces cellular senescence, at least in part, through p53/p16ink4a-mediated mechanisms. Chemotherapy remains a main therapeutic modality for leukemia patients. Chemotherapeutic drugs such as Doxo and ATRA have been show to induce premature senescence in tumor cells (19Roninson I.B. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2705-2715PubMed Google Scholar, 40Roninson I.B. Dokmanovic M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 88: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 41Chen Y. Dokmanovic M. Stein W.D. Ardecky R.J. Roninson I.B. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 8749-8761Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Our previous study showed that lymphoblastic leukemia cells Nalm16 express low levels of VentX (9Gao H. Le Y. Wu X. Silberstein L.E. Giese R.W. Zhu Z. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Using the Nalm16 model, we found that VentX expression can be induced in Nalm16 cells by various chemotherapeutic agents (Fig. 5A). To determine whether VentX plays a role in mediating senescence of Nalm16 cells induced by chemotherapeutic agents, we down-regulated VentX expression in Nalm16 cells with specific shRNA (Fig. 5B, left panel). We found that Nalm16 cells transfected with shVentX became more resistant to chemotherapeutic agent-induced growth inhibition (Fig. 5C) and showed enhanced cellular viability (Fig. 5D). Supporting a role of VentX in mediating chemotherapeutic agent-induced cellular senescence, Nalm16 cells transfected with shVentX displayed significantly lower SA β-galactosidase staining upon exposure to chemotherapeutic agents compared with the control cells (Fig. 5, E and F). The shVentX-transfected Nalm16 cells also showed a stronger Ki67 staining, a cell proliferation marker (42Scholzen T. Gerdes J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3510) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5G). In addition, down-regulation of VentX diminished the DNA-damaging agent camptothecin-induced up-regulation of p53 (Fig. 5B, right panel), suggesting that VentX may also be involved in the DNA damage response. VentX is a human homeobox gene that shares strong homology to the Xenopus Vent gene family (9Gao H. Le Y. Wu X. Silberstein L.E. Giese R.W. Zhu Z. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 43Moretti P.A. Davidson A.J. Baker E. Lilley B. Zon L.I. D'Andrea R.J. Genomics. 2001; 76: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Besides its ventralizing activity in the zebrafish model, little is known about the function of VentX (43Moretti P.A. Davidson A.J. Baker E. Lilley B. Zon L.I. D'Andrea R.J. Genomics. 2001; 76: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Our recent investigation found that VentX is a negative regulator of cellular proliferation and a LEF/TCF-associated Wnt repressor (9Gao H. Le Y. Wu X. Silberstein L.E. Giese R.W. Zhu Z. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to dissect further the mechanisms of the VentX tumor suppression function. We screened a variety of proteins involved in cell cycle regulation and identified novel downstream targets of VentX in the cell cycle regulatory machinery. We demonstrated that VentX was able to activate two cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors: p21 and p16ink4a. When ectopically expressed, VentX up-regulated p53-p21 and p16ink4a protein level in multiple cell lines. In contrast, knockdown of VentX in primary B cells led to reduced expression of p53-p21 and p16ink4a (Fig. 3). Combined with other biochemical analyses (luciferase reporter and ChIP, as shown in Fig. 2), we conclude that VentX is a direct transcriptional activator of p53-p21 and p16ink4a. Our recent finding that VentX is an inhibitor of oncogenic Wnt/β-catenin signaling and is down-regulated in blood samples of chronic lymphoblastic leukemia patients led us to propose that VentX is a putative tumor suppressor (9Gao H. Le Y. Wu X. Silberstein L.E. Giese R.W. Zhu Z. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Here, we found that VentX is a potent activator of p53-p21 and p16ink4a-Rb tumor suppressor pathways and is down-regulated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples.3 The current study further showed that VentX expression can be induced upon chemotherapeutic treatments. Consistent with a role as a tumor suppressor, we demonstrated that knockdown of VentX expression in lymphoblastic leukemic Nalm16 cells led to enhanced resistance of these cells to cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents. Thus, data from this and our previous studies strongly support that VentX is a novel tumor suppressor and a cancer therapeutic target. Recently, Rawat et al. reported that knockdown of VentX in human acute myeloid leukemia cell lines inhibited their proliferative potential. It was suggested that functions of VentX may depend on cellular context (44Rawat V.P. Arseni N. Ahmed F. Mulaw M.A. Thoene S. Heilmeier B. Sadlon T. D'Andrea R.J. Hiddemann W. Bohlander S.K. Buske C. Feuring-Buske M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 16946-16951Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). VentX expression induced pronounced senescence phenotypes in several tumor cell lines and primary fibroblasts, and down-regulation of VentX was associated with a reduction in chemotherapeutic drug-induced senescence in lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Our study indicated that p53-p21 and p16ink4a-Rb, previously defined as key players of cellular senescence (16Campisi J. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (3012) Google Scholar, 17Collado M. Blasco M.A. Serrano M. Cell. 2007; 130: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar), may be important mediators of VentX-induced senescence (Fig. 4E). Our findings are consistent with the previous findings that Wnt inhibition activates cellular senescence pathway (14Ye X. Zerlanko B. Kennedy A. Banumathy G. Zhang R. Adams P.D. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 183-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Therefore, VentX appears to provide a link between Wnt inhibition and activation of p53 and p16ink senescence pathways. It should be noted, however, in contrast to oncogene-induced senescence, which is usually accompanied by mitogenic effects and activation of the DNA damage response (37Lin A.W. Barradas M.

https://openalex.org/W2016245944,"Introduction Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) are increasingly isolated, with USA300-0114 being the predominant clone in the USA. Comparative whole genome sequencing of USA300 isolates collected in 2002, 2003 and 2005 showed a limited number of single nucleotide polymorphisms and regions of difference. This suggests that USA300 has undergone rapid clonal expansion without great genomic diversification. However, whole genome comparison of CA-MRSA has been limited to isolates belonging to USA300. The aim of this study was to compare the genetic repertoire of different CA-MRSA clones with that of HA-MRSA from the USA and Europe through comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to identify genetic clues that may explain the successful and rapid emergence of CA-MRSA. Materials and Methods Hierarchical clustering based on CGH of 48 MRSA isolates from the community and nosocomial infections from Europe and the USA revealed dispersed clustering of the 19 CA-MRSA isolates. This means that these 19 CA-MRSA isolates do not share a unique genetic make-up. Only the PVL genes were commonly present in all CA-MRSA isolates. However, 10 genes were variably present among 14 USA300 isolates. Most of these genes were present on mobile elements. Conclusion The genetic variation present among the 14 USA300 isolates is remarkable considering the fact that the isolates were recovered within one month and originated from a confined geographic area, suggesting continuous evolution of this clone."
https://openalex.org/W2049869189,"The marine bacterium Vibrio tapetis is the causative agent of the brown ring disease, which affects the clam Ruditapes philippinarum and causes heavy economic losses in North of Europe and in Eastern Asia. Further characterization of V. tapetis isolates showed that all the investigated strains harbored at least one large plasmid. We determined the sequence of the 82,266 bp plasmid pVT1 from the CECT4600T reference strain and analyzed its genetic content. pVT1 is a mosaic plasmid closely related to several conjugative plasmids isolated from Vibrio vulnificus strains and was shown to be itself conjugative in Vibrios. In addition, it contains DNA regions that have similarity with several other plasmids from marine bacteria (Vibrio sp., Shewanella sp., Listonella anguillarum and Photobacterium profundum). pVT1 contains a number of mobile elements, including twelve Insertion Sequences or inactivated IS genes and an RS1 phage element related to the CTXphi phage of V. cholerae. The genetic organization of pVT1 underscores an important role of horizontal gene transfer through conjugative plasmid shuffling and transposition events in the acquisition of new genetic resources and in generating the pVT1 modular organization. In addition, pVT1 presents a copy number of 9, relatively high for a conjugative plasmid, and appears to belong to a new type of replicon, which may be specific to Vibrionaceae and Shewanelleacae."
https://openalex.org/W2043327413,"Background Comparative studies of cognitive processes find similarities between humans and apes but also monkeys. Even high-level processes, like the ability to categorize classes of object from any natural scene under ultra-rapid time constraints, seem to be present in rhesus macaque monkeys (despite a smaller brain and the lack of language and a cultural background). An interesting and still open question concerns the degree to which the same images are treated with the same efficacy by humans and monkeys when a low level cue, the spatial frequency content, is controlled. Methodology/Principal Findings We used a set of natural images equalized in Fourier spectrum and asked whether it is still possible to categorize them as containing an animal and at what speed. One rhesus macaque monkey performed a forced-choice saccadic task with a good accuracy (67.5% and 76% for new and familiar images respectively) although performance was lower than with non-equalized images. Importantly, the minimum reaction time was still very fast (100 ms). We compared the performances of human subjects with the same setup and the same set of (new) images. Overall mean performance of humans was also lower than with original images (64% correct) but the minimum reaction time was still short (140 ms). Conclusion Performances on individual images (% correct but not reaction times) for both humans and the monkey were significantly correlated suggesting that both species use similar features to perform the task. A similar advantage for full-face images was seen for both species. The results also suggest that local low spatial frequency information could be important, a finding that fits the theory that fast categorization relies on a rapid feedforward magnocellular signal."
https://openalex.org/W2077115192,"Membrane elastic properties, which are subject to alteration by compounds such as cholesterol, lipid metabolites and other amphiphiles, as well as pharmaceuticals, can have important effects on membrane proteins. A useful tool for measuring some of these effects is the gramicidin A channels, which are formed by transmembrane dimerization of non-conducting subunits that reside in each bilayer leaflet. The length of the conducting channels is less than the bilayer thickness, meaning that channel formation is associated with a local bilayer deformation. Electrophysiological studies have shown that the dimer becomes increasingly destabilized as the hydrophobic mismatch between the channel and the host bilayer increases. That is, the bilayer imposes a disjoining force on the channel, which grows larger with increasing hydrophobic mismatch. The energetic analysis of the channel-bilayer coupling is usually pursued assuming that each subunit, as well as the subunit-subunit interface, is rigid. Here we relax the latter assumption and explore how the bilayer junction responds to changes in this disjoining force using a simple one-dimensional energetic model, which reproduces key features of the bilayer regulation of gramicidin channel lifetimes."
