https://openalex.org/W2894451493,"Waking up in a trap Cancer patients who have undergone successful treatment can experience relapse of their disease years or even decades later. This is because cancer cells that have disseminated beyond the primary tumor site enter a state of dormancy, where they remain viable but not proliferating. Eventually, by mechanisms that are poorly understood, these clinically undetectable cells “wake up” and form actively growing metastases. Studying mouse models, Albrengues et al. found that sustained lung inflammation and the accompanying formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) could convert dormant cancer cells to aggressive lung metastases (see the Perspective by Aguirre-Ghiso). Awakening of these cells was associated with NET-mediated remodeling of the extracellular matrix and could be prevented by an antibody against the remodeled version of a matrix protein called laminin-111.

It is proving to be a valuable tool in archaeology, particularly where the remains of structures may be hidden beneath forest canopies. Canuto et al. present lidar data covering more than 2000 square kilometers of lowland Guatemala, which encompasses ancient settlements of the Classic Maya civilization (see the Perspective by Ford and Horn). The data yielded population estimates, measures of agricultural intensification, and evidence of investment in landscape-transforming infrastructure. The findings indicate that this Lowland Maya society was a regionally interconnected network of densely populated and defended cities, which were sustained by an array of agricultural practices that optimized land productivity and the interactions between rural and urban communities.

https://openalex.org/W2892867310,"How algae turn tides toxic Algal blooms can devastate marine mammal communities through the production of neurotoxins that accumulate within the food web. Brunson et al. identified a cluster of genes associated with biosynthesis of the neurotoxin domoic acid in a marine diatom (see the Perspective by Pohnert et al. ). In vitro experiments established a series of enzymes that create the core structure of the toxin. Knowledge of the genes involved in domoic acid production will allow for genetic monitoring of algal blooms and aid in identifying conditions that trigger toxin production.

https://openalex.org/W2894441743,"Background In addition to the number of antenatal care (ANC) visits, the items of ANC services covered by ANC visits greatly influence the effectiveness of the ANC services. Recently the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended not only to achieve a minimum of eight ANC visits, but also to use a core set of items of ANC services for safe motherhood. This study examined the levels and determinants of frequency and contents of ANC visits in Bangladesh and thus assessed the level of compliance with the WHO recommended number and the content of ANC services during pregnancy in Bangladesh. Methods The data for the study come from the 2014 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS), which covereda nationally representative sample of 17,863 ever-married women aged 15–49 years. Data derived from 4,627 mothers who gave birth in the three years preceding the survey constituted the study subjects. Descriptive, inferential and multivariate statistical techniques were used for data analysis. Results On average, mothers received less than three (2.7 visits) ANC visits and only 6% receive the recommended eight or more ANC visits. About 22% of the mothers received all the prescribed basic items of ANC services. About one-fifth (21%) of the mothers never received ANC visits and thus no items of ANC services. Measurement of blood pressure was the most common item received during ANC visit as reported by 69% mothers. Blood test was the least received item (43%). Significant positive association was found between frequency of ANC visits and receiving the increased number of items of ANC services. High socio-economic status, low parity, living in urban areas and certain administrative regions, planned pregnancies, having media exposure, visiting skilled providers for ANC services and visit to public or NGO health facilities are associated with frequent ANC visits and receiving higher number of items of ANC contents. Conclusion An unsatisfactory level of coverage of and content of ANC visits have been observed in Bangladesh. Further investigation is needed to identify the causes of under-utilization of ANC services in Bangladesh. A greater understanding of the identified risk factors and incorporating them into short and long term strategies would help improve the coverage and contents and thus quality of ANC services in Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W2893622942,"Disorders of the lungs such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are a major cause of chronic morbidity and mortality and the third leading cause of death in the world. The absence of sensitive diagnostic tests for early disease stages of COPD results in under-diagnosis of this treatable disease in an estimated 60–85% of the patients. In recent years a grating-based approach to X-ray dark-field contrast imaging has shown to be very sensitive for the detection and quantification of pulmonary emphysema in small animal models. However, translation of this technique to imaging systems suitable for humans remains challenging and has not yet been reported. In this manuscript, we present the first X-ray dark-field images of in-situ human lungs in a deceased body, demonstrating the feasibility of X-ray dark-field chest radiography on a human scale. Results were correlated with findings of computed tomography imaging and autopsy. The performance of the experimental radiography setup allows acquisition of multi-contrast chest X-ray images within clinical boundary conditions, including radiation dose. Upcoming clinical studies will have to demonstrate that this technology has the potential to improve early diagnosis of COPD and pulmonary diseases in general."
https://openalex.org/W2893685486,"The impact of probiotics on dogs with acute hemorrhagic diarrhea syndrome (AHDS) has not been evaluated so far. The study aim was to assess the effect of probiotic treatment on the clinical course, intestinal microbiome, and toxigenic Clostridium perfringens in dogs with AHDS in a prospective, placebo-controlled, blinded trial.Twenty-five dogs with AHDS with no signs of sepsis were randomly divided into a probiotic (PRO; Visbiome, ExeGi Pharma) and placebo group (PLAC). Treatment was administered for 21 days without antibiotics. Clinical signs were evaluated daily from day 0 to day 8. Key bacterial taxa, C. perfringens encoding NetF toxin and enterotoxin were assessed on days 0, 7, 21.Both groups showed a rapid clinical improvement. In PRO a significant clinical recovery was observed on day 3 (p = 0.008), while in PLAC it was observed on day 4 (p = 0.002) compared to day 0. Abundance of Blautia (p<0.001) and Faecalibacterium (p = 0.035) was significantly higher in PRO on day 7 compared to day 0, while in PLAC the abundance of Faecalibacterium was not significantly higher on any study day and Blautia (p = 0.016) was only significantly higher on day 21 compared to day 0. Abundance of C. perfringens was significantly lower on day 7 (p = 0.011) compared to day 0 in PRO but not in PLAC. Enterotoxin genes were significantly lower in PRO on day 21 (p = 0.028) compared to PLAC. Fecal samples of 57% of all dogs were positive for netF toxin genes on day 0 and the abundance was significantly lower on day 7 compared to day 0 in PRO (p = 0.016) and PLAC (p = 0.031).The probiotic treatment was associated with an accelerated normalization of the intestinal microbiome. Dogs with aseptic AHDS showed a rapid decrease of netF toxin genes and fast clinical recovery in both groups under symptomatic treatment without antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W2894273642,"Excessive fertilization is a common agricultural practice that often negatively influence soil and environmental quality in intensive vegetable production systems in China. To reduce negative effects of excessive fertilization, current studies generally focused on fertilizer management but not irrigation. In this study, we investigated the effects of fertilization and irrigation on soil properties, leaching water characteristics, plant growth, cucumber yield, irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) and partial factor productivity of nitrogen (PFPN) in a double cropping system. The treatments included (i) conventional irrigation with conventional N fertilization (IcNc), (ii) optimal irrigation with conventional N fertilization (IoNc), (iii) conventional irrigation with optimal N fertilization (IcNo), and (iv) optimal irrigation with optimal N fertilization (IoNo). In general, fertilization merely influenced concentrations of nitrate (NO3-), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), but did not affect most leaching water characteristics. In contrast, irrigation influenced pH, EC and concentrations of P, K, Ca, Mg, Na and Cu. Cumulative leached amounts of NO3-, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, Fe, Cu and Zn were significantly decreased by optimal irrigation as compared to conventional irrigation under same fertilization conditions, but not by optimal fertilization as compared to conventional fertilization under same irrigation conditions. The leachate volume was strongly positively correlated with cumulative leached amounts of all tested elements, and these relationships were obviously influenced by irrigation but not fertilization. The IoNo treatment significantly increased both IWUE and PFPN as compared to the IcNc treatment. However, the IcNo treatment only enhanced PFPN, while the IoNc treatment improved IWUE, when compared to the IcNc treatment. Our results suggested that irrigation has more influence than fertilization on leaching water quality and that the optimal irrigation combined with optimal fertilization was efficient in reducing the potential environmental risk caused by excessive fertilization in intensive vegetable production systems."
https://openalex.org/W2894235845,"Association analysis based on linkage disequilibrium has become a common and powerful approach for detection of QTLs underlying complex agronomic traits including drought tolerance. To determine marker/trait association, 148 modern European spring barley cultivars were evaluated under drought stress. Associations of morphological traits with AFLP/SSR markers were investigated based on the mixed linear model using the TASSEL3.0. Population structure was estimated using various methods including Bayesian clustering model by STRUCTURE software, PCoA analysis, NJ dendrogram and Hierarchical Clustering. Linkage disequilibrium patterns were explored among the whole genome and each chromosome separately. All the analysis for population structure divided the population into two sub-groups. Linkage disequilibrium analysis showed that by increasing genetic distance, LD decreases. Totally, 167 significant marker trait associations were found which delineated into 65 QTLs in both treatments. Two stable QTLs on 5H at 86.880 cM were detected for Internode Length and on 3H at 126.421 cM for flag leaf length in drought stress treatment. Fourteen QTLs were co-localized with previously reported QTLs and others were novel. The results indicate that these putative genomic regions contain genes that have pleiotropic effects on morphological traits in drought condition."

A quasi-experimental design was developed that included 426 Form 1 secondary school students. Respondents comprised 209 and 217 students in the treatment and control groups, respectively. SPSS 23.0, ANATES 4 and Amos 18 were used for data analysis. Findings indicated that mathematical representation plays a significant role as mediator between mathematical belief and arithmetic problem solving. The Realistic Mathematics Education (RME) approach successfully increased the arithmetic problem-solving ability of students."
https://openalex.org/W2893983296,"High expression of programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) by leukocytes in primary classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is associated with inferior outcome. However, it is unclear how expression varies during disease progression, and in the event of relapse. Our aim was to study PD-1 and PD-L1 in consecutive biopsies from untreated and treated cHL patients. We screened pathology registries from 3500 cHL patients. Eleven patients had a diagnostic cHL biopsy and a previous benign lymph node biopsy reclassified as cHL when reviewed and designated as the untreated. Thirty patients had a primary and a relapse biopsy, designated as the treated. Biopsies were immunostained to detect PD-1+ and PD-L1+ leukocytes, and PD-L1+ tumor cells. In the untreated, none of the markers were statistically significantly different when biopsies 1 and 2 were compared. In the treated, 19, 22, and 18 of 30 cases had increased proportions of PD-1+ leukocytes, PD-L1+ leukocytes and PD-L1+ tumor cells, respectively, and were all statistically significantly increased when primary and relapse biopsies were compared. PD-1 and PD-L1 most likely increase due to primary treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which could have implications regarding treatment with PD-1 inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2893942340,"Fabry disease is characterized by deficient expression/activity of α-GalA with consequent lysosomal accumulation in various organs of its substrate Gb3. Despite enzyme replacement therapy, Fabry disease progresses with serious myocardial, cerebral and renal manifestations. Gb3 accumulation may induce oxidative stress (OxSt), production of inflammatory cytokines and reduction of nitric oxide, which may impact on Fabry disease's clinical manifestations.OxSt status was characterized in 10 patients compared with 10 healthy subjects via protein expression of p22phox, subunit of NADH/NADPH oxidase, (Western blot), Heme oxygenase (HO)-1 levels (ELISA), antioxidant/anti-inflammatory, lipid peroxidation as malondialdehyde (MDA) production (colorimetric assay), phosphorylation state of Extracellular Signal Regulated Kinase (ERK)1/2 and Myosin Phosphatase Target Protein (MYPT)-1 (Western blot), marker of Rho kinase activation, both involved in OxSt signaling. Cardiac left ventricular (LV) mass was also evaluated (M-mode echocardiography).LV mass was higher in Fabry's males (123.72±2.03SEM g/m2) and females (132.09±6.72g/m2). p22phox expression was also higher in patients (1.04±0.09 d.u. vs 0.54±0.05 d.u. p<0.01) as well as MDA levels (54.51±3.97 vs 30.05±7.11 nmol/mL p = 0.01) while HO-1 was reduced (8.84±0.79 vs 14.03±1.23 ng/mL, p<0.02). MYPT-1's phosphorylation was increased in patients (0.52±0.11 d.u. vs 0.03±0.08 d.u., p<0.01) while phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was reduced (0.91±0.08 d.u. vs 1.53±0.17 d.u., p = 0.004).This study documents OxSt activation and the altered reaction to it in Fabry patients. Cardiac remodeling, Rho kinase signaling activation and reduction of protective HO-1 might suggest that, in addition to enzyme replacement therapy, OxSt inhibition by either pharmacological or nutritional measures, is likely to prove useful for the prevention/treatment of Fabry patients' cardiovascular-renal remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2892904178,"An influenza epidemic is still a problem despite the development of vaccines and anti-influenza drugs. Preventive measures such as handwashing are fundamental and important for counteracting influenza virus infection. In this study, we clarified the anti-influenza virus effects of surfactants, which are the main components of hand soaps for hand washing: potassium oleate (C18:1), sodium laureth sulfate (LES) and sodium lauryl sulfate (SDS). For a human influenza virus strain (H3N2), C18:1 reduced the infectivity by 4 logs or more, whereas LES and SDS reduced the infectivity by 1 log or less. Similar results were obtained when an avian influenza virus strain (H5N3) was used. The interaction between the surfactant and virus was then investigated by isothermal titration calorimetry. The LES-virus system showed a positive value of enthalpy changes (ΔH), meaning an exothermic interaction that indicated a hydrophobic interaction. In contrast, both the C18:1-virus system and the SDS-virus system showed negative values of ΔH, meaning an endothermic interaction that indicated an electrical interaction. The ΔH value of the C18:1-virus system was much higher than that of the SDS-virus system. A mixture of C18:1 and HA proteins similarly showed negative values of ΔH. These results indicate that influenza virus inactivation by a hydrophobic interaction of a surfactant with the viral envelope is insufficient to prevent infection, whereas inactivation by an electrical interaction of a surfactant with HA proteins is sufficient to prevent influenza virus infection."
https://openalex.org/W2894005295,"Individuals with high trait anxiety tend to be worse at flexibly adapting goal-directed behavior to meet changing demands relative to those with low trait anxiety. Past research on anxiety and cognitive flexibility has used tasks that involve overcoming a recently acquired rule, strategy, or response pattern after an abrupt change in task requirements (e.g., choice X led to positive outcomes but now leads to negative outcomes). An important limitation of this research is that many decision making situations require overcoming a preexisting bias (e.g., deciding whether to withdraw a historically winning investment that has experienced recent losses). In the present study we examined whether anxiety differences in the ability to overcome an acquired response extend to the ability to overcome a preexisting bias, when the bias produces objectively disadvantageous decisions. High anxiety (n = 78) and low anxiety participants (n = 76) completed a commonly used measure of cognitive flexibility, reversal learning, and a novel Framed Gambling Task that assessed the extent to which they could make advantageous decisions when the normatively correct choice was inconsistent with a preexisting framing bias. High anxiety participants showed the expected diminished reversal learning performance and also had poorer ability to make advantageous choices that were inconsistent with the framing bias. Worse performance in the Framed Gambling Task was not driven by poor knowledge of risk contingencies, because high anxiety participants reported the same explicit knowledge as low anxiety participants. Instead, the results suggest high anxiety is associated with general deficits in resolving interference from prepotent responses."
https://openalex.org/W2894527058,"This study investigated the utility of the pupillary light reflex as a method of differentiating DSPD patients with delayed melatonin timing relative to desired/required sleep time (circadian type) and those with non-delayed melatonin timing (non-circadian type). All participants were young adults, with a total of 14 circadian DSPD patients (M = 28.14, SD = 5.26), 12 non-circadian DSPD patients (M = 29.42, SD = 11.51) and 51 healthy controls (M = 21.47 SD = 3.16) completing the protocol. All participants were free of central nervous system acting medications and abstained from caffeine and alcohol on the day of the assessment. Two pupillary light reflex measurements were completed by each participant, one with a 1s dim (~10 lux) light exposure, and one with a 1s bright (~1500 lux) light exposure. Circadian DSPD patients showed a significantly faster pupillary light reflex than both non-circadian DSPD patients and healthy controls. Non-circadian patients and healthy controls did not differ significantly. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated to determine the utility of mean and maximum constriction velocity in differentiating the two DSPD phenotypes, and these demonstrated high levels of sensitivity (69.23--100%) and specificity (66.67-91.67%) at their optimal cut offs. The strongest predictor of DSPD phenotype was the mean constriction velocity to bright light (AUC = 0.87). These results support the potential for the pupillary light reflex to clinically differentiate between DSPD patients with normal vs. delayed circadian timing relative to desired bedtime, without the need for costly and time-consuming circadian assessments."
https://openalex.org/W2892772526,"Promoting health equity is a fundamental public health objective, yet health disparities remain largely overlooked in studies of vectorborne diseases, especially those transmitted by ticks. We sought to identify health disparities associated with Lyme disease and human monocytic ehrlichiosis, two of the most pervasive tickborne diseases within the United States. We used general linear mixed models to measure associations between county-level disease incidence and six variables representing racial/ethnic and socioeconomic characteristics of counties (percent white non-Hispanic; percent with a bachelors degree or higher; percent living below the poverty line; percent unemployed; percent of housing units vacant; per capita number of property crimes). Two ecological variables important to tick demography (percent forest cover; density of white-tailed deer) were included in secondary analyses to contextualize findings. Analyses included data from 2,695 counties in 37 states and the District of Columbia during 2007–2013. Each of the six variables was significantly associated with the incidence of one or both diseases, but the direction and magnitude of associations varied by disease. Results suggested that the incidence of Lyme disease was highest in counties with relatively higher proportions of white and more educated persons and lower poverty and crime rates; the incidence of human monocytic ehrlichiosis was highest in counties with relatively higher proportions of white and less educated persons, higher unemployment rates and lower crime rates. The percentage of housing units vacant was a strong positive predictor for both diseases with a magnitude of association comparable to those between incidence and the ecological variables. Our findings indicate that racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in disease incidence appear to be epidemiologically important features of Lyme disease and human monocytic ehrlichiosis in the United States. Steps to mitigate encroachment of wild flora and fauna into areas with vacant housing might be warranted to reduce disease risk."
https://openalex.org/W2892846611,"Wolbachia is an unculturable, intracellular bacterium that persists within an extremely broad range of arthropod and parasitic nematode hosts, where it is transmitted maternally to offspring via vertical transmission. In the filarial nematode Brugia malayi, a causative agent of human lymphatic filariasis, Wolbachia is an endosymbiont, and its presence is essential for proper nematode development, survival, and pathogenesis. While the elucidation of Wolbachia:nematode interactions that promote the bacterium’s intracellular persistence is of great importance, research has been hampered due to the fact that Wolbachia cannot be cultured in the absence of host cells. The Wolbachia endosymbiont of B. malayi (wBm) has an active Type IV secretion system (T4SS). Here, we have screened 47 putative T4SS effector proteins of wBm for their ability to modulate growth or the cell biology of a typical eukaryotic cell, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Five candidates strongly inhibited yeast growth upon expression, and 6 additional proteins showed toxicity in the presence of zinc and caffeine. Studies on the uptake of an endocytic vacuole-specific fluorescent marker, FM4-64, identified 4 proteins (wBm0076 wBm00114, wBm0447 and wBm0152) involved in vacuole membrane dynamics. The WAS(p)-family protein, wBm0076, was found to colocalize with yeast cortical actin patches and disrupted actin cytoskeleton dynamics upon expression. Deletion of the Arp2/3-activating protein, Abp1p, provided resistance to wBm0076 expression, suggesting a role for wBm0076 in regulating eukaryotic actin dynamics and cortical actin patch formation. Furthermore, wBm0152 was found to strongly disrupt endosome:vacuole cargo trafficking in yeast. This study provides molecular insight into the potential role of the T4SS in the Wolbachia endosymbiont:nematode relationship."
https://openalex.org/W2892941132,"Objectives Neonatal deaths account for 45% of all under-five deaths globally and 60% in Bangladesh. This study aimed to investigate the most common symptoms and complications in neonates, care-seeking practices of the mothers for their sick neonates, and factors associated with the care-seeking practices. Methods This cross-sectional study analysed data from an Endline Household Survey (as part of an evaluation of a paired cluster-randomised controlled trial study in 14 rural sub-districts in Bangladesh) of 2,931 women who gave birth recently. Descriptive analysis and logistic regressions were conducted to identify the care-seeking practices of mothers of sick neonates and the factors associated with the care-seeking from trained providers. Results Of the 2868 neonates, 886 (30.9%) were reported ill during first 28 days after birth. For those with reported symptoms, 748 (84.4%) of their mothers sought care. Of those who sought care, 65.2% sought care from untrained providers. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed significantly higher odds of care-seeking from trained providers when neonates had 3 or more concurrent symptoms (OR: 1.82; 95% CI: 1.07–3.08); when mothers perceived their neonates’ symptoms as severe (OR: 4.08; 95% CI: 2.92–5.70); when mothers received skilled care during pregnancy (OR: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.34–2.84); and when mothers had their delivery in a facility (OR: 3.50; 95% CI: 2.18–5.62). Mothers who delivered their babies at a facility, 43.1% of them sought care for their sick neonates at the same type of public hospital and 34.9% from same type of private hospitals where their deliveries took place. Conclusion Skilled care for mothers during pregnancy and delivery, and mothers’ perceptions of the severity of symptoms are the key associated factors of care-seeking for sick neonates from trained providers. Interventions should be tailored to increase care from trained providers during pregnancy and delivery at facilities to improve care-seeking for neonates from trained providers and for the survival of neonates."
https://openalex.org/W2893405899,"Aims Left atrial (LA) structural remodelling develops in rheumatic heart disease (RHD) according to the disease severity of the mitral valve and the presence of atrial fibrillation. Sustained active inflammation has been previously reported in the LA of patients with RHD, suggesting a direct role of cell-mediated immunity in the pathogenesis of LA remodelling. Dendritic cells (DCs) have a major antigen-presenting role, and are known as crucial modulators of innate and adaptive immunity. We investigated whether DCs are involved in the pathogenesis of LA remodelling in RHD. Methods and results Immunohistochemical analyses were performed using antibodies to CD11c, CD209 and CD80 as markers of myeloid DCs, migratory-active DCs, mature DCs and infiltrated inflammatory cells including T lymphocytes (CD3) and M1 (CD68; pro-inflammatory profile) and M2 (CD163; pro-resolution profile) macrophages. Furthermore, tenascin-C, an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein that appears during ECM remodelling and inflammatory response, was examined. Infiltrated myeloid DCs, migratory-active DCs, mature DCs and other inflammatory infiltrates including T lymphocytes and M1 and M2 macrophages, were significantly higher in the RHD group than the non-RHD group. The positive area fraction for tenascin-C was significantly higher in the RHD group than in the non-RHD group. Conclusion Our histological findings suggest that inflammation may persist long after a bout of rheumatic fever, ultimately leading to ECM remodelling. We identified and quantitatively assessed several subsets of DCs and other immunocompetent cells, and our results indicated that activation of DCs has some role in persistence of LA inflammation in patients with chronic RHD."
https://openalex.org/W2893435625,"Anthocyanins have significant functions in stress tolerance in pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) and also benefit human health. Nevertheless, the key structural genes and regulatory genes involved in anthocyanin accumulation in pepper fruits are still not well understood and fine mapped. For the present study, 383 F2 plants from a cross between the green-fruited C. annuum line Z5 and the purple-fruited line Z6 was developed. Two separate bulked DNA pools were constructed with DNAs extracted from either 37 plants with high anthocyanin content or from 18 plants with no anthocyanin. A combination of specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) and bulked segregant analysis (BSA) was used to identify candidates for regions associated with anthocyanin accumulation. We identified a total of 127,004 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, and detected 1674 high-quality SNP markers associated with anthocyanin accumulation. Three candidate anthocyanin-associated regions including the intervals from 12.48 to 20.00 Mb, from 54.67 to 56.59 Mb, and from 192.17 to 196.82 Mb were identified within a 14.10-Mb interval on chromosome 10 containing 126 candidate genes. Based on their annotations, we identified 12 candidate genes that are predicted to be associated with anthocyanin expression. The present results provide an efficient strategy for genetic mapping of and valuable insights into the genetic mechanisms of anthocyanin accumulation in pepper fruit, and allow us to clone and functionally analyze the genes that influence anthocyanin accumulation in this species."
https://openalex.org/W2894400902,"Background Plant pathogenic fungi of the genus Fusarium infect a wide array of crops and produce numerous health-threatening mycotoxins. Recently, we found that larvae of the common pest of stored products Tenebrio molitor preferably fed on grains colonized with Fusarium proliferatum. We draw the hypothesis that the increased attractiveness of infected grains for mealworms facilitates dispersal of the fungus. In this work we examined the dissemination of F. proliferatum and further Fusarium spp. by adults of T. molitor. Results Mealworm beetle Tenebrio molitor transmitted Fusarium species F. avenaceum, F. culmorum, F. poae, and F. proliferatum to wheat grains with varying efficiency. F. proliferatum was disseminated most efficiently: 20 days after feeding on Fusarium cultures, the beetles still transmitted F. proliferatum to most grains exposed to feeding. The transmission of F. culmorum gradually declined over time and the transmission of the other Fusarium spp. ceased completely 20 d after beetles feeding of fungal cultures. Propagules of F. proliferatum and F. culmorum were traceable in beetles' feces for 20 days while no colonies of F. poae and F. avenaceum were detectable after 5 days. Because F. proliferatum was transmitted by mealworms most efficiently, this species was further investigated. Mealworm beetles T. molitor preferred feeding on grains colonized with F. proliferatum as compared to uninfected grains. Male beetles infected with F. proliferatum transmitted the fungus by copulation. Conclusions Efficient dissemination of F. proliferatum by mealworm beetle together with the feeding preference of the beetle for grains colonized with F. proliferatum show that the chemical phenotype of the fungus responsible for the enhanced attractiveness of infected grains is subjected to positive selection. This indicates that adaptation of F. proliferatum to transmission by insects involved an alteration of insects' feeding preferences."
https://openalex.org/W2893786439,"The multi-plated skeleton of echinoids is made of the stereom, a light-weight construction which resembles a micro-beam framework. Although the two-dimensional design of the stereom has been studied, its spatial architecture is only little known. It is, however, imperative to understand the spatial architecture of the trabecular system in order to interpret its structural principles of this load-bearing construction. The echinoid’s trabecular system is thus analyzed in-depth with respect to eight topological descriptors. The echinoid’s plates are divided into two regions, the center of which consists of an unordered stereom, and the margin which consists of an ordered stereom. The eight trabecular descriptors indicate that the basal topology of the two plate regions are similar. The trabecular system predominantly consists of short and stocky trabeculae that show little tortuosity. The majority of trabeculae intersect in a 3N configuration, where three trabeculae intersect in one common node. Trabeculae in the 3N configuration intersect in an angle of around 120° resulting in a planar and triangular motif. These planar elements, when arranged in an angular off-set, can resist multi-dimensional loads. Results also show that the trabecular orientation perpendicular to the plate’s surface is at an angle of 60°. The trabecular orientation in the plate’s horizontal plane is directional. Both trabecular orientations reflect a construction which is capable of resisting applied loads and can distribute these loads over the entire skeleton. The spatial architecture of the echinoid’s trabecular system is thus considered to be a performative light-weight and load-bearing system."
https://openalex.org/W2893807366,"Among the organic acids, lauric acid has shown a high level of in vitro activity against Campylobacter jejuni. The prevalence and intensity of C. jejuni excretion at slaughter often becomes lower with increasing age. In higher-aged broilers on organic farms which often use other breeds, in turn, the prevalence of C. jejuni is sometimes higher at slaughter. The question then arises as to whether a diet with higher lauric acid concentrations, the age alone or the genetic breed might have an effect in the spread and intensity of an experimental C. jejuni infection in vivo. Therefore, two complete diets with or without 2% lauric acid from palm kernel fatty acids were offered to 450 chickens (ten subgroups à 15 birds, repetitions: n = 3) of two broiler and two layer breeds (Ross 308, Hubbard JA 757, Lohmann Dual and Lohmann Brown-Classic). All breeds were reared for 42 days, Lohmann Brown-Classic also for about 98 days. Twenty-one days before dissection, three seeder birds per subgroup were orally infected with a 1 mL inoculum of C. jejuni (4.46±0.35 log10 CFU/mL). Qualitative detection of C. jejuni in cloacal swabs was performed at days 2, 4, 7, 14 after inoculation and at dissection in all birds. Quantitative detection was performed on excreta samples of seeder birds at days 2, 11 and 17 after experimental challenge and on caecal samples of all birds at dissection. Two days after experimental inoculation, C. jejuni prevalence was higher in control birds without lauric acid supplementation (48.9% vs. 39.6%; P = 0.0462). Depending on age, two days after inoculation the C. jejuni prevalence in young Lohmann Brown-Classic chickens was significantly lower (37.8% vs. 61.1%) whereas at dissection it was higher (99% vs. 67%). At day 2 after inoculation C. jejuni counts in the excreta of young Lohmann Brown-Classic were lower in comparison to those in old ones (log10 CFU/g: 3.30±2.68 vs. 5.24±1.56). Eleven (log10 CFU/g: 5.14±1.13 vs. 4.16±0.82) and 17 days after inoculatioin (log10 CFU/g: 3.77±2.02 vs. 1.72±1.87) it was the reverse situation. At dissection, the carriage of C. jejuni in caecal content was higher in younger than in older birds (log10 CFU/g: 8.57±0.46 vs. 6.66±1.43). An effect of genetic breed on C. jejuni prevalence was seen at dissection, this being lowest in Lohmann Dual chickens (91% vs. 98.9% in other breeds). At d 17 after challenge, C. jejuni counts in the excreta of young Lohmann Brown-Classic were lower in comparison to Ross 308 and Hubbard JA 757 (log10 CFU/g: 3.77±2.02 vs. 5.21±0.85 and 5.62±0.90). Lohmann Dual chickens showed an intermediary excretion, this being only significant lower compared to Hubbard JA 757 (log10 CFU/g: 4.31±0.89). In summary, the effect of lauric acid is limited to the initial phase after experimental inoculation. A higher age at infection seems to lead to a more rapid limitation of the infection. The excretion of C. jejuni appears to decrease more rapidly in layer breeds than in broiler lines after experimental inoculation."
https://openalex.org/W2894321148,"Introduction Typhoid fever (TF) continues to cause considerable morbidity and mortality in Nepal, but only limited epidemiologic data is available about TF outside Kathmandu. Methods As part of an interventional trial, we performed a prospective cohort study of bacteremic TF patients in Dhulikhel Hospital between October 2012 and October 2014. Demographic, epidemiological, clinical, and microbiologic data were recorded. Results 116 bacteremic typhoid patients were included in the study. Most were young, healthy, adults (mean age 27.9±12 years), 41.4% of whom were female. More than 70% of patients were employed in non-manual services or were university students. Salmonella Typhi accounted for 64/115 (55.7%) of all isolates, while Salmonella Paratyphi accounted for 51/115 (44.3%), of which 42 were Paratyphi A and 9 Paratyphi B. A significant proportion of TF cases occurred also during the dry season (48/116, 41.6%). The clinical presentation of Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi infections was similar, except for a greater proportion of arthralgia in patients with Salmonella Typhi. Most Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid and susceptible to older antibiotics. One Salmonella Paratyphi isolate was resistant to ceftriaxone. Conclusions TF remains common in the Dhulikhel area, even among those with a high level of education. Public health measures aimed at reducing the incidence of TF in the Dhulikhel area are warranted. The relative burden of TF caused by Salmonella Paratyphi is rising; a vaccine with activity against Salmonella Paratyphi is needed. Since Salmonella Paratyphi B was more prevalent in this cohort than in large cohorts of patients from Kathmandu, it is likely that there are significant regional variations in the epidemiology of TF outside Kathmandu."
https://openalex.org/W2894373962,"Soil respiration is the second largest terrestrial carbon (C) flux; the responses of soil respiration to nitrogen (N) deposition have far-reaching influences on the global C cycle. N deposition has been documented to significantly affect soil respiration, but the results are conflicting. The response of soil respiration to N deposition gradients remains unclear, especially in ecosystems receiving increasing ambient N depositions. A field experiment was conducted in a natural evergreen broadleaf forest in western China from November 2013 to November 2015 to understand the effects of increasing N deposition on soil respiration. Four levels of N deposition were investigated: control (Ctr, without N added), low N (L, 50 kg N ha-1·a-1), medium N (M, 150 kg N ha-1·a-1), and high N (H, 300 kg N ha-1·a-1). The results show that (1) the mean soil respiration rates in the L, M, and H treatments were 9.13%, 15.8% (P < 0.05) and 22.57% (P < 0.05) lower than that in the Ctr treatment (1.56 ± 0.13 μmol·m-2·s-1), respectively; (2) soil respiration rates showed significant positive exponential and linear relationships with soil temperature and moisture (P < 0.01), respectively. Soil temperature is more important than soil moisture in controlling the soil respiration rate; (3) the Ctr, L, M, and H treatments yielded Q10 values of 2.98, 2.78, 2.65, and 2.63, respectively. N deposition decreased the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration; (4) simulated N deposition also significantly decreased the microbial biomass C and N, fine root biomass, pH and extractable dissolved organic C (P < 0.05). Overall, the results suggest that soil respiration declines in response to N deposition. The decrease in soil respiration caused by simulated N deposition may occur through decreasing the microbial biomass C and N, fine root biomass, pH and extractable dissolved organic C. Ongoing N deposition may have significant impacts on C cycles and increase C sequestration with the increase in global temperature in evergreen broadleaf forests."
https://openalex.org/W2894353895,"Purpose In Mexico, 39.5% of adolescents do not meet the World Health Organisation’s physical activity guidelines. Urbanicity is a potential correlate of physical activity. The aim of this study was to examine the associations between different aspects of urbanicity and adolescents’ physical activity. Methods Participants were 4,079 Mexican adolescents aged 15–18 from Mexico City and Oaxaca, Mexico. Data was collected between February and June 2016. Multiple imputation of missing data was implemented after confirming values were missing at random. Multivariable regression models examined associations between five domains of self-reported physical activity: 1) moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, 2) sports activities, 3) leisure time activities, 4) Physical Education class at school, 5) active commuting to school; and a composite measure of urbanicity and its seven sub-scores: 1) demographic, 2) economic activity, 3) built environment, 4) communication, 5) education, 6) diversity and 7) health services. Multivariable regression models were adjusted for parents’ education and participants’ age. Results Urbanicity was positively associated with activity spent in Physical Education class. The association between urbanicity and sport activities depended on state context. Communication-based urbanicity was negatively associated with leisure physical activity and active commuting. Population density was positively associated with active commuting. Conclusion Urbanicity is associated with adolescents’ physical activity in Mexico. Findings were largely consistent between Mexico City and Oaxaca and highlight the value of examining urbanicity as a multidimensional construct."

We hypothesized that children in the Childhood Origins of Asthma (COAST) Cohort with asthma and atopic conditions would have early carotid arterial injury.The COAST study is a longitudinal birth cohort of children at increased risk of developing asthma. Children underwent ultrasonography measuring far wall right carotid bifurcation (RCB) and common carotid artery (RCCA) intima-media thickness (IMT; a measure of arterial injury). Multivariable linear regression models adjusted for age, gender, race, blood pressure, and body-mass index were used to assess associations of asthma and markers of arterial injury.The 89 participants were a mean (standard deviation) 15.3 (0.6) years old and 42% were female; 28 asthmatics had atopic disease, 34 asthmatics were without other atopic disease, and 15 non-asthmatics had atopic disease. This study population was compared to 12 controls (participants free of asthma or atopic disease). Compared to controls (589 μm), those with atopic disease (653 μm, p = 0.07), asthma (649 μm, p = 0.05), or both (677 μm, p = 0.005) had progressively higher RCB IMT values (ptrend = 0.011). In adjusted models, asthmatic and/or atopic participants had significantly higher RCB IMT than those without asthma or atopic disease (all p≤0.03). Similar relationships were found for RCCA IMT.Adolescents with asthma and other atopic diseases have an increased risk of subclinical arterial injury compared to children without asthma or other atopic disease."
https://openalex.org/W2893761478,"Sexual minority young people use licit and illicit substances at disproportionate levels. However, little is known about the perceptions of substance use among members of LGBT communities. This paper reports the results of a content analysis of 45 semi-structured interviews about substance use in LGBT communities with sexual minority young people (n = 31) and community stakeholders (n = 14). Results indicated both sexual minority youth and community stakeholders perceived the use and acceptance of substances to be higher in LGBT communities compared to the general population. Participants identified a range of characteristics potentially leading to higher levels of substance use including peer pressure, high exposure to substance use, and the high concentrations of licensed venues in LGBT communities. Marginalisation, discrimination and mental health were also perceived as important reasons for these disparities. Community stakeholders identified a range of potential interventions including legislation to address discrimination and substance use, increased services and activities, advertising in commercial LGBT venues and social media, and reinvigorating community cohesion."
https://openalex.org/W2894294830,"Deliberate self-poisoning (DSP) using organophosphorus (OP) insecticides are a common clinical problem in Asia. OPs inhibit acetylcholine esterase (AChE), leading to over-activity of muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic circuits. Intermediate syndrome (IMS) is mediated via prolonged nicotinic receptor stimulation at the neuromuscular junction and its onset is between 24-96 hours post ingestion. The aims of the present study were 1) to investigate whether neuromuscular junction dysfunction within the first 24 hours following exposure, quantified by jitter in single fibre electromyography (SfEMG), can predict IMS, and 2) to compare the changes in SfEMG jitter over the course of the illness among patients who developed IMS (IMS+) and those who did not (IMS-).We conducted a prospective cohort study in a tertiary care hospital in Sri Lanka on 120 patients admitted between September 2014 and August 2016 following DSP by OP insecticides viz., profenofos 53, phenthoate 17, diazinon 13, chlorpyrifos 5, others 12, unknown 20. SfEMG was performed every second day during hospitalization. Exposure was confirmed based on the history and red blood cell AChE assays. IMS was diagnosed in patients who demonstrated at least three out of four of the standard IMS criteria: proximal muscle weakness, bulbar muscle weakness, neck muscle weakness, respiratory paralysis between 24-96 hours post ingestion. Respiratory failure requiring intubation occurred in 73 out of 120 patients; 64 of these were clinically diagnosed with IMS. Of the 120 patients, 96 had repeated SfEMG testing, 67 of them being tested within the first 24 hours. Prolonged jitter (>33.4μs) within the first 24 hours was associated with greatly increased risk of IMS (odds ratio = 8.9, 95% confidence intervals = 2.4-29.6, p = 0.0003; sensitivity 86%, specificity 58%). The differences in jitter between IMS+ and IMS- patients remained significant for 72 hours and increased jitter was observed in some patients for up to 216 hours. For intubated patients, the median time for jitter to normalize and median time to extubate were similar, and the two variables had a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.49, P = 0.001).Prolonged jitter recorded with SfEMG <24 hours of ingestion of an OP strongly correlates with subsequent occurrence of IMS. The time course of electrophysiological recovery of the NMJ was similar to the time course of respiratory recovery in IMS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2892658217,"Commensal and pathogenic bacteria have evolved efficient enzymatic pathways to feed on host carbohydrates, including protein-linked glycans. Most proteins of the human innate and adaptive immune system are glycoproteins where the glycan is critical for structural and functional integrity. Besides enabling nutrition, the degradation of host N-glycans serves as a means for bacteria to modulate the host’s immune system by for instance removing N-glycans on immunoglobulin G. The commensal bacterium Cutibacterium acnes is a gram-positive natural bacterial species of the human skin microbiota. Under certain circumstances, C. acnes can cause pathogenic conditions, acne vulgaris, which typically affects 80% of adolescents, and can become critical for immunosuppressed transplant patients. Others have shown that C. acnes can degrade certain host O-glycans, however, no degradation pathway for host N-glycans has been proposed. To investigate this, we scanned the C. acnes genome and were able to identify a set of gene candidates consistent with a cytoplasmic N-glycan-degradation pathway of the canonical eukaryotic N-glycan core. We also found additional gene sequences containing secretion signals that are possible candidates for initial trimming on the extracellular side. Furthermore, one of the identified gene products of the cytoplasmic pathway, AEE72695, was produced and characterized, and found to be a functional, dimeric exo-β-1,4-mannosidase with activity on the β-1,4 glycosidic bond between the second N-acetylglucosamine and the first mannose residue in the canonical eukaryotic N-glycan core. These findings corroborate our model of the cytoplasmic part of a C. acnes N-glycan degradation pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2893381347,"This study aimed to estimate prevalence of common mental disorders (CMD) and associated factors among dental students. In this cross-sectional study, 230 students answered a questionnaire and instruments to assess CMD (Self Reporting Questionnaire-20), hazardous alcohol consumption (Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test), social support (Social Support Scale), perceptions of academic life (Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure), coping (Ways of Coping Inventory) and resilience (Resilience Scale). Bivariate analysis was conducted using the Chi-Square and Mann-Whitney tests. Logistic regression included all explanatory variableswith p<0.20 in the bivariate analysis, besides sex and academic year. The explanatory variables were analyzed in five successive blocks (backward-stepwise), until all variables presented statistical significance in the final model (p<0.05). The prevalence of CMD was 45.2% (95%CI: 38.7-51.6), with no significant differences between sexes. Students with no extracurricular activities, who had negatively self- assessed their health status and their academic performance, were about four times more likely to present CMD, followed by receiving psychological or psychiatric treatment during university (AOR: 2.65; 95%CI: 1.1-6.1) and those with high scores for confrontive coping (AOR: 1.20; 95%CI: 1.0-1.4). Resilience was a protective factor for CMD among dental students (AOR: 0.93; 95%CI: 0.9-1.0). Aspects related to academic performance, health status and confrontive coping strategies were risk factors to students' mental health. Individuals with high levels of resilience showed lower prevalence of CMD. Further prospective studies could contribute to understanding the role of resilience among this population."
https://openalex.org/W2894026622,"Long alpha helix (LAH) from influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) stem or stalk domain is one of the most conserved influenza virus antigens. Expression of N-terminally extended LAH in E. coli leads to assembly of α-h elical homotrimer which is structurally nearly identical to the corresponding region of post-fusion form of native HA. This novel tri-stalk protein was able to differentiate between group 1 and 2 influenza in ELISA with virus-infected mice sera. It was also successfully applied for enzyme-linked immunospot assay to estimate the number of HA stem-reactive antibody (Ab)-secreting cells in mice. An in-house indirect ELISA was developed using a HA tri-stalk protein as a coating antigen for evaluation of HA stem-specific Ab levels in human sera collected in Luxembourg from 211 persons with occupational exposure to swine before the pandemic H1N1/09 virus had spread to Western Europe. Our results show that 70% of these pre-pandemic sera are positive for HA stem-specific Abs. In addition, levels of HA stem-specific Abs have positive correlation with the corresponding IgG titers and neutralizing activities against pandemic H1N1/09 virus."
https://openalex.org/W2894397376,"Anopheles sinensis is a major malarial vector in China and Southeast Asia. The mitochondria is involved in many important biological functions. Nuclear mitochondrial DNA segments (NUMTs) are common in eukaryotic organisms, but their characteristics are poorly understood. We sequenced and analyzed the complete mitochondrial (mt) genome of An. sinensis. The mt genome is 15,418 bp long and contains 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), two rRNAs, 22 tRNAs and a large non-coding region. Its gene arrangement is similar to previously published mosquito mt genomes. We identified and analyzed the NUMTs of 19 mosquito species with both nuclear genomes and mt genome sequences. The number, total length and density of NUMTs are significantly correlated with genome size. About half of NUMTs are short (< 200 bp), but larger genomes can house longer NUMTs. NUMTs may help explain genome size expansion in mosquitoes. The expansion due to mitochondrial insertion segments is variable in different insect groups. PCGs are transferred to nuclear genomes at a higher frequency in mosquitoes, but NUMT origination is more different than in mammals. Larger-sized nuclear genomes have longer mt genome sequences in both mosquitoes and mammals. The study provides a foundation for the functional research of mitochondrial genes in An. sinensis and helps us understand the characteristics and origin of NUMTs and the potential contribution to genome expansion."
https://openalex.org/W2894477482,"Objective Recent guidelines for chronic or recurrent low back pain recommend non-pharmacologic treatments as first-line options. The objective of this study was thus to explore the perceived usefulness of several conventional and complementary medicine treatments for chronic or recurrent low back pain by primary care physicians and their reported prescribing behavior. Design An exploratory cross-sectional study. Setting and participants Primary care physicians of the French-speaking part of Switzerland. Main outcome measures Primary care physicians’ perceived usefulness of each conventional and complementary medicine treatment and their reported recommendation behavior were considered dependent variables in multivariate logistic regression models. All correlations were computed between binary variables, and phi coefficients were calculated to estimate correlation strengths. Results 533 primary care physicians answered the questionnaire (response rate: 25.6%). The top 3 conventional treatments most often considered useful by primary care physicians for chronic or recurrent low back pain were physiotherapy (94.8%), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (87.9%), and manual therapy (82.5%), whereas the most prescribed conventional treatments were physiotherapy (99.2%), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (97.4%), and acetaminophen (94.4%). Osteopathic treatment (78.4%), yoga (69.3%), and therapeutic massage (63.9%) were the complementary medicine treatments most often considered useful by primary care physicians in managing chronic or recurrent low back pain. Being a female physician, younger than 56 years, trained in complementary medicine, or using complementary medicine were all associated with higher perceived usefulness of complementary medicine treatments in general. The most recommended complementary medicine treatments by primary care physicians were osteopathic treatment (87.3%), acupuncture (69.3%), and therapeutic massage (58.7%). Being a female physician, younger than 56, and using complementary medicine were all associated with more complementary medicine recommendation in general. Conclusion Our results highlight the importance of better understanding the prescribing patterns of primary care physicians for chronic or recurrent low back pain. Considering the frequency and burden of chronic or recurrent low back pain, programs focusing on the most (cost-) effective treatments should be implemented."
https://openalex.org/W2893900385,"Premature infants represent one of the groups with increased risk for metabolic syndrome. Our study is the first one to evaluate irisin and visfatin levels, associated with the metabolic syndrome, both in blood of preterm and full-term infants, as well as in the breastmilk of their mothers. A total of 72 newborns was enrolled in the study, including 53 very low birth weight preterm infants and a control group of 19 term infants. The levels of irisin and visfatin were determined by a commercial enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay both in the baby serum and maternal milk twice, first during the 1st week of life and then 4 weeks later. Preterm infants had significantly lower serum irisin levels compared to the term infants. Overall, serum irisin level during the 1st week of life was positively correlated with several anthropometric measurements at birth, as well as during 5th weeks of age. In contrast, serum visfatin levels during 5th week of life were negatively correlated with z-scores of birth weight, weight and head circumference during 5th week of age. We found a strong negative correlation between serum irisin and serum visfatin levels at both analyzed time points. The level of milk visfatin was significantly higher in the mothers of the preterm group during 5th week of life. In conclusion, our results provide further evidence that irisin and visfatin may play physiologic roles in development of both preterm and full-term newborns during their first month after birth. Observed differences in irisin and visfatin serum and breastmilk concentrations during the earliest stages of life may contribute to development of catch up growth, but also, they might eventually lead to a higher risk for metabolic syndrome in prematurely born children in later years."
https://openalex.org/W2894121351,"Background Despite having similar palliative needs to patients with lung cancer, advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients are less likely to receive palliative care. To evaluate the effect of introducing specialized palliative care with severe to very severe COPD patients, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted in Switzerland. Aim To explore COPD patients’ recollection of the trial, their needs and the usefulness of the palliative care interventions. Design and setting Qualitative study with advanced COPD patients who participated in a specialized palliative care intervention, conducted in a general hospital. Method Eighteen patients with severe to very severe COPD were interviewed about their experiences. Interviews were transcribed and thematic content analysis was performed. Results Patients had poor recollection of the trial and difficulties understanding the palliative care intervention. No major differences were observed between patients who received the specialized intervention and those who did not. Content analysis emphasized that although they experienced disabling symptoms, participants tended to attribute their limitations to problems other than COPD and some declared that they were not sick. Patients reported restrictions due to oxygen therapy, and the burden of becoming dependent on it. This dependence resulted in intense anxiety, leading participants to focus on the present only. A strong feeling of perceived helplessness emerged from the patients’ interviews. Conclusions Our findings suggest that poor recollection and understanding of the palliative care intervention act as barriers to the conduct of clinical trials with severe and very severe COPD patients. Their cognitive difficulties, perception of COPD, functional limitations, overwhelming anxiety, focus on the present and perceived helplessness also seem to hinder the implementation of such care."

The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of L-arginine supplementation and resistance training on muscle mass, hemodynamic function and DNA damage in healthy rats subjected to a low-arginine concentration diet. Twenty three Wistar rats (290-320g) were divided into 4 groups: Sedentary (SED-Arg, n = 6), Sedentary+Arg (SED+Arg, n = 6), Resistance Training (RT-Arg, n = 5), Resistance Training+Arg (RT+Arg, n = 6). Trained animals performed resistance training protocol in a squat apparatus adapted for rats (4 sets of 10–12 repetitions, 90s of interval, 4x/week, 65–75% of One Maximum Repetition, for 8 weeks). Comet assay was performed to measure DNA damage in leukocytes. The resistance training induced higher muscle mass in trained groups. The L-arginine supplementation increased both gastrocnemius and left ventricle to body mass ratio and increased left ventricle contractility without changing hemodynamic variables. The SED+Arg group showed higher concentration of extracellular heat shock protein 72 (eHSP72) and total testosterone, as well as lower uric acid concentration in blood versus SED-Arg group. The administration of isolated L-arginine supplementation and its association with resistance training promoted less damage in leukocytes DNA. In conclusion, the L-arginine supplementation showed synergistic effect with resistance training regarding leukocyte genomic stability in a low-L-arginine diet scenario."
https://openalex.org/W2893286937,"Recently, the ratio of patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) among hemodialysis (HD) patients has increased to become the largest sub-population. Their prognoses are significantly worse than those of patients without diabetes (non-DM). In the present study, 10 DM patients who did not take meals and 10 non-DM patients who took meals during HD sessions were investigated. The time courses of the change in plasma levels of metabolites during HD were determined. DM patients exhibited decreased plasma levels of lactate, pyruvate and alanine and dramatically increased levels of ketone bodies. At the end of HD, the plasma levels of lactate, pyruvate, alanine and ketone body were 0.46 ± 0.07, 0.026 ± 0.01, 0.12 ± 0.04 and 0.26 ± 0.04 mM (mean ± standard error), respectively. The profile was ‘hypolactatemia and hyperketonemia’, indicating non-homeostasis. Glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle were suppressed, and the oxidation of fatty acid was accelerated, indicating starvation, even though high amounts of glucose (150 mg/dl) in dialysate were supplied continuously to the bloodstream. In contrast, the plasma levels of lactate, pyruvate, and alanine in the non-DM patients were increased, with the levels of ketone body remaining low during HD to maintain homeostasis, indicating accelerated glycolysis. Furthermore, their plasma levels of insulin increased from 8.1 ± 1.4 to 19.8 ± 3.4 μU/ml, which indicated endogenous secretion stimulated by glucose in dialysate and meal intake. In contrast, in the DM patients, the levels decreased from 19.2 ± 3.4 to 5.5 ± 1.1 μU/ml. This value was the lower limit of the normal range. The depletion of the insulin through extracorporeal circulation may inhibit the transportation of glucose from the blood into the muscles, with the consequence of cell starvation. Such cell starvation along with lipolysis every two days may accelerate proteolysis and affect the prognosis of DM patients."
https://openalex.org/W2893697316,"Coexistence of highly similar species is at odds with ecological theory of competition; coexistence, then, requires stabilizing mechanisms such as differences in ecological niche. In the bacterivore nematode Litoditis marina species complex, which occurs associated with macro-algae, four cryptic lineages (Pm I-IV) co-occur in the field along the south-western coast and estuaries of The Netherlands. Here we investigate the temporal and/or spatial niche differentiation in their natural environment using a qPCR-based detection and relative quantification method. We collected different algal species (i.e. two Fucus species and Ulva sp.) and separated algal structures (i.e. receptacula, thalli, non-fertile tips and bladders) at different sampling months and times (i.e. twice per sampling month), to examine differences in microhabitat use between coexisting L. marina species. Results demonstrate that the cryptic species composition varied among different algal species and algal structures, which was also subject to temporal shifts. Pm I dominated on Fucus spp., Pm II showed dominance on Ulva sp., while Pm III overall had the lowest frequencies. Microhabitat partitioning was most pronounced between the two cryptic species which had similar microbiomes (Pm I and Pm II), and less so between the two species which had significantly different microbiomes (Pm I and Pm III), suggesting that species which share the same microhabitats may avoid competition through resource partitioning. The interplay of microhabitat differentiation and temporal dynamics among the cryptic species of L. marina implies that there is a complex interaction between biotic components and abiotic factors which contributes to their coexistence in the field."
https://openalex.org/W2892443464,"Objective The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of tissue engineered bovine tissue pericardium scaffold (CardioCel) for the repair of congenital heart defects in comparison with surgery using xenogeneic, autologous, and synthetic patches over a 40-year time horizon from the perspective of the UK National Health Service. Methods A six-state Markov state-transition model to model natural history of disease and difference in the interventional effect of surgeries depending on patch type implanted. Patches differed regarding their probability of re-operation due to patch calcification, based on a systematic literature review. Transition probabilities were based on the published literature, other clinical inputs were based on UK registry data, and cost data were based on UK sources and the published literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was determined as incremental costs per quality adjusted life years (QALY) gained. We used a 40-year analytic time-horizon and adopted the payer perspective. Comprehensive sensitivity analyses were performed. Results According to the model predictions, CardioCel was associated with reduced incidence of re-operation, increased QALY, and costs savings compared to all other patches. Cost savings were greatest compared to synthetic patches. Estimated cost savings associated with CardioCel were greatest within atrioventricular septal defect repair and lowest for ventricular septal defect repair. Based on our model, CardioCel relative risk for re-operations is 0.938, 0.956and 0.902 relative to xenogeneic, autologous, and synthetic patches, respectively. Conclusion CardioCel was estimated to increase health benefits and save cost when used during surgery for congenital heart defects instead of other patches."
https://openalex.org/W2894267579,"The nucleus accumbens (NAcc) has been suggested as a possible target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the treatment of obesity. Our hypothesis was that NAcc-DBS would modulate brain regions related to reward and food intake regulation, consequently reducing the food intake and, finally, the weight gain. Therefore, we examined changes in brain glucose metabolism, weight gain and food intake after NAcc-DBS in a rat model of obesity.Electrodes were bilaterally implanted in 2 groups of obese Zucker rats targeting the NAcc. One group received stimulation one hour daily during 15 days, while the other remained as control. Weight and daily consumption of food and water were everyday registered the days of stimulation, and twice per week during the following month. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies with 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) were performed 1 day after the end of DBS. PET data was assessed by statistical parametric mapping (SPM12) software and region of interest (ROI) analyses.NAcc-DBS lead to increased metabolism in the cingulate-retrosplenial-parietal association cortices, and decreased metabolism in the NAcc, thalamic and pretectal nuclei. Furthermore, ROIs analyses confirmed these results by showing a significant striatal and thalamic hypometabolism, and a cortical hypermetabolic region. However, NAcc-DBS did not induce a decrease in either weight gain or food intake.NAcc-DBS led to changes in the metabolism of regions associated with cognitive and reward systems, whose impairment has been described in obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2893906845,"Telomere length (TL) is considered as a marker of cell senescence, but factors influencing the rate of TL attrition are not well understood. While one previous study reported the association of occupation and TL, many subsequent studies have failed to find the association. This may be due to heterogeneity within the samples and cross-sectional designs. This longitudinal study examines two occupational characteristics, occupational complexity and hazardous conditions, as predictors of TL attrition in gender- and race/ethnicity-stratified analysis. Leukocyte TL (expressed as T/S ratio) was measured twice over a 10-year period in a multi-racial sample (n = 914). Linear mixed effect models were used to estimate TL attrition associated with occupational complexity and hazardous conditions. Analysis was stratified by gender and race/ethnicity (white, African American, and Latino) and controlled for baseline age, baseline TL, and time since baseline. Higher occupational complexity was associated with slower rates of TL attrition only among white men. Hazardous conditions were not associated with TL attrition for any gender-and-race/ethnicity stratified group. Occupational complexity may influence TL attrition, but the different findings for white men and other groups suggest that a more comprehensive framework is needed to better understand the potential link between occupational characteristics and biological aging."
https://openalex.org/W2893073491,"Background Mental health disorders present significant health challenges in populations in sub Saharan Africa especially in deprived urban poor contexts. Some studies have suggested that in collectivistic societies such as most African societies people can draw on social capital to attenuate the effect of community stressors on their mental health. Global studies suggest the effect of social capital on mental disorders such as psychological distress is mixed, and emerging studies on the psychosocial characteristics of collectivistic societies suggest that mistrust and suspicion sometimes deprive people of the benefit of social capital. In this study, we argue that trust which is often measured as a component of social capital has a more direct effect on reducing community stressors in such deprived communities. Methods Data from the Urban Health and Poverty Survey (EDULINK Wave III) survey were used. The survey was conducted in 2013 in three urban poor communities in Accra: Agbogbloshie, James Town and Ussher Town. Psychological distress was measured with a symptomatic wellbeing scale. Participants’ perceptions of their neighbours’ willingness to trust, protect and assist others was used to measure community sense of trust. Participants’ willingness to ask for and receive help from neighbours was used to measure personal sense of trust. Demographic factors were controlled for. The data were analyzed using descriptive and multivariate regressions. Results The mean level of psychological distress among the residents was 25.5 (SD 5.5). Personal sense of trust was 8.2 (SD 2.0), and that of community sense of trust was 7.5 (SD 2.8). While community level trust was not significant, personal sense of trust significantly reduced psychological distress (B = -.2016728, t = -2.59, p < 0.010). The other factors associated with psychological distress in this model were perceived economic standing, education and locality of residence. Conclusion This study presents evidence that more trusting individuals are significantly less likely to be psychologically distressed within deprived urban communities in Accra. Positive intra and inter individual level variables such as personal level trust and perceived relative economic standing significantly attenuated the effect of psychological distress in communities with high level neighbourhood disorder in Accra."

To gain a deeper insight in the immune tolerance mechanisms in mice immunized with Eg10 and Eg mMDH, this study simulated the immune tolerance process in vitro by culturing bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) in the presence of Eg10 or Eg mMDH. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that Eg10- and Eg mMDH-treated DCs exhibited immature cell morphology, while addition of LPS to the cells induced changes in cell morphology and an increase in the number of cell-surface protrusions. This observation was consistent with the increased expression of the cell-surface molecules MHCII and CD80 in Eg10- and Eg mMDH-treated DCs pretreated with LPS. DCs exposed to the two antigens had a very weak ability to induce T-cell proliferation, but could promote the formation of Treg cells. Introduction of the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitor, 1-methyl tryptopha (1-MT) enhanced the ability of the antigens to induce T cells and inhibited the induction of Treg cells. Eg mMDH-treated DCs showed a strong response to 1-MT: the DCs had high mRNA levels of IDO, IL-6, and IL-10, while 1-MT decreased the expression. In contrast, DCs treated with Eg10 did not show significant changes after 1-MT treatment. Eg mMDH inhibited DC maturation and promoted IDO expression, which, on the one hand, decreased the ability of DCs to induce T-cell proliferation, resulting in T-cell anergy, and on the other hand, induced the formation of Tregs, resulting in an immunosuppressive effect. In contrast, the escape mechanisms induced by Eg10 did not primarily depend on the IDO pathway and might involve other mechanisms that need to be further explored."
https://openalex.org/W2893130606,"Weed control is a substantial challenge in field management. A better weed control method at an earlier growth stage is important for increasing yields. As a promising weed control technique, intelligent weeding based on machine vision can avoid the harm of chemical weeding. For machine vision, it is critical to extract and segment crops from their background. However, there is still no optimal solution for object tracking with occlusion under a similar color background. In this study, it was found that the gray distribution of a maize canopy follows the gradient law. Therefore, the recognition method based on the HLS-SVM (HLS color space and Support Vector Machine) and on the grayscale gradient was developed. First, the HLS color space was used to detect the maize canopy. Second, the SVM method was used to segment the central region of the maize canopy. Finally, the maize canopy center was identified according to the gradient law. The results showed that the average segmentation time was 0.49 s, the average segmentation quality was 87.25%, and the standard deviation of the segmentation was 3.57%. The average recognition rate of the center position was 93.33%. This study provided a machine vision method for intelligent weeding agricultural equipment as well as a theoretical reference for further agricultural machine vision research."
https://openalex.org/W2893143716,"The rising incidence of Non Melanoma Skin Cancers (NMSC) leads to a high number of surgical procedures worldwide. The strict compliance with international guidelines with regard to excisional margins may help decrease the number of re-excision procedures and reduce the risk of NMSC recurrence. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of excisional margins as recommended by the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) and the European Dermatology Forum (EDF) guidelines, and the factors (demographic or clinical) that influence surgeons’ compliance with these guidelines.This was a prevalence study looking at surgical excisions of NMSCs performed over a period of 2 years (2011–2012). A sample size of 1669 patients was considered. Definition of excisional margins recommended by the international guidelines (EADV and EDF) were used as point of reference for the analysis. Tumor and histologic specimen size were calculated ex vivo by 5 different pathologists. The size of skin specimens was measured with a major axis and a minor axis. The same was done for the tumor present on the skin specimens. The differences between the major and minor axes of surgical specimen and tumor were calculated. These differences were subsequently divided by two, hypothesizing that the lesion had the same distance from the margins of the surgical specimen. The differences obtained were named “Delta”, the formulas applied being the following:Delta major = (major axis specimen—major axis tumor)/2; Delta minor = (minor axis specimen—minor axis tumor)/2.Results show a significant statistical difference, associated with factors such as: age of the patient, anatomical localization of the tumor, histological diagnosis, and surgeons’ experience.The identification of these factors sheds light on clinicians’ practice and decision-making regarding excisional margins. Hopefully a higher level of adherence to the guidelines can be achieved in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2893627663,"Reovirus infection induces dramatic changes in host mRNA expression. We utilized oligonucleotide microarrays to measure cellular mRNA decay rates in mock- or reovirus-infected murine L929 cells to determine if changes in host mRNA expression are a consequence of reovirus-induced alterations in cellular mRNA stability. Our analysis detected a subset of cellular transcripts that were coordinately induced and stabilized following infection with the reovirus isolates c87 and c8, strains that led to an inhibition of cellular translation, but not following infection with Dearing, a reovirus isolate that did not negatively impact cellular translation. The induced and stabilized transcripts encode multiple regulators of TGF- β signaling, including components of the Smad signaling network and apoptosis/survival pathways. The coordinate induction, through mRNA stabilization, of multiple genes that encode components of TGF-β signaling pathways represents a novel mechanism by which the host cell responds to reovirus infection."
https://openalex.org/W2892913674,"Pastures are strongly affected by local environmental variables in terms of their species richness, plant composition and herbage production. A multi-site monitoring study was conducted over three years to investigate the influence of morphoclimatic factors on the seasonal variations in dry matter (DM) yield from Karst pastures. Seven sites located on the Italian and Slovenian Karst regions were investigated that differed in terms of their geological and geomorphological features, as well as their soil types. At each site, the daily DM yield (kg ha-1 d-1) was determined using Corral-Fenlon method which permits to simulate herbage utilization from grazing herds. The morphoclimatic features were also analysed, with the aim to evaluate the link between seasonal DM yield and geomorphological and environmental factors. Generalized non-linear mixed models were built to study the observed seasonal variations in DM yield, using day of the year (DOY), growing degree days (GDD), and cumulative rainfall. Furthermore, environmental descriptors were included in the model in order to evaluate their effects on DM yield. The seasonal variations in yield showed two growing periods (spring and late summer), which were described by Gaussian curves. For the spring growing period, the model improved when the interaction between soil granulometry and growing degree days corresponding to the curve peak was taken into account. This confirms the influence of soil type and air temperature on pasture yield. For the late summer growing period, the interaction between the sand classes and the number of rainy days from the beginning of the period to the peak of the curve improved the model. The curve parameters of our models are correlated with environmental descriptors depending on the lithology and particle size of soils. The results are essential for the optimization of pasture management and avoiding degradation due to over- or under-grazing."
https://openalex.org/W2892568833,"Penile implants or nodules are objects inserted beneath the skin of the penis mostly for erotic purposes. The procedure is painful and there may be complications. It is often associated with prison. Our objectives were to describe the prevalence of penile nodules among inmates in French Guiana, and to study factors associated with this practice, notably psychiatric diagnoses.The study was cross-sectional. All consenting new adult prisoners incarcerated between 01/01/2014 and 31/12/2014 at the penitentiary centre of French Guiana were included. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was used to screen for psychiatric diagnoses.Of 492, 29.6% declared having penile nodules. The median number was 4 (IQR = 2-7). The number of nodules correlated with age. There was no statistical link between the presence of penile nodules and the reasonforincarceration. Multivariate analysis showed that persons <45years with prior incarcerations, with substance addiction, and those with a history of death in the family were more likely to have penile nodules. Those with psychosis and those with suicidal risk were less likely to have penile nodules. Prisoners speaking English or Maroon languages seemed more likely to have penile implants in the multivariate model.Overall, 29.6% of arriving inmates had penile nodules. The practice was linked to drug addiction and was less frequent among those with psychosis and suicidal risk. Given the high HIV prevalence in prison, penile nodule may be an obstacle to condom-based prevention."
