https://openalex.org/W2009315890,"Polyadenylylated [poly(A)+] mRNA from HeLa cells that were labeled with [3H-methyl]-methionine and 14C-uridine was isolated by poly(U)-Sepharose chromatography. The presence of approximately two methyl groups per 1000 nucleotides of poly(A)+ RNA was calculated from the 3H/14C ratios and known degrees of methylation of 18S and 28S ribosomal RNAs. All four 2'-O-methylribonucleosides, but only two base-methylated derivatives, 7-methylguanosine (7MeG) and 6-methyladenosine (6MeA), were identified. 6MeA was the major component accounting for approximately 50% of the total methyl-labeled ribonucleosides. 7MeG, comprising about 10% of the total, was present exclusively at the 5' terminus of the poly(A)+ RNA and could be removed by periodate oxidation and beta elimination. Evidence for a 5' to 5' linkage of 7MeG to adjacent 2'-O-methylribonucleosides through at least two and probably three phosphates to give structures of the type 7MeG5'ppp5pNMep- and 7MeG5'ppp5'NMepNmep- was presented. The previous finding of similar sequences of methylated nucleotides in mRNA synthesized in vitro by enzymes associated with virus cores indicates that blocked 5' termini may be a characteristic feature of mRNAs that function in eucaryotic cells."

The Fe-enzyme was purified to near homogeneity. It contains 2 atoms of iron per mol. Its molecular weight is 41,700 and it is composed of two subunits of identical molecular weight without disulfide linkage. Amino acid composition is presented. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum revealed that iron occurs in a high spin ferric form and in some anisotropic environment. The absorption spectrum and the absence of acid-labile enzymes are insensitive to cyanide. Although the Fe-enzyme is sensitive to hydrogen peroxide, the Mn-enzyme is not."

Neutral glycosphingolipids of hamster fibroblast NIL cells have been characterized as follows: glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide (betaGall yields 4Glc yields Cer), a digalactosylceramide (alphaGall yields 4betaGal yields Cer), a trihexosylceramide (alphaGall yields 4betaGall yields 4Glc yields Cer), two kinds of ceramide tetrasaccharides (A: alphaGa1NAcl yields 3betaGalNAcl yields 3alphaGall yields 4betaGall yields 1Cer, a new type of Forssman active glycolipid; B: globoside, betaGalNAcl yields 3alphaGall yields 4betaGall yields 4betaGlc yields Cer), and a ceramide pentasaccharide having a classical structure for Forssman antigen (alphaGalNAcl yields 3betaGalNAcl yields 3alphaGall yields 4betaGall yields 4Glc yields Cer). 2. Neutral glycosphingolipids of polyoma virus-transformed NIL cells (NILpy) have been characterized as having an additional ceramide tetrasaccharide which was absent in normal NIL cells. The structure of this specific glycolipid was identified as lacto-N-neotetraosylceramide (betaGall yields 4betaGlc-NAcl yields 3betaGall yields 4Glc yields Cer). Chemical quantities of ceramide tetra- and pentasaccharides in NILpy cells were much lower than in NIL cells. 3. All of these glycolipids, except glucosylceramide and lactosylceramide, were labeled externally by galactose oxidase and tritiated borohydride according to the method previously described (GAHMBERG, C. G, and HAKOMORI, S. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 4311-4317). The specific activities of the label in glycolipid of NIHpy cells were much greater than that in NIL cells, i.e. reactivity of glycolipids with galactose oxidase in NIHpy cells was much higher than for NIL cells. The surface label in glycolipids was cell cycle-dependent in NIL cells, and a remarkable exposure of a galactosyl residue of a ceramide tetrasaccharide was demonstrated only on the surface of NILpy cells, due to the presence of lacto-N-neotetraosylceramide."
https://openalex.org/W2016841647,"In extracts from rat and calf uterus, the steroid hormone 17 beta-estradiol stimulates the binding of its specific receptor protein to DNA. This interaction appears to be of low affinity (half of the estradiol-activated, 5S receptor bound at 300-400 mug/ml DNA) and nonspecific with respect to DNA base sequence. No binding to double-stranded RNA is observed. These findings are consistent with several in vivo observations. In particular, when the cytoplasmic receptor protein binds hormone, it migrates to the cell nucleus to an extent consistent with its affinity for DNA in vitro, and this in vivo nuclear binding is uniform and nonsaturable in the testable range (to greater than 3 times 10-4 sites per cell). The level of biological response appears to parallel the hormone dose up to these high levels of receptor binding. How are these observations to be reconciled with the prevalent view of steroid receptors as gene control proteins regulating transcription at specific loci on the genome? Our model is based on an analogy with the DNA binding properties of the E. coli lac repressor protein. We believe that the estradiol receptor exerts its effect by binding to a small number of high affinity sites on the genome, while also having a finite low affinity for nonspecific DNA sequences. These nonspecific loci, because of their vast number, completely mask the presence of the high affinity sites. We estimate that up to 10-3 specific sites, with affinities in the range 10- minus 8 minus 10- minus 10 M, could exist without being detected by bulk binding assays currently in use. However, alternative approaches should allow detection of these sites, and some of these are suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1547304505,"In fat cells isolated from the parametrial adipose tissue of rats, the addition of purified adenosine deaminase increased lipolysis and cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) accumulation. Adenosine deaminase markedly potentiated cyclic AMP accumulation due to norepinephrine. The increase in cyclic AMP due to adenosine deaminase was as rapid as that of theophylline with near maximal effects seen after only a 20-sec incubation. The increases in cyclic AMP due to crystalline adenosine deaminase from intestinal mucosa were seen at concentrations as low as 0.05 mug per ml. Further purification of the crystalline enzyme preparation by Sephadex G-100 chromatography increased both adenosine deaminase activity and cyclic AMP accumulation by fat cells. The effects of adenosine deaminase on fat cell metabolism were reversed by the addition of low concentrations of N6-(phenylisopropyl)adenosine, an analog of adenosine which is not deaminated. The effects of adenosine deaminase on cyclic AMP accumulation were blocked by coformycin which is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme. These findings suggest that deamination of adenosine is responsible for the observed effects of adenosine deaminase preparations. Protein kinase activity of fat cell homogenates was unaffected by adenosine or N6-(phenylisopropyl)adenosine. Norepinephrine-activated adenylate cyclase activity of fat cell ghosts was not inhibited by N6-(phenylisopropyl)adenosine. Adenosine deaminase did not alter basal or norepinephrine-activated adenylate cyclase activity. Cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activity of fat cell ghosts was also unaffected by adenosine deaminase. Basal and insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation were little affected by adenosine deaminase. However, the addition of adenosine deaminase to fat cells incubated with 1.5 muM norepinephrine abolished the antilipolytic action of insulin and markedly reduced the increase in glucose oxidation due to insulin. These effects were reversed by N6-(phenylisopropyl)adenosine. Phenylisopropyl adenosine did not affect insulin action during a 1-hour incubation. If fat cells were incubated for 2 hours with phenylisopropyl adenosine prior to the addition of insulin for 1 hour there was a marked potentiation of insulin action. The potentiation of insulin action by prior incubation with phenylisopropyl adenosine was not unique as prostaglandin E1, and nicotinic acid had similar effects."

https://openalex.org/W1528309894,"The possibility that hormones control hepatic gluconeogenesis via the regulation of the rate of mitochondrial pyruvate carboxylation was investigated with the use of suspensions of liver cells isolated from fasted rats. The mitochondria prepared from liver cells were judged in good condition as they exhibited satisfactory phosphorus-oxygen and respiratory control ratios and transported Ca2+ and K+ ions in an energy-dependent manner. Addition of glucagon, epinephrine, or cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate to liver cells caused a 50 to 80% increase in the rate of glucose synthesis from lactate. When mitochondria were isolated from the cells after treatment with these agonists, they displayed 2- to 3-fold increases in the rate of pyruvate carboxylation, pyruvate decarboxylation, and pyruvate uptake. These mitochondrial changes are similar to those obtained in hepatic mitochondria prepared from intact, hormone-treated rats. The mitochondrial responses were specific for agents that stimulated gluconeogenesis; no response occurred with 5'-AMP or cyclic adenosine 2':3'-monophosphate. In the cell suspensions, the dose response curves for the activation of mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism and for increased glucose synthesis from L-lactate were coincident with four different agonists. The mitochondrial changes resulting from stimulation with glucagon developed in 1 to 2 min after the rise in cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate and occurred at least as early as the increase in the rate of gluconeogenesis. When the intracellular level of cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate returned to basal values, the rates of mitochondrial pyruvate carboxylation and glucose synthesis also declined to control levels. It is concluded that the rate of mitochondrial pyruvate metabolisms can be increased by hormones and cyclic nucleotides and that control of mitochondrial pyruvate carboxylation is an important regulatory site of hepatic gluconeogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1485064320,"Evidence is presented that modulation of the maximum velocity of a particulate low K-m cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) phosphodiesterase by thyroid hormones is one mechanism for the regulation of the responsiveness of rat epididymal adipocytes to lipolytic agents such as epinephrine and glucagon. Fat cells of propylthiouracil-induced hypothyroid rats are unresponsive to lipolytic agents and the V-max of particulate low K-m cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase of these cells is elevated above normal. In vivo treatment of hypothyroid rats with triiodothyronine restores to control values both the lipolytic response of the fat cells to epinephrine and the V-max of the particulate bound low K-m cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase. No similar correlation is found with the soluble high K-m cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase. The phosphodiesterases of fat cells from normal and hypothyroid rats respond identically in vitro to propylthiouracil, triiodothyronine, methylisobutylxanthine, or theophylline, although the particulate low K-m cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase is inhibited to a greater extent than soluble cyclic guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate phosphodiesterase activity. Protein kinase of fat cells from hypothyroid rats can be stimulated by cyclic AMP to the same total activity as observed in fat cells of normal rats. However, less of the protein kinase in fat cells from hypothyroid rats was in the cyclic AMP-independent form. This shift in the equilibrium of protein kinase forms is consistent with an increased activity of low K-m cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase and probably results from a lowering of the lipolytically significant pool of cyclic AMP."
https://openalex.org/W1543992215,"Apolipoprotein glutamine I (apoLP-Gln-I or apoA-I) is the major protein constituent of the human plasma high density lipoproteins. Cleavage of this protein with cyanogen bromide yields four fragments, designated in the order of elution from Bio-Gel P-30 as CNBr I, II, III, and IV. In the first paper in this series, the amino acid sequence of the NH2-terminal fragment, CNBr II, is reported. In the present study, CNBr IV, III, and I, containing, respectively, 25, 36, and 94 amino acids were sequenced by conventional means. To establish the alignment of the cyanogen bromide fragments, apoLP-Gln-I was digested with trypsin and two of the three methionine-containing tryptic peptides were isolated. The amino acid sequence of apoLP-Gln-I is as follows: (see article). With the complete amino acid sequence available, a CPK space-filling model of apoLP-Gln-I was constructed. The protein was placed into an alpha helical conformation wherever the primary structure permitted. Thirteen helical regions were identified. These regions account for 70% of the amino acid residues of the protein. Each helix is characterized as having two faces (amphipathic). One is a polar face that occupies approximately 180 degrees of the surface of the helix and the other is a hydrophobic face that occupies the other 180 degrees of the helical surface. Similar amphipathic helices have been identified previously in the other lipoprotein-proteins that have known sequences. It is suggested that the amphipathic helical regions of apoLP-Gln-I are important in the binding of phospholipids in high density lipoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1484217413,"Three spin-labeled derivatives of stearic acid and two derivatives of palmitic acid have been used to study the structure of the strong fatty acid binding site of bovine serum albumin. The steroid and indole binding sites have been studied using spin-labeled derivatives of androstol and indole, respectively. Paramagnetic resonance and fluorescence quenching data suggest that the fatty acid, steroid, and indole binding sites may be identical. The mobility of the nitroxyl group at C-8 of palmitic acid bound to albumin at a 1:1 molar ratio is unaffected when the carboxyl group is esterified. When the nitroxyl group is located at C-5 on this acid its motion is detectably increased by esterification of the carboxyl group but the magnitude of this change is small. This result suggests that the carboxyl group may play a minor role in the binding of fatty acids to the strongest fatty acid binding site of albumin. When stearic acid derivatives bearing the nitroxide at C-5, C-12, and C-16 are bound to albumin at a ligand to albumin ratio of 1, the order of mobility at 0-30 degrees is C-16 greater than C-12 congruent to C-5. Although motion at the methyl terminus is always greater than at the COOH terminus in the range 0-60 degrees, a simple monotonic increase in chain motion between the two termini is not observed. Arrhenius plots of the motion parameters for these bound fatty acids show two abrupt changes in slope. The temperature ranges for these changes are 15-23 degrees and 38-45 degrees. These results suggest that when one mole of spin-labeled fatty acid is bound to albumin, the protein undergoes a conformational change in each of these temperature ranges."
https://openalex.org/W2000379892,Large adipocytes from obese subjects have similar receptor numbers and affinities for insulin as small adipocytes from subjects of normal weight. These results indicate that the insulin insensitivity of large fat cells from obese humans occurs after the insulin-receptor interaction and might be explained by either a dilution of receptors over the cell surface or by alterations in intracellular metabolism.
https://openalex.org/W1502699506,"In conditions of glucose starvation, the maximum velocity of the mediated transport of nonmetabolized and metabolized amino acids, uridine, adenosine, and sucrose across the plasma membrane is stimulated by a factor of two by the addition of 1 mM adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate to Schizosaccharomyces pombe 972h- wild strain, to the glucose-super-repressed and derepressed mutants COB5 and COB6, and to Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain IL 216-IA. The mediated uptake of 2-D-deoxyglucose and the apparently nonmediated uptake of guanosine are not stimulated by the cyclic nucleotide. N6,O2'-Dibutyryl adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate is also efficient, whereas theophylline, guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate, 5'-AMP, ATP, and adenosine are ineffective. The cellular ATP content of glycerol-grown S. pombe COB5 is about 10 nmol per mg of protein and is not decreased by further incubation in the starvation medium. The addition of 100 mM glucose markedly enhances transport without any increase of the cellular ATP content. The addition of antimycin A or Dio-9 decreases markedly both cellular ATP content and transport. The addition of 2.5 mM glucose to antimycin A-containing medium restores both transport is not necessarily of mitochondrial origin. The uptake of 2-D-deoxyglucose is unaffected by the respiratory inhibitors. Stimulation of uptake by cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate occurs only in glucose-deprived cells. The addition of 10 mM glucose elicits the disappearance of the stimulation and prevents the 30% decrease of the cellular adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate content produced by glucose starvation. Adenosine 3':5'-'monophosphate does not enhance the steady state ATP level but requires cellular ATP produced either by endogenous respiration or, in the absence of respiration blocked by antimycin A, by further addition of 2.5 mM glucose. Stimulation of active uptake by adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate does not require protein synthesis because the addition of cycloheximide or anisomycin does not prevent the stimulation of L-leucine uptake. In the absence of respiration, Dio-9, and ATPase inhibitor, suppresses instantaneously the cellular ejection of protons as well as the uptake of uridine and amino acids. It abolishes also the adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate-stimulated transport. In the presence of antimycin A, specific mitochondrial ATPase inhibitors such as venruricidin A do not inhibit metabolite uptakes and their stimulation by adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate. These results suggest that in these conditions, the target of Dio-9 is not the mitochondrial ATPase but a plasma membrane proton-translocating function generating an electrochemical gradient required for active transport. That adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate enhances the Dio-9-sensitive proton extrusion supports the view that the cyclic nucleotide might modulate the plasma membrane ATPase."

https://openalex.org/W1497296083,"We have demonstrated that in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, N6,O2'-dibutyryl adenosine cyclic 3':5'-monophosphate (dibutyryl cyclic AMP) has a remarkable morphogenetic effect in converting cells of a compact, epithelial-like morphology into a spindle-shaped, fibroblast-like form. Homogenates of CHO cells were found to contain two adenosine cyclic 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) phosphodiesterase (EC 3.1.4.c) activities, which differ in apparent Km with respect to their substrate, cyclic AMP. These were designated cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase I, with a low Km of 2 to 5 muM and cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase II, with a high Km of 1 to 3 mM. Cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase I was competitively inhibited by N6-monobutyryl and dibutyryl cyclic AMP, with apparent Ki values of 40 to 60 muM and 0.25 to 0.35 mM, respectively. Experimental evidence demonstrates that the effect of exogenous dibutyryl cyclic AMP on cell morphology is a result of an increase in the endogenous level of cyclic AMP. This increase appears to be due largely to the inhibitory action of intracellular N6-monobutyryl cyclic AMP on cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase I, which results in a decreased rate of degradation of intracellular cyclic AMP."

Preliminary data, based on sequencing the peptide mixture released by collagenase treatment, suggested that, in contrast, 4-hydroxyproline occurs predominantly if not exclusively in the Y position of Gly-X-Y triplet sequences in the collagen preparation studied."

https://openalex.org/W1496413317,"The simultaneous binding of netropsin and actinomycin to four natural DNAs was studied to determine the influence of one ligand on the binding of the other. Actinomycin binds specifically to GC sites, whereas netropsin binds specifically to AT sites. Spectral titrations, thermal denaturation, and analytical buoyant density centrifugation were employed to measure the binding interference of these drugs. The binding of actinomycin to DNA was decreased by the presence of netropsin. Increasing the GC content of the DNA resulted in a decreased effect of netropsin on actinomycin binding. Quantitative analysis of the binding parameters indicated that netropsin and actinomycin can bind in close proximity along the DNA chain. Supercoiled DNA gave the same result as linear DNA. These results imply that DNA can absorb alterations in conformation within a short distance."

(1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 5164-5174). The rate constant of unfolding of unliganded Nuclease-T' was 4.6 times 10-4s-1. Those of Nuclease-T' bound with pdTp, with Ca2+, and with both pdtp and Ca2+ were 9.0 times 10-5, 1.6 times 10-4, and 2.2 times 10-5s-1, respectively. The association constants of pdTp and Ca2+ with Nuclease-T' were found to be 1.0 times 10-4 and 2.0 times 10-2 m-1, respectively. Those of pdTp with Nuclease-T' plus Ca2+ and of Ca2+ with Nuclease-T' plus pdTp were 4 times 10-5 and 1.4 times 10-4M-1, respectively. The calculation of free energy change on the basis of the association constants shows that the magnitude of negative free energy change involved in the binding of either of the two ligands increases by approximately 2 kcal when the other ligand is already bound. There is a correlation between the free energy change and the specifically coupled with the cooperative interacions operating throught the three-dimensional structure resulting in strengthening of the interactions throughtout the structure, including those with the ligands, without a large change in conformation."

https://openalex.org/W1549313775,"Cellular protein binding of a number of androstene and androstane derivatives that promote the growth of the vagina in rats has been studied. It was found that cell nuclei of the rat vagina contain a tissue-specific protein that binds 3beta,17beta-dihydroxy-androst-5-ene (delta5-androstenediol), a unique steroid causing growth and keratinization of the vaginal epithelium. The formation of the steroid-protein complex can be demonstrated by the administration of delta5-[3H]androstenediol to ovariectomized rats or by the incubation of minced vagina with the radioactive steroid. The steroid can interact with purified vaginal cell nuclei even in the absence of a cytosol preparation, forming the same steroid-protein complex. The formation of the complex is temperature-dependent; it occurs much more readily at 37 degrees than at 0 degrees. The delta5-[3H]androstenediol-protein complex migrated as about 4 S in a sucrose gradient medium containing 0.4 M KCl. A similar complex can be detected when nuclei of vaginal cells are incubated with 3alpha,17beta-dihydroxy-5alpha-androstane, 3beta,17beta-dihydroxy-5alpha-androstane, and 3beta-hydroxy-androst-5-en-17-one which also have the capability of stimulating vaginal epithelium, although in somewhat different ways. These steroids may bind to different groups of chromatin-bound receptor proteins in various layers of vaginal epithelium.

https://openalex.org/W1573650684,"In the absence of salt the cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptor of fetal rabbit lung sediments at 7 S while the nuclear receptor sediments at 4 S. However, if nuclear extracts are mixed with receptor-depleted cytosol preparations in dilute buffer solutions without added salt, the nuclear 4 S receptor sediments as a 7 S species similar to that observed for the cytoplasmic form under the same conditions suggesting an interaction of the nuclear receptor with other cytosol proteins rather than with itself. In addition, both cytoplasmic and nuclear receptors sediment at 4 S in 0.4 M KCl and a major fraction of the nuclear receptor has an agarose elution profile identical to that of the cytoplasmic receptor. Thus a major fraction of the nuclear receptors is indistinguishable from the cytoplasmic receptors by the methods used. Since the cytoplasmic receptor sediments at 4 S in 0.15 M KCl, it is suggested that in vivo the glucocorticoid receptor may exist as a 4 S species and that the 7 S form described previously may result from an interaction of the 4 S component with other cytosol proteins in hypotonic media. About 25% of the receptor present in nuclear extracts has an agarose elution profile different from that of the cytoplasmic receptor in 0.4 M KCl. This suggests that either the nuclear receptor associates with itself or other nuclear proteins or that more than one form of nuclear receptor exists. Earlier observations suggested that in the absence of hormone the glucocorticoid receptor is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm of lung cells and that the nuclear receptor is formed by a transfer of the cytoplasmic steroid-receptor complex into the nucleus. A prerequisite for this transfer seems to be a modification of the receptor to an active form which can bind to nuclei. This receptor transfomration, referred to in this paper as activation of the receptor, can occur in the absence of nuclei and is highly dependent on temperature and ionic strength. Cytoplasmic receptors activated either by heating or by exposure to high ionic strength are indistinguishable from nonactivated receptors by sucrose density gradient analysis or by agarose gel filtration in solutions containing 0.4 M KCl. Simiarly, no significant difference in the absence of salt is observed after activation by heating. These results suggest that activation of the cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptor involves conformational changes which favor its transfer and/or binding to nuclear sites rather than conversion of a 4 S species to a faster-sedimenting form by dimerization or by addition of another protein unit as has been proposed for the activation of the estrogen receptor of the rat uterus."

The latter effect on cellular RNA produced by papavarine occurred within 1 hour after its addition to the medium and was associated with impaired uptake of radioactive precursor into uridine nucleotides and reduction in the intracellular concentration of uridine 5'-triphosphate (UTP). Dibutytyl-cAMP produced a decreased in the specific radioactivity of UTP without affecting the concentration of UTP in the tumor cells. The effects of papavarine and dibutyryl-cAMP could be distinguished further by the 50% reduction of acetylcholinesterase activity produced by papavarine, but not by dibutyryl-cAMP. Papavarine did not, however, reduce the cellular level of the soluble enzyme, adenine phosphoribosyltransferase. Sodium butyrate, while producing morphological effects similar to those of papavarine and dibutyryl-cAMP at equimolar concentrations, caused no significant changes in the incorporation of [5-3H]uridine into rRNA and HnRNA; however, acetylcholinesterase activity was stimulated 6- to 7-fold above control levels. In contrast to the other differentiating agents examined, addition of 10-9 to 3 times 10-4 M concentrations of cAMP to the tissue culture medium enhanced morphological differentiation of nueroblastoma cells, and caused a 10- to 20-fold stimulation of the incorporation of [5-3H]uridine into rRNA and HnRNA at concentrations of 10-4 M and higher. This effect observed only at high concentrations of cyclic nucleotide was accompanied by an elevation in the specific acitivty of UTP, These studies suggest that the morphological response of neuroblastoma cells is not necessarily associated with concomitant alterations in the synthesis of RNA with agents other than cAMP. Observed changes in incorporation of [5-3H]uridine into RNA appear in most instances to be due to alterations in the uptake of uridine, and in the pool size and specific radioactivity of UTP."
https://openalex.org/W2003002049,"We have isolated temperature-sensitive SV40-transformed 3T3 cells which are unable to grow in low or depleted serum at the nonpermissive temperature. At 39 degrees C, these cells do not grow in 1 percent serum, but they grow if the serum concentration is raised to 10 percent. At 32 degrees they grow in both serum concentrations. This phenotype seems to be due to a cellular mutation, as the virus rescued from these cells is wild-type. We tested whether other characteristics of transformed cells were expressed in a temperature sensitive way. While high saturation density is ts in these cells, other parameters of transformation are expressed at both temperatures. In addition, when these cells are incubated in low serum at 39 degrees C, they keep synthesizing DNA and lose viability very fast, while under the same conditions normal 3T3 cells remain viable for long times and are unable to initiate DNA synthesis. These cells therefore do not appear to revert to a normal phenotype at the high temperature, and they are more likely to represent transformed cell variants with a temperature-dependent serum requirement."
https://openalex.org/W1484066661,"After exposure of fetal rabbit lungs to glucocorticoid in vivo or in vitro, the hormone binds to specific receptors localized in the cytoplasm and in the nuclei. The present studies are compatible with a mechanism by which the nuclear receptor originates from the cytoplasm and arises from a hormone-, temperature-, and ionic strength-dependent transfer of the cytoplasmic receptor into the nucleus. This conclusion is reached from the following observations. Specific binding of glucocorticoid to nuclei from lungs not previously exposed to the hormone is not observed unless the cytosol is also present. In the presence of cytosol, nuclear uptake of the hormone is very slow at 0 degrees but is highly enhanced with increasing temperature. Concomitantly with the increased nuclear uptake there is an equiivalent loss of glucocortoid-receptor complex from the cytosol, indicating that the complex is transferred to the nuclei by a temperature-dependent process. Although the nuclei do not bind the cytoplasmic complex at 0 degrees, they do so provided that the cytosol is briefly heated in the presence of hormone prior to mixing with the nuclei. Thus the cytoplasmic complex must first be activated before it can bind to nuclei.."
https://openalex.org/W1566008227,"Following injection of rabbit 125I-asialohemopexin, more than 90% of the protein-bound 125I was removed from the circulation of rabbits within 12 min. The amount of asialoprotein in the catabolic compartment reached a peak concentration (75 to 85%) 12 min after injection and was completely eliminated from this compartment within 2 hours. The degradation products were excreted into the urine, with 50 to 70% of the 125I eliminated during the first 24 hours and 90 to 95% excreted by 48 hours. Analysis of these data indicated an apparent first order rate constant for uptake of asialohemopexin of 0.32 min-1, for catabolism of 0.020 min-1 and for excretion of 0.054 to 0.093 hour-1. The plasma distribution curves of 125I-hemopexin, after the first 24 hours, showed essentially no difference. Both proteins were catabolized with an average T1/2 of 25 to 26 hours and a similar fractional catabolic rate. Simultaneous injection of heme and 125I-hemopexin resulted in rapid removal and catabolism of the protein. In contrast, injection of heme had little if any effect on the plasma radioactivity curve of photoinactivated 125I-hemopexin."
https://openalex.org/W1520821251,"The kinetics for inactivation of rat liver plasma membrane adenylate cyclase by iodoacetic acid and iodoacetamide has been measured in the presence and absence of glucagon. Glucagon stimulated the rate of iodoacetic acid inhibition by a factor 9f 2.3-fold and iodoacetamide inhibition by 10-fold. These results suggest that interaction of glucagon with its receptor in the membrane resulted in conformational changes which increased either the exposure or nucleophilicity of one or more sulfhydryl groups crucial for adenylate cyclase activity. Membranes were treated with radioactively labeled iodoacetamide or iodoacetic acid in the presence or absence of glucagon and run on 5 and 7.5% sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gels. These labeling experiments revealed that two membrane components were more extensively labeled in the presence of glucagon. The first component had an apparent molecular weight of 240,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels and stained positive with Coomassie blue and periodate Schiff reagent. This polypeptide accounted for approximately 1.3% of the total membrane protein. The second component had an apparent molecular weight less than 10,000 and could not be correlated directly with a well defined protein band on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels. The enhancement in labeling of the 240,000 molecular weight component seen in the presence of glucagon agreed very well with that predicted from the kinetics for inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity in the presence and absence of glucagon. This correlation suggests that the component selectively labeled by this technique may be an integral component of the adenylate cyclase system and that hormone-induced conformational changes may be used to selectively label components of the adenylate cyclase system in mammalian membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1590913540,"X-ray diffraction studies have shown that hemoglobin has two predominant interfaces in the tetramer at which dissociation to dimers could occur. These interfaces have been designed as alpha1-beta1 and alpha1-beta2. There are 2 tyrosyl residues and 1 tryptophanyl residue in the alpha1-beta2- interface but only 1 tyrosyl residue in the alpha1-beta1 interface exposed to the solvent are perturbed. The ultraviolet difference spectrum between ferrihemoglobin dissociated in 1 M NaClO4 and undissociated hemoglobin revealed two negative peaks, one at 292.5 nm and another at 285 nm. This difference spectrum is due to tyrosyl and tryptophanyl residues which reside on the plane of cleavage and were exposed to 1 M NaClO4 upon dissociation. Hence, dissociation must have occurred along the alpha1-beta2 interface to yield alpha1 beta1 dimers. The deltaF degrees value extrapolated to zero salt concentration calculated on the basis of difference spectroscopy and sedimentation velocity experiments is 8.6 plus or minus 0.7 kcal per mol at pH 7.1 (K equals 4.5 times 10-7."
https://openalex.org/W1673503389,"The mechanism of inhibition of GMP synthetase by purine and purine-analog nucleosides was investigated. It was found that in addition to allowing the nucleoside to bind to the enzyme (Udaka, S., and Moyed, H. S. (1963) J. Biol. Chem. 238, 2797)PPi was also a competitive inhibitor with respect to ATP. A rate equation was derived to describe this inhibitory model for two competitive inhibitors where the binding of one inhibitor is contingent upon the binding of the other. The inhibition constants for a large number of nucleosides were then determined. It was found that the initial enzyme-inhibitor complex (of all nucleoside inhibitors) was slowly (0.2 min-1) transformed into a secondary (nondissociating) complex. The two inhibitory complexes appeared to exist in equilibrium. While decoyenine, N6-allyladenosine, and adenosine had similar inhibition constants for the initial complex (0.7 to 1.0 muM), their apparent inhibition constants for the secondary complex were 0.004, 0.06, and 0.5 muM respectively. These differences in the apparent dissociation constants from the secondary complexes are due to different equilibria between the initial and the secondary complexes. The ratios of the secondary complex to the initial complex at equilibrium were 3,250, 290, and 11 for decovenine, N6-allyladenosine, and adenosine, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1516454993,"A soluble NAD+-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase has been isolated from Crithidia fasciculata. The enzyme was purified 128-fold, almost to homogeneity, and was highly specific for NAD+ as the coenzyme. There is also a cytoplasmic NADP+-linked and a mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase in the organism. Studies of the physical and kinetic properties of the soluble NAD+-isocitrate dehydrogenase from this organism showed that it resembled microbial NADP+-isocitrate dehydrogenases in general, all of which are cytoplasmic enzymes. The enzyme appeared not to be related to other NAD+-isocitrate dehydrogenases, which are found in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells. The molecular weight of the soluble NAD+-isocitrate dehydrogenase was 105,000 which is within the range of the values for microbial NADP+-isocitrate dehydrogenases. Similar to the NADP+-isocitrate dehydrogenase in this organism, the enzyme was inhibited in a concerted manner by glyoxalate plus oxalacetate. Kinetic analysis revealed that Mn2+ was involved in the binding of isocitrate to the enzyme. Inhibition of the NAD+-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase by p-chloromercuribenzoate could be prevented by prior incubation of the enzyme with both Mn2+ and isocitrate; however, neither ion alone conferred protection. Free isocitrate, free Mn2+, and the Mn2+-isocitrate complex could all bind to the enzyme. Four different mechanisms with respect to the binding of isocitrate to the enzyme were tested. Of these, the formation of the active enzyme-Mn2+-isocitrate complex from (a) the random binding of Mn2+, isocitrate, and the Mn2+-isocitrate complex, or (b) the binding of Mn2+-isocitrate with free Mn2+ and isocitrate acting as dead-end competitors were both in agreement with these data."
https://openalex.org/W1643024,"Prostaglandin E1 (2.5 mug/ml) enhanced the level of cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) three to four times in Yoshida ascites sarcoma (YS) cells cultured in vitro. When Ricinus communis toxin (RC-toxin) was added 30 min after the addition of prostaglandin E1, the enhanced level of cyclic AMP in the YS cells decreased rapidly. Of RC-toxin, 0.2 mug/ml was enough to produce the maximum effect. By addition of 5 mM lactose with RC-toxin, approximately 60% of the RC-toxin effect on the levels of cyclic AMP was abolished. This indicates that the specific binding of RC-toxin on the surface membrane is largely responsible for the observed decrease of the cyclic AMP level. The toxin treatment did not induce either leakage of cyclic AMP from the cell or change in the activity of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase. However, the treatment of YS cells with RC-toxin caused a decrease of adenylate cyclase activity when the activity was measured at a substrate concentration of 0.15 mM ATP. In contrast, there was little difference with the control when the activity was assayed at a higher ATP concentration, 0.24 mM. It was found that the K-m of adenylate cyclase for ATP was changed by RC-toxin from 0.1 to 0.25 mM, and that the Mg2+ activation of the enzyme observable in untreated cells disappeared. These results suggested that the decrease in the level of cyclic AMP in YS cells induced by RC-toxin can be explained in terms of the change in K-m of the adenylate cyclase activity."
