It has been proposed that NAEs are biosynthesized from their corresponding N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs) in a single enzymatic step catalyzed by a phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD). The recent generation of NAPE-PLD(-/-) mice has revealed that these animals possess lower brain levels of saturated NAEs but essentially unchanged concentrations of polyunsaturated NAEs, including the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide. These findings suggest the existence of additional enzymatic routes for the production of NAEs in vivo. Here, we report evidence for an alternative pathway for NAE biosynthesis that proceeds through the serine hydrolase-catalyzed double-deacylation of NAPE to generate glycerophospho-NAE, followed by the phosphodiesterase-mediated cleavage of this intermediate to liberate NAE. Furthermore, we describe the functional proteomic isolation and identification of a heretofore uncharacterized enzyme α/β-hydrolase 4 (Abh4) as a lysophospholipase/phospholipase B that selectively hydrolyzes NAPEs and lysoNAPEs. Abh4 accepts lysoNAPEs bearing both saturated and polyunsaturated N-acyl chains as substrates and displays a distribution that closely mirrors lysoNAPE-lipase activity in mouse tissues. These results support the existence of an NAPE-PLD-independent route for NAE biosynthesis and suggest that Abh4 plays a role in this metabolic pathway by acting as a (lyso)NAPE-selective lipase.

The field of endocannabinoid research has experienced an explosive period of growth that began nearly two decades ago with the identification of a G-protein-coupled receptor specific for Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the active component of marijuana (1Matsuda L.A. Lolait S.J. Brownstein M.J. Young A.C. Bonner T.I. Nature. 1990; 346: 561-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (4215) Google Scholar).

Anandamide is part of a large family of amidated signaling lipids, the N-acyl ethanolamines (NAEs), that modulate distinct and diverse (patho)physiological processes, including nociception (3Calignano A.

Other key components in the endocannabinoid system have since been characterized, including additional cannabinoid receptors (e.g. CB2) (12Munro S. Thomas K.L. Abu-Shaar M.

Despite these advances in our understanding of the molecular composition of the endocannabinoid system, the enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of anand-amide and other bioactive NAEs have remained elusive. NAEs appear to be generated in vivo by the sequential action of a calcium-activated transacylase that transfers the sn-1 acyl group of phospholipids onto the primary amine of phosphatidylethanolamine to generate N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs), followed by the hydrolytic cleavage of NAPEs to generate NAEs (17Natarajan V. Reddy P.V. Schmid P.C. Schmid H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 712: 342-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It has been generally assumed that NAEs are produced from NAPEs in a single enzymatic step catalyzed by a type D phospholipase (see Fig. 1, reaction I) (18Schmid P.C. Reddy P.V. Natarajan V. Schmid H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9302-9306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Confidence in this mechanism was bolstered with the molecular characterization of a calcium-activated NAPE-specific phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD) (19Okamoto Y. Morishita J. Tsuboi K. Tonai T. Ueda N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5298-5305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). This NAPE-PLD, which is highly conserved in sequence from rodents to human and belongs to the metallo-lactamase family of enzymes, was shown to catalyze the formation of anandamide from its precursor C20:4-NAPE in vitro (19Okamoto Y. Morishita J. Tsuboi K. Tonai T. Ueda N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5298-5305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, targeted disruption of the NAPE-PLD gene produced a knock-out mouse strain with unaltered central nervous system (CNS) levels of anandamide and other polyunsaturated NAEs (20Leung D. Saghatelian A. Simon G.M. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4720-4726Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In contrast, the levels of long chain (C16-18) and very long chain (≥C20) saturated NAEs were moderately (∼1.5-fold) and more dramatically (>3-fold) reduced in CNS tissues from NAPE-PLD(-/-) mice, respectively. These results suggest the existence of multiple biosynthetic pathways for NAEs in vivo, with NAPE-PLD being principally responsible for generating very long chain saturated NAEs and other, as of yet, unidentified enzymes contributing to the production of long chain saturated and polyunsaturated NAEs. Consistent with this premise, tissues from NAPE-PLD(-/-) mice possessed a “residual” calcium-independent enzymatic activity that catalyzed the conversion of NAPEs to NAEs (20Leung D. Saghatelian A. Simon G.M. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4720-4726Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). When considering the potential enzymatic basis for the conversion of NAPEs to NAEs in NAPE-PLD(-/-) tissues, it is instructive to revisit previously proposed routes for this process. Studies by Schmid and co-workers (21Natarajan V. Schmid P.C. Reddy P.V. Schmid H.H. J. Neurochem. 1984; 42: 1613-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) in the 1980s provided in vitro biochemical evidence for enzymatic activities capable of producing NAEs from NAPEs via two- or three-step pathways involving the hydrolysis of one or both O-acyl chains from NAPEs (see Fig. 1, reactions II and III, respectively), followed by cleavage of the phosphodiester bond of the resulting N-acyl lysophosphatidylethanolamine (lysoNAPE) or glycerophospho (GP)-NAE, respectively (see Fig. 1, reactions IV and V). Previously, a secreted phospholipase A2 was shown to catalyze the hydrolysis of an O-acyl chain of NAPE to yield lysoNAPE in vitro; however, the restricted expression profile of this enzyme (predominantly expressed in stomach, pancreas, and small intestine) suggests the existence of additional enzymes responsible for the calcium-independent NAPE hydrolase activity detected in brains and testes of NAPE-PLD(-/-) mice (22Sun Y.X. Tsuboi K. Okamoto Y. Tonai T. Murakami M. Kudo I. Ueda N. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Here we report evidence that the NAPE-PLD-independent formation of NAEs in brain tissue involves the serine hydrolase-mediated cleavage of both O-acyl chains of NAPEs to give GP-NAEs, which are then converted to NAEs and glycerol-3-phosphate by a metal-dependent phosphodiesterase. Additionally, we describe the functional proteomic isolation and identification of a previously uncharacterized enzyme α/β-hydrolase 4 (Abh4) as a major lysoNAPE-lipase activity present in both the CNS and the peripheral tissues of mice. Materials—[1′-14C]Palmitic acid was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, 1-oleoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, 1-oleoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1-oleoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine, and 1,2-dioleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (di-ether phosphatidylethanolamine) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Methyl arachidonoyl fluorophosphonate (MAFP) was purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). HiTrap Q FF and HiTrap SP FF ion exchange columns and PD-10 desalting columns were purchased from GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ). 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho(N-[1′-14C]palmitoyl)ethanolamine, 1,2-dioleyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho(N-[1′-14C]palmitoyl)ethanolamine, 1-oleoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phospho (N-[1′-14C] palmitoyl)ethanolamine, and 1-oleoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phospho(N-acyl)ethanolamine with C16:0, C20:0, or C20:4 N-acyl chains were synthesized as described (19Okamoto Y. Morishita J. Tsuboi K. Tonai T. Ueda N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5298-5305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled substrates were purified by preparative TLC where necessary. 1,2-Dihydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phospho(N-[1′-14C] palmitoyl)ethanolamine (GP-NAE) was synthesized by base hydrolysis of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho(N-[1′-14C] palmitoyl)ethanolamine as described (20Leung D. Saghatelian A. Simon G.M. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4720-4726Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). LysoNAPE Lipase Enrichment and Identification—The soluble fraction from testis tissue of three wild type C57B1/6 mice was applied to a 1-ml HiTrap Q FF column (GE Healthcare) and eluted using a linear gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, and fractions were assayed for lysoNAPE-lipase activity via thin layer radiochromatography. Active fractions were pooled, concentrated, and desalted using a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare). Eluate was applied to a 1-ml HiTrap SP FF column (GE Healthcare) and eluted using the same gradient. Enriched fractions were pooled and analyzed by ABPP-MudPIT essentially as described (23Jessani N. Niessen S. Wei B.Q. Nicolau M. Humphrey M. Ji Y. Han W. Noh D.Y. Yates 3rd, J.R. Jeffrey S.S. Cravatt B.F. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Briefly, the samples were incubated with 5 μm FP-biotin probe (24Liu Y. Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14694-14699Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar), solublized with Triton X-100, and enriched using avidin-conjugated beads. The beads were thoroughly washed, and bound proteins were digested on-bead with trypsin. The peptides were analyzed by nano-electrospray ionization LC-MS/MS on an LTQ instrument (ThermoFinnigan), and active serine hydrolases were quantified by spectral counting (23Jessani N. Niessen S. Wei B.Q. Nicolau M. Humphrey M. Ji Y. Han W. Noh D.Y. Yates 3rd, J.R. Jeffrey S.S. Cravatt B.F. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Enzyme Assays—Enzyme assays were performed in 4-ml glass vials in 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, in a total volume of 100 μl using 1 mg/ml protein (0.5 mg/ml for LC-MS assays). The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min (1 h for LC-MS assays) with 100 μm synthetic substrate (5 μl of 2 mm stock in EtOH), with or without 2 mm EDTA. For MAFP experiments, the samples were pretreated with 5 μlof100 μm MAFP in Me2SO (final concentration, 5 μm) or Me2SO alone for 30 min at room temperature before the addition of substrate. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 1.5 ml of 2:1 CHCl3:MeOH and 0.4 ml of 50 mm Tris containing 1% formic acid, mixed and then centrifuged for 3 min at 1,400 × g to separate phases. The organic phase was extracted and concentrated to dryness under a stream of N2. For radiochromatographic assays, the dried reactions were dissolved in 20 μl of 2:1 CHCl3:MeOH, spotted on thin layer silica plates, and developed in CHCl3:MeOH:28% NH4OH at 40:10:1. Distribution of radioactivity on the plate was quantified by a phosphorimaging device (Packard), and products were identified by comparison with 14C-radiolabeled synthetic standards. Resulting product (NAE or GP-NAE) concentration was calculated from percentage values of the total radioactivity on the TLC plates. All of the radiochromatographic assays included heat-denatured controls, and these values were subtracted as background. For the analysis of the substrate selectivity of Abh4, nonradiolabeled substrates were used. The dried reactions were dissolved in 200 μl of 2:1 CHCl3: MeOH, and 50 μl were injected onto an Agilent 1100 series LC-MS. Oleic acid release was measured by comparison with a pentadecanoic acid standard. All of the assays were conducted with n ≥ 3, and the error bars represent the standard error of the mean. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 cells were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 to ∼70% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum in 15-cm dishes and transfected with 15 μg of plasmid DNA (or empty vector control) using the FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 48 h, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, resuspended in Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, and sonicated. The lysates were either used in assays as whole cell homogenates, or spun at 145,000 × g for 45 min to isolate the cytosolic fraction. Reverse Transcription-PCR—cDNA was prepared using the Superscript III reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR was performed using 27 cycles with cycling times of 15 s of melting at 95 °C, 30 s of annealing at 58 °C, and 45 s of extension at 72 °C with Taq DNA polymerase using the following primers: Abh4 oligonucleotides, 5′-GGAGCTGAAGATGAGTTTGTGGCC-3′ and 5′-CAACTGAGTTGCAGATCTCTTCTACCACAGC-3′; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase oligonucleotides, 5′-TGTCTTCACCACCATGGAGAAGGC-3′ and 5′-TGGCAGTGATGGCATGGAACTGTGG-3′. The products were visualized on a 2% agarose gel. A Biosynthetic Pathway for NAEs That Proceeds through a GP-NAE Intermediate—In addition to the direct NAPE-PLD-mediated biosynthetic pathway for the production of NAEs, it has also been suggested that phosphodiester cleavage is preceded by de-acylation of one or both of the O-acyl chains of NAPEs (Fig. 1, reactions II and III, respectively) (21Natarajan V. Schmid P.C. Reddy P.V. Schmid H.H. J. Neurochem. 1984; 42: 1613-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The enzymes involved in this putative O-deacylation-phosphodiesterase route for endocannabinoid biosynthesis remain unknown. The cellular hydrolysis of acyl chains on phospholipids is commonly catalyzed by phospholipase enzymes from the serine hydrolase superfamily (25Six D.A. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar). The catalytic nucleophile of serine hydrolases can be covalently modified by fluorophosphonate (FP) inhibitors (26Walsh C.T. Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1979: 92-93Google Scholar), providing a useful screen to test the contribution that these enzymes make to specific metabolic pathways. In contrast, most PLD enzymes, including NAPE-PLD (19Okamoto Y. Morishita J. Tsuboi K. Tonai T. Ueda N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5298-5305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 22Sun Y.X. Tsuboi K. Okamoto Y. Tonai T. Murakami M. Kudo I. Ueda N. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), do not use serine nucleophiles (27Leiros I. Secundo F. Zambonelli C. Servi S. Hough E. Structure. 2000; 8: 655-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and are therefore not sensitive to FP reagents (22Sun Y.X. Tsuboi K. Okamoto Y. Tonai T. Murakami M. Kudo I. Ueda N. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). To investigate whether serine hydrolases are involved in NAE biosynthesis, we measured the conversion of NAPE to NAE in NAPE-PLD(+/+) and (-/-) brains in the presence of methoxy arachidonyl FP (MAFP), a general inhibitor of this enzyme class (Fig. 2A) (28Lio Y.C. Reynolds L.J. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 29Deutsch D.G. Omir R. Arreaza G. Salehani D. Prestwich G.D. Huang Z. Howlett A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The residual NAE biosynthetic activity in NAPE-PLD(-/-) brains was strongly inhibited (>80%) by MAFP, suggesting the requirement for a serine hydrolase-mediated step(s) in this pathway. Interestingly, MAFP treatment also reduced the calcium-independent conversion of NAPEs to NAEs by ∼60% in NAPE-PLD(+/+) brains (Fig. 2A), indicating that in the absence of millimolar calcium, which is required for maximal activation of NAPE-PLD (30Ueda N. Liu Q. Yamanaka K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1532: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), a significant fraction of NAE biosynthesis proceeds through a serine hydrolase-mediated pathway. Phospholipase-mediated conversion of NAPE to NAE could occur by removing either one or both O-acyl chains to produce lysoNAPE (Fig. 1, reaction II) or GP-NAE (Fig. 1, reaction III), respectively. To distinguish between these two routes, we synthesized radiolabeled C16:0-lysoNAPE and measured its conversion to C16:0-NAE in the presence or absence of MAFP (Fig. 2A). Treatment with MAFP (5 μm in Me2SO) blocked greater than 80% of the conversion of lysoNAPE to NAE in both NAPE-PLD(+/+) and (-/-) brains, suggesting that both O-acyl chains of NAPEs must be hydrolyzed for NAPE-PLD-independent NAE biosynthesis to occur. Considering further that the extent of hydrolysis of lysoNAPE was equivalent between NAPE-PLD(+/+) and (-/-) brains, these results support previous studies indicating that NAPE-PLD does not possess significant lysoNAPE-PLD activity (19Okamoto Y. Morishita J. Tsuboi K. Tonai T. Ueda N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5298-5305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). To provide additional evidence that the MAFP-sensitive pathway for NAE biosynthesis requires hydrolysis of the O-acyl chains of NAPE, we synthesized a radiolabeled NAPE analogue that contains sn-1 and sn-2 ether linkages in place of the typical ester bonds. This hydrolysis-resistant NAPE analogue was not converted to NAE in NAPE-PLD(-/-) brains (Fig. 2B). In NAPE-PLD(+/+) brains, the amount of NAE product derived from diether-NAPE was comparable with that generated with diester-NAPE in MAFP-treated samples (Fig. 2, compare A and B), indicating that NAPE-PLD can accept NAPE substrates bearing ester or ether bonds in the sn-1 and sn-2 positions. These results confirm that the NAPE-PLD-independent biosynthesis of NAEs requires hydrolysis of the O-acyl chains of NAPE. Previous studies have shown that EDTA blocks conversion of lysoNAPE to NAE (21Natarajan V. Schmid P.C. Reddy P.V. Schmid H.H. J. Neurochem. 1984; 42: 1613-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 22Sun Y.X. Tsuboi K. Okamoto Y. Tonai T. Murakami M. Kudo I. Ueda N. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In the course of our studies, we observed serendipitously that upon the addition of EDTA (2 mm), not only is NAE production blocked, but there is a concomitant accumulation of a slower migrating species on silica gel thin layer chromatography (Fig. 2C). We speculated that this more polar intermediate might represent GP-NAE, which is a predicted metabolic intermediate for certain candidate pathways for NAE biosynthesis (Fig. 1, reaction III) (21Natarajan V. Schmid P.C. Reddy P.V. Schmid H.H. J. Neurochem. 1984; 42: 1613-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We confirmed the identity of this intermediate as GP-NAE by comparing its migration on a TLC plate to a synthetic standard and by LC-MS analysis, which showed its EDTA-dependent accumulation following incubation of lysoNAPE with brain extracts (Fig. 2D). We also observed the presence of an EDTA-sensitive enzymatic activity in brain tissue that rapidly cleaves the phosphodiester bond of GP-NAE to generate NAE (Fig. 2E). Taken together, these data provide strong evidence that the major NAPE-PLD-independent pathway for NAE biosynthesis in brain involves the serine hydrolase-catalyzed double deacylation of NAPE to yield GP-NAE, followed by phosphodiesterase-mediated conversion to NAE (Fig. 1, pathways II-IV). A similar pathway was also characterized in the testes of NAPE-PLD(-/-) mice (supplemental Fig. S1), suggesting that this route may contribute to NAE biosynthesis in both the CNS and peripheral tissues. Identification of α/β-Hydrolase 4 as a LysoNAPE-Lipase That Participates in NAE Biosynthesis—We next attempted to purify the lysoNAPE-lipase activity involved in NAE biosynthesis from mouse testis, which was previously observed to contain the highest activity for conversion of NAPEs to NAEs in a panel of tissues from NAPE-PLD(-/-) mice (20Leung D. Saghatelian A. Simon G.M. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4720-4726Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Testis tissues from NAPE-PLD(+/+) and (-/-) mice were found to possess equivalent levels of lysoNAPE-lipase activity, with significant activity distributed between both membrane and soluble fractions (supplemental Fig. S2). We therefore pursued the enrichment of the lysoNAPE-lipase activity from the soluble fraction of wild type testis. Passage of soluble testis extract over sequential ion exchange columns (see “Experimental Procedures”) led to a nearly 300-fold enrichment of lysoNAPE-lipase activity (Table 1). Enriched fractions were pooled and incubated with FP-biotin, an activity-based probe that reacts selectively with enzymes from the serine hydrolase superfamily (24Liu Y. Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14694-14699Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). FP-biotin-labeled hydrolases were isolated by affinity purification using avidin-conjugated beads, subjected to on-bead digestion, and analyzed by multidimensional LC-MS/MS. This functional proteomic method, referred to as activity-based protein profiling-multidimensional protein identification technology (ABPP-MudPIT) (23Jessani N. Niessen S. Wei B.Q. Nicolau M.

Methods. 2005; 2: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), identified three serine hydrolases in the lysoNAPE-lipase enriched fractions: hormone-sensitive lipase, group VI calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (Pla2g6), and the uncharacterized enzyme Abh4 (Table 2). Hormone-sensitive lipase is an interfacially activated neutral lipase selective for triacylglycerols and cholesterol esters (31Kraemer F.B. Shen W.J. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1585-1594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Strong signals for this enzyme were also observed in ABPP-MudPIT profiles of heart (Table 2), a tissue that lacked significant lysoNAPE-lipase activity (Fig. 3A). This result indicated that hormone-sensitive lipase was unlikely to account for the observed lysoNAPE-lipase activity. Additional ABPP-MudPIT studies of brain tissue, which displayed strong lysoNAPE-lipase activity (Fig. 3A), identified Abh4, but not Pla2g6 in these samples (Table 2). Based on these findings, we pursued the characterization of Abh4 as a candidate lysoNAPE-lipase.TABLE 1Partial purification of lysoNAPE-lipase from mouse testisPurification stepTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityFold purificationmgunitsa1 unit is defined as the amount of enzyme required to hydrolyze 10 nmol of lysoNAPE in 1 min at 37 °Cunit/mga1 unit is defined as the amount of enzyme required to hydrolyze 10 nmol of lysoNAPE in 1 min at 37 °CSoluble fraction17.10.070.0041HiTrap Q FF3.280.170.0511.95HiTrap SP FF0.110.141.24291.96a 1 unit is defined as the amount of enzyme required to hydrolyze 10 nmol of lysoNAPE in 1 min at 37 °C Open table in a new tab TABLE 2ABPP-MudPIT analysis of proteomes with high (brain, activity-enriched testis fraction) and low (heart) lysoNAPE-lipase activity The numerical values correspond to average spectral counts for each enzyme plus or minus standard error (for brain and heart, n ≥ 3; for activity-enriched testis fraction, n = 1).

Labeling of extracts from Abh4-transfected and mock transfected cells with a rhodamine-tagged FP probe (32Patricelli M.P. Giang D.K. Stamp L.M. Burbaum J.J. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 1067-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) confirmed high levels of Abh4 expression in the former samples (Fig. 4A, left panel). Extracts of Abh4-transfected cells displayed robust lysoNAPE-lipase activity as compared with mock transfected controls (Fig. 4A, right panel). Interestingly, Abh4-transfected cells also exhibited significant NAPE-lipase activity compared with mock transfected cells (Fig. 4B), indicating that this enzyme possesses phospholipase B-type activity (33Waite M. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 1379-1388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is capable of catalyzing both O-deacylation steps in the conversion of NAPE to GP-NAE (Fig. 1, reactions II and III). Mouse Abh4 is a 342-amino acid protein that shares very high sequence identity with its rat and human orthologues (99 and 96%, respectively; Fig. 5A). Abh4 is a member of the α/β-hydrolase family of proteins, so named for a highly conserved tertiary fold consisting of alternating α helices and β sheets (34Renault L. Negre V. Hotelier T. Cousin X. Marchot P. Chatonnet A. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2005; 15: 339-343Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The rodent and human genomes contain at least 15 orthologous sets of predicted α/β-hydrolase proteins (Fig. 5, B and C), none of which, to date, have been functionally annotated in terms of their catalytic activities or substrate selectivities. Alignment with other α/β-hydrolases identified Ser146 as the putative catalytic nucleophile of Abh4 (Fig. 5, A and C), a prediction that was supported by the characterization of this residue as the site of FP labeling (supplemental Table 1). This alignment also revealed that Abh5, the nearest sequence homologue of Abh4 (55% identity), lacks a serine nucleophile, suggesting that it may not possess hydrolytic activity. Consistent with this premise, recombinantly expressed Abh5 did not exhibit lysoNAPE-lipase activity (data not shown). We next investigated the substrate selectivity of Abh4 by screening the enzyme for activity against a panel of lysophospholipids. Abh4 was remarkably selective for lysoNAPE, showing no significant activity with other lysophospholipids, including lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, and lysophosphatidylserine (Fig. 6A). Within the lysoNAPE family, Abh4 hydrolyzed substrates bearing saturated (C16:0, C18:0, and C20:0), monounsaturated (C18: 1), and polyunsaturated (C20:4) N-acyl chains (Fig. 6B), indicating that this enzyme could contribute to the production of a wide range of NAEs, including the endocannabinoid anandamide. Finally, the tissue distribution of mouse Abh4 was evaluated by reverse transcription-PCR and found to correlate well with the levels of lysoNAPE-lipase activity, with the highest expression being observed in the CNS and testis, followed by liver and kidney, with negligible signals in heart (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that Abh4 is a primary source for the lysoNAPE-lipase activity observed in both the CNS and peripheral tissues of mice. A central tenant of chemical signaling is that the levels of small molecule transmitters should be tightly controlled by a balance of biosynthetic and degradative enzymes in vivo (35Siegel G.J. Agranoff B.W. Albers R.W. Molinoff P.B. Basic Neurochemistry. Raven Press, New York1994: 182Google Scholar). For many neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine and the monoamines, cognate enzymes responsible for their production and catabolism have been delineated (35Siegel G.J. Agranoff B.W. Albers R.W. Molinoff P.B. Basic Neurochemistry. Raven Press, New York1994: 182Google Scholar). In contrast, our knowledge of the metabolic pathways that regulate lipid messengers and, in particular, the endocannabinoids remains incomplete. Termination of anandamide/NAE signaling is principally performed by the integral membrane enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (15Cravatt B.F. Giang D.K. Mayfield S.P. Boger D.L. Lerner R.A. Gilula N.B. Nature. 1996; 384: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar), the inactivation of which leads to elevated levels of NAEs and analgesic, anxiolytic, and anti-inflammatory phenotypes (6Cravatt B.F.

Calignano A. Giustino A. Tattoli M. Palmery M. Cuomo V. Piomelli D. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). The enzymatic basis for NAE biosynthesis has proven more challenging to decipher. One postulated route for NAE biosynthesis invokes the sequential action of an NAPE-generating transacylase and NAPE-hydrolyzing phospholipase D (17Natarajan V. Reddy P.V. Schmid P.C. Schmid H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 712: 342-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 21Natarajan V. Schmid P.C. Reddy P.V. Schmid H.H. J. Neurochem. 1984; 42: 1613-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The molecular characterization of a PLD enzyme from the metallo-lactamase family that selectively accepts NAPEs as substrates has lent support to this model (19Okamoto Y. Morishita J. Tsuboi K. Tonai T. Ueda N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5298-5305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). However, targeted disruption of the NAPE-PLD gene was found to lower the levels of only a subset of NAEs (principally, very long chain saturated) in mouse brain, with other groups (e.g. polyunsaturated NAEs) being unaltered (20Leung D. Saghatelian A. Simon G.M. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4720-4726Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). These results indicate that additional pathways for NAE biosynthesis exist, and these routes appear to be particularly important for the generation of anandamide and other polyunsaturated NAEs. Here, we have investigated alternative mechanisms for NAE biosynthesis and provided biochemical evidence that these lipids can be produced by an NAPE-PLD-independent pathway involving the double-deacylation of NAPE to generate a GP-NAE intermediate that is rapidly cleaved to release the corresponding NAE. This multi-step pathway, which can be detected in both the CNS and peripheral tissues (e.g. testis), appears to be driven by the sequential actions of an FP-sensitive serine hydrolase(s) and metal-dependent phosphodiesterase. By combining conventional protein purification and functional proteomic technologies, we isolated and identified Abh4, an enzyme of previously unknown function, as a candidate lysoNAPE-lipase. Recombinant expression confirmed that Abh4 possesses lysoNAPE-lipase activity, as well as the ability to hydrolyze NAPEs, suggesting that this enzyme may catalyze both O-deacylation steps en route to generating GP-NAE. Abh4 displayed multiple properties that would be expected of an enzyme involved in NAE biosynthesis: high selectivity for lysoNAPEs over other lysophospholipids, a distribution that matches closely the lysoNAPE-lipase activity of mouse tissues, and broad acceptance of NAPEs bearing distinct N-acyl chains. Taken together, our findings suggest that Abh4 is a dedicated (lyso)NAPE-lipase that participates in an NAPE-PLD-independent pathway for NAE biosynthesis. Determining the unique contribution that this Abh4-mediated route makes to the production of NAEs in vivo, including the endocannabinoid anandamide, will require the generation of genetic or pharmacological tools that selectively perturb this pathway. Nonetheless, its high activity in tissues with enriched expression of the CB1 receptor (e.g. CNS, testis) is provocative and suggests a potentially major contribution to endocannabinoid signaling. The continued pursuit of additional enzymes involved in NAE biosynthesis, including the NAPE-generating transacylase, GP-NAE phosphodiesterase, and possibly other NAPE-lipases, should further enrich our understanding of the complex metabolic network that supports the endocannabinoid/NAE system in vivo. From a therapeutic perspective, any of these enzymes could represent an attractive drug target for a range of human disorders in which disruption of endocannabinoid signaling by CB1 antagonists has proven beneficial (38Fernandez J.R.

Based on the involvement of AQPs in angiogenesis and cell migration, we tested whether AQP expression in tumor cells might enhance their migration and metastatic potential. Transfection of B16F10 and 4T1 tumor cells with AQP1 did not affect their appearance, size, growth, or substrate adherence but increased their plasma membrane osmotic water permeability by 5- to 10-fold. In vitro analysis of cell migration by transwell assay, wound healing and video microscopy showed a 2- to 3-fold accelerated migration of the AQP1-expressing tumor cells compared to control cells. In mice, AQP1 expression increased tumor cell extravasation by >1.5-fold as quantified by counting tumor cells in lung at 6 h after tail vein injection of a mixture of fluorescently tagged AQP1-expressing and control tumor cells. AQP1 expression also increased by 3-fold the number of lung metastases 14 days after tail vein injection of tumor cells, with alveolar wall infiltration seen with AQP1-expressing tumor cells. Our results provide evidence for AQP-facilitated tumor cell migration and spread, suggesting a novel function for AQP expression in high-grade tumors. AQP inhibition may thus reduce the metastatic potential of some tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1972502482,"Lymphatic vascular development is regulated by vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3), which is activated by its ligands VEGF-C and VEGF-D. Neuropilin-2 (NP2), known to be involved in neuronal development, has also been implicated to play a role in lymphangiogenesis. We aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which NP2 is involved in lymphatic endothelial cell signaling. By in vitro binding studies we found that both VEGF-C and VEGF-D interact with NP2, VEGF-C in a heparin-independent and VEGF-D in a heparin-dependent manner. We also mapped the domains of VEGF-C and NP2 required for their binding. The functional importance of the interaction of NP2 with the lymphangiogenic growth factors was demonstrated by cointernalization of NP2 along with VEGFR-3 in endocytic vesicles of lymphatic endothelial cells upon stimulation with VEGF-C or VEGF-D. NP2 also interacted with VEGFR-3 in coprecipitation studies. Our results show that NP2 is directly involved in an active signaling complex with the key regulators of lymphangiogenesis and thus suggest a mechanism by which NP2 functions in the development of the lymphatic vasculature."

The three components of the cytoskeleton, intermediate filaments, microtubules, and actin filaments (microfilaments), contribute to the structural organization of the cytoplasm and help regulate the topography of the plasma membrane in eukaryotic cells (1Chang L.

Microtubules and actin filaments have nucleotide binding and hydrolyzing activity, whereas intermediate filaments, which serve as cytoskeletal “identity cards” that distinguish different cell types, have no known enzymatic activity. Disassembly of the actin filament cytoskeleton, which is involved in cell motility, adhesion, and endocytosis, leads to fusion of intracellular vesicular membranes with the plasma membrane (4Pelkmans L. Puntener D. Helenius A. Science. 2002; 296: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Microtubules, the polymerized tubulin cytoskeleton, are involved in cell locomotion, movement of organelles, and mitosis. Both actin filaments and microtubules are implicated in membrane trafficking in mitotic cells (5Mundy D.I. Machleidt T. Ying Y.S. Anderson R.G. Bloom G.S. J.

However, the contribution of microtubules and actin filaments to caveolae-regulated signal transduction, in particular GPCR-Gs-protein-AC-cAMP signaling, is unknown. An example of a physiologically important GPCR is the β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR), whose activation by the sympathetic nervous system or circulating catecholamines is a key mechanism for the production of cAMP in numerous tissues, including the mammalian heart (19van der Heyden M.A. Wijnhoven T.J. Opthof T. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 65: 28-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). As indicated above, substantial data indicate thatβ-AR-stimulated cAMP formation can be enhanced by agents that disrupt microtubules or actin filaments, but the precise mechanisms have not been defined (6Insel P.A.

Because the effectiveness of this signaling cascade depends upon the organization and location of signaling proteins within the plasma membrane, we tested for a mechanistic link between the localization of GPCR signaling components in caveolae and the ability of cytoskeletal agents to alter β-AR signal transduction. We, thus, assessed the impact of disruption of microtubules and actin filaments on the distribution of caveolae, caveolins, and GPCR signaling components as related to GPCR-Gs mediated-cAMP production. The results indicate that intact microtubules and actin filaments contribute to the presence of caveolae and tonic inhibition of GPCR-Gs-AC signal transduction.

S49 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and 10 μm HEPES in 10% CO2 at 37 °C; S49 cells were studied at 106 cells/ml. Membrane Fractionation—CM and S49 cells were fractionated using a detergent-free method (23Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). CM from a 15-cm plate or 107 S49 cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and scraped in 3 ml of either 500 mm Na2CO3, pH 11.0, to extract peripheral membrane proteins. Cells were homogenized using three 10-s bursts of a tissue grinder and then sonicated with 3 cycles of 20-s bursts of sonication and a 1-min incubation on ice. Approximately 2 ml of homogenate were mixed with 2 ml of 90% sucrose in 25 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl (MBS, pH 6.5) to form 45% sucrose and loaded at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. A discontinuous sucrose gradient was generated by layering 4 ml of 35% sucrose prepared in MBS, 250 mm Na2CO3 followed by 4 ml of 5% sucrose (in MBS/Na2CO3). Gradients were centrifuged at 280,000 × g using a SW41Ti rotor (Beckman) for 16-20 h at 4 °C. Samples were removed in 1-ml aliquots to form 12 fractions. Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitations were performed using either protein A or protein G-agarose (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were incubated with primary antibody for 1-3 h at 4 °C, immunoprecipitated with protein-agarose overnight at 4 °C, and then spun for 5 min at 13,000 × g. The pellets were washed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1% IGEPAL CA-630) then in wash buffer 2 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.2% IGEPAL CA-630) and wash buffer 3 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2% IGEPAL CA-630). Immunoblot Analysis—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 10 or 12% acrylamide gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) by electroelution. Membranes were blocked in 20 mm PBS Tween (1%) containing 1.5% nonfat dry milk and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibodies were visualized using secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). All displayed bands migrated at the appropriate size as compared with molecular weight standards (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The amount of protein per fraction was determined using a dye-binding protein assay (Bio-Rad). Immunofluorescence Microscopy of CMs—CMs were prepared for immunofluorescence microscopy as described (18Head B.P. Patel H.H. Roth D.M. Lai N.C. Niesman I.R. Farquhar M.G. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31036-31044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) with growth for 24 h after plating on precoated laminin (2 μg/cm2) glass coverslips. Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, incubated with 100 mm glycine, pH 7.4, for 10 min to quench aldehyde groups, permeabilized in buffered Triton X-100 (0.1%) for 10 min, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), PBS, Tween (0.05%) for 20 min, and then incubated with primary antibodies (1:100) in 1% BSA, PBS, Tween (0.05%) for 24-48 h at 4 °C. Excess antibody was removed by incubation with PBS, Tween (0.1%) for 15 min; samples were then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate or Alexa-conjugated secondary antibody (1:250) for 1 h. To remove excess secondary antibody, cells were washed 6× at 5-min intervals with PBS, Tween (0.1%) and incubated for 20 min with the nuclear stain 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1:5000) diluted in PBS. Cells were washed for 10 min with PBS and mounted in gelvatol for microscopic imaging. Deconvolution Image Analysis—Deconvolution images were obtained (18Head B.P. Patel H.H. Roth D.M. Lai N.C. Niesman I.R. Farquhar M.G. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31036-31044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and captured with a DeltaVision deconvolution microscope system (Applied Precision, Inc., Issaquah, WA), which includes a Photometrics CCD mounted on a Nikon TE-200 inverted epifluorescence microscope. Between 30 and 80 optical sections spaced by ∼0.1-0.3 μm were taken. Exposure times were set so that the camera response was in the linear range for each fluorophore. Data sets were deconvolved and analyzed using SoftWorx software (Applied Precision, Inc.) on a Silicon Graphics Octane work station. Image analysis was performed with the Data Inspector program in SoftWorx. Maximal projection volume views or single optical sections are shown as indicated. Quantitation of Co-localization—We quantitated the co-localization of pixels using CoLocalizer Pro 1.0 software. Overlap coefficient according to Manders (MOC) was used to determine the degree of colocalization on whole cells or sarcolemmal regions after subtracting background through normalized threshold values (24Zinchuk O. Fukushima A. Hangstefer E. Cell Tissue Res. 2004; 317: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The values are defined by 0-1 (1 implying that 100% of both components overlap with the other part of the image). Statistics were performed with Prism. Electron Microscopy—Cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer for 2 h at room temperature, postfixed in 1% OsO4 in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (1 h) at room temperature, and embedded as monolayers in LX-112 (Ladd Research, Williston, VT), as described previously (25De Vries L. Elenko E. McCaffery J.M. Fischer T. Hubler L. McQuistan T. Watson N. Farquhar M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1123-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Sections were stained in uranyl acetate and lead citrate and observed with the use of an electron microscope (JEOL 1200 EX-II or Philips CM-10). Caveolae were identified as 50-100-nm invaginations or vesicles within several nanometers of the membrane and quantitated on random images per length of membrane. Measurement of cAMP Production—We assayed cAMP accumulation by incubating cells for 10 min with drugs of interest and 0.2 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, a cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibitor. To terminate the reaction, assay medium was aspirated, and 250 μl of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (7.5%, w/v) was added. cAMP content in trichloroacetic acid extracts was determined by radioimmunoassay (18Head B.P. Patel H.H. Roth D.M. Lai N.C. Niesman I.R. Farquhar M.G. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31036-31044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Production of cAMP was normalized to the amount of protein per sample (63,000 cells/well) as determined using a dye-binding protein assay (Bio-Rad). Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Student's unpaired t test was used to compare treatment groups with significance established at a level of p < 0.05. Caveolin Isoforms, β-AR, Gαs, and AC5/6 Are Excluded from Buoyant Fractions of Adult CM after Cytoskeletal Disruption—To test the impact of cytoskeletal disrupting agents on expression and co-localization of caveolins and GPCR-Gs-AC, we investigated the distribution of caveolin-3 and signaling components in fractions prepared by sucrose density gradient fractionation of adult CMs treated with Colch or CDs using conditions previously validated to lead to inhibition of microtubule and actin filament assembly, respectively (26Goldman R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 51: 752-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 27Mons S. Veretout F. Carlier M. Erk I. Lepault J. Trudel E. Salesse C. Ducray P. Mioskowski C. Lebeau L. Biochim. Biophys.

Treatment with Colch or CD redistributed caveolins 1, 2, and 3 from buoyant fractions (fractions 4 and 5, termed buoyant caveolin-rich fractions (BF)) to heavy/non-buoyant fractions (fractions 9-12 (HF)) and similarly redistributed β1-AR, β2-AR, AC5/6, and Gαs (Fig. 1A-C) without changing protein expression in Colch- and CD-treated whole cell lysates (WCL) compared with control. In parallel with the redistribution of signaling components, the β-AR agonist isoproterenol stimulated the generation of more cAMP in Colch-, nocodazole (another microtubule disrupter)-, and CD-treated CMs (Fig. 1D; p < 0.05 versus control). These results show that agents that depolymerize microtubules and actin filaments redistribute caveolin isoforms and β-AR signaling components (i.e. β-ARs, AC5/6,Gαs) from BF to HF and enhance β-AR-stimulated cAMP production, indicating that despite cellular redistribution of caveolins and disruption of caveolae (corroborated by electron microscopy, to be shown subsequently (see Fig. 6)) components involved in cAMP generation have more catalytically productive interactions.FIGURE 6Cytoskeletal disruption decreases co-localization between caveolin-3 and filamin in cardiac myocytes. A, caveolin-3 was detected in filamin immunoprecipitates of CM lysates. Treatment with Colch (Colc,30 μm; 1 h), CD (Cyto D,20 μm; 1.5 h), and nocodazole (NCD,33 μm; 1 h) decreased the amount of caveolin-3 detected in filamin immunoprecipitates. Ctrl, control. B, co-localization of caveolin-3 with filamin on the sarcolemmal membrane was significantly reduced (p < 0.01) in the presence of Colch and CD, as indicated by a reduction in yellow fluorescence (overlapping pixels). C, data from Fig. 6B are expressed as percent sarcolemma co-localization between caveolin-3 and filamin and was quantitated on 3-5 cells from 4 separate experiments. Images were de-convolved and shown as single-stained or overlaid to show co-localization. Scale bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Co-immunoprecipitation Reveals Caveolin-1 and Caveolin-3 in Multiprotein Complexes in CMs—As suggested by previous work (29Capozza F. Cohen A.W. Cheung M.W. Sotgia F. Schubert W. Battista M. Lee H. Frank P.G. Lisanti M.P. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2005; 288: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) regarding the interaction of caveolins and formation of hetero-oligomeric complexes, caveolin 1, 2, and 3 co-immunoprecipitated in lysates of CMs (Fig. 2A). Filamin is an F-actin cross-linking protein that can interact with caveolin-1 (10Stahlhut M. van Deurs B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 30Halayko A.J. Stelmack G.L. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2005; 83: 877-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To test whether such an interaction occurs in CM, we assessed whether caveolin-1 and caveolin-3 are present in filamin immunoprecipitates from CMs prepared from wild-type and caveolin-1 null mice; we detected caveolin-1 in both caveolin-3 and filamin immunoprecipitates prepared from control but not caveolin-1-null mice (Fig. 2A). Colch and CD decreased detection of AC5/6 and phosphorylated caveolin-1 in caveolin-1 immunoprecipitates from adult CM (Fig. 2B). Thus, all three caveolin isoforms are expressed and form multiprotein complexes in adult CM lysates, and inhibition of either microtubules or actin filaments decreases detection of phosphorylated caveolin-1 and AC in caveolin-associated complexes. Colch and CD Treatment Redistributes Linker for Activation of T Cells (LAT) and Gαs from Buoyant Fractions in S49 Cells—Previous work has demonstrated that treatment of murine S49 T-lymphoma cells with Colch and CD enhances β-AR-mediated cAMP production by post-β-AR actions (8Leiber D. Jasper J.R. Alousi A.A. Martin J. Bernstein D. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3833-3837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). S49 cells possess lipid rafts but lack caveolae (32Thomas S. Preda-Pais A. Casares S. Brumeanu T.D. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 41: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 33Huang C. Hepler J.R. Chen L.T. Gilman A.G. Anderson R.G. Mumby S.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2365-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). LAT is an integral membrane protein and a marker for lipid rafts in T cells; lipid rafts can be isolated in buoyant fractions of disrupted cells (34Volonte D. Galbiati F. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8094-8103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 35Tsutsui H. Ishihara K. Cooper G. Science. 1993; 260: 682-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Gαs has also been identified as a lipid raft constituent in T cells (34Volonte D. Galbiati F. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8094-8103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 35Tsutsui H. Ishihara K. Cooper G. Science. 1993; 260: 682-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). We, thus, used murine S49 T-lymphoma cells to assess the impact of Colch and CD on localization of these lipid raft signaling components. We found that LAT and Gαs of S49 cells partially localize in buoyant fractions after sucrose density fractionation (Fig. 3A). Treatment with Colch (Fig. 3B) and CD (Fig. 3C) redistributed LAT and Gαs to heavy fractions. Thus, disruption of microtubules and actin microfilaments redistributes components involved in cAMP production and T cell activation from lipid raft fractions in S49 cells. Treatment with Colch and CD Decreases Caveolin-1, p38 MAPK, and Src Phosphorylation in Adult CMs—In further studies with adult CMs we assessed signaling components that are distal to the generation of cAMP and also examined the impact of cytoskeletal disruptors on the expression of tyrosine-phosphorylated caveolin-1 and -2 (P-Cav-1 and -2), whose phosphorylation is mediated by Src tyrosine kinase family members (34Volonte D. Galbiati F. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8094-8103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Colch treatment decreased the amount of P-Cav-1, P-Cav-2, P-p38, and P-Src, albeit the latter exhibited a somewhat slower time course (Fig. 4A). CD treatment decreased expression of P-Cav-1, P-p38, and P-Src but not P-Cav-2 (Fig. 4B). Phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 expression was not altered after treatment with Colch or CD (data not shown). Sucrose density centrifugation revealed that in control cells the majority of P-Cav-1 and P-Src (but not Src (T-Src in Fig. 4C)) distribute to BF, with some P-Src in HF; Colch or CD treatment decreased and redistributed P-Cav-1, P-Src, and T Src (Fig. 4C). The antibody for P-Src may cross-react with other Src family members in equivalent phosphorylation states (according to the antibody manufacturer), thus potentially explaining the different bands detected in BF and HF. Overall, these studies demonstrate that disruption of microtubules and actin filaments in adult CM alters phosphorylation of caveolin (without changing total caveolin expression), p38, and Src. Immunofluorescence Microscopy of Adult CMs after Treatment with Colch and CD Reveals Irregular Caveolin-3 Clusters in Subsarcolemmal Regions—We used immunofluorescence microscopy to directly assess the intracellular distribution of caveolin-3 after cytoskeletal disruption. In untreated cells, caveolin-3 co-localized with α-tubulin on the sarcolemma (Fig. 5A, left image). Colch treatment decreased co-localization between caveolin-3 and α-tubulin in the sarcolemma (p < 0.05 versus control) (Fig. 5B). Treatment with CD resulted in irregular caveolin-3 clusters in subsarcolemmal regions; quantitation revealed no reduction in co-localization between caveolin-3 and α-tubulin, in particular on the sarcolemma. Thus, co-localization between caveolin-3 and α-tubulin depends upon proper assembly of microtubules, with cytoskeletal disruption leading to irregular clustering of caveolin-3 in subsarcolemmal and intracellular regions. Co-localization of Caveolin-3 and Filamin Is Decreased after Cytoskeletal Disruption—To determine whether filamin, an F-actin cross-linking protein and ligand of caveolin-1 (10Stahlhut M. van Deurs B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), is detected in multiprotein complexes with caveolin-3, we performed immunoprecipitation with CM lysates using a filamin antibody; we detected caveolin-3 in filamin immunoprecipitates (Fig."
https://openalex.org/W2112042684,"Bacterial LPS triggers dramatic changes in gene expression in macrophages. We show here that LPS regulated several members of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) family at the mRNA level in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM). LPS transiently repressed, then induced a number of HDACs (Hdac-4, 5, 7) in BMM, whereas Hdac-1 mRNA was induced more rapidly. Treatment of BMM with trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of HDACs, enhanced LPS-induced expression of the Cox-2, Cxcl2, and Ifit2 genes. In the case of Cox-2, this effect was also apparent at the promoter level. Overexpression of Hdac-8 in RAW264 murine macrophages blocked the ability of LPS to induce Cox-2 mRNA. Another class of LPS-inducible genes, which included Ccl2, Ccl7, and Edn1, was suppressed by TSA, an effect most likely mediated by PU.1 degradation. Hence, HDACs act as potent and selective negative regulators of proinflammatory gene expression and act to prevent excessive inflammatory responses in macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2042557251,"The stress-activated c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (p38) regulate apoptosis induced by several forms of cellular insults. Potential targets for these kinases include members of the Bcl-2 family proteins, which mediate apoptosis generated through the mitochondria-initiated, intrinsic cell death pathway. Indeed, the activities of several Bcl-2 family proteins, both pro- and anti-apoptotic, are controlled by JNK phosphorylation. For example, the pro-apoptotic activity of BimEL, a member of the Bcl-2 family, is stimulated by JNK phosphorylation at Ser-65. In contrast, there is no reported evidence that p38-induced apoptosis is due to direct phosphorylation of Bcl-2 family proteins. Here we report evidence that sodium arsenite-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells may be due to direct phosphorylation of BimEL at Ser-65 by p38. This conclusion is supported by data showing that ectopic expression of a wild type, but not a non-phosphorylatable S65A mutant of BimEL, potentiates sodium arsenite-induced apoptosis and by experiments showing direct phosphorylation of BimEL at Ser-65 by p38 in vitro. Furthermore, sodium arsenite induced BimEL phosphorylation at Ser-65, which was blocked by p38 inhibition. This study provides the first example whereby p38 induces apoptosis by phosphorylating a member of the Bcl-2 family and illustrates that phosphorylation of BimEL on Ser-65 may be a common regulatory point for cell death induced by both JNK and p38 pathways.

Apoptosis plays a critical role in the proper development of the nervous system and the maintenance of homeostasis in the adult brain. Inappropriate apoptosis may contribute to various neurodegenerative conditions including stroke, epilepsy, and Parkinson disease. Furthermore, many environmental toxicants exert neurotoxicity by inducing apoptosis.

In contrast to extensive studies concerning the regulation of Bcl-2 family members by JNK, there is no evidence that p38 regulates apoptosis through direct phosphorylation of Bcl-2 family proteins.The objective of this study was to determine whether p38-induced apoptosis is dependent on p38-catalyzed phosphorylation of BimEL using arsenite-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells as an in vitro model. Our data suggest that sodium arsenite induces apoptosis by a mechanism that depends on p38 activity and BimEL function. Significantly, p38 was both necessary and sufficient to induce BimEL phosphorylation at Ser-65, a known JNK phosphorylation site that plays a key role in JNK-induced apoptosis (33Putcha G.V. Le S.

Thirty micrograms of protein were used for Western analysis. For the in vitro kinase assay measuring p38 phosphorylation of Bim, 250 ng of recombinant, active p38α protein and 1 μg of recombinant BimEL protein or BimEL ATP 3A protein were incubated with 100 μm in kinase assay buffer as described by the protocol from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. The recombinant BimEL and BimEL 3A and p38α were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. The kinase reaction was carried out in 50 μl of total volume and at 37 °C for 30 min.

Sodium arsenite reduced cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner. To determine whether the loss of cell viability was due to apoptosis, PC12 cells were treated with 0 or 15 μm sodium arsenite for 24 h and stained with the DNA dye Hoechst to visualize nuclear morphology. Sodium arsenite caused morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis, including nuclear condensation and fragmentation (Fig. 1B). Induction of the apoptotic phenotype by sodium arsenite was dependent on the time of incubation with increasing apoptosis over time (Fig. 1C).FIGURE 1Sodium arsenite induces apoptosis in PC12 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner.

To evaluate the contribution of p38 MAP kinase for arsenite-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells, p38 activity was monitored by Western analysis using an anti-phospho-p38 antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated and activated p38 (Fig. 2, A and B). Treatment with sodium arsenite at 15 μm, or higher concentrations, induced p38 phosphorylation (Fig. 2A), indicative of p38 activation. Activation of p38 was detectable 1 h after treatment, reached a maximum at 8 h, and persisted for at least 24 h (Fig. 2B).To determine whether p38 activation contributes to sodium arsenite-induced apoptosis, PC12 cells were transiently transfected with a dominant interfering mutant of MAP kinase kinase 3 (dnMKK3) to selectively block p38 activation. MKK3 is an upstream kinase that activates and phosphorylates p38 (47Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). Expression of dnMKK3 significantly inhibited apoptosis induced by 15 μm sodium arsenite (Fig. 2C; ***, p < 0.001). In addition, treatment with 10 μm SB202190 or SB203580, inhibitors for p38, also protected PC12 cells from sodium arsenite toxicity (Fig. 2D; ***, p < 0.001 (and data not shown)). These data suggest that p38 is required for apoptosis in PC12 cells caused by sodium arsenite treatment.Sodium Arsenite-induced Apoptosis and p38 Activation Are Mediated through Oxidative Stress—Because sodium arsenite can induce oxidative stress (48Bernstam L.

Indeed, sodium arsenite-induced p38 activation was attenuated by treatment with either of two antioxidants, GSH or NAC (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, GSH and NAC protected PC12 cells from sodium arsenite-induced cell apoptosis (Fig. 3, B and C). These data suggest that sodium arsenite causes oxidative stress in PC12 cells, which leads to p38 activation and apoptosis.BimEL Protein Is Required for Sodium Arsenite-induced Apoptosis—Because Bcl-2 family members, including BimEL, are implicated in mitochondria-initiated cell death, we examined the effect of reducing BimEL expression on arsenite-mediated apoptosis. This was accomplished using a DNA template-based RNA interference method to specifically lower the expression of endogenous BimEL (35Becker E.B. Howell J. Kodama Y. Barker P.A. Bonni A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8762-8770Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Transient transfection of PC12 cells with a plasmid DNA encoding a BimEL hairpin RNA (35Becker E.B. Howell J. Kodama Y. Barker P.A. Bonni A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8762-8770Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) almost completely knocked down BimEL protein expression 2 days after transfection (Fig. 4A). This decrease in Bim protein significantly protected cells from apoptosis induced by constitutive p38 activation (Fig. 4B, caMKK3+p38α) and sodium arsenite treatment (Fig. 4C; ***, p < 0.001). As a control, we transfected PC12 cells with the empty vector control, an shRNA to luciferase (shLucif), shRNA to GFP, or scrambled PDE2 shRNA, all of which are driven by the human U6-RNA polIII promoter. None of the control shRNAs had any effect on Bim protein expression (data not shown) or on sodium arsenite-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4C). The effectiveness of shRNA to GFP was confirmed by its suppression of the expression of a co-transfected GFP, whereas the effectiveness of shRNA to luciferase was confirmed by luciferase assay (data not shown). These data suggest that BimEL protein is required for p38-mediated, sodium arsenite-induced apoptosis.Sodium Arsenite Stimulation of BimEL Phosphoryla"
https://openalex.org/W2008785161,"Individual variation in drug metabolism is a major cause of unpredictable side effects during therapy. Drug metabolism is controlled by a class of orphan nuclear receptors (NRs), which regulate expression of genes such as CYP (cytochrome)3A4 and MDR-1 (multi-drug resistance-1), that are involved in this process. We have found that xenobiotic-mediated induction of CYP3A4 and MDR-1 gene transcription was inhibited by ketoconazole, a commonly used antifungal drug. Ketoconazole mediated its effect by inhibiting the activation of NRs, human pregnenolone X receptor and constitutive androstene receptor, involved in regulation of CYP3A4 and MDR-1. The effect of ketoconazole was specific to the group of NRs that control xenobiotic metabolism. Ketoconazole disrupted the interaction of the xenobiotic receptor PXR with the co-activator steroid receptor co-activator-1. Ketoconazole treatment resulted in delayed metabolism of tribromoethanol anesthetic in mice, which was correlated to the inhibition of PXR activation and downmodulation of cyp3a11 and mdr-1 genes and proteins. These studies demonstrate for the first time that ketoconazole represses the coordinated activation of genes involved in drug metabolism, by blocking activation of a specific subset of NRs. Our results suggest that ketoconazole can be used as a pan-antagonist of NRs involved in xenobiotic metabolism in vivo, which may lead to novel strategies that improve drug effect and tolerance."

Mammals possess at least 15 formin genes. A subset of formins termed “diaphanous formins” are regulated by autoinhibition through interaction between an N-terminal diaphanous inhibitory domain (DID) and a C-terminal diaphanous autoregulatory domain (DAD). Here, we found several striking features for the mouse formin, INF2. First, INF2 interacted directly with actin through a region C-terminal to the FH2. This second interacting region sequesters actin monomers, an activity that is dependent on a WASP homology 2 (WH2) motif. Second, the combination of the FH2 and C-terminal regions of INF2 resulted in its curious ability to accelerate both polymerization and depolymerization of actin filaments. The mechanism of the depolymerization activity, which is novel for formin proteins, involves both the monomer binding ability of the WH2 and a potent severing activity that is dependent on covalent attachment of the FH2 to the C terminus. Phosphate inhibits both the depolymerization and severing activities of INF2, suggesting that phosphate release from actin subunits in the filament is a trigger for depolymerization.

The FH1 domain, N-terminal to the FH2, binds profilin and accelerates elongation from FH2-bound barbed ends in a profilin-dependent manner (4Kovar D.R. Harris E.S. Mahaffy R. Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D.

Although individual formins differ quantitatively in some activities, the overall effect of formins is to enhance actin assembly rate. In addition, some FH2 domains can bundle filaments (6Harris E.S.

Most eukaryotes possess multiple formins, with mammals having at least 15 formin genes that segregate into seven classes based on FH2 domain phylogenetic analysis (9Higgs H.N. Peterson K.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). One exclusively metazoan group, termed inverted formins (INFs), were thought to be unique in the placement of their FH1 and FH2 domains at the N terminus of the protein, as opposed to all other formins, which have additional domains N-terminal to the FH1. This difference has regulatory significance, because the N termini of many formins, including mammalian mDia1 and mDia2, contain a diaphanous inhibitory domain (DID), which is a stably folded region consisting of five armadillo repeats (10Li F.

In mDia1 and mDia2, DID binds tightly to the diaphanous autoregulatory domain (DAD), a stretch of 20 or so amino acids C-terminal to the FH2 (10Li F. Higgs H.N. J. Biol.

The DID/DAD interaction strongly inhibits FH2 domain activity; thus formins that contain these domains are considered “autoinhibited.” For mDia1, autoinhibition is relieved when GTP-bound RhoA binds a GTPase binding domain that overlaps the N terminus of the DID (10Li F. Higgs H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6986-6992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 12Rose R. Weyand M. Lammers M. Ishizaki T. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A.

Many other formins possess DID and DAD sequences, suggesting that autoinhibitory regulation is widespread (18Higgs H.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 342-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Because no DID or DAD has been identified for an INF formin, the conclusion has been that other mechanisms regulate this group. In this study, we found that the mouse formin INF2 has the unique ability to accelerate depolymerization, in addition to the nucleation and elongation activities common to formins. INF2 depolymerization activity requires its unique C terminus, containing an actin-binding WASP homology 2 motif (WH2), and can sequester actin monomers in 1:1 complexes. In addition, the C terminus is required for rapid filament severing by INF2. Both depolymerization and severing are inhibited by phosphate, suggesting that these activities require phosphate release from actin subunits after ATP hydrolysis. Mutation of the WH2 motif strongly inhibits depolymerization. Finally, we identify an N-terminal DID for INF2, suggesting its regulation by autoinhibition. The WH2 motif likely serves as a DAD based on its position and sequence similarity to other DADs. The closely related formin INF1 possesses neither DID nor DAD. DNA Constructs—INF2-(FH1-FH2-C) (amino acids 538-1274) INF2-(FH1-FH2) (538-993), and INF2-(C) (994-1274) (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. 2) constructs were generated by reverse transcriptase-PCR from RNA isolated by the TRIzol method (Invitrogen) from 300.19 murine Abelson leukemia virus-transformed pre-B cells (19Alt F. Rosenberg N. Lewis S. Thomas E. Baltimore D. Cell. 1981; 27: 381-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). cDNA was synthesized using oligo(dT) primer and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). INF2-(C) was cloned into pGEX-KT vector (20Hakes D.J. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) for bacterial expression as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. INF2-(FH1-FH2) was cloned into pET22b for expression as a C-terminally His6-tagged protein. INF2-(FH1-FH2-C) was cloned into pET22b for expression as an untagged protein. To mutate the three conserved leucine residues (amino acids 1008, 1009, and 1018) in the WH2 motif of INF2-(FH1-FH2-C) and INF2-(C), the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) was used. All three residues were converted to alanine. The INF2 sequence has been deposited in GenBank™ under accession number DQ834374. Protein Expression and Purification—Rosetta 2 DE3 Escherichia coli (Novagen) were used for expression of all constructs, and expression was induced as described previously (6Harris E.S. Rouiller I. Hanein D. Higgs H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14383-14392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 21Harris E.S. Li F. Higgs H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20076-20087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). INF2-(FH1-FH2) was purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid super flow chromatography (Qiagen) and dialyzed into Na150MEPD (150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mm NaPO4, 0.5 mm DTT, pH 7.0), then stored at 4 °C. INF2-(C) was purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B chromatography (GE Healthcare) followed by removal of the glutathione S-transferase. This procedure results in two bands that migrate at 55 and 37 kDa by SDS-PAGE. Mass spectroscopy and Edman degradation analysis showed that these bands represented the full INF2-(C) construct (calculated mass of 30.2 kDa) and a C-terminal truncation product, amino acids 994-1234, respectively. Full INF2-(C) was separated from the truncated product by SP-Sepharose chromatography (GE Healthcare). The anomalously high mass by SDS-PAGE might be because of the low pI (4.6) of INF2-(C). Purified INF2-(C) was dialyzed in Na50MEPD and stored at 4 or -70 °C. INF2-(FH1-FH2-C) was purified by SP-Sepharose chromatography, Q-Sepharose chromatography (GE Healthcare), and Superdex 200 26/60 size exclusion chromatography (GE Healthcare). Fractions were stored at 4 °C in Na150MEPD. The molecular mass of full-length protein is 81.4 kDa by mass spectroscopy, but the protein migrates at ∼100 kDa by SDS-PAGE. Rabbit muscle actin was purified from acetone powder and labeled with pyrenyliodoacetamide (22Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both labeled and unlabeled actin were gel-filtered on an S-200 column (23MacLean-Fletcher S. Pollard T.D. Cell. 1980; 20: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), which was essential for obtaining reproducible kinetic results. Human profilin I was expressed in bacteria and purified as described (21Harris E.S. Li F. Higgs H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20076-20087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Buffers Used for Biochemical Studies—The following buffers were used frequently: G buffer (2 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% NaN3); G-Mg buffer (same as G buffer but with 0.1 mm MgCl2 instead of CaCl2); 10× KMEI: 500 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2,10mm EGTA, and 100 mm imidazole, pH 7.0; 10× NaMEI (same as 10× KMEI but with 500 mm NaCl instead of KCl); polymerization buffer (G-Mg buffer plus either 1× KMEI or 1× NaMEI). Polymerization buffer with 1× NaMEI was used for pelleting assays because dodecyl sulfate precipitates as the potassium salt. For some studies, polymerization buffer without ATP was used, when studying the nucleotide dependence of depolymerization. 10E/1M = 10 mm EGTA/1 mm MgCl2, pH 7-8. Fluorescence buffer = 25 mm imidazole, pH-7, 25 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2,1 mm EGTA,100 mm DTT, 0.5% methylcellulose,18 μg/ml catalase, 3 μg/ml glucose, and 100 μg/ml glucose oxidase. Dual Color Filament Elongation Assay Using Fluorescence Microscopy—Unlabeled actin (4 μm) was polymerized for 2 h in polymerization buffer at 23 °C and then stabilized with 4 μm Alexa 488-phalloidin (Molecular Probes). To start the reaction, 2 μl of polymerized actin was incubated with 4 μl of polymerization buffer for 1 min at 23 °C followed by simultaneous addition of: 1) 3 μl of rhodamine phalloidin (5 μm) in polymerization buffer, 2) 2 μl of actin monomers (20 μm) in G-Mg, and 3) 0.4× KMEI in G-Mg to bring the volume to 40 μl. Profilin was premixed with actin monomers in reactions that used profilin. Aliquots were removed at various times and diluted 80-fold in fluorescence buffer. Samples (1.5 μl) were adsorbed to 0.01% poly-l-lysine-coated 12-mm round glass coverslips and examined for Alexa488 and TRITC label through a Nikon-Eclipse TE-2000 microscope with a 100× 1.4 numerical aperture objective. Images were acquired using a Roper Cool-Snap camera. Lengths of red filaments (newly elongated) emanating from green seeds were measured using MetaVue software (Universal Imaging Inc.). Pyrene-Actin Fluorescence Assay—Pyrene-labeled and unlabeled actin were mixed in G buffer to produce an actin stock of 5 μm containing 5% pyrene-labeled actin. This stock was converted to Mg2+ salt by incubation at 23 °C for 2 min in 0.1 volume of 10E/1M immediately before polymerization. When profilin was used, it was added at this step. Polymerization was initiated by the addition of INF2 in a solution of KMEI and G-Mg to result in a final concentration of 1× KMEI. Care was taken to ensure that none of the added proteins significantly altered the ionic strength or pH of the reaction. When phosphate (Pi) was added, it was from a stock of 200 mm NaPO4,pH 7.0. Pyrene fluorescence (excitation 365 nm, emission 407 nm) was monitored in a PC1 spectrofluorometer (ISS Inc., Champaign, IL) or an LS50B spectrofluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The time between final mixing and the start of data collection ranged between 10 and 15 s for each assay. Calculating Filament Concentration—Filament concentration was determined from slopes of pyrene fluorescence curves at 50% polymerization as described previously (24Higgs H.N. Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15212-15222Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). For several conditions (INF2-(FH1-FH2), INF2-(FH1-FH2-C), and INF2-(FH1-FH2-C) plus profilin, filament concentrations were adjusted to reflect the altered elongation rates measured in this study (Table 1).TABLE 1Effects of INF2 on actin nucleation and elongationConditionaActin = 1 μM, INF2 constructs = 2-40 nM, profilin = 5 μM.

Nucleation efficiency is very low in the absence of INF2. Open table in a new tab Labeling INF2-(C) and INF2-(FH1-FH2-C)—INF2-(C) was dialyzed for 2 h in 50mm NaCl, 2 mm NaPO4,pH7,0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA. Fluorescein 5′-maleimide (Molecular Probes) was added to 100 μm, and the reaction was incubated on ice for 5 min. Labeling was stopped by adding DTT to a concentration of 10 mm. Labeled protein was separated from free dye by Superdex 200 10/30-size exclusion chromatography (GE Healthcare). INF2-(FH1-FH2-C) was labeled similarly using 200 μm fluorescein 5′-maleimide for 15 min. Fluorescence Anisotropy Measurements—Fluorescein-labeled INF2-(C) (FL-INF2-(C)) was diluted to 22.2 nm in 1.11× K50MEI/G-Mg containing 50 μm thesit. Thesit, the common name for the detergent nonaethylene glycol monododecyl ether (Sigma, P-9641), was included to minimize protein adhesion to the cuvette. A stock of actin monomers with equimolar latrunculin A (Lat A) was prepared in G buffer. To 90 μl of FL-INF2-(C), 10 μl of actin solution was added, and fluorescence anisotropy was measured using a PC1 spectrofluorometer (ISS Inc.) with 495 nm excitation wavelength and a 520 ± 5 band pass emission filter (Omega Optics). Severing Assay—The severing assay was conducted as described previously (21Harris E.S. Li F. Higgs H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20076-20087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Actin (4 μm) was polymerized for 2 h at 23 °C in polymerization buffer. Polymerized actin (10 μl) was incubated with 10 μl of polymerization buffer containing INF2 for varying times at 23 °C. Polymerization buffer (20 μl) containing rhodamine-phalloidin (1 μm final concentration) was added, and samples were immediately diluted 200-fold with fluorescence buffer. Samples (1.5 μl) were adsorbed on 12-mm round glass coverslips coated with 0.01% poly-l-lysine. Pipetting of filaments was minimized, and the tapered pipette tips were cut with razorblades to minimize filament shearing by pipetting. Filaments were examined as described above through TRITC filter. Filament length was measured using MetaVue software, and 200-300 filaments were measured from at least four different fields. Determination of Steady-state Polymerized Actin Concentration—Actin stock (5 μm with 5% pyrene) was polymerized for 2 h in polymerization buffer. Polymerized actin was diluted to 1 μm actin in polymerization buffer along with the desired proteins. Controls were 2 μm LatAor50nm capping protein. Samples were incubated overnight (20-24 h) in the dark at 23 °C, and then pyrene fluorescence (excitation 365 nm, emission 407 nm) was measured. When used, 10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, was added to diluted filaments along with the protein. Beryllium Fluoride-Actin Filaments—Actin (20 μm with 5% pyrene) was polymerized for 4 h at 23 °C in polymerization buffer containing 5 mm sodium fluoride and 0.15 mm beryllium sulfate. The resulting beryllium fluoride (BeF)-bound filaments were used at 1 μm final concentration. Filament Depolymerization Kinetics—Actin (1.05 μm,5% pyrene) was polymerized for 24 h at 23 °C in polymerization buffer in the dark. Actin stock (95 μl) was gently mixed with 5 μl of protein solution in polymerization buffer. Pyrene fluorescence was monitored within 15 s of dilution. Initial slopes were measured and used to calculate the depolymerization rate. High Speed Pelleting Assay—This assay was as described elsewhere (6Harris E.S. Rouiller I. Hanein D. Higgs H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14383-14392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Actin (10 μm) was polymerized for 1 h at 23°C in polymerization buffer followed by the addition of 10 μm phalloidin (Sigma, P-2141). This phalloidin-bound actin stock was diluted to the desired concentration in polymerization buffer in the absence or presence of other proteins. Samples were centrifuged at 80,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min in a TLA-100.1 rotor (Beckman). Supernatants were lyophilized and resuspended in 0.1 volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Pellets were washed briefly with polymerization buffer and resuspended in 0.1 volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Supernatants and pellets were analyzed by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Analytical ultracentrifugation was conducted as described previously (6Harris E.S. Rouiller I. Hanein D. Higgs H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14383-14392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 21Harris E.S. Li F. Higgs H.N. J. Biol.

Pi Release Assay—To remove free ATP from actin solution, calcium-ATP-actin monomers were treated with Dowex AG 1-X2 resin, 100-200 mesh (Bio-Rad), equilibrated in ATP-free G buffer for 5 min on ice. 5 μm treated actin monomers were mixed with 0.5 μm mDia1, 0.5 μm INF2-(FH1-FH2-C) or with 10 μl of polymerized seeds in 1× KMEI. Inorganic phosphate (Pi) release from these experiments was monitored using the EnzChek Pi release assay kit (Molecular Probes) at 360 nm using a 600-μl sample volume. Nucleotide Exchange Assay—Calcium-ATP-actin monomers were converted to magnesium-ATP-actin in a 1/10 volume of 10E/1M for 5 min on ice. Free ATP was removed from magnesium-ATP-actin monomers by treatment with Dowex as described above. etheno-ATP (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes) was added to 0.25 mm (from a 5 mm stock) followed by incubation at 4 °C for 4 h. Actin was re-treated with Dowex to remove free etheno-ATP. This sample was kept on ice and used within 4 h. Nucleotide exchange reactions were conducted on 1.5 μm actin in a buffer of 1× K50MEI, with 1 mm ATP added. Actin was mixed with K50MEI containing INF2-(C) or profilin, and fluorescence (360 nm excitation, 410 nm emission) was recorded for 300 s. Concentrations of INF2-(C) tested were 1.5 and 3 μm (no effect on nucleotide exchange rate). Profilin was tested (1.5 μm) as a positive control and affected full nucleotide exchange within the 15-s dead time between mixing and fluorescence recording. Critical Concentration Measurements—Actin stock (6 μm, 5% pyrene) was first converted to Mg2+ salt by incubating it at 23 °C for 2 min in 10E/1M. This stock actin solution was then diluted in the range of 5 to 1 μm in polymerization buffer containing 0.2 mm ADP instead of ATP and the appropriate concentration of INF2-(FH1-FH2-C). Phosphate (10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0) was added where indicated. Samples were incubated overnight in the dark at 23 °C, and pyrene fluorescence (excitation 365 nm, emission 407 nm) was monitored. INF2 Contains an N-terminal DID—Previous searches of human and mouse databases suggested that the FH1 and FH2 domains of INF2 were at the N terminus (9Higgs H.N. Peterson K.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, subsequent data base searches revealed sequences that extend the open reading frame (ORF) considerably at the N terminus in chimpanzee (GenBank™ accession number XM_522946), rat (XM_343116), dog (XM_547999), and cow (XM_580659). All of these sequences are hypothetical protein entries derived from ORF predictions from the respective genomes. No similarly predicted ORFs exist for mouse or human at present. To test whether mouse INF2 contains an extended N terminus, we conducted reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis using mouse 300.19 cell total RNA. We found an ORF similar to those predicted for chimpanzee, rat, dog, and cow. The identified mouse ORF encodes a 1274-amino acid protein (supplemental Fig. 1). Sequence analysis reveals that, in addition to the FH1 and FH2 domains, INF2 contains a clear DID at its N terminus (Fig. 1A) and a putative DAD about 40 amino acids C-terminal to the FH2, a position similar to that found in other formins (Fig. 1B). Thus, the domain structure of INF2 appears similar to formins that are regulated by autoinhibition. INF2 FH2 Domain-containing Constructs Act Similarly to Other Formins—We tested the activities of two INF2 constructs (Fig. 1): one comprising the FH1 and FH2 domains (termed INF2-(FH1-FH2)) and one that also included the C-terminal region (INF2-(FH1-FH2-C)). Similar to other formins, these two FH2-containing constructs behave as dimers by analytical ultracentrifugation (supplemental Fig. 2). All formin FH2 domains tested to date affect actin filament elongation rate, but vary greatly in the degree of these effects. We studied the effects of INF2-(FH1-FH2) and INF2-(FH1-FH2-C) on actin filament elongation using a dual-labeled fluorescence microscopy assay in which prepolymerized filaments seeds labeled with “green” phalloidin are incubated with actin monomers and “red” phalloidin (25Harris E.S. Higgs H.N. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 406: 190-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Both INF2 constructs inhibit the barbed end elongation rate by about 90% (Fig. 2A, Table 1) and display apparent Kd values of <10 nm for barbed ends (not shown). These high affinities are similar to those measured for mDia1, FRL1, and mDia2 (6Harris E.S. Rouiller I. Hanein D. Higgs H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14383-14392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 21Harris E.S. Li F. Higgs H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20076-20087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In addition to slowing elongation, both INF2-(FH1-FH2) and INF2-(FH1-FH2-C) cause large increases in the number of short “red-only” filaments (supplemental Figs. 3 and 4), suggesting that they increase nucleation rate or cause filament severing. As with other formins, the INF2 FH1 domain contains multiple profilin-binding sites. Because profilin-bound FH1 domain increases barbed end elongation rate for all formins tested (4Kovar D.R.

It coordinates the peripheral clocks in the body, including the pineal clock that receives SCN input via a multisynaptic noradrenergic pathway. Rhythmic pineal melatonin production is disrupted in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we show that the clock genes hBmal1, hCry1, and hPer1 were rhythmically expressed in the pineal of controls (Braak 0). Moreover, hPer1 and hbeta1-adrenergic receptor (hbeta1-ADR) mRNA were positively correlated and showed a similar daily pattern. In contrast, in both preclinical (Braak I-II) and clinical AD patients (Braak V-VI), the rhythmic expression of clock genes was lost as well as the correlation between hPer1 and hbeta1-ADR mRNA. Intriguingly, hCry1 mRNA was increased in clinical AD. These changes are probably due to a disruption of the SCN control, as they were mirrored in the rat pineal deprived of SCN control. Indeed, a functional disruption of the SCN was observed from the earliest AD stages onward, as shown by decreased vasopressin mRNA, a clock-controlled major output of the SCN. Thus, a functional disconnection between the SCN and the pineal from the earliest AD stage onward could account for the pineal clock gene changes and underlie the circadian rhythm disturbances in AD."
https://openalex.org/W2130365699,"Serrated colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) are morphologically different from conventional CRCs and have been proposed to follow a distinct pathway of CRC formation. Despite studies of single molecular events in this tumor type, the diagnosis of serrated CRC relies on morphology and the putative unique biological character of these tumors has not been established. Here we show that the gene expression profiling of 37 CRCs separated serrated and conventional CRCs into two distinct branches in unsupervised hierarchical clustering (P-value 7.8 × 10−7), and revealed 201 differentially expressed genes representing potential biomarkers for serrated CRC. Immunohistochemistry was utilized to verify the key findings in the 37 CRCs examined by expression profiling, and a separate validation set of 37 serrated and 86 conventional CRCs was examined to evaluate the candidate biomarkers in an extended sample material. Ephrin receptor B2, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha and patched appeared as proteins important for genesis of serrated CRC. This study establishes serrated CRCs as a biologically distinct subclass of CRC and represents a step forward in the molecular classification of these cancers. The study also provides a platform to understand the molecular basis of serrated CRC and in long term may contribute to the development of specific treatment options for this tumor type."
https://openalex.org/W2101142595,"Amyloid beta protein (Abeta), the major component of neuritic plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD), is derived from APP by sequential cleavages of beta- and gamma-secretases. Beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the major beta-secretase in vivo. Beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 2 (BACE2) is the homologue of BACE1. The majority of people with Down syndrome (DS), also called Trisomy 21 syndrome, will develop AD neuropathology after middle age. We and others have shown that APP C99, the major beta-secretase product, and Abeta are markedly increased in DS. Since BACE2 is located on chromosome 21, it is speculated that BACE2 may play a role in AD pathogenesis in DS. In this report we found that BACE2 cleaves APP at a novel theta site downstream of the alpha site, abolishing Abeta production. Overexpression of BACE2 by lentivirus markedly reduced Abeta production in primary neurons derived from Swedish mutant APP transgenic mice. Despite an extra copy of the BACE2 gene in DS and the increase of its transcription, BACE2 protein levels are unchanged. Our data clearly demonstrate that BACE2, as a novel theta-secretase to cleave APP within the Abeta domain, is not involved in the AD pathogenesis of DS patients; instead, therapeutic interventions that potentiate BACE2 may prevent AD pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2034516137,"Saccharomyces boulardii (Sb), a probiotic yeast, protects against intestinal injury and inflammation caused by a wide variety of enteric pathogens, including Clostridium difficile. Given the broad range of protective effects of Sb in multiple gastrointestinal disorders, we hypothesize that Sb modulates host signaling pathways involved in intestinal inflammatory responses. In this study, we found that Sb culture supernatant (SbS) inhibits interleukin-8 production induced by C. difficile toxin A or IL-1β in human colonocyte NCM460 cells in a dose-dependent fashion. Furthermore, SbS inhibited IL-1β and toxin A induced Erk1/2 and JNK/SAPK but not p38 activation in NCM460 cells. To test whether this inhibition also occurs in vivo, we used a previously established mouse ileal loop model. On its own, SbS had no significant effect on basal fluid secretion or intestinal histology. However, Erk1/2 activation was significantly inhibited by SbS in toxin A exposed mouse ileal mucosa. In control loops, toxin A increased fluid secretion (2.2-fold), histological score (3.3-fold), and levels of the chemokine KC (4.5-fold). SbS pretreatment completely normalized toxin A mediated fluid secretion (p < 0.01), and histopathologic changes (p < 0.01) and substantially inhibited toxin A-associated KC increases (p < 0.001). In summary, the probiotic yeast S. boulardii inhibits C. difficile toxin A-associated enteritis by blocking the activation of Erk1/2 MAP kinases.

As intestinal inflammation is a common characteristic of C. difficile colitis, enterocolitis caused by many other human enteric pathogens, and Crohn's disease, the broad-ranging beneficial effects of S. boulardii led us to hypothesize that this probiotic yeast may act through modulation of host signaling pathways that regulate the intestinal mucosal inflammatory response. To study this, we tested the effect of Sb on MAP kinase signaling in human colonic epithelial cells in vitro as well as in mouse ileal loops in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Reagents—Human colonic epithelial cells NCM460 were maintained in M3D medium (INCELL Corp., San Antonio, TX), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Cells were cultured in a 37 °C humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Toxin A was purified to homogeneity from C. difficile strain 10463 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) as described previously (21Pothoulakis C. LaMont J.T. Eglow R. Gao N. Rubins J.B. Theoharides T.C. Dickey B.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recombinant human IL-1β was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Antibodies against MAP kinases (ERK1/2, P38, JNK/SAPK), and against phospho-specific MAP kinase were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA).Preparation of S. boulardii Culture Supernatant (SbS)—Lyophilized Sb was provided by Biocodex Laboratories, Montrouge, France and was cultured in RPMI 1640 cell culture medium (100 mg/ml) for 24 h in 37 °C. The suspension was then centrifuged at 9000 × g for 15 min and the supernatant collected. The supernatant was then passed through a 0.22-mm filter (Fisher Scientific) to remove yeast cells. We and others reported previously that Sb secrets large molecular weight proteins (>50 kDa) possessing biologic activity (16Pothoulakis C. Kelly C.P. Joshi M.A. Gao N. O'Keane C.J. Castagliuolo I.

Roux I. Rampal P. Gastroenterology. 1994; 106: 65-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To exclude activity arising from those molecules, we passed the filtered supernatant through a 10-kDa cutoff filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The resulting fraction was termed Sb supernatant (SbS).IL-8 Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—IL-8 protein levels were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, as described previously (25Keates S. Sougioultzis S. Keates A.C. Zhao D. Peek Jr., R.M. Shaw L.M. Kelly C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48127-48134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In brief, after incubation, aliquots of conditioned media were added to NUNC Maxisorp 96-well plates (Nunc Inc., Naperville, IL) precoated with goat anti-IL-8 (R&D Systems) overnight at 4 °C and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. IL-8 release was then assayed using a biotinylated anti-IL-8 antibody (R&D Systems). The presence of SbS in the cell supernatant does not interfere with the cytokine assay directly as previous reported (26Sougioultzis S. Simeonidis S. Bhaskar K.R. Chen X. Anton P.M. Keates S. Pothoulakis C. Kelly C.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 343: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Results were expressed as mean ± S.E. (ng/ml). At least three independent experiments were performed for each experimental condition, each with triplicate measurements.Western Blotting—NCM460 cells were stimulated with Toxin A (3 nm) or recombinant human IL-1β (10 ng/ml), in the presence or absence of SbS for different time periods. Treated cells were then lysed in a lysis buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol). Equal amounts of cell extract were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) at 300 mA for 3 h. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dried milk in TBST (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and then incubated with antibodies directed against ERK1/2, phospho-ERK1/2, JNK/SAPK, phospho-JNK/SAPK, P38, and phospho-P38 (Cell Signaling). Membranes were washed with TBST and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies for 1 h. The peroxidase signal was detected by Supersignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce), and the image of the signal was recorded by exposure to x-ray film (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan).Toxin A Ileal Loop Experiments—Mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (0.9 ml, 100 mg/ml) and xylazine (0.1 ml, 100 mg/ml) in 9 ml of saline at a dose of 0.15 ml/20 g of body weight. A laparotomy was then performed, and one 3- to 5-cm-long loop was formed at the terminal ileum as previously described (27Castagliuolo I. Riegler M. Pasha A. Nikulasson S. Lu B. Gerard C. Gerard N.P. Pothoulakis C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Mouse ileal loops were injected with 150 μl of SbS or vehicle (RPMI). After 30 min, loops were injected with either 0.15 ml of 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 μg of purified toxin A or Tris buffer alone (control). The abdomen was then closed, and animals were placed on a heating pad at 37 °C for the duration of the experiment. At 0.5, 1, and 2 h, some animals (n = 3 per group) were killed by CO2 inhalation, and loops were collected for Western blot analysis. 4 h after toxin A injection, the remaining animals (n = 7 per group) were killed, and fluid secretion was estimated as the loop weight-to-length ratio as described (27Castagliuolo I.

Ileal tissue samples were fixed in formalin, paraffin-embedded, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Histologic scoring (epithelial necrosis, mucosal congestion and edema, and neutrophil infiltration) of the ileal tissue sections was performed by a single pathologist (M. O'Brien) in a blinded fashion, using a scoring system as described previously (27Castagliuolo I. Riegler M. Pasha A. Nikulasson S. Lu B. Gerard C. Gerard N.P. Pothoulakis C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Ileal tissue levels of the murine CXC chemokine KC were evaluated by a commercial ELISA (R&D Systems). Animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.Statistical Analyses—Results were expressed as mean ± S.E. Data were analyzed using the SIGMA-STAT™ professional statistics software program (Jandel Scientific Software, San Rafael, CA). Analyses of variance with protected t test were used for intergroup comparison.RESULTSSbS Inhibited IL-8 Secretion by IL-1β or C. difficile Toxin A-stimulated Human Colonic Epithelial Cells—NCM460 cells, a human colonocyte cell line, were serum-starved overnight and then stimulated with recombinant human IL-1β (10 ng/ml) or toxin A (1 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of serial 2-fold dilutions of SbS. After 12-h incubation, the cell conditioned media were collected and IL-8 protein levels measured by ELISA. As illustrated in Fig. 1 resting NCM460 cells released little IL-8 protein while stimulation with IL-1β (Fig. 1A) or toxin A (Fig. 1B) markedly increased IL-8 protein production. The presence of SbS significantly reduced IL-8 production in toxin A or IL-1β-stimulated NCM460 cells, in a dose-dependent fashion.SbS Inhibited IL-1β-induced Erk1/2 and JNK/SAPK but Not p38 Activation in NCM460 Cells—MAP kinases regulate cell survival and cytokine production in response to stress and are an important pathway for the regulation of IL-8 production. As shown in Fig. 2, IL-1β induced Erk1/2, JNK/SAPK, and p38 phosphorylation in NCM460 cells at various time points. The presence of SbS inhibited activation of Erk1/2 and JNK/SAPK but had no evident effect on p38 activation.FIGURE 2Inhibition of IL-1β-induced MAP kinase activation by SbS. NCM460 colonocytes were serum-starved for 24 h and then incubated with IL-1β (10 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of SbS (1:1, v/v). Cells were collected and lysed at different time points and total protein was fractionated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and probed with antibodies against Erk1/2, phosho-Erk1/2, JNK-SAPK, phospho-JNK/SAPK, p38, and phospho-p38.

Activation of p38 MAP kinase by toxin A in enterocytes has also been reported. However, the ability of toxin A to activate Erk or JNK MAP kinases in human colonocytes has not been reported. As shown in Fig. 3, toxin A (3 nm) induced Erk1/2, SAPK/JNK, and p38 phosphorylation at varying time points. As for IL-1β, SbS inhibited Erk1/2 and JNK/SAPJ activation induced by toxin A but had no significant effect on p38 activation.FIGURE 3Inhibition of C. difficile toxin A induced MAP kinase activation by SbS. NCM460 colonocytes were serum-starved for 24 h and incubated with toxin A (3 nm) in the presence or absence of SbS (1:1, v/v).

After 0.5, 1, and 2 h, mouse loop tissues were collected. Homogenized tissues were run on SDS-PAGE and blotted for the presence of MAP kinases. As shown in Fig. 4, toxin A strongly induced Erk activation in vivo at 0.5 and 1 h after toxin inoculation. SbS pretreatment significantly inhibited that activation at both the 0.5 and 1 h time points (p < 0.01). After 2 h there was minimal persisting Erk activation by toxin A. Toxin A treatment also increased JNK/SAPK activation in ileal mucosal tissues after 0.5 h and this was again prevented by SbS pretreatment (Fig. 5). There was no significant increase in JNK/SAPK activation at the 1 h and 2 h time points. SbS had no evident effect on p38 activation at any of the three time points examined (Fig. 5), consistent with what we observed in our in vitro experiments.FIGURE 4Effect of SbS on Erk1/2 activation in toxin A-treated mouse ileal loops. Closed ileal loops were prepared in the distal ileum of anesthetized CD1 mice (n = 3 mice per group) and injected with SbS or RPMI 30 min prior to toxin A (10 μg) or buffer administration.

S. boulardii has been used safely for many decades and in millions of patients to protect against intestinal injury, inflammation, and secretion caused by a wide variety of bacterial enteric pathogens including C. difficile (9Elmer G.W. Surawicz C.M. McFarland L.V. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1996; 275: 870-876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sullivan A. Nord C.E. Int. J. Antimicrob. Agents. 2002; 20: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In a recent controlled trial S. boulardii was also effective in reducing clinical relapse in Crohn disease (11Guslandi M. Mezzi G. Sorghi M. Testoni P.A. Dig. Dis. Sci. 2000; 45: 1462-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar).The specific cellular and molecular mechanisms for the protective and therapeutic effects of probiotic agents such as S. boulardii in enteric infections and in inflammatory bowel disease in humans are not well known. The broad-ranging beneficial effects of S. boulardii led us to hypothesize that this probiotic yeast may act through modulation of host signaling pathways that regulate intestinal mucosal inflammatory, secretory, and barrier functions. We report here that S. boulardii exerts its anti-inflammatory activity, in part, by modulating host MAP kinase signaling pathways, both in vitro and in vivo.We showed that S. boulardii conditioned media inhibited IL-8 production induced by either IL-1β or toxin A in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 1). Our recent report indicated that the inhibitory effect of SbS is reversible and not associated with loss of cell viability or protein production (26Sougioultzis S. Simeonidis S. Bhaskar K.R. Chen X. Anton P.M. Keates S. Pothoulakis C. Kelly C.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 343: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It is known that MAP kinases regulate IL-8 production in response to proinflammatory cytokines or lipopolysaccharide (31Holtmann H. Winzen R. Holland P. Eickemeier S. Hoffmann E. Wallach D.

We now show that the activation of Erk1/2 and JNK/SAPK by both IL-1β and toxin A are inhibited by the presence of SbS in human colonocytes (Figs. 2 and 3). SbS also significantly inhibits Erk1/2 activation in toxin A-treated mouse ileal loops (Fig. 4). A similar inhibitory effect is evident for JNK/SAPK activation but is significant only at early time points after exposure to toxin A (Fig. 5). Interestingly, SbS did not affect the activation of p38 in NCM460 cells stimulated by IL-1β or toxin A (Figs. 2 and 3) nor did it affect p38 activation in vivo (Fig. 5). Samples from the in vivo mouse ileal loop experiments used for Western blot consisted of homogenized full thickness ileal tissues. Thus, the activated MAPK signals that we detected were the sum total of signals from all cell types not just intestinal epithelial cells. Nonetheless, the degree of SbS inhibition of activation on these three MAP kinases in vivo are consistent with its effect in NCM460 cells in vitro with greatest inhibition of Erk1/2 kinase activation and no significant effect on p38 activation. Since these three main MAP kinase families form three parallel cascades that can be activated simultaneously or independently (33Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J.

In this study we used orally active C5a receptor antagonists (PMX53 and PMX205) developed in our laboratories in a rat model of 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) -induced Huntington's disease. Administration of the C5a antagonists (10 mg/kg/day, oral) either 48 h pre- or 48 h post-toxin significantly reduced body weight loss, anorexia, and behavioral and motor deficits associated with 3-NP intoxication. Striatal lesion size, apoptosis, neutrophil infiltration, and hemorrhage were also significantly reduced in C5a antagonist-treated rats. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated marked deposition of C3 and C9, and up-regulation of C5a receptors on neuronal cells at the time of lesion formation. Inhibition of prostaglandins or TNF-alpha with ibuprofen or infliximab had no effect in this model. The C5a antagonists did not affect 3-NP-induced cell death when added directly to rat striatal neuronal cultures, indicating a secondary mechanism of action in vivo. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that complement activation in the brain, particularly C5a, is a key event in the pathogenesis of this disease model, and suggest a future role for inhibitors of C5a in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases."

MIG-6 is a negative regulator of epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling, and we show that Mig-6 – like EGF – is induced by hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) in human lung cancer cell lines. Frequently, the receptors for both factors, EGFR and Met, are expressed in same lung cancer cell line, and MIG-6 is induced by both factors in a mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent fashion. However, not all tumor lines express MIG-6 in response to either EGF or HGF/SF. In these cases, we find missense and nonsense mutations in the MIG-6 coding region, as well as evidence for MIG-6 transcriptional silencing. Moreover, germline disruption of Mig-6 in mice leads to the development of animals with epithelial hyperplasia, adenoma, and adenocarcinoma in organs like the lung, gallbladder, and bile duct. These data suggests that MIG-6 is a tumor-suppressor gene and is therefore a candidate gene for the frequent 1p36 genetic alterations found in lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2042657642,"Deregulated expression of BCL6 is a pathogenic event in many lymphomas. BCL6 blocks cellular differentiation by repressing transcription of its target genes, and this may promote tumorigenesis. Conversely, the transcription factor signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)5 promotes differentiation in many systems. STAT5 upregulates a number of genes repressed by BCL6, raising the possibility that STAT5 and BCL6 have opposing roles in transcriptional regulation. Therefore, we sought to determine the effects of STAT5 activation on BCL6 expression and function. We found that activation of STAT5 downregulates BCL6 expression in B-lymphoma cells and other hematopoietic cell lines. We identified two potential STAT-binding regions in the first exon and first intron of BCL6 that fell within regions of high inter-species homology, suggesting conservation of regulatory function. STAT5 can bind inducibly and regulate transcription at one of these regions, identifying BCL6 as a STAT5 target gene. Additionally, STAT5-mediated downregulation of BCL6 results in loss of BCL6 repression of its target genes, confirming that STAT5 is a negative regulator of BCL6 function. The STAT5 responsive region of the BCL6 gene is mutated frequently in B-cell lymphomas, suggesting that loss of the repressive effects of STAT5 on BCL6 might contribute to the pathogenesis of these cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2123353940,"Diabetes alters microvascular structure and function and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. In diabetic skeletal muscle, impaired angiogenesis and reduced VEGF-A expression have been observed, whereas in healthy muscle exercise is known to have opposite effects. We studied the effects of type 1 diabetes and combined exercise training on angiogenic mRNA expression and capillarization in mouse skeletal muscle. Microarray and real-time PCR analyses showed that diabetes altered the expression of several genes involved in angiogenesis. For example, levels of proangiogenic VEGF-A, VEGF-B, neuropilin-1, VEGFR-1, and VEGFR-2 were reduced and the levels of antiangiogenic thrombospondin-1 and retinoblastoma like-2 were increased. Exercise training alleviated some of these changes, but could not completely restore them. VEGF-A protein content was also reduced in diabetic muscles. In line with the reduced levels of VEGF-A and other angiogenic factors, and increased levels of angiogenesis inhibitors, capillary-to-muscle fiber ratio was lower in diabetic mice compared to healthy controls. Exercise training could not restore capillarization in diabetic mice. In conclusion, these data illustrate that type 1 diabetes is associated with reduced skeletal muscle capillarization and the dysregulation of complex angiogenesis pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2031775632,"The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR)-induced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation on basal and insulin-stimulated glucose and fatty acid metabolism in isolated rat adipocytes. AICAR-induced AMPK activation profoundly inhibited basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, lipogenesis, glucose oxidation, and lactate production in fat cells. We also describe the novel findings that AICAR-induced AMPK phosphorylation significantly reduced palmitate (32%) and oleate uptake (41%), which was followed by a 50% reduction in palmitate oxidation despite a marked increase in AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphorylation. Compound C, a selective inhibitor of AMPK, not only completely prevented the inhibitory effect of AICAR on palmitate oxidation but actually caused a 2.2-fold increase in this variable. Compound C also significantly increased palmitate oxidation in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of malonyl-CoA and etomoxir indicating an increase in CPT1 activity. In contrast to skeletal muscle in which AMPK stimulates fatty acid oxidation to provide ATP as a fuel, we propose that AMPK activation inhibits lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation in adipocytes. Inhibition of lipogenesis would conserve ATP under conditions of cellular stress, although suppression of intra-adipocyte oxidation would spare fatty acids for exportation to other tissues where their utilization is crucial for energy production. Additionally, the stimulatory effect of compound C on long chain fatty acid oxidation provides a novel pharmacological approach to promote energy dissipation in adipocytes, which may be of therapeutic importance for obesity and type II diabetes."

We investigated the actions of TNFalpha toward stimulation of PGE2 synthesis in primary spinal cord neurons. TNFalpha induced COX-2 and mPGES-1 expression in neurons, followed by formation of PGE2, which was blocked by a selective COX-2 inhibitor. Surprisingly, the ""selective COX-1"" inhibitor SC-560 completely inhibited TNFalpha-induced PGE2 synthesis in neurons at nanomolar concentrations. Moreover, SC-560 inhibited PGE2 and thromboxane A2 synthesis in human monocytes and platelets with IC50 of 1.8 nM and 2.5 nM, respectively. SC-560 treatment neither altered TNFalpha-induced COX-2 or mPGES-1 expression nor did the addition of the calcium ionophore A23187 or arachidonic acid reverse the inhibition by SC-560. Moreover, no influence of SC-560 on PGE2 synthase activities or PGE2 transport was seen. Most importantly, SC-560 blocked TNFalpha-induced PGE2 synthesis in COX-1-deficient spinal cord neurons, demonstrating a COX-1-independent inhibition of PGE2 synthesis. Although SC-560 inhibited LPS-induced PGE2 synthesis in neurons and RAW264.7 macrophages in whole cell assays, no inhibition was observed in lysates of the same cells. Taken together our data demonstrate that SC-560 acts at least in some cell types as an unselective COX inhibitor despite its selectivity toward COX-1 under cell-free conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2050084368,"Protein inhibitors of activated STATs (PIAS) family members are ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase-small ubiquitin-like modifier ligases for diverse transcription factors. However, the regulation of PIAS protein activity in cells is poorly understood. Previously, we reported that expression of Trim32, a RING domain ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase-ubiquitin ligase mutated in human limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2H (LGMD2H) and Bardet-Biedl syndrome, is elevated during mouse skin carcinogenesis, protecting keratinocytes from apoptosis induced by UVB and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha). Here we report that Trim32 interacts with Piasy and promotes Piasy ubiquitination and degradation. Ubiquitination of Piasy by Trim32 could be reproduced in vitro using purified components. Their interaction was induced by treatment with UVB/TNFalpha and involved redistribution of Piasy from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it accumulated in cytoplasmic granules that colocalized with Trim32. Piasy destabilization and ubiquitination required an intact RING domain in Trim32. The LGMD2H-associated missense point mutation prevented Trim32 binding to Piasy, and human Piasy failed to colocalize with human Trim32 in fibroblasts isolated from an LGMD2H patient. Trim32 expression increased the transcriptional activity of NFkappaB in epidermal keratinocytes, both under basal treatment and after UVB/TNFalpha treatment. Conversely, Piasy inhibited NFkappaB activity under the same conditions and sensitized keratinocytes to apoptosis induced by TNFalpha and UVB. Our results indicate that, by controlling Piasy stability, Trim32 regulates UVB-induced keratinocyte apoptosis through induction of NFkappaB and suggests loss of function of Trim32 in LGMD2H."

The function of A20 in smooth muscle cells (SMC) is unknown. We demonstrate that A20 is induced in SMC in response to inflammatory stimuli and serves an anti-inflammatory function via blockade of NF-kappaB and NF-kappaB-dependent proteins ICAM-1 and MCP-1. A20 inhibits SMC proliferation via increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21waf1 and p27kip1. Surprisingly, A20 sensitizes SMC to cytokine- and Fas-mediated apoptosis through a novel NO-dependent mechanism. In vivo, adenoviral delivery of A20 to medial rat carotid artery SMC after balloon angioplasty prevents neointimal hyperplasia by blocking SMC proliferation and accelerating re-endothelialization, without causing apoptosis. However, expression of A20 in established neointimal lesions leads to their regression through increased apoptosis. This is the first demonstration that A20 exerts two levels of control of vascular remodeling and healing. A20 prevents neointimal hyperplasia through combined anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative functions in medial SMC. If SMC evade this first barrier and neointima is formed, A20 has a therapeutic potential by uniquely sensitizing neointimal SMC to apoptosis. A20-based therapies hold promise for the prevention and treatment of neointimal disease."

We observed that the level of nitrated and hyperphosphorylated tau was markedly increased in rat hippocampus 24 h after drug administration, and these alterations were prevented by preinjection of uric acid, a natural scavenger of peroxynitrite. Concomitantly, we detected a significant activation in glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) and p38 MAPKs, including p38alpha, p38beta, and p38delta, but no obvious change was measured in the activity of p38gamma, ERK, and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK). Both nitrated tau and hyperphosphorylated tau were aggregated in the hippocampus, in which the activity of 20S proteasome was significantly arrested in SIN-1-injected rats. Further studies demonstrated that the hyperphosphorylated tau was degraded as efficiently as normal tau by 20S proteasome, but the nitrated tau with an unorderly secondary structure became more resistant to the proteolysis. These results provide the first in vivo evidence showing that peroxynitrite simultaneously induces tau hyperphosphorylation, nitration, and accumulation, and that activation of GSK-3beta, p38alpha, p38beta, p38delta isoforms and the inhibition of proteasome activity are respectively responsible for the peroxynitrite-induced tau hyperphosphorylation and accumulation. Our findings reveal a common upstream stimulator and a potential therapeutic target for Alzheimer-like neurodegeneration."

These processes are stimulated by a variety of growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF-induced cytoskeletal reorganization plays a crucial role in the angiogenic processes. In the present study, we evaluated the role of calpain in VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMEC) were incubated with VEGF (10-60 ng/ml) for 2-24 h, after which we measured calpain activities, protein contents of the calpain subunits and of calpastatin, endothelial monolayer wound repair, tube formation, and actin cytoskeleton changes. Incubation of PMEC with VEGF resulted in dose- and time-dependent increases in calpain activity and protein content of calpain-2. VEGF did not change the protein contents of calpain-1 and the small subunit or of calpastatin. Incubation of PMEC with a VEGF receptor blocker prevented the VEGF-induced increase in calpain activity. Inhibition of calpain activity by siRNA directed against calpain-2 and by overexpression of calpastatin prevented VEGF-induced increases in actin stress fibers in endothelial cells and angiogenesis. Overexpression of calpastatin also inhibits vessel formation in subcutaneous (s.c.) matrigel plugs in mice. These results indicate that calpain mediates VEGF-induced angiogenic effects by modulating actin cytoskeletal organization."

Here we show that beta-secretase activity is markedly elevated in DS. The ratio of mature to immature forms of BACE1 is altered in DS. DS has significantly higher levels of mature BACE1 proteins in Golgi than normal controls. Time-lapse live image analysis showed that BACE1 proteins were predominantly immobile in Golgi in DS cells, while they underwent normal trafficking in controls. Thus, overproduction of Abeta in DS is caused by abnormal BACE1 protein trafficking and maturation.

Little is understood regarding other signaling mechanisms initiated by PGF2α that account for the actions of PGF2α in the CL. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein is a key regulator of protein translation via mechanisms involving the phosphorylation of the translation regulator eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) -binding protein (4EBP1) and the 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 protein kinase 1 (S6K1) (15Hay N. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1926-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (3461) Google Scholar, 16Fingar D.C. Richardson C.J. Tee A.R. Cheatham L. Tsou C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 200-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). The activity of mTOR is regulated by inputs from multiple signaling pathways that appropriately increase or decrease protein synthesis. Although the activation of mTOR has been well characterized in response to growth factors acting via receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated stimulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling, less information is available on the mechanisms used by GPCRs to stimulate mTOR and the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and S6K1 (17Tang X. Wang L. Proud C.G. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In quiescent cells, 4EBP1 acts as a translational repressor by binding tightly to the 7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap-binding protein. The phosphorylation of 4EBP1 by mTOR promotes its release from eIF4E (18Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar) and allows recruitment of mRNAs with a m7G cap to the ribosome (15Hay N. Sonenberg N.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 695-717Google Scholar). Once activated by mTOR, S6K1 phosphorylates the small ribosomal protein S6 in a step that is postulated to further enhance the efficiency of functional ribosomes (21Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 695-717Google Scholar). Evidence for the role of mTOR/S6K1 signaling in translational control has come largely from studies involving the macrolide antibiotic rapamycin (22Jefferies H.B. Fumagalli S. Dennis P.B. Reinhard C. Pearson R.B. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3693-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Rapamycin binds directly to FKBP12 (FK506-binding protein 12 kDa) (23Koltin Y. Faucette L. Bergsma D.J. Levy M.A. Cafferkey R. Koser P.L. Johnson R.K. Livi G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1718-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and the FKBP12rapamycin complex binds to and deactivates the mTOR enzyme. Through its highly effective and specific effects on mTOR, rapamycin has proven to be an invaluable tool for investigating mTOR function, S6K1 function, and translation (reviewed in Refs. 15Hay N. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1926-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (3461) Google Scholar and 24Crespo J.L. Hall M.N. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 579-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The effects of rapamycin include inhibition of cap-dependent translation, inhibition of 4EBP1 phosphorylation and S6K1 activity, as well as inhibition of cell proliferation and cell growth. The activity of mTOR is negatively controlled by the tumor suppressors tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1, also known as hamartin) and TSC2 (also known as tuberin) (25Martin D.E. Hall M.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 26Kwiatkowski D.J. Manning B.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: R251-R258Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 27Tee A.R. Blenis J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Epistatic analysis and biochemical studies indicate that AKT-dependent phosphorylation of TSC2 prevents the TSC2-dependent inhibition of mTOR signaling. Whereas PI3K/AKT appears to be the major growth factor-mediated signal that controls TSC2 phosphorylation and mTOR activation, TSC2 is also phosphorylated on other residues by the activation of PKC, MEK1, Erk, and p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK1), which apparently contributes to AKT-independent mTOR activation (16Fingar D.C. Richardson C.J. Tee A.R. Cheatham L. Tsou C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 200-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 28Naegele S. Morley S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46023-46034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Notably, the tumor promoter PMA stimulates the phosphorylation of TSC2(Ser1798) and the activation of mTOR/S6K1 by an Erkmediated and RSK1-dependent process (29Roux P.P. Ballif B.A. Anjum R. Gygi S.P. Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13489-13494Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). However, specific GPCR ligands that induce TSC2 phosphorylation and mTOR/S6K activity by AKT-independent mechanisms have not been identified. The present experiments were performed to determine if activation of PGF2α receptors stimulates the phosphorylation of TSC2 and activation of mTOR/S6K1 signaling. Herein, we provide the first evidence that PGF2α stimulates the phosphorylation of TSC2 and the activation of S6K1 by an AKT-independent, Erk-dependent mechanism. We show that stimulation of S6K1 by PGF2α treatment is rapamycin-sensitive. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PGF2α stimulates the phosphorylation of mTOR substrates and regulates proteins involved in the initiation of translation in luteal cells. Taken together, our data suggest that PGF2α signaling promotes activation of the mTOR/S6K1 pathway leading to activation of the translational apparatus.

U0126 was obtained from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA). The recombinant adenovirus Ad.dnMEK1 was obtained from Dr. J. Han (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). In the Ad.dnMEK1 vector, the MEK1 cDNA has been altered and two crucial serine residues located in the catalytic domain (Ser217 and Ser221) were replaced by alanines. The resulting MEK1 mutant has dominant negative activity and can be used to block the activation of ERK1/2 by wild-type MEK1 as described (30Yan Y. Spieker R.S. Kim M. Stoeger S.M. Cowan K.H. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 3285-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Isolation and Culture of Bovine Luteal Cells—Ovaries from cows were obtained from a local abattoir and processed as previously described (31Chakravorty A. Joslyn M.I. Davis J.S. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Luteal tissue was dissociated with type II collagenase (103 units/ml) (Atlantic Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA) in basal medium (M199 (Cambrex, Walkersville, MD) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 100 units/ml penicillin-G-sodium, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 10 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate). Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion, and only those cell preparations with viability exceeding 90% were used. Enriched bovine steroidogenic luteal cells (bLCs) were plated (∼1 × 105 cells/cm2) in basal medium and 5% FBS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 24 h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Cells were serum-starved in basal medium for 24 h. Following replacement with fresh medium, the cells were allowed to equilibrate for 3–4 h prior to initiation of treatments. Experimental Conditions and Preparation of Cell Extracts—Cells were treated as described in the figure legends. Experiments were stopped by rapidly rinsing the cells with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and treatment for 20 min on ice with lysis buffer A (10 mm KPO4, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% deoxycholate, and DVPLA (2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and 10 μg/ml aprotinin)). The bLCs were scraped from the plates and briefly vortexed. Cell lysates were sonicated with a 5-s pulse followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 × g. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Samples were processed immediately for experiments involving immunoprecipitation and immunocomplex protein kinase assays or frozen at –80 °C until analysis. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins (40 μg/lane) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes prior to immunoblot analysis. Equivalent loading was verified by Ponceau staining. Membranes were blocked in 5% fat-free milk in TBST (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20) for 1 h and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary Ab in TBST plus 5% bovine serum albumin. After three 5-min washes with TBST, membranes were incubated in appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Ab for 1 h at room temperature. Membrane-bound antibodies were detected with the Western Lightning™ ECL detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences Inc.) and signals visualized using x-ray film or a Kodak Digital Sciences Image Station 440. Immunoprecipitation and Immune Complex Protein Kinase Assays—Cells (7.5 × 106) were lysed in 0.5 ml of buffer A. Tuberin was immunoprecipitated from lysates (500 μg of protein) overnight at 4 °C in a final volume of 500 μl containing anti-tuberin antibody (1:100). After washing extensively, the immune complex was boiled in 2× sample buffer and fractionated on 7% SDS-PAGE gels. Immunoprecipitation with Ab for 4EBP1 (1:100) was performed as above. Immune complexes were boiled in 2× sample buffer and fractionated on 13% SDSPAGE gels. The activity of S6K1 was determined as previously described (32Romanelli A. Martin K.A. Toker A. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2921-2928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Masuda-Robens J. Krymskaya V.P. Qi H. Chou M.M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Lysates were precleared by tumbling for 1 h at 4 °C with 40 μl of packed volume protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The samples were centrifuged briefly, and the supernatant was removed to new tubes containing 20-μl packed volume protein A-Sepharose beads. Total S6K1 was immunoprecipitated from lysates (500 μg of protein) overnight at 4 °C in a volume of 500 μl containing polyclonal anti-S6K1 antibody (1:100). Immunocomplexes were washed by resuspending in detergent wash (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, and DVPLA), followed by a high salt wash (1 m NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, and DVPLA). Immune complexes were washed a third time in Tris-saline buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm Tris-Base, and DVPLA). The immune complexes were resuspended in 20 μl of 1.5× kinase buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 15 mm MgCl2, 0.15 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.325 μl/ml freshly added β-mercaptoethanol (0.011% final)). To each reaction, 10 μl of H2O containing 2 μg of GST-S6 fusion protein (32Romanelli A. Martin K.A. Toker A. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2921-2928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (4500 Ci/mmol) (ICN, Irvine, CA) and 50 μm ATP were added. Reactions were vortexed briefly and incubated for 5 min at 30 °C, followed by vortexing and incubating at 30 °C for another 5 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 6 μl of 6× Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by 10% SDSPAGE. Gels were dried, exposed to Kodak X-OMAT AR film, and quantified using a Kodak Image Station 440. Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase (PI3K) Assays—Following treatment, bLCs were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed, and PI3K assays were performed essentially as previously described (31Chakravorty A. Joslyn M.I. Davis J.S. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Reaction products were separated by TLC, scraped from the plates, and quantified by scintillation counting. 7-Methyl-guanosine (m7G) Pulldown Assays—Following treatment, bLCs were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline followed by lysis in buffer B (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm TrisHCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The lysate was precleared by tumbling for 1 h at 4°C with 40 μl of washed protein A-Sepharose beads. Aliquots of lysate (500 μg) were added to a 20-μl packed volume of 7-methyl-guanosine (m7G)-conjugated Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Samples were tumbled at 4 °C for 18 h followed by three washes in 500 μl of buffer B. Samples were boiled in 20 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer, separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels, and Western blot analysis was performed to determine co-precipitating 4EBP1, eIF4E, and eIF4G proteins. 32P and 35S Metabolic Labeling—For 32P metabolic labeling studies, bLCs (2.5 × 106) were incubated in PO4-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) for 1 h followed by a prelabeling period of 2 h in the presence of 1 mCi/ml [32P]HPO3 (ICN, Irvine, CA). The cells were pretreated for 30 min with or without rapamycin (20 nm) prior to 15 min of treatment with control media, PGF2α or FBS. Immunoprecipitation with Ab for either 4EBP1 (1:100) or S6K1 (1:100) was performed as described above. For 35S metabolic labeling studies, bLCs (2.5 × 106) were incubated for 2 h in 1 ml of cysteine/methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) followed by a prelabeling period of 2 h with 1 mCi/ml [35S]Cys/Met Trans-label (ICN, Irvine, CA). The cells were pretreated for 15 min with or without rapamycin (20 nm) prior to treatment for 240 min with control media, PGF2α, or FBS. Ribosomal protein S6 was immunoprecipitated (1:100), radioactive products were separated by SDS-PAGE and exposed to x-ray film. PGF2α Stimulates Timeand Concentration-dependent Phosphorylation of S6K1—We observed a rapid induction of S6K1 phosphorylation on Thr421/Ser424 and Thr389 residues (Fig. 1A) in response to a maximally effective concentration of PGF2α (1 μm). Maximal phosphorylation (comparable to 15-min treatment with 10% FCS as a positive control) was observed at each site in as little as 5–15 min. Phosphorylation on Thr421/Ser424 and Thr389 residues of S6K1 persisted beyond 90 min, albeit to a lesser extent. The temporal pattern of S6K1 phosphorylation at Thr421/Ser424 was similar to the temporal pattern observed for Erk1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 1A). Maximal phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and S6K1 (Thr421/Ser424) was observed within 2–5 min following PGF2α treatment, whereas maximal phosphorylation of S6K1(Thr389) was observed only after 15–30 min of treatment. Unlike treatment with FCS, treatment bLCs with PGF2α did not induce phosphorylation of AKT (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, treatment of bLCs for 0–60 min with PGF2α (1 μm) did not result in an increase in PI3K activity (data not shown). Similar to previous observations (31Chakravorty A. Joslyn M.I. Davis J.S. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) treatment of bLCs for 15 min with IGF-I (50 ng/ml) stimulated increases (4-fold, n = 3) in PI3K activity. Treatment of bLCs for 15 min with increasing concentrations of PGF2α (0–1 μm) (Fig. 1B) induced concentration-dependent phosphorylation of S6K1 on Thr421/Ser424 and Thr389 residues, and maximal phosphorylation was observed with 10–100 nm PGF2α. As little as 1 nm PGF2α was sufficient to stimulate S6K1 phosphorylation on Thr421/Ser424 and Thr389 residues. PGF2α stimulated a similar concentration-response pattern of Erk1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). The phosphorylation of AKT was not observed following treatment with any concentration of PGF2α (not shown). PGF2α Stimulates S6K1 Activity—Immune complex protein kinase assays were performed to determine S6K1 enzymatic activity in response to PGF2α treatment (Fig. 1C). The time course of S6K1 activity in response to treatment with PGF2α (1 μm) is shown as an individual experiment (Fig. 1C) and as a summary of three experiments in Fig. 1D. A 2.5-fold (p < 0.05, n = 3) increase in S6K1 activity was observed following 5 min of PGF2α treatment. Maximal increases in S6K1 activity were observed within 15 min of treatment with PGF2α and S6K1 activity returned to basal levels after 60 min of treatment. Treatment of bLCs with FCS (10%, 15 min) also increased S6K1 activity, which was consistently greater than S6K1 activity observed in response to treatment with PGF2α (Fig. 1E). PGF2α-stimulated S6K1 Phosphorylation and Activation Are Rapamycin-sensitive—Experiments were conducted to determine if S6K1 phosphorylation in response to PGF2α (1 μm), PMA (20 nm, a PKC activator), and FCS (10%) was sensitive to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Pretreatment with rapamycin abolished phosphorylation at the Thr389 site (Fig. 1F). However, phosphorylation of S6K1 on Thr421/Ser424 residues was only partially reduced by rapamycin pretreatment. The mobility of S6K1 in SDS-PAGE gels, as observed with the phosphoS6K1(Thr421/Ser424) antibody, was increased by the presence of rapamycin. Each of the three treatments stimulated a robust response in terms of Erk1/2 phosphorylation, but rapamycin did not reduce their stimulatory effect on Erk1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 1F). Furthermore, treatment with rapamycin did not reduce the phosphorylation of AKT in response to FCS (Fig. 1F). As determined in immune complex protein kinase assays (Fig. 1G), levels of S6K1 activity in response to both PMA and PGF2α were comparable, with a level of activation exceeding 4-fold (p < 0.05) over untreated control levels. Stimulation of S6K1 activity by each of the agents tested was completely sensitive to rapamycin pretreatment. Additionally, rapamycin treatment increased the mobility of immunoprecipitated S6K1, consistent with the reduced phosphorylation of S6K1 shown in Fig. 1F. PGF2α-stimulated S6 Phosphorylation Is Rapamycin-sensitive—To further confirm the activation of S6K1 in primary bLC cultures, immunoblot analysis was performed using a phospho-specific S6 Ab. Treatment with PGF2α induced time (Fig. 2A) and concentration (Fig. 2B)-dependent increases in the phosphorylation of S6 comparable to those observed for S6K1 activation. S6 protein levels were unchanged by these treatments (Fig. 2, A and B). Treatment with the PKC activator PMA (20 nm) and FCS (10%) also increased the phosphorylation of S6 (Fig. 2C), and pretreatment with rapamycin blocked the stimulatory actions of FCS, PMA, or PGF2α on S6 phosphorylation. PGF2α-stimulated S6K1 Activation Is Sensitive to the MEK1 Inhibitor U0126—Because PGF2α increases Erk signaling, but does not induce AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 1), experiments were conducted to determine if PGF2α-stimulated S6K1 phosphorylation was sensitive to the MEK1 inhibitor U0126. Pretreatment for 30 min with U0126 (30 μm) inhibited the stimulatory actions of PGF2α on Erk1/2 phosphorylation and on S6K1 phosphorylation on Thr421/Ser424 and Thr389 residues (Fig. 3A). Treatment with U0126 (10 μm) resulted in a 60% decrease in S6K1 activity (p < 0.05, n = 3) (Fig. 3B) which correlated with the inhibition of S6 phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). Similar results were observed when bLCs were treated with the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059. To further verify the specificity of the response to U0126, we performed Western blot analysis with phosphospecific antibodies for p38 MAPK, Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) and Erk5 in bLCs treated with PGF2α (1 μm) or epidermal growth factor (EGF, 10 ng/ml) as a positive control. Treatment with U0126 (10 μm) did not inhibit the stimulatory responses to either PGF2α or EGF on the phosphorylation of p38, JNK, or Erk5 (data not shown). PGF2α-stimulated TSC2 Phosphorylation Is Sensitive to the MEK1 Inhibitor U0126—Treatment with PGF2α and PMA increased phosphorylation of TSC2 as observed using the RXRXXpSer motif antibody (Fig. 4A), which recognizes phospho-TSC2 (Ser1798) (29Ro"
https://openalex.org/W2085156649,"The microtubule-associated protein tau may be involved in cell morphogenesis and axonal maintenance. In addition to microtubules, tau has been shown to interact with actin in vitro. In the present study interaction of tau and actin was investigated in PC12 cells. No interaction between tau and actin was observed without NGF treatment. Under NGF stimulation, tau distributed at ends of cellular extensions, where it associated with actin in a microtubule-independent manner. F-actin disruption revealed that relocalization and assembly of F-actin at the ends of cellular extensions were necessary for NGF-induced tau reorganization and association with actin. A truncated tau-GFP (tau(1-186)-GFP, N-terminal of tau) did not associate with actin. However, tau23(174-352)-GFP (carboxyl-terminal of Tau23) did associate with actin and the requirement for NGF was lost. Nevertheless, NGF boosted tau23(174-352)-GFP interaction with actin and promoted colocalization at the ends of cellular extensions. This suggests that the C-terminal of tau is required for associating with actin and the tau N-terminal may play a regulatory role in this process. A possible role for tau-actin interaction in neurite outgrowth is postulated."
https://openalex.org/W2127106886,"Stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), a chemokine abundantly produced by the bone marrow microenvironment, and its receptor CXCR4 have crucial roles in malignant cell trafficking. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), blasts invade the bloodstream and may localize in extramedullar sites, with variations from one patient to another. We hypothesized that a polymorphism in the SDF-1 coding gene (CXCL12 G801A) could influence blast dissemination and tissue infiltration in AML. CXCL12 G801A polymorphism was determined in 86 adult patients and 100 healthy volunteers. The allelic status and CXCR4 expression on bone marrow blasts were analyzed in relation to peripheral blood blast (PBB) counts and frequency of extramedullar tumor sites. 801A carrier status (801G/A, 801A/A) was found to be associated with a higher PBB count compared with 801G/G homozygous patients (P=0.031) and higher frequency of extramedullar tumor sites (odds ratio 2.92, 95% confidence interval 1.18-7.21, P=0.018). Moreover, the PBB count was correlated with CXCR4 expression (correlation coefficient 0.546, P=0.001) when considering 801A carriers. In conclusion, a polymorphism in the SDF-1 gene is shown for the first time to be associated with the clinical presentation of a malignant hematological disease and more generally with the risk of distant tissue infiltration by tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2090775206,"Phosphorylation of Tau protein and binding to microtubules is complex in neurons and was therefore studied in the less complicated model of humanized yeast. Human Tau was readily phosphorylated at pathological epitopes, but in opposite directions regulated by kinases Mds1 and Pho85, orthologues of glycogen synthase kinase-3β and cdk5, respectively (1Vandebroek T. Vanhelmont T. Terwel D. Borghgraef P. Lemaire K. Snauwaert J. Wera S. Van Leuven F. Winderickx J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11466-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We isolated recombinant Tau-4R and mutant Tau-P301L from wild type, Δmds1 and Δpho85 yeast strains and measured binding to Taxol-stabilized mammalian microtubules in relation to their phosphorylation patterns. Tau-4R isolated from yeast lacking mds1 was less phosphorylated and bound more to microtubules than Tau-4R isolated from wild type yeast. Paradoxically, phosphorylation of Tau-4R isolated from kinase Pho85-deficient yeast was dramatically increased resulting in very poor binding to microtubules. Dephosphorylation promoted binding to microtubules to uniform high levels, excluding other modifications. Isolated hyperphosphorylated, conformationally altered Tau-4R completely failed to bind microtubules. In parallel to Tau-4R, we expressed, isolated, and analyzed mutant Tau-P301L. Total dephosphorylated Tau-4R and Tau-P301L bound to microtubules very similarly. Surprisingly, Tau-P301L isolated from all yeast strains bound to microtubules more extensively than Tau-4R. Atomic force microscopy demonstrated, however, that the high apparent binding of Tau-P301L was due to aggregation on the microtubules, causing their deformation and bundling. Our data explain the pathological presence of granular Tau aggregates in neuronal processes in tauopathies. Phosphorylation of Tau protein and binding to microtubules is complex in neurons and was therefore studied in the less complicated model of humanized yeast. Human Tau was readily phosphorylated at pathological epitopes, but in opposite directions regulated by kinases Mds1 and Pho85, orthologues of glycogen synthase kinase-3β and cdk5, respectively (1Vandebroek T.

We isolated recombinant Tau-4R and mutant Tau-P301L from wild type, Δmds1 and Δpho85 yeast strains and measured binding to Taxol-stabilized mammalian microtubules in relation to their phosphorylation patterns. Tau-4R isolated from yeast lacking mds1 was less phosphorylated and bound more to microtubules than Tau-4R isolated from wild type yeast. Paradoxically, phosphorylation of Tau-4R isolated from kinase Pho85-deficient yeast was dramatically increased resulting in very poor binding to microtubules. Dephosphorylation promoted binding to microtubules to uniform high levels, excluding other modifications.

MT-associated proteins (MAP) regulate the structural and functional organization of the MT network in relation to the rest of the cytoskeleton, to allow axonal transport. Tau protein is an important active MAP, as negatively exemplified by the diverse group of neurodegenerative diseases termed tauopathies, including frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer disease (AD) (for reviews see Refs. 2Hirokawa N.

In all tauopathies, hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of Tau protein appear invariably associated. Whereas it can be assumed that in normal conditions all Tau protein is bound to MT, it is not known whether detachment of Tau protein from MT is a prerequisite for phosphorylation to take place. Whereas Tau-MT binding depends critically on phosphorylation, the complexity and variability of the phosphorylation pattern of neuronal Tau precludes precise definition of the relative or absolute importance of individual phosphorylation sites. We have generated humanized yeast strains by expressing human Tau protein, different isoforms and mutants, to develop a less complex, eukaryotic cell-based model (1Vandebroek T. Vanhelmont T.

Phosphorylation of human Tau at specific residues, known to be pathological in the Tau aggregates in clinical tauopathies, was already important in normal yeast cultures probably due to the fact that human Tau did not bind appreciably to yeast MT. Significantly, phosphorylation was regulated in opposite directions by kinases Mds1 and Pho85, the functional homologues of GSK-3β and cdk5, respectively (1Vandebroek T. Vanhelmont T. Terwel D.

Thereby this model recapitulated our observations in vivo in brain of transgenic mice expressing human Tau protein and Tau kinases GSK-3β and cdk5/p35 (5Terwel D. Dewachter I. Van Leuven F. Neuromol.

Overexpression of wild type Tau-4R in neurons of transgenic mice triggered a severe axonopathy due to excessive binding of Tau-4R to MT. The resulting blockage of bidirectional axonal transport in turn caused axonopathy with severe wallerian degeneration and motor defects (13Spittaels K. Van den Haute C. Van Dorpe J. Bruynseels K.

The other major Tau kinase cdk5 was, however, not capable of phosphorylating Tau-4R or rescue the axonopathy, not even when co-expressed with its neuron-specific activator p35 in triple transgenic mice (15Van den Haute C. Spittaels K. Van Dorpe J. Lasrado R. Vandezande K. Laenen I. Geerts H. Van Leuven F. Neurobiol. Dis. 2001; 8: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This indication that cdk5 acted unlike GSK-3β, and actually completely opposite was underlined by the increased phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins in brain of p35–/– mice (18Hallows J.L. Chen K. DePinho R.A. Vincent I. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10633-10644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and joins seamlessly with our observations in yeast (1Vandebroek T. Vanhelmont T. Terwel D.

Mutations in the microtubule-associated protein Tau gene coding for Tau protein on chromosome 17 cause a varied group of dominantly inherited diseases, collectively known as frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). Both exonic and intronic mutations are known, giving rise to either mutant Tau protein or to augmented Tau-4R isoform expression, respectively, which apparently shares the propensity to become phosphorylated and aggregate into filaments and tangles, the common pathological defect in all tauopathies (for reviews see Refs. 3Heutink P.

We generated Tau-P301L mice and extensively compared them to Tau-4R transgenic mice (16Terwel D. Lasrado R. Snauwaert J. Vandeweert E. Van Haesendonck C. Borghgraef P. Van Leuven F. J. Biol.

Tomiyama T. Mori H. Joels M. Van Leuven F. Lucassen P. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 3514-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The contrast in pathology was evident because beyond 8 months of age, Tau-P301L mice developed a typical tauopathy, i.e. intra-neuronal aggregates and fibrils evolving into authentic NFT containing Tau with all major pathological epitopes (16Terwel D.

Here we extrapolate studies on transgenic mice to humanized yeast cells expressing Tau-4R or mutant Tau-P301L. In addition, we isolated recombinant human Tau from wild type yeast and strains lacking yeast kinases Mds1 or Pho85, the orthologues of mammalian GSK-3β and cdk5, respectively (Ref. 1Vandebroek T. Vanhelmont T. Terwel D. Borghgraef P. Lemaire K. Snauwaert J. Wera S. Van Leuven F. Winderickx J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11466-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar and references therein). By an optimized filter assay, we measured binding of different Tau isoforms to Taxol-stabilized mammalian MT, in direct relation to the physiological phosphorylation status of Tau. The data demonstrate a close parallel between phosphorylation of Ser396/Ser404 and Ser409, recognized by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) AD2 and PG5 (Refs. 1Vandebroek T. Vanhelmont T. Terwel D.

Also clear, Mds1 and Pho85 control in opposite directions both the phosphorylation and MT-binding of Tau-4R. Surprisingly, de-phosphorylated Tau-4R and Tau-P301L bound with equal high affinity to MT, proving that the mutation did not directly affect MT binding per se, but indirectly affected the phosphorylation of mutant Tau-P301L. Moreover, phosphorylated Tau-P301L actually aggregated on the MT surface as measured by the MT binding assays and observed directly by atomic force microscopy (AFM), including pronounced deformation and bundling of MT in vitro. This novel combination of cellular and in vitro modeling provide direct links of specific phosphorylation, aggregation, and MT binding of Tau protein, and we believe these models can now be adapted to analyze very precisely the effect of single phosphoepitopes on the biochemical behavior of human Tau protein. Strains and Culture Conditions—Yeast cells were grown exactly as described before (1Vandebroek T. Vanhelmont T. Terwel D. Borghgraef P. Lemaire K. Snauwaert J. Wera S. Van Leuven F. Winderickx J.

Yeast transformants expressing Tau-4R or Tau-P301L were obtained in wild type, in Δmds1 and Δpho85 strains, and selected as described (1Vandebroek T. Vanhelmont T. Terwel D. Borghgraef P. Lemaire K. Snauwaert J. Wera S. Van Leuven F. Winderickx J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11466-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Purification of Tau—Tau-4R and Tau-P301L were purified from wild type, Δmds1, or Δpho85 yeast strains as described (1Vandebroek T. Vanhelmont T. Terwel D. Borghgraef P. Lemaire K. Snauwaert J. Wera S. Van Leuven F. Winderickx J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11466-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Purified Tau was concentrated on 10-kDa centricon devices (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) equilibrated with 10 mm MES buffer (pH 6.4). The amount of Tau was quantified by Western blotting with mAb Tau-5 and recombinant His-tagged Tau (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) as standard (1Vandebroek T. Vanhelmont T. Terwel D. Borghgraef P.

DaviesYol1/34α-TubulinAbcam, Paris, France Open table in a new tab Dephosphorylation of Purified Tau—Purified Tau was concentrated in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.6) and quantified. Dephosphorylation was performed by incubating with alkaline phosphatase (Roche, Darmstadt, Germany), using 1.7 units/μg of Tau at 37 °C for 2 h. Preparation of Taxol-stabilized MT—Pig tubulin was isolated as described previously (27Shelanski M.L. Gaskin F. Cantor C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar). Tubulin aliquots were centrifuged (100,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) prior to analysis. MT were obtained by incubation of purified tubulin (10 μm) in assembly buffer (80 mm Pipes, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA (pH 6.8)) adjusted gradually to 10 μm Paclitaxel, 1 mm GTP and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Tau-MT Binding Filter Assay—Reaction mixtures in the same assembly buffer described above were prepared containing 10 nm Tau, which was centrifuged (100,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) prior to addition, with increasing concentrations of Taxol-stabilized MT (equivalent to up to 6 μm tubulin), further containing 0.05% bovine serum albumin and 1 mm GTP. After incubation at 37 °C for the indicated time periods, the mixture was transferred to pre-warmed 200-nm centrifuge devices (Nanosep MF, PALL, Michigan, MI) and centrifuged (4,000 × g, 10 min, 37 °C). Filtrates and retentates were adjusted and solubilized, respectively, in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol, and boiled. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (1Vandebroek T. Vanhelmont T. Terwel D. Borghgraef P. Lemaire K. Snauwaert J. Wera S. Van Leuven F. Winderickx J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11466-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) were used with mAb Tau-5 to detect Tau. The relative concentration of Tau was determined from a curve of optical density against dilution of a standard preparation of human Tau (10 nm). The amount of bound Tau and the concentration of tubulin were corrected for nonspecific binding of Tau to the membrane and the amount of unpolymerized tubulin, respectively. Curve fitting (SigmaPlot 9.0, Rockware Inc., Cureglia, Switzerland) yielded values for affinity constant and maximal binding (binding equation: y = Bmax·x/(Kd,app + x), in which y is the percentage binding and x is the concentration of MT expressed as tubulin monomer content). Statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance, followed by the multiple comparison test of Tukey. Ultrastructural Analysis by AFM—Mixtures of 250 nm Tau and 1.5 μm MT were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde and deposited on silanized silicon supports for AFM analysis as described previously (1Vandebroek T. Vanhelmont T. Terwel D. Borghgraef P. Lemaire K. Snauwaert J. Wera S. Van Leuven F. Winderickx J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11466-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). AFM low power images were taken with Point probes type FM cantilevers (Nanoworld, Neuchatel, Switzerland), whereas high power images were obtained with Data probe type cantilevers (DP18/HI'RES/AIBS) (MikroMasch, Madrid, Spain) (1Vandebroek T. Vanhelmont T. Terwel D. Borghgraef P. Lemaire K. Snauwaert J. Wera S. Van Leuven F. Winderickx J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11466-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Filter Assay of Binding of Recombinant Human Tau-4R Protein to Taxol-stabilized MT—Human Tau-4R protein was expressed in and isolated from wild type, Δmds1, and Δpho85 yeast strains as described (1Vandebroek T. Vanhelmont T. Terwel D. Borghgraef P. Lemaire K. Snauwaert J. Wera S. Van Leuven F. Winderickx J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11466-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As opposed to recombinant Tau isolated from bacterial sources, this procedure faithfully maintains the phosphorylation status of Tau protein as present intracellularly in wild type and manipulated yeast cells, a less complex but eukaryotic model (1Vandebroek T. Vanhelmont T. Terwel D. Borghgraef P. Lemaire K. Snauwaert J. Wera S. Van Leuven F. Winderickx J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11466-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The quality and phosphorylation status of the used preparations of isolated Tau were authenticated by Western blotting (Fig. 1, A and B). Binding of Tau protein to preformed, Taxol-stabilized MT was measured by varying the concentration of MT, expressed as the concentration of tubulin monomers measured spectrophotometrically and by Western blotting. A fixed relatively low concentration of recombinant Tau protein (10 nm) was used in these studies, allowing determination of the apparent dissociation constants of MT binding (28Butner K.A. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 717-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Binding of Tau-4R to MT was measured by an optimized filter assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). In brief, Tau/MT mixtures were incubated and centrifuged through disposable 200-nm filters, separating unbound Tau protein in the soluble pass-through fraction, although retaining all Tau-MT complexes. Bound and free Tau were measured in retentates and filtrates, respectively, by Western blotting with the pan-Tau monoclonal antibody Tau-5. This procedure allowed us to quantitatively differentiate MT-bound versus unbound Tau. In addition, as extra internal markers, the majority of tubulin retained on the filter as MT, and the small amount of monomeric tubulin in the filtrates, were measured by Western blotting with an anti-tubulin antibody (Fig. 1C). Binding of Isolated Tau-4R to MT Is Affected in Opposite Directions by Mds1 and Pho85 Inactivation—We first measured binding of isolated Tau-4R to Taxol-stabilized MT, compared with dephosphorylated Tau-4R treated with alkaline phosphatase after isolation from the BY4741 wild type yeast strain. More than 90% of dephospho-Tau-4R bound to MT with an apparent affinity of 0.49 ± 0.09 μm (Fig. 2A, Table 2). The original phosphorylated Tau-4R preparation isolated from wild type yeast bound to MT with a lower apparent affinity of 2.15 ± 0.43 μm (Fig. 2A, Table 2).TABLE 2Kd,app (expressed in micromolar) of wild type and mutant Tau-4R monomers or dimers, isolated from different yeast strainsMonomerDimer, Tau-4RTau-4RTau-P301LDephosphorylation0.49 ± 0.09a0.68 ± 0.07a0.08 ± 0.04dBY47412.15 ± 0.43b0.75 ± 0.27a0.83 ± 0.47aΔmds12.48 ± 0.70b0.85 ± 0.15a0.63 ± 0.34aΔpho85>10c1.23 ± 0.45a,b1.58 ± 0.51b Open table in a new tab We then compared MT binding of Tau-4R isolated from wild type, Δmds1, and Δpho85 yeast strains.

In contrast, Tau-4R isolated from Δpho85 yeast strains showed a strongly reduced extent and affinity of MT binding (Fig. 2A, Table 2). Dimeric Tau-4R Protein Binds to MT with Higher Affinity—The preparations of recombinant Tau-4R isolated from yeast contained higher molecular weight species, tentatively identified and further referred to as Tau-4R dimers, based on their apparent Mr. Their origin or mode of apparent covalent linkage is unknown. Similar dimers were observed in the crude extracts from humanized Tau-4R yeast cultures (1Vandebroek T. Vanhelmont T. Terwel D. Borghgraef P. Lemaire K. Snauwaert J. Wera S. Van Leuven F.

Tau-4R dimers, detected by Western blotting of bound and unbound fractions, were quantified in parallel to the Tau-4R monomers, eventually requiring somewhat longer exposure of the blots. Tau-4R dimers bound with higher apparent affinity to MT than monomeric Tau-4R (Fig. 2B, Table 2). Remarkably, Tau-4R dimers originating from Δpho85 yeast cultures bound to MT with much higher apparent affinity than the monomeric Tau-4R present in the same preparations (Fig. 2B, Table 2). When no other factors are involved, homodimeric proteins are expected to bind with affinity that is the square of that of the corresponding monomers. The experimental data approach this theoretical value fairly closely, indicating that dimerization of Tau-4R did not increase the affinity by another mechanism. The dimers are unlikely to be heterodimers of Tau-4R with unknown proteins, given the fact that they are observed in these widely different organisms of transgenic mice and yeast. Binding of Tau-4R to MT in Relation to Its Phosphorylation Status—Inspection of the Western blots developed with the pan-Tau antibody Tau-5 revealed important differences in electrophoretic mobility of Tau-4R present in bound and unbound fractions. Very conspicuously, electrophoretically faster migrating Tau subforms in all preparations bound preferably to MT, whereas electrophoretically slower migrating Tau isoforms were excluded from the MT-bound fractions. Because in the heterologous yeast expression system the electrophoretic mobility of Tau-4R reflects its phosphorylation status (Ref. 1Vandebroek T. Vanhelmont T. Terwel D. Borghgraef P. Lemaire K.

https://openalex.org/W1998056625,"A distinctive feature of Alzheimer's disease is the deposition of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) in senile or diffuse plaques. The 42 residue beta-peptide (Abeta42) is the predominant form found in plaques. In the present work we report a high-yield expression and purification method of production of a recombinant Abeta42. The purified recombinant peptide shows characteristics similar to the synthetic human peptide. Different size aggregates, either small oligomers or larger aggregates, were obtained upon dissolving the recombinant Abeta42 peptide under different conditions at pH 7.2 or pH 3, respectively. We report a new toxicity assay on the morphogenic development of the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus and study the toxicity of the two kinds of aggregates. Despite the difference between the ionic strength of human extracellular fluid (0.154 mol/l) and artificial sea water (0.48 mol/l), toxicity data collected in this system have an intrinsic relevance. The different ionic strength, in fact, could change the kinetics of oligomer formation, but the effect of morphogenic development reported here is related to the final oligomer sizes. Results of the toxicity assay of Abeta42 on sea urchin development also show a dose-dependent effect. After only 4 h of embryo development, one can note morphological defects in the cell membrane. Retardation of the embryo's development, along with cellular disorders visible inside the blastocoele, can be observed after 1 day of development. Cellular degeneration in two different pathological phenotypes-the occluded blastulae and the occluded prism-is present after 48 h of development. Results show that a greater effect on cell death is induced by the small oligomers stabilized under physiological conditions than at acid pH. In this case only occluded blastulae are found after 48 h of development."
https://openalex.org/W2112210150,"The steady-state levels of all mature transcripts expressed in bacteria and yeast have been cataloged, but we do not yet know the numbers of nascent transcripts and so RNA polymerases engaged on all genes. Such catalogs are presented here. As mRNA levels depend on the balance between synthesis and degradation, we use published data to calculate the numbers of engaged polymerases required to maintain these levels in the face of the known rate of degradation. Most genes, including essential ones, prove not to be transcribed most of the time, and many produce only one message per cell cycle. Some cells even fail to produce an essential message during a cycle, and so must depend on their mother's messages and/or proteins for survival. We speculate that evolution sets the rate of message production so low to conserve energy, minimize transcription-induced mutation, and permit regulation over the widest range."
https://openalex.org/W2081560420,"The EPH/EFN family of receptor tyrosine kinases regulates cell adhesion and migration and has an important role in controlling cell positioning in the normal intestinal epithelium. Inactivation of EPHB2 has recently been shown to accelerate tumorigenesis in the colon and rectum, and we have previously demonstrated frequent frameshift mutations (41%) in an A9 coding microsatellite repeat in exon 17 of EPHB2 in colorectal tumors with microsatellite instability (MSI). In this study, we extended these analyses to extracolonic MSI cancers, and found frameshift EPHB2 mutations in 39% (25/64) of gastric tumors and 14% (8/56) of endometrial tumors. Regression analysis of these EPHB2 mutation data on the basis of our previously proposed statistical model identified EPHB2 as a selective target of frameshift mutations in MSI gastric cancers but not in MSI endometrial carcinomas. These results suggest a functional role for EPHB2 in gastric tumor progression, and emphasize the differences between the tumorigenic processes in MSI gastrointestinal and endometrial cancer."

To understand the mechanism of DNA repair, we examined the resonance Raman spectra of complexes between damaged DNA and the neutral semiquinoid and oxidized forms of (6-4) and CPD photolyases. The marker band for a neutral semiquinoid flavin and band I of the oxidized flavin, which are derived from the vibrations of the benzene ring of FAD, were shifted to lower frequencies upon binding of damaged DNA by CPD photolyase but not by (6-4) photolyase, indicating that CPD interacts with the benzene ring of FAD directly but that the (6-4) photoproduct does not. Bands II and VII of the oxidized flavin and the 1398/1391 cm-1 bands of the neutral semiquinoid flavin, which may reflect the bending of U-shaped FAD, were altered upon substrate binding, suggesting that CPD and the (6-4) photoproduct interact with the adenine ring of FAD. When substrate was bound, there was an upshifted 1528 cm-1 band of the neutral semiquinoid flavin in CPD photolyase, indicating a weakened hydrogen bond at N(5)-H of FAD, and band X seemed to be downshifted in (6-4) photolyase, indicating a weakened hydrogen bond at N(3)-H of FAD. These Raman spectra led us to conclude that the two photolyases have different electron transfer mechanisms as well as different hydrogen bonding environments, which account for the higher redox potential of CPD photolyase.

Irradiation of organisms with ultraviolet light causes damage to cellular DNA by inducing dimer formation between adjacent pyrimidine bases. This DNA damage causes mutation and cell death and can lead to cancer (1Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4378) Google Scholar). The cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) 4The abbreviations used are: CPD, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer; FADox, oxidized FAD; FADH°, neutral semiquinoid FAD; FADH-, anionic fully reduced FAD. and (6-4) photoproduct (Fig. 1) account for most of this DNA damage, and these are repaired by CPD and (6-4) photolyases, respectively, under illumination by near UV-visible light (2Sancar A.

Similar association constants of ∼10-9 m were identified for CPD and the (6-4) photoproduct in the complex of the corresponding photolyase, respectively, whereas those for the undamaged DNA were >4 orders of magnitude lower or not detectable (4Sancar A.

The amino acid sequences of (6-4) and CPD photolyases, especially within the FAD-binding region, are closely related, suggesting that these two enzymes share similar structure and reaction mechanisms (9Todo T. Ryo H. Yamamoto K. Toh H. Inui T. Ayaki H. Nomura T. Ikenaga M. Science. 1996; 272: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar); however, the quantum yield for photorecovery is significantly lower for (6-4) photolyase than for CPD photolyase (4Sancar A.

The isoalloxazine ring of FAD in a photolyase can exist in one of three possible states: oxidized (FADox), neutral semiquinoid (FADH°), and anionic fully reduced (FADH-) forms (Fig. 2). FADH- is considered to be the active form of flavin in photolyase. The first step of the repair process is the specific recognition of CPD and the (6-4) photoproduct by CPD photolyase (2Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) and (6-4) photolyase (9Todo T. Ryo H. Yamamoto K. Toh H. Inui T. Ayaki H. Nomura T. Ikenaga M. Science. 1996; 272: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), respectively. After photoexcitation of FADH- by near UV-visible light, an electron is transferred to the damaged DNA, leaving the flavin in the neutral semiquinoid form (FADH°). Following bond cleavage of the DNA dimer, the electron is transferred back to FADH° to restore the active state, FADH- (4Sancar A. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). In the case of the (6-4) photoproduct, it has been proposed that the bound substrate is converted to a four-member oxetane ring intermediate (10Kim S.T. Malhotra K. Smith C.A. Taylor J.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8535-8540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) catalyzed by two conserved histidines in the active site (11Hitomi K. Nakamura H. Kim S.T. Mizukoshi T. Ishikawa T.

A long distance between FAD and the DNA substrate was also suggested by analysis of the electric dipole moment (21MacFarlane A.W. Stanley R.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15203-15214Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and by EPR and electron nuclear double resonance (22Weber S. Richter G. Schleicher E. Bacher A. Mobius K. Kay C.W.M. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1195-1204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, the crystal structure of CPD photolyase complexed with a CPD-like DNA lesion (15Mees A. Klar T. Gnau P. Hennecke U. Eker A.P.M. Carell T. Essen L.O. Science. 2004; 306: 1789-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) showed a direct van der Waals contact of 3-4 Å between the cofactor and the thymine dimer (Fig. 3), a finding also supported by a femtosecond fluorescence and absorption spectroscopic study (23Kao Y.T.

Resonance Raman spectra have suggested that changes in the hydrogen bonding environment of the FAD cofactor in CPD photolyase after substrate binding (24Schelvis J.P.M. Ramsey M. Sokolova O.

Soc. 2005; 127: 10472-10473Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and stabilize it in the catalytically active FADH- state in the enzyme, but the precise alterations of the hydrogen bonding environments have not yet been determined. As for (6-4) photolyase, a crystal structure is not yet available. Although the high sequence homology between the two photolyases suggests that the interaction between the (6-4) photoproduct and the FAD cofactor may be similar to that between CPD and FAD in CPD photolyase, the quantum yield for (6-4) photolyase is much lower (0.05-0.1) than that for CPD photolyase (0.7-0.98). Resonance Raman spectroscopy is a sensitive tool for probing the interactions between the flavin cofactor and its surroundings in flavoproteins (26Morris M.D. Bienstock R.J. Clark R.J.H. Hester R.E. Advances in Spectroscopy. 13. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Google Scholar, 27McFarland J.T. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). To explore and compare the interactions between the damaged DNA and the FAD cofactor in (6-4) and CPD photolyases, we first constructed a His tag expression system to obtain adequate amounts of purified active enzymes. We then compared the resonance Raman spectra for complexes of the neutral semiquinoid and oxidized forms with damaged DNA. Our results suggest that CPD interacts with both the benzene ring (Ring I) and the adenine ring of the FAD cofactor, whereas the (6-4) photoproduct interacts only with the adenine ring of the FAD cofactor. Such a structural difference may indicate different pathways of electron transfer for the two enzymes. In addition, the Raman spectra predict different substrate-induced changes in the hydrogen bonding environment for the two enzymes. Enzyme Preparation—The gene of Arabidopsis thaliana (6-4) photolyase or Escherichia coli CPD photolyase was inserted at the NdeI and SacI sites of the pET-28a expression vector (Novagen). E. coli BL21(DE3) transformed with the vector was added to 0.5 liters of LB medium in a 3-liter flask and grown at 37 °C to A600 = 1.5. The culture was then cooled to 26 °C, adjusted to 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, incubated for 24 h, and then harvested by centrifugation. The pellet was frozen at -80 °C, thawed, resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol, pH 7.4), and sonicated. Cell debris was removed from the lysate by ultracentrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 1 h. The cell-free extract was loaded onto a HisTrap HP column (Amersham Biosciences), and the fusion protein was eluted with elution buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.5 m imidazole, pH 7.4). Next, the sample was applied to a HiTrap heparin HP column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.3-1 m NaCl. A 2-liter culture of E. coli culture yielded ∼12 mg of (6-4) photolyase and 10 mg of CPD photolyase. The N-terminal His tag was not removed from the fusion protein. To prepare the fully oxidized enzyme from the purified sample, (6-4) photolyase was exposed to air for >48 h and then applied to a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 prep grade column (Amersham Biosciences). Because the oxidization of CPD photolyase by air is very ineffective, the neutral semiquinoid FAD cofactor was removed by decreasing the pH, after which CPD photolyase was reconstituted with oxidized FAD (Sigma). All steps were performed according to the procedure described by Jorns et al. (28Jorns M.S. Wang B.Y. Jordan S.P. Chanderkar L.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 552-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), except that the dithiothreitol was removed from the buffer, and a HiTrap phenyl FF (high sub) column (Amersham Biosciences) was used to remove excess FAD. The purified enzyme was stored in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 m NaCl. 10% glycerol was also added to stabilize the reconstituted CPD photolyase. The purity of the protein after application to the heparin column was determined by SDS-PAGE, and the monomeric form was identified by gel filtration chromatography on the HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 prep grade column. The concentration of the oxidized form of the enzyme was estimated based on the FAD absorbance at 450 nm (ϵ450 = 1.12 × 104 m-1 cm-1) (29Todo T. Kim S.T. Hitomi K. Otoshi E. Inui T. Morioka H. Kobayashi H. Ohtsuka E. Toh H. Ikenaga M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 764-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and that of the neutral semiquinoid form was estimated from the absorbance at 580 nm (ϵ580 = 4.8 × 103 m-1 cm-1) (30Wang B.Y. Jorns M.S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1148-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Substrate Preparation—The substrate was prepared by irradiation of oligothymine (oligo(dT)8 or oligo(dT)10; Operon Biotechnologies) for 30 min with 254 nm UV light (6.4 milliwatt/cm2) using a UV transilluminator (TFX-20-MC, Vilber Lourmat). The sample was loaded in a cylindrical spinning cell that was cooled during the UV irradiation by flushing with cold N2 gas passed through liquid N2. Formation of dimers was monitored by the decrease in the monomer absorption band at 266 nm and the appearance of an absorption band of the (6-4) photoproduct at 325 nm (31Franklin W.A. Lo K.M. Haseltine W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13535-13543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme Activity—The enzyme activity of the His-tagged (6-4) and CPD photolyases was measured using a method based on the assay for CPD photolyase (32Jorns M.S. Sancar G.B. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1856-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, a complex of 2 μm photolyase and 50 μm UV-irradiated oligo(dT)8 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol was placed in a spinning cell and illuminated with a tungsten light (PHL-150, Sigma Koki Co., Ltd.) at room temperature. The UV-visible absorption spectrum of the sample was measured as a function of time. Absorption and Resonance Raman Spectroscopy—Optical absorption spectra of samples were recorded with a Hitachi UV-3310 UV-visible spectrophotometer at room temperature. Resonance Raman spectra were obtained with a single monochromator (SPEX750M, Jobin Yvon) equipped with a liquid N2-cooled CCD detector (Spec10:400B/LN, Roper Scientific, Inc.). The excitation wavelengths were 568.2 and 488.0 nm from a krypton/argon mixed-gas ion laser (BeamLok 2060, Spectra-Physics) for the semiquinoid and oxidized forms, respectively. The laser power at the sample point was 5 milliwatts. Rayleigh scattering was removed with appropriate holographic notch filters (Kaiser Optical Systems). Raman shifts were calibrated with indene, and the accuracy of the peak positions of the well defined Raman bands was ±1 cm-1. For the semiquinoid form, the measurements were made using an aliquot of 150 μm enzyme in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 m NaCl. For the oxidized form, the buffer was the same, but the enzyme concentration was 75 μm, and 10% glycerol was added for CPD photolyase. A 2-fold excess of oligo(dT)10 or UV-irradiated oligo(dT)10 was added to the mixture. All measurements were performed with a spinning Raman cell containing 80 μl of sample solution, and all samples were cooled with cold N2 gas. The structureless background in the raw spectrum was removed by a polynomial subtraction procedure using Igor Pro 5.03 (WaveMetrics). The resonance Raman spectra of oxidized CPD photolyase were normalized by the Raman band for glycerol in the buffer, so their differences both in frequency and intensity are reliable, whereas all the other Raman data were normalized by their most intense band presumably. Thus, only the differences in frequencies were considered. Enzyme Activity—The time course curves for dimer repair by 2 μm (6-4) and CPD photolyases in the presence of 50 μm UV-damaged oligo(dT)8 are shown in Fig. 4 (A and B, respectively). UV damage substantially reduced the 266 nm band of undamaged DNA and resulted in the appearance of a significant 325 nm band for the (6-4) photoproduct. Illumination of the damaged DNA complex with white light in the presence of (6-4) or CPD photolyase resulted in the gradual reappearance of the 266 nm band and, for the (6-4) photolyase, the disappearance of the 325 nm band. Therefore, although the enzymes used here have N-terminal His tags, they are catalytically active. Absorption Spectra of Photolyase Complexed with DNA Lesions—Immediately after purification, most of the (6-4) and CPD photolyases were in the neutral semiquinoid form with FADH° (Fig. 5, A and C, respectively). The absorption spectra for the fully oxidized (6-4) and CPD photolyases with FADox are shown in Fig. 5 (B and D), respectively. Also shown are the spectra of the enzyme·substrate complexes with (dotted lines) and without (solid lines) substrate. The absorbance maxima of FADH° (586 and 623 nm) and FADox (380 nm) in CPD photolyase were significantly shifted upon binding of the UV-damaged DNA. 5The prominent near-UV absorption maximum around 340 nm shown as a dotted line arises from the UV-damaged DNA of the (6-4) photoproduct (31Franklin W.A. Lo K.M. Haseltine W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13535-13543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of this band, as well as the invariable frequencies of all absorption bands before and after Raman measurement (data not shown), indicates the presence of an adequate amount of UV-damaged DNA substrate in this study. This blue shift is in agreement with previous findings (24Schelvis J.P.M. Ramsey M. Sokolova O. Tavares C. Cecala C. Connell K. Wagner S. Gindt Y.M. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2003; 107: 12352-12362Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 28Jorns M.S. Wang B.Y. Jordan S.P. Chanderkar L.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 552-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In contrast, substrate binding had little effect on the absorption spectra of (6-4) photolyase. The absorption maxima around 590 and 630 nm in Fig. 5 (A and C) are due to the electronic transition of FADH°. These absorption maxima are absent from the spectra for FADox (Fig. 5, B and D). In accordance with these absorption spectra, we chose 568.2 and 488.0 nm as the Raman excitation wavelengths to selectively enhance the neutral semiquinoid and oxidized forms, respectively (Fig. 5, arrows). Resonance Raman Spectra of Neutral Semiquinoid Photolyase Complexed with DNA Lesions—The resonance Raman spectra of the neutral semiquinoid (6-4) and CPD photolyases are shown in Fig. 6 (A and B, respectively). Fig. 6 shows the spectra for the enzyme alone (traces a), with undamaged DNA (traces b), and with UV-damaged DNA (traces c). Some clear peaks are evident in the difference spectra between the enzyme alone and the enzyme·UV-irradiated DNA complex (traces e) but not in the difference spectra between the enzyme alone and the enzyme·undamaged DNA complex (traces d). These results were repeated in independent experiments, and they suggest that the structure and environment of the FAD cofactor change in both photolyases upon binding of a specific substrate and that undamaged DNA does not interact with the active site in either photolyase. The band near 1606 cm-1 in photolyases is a marker for the neutral semiquinoid flavin (33Nishina Y. Shiga K. Horiike K. Tojo H. Kasai S. Matsui K. Watari H. Yamano T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 88: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Recent Raman studies suggested that there are two closely overlapping modes in the frequency region of this marker band and that, in fact, splitting of this band can be observed for the D2O substitution (24Schelvis J.P.M. Ramsey M. Sokolova O. Tavares C. Cecala C. Connell K. Wagner S. Gindt Y.M. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2003; 107: 12352-12362Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 34Murgida D.H. Schleicher E. Bacher A. Richter G. Hildebrandt P. J. Raman Spectrosc. 2001; 32: 551-556Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The higher frequency counterpart arises from the stretching of Ring I, and the lower frequency counterpart comes from the C-C/C-N(5) stretching and N(5)-H bending of Ring II (Fig. 2) (24Schelvis J.P.M. Ramsey M. Sokolova O. Tavares C. Cecala C. Connell K. Wagner S. Gindt Y.M. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2003; 107: 12352-12362Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 34Murgida D.H. Schleicher E. Bacher A.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16727-16732Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Upon substrate binding to CPD photolyase, there was a significant downshift in the frequency of this marker band. However, this shift was not detected for the (6-4) photolyase. The 1528 cm-1 band of CPD photolyase, which is assigned to the C-C/C-N(5) stretching of Ring II and thought to be a sensitive indicator of hydrogen bonding to N(5)-H of flavin (34Murgida D.H. Schleicher E. Bacher A. Richter G. Hildebrandt P. J. Raman Spectrosc. 2001; 32: 551-556Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), was upshifted, but this was not observed for (6-4) photolyase. The 1398 cm-1 band of (6-4) photolyase and the corresponding band of CPD photolyase at 1391 cm-1, which are tentatively assigned to the C-N(10) stretching (34Murgida D.H. Schleicher E. Bacher A. Richter G. Hildebrandt P. J. Raman Spectrosc. 2001; 32: 551-556Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), were both upshifted. The 1338 cm-1 band of (6-4) photolyase seemed to be unaltered by substrate binding, whereas the bands of both enzymes at 1331 cm-1 seemed to be less intensified in the substrate-bound form (Fig. 6A). The sensitivity of this band to deuterium exchange indicates that it may be influenced by perturbations in the hydrogen bonding environment of the flavin ring (24Schelvis J.P.M. Ramsey M. Sokolova O. Tavares C. Cecala C. Connell K. Wagner S. Gindt Y.M. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2003; 107: 12352-12362Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The 1298 and 1302 cm-1 bands, which are assigned to C-N(5) stretching (34Murgida D.H. Schleicher E. Bacher A. Richter G. Hildebrandt P. J. Raman Spectrosc. 2001; 32: 551-556Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), were upshifted only in CPD photolyase. These substrate-induced frequency shifts of FADH° in (6-4) and CPD photolyases are summarized and quantitatively compared in Table 1. The frequency changes in CPD photolyase were much larger than those in (6-4) photolyase, and the results are compatible with the changes in the absorption spectra upon substrate binding (Fig. 5). Notably, the shifts of the Raman bands at 1606 and 1607 cm-1 were the most different, indicating different interactions of UV-damaged DNA with FADH° in the two photolyases.TABLE 1Raman frequency shifts of FADH° in (6-4) and CPD photolyases upon substrate bindingModeFrequency shiftcm—1FADH° in (6-4) photolyase16060152201398+ 11338012980FADH° in CPD photolyase1607— 21528+ 11391+ 2133101302+ 1 Open table in a new tab Resonance Raman Spectra of Oxidized Photolyase Complexed with DNA Lesions—The vibrational assignments are much better established for the oxidized flavin than for the neutral semiquinoid form (35Zheng Y.G.

Like the semiquinoid flavin, the oxidized flavin has a planar conformation (39Zheng Y.J. Ornstein R.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 9402-9408Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and should undergo a similar structural change upon substrate binding. Therefore, investigation of the oxidized enzymes could enhance the understanding of the structure and environment of the FAD cofactor in (6-4) and CPD photolyases. The resonance Raman spectra of the oxidized (6-4) and CPD photolyases are shown in Fig. 7 (A and B, respectively). Fig. 7 shows the spectra for the enzyme alone (traces a), with undamaged DNA (traces b), and with UV-damaged DNA (traces c). The customary numbering of the Raman bands (36Bowman W.D. Spiro T.G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3313-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) is indicated. Comparison of the difference spectra between the enzyme alone and the enzyme·undamaged DNA complex (traces d) and between the enzyme alone and the enzyme·damaged DNA complex (traces e) reveals some peaks that were specifically caused by alterations in the structure and environment of the FAD cofactor upon binding of a damaged DNA substrate. Although the signal-to-noise ratio of the Raman spectra for the reconstituted oxidized CPD photolyase was not as high as that for the oxidized (6-4) photolyase, the frequency shifts observed upon substrate binding were clear and reproducible. The Raman band for glycerol (buffer component), which appears at 1465 cm-1, is indicated by G in Fig. 7B. Band I at 1621 or 1622 cm-1 is assigned to the almost pure Ring I stretching vibration of the oxidized flavin (35Zheng Y.G. Dong J. Palfey B.A. Carey P.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16727-16732Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 36Bowman W.D. Spiro T.G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3313-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 37Abe M.

Chem. 1990; 94: 3980-3994Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Upon substrate binding, a clear downshift of this band was observed only for CPD photolyase. Band II at 1577 or 1575 cm-1 was upshifted in both enzymes. Because this band is related to C(4a)=N(5) and N(1)=C(10a) stretching, it has been used as a marker of the hydrogen bonding interactions at N-1 and N-5 of the oxidized flavin (38Lively C.R. McFarland J.T. J. Phys. Chem. 1990; 94: 3980-3994Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In (6-4) photolyase, the frequency of band III was increased upon substrate binding, whereas those of bands IV and V were not. In contrast, the frequency changes of these weak bands in CPD photolyase could not be reliably identified. A slight upshift at 1398 cm-1 and downshift at 1400 cm-1 were observed for band VI in (6-4) and CPD photolyases, respectively. C-N(3) stretching and Ring I modes are believed to contribute to this band (35Zheng Y.G. Dong J. Palfey B.A. Carey P.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16727-16732Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 38Lively C.R. McFarland J.T. J. Phys. Chem. 1990; 94: 3980-3994Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Recent assignments have suggested that the strong band VII is related to the stretching of N(10)-C(10a) and N(10)-C(1′) (ribityl) (35Zheng Y.G. Dong J. Palfey B.A. Carey P.R.

One response is the up-regulation of the 32-kDa redox-sensitive protein, heme oxygenase-1. Exposure of renal proximal tubular epithelial cells to 10 μm cadmium demonstrated induction (∼20-fold) of heme oxygenase-1 mRNA and protein. Using a 4.5-kb human heme oxygenase-1 promoter construct, the importance of a previously identified cadmium response element (TGCTAGAT) in HeLa cells was verified in renal epithelial cells. Specific protein-DNA interaction with this sequence was demonstrated using nuclear extracts from cadmium-treated cells. Yeast one-hybrid screen of a human kidney cDNA library resulted in the identification of pescadillo, a unique nucleolar, developmental protein, as an interacting protein with the cadmium response element and was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation in vivo and gel shift assays with purified glutathione S-transferase-pescadillo protein in vitro. The specificity of the DNA-protein interaction was verified by the absence of a binding complex when the core sequence of the cadmium response element was mutated or deleted. In addition, B23/nucleophosmin, another nucleolar protein, did not interact with the cadmium response sequence. Overexpression of pescadillo resulted in increased activity of the 4.5-kb human heme oxygenase-1 promoter construct but failed to activate this construct when the cadmium response sequence was mutated.

The introduction of cadmium into the human body occurs through occupational exposure, such as working with cadmium-containing pigments, plastics, glass, metal alloys, and electrode material in nickel-cadmium batteries, and nonoccupational exposure, such as food, water, and cigarette smoke (1Elinder C.G. IARC Sci. Publ. 1992; 118: 123-132Google Scholar, 2Waisberg M. Joseph P. Hale B. Beyersmann D. Toxicology. 2003; 192: 95-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Cadmium absorbed accumulates mainly in the kidney and liver and has a long biological half-life of 15 years (3Nordberg G.F. Nishiyama K. Arch. Environ. Health. 1972; 24: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Following absorption, cadmium is bound to the apoprotein, metallothionein, and is filtered through the glomerulus into the urinary space, where it is endocytosed by the proximal tubule cells and degraded by the lysosomes, resulting in the release of cadmium. The intracellular release of cadmium is responsible for the generation of reactive oxygen species, glutathione depletion, lipid peroxidation, protein cross-linking, and DNA damage, culminating ultimately in oxidant-induced cell death (4Funakoshi T.

Recent studies have demonstrated that under states of increased oxidant stress, heme oxygenase (HO) 2The abbreviations used are: HO, heme oxygenase; CdRE, cadmium response element; mCdRE, mutated CdRE; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GFP, green fluorescence protein; StRE, stress response element; BRCT, BRCA1 C-terminal; GST, glutathione S-transferase. -1 is induced as an adaptive and beneficial response. HO-1 is a 32-kDa microsomal enzyme responsible for catalyzing the conversion of heme to biliverdin, liberating equimolar amounts of carbon monoxide (CO) and iron (9Maines M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). Biliverdin is converted to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase. There are two main isoforms of heme oxygenase, a highly inducible form, HO-1, and a constitutive form, HO-2 (9Maines M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar, 10McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Huang T.J. Maines M.D. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1997; 247: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar), has recently been shown to be a pseudogene (12Hayashi S. Omata Y. Sakamoto H. Hara T. Noguchi M. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 29: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). HO-1 is induced by several different stimuli, including heme, UV radiation, hydrogen peroxide, oxidized low density lipoprotein, nitric oxide and nitric oxide donors, growth factors, cytokines, shear stress, hyperoxia, hypoxia, glucose deprivation, and heavy metals (e.g. cadmium) (13Sikorski E.M. Hock T. Hill-Kapturczak N. Agarwal A. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F425-F441Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The human HO-1 gene, located on chromosome 22q12, has five exons and spans ∼14 kb (14Kutty R.K. Kutty G. Rodriguez I.R. Chader G.J. Wiggert B. Genomics. 1994; 20: 513-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Previous studies have identified a potential cadmium response element (CdRE) (TGCTAGAT) in the 5′-flanking region of the human HO-1 gene in HeLa cells (15Takeda K. Ishizawa S. Sato M. Yoshida T. Shibahara S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22858-22867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the protein(s) interacting with the CdRE have not been determined. Using a yeast one-hybrid screen of a human kidney cDNA library, we have identified pescadillo as one of several candidate proteins interacting with the CdRE in renal epithelial cells. We focused our studies on pescadillo, given its localization in the nucleus/nucleolus and its abundance in organs, such as the kidney, liver, and testis (16Haque J. Boger S. Li J. Duncan S.A. Genomics. 2000; 70: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), tissues that are particularly susceptible to cadmium-induced toxicity (3Nordberg G.F. Nishiyama K. Arch. Environ.

The human pescadillo gene has been localized to chromosome 22q12.1 and codes for a 68-kDa protein (GenBank™ accession number NM_014303). Amino acid analysis reveals several nuclear localization signals, a SUMO-1 modification sequence, and the BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) domain (16Haque J. Boger S. Li J. Duncan S.A. Genomics. 2000; 70: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 18Kinoshita Y. Jarell A.D. Flaman J.M. Foltz G. Schuster J. Sopher B.L. Irvin D.K. Kanning K. Kornblum H.I. Nelson P.S.

The presence of a BRCT domain suggests the potential for interactions with other cellular, nuclear, and/or nucleolar proteins. Here, we show that (i) cadmium stimulates human HO-1 gene expression in renal epithelial cells through specific interaction with the CdRE sequence; (ii) the developmental protein pescadillo associates with the CdRE in vivo and in vitro, and (iii) pescadillo regulates HO-1 promoter activity in renal epithelial cells. These findings demonstrate a novel transcriptional regulatory function for pescadillo and suggest that nucleolar proteins may play an important role in modulating the cellular response to stress. Reagents—Tissue culture medium, serum, and supplements were obtained from Invitrogen. Hemin (iron protoporphyrin chloride) and cadmium chloride were obtained from Sigma.

HEK293 cells (ATCC), an immortalized human embryonic kidney epithelial cell line, transformed with adenovirus 5 DNA, were grown in minimal essential medium (Eagle) with 2 mm l-glutamine, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Primary human renal proximal tubular cells (Clonetics, Walkersville, MD) were grown in renal epithelial basal medium supplemented with fetal calf serum (0.5%), insulin (5 μg/ml), transferrin (10 μg/ml), triiodothyronine (6.5 ng/ml), hydrocortisone (0.5 μg/ml), epinephrine (0.5 μg/ml), and epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml). All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 95% air and 5% carbon dioxide. Plasmid Constructs and Transfections—The plasmid constructs, pHOGL3/4.5 and pHOGL3/4.0, containing –4.5 and –4.0 kb fragments, respectively, of the 5′-flanking region of the human HO-1 gene have been described previously (23Agarwal A.

A GST-pescadillo fusion protein was prepared by cloning the pescadillo gene into the BamHI-EcoRI site of the pGEX 4T-2 plasmid. GST fusion proteins were isolated according to the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce). All cells were plated in collagen-coated 10-cm dishes and transiently transfected at a confluence of ∼85% using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with equimolar amounts of plasmid DNA using a batch transfection protocol (23Agarwal A.

Transfection was performed for 1.25 h, cells were rinsed one time with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and fresh growth medium was added.

The transfected cells recuperated for 24 h prior to treatment with vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline) or cadmium (10 μm) for 16 h. Cell lysates were collected, and luciferase activity was measured according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). To test the effects of pescadillo overexpression on HO-1 reporter activity, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with pHOGL3/4.5 (4 μg) with the GFP-pescadillo expression plasmid in 10-cm dishes using molar ratios of 1:0.03 (0.1 μg), 1:0.3 (1 μg), and 1:3 (10 μg), respectively. GFP alone was used as a control. Another group of HEK293 cells were co-transfected with pHOGL3/4.5/mCdRE and the GFP-pescadillo expression plasmid in a similar fashion using a batch transfection protocol. Northern and Western Analysis—Total RNA was extracted using the Chomczynski and Sacchi method (26Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) and purified using Trizol. Total RNA was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel, electrotransferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized with a 32P-labeled human HO-1 cDNA probe. The membranes were stripped and reprobed with a human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe. To quantitate expression levels, autographs were scanned on a Hewlett-Packard Scanjet 4C scanner using Deskscan II software. Experiments were adjusted for loading using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase quantification and then normalized and expressed as arbitrary units. For Western blotting, samples were prepared in Laemmli buffer and then separated in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was then blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk, 1% bovine serum albumin solution for 1 h at room temperature, and the specified primary antibody was added (HO-1, 1:2000; pescadillo, 1:3000) to the blot and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution) was added after three washes and incubated at room temperature for 1 h, prior to exposure to enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Amersham Biosciences). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—Nuclear extracts were isolated from cells that were stimulated with vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline), hemin (5 μm), or cadmium (10 μm) for 2 and 4 h. Radiolabeled oligonucleotides (1 ng) (Table 1) containing the potential binding site sequence(s), determined experimentally, were incubated with nuclear extracts (3–10 μg of protein) or purified column extracts (0.83–7 μg). Preincubation for 20 min at 4 °C in the presence of 1 mg of poly(dI-dC) (0.1 μg for column fractions) blocked nonspecific protein-DNA complex formation. The resulting protein-DNA complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel followed by autoradiography. Competing oligonucleotides were used at 50- and 100-fold excess. Gel shift assays were also performed using the CdRE oligonucleotide with cadmium-stimulated nuclear extracts from HK-2 cells in the presence of a goat polyclonal anti-pescadillo antibody (1 μg) (ab19036) (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) or normal goat serum as control.TABLE 1Oligonucleotide sequences used in the electrophoretic mobility shift assaysOligonucleotideNucleotide sequenceCdRE5′-AATTCGGCGGATTTTGCTAGATTTTGCG-3′mallCdRE5′-AATTCGGCGGATTTcatcgagTTTTGCG-3′ΔCdRE5′-AAAGGGAAGGCGGATTTTTTTGCTGAGTCACC-3′AP-15′-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA-3′ Open table in a new tab Yeast One-hybrid Screening—A yeast one-hybrid screening system for the identification of DNA-binding proteins was purchased from Clontech. Four tandem copies of the CdRE sequence (core sequence underlined) (5′-GCGGATTTTGCTAGATTTT-3′) were prepared with an EcoRI overhang for the 5′-end and a SalI site for the 3′-end, allowing directional cloning into the reporter plasmid pHisi. The recombinant plasmid was introduced into the genome of the yeast strain, Y4271. Following selection for stable transformants, the yeast strains were transformed with a human kidney cDNA library (catalog no. 638807; Clontech) fused to the yeast Gal4 activation domain. Positives were isolated by growth on histidine-free medium containing 45 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole to reduce the background expression of HIS3 in the reporter strain. Colonies that grew in the absence of histidine were used to isolate specific clones. Plasmid DNA was isolated from yeast cells according to the manufacturer's recommendations and sequenced. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP was performed essentially as described (27Hock T.D. Nick H.S. Agarwal A. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with some modifications. HK-2 cells were grown to ∼80% confluence on 150-mm plates and induced with hemin (5 μm), cadmium (10 μm), or vehicle 4 h. 1 μg of a rabbit polyclonal affinity-purified anti-pescadillo antibody (A300-607A) (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX) was added, and the samples were rotated at 4 °C overnight. An antibody control consisting of normal rabbit serum was also included. PCR products were electrophoresed in a 1.8% agarose gel and transferred to a Hybond XL membrane. The blots were then hybridized with a 32P-end-labeled nested oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the CdRE sequence. Expression of GST Fusion Protein Constructs—GST; GST-pescadillo; deletions of GST-pescadillo, including the BRCT domain (ΔBRCT), the amino terminus (Δ1–272), and just the amino terminus (1–272); and GST-B23 constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli using electroporation. Cells were grown, and the fusion protein was expressed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce) with the following exceptions. Induction of the fusion protein was done with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h. Isolation on a GST column was performed as directed by the manufacturer, except after loading the extract onto an equilibrated column, 1 column volume of buffer was run through, and the column was then capped and allowed to incubate with extract for 30 min at room temperature. In Vitro Translation of Myc-Bop1 and Pulldown with GST-Pescadillo—Myc-tagged BOP1 (block of proliferation 1) protein was produced from the Cs2 + Myc tag plasmid by in vitro transcription-coupled translation using the TNT SP6 quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The rabbit reticulocyte lysates containing in vitro transcription-coupled translation product were subsequently employed in a GST pulldown assay using GST, GST-pescadillo, and deletion mutants, including pescadillo ΔBRCT, Δ1–272, and 1–272 bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). After a 2-h incubation in EBC buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40), the beads were washed four times with the same buffer, and the protein complexes were released by boiling in 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. After resolving the protein complexes by SDS-PAGE, Myc-tagged BOP1 was detected by Western blot using anti-Myc tag antibody (1:5000; 5B11; Cell Signaling). Statistical Analysis—Results were derived from at least 2–3 independent experiments. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. For the luciferase data, results were derived from three independent experiments with 12 replicates for each condition. Analyses were performed using analysis of variance and the Student-Newman-Keuls test. All results are considered significant at p < 0.05. Cadmium Induces HO-1 mRNA and Protein through a CdRE in Human Renal Epithelial Cells—HK2 cells were stimulated with vehicle (control) or cadmium (10 μm) for either 4 h for Northern analysis or 16 h for Western analysis, respectively. HO-1 mRNA (Fig. 1A) and protein (Fig. 1B) were markedly increased following exposure to cadmium. In order to define the regulatory region for cadmium responsiveness in the human HO-1 promoter, luciferase reporter constructs containing either a –4.5-kb fragment, a –4.0-kb fragment, or a –4.5-kb fragment with a mutation in the CdRE were transiently transfected into HK-2 cells. As shown in Fig. 1C, cadmium (10 μm) resulted in a ∼4-fold increase in reporter activity of the 4.5-kb human HO-1 promoter, whereas mutation of the CdRE in the 4.5-kb promoter or a 4.0-kb promoter fragment with a deletion of the CdRE significantly reduced basal and cadmium-dependent reporter activation. These results demonstrate that the region located between –4.5 and –4.0 kb, in particular the CdRE, was necessary for cadmium-mediated induction of HO-1 gene expression in renal epithelial cells. Specific Cadmium-inducible DNA-Protein Interaction in Human Renal Epithelial Cells—Using oligonucleotides containing the CdRE region as well as the adjacent stress response element (StRE) sequence (Fig. 2A), nuclear extracts from vehicle, hemin, or cadmium-treated human renal proximal tubular cells were tested in an EMSA. As shown in Fig. 2B, a cadmium-inducible DNA-protein interaction was observed at 2 and 4 h following stimulation. Nuclear extracts from control and hemin-treated human renal proximal tubular cells did not demonstrate significant binding activity. Competition with a 50- and 100-fold excess of the CdRE oligonucleotide resulted in attenuation of the cadmium-inducible DNA-protein complex (lanes 2 and 3), whereas competition with an oligonucleotide containing a 2-bp mutation in the core CdRE sequence (mCdRE) failed to compete out the DNA-protein interaction (lanes 4 and 5) (Fig. 2C). An oligonucleotide containing both the CdRE and the adjacent StRE was able to compete out the DNA-protein complex (lanes 6 and 7); however, mutation of the CdRE in this oligonucleotide did not significantly affect DNA-protein binding (Fig. 2C, lanes 8 and 9). These results suggest that the CdRE and not the StRE is required for cadmium-inducible DNA-protein interaction in human renal epithelial cells. Pescadillo Interacts with the CdRE in Human Renal Epithelial Cells—To identify the protein binding to the CdRE, a yeast one-hybrid screen using four tandem repeats of the CdRE with a 12-bp intervening spacer sequence was used to screen a human kidney cDNA library. A total of 7 × 106 colonies were screened for growth on histidine-free plates, and 19 colonies were judged to be potential positives based on growth in the presence of 45 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. Plasmid DNAs isolated from these colonies were sequenced, and the corresponding proteins were identified from the GenBank™ data base (Table 2). Of the 15 clones that were sequenced, two DNA-associated proteins, elongation factor 1α and pescadillo, appeared to be likely candidates for further evaluation. Elongation factor 1α was a false positive, since it is known to bind to a site (GCGGAT) that was artificially created due to the intervening spacer sequence in the tandem repeats of the CdRE used as the bait. To examine if the nuclear localized protein, pescadillo, associated with the CdRE in vivo, a ChIP assay was performed on control, hemin, and cadmium-stimulated HK-2 cells. The primers and the probe used for the ChIP assay are indicated in Fig. 3 (top). As shown in Fig. 3, pescadillo associated with the CdRE region of the human HO-1 promoter in cadmium-induced HK-2 cells but not in control or hemin-stimulated cells.TABLE 2Positive clones identified using the yeast one-hybrid assayProteinFunctionAcyl-CoA dehydrogenaseThe homotetramer enzyme catalyzes the initial step of the mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation pathway.ADP-ATP carrier proteinCatalyzes the exchange of adenine nucleotides across the mitochondrial membrane.Aldolase BMetabolism of exogenous fructose.Aminopeptidase NZinc-dependent peptidase that catalyzes removal of N-terminal residues from peptides.ATP synthaseSynthesis of ATP from ADP.Capping protein (actin filament)“Caps” actin filaments, preventing loss of actin subunits.Chloride intracellular channel protein 1Nuclear localized; controls movement of calcium across nuclear membrane.Elongation factor 1 α1Transcription factor; false positive due to artificial binding site created in CdRE repetitive sequence.Enoyl coenzyme A hydratase 1Isomerization of 3-trans,5-cis-dienoyl-CoA to 2-trans,4-trans-dienoyl-CoA.Haplotype mitochondrionMitochondrial polymorphism of alleles.Hypothetical protein H17Predicted protein.Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinaseDirect activation of the stress-activated protein kinase and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase pathways by an inducible mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinase kinase 3 derivative.NADH dehydrogenaseFirst complex in electron transport chain; transfers electrons from NADH to coenzyme Q.PescadilloNuclear/nucleolar localized factor; used in ribosome biogenesis and DNA replication.YSC-like 1Potential protein chaperone (contains Src homology 3 domain). Open table in a new tab To further confirm the pescadillo-CdRE interaction, a GST-pescadillo fusion protein or GST alone was utilized. A Western blot confirming the identity of the GST-pescadillo fusion protein is shown in Fig. 4A. An EMSA was performed using the CdRE, which demonstrated a shift (asterisk) with GST-pescadillo but not with GST alone (Fig. 4B). A concentration-dependent increase in DNA-protein binding was observed when increasing amounts of the purified GST-Pes protein (1, 3, 5, and 7 μg) were used in the EMSA reaction with the CdRE oligonucleotide (Fig. 4C, top). The bottom of Fig. 4C shows a Coomassie-stained gel loaded with 1 (lane 1), 3 (lane 2), 5 (lane 3), and 7 μg (lane 4) of the GST-pescadillo protein and 1 μg of bovine serum albumin (lane 5). Densitometric analysis revealed that the full-length GST-pescadillo protein comprised ∼0, 0.170, 0.474, and 1.42 μg, respectively, although 1, 3, 5, and 7 μg of the fusion protein was loaded in each lane. The majority of the protein was seen at lower molecular weights (∼25 kDa). To confirm the specificity of the GST-Pes DNA binding, the CdRE oligonucleotide was incubated with GST-B23/nucleophosmin, another abundant nucleolar protein. No significant DNA-protein complex was observed (Fig. 4D, lane 3). Further confirmation for the specificity of the CdRE-Pes interaction was demonstrated by the absence of binding activity to a mutated CdRE (mallCdRE)(Fig. 4D, lane 4) or an AP-1 sequence (Fig. 4D, lane 5) or when an oligonucleotide lacking the CdRE core sequence was utilized (ΔCdRE) (Fig. 4D, lane 6). These in vitro results provide evidence of a specific interaction between pescadillo and the CdRE. To further confirm the specificity of the DNA-protein interaction, gel shift experiments using nuclear extracts f"

We and others have previously shown that cyclin D1 is up-regulated in melanoma cells through adhesion-independent MEK-ERK1/2 signaling initiated by mutant B-RAF. Here, we describe the regulation and role of cyclin D3 in human melanoma cells. Cyclin D3 expression was enhanced in a cell panel of human melanoma cell lines compared with melanocytes and was regulated by fibronectin-mediated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling but not MEK activity. RNA interference experiments demonstrated that cyclin D3 contributed to G1-S cell cycle progression and proliferation in melanoma cells. Overexpression of cyclin D1 did not recover the effects of cyclin D3 knockdown. Finally, immunoprecipitation studies showed that CDK6 is a major binding partner for cyclin D3, whereas CDK4 preferentially associated with cyclin D1. Together, these findings demonstrate that cyclin D3 is an important regulator of melanoma G1-S cell cycle progression and that D-type cyclins are differentially regulated in melanoma cells.

In early G1 CDK4 and CDK6 are activated in response to increased expression of D-type cyclins (1Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5159) Google Scholar). Three D-type cyclins are expressed in mammalian cells: D1, D2, and D3. Activation of CDK4/6 promotes hyperphosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein, release and derepression of E2F activity, and entry into S phase (2Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2393-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). Genetic depletion studies in mice have illustrated some non-overlapping roles for D-type cyclins. Cyclin D1-deficient mice display defects caused by reduced proliferation of retinal cells and mammary epithelial cells during pregnancy (3Sicinski P. Donaher J.L. Parker S.B. Li T. Fazeli A.

D-type cyclins are frequently overexpressed in human tumors due either to gene amplification or altered control of signaling pathways, and this overexpression likely contributes to aberrant cell cycle progression in many tumor types (5Sicinski P.

Metastatic melanoma is an aggressive skin cancer with a rising incidence rate. Currently, it is only effectively treated by early detection and surgery. Melanoma arises from the transformation of melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells in the skin, and its progression is well characterized (9Clark Jr., W.H. Elder D.E. Guerry D.t. Braitman L.E.

Radial growth phase is characterized by cell growth within the epidermis (in situ) or as nests in the papillary dermal layer (microinvasion). The vertical growth phase is associated with growth perpendicular to the skin surface and the gain of tumorigenic properties. Subsequent metastasis of melanoma to distant sites is associated with a poor prognosis. Expression of cyclin D1 is enhanced in primary and metastatic melanoma (10Florenes V.A. Faye R.S.

In addition to cyclin D1, cyclin D3 expression is readily detected in immunohistochemical studies on melanoma tissue and is associated with a poor prognosis (10Florenes V.A. Faye R.S. Maelandsmo G.M. Nesland J.M. Holm R. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 3614-3620PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclin D3 is expressed in a wide variety of cell types but compared with other D-type cyclins its regulation is poorly understood (17Bartkova J. Lukas J. Strauss M. Bartek J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1027-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Because the role of cyclin D3 in melanoma remains unknown, we analyzed its regulation and contribution to cell cycle progression in human melanoma cells. We find that cyclin D3 is aberrantly expressed in melanoma cells compared with melanocytes, is regulated by a fibronectin adhesion-dependent PI-3 kinase/Akt pathway, and contributes to cell cycle progression. Notably, the regulation and CDK binding partners of cyclin D3 show important differences compared with cyclin D1. Cell Culture—Normal human epidermal melanocytes (NHEM) were isolated from neonatal foreskins as previously described (14Conner S.R. Scott G. Aplin A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34548-34554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In brief, foreskins were obtained from The Birth Place at Albany Medical Center in accordance with an Institutional Review Board approved protocol. Foreskin tissue was incubated with dispase to separate the epidermis from the dermis. Cells were removed from epidermal sheets by trypsinization and cultured in MCDB 153 medium (Sigma) containing 0.2% (w/v) sodium bicarbonate, 0.5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 0.05% (v/v) bovine pituitary extract, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 10 μg/ml insulin, 1 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor, and 8 nm 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. NHEM from between passages 3 and 10 were used for experiments. Human melanoma SK-MEL-5, SK-MEL-24, and SK-MEL-28 cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). WM793, WM115, WM278, WM35, and SBcl2 cells were kindly donated by Dr. Meenhard Herlyn (Wistar Institute, Philadelphia). All melanoma cell lines were cultured in MCDB 153 medium containing 20% Leibovitz L-15 medium, 2% fetal bovine serum, 0.2% sodium bicarbonate, and 5 μg/ml insulin. RNA Interference (RNAi)—WM793 and SK-MEL-28 cells were transfected for 4 h with chemically synthesized short-interfering RNA (siRNA; Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) at a final concentration of 25 nm using OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested after a further 68 h. For cyclin D3, two distinct sequences were used: cyclin D3 siRNA #1 was 5′-GGAUCUUUGUGGCCAAGGAdTdT-3′, as previously utilized (6Sicinska E. Aifantis I. Le Cam L. Swat W. Borowski C. Yu Q. Ferrando A.A. Levin S.D. Geng Y. von Boehmer H. Sicinski P. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 451-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), and cyclin D3 siRNA #2 was 5′-GAUUAUACCUUUGCCAUGUUU-3′. For PTEN knockdown, the siRNA sequence used was 5′-GUGAAGAUCUUGACCAAUGUU-3′. Recombinant Lentiviral Transduction—Full-length human cyclin D1 cDNA was a gift from Dr. J. Zhao (Albany Medical College). The cyclin D1 sequence was subcloned into pEN-TR™/D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. To generate the blunt-ended PCR products for TOPO cloning, we used the KOD Hot Start DNA polymerase kit (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) with a reverse primer that omits the stop codon in order to put the open reading frame in-frame with the V5 epitope tag built into pLenti6/UbC/V5-DEST. Primer sequences are available upon request. pENTR/d-TOPO/cyclin D1 was recombined with pLenti6/UbC/V5-DEST using the LR Clonase II kit and protocol (Invitrogen) to generate pLenti6/UbC/V5-GW/cyclin D1. This construct was verified by DNA sequencing. Lentiviruses were generated by cotransfecting 293FT with pLenti6/UbC/V5-GW/cyclin D1 or pLenti6/UbC/V5-GW/LacZ (Invitrogen) and three lentiviral packaging plasmids (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's guidelines, with the exception that FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) was used for transfection. Viral supernatants were collected 72 h post-transfection. For transduction, cells were incubated for 72 h in the presence of lentiviral supernatant. Transduced cell populations were selected with 5 μg/ml blasticidin. Transduction efficiencies were >70%, as judged by transduction with green fluorescent lentivirus and immunostaining for the V5 tag. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Cells lysed in sample buffer were separated by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred electrophoretically onto Immobilon P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h and subsequently incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibodies used in this study were: Akt (clone 55), CDK4 (clone 97), and cyclin D1 (DCS-6), all from BD Biosciences; phospho-473 Akt, CDK6 (DCS-83), phospho-ERK1/2, phospho-Ser-780 Rb, and PTEN, all from Cell Signaling Technology, Beverley, MA; CDK2 (M2), cyclin A (H-432), and total ERK1/2 (clone K-23), all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; cyclin D3 (DCS-22), from Lab-Vision, Fremont, CA; β-galactosidase, from Promega, Madison WI; tubulin (clone KMX-1), from Chemicon, Temecula, CA. Membranes were washed in phosphate-buffered saline/Tween, and incubated with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugates (Calbiochem) for 1 h at room temperature. Western blots were developed using SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Immunoreactivity was detected and quantified using a Fluor-S Multi-Imager and Quantity-One software (Bio-Rad). Cell Adhesion—WM793 cells were serum-starved overnight before detachment with trypsin. Cells were pelleted in MCDB 153 medium containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and 1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Invitrogen). Cells were washed once and then resuspended in MCDB 153, 0.5% bovine serum albumin and re-plated onto fibronectin (BD Biosciences) or poly-lysine-coated dishes for 16 or 24 h. Human fibronectin (BD Biosciences) and poly-lysine (Sigma) were both used at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. Immunofluorescence—For analysis of S-phase entry after cyclin D3 knockdown, WM793 cells were replated onto coverslips for 12 h, and then bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) was added to the medium at a final concentration of 100 μm. After 8 h cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were further washed and permeabilized for 5 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100. Slides were then treated with 0.1 units/μl of DNase for 30 min at 37 °C. BrdUrd incorporation was analyzed with a sheep anti-BrdUrd antibody and rabbit anti-sheep IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Biodesign, Saco, MA). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst reagent 33342 (Molecular Probes Inc. Eugene, OR) at 1 μg/ml for 10 min at room temperature. For Ki67 staining cells were fixed in formaldehyde and processed as above but stained with anti-Ki67 (RB-9043, Lab-Vision) and anti-rabbit Alexa-Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes) antibodies. Fluorescent staining was viewed on an Olympus BX60 microscope equipped for epifluorescence. Images were captured using a Spot CCD camera and processed using deconvolution Slide Book software. For cell counting experiments, cells were detached with trypsin and counted using a hemocytometer. Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1% Triton X-100. Cyclin D3 (Ab-3, Lab-Vision), cyclin D1 (M-20, Santa Cruz), or V5 (Invitrogen) antibodies were incubated with cell lysates overnight at 4 °C. This was followed the next day by the addition of 40 μl of protein A/G agarose and further incubation for 2 h. Protein A/G-agarose complexes were washed three times with cold lysis buffer and boiled with SDS-PAGE sample buffer to dissociate the proteins. Expression of Cyclin D3 Is Enhanced in Human Melanoma Cells—We initially analyzed whether cyclin D3 expression is increased in a panel of human melanoma cell lines that display characteristics of different stages of melanoma progression (18Satyamoorthy K. DeJesus E. Linnenbach A.J. Kraj B. Kornreich D.L. Rendle S. Elder D.E. Herlyn M. Melanoma Res. 1997; 7: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). By Western blot analysis, cyclin D3 was expressed highly in the radial growth-phase cell lines WM35 and SBcl2, the vertical growth-phase WM793 and WM115 cells, and metastatic SK-MEL-28 and SK-MEL-5 cells (Fig. 1). Cyclin D3 was weakly expressed in vertical growth-phase WM278 cells, metastatic SK-MEL-24 cells, and NHEM from distinct donors. These findings show that expression of cyclin D3 is frequently enhanced in human melanoma cell lines. Notably, its expression does not tightly correlate with the expression of B-RAF mutations because SBcl2 cells express wild-type B-RAF (Table 1 and Refs. 13Davies H. Bignell G.R. Cox C. Stephens P.

Spofford L.S. Aram G. McMullen M. Pumiglia K. Aplin A.E. Oncogene. 2005; 12: 3459-3471Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To determine whether cyclin D3 was regulated by adhesion, we replated WM793 cells on fibronectin, a matrix that engages integrins, or poly-lysine to which cells attach independently of integrins. Cells attached efficiently to both fibronectin and poly-lysine but only spread on fibronectin. WM793 cells replated on fibronectin showed enhanced levels of cyclin D3 in comparison to cells on poly-lysine (Fig. 2, A and quantitated in B). WM793 cells did not undergo apoptosis in these conditions, as determined by staining for cleaved caspase 3 (21Boisvert-Adamo K. Aplin A.E. Oncogene. 2006; (Epub ahead of print PMID: 16547495)PubMed Google Scholar). Previous reports have shown that PI-3 kinase/Akt signaling regulates cyclin D3 in non-melanoma cell types at the level of translation (22Feng L.X. Ravindranath N. Dym M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25572-25576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 23De Vita G. Berlingieri M.T. Visconti R. Castellone M.D. Viglietto G. Baldassarre G. Zannini M.

Immunol. 2000; 30: 1757-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To investigate whether WM793 cell adhesion to fibronectin altered the PI-3 kinase/Akt pathway in melanoma cells, we probed lysates for levels of serine 473-phosphorylated Akt, an indicator of Akt activation. Adhesion of WM793 cells to fibronectin but not attachment to poly-lysine enhanced Akt phosphorylation at serine 473 (Fig. 2, C and D). Similarly, serine 473 phosphorylation of Akt was enhanced after adhesion of SK-MEL-28 cells to fibronectin (Fig. 2E). Thus, PI-3 kinase/Akt signaling and expression of cyclin D3 are adhesion-regulated in melanoma cells. PI-3 Kinase Signaling Regulates Cyclin D3 Expression—Our findings from Fig. 1 showed that some melanoma cell lines such as WM278 express low levels of cyclin D3 compared with others including WM793 and WM115. All three of these cell lines express mutant B-RAF. We examined the levels of phospho-Akt in these cell lines and observed that Akt phosphorylation was readily detected in WM793 and WM115 but poorly detected in normal melanocytes and WM278 cells (Fig. 3A). Expression of phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted from chromosome 10 (PTEN), a lipid phosphatase that inhibits PI-3 kinase signaling to Akt, is frequently altered in melanoma (26Stahl J.M. Cheung M. Sharma A. Trivedi N.R. Shanmugam S. Robertson G.P. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2881-2890PubMed Google Scholar, 27Guldberg P. thor Straten P. Birck A. Ahrenkiel V. Kirkin A.F. Zeuthen J.

Enhanced Akt phosphorylation in WM793 and WM115 cells correlated with decreased expression of PTEN and the detection of truncated PTEN products. To determine the role of PTEN and subsequent activation of Akt, we utilized RNAi to knock down PTEN in WM278 cells. PTEN-targeting siRNA efficiently down-regulated PTEN in WM278 cells (Fig. 3B). Concomitant with PTEN down-regulation was an increase in phosphorylation of Akt and cyclin D3 expression. To further examine the role of PI-3 kinase-Akt signaling in the regulation of cyclin D3 expression, we treated WM793 cells with LY294002, a PI-3 kinase inhibitor. LY294002 treatment was associated with a decrease in Akt phosphorylation and cyclin D3 levels (Fig. 3C). Comparable effects on Akt phosphorylation and cyclin D3 expression were observed after treatment of SK-MEL-28 cells with LY294002 (Fig. 3, D and E). In contrast, treatment of SK-MEL-28 cells with U0126, a MEK inhibitor, had no effect on cyclin D3 levels but reduced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and cyclin D1 expression (Fig. 3, D and E); these effects of U0126 on cyclin D1 are consistent with our previous report (16Bhatt K.V. Spofford L.S. Aram G. McMullen M. Pumiglia K. Aplin A.E. Oncogene. 2005; 12: 3459-3471Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Similar results utilizing these pharmacological inhibitors were observed in SK-MEL-5 cells (data not shown). Thus, PI-3 kinase but not MEK signaling regulates cyclin D3 levels in melanoma cells. Cyclin D3 Expression Is Required for G1 Cell Cycle Progression—We have previously reported that cyclin D1 is highly expressed and required for G1 cell cycle progression and S phase entry in WM793 cells (16Bhatt K.V. Spofford L.S. Aram G. McMullen M. Pumiglia K. Aplin A.E. Oncogene. 2005; 12: 3459-3471Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The requirement of cyclin D3 in melanoma is not known. We utilized RNAi to knock down levels of cyclin D3 in mutant B-RAF-expressing melanoma cells and determined the effects on two markers of progression through G1: phosphorylation of retinoblastoma at serine 780 and cyclin A expression. Cyclin D3 expression was reduced by an average of 84% with targeting siRNA in WM793 cells compared with cells transfected with a non-targeting siRNA (Fig. 4, A and quantitated in B). Importantly, cyclin D3 knockdown did not affect cyclin D1 levels, but phosphorylation of retinoblastoma at serine 780 and levels of cyclin A were reduced by 56 and 74%, respectively. Knockdown of cyclin D3 with a second distinct siRNA elicited similar effects on hyperphosphorylation of Rb and expression of cyclin A (Fig. 4C), indicating that the effects of cyclin D3 knockdown on G1 cell cycle events are not due to off-target effects. To ensure that our results were not exclusive to the WM793 cell line, we reduced cyclin D3 expression by RNAi in a second melanoma cell line, SK-MEL-28. Cyclin D3 knockdown again reduced cyclin A expression (Fig. 4D). The overall efficiency of knockdown was lower in SK-MEL-28 cells compared with WM793; cyclin D3 and cyclin A were reduced by 54 and 39%, respectively, in comparison to controls (Fig. 4E). Together, these data indicate that increased cyclin D3 expression in human melanoma cells contributes to G1 cell cycle progression. Cyclin D3 Contributes to S-phase Entry and Proliferation in Melanoma Cells—To determine whether cyclin D3 contributes to S phase entry, we measured incorporation of the thymidine analogue, BrdUrd, in control and cyclin D3 knockdown cells by immunofluorescence. BrdUrd incorporation was dramatically reduced after cyclin D3 knockdown (Fig. 5A). Quantitation showed that 34% of the cyclin D3 siRNA-transfected WM793 cells incorporated BrdUrd compared with 58% of control cells. Consistent with these effects, knockdown of cyclin D3 reduced the number of cells staining positively for the proliferation marker Ki67 by more than 50% (Fig. 5B) and decreased cell numbers (Fig. 5C). These results demonstrate that cyclin D3 contributes to melanoma cell S phase entry and proliferation. This requirement for cyclin D3 is in addition to a role of cyclin D1 in these cells (16Bhatt K.V. Spofford L.S. Aram G. McMullen M. Pumiglia K. Aplin A.E. Oncogene. 2005; 12: 3459-3471Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 Overexpression Does Not Rescue Cyclin D3 Knockdown Effects on Cyclin A—We previously demonstrated a requirement for cyclin D1 in melanoma cell G1 cell cycle progression (16Bhatt K.V. Spofford L.S. Aram G. McMullen M. Pumiglia K. Aplin A.E. Oncogene. 2005; 12: 3459-3471Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). One possibility is that the effects of cyclin D3 knockdown reflect a requirement for a certain level of total D-type cyclins. To test this, we coordinately overexpressed cyclin D1 and knocked down cyclin D3. We utilized a lentiviral transduction approach to efficiently transduce melanoma cells with V5 epitope-tagged human cyclin D1. As controls, non-transduced cells and lacZ-transduced cells were utilized. Western blotting of cell lysates with the V5 antibody identified tagged cyclin D1 and β-galactosidase in their respective cell lines but not in non-transduced cells (Fig. 6A). The exogenous cyclin D1 migrated slower than the endogenous due to the addition of the V5 epitope tag and was expressed at comparable levels to endogenous cyclin D1. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the exogenous cyclin D1 was functional in that it formed complexes with CDK4 (Fig. 6B). No CDK4 binding was detected in V5-β-galactosidase immunoprecipitates. Importantly, knockdown of cyclin D3 led to an efficient and comparable decrease in cyclin A expression in the non-transduced, lacZ-transduced, and cyclin D1-transduced cells (Fig. 6C). These results show that 2-fold enhanced expression of cyclin D1 is not able to rescue the effects of cyclin D3 knockdown on cyclin A expression. Cyclin D1 and Cyclin D3 Differentially Bind CDKs—To understand how cyclin D3 and cyclin D1 both contribute to G1 progression in melanoma cells, we analyzed their binding to CDKs, 2, 4, and 6 by co-immunoprecipitation. Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates before and after immunoprecipitation demonstrated that the majority of cyclin D3 and cyclin D1 were removed by immunoprecipitation with their respective antibodies (Fig. 7A). Immunoprecipitations were selective since cyclin D1 but not cyclin D3 was detected in D1 immunoprecipitates and vice versa in D3 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 7B). Analysis of CDK binding partners showed that CDK4 preferentially associated with cyclin D1, whereas CDK6 levels were enhanced in cyclin D3 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 7C). CDK2 was associated with cyclin D1 and to a lesser extent with cyclin D3. These findings suggest that cyclin D3 and cyclin D1 exhibit different associations with CDKs in melanoma cells. Because cyclin D3 but not cyclin D1 bound to CDK6, we utilized RNAi to knock down CDK6. In WM793 cells siRNA targeting CDK6 effectively knocked down expression of CDK6 without reducing expression of CDK4 (supplemental Fig. 1A). However, depletion of CDK6 did not dramatically affect cyclin A expression (supplemental Fig. 1A) or the cell cycle profile as determined by propidium iodide staining (supplemental Fig. 1B). Notably, in CDK6 knockdown cells, cyclin D3 showed enhanced association with CDK2 (supplemental Fig. 1C). This finding may explain, at least partially, the different effects on cell cycle progression upon cyclin D3 and CDK6 knockdown. In this study we show that cyclin D3 expression is enhanced in human melanoma cells and is regulated by adhesion-dependent PI-3 kinase/Akt signaling. Importantly, cyclin D3 expression is required for efficient G1-S cell cycle progression and proliferation in melanoma cells even though cyclin D1 is also highly expressed in these cells. Additionally, our data demonstrate that cyclins D3 and D1 are differentially regulated and have preferred CDK binding partners. Enhanced cyclin D3 expression in human melanoma cell lines supports earlier studies performed on tissue sections (10Florenes V.A. Faye R.S. Maelandsmo G.M. Nesland J.M. Holm R. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 3614-3620PubMed Google Scholar, 29Bartkova J. Zemanova M. Bartek J. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 65: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and adds to the growing evidence that cyclin D3 levels are increased in many types of cancer (6Sicinska E. Aifantis I. Le Cam L.

Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 6026-6034Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Importantly, we show that cyclin D3 is highly expressed in several melanoma lines including cells that display characteristics of radial growth phase (SBcl2 and WM35) and do not express B-RAF mutations (SBcl2). Hence, up-regulation of cyclin D3 may be an early event in melanoma progression. In melanoma cell lines that do not display enhanced cyclin D3 expression, other cell cycle alterations such as expression of low molecular weight forms of cyclin E may play a key role (32Bales E. Mills L. Milam N. McGahren-Murray M. Bandyopadhyay D. Chen D. Reed J.A. Timchenko N. van den Oord J.J. Bar-Eli M. Keyomarsi K. Medrano E.E. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 692-697PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclin D3 expression was regulated by adhesion and PI-3 kinase but did not require MEK activity. This regulation contrasts with our previous findings on cyclin D1 in melanoma cells showing that MEK-ERK1/2 signaling controls cyclin D1 levels in an adhesion-independent manner (16Bhatt K.V. Spofford L.S. Aram G. McMullen M. Pumiglia K. Aplin A.E. Oncogene. 2005; 12: 3459-3471Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Hence, D-type cyclins are differentially regulated in melanoma cells. Recent studies have provided evidence for the PI-3 kinase/Akt pathway positively regulating melanoma tumor development (26Stahl J.M. Cheung M. Sharma A. Trivedi N.R. Shanmugam S. Robertson G.P.

Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7002-7010Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that cyclin D3 is likely to be a major target for PI-3 kinase/Akt signaling in melanoma. PI-3 kinase signaling has been shown to regulate cyclin D3 in other cell types (22Feng L.X. Ravindranath N. Dym M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25572-25576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 23De Vita G. Berlingieri M.T. Visconti R. Castellone M.D. Viglietto G. Baldassarre G. Zannini M.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4569-4575PubMed Google Scholar) at the level of translation (25Naderi S. Gutzkow K.B. Christoffersen J. Smeland E.B. Blomhoff H.K. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 1757-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In our initial experiments, treatment of melanoma cells with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin also reduced cyclin D3 levels in SK-MEL-28 cells (data not shown). Evidence for an adhesion-PI-3 kinase-cyclin D3 pathway was primarily obtained from WM793 cells but was supported by experiments in additional melanoma cells lines including SK-MEL-28 and WM278. The extent to which D-type cyclins have non-redundant functions is an important issue. Deficiency of individual D-type cyclins reduces susceptibility to transformation mediated by different oncogenes. Loss of cyclin D1 alone is protective against breast tumors induced by oncogenic forms of Ras and Neu (38Yu Q. Geng Y. Sicinski P. Nature. 2001; 411: 1017-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar); cyclin D3 deficiency in hematopoietic progenitor cells protects against transformation induced by active Notch1 (6Sicinska E. Aifantis I. Le Cam L. Swat W. Borowski C. Yu Q. Ferrando A.A. Levin S.D. Geng Y. von Boehmer H. Sicinski P. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 451-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). We show that cyclin D3 expression is necessary for efficient entry into S phase and proliferation of melanoma cells; notably this is in addition to a similar requirement for cyclin D1 (16Bhatt K.V. Spofford L.S. Aram G. McMullen M. Pumiglia K. Aplin A.E. Oncogene. 2005; 12: 3459-3471Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Also, our data show that overexpression of cyclin D1 does not rescue cyclin D3 knockdown effects. Combined, our findings indicate that cyclin D3 and cyclin D1 serve at least some non-redundant roles in melanoma cells. Cyclin D3 preferentially partners CDK6, whereas cyclin D1 associates with CDK4. The former finding is consistent with the similar phenotypes observed between CDK6-/- and cyclin D3-/- mice (6Sicinska E. Aifantis I. Le Cam L. Swat W. Borowski C. Yu Q. Ferrando A.A. Levin S.D. Geng Y. von Boehmer H. Sicinski P. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 451-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 39Malumbres M. Sotillo R. Santamaria D. Galan J. Cerezo A. Ortega S. Dubus P. Barbacid M. Cell. 2004; 118: 493-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CDK6-cyclin D3 complexes show enhanced resistance to inhibition by p16INK4a (40Faast R. White J. Cartwright P. Crocker L. Sarcevic B. Dalton S. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Knockdown of CDK6 did not inhibit cell cycle progression possibly due to a redistribution of cyclin D3 to other CDK partners. The finding that D-type cyclins partner with CDK2 was not surprising since others have described the presence of cyclin D1-CDK2 complexes in breast cancer cells (41Sweeney K.J. Swarbrick A. Sutherland R.L. Musgrove E.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2865-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and senescent fibroblasts (42Dulic V. Drullinger L.F. Lees E. Reed S.I. Stein G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11034-11038Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mouse embryo fibroblasts deficient in both CDK4 and CDK6 are able to proliferate, albeit slower than wild-type counterparts (39Malumbres M. Sotillo R. Santamaria D. Galan J. Cerezo A. Ortega S. Dubus P. Barbacid M. Cell. 2004; 118: 493-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar); hence, it is possible that cyclin D-CDK2 complexes play an important role in proliferation. In summary, our data show that cyclin D3 is an important regulator of melanoma cell proliferation and together with other studies (11Sauter E.R. Yeo U.-C. von Stemm A. Zhu W. Litwin S. Tichansky D.S.

In addition to known pol III-transcribed genes, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome contains loci (ZOD1, ETC1-8) associated to incomplete pol III transcription complexes (Moqtaderi, Z., and Struhl, K. (2004) Mol. Cell. Biol. 24, 4118-4127). We show that a short segment of the ZOD1 locus, containing box A and box B promoter elements and a termination signal between them, directs the pol III-dependent production of a small RNA both in vitro and in vivo. In yeast cells, the levels of both ZOD1- and ETC5-specific transcripts were dramatically enhanced upon nucleosome depletion. Remarkably, transcription factor and pol III occupancy at the corresponding loci did not change significantly upon derepression, thus suggesting that chromatin opening activates poised pol III to transcription. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that the ZOD1 promoter is the only surviving portion of a tDNAIle ancestor, whose transcription capacity has been preserved throughout evolution independently from the encoded RNA product. Similarly, another TFIIIC/TFIIIB-associated locus, close to the YGR033c open reading frame, was found to be the strictly conserved remnant of an ancient tDNAArg. The maintenance, by eukaryotic genomes, of chromatin-repressed, non-coding transcription units has implications for both genome expression and organization.

In eukaryotes, RNA polymerase (pol) 3The abbreviations used are: pol, RNA polymerase; TF, transcription factor; MNase, micrococcal nuclease; ORF, open reading frame; SINE, short interspersed elements; fw, forward; rev, reverse. III, assisted by a specific set of basal transcription factors (TFIIIA, TFIIIB, TFIIIC), transcribes at high efficiency the genes for tRNAs, 5 S rRNA, and a few other non-translated RNAs. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, these include the RNA component of RNase P, the U6 small nuclear RNA, and the cytoplasmic RNA of the signal recognition particle, encoded respectively by the RPR1, SNR6, and SCR1 genes (1Lee J.Y.

Parker R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4619-4625Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The genomes of higher eukaryotes also contain a variety of extremely abundant, repetitive short interspersed elements (SINEs) that have evolved from tRNA or 7SL RNA genes and maintain a pol III promoter (5White R.J. RNA Polymerase III Transcription. Third Ed. Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX2002Google Scholar). SINE transcription by pol III can influence the expression of other genes, both at the transcriptional and at the post-transcriptional levels (5White R.J. RNA Polymerase III Transcription. Third Ed. Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX2002Google Scholar, 6Allen T.A. Von Kaenel S. Goodrich J.A. Kugel J.F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 816-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Up to now, no tRNA gene-derived transcription unit has been identified in yeast genomes. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses in S. cerevisiae have recently revealed several new loci that are associated to the pol III transcription machinery (7Harismendy O. Gendrel C.G. Soularue P. Gidrol X. Sentenac A. Werner M. Lefebvre O. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4738-4747Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 8Roberts D.N. Stewart A.J. Huff J.T. Cairns B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14695-14700Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 9Moqtaderi Z. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4118-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). One of them, SNR52, encodes a C/D box small nucleolar RNA. Other newly identified loci appear to be associated to incomplete transcription machinery. One of these loci has been named ZOD1 (for zone of disparity) because its occupancy by pol III was found to be disproportionately low when compared with TFIIIC occupancy (9Moqtaderi Z. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4118-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In another study, the same locus (referred to as iYML089c) was found to be associated to appreciable levels of pol III (8Roberts D.N. Stewart A.J. Huff J.T. Cairns B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14695-14700Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Other loci named ETC (for extra TFIIIC) are occupied by the TFIIIC subunit Tfc4 at levels comparable with those of standard class III genes, whereas TFIIIB and pol III are absent (9Moqtaderi Z. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4118-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). One of the ETC loci, ETC5, corresponds to the previously identified RNA170 gene, whose transcription product was previously detected in vivo (4Olivas W.M. Muhlrad D. Parker R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4619-4625Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In contrast, no transcription products have been identified for the remaining ETC loci and for ZOD1, yet they all contain a box B and additional conserved residues, suggesting a biologically relevant pol III function (9Moqtaderi Z. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4118-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The lack of ZOD1 expression under standard growth conditions is especially intriguing as pol III seems to be present at this locus. In this study, we show that nucleosome depletion dramatically enhances the expression of both ZOD1 and ETC5 without affecting their occupancy by the pol III machinery. By comparative genomic analysis, we also found that ZOD1 originates from an ancient tRNAIle gene, whose box B has been strictly conserved throughout evolution of the hemiascomycetes, and we identified another TFIIIC/TFIIIB-associated element in the S. cerevisiae genome as a conserved tDNAArg remnant. DNA Templates—The S. cerevisiae ZOD1 locus was amplified from yeast genomic DNA (strain S288C) using the high fidelity Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega) and the following oligonucleotide primers: ZOD1_fw, 5′-TTCGGGTGCCAATTTAGCGTGC-3′; ZOD1_rev, 5′-AGTGTCGGCCACCTGATAAAGG-3′. The amplified fragment (420 bp) was inserted into the pCRTOPO vector. The sequence of the insert, containing the ZOD1 transcribed sequence (55 bp) plus 170 bp of 5′-flanking and 195 bp of 3′-flanking sequence, was found to exactly match the sequence retrieved from Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD). A BamHI-PstI ZOD1-containing restriction fragment was excised from pCRTOPO-ZOD1 and subcloned into pNEB193 and into the YEp352 shuttle vector (for in vivo analysis) (10Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Yeast Strains—The thermosensitive, slow growth brf1-II.6 strain harbors a double aspartate to alanine substitution in Brf1, one of the components of TFIIIB (11Andrau J.C. Sentenac A. Werner M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 511-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 12Conesa C. Ruotolo R. Soularue P. Simms T.A. Donze D. Sentenac A. Dieci G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8631-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The 13 Myc-tagged strains were constructed following a previously described strategy (13Longtine M.S. McKenzie A. II I Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4189) Google Scholar). All strains were derived from UKY403 (14Han M. Grunstein M. Cell. 1988; 55: 1137-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 15Kim U.J. Han M. Kayne P. Grunstein M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2211-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The epitope coding sequence was inserted between the last codon and the stop codon of BDP1, RET1, and TFC4 ORFs at the corresponding genomic loci. Expression of Myc-tagged proteins was verified by Western blot analysis using the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody. No growth defect was detected in the tagged strains. A Δzod1 S. cerevisiae strain was constructed by one-step gene replacement integrating kanMX in the ZOD1 locus of YPH500 strain, that removed all the ZOD1 transcribed region plus 146 bp of 5′-flanking and 87 bp of 3′-flanking sequence. The disruption cassette was obtained by PCR amplification of the kanMX coding sequence from the Δgcn4 strain of the yeast gene knock-out collection (Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL) using the following oligonucleotide primers: ZOD1DEL_fw, 5′-CGATCTAACTATTCTGTAAATTCTGTAGTGACTCTTTAGGGCGTACGCTGCAGGTCGAC-3′; ZOD1DEL_rev, 5′-AAATGGAAAGGGAAAAATTAAGGCTGCGAAAATTAATAATAATCGATGAATTCGAGCTCG-3′. For phenotype analysis, ZOD1 deletion and overexpression (YPH500 transformed with YEp352-ZOD1) strains were grown in liquid YPD cultures to the same density and then spotted at increased dilutions on either rich or minimal media containing either glucose, glycerol, or galactose as a carbon source and various drugs (hydroxyurea, rapamycin, cycloheximide), at 15, 30, or 37 °C. In Vitro Transcription and DNA Binding Assays—ZOD1 in vitro transcription and primer extension analysis were carried out using a reconstituted transcription system from S. cerevisiae, as described previously (16Dieci G. Percudani R. Giuliodori S. Bottarelli L. Ottonello S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 601-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For gel retardation assays, a 420-bp ZOD1-containing fragment, 5′-end-labeled on the sense strand, was generated by PCR using 5′-labeled ZOD1_fw and unlabeled ZOD1_rev as primers. 3 fmol of DNA were then incubated with 0.6 μg of TFIIIC purified up to the DEAE-Sephadex A-25 step (16Dieci G. Percudani R. Giuliodori S. Bottarelli L. Ottonello S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 601-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17Huet J. Manaud N. Dieci G. Peyroche G. Conesa C. Lefebvre O. Ruet A. Riva M. Sentenac A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 249-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding conditions and native gel electrophoresis were as described previously (3Dieci G. Giuliodori S. Catellani M. Percudani R. Ottonello S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6903-6914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For DNase I footprinting analysis, 4 fmol of the same DNA fragment were incubated with 0.6 μg of TFIIIC in an 18-μl binding mixture containing 166 mm KCl, 10 μg/ml pBlueScript-KS plasmid DNA, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. Complexes were treated with 0.5 ng (0.05 units) of pancreatic DNaseI for 1 min at 25 °C. The digestion was stopped with 20 mm EDTA. Digested DNA was phenol-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and fractionated as described (3Dieci G. Giuliodori S. Catellani M. Percudani R. Ottonello S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6903-6914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In Vivo Transcription Analyses—Total RNA was purified as described (18Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar) from yeast cells grown to A600 = 0.8-1 in the appropriate selective medium and temperature. For Northern blot analysis, 15 μg of total RNA were loaded on a 6% polyacrilamide-7M urea minigel and then transferred to nylon membrane (Gene Screen Plus™, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and hybridized as described (3Dieci G. Giuliodori S. Catellani M. Percudani R. Ottonello S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6903-6914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For ZOD1 RNA detection, the probe was the radiolabeled oligonucleotide 5′-GCTAAGTGAACTACTTATCCAAAGC-3′. For detection of ETC5/RNA170 transcript, a double-stranded DNA probe was produced by random priming labeling using an ETC5 fragment amplified from yeast genomic DNA with the oligonucleotides ETC5_fw, 5′-TAGCGTTACGTTCGATACCTTCAC-3′, and ETC5_rev (5′-GGGCTAGTCTTAGTTTGATTGAGC-3′. The probe used for detection of tRNAAla(AGC) was an oligonucleotide complementary to the mature tRNA sequence. The U3-specific probe was 5′-CTTTGCCGTTGCATTTGTAGTTTTTTCCTTTGGAAGT-3′. Strains UKY403 and MHY308 (14Han M. Grunstein M. Cell. 1988; 55: 1137-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 15Kim U.J. Han M. Kayne P. Grunstein M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2211-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) were employed to analyze the effects of nucleosome depletion on ZOD1 and ETC5 transcription. The glucose shift experiments were carried out as described previously (19Marsolier M.C. Tanaka S. Livingstone-Zatchej M. Grunstein M. Thoma F. Sentenac A.

Each culture was then halved, spun down, and resuspended: half in galactose-containing medium and half in glucose-containing medium. These cultures were incubated for different time periods at 30 °C and then subjected to micrococcal nuclease (MNase) treatment, as follows. Each culture was incubated with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature for cross-linking, and then the reaction was blocked by adding glycine to 330 mm for 10 min. Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in sorbitol buffer (0.9 m sorbitol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 40 mm β-mercaptoethanol) plus zymolyase 100T (0.1 mg/A600). After 15 min of incubation at 25 °C, the spheroplasts were washed twice with 20 ml of sorbitol buffer and resuspended in 0.4 ml/10 A600 units of Nonidet P-40 buffer (1 m sorbitol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm spermidin, 0.075% Nonidet P-40). The spheroplasts were then split into 0.4-ml aliquots and digested with increasing amounts of MNase (Roche Applied Science) for 20 min. The digestion was stopped with 5 mm EDTA, 1% SDS. Proteinase K (80 μg) was added, and the samples were incubated for at least 6 h at 56 °C to revert the cross-linking. Genomic DNA was phenolextracted and ethanol-precipitated. For the analyses reported in Fig. 5, MNase-digested bulk chromatin was fractionated on 1% agarose gels. The probe for the Southern hybridization shown in Fig. 5B was a radiolabeled double-stranded DNA fragment PCR-amplified from genomic DNA with the following oligonucleotide primers: fw_A1, 5′-AGGGCGAAGTACGTATTTC-3′; rev_B2, 5′-GCATGATAAAGCCTCACCC-3′. For the analysis in Fig. 4, genomic DNA was restricted with XbaI (30 units/sample) for 12 h at 37 °C. After phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, the restricted DNA was used for a low resolution analysis by indirect labeling. DNA was fractionated on a 1.4% agarose gel and blotted onto BioBond™-Plus nylon membrane following Southern's method. The probe for Southern blotting was a radiolabeled DNA fragment PCR-amplified from genomic DNA with the following oligonucleotide primers: fw, 5′-GTCTTTGCTTATTGTATGCC-3′; rev, 5′-CAGAGTCGGTAGTAGATACC-3′.FIGURE 4Micrococcal nuclease mapping of chromatin structure at the ZOD1 locus. Chromatin from MHY308 (lanes 1-4) or UKY403 (lanes 5-7) cells, grown in galactose (lanes 2 and 5) or shifted to glucose-containing medium for 6 h (lanes 3, 4, 6, and 7), was digested with MNase (for lanes 4 and 7, a 2-fold higher concentration was used with respect to the other lanes). Lane 8, digestion of deproteinized DNA. Lane 1, no digestion. The migration of DNA size markers run in parallel is shown on the left (M). Nucleosome positioning, under conditions of unperturbed chromatin structure (observed in lanes 2-5), is schematically illustrated on the left (positioned nucleosomes are indicated as orange ovals). Crescents indicate the putative position of components of the transcription machinery. In the scheme on the right, disorganized nucleosomes are indicated by dotted ovals. Black arrows indicate the positions of primers used to prepare the Southern hybridization probe. The position of the ZOD1 transcription unit is also indicated on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Cross-linked chromatin was prepared essentially as described (20Kuras L. Struhl K. Nature. 1999; 399: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 21Kuras L. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 284: 147-162PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures (200 ml) were grown exponentially in galactose-containing medium to A600 = 0.6. 100 ml of culture were then crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min, whereas the rest of the culture was collected, washed, diluted to A600 = 0.3, incubated in a glucose-containing medium for 6 h, and then fixed. Immunoprecipitation was performed using the anti-Myc 9E10 mouse monoclonal antibody (a gift from the DRIP, CEA/Saclay). Immunoprecipitated DNA was purified as described (20Kuras L. Struhl K. Nature. 1999; 399: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) and analyzed by quantitative PCR on an ABI Prism 7000 instrument (Applied Biosystems). The PCR reactions were carried out in 25-μl mixtures containing 0.4 μm each primer and 12.5 μl of Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix UDG (Invitrogen). Data were collected on the ABI Prism 7000. The associated software was used to calculate cycle threshold values with hand-refining. Relative quantification using a standard curve method was performed, and the occupancy level for a specific fragment was defined as the ratio of immunoprecipitated DNA over total DNA. Three independents experiments were averaged. The following PCR primers were used: fw, 5′-CTTTTGGCGCTTTGGATAAG-3′, rev, 5′-CACATGCGAGAAAATGGAAA-3′ for ZOD1; fw, 5′-CGTATAAGCCGCAAGGAAAA-3′, rev, 5′-TCTGAACCCAGTGTCAAACG-3′ for ETC5; fw, 5′-ACATTTCCACACCCTGGAAC-3′, rev, 5′-TTCTTCGCGAGAACAATTCA-3′ for GAL1 ORF; fw, 5′-GCTTCAGTAGCTCAGTAGGAA-3′, rev, 5′-TGCTCCAGGGGAGGTTC-3′ for tM(CAU)D; fw, 5′-CGCTGAGTGAGACGCTAACA-3′, rev, 5′-ATCCAAAGCCGTAGCAAGTG-3′ for ETC2; fw, 5′-TCGAGAAAGCCTGGATGAGT-3′, rev, 5′-TATTACTGCCATCGCCACAA-3′ for ETC6; fw, 5′-CCTGGTGCCGTTAGCTATTC-3′, rev, 5′-GAAACGAACCCAACGAGTGT-3′ for ETC7; fw, 5′-CTTCTTGTCCCCGTTAACCA-3′, rev, 5′-AGCCGGACGGAATTTATAGC-3′ for iYMR103c; fw, 5′-TTCCGAAACTTCCCAAGAAA-3′, rev, 5′-TCGAACCTGGACATGAAAAA-3′ for iYGR033c. Control chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments were performed with the untagged UKY403 strain. The ZOD1 Promoter Supports Efficient pol III-dependent Transcription—Sequence analysis of the ZOD1 locus revealed the presence of putative box A and box B promoter elements separated by ∼30 bp (Fig. 1A) (8Roberts D.N. Stewart A.J. Huff J.T. Cairns B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14695-14700Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). A stretch of nine Ts is positioned between box A and box B, a situation reminiscent of both SNR6 and SNR52 genes, where the box B is located downstream of a poly(dT) termination signal (22Brow D.A. Guthrie C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 23Braglia P. Percudani R. Dieci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19551-19562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A gel retardation assay (Fig. 1B) confirmed that TFIIIC binds stably to ZOD1, as observed in vivo. DNase I protection analysis further showed that TFIIIC specifically contacts the box B region, whereas box A protection was less evident (Fig. 1C). Protection in the box B region extended well downstream of the conserved box B sequence motif and ended with a strongly hypersensitive site 20 bp downstream of the box B. In vitro transcription analysis using a pol III-specific reconstituted system showed the TFIIIC-dependent production of an ∼55-nucleotide transcript (Fig. 1D). As revealed by primer extension analysis (Fig. 1E), such a transcript starts at a G located 17 bp upstream of the box A. The transcript size is perfectly explained by termination at the run of T residues between box A and box B. Detection and pol III Dependence of ZOD1 RNA in Vivo—The above results suggest that the previously reported failure to detect ZOD1 RNA in yeast cells (9Moqtaderi Z. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4118-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) is not due to intrinsic promoter defects of ZOD1. As shown in Fig. 2A, we also failed to detect a ZOD1 RNA in vivo in the YPH500 strain by Northern blot analysis (lane 1). The DNA oligonucleotide probe efficiently detected the in vitro-produced ZOD1 transcript (lane 4), but a ZOD1-specific RNA could only be detected in vivo after transformation of YPH500 with a YEp352-ZOD1 multicopy plasmid (cf. lanes 2 and 3). This RNA had the same size of the one produced in vitro. As shown in Fig. 2B, in vivo accumulation of the ZOD1 RNA was dependent on the pol III transcription machinery as its levels were 7-fold reduced in the pol III transcription-defective brf1-II.6 mutant strain (11Andrau J.C. Sentenac A. Werner M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 511-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (cf. lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 1 and 2). Nucleosome Depletion Strongly Activates ZOD1 and ETC5 Expression—Class III genes are generally characterized by extremely high transcription rates (24Dieci G. Sentenac A. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 202-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 25Ferrari R. Rivetti C. Acker J. Dieci G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13442-13447Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We considered chromatin-mediated repression as a possible reason for the unusually low levels of in vivo ZOD1 expression. To test this hypothesis, we used a yeast strain (UKY403) that survives with a single histone H4 gene under the control of the GAL1 promoter. Shifting the UKY403 strain to a glucose-containing medium blocks histone H4 gene expression, thus causing a global nucleosome loss and consequent growth arrest. The same shift is without effect on the isogenic MHY308 control strain, in which the histone H4 gene is under the control of its own promoter (14Han M. Grunstein M. Cell. 1988; 55: 1137-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 15Kim U.J. Han M. Kayne P. Grunstein M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2211-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, upon histone H4 depletion, the 55-nucleotide ZOD1 RNA became detectable in UKY403 even in the absence of ZOD1 extra copies (lane 2). The low levels of ZOD1 RNA observed in the presence of extra gene copies (lane 6) were increased 10-fold upon histone H4 depletion in UKY403 (lane 7), whereas they were unchanged in the MHY308 control strain (lane 9). Note that no activation was observed for the tRNAAla(AGC) gene family upon nucleosome depletion (Fig. 3A). 4Although the tRNAAla(AGC) detected in Fig. 3A is the mature tRNA form and not the primary transcript, transcriptional derepression of the corresponding tDNAs would have resulted in increased levels of the mature tRNA. The levels of other pol III-synthesized RNAs, such as SNR52 and SCR1 transcripts, were unaffected by nucleosome depletion (data not shown and Ref. 3Dieci G. Giuliodori S. Catellani M. Percudani R. Ottonello S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6903-6914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), in agreement with an early study showing that there is no global change in pol III transcription upon nucleosome depletion (15Kim U.J. Han M. Kayne P. Grunstein M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2211-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We also analyzed the expression profile, before and after nucleosome loss, of another locus associated to incomplete pol III machinery, ETC5 (9Moqtaderi Z. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4118-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This locus has previously been called RNA170 because it encodes a pol III transcript of ∼170 nucleotides (4Olivas W.M. Muhlrad D. Parker R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4619-4625Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, nucleosome depletion produced a 15-fold increase in the levels of RNA170 transcript (cf. lanes 2 and 3). Chromatin Structure of the ZOD1 Locus—Nucleosome organization of the ZOD1 locus under standard conditions or after histone H4 depletion was analyzed by MNase digestion using the UKY403 and MHY308 strains. As shown in Fig. 4, low resolution chromatin analysis of both strains grown in galactose-containing medium (lanes 2 and 5) showed an organized nucleosomal ladder starting immediately downstream of the ZOD1 transcription unit that appears extensively protected from MNase digestion, possibly due to the presence of a nucleosome or of bound transcription factors. This MNase digestion pattern did not change upon the shift of MHY308 to glucose-containing medium (lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, shifting to glucose, the UKY403 strain led, after 6 h, to a dramatic increase in MNase sensitivity in the entire region, suggesting a diffuse loss of chromatin organization (Fig. 4, cf. lanes 6 and 7 with lane 5). The correlation between transcriptional derepression and nucleosome loss at the ZOD1 locus was investigated in more detail by doing time course analyses of both phenomena. Fig. 5A, lanes 1-17, shows an ethidium bromide staining of MNase-treated bulk chromatin purified from UKY403 cells grown in galactose (lanes 1-5) or incubated in glucose for 60 (lanes 6-9), 120 (lanes 10-13), or 240 min (lanes 14-17). A nucleosomal ladder is evident in the samples from cells grown in galactose. Chromatin from cells shifted 60 or 120 min in glucose maintains a general nucleosomal organization, although the ladder appears slightly smeared, suggesting a partial loss of nucleosomes in several defined genomic loci due to histone H4 depletion (14Han M. Grunstein M. Cell. 1988; 55: 1137-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). After 240 min in glucose, chromatin does not show any sign of nucleosomal organization (lanes 14-17). Since under these conditions, UKY403 cells appear more resistant to MNase treatment, we repeated the treatment on both UKY403 and MHY308 cells, after a 240-min glucose shift, in the presence of increased MNase concentrations (Fig. 5A, lanes 18-29). The MNase digestion profile of bulk chromatin from MHY308 control cells produced a well detectable nucleosomal ladder (lanes 21-23), whereas no nucleosomal ladder was observed in the case of UKY403 cells (cf. lanes 28-29 with lanes 22-23). We conclude that chromatin from UKY403 cells shifted to glucose starts to show a partial disorganization after 1 h and appears to be seriously nucleosome-depleted only 240 min after the glucose shift. This result is coherent with the previously observed cell cycle block at 4 h from shift (15Kim U.J. Han M. Kayne P. Grunstein M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2211-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We next analyzed global changes in chromatin organization at the ZOD1 locus (Fig. 5B). The same gels shown in panel A (lanes 1-17) were blotted and Southern-hybridized with a ZOD1-specific probe. Although cells grown in galactose (Fig. 5B, lanes 1-5) show a perfectly normal nucleosomal ladder, chromatin from cells grown 60, 120, or 240 min in glucose (lanes 6-9, 10-13, and 14-17, respectively) produced only a smeared profile, which is diagnostic of complete chromatin disorganization. From this evidence, we can conclude that the ZOD1 locus chromatin is especially sensitive to histone H4 depletion. To see whether there is a correlation between chromatin disorganization and transcriptional derepression at the ZOD1 locus, we analyzed by Northern blot the time course of ZOD1 transcript accumulation following glucose shift of UKY403 cells. As shown in Fig. 5C, the levels of ZOD1 RNA were already increased significantly 1 h after glucose shift, and a 30-fold activation was observed after 4 h (Fig. 5C, cf"

LigD consists of an ATP-dependent ligase domain fused to a polymerase domain (POL) and a phosphoesterase module. The POL domain performs templated and nontemplated primer extension reactions with either dNTP or rNTP substrates. Here we report that Pseudomonas LigD POL is an unfaithful nucleic acid polymerase. Although the degree of infidelity in nucleotide incorporation varies according to the mispair produced, we find that a correctly paired ribonucleotide is added to the DNA primer terminus more rapidly than the corresponding correct deoxyribonucleotide and incorrect nucleotides are added much more rapidly with rNTP substrates than with dNTPs, no matter what the mispair configuration. We find that 3′ mispairs are extended by LigD POL, albeit more slowly than 3′ paired primer-templates. The magnitude of the rate effect on mismatch extension varies with the identity of the 3′ mispair, but it was generally the case that mispaired ends were extended more rapidly with rNTP substrates than with dNTPs. These results lend credence to the suggestion that LigD POL might fill in short 5′-overhangs with ribonucleotides when repairing double strand breaks in quiescent cells. We report that LigD POL can add a deoxynucleotide opposite an abasic lesion in the template strand, albeit slowly. Ribonucleotides are inserted more rapidly at an abasic lesion than are deoxys. LigD POL displays feeble activity in extending a preformed primer terminus opposing an abasic site, but can readily bypass the lesion by slippage of the primer 3′ di- or trinucleotide and realignment to the template sequence distal to the abasic site. Covalent benzo[a]pyrene-dG and benzo[c]phenanthrene-dA adducts in the template strand are durable roadblocks to POL elongation.

The LigD POL domain catalyzes either nontemplated single nucleotide additions to a blunt-ended duplex DNA or fill-in synthesis at a 5′-tailed duplex DNA; these are the molecular signatures of mutagenic mycobacterial NHEJ in vivo at bluntend and 5′-overhang DSBs, respectively (2Gong C.

During templated synthesis in the presence of dNTPs on a DNA primer-template with an 18-nucleotide 5′ tail, the primer is elongated to the end of the template strand and then further extended with a single nontemplated nucleotide (2Gong C. Bongiorno P. Martins A. Stephanou N.C. Zhu H. Shuman S. Glickman M.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 5Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 418-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). LigD POL can also add templated ribonucleotides to a DNA primer, but extension is limited to about 4 cycles of rNMP incorporation because the primer-template is rendered progressively less active as ribonucleotides accumulate at the 3′ end (6Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25973-25981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These properties suggest that the initial insertions preceding the strand sealing step of NHEJ might involve rNMP incorporation and that the ability of LigD to use rNTPs as substrates might be advantageous for the repair of chromosomal breaks that arise in quiescent cells, insofar as the dNTP pool might be limiting when bacteria are not actively replicating. The ribonucleotide addition reactions of LigD POL are of particular interest given its structural similarity to the catalytic subunit of archaeal/eukaryal primase (9Zhu H. Nandakumar J. Aniukwu J.

Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 913-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). LigD POL lacks a distinctive helical domain appended to archaeal primase as an insert to the sequence of the catalytic domain; it also lacks the zinc-binding motif located within the primase catalytic domain (9Zhu H. Nandakumar J. Aniukwu J. Wang L.K. Glickman M.S. Lima C.D. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1711-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, LigD POL is a minimized version of an archaeal primase-polymerase. It is the first example of such a protein in the bacterial domain of life, and one with a novel role in DNA repair rather than priming of DNA replication. Eukaryal DNA primase is optimally active in the presence of manganese (15Kirk B.W. Kuchta R.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10126-10134Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and displays an exceptionally high rate of nucleotide misincorporation during templated RNA synthesis (16Sheaff R.J.

To our knowledge, studies of the fidelity of archaeal primase-polymerase during templated synthesis have not been reported. The issue of whether LigD POL is a relatively faithful or unfaithful enzyme during templated synthesis is pertinent, given the mutagenic quality of NHEJ in vivo. Here we examine the fidelity of the POL component of Pseudomonas LigD, focusing on the following questions. How does the rate of incorporation of the correctly base-paired nucleotide compare with the rates of misincorporation of incorrect nucleotides? Is POL fidelity influenced by whether the incoming substrate is a ribonucleotide or a deoxyribonucleotide? How does LigD POL perform in extending a primer containing a preformed 3′ base mismatch? Does its capacity to extend a mismatch depend on whether the enzyme is in DNA polymerase or RNA polymerase mode? We also address the effects of two kinds of DNA lesions on LigD POL activity: abasic sites and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-DNA adducts. Abasic lesions, which can arise by spontaneous hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond or base excision catalyzed by DNA glycosylases, comprise a very common form of DNA damage. Abasic sites can elicit different responses from different DNA polymerases, ranging from arrest of the replication fork to bypass of the lesion. Bypass entails two distinct polymerization steps: insertion of a dNMP across from the abasic site (ostensibly without the benefit of instructional base pairing) and subsequent extension from the 3′-dNMP:abasic terminus (26Prakash S. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 317-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 27Haracska L. Unk I. Johnson R.E. Johansson E. Burgers P.M. Prakash S. Prakash L.

Here we query how LigD POL behaves when it encounters an abasic site on the template strand at positions opposite from or immediately flanking the 3′ nucleotide of the primer strand. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as benzo-[a]pyrene (BP) and benzo[c]phenanthrene (BPh) are potent environmental carcinogens. BP and BPh are converted in vivo to bay- or fjord-region diol epoxides, which react with the deoxyadenosine (dA) or deoxyguanosine (dG) bases in DNA to form covalent PAH-DNA adducts that either occupy the minor groove (BPdG) or intercalate between base pairs (BPhdA) (29Geacintov N.E.

The products were visualized by autoradiography. Where indicated, primer extension was quantified by scanning the gel with a Fujifilm BAS-2500 imager. The percentage of input primer extended was plotted as a function of reaction time. The data were then normalized to the end point values for extension (defined as 100%) and the apparent rate constant (k) for the initial addition step was calculated by fitting the normalized data to the equation: 100 – % extension(norm) = 100 e–kt. Nucleotide Misincorporation by LigD POL—The initial characterization of the templated DNA polymerase activity of Pseudomonas LigD POL included a set of dNTP omission experiments, in which the polymerase was expected to arrest primer elongation when it encountered a template position for which the “correct” dNTP was missing from the reaction mixture. Even when the reactions were performed at low dNTP concentrations (1 μm), the enzyme was able to elongate past some of the predicted arrest sites (5Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 418-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These findings raised the prospect that LigD POL misincorporates dNMPs. In light of the recently reported crystal structure of LigD POL revealing its similarity to the archaeal/eukaryal primase-polymerase family (9Zhu H. Nandakumar J. Aniukwu J. Wang L.K. Glickman M.S.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12367-12374Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we undertook here to examine the extent to which LigD might also be unfaithful. A set of four primer-templates was prepared that consisted of a 13-mer 5′ 32P-labeled DNA primer strand annealed to a complementary 18-mer DNA strand to form a 13-bp duplex with a five-nucleotide single-stranded 5′ tail (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4). The primertemplates differed only in the identity of the template deoxynucleotide base immediately flanking the 3′-OH primer terminus. We measured the rate of extension of the primertemplate (25 nm) by excess POL (1.4 μm) in the presence of single dNTP or rNTP substrates (10 μm), and thereby probed all possible misincorporation events. A shorter time course was monitored for the reactions containing the correct dNTP and rNTP (e.g. 5 s, 15 s, 30 s, 1 min, and 2 min) than for those containing only mispaired nucleotides (which were sampled at 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 min in panels A in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4).FIGURE 2Kinetics of nucleotide addition at a templated dA base.

When presented with the correct deoxyribonucleotide dATP, LigD POL sequentially incorporated two dAMP residues in response to the TT sequence in the template strand. Whereas 44% of the input primer was extended by at least one nucleotide in 5 s with dATP, 93% of the input primer was elongated in 5 s with ATP. Extension by two nucleotides was virtually complete within 1 min for both dATP and ATP and there was no further elongation beyond the n+2 position within the time frame of the experiment. By quantifying the fraction of the input primer extended, we obtained the kinetic profiles for the first adenosine nucleotide addition step shown in Fig. 1B. The correct ribonucleotide was more rapidly utilized by LigD POL (apparent rate constant of ∼0.6 s–1 for ATP) than was the correctly paired deoxynucleotide (the kobs for dATP being 0.13 s–1). Control experiments showed that the apparent rate constant and the end point of the primer extension reaction in the presence of ATP were unchanged when the concentration of POL was decreased from 1.4 to 0.7 or 0.35 μm, which implied that POL binding to the primer-template was not rate-limiting and that the reaction could be treated as a pseudo-first order process (data not shown). Also, the rate constant for dATP addition did not increase when the POL concentration was doubled to 2.8 μm (data not shown), signifying that enzyme binding to the primer-template was not rate-limiting for the DNA polymerase reaction. It was remarkable that the nucleotide substrate preference changed during the second cycle of templated dAMP or rAMP addition, as evinced by the fact that the level of the n+1 intermediate relative to the n+2 end product was much lower in the presence of dATP than it was with ATP (Fig. 1A). By plotting the distributions of the n+1 and n+2 species (expressed as percent of total label in each) as a function of time and fitting the data to a simple two-step reaction scheme using the program CKS (IBM, version 1.0), we estimated rate constants of 0.1 and 0.15 s–1 for the first and second dAMP incorporation steps, respectively, and rate constants of 0.5 and 0.055 s–1 for the first and second rAMP incorporation steps, respectively (not shown). These results underscore the theme that a ribonucleotide 3′ primer terminus has negative influence on the rate of further primer extension, be it with a dNMP as noted previously (6Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25973-25981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), or an rNMP as seen here. We found that LigD POL incorporated a single dTMP residue oppositeaTinthe template strand when dTTP was the only substrate available; 70% of the input primer was elongated after 20 min (Fig. 1A). The rate of dTMP misincorporation was ∼2% of the rate at which the correct dAMP residue was incorporated. LigD POL also misincorporated single dGMP and dCMP residues opposite the template dT, to the extent that 53 and 35% of the input primer was elongated after 20 min in the presence of dGTP and dCTP, respectively (Fig. 1A). Ribonucleotides were misincorporated more readily by LigD POL than the corresponding deoxynucleotides (Fig. 1A). The addition of single UMP, GMP, and CMP residues to the primer terminus proceeded to completion during the 20-min reaction; the rate constants for addition of UMP (0.02 s–1), GMP (0.01 s–1), and CMP (0.003 s–1) were slower by factors of 30, 60, and 200 than the rate of addition of the correct AMP ribonucleotide (Fig. 1B). However, UMP was incorporated 20-fold faster than dTMP; GMP was added ∼12-fold faster than dGMP; and extension with CMP was ∼5-fold faster than dCMP. Effects of the Templated Base on POL Fidelity—Fig. 2A shows the kinetics of elongation on a primer-template containing a templated dA nucleotide flanking the 3′-OH of the primer strand. LigD POL rapidly incorporated dTMP when provided with the correct dTTP substrate, such that nearly all of the input primer was extended within 1 min. Note that the POL did not"

Two single-chain Fv fragments (scFv) C5 and B7 derived from the variable regions of the anti-R13 mAb 17.2 were expressed. scFv C5 was a dimer and bound to TcP2beta with an affinity of K(d) = 8 nM, whereas scFv B7 was monomeric and had less affinity than scFv C5 for TcP2beta, K(d) = 46 nM. The affinity constant of scFv C5 to the second extracellular loop of the human beta1-AR was of 10 microM. Moreover, scFv C5 induced an increase in cAMP levels of CHO-K cells transfected with the human beta1-AR; scFv B7 had no effect but blocked isoproterenol stimulation. The agonist-like activity of scFv C5 and the antagonist activity of scFv B7 were both confirmed in vivo on heart beating frequency after their passive transfer to mice. Molecular modeling of the variable region of mAb 17.2 indicated which amino acids were likely to be involved in recognizing both peptide EDDDMGFGLF, derived from the R13 epitope of TcP2beta, and peptide ESDEARRCYN from the second extracellular loop of the human beta1-AR. It is plausible that the recently described cross-reaction of mAb 17.2 with rhodopsin can also be explained by this model. The physiological effects of this type of anti-T. cruzi antibodies may increase the liability of patients with Chagas disease."

Despite these properties, measurements of the stability of stalled elongation complexes have shown lifetimes that are much shorter than those of the multisubunit RNA polymerases. In this work, we demonstrate that the apparent instability of stalled complexes actually arises from the action of trailing RNA polymerases (traveling in the same direction) displacing the stalled complex. Moreover, the instability caused by collision between two polymerases is position dependent. A second polymerase is blocked from promoter binding when a leading complex is stalled 12 bp or less from the promoter. The trailing complex can bind and make abortive transcripts when the leading complex is between 12 and 20 bp from the promoter, but it cannot displace the first complex since it is in a unstable initiation conformation. Only when the leading complex is stalled more than 20 bp away from the promoter can a second polymerase bind, initiate, and displace the leading complex.

The process of transcription is characterized by distinct phases: initiation, elongation, and termination, at the simplest. In general, transcription complexes stalled near the promoter (within the first 8–10 bases) are much less stable than those stalled very distant from the promoter (1Carpousis A.J. Gralla J.D.

The transition between initiation and elongation is a complex process, involving release of stable promoter contacts and rearrangement of the protein and the nucleic acid (5Martin C.T. Esposito E.A. Theis K. Gong P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2005; 80: 323-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 6Yin Y.W. Steitz T.A.

Since the released transcripts are relatively short, there should not be a large cellular price to inefficiency at this stage. In contrast, elongation complexes distant from the promoter must be very stable to productively synthesize long transcripts. The single subunit RNA polymerase from bacteriophage T7 presents an ideal model system in which to study transcription fundamentals. The enzyme is highly specific for a small 22-bp promoter and exhibits all the basic steps characteristic of the more complex multisubunit RNA polymerases (8Oakley J.L. Coleman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4266-4270Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 9McAllister W.T. Cell Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 385-391PubMed Google Scholar). As with the latter, initially transcribing complexes, with transcripts up to about 8 nucleotides, are particularly unstable and abortive products are released with frequency (1Carpousis A.J.

Recent structural and biochemical studies indicate that a dramatic transition occurs on translocation beyond position +8 and, while the enzyme-DNA-RNA ternary complex is relatively unstable before the transition, the complex becomes much more stable as the complex enters into the elongation stage (5Martin C.T.

A previous study found that the apparent stability of complexes stepping away from the promoter follows an unexpected pattern: complexes stalled at positions +10 and +14 were observed to be more stable than complexes stalled at position +22 (15Mentesana P.E. Chin-Bow S.T. Sousa R. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1049-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This result implied special properties for complexes recently clear of the promoter and suggested that the transition to elongation was not complete for complexes stepped out to position +14, in contrast to our recent models suggesting that the transition is complete shortly after synthesis of about 8 bases of RNA (5Martin C.T. Esposito E.A. Theis K. Gong P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2005; 80: 323-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 11Gong P. Esposito E.A. Martin C.T. J. Biol.

In the current work, we suggest that the stability of complexes stalled at positions short of about position +20 may in fact more generally reflect the intrinsic stability of isolated ternary elongation complexes. Complexes stalled beyond position +20 can derive additional functional instability through “bumping,” as described below. A collision between an elongating (trailing) RNA polymerase and a stalled (leading) RNA polymerase might be expected to lead to an increased instability in one or both complexes and hence to release of one or both. In the multisubunit RNA polymerases, when a trailing elongation complex encounters a paused or stalled complex on the same strand (that is, transcribing in the same direction), the trailing complex cannot pass the leading polymerase and remains stably bound (16Wang F.J. Reiss C. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 30: 969-981PubMed Google Scholar, 17Epshtein V. Nudler E. Science. 2003; 300: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 18Epshtein V. Toulme F. Rahmouni A.R. Borukhov S. Nudler E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4719-4727Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In contrast, transcribing elongation complexes of T7 RNA polymerase have been demonstrated to be able to displace a variety of proteins bound very tightly to downstream DNA (19Campbell Jr., F.E. Setzer D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3978-3986Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 20Gallego F. Fernandez-Busquets X. Daban J.

If in the T7 system a trailing RNA polymerase can displace a (leading) stalled ternary RNA polymerase complex, then collisions of this sort might add to the other factors contributing to the measured stability of a stalled (leading) complex. Bumping of this sort could decrease the apparent stability of elongation complexes via a mechanism distinct from (but not independent of) energetic considerations intrinsic to an isolated stalled complex (illustrated in Fig. 1a). It is important to note that statistically, even at 1:1 polymerase:promoter DNA ratios, the probability of such collisions is expected to be significant. In most in vitro transcription studies, the polymerase:promoter DNA ratios are above or close to 1:1, so these experiments may not yield a true measure of the intrinsic stability of a stalled elongation complex (15Mentesana P.E. Chin-Bow S.T. Sousa R. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1049-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 22Santangelo T.J. Roberts J.W. Mol.

Biol. 1997; 269: 10-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To measure directly the impact of bumping by a trailing elongation complex on the stability of a leading polymerase, the stability of stalled complexes must be measured at a variety of polymerase to promoter DNA ratios. In the current study, we demonstrate that the stability of a stalled polymerase decreases dramatically at high polymerase to promoter DNA ratios, where multiple polymerases can initiate from the same promoter and allow collisions between a stalled leading complex and a lagging polymerase transcribing from behind. This result is confirmed by differential labeling of the leading and lagging complex transcripts. In a collision, the transcript from the leading RNA polymerase is released, with the lagging complex continuing on to the original stall site. In this work, we also show that complexes stalled short of about position +20 are not efficiently displaced by a lagging complex, even at high enzyme ratios, either because a lagging complex cannot bind (leading complex stalled short of position +12 and so occluding the promoter) or because the lagging complex can bind and initiate, but is physically blocked from proceeding beyond the relatively unstable initially transcribing phase (leading complex stalled at positions from about +12 through +20). In the latter case, the trailing complex shows increased release of abortive transcripts. Expression and Purification of RNA Polymerase—N-terminal His-tagged T7 RNA polymerase was prepared from Escherichia coli strain BL21 carrying the plasmid pBH161 (kindly supplied by William T. McAllister). The enzyme was then purified by an affinity column with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (27He B. Rong M. Lyakhov D. Gartenstein H. Diaz G. Castagna R. McAllister W.T. Durbin R.K. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 9: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The purity of the enzyme (>95%) was checked by SDS-PAGE analysis. The concentration of the enzyme was determined by its absorbance at 280 nm using ϵ280 = 1.4 × 105m–1 cm–1. The enzyme was stored in 20 mm potassium phosphate, 50% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm sodium chloride at –20 °C. Preparation of DNA Templates—Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the phosphoramidite method using an Applied Biosystem Expedite 8909 DNA synthesizer. All reagents were purchased from Transgenomic and Glen Research. A 3′-biotin TEG-CPG column (Glen Research) was used to add a biotin functionality at the 3′ end of the DNA used in the magnetic particle beads assay described below. The synthesized single strand DNAs were purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. DNA from excised gel was electroeluted using an Elu-Trap® device (Schleicher & Schuell Inc.), followed by ethanol precipitation. The concentrations of purified oligonucleotide were determined as described (28Schick C. Martin C.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4275-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The purity of the oligonucleotides was checked by denaturing gel electrophoresis of endlabeled single-stranded DNA. Double strand DNA templates were prepared by mixing at a 1:1 molar ratio of two complementary single strands in TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.8), heated to 90 °C, slowly cool down to room temperature (∼3 h). Transcription Assays—Unless otherwise noted, transcription reactions were carried out at 37 °C in a total volume of 10 μl. Different amounts of T7 RNA polymerase and DNA template were mixed to reach the target enzyme/DNA ratio (the final concentration of the limiting reagent was at the range of 50–200 nm); after incubating at 37 °C for 1 min, NTPs were added to a final concentration of 400 μm each to initiate the reaction, and RNA transcripts were labeled with [α-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The final reaction buffer contains 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.4 mm EDTA, 15 mm magnesium acetate, 12.5 mm potassium glutamate, 0.025% Tween 20, and about 70 mm sodium chloride (high salt was used to prevent aggregation of T7 RNA polymerase at high concentration, and it was verified that this level of salt will not interfere with the activity of the enzyme). After the reaction was quenched with equal volume transcription stop solution (8 m urea, 50 mm EDTA, 0.01% each of bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol), the samples were heated to 90 °C for 5 min and loaded onto a 20% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel. Following electrophoresis, gels were dried and RNA transcripts were quantified by a phosphorimager (Typhoon 9210 scanner, Amersham Biosciences). Immobilized Bead Assay, Leading Polymerase—Ten pmol of biotinylated DNA template (G,A to +15, G,A,C to +34, runoff is at +55) bound to streptavidin beads (Dynabeads® M280 streptavidin, Dynal Biotech) were incubated with equimolar T7 RNA polymerase in 20 μl of 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 6 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 units RNase inhibitor RNasin (Promega), a 50 μm concentration each of GTP and ATP at room temperature for 20 min to produce a 15-mer RNA complex. After three washes with 200 μl of buffer A (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 6 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm KCl), beads containing 15-mer complexes were resuspended into 200 μl of buffer A. The sample was then divided into 25-μl aliquots. Reactions were chased at room temperature for 10 min with a buffer containing 5 μm each of GTP and CTP, 1.7 μm [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The resulting radiolabeled 34-mer complexes were stable and functional. After a wash to remove NTPs, those aliquots containing +34 complexes were subjected to bumping assays by addition of fresh T7 RNA polymerase to 0.5 μm and NTP mixtures of 400 μm GTP (control), 400 μm GTP, and 100 μm ATP (control) or 400 μm GTP, 100 μm ATP, and 10 μm CTP (test). After separation, transcription stop solution was added to the bead and supernatant fractions, respectively. Samples were then heated and loaded onto a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel for separation and analysis. Immobilized Bead Assay, Trailing Polymerase—The same DNA templates were used as above. As described above, leading T7 RNA polymerases were first walked to position +15 with a 50 μm concentration each of GTP and ATP and then after washing were chased to position +34 with a 5 μm concentration each of GTP, ATP, and CTP without radioactive labeling and then washed. Trailing RNA polymerase was then added and walked to position +15 by addition of a 50 μm concentration each of GTP and ATP. After washing, trailing complexes were then chased with 400 μm GTP, 100 μm ATP, 10 μm CTP, and [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the presence of a 35-fold molar excess (relative to the biotinylated DNA) of promoter sink (double-stranded DNA with a Φ10 T7 promoter sequence from positions –17 to –5 on the nontemplate strand and from positions –17 to +3 on template strand) to prevent reinitiation by released RNA polymerases. Samples of beads and supernatant were then analyzed as above. If a (trailing) transcribing RNA polymerase can displace a downstream stalled complex, the collision-induced instability of the latter should be apparent only under conditions that allow initiation on the same DNA by a second, trailing RNA polymerase. Thus, this effect is expected to be highest at high ratios of polymerase to promoter. Collisions should also be possible only when the leading RNA polymerase has cleared the promoter sufficiently to allow a second, trailing enzyme to bind the promoter and initiate transcription. The following experiments explore these predictions. Concentration Dependence of Apparent Elongation Complex Stability—Stabilities of stalled complexes are assessed here by following the amount of turnover of those complexes in a given time period (2 min). Under the conditions used, stably stalled complexes will show low turnover and therefore less RNA production. In contrast, decreased stalled complex stability will allow the release of RNA polymerase molecules, enabling them to reinitiate and leading to increased overall turnover. The titration shown in Fig. 2 demonstrates that initiation of transcription, as evidenced by release of stalled 6-mer transcripts, increases only slightly beyond the (1:1) equivalence point, as expected (diamonds, Fig. 2c). This is true at all ratios of enzyme to DNA, as only one enzyme can productively bind each DNA (the intrinsic instability of abortive 6-mer leads to multiple turnovers per complex). In contrast, for complexes stalled clear of the promoter (in this case, at position +34), total turnover is strongly dependent on concentration well beyond the equivalence point (circles, Fig. 2c). At high ratios of enzyme to DNA, as soon as one enzyme clears the promoter, a second can bind, initiate and displace the first, leading to higher turnover. Note that turnover for complexes stalled at position +34 appears to saturate at about the same rate as abortive synthesis, limited presumably by initiation. Positional Dependence of Bumping—As noted above, for a second RNA polymerase to initiate transcription, the leading RNA polymerase must be sufficiently clear of the promoter to allow the trailing enzyme to bind. To test this hypothesis, DNA constructs were prepared that allow stalling of the leading RNA polymerase at varying distances from the promoter. To minimize sequence specific effects on stalling, the constructs shown in Fig. 3a were designed to include (where possible) the identical DNA sequences 10 bases upstream of the stall site and downstream to the end of the DNA. The results presented in Fig. 3b and summarized in Fig. 4a show that complexes are the least stable in stalling short of position +8, consistent with earlier studies (1Carpousis A.J. Gralla J.D. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3245-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 10Martin C.T. Muller D.K. Coleman J.E.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8783-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1869) Google Scholar). For complexes stalled up to position +12, turnover at each position is similar in the presence of either excess DNA or excess enzyme. In the presence of excess RNA polymerase, turnover increases (stability decreases) as complexes are stalled beyond position +16, as observed earlier (15Mentesana P.E. Chin-Bow S.T. Sousa R. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1049-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the presence of excess DNA, where bumping should be minimal, complexes stalled beyond position +20 show the continued low turnover (high stability) characteristic of complexes stalled at position +14 (15Mentesana P.E. Chin-Bow S.T. Sousa R. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1049-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A plot of the ratio of stall turnover in the presence of excess enzyme to that in the presence of excess DNA, presented in Fig. 4b (dark bars and right axis), confirms this dramatic change in complexes stalled past position +16. Stalling at positions beyond this point, the ratio of instability under excess enzyme to instability under excess DNA rises dramatically. Thus, when a leading complex is positioned at position +20 and beyond, a trailing complex can bind, initiate, and displace the leading complex. Abortive Products Are Maximal for a Stall Near Position +16—The structures and footprints of the initiation and elongation complexes suggest that a trailing RNA polymerase should be able to bind to the promoter when a leading complex is positioned at +16 or +20, yet a leading complex stalled at these positions appears to be stable, even at high enzyme ratios. An earlier study points to an explanation: for a leading complex stalled clear of, but very near, the promoter (at position +14), a trailing polymerase can bind the promoter and initiate but is limited to synthesis of short (abortive length) transcripts, it cannot stably translocate (23Guajardo R. Lopez P. Dreyfus M. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 777-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The analysis presented in Fig. 4b, light bars and left axis, shows that under conditions of excess enzyme, overall abortive synthesis increases when the leading polymerase is stalled at positions +12 through +20, reaching a maximum near +16. We interpret this to mean that with a leading polymerase stalled at those positions, a trailing RNA polymerase can bind and initiate but cannot transition to a fully stable elongation complex; thus, the trailing RNA polymerase synthesizes primarily abortive products, while the leading RNA polymerase remains stably bound. The data suggest that beyond position +20, a stalled leading RNA polymerase allows the trailing RNA polymerase to bind, initiate, and transition to a stable complex. The trailing RNA polymerase then no longer produces excessive amounts of abortive products (light bars in Fig. 4b) and can now bump into and destabilize the leading RNA polymerase, forcing it to turnover more frequently (dark bars in Fig. 4b). Assessing the Fate of the Leading Complex RNA—To directly assess displacement of the RNA associated with the leading complex, we carried out a series of reactions in which only the RNA in the leading complex is radiolabeled. Does subsequent transcription by a trailing complex cause release of the RNA from the leading complex? Reactions were run with biotin-labeled DNA immobilized on streptavidin coated magnetic beads. As shown in Fig. 5a, complexes were walked with GTP, ATP, and CTP to a stall at position +34 in the presence of [α-32P]ATP. Complexes were then washed to remove free enzyme and radiolabel. Subsequent addition of fresh RNA polymerase and an appropriate mix of unlabeled NTPs allow walking of a second RNA polymerase to position +3 (GTP only), +15 (GTP and ATP), or to +34 (GTP, ATP, and CTP). The first two experiments provide controls in which the trailing enzyme initiates but is not allowed to proceed a sufficient distance to collide with the trailing complex. A control was also included in which GTP, ATP, and CTP were added in the absence of added RNA polymerase. In all three controls, the labeled RNA associated with the trailing complex remains associated with the beads, as expected. In the experiment that allows the trailing complex to collide with the leading complex (GTP, ATP, CTP, and polymerase), the RNA from the leading complex is displaced into solution. The trailing RNA polymerase has displaced the RNA, consistent with its displacing the leading enzyme as well. Assessing the Fate of the Trailing Complex RNA—To assess the fate of the trailing complex in the collision with a leading complex, we reversed the experiment from Fig. 5. In particular, what happens to the RNA in the trailing complex? In the experiment shown in Fig. 6, the leading complex is walked to a stall at position +34 using unlabeled GTP, ATP, and CTP. The system is then washed to remove free enzyme and NTPs. Fresh enzyme is added and trailing complexes are walked to position +15, just short of the stalled complex at position +34. The resulting DNA, with RNA polymerase complexes stalled at positions +15 and +34, is then washed to remove free enzyme and NTPs. Finally, a 35-fold excess of promoter sink construct is added to prevent reinitiation and the trailing polymerase is walked forward by addition of GTP, ATP, CTP, and [α-32P]CTP. In this situation, only RNA extended from trailing complexes will be labeled. The results presented in Fig. 6b show that a majority of the RNA in the trailing complex is extended fully to the downstream stall site at position +34. Thus, the trailing complex must have fully displaced the leading complex, consistent with the results from Fig. 5. Moreover, the RNA remains associated with the beads, indicating that the trailing complex has transformed into a stably stalled complex in place of the original stalled complex. The current study demonstrates clearly that a stalled (leading) T7 RNA polymerase can be efficiently replaced by a second polymerase transcribing from behind (trailing) on the same DNA template, as summarized in Fig. 7. However, the trailing RNA polymerase must have progressed sufficiently to progress to a stable elongation complex. An initially transcribing complex that has not made this transition is itself displaced on collision with a leading, stalled complex. This presumably reflects the relative instability of an initially transcribing complex relative to that of a stably elongating one. Thus the apparent stability (15Mentesana P.E. Chin-Bow S.T. Sousa R. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1049-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) of stalled elongation complexes (stalled beyond at least position +20) is a function not only of parameters intrinsic to the complex (24Wilson K.S. Conant C.R. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1179-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 30von Hippel P.H. Science. 1998; 281: 660-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) but also of the presence of other RNA polymerase molecules transcribing on the same strand. As demonstrated by the data in Fig. 2, this is expected to be significant even for 1:1 ratios of enzyme to template DNA. The statistical basis for this is clear if one imagines 10 enzymes evenly distributed and stalled on 10 DNA molecules. When one enzyme dissociates, it now sees 10 empty and identical promoters. The probability that it will reinitiate from the promoter from which it came is only 1 in 10, while reinitiation from any of the other 9 will lead to bumping. Only at a large excess of DNA template can one assume the absence of bumping, as illustrated here. This finding explains earlier, somewhat puzzling results. In particular, it was shown that elongation complexes stalled at positions +10 and +14 were observed to be more stable than complexes stalled at position +22 (15Mentesana P.E. Chin-Bow S.T. Sousa R. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1049-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Similarly, elongation complexes prepared on beads (where excess RNA polymerase is removed) show the higher stability that we now know is more reflective of the intrinsic stability (31Song H. Kang C. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 32Nudler E. Avetissova E. Markovtsov V. Goldfarb A.

A. 2000; 97: 14109-14114Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The results presented here show that complexes stalled at position +15 have about the same stability as complexes stalled much farther out but at low enzyme to DNA ratios (we also measured half-lives of complexes stalled at +15 and +34 by their turnover rates at low enzyme to DNA ratio, and we find they are about the same). This suggests that complete conversion to a final elongation complex occurs on or before translocation to position +15, likely sooner. By position +15, there should be about 7–8 bases of RNA beyond the hybrid, through an RNA exit channel thought to hold about 7–8 bases (6Yin Y.W. Steitz T.A. Science. 2002; 298: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 33Temiakov D. Mentesana P.E. Ma K. Mustaev A. Borukhov S. McAllister W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It has been proposed that T7 RNA polymerase, once dissociated from an elongation complex, only very slowly isomerizes back to an initiation competent form (35Ferrari R. Rivetti C. Dieci G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This might provide an alternate explanation for some of our results in that at high enzyme to DNA ratios, there is always an excess of “initiation competent” enzyme, ready to begin a new round of transcription quickly. We find this explanation unlikely for two reasons. First, bead-isolated elongation complexes reinitiate very quickly following displacement by a trailing polymerase (data not shown). For this reason, pulse labeling was used in the experiments of Fig. 6. Second, the results here would require that the slowly rearranging conformation does not become established until after the polymerase has translocated beyond at least position +20. The proposal put forth here is much simpler and fully consistent with all available data. To mimic the situation in vivo, we also tested bumping of a stalled elongation complex (at +34) in the presence of the next incoming NTP (3′-deoxy-NTP), the level of bumping is the same as in the absence of the next incoming NTP (data not shown). This implies that the pairing of the next incoming NTP with the template base at the active site does not provide sufficient extra stability to make the stalled complex more resistant to bumping. The behavior described here stands in contrast to that of the multisubunit bacterial RNA polymerase. In the latter system, a trailing RNA polymerase can “push” a stalled, leading complex but cannot fully displace it. The bacterial RNA polymerase does show one similarity to the single subunit enzyme in that stalling of a leading E. coli RNA polymerase away from, but in close proximity to, the promoter enhances abortive synthesis by a trailing complex (36Kubori T. Shimamoto N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2640-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the bacterial system, a leading complex stalled at position +32 limits the trailing complex, while a leading complex stalled at position +73 has no effect on abortive cycling of the trailing complex. These positional dependencies are consistent with the larger size of the bacterial enzyme. In summary, the results presented here argue strongly that measurements of intrinsic complex stability must be done at low enzyme:DNA ratios to be free of effects from bumping. The results are also consistent with a simple model in which the transition to a stable elongation complex in the T7 system occurs shortly after translocation beyond about 8 base pairs (11Gong P.

https://openalex.org/W2132751375,"Sialic acid containing glycosphingolipids (gangliosides) are thought to play important roles in the function of various biological phenomena such as atherosclerosis. We have previously shown that the overexpression of the disialoganglioside (GD3) synthase gene effectively suppresses cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and MMP-9 expression in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). However, the issue of how the overexpression of GD3 synthase gene results in the inhibition of cellular responses in VSMC remains unclear. The findings herein demonstrate that overexpression of the GD3 synthase gene suppresses VSMC responses through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Superoxide and hydrogen peroxide were generated at increased levels in GD3 synthase gene transfectants in comparison with empty vector (EV) -transfected VSMC. This phenomenon was blocked by antioxidants such as N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC). Increased ROS generation was associated with a decreased endogenous antioxidant activity, increased lipid peroxidation, and mitochondrial DNA damage. Further studies revealed that the blockade of ROS function with antioxidants reversed the effect of GD3 synthase gene overexpression on VSMC proliferation and cell cycle regulation in response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). In addition, we found that treatment with antioxidants reversed the decreased matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression in response to TNF-alpha as determined by zymography and immunoblot in GD3 synthase gene transfectants. This recovery effect was characterized by the up-regulation of MMP-9 promoter activity, which was transcriptionally regulated at NF-kappaB and activation protein-1 (activating protein (AP) -1) sites in the MMP-9 promoter. These findings suggest that ROS may play a role in GD3 synthase gene-mediated VSMC phenotypic changes that may contribute to plaque instability in atherosclerosis."

In the rat cerebellum, Purkinje cell apoptosis is exacerbated when cerebellar slices are cultured during the first postnatal week. To understand the mechanism of this developmental apoptosis, we took advantage of its inhibition by the steroid analog mifepristone. This effect did not involve the classical steroid nuclear receptors. Microarray analysis revealed that mifepristone down-regulated mRNA levels of the Na+/K+-ATPase alpha3 subunit more than three times. Consistent with the down-regulation of the Na+/K+-ATPase, mifepristone caused Purkinje cell membrane depolarization. Depolarizing agents like ouabain (1 microM), tetraethylammonium (2 mM), and veratridine (2 microM) protected Purkinje cells from apoptosis. These results suggest a role of excitatory inputs in Purkinje cell survival during early postnatal development. Indeed, coculturing cerebellar slices with glutamatergic inferior olivary neuron preparations allowed rescue of Purkinje cells. These findings reveal a new neuroprotective mechanism of mifepristone and support a pivotal role for excitatory inputs in the survival of Purkinje neurons. Mifepristone may be a useful lead compound in the development of novel therapeutic approaches for maintaining the resting potential of neurons at values favorable for their survival under neuropathological conditions."

Here we tested the hypothesis that PTMs on neuronal tubulins selectively accumulate in a pathological protein fraction in AD. We used new software, P-MOD, to identify comprehensively and map PTMs using mass spectral data from soluble (normal) and detergent-insoluble (pathological) protein fractions from AD, as well as total extracts from controls, for selected proteins: Abeta, tau, apolipoprotein (apo) E, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), alpha-III tubulin, and beta-III tubulin. Our results confirmed direct observations of others by identifying methionine (M) sulfoxides at Abeta position 35 and numerous sites of tau phosphorylation in detergent-insoluble protein from AD, while no PTMs were enriched on primarily astrocyte-derived apoE or GFAP in this fraction. P-MOD mapped several abundant M sulfoxides to neuron-enriched beta-III tubulin but not its heterodimeric partner, neuron-enriched alpha-III tubulin, a result confirmed by selective suppression of CNBr-mediated cleavage of beta-III tubulin. These findings are the first comprehensive assessment of PTMs in AD and point to oxidative modification of beta-III tubulin as a potential contributor to the neuronal cytoskeletal disruption that is characteristic of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2057169459,"Scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) has been shown to be expressed in human atherosclerotic plaque macrophages, where it is believed to reduce atherosclerosis by promoting cholesterol efflux. In this study we investigated the influence of aspirin and other NSAIDs on SR-BI expression and function in cultured human macrophages as well as in different mouse strains. Incubation of human macrophages with 0.5 mmol/l aspirin resulted in increased SR-BI protein expression and increased uptake of HDL-associated [3H]cholesteryl oleate without changes of SR-BI mRNA levels. In contrast, using 5 mmol/l of aspirin, SR-BI expression and function were significantly decreased. Sodium salicylate exerted similar effects on SR-BI expression, whereas no effects were observed using known COX1/2 inhibitors ibuprofen and naproxen, respectively. In in vivo studies low-dose aspirin treatment (6 mg/kg.day) induced SR-BI expression in wild-type and PPAR-alpha knockout mice, respectively, whereas the opposite effect was observed upon high-dose aspirin treatment (60 mg/kg.day) in these animals. We could show that COX-independent effects of aspirin were able to enhance expression of SR-BI in macrophages in a post-transcriptional, PPAR-alpha independent way, suggesting a novel pharmacologic effect of aspirin."
https://openalex.org/W1972431808,"Aberrant centrosome numbers are detected in virtually all human cancers where they can contribute to chromosomal instability by promoting mitotic spindle abnormalities. Despite their widespread occurrence, the molecular mechanisms that underlie centrosome amplification are only beginning to emerge. Here, we present evidence for a novel regulatory circuit involved in centrosome overduplication that centers on RNA polymerase II (pol II). We found that human papillomavirus type 16 E7 (HPV-16 E7)- and hydroxyurea (HU)-induced centriole overduplication are abrogated by α-amanitin, a potent and specific RNA pol II inhibitor. In contrast, normal centriole duplication proceeded undisturbed in α-amanitin-treated cells. Centriole overduplication was significantly reduced by siRNA-mediated knock down of CREB-binding protein (CBP), a transcriptional co-activator. We identified cyclin A2 as a key transcriptional target of RNA pol II during HU-induced centriole overduplication. Collectively, our results show that ongoing RNA pol II transcription is required for centriole overduplication whereas it may be dispensable for normal centriole duplication. Given that many chemotherapeutic agents function through inhibition of transcription, our results may help to develop strategies to target centrosome-mediated chromosomal instability for cancer therapy and prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2044225452,"CD14 is a high-affinity receptor protein for the complex of bacterial LPS (LPS) and LPS binding protein in animals. Binding of the soluble form of CD14 (sCD14) to LPS, found in the outer membrane of Escherichia coli and other Gram-negative bacteria, enhances host innate immune responses, reduces the severity of mastitis, and facilitates clearance and neutralization of LPS, thus protecting against an excessive immune response to LPS and development of endotoxic shock. A truncated form of sCD14, carrying a histidine residue affinity tag for purification, was incorporated into Potato virus X for transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Western blots probed with CD14-specific antibodies demonstrated that crude plant extracts and affinity-purified samples contained immunoreactive sCD14. Biological activity of plant-derived recombinant bovine sCD14 (PrbosCD14) was demonstrated in vitro by LPS-induced apoptosis and interleukin (IL) -8 production in bovine endothelial cells, and in vivo by enhancement of LPS-induced neutrophil recruitment. Finally, in PrbosCD14-infused glands subsequently infected with E. coli, lower numbers of viable bacteria were recovered and there was an absence of clinical symptoms, demonstrating prophylactic efficacy of PrbosCD14. This is the first report of a functionally active animal receptor protein made in plants and the prophylactic use of a plant-derived protein to reduce the severity of bacterial infections in animals."
https://openalex.org/W2074232613,"E2a/Pbx1 is a fusion oncoprotein resulting from the t(1;19) translocation found in human pre-B acute lymphocytic leukemia and in a small number of acute T-lymphoid and myeloid leukemias. It was previously suggested that E2a/Pbx1 could cooperate with normal or oncogenic signaling pathways to immortalize myeloid and lymphoid progenitor cells. To address this question, we introduced the receptor of the macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF-R) in pro-T cells immortalized by a conditional, estradiol-dependent, E2a/Pbx1-protein, and continuously proliferating in response to stem cell factor and interleukin-7. We asked whether M-CSF-R would be functional in an early T progenitor cell and influence the fate of E2a/Pbx1-immortalized cells. E2a-Pbx1 immortalized pro-T cells could proliferate and shifted from lymphoid to myeloid lineage after signaling through exogenously expressed M-CSF-R, irrespective of the presence of estradiol. However, terminal macrophage differentiation of the cells was obtained only when estradiol was withdrawn from cultures. This demonstrated that M-CSF-R is functional for proliferation and differentiation signaling in a T-lymphoid progenitor cell, which, in addition, unveiled myeloid potential of pro-T progenitors. Moreover, the block of differentiation induced by the E2a/Pbx1 oncogene could be modulated by hematopoietic cytokines such as M-CSF, suggesting plasticity of leukemic progenitor cells. Finally, additional experiments suggested that PU.1 and eight twenty-one transcriptional regulators might be implicated in the mechanisms of oncogenesis by E2a/Pbx1."
https://openalex.org/W2066890529,"“The heart of the problem is that equal talent and accomplishment are viewed as unequal when seen through the eyes of prejudice . . .” With these words, the MIT Women Faculty Committee summarized its 1999 report on obstacles faced by women in science (1). Gender bias and prejudice, born of conflicting beliefs about the “natures” of women and men, what they can and cannot, should and should not do, is now a well tilled field in the social sciences. Since gender bias and prejudice have been made visible, their impact is diminished. But, unequal evaluations can still be found. Are there other sources of prejudice that continue to hinder the advancement of women? I would argue that there are. Bias and prejudice born of conflicting beliefs about the “nature” of science can have a serious impact on the evaluation of scientific talent. Since all scientists agree on what constitutes good scientific evidence, if its quality were the only criterion for judgment, there could be no bias in evaluating the talent of any individual scientist. But, other factors also influence who is chosen, and who chooses to practice science. Personal and cultural perspectives are involved in a scientist’s choice of what kind of science to do, and how to do it (2). They can also influence the criteria used to evaluate other scientists’ choices. Einstein must have understood this when he wrote:"
https://openalex.org/W1987954733,"Investment in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has paid significant dividends to the American people, as NIH Director Elias Zerhouni noted in his testimony before Congress this spring (1). While the benefits to date have been impressive, the most dramatic and valuable returns on our investment are yet to come. However, a potential stumbling block to our continued success and international leadership is our inability to ensure that a new generation of scientists has the resources needed to carry on the work that has already been started. While scientific opportunities have never been greater and the numbers of grant applications has been rising steadily, success rates for R01 applications from new investigators have dropped to a new low of 16.8% in 2004. If other indicators are used, for example “paylines” (the cutoff score in any one review cycle), then the chance of being funded on any given grant application may be well below 10%. This is an alarming deterrent for any young person considering a career in biomedical research. Prospects for correcting or reversing this situation are shrinking. Inflation is eroding the purchasing power of the flat NIH budgets, and competition among experienced investigators is at an all-time high. Without funding increases in FY2006, conditions will become even worse. It is hard to measure opportunity in science or to assess its change over time. But one indicator that can be quantified is the number of applications for research grants. Applications for NIH Research Project Grants (RPGs) rose from 25,224 in 1995 to 34,710 in 2003, the final year of the five year doubling of the NIH budget (2). In 2004 and 2005, NIH’s budget remained flat while scientific opportunities in biomedicine continued to increase. By 2004 and 2005, the number of RPG applications rose to 43,069, an increase of 24% over a two year period. As a result of “no-growth” budgets and obligations to ongoing projects and programs, however, NIH was able to fund fewer new grants during these two years, and overall success rates fell from 29.9% in 2003 to 22.3% in 2005. Scientific opportunities have continued to expand, but funding opportunities at NIH have not. This situation is especially hard on investigators beginning their research careers. While they are the most critical component of our continued leadership in science and innovation, they are the most vulnerable group when it comes to fluctuations and downturns in funding. They may encounter more lucrative career options in other fields of endeavor and, in many cases, options for scientific careers in other nations. As a result, their career choices are very sensitive to research funding opportunities. Many have made and will continue to make sacrifices for the chance to work in science, but as the barriers to research careers grow higher these altruistic decisions are severely challenged and may no longer be sustainable. Not only are new investigators the most fragile component of the research enterprise, they have also been hit hardest by the increased competition for research funding. This situation is particularly alarming in the case of R01 grants. In fiscal years 1995 and 1996 there were just over 1300 “new” (type 1) R01 grants awarded to previously unfunded scientists, those individuals seeking their first R01 grants from NIH (Fig. 1). After a sizeable increase to 1420 in 1997, the number of R01 grants awarded to previously unfunded scientists grew at a more modest rate (about 50 awards per year) over"
